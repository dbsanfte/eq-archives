It's relatively cheap to make, and it'll get you all the way up to 248 (provided your patience lasts that long). There are several places where all of the items needed for the combine (all vendor-purchased, by the way) are just a short walk apart (South Qeynos was my location of choice, but there are others that are just as good).<br>

You got it punk!</span><hr size=1> Wow!  A true free market economy.  The value of every item is directly related to it's availability, and to what the buyer and seller are willing to make a deal on.  <br>
  The only way to make tradeskills more valueable would be to make it harder and harder to be a grandmaster.  <br>
<br>
example QAT...I too will be selling and giving away the stuff soon.  I decided to learn brewing.  Although I have not tracked it closely I have not spent more then 200 plat to get my skill to 140.  It took me about 8 hours of real time over three days.  I have all the items I need to raise my skill up to 160.(once my wrists recover).  I have enough compoents to make about 1000 QAT in my bank...Now I do not know the fail rate at a skill of 160, nor do I know the cost...(I really intend to grandmaster tailoring, I may find the QAT fail rate too high even at 199, in which case you will have another customer(me)).<br>
   man I am rambling...the point was it is not that hard to run up a given skill.  Since there are no real life controls. A true grandmaster tradeperson is limited by their real talent.  IN EQ people are not limited by their god given talents, It is a formula.  So what will limit it?  Only supply will limit it.  If a market is flooded store your stock...stop producing...do not sell, or take a break from producing more.  Do not take part in a price war with some boob who is selling too low.  You know your true cost, stick to it.  If Some gomer is selling below cost, take a break, let him loose the money.  He will get tired and stop...or run out of money...then you can put out your shingle again.  All tradeskills that have a consumeable item as the product will eventually stablelize at an profitable price.  Unlike real life time is on your side.  You never go out of business for lack of customers...they cannot win a price war.  now gratned going through the cycle 150 times is little fun, but you will always win.  An alternate path might be to take the product to the customer...visit the zone where people are likly to be, and have the level to have the money to meet your price.  There are too many sellers in the Bazaar.  Take a duffle bag full to rathe mountians and sell to the giant hunting parties...I bet they would buy(after you told them what it is).<br>
<br>
Find the angle, find the nich, example: On mith marr server, before luclin, and when zoneing was slower.  I spent my mid 20s in South K.  since everything was camped almost 24X7 I got an idea...and Arggy's Banking services were opened.   I would exchange plat for gold/Silver/copper and charge a commission.  I made a fortune off of the campers who did not want to give up their camps.<br>

Now, assuming I can skill up very cheap, total cost before I can make these drinks is about 3kpp.  Now, if I sold these at 10pp each, it would take, what, about 350 drinks sold to break even.  That's fine.  But I'm betting some dolt is gonna start selling them for 5pp each cause he decided to skill up all at once and wants to clear inventory... now it's around 750 sold drinks to break even.  And then someone undercuts that guy cause they're pissed off, and there it goes... and I've lost a good bit of cash.  Ugh.  Which is why I'm not raising brewing much anymore, just enough to make my Spiritstones.<br>

Just live with the fact that you aren't the only source now and that proffits WILL be lower.  If you drive the price down to rock bottom, you will also lower the expectations and willingness of players to pay higher prices if you do manage to drive out competition.<br>

OTH, the only winners in a price war will be the FV consumers.  So, go for it!  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :p --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":p"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

BTW, FV has some of the lowest prices anywhere for player-made items.  I'm constantly amazed at the incredibly low prices and the sheer number of highly skilled tradeskillers here.  I have this suspicion that RP'ers (even near-beer RP'ers) just plain like tradeskilling.  I had plans to do some tradeskills myself, but with all the GMs running about undercutting each other on pricing, I'm rethinking that. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/uazhreihieverdphlith.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Azhrei Hiever dPhlith</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Punter of Gnomes<br>Stealer of Dorfpickles<br>Master of Apep<br>ManWithReallyLongTitle</span><br> <font color=#A62A2A>(9/12/02 10:27 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm49.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=16.topic&index=27>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: You want it? You got it punk!</span><hr size=1> Personally I find the whole routine of &quot;Its all in the interest of the economy!&quot; or whatever excuses for selling things at a massive profit margin, to be just that: excuses.  IE BS.  People have a right to sell things at whatever price they want, I don't dispute that, but it is important to realize that its a two way street.  Historically/RL, the only time a product is sold at an obscene profit margin, is when that product is a monopoly.  No competition, no reason to lower prices, so the people at the top get fat off of their market dominance.  I find that same to hold true in EQ as well.   Whether you want to see tradeskills as an alternate means of earning money versus camping/adventuring, and whether Verant ever intended tradeskills to be used in that way, is completely irrelevant.  The facts come down to one simple thing; numbers.   Lets look at some numbers..<br>
<br>
Star ruby encrusted stein: cost to make at 200 skill 300pp, cost to make at 250 skill 70 - 140 plat.  Time to make: 20 minutes to get components for 20 attempts, so ~1 minute per unit.  Standard price the GM potters are selling it for in bazaar? 1200 (down from old monopoly price of 2k+<br>
<br>
Opal encrusted stein, cost to make at 200 skill 20 plat, cost to make at 250 skill 20 plat.  Time to make: same as Star Ruby Stein above.  Price potters are selling for in bazaar = 75 plat, down from old monopoly price of 250.<br>
<br>
Grobb liquidized meat, cost to make at 170 skill 60 plat per stack, cost to make at 250 skill 30 plat per stack.  Time to make: 15-30 min to prep materials for 20 attempts, which yields 6 full stacks of product (so ~3 min per stack).  Price GM brewers selling in bazaar = 200 plat/stack.<br>
<br>
Demi-sec champagne, cost to make at 200 skill 50 plat, cost to make at 250 skill 30 plat.  Time to make: 45 seconds.  Selling price in Bazaar ~200 plat (down from old price of 500 - 1k+)<br>
<br>
Blessed Fishing Pole, cost to make at 200 skill 125 - 500 plat depending if you can forage or not.  Time to make: 30-60 minutes if you forage components yourself, 15 minutes if you buy them in Bazaar; priced accordingly as above.  Price in bazaar 1500 - 2500 plat.<br>
<br>
Note these are just some examples.   Also note that I specifically focused on items which are purely store-bought components (except for the pole, which has easily obtainable parts).   Because they are storebought, there is absolute clarity on the cost to make; the cost is that which the vendor charges, and is not based to market fluctuation of &quot;farmed&quot; components.  These prices are not second hand, they are based upon my personal tradeskill experience.   Why do I put my time into tradeskills?  Because I don't like seeing my friends and my guild buying things that are marked up at a 500%+ profit margin.  Jewelery craft has always been a tradeskill which sells at about a 1.5 - 2.0 markup.   So why is it people feel it is acceptable to do a 5.0 - 10.0 markup on the other tradeskills?   Can you imagine if someone tried to charge 6k plat a pair for Velium fire opal rings instead of 800 plat a pair?   People would cry bloody murder.  I would love to hear someone explain to me and the rest of the world how Jewelery Craft pricing is any different from the pricing examples I used above.  <br>
<br>
EDIT: Removed Robe from the example list above, the pricing on it is too volatile (due to wild variance in the success/fail on chain) to allow for a fair &quot;average&quot; price listing.  Also, in response to Dorphen below, it should be noted that these costs are only materials, they don't include time in making the item or time in getting the skill up to the point where you can make attempts as per above.  HOWEVER, even with a very fair price markup included over cost of materials (to cover time/etc) my original point still stands that some of the prices people charge are quite simply wrong, obscene, disgusting, etc etc.  Example:  Grobb Liquid meat, while low cost per unit to make and is entirely storebought, does require time to make (multiple sub-combines leading up to final combine).  The final combine produces 6 units however, and making mass quantities of the stuff is relatively simple/inexpensive, if a bit tedious.<br>
<br>
Also added &quot;time to make&quot;, for the sake of completeness. <p><br>Azhrei Hiever d'Phlith, 59th Enforcer of Innoruuk's Word

3) Tradeskiller B also thinks 150 plat is a fair price, but he notices Tradeskiller A is also selling them for 150 plat, so Tradeskiller B charges 140 plat instead so he can monopolize the market.<br>
4) Things go downhill from there.<br>
<br>
I am not at all talking about price fixing, or somehow rigging the economy, or anything.  All I'm saying is that when tradeskillers start charging <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> less</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> than what they themselves think is the <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> fair</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> price, <!--EZCODE UNDERLINE START--><u>only</u><!--EZCODE UNDERLINE END--> so they can get a larger market share than someone else, it fucks up the tradeskill economy.<br>
<br>
And it doesn't benefit the server because people who enjoy tradeskills, the people who would actually enjoy GMing their skill and selling crap to you, can't get there because they can't fund their advancement through the sale of their goods because some ridiculous price war is going on.<br>
<br>
I'm not talking about people getting their ass kicked for charging 1000% profit so they can spend the money they got for GMing smithing first on velium swiftblades and ToV loot.  I'm talking about people who are trying to be professional tradeskillers being forced to adventure instead because the market is fucked to all hell by some ass trying to horde all the sales to him/herself.<br>
<br>
If Jarkell is selling a 100 plat cost item for 2,500 plat, and someone else comes along and charges 200 plat instead, more power to them.  Thank God.  Etc!<br>
<br>
But if someone is selling a 100 plat cost item for 120 plat, and some prick comes along and charges 110 plat instead so they can get all the sales (when they wouldn't have done so otherwise) they suck <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :p --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":p"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

You got it punk!</span><hr size=1> Just to jump in on pottery, since this is a pet peive of mine.<br>
<br>
1)  Golden Tunare Idols, currently selling at 1500pp.  Average inter server price... 3kpp.  Admittedly the average inter server price on Iron Oxides is 1kpp, and the few potters on this server have kept that down, thus lowering prices.  None the less, the total cost of the PotC items on Firiona Vie from potters is noticeably less than the price elsewhere.<br>
<br>
2)  Opal Steins.  Yeah, they cost about 40-50pp to make.  They save the buyer 1kpp and more.  And yet people whine that 250pp is too much?  Excuse me?  Potter makes 200pp, you make thousands, and yer whining about that?  I mean, I use one Opal Stein (with my other gear I can soft cap Charisma with just one) and it saves me 200pp every time I purchase a new load of Star Rubys for tradeskilling.  200pp per purchase.  That one Opal Stein has saved me thousands of platinum in pottery goods alone (the savings everytime I buy the two stacks of saphires necessary to work on gate stones is enourmous).  If I had bought that item, as a dropped item, for 1kpp, thus giving the seller 1kpp, I still would have come out way ahead.  I certainly don't begrudge the tinker that charged me 1600pp for my gearlock smithing hammer... sure, she gained maybe 1kpp on the deal, but I saved more than that in not needing to gain the additional 10 skill points.<br>
<br>
Ya see, the way I see it is this.  If I'm tradeskilling away, I could be using that time to hunt.  Maybe killing cyclopses in OOT.  Maybe Sebilis.  Maybe some other place.  I could be gaining both exp and loot.  Thus, for it to be worth my time to tradeskill, I should be able to make more cash per unit time than I could running around looking for a group, finding one, and playing a while... to make up for the fact that I'm not getting exp.  So yeah, I should make decent money at tradeskilling... I'm doing a service, and getting paid for it.  I'm not sure why people think there's some certain amount of profit I have to get when I make the items... I price my items based on usefulness to the buyer.  This means some items I don't make... they just won't pay me enough, if I charge the buyer what it's worth to them.  I don't make Periodot Steins, for example.  <br>
<br>
And don't get me started on the concept that all items MUST be priced at twice their construction cost.  That's downright silly.  I've I'd priced my first Gatestones at twice cost to make, they would have been 16kpp each, and Star Ruby Steins would have been about 3700pp each (my first batch were 7k for 4).  But I knew the items weren't worth that to a buyer, so I didn't charge that much.  As my skill improved, I succeeded more, and the cost for me to make em got better... but that didn't improve or weaken the product in any way.  So Star Ruby Steins started at 2kpp each, because that was the inter server average at the time and it seemed reasonable, even though I made perhaps 250pp per stein sold and risked far more than that.  And gate stones were 10k, also the average at the time.  I didn't think that the Golden Diety Idol inter server average sounded right... they were running at 4kpp to 5kpp, but that just wasn't what I thought buyers should pay, considering the price of a Grodan's and Gorganga Idol.  So I said they were worth 1500pp... even though non Tunare Idols averaged 1350pp each at the time I set that price.  And when I priced Opal Steins... they were selling for 1kpp on other servers.  My skill went up, but I wasn't about to lower my price when I couldn't keep the darn things in stock... I'd make a batch of twenty, sell it out, make a new batch, and go hunting... people would send me tells for the things, and I'd ask them to come to me... and they would.  Tons of them.  And bought out whole batches in a night's hunting.  So yeah, I was selling for 250pp, and it was well worth it, as evidenced by the many people who sent me tells later saying how it had saved them so much money.<br>
<br>
So instead of saying an item should sell for an amount based on the making price, let's talk about what things should sell for based on value to the buyer.  <br>
<br>
Opal Steins:  25 charisma 10 mana.  Most charisma you can get on a primary or secondary item outside NToV and the GM tools.  Without knowing cost to make, what would this cost?  I doubt before the tradeskill patch anyone would have said less than 500pp.  I know that since they sold for 1kpp to enchanters when they first came out... and the enchanters were buying them in droves.  Except on Firiona Vie, were they never cost that much.  Now they sell for 50 to 100pp, though most folks who were making them stopped when the price bottomed out to as little as 25pp each.<br>
<br>
Star Ruby Steins:  20 mana 10 to all saves 5 charisma.  With blue diamond costs skyrocketing, resist gear ain't so cheap.  With two slots you can get 20 to all resists... admittedly these are slots you can put good things in, but that's still great caster resist gear, and helps you get an earing that's amazingly powerful for it's low price.  If that were a dropped item, how much would it sell for?  I know HQ Kodiak Pelts run 500 to 1kpp, and they're a very small part of a decent ring that even after a lot of work isn't as good as the Earing of the Solcetice.  And they don't have any effects in and of themselves.<br>
<br>
Golden Idol of Rallos Zek:  10 ac 9 str 5 sta 20 hp.  Range slot.  Tons of hitpoints for a warrior, plus great AC. What would that run at, if not made by a tradeskill?  Though admittedly these sell out as fast as I can make em, which is slow.<br>
<br>
Gatestones.  Unlimited charges gate to home city.  Pretty darned cool.  Yet I had people jumping me for charging 10k... when the first ones I made cost me as much as 8k each.  Sure, I should have waited to make them later, but I had people saying they wanted em.  So I made em, then had people after me for price gouging.  Ugh.  Took the price down as I skilled up, and still had people saying I was charging too much.  UGH!<br>
<br>
And of course Crucibles.  Damn.  Unlimited charges of evac... if it were a rare dropped item I imagine people would be quite happy.  But these are selling for 395pp each now.  By the way they cost maybe 70pp to make... but require fishing in Sebilis, making a 170 skill fishing combine, a high skill baking combine, farming greenies for a long time in the Gorge of King Xorb, and buying unstackable items in Surefall.  Right, I want to spend a few hours to make that much.  No!  If I'm in Sebilis, I'd rather kill some froggies, thank you much!<br>
<br>
Oh well, just had to get that off my chest.<br>
<br>
But to the original poster... don't kill the prices for everyone just because someone pisses you off.  Just flame the person and be done with it.  You start a huge price war, you hurt all the makers... then the buyers expect those prices always, and everyone leaves the buisiness, and no one's making the items anymore, and it's just pesky.  Just flame to get your aggressions out!<br>
<br>
Besides, I want some Constitutionals on the market.  I haven't seen any!  And all this ranting has made my throat itch.<br>

Look, I don't *want* to start a price war. I agree that it would suck for all tradeskillers involved. We've already nuked the Demi-Sec market (and Azhrei,  your cost-to-create estimate's a little low, closer to 30 [opal and gold bar]). The odd bottle will trickle out at 200, assuming the buyer's motivated enough. I find most of the people who are habitual PotC'ers are looking more at 150. My gripe was that I was trying *not* to screw things up for everyone, and some d00d (a halfling dr00d, amusingly enough) insisted on undercutting whomever had the lowest price. I retaliated last night, and they appeared to not be online when I got on this morning. We'll see how things look when I get home after dinner. In the meantime, I reset my retail price to match the other person selling in the Bazaar at the time, because they deserve to sell their Demi-Sec just as much as I do, and while I <!--EZCODE UNDERLINE START--><u>could</u><!--EZCODE UNDERLINE END--> sell for less to take a bigger marketshare, I would rather just share the market.<br>
<br>
At any rate some responses:<br>
<br>
Dorphen: You don't like the markup? <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> You</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> go spend 9 hours doing a nine-item combine with a non-stackable container, and then you can make your own. My wrists will never be the same again.<br>
<br>
Azhrei: One thing you didn't include was (as Jarkell pointed out) the <!--EZCODE UNDERLINE START--><u>value</u><!--EZCODE UNDERLINE END--> of the item. If I tried to sell a +5 WIS, +5 INT, +5 DEX, +5 AGI belt for 10PP, I would be hunted down and summarily shot by the tradeskill community. Some of these stat beverages are pretty nice. I think the mark-ups, while higher in percentage than JC, are reasonable, given the relatively low cost of the components. I should think that having +6 STR and +6 STA would be worth 10PP to a struggling tank (or even a successful one).<br>
<br>
Kiron: I do have fun -- crafting. Where my enjoyment typically stops is when I walk into the Bazaar and set up for Trader and start eyeballing the other prices to make sure I'm not out-of-line with the market.<br>
<br>
Jarkell: heh, I'm <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> still</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> trying to recover the cost of my corking device. Too bad Demi-Sec doesn't require it, it would eliminate a lot of the competition...People are already asking me when I'm going to go for a Grandmaster Trophy, and I just snickered; I've never seen that much money at once (gem costs).<br>

You got it punk!</span><hr size=1> The idea that Opal steins are selling for 40-50pp on other servers is rubbish. I bought 3 for 22pp each from a vendor called &quot;Steins&quot; (presumably &quot;Steins'R'Us&quot; got rejected) on another server. The vendor had 60 for sale. <br>
<br>
The problem here is that this is an item on the mainline skilling route which does not stack. You either vendor them (a horrible idea) or sell them off cheap to clear space. This should be especially true on FV as we do not have alts to pass them off to. <br>
<br>
On that server I have seen tradeskilled items at less than manufactured cost - eg. Silver ruby veil 100pp. Now that is not an item anyone makes for skilling so unless it was a dropped ruby used casually then I consider such pricing stupid.<br>
<br>
The other issue is how much time you want to spend in the bazaar. I tradeskill partly for enjoyment, and partly for quest-related skills. If I ever make a profit I will be happily surprised. My motivation then, is to get whatever I have made shifted fast and get back out on the hunt or whatever. If I had a second account and a permanent connection then leaving a trader on 24/7 waiting for the &quot;market&quot; price might make sense. If I just filled my bank with something I need to move it fast so I can keep on skilling. <br>
<br>
Motivation varies and profit is not always the reason people do things. One story I treasure on that theme is the woman who sold a Jaguar (car) for £10 - it was her ex-husbands car and she had been directed to &quot;sell it and send him the proceeds&quot; <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> .<br>

I have sub 100 strength and stamina, I get more benefit from a grobb meat milkshake.   And the stein arguement Jarkell always uses, about saving &quot;thousands of platinum&quot;.

Tell me how that is even remotely close to being the same &quot;value&quot; that someone else would get that is using it to buy multiple stacks of velium bars.   The whole point is, value is subjective.  Trying to set your price based upon the absolute pinnacle of value/usage that someone could get out of the item, and forcing everyone that might use the item to pay that price, is unfair and unjustified.

Profit margin takes into account a LOT more than cost to make.  And it should with tradeskills as well.<br>

&quot;Blessed Fishing Pole, cost to make at 200 skill 125 - 500 plat depending if you can forage or not. Time to make: 30-60 minutes if you forage components yourself, 15 minutes if you buy them in Bazaar; priced accordingly as above. Price in bazaar 1500 - 2500 plat.&quot;<br>

1) Time required to get fishing to 200 is very high and has NO other saleable components.<br>
2) You have to be level 46 to get to the Plane of Growth.<br>
3) Getting to the Plane of Growth typically requires passing Wuoshi so you have to work up you Claws of Veeshan faction.  You also have to be able to survive the Plane which means no evils.<br>
4) Getting out if the Plane of Growth requires Gate so the main foraging class requires a Thurgadin gate potion to gather any wood.<br>
5) Typical forage rate on Branch of Planar Oak with a 200 forage skill AND a foragers sickle (don't get me started on ow long and difficult that quest is) is about 2.5 per HOUR of sitting and hitting the forage key every 90 seconds.  That's a lot of fun!<br>
6) Blessed Emeralds can only be obtained from a Tunare worshipping Druid or Cleric.<br>
7) Making Celestial essence is another fairly long trip for non-porting classes.<br>
<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START 8) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/glasses.gif ALT="8)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  Add a trip to Thurgadin for the sacred coldain thread.<br>
9) Dragon Eggs require going to Western Wastes, which requires a trip through Siren's Grotto!<br>
10) Plus a tailoring combine with a trivial of 150, a Brewing combine with a trivial of 150 and a pottery combine with a trivial of 103 (don't forget 5% failure rate regardless of skill).<br>
<br>
Add all that up and you think 1500 is too much?  How about adding in that it is one of the most difficult of the nine items required to make an earring worth over 20,000 pp?<br>
<br>
60 minutes...that's nuts.  I spent 9 hours in PoG getting oak, weeks working up tailoring and fishing, days working up pottery.  And the fact is I STILL can't make poles because I can't get the components I need<br>
<br>
I got mobbed by light blue mobs in crystal Caverns trying to get a bit of velium and died with only a 50% rez.  Where does that factor into your calculations?  I've neer known anyone to die due to jewelcraft except at the very high end.<br>
<br>
So, if you think the mark-ups are too high try walking into a McDonalds and telling them their prices are too high because the cost to make their food is really low.<br>

<br>
Not even close...<br>
For at least 2-3 weeks they selling 16k and under<br>
Prices will continue to drop quickly on them as more people advance tradeskills<br>
<br>
TO get pottery to 103 takes extreme minimal time and pp<br>
<br>
you can run invis to PoG and completely avoid Woushi<br>
<br>
<br>
bah this arguement is none stop back and forth arguement.<br>
I say we just flood market with tradeskill stuff so I can get my Tea cheaper.. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
