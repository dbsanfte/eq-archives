For the past 5 years, I've enjoyed pretty much EVERY new game to come out - including Ultima Ascension - that game worked fine for me where a lot of others had problems.  EQ looked and ran GREAT on this system when the game first came out.<br>
<br>
I need to buy a new computer now.  I paid around $3000 for my system from Gateway.  I will NEVER, EVER again buy a PC from a major mail order company like Gateway or Dell, and I will NEVER, EVER buy a PC in a store, like Best Buy or Fry's Electronics.<br>
<br>
I have found a place where you can basically put together a computer yourself, have it assembled for you, shipped to you, and working right out of the box.  <br>
<br>
www.pricewatch.com - go there and check it out.  <br>
<br>
I created this system on pricewatch for appx. $1000 even, with shipping and tax:<br>
<br>
Athlon XP 1600 Ghz (More than enough processor)<br>
512 MB of RAM <br>
40GB, 7200 speed hard drive<br>
CD RW drive<br>
DVD drive<br>
64MB GeForce graphics card (forget if it is 2 or 3)<br>
Latest incarnation of the SB card, forget which.<br>
<br>
Try pricing that at Best Buy or Gateway computers or Fry's Electronics or anywhere else.  Pricewatch.com is, BY FAR, the best place to buy a pre-assembled PC - i.e., one you don't have to put together yourself.  Even for my &quot;hardware oriented&quot; friends, that like putting together their own systems, haven't found a way to beat this price EVEN JUST GOING FROM PARTS!<br>
<br>
The motherboard and RAM are top notch,  all components are known name brands w/ warrenty (Toshiba, etc.) - plus the warrenty that the individual merchant gives you.  Pricewatch.com is basically a place where all small computer manufacturers &quot;compete&quot; and try to get you the best price.<br>
<br>
Try it.  DON'T PAY TWICE WHAT YOU HAVE TO! <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

<br>
Quality of service from the various vendors could vary wildly.<br>
<br>
One tip - If you're going with an Athlon, be sure to get DDR memory and a good motherboard/chipset that support it.<br>
<br>
Right now, the current &quot;best&quot; chipset for Athlon is the Via KT266A.  Make sure it has that 'A' at the end as the KT266 is not nearly as good as the KT266A.<br>
<br>
Oh yea one last thing, steer clear of any 7000 rpm cpu fans, those things are WAY TOO LOUD!  sounds like a hair dryer running constantly.<br>

It's really only useful as a directory to find good prices on individual components... you still have to assemble them all or have somebody else do so.  If you're not comfortable with the idea of making your computer yourself, and don't have any friends you trust with the task, and don't want to buy from a big computer manufacturer, find a &quot;mom and pop&quot; place in your area.  Give them your specs and ask if they can do it and what their price will be.  Might want to shop around a bit that way.<br>
<br>
Also, the Athlon XP 1600+ isn't 1600 GHz... &quot;1600&quot; is a model number... which may be rather deceptive, but it might be considered fair since it does outperform the competition's 1600 MHz processors (MHz, not GHz... nobody has a 1600 GHz processor yet.) ;)  The Athlon XP 1600+ actually runs at 1400 MHz, but it's still fast, and from what I can tell it's probably the best price/performance deal at the higher end as far as processors go.<br>
<br>
Also, pay attention to what kind of graphics card you're getting.  The difference in performance between a GeForce2 MX and a GeForce 3 TI500 is going to be pretty huge, even if they have the same amount of memory.  Memory size on video cards doesn't matter as much as the muscle of the card's processor and the MEMORY BANDWIDTH of the card.  Shoot for at least a GeForce2 GTS... preferably a GeForce2 Pro, GeForce2 TI, or a GeForce2 Ultra.  The best price/performance card right now SEEMs to be the OEM ATI RADEON 8500 which is selling at some places for under $200 with excellent antialiasing (to make the games look prettier) with performance that is competitive with NVIDIA's $300 offering, but many people shy away from ATI graphics cards because of ATI has a poor track record when it comes to drivers, something you are probably definitely going to want to avoid, given the fact that people are having problems with the new DX8 engine in EQ even with &quot;proven&quot; GeForce cards. <p><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS">--Tukka</FONT></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#FFFFFF><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/usmallcutepuppy.showPublicProfile?language=EN>smallcutepuppy</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 13<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(11/30/01 5:34:43 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> pricewatch</span><hr size=1> I tried shopping for ram on Pricewatch, and of the two companies I checked out, both of them used freaking YAHOO billpay to conduct their transactions. Now I'm all for helping the little guy, but if your company is so shady it has to use a free service to accept payments... eh. If I want to do that, I'd much rather buy from some guy on eBay (since at least there you can see the user rating so you have some idea if he's legit or scum). Pricewatch is really only good for just that - checking the going rates for equipment so you can get a ballpark figure in your head.<br>
<br>
Actually, eBay isn't a bad place to look for components if you want to build your own machine. Just make sure the seller has a good rating. I bought my last machine (monitor and all) from eBay as a package deal from some guy who'd gone in the Army or something and couldn't use it anymore. Just about $900 for an Athlon 800, pretty well loaded, last year, wasn't a bad deal at all.<br>
<br>
If you want to get a pre-made system, Gateway really isn't that bad in my experience. When I was working tech support in college, Gateways were always the easiest computers to upgrade for people. Then again, that was several years ago. My sister just bought a decent Dell package for $900. Though, we shall see how robust it is when I try to install her CD-RW drive for her at Christmas. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  Best Buy is ok as long as you know exactly what you want. Don't let them sucker you into one of their huge $2000 package deals. And don't get a Compaq or HP; BBY loves to try and sell you Compaq and HP.<br>
<br>
Bottom line, don't pay much more than $1000 for any machine (including the monitor). If you pay more than that, you're just screwing yourself financially since that &quot;uber&quot; top-of-the-line stuff you just paid $2000 for will be upgradeable on a $1k machine for about $200 in pretty short order. It's like buying a car, starts depreciating the minute you drive it off the lot. $1000 seems to be the magic number to get a nice solid system for a fair price.<br>
<br>
(Ended up getting the ram at crucial.com, incidentally. It's a little more expensive than the prices you'll see on pricewatch (like, about $5 more for a 256MB dimm) but, they offer FREE 2 Day FedEx with your order.) <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#FFFFFF><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon3.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ujazzun.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Jazzun</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 52<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(11/30/01 5:44:56 pm)</font><br>     <br>Community Supporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: pricewatch</span><hr size=1> Some good links to go to for getting puters:<br>

<br>
I've never had a problem dealing with them, the companies provide their own warrenties, etc.<br>
<br>
If you prefer, sure, go to gateway.com or Frys Electronics or something like that and pay twice as much. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

<br>

<br>
Oh, for the Gateway lovers - I have a gateway now.  I'd be wary - there is talk of them going out of business.  Talk to someone who watches the market - they just closed down all their international offices.  NO PLACE is completely 100% safe in this economy. <br>
