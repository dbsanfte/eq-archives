I just happened to luck out when I found it there) I try explaining to her this concept, but then I suggest perhaps English isn't her first language (politely, hoping it was Spanish, because I can speak that), she tells me she's Chinese. Ok. So now we have a real-life language barrier, but it's only made worse by her interrogation-style questioning. Finally, I give up and suggest she check in some stores- maybe near the bank.

If in the definition of ones character begging is is distasteful, but dueling is an honorable alternative, how is someone &quot;pushed&quot; into insulting anyone?  I think this is a decent alternative to giving equipment away to every Tom, Dick, and Harry that decides to reroll a character and doesn't want to work to get equipment.  Everyone is supposed to be a roleplayer here.  Is your character defined as a beggar?  Mine isn't either.<br><br>Once in a while, I will help someone if they ask politely, and have a real need ( corpse recovery).  If they are a level 1 or 2 and start hitting me with emotes because I just dropped everything off at the bank, I figure they deserve to be reported.<br><br>Now that I have stated my opinion succinctly and to the point, let the flaming begin.<br><br>What's wrong with roleplaying?  Personally, I don't like begging, EQ or any other game.  I work for a long time to build a character to what it is.  If someone wants to raid CT at level 4, let em.  Just don't expect me to give you my armor to do it.  Take your time, let your character learn.  You may know the rules, but your character doesn't.  Take things in order.  You will garner more respect from your fellow players. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/upiersplowman.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Piers Plowman</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 27<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(3/10/02 4:09:15 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=454.topic&index=16>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Newbie duelling</span><hr size=1> I think because FV is supposed to be a role-playing server, as long as the guy was abusing you in character (much like your responses) that I wouldn't report him.<br><br>But his obvious modern-day unimaginative cursing begs to be corrected in one way or another.<br><br>/applaud Thrad <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/uheagan.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Heagan</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 151<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(3/10/02 6:04:23 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=454.topic&index=17>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Newbie duelling</span><hr size=1> &quot;..deserve to be reported.&quot;<br><br>god. the guides and gms are not there to be your gd kindergaten teachers people. you are an absolute waste of their time, petitioning this kind of stuff.<br><br>you don't like being called names? well I'll tell you, most 12 year olds are good at at least one thing, calling them as they see them. if you can't take the heat get out of the kitchen.<br><br>look at petitioning or reporting as 'dialing 911'. your character fell thru the world for 10 k damage? petition! get your stuff back! don't waste the guides time with this garbage, because someone on another part of the planet HAS a real problem and doesn't want to wait 3 GD HOURS while they settle out your tattle tailing, stupid bs.<br><br>i can't BELIEVE that you people can't see how much valuable time and oxygen you're wasting.<br><br>ugh. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/uheagan.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Heagan</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 152<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(3/10/02 6:06:37 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=454.topic&index=18>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Newbie duelling</span><hr size=1> ' I ' think they should SUSPEND peoples' accounts who waste gm or guide time with ignorant crap like this.<br><br>that would make you petty whiners think twice, or go away. either is preferable. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon3.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/umelmell.showPublicProfile?language=EN>melmell</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.theorderofthedragon.com/docs/fanart/cross.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>A_Idiot_666</span><br>  Posts: 256<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(3/10/02 7:26:59 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=454.topic&index=19>Reply</a>    <br>Community Supporter<br> <BR><img src=http://imagem.webphotos.iwon.com/1000032078/1000032078_225200284817PM0.1818354.jpg height=200 width=106></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Another thing...</span><hr size=1> Quit bashing 12 year olds.
