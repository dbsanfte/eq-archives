The knight flicks a casual glance at the order form as the Tier'Dal woman gleefully checks off an item listed thereon. That smile of his deepens, then, reaching dark eyes with a dance of glittering mischief. <br>
<br>
Bending down to Poyson's ear, the rakishly attired nobleman murmurs in velvety tones, &quot;Methinks, lass, you ought reconsider rendering such, shall we say, ill-considered opinions to sweet ingenue...lest a jaded knight subject your arse to the very same treatment you might have contemplated visiting upon yon prospective slave.&quot;<br>
<br>
Parting his lips in a charming smile, the fay man then moves around Poyson, presenting the young shaman with a courtly, if measured, bow. &quot;Pray lend not ear to the mellifluous words of the lady, I do urge, for verily, they might all too easily entangle the unwary in their pernicious web. Rather, I proffer myself and aught I might lend of aid and advice to you, lass; let the breeze carry your words to my ear, and lo and behold, Goddess willing, I shall be there.&quot;<br>

A little unusual for one of my kind, I know, but one I treasure dearly.As of now I am your season, and I would enjoy a good hunt, as well as some casual conversation.

The back and forth between the two elves confuses and intrigues her -- she hasn't yet met anyone from their races and rather than become alarmed, she has become curious. Neriak sounds exotic and dangerous, but she picks up a hint of menace from the dark elf -- maybe not enough to keep herself out of trouble, but menace nonetheless. She wonders what it is like to keep company with the blue-skinned folk. <br>
<br>
The elf-knight, however, sets her to blushing. She catches herself tugging at her kilt a bit, and puts a stop to it right away. <br>
<br>
&quot;Th'elf talks like a poet,&quot; she says, giggling. She blushes, then exchanges the blush for her best fierce look. <br>
<br>
As for the Vah Shir, well, she takes an immediate liking to him. She thinks his slow, deliberate movements are fascinating, and that he is a shaman like she is doubly so. She looks forward to adventuring with him some day.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showUserPublicProfile?gid=ennisserarianrod>Ennisser Arianrod</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#A62A2A>(8/7/03 12:01 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm42.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=324.topic&index=6>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> An invitation for a tea.</span><hr size=1> A tall Elf enters the inn.

As the shamaness turns around, the Elf notices she was wrong. &quot;I do apologize&quot;- she bows- &quot;I was sure it was my dear friend whom I haven't seen for too long now. You remind her- she is a shawoman and loves winter as I am sure you do. Ah, where are my manners! I haven't introduced myself.

<br>
&quot;Another day, another Poyson victim. But wait!!!... maybe I should bring the young one for Kelrya...&quot;<br>

She fixes the pleats in her kilt, tosses her warhammer up on one very unbarbarian-like thin shoulder, and smiles. <br>
<br>
&quot;I'm of thirteen seasons now,&quot; she says, pushing an oversized helmet out of her eyes. It looks like it was built for an ogre, or at least an iksar, head. This underfed Halaswoman has no business wearing it, but she knows that, and she relishes it. There is, however, a bruise on her nose where it banged her face last week. She has covered it up, mostly, with woad. &quot;Still lookin' fer company. Still like cat-folk. Met a decent 'nuff lizard-feller a day ago, too, and my Pep said the lizard-folk'd sooner eat me'n talk to me.&quot; <br>

She shrugs. <br>
<br>
&quot;Reckon he thought we had somethin' in common, I guess. Talkin to spirits and 'splorin a strange place. I like strange places, y'know?&quot; <br>
<br>
With that, her helmet falls again into her eyes, setting off a chain reaction of her hammer slipping from her shoulder and banging on the floor and her shield thumping into a nearby barstool as she tries to right herself. <br>
<br>
