The game is well over 3 years old. The fundamentals are not going to change with the release of an expansion. <br>
<br>
PoP may introduce some new situations, some of which may require that players adapt to new settings/environments... but new tactics? Hmm.<br>
<br>
And while there are a few classes that do require a certain amount of skill to play, and there are also situations that can be resolved via the use of efficient tactics, the game does not require either of these for survival nearly so much as it requires good equipment. <br>
<br>
Small well-equiped groups who use &quot;tactics&quot; may be able to accomplish a great deal, but small poorly-equiped groups who use tactics? Serve as lunch more often than not.<br>

Another thing they could do would be to make some creatures less effected by taunt and more thoughtful about their targets.

<br>
Break class domination:<br>
<br>
Basically Luclin introduced factors like Curses to throw in some spice.<br>
<br>
If PoP is to be about tactics it needs to :<br>
<br>
Have 1-6 person encounters, 6-12 person encounters, 24 person encounters like Air (no rent key, but make a way of exchanging keys)<br>
<br>
Have a raid where you have 4 portals, each portal will take one group with a key then port them, each groups fights down a preset dungeon type raid useing Crawling tactics - then each 4 area's merge into big 2-4 group big raid.<br>
<br>
Or mix each portal for a type of style - make one portal only for fighters (no healers) make it so they fight creatures they can take down and drop no-rent healing/mana items (aka fungus grove) And each type of platform would be for a set class - fight down and at end of that section it all groups meet up and merge etc etc.<br>
<br>
You could add in creatures that when you cast a spell it bounces the spell back on the caster - ie ice comet the mob - you get ice comet back.... Vary the way mobs are killed.<br>
<br>
You could really mean things like make pets that attack the mob turn on there master! *grins at beastmasters* or any number of wierd things.<br>

Clerics heals warrior, Cleric then DA's, Zones out or dies and this is with a lvl 55+ party against a lvl 52 mob! No taunt = why bother having a warrior. Warriors at the high end have the lowest DPS besides bards of all the melee and with the AC soft cap we have no advantages besides a few more HPs than SKs or Paladins who both can chain cast spells to ensure they hold aggro and besides that taunt doesn't work all that well in the first place.

Tactics have always been and always will be an important part of EQ. Reso went from having KT waltzing thorugh their raid force hap-hazderly to finally executing a pinning strategy. In the past,  the RIGHT strategy, well implemented can always reduce the number of resources you need to succeed at an encounter (some folks in FnF proved that to each other late last nite). I want to define &quot;right strategy&quot; as the strategy that is best suited for your guild. Not just a strat gleamed off a board that uber guild 001 said worked for them. You say you took 42 people to Zlandicar and executed your strat flawlessly. I have no doubt you did. But was it the right strat for your raid force composition at that time? I would say no if you almost lost.<br>
<br>
/Nod to rollen, of course equipment if a huge factor. Equipment / gear / loot or whatever you want to call it is the driving force behind EQ. I dont care if your 20th level or 60th level. Gear is a nessacary part of the game if you wish to play in the high end encounters. <p>Kzan Verto<BR>

Warriors<br>
Bards<br>
SK<br>
Pal<br>
<br>
Thats how the list is for melees.<br>
Warriors also have a FAR higher defensive skill set than any other class now.  Just because there is a AC softcap doesn't mean that 1100 ac on a warrior is the same as 1100ac on a SK or a ranger or a wizard. <br>
<br>
Oh and to aviod hijacking..<br>
<br>
Encounters are all basically the same now, ever since well this game came out. Best tank gets and holds agro everyone else assists and blows up while keeping him alive. There is no strategy in this game, if you think there is, you havn't been playing long enough. Tell me any kind of &quot;strat&quot; that doesn't involve CH rotations or mob positioning; those are the only 2 things that matter. <br>
<br>
So please don't go around telling people you have strategies or whatever for different encounters, you dont have jack shit but better execution of the above 2 things; nothing more, nothing less.<br>

To me, the hardest part of the game is organization and motivation.  Getting people to a raid and keeping them motivated to do what's necessary to level up, gear up, and be able to get to the next encounter.  The ability to count to 4 and press a hotkey, alternate burns and concussions, or hit autoattack and keep yourself facing a mob isn't exactly brain surgery.  Getting 50 people together, organized, and moving in the same direction and keeping them together is the hard part of this game.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

For example, let's take the traditional crawl down to the royals in Chardok where you basically run down as fast as you can AE'ing everything as you go.  All the MOBs just stand there and wait for you to arrive.  No messages are sent down for reinforcements.  No defenses are prepared.  Sarnaks are pretty dumb, but anything smart enough to build a city should be smart enough to do that.<br>
<br>
It would be nice to see a good &quot;war&quot; zone where your arrival in the zone triggers some fairly smart variable MOB responses to what you do.  Something that isn't 100% scripted and certain; those are fun for the first few times, but after that it just becomes rote again.<br>
<br>
Even XP'ing in such a zone should have harzards like that.  What if a roaming guard missing his check-in?  Perhaps a group of guards is dispatched to check up on him.  Things like that. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ucoinfist.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Coinfist</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 248<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(10/12/02 3:24:40 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1522.topic&index=21>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Hmm, it would be fun if ..</span><hr size=1> First mages control where mana goes, no more mana to overnuking casters. They have to pace themselves. Secondly its 1 time per minute so now they have to just rotate the casters and make sure they dont have a rod on them. This will help with the boring rod rotation on the ground and add a boring tracking of mods and who has them.<br>
<br>
In the past some successes were based on many mods being on the ground and available. But now the fights will be shorter so less overall mana is needed thus less mod rods (if they were still available) and a shorter intense fight.<br>
<br>
Dubing the phrase &quot;Either you have it or you dont&quot;. Meaning encounters now will be based on if you can do them or not and you will know after a very short time.<br>
<br>
Wizards manaburn is a great tool and this nerf only says they cant use them in conjunction at the same time. They can still use them but now they cant kill a kunark dragon who has 32k with 6 roaming wizards. Now they MB and the dragon eats them 1 at a time. <br>
<br>
MB was nothing used by big guilds really. <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>  Edit: Removed strat information.</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
I see more of a problem with them taking away MC3 but if they fix SCM as they promised this can be overcome. MC3 for those who dont know increases your inate mana regen by something like 12 points at level 3. SCM3 will reduce mana cost by 30percent if a successful roll (maybe they will make it guaranteed). So fixing SCM and maybe making it guaranteed equals 30 percent more mana when the bar is full or close to it.<br>
<br>
Cleric 7500 hp CH is nothing of a big deal either. They said this would allow them to include or allow for upgrades in the healing to this class. Imagine if you will that i have 8k hps. How often would you see me at less than 500hps on a mob that is known to hit for 1100+ per strike? Not often and even with a 10k heal this would save me if he riposted or even got another swing in. More dynamic and useful heals are coming to clerics and this will allow for more creative healing.<br>
<br>
At 7500 this will still fill up the tanks for another month and half if they were at 1 hp. When we hit VT well have more 8k tanks and by then the higher heals will be available.<br>
<br>
Monks. The only thing happening here is they are reducing the benifit to the AC + all other monkly skills. They might as well gave you all a sword + plate armor.. This is just rebalancing plate wearing classes to the front of the damage absorbsion table, nothing more and in any roleplay world an armor wearing character always take more damage than a non armor wearing one. Maybe except the Japanese Animations of Kung Fu. /shrug. There is no reason a monk cant survive pulls now. Why? cause they are fleeing and ac doesnt account from the rear only from the front so there is really no change in this aspect. The only change is you cant stand up to a mob and get beat on better than someone decked in steel protection.<br>
<br>
Perhaps raising the ability to dodge by 5 or 10 would make it better. Though i dont think your skills should be full effect if you are fleeing. You cant see them swinging how can you dodge it. Here is how I veiw a monk can be. On my old server we had a monk (guildleader) who was able to pull Ikatiar / Eashan and Roy SOLO before Luclin came out . He had perhaps 500 less hps than our lowest monk. Its all about creativity.. Not just 100khps and knowing you can run and take a 1 min break come back and still alive. There is no challenge in that.<br>
<br>
Im not advocating the changes in thier entiretly but i am saying there is nothing evident here that will change our raids. Raids will be shorter , less stressful and less time consuming. All mobs on luclin (bosses) will be expected to be reduced hps for the encounter so the time will be shorter but the mana will be similar for that short duration. <br>
<br>
Example.. Cleric uses 8k of mana for a Rhag2 fight now.. They will use 4k for a Rhag2 fight after implement and the fight will be half as long. AL who will take 15 min to kill will now take 7ish and instead of say 16k of mana will only take 8k.. this is 2 full bars of mana. Its all about scaling nothing more.<br>

+1 mana regen for MC3.  Cost 6 AA.<br>

That's right, getting an additional +2 mana regen over MC1 costs a whopping 10 points.<br>
<br>
Just to put it in perspective, the Improved Familiar AA ability for wizards grants +6 mana regen (+2 more than our level 60 spell greater familiar), increases our resists, and lowers our fizzle rate for only 9 points.  If Manaburn didn't require MC3 as a prerequisite, most wizards wouldn't go past MC2.  That last +1 mana every 6 seconds simply isn't worth 6 AA. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/umykarfv.showPublicProfile?language=EN>MykarFV</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 1<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(10/12/02 2:38:47 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1522.topic&index=23>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_question_mark.gif" align=absmiddle>  need even more clerics</span><hr size=1> Let's just throw out a hypothetical ...<br>
<br>
A zone that is locked with a maximum of 12 players - I don't know if that can be done, but assume it can.<br>
<br>
... if some rumors are true - that certain encounters / mobs will be limited in the number of players that can be involved - then simply adding more clerics to the CHeal rotation would have to be done at the expense of other classes.<br>
<br>
Wouldn't such a limitation require at least a slight increase in skill and strategy, assuming the players were appropriate levels for the encounter?<br>
<br>
What if the mechanics of the gain cause all buffs to drop on zone-in, such that the only buffs you've got on when you're in-zone are those that come from the players you've brought with you? ie. no buying KEI in bazaar or something similar, or putting extra guildies outside the zone to help with buffing ...<br>
