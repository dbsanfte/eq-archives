I can see how this could be a problem in an an area/zone where i might cause mistargets or agro problems and the like.  However, I see no problem with myself going afk in a safe area (non-kos to frogs still) and raising my swim skill while i wait for the spot to open. <br><br>I dunno, maybe my avatar was causing a huge problem while i was AFK, running rampant through their group etc.  Anyone offer any opinions on the matter either way?<br><br> <p><a href=http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=308109><img src=http://www.sdmesa.sdccd.net/~msoho/froscheto_sig.jpg border=0></img></a></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/utzarothfv.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Tzaroth FV</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 67<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(8/12/02 1:42:57 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1184.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: So...is &quot;camp crowding&quot; really an issue?</span><hr size=1> Well, as you probably know (since you put apostophes on either side of the word: their), it isn't really their place to begin with.

I suppose they could just ignore him and then accept his apology when he KSd the next AC pop. Not saying he would have done that, only that I can understand the lack of trust. EQ is a game of camping. Nearly every item and quest in the game has one or more camps associated with it. Nearly every exp grind has a camp associated with it. VI doesn't recognize the camps they made because they don't want to police them. It's just so much easier to tell your customers they're not using the product correctly than it is to fix the problem. Would be nice if VI would borrow a page from DAoC or even AO in regards to item/quest item drops. I have heard that the next expansion will borrow some from AO. Anyway until VI protects us from each other I guess we should just respect each other. <p><CENTER><TABLE WIDTH=425 CELLPADDING=0 CELLSPACING=0 BORDER=0><TR><TD ALIGN=CENTER COLSPAN=2><IMG SRC="http://eqmasques.homestead.com/files/zarsiss2.jpg"></TD></TR><TR><TD ALIGN=left><FONT SIZE=2 FACE=verdana>a <a href="http://pub5.ezboard.com/bdreadstorm" target="_new">Dreadstorm</a> monk</FONT></TD><TD ALIGN=RIGHT><FONT SIZE=2 FACE=verdana>my <a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=49821" target="_new">Magelo</a> profile</FONT></TD></TR></TABLE></CENTER></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/uinspirationdivine.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Inspiration Divine</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 2<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(8/12/02 8:59:01 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1184.topic&index=8>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: So...is &quot;camp crowding&quot; really an issue?</span><hr size=1> IMO, yes, camp crowding is extremely rude. It was one of the things we thought we had left behind on our old server. Go figure.<br><br>1) Did we ask him to leave ? Yes.  Politely. Several times. His reply ? I will stay until you die or leave.<br><br>2) Yes, we were camping gear for our monk. There are plenty of places where the experience is much better as you don't have such horrid downtime and unknown spawns.<br><br>3) Was the KS &quot;accidental&quot; ? In no way shape or form could it have been accidental. He stood behind us, watching us pull them only to have him nuke it WHILE I was tanking it. Accidental ? Hardly. An &quot;out of control situation&quot; it was clearly not. I was over 80 % health, our rogue was behind it, and a monk nearby to help with melee should I be in danger. <br><br>4) Was this the first occurrence? No. Previously, as I was tanking (weak shaman, working on much needed defense skill ups, so it was taking a bit longer to kill) he pulled one, rooted it, lev'd over water (which, to my knowledge is a known exploit) and killed it.<br><br>5) Yes, he did swim and apparently got his swimming to 158  . (Only mentioned it because mine is barely topping 100 <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :( --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/frown.gif ALT=":("><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   )<br>Yes, Shohgun did use words that I would not have used. However, what our Pizza-named friend failed to mention is that, at some point, he logged off, found our guild web page, looked up Shohgun's email and other personal information, logged back on, and was taunting him with it. Yes, public information, I know, but it was still creepy. <br><br>6) What he also failed to mention is that I spoke with him at length. I wanted to know why he was such a condescending dork, to be honest. I found out that &quot;I don't group&quot; (his exact words, so any chance of him joining us were out) due to &quot;power level reasons&quot; and that &quot;wizards aren't really wanted in groups.&quot; I mentioned that the folks that didn't want wizards, usually aren't aware of their high damage. With his extensive knowledge of the game, apparently there is no place in EQ that he can gate to, solo, and get decent experience at his level. <br><br>7) His AFK tag was on, but he was rarely AFK, judging by the constant remarks and running in and out of the water. <br><br>Do not take us for fools, Froscheto. I understand that &quot;camps&quot; aren't respected by VI, but I do know that for most mature players, they are respected by players. One mob take, after it was obvious we were in your &quot;secret place&quot; shame on me. One KS, shame on me too. Can't blame us for being a little touchy. <br><br>You are an arrogant little gnat, and I'm so glad you felt the need to make this public. Just so you know, we'll leave your &quot;little spot&quot; alone in the future. After a very long stretch with no drops, we decided we'd do better &quot;grouping&quot; in a much better experience place that drops better loot than gator meat and buy the damned things.

I am the type of person, who gets lost in Qeynos, let alone any other zone.  I hate wandering around looking for x location (bank, zoneline,whatever)for 45 minutes, so now I ask.  Most of the times that I've approached people, (at camping spots/whatever) I've come to ask for some form of directions.  It's not uncommon that I get answers such as: &quot;beat it&quot; &quot;get lost&quot; &quot;MINE!!&quot; (there's not even a mob around..) when I come remotely near them.  It puts me in a bad mood to say the least.  I try to rationalize it by thinking that maybe they've been KS'd recently, and still in a foul mood/paranoid it will happen again.  <br>As for myself, I really don't mind when people hang out when I am camping something.  Most of the time it's soloers who just want a safe place to sit around and med up/whatnot.  If they are waiting for the same spawn, then we need to work something out.  However, I have had people hang around, as soon as the mob pops, their all over it.     So, I've had my share of considerate people/KSers at camps.  My attitude now?  I still don't mind people hanging out around me.  If you really need to KS me..then go ahead, I hope it was worth it to you.

Once I got to the spawn I didn't really feel like leaving and having to walk back again so I just worked on swimming instead of going elsewhere or logging (eventually maxing it out, going from 48 to 165)<br><br>b) While it may sound a bit silly, even to me, I do consider erudites to be in their nature a bit uppity and/or arrogant and that comes out both on purpose, as roleplay, and through my own personality.<br><br>c) As for 'powerleveling' ?  well, that's what i call getting 3/4 of a blue for every solo kill of a croc i get (as opposed to the 1/4 of a blue, or much less, I am used to in groups).  <br><br>why did i get all condescending in the first place?  because I was being peppered with insults and felt some need to defend myself.  I only aggro on other people if they piss me off, albeit not very difficult after a very long day and it being so late in the evening, and Shohgun did as much.<br><br>How am i AFK and still swimming around (jumping in and out of water when i get near enough to the edge)?  Easy, just jump in the water, look up, press forward and left, click on the text entry box, let go of forward and left, then I am stuck in a movement (in this case small circles forward and left on and on ad nauseaum).<br><br><br> <p><a href=http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=308109><img src=http://www.sdmesa.sdccd.net/~msoho/froscheto_sig.jpg border=0></img></a></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/udalninilvenorsh.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Dalninil Venorsh</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 95<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(8/12/02 10:14:18 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1184.topic&index=12>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: just trying to clear small things up</span><hr size=1> hmmm wizard sitting at an out of the way rare camp, that has already shown he could ks the group.

Even if you hadn't KS'd one previously I would have been nervous.  I personally hate seeing a wizard(Or any other class that is capable of KSing me) hang around a camp I'm at where a rare mob pops.  I've had many instances where I've taken the time to clear the camp, adjust the spawn rates to a manageable timeframe, the named pops, and another character engages it.  Technically it's not a KS.  Camping is not recognized by Verant and if the other charcter used a faster casting spell or an arrow he/she got aggro first.<br><br>Please realize that the reason camping is not recognized by Verant is because it would be a giant pain in the ass to police.  It would be almost impossible to judge in some circumstances who had the camp first?  Were they holding the entire camp? etc...  There are too many variables and the GM's have alot better things to do than solve disputes about Derv1.<br><br>Froscheto you were wrong by hanging around a camp running and swimming around in circles AFK.

When I find them camped I will give the person(s) a tell and ask them if they intend staying there for a while or if they want company?

We had this happen last time we were camping the Efreeti in Sol B. A higher level necro sat and was watching us. Now, the necro was very polite, kind, didn't bother us at all. Buffed us a little, fine. But there was a whole lot of tension in /group chat. So... is this person gonna try and KS us or what? I really doubt the necro would have, and the Efreeti never popped, so we will never know, but just by being there, staring, watching... almost as if we were being &quot;judged&quot; as to whether or not we can handle the camp... that made a camp that was fun into a rather tense experience. <p><font face="Tahoma" color="#5151CC"><b>Wikkin Osirus</b></font><br><font face="Tahoma" color="#990099">Officer of <b>Tribulation</b></font><br><font  face="Tahoma" color="#CC5151"><b>Apprentice</b> of the Eleventh Circle</font><br><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=181046"><font face="Tahoma" size=1>Registered on Magelo</font></a><br><a href="http://www.tribulationguild.com"><font face="Tahoma" size=1>Tribulation Web Site</font></a></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ugrolshkammasutra.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Grolsh Kammasutra</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 14<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(8/12/02 4:30:00 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1184.topic&index=18>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_supermad.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: Froscheto?</span><hr size=1> I was the monk, I saw him pull and ks a mob, then say his bad he didnt see us, but was going to log and come back in like 6 hours. He shows up in two hours instead and  procedes to KS us again.  I did turn on my log after the second KS because I figured sure as hell if the AC did actually spawn he was gonna nuke it and go for the KS. It didnt in the 8 hours we were on 6 of which he was AFK &quot;swimming&quot;. He invokes PNP, well it may be different on this server but on my old one extending a duel was a fair way to determine who had the camp. Our lowest character a 27 rogue to his 31 wiz extends the duel, he declines it.  He then later claimed he was not trying to invoke PNP.  We ask him why he is here very politely, he comes back rudely, and then claims that he is RPing a haughty incompasionate Euridite( I love that about this server, you can be a jerk to whoever you want and then just pass it off as RPing). He says he is there for experience it is his number 1 priority.  I ask him why he a wizard of 31 levels would sit here for HOURS when experience is just a port away, I advise him how long we are planning on playing and that a Troll SK who named Soulmarrow who came by politely several hours ago asked if he could have the camp afterwards and we advised him that we would tell him when we were done and hold it for him till he got here.  I then advised that it would probably be several hours before he could thus have the camp.  He replies that he doesnt want to go anywhere else becauee no one will group with him, implying that he has agro problems, and stating that he goes afk a lot for long periods and doesnt like to give notice. (well duh who wants to group with that)  He then snidley replies that he is working on his swimming skill and this is as good a place as any to do that.  After he has been swimming for a couple hours and right before my timer on AC spawn goes off, he summons a familiar and sits on the land stopping his efforts at swimming. Then as yet again saltwater crocs spawn and no AC he goes back to swimming. Yet our genius here claims he can be afk swimming in circles and when only have to stop if he was doing something.  Ya tell me you wouldnt be nervous about this guy hoovering over yer shoulder. <br><br>One of our purposes in doing this camp was to try and get our shaman's defense up the other was to get arms and legs for me.  Because he showed a willingness and ability to KS us in  killing them  this way,  we were no longer able  to have me the monk watch the fights to only jump in if needed to bail out the rogue and the shaman.  Because of his crowding, ksing, and rudeness we had to play protect the spawn from this unseemly individual named after a frozen pizza who not only is a jerk but Roleplays one on EQ.<br><br>Hamiltion<br>34 monk <br>StarSucker and cynic of the nth circle <p><img src="http://web4.facelink.com/edit/raw/rawimage/48/2474648.jpg"> </p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/umadrain.showPublicProfile?language=EN>madrain</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Kerran Lord</span><br>  Posts: 638<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(8/12/02 4:37:35 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1184.topic&index=19>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_supermad.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: Froscheto?</span><hr size=1> /yawn <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ugrolshkammasutra.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Grolsh Kammasutra</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 15<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(8/12/02 4:46:25 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1184.topic&index=20>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_supermad.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: Froscheto?</span><hr size=1> fwiw i would have let this go, just noting him down as another loser not to group with.
