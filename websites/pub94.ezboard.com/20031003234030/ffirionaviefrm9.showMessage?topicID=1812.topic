I'm sitting here this morning, going to go get ready for work and I'm absolutely incredulous about the events that have happened in my life.<br>
<br>
This last year has been a long lesson for me I suppose.  I left my husband with the encouragement of someone who I'll never forget.  I also was able to stay with a friend for a couple months and during this transition time, I quit biting my fingernails and I quit smoking.<br>
<br>
The same person who gave me the strength and who showed me the strenght in myself to want a better future than the apathy and numbess I had, he helped me quit smoking.  I literally cried and he was thousands of miles away from me.  Yet he said &quot;I can't let you smoke&quot; and somehow he was able to help me overcome my cravings just by talking to me, letting me vent, letting me cry and be bitchy and he'd just sit and listen and say &quot;nope you can't smoke&quot;  I'll never forget that.<br>
<br>
At the time my friend let me stay, I was completely bewildered and very scared of so many things.  Leaving my husband and taking steps to become a better person was something that I wasn't able to just jump into.  For six months after I left Canada, I was still scared all the time and still wanting to run back to the comfort of what I had.  I had such a hard struggle, daily struggles in order to make it throgh everyday.<br>
<br>
Along in march I decided to leave my friends house because I contacted my sister and asked if I could come stay with her.  It wasn't my first choice, and it happened after a conversation I had with my friend and I did listen and I knew that in order to change I needed to completely rejuvenate myself.  I wasn't going to do that where I was, it wasn't structured enough for me.  I had to have structure.  Strict structure because I am willful and stubborn.  My sister and her husband could provide that.<br>
<br>
During this time I also cracked.  It wasn't necessarily the fact that anyone in particular was the cause, it was just the fact that everything in my life seemed so out of control and I was so bewildered and I was not myself, but the product of isolation and fears that controlled me.  But I did crack in game no less.  I can say no I don't regret it.  It was part of things that made me stronger.  Yet at the time it hurt alot afterwards, but I did crack and for those that I hurt I am sorry and apologize.<br>
<br>
Well moving back in with my family was very difficult.  My sister and brother in law are strict people with their own ideals and they think I'm perpetually 15.  For those of you who I've talked to on the phone <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :p --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":p"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   yea you know what I'm talking about. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :lol --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/laugh.gif ALT=":lol"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
Yet I needed that.  With effort I was able to get a job back at the company I have worked with before.  Things were looking up.  Until my world crashed.  The guy I loved, and who was going through this transition time, he had his own problems and withdrew from me.  It eventually lead to the separation of him from me.  It hurt.  My strength was gone, I never realized how much I did rely on him.  He was the only true part in my life that was pure.  During all the chaos and all the changes, he was my constant.<br>
<br>
During my first week of training at this new job, I had to go to training with such an incredible sadness.  It was hard not to cry and be sad durign training but I soon became able to enjoy training and meeting people and coming out of my shell.  My sadness was only at home, at night, instead of constantly durign the day.<br>
<br>
I stuck with my job, and I was learning how to smile and have fun and I had made a friend.  My friend and I went out and I drank and bad things happened and it was a huge setback.  All the guilt and shame of my past came hurling back to me and I withdrew and hid in my room for a weekend.  I decided I can't afford to let this hinder my life, and so I changed my work schedule and continued on.<br>
<br>
Soon after I was able to get a car.  I now have a 95 pontiac grand am.  Its the nicest car I've ever owned.  I make payments on it and in December I'll have it paid off.  IMost of my cars have been rez quality vehicles <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :lol --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/laugh.gif ALT=":lol"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   basically old junky cars with high miles and rusted etc etc *bleh*<br>
<br>
Then I contacted the University I had attended back in 2000 and inquired if I was eligible to return.   I was.  Somehow, I was able to receive full financial aid, and be able to return and I applied for a scholarship from my tribe.  I just found out last week I am eligible for a full scholarship.<br>
<br>
So in a couple weeks I will be returning to college.  My summer job is ending, and I have been searching for employment in the town I am moving to.<br>
<br>
I am moving into my very own apartment in a couple weeks.  My whole life I've either lived with someone or been involved in a long term relationship.  I am thankful and excited that I will have my own place for the first time in my life.<br>
<br>
So anyways, I went to the casino where my tribe has it and applied.  They said they'd contact me in 1-2 weeks.  I got a call this morning to come and interview.  The casino hires internally first and very few open positions are avaialble to the public.  I have tribal preference and they were going to help me get my foot in the door.<br>
<br>
So I am sitting here this morning, after typing this long ass post and if any of you actually read this far, well thanks for reading this far *Hugs*, but in the last 6-7 months of my life.  The changes that have happened to me.  The fears, the anger, the bewilderment, the negativity.  All of it is gone or is fading.<br>
<br>
Today I am a completely different person in so many ways.  I am extroverted, happier, I smile alot, I am more confident, more optimistic, I have my priorities in place, I have good habits set, and I am just amazed at how far I have come.<br>
<br>
I want to thank all my friends on FV.  Through the last 2 years of my life here, from the beginning to now, I have met and loved so many people who've touched my life.  Without this community of people, I would have missed out on the most wonderful experience.  You all are awesome.  Without my friends here and without the person who I loved and still do, my life would never be the way it is today.<br>
<br>
I am sorry for any wrong or negative or bad things I might have done, but I am more grateful for the experiences, good and bad, because I wouldn't have found my way back on the path without any of this.<br>
<br>
When people say online stuff isn't real, or its stilly, I disagree.  Without the support of my friends, my online family, being a part of the best community and being a part of something wonderful, I might still be in my apathetic, depressing and negative life with no hope for the future.<br>
<br>
I love ya all.  *big hugs*<br>

Just when you're happy being alone is when you are finally ready for a relationship. Happiness comes from inside yourself, not from anyone else. No one can &quot;make&quot; you happy.

I will also warn you that when you feel low and like things are piling on you, for years you will think of the comfort level of the set place you had with your now former husband.  I left an abusive jerk of a husband 13 years ago and for a long time after, when things were real rough, wondered if it wouldn't have been better if I stayed, the bruises weren't that bad.... I think I finally broke myself of that about 3 or 4 years ago.  But.... I still have a propensity for finding emotionally abusive relationships and am -still- trying to break that.  Don't look for the little scraps of joy, look for the big bussel baskets of it *grin*.<br>
<br>
I'm happy for you!  Keep working on and for you. <p><center><table width="55%"><tr><td align="center">
