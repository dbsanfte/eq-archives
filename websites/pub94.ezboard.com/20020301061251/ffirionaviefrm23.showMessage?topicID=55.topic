Three levels before he could attain his Sure Kill attack, that Dragon Slave.. At the age of 15.. he had already begun to kill the Crocodiles and Caimans that ran along the beach for sport and training.. 18th was looming over his head like a fresh new Goal to attain... then I saw it..<br><br>Twisted remains of some Lightbringer..<br><br>It laid there.. lifeless.. halfeaten.. and discrased.. I just had to..<br><br>I cackled at the broken body, finding it..<br><br>I gave thanks to Innoruuk, for providing me with such a great sight that day.<br><br>Yes, I was a Avid follower of Innoruuk in my Early Youth.<br><br>Amusing.<br>I throught nothing of it. Another weak pale.. dead and tossed to the sands.<br><br>Untill I ran into a Human Monk.. one that saw my Deed.. and he did not take too lightly of it.<br><br>He took a stance and shot a glare towards Shintou.. Did this one want a fight?<br><br>Macel has challenged you to a duel to the death!<br><br>Apparently he did. This was a first.. I could tell that this Monk was below me in levels of power.. Most lightbringers were cowardly.. weak and afraid of combat, less they had a sure victory.<br>This one stood strong before me, he had something to believe in, and he was fighting for something.<br>That was the source of his strenght. For what he lacked in levels of power, he had it in his sprit.<br>Now that I look back on these events, I see. He was an example of 'Good'.<br>I was not one to decline from an challenge, so Naturally, I accepted and we battled..<br>For all of the Strenght in his fists.. I came out slashing. No Mercy.. this foolish Monk wore light armor..<br>So I let my blade dance upon his flesh, and allowed his blood to spill along the sands of the Oasis.<br>My pets fists, bone hard they were, did strike him and assist me as well. Why did I allow the pet to assist me when he was weaker?<br>I do not know.. I do not even remember If I used my Undead assistant against him or not.<br>A Turning point in this battle.. This Monk's fists felt hard as stone. He brused my face from his strong fists and my leather armor was no protection from his striked.<br>And he showed me his Monken Consentration.<br><br>The ability to Heal ones wounds by controling the flesh.<br><br>I saw my Fresh red open slashed that I inflicted upon him close before my very eyes. This monk had offically diped past my hate.. and Into my rage..<br><br>I balled up my freehand.. and allowed my ki to gather around it..<br>And with my Special 'Burning Knuckle' Techinque.. I showed him how much a 'Real' Punch could hurt. I stoke him directly in the Gut.. and from the Ki energy I had used.. his body flew several feet from the strike..<br>I felt his ribs crack against my punch.. his chest went soft against it.. before he went flying backwards..<br><br>His blood flowed freely over his lips as he stuggled to stand up.. but I was not about to let this Monk use his special abilities again...<br>I sent my Reaper of the Dead directly into his neck.. Not the blade..<br>But the wooden end. I had sharpened that end just for this purpose.. I watched him die a painful death.<br><br>His body wanted air.<br><br>I denied him that.<br><br>After removing my weapon from Macel's corspe.. I fell to my knees and gathered myself.<br>That Monk faught a Hard battle. He kicked back harder then I expected.<br>I could of defeated him without using my Burning Kunckle, which I could only use once per day.. but he had diped into my rage.<br>That would be a fatal mistake.<br><br>I sat next to the corspe.. resting myself and gathering more Ki for my spellcasting..<br><br>When I felt a sword, tapping against my Leather..<br><br>A Paladins Blade.<br><br>Fin, Pt 1.<br> <p><IMG SRC="http://members.aol.com/sageofthehalo/Shintou.gif">Shintou Shinai, Lanys T'Vyl's plaything.</p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top"> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm23.showPrevMessage?topicID=55.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm23.showNextMessage?topicID=55.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm23.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=55.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/classic/addReply.jpg border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"><a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm23.threadControl?topicID=55.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/professional/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands (Moderator only)</a><br> <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm23.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=55.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm23.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=55.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub94.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="firionaviefrm1">Firiona Vie General Chat<option value="firionaviefrm9">OT/OOC Forum<option value="firionaviefrm4">The Soapbox<option value="firionaviefrm10">A Bard for a Day<option value="firionaviefrm23">Hero Heart Tavern<option value="firionaviefrm15">The Polling Booth<option value="firionaviefrm40">Kudos!<option value="firionaviefrm2">The Market Square<option value="firionaviefrm22">The Tradeskill Shop<option value="firionaviefrm38">The Spell Library<option value="firionaviefrm39">Events<option value="firionaviefrm42">Roleplayers Wanted/LFG<option value="firionaviefrm43">The Fighter's Den<option value="firionaviefrm44">Tower of Magick<option value="firionaviefrm45">Altar of Faith<option value="firionaviefrm8">RP Server Rules<option value="firionaviefrm7">Patch Messages<option value="firionaviefrm11">Announcements<option value="firionaviefrm13">Moderator's Forum<option value="firionaviefrm12">Suggestion Box<option value="firionaviefrm6">Signature Testing<option value="firionaviefrm47">Guilds and Associations</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#A62A2A>- </font><a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie>Firiona Vie</a><font color=#A62A2A> - </font><a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm23>Hero Heart Tavern</a> <font color=#A62A2A> - </font><a href="http://www.firionavie.org/">Firiona Vie</a><font color=#A62A2A> - </font><br><br> <center><a href="http://www.firiona-vie.com/fvchat.html" target="_blank"><h3>Chat Room</a></h3></center> <br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 6.6.1<br>Copyright ©1999-2001 ezboard, Inc.</center></body></html>
