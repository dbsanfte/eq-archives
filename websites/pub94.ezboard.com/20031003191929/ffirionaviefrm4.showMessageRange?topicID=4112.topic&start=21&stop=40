The strength of a knight in regards to aggro is the ability to generate a lot of aggro over a very short time.  If the knight generates the initial burst of aggro, and then allows the warrior to take aggro off of him by taunting, the aggro problem is now moot.<br>
<br>
That being said, they do need to fix warriors aggro abilities.  Right now, there is no reason unless defensive is required to ever allow a warrior to be MT.<br>
<br>
Nerfing knights is not the answer.  Nor is the answer giving warriors even higher dps, hurting the other dps melee classes.<br>
<br>
The simplist way, in my opinion, would be to change the way taunt works for warriors only.  As it is now, a sucessful taunt gives the taunter aggro equal to the highest on the aggro list plus 1.  (ahem.  If you mash the taunt key everytime it pops, please read that last sentance again.  And again.  And again.  Until it is all you can see when you go to sleep at night.)  <br>
<br>
For a knight, a sucessful taunt is all we need.  We hit one taunt and then we can use our spells to burst ahead of who ever was getting wacked on, keeping aggro where it belongs, on the ones who can take the hits.<br>
<br>
For a warrior however, a sucessful taunt is not enough.  Without a reliable way to generate burst aggro, a warrior needs to either depend on a weapon proc or on straight DPS after the taunt to hold the aggro.  If that proc doesn't come before the next spell lands, or the next backstab hits, or the next double DW'd attack from the ranger or monk, then aggro is once again lost, and the warrior needs to start all over again.<br>
<br>
And heaven forbid taunt fails.  At least knights can try something else to pull aggro.  A warrior can only wait for that button to pop up again, and time how long the chanter can stand toe to toe with the quading nasty.<br>
<br>
How to fix it?  My suggestion is this.  Change the effect of taunt for warriors only from :<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>sucess gives aggro equal to highest on hate list plus 1</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
to<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>sucess gives aggro equal to highest on hate list plus 450*<br>
* if activated when already highest on hate list, there is no result.</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
(Note:  The number 450 is chosen because that is what my highest terror now gives me, according to lucy.  I have no knowledge as to what the actual aggro numbers are.  But you get the idea.  Have it scale, so at level 30 it is highest on hatelist plus 200, at 40 300, and so on.)<br>
<br>
By doing it this way, taunt would still be used for what the designers intended.  Getting aggro when you do not have it.  If it added the bonus even when already on top of the hate list, it would completely change the ability.<br>
<br>
Knights would still be the kings of generating burst aggro, as far as tanks are concerned.<br>
<br>
The DPS classes would not have another class competing with them for group slots.<br>
<br>
And warriors would have a way to generate burst aggro when it is most needed.  In the beginning of the fight before aggro is established, or right after losing aggro.<br>

  After hunting with Groland countless times I've always know where I stand agro wise with a Warrior. What always drives me crazy is when I go proc happy.. hehe. Time to step back a few and pling some arrows. But in all honesty I hardly gain agro over him unless there is ping pong. Mind you If its a hard hitting named I don't plan on any agro. <br>
Majority of the time I'll follow him with arrows for a bit before I engage reducing my agro to start from the begining. Most of my agro is from Call of Fire proc  and its stun effect or my sword going on a string of procs.<br>

This is understood for all exp groups where efficiency is key and (especially for the planes) most high lvl exp groups can't afford the physically weaker members taking a lot of aggro anyway. They'll either die or take a heck of a lot of damage (2 secs would be enough to drop like 1k+ hps). But fights last long enough that I would still prefer a warr since they get plenty of time to gain aggro properly.<br>
<br>
However, for those who hunt often in LDoN, they should realize that aggro control there is a whole nother animal. The MOBs have few hps but high aggro modifiers against casters. Pallys and SKs are definitely the preferred tanks there (sry, warrs, u need a fix). Warrs really have to concentrate hard on those high aggro skilz early in a fite and still gotta be prepared to lose it. If the casters hold back long enough for warr to get proper aggro, your kill rate will decrease significantly. That shammy or nuker will get aggro, but usually the warr can get it rite back after the MOB gets in a few hits on the caster. That 1 extra nuke for 2k damage is almost always worth the 500 damage u take as a caster (just always have regen up). It's all about kill rate with LDoN timer. I can attest that there's like a 35 minute difference for me on adventures where the group decided to hold back or to go all out. After the last one (too close a call at 3 minutes left), I've decided to just drop groups that decide the tank needs to get proper aggro b4 I start nuking. I'm fine with taking a couple hits.<br>
<br>
KEI is pretty much a requirement for LDoN. If your tank is any good, the mana spent on healing him isn't great enough to make a dent in healer mana. I've been on plenty of adventures with not even a cleric (druid healer) and he spent most of his time nuking or healing rod damage, lol (though I told him he didn't need to, but he was always like 70m+). We had a pally to tank so I went nuke happy and didn't take any real combat damage at all.<br>
<br>
What brought this all on was because of my latest experience with Effete from Ebon Storm. The guy just has no understanding for how LDoN works and gets pissed off whenever he has to move around. He still thinks it's an exp group and it is not. He also needs to hit his taunt button sometimes and remember to tell me when his DS drops (which probably contributes most to his ability to hold aggro anyway). I think a warrior has no rite to be pissed at losing aggro in LDoN where you're killing things in seconds, not minutes. With a slower, I (as a mage) was able to tank an add with no help and just kept nuking him till he died in one adventure. I know how to control aggro. Anyone who's hunted with me in an exp group knows this. If you're dumb enough to think LDoN groups are exp groups, you should stay out of LDoN. Until you warrs get your wanted upgrade, I suggest you look into those anger augments for your weapons for LDoN. Otherwise, prepare to have a melee round or 2 stolen.<br>

<br>
If a warrior can't hold aggro if I, as a mage, send my pet in and remain standing for 6 seconds (count that in your head, it's long), then sit down, that warrior is either doing something wrong, lazy, ill-equipped, needs to reroll into a pally or a combination of those 4?<br>
<br>
For those of you who didn't know, sending your pet in does generate a bit of aggro and coupled with sitting down immediately, may get you aggro over warrs (though not pallies or sks of course). Debuffs like Malosinia or Mala would rarely be used for 30 second or less fightes and will definitely not take aggro away from any competent warrior.<br>
<br>
I just want to explore the defining line between a bad warrior and a bad party member.<br>
<br>
Also, is it common for warrs at 61+ to not have some AAs? I may be completely wrong on this one but I thought a warrior was one of the classes where it's better to pick up a few AAs early on. I know as a mage, it's better to just get to 65 then worry about AAs (if I was a min/maxer).<br>

Either that or like, double the success rate for taunt for warriors. I can taunt 4 or 5 times sometimes before the thing will turn back to me. Of course, by that time Zildrax has probably rooted the thing anyway so I can just stand on it for aggro but it's still annoying. Yes, it's everyone's job to control their aggro but the thing is, with a knight tank you don't really HAVE to. You can just go balls-out offense and the knight will keep aggro anyway. Which makes them the favored tanks for lazy people who wanna do their max damage capacity. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :p --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":p"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showUserPublicProfile?gid=coslinroguebarbarian>CoslinRogueBarbarian</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 429<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(9/28/03 12:36 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=4112.topic&index=31>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: What do you warriors think about this idea?</span><hr size=1> Like Traelle said, if you have a Ranger, Monk, and especially Rogue stealing Aggro from a Warrior, then something is very wrong with those three classes.<br>
<br>
Rogues can evade. Evading equals a easy 500 aggro reduction. <br>
<br>
Rangers can Cinder Jolt or whatever its called. Another 500ish poiint reduction.<br>
<br>
Monk can turn off autoattack, and FD for crying out loud!<br>
<br>
Everyone can do something, its just a matter of how, and more importantly, when.<br>

You'd cast and sit RIGHT down, so don't act like you counted.  I wasn't complaining that I had to move, I was complaining that you kept following our puller while the rest of the group stayed back and let him do his job.  Its not just my job to hold agro, its your job to not take agro.  Lets say you throw in the extra nuke early and the mob runs from you....then all of our melee's are scrambling to get back in melee ranger so they can start hitting again.<br>
Its people like you that make warriors feel like they're broken.  I know we're not, we just need to stop grouping with dumbasses.<br>

It was meant to be sarcastic in my remark upon said warr's abilities. Yes, I know Velsor. The magician's tower has a library thread dedicated to damage shields (I'm pretty sure though it's been a long time since I read it).<br>
<br>
The quoted statement was just a remark on his aggro holding ability (none). I thought it was an obvious exaggeration and would be taken as a sarcastic remark. Sorry.<br>

Holding agro is not only the warrior responsibility, its a group effort not to take it as well.  *looks at the nukers with fingers stuck to cast and grins*<br>
