<br>
You spend virtually everyday of your life with the same person for three years.  Suddenly, that person stops talking to you.  Won't return phone calls.  Seems annoyed when you catch them at home.<br>
<br>
It really begins to bother you, so you point blank ask them what you did wrong.  They tell you that you did nothing.  HOWEVER, something has changed and that they do not know what, but whatever it is, it's unchangeable.  They no longer wish to talk to you.<br>
<br>
Turns out, at the same time the person stopped talking to you, they also 'coincidentally' began dating someone else.  Heavily.<br>
<br>
You have never felt so betrayed, lied to and hopeless in your entire life.  The one person that could comfort you wants nothing to do with you.  Because that person - the one you can't imagine living without - is very much in love with someone else, when just a day prior to the disowning - they professed their undying love.<br>
<br>
It's a disgusting feeling and it feels like part of you died.<br>
<br>
Do you wish them luck, pat them on the back, tell them it's okay and that you understand.  -- <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>That's what I did, and now that the sorrow is beginning to settle in, I'm beginning to feel very angry.</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
Or do you tell them what a cruel, conniving, heartless, deceitful cretin you think they are?<br>

Just don't let it influence your actions, if you know what I mean (taking golf clubs to foreheads).<br>
<br>
In times like that/this, I always think of my life like a Story, and this is but a chapter. Stories wouldn't be very exciting without emotion or conflict, but all the stories I like to read have happy endings. So I know its of little solace, but know that things will get better, the sun will shine again, and tell yourself that you'll get your 'happily ever after'. <br>

<br>
The person wouldn't even look twice if we passed on the street now.  <br>
<br>
I feel very angry, and part of me will always care about that person - so I'm not sure that acting on anger will get me anywhere.  Especially when they obviously could care less about what I have to say.<br>
<br>
Why reduce myself, yes?  Or perhaps I should rant on them, so they can roll their eyes and walk away.<br>
<br>
But I am angry nonetheless, and I wasn't sure if I was over-reacting or how you could love someone and feel this anger towards them at the same time.<br>
<br>
And I am a 'one love' type of person.  To me, this is more painful than the death of my parent.  It's hard to move on and anticipate a life without them in it, when you don't understand the reason or have the desire to suddenly stop caring about them and in this same chapter, you swore you would love them forever.<br>
<br>
Now I can't sleep.  I'm worried sick about the person.  The new lover is so wrong for them and I would hate to see them throw their life away.<br>
<br>
I would give my life if I knew in exchange, that their innocence and safety would be preserved. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showUserPublicProfile?gid=bakanome>Bakanome</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#A62A2A>(1/23/04 11:02 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm9.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2353.topic&index=5>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_sad.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: .</span><hr size=1> Can't really say a whole hell of a lot.

It's funny.  Indifference hurts a lot more than someone who is infuritated at you.  Someone who's pissed at you still cares to some degree.  Of course you can love someone and be pissed off at them to that degree.  Hell, that's the only way you can ever be that pissed off at someone.  Sometimes it's best to force a confrontation.

It hurts, I won't deny that.  They obviously don't care enough about you anymore to have the common courtesy normally expected from one you have been in a relationship with.

I wasted 10 years of my life on a relationship that wasn't right for either of us when we sat down and thought about it, but we stayed together, because there was some love, and it was extremely comfortable. Don't be a fool. He left for a reason. If he's not man enough to explain it to you, don't waste your life waiting for an explanation. I assure you that getting back together will result in a future breakup.<br>
<br>
It sucks, and his current relationship may be wrong for him, but he'll figure it out eventually and move on to another. You should too.<br>
<br>
If it helps any, 5 years after the last break up with the woman I was with for 10 years, I got married, and my wife and I are extremely happy. The right person is out there.

2) Video tape yourself eating his/her cat and mail it to him/her  COD. That should make a point. Of course that particular point is, &quot;Look at me, I'm eating your cat!&quot; but hey, whatever.<br>

Other than that, I feel for ya. A few years ago I went through a similar though not nearly as severe situation. The relationship just changed. At least in my circumstance, we ended up after a few rough months, remaining really good friends.

I know it's hard to change your mindset when you've cared about them so much, but it sounds pretty clear that they don't want your attention.. I'd give them space for a bit at least. Their new lover might be terrible for them, but people have to be allowed to make their own mistakes. If the lover is really so bad, they may need your friendship in the future. Whether you'll want to give it to them after how you were treated is up to you.<br>
<br>
Wow this pronoun game is hard. Feel free to clarify the genders...<br>
<br>
Do you have the right to be angry? Yes, definately. I don't think anyone would argue that they treated you badly.<br>
<br>
The thing is, I think it's rare that people act with malicious intent.. and feelings are damn confusing. Possibly the reason they're being so distant is because they know how badly they acted. It's not easy to face up to screwing up, and if they've made a decision to be with someone else, the alternative of just not being around you and not having to face it might seem more desirable. If this is the case, I'd put my money on the fact that they'll change their mind at some stage, but whether you'll want to be there for them is once again up to you. You don't owe them that.<br>
<br>
That said.. I could be completely wrong in my interpretation..<br>
<br>
As for dealing with the pain.. I'm really not sure because I have some pretty bad coping mechanisms myself. A truckload of ice cream and a bitch fest with friends is always fun.. but really, don't waste your energy on worrying about them. They're not allowing you to be in a position to help, so you have to accept that. <p><!--EZCODE CENTER START--><div style="text-align:center"><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://www.imgmag.com/images/leknill/Kepic.jpg" style="border:0;"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--></div><!--EZCODE CENTER END--></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showUserPublicProfile?gid=sinnaji>Sinnaji</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>I'm a big bad monster who <br>likes to eat little <br>children while playing <br>with all my sweet women,<br> while dressed in nice colors,<br> who owns everyone that comes to this board<br>

Was this virtually everyday spent online?  Or was it in the real world.  <br>
<br>
Because, if it was online.  Then the person should be strung up in some horribly painful way.  Because, I believe that you can actually become more influenced by someone online, you can care about them a whole lot more than someone you've met in RL.  Why?  Most people say, &quot;you don't really know someone, till you've met them&quot;  Yes, that's absolutely true.  THAT is the ONE reason becoming attached to an internet person CAN be much STRONGER than RL.  Because, any flaws they have can easily be hidden or bypassed by simpley typing.  You never actually fall in love with the person, but the person you want them to be.  Some people realize this, and they prey on others.  Scum ass mother fuckers are what I like to call them. But that's just me.  If he/she was one of these internet shits.  Then yes, think about the horrible pain that should be dealt to them....but don't act upon it.  This person lives a lie, and isn't in love with the new person.  He/she is just an asshole<br>
<br>
If this was RL, then I can't really help you.  I know it hurts to lose someone.  But quite frankly, I've been single for almost all 19 years of my life except for one internet relationship.  YAY.  Perhaps the person really did fall in love with the other person.  Maybe they were in distress those three years of your life and were just using you as a snuggle pilow.  Either way, if this person wasted three years of your life, by not being open and honest about why they stopped being with you.  Then they aren't worth more than the pile of shit they will eventually step in sometime soon.<br>

If he was the type to be concerned about your feelings, he would have approached the situation differently. He would have been an adult about it and explained that the relationship was over in the way he felt for you. If he was worth your time, he would have tried to be a friend at least, insted of a piece of sh*t who ran around behind your back.<br>
<br>
You're only going to remember the good times at this stage of loss. Try to remember that he was not and is not the end-all-be-all of lovers. He showed his true self by his actions. He is not as great as he seemed. Somewhere inside, you know this. Just give yourself time to accept the truth. He deserves whatever heartbreak he suffers for what he did to you. did he even think twice about how he hurt you? <br>
No.<br>
 Not by his actions.<br>
 Actions say more than sweet words.<br>
<br>
My thoughts and good wishes go to you. May you find the great person you deserve, who will respect you as well as love you. You are one of a kind. You just don't always remember that.<br>
