It's often easier to walk up and hit your target so it follows you rather than attract it with a bow. Sometimes, pathing can make your frenzied foe run all over and bring lots of friends. <br><br>Hunting in open spaces, or in places you KNOW your foe won't run all over, a bow is very handy or throwing something at it, so you can at least get a head start run back to your party. <br><br>As for the strength of your foe, your Shaman friend can make them weaker and slow them down so you could probably take on some yellows as well. As you get stronger (Since I'm in my 40's, I'll use the that), yellows will be much tougher. Even blues can get pretty rough. <br><br>I'm sure there are other techniques used so I'm curious as well. <br><br><!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> Edit: typing in a hurry leaves room for errors.</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> <p><center><img src="http://www.gamelinx.com/everquest/siavasig.jpg" alt="I amSiava!"><br><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=267640"target="_blank"><i>Teir'Dal "Goods"</i></a></center></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/usiava.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Siava</A> at: 8/18/02 6:37:24 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=ranari>Ranari</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 2<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(8/20/02 8:42:17 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm43.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=123.topic&index=4>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> answering myself</span><hr size=1> Got to surfing around after asking my question, thinking surely someone else has &quot;all the answers&quot; out there, maybe I can find them and pick their brain.<br><br>Well, I don't think I  found all the answers, but I did find a pretty cool resource.<br><br><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://pub57.ezboard.com/ftheeverquestnewbiezonefrm12">pub57.ezboard.com/ftheeverquestnewbiezonefrm12</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--><br><br>Ranari<br>&lt;Circulus Amicorum&gt; <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/usiava.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Siava</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 94<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(8/20/02 9:45:47 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm43.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=123.topic&index=5>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: answering myself</span><hr size=1> It's hard to have all the answers since everybody has their own fighting techniques.

Although certainly more important in dungeons than in outdoor zones, it is still way up there on the list of warrior ways. <br><br>My first lessons in pathing were at the orc camps in East Commonlands.  When I first started out, I'd just walk up and hit an orc; sometimes pulling all four of them on the group (well on me, but then they'd come for the group...at least that's what I'd see in the chat window once I awoke at my bind point &quot;TOO MANY ORCS!  ACK!  DIED!&quot;).  Let's just say I was not a popular guy back in those days.<br><br>Later, I learned that the Orcs at the camp each have a particular path and that it was possible to pull them one by one if you avoid stepping into, or pulling one of them into, the path of the others.  With practice, I was able to pull one or two orcs (instead of four) and my popularity rose.  From this time on, my goal has always been to learn the pull orders for certain areas so that I can single pull if possible (in some areas they say it is impossible...but there must be a way dammit).<br><br>A higher level example is the Sol B King Room.  It is possible to pull singles from the King's Room but only if you do not walk up and press attack.  All you have to do is merely put yourself within view of certain kobolds in a certain order and it is possible to take the kobolds one by one.  For example, if the room has not been broken, you begin by inching your way down the right hand wall, you will eventually present yourself to one of the outermost kobolds.  If you inch within view and then id or con the kobold, this kobold will aggro and not pull in his friends.  You do not need to hit the attack button; you merely present yourself to the monster.  You can walk him down to your friends for slaughter.  On the next pull, you can hug the left wall and present yourself to the other kobold at the entrance.  Same thing, you inch forward, stand, id or con, kobold aggros, and you take it down to your friends for slaughter.  Once those are done; you inch your way into the room; and then ever closer to an outer kobold.  If you do it well; single kobolds all the way to the King.  I have done this many times; but my good friend Ruil is the master of single pulling the King's Room in Sol B (don't worry, I was not going to use the phrase &quot;mad props&quot; in relation to Ruil's ability).<br><br>Unfortunately, it can be tricky finding the precise spot which will draw the monster from his lair without disturbing the others.  What's worse, is that the only way you can really learn it is by trial and error.  What's even worse, is that level plays a part in it; I found it difficult to single pull the King Room in Sol B (or the Orc Camp in EC for that matter) until I reached a certain level; at which point it seemed easier and easier to single pull.  What's even worse than that thing that was worse than the other thing :0 is that you will often be heard shouting TRAIN, TRAIN as you run with multiple monsters on your tail while all the other casters and armchair pullers judge you to be some sort of incompetent lout while you are learning the pull order...that is, until you learn the pull order so well that you make an extremely difficult area a piece of cake for everyone else.<br><br>At level 51, I have learned the pull order of the Orc Camps in EC (memorieeeeees, sniff, sniff), the Warrens (what do you mean they come from that other room over there if I pull this one over here!?), Runnyeye (all those goblins running every which way and all that amusing chatter; that one was fun), most of Mistmoore (ouch; those were hard lessons), and Sol B (why oh why do people like to meditate at the zone line).  Lately, I have taken to getting into trouble in Karnor's Castle, Kael, Chardok, the Velks, and Sebillis in search of their elusive pull orders.  Which means many people will be seeing the old TRAIN, TRAIN from this old warrior in those areas and that my popularity will be much lower than it already is for the foreseeable future.  In fact, that is probably the first two things on the list of warrior ways, making a /shout hotkey warning others of the mess you are dragging behind you and being wildly unpopular for bringing a few too many monsters to the party.<br><br><!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br><br>Medite Marconus<br>51 Seasons of Getting In Over My Head <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon3.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/umixxibixiebane.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Mixxi Bixiebane</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 147<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(8/29/02 11:08:48 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm43.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=123.topic&index=10>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Warrior Ways</span><hr size=1> I'm also surprised at how many pullers don't realize that they shouldn't pull something across a harmonied mob's path.
