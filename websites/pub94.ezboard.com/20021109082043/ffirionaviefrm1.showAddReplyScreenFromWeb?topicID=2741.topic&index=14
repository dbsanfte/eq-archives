At the age of maturity, sent to the Court of Pain to begin training as a Swifttail. After Years of apprenticeship, sent out into the world to prove worthiness. Hunts with his crechemates, brothers and sisters, all given different apprenticeships. After a few years, honing skills close to home, went wandering farther afield.<br>
<br>
First exposure to non-Iksar.... fear and lothing, disgust at their weakness both physical and moral. First exposure being the short pointy-eared invaders of Kunark, both blueskinned and pale. Forced to interact with some, to obtain needed supplies far from home, encounters language barriers. Chose to learn some languages, rather than starve. More interaction with non-Iksar learning their tongues. Sees some admirable traits in a few of these softskins, begins to wonder.<br>
<br>
Interaction becomes more frequent, actually hunts with some softskins. Sees more admirable examples of all races, as well as the vile disgusting softskins who are spoken of by the Elders. Wonders at the dichotomy. First stirrings of pity for these less than Iksar beings.<br>
<br>
Forms a guild with some friends, who bring along some non-Iksar &quot;friends&quot; of theirs... a disturbing concept, but his friends are Iksar, so to be trusted.<br>
<br>
Meets a curious Human who sometimes claims to be an Iksar, trapped in the body of a human, sometimes claims to be Karana's Cleric to the Iksar, sent to convert the Empire. Obviously insane, but with some small talent as a healer.<br>
<br>
Meets an Iksar who claims to be a Goblin, in the guise of an Iksar. Obviously insane, perhaps addled as an egg. She shows great prowess as a priestess, first true non-creche friend.<br>
<br>
For a long period, hunting and training far from home, has little interaction with Iksar. Forced to interact more with the softskins, decides since they are to be slaves, they can be used, but sees more and more that is worthy of respect in some. Learns many tongues, masters a few. Truely begins to wonder at the dictates of his Elders. Comes to befriend some of these non-Iksar, long period of confusion.<br>
<br>
Spends much time hunting alone, both near to home and far afield. Spends much time thinking about the Empire, and the softskins. Does not so much have an epiphany, as reaches a conclusion:<br>
<br>
Still numbers many not of the Empire as friends, but realizes that the vision of the Elders is right, even his friends must one day be slaves to the Empire. But also believes the Elders are wrong, slaves can contribute to the Empire, they are like any other possession, some are useful, to be cherished, others not so useful, to be used up.<br>
<br>
Sees no contridiction, other than with the beliefs of his fellow Iksar. Still seeks to solve this contradiction, as he is viewed as less than whole by many within the Empire, but still believes there is some worth in some non-Iksar.<br>

<br>
As a youngster, she was drawn to the ways of Karana by her father, and sought training with Te'Anara in Surefall Glade.  <br>
<br>
In her 10th season as a druid of Karana, the undead invaded Qeynos Hills, and in battle Sarhea fell, but rather than returning right back to Qeynos, she awoke in a place of mists and thunder, and heard the voice of Karana, who basically told her(the story is on my board) that she was better suited to be a fighter for the Rain, and when she awoke, once again in Surefall, Te'Anara told her that Hager Sureshot would teach her henceforth. <br>
<br>
 During this time, her teenage years, her father decided to tell her a little about her mother...well two things. One, that she was teir'dal. and two, that he'd loved the woman.<br>
<br>
<br>
So, she followed Karana as a ranger, she became attached to a druid.  <br>
<br>
When he'd had a bounty put on his head for the slaying of dark elves guarding the Nektulos forest, she decided to go seek out the one who'd placed the bounty, in hopes of giving her druid vital information....however, she fell in love with that dark elf, instead(damn the little blue skin guys*grin*).<br>
<br>
And through a series of events, some of which being(and this is just her point of view, not necessarily what actually happened) those she called her family spweing more raw hatred than she'd ever seen, then turning their backs on her, and having the dark elf declare that he'd never loved her at all, that it was all just a trick, etc etc....she learned true, pure Hatred...and Karana took his magic from her.<br>
<br>
Bereft of her love, AND her magic, she sought out a human she'd spoken to a good deal(Morgrist Vanadil, just to give credit where credit is due), and spoke with him about her life choices. <br>
<br>
Even after hearing about what it would take, she chose to walk the path of Hate, and went through a purification ritual. <br>
<br>
When she regained consciousness from the ordeal, she felt no magic within her, but instead, a pure, crystalline hatred...and then she was shown to the Dismal Rage, where she started training in the ways of sword dancing.<br>
<br>
<br>
And so on and so forth, to today, etc, yada yada.<br>

Essentially, he was born a normal man to normal parents. <br>
Jiren was ambitious... to a fault. Picture the typical Shakespeare tragic hero, with one flaw that is his undoing. Such is Jiren and his ambition. <br>
Ambition led him to marry above his station. Wasn't enough though. Ambition then led him to be easily possessed by a demon created by the combined energies of Cazic-Thule and Innoruuk. The demon called itself the Scourgefist. The Scourgefist first had Jiren train as a monk to be its own personal weapon. It suppressed most of his personality and engaged in whatever mayhem pleased it. Jiren was angry with himself, captive in his own body. Power is what he wanted, but it was not he who had power, but instead the Scourgefist. He slipped his spirit into meditation through his monkly training, which kept the Scourgefist from destroying it completely. With the energy he conserved, he called to a Shamaness. The Shamaness faced off with the Scourgefist finally, and exorcised the demon.<br>
<br>
Unfortunately, the realization hit Jiren too late. Without the Scourgefist, he was normal. He had no power. His years of monkly training were stripped from him. He was miserable, without skill, poor, pathetic. He began to loathe himself and the Shamaness for &quot;freeing&quot; him. His ambition again hurt him. Never before had his longing for power seemed this far-fetched. Hatred for all that happened engulfed him, and that hatred spread to all around him. Innoruuk enjoyed this immensely. Jiren and he came to an &quot;understanding&quot; of sorts. Jiren would make the world hate and fear him, as long as Innoruuk provided the means to do so.. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=korzax>Korzax</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 52<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(9/21/02 5:29:09 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2741.topic&index=19>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Is dat joo?</span><hr size=1> Born in the mountains,<br>

Twisted and Reversed roles. The Father being the Evil and the Mother showing love. Only a Rememberance of the Fathers Hate and lustful weakness. A Forgotten mother, a forgotten care, throught the twists and turns of the lost mind.<br>
<br>
Never to be shown love. Always to hate and lash out against those that show the face of his father. The Hyprocrity of them all. They'll pay for ever giving him life.<br>

Only a will to destroy. No will to create. Their is only Yang.<br>

Forgotten love of the mother. Of his very own mother, throught the corruption and touchure of another. Twisted and bent into the Image of the Perfect being to destroy. Kerafyrm.<br>

Never to be raised in Neriak.<br>
Never to have the ability to seduce others to do the hard work for him.<br>
Forced to fight for every scrap he could gain.<br>
Sometimes, just surviving can add to the Madness.<br>
<br>
Lost within himself. Never to feel love, but others try to show him.<br>
But he cannot. He never learned how. Its not within him.<br>
All he has is his weapon, and his voice.<br>
Thats all he feels he'll ever need. <br>
