The Secret of the Amazons<br>
By<br>
W.C.Wills <br>
(PoStryven)<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp I’m writing this because I know they will soon find me. They will go to whatever lengths necessary to keep their secret hidden. That can mean only one thing, my death. I can only hope that this will be found by somebody who will believe.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp It all started about a year ago. I was in need of a vacation but everything I looked into seemed the same old boring stuff. You know the type, five nights/six days of some place promising excitement and hinting at romance.. Been there, done that. Usually it means a tight schedule of eating, drinking, and being hustled with other tourists. I needed something different. I went into a little hole in the wall agency and sat in front of a woman and just looked at her.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “Something different.” I finally said.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “Different.” She replied.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “How about Aruba?” She pushed some brochures my way.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “How about, not.” I pushed them back.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “How about Scandinavia?” She tried with a smile.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “I said different when I sat down, and I meant different.”<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp She nodded and started digging around in a file cabinet. Eventually she handed me a brochure on the Amazon River. It took about a minute for me to recognize that it was a Yuppie Tour. You know the kind, “Take a tour, Save the planet.” A portion of the proceeds goes to preserving the place you tour. But I must admit it looked different. No glitz, no hype, pure discovery.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp I signed up for it and a week later I found myself climbing on board a boat that looked like it came straight out of the movie African Queen. There was about a half a dozen others on the trip and I remember hoping I didn’t look half as yuppie as they did. Not that anybody would confuse me with a yuppie now. The first half of the river tour was great. We saw exotic birds and animals you would expect to find in the middle of the jungle. It was also three days of bugs but hey, it beat Aruba. Then it was time to turn the boat around and head back. That’s when the trip turned sour.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Right after we landed the boat the captain suggested we stretch our legs or ‘refresh’ ourselves before we started the trip back. That was fine by me. I had to refresh myself so bad I could taste it. So while the others were doing whatever, I looked for a little privacy. While I was taking care of things I thought about how glad I was that everyone else had left me alone during the trip. Just as I was thinking about how enjoyable the trip was, the lights went out. I mean hard and painful like.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp I woke up in a small shack. I couldn’t tell if the makeshift door was locked. I had a shackle around my neck and about five feet of chain locked to a ring on the opposite wall. If I was any taller I wouldn’t have been able to stand up because it was bolted near the floor. Later I would find out why. By the way, did I mention that I was naked?<br>
<br>
After I don’t know how long, the door opened and in walked one of the tallest women I have ever seen. And boy was she built. I don’t mean endowed, even though she was, I mean she had muscles. She looked like she could put down Arnold and not break a sweat.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “Don’t get any ideas Little Man.” She sneered as she walked over and unlocked the chain from the wall. “Head outside.”<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp I took about three steps towards the door and she gave the chain a yank. When I came back towards her to keep my balance she slammed a fist into my gut.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “That’s just to remind you who’s on the other end of your leash.”<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp After about a minute she pulled me to my feet and shoved me towards the door. I admit, at that point I was feeling real obedient. She led me out into a clearing in the middle of what looked like a small village. There was a bunch of women standing around and I was the center of attention. At one time in my life I would have really enjoyed the idea of having twenty or so women looking at me the way they were, but understand, some of them made my guard look small.<br>
“Okay women, listen up. For what he’s worth, here he is. Those of you who wore out the last one are at the end of the list. Stop the grumbling about it, if you were a little more considerate to the rest of us you would have been more careful. The rest of you remember, they only last a couple of months at best, so be easy on him. And if I find out any of you have been beating him just for kicks, you’ll go without for a while.”<br>
<br>
After that she took me back to the shack and locked me back in place.<br>
“I’ll be checking up on you every couple of days, let me know if anybody mistreats you or forgets to feed you for more than a day.” Then she left.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp It wasn’t much longer before they started. I lost count of the days, and didn’t even try to keep track of how many women. A rough guess would probably be about six a night and maybe two or three during the day. I know, your thinking no way in hell could I manage that. But I’ll tell you, yes I did and yes it was definitely Hell.They had certain techniques they would use that would make me able whether I liked it or not. I will go to my grave before telling how they did it. It’s too horrible to make known. <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp I was able to learn a little about them over the weeks that followed. After being satiated some of them would be in a talking mood. Not that I wanted conversation with them, but I hoped I might find something to use to my advantage. They are the descendants of the original Amazons. Before you laugh, all I can say is I believe it. They pretty much keep to themselves but over the last century they have been infiltrating the outside world. Mostly they rely on their ‘small sisters’ to help them keep up on what’s happening in the world. Occasionally if the price is right and they can be discreet about it, they would take mercenary jobs. And they train. They have trained for centuries. Constantly. I honestly believe there are no meaner, deadlier fighters on the planet. Sorry Guys, but that’s the way it is.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp And I learned their Secret. Every one of them would come in acting so superior, like nothing in the world could stand against them, which is probably true. They would take their battle gear off and still look like they could bite rocks and make them bleed. But then they would take off the rest of their clothes and it was then that they would expose their secret. I learned early on not to watch them as they disrobed. Most would get so upset they would slap me around a bit until they felt better. Usually I would do my best to be looking at something else until they were done disrobing. Once naked they were fine and looking for one thing, and by hook or by crook, (and worse) they would get it.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp This went on for weeks but during the few times of the day when I was left alone to get some sleep, I would keep busy. Quite often I didn’t have the strength to do much, but when I did I would work at loosening the bolts that held the ring. Then one day I managed to pull it off the wall. Carefully I put the ring back and loosely put the bolts in place. I was still coherent enough to know there was no way I could escape during daylight. That night when it was getting too late for any more to show up I got ready to escape. Then one more came through the door just as I was to pull the bolts out.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “So, how’s my Little Man? Has anyone been beating you for no reason lately?”<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “No Ma’am. No one has for a long time.” Figures it would be the Senior Bitch!<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “Then I guess I’ll have to take care of that myself. I want you nice and ready for me.”<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp I had to think quick. I was more concerned with her discovering the loose ring than the beating. All she had to do is throw me around once and that chain would drop loose. I don’t think I would have survived the discovery.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “I’ve seen a lot of them tonight Ma’am, and I wouldn’t want to disappoint you by not keeping conscious.” I did my best to look docile and subservient.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “Then you better be ready to give me special treatment.”<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “That I will Ma’am, that I most certainly will.”<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp While she was distracted with getting her ‘Special Treatment’, I managed to undo the bolts to the ring. She didn’t even notice as I gathered up the chain in one hand. Then I made it a point of getting her attention.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “Excuse me Ma’am, here’s something special for you.” When she looked I brought the chain down hard. Did I kill her?, your probably thinking. I did. I never considered myself to be a violent man but not only did I kill her but I enjoyed doing it too.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp I don’t remember much of the actual escape. I managed to sneak out into the jungle and then I ran. And ran. And then ran some more until I collapsed. I was found by members of some tribe or another, all I know is that they weren’t Amazons and they weren’t cannibals. To be honest, if I had to choose one I’d pick the cannibals. They removed the chain and shackle from my neck and nursed me back to health. We never understood a word spoken to each other but I think they knew by my condition and by the way I was fearful of their women where it was I had escaped from. I got a lot of respect from them.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Eventually I was brought to a civilized place and got my way back home. But I know the relative security I feel right now will be short lived. Because I know that some day they will find me and when they do they will kill me as they have killed every other man that has learned their secret. And I know that there are some of them in our society now. The ‘Little Sisters’, the one’s too small to be part of the Amazon tribe are living right here! Right under our noses and nobody realizes it. But they are just as shackled to their secret as the other Amazons. Someday they will get me so I’ll tell what their secret is and in doing so I’ll have my revenge!<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp For centuries, maybe thousands of years, they have trained to be insensitive killers. Warriors that no one can defeat. Fighters that would cheerfully cut the throats of the enemy. But underneath that cold exterior and the battle gear is a weakness. And that weakness is an overwhelming need to wear pink lacy panties.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp That’s right. Every one of them wears them and are ashamed of the fact. And the reason I know that there are Amazons among us is that in almost every clothing store you go into, buried amid the lingerie you will find pink lacy panties.<br>
