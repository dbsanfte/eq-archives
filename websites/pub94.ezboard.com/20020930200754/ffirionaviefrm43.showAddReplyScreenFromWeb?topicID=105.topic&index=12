I have 210 Strength, 197ish Dex. <br>
<br>
Agility is about 60 points higher than it should be -- You get an AC bonus for it, up until it's around 120 points, or so.  After that, it's like 1 point of ac, for 30 points of agility -- Useless.  Stamina is the -real- stat that you need to focus on, as a high level Rogue.  I'd love to get mine to 255.  But seeing as to how I know longer play on Tunare... the odds of that happening are pretty slim.<br>
<br>
Not to mention, most players on -normal- servers have a Primal weapon, if they've been level 60 for 3 months.  It procs Avatar.  That's about 100 str, 100 dex, 100 agi, 150-200atk(depending on what other +atk items you're wearing)...<br>
<br>
So, you could have 155 str, 155 dex, 155 Agility.  Then go for say like.... 200ish stamina.  When the Primal proc'd (Trust me, they proc non-stop, and even more, after they've proc'd -- high dex)... You'd end up with 255 str, 255 dex, 255 agility and 200 stamina.  In my opinion, that should be the 'goal' for higher level 'raiding' rogues on this game.<br>
<br>
Keep in mind, I have 160 Stamina, as a Wood Elf.  If I had been a barbarian, I'd probably have 190-200ish.  Depending on what I equipped.  I don't suggest playing a Barbarian, though <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->    the filthy brutes!<br>
<br>
Now, for Hybrids and Casters, I couldn't really tell you.  I wouldn't want to go all out stats, then have like 120 intelligence, if I was a Shadow Knight.  But then again, I've never played that class past level 30.  I have no idea what stats they really need to focus on.<br>
<br>
Also, take note, that -most- Rogues' stats tend to be 'higher' than that of warriors, and other 'tank' classes, due to the fact they -generally- use items that are piled with Str, Dex, Agi and next to no AC/HP.  In my opinion, hit points/stamina are -the- most important stat for a raiding Rogue.  <br>
<br>
Those AEs don't hurt as bad, when you have 5-6K Hit Points buffed.  Or those Ripostes for 600-1200 damage -- You can't always be -behind- the mob, especially on casters.  You have to fight on the same side as the tanks, in order to 'push' and interrupt their castings.  <br>
<br>
Now, if you're not a raiding Rogue.  You could probably get by on Mrylokars/Assassin's.  AC is actually better, for a normal experience group, than hit points.  At least in my opinion.  I don't mention SV, because -most- Rogues tend to have -all- SV in the 85ish range, unbuffed, with normal gear.  At least on a normal server <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   <br>
<br>
Just posted what I've learned from my experience in the game, as a Rogue.  /Shrug.<br>
<br>
Edit: Just wanted to say, that Dex makes a -huge- difference for a level 60 Rogue.  When I used to have like 150ish *Cringe* dex, I only &quot;proc'd&quot; assassinate once every hour or so, in Seb.  When I got to 197ish 'unbuffed' I was beginning to proc it non-stop.  I had instances where I had assassinated five pulls in a row -- of course, alot of that also has to do with what level the mob that was pulled, was.<br>
<br>
Combat Fury -- If a Rogue wants to make good use of this, I seriously suggest getting that dex up.  It makes Critical hits proc a -lot- more often.  This isn't just an opinion.  You can tell a -huge- difference.  Moreso than strength.  <br>
<br>
Makes a big difference with proc'n weapons, too. <br>
<br>
Helps with throwing weapons.<br>
<br>
So, whoever says dex isn't useful, is obviously ignorant <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :( --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/frown.gif ALT=":("><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <br>
<br>
Also, forgot to mention... as a Rogue, you should -always- have 36% item-haste or higher, at level 60.  Preferably 41.  If not, you're going to be stuck using a lame 15/25 for the rest of your days.  <br>
<br>
Plunder Eyepatch is also nice, stacks with item haste -- Right Clickable effect.     <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/uzeraziatainte.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Zerazia Tainte</A> at: 7/4/02 3:29:43 am<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/uxenojones.showPublicProfile?language=EN>XENOJONES</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 163<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(7/5/02 12:18:04 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm43.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=105.topic&index=13>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Stats make no difference, at higher levels.</span><hr size=1> Slam &lt; stun kick and all warriors get that at 55th.<br>

Personally.  At level 60, and with a few raids.  There's no difference between a half elf and an Ogre.  Well, the Half elf has better faction, gets dates, has more AC, and isn't in someone's way 100% of the time.<br>
<br>
Alot of you don't understand, that you can't -really- tell the difference, and stats max 'too' early to make a difference.  <br>
<br>
Tunare's &quot;best&quot; warrior, is a Wood elf.  It's &quot;best&quot; Paladin would either be Relix or Gaunt.  One's a half elf, the other is an erudite.<br>
<br>
I assume you play on this server... and it is a 'roleplay' server, or seems to be.  I just don't see how someone could 'choose' to play an Ogre, over a Half Elf.  Unless they're the type of person that enjoys playing cruel, 'evil' brutes.  And if they are, there's nothing wrong with that -- someone has to do it. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=fvreghar>FVReghar</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 9<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(8/8/02 4:09:16 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm43.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=105.topic&index=15>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> well....</span><hr size=1> there are imo better race wars than others. there are unseen factors that are suddle but not to be over looked<br>
<br>
ogre as was staited starts with highest stam and str and can slam and never be stuned from front.<br>
<br>
first question how many mobs that u fight in real raids stun? mobs like vindi statue KT any of nameds in ToV sshra up ackevha or any raiding zone how many of hte mobs stun?<br>
<br>
second question do you lose some potincal agro when u are stuned?<br>
<br>
<br>
to anscer those questions to save you the time.  <br>
<br>
yes dam near every mob u fight on raids stuns,<br>
and yes you lose agro when stuned, now im not saying u lose complet agro but u do lose some and u lose the potincal for causign agro threw procs.  now people would say bfd &lt;big fucking deal&gt; however thing of how long some fights go? any where from 2 to 10 ments?  so how many times would a non ogre war get suned in a , say, 5 mint battle?  i would think quite a bit would u not say so?<br>
<br>
so lets say each stun u are stuned for one sec. you get stuned once every 4 rounds of attack<br>
<br>
they avrage 4 atack rounds every 12 secs if there not stuned?  so in 60 secs you will be stuned  5 to 7 times.<br>
in 5 mints thats a varibale of 25 to 35 secs u are stuned.<br>
<br>
now when ua re stuned u have 30 other people  doing large amount of damage simontansouly. <br>
<br>
<br>
in long fights u do lose agro when u lose agro people die like roggues who have KT turn on them and kill them dead if they cant get dic off fast enough or stuff like that happes . <br>
<br>
slam is also a natural taunt where as kick is not<br>
<br>
those are my oppions <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ucoinfist.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Coinfist</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 117<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(8/9/02 1:29:31 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm43.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=105.topic&index=16>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: well....</span><hr size=1> Stuns are random and based on something that im not sure of.. However as a dwarven warrior i dont get stunned but maybe 4 to 6 times per 10 min battle.  To be stunned 6 to 7 times every min would be abnoxious at best, not to mention stuns last between 2 and 6 seconds.<br>
<br>
As for races go.. Ogres are nice that they dont stun from the front and yes id agree a minor amount of agro is lost during a stun.  This is compensated by your raid knowing thier job and that job includes remaining low on the stun totem pole.<br>
<br>
While stunned I have held agro through others knowing thier jobs and roles.  So in the end.. the race is fairly irrelevant with the frontal stun being the only factor but not a big enough one to pigeon hole the best warrior as an ogre.<br>
<br>
HPs are a factor and while large races get stamina bonuses at the beginning I dont find it hard to keep up with them in HPs, though recently VI has screwed the warriors who are non zek followers on thier cultural.  I fight hard to keep my stamina at 205 trading out gear to keep it there for the raid buffs to max me at 255 or roughly 300hps.<br>
<br>
In conclussion.  Any race is fine but if you want to be a lemming make an Ogre unless you chose to for another reason other than everyone telling you they are the best.<br>

<br>
In a former life I was a high end raiding warrior on rallos zek.. a *human* one at that(how absurdly rare is that =p). I had never met an ogre that was as good as tanking as his ego driven by &quot;stun immunity&quot; seemed to project him to be.<br>
<br>
Any race warrior can get to 255 sta( or very close buffed) and 1250ac(unbuffed at or near softcap). Even in a small small guild. More importantly is how you use the tools of your class, and tools you pick up in game to your advantage. <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <br><font color=#A62A2A>- </font><a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie>Firiona Vie</a><font color=#A62A2A> - </font><a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm43>The Fighter's Den</a> <font color=#A62A2A> - </font><br><br><br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 6.9.5.6<br>Copyright ©1999-2002 ezboard, Inc.</center></body></html>
