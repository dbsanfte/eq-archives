<br>
I do wish you were right, but I fear that you aren't.<br>
<br>
If and when Verant does feel that this server is &quot;dying&quot; (and their idea of dying will probably be &quot;unprofitable&quot;), I'm sure that they will do something.  My guess is, they will take a single step towards making FV a normal server.  In other words, I predict that FV will drop ONE of the rules.  Probably either TLC or forced /role.  <br>
<br>
Verant won't admit that they are doing it out of desperation, either.  They will claim (with some honesty) that they are doing what they were asked to do by the players. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/urobingoodfellow.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Robin Goodfellow</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 80<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(1/20/02 6:53:49 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1151.topic&index=22>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: The server is *NOT* dying... slowly *OR* surely</span><hr size=1> I agree with Valquiss.  I don't believe the &quot;server is dying&quot;.  I'm not at all sure how you'd evaluate that, anyway.<br>
<br>
There are throngs of people in Kelethin all the time now, and the number is pretty much the same stable number it was when I first started in October: about 60-70 during the weekends, about 40 on weekdays, about 20 at night.<br>
<br>
What is different, however, are the hordes of people in the low-to-mid-level dungeons.  Crushbone regularly has 20-30 people in it--it only has fewer if someone's trained DVinn to the zone and he's slaughtered everyone.<br>
<br>
When I spent time in Blackburrow, there were generally more people running around than gnolls except very, very late at night.<br>
<br>
I don't think &quot;the server is dying&quot;.  I think people are levelling slowly, like myself, partly in order not to miss out on quests that otherwise might TLC.  Or because they're &quot;casual gamers&quot;, like myself.<br>
<br>
I suspect that, to people in their 40s, yeah, it looks like the server is dead because there are very few people up there, relatively speaking.  However, the wave is coming.  The people in Crushbone/Blackburrow/etc now will be moving into their 20s soon, and there are a lot of them.<br>
<br>
Also, Sullon Zek hasn't been shut down.  I don't think there is, as of yet, any precendence that indicates VI will shut either server down.  They fit a &quot;niche-market&quot; that VI wants to attract--after all, how many people here have said they'd completely quit the game if it weren't for FV?<br>

That's the only zone in the game with both a portal and /auction.  It will *always* be a gathering spot no matter how low the server population gets.<br>
<br>
We definitely loose a lot of players.  Personally, I think there are only two rules that actually make even a token effort at supporting RP: the language changes and the alignments.  Both have very poor implementations, though.  The entire ruleset simply ammounts to an extra hurdle.  If you're an experienced player, you can probably overcome it -- or at least you won't quit too early, since you know what you're up against from the start.<br>
<br>
Examples:<br>
<br>
TLC -- not RP.  Just makes quests *extremely* difficult or even impossible if you don't read the spoiler sites.<br>
<br>
/roleplay -- not RP.  It means I have to ask and am asked class/level constantly.  I'd prefer conversations to not require game mechanics in the first hello.<br>
<br>
No /ooc or /auc, /yell-range /auc and /shout -- not RP.  RP is handled entirely through communication.  Limitted communication means limitted RP (and you can always turn off /occ, /auc, or /shout if they bother you).<br>
<br>
Languages -- RP on one side, communication limitting on the other.  Should have been done just with NPCs, not PCs.<br>
<br>
Alignment -- RP, but with bad implemenation that limits player creativity.  Should have been done wide open, but with faction consequences; eg. inky can go &quot;good&quot;, but if he does, Neriak/etc. become KoS.<br>
<br>
I could go on and on about how the ruleset really doesn't do anything but make things harder.  It doesn't support RP because Verant never defined what RP was when they went out to support it.  They seem to have just added a bunch of odd restrictions to force folks into small narrow niches.  RP is about creativity and your own storyline, not about marching in step with the NPCs. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/urobingoodfellow.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Robin Goodfellow</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 85<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(1/21/02 2:06:30 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1151.topic&index=24>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: You can't ..</span><hr size=1> I'm not judging &quot;just by Greater Faydark.&quot;<br>

<br>
I'm judging by my experiences in Highpass, where there's almost always two full groups, one on either end.<br>
<br>
I'm judging by my experiences in the East Commonlands, where there were 20-some people there at 3:00 a.m. my time last night.<br>
<br>
Yes, some of zones have fewer people than others, but I think patience will reveal that the server is thriving, in spite of what the doomsayers think (or desire).<br>
<br>
Lastly, if you hate all the server's rules, go back to your blue server.<br>

I do think TLC has really brought a negative show so to speak as it applies to questing and what not. That I think is bad. Honestly I think the altruistic fix is just to make all magic items no drop and do what they did at release; have lore tags only on all items which were involved in the quests. Those that like loot still get loot, and those that love questing can still go and quest. For that matter, we can still multiquest as well. Think of it from the table top aspect. Magic items should be something special somewhat, worrying about an economy in a role playing game is just out and out wrong.<br>
<br>
The Alignment system just isn't working. Goods and evils just don't belong together in guilds and groups. Think about it from the table top viewpoint which this server was meant to emulate. Paladin X groups with Necromancer X. In a tablerop setting I guarantee you one of the two would be rolling up new characters not long into the first adventure.<br>
<br>
I see and here about people leaving the server consistantly. As much as I hate to say it, I see it. I waited, I watched, and even after Luclin...people continue to go.<br>
<br>
This server needs some changes if its going to really survive long term. As much as I hate to say it, if there aren't changes made and made vocally so...I only see the server continuing on its residual decline. And the longer they wait to make the fixes (if they do), the worse its going to get.<br>
<br>
The idealologies that went into the server are absolutely wonderful. The applications of such however, just isn't equitable math.  <p>Banegrivm Shadowblight<br>Sovereign Lord of the <a href=http://www.1stfistoflight.com>1st Fist of Light</a><br>Firiona Vie</p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/umaladominus.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Maladominus</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 13<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(1/21/02 6:24:35 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1151.topic&index=28>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: SoL</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr>   Personally, I think that the population of the server is much less because of the amount of people that can't run EQ any more because after the Shadows of Luclin update their computers aren't up to scratch any more.

<br>
Bingo! <br>
<br>
All other theories aside.... 2 more additional reasons why all server populations may be slightly lower:  <br>
<br>
#1. Luclin expansion = players having a hell of a time getting logged on after the expansion gave them all sorts of technical problems <br>
<br>
#2. People are trying out the OTHER MMORPGs like Dark Age of Camelot, which means they cannot be playing EQ and those other games at the same time, can they? <br>
<br>
Time trying out new MMORPGs = Time away from EQ <br>
<br>
simple equation <br>

The people that I know that are leaving the server are:<br>
a) People that joined this server for a challenge (They want to become uber first, not roleplay)<br>
b) Farmers who thought they could get rich because of lower population<br>
c) d00ds who like showing off their uber gear, but can not shout about how uber they are because the language and limited shout range<br>
d) People whose computers could not handle the Luclin expansion (We have had a number of these in our guild)<br>
<br>
     I believe this server is doing well for the people it was designed for. People who like to roleplay, casual gamers who dislike the crowds and want to see the sights that are always camped on other servers and older players who can never understand d00ds. Now this does not mean RP at all times, but as a matter of practice.<br>
     I do see a problem with the 40+ group though. They all leveled so fast that a gap formed between them and the rest of the server. Alot of them came with ready formed guilds and power leveled their way to the top. Then when FV did not meet their expectations they left and there is not enough mid-level people to fill their shoes.<br>
     My guild, which started about week 3 of this server, is doing well with our leadership group in the mid 20's, even more teens and a few in their 30's. We are growing at a slow and measured pace like we want to keep that family atmosphere. There is almost always someone to group with in our level ranges, but it is rarely over-camped which is nice. Sometimes it can seem there is not enough people in your range because alot of people are busy running quests and things instead of grouping. This has happened to me before where I run a quest one night and the next a person I usually group with is doing the same.<br>
     I like the closeness of this server, the slower pace and the feeling that you know most of the people around you. I always know some of the people I run past on the way from FP to Qeynos, on my old server I never did. Leave the server the way it is. I see it as a fine wine, it will just get better as it ages.<br>

You are so right ! This is how EQ was MEANT to be. I remember back in 98 there was a brief nano-second when ALL servers were RP. At first, everyone made a brief if feeble stab at it, til they were inevitably overwhelmed one by one with L33t D00ds. The feeling of community, outside of one's own guild, was simply not there. It is here. Do you really miss having to turn off /ooc &amp; /auc just to wade your way through east Commons ? I don't. It's called everQUEST, and here people actually do ! It's not 10,000 nameless twinked lvl 60's LFG in Velkators looking for that last bit of AA xp. We dont have the rampant scammers here either, reputation counts for something and that is a good thing. Especially in the 40+ where the population is so small. A wizard isn't doomed to logging on LFG for 10+ hours because he/she isn't the 'ideal' fit for a group, people are more adventurous for the most part. TLC ? Gee, so you might have to actually form friendships with lower levels or hire out mercenaries to help with your quest, once again, a community builder. Yes a lot of the rules make it more CHALLENGING, personally, I was getting burnt on the high end game ( hurry up and wait ) and have found a wonderful refuge here. So FV isn't for everyone. Boo Hoo. Don't let the zone door hit ya where Tunare split ya. <br>

Feneant (the original poster) is level 42.<br>

More than half of this server is <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> under</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> level 20.<br>
<br>
What do you think that says about the number of people he bumps into during his journeys?<br>
<br>
People are taking their time on FV, and a lot are doing things other than rabidly working to rake in XP.  Just because groups aren't jostling for position in Lower Guk doesn't mean the server is dying.  If you go to any of the lower level zones (commonlands, deserts of ro, Oasis of Marr, Lake of Ill Omen, Highpass Hold, Karanas, etc) you will usually find a quite healthy population of players out and about having fun.<br>
<br>
Even more than that, I've noticed a <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> lot</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> of players completely new to EQ who've been chosing Firiona Vie as their home.  If I had to guess, I'd say we have the highest influx rate of new players to EQ than any other server.  <br>
<br>
I really don't think that<br>
<br>
a) Firiona Vie has a population problem<br>
<br>
or <br>
<br>
b) Lifting TLC or removing forced /anon would bring anyone new here.<br>

<br>
FV has not moved a bit relative to the other server rankings from my perspective...maybe yours is different.  Each time I have logged on it's either the lowest populated, or 2nd lowest with SZ being lowest.  This hasn't changed since day 1 afaik (I started in November, so I don't know for certain if it was higher in October...just my recollection since my old server was in the bottom 10).<br>
<br>
The 'newbie' zones seem relatively populated to me, and has not changed since I started.  Most 30+ zones are pretty empty and have always been (save a few like SK), because most people don't even get to 30+...that is a consistent fact for all servers.   The problem is basically this server has had a low population from day 1.  Has it gotten significantly lower?  I have no idea and nor does anyone else besides VI.<br>

Currently, only VI holds the true population numbers, and they're not giving it out.<br>
<br>
I do, however, agree that we are losing more high level players (30+) and receiving more new players (either new players, second acounts, or re-rolling a new player).  This should be what you are really complaining about - the deminishing high level population.  <br>
<br>
*shrug* there is no really good way to deal with that.  I don't think removing /anon would actually help anything because it is not the difficulty of knowing other's level that is creating group problems.  It is the fact that there is just not enough high level people around the zone you're playing in.  By the time you're 40+, you should at least know a handful of people close to your lvl, and build a solid group from that friend list.<br>
<br>
I don't think we should treat grouping etiquette in the same manner we do in other blue servers.  FV has very different rulesets, and pick up groups just do not work that efficiently in the higher level playgrounds.  In FV, if you want to do a dungeon crawl, it's bring your own group.  If you want an exp grind, it's bring your own group.  If you want to get some item, it's bring your own group.  This phenomena just gets more and more evident as you level up.  I don't think removing /anon would do anything other than giving the beggar a easier time to target the high level players. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/uxsatyrx.showPublicProfile?language=EN>xsatyrx</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 91<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(1/21/02 6:33:31 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1151.topic&index=38>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: The server is dying... slowly but surely</span><hr size=1> hehe...i like Shintou's take on this) <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/uimogenelddar.showPublicProfile?language=EN>ImogenElddar</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 79<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(1/22/02 5:25:22 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1151.topic&index=39>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: The server is dying... slowly but surely</span><hr size=1> &lt;&lt;Ad hominem personal attacks don't make you any friends.&gt;&gt;<br>

Look on the bright side, Lasgalen.  At least Bjond didn't call you a &quot;griefer&quot; for disagreeing with him.

<br>
I think low population is good, not like if we were 20 to play on this server. The only problem you can encounter is that the server is not mature enough to have a big high lvl population. But when the time will come, we will have probably a better high end game than in any other server thanks to low population. <br>
