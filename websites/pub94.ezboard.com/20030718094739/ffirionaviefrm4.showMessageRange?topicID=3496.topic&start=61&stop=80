<br>
My second thought:  farmers inc.<br>
<br>
Everyone knows that TLC has a workaround.  We do it whenever we need to get an epic piece from a mob too low.  So now in come the farmers and it goes back to EQ pre the NO DROP days when people camped certain mobs 24/7 to sell the gear on e-bay and that was what they did for a living.   That is WHY no-drop was instigated. <br>
<br>
So, either they fix the TLC code and break the workaround, or this has just become EQ pre-NO-DROP.<br>
<br>
The other problem is mid-level groups.  If you don't HAVE to raise your toon here, why will you?  And the problem with the 30-50 population just worsens.  It's hard enough to get a group now (go into Najena sometime, you will probably be the only one there).<br>
<br>
If there is a petition to Sony to get the transfer ability removed, I would like to sign it.  <br>

We all paid our $13 per month while 'raising' our characters. <br>
<br>
Then the rules get changed like this and we cannot do anything about it. More then likely the &quot;Online game content is subject to change&quot; covers their asses. <br>
<br>
I for one feel misled and outright ripped off by Sony now. They advertised one thing and switched it on us. Making orcs stronger is a &quot;content subject to change&quot; issue. Changing the transfer rules on us seems like a pretty blatant change. <br>
<br>
Just remember, Sony does not care about YOU at all. Sony only cares about the almighty dollar. Their lawyers can beat up your lawyers. If you don't like it, you can just leave. It sucks but those are the facts. The only way to get something to happen would be a mass exodus of FV players cancelling their accounts. We all know that is not going to happen. <br>
<br>
You are in THEIR world now. Misleading and misadvertising are all part of Sony's online gaming world. When they release a game (like Planetside and even EQ) and it's still basically a beta product and we pay $13 to play, who are the real dummies? <br>
<br>
It is unfortunate that something legal cannot be done about this (I do get the feeling that one day maybe it will). It's very misleading to buy a game and read the features on the box and then come to find they are not in the game. Any other business in the world has to worry about false advertising. Why is it that MMORPGs don't? Someday I think they will. <br>
<br>
I came to the server to play among players that enjoyed the same thing I did. I invested a LOT of time in my character. Now I can either deal with this change, or quit. <br>
<br>
Thanks Sony!! You are the used car dealer of online games!!<br>
<br>
Don't expect to see me paying to beta test Star Wars for the first 3 months and pay you to do it.<br>
<br>
Fool me once, shame on you. Fool me twice.... I don't think so. <br>

<br>
I can only speak for myself, but when I log on to play, almost 95%+ of my playtime is spent grouping strictly with guildmates.  I think it is safe to assume that the majority of other players in a guild do the same, that being one of the biggest reason to join a guild.  On FV, there are several guilds which would be considered a RP-encouraged guild.  Almost every guild in the Fellowship alliance alone falls under this category.  I'm certain there are evil guilds that follow the same principals as well.<br>
<br>
Assuming the above assumptions are correct, there is almost 0 chance whatsoever of a non-RP d00d who transferred over from a blue server infringing on any RPers gameplay.  The way I see it, if the RPers are all grouping together, say with other RPers in their guild, then they have removed the non-RP d00d from the equation.  The only times you might encounter them would be in the Bazaar, Nexus or PoK.  <br>
<br>
As others have pointed out, the biggest impact this would have is on the raiding scene, and then only if an entire guild transferred over.  If that were to happen, I don't think the impact would be on the current high-end raiding guilds like FnF, Reso, AD, ES, etc.   The biggest impact would be on the guilds still doing places like NToV, Sleepers Tomb, Ssra, and VT.  If an entire guild of 60-65 folks with lots of AA points transferred over, they will have to reequip.  That means they would be raiding in zones technically beneath their level.  So this would initially impact on the current tier 3-6 guilds, not the current high-end guilds on the server.<br>
<br>
And in the rare event a non-RP d00d starts mocking the RPers, I have faith in the Soapbox that the RPers would make his life miserable on this board.  <br>

<br>
I started thraall the first day FV opened up, not cause of RPing, not cause of powergaming.  hell i didnt know much about EQ then.  i came to FV cause the idea of starting fresh etc sounded cool and the only other server i had a char on was RZ and a warrior and PvP dont mix (he was lvl 30).  I RPed with everyone else to my extent but really i have never been into fantasy, RP etc.  I got started playing EQ cause a friend in the dorms showed it to me and it seemed like a good way to pass time instead of doing school work.<br>
<br>
But Thraall grew up my roommate, who liked to RP joined FaF, i ended up joining FaF also.  At that time i was a relative n00b to the high end content didnt know what half the stuff meant.  But that being said in the year plus that i have been in FaF i dont think i have EVER heard a story, allegation or anything related to FaF or Reso for that matter of either of the high end guilds doing ANYTHING against the Roleplayers.  The two sides simply stay to there own sides.  i know whenever i run into someone who is into the RP aspect i try and do my feeble job of roleplaying, calling the female barbs Lasses and such.  But Really who has ever heard of an instance of Roleplayers having to deal with anything from Reso or FaF??? NO one cause we dont mind that people RP, just like i hope that the roleplaying people dont mind that we raid.  its a different way to play the game.  No ones side is more right than the other.  thats what makes both sides mature, the ability to peacefully co-exist and lead our own lives without ruffling each others feathers.<br>
<br>
So again i ask you HOW has Reso/FaF (since anyone who would transfer to our server for raiding would be going to one of these guilds) ever inhibited Roleplaying?  We take pride in the fact that we have people in our guilds mature enough to be able to act like decent human beings.  Neither guild will let the scum into there guilds who trashes other sides etc cause it servers no purpose.  the people who trash RPing are the people who are ignorant and something no one really likes dealing with.<br>
<br>
Think about it guys, use some sense for a change.<br>

Thank you for the insult.<br>
<br>
Let me put this plainly:<br>
<br>
1) If someone is not willing to start over to play on this server like everyone else was then I am not interested in having them here.  If they reject one special rule of the server then what's to stop them from rejecting the rest.<br>
<br>
2) Sony promised us NO transfers.  They have now allowed transfers.  They did not even have the decency to change the rules publically so we could cancel our subscriptions if we rejected this rule change.  They are collecing my monthly fee (since I play on no other server) under false pretenses.<br>
<br>
3) No matter how good FnF and Reso etc. may be they have zero control over another guild transferring here in full force.<br>
<br>
4) This has already led to calls to get rid of TLC and no NO DROP.  I like those rules. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showUserPublicProfile?gid=thraallfv>ThraallFV</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 631<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(6/16/03 8:02 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3496.topic&index=66>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.calpoly.edu/~msamuel/frgSthrl.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: The record's stuck</span><hr size=1> First off if i offended you it was not on purpose.  i rarely ever do it on purpose and it takes a LOT to set me off.  and you have a few points ill address though most likely not a good answer but another view point is all.

1) not wanting to start over.  I wouldnt want to start thraall over,  i would not play rather than lvl my chareter all the way up.  thats basicly asking people to throw away TONS of there time spent playing.  But thats an arguemnt that goes all ways.<br>
<br>
2)  SOE promise is no arguemnt to go off of.  I think we ALL know that <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :p --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":p"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   sad but true.  if i had time to spend i could come up with all kinds of proof that trusting SOE is not something that is a good idea.<br>
<br>
3)  I dont htink its possible for a guild to transfer here in full force.  if it was i would fully understand your point.  WHen you transfer you lose all your items, that counts PP and bank items.  You come withe keys, flags, AAs.  so to do that would take a massive benefactor in FV and even everything shanana/boog has wouldnt come anywhere near close to equiping a small percentage of a guild.  The only reason people would transfer is for the RP, for the No Drop (but one person cant do anymore harm than a charceter started fresh on FV), or to join a guild (high end raiding generaly).  Therefore they are banking on getting in the guild. therefore wont be dumbasses or they will not get in and the will be the random d00d who is no different than a home grown d00d.<br>
<br>
4) i cant help you there <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

The wording of the response confuses me...<br>
<br>
Is the GM saying transfers ARE permited?  I get the impression they are saying the rules are as stated... but replies after yours seem to imply the opposite. <p><!--EZCODE CENTER START--><div style="text-align:center">~Vabris Vy'Tok, of House Vy'Tok~<br>

<br>
And my guild is not FNF by any means - they must be flooded with transfers.<br>
<br>
They come because of the special ruleset and because the end game is less crowded. But is it gonna remain that way if we get 50-100 65+ every week?<br>
<br>
Sign that FV is getting more crowded: during day times we are no longer the least crowded server beside Zeks and such, and I'd bet that in evenings as well we'll end up in middle of pack. <p>--<br>

If they really have opened our server to transfers in and this is not some interdepartmental snafu at SOE they may as well just remove the rp preffered tag and make us a normal blue we'll be flooded with high level people who will want to monopolize the high level content on this server and many of those who have worked hard to get where they are on this server will lose out big time.. Its bad enough they allow stormhammer people to transfer back. <br>
