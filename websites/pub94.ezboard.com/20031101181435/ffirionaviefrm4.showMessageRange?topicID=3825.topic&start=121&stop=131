<br>
But then, most people don't get optimal groups except in rare cases--and that, not what <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>you</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> are able to do, is what matters here, considering I replied to a statement which claimed that non-raiders, such as myself, could earn about 1 AA point per hour over time.<br>
<br>
Last night, for instance, Durne and I were trying to set up a BoT group. However, after almost five hours spent on <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>PoV</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->, killing razorfiends and the like while looking for that elusive cleric or druid we would need as healer on BoT, we were forced to simply disband and call it a night. Half of the time while we were fighting, we were just three or four in the party; we simply couldn't find enough 60th+ level damage dealers to fill out the party. Oh, yes; did I mention the 65th wizard who insisted on nuking no more than <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>once</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> per fight?<br>
<br>
Experiences like the above are the reason why, to me, a good party denotes any group featuring six active, reasonably competent players, with me as tank, a druid or cleric as healer, a shaman or enchanter as slower, and any number of wizards, mages, monks, beastlords, rangers, and/or rogues as damage dealers.<br>

Gee I kill paffin with a group of 4 does that mean I deserver better loot then a small raid, dont think so.  I read that someone else kill him with 2 should they get eplane gear off him hardly.  The fact that charm pet can be use to kill small raid lvl mobs dosnt mean you should get better gear off the fight.  I kill the croc with sneeze and 3 others, the 5 of us (only I was in a raiding guild) didnt use a pet we just kept our pick up tank alive should we get better gear then when I went with 18 one day and killed it.  Hardly see the connection, Zsu solo bot mini boss for a bit, I ve one group a tower boss using pets big deal.  I dont even think I will come back to this thread where folk whine that they should get the best gear because they are flat out do shit better then a raid.<br>

Luckly they have LDoN and your next post can be that your 6 or less person group should get time gear off what ever one group mob you find there and how it totally unfair that you dont. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showUserPublicProfile?gid=jharycleric>Jharycleric</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 728<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(8/11/03 3:24 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3825.topic&index=123>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: I don't think you'll see elemental gear ..</span><hr size=1> See there is a reason that raid force level mobs drop better loot then group level mobs, even if the group does it's work to perfection...it's because they are TOUGHER. There is a reason that you need a raid to kill a cetain mob, and it's because the mob is a bad ass. So my trio of level 10's can kill Dorn...does that mean we shold be getting AoW blades and BoT ornate molds? Being able to do tougher with less is it's OWN reward. You have to split even &quot;crappy&quot; loot with fewer people so you can go sell it to buy &quot;uber&quot; loot.  I have led dozens of raids where the top end players get nothing. They are there to help the yopunger players learn how to kill a certain mob, practicing for bigger mobs, or equiping them for tougher encounters later on. Kess, Yeth and I can trio just about anywhere, but do we for a second hesitate to go back to Kael to help some guildies or allies kill something? No. Do we still go to CoM to grab the half dozzen jade reavers we seem to need every three months? Sure we do. Do we expect elemental gear cause we just managed to beat the hell out of everything in our path, cause we are the leetest players on the server? Um, no. <br>
<br>
People often talk about how guild raids run smoother then open raids, well I was on an open raid that killed KT with 21 people. Should our loot be better cause we were a leet open raid? Better gear drops off tougher mobs, and I sure as hell would not want to see elemental gear drop off of Dungeon mobs.<br>
<br>
BTW Milow, the 6 F&amp;F'rs that PA picks to raid would be WAY more leet then the 6 you pick. :P<br>

<br>
Everquest is just a game - there is no right or wrong. There is just entertainment value. <br>
<br>
Wether the same amount of work done by a group will lead to the same rewards that people putting out similar effort, but in a raid is entirely up to SoE. And that decision will be based on how much they think that will affect their income.<br>
<br>
I would bet that SoE is losing a lot of customers these days. I would guess the burn out rate in raiding guilds is fairly high, and guildless people tend to quit as well after reaching high levels because there's very little content left for them to do. It's just a guess of course. <br>
<br>
What I mean is that in order to retain their customer base, and attract new ones, they will do what they think is appropriate to increase the entertainment factor for as many people as possible. Branding people who have a different opinion of fun as whiners won't change that.<br>

<br>
Jhary, you miss my point though that there comes a time when due to stuff not being sold in the bazaar, &quot;crappy&quot; loot becomes totally worthless.  You could have 999,999,999pp in the bank, and it would do you no good because you already bought the best money can buy.  I'm not at that point yet, but quite a few slots are at that point on Iumuno and me.<br>
<br>
Also, keep in mind with your Dorn example, you are level 10.  If there were gangs of level 10s raiding crushbone to kill Emp. Crush and the ambassador, and they were dropping that kind of loot, you'd have a good analogy.  What I'm talking about is small groups of skilled level 65s, not level 10s.<br>
<br>
Milow - I think you missed the point, too.  I don't want easy nameds next to low-MR CoD pets that do 500+ dps and then have them drop time loot.  What I want is an opportunity to be tested to my limits and if I pass the most difficult tests, I want the opportunity to earn time-level loot.  It may take a year to work our way as a group or trio or whatever through a series of hard battles, where each one takes practice, good gear (to make you spend time gearing up for each new fight), and taking the time to figure out the tactics.  I'd imagine each encounter to get progressively more difficult, but also include interesting things like scripts, not just a mob that hits hard but can't kill a pet in 12 seconds. Glykus is hard because he spawns all those boars over the course of the fight.  Iumuno figured out how to handle that, though, and we can kill him.  The troll guy who spawns the swords (Tagrin Maldric I think) is the next step for us, and we haven't beaten him yet.  That's hardly a case of a CoD mob with low MR standing next to him that you just charm and collect your loot.  Dealing with the swords with 3 people, plus keeping the group alive, plus having enough mana for the long fight, plus keeping the pet charmed is hard.  The mob next to him is above the mez and pacify caps, so you can't just get a single pull, either.  Yes, you can use root and stuff, but it adds to the complexity and demands of the fight (which makes it more fun, too).  Glykus is rather easy and boring compared to that.  Sure, we wipe on Glykus sometimes, but you can't do much when you get an early charm break, and early charm breaks happen.<br>
<br>
What I'm trying to say is, I'd like mobs the difficulty of Tagrin Maldric and up in maybe the top 1/3 of 6-person dungeons in LDoN, and I'd like the loot to be better than ornate armor, because whereas you can take 40 people in Drunder to kill the troll and gank the BP, you can only take 6 into an LDoN dungeon.  Just instead of dropping 1 automatically, have a 1 in 8 or 1 in 10 chance of a 150ish hp/mana bp dropping, or whatever.  That way if you demonstrate equal or better skill to someone in a raid force, you have the opportunity to earn equal loot, with an equal chance of getting that loot (48 person raid with an automatic drop, each person has a 1 in 48 chance.  6 person group with a 1 in 8 chance of drop, each person has a 1 in 48 chance... that's equality, not a gauranteed piece of bazaar trash).<br>
<br>
If you limit the number of people on an encounter so that you CAN'T throw more bodies at it to make it dead, the loot quality should go up, because those 6 people, if fighting as part of a 40 person raid force would be killing much bigger mobs, but it's completely ridiculous to say &quot;raiding is the only legitimate way of earning loot&quot;.  The fact that they decided to play as a single group, but still fought content appropriate for their ability should not be a punisher, it should just be a different way of playing that's <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>equally rewarded if equal skill, effort and time are required</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->.<br>
<br>
I'm not whining, I'm asking for an opportunity which doesn't exist in EQ right now: an opportunity to advance in the game on a path that doesn't involve raiding, rather than hit a brick wall and have to decide between raiding again, or finding another hobby.  And I'm hoping (but still a bit skeptical) that LDoN provides that opportunity.<br>

You say 65's who play their characters well....well the one example you talked about didn't sound like skill to me so much as luck. you specificly talk about &quot;if we were a hair later on this&quot; or &quot;if we had donr this a fraction of a second too soon&quot;. Well with all the variables in EQ such as lag, computer performance and such, you have moved from a sheer skill determination to one of &quot;Come on baby...Daddy needs an eleven.&quot; You might have to have a certain level of skill to create the optimal chances for the event to occur, but the event occuring is still a chance.<br>
<br>
And then you have the problem of...why go raiding then? F&amp;F, or AD or whoever could just camp the mobs continously also and get the fat gear, and it would be much easier for them as they would just overpower the mob with their uberness. My friend Yeth is a heck of a MT, as talented as I've seen. Nikka asleep at the keyboard is more powerful and a better choicve merely based on the bajillion AA and gear. If you start balancing mobs out so that Uber 65's are doing different ones then , Powerful 65's, as oppossed to Average 65's, and with weak ass been playing two weeks 65's bringing up the Moss Snakes of LDoN, then why bother at all? Just make Kick Ass tough mobs who can only be brought down by raids. You want to be rewarded in a fairly equal manner for playing a different style of game. I understand not wanting to raid. It is just about the most boring thing in the world. It makes no sense though to have mobs that can be brought down by a group of the &quot;in theory&quot; most powerful characters on the server, drop the same gear as Fennin Ro and the Warlord in Earth B. Good god, Uliamarath is a Teir 4 level guild by herself. She can solo Gorenaire, who is considered a Teir 3 level mob, if I remember correctly. Should there be single group mobs for her, Milow, Nikka, Zeit, Chosun and Xoraxis to go kill that drop Plane of Fire type gear? I wouldn't think so.<br>
