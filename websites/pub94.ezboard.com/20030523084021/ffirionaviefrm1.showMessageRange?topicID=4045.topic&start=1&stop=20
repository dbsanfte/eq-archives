Not knocking the people that do though; if you enjoy raiding (which a lot of the game is based on) then those tags at the top on FV right now. I've had rezzes from people in both guilds who were passing through a zone, just to be nice. So, if you want to have a flame about them, please carry it to the soapbox.<br>
<br>
What I was wondering is if either guild would ever allow a person to come along just to see something new. Like, if I got my warrior up to 60+ someday, could I ever come along as an extra tank for just one raid to see a zone I might not otherwise? (Assuming I have the proper flags and/or keys and armor) No chance at any loot or anything, just to be there. <br>

<br>
otherwise, it's always worth a shot, but the problem is that if you dont have experience raiding you tend to make mistakes and that might hamper the raid. Another problem is that if a lot of people did the same, they might end up with half a dozen hangers on at each raid.<br>
<br>
You might be able to persuade them to hold an open day or something. Or ask them to do more open raids.<br>

&quot;If it is clear there is no interest of yourself joining with the guild, it is highly unlikely you would be invited to join for an adventure.  If we invited yourself, we would have to invite everyone who just wanted to try something new, and there are far too many.<br>
<br>
There may be, in the future, more adventures like the ones we took into the altered Plane of Mischief, where Resolution will host and lead those who sign up, and you would be more than welcome to join (provided you are able to meet the requirements set for your own safety)  At this time, I am not aware of any concrete plans for such an adventure, but I forsee us doing it again at some point.<br>

If you wish to discuss this further with an officer of Resolution, you may contact myself and I will be happy to answer any other questions and perhaps give you ideas for other options, but I do not think unproven guests with us would be possible.&quot;  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :( --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/frown.gif ALT=":("><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://www.boomspeed.com/ayrielle/AyriSig1.gif" style="border:0;"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showUserPublicProfile?gid=luewenafv>LuewenaFV</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 89<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(4/2/03 11:23:40 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=4045.topic&index=4>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: FnF and Reso tours</span><hr size=1> /waves to Ayrielle, Angel of Reso =-)  I like your sig <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

Dear FnF and Reso<br>
<br>
It's not that we have no clear intent on joining, its more like we can't join for certain reasons beyond our control. Me for example. I would love to come and raid with you guys but the problem is even if I applied I know I would get rejected. Why? Because I live in the UK and cant sit up all night and Start a raid at 1am in the morning and then go to work the next day at 7am <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :( --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/frown.gif ALT=":("><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
If there was a raiding guild the size of you guys that catered for europeans and people with a real life that can't raid 24/7 then that would be fun <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  . Not knocking you guys but not everyone can attend even if they wanted to.<br>
<br>
For example. Entity is a good online friend of mine. Ever since she left ER to join you guys in FnF to do raids I hardly get to group with her. that's fine and not your fault. Its just frustrating I can't come and raid too.<br>
<br>
I think the Open Raid Reso did was a great PR stunt and indeed made Reso more respected in my list but if you guys could do this more often, then I am sure a lot more in FV would feel more love towards you because then they would not feel belittled and also feel that you guys do indeed care for the community around you.<br>

I never expect to see everything in the game. I don't have the time to commit to it. I hope they are still doing that type of thing by the time I am able to participate. <br>
<br>
As for the time difference, Noggy, perhaps you should consider a European server. This is in no way a &quot;get off my server&quot; thing, just saying you might want to consider an alt over there. You would have a better chance of finding high end guild with schedules similar to your own. I know how you feel though. I have three accounts because I can't limit myself to one class and I don't like the idea of leaving FV. Perhaps you could recruit more Europeans to this server from there. Or, you could have some luck by finding their chat board and posting an invitation to come check out FV. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showUserPublicProfile?gid=lrahlfv>LrahlFV</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 120<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(4/3/03 1:55:25 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=4045.topic&index=8>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: FnF and Reso tours</span><hr size=1> There are several reasons why these things are often not possible.<br>
<br>
A. With the large number of people on raids, the lag is incredible.  I have an awesome machine, and I still suffer from the LD bug or 30 sec lag.<br>
<br>
B. Keys / Flags - Unless you can get them on your own (unlikely for most) it's just not worth it for either guild to invest time and get you flagged for one day.  If it was something simple like a key to be passed around, not a big deal.  But otherwise, it's considered time wasted.<br>
<br>
C. People are here for themselves.  I'm not saying that people are selfish, but we've invested the time and effort to get to the point where we can see these zones and often don't want to be slowed down by those who haven't.<br>
<br>
D. Competition - FnF and Reso are in constant competition for mobs in the game.  If one guild were to take in guests or hold more open raids, it would lead to the other guild having uncontested mobs.  It embarrases me to say this, but that is part of being in a raiding guild.<br>
<br>
E. Miscellaneous - There' s a multitude of other reasons that I'd rather not get into.  But I'm sure you get the general picture.<br>
<br>
By the way, Resolution will be holding more open raids in the near future.  Some ideas are currently being tossed around and we'll get some information out soon.<br>

You either like us or hate us that is fine, but I think for raiding guilds (well except between ourselfs hee hee) we treat other with more courtesy then you will find on most servers. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showUserPublicProfile?gid=kelindale>Kelindale</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 101<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(4/3/03 5:02:59 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=4045.topic&index=12>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: FnF and Reso tours</span><hr size=1> Remember the good old days when all you needed was Super Mario, a Fire flower and &quot;A&quot; &quot;B&quot; Buttons to beat Bowser?

Well said Milow. <br>
<br>
I have been on FV as Sordail McAngus since Feb/O2, when i started EQ. I have never created a another character anywhere else. I took a long time leveling, to learn the game, and i hopefully will hit 65 today.<br>
<br>
Reading this thread was very interesting for me, as I have seen all sides now. ( Not just the FnF vs. Reso, but small RP guilds  to Raiding guilds ) It does amaze me, when i see others with some of the same misconceptions I had for so long. First of all, I am PROUD to be in Fire and Fury. These people research and execute well on very difficult encounters. I don't raid 24/7. Neither FnF or Reso raid 24/7, or anything close. we raid generally 5 days a week. like 7pm-11pm est. I have a fulltime job, and a life. Being in the end game does NOT require your first born. I do play pretty much every day, but I did that before even applying to FnF. At this point in my game, I prefer to raid, as that, for me, is where the fun is. It's like the old adventuring as a levl 9 to Blackburrow, scared outta my mind. Without the new excitement of flagging to pop gods, VT, etc, I might be pretty bored at this point with EQ. <br>
<br>
I understand the request, it would be fun to bring folks for the ride. But as has been stated, difficult too. And please KNOW that members of raiding guilds are people just like a level 1. I still sit on the grass under the gnarled oak tree in PoK and flirt with the girls, and muse about my childhood being brought up by Gnolls and wolves in Everfrost. I CARE about FV.  <br>
<br>
So, If ya catch us movin thru a area, wave, say hi, chances are ya missed the /waves and /hugs  /smiles we sent as well <p>Sordy <br>

Where did I take a swipe at Reso? I actually said that what they did was good and even though it was not intended as a PR stunt, when someone big does something it always ends up as PR wiether you like it or not. PR stunts arent always volunteery or planned my dear. Do you think Michael Jackson wanted to be in the papers for almost dropping his kid off the balcony?? Get my point?<br>
<br>
What I said was the fact that Reso did drag 50 people through the Plane of Mischeif was great and I totally can imagine what a hard job that must of been (taking people totally new to raiding etc etc). PR intended or not, it still makes them look good <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
Whoever came up with that Idea in Reso (the cleric) deserves a pat on the back as that was a nice thing to do. And when it comes to Uber guilds, I don't have any problems with that but that still doesn't mean I think that whoever above came out with the quote &quot; I work full time and raid all week and have a social life&quot; to be a complete liar hahaha. What social life? Do you go to the cinema with a hot date in your sleep? Or maybe at lunch time? <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :p --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":p"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
Doesn't matter, I have nothing against uber guilds and will openly admit that there are times I wish I could raid that much. Just don't have the time and the time zones. Also as mentioned above, the reason I don't leave FV to join a earopean server is because I have worked too hard to get to 60 and get my friends and guild and stuff. I can;t be arsed or have the time to start that over again. I also dont have the time to get more Europeans over to FV unfortunatley <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :( --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/frown.gif ALT=":("><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
Though if there are some people out there that are looking for a niche in the uber market, then I will hint to you that there are a lot of Euros out there looking for a home.<br>

<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>I think the Open Raid Reso did was a great PR stunt and indeed made Reso more respected in my list but if you guys could do this more often, then I am sure a lot more in FV would feel more love towards you because then they would not feel belittled and also feel that you guys do indeed care for the community around you.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>

There are probably two people in Resolution that I could count on to come to my aid if I was in dire straits.  I don't know these folks, I don't hang around with them, and I, like you, am not an uber raider; my schedule also doesn't fit theirs.  There I was in Plane of Mischief, shouting loudly about my disgust at the infidels that were killing the servants of Bristlebane ( my god, ) and very few roleplayed back at me.  Oh well.  We have different agendas.  I was grateful to be along on this excursion.  There's no way, on any server, that I would have seen POM.  Find me another uber guild on another server that would lead an open raid to such an out-of-the-way zone.  You won't find it.  Say what you will about that being a &quot;PR stunt,&quot; but it doesn't change my opinion of Resolution at all.  I remain disappointed that they are not here to roleplay, but to advance their characters at all costs, but that's always been the case.  I still won't help out any of their tier'dal and iksar.<br>
<br>
Just because you missed this particular rare opportunity doesn't point to Reso not trying hard enough to be good members of the community here.  I got lucky, this raid happened at the end of my vacation from work, and it fit into my schedule.  I certainly have never felt &quot;belittled&quot; by anything FnF or Reso have ever done, none of it has ever affected me in a negative manner.  It's frustrating to me, too, on one level, that I can't raid with these folks, but that's not the game I play.  I can't sit here for 8 hours every night and do this.  I'm a casual player, in a roleplaying guild, and there's no other server on EQ I could go to that would have given me the opportunity to see PoM.  Attacking the &quot;ubers&quot; for not doing this every week still seems like a pretty weak flame to me. <br>

 I think either English is not your primary language or maybe you just like twisting words around, making your own opinion, shaking them with a bit of bullshit and then mouthing off a rant about something completly differant on the wrong tangent alltogether.<br>

First you say that I am attacking FnF and Reso and now you are saying that I am attacking ubers?? Where the fuck did you get that idea from? <br>
<br>
LET ME rephrase this as clear as i can : I THINK THAT WHAT RESO DID WAS NICE! There, see! Where do you see me flaming Reso or Ubers eh?<br>
<br>
The original post I made was in no way hinting towards a flame or a cheap attack at anyone. Where the hell did you get that from? <br>
<br>
Look up the word PR = Public Relations = <br>
<br>
Dictionary.com sez: PR = &quot; The degree of success obtained in achieving a favorable relationship with the public.  &quot; .<br>
<br>
This is NOT a flame! O.k? If you want to make a flame war with me then bring it on in the soap box. <br>

Just so long as no btich about us wiping out 6 times which with a lot of new raiders in a tough zone is easy to do.<br>
<br>
As for roleplaying...well I am sorry to say that the only means of communiction open to me is typing, with out a proof reader my command of the english lang is somewhat hampered by poor spelling ( 4 yr of collage with 3.92 GPA), but I can spell my name right with out 2 proof readers and 3 editors.  So I may feel like roleplaying, but dont want to make a bigger ass out of myself then I usually do.<br>
