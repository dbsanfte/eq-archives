He entered with a stide, that of pride..<br>Or maybe that of one that has seen much of the world, just by his walk it was known that this traveler had something different about him. This man took off his robes, reveling a Black Gi, the same symbol in red upon his right breast side. Gi, it was a Fighting Uniform for Monks.. Sweatpants with a Sweatshirt, used to enhanse Mobility instead of allow the user to stand Idle and take needless hits...<br>He took a seat, relieving his seemingly tired Self, asking the Tender for some 'Elven Wyne', before speaking out towards the croud..<br><br>&quot;This is my story.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Lanys T'Vyl has returned...&quot;<br><br>~The Eastern Wastes~<br>Lanys T'Vyl has returned.<br>That Woman, standing in the cold in a complete set of the Rubitie Armor, that Dark Red Armor gear made espically for Knights of Shadow, looked towards the Statue of the Dragon with eyes of determination. Her Strands of White flew freely thorught the icy winds as her drow head turned to her 'Chosen'. A ShadowKnight.. who we will just reffer to as..<br>The ShadowKnight.<br>The ShadowKnight simply nodded to his Matron Mother, awaitign the moment when she would unleash all hell upon Norrath..<br>And she would be known as the one that brought hate to all the world, as the True Queen of Hate..<br>Lanys held out the Key to the Tomb, and the portal accepted it.., with a quick flash, Lanys, her ShadowKnight, and all of Primodial Malice were taken into the Forbidden Tomb..<br><br>The Tomb of the Sleeper.<br><br>~Sleepers Tomb~<br><br>Lanys and her Minions pressed foward, every creature here stood no match for the Power of Lanys, and her Promidal Malice following. Tier'dal, Humans, and Half Tier'dal Half Human beings faught side by side for their Goal of World Domination, cutting down every drake, every dragon, everything that came their way..<br>((Is it pretty apparent that I've never been to Sleepers Tomb? :/))<br>And it came time to fight the 4 Warders, each powerful Dragons..<br>Guarding the most Powerful Insaintic Rage ever to rear its ugly head upon Norrath. This was their Duty, and they carried it out well..<br><br>But Not well Enough. Lanys came to the front of her people, and she did talk..<br><br>&quot;Behold my followers, the Trueness of the Power of Malice!&quot; She said, as he looked towards the First Warder to feel her power..<br><br>&quot;You fool girl, You know not what you do. Daughter of Innoruuk, your quest ends here!&quot;<br><br>&quot;..It is time.. You die!&quot; Lanys shouted as she held out a single hand..<br><br>&quot;Renzkou* Harm Touch!&quot; And that hand lit up in a rage of energy..<br>Her own energy.. and then.. it shot outwards. Many, hundreds, thousands of blasts of pure energy shot out towards the Warder, putting him deep within the grip of Agony, feeling his very Soul Burn as Lanys Advanced foward, placing her very hand upon the beast.. <br>And that made him burn all the more, energy shooting thorugh his form..<br>And by the time Lanys let up, the Dragon laid down before her in a smoldering heap of burning flesh..<br><br>She then looked towards the other Warders.. who now figured that they would have to take her at once.<br><br>The Three Dragons charged her, they had to defeat her..<br>The Sleeper could not be awakened, for all of Norrath Hung in the Balance.<br>And their bodies moved in fluid Motion. It was as if Every muscle in their body could be used as a weapon. Not a Mad dash, but controled percise movements..<br>But Lanys was too fast, too strong, too determined for them.. <br>Every Clawswipe was dodged, every whip of the tail was sidestepped, every attack Missing its Mark.<br><br>Lanys allowed her body to shrivel a bit, so that she could kick off one of the Warders, going air borne..<br>And she rose her hand once again, it glowing with her energies..<br><br>&quot;Renzkou* Harm Touch!&quot;<br><br>And she unleashed all hell upon the Dragons, her powers overcomming the three of them with this single attack, all of her Harm Touch Energies spreading out to bring the end of the Final Warders..<br>Leaving Huge Mounds of Burning Flesh in her wake.. as her body became full once again as she touched down..<br><br>&quot;Come, to Kerafyrm.&quot; And Lanys turned, walking towards her Prize.. <br>The Insane Multicolored Dragon.. slowly awaking from its Long Slumber..<br>The ShadowKnight nodded, and behind him were the legions of the Promidal Malice..<br><br>And they entered the Chamber of the Sleeper, .. Lanys reached out and slowly caressed Kerafrym's long Jawline, smiling as she looked to her New FOund Pet..<br><br>&quot;You are mine now.. Together.. we shall bring Norrath to its knees..&quot;<br><br>But Kerafyrm noticalbly disagreed, with a mighty roar, it snaped swiftly at her, but Lanys had the sence of Mind to Jump back, holding out her hand and allowing it to glow once again.<br><br>&quot;Obey Me, or be destroyed.&quot; Lanys said, calmy but forcefully as she looked directly into the creatures eyes, that cold lock, that Glare that put fear into Many others..<br><br>And Kerafyrm did lower its head.. He knew that Lanys kidded not.. Lanys walked towards the dragon and began to stroke its head.. climbing up right inbetween his eyes, resting herself there..<br><br>&quot;Good.. you are just a Young little thing in the grand scheme of things, Child Dragon. Come, I will quench your thrist for battle.<br>You. You shall take my Troops to the Mountains of Rathe. That is where it begins.<br><br>The ShadowKnight nodded, then kneeled down before his Matron Mother..<br><br>Lanys Nodded in return, and Ordered her new Dragon to Take Flight..<br>And the Dragon made its way out of his Tomb.. Striking the stone, breaking it apart untill it made its way to the surface. Then, with outsteched wings, the Sleeper took Flight with Lanys on his back.<br><br>The ShadowKnight, and with the rest of Malice awestricken..<br>And he did give the Order to turn around, and begin their trek across Velious back to the Mountains of Rathe in Anotinca..<br><br><br><br>And with the Awakening of the Sleeper, the Viel was broken..<br>Luclin finally hung over the Sky, that Ringed Moon Glimmered greatly in the sky..<br>But, that was the least of the worlds concerns..<br><br>~Arena~<br><br>And from nowhere.. a Giant Foot stoke the ground..<br>Another.. it armored with black.. riddled with blood and flesh..<br>A Huge figured, armored completly from head to toe with Dark Armor, and a Huge Sword came from out of nowhere it seemed..<br>Dark Red eyes seemed to scream for combat..<br><br>&quot;I am.. FREE. Norrath.. you shall feel the Edge of my Blade once again! Revenge is at hand! My children shall know the glory of War once again!&quot;<br><br>~And back to the Bar..~<br>&quot;And this began the end for Norrath... for all was to be lost..&quot;<br><br>&quot;That is all for now.. I will begin once again later. You may take a break..&quot;<br><br>Yotoden closed his eyes, taking a small sip of his tea..<br><br>&quot;I will begin again in about thirty Minutes, for those that wish to listen..&quot;<br><br>~Fin, Part 1~<br><br>((* Renzkou *, It means MANY in Japanese. Many Harm Touches. It is a Techinque that she used on a ShadowKnight that dared to challenge her on Innoruuk, by the name of Taurus Bedletter. She just kept HTing him, over and over till he died.)) <p><IMG SRC="http://members.aol.com/sageofthehalo/Shintou.gif">I am the Roleplaying Nazi.
