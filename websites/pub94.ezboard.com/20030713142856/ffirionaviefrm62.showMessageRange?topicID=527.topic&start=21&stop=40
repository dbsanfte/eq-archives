Nevertheless - if you are willing to argue one way...how about another.  What about abortion?  Or Interracial marriage?  Or even the ability to view pornography in the privacy of your own home?  <br>
<br>
If you believe that state rights should reign supreme, all of these things would still be illegal in one state or another.<br>

<br>
So...where's all the polygamy?  Where's all the beastiality and public sex?  Straight people like sex too, and assumedly can engage in all of these things.  And straight people were given &quot;permission&quot; to have sex decades ago. <br>
<br>
But only when bigots see that now gay people can engage in the same activities as straight people do they suddenly fear the emergence of these other activities.<br>

The ignorance of some people truly makes me sick.<br>

True enough, but I believe that people with this view would simply say: those laws exist because people in those States want them, and if they change their mind they can change them.<br>
<br>
While I am not opposed to the decision in any way, I will agree that there is some mild risk WHENEVER the Court makes a decision, because State/Federal Laws can be enacted or repealed with relative ease.  Changing the Constitution is an enormous task.<br>
<br>
If there is an implicit right to privacy, and people can do what they want in the bedroom, why is Prostitution still illegal?  Shouldn't it be decriminalized to Public Indecency for outdoor 'practicioners' and maybe Tax Evasion assuming the prostitues are not reporting income?<br>

<br>
Interracial marriage falls under the 14th Amendment for equal protection because the marriage law wouldn't be enacted the same for a black/white male/female couple.  The reason the 14th Amendment applies that the interracial couple are in the same situation as a non-mixed race couple but are being treated differently, meaning they fall under the typical marriage laws in the state but the color of their skin is dictating how they are treated regarding those laws.  It would be the same for barring people to vote because of their race.  <br>
<br>
Pornography is a 1st Amendment issue for the freedom of expression.  The same would be true if the government of a particular state decided what books you could or couldn't read.  Again, a 1st Amendment issue.<br>
<br>
I wasn't saying this ruling was going to lead to people having sex in front of children in the streets, but then again, I'm hardly suprised at your overreaction regarding it.  I said that states regulate that, and they regulate polygamy, and states regulate incest laws as well.  It's a state issue.  If you want to fix the sodomy laws, get your state legislature to repeal them.  If you want Polygamy in your state, get it passed.  If you want to be able to have sex in the street in front of kids, get it passed. If states what to prohibit alcohol, that's up to them.  Personally, I'm not going to try to regulate someone's behavior unless it adversely affects someone else in a <br>
<br>
There are definately times for the Supreme Court to hear cases, I'm just tired of them finding things in a document that clearly don't exist to further their own political agendas (no matter if I agree or disagree with them).  Intrepreting the Constitution because things have changed and the language is cloudy is one thing, intrepreting the document to further your political or social views is another.  <br>
<br>
If that means that some backwoods state doesn't have their citizens get off their ass and fix the obviously broken laws, that's what it means then.  The United States Federal Government wasn't and shouldn't be a centralized entity homogenizing the entire country.  The Constitution is clearly protection AGAINST that happening.  The States are meant to be very different from one another, for a number of reasons including that if a State government gets too tyrannical, you can move to another state that is less tyrannical.  On the other hand, if you make everything a Federal issue, where do you have to go?<br>

In my opinion, you're absolutely right. Prostitution should be legalized. If I want to become a prostitute, then I should have the freedom to sell my body and get as much as I can for it without fear of being incarcerated. I should be registered as a licensed prostitute, pay taxes on my earnings, and have a health plan which will certify my health as being clean for 6 month increments. I should be able to perform my job in a safe atmosphere, preferably in a business suite, with security guards to protect me from the lunatics. <br>
If I am a Mormon or Moslem (and believe me I'm not), I should be able to marry as many wives as I wish because I have freedom of religion and the freedom to practice it as I wish. Just as long as those women are over the age of 18, why should the government have anything to say about it?<br>
If I want to grow a pot plant in my house and use it for my own recreational use, who is the government to tell me I can't grow something that grows naturally???<br>
If I am a lesbian, who is the government to tell me I can't marry the love of my life, simply because she is a woman? On what basis do they try to legislate morality? The Bible? Not everyone believes in the Bible. There is a reason we have a distinct separation between Church and State. <br>
This decision is a step in the right direction. I applaud the justices that voted in favor of it. We are by no means anywhere close to giving gay people equal rights and protections. Hopefully one day that can be achieved. <p><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://home.insight.rr.com/kindredwolf/Shaila2.gif " style="border:0;"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showUserPublicProfile?gid=robingoodfellow>Robin Goodfellow</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://home.earthlink.net/~andersonrob/RAINBO~1.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 1403<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(6/27/03 9:25 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm62.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=527.topic&index=27>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://home.earthlink.net/~andersonrob/689americanpeacesign.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: It's about time... sodomy laws declared unconstitutional</span><hr size=1> Zeld &amp; others:<br>

You've been misled into believing the Court used the right of privacy, by itself, in this decision.  Actually, they grounded their decision in the 14th Amendment Equal Protection Clause as well as the right to privacy.  This lends it a lot more Constitutional weight than if it were simply grounded in the right to privacy found in Griswold and Roe v. Wade.<br>
<br>
The Roemer decision (Colorado case) was also grounded in the 14th Amendment Equal Protection Clause.<br>
<br>
Further, it's extremely significant that they said Bowers v. Hardwick was &quot;never correct&quot;.  The only other time they've invalidated a decision with such strong language was with Brown v. Board. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showUserPublicProfile?gid=robingoodfellow>Robin Goodfellow</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://home.earthlink.net/~andersonrob/RAINBO~1.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 1404<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(6/27/03 9:36 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm62.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=527.topic&index=28>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: It's about time... sodomy laws declared unconstitutional</span><hr size=1> My error.

But why does the Mormon church have to adjust it's religious beliefs to what the State wants? In my opinion, they should have stuck to their guns and fought it. I am not Mormon nor would I ever be Mormon because I think some of their beliefs are really hokey. However, I can defend their right to practice their religion.<br>
<br>
This aside, in Islam, a man is allowed to have up to 4 wives at a time. Who is the government to tell him he can't practice his religion as he sees fit? If a Moslem man decides to immigrate here with his 4 wives, why would the government refuse to recognize this 5 way marriage? <br>

We don't really practice what we preach as Americans. We are proud that we have freedom of religion, but as you can see, we really don't. We say liberty and justice for all, but gays still can't do something as basic as marry each other. I just hope that we continue to strive for equality. <p><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://home.insight.rr.com/kindredwolf/Shaila2.gif " style="border:0;"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showUserPublicProfile?gid=twotribes>Twotribes</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/white_fire.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Board Troll</span><br>  Posts: 865<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(6/29/03 2:09 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm62.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=527.topic&index=31>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: It's about time... sodomy laws declared unconstitutional</span><hr size=1> Freedom of religion doesnt obsolve you of obeying the law.

The society mores and rules apply, and claiming some off the wall religion doesnt make it ok to ignore those laws. There are some pretty screwed up practices in some of the more crazy so called religions, shall we allow them to dictate what the law should be?<br>
<br>
As for the So called Mormons that practice Pologamy still, most dont marry legal age women after the first. The majority marry 16 year old girls that are sisters or relatives of friends or wives. Some get them promised to them at 14. The state generally doesnt prosecute these fringe dwellers unless they have caught them violating that as well as Pologamy.<br>

Islam says to cut off the hand of a thief, shall we in our zeal at protecting freedom of religion allow that too? <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showUserPublicProfile?gid=spiritofstick>SpiritOfStick</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>The Ominator</span><br>  Posts: 699<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(6/29/03 8:11 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm62.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=527.topic&index=32>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: It's about time... sodomy laws declared unconstitutional</span><hr size=1> Okay, it's been said we have no &quot;right&quot; to privacy.<br>

<br>
Bill of Rights, Ratified December 15, 1791<br>
<br>
Article IV<br>
<br>
&quot;The right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be violated, and no Warrants shall issue, but upon probable cause, supported by Oath or affirmation, and particularly describing the place to be searched, and the persons or things to be seized.&quot;<br>
<br>
No right to privacy?  What does &quot;Secure in their persons, houses, papers and effects&quot; mean to you?<br>
<br>
Just thought I'd mention that.  I realize that Article IV was part of the court's reasoning...but I'd like that cleared up.<br>
<br>
I'm told daily about the &quot;no right to privacy&quot; thing when I have the Bill of Rights framed on my wall, and I dunno about you, but that's how _I_ see Article IV being interpreted.<br>

If you're going to declare something Unconstitutional, you'd best have Constitutional ground to stand on.  Meaning, if you want to say that the law violated the 1st Amendment right to Freedom of Expression, then say that.  Don't twist the document to mean what you want, read what it says and base it off of that.  The did use the due process clause from the 14th Amendment (by the way that's the 4th Amendment, not article 5) and .  Article five describes the process of amending the Constitution.  If you want to claim that the Court had jurisdiction over this case, you could find that out in Article 3.  <br>
<br>
What you are saying is &quot;The right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects&quot;.  That's dandy... why don't you put the whole sentece in there instead of quoting it out of context?  The whole sentence is <br>

They are saying that due process was not used in removing the liberty of sodomy.  I'd argue that due process was used in the case, that the participants received a trial and appeal.  The court disagrees with me, and that's fine, but anything can be defined as a liberty.  I'd argue that sex acts are a liberty, but no where in there does it prescribe a right to privacy, and that's part of what this and Roe vs. Wade was based off of.  <br>

 <br>
Another note in the declaration is the truth: The law in question was being used in a prejudicial manner- homosexuals were being prosecuted for sodomy,and heterosexual acts of sodomy were not. For example,these two men were charged and convicted. However,a case where a prostitute was caught performing anal sex with a john usually wasn't-the law was being used to punish homosexuality,rather than sodomy.<br>
 <br>
It might have been illegal for some attractive woman to perform fellatio on me in Texas,but the cops sure as heck wouldn't have charged me with sodomy if they busted down my door and found me and my wife in the act. More than likely,they'd have turned around while I got my pants up and apologized for disturbing me!<br>
<br>
Indeed,that was something the Court noted in throwing out precedent in this manner-that the basis of anti-sodomy laws in the US and even beforehand has been to punish people for acts of sodomy with a partner that is being forced to do so,cannot legally consent,or is unable to consent (for example,sodomizing a child,animal,or engaging in an act of sodomy with an unwilling adult of either sex). The Texas law had no such grounds to stand on.<br>
<br>
It was a bad law,and got exactly what it deserved.<br>

<br>
I absolutely agree.  Although it might have been better if they used a slightly different rationale in the reasons for striking it.  Any of the ones you mentioned, for example, would have worked just as fine.<br>
<br>
Although I certainly don't expect it to happen...  Why can't I smoke Crack in the privacy of my bedroom?  If I am not committing any other crimes, shouldn't that be a privacy issue?<br>
<br>
Also, Laws against Suicide are Moral ones, not legal issues.

<br>
Yes, the sodomy laws are arbitrary and should not be on the books anywhere.  However, the people of Texas should be the ones to decide the outcome of this law, not the Supreme Court.  <br>
<br>
If the people of Texas want to ban people for, say, smoking on public streets, they should be allowed to do so. Should enough Texans this the law is stupid, it is their responsibility to write their senator.  If enough people write, and the senator ignores them, then said senator will not have another term in office.  <br>
<br>
With this sodomy case, more pressure should have been applied to the DA's office for prosecuting it in the first place.  Also, the DA should have prosecuted the neighbor for lying to the police in their report which justified the search of the couple's home.  <br>
<br>
The concern of us on right side of the spectrum (or myself at least) is not the moral dangers of sodomy. Personally, I couldn't care less about what couples do behind locked doors.  My concern is that we are giving too much power to the Federal Gov't, and taking power away from the State.  Allowing the SC to step outside of its authority is doing a great evil for a greater good, which is something, I'm sorry to say, is not something I'm entirely comfortable with.  Especially when there is a perfectly viable alternative.   <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showUserPublicProfile?gid=jullietstarshooter>julliet starshooter</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 50<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(6/30/03 10:00 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm62.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=527.topic&index=38>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: It's about time... sodomy laws declared unconstitutional</span><hr size=1> Twotribes:<br>

Also, if you want to use the example of cutting off a person's hand for a crime, you might as well quote religious Judeo-Christian law that the two men cited in this court case should have been stoned to death and not just charged with a misdemeanor.   <p><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://home.insight.rr.com/kindredwolf/Shaila2.gif " style="border:0;"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showUserPublicProfile?gid=twotribes>Twotribes</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/white_fire.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Board Troll</span><br>  Posts: 866<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(6/30/03 3:07 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm62.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=527.topic&index=39>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: It's about time... sodomy laws declared unconstitutional</span><hr size=1> Stoneing is NO LONGER practiced.
