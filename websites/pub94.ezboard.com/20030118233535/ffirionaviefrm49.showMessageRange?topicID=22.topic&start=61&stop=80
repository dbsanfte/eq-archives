<br>
Tinkin for example ebayed.<br>
<br>
Tinkin sells toon to  for lets say 1000 american dollars.<br>
<br>
Shazzy strips off a bunch of stuff, piles up Tinkins plat, and empties the bank of sellables and plops that all onto an ebay sight or sells to regular customers.<br>
<br>
Shazzy makes back the 1000 american dollars and then some.<br>
<br>
Shazzy then can &quot;use that toon&quot; or can easily sell Tinkin the  epic'd level 61-62 cleric for 500-1000 more american dollars to her clientel.  (remember you can transfer to any other server from FV).<br>
<br>
It doesnt take a Rocket scientist to figure out why Shazzy does it.  Shazzy just made 2x what Shazzy put into it.....probably in a month.  Nice tidy profit.<br>
<br>
The real question is can anyone SO, VI or whomever, do anything about it??  I somehow dont think so.  Shazzy is so blatent, so out in the open about it that I would have thought the axe would have been driven home by now.  <br>
<br>
So the next real question is, why arent more people doing it?  If I was in college right now (been 10 years) and playing this game....an extra $1000 dollars a month would have been AWESOME.  Of course I would have flunked out because EQ is way too addicting lol and I wouldnt get any studying done.<br>
<br>
Oh well....seen it coming and here it is.<br>

<br>
Tinkin sells toon to for lets say 1000 american dollars.&quot;<br>
<br>
Unheard of for any server other than FV.  $1000 is a high price for any EQ player, especially a cleric.<br>
<br>
&quot;Shazzy strips off a bunch of stuff, piles up Tinkins plat, and empties the bank of sellables and plops that all onto an ebay sight or sells to regular customers.<br>
<br>
Shazzy makes back the 1000 american dollars and then some.&quot;<br>
<br>
$1000 worth of gear is hard to come by on a cleric.  The no-nodropness of this server overcomes that, but it is still hard to sell gear because this is FV--we are a small server with few ubers and with fewer people who want to invest actual money into a server that is so far behind others.<br>
<br>
I doubt Tinkin was worth $1000 in just pure gear, but I could be wrong.  Melee's are definitely the way to go if you want money.<br>
<br>
&quot;Shazzy then can &quot;use that toon&quot; or can easily sell Tinkin the epic'd level 61-62 cleric for 500-1000 more american dollars to her clientel. (remember you can transfer to any other server from FV)&quot;<br>
<br>
A level 61-62 cleric, epic or not, sells for maybe a few hundred dollars.  Again, FV artificially inflates that, but a naked lv60 toon sells in the realm of 200 dollars everywhere else.<br>
<br>
------------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
Not saying that it is impossible to make money this way, but it is only possible on FV.  You can buy a NTOV/SSRA/VT geared and keyed person for less than $1000 else where.  Tinkin is a bad example because he has very few sellables.  Rohal or Ramel on the other hand had the potential to be gold mines.<br>

<br>
Months ago when someone made a comment about our posts and Reso_player1 flamed it, it was moved to the proper forum, But this time it was not handled that way. If you wanna warn him about his flaming ok, you wanna warn him about personal attacks ok, but my point was warning him because he posted in the wrong forum is hella lame.<br>
<br>
There are people on this board who are worshiped who do alot worse than Xarpolis both on this board and In game. But they are treated alot different, yet it seems Xarpolis is being made an example out of. I once didnt have a fond opinion of him, but I have recently put those differences behind me and actually took the time to get to know them and he is a pretty good guy.<br>
<br>
As for being disapointed in me Sar, Well Im sorry its just how I feel about this, I dont like apep, never really have never prolly will. I think he runs this board with a double standard which tries to revolve around himself, and I am not afraid to disagree with him. There has been things you(Sarhea) have said on this board which has disapointed me most recently, But I choose not to say it in public. Thank you for doing so.<br>
<br>
I did post I wasnt going to post or read these boards here but after a month or more not doing so. I thought maybe they deserve a chance. Way to prove me wrong!<br>
<br>
I think Moderators have a tuff job and in the past I said I would pat them on the back and I still do. But certain things to tick me off and when they do I will express them. No they are not perfect, but it seems like Your trying to make an example out of someone for *posting in the wrong forum* and I think thats a pretty weak reason. When acts like that prolly happen everyday on this board. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon3.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showUserPublicProfile?gid=sarhea>Sarhea</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_redspot.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Slave to Dvara<br>Tits of Steel Admin<br>Its always that time .......</span><br>  Posts: 2090<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(11/6/02 6:52:26 pm)</font><br>     <br>ezSupporter<br> <BR><img src=http://sarshouse.homestead.com/files/images/Sarhea_Nah_Nah.gif height=99, width=42></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Xarpolis you burning bag of dung Part 2</span><hr size=1> Ok, Bako. I don't base my mod descisions(one day I will learn how to spell that frelling word*bleh*) on what so and so will think of me, when I am done.<br>
<br>
I know you don't like Apep. You've made that abundantly clear, and you're welcome to that. He's a hard guy to like.*shrug*<br>
<br>
For the record, since it seems to be unclear to people, and I can't speak for the rest of the moderators, or Apep...<br>
<br>
I don't know or care about Xarpolis. <br>
I don't know Fuvi, so no, I'm not cyboring him.<br>
I don't know Heagan, but I like the way he speaks his piece.<br>
I don't know Kzan, but I think I like the way he presents himself.<br>
I don't know Rollen, but he's a halfelf, so that gives him bonus points.<br>
<br>
<br>
And I wouldn't hesitate to bitch at any one of them, when the fuck up.<br>
<br>
Had we moved that thread(and I thought about it), I think there would have been way more yelling, than just telling Xarp to settle down.<br>
<br>
Now, if there's anything else, please let me know.<br>

<br>
His warning wasn't for posting in the wrong forum, people do that all the time.  Sometimes by accident (not looking where they're posting), sometimes intentionally (because more people read &quot;General Chat&quot; than &quot;Events&quot;). <br>
<br>
His warnings were for hitting below the belt.  He thinks Reso has a BS guild advertisement?  Fine, come to Soapbox and post about it.  He thinks Reso is lame for noting that they killed Avatar of war?  Fine, come to Soapbox and post about it.  <br>
<br>
But posting his flames right on their thread doesn't fly.  Yeah, we could move the whole thread to Soapbox, which starts a whole stupid trend of you guys flaming eachother's accomplishments and guild adverts so that they all end up in here instead of out there.  Sorry, not going that route. <br>
<br>
Even Ermok &amp; Kurley almost always post their jokes in here -vs- out there, and when they do post out there they make a new thread -vs- adding a reply to the other guild's.   Xarp knows full well where the soapbox is, he's posted in it before.  He doesn't need to go wandering around vandalizing other parts of the board to get his point across.<br>

Sensative?  I bet.. Seems someone who said you would get more satisfaction from a tampon up your ass than you would get out of this game was right.<br>
<br>
So?  How much? give us the details.. I heard of your selling and been waiting for your gear to hit the market and see some just being posted about an hour ago.  Maybe not yours but help us out here..  Give us some details .. =)<br>
<br>
Best of luck to you.<br>
<br>
PS.. Xarp is still a .. well /points to the subject.<br>
When you two go away this server will be better place.  Go away in style just stfu and dissapear.  Or entertain me at work.. Either way im happy.<br>

He once posted that there was never any talk about Reso and FnF doing stuff togethor too, but I have the e-mail I sent to one of his officers not to mention the log of it. I think he's just the loud, pompous figure head and Rollen is the real brains behind the operation. <p><!--EZCODE FONT START--><span style="font-family:Arial;"> <!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=220314" target="top">Kzan Verto</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--><!--EZCODE BR START--><br /><!--EZCODE BR END-->Giver of da Juice<!--EZCODE BR START--><br /><!--EZCODE BR END--> Member of <!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.fireandfury.org" target="top">Fire and Fury</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--><!--EZCODE BR START--><br /><!--EZCODE BR END--><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://www.fireandfury.org/sigs/Kzan.jpg"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--> </span><!--EZCODE FONT END--></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showUserPublicProfile?gid=coinfist>Coinfist</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 301<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(11/7/02 12:50:52 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Simple mistake</span><hr size=1> That the best you have Kzan?

Let him stand up for himself. He has let you down enough.  <br>
