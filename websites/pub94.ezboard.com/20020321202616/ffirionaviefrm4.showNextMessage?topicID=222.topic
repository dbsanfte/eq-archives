<br>
I bounded off to the halfling camps and began slaying the lot of them.  The Hafling city was fully popped and I cleaved my way thru the lot of them....chasing a few down as they ran screaming &quot;AAhhhh its Ichi....run!!&quot;  I then made my way to the other camps and made quick work of them.  Upon returning to the first camp I noticed a human monk with grey hair sitting there.  He had a corpse a few feet from the camp when I had arrived the first time.  I stopped and looked around.  He was obviously not killing the halflings so I began to splatter halfling blood and guts all over the vicinity.  Among the hafling screams came a sharp comment from the human....1 word actually....&quot;F..k.r!&quot;<br>
<br>
I not missing a beat continued the onslaught and commented back with.. &quot;Im sorry, where you killing these halflings?&quot;  He aswered that he wasnt and that I should taking my $#%#$^% stinky #$%# and leave!  An onslaught of foul language which I dont feel is RPing ensued from him.  I told him in role play to watch his mouth or id rip it off and shove it someplace not nice.  After a couple more comments instructed him to shut the face.  I then offered to duel him after some empty threats were made on his part.  He declined and ran off.<br>
<br>
I continued killing and eventually returned to this camp to find him sitting there again.  I killed the halflings and left again without too much comment from him.  I returned a bit later and he was dead...lying by the empty camp.<br>
<br>
I chuckled in spite of myself.  I was going to wait and RP some seriously funny stuff as he looted his corpse....but the RL nice guy behind the screen took over (DAMN HIM....Ichi shakes fist at his RL master) and I logged for the evening.<br>
<br>
Just a little tidbit to share.<br>
<br>
Foul language like that is not RPing.  Find a more literate way to communicate.  It makes for a more reasonable atmosphere.  In all likelihood I would have left if he had....but he was an ass so I didnt.<br>

I do not condone the use of foul language, in fact I agree with my ichy friend about it. However, RP is how you define RP within the scope of the universe. Perhaps this monk is a very nice person in RL, but wants to let loose in a fantasy game and defines a real jerk as a character. That is his right, in fact it is what makes the FV server so unique. Everyone who has an RP character is unique. I may find it strange that a 45 year old bald fat man wants to RP some &quot;sexy&quot; woolf elf female, not my business. I may not like the Ranger who will not group with me because he like to be alone. I may not like the big Orgres and Trolls who kill my halfling friends, but as long as they play by the rules, more power to them.<br>
<br>
 This server is so unique. If you have forgotten then just go to the Sony message boards and read for 10 minutes. We just cannot seem to be happy, however, unless we tell other people how to RP. <br>
<br>
 I am not condeming you Ichi, I am just using this as another chance to preach RP tolerance. If you want to complain that this person is a cad, or they were rude, etc that is fine. Please do not just label this as an RP issue.<br>
<br>
 My Motto: My RP = OK; Your RP = OK, NO RP = OK!<br>
<br>
<br>
 Lastly, since we can all turn on our foul language filter, you actually never need to see the real language unless you have chosen to. <br>

This is a game.  A role-playing game, but still a game.<br>
<br>
Not everything is automatically acceptable simply because someone is, or even might be, role-playing.  That's just absurd.  Role-playing *Game*.  Every game has rules of reasonable conduct.  The point of soccer (football, to all you Europeans) may be to get the ball into the net, but you aren't allowed to kick the goalie in the head to do it, even if that may serve the point of the game.  There are proper ways to do things and there are improper ways to do things.  And over the top profanity lands firmly on my list of improper ways to RP.<br>
<br>
No, I can't impose this.  I don't even try, except by choosing who I will and won't RP with.  But I stand by anyone's right to say &quot;this conduct doesn't belong in my vision of this game.&quot;  And if it's something that is backed up by the rules of Norrath, I stand by their right to report it and get something done about it.  RP is not a universal excuse to do any damn thing you please, especially things that would never get accepted in any other context.  And anyone who thinks it is probably needs to sort out their issues somewhere other than in my gaming environment.<br>

<br>
Seriously, I agree that RP is not carte blanche to behave in a manner that is unacceptable. Examples of that are harassment, griefing, KS, spam, etc. We all know the dance.<br>
<br>
However, while it may be difficult for you to accept, RP is also tha ability to behave in a manner different from your normal mode of response. Otherwise we have to be content with Necros that speak kindly (in acceptable RP Aulde Englishe of course) to all and gladly help little halflings with corpse retrievals. BAH. <br>
<br>
I will respect your right to RP, or not RP for that matter, in any manner you wish right up to the point where you violate the enforced rules of the game. Note that I said enforced. If Verant does not think something is important enough to discipline, why should I. <br>
<br>
I do not like profanity. I do not practice profanity in RL or RP, frankly I am not that good at it. If you want to use profanity towards me or someone else that is your right. Just do not harass, spam, etc. The RL is full of people with different sets of morality, why shouldn't FV be the same way?<br>
<br>
If you want a world that exactly conforms to your ideas of RP morality, then may I suggest Sid Mier's Civilization series. It is a wonderful game that is quite challanging. I have enjoyed it for years. It also has the advantage of not having other people around to actually have to interact with.  Turn the &quot;Heralds&quot; on and it actually seems like there are other players around.<br>

<br>
I respect the person behind the screen.<br>
<br>
Profanity while I'm more than happy to use it on folks I know and who have deviated from some set path or inconveinced me. I follow it up with a ooc comment to let them know it was strictly a character thing. If I don't know the person then I don't care I leave them be and am polite ( however I'm polite to High Elves strictly OOC ). <br>
<br>
Profanity can be roleplay, but it can also just be rude to the person behind the screen. So while I'm more than happy to curse at the guildy asking for falling in love with a wood elf or something odd. I'm not going to walk upto generic High Elf X and curse them out.<br>
<br>
There are alot of better ways to interact than profanity for profanities sake, however some times it can be called for.<br>

<br>
That much being said, I think profanity is okay between friends, certainly, when it can be understood in context.  And a few private tells can really help smooth the way to figuring out if the other party is up for some serious RP or not.  But any encounter that opens with it, without warning or explanation, is probably going to get someone a one-way ticket to my ignore list.  Again, I can't and don't try to make rules for the whole server, I just exert my right to not have certain kinds of &quot;RP&quot; around me.<br>

It is not open to debate, it is a violation of the POLICY as established and agreed to by everyone that clicks that box &quot;I agree&quot; when logging on.<br>
<br>
Now having said that..... If you make words that are within the realm of Norrath and not patently offensive in real life, NOW that is acceptable.<br>
<br>
Verant has repeatedly stated that the language filter is NOT inplace to allow the use of real world offensive / foul words to be used. It is there to try to block them when set for that, but it does not allow them to be used.<br>
<br>
There are many many creative ways to tell some one to F*&amp;( off. And they are acceptable when done in a way that doesnt include the known offensive words.<br>
<br>
This is another example of something that simply falls into the &quot;you are not permitted by the rules&quot; section. Just like you are not allowed to block a passage so people cant pass and claim you are roleplaying.  Or train the city Guards on someone. Or Many other examples of things that simply are against the policy of the Owner of the Game engine.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=dalninil>Dalninil</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 105<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(1/14/02 6:55:21 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=215.topic&index=10>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Killing halflings for faction</span><hr size=1> ROFL TwoTribes , which is why none of that ever happens, <br>

The point is that it is AGAINST the policy of Verant.<br>
<br>
What does that mean?<br>
<br>
It means if you do it and are caught you WILL be punished. No amount of &quot;but I was roleplaying&quot; will change that fact.<br>
<br>
It means that using the arguement &quot;I am roleplaying&quot; doesnt change the fact that it is NOT allowed.<br>
<br>
It means that when someone DOES complain about the use of foul language that the response &quot;dont tell me how to roleplay&quot; doesnt apply.<br>
<br>
I do so enjoy the arguement that your only breaking the rules IF you get caught. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/uroninsenshi.showPublicProfile?language=EN>RoninSenshi</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://members.aol.com/sageofthehalo/Kanji.jpg" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Senshi No Adakia</span><br>  Posts: 244<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(1/15/02 9:32:02 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=215.topic&index=15>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   You're right.</span><hr size=1> Their are many different words you can use In Character instead of saying 'Die you #$@#$%# pale'.<br>

Yeah, I know. Last night I posted all kinds of Profanity, and I was wrong to do so. If I could edit it now, I would.<br>
<br>
Profanity in Roleplaying. I may use some when reffering to like, non people things. Like 'Damn this Wolf is strong'. or things of that Nature. When I'l fighting Duels or talking with Lightbringers (Which is usually an argument <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :p --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":p"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> ) I try to hold back the Heavy curses. 'S n F'.<br>

You don't have to curse to Roleplay evil, mean,rude or angry, and by all means please do no use Old English when you roleplay ( I really hate it, but thats just my personal preference).<br>
<br>
The hole roleplay freedom debate has NOTHING to do with cursing, which is...<br>
<br>
A) Rude <br>
B) Unnecessary ( no matter HOW your trying to RP )<br>
C) a Violation.<br>
<br>
That is JUST as lame as the people who used to offer to drag your corpse for you, then Loot it clean and claim &quot;hey I'm roleplaying a theif!&quot;. Well.... maybe not quite as lame as that <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

*giggle!*  I posed that one because it was less nasty than my usual response for beggars...  &quot;Go beg from a guard, they love that!&quot;<br>
<br>
The thing is, I swear while playing EQ.  A lot.  See, I learned to swear while I was a Propsmistress and a dialogue-related prop disappeared just before the curtain raised for Act 2.  Given my love for alliteration, and that the missing prop was a fork, you can imagine why one of the actors told me I would have made a sailor blush.<br>
<br>
Kimaya's personality is as extreme as mine is, so she swears too.  But because I don't believe in swearing in public, I keep having to come up with new phrases to vent frustration without using the usual four-letters.<br>
<br>
After getting used to it, I heartily recommend it!  The energy expended in coming up with stuff to say really cools me off! <p>---<BR>
