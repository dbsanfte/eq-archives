You got it punk!</span><hr size=1> Just to jump in on pottery, since this is a pet peive of mine.<br>
<br>
1)  Golden Tunare Idols, currently selling at 1500pp.  Average inter server price... 3kpp.  Admittedly the average inter server price on Iron Oxides is 1kpp, and the few potters on this server have kept that down, thus lowering prices.  None the less, the total cost of the PotC items on Firiona Vie from potters is noticeably less than the price elsewhere.<br>
<br>
2)  Opal Steins.  Yeah, they cost about 40-50pp to make.  They save the buyer 1kpp and more.  And yet people whine that 250pp is too much?  Excuse me?  Potter makes 200pp, you make thousands, and yer whining about that?  I mean, I use one Opal Stein (with my other gear I can soft cap Charisma with just one) and it saves me 200pp every time I purchase a new load of Star Rubys for tradeskilling.  200pp per purchase.  That one Opal Stein has saved me thousands of platinum in pottery goods alone (the savings everytime I buy the two stacks of saphires necessary to work on gate stones is enourmous).  If I had bought that item, as a dropped item, for 1kpp, thus giving the seller 1kpp, I still would have come out way ahead.  I certainly don't begrudge the tinker that charged me 1600pp for my gearlock smithing hammer... sure, she gained maybe 1kpp on the deal, but I saved more than that in not needing to gain the additional 10 skill points.<br>
<br>
Ya see, the way I see it is this.  If I'm tradeskilling away, I could be using that time to hunt.  Maybe killing cyclopses in OOT.  Maybe Sebilis.  Maybe some other place.  I could be gaining both exp and loot.  Thus, for it to be worth my time to tradeskill, I should be able to make more cash per unit time than I could running around looking for a group, finding one, and playing a while... to make up for the fact that I'm not getting exp.  So yeah, I should make decent money at tradeskilling... I'm doing a service, and getting paid for it.  I'm not sure why people think there's some certain amount of profit I have to get when I make the items... I price my items based on usefulness to the buyer.  This means some items I don't make... they just won't pay me enough, if I charge the buyer what it's worth to them.  I don't make Periodot Steins, for example.  <br>
<br>
And don't get me started on the concept that all items MUST be priced at twice their construction cost.  That's downright silly.  I've I'd priced my first Gatestones at twice cost to make, they would have been 16kpp each, and Star Ruby Steins would have been about 3700pp each (my first batch were 7k for 4).  But I knew the items weren't worth that to a buyer, so I didn't charge that much.  As my skill improved, I succeeded more, and the cost for me to make em got better... but that didn't improve or weaken the product in any way.  So Star Ruby Steins started at 2kpp each, because that was the inter server average at the time and it seemed reasonable, even though I made perhaps 250pp per stein sold and risked far more than that.  And gate stones were 10k, also the average at the time.  I didn't think that the Golden Diety Idol inter server average sounded right... they were running at 4kpp to 5kpp, but that just wasn't what I thought buyers should pay, considering the price of a Grodan's and Gorganga Idol.  So I said they were worth 1500pp... even though non Tunare Idols averaged 1350pp each at the time I set that price.  And when I priced Opal Steins... they were selling for 1kpp on other servers.  My skill went up, but I wasn't about to lower my price when I couldn't keep the darn things in stock... I'd make a batch of twenty, sell it out, make a new batch, and go hunting... people would send me tells for the things, and I'd ask them to come to me... and they would.  Tons of them.  And bought out whole batches in a night's hunting.  So yeah, I was selling for 250pp, and it was well worth it, as evidenced by the many people who sent me tells later saying how it had saved them so much money.<br>
<br>
So instead of saying an item should sell for an amount based on the making price, let's talk about what things should sell for based on value to the buyer.  <br>
<br>
Opal Steins:  25 charisma 10 mana.  Most charisma you can get on a primary or secondary item outside NToV and the GM tools.  Without knowing cost to make, what would this cost?  I doubt before the tradeskill patch anyone would have said less than 500pp.  I know that since they sold for 1kpp to enchanters when they first came out... and the enchanters were buying them in droves.  Except on Firiona Vie, were they never cost that much.  Now they sell for 50 to 100pp, though most folks who were making them stopped when the price bottomed out to as little as 25pp each.<br>
<br>
Star Ruby Steins:  20 mana 10 to all saves 5 charisma.  With blue diamond costs skyrocketing, resist gear ain't so cheap.  With two slots you can get 20 to all resists... admittedly these are slots you can put good things in, but that's still great caster resist gear, and helps you get an earing that's amazingly powerful for it's low price.  If that were a dropped item, how much would it sell for?  I know HQ Kodiak Pelts run 500 to 1kpp, and they're a very small part of a decent ring that even after a lot of work isn't as good as the Earing of the Solcetice.  And they don't have any effects in and of themselves.<br>
<br>
Golden Idol of Rallos Zek:  10 ac 9 str 5 sta 20 hp.  Range slot.  Tons of hitpoints for a warrior, plus great AC. What would that run at, if not made by a tradeskill?  Though admittedly these sell out as fast as I can make em, which is slow.<br>
<br>
Gatestones.  Unlimited charges gate to home city.  Pretty darned cool.  Yet I had people jumping me for charging 10k... when the first ones I made cost me as much as 8k each.  Sure, I should have waited to make them later, but I had people saying they wanted em.  So I made em, then had people after me for price gouging.  Ugh.  Took the price down as I skilled up, and still had people saying I was charging too much.  UGH!<br>
<br>
And of course Crucibles.  Damn.  Unlimited charges of evac... if it were a rare dropped item I imagine people would be quite happy.  But these are selling for 395pp each now.  By the way they cost maybe 70pp to make... but require fishing in Sebilis, making a 170 skill fishing combine, a high skill baking combine, farming greenies for a long time in the Gorge of King Xorb, and buying unstackable items in Surefall.  Right, I want to spend a few hours to make that much.  No!  If I'm in Sebilis, I'd rather kill some froggies, thank you much!<br>
<br>
Oh well, just had to get that off my chest.<br>
<br>
But to the original poster... don't kill the prices for everyone just because someone pisses you off.  Just flame the person and be done with it.  You start a huge price war, you hurt all the makers... then the buyers expect those prices always, and everyone leaves the buisiness, and no one's making the items anymore, and it's just pesky.  Just flame to get your aggressions out!<br>
<br>
Besides, I want some Constitutionals on the market.  I haven't seen any!  And all this ranting has made my throat itch.<br>

I don't think you should be one to comment on how nice and reasonable your prices are.  After playing on several servers, IMHO, I can say you have some of the most inflated prices anywhere.  For instance, I noticed you selling fire opal wedding rings for 1500.  These are easy to make and typically run 450-500p including a 50% markup after failures.<br>
<br>
S'ok to charge whatever you want and make as much as you can, but crying crocodile tears here won't convince me to buy from you when I can buy tradeskill items from another for a lot less.  'Course if I was in a hurry for some odd reason, I might buy from you, but that's unlikely with the plethora of folks selling at much better prices. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/uxenojones.showPublicProfile?language=EN>XENOJONES</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#A62A2A>(9/13/02 1:57 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm49.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=16.topic&index=33>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: You want it?

My statement about guild chefs taking care of me was only that you should rant against them for giving their stuff away for free otherwise I might buy more from the open market. People can sell stuff for whatever they want to as long as they are being responsible to the game. IMHO baking is not a vital to the game skill, but for roleplaying it is nice.

Look, I don't *want* to start a price war. I agree that it would suck for all tradeskillers involved. We've already nuked the Demi-Sec market (and Azhrei,  your cost-to-create estimate's a little low, closer to 30 [opal and gold bar]). The odd bottle will trickle out at 200, assuming the buyer's motivated enough. I find most of the people who are habitual PotC'ers are looking more at 150. My gripe was that I was trying *not* to screw things up for everyone, and some d00d (a halfling dr00d, amusingly enough) insisted on undercutting whomever had the lowest price. I retaliated last night, and they appeared to not be online when I got on this morning. We'll see how things look when I get home after dinner. In the meantime, I reset my retail price to match the other person selling in the Bazaar at the time, because they deserve to sell their Demi-Sec just as much as I do, and while I <!--EZCODE UNDERLINE START--><u>could</u><!--EZCODE UNDERLINE END--> sell for less to take a bigger marketshare, I would rather just share the market.<br>
<br>
At any rate some responses:<br>
<br>
Dorphen: You don't like the markup? <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> You</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> go spend 9 hours doing a nine-item combine with a non-stackable container, and then you can make your own. My wrists will never be the same again.<br>
<br>
Azhrei: One thing you didn't include was (as Jarkell pointed out) the <!--EZCODE UNDERLINE START--><u>value</u><!--EZCODE UNDERLINE END--> of the item. If I tried to sell a +5 WIS, +5 INT, +5 DEX, +5 AGI belt for 10PP, I would be hunted down and summarily shot by the tradeskill community. Some of these stat beverages are pretty nice. I think the mark-ups, while higher in percentage than JC, are reasonable, given the relatively low cost of the components. I should think that having +6 STR and +6 STA would be worth 10PP to a struggling tank (or even a successful one).<br>
<br>
Kiron: I do have fun -- crafting. Where my enjoyment typically stops is when I walk into the Bazaar and set up for Trader and start eyeballing the other prices to make sure I'm not out-of-line with the market.<br>
<br>
Jarkell: heh, I'm <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> still</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> trying to recover the cost of my corking device. Too bad Demi-Sec doesn't require it, it would eliminate a lot of the competition...People are already asking me when I'm going to go for a Grandmaster Trophy, and I just snickered; I've never seen that much money at once (gem costs).<br>

You got it punk!</span><hr size=1> The idea that Opal steins are selling for 40-50pp on other servers is rubbish. I bought 3 for 22pp each from a vendor called &quot;Steins&quot; (presumably &quot;Steins'R'Us&quot; got rejected) on another server. The vendor had 60 for sale. <br>
<br>
The problem here is that this is an item on the mainline skilling route which does not stack. You either vendor them (a horrible idea) or sell them off cheap to clear space. This should be especially true on FV as we do not have alts to pass them off to. <br>
<br>
On that server I have seen tradeskilled items at less than manufactured cost - eg. Silver ruby veil 100pp. Now that is not an item anyone makes for skilling so unless it was a dropped ruby used casually then I consider such pricing stupid.<br>
<br>
The other issue is how much time you want to spend in the bazaar. I tradeskill partly for enjoyment, and partly for quest-related skills. If I ever make a profit I will be happily surprised. My motivation then, is to get whatever I have made shifted fast and get back out on the hunt or whatever. If I had a second account and a permanent connection then leaving a trader on 24/7 waiting for the &quot;market&quot; price might make sense. If I just filled my bank with something I need to move it fast so I can keep on skilling. <br>
<br>
Motivation varies and profit is not always the reason people do things. One story I treasure on that theme is the woman who sold a Jaguar (car) for £10 - it was her ex-husbands car and she had been directed to &quot;sell it and send him the proceeds&quot; <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> .<br>

As for this arguement of &quot;value to the consumer&quot;, its BS as far as I'm concerned.  I get my wisdom to 255, so what value is a QAT to me?  I have sub 100 strength and stamina, I get more benefit from a grobb meat milkshake.   And the stein arguement Jarkell always uses, about saving &quot;thousands of platinum&quot;.  What if the person who buys the stein only uses it to buy bread and water, and sell the occasional piece of fine steel?  What if they buy it for look only, or as part of their roleplay background?   Tell me how that is even remotely close to being the same &quot;value&quot; that someone else would get that is using it to buy multiple stacks of velium bars.   The whole point is, value is subjective.  Trying to set your price based upon the absolute pinnacle of value/usage that someone could get out of the item, and forcing everyone that might use the item to pay that price, is unfair and unjustified.  I'm sorry, the majority of people that buy opal encrusted steins aren't buying full stacks of velium bars and star rubies. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/uxenojones.showPublicProfile?language=EN>XENOJONES</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#A62A2A>(9/13/02 10:43 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm49.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=16.topic&index=38>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: You want it?

<br>
&quot;Historically/RL, the only time a product is sold at an obscene profit margin, is when that product is a monopoly.&quot;<br>
<br>
Really?  So CDs sell for $1 at my local store?  Yahoo!<br>
<br>
Last time I check a large pop at McDonals wasn't 10 cents despite the existence of a Burger King across the street.  <br>
<br>
Profit margin takes into account a LOT more than cost to make.  And it should with tradeskills as well.<br>
<br>
&quot;Blessed Fishing Pole, cost to make at 200 skill 125 - 500 plat depending if you can forage or not. Time to make: 30-60 minutes if you forage components yourself, 15 minutes if you buy them in Bazaar; priced accordingly as above. Price in bazaar 1500 - 2500 plat.&quot;<br>
<br>
Well, let me see here.  I think you have forgotten a few points:<br>
1) Time required to get fishing to 200 is very high and has NO other saleable components.<br>
2) You have to be level 46 to get to the Plane of Growth.<br>
3) Getting to the Plane of Growth typically requires passing Wuoshi so you have to work up you Claws of Veeshan faction.  You also have to be able to survive the Plane which means no evils.<br>
4) Getting out if the Plane of Growth requires Gate so the main foraging class requires a Thurgadin gate potion to gather any wood.<br>
5) Typical forage rate on Branch of Planar Oak with a 200 forage skill AND a foragers sickle (don't get me started on ow long and difficult that quest is) is about 2.5 per HOUR of sitting and hitting the forage key every 90 seconds.  That's a lot of fun!<br>
6) Blessed Emeralds can only be obtained from a Tunare worshipping Druid or Cleric.<br>
7) Making Celestial essence is another fairly long trip for non-porting classes.<br>
<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START 8) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/glasses.gif ALT="8)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  Add a trip to Thurgadin for the sacred coldain thread.<br>
9) Dragon Eggs require going to Western Wastes, which requires a trip through Siren's Grotto!<br>
10) Plus a tailoring combine with a trivial of 150, a Brewing combine with a trivial of 150 and a pottery combine with a trivial of 103 (don't forget 5% failure rate regardless of skill).<br>
<br>
Add all that up and you think 1500 is too much?  How about adding in that it is one of the most difficult of the nine items required to make an earring worth over 20,000 pp?<br>
<br>
60 minutes...that's nuts.  I spent 9 hours in PoG getting oak, weeks working up tailoring and fishing, days working up pottery.  And the fact is I STILL can't make poles because I can't get the components I need<br>
<br>
I got mobbed by light blue mobs in crystal Caverns trying to get a bit of velium and died with only a 50% rez.  Where does that factor into your calculations?  I've neer known anyone to die due to jewelcraft except at the very high end.<br>
<br>
So, if you think the mark-ups are too high try walking into a McDonalds and telling them their prices are too high because the cost to make their food is really low.<br>

<br>
1) Jewelcraft has a low markup because it is far and away the easiest one to grandmaster.  To be a GM jeweler is nothing more than pp.  I could start a twink right now and be a GM jeweler in a couple hours.  Tailoring, Pottery, Smithing take loads more money and loads more time... Hence the markup.<br>
<br>
It's like going to going to school... You spend the time for that PHD you expect to paid better in the end.<br>
<br>
2) The Earing is never going to drop significantly in price.  I can still sell them easily for 15k and I highly doubt that will ever change until simply no one wants earings anymore.<br>
<br>
Reasons for this are simple.  The materials are a PAIN to get and you are not going to see people &quot;progressing&quot; to the level of tradeskills needed.  Robes are a pain.  Sickels are just HARD.  At 250 smithing I am lucky if I succeed on half the sickels I try.<br>
<br>
Point is the materials to make the earing have already dropped to a point where they aren't going to get any cheaper.  Thus the people who are making the earings are already selling at the minimum profit margin they are willing to except.<br>

If people understood that you can spend a little bit of time gathering components, and get an Earring of Solstice for under 5k in materials, I can guarantee there would be more people doing the quest on their own.  Is it &quot;worth&quot; 20k+?   Maybe to you.   The value is entirely determined by each individual who desires it.

<br>
If an item existed, that was made with 5 copper worth of storebought materials, and resulted in an item that was 125 to all stats/resists/hp/mana/ac with an effect that combines FT10 and 80 hp/tick regen, how much are you going to charge considering its &quot;value&quot;?  Nuff said.<br>

I am not a jeweler.  I have never been a jeweler.  I worked up my JC skill to make star ruby steins (they require 150 JC skill to avoid failures) but I have NEVER sold jewelery items... except one time, when I sold off my two old 6 dex 6 str rings for I believe 400pp each.  That price is not arbitrary... it's the price Coriolis charged me to make them.  So, um, get your facts straight before you flame.   And again, go to other servers and check around for the price on golden diety idols.  Especially non-tunare golden diety idols.  They're 1500pp from me, here.  Go ahead, check a few servers, see what they say.  I'll give you a hint... Solosek Ro averages at 4kpp.<br>
<br>
Cobra... I never said what the average for opal steins is, but it's generally at or below cost on most servers now.  Your experience was pretty common.  This is from people with high level characters who skill up randomly on a skill, then sell below cost with an alt.<br>
<br>
And to the person who said what if you use the opal stein for buying food and water... then don't buy one!  The vast majority of people who buy them, over time, will gain a lot of money.  But I always told bards not to buy them (they don't work with instruments and bards usually have enough charisma on other gear for their charming).  I mean, your arguement is like saying crystal spider fangs should be worth 50pp cause that's all they're good for if you're an enchanter and your melee skills stink.  Please.  But the vast majority of people will at some point hunt in Sebilis OR Seafuries in OOT OR do a tradeskill OR fight in a plain OR kill giants in Kunark... something involving large money transactions with vendors, and the steins pay off very fast.  So why begrudge the maker of the stien 200pp that they made, when you made back far more?  Which you will, unless you never level above 20, never sell or buy anything from a vendor, or some such.<br>
<br>
And to Chase... brewing ain't my buisiness, so I'm not saying this as someone you're competeing with... but please don't get frustrated and kill the market.  Really.  It only comes back to hurt you in the end.  Sometimes you have to lower your price, some times you have to talk to someone, sometimes the person won't listen and only wants to sell their stuff for any price, no matter what.  Best solution to the last situation is to lower your price right along with them when you know they're on... when they get below cost, buy their entire supply and go back to their old price.  Works like a charm.  Heh.  <br>

Golden Idol of Tunare, total cost to make 290 - 340 pp(on this server; 740 - 1240pp on other servers).  Average cost on other servers, 1500 - 4000 plat (roughly double cost to make, slightly more on certain idols).   Average cost here, more than quadruple cost to make.   HMMM.

Huh?  This does not make sense to me.  I don't port and I've made Celestial essences.  You know how long it took me?  Hrmm... like maybe 20min to gather all the pieces.  And that includes running to a zone connectes to SH to get a Mortar and Pestal.  All the Words and Runes I used in it I bought from merchants in SH and the Bazaar.<br>

You got it punk!</span><hr size=1> Azhrei:  Average cost on other servers isn't 1500, it's 3k.<br>
<br>
So, if we want to run the costs out, asuming perfect success rate (which lowballing the cost)...<br>
<br>
Average Server:  300pp Per Combine + 1020pp per firing = 1320 per idol.  Average price is 3k, so total profit to maker is 1680pp, roughly.<br>
<br>
Firiona Vie:  300pp Per Combine + 120pp per Firing - 420pp per Idol.  Average price is 1500pp, total profit to the maker is 1080pp.  <br>
<br>
So on golden tunare idols, on this server you save 50% of your money, and I make 33% less cash per idol combine... not someting most would complain about.  Again, you pay much less on Firiona Vie for your golden idols (especially non-tunare idols) than you would elsewhere.  At the time I priced the golden tunare idols, they were averaging at about 5k on other servers... and I never changed my price, as I saw no need.  I used to give a discount for iron oxides of 500pp... I sold the golden tunares for 1kpp and one iron oxide if they would supply that.  Once they became more commonly available in the bazaar I stopped doing so to avoid inflation (come on people, it's a ground spawn!).  That was a very cheap price, and many took advantage of it.<br>
<br>
But now let's look at non-tunare idols, shall we?  These have a 40-50% sucess rate at 255 skill.  I started selling them at 240 skill with gearlock, which was a 25% success rate.  But we can ignore that.  At 255 skill, golden Innoruuk Idols:<br>
<br>
(275pp per vial + 115pp per Saphire + 10pp per gold bar + 5pp misc supplys) = 405pp per combine, X 2.5 is 1012pp per unfired idol.  Add 120pp per firing (100 for the oxide, 20 for the other supplies) getting you 1132pp cost to me per idol.  I was assuming 10pp to imbue the saphire.  Now, these things are a bit streaky... if I fail a bunch and get one in four success rate, that idol just ran me a whopping 1740pp.  And yes, that happens.  But I always sell for 1500pp.  On average I make about 368pp per Innoruuk Idol... a less than 25% mark up.<br>
<br>
On other servers Inny and Sol Ro Idols average at 4kpp, a nearly 100% mark up.<br>
<br>
For those who wonder why Tunare is cheaper, it trivials at 240, while the other idols have an estimated trivial of 300.<br>
<br>
Also, golden idols do require the collection of Permafrost Crystals, Iron Oxides, and White Lead.  The first two are buyable in the bazaar for 10 to 20pp, and 100pp, respectively (not 50pp though, I've bought about 95% of my oxides for 100pp), and the last is made in a mortar and pestle using ingredients from Kaladim.<br>
<br>
Now remember, on top of all of this, that any firing has a 5% chance to fail, and the first combine also has a 5% chance to fail when fully trivial (ignore that first combine fail rate in the non-tunare idols, it's included in the 50% fail rate).<br>
<br>
And for Lethe... if you want to make a lot of essence, you can't depend on random stuff in the bazaar... you have to go to Ak Annon or West Commons for an unlimited supply.  So yes, that takes a while.<br>
<br>
Believe me, I set my prices for logical reasons, usually setting them below the inter server averages.  Sometimes, the price bombed on other servers, but the market was still very strong here, so my prices did end up higher for short periods of time.  I usually corrected for it as soon as I was able to keep the items in stock for more than a day (note that I did drop Spirit and Faithstone prices from 10k to 7500pp to 5k without having any competition as my skill got better and inter server average prices went down).  <br>
<br>
I remember the first item I ever sold a bunch of... Thurgadin Gate Potions.  These had never been sold before, and I was getting offers of 500pp and more for them.  But I sold them for 75pp each or 5 for 250pp, because I thought they were so neat and that every melee should try them out, and I wanted them to be affordable.  Sadly, I ruined the shaman gate potion market when I did that... I hadn't thought about it.  I later rose the price to 100pp each, but kept the 5 for 250pp price... couldn't keep the darn things in stock otherwise.  They still sell out very fast, and I'm sure I could sell them for more, but they don't cost me hardly anything and hey, gating for melees is fun.  <br>
