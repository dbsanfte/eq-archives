<br>
<br>
“You WILL marry him, Isharra!” roared her father, his flashing gray eyes warning of his thunderous anger. Jaryll Moonsong was a kind man, a gentle and loving father to his daughter. He was patient, considerate, and generous most of the time. Slow to anger, he chose the road of diplomacy before plunging into conflict. But on those rare occasions when his ire was raised, even his closest, most stalwart companions gave him wide berth. And right now, Isharra was at the center of the storm. <br>
<br>
Slamming her chamber door on his face, Isharra slid the bolt into place, tears streaming down her pale cheeks and pooling in the corners of her mouth. Collapsing with her back against the door, she tore the gaudy ruby baubles from her ears and threw them at the bureau leaning against the south wall of her room. The earrings clattered against the oak and then fell to the floor. “I will NOT!” Isharra screamed, now stepping on the rubies with all the force she could muster. “He is selfish and insensitive! Arrogant and rude! And he's SO skinny and he wears a DRESS for Tunare's sake, a DRESS!!” she spat, kicking the ruined earrings beneath her bed. <br>
<br>
On the other side of the door, Jaryll sighed deeply, pounding his fist once on the door. “Robes, daughter. He wears the robes of an enchanter. Isharra, what reason have you for such wicked words? Gareth has not once treated you poorly! He shows you nothing but kindness! Indeed, look at the gifts he lavishes upon you! Those ruby earrings! The gowns, the gems he has given you! And the betrothal ring! That ring could have paid for our entire estate! Has he ever spoken harshly to you? Nay! He LOVES you! He’s a good match for you---“ <br>
<br>
“Gaudy things, all of them! THINGS! THINGS! THINGS!” she growled, punctuating each word with a pound of her fist on the door. “The only reason I have them is because you undermined my desire to reject him by speaking for me!! You didn’t even----“ <br>
<br>
Jaryll’s voice boomed through the door, cutting her off. “I am your FATHER, Isharra, and I know what is best for you! It is my RIGHT to speak for you! You can’t live here with me for the rest of your life! You are of age! It’s time that you begin your own life now! What if I wish to take a wife, start anew? There cannot be two ladies of the household, especially not with you as stubborn as you are!” <br>
<br>
Isharra sobbed gently, lowering her face into her hands. She heard a shuffling outside as her father sat down, his back against the door. “Darling,” he said, his voice tender, “I only want what is best for you. Do you think I would allow you to marry someone who I thought would harm you? Gareth loves you. He and I have spoken at length about it. He has his rough edges, but so did I when your mother married me! I want you to be happy, and you WILL be, if you give him a chance. Please trust me, Isharra. Please.” <br>
<br>
“But I don’t love him, papa! No---I don't even <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>   like</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> him,” came her small voice through the door. <br>
<br>
“You will learn to, darling. I promise,” Jaryll replied tenderly, sensing surrender in his daughter’s voice. <br>
<br>
A sudden crash of something hitting the door proved his senses wrong. “I---<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>   crash</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->---will---<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>   crash</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->---not---<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>   crash</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->---marry---<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>   crash</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->—him!” she roared as a chair, a washbasin, a vase, a shoe, and anything else within arm’s reach gathered in a broken pile at the foot of the door. <br>
<br>
Isharra’s defiance only steeled his resolve, and Jaryll stood, brushing a patch of silver hair back from his brow, his mouth a tight line. “Yes, you will,” he said firmly, his voice strong and even. “It has already been arranged. I had hoped it would be a joyous occasion. Your mother would be ashamed of you, daughter.” With those last stinging words, he marched off. <br>
<br>
Isharra sagged to the floor, wiping tears from her emerald eyes, disbelieving her ears. Surely he was just bluffing, trying to scare her into obedience. Surely. But the next day a team of seamstresses arrived from House Crystalbrook, there to take measurements for the wedding gown of the bride of Lord Crystalbrook’s eldest son. And, like a zombie, Isharra let them poke and prod, present color swatches and patterns, just nodding dazedly at whatever was suggested. At one point, she mused aloud, &quot;Perhaps we should wear matching dresses. . .&quot;---only to feel the sudden prick of a pin in her backside. &quot;Oh my! Sorry, dear,&quot; the seamstress gushed, her voice as warm as a Halas night.<br>
<br>
The night before the wedding came too fast. And Isharra, finally jarred from her depressed resignation by a visit from Treewhisper, her sweet druid half-sister, snuck out of Felwithe with Treewhisper’s help. The druid spirited Isharra away for a brief respite in Surefall Glade, far from Felwithe and its obligations.<br>
<br>
After dedicating herself as a Priestess of Tunare in service to the Band of Dreamers, Isharra remained secretive about her flight from Felwithe, fearful that her father would get wind of her location. Some of the Dreamers were courtiers, and may have guessed her identity, but so far, thank Tunare, none of them had revealed that it was she, Isharra Moonsong, who had fled obligation and duty in Felwithe for a life of adventure. At least so far, she was free. <p><i>Isharra Moonsong</i><BR>

Old and young, warriors and healers alike have come to share a cup of cider and talk the night away in the safety of Surefall Glade. Every person at the fire has told a story, some so bawdy Isharra’s cheeks colored an alarming pink, prompting one worried druid to ask if she had fallen ill. No, she had replied, she would be fine in a moment. Finally her turn to tell a story is here, and after gazing at the stars for a moment, trying to choose her tale, she hears the sound of the wind whispering through the pines, and she knows immediately what she’ll share: <br>
<br>
“Some of you may know this tale, as a part of it takes place right here in this grove, but it is a tell worthy of telling and remembering. I wish to tell you the story of Treewhisper, my half-sister. Customarily, a High Elf would not admit to having siblings of questionable birth, but I say to the depths with custom! There is no other I would have as sister above Treewhisper. She is a creature of beauty and grace (though in a rustic sort of way, I confess.) <br>
<br>
“To begin, my mother, Elyandra, died of a cancer when I was still an elfchild. No, no... do not feel pity for me... I have long since recovered from her death and she is now a pleasant, warm memory. But for many, many years after her death, my father remained in mourning, taking no other in her stead. His love for her was boundless. <br>
<br>
“As some of you may know, my father ranks high in Felwithe court, and many beautiful Ladies sought to catch his eye--and failed. I was just young then, unaware of the intrigues of the court. Ah, how I long for such innocence again! <br>
<br>
“But I digress. My father met Moonmist, mother of Treewhisper, in Qeynos, when the moon was pregnant with its silver light. Magic was in the air, and later some said he was bewitched by the lovely druidess. Knowing Treewhisper as I do now, I think Moonmist's beauty was simply irresistible to my lonely father. Who knows for sure? Father won't speak of it. <br>
<br>
“Their love lasted only a few very passionate nights. When my father awoke, Moonmist was gone, and in her place remained only a small wooden carving of a great, gnarled tree. My father, confused and hurt, stored the carving away, not to be seen again for years upon years, until the day his eyes fell upon a wandering druid whose visage was almost so like Moonmist's that, for a moment, he thought her his lost love. But of that, I will speak another time. I wish now to relate to you the tragic tale of Treewhisper's lost wood. <br>
<br>
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br>
<br>
“On a bed of verdant grass, sheltered by the knotted arms of a great ancient oak tree, Treewhisper took her first breath. The trees were the only midwives to attend the child's mother, and the wolves were the only family to pace anxiously along the edge of the misty grove. But as Moonmist gently cleansed the blood from her newborn babe, she knew that she'd have it no other way. The breeze sang through the trees, celebrating the birth of their Keeper's child. The soft susurrations of sound were whispers to Moonmist's ears. The trees were whispering the good news, one to the next throughout the wood: an heir to the forest was born. Moonmist rejoiced in their approval, calling the child Treewhisper in honor of her ancient wooded family. <br>
<br>
“As the child grew, Moonmist taught her the ways of the Woodmothers, instructing Treewhisper in the ancient magicks of life, renewal, and rebirth. Moonmist knew her time as the Keeper of Silverglade Wood was coming to an end, and Treewhisper would reign as Woodmother. The wood was small but cozy, needing only a single Woodmother as a guardian.<br>
<br>
“The child grew strong in body and wisdom, wolves her sisters and brothers, trees her guardians. Moonmist never mentioned Treewhisper's father, and Treewhisper never asked, for her mother had taught her that a Woodmother's forest was her husband, and her marriage bed, the grasses within. <br>
<br>
“Woodmothers do not die. Instead, they fade away into the nature that they protected for so long -- at least that's what the ancient lore of the Woodmother says. They say a Woodmother within her forest can last thousands of years as long as she dwells within its sheltering embrace, then her spirit simply transfers itself to the trees. Thus, each tree is a Woodmother of old, since the day when Tunare first appointed a Woodmother as guardian to a forest -- so they say. <br>
<br>
“So, Treewhisper was not surprised one day to find her mother's belongings in the small moss-covered cave that they called home. Moonmist's scrolls, herbs, battle gear, and personal belongings were all placed neatly together on the old, rock-carved shelf that lined the cave wall. This was not a sorrowful time for Treewhisper. <br>
<br>
“Though Tree, as she came to be called, would miss her mother's physical companionship, she could sense her in the wood and knew that it was as it should be. The wood was her kin now, its inhabitants her charges. The young Druid picked up the fine scimitar used by her mother over the ages and ran her finger along it's shining, sharp blade. She turned it in her hand. The balance fit her; no more practicing with old rusty scimitars in the glade with her mother. This weapon was meant for a woman, for a fighter, for a true defender of the forest. A soft smile touched Tree's face as she caught her reflection in its long steel blade. She had not realized how much she had grown. Her face looked somehow older. In place of merry, rounded cheeks, were cheekbones chiseled from tan clay. Instead of the dancing glow of innocence in her bark-colored eyes, she saw the wisdom of ages sparkling there--her mother's wisdom, passed down from mother to daughter. <br>
<br>
“And all was well in Treewhisper's corner of the realm -- for a time. Gnolls began invading the wood from the South, killing the wolves for meat and slashing and burning the trees. Treewhisper fought bravely for as long as she could. The Keepers of Jaggedpine Forest tried to send aid, but they had their own battles to fight as Gnolls invaded Surefall Glade. <br>
<br>
“The attacks became more frequent, the fires more encompassing, until Treewhisper was captured and imprisoned in Blackburrow. She felt the pain of the trees as they burned, and even from this far she heard their silent screams in her heart. And she could do nothing. She had failed her wood. She no longer heard its whispers, she no longer felt its presence. <br>
<br>
“Her wood was dead. <br>
<br>
“Not long after the destruction of Silverglade, Treewhisper found herself rescued by brave rangers sent from Surefall Glade. There was no rejoicing; Treewhisper had nowhere she wished to go, nothing to call home. Her will was to die in Blackburrow, for a Woodmother without her wood surely dies. <br>
<br>
“But Tunare works in strange ways. The inhabitants of Surefall Glade nursed her back to health, and the presence of the sheltering pines soothed some of her pain. Though her anguish ran deep, she was soon able to leave the Glade in search of her homeland, Kelethin, and in search of answers to the questions she had about her people. And she found those answers... but that, my friends, is a story for another time.”<br>

<br>
A chorus of voices speak up in understanding, and she curtsies, silently bidding them goodnight. As she walks back to the druid guild where she will be spending the night, she feels the little hairs on the back of her neck stand up as she senses eyes upon her. She looks back to the fire, but the party's eyes are locked on a grizzled old shaman animatedly telling his tale. Shrugging to herself, Isharra continues toward the guild, not giving the feeling a second thought. It was not an unpleasant feeling, anyway. <p><i>Isharra Moonsong</i><BR>

Hello, little book. <br>
<br>
How strange it feels writing to you, but I need something to help me sort out my thoughts. The raid into Lower Guk hunt went well last night, except for the minor issue of our complete and total annihilation by the Lord and his knights late in the evening. Praise the gods that they saw fit to allow our spirits to return to our bodies, and praise Tunare for my gift of resurrection that helped complete the process of reanimation. I still wish to get a braided cinch cord for Deneteth, which I hear a Frogluk sage carries on him, as well as the arch magus's robes. My dear wizard friend deserves them for all his dedication to the Band. <br>
<br>
Gatsu is quite an able warrior, and after having only ventured in Lower Guk once before with us, he already seems to know the place well. That was a pleasant surprise, and he is very efficient at what he does. I also got to meet a Druidess by the name of Bryer, who joined us in our exploits later in the evening. From watching her and Gatsu, I think there is more than just friendship to their relationship, but I've never been the best at determining such things, and they could just be very close companions. Perhaps I'm just looking to see something where nothing is, as if I'm trying to make my own dull life a bit more romantic, vicariously through them. <br>
<br>
Sinadwen showed a thoughtful side I am not accustomed to tonight. Even though he was wrong in his summation that I'm &quot;chilly,&quot; it was interesting to hear him address a topic seriously, without mocking me. He asked me why that, since I have already fled from my obligation to marry Gareth, I still insist on honoring the betrothal by my chastity. Why do I? I answered that it is a warped sense of honor to my father, and I suppose that's the case, though Sinadwen reads more into it. Bah. <br>
<br>
Well, my eyes are starting to droop. I'd best sleep. Runnyeye is tomorrow, and I want to be alert. Thanks for listening, little book. Goodnight.<br>

<br>
I sat thinking tonight about the dark elf I met in Greater Faydark the night Anders and I visited Mistmoore. What makes a person good? Gatsu has surely shown his value in his efforts to aid the band, even though he was once a slave to hate. What of Cronadan? I was taught that all Teir'Dal are to be hated and that they are too far gone from the light to ever be redeemed. Yet, they are also children of the Mother, children stolen from her womb and mistreated until they became monsters. Can that shred of Koada'dal in them be reached? Certainly Cronadan has gone out of his way to distance himself from the sins of his people and has even found acceptance among most of the goodly folks of the land, including the Fier'Dal. Mayhaps he is evidence of some hope for peace one day? <br>
<br>
But for now, I cannot dwell on fantasies. The reality is that the Teir'Dal are bent upon our destruction. So I will continue to contemplate Cronadan, but my purpose as it concerns the rest of the Teir'Dal is clear: destroy or be destroyed. <p><i>Isharra Moonsong</i><BR>

<br>
I met with Cronadan today, as I wanted to learn more of his tale, to help me understand better the events that would cause a Teir'Dal to be hated in Neriak and accepted everywhere else. This is a scholarly pursuit for me, simply knowledge to add to my collection of anomalies that do not conform to my values.<br>
<br>
We spoke at length. He is an intriguing soul, and I felt like a child when I compared my petty little concerns to the things he has faced in his life. I will not scribe all the details of our conversation here, as I will simply have to repeat it again when I delve into my scholarly work later. But I will say this: I believe  his story. Perhaps there is one honorable Teir'Dal in all of Norrath, and this is he. <br>
<br>
Each day I learn new things that challenge all I have believed all my life. It is thoroughly exciting but frightening to me. <br>
Are we just the sum of all that we've been taught? Or are we more?<br>

Bah. Time for rest. Aluve, little book, aluve. <p><i>Isharra Moonsong</i><BR>

After seeing everything in order, she scans the previous night's entry, a description of a dream, then tears it out, tossing the balled up parchment onto the fire. <br>
<br>
She watches the paper flare up and dissolve into ashes, then, satisfied, she begins to write: <br>
<br>
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br>
<br>
Dear little book, <br>
<br>
Tonight I played the fool. At the urging of others, I tossed aside my values and breeding and tried to &quot;think out of the box,&quot; as they say. The result was my humiliation and degradation. I will never allow myself to do so again. <br>
<br>
I cannot afford the luxury of emotion. &quot;What was I thinking?&quot; I wonder now, looking back on my pathetic, emotional self. I am an embarrassment to myself and my family. I may not wish to marry Gareth, but from now on I will remember to behave as a Felwithe Lady and not some common tavern wench moon-eyed over a soldier. <br>
<br>
I am almost so ashamed of my own behavior tonight that I feared to pen this, for I'm not sure if I wish to be reminded of my folly again. But remember I must, for only by remembering this bitter taste of humiliation will I be able to avoid it in the future. <br>
<br>
On a more positive note: I have found a forever-friend in Bryer Thourne. I count that as a high point in a day gone awry. <br>
<br>
Now I must bathe. My hair is caked with blood and dirt and my robes are filthy with stains. The City of Mist is actually quite beautiful if you can avoid the beasts that haunt the passageways. I'll cloak myself from the undead and bathe in that delicious-looking waterway before making my camp. Yes, I am camped in the middle of the City of Mist, away from prying eyes and unwelcome guests, and safe from the creatures that roam as well. I like it here. Its dark, empty passageways make me feel right at home. <p><i>Isharra Moonsong</i><BR>

The branches of her leafy perch bowed under the weight of the rain, mimicking the way her heart now felt beneath its many burdens.

Dear Cronadan,<br>
<br>
Vendui'. Forgive me for my brutal treatment of you this evening last. You were a friend to me when others did not even know I pained, and for that I thank you. There is indeed nobility and goodness in you, no matter what others say. You have proven yourself time and time again to be the antithesis of all that is Teir'Dal, and you will forever hold a place of respect in my heart. Now, the bad news: I have chosen to return to Felwithe in the morning and beg forgiveness of my father. I will submit to his will and within the month, I will be Isharra Crystalbrooke. The reason I pen this missive is that of all my friends, and I do call you friend, only my relationship with you will be affected by my marriage.  Others can come to my estate for visits, and my husband and Lord will not question my time spent with them. <br>
<br>
But, alas, you will never be welcome by my father, nor by my husband's family. This grieves me, for after I am wed, I may never see you again. I would like to spend some time with you prior to my wedding to finish my scholarly inquiry into your unique turning from darkness. It will have to be far from Faydwer, lest I be discovered. I will make some excuse to my father and betrothed for my brief absence---perhaps a few days---complete my studies and return home for my wedding. I ask that you consider my request. If you agree, please suggest places where I could spend a few days in anonymity, enjoying my last month of freedom with a friend I may never see again.<br>

<br>
       I have often said that life is a constant challenge.  There are obstacles to overcome, mistakes to be made, and paths to choose.  I am happy to hear that you have made a decision as to what direction your life will go, though it pains me to know that I may lose your friendship, outwardly anyway.  Whether or not I am allowed to visit you at your estate is of no consequence to me.  You are abbil.  If you are in Felwithe, Kelethin, Kaladim, Rivervale, it matters not to me, for I carry our friendship in my heart.  All I need to do is to look inside myself, and you will be there.  Just as you once told me that I have touched you, you have touched me as well.  You are one of two Koada'dal nobles that look upon me with kindness, and I will never forget our friendship.<br>
<br>
     Xas, I would like to talk with you before your marriage.  There are many places we could meet.  I am accepted in almost all of the light cities, so there should be little difficulty setting up a time and place for our discussions to continue. (I will send you a tell in game.)  I hope to meet with you soon.  Aluve Isharra.<br>

Her emerald gaze was fixed on her work, but unseeing, as Gareth sat watching her, an amused smile playing upon his thin lips. Books lined the walls of the parlor in the Moonsong estate, and Isharra had come to love its shelves full of wisdom and adventure, but right now the high stacks seemed to be closing in on her, crushing her. <br>
<br>
&quot;My lovely Isharra,&quot; Gareth said, his voice full of musing. &quot;So beautiful, with a spine of iron. Are you pleased to be home?&quot; <br>
<br>
&quot;Yes, my Lord,&quot; she replied, her eyes never leaving the embroidery. It wasn't really a lie. Of the choices available, this seemed the most pleasing.  She felt his eyes studying her and she felt her face pinken.<br>
<br>
&quot;What did you do out there, my Isharra? Did you battle dangerous foes, lead armies into battle? Play the damsel in distress?&quot; he mused, his voice low and biting.<br>
<br>
&quot;I served Tunare, my Lord,&quot; she replied, ignoring the bile rising in her throat. &quot;That is all. No more, no less.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Ah  yes, Tunare!&quot; replied the agnostic enchanter, his mockery barely disguised. &quot;Of course, my dear. How noble of you.&quot;<br>
<br>
The cleric's emerald eyes blazed at that and her head snapped up, her nostrils flaring as she tried to contain her anger. Gareth's face split in a grin and he laughed loudly, harshly. &quot;Oh dear, I've angered you. So sorry, of course. I should be overjoyed that the wench has brought you back to me, if she were not part of the reason you left to begin with. Forgive me, Isharra, but I am in no mood for pleasantries after having awakened to find my bride missing on the morning of my wedding. Did you even think of your father? His shame? Not to mention my own. What were you thinking?&quot; The heat rose in his voice and he smacked the embroidery from her hands, glaring as he cupped her chin and looked into her eyes, his face a finger's breadth from hers. &quot;Or perhaps you weren't thinking at all. Is that emptiness I see in your eyes? Perhaps air between those pretty ears?&quot;<br>
<br>
Isharra was stunned, her skin crawling with fear. He had never, ever been this way before. He had been arrogant, yes, but always tender and eager to please. Who was this man?<br>
<br>
He left go of her jaw, leaving a dull ache there, and began to pace. His shoulders hunched as he sighed, the anger seeming to succumb to sorrow. &quot;I love you, Isharra. You've known that for long and long. Why did you leave me?&quot; Was his voice breaking? Was that glisten in his eyes tears? Isharra felt a sudden wave of pity for him and she went to him, taking his hand gently.<br>
<br>
&quot;I'm so sorry,&quot; she whispered, ashamed that she had brought this arrogant, self-assured elf noble to this state. He had every right to be angry, and that was surely all this was---the ravings of a broken heart. <br>
<br>
He looked up through his tears and lifted a hand to stroke her cheek. His pale hair looked like spun silk in the firelight. He was handsome and gregarious, with many friends among the court at Felwithe. Serving as his wife might not be so bad after all.<br>
<br>
Then the blue of his eyes suddenly froze over and his caress became rough. &quot;I'll not be shamed again, Isharra,&quot; he growled, then turned and left.  <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/uisharramoonsong.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Isharra Moonsong</A> at: 7/4/02 8:30:47 am<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/udeneteth1.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Deneteth1</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/white_ball.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Seeker of Truth</span><br>  Posts: 245<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(7/8/02 11:09:25 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm10.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=326.topic&index=18>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://deneteth.freeservers.com/image/den2.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Shades of heart-break</span><hr size=1> Deneteth is thinking back to that day in the City of Mist when Isharra announced she was going back to Felwithe and her destiny.<br>

<br>
At least she'll have plenty of time to go venture in the wilderness or take a true lover to her couch since he'll be busy roaming the corridors of the King's castle all days long.<br>
<br>
&quot;Politicians...&quot; he said again, shaking his head.<br>
<br>
And with this last word Deneteth went back to his study of the ancient Norrathian civilizations.<br>

<br>
It has been a few days since we last &quot;spoke,&quot; if speaking is what indeed we do. Father has been so affectionate lately, hugging me and caressing my cheek at every turn, so proud he is that I will soon be wife to a Crystalbrooke. You'd think that *he's* the one getting married. Nevertheless, it is good to have him near. Gareth has been busy with his duties at the palace for the past few days, so I've been able to spend time with my father, like when I was younger. We pore over old books and discuss the latest trends at court and even played dice for gold pieces the other night. Of course, he always returns my lost gold, but I keep his! <br>
<br>
What can I say about my future husband? I fear to tread there, to tell the truth. He's very kind and indulges me when he's getting his way. When he's not . . . I just don't know. I saw a side of him the other day that shocked me and frightened me a little. But then, I did embarrass his family (and my father) by my own waywardness, so I should count my self fortunate that Gareth will even still marry me. I learned yestermorn that my considerable dowry was going to be claimed by the Crystalbrookes, whether or not I came back from my adventures. They claimed they had rights to it for all their trouble, and Father, of course, agreed in his shame. Father was worried that it would make me unmarriagable, as he cannot afford another dowry fit for a Felwithe Lady. <br>
<br>
Father and Gareth seem to get along just grandly. No wonder---Gareth dotes on him and constantly indulges him when he has the mind to go on and on about his former military exploits. And Lord Crystalbrooke and Father were friends during his soldiering days, so that tie, too, binds he and Gareth together.  Well, I should leave you now, little book. I'm supposed to attend a social at the palace tonight. Oh joyous day. Bleh. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/uisharramoonsong.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Isharra Moonsong</A> at: 7/10/02 6:47:23 am<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/uisharramoonsong.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Isharra Moonsong</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 109<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(7/9/02 9:35:34 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm10.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=326.topic&index=20>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://home.earthlink.net/~brennec/_uimages/Isharra.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Face of the Goddess</span><hr size=1> Dearest Mother, please help me in this time of decision. My heart is broken, and my spirit weak.Oh Mother, please give me guidance that only a Mother can give. I am your humble servant.<br>
<br>
I penned this in your honor:<br>
<br>
Lovely maiden Chastity,<br>
Skin like silk and taut with youth,<br>
Your colors are many and celebrated.<br>
Tan like autumn leaves are you, or<br>
 black like onyx, chocolate brown,<br>
pale like sand, or red like cherry--<br>
you are the face of the Goddess.<br>
Remind me of my beauty, fair maid,<br>
remind me that I once wore your face<br>
and will someday again. <br>
<br>
Imbue me with your spirit, oh Mother, <br>
bless me with your Sight, <br>
for your eyes see all clearly--<br>
your eyes of amber, amethyst, or jade,<br>
obsidian, lapis, or sard, <br>
shaped like almond, egg, or diamond, <br>
the eyes of every Mother of every Child<br>
through all eternity are yours. <br>
<br>
Teach me to be kind, oh Mother,<br>
Instruct me in courage to protect those I love; <br>
give me spear, give me shield, give me cunning, <br>
So that none shall harm my little ones.<br>
Dwell within me, Love Eternal,<br>
shelter the life that springs from my womb,<br>
for we are Mothers, you and I.<br>
<br>
Prepare me for that day, oh Crone,<br>
That day when my hair, once lush, grows gray<br>
like the bare, resting trees of autumn,<br>
When my years remaining number less than lived,<br>
when my beauty, once vibrant, has taken new form.<br>
You are my friend, oh Ancient One--<br>
my dear, old friend, my Goddess.<br>
You have waited all this time for me,<br>
and now we finally meet, <br>
rheumy eyes of mine to yours eternal.<br>
Your many faces, oh Crone and seer,<br>
seem not so different now: <br>
Time-carved pathways of wisdom decorate<br>
each visage beneath a silvery crown. <br>
Dark-skinned or light, eyes of bark or sea,<br>
time touches all, without discrimination. <br>
Oh, Ancient One of night, <br>
prepare me for my sleep; <br>
prepare me for my final hours--<br>
I am tired now; my life is full. <br>
I wish to walk with you, oh Crone, <br>
to walk with you and hold your hand,<br>
I wish to walk with you in twilight<br>
on this winter day.<br>
I wish to walk and share my thoughts, <br>
my dearest hopes, my memories.<br>
I wish to dress with you in silver <br>
to match the stars that grace the sky--<br>
the silent, black, and ancient sky<br>
that hovers o'er the snow.<br>
<br>
Your face is hidden, Mother--<br>
the sky is dark, the moon is lost. <br>
Will you walk with me, my friend?<br>
The snow conceals familiar paths.<br>
<br>
Ah! To see your face in bloom, again,<br>
young and firm and bright! <br>
But walk with me for now,<br>
 gray and wrinkled as we are,<br>
Walk with me for now,<br>
as we've walked for these years past.<br>
And we'll walk until our footprints<br>
 in the snowfall are no more. <br>
