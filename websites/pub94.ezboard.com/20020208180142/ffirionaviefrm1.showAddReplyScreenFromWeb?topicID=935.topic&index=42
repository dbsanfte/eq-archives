<br>
Ok, I knew I said I wasn't going to add any more fuel to this thread. But I have &quot;cut n pasted&quot; this from a thread I started on this borad called, &quot;Lets try something different&quot;.<br>
<br>
Please take the time to check out that thread.<br>
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
I really wasn't looking at turning this into a TLC is good or TLC is bad thread. Although no one can control what gets posted on public boards I guess.<br>
<br>
There were threads that openly and constructively discussed issues regarding class balance that were very helpful to everyone reading the thread. It made people think about alot of issues in ways they might not have thought of even if they didnt agree with it. The paladin class comes to mind (mainly because it was the most recent.) Thats what I would like to see here.<br>
<br>
Bottomline is this. No matter what you think of TLC, good or bad, I think that everyone can agree that it inadvertantly affects many people in ways that Verant could not foresee. So whats the alternative? <br>
<br>
I would really like to see some ideas from the other players out there. There were many that got posted on the test boards when this came up many months ago. Some were pretty good actually.<br>
<br>
Personally, what I would like to see is this. To prevent &quot;farming&quot; Verant should use the code they have developed in SoL that increase the level of the rare everytime it pops until it remains alive for &quot;x&quot; amount of time. Perhaps they can even increase the spawn time as well. So that if a rare is killed once, it would respawn at its normal spawn rate, but if it is killed again another 20 minutes would be added and so on, then they could outright remove TLC.<br>
<br>
If thats too much work, I would suggest Verant ask its content team to review all the quests above level 35 that require obtaining items from lower level NPC's. Once they have a list compiled of the drops on lower level mobs needed to complete these quests they can simply put these items on the loot tables of higher level mobs. That way they aren't penalizing the players that are higher level when new expansions come out.<br>
<br>
Perhaps they can do something similar with the components needed for trade skills. If human blood is needed for cultural armors I am sure they can add that item to a high level mob somewhere. How about FP guards? Those are light blue up till level 56.<br>
<br>
As an aside, its easy to just sit back and do nothing. Its easy to just say, &quot;Thats the way it is, so deal with it&quot;. If everyone in the world did that what a poorer people we would be. Change doesn't happen by itself. It starts with someone or some group saying, &quot;I have an idea&quot; or &quot;This could be better&quot;. In fact, as I recall, thats how EQ came to be in the first place isn't it?<br>
<br>
Lee Iacocca (fogive me is I mispelled this name) was one of the first to recongnize the power behind thinking differently and soliciting feedback from all levels of his organization. He recongnized that change doesn't have to be a bad thing. I'll leave you with one of his quotes, that is a personal favourite of mine.<br>
<br>
&quot;Lead, follow or get out of the way&quot;.<br>
<br>
Can't wait to hear your ideas. <br>
<br>
Please respond on the &quot;Lets try something different&quot; thread with your ideas.<br>

It is obvious to anyone who has explored SoL and its quests that they did not.&quot;<br>
<br>
Heh...  Its not that Verant didn't consider TLC.  Moreso that they didn't consider anything.  Remember they had planned to have TLC on SOL until whatever flash of insight hit them and they did and decided to poll the players.  How far along were they into SOL development when they polled?  The sad thing is that they had probably already designed these quests and decided to poll when they realised how &quot;nerfed&quot; many quests actually were with TLC.  This is what is scary, Verant originaly intended to have TLC on Luclin and yet they still could not &quot;fix&quot; the quests to work properly.<br>
<br>
As for the arguments about TLC...  Verant decided to make FV the &quot;most difficult server&quot; instead of the roleplaying server.  As someone else said, people come to FV for many reasons, because it is so different from normal servers.  This has ticked off people that wanted a 'roleplaying server' without the added dificulty.  <br>
<br>
All I can say is that they were warned beforehand,though they did at least listen, though not agree.  When they anounced the rules for a roleplaying server (on gameplay, back before they had even anounced Luclin) I argued with Aradune on the messageboard about the &quot;RPness&quot; of TLC.  As well as many of the other features. <br>
<br>
Most of their ruleset I agreed with to a point.  I told them however that while most of their rules were not disagreeable, they were not roleplay related.  I then focused on two issues.<br>
 1. They needed to open another single character server.  Otherwise the server would likely be filled with people looking to that option.  And I pointed out that just because someone hates &quot;twinks&quot; doesn't mean they are a roleplayer.  (I am very glad that Sullon Zek opened with 1 character before FV.  PvP or not I believe it helped in this respect.)<br>
2.  That Warrens Loot Code did nothing to foster roleplay.  Instead it made it more difficult for players with one account to gain items while those with multiple accounts  could still farm to their hearts content.  I then stated that I would play on it, Warren's Loot Code or not... but that it was in no way a &quot;roleplaying rule&quot;.<br>
<br>
I don't recall everything that was said, Aradune responded to comments I made several times on the same thread.  One of Aradune's responses was that it was not intended to be an anti-farming rule but rather it was &quot;roleplay enforcement&quot; because it kept higher level characters out of lower level dungeons.  I remember now that I must have offended him because I said that was gibberish, or rubbish, or something.  And said, if farming isn't an issue what is the problem:  Afterall it was natural for a powerful character to occaisionaly slaughter lesser monsters  (it happens in fantasy fiction, fantasy games, why not EverQuest it is afterall a multiplayer fantasy game with a detailed story). <br>
<br>
I don't recall seeing the response after that (I may have it was a long time), and the boards were shut down not long after.  I wish I had a copy of that thread.  LOL. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/uruss386.showPublicProfile?language=EN>russ386</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 28<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(12/30/01 2:14:13 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=935.topic&index=44>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Another TLC rant ... sigh ...</span><hr size=1> You know, TLC is sort of paradoxical.  I came to Firiona Vie for several things.  One, I dislike extreme twinks.  I kind of like the low-level scrimp and save, but that's just me.  Two, grouping and language restrictions.  My RP character dictates that I don't want to group with trolls, dark elves, and their ilk.  Three, the simple newness of the server.  Kind of interesting to see all of the guilds grow up and get to know lots of people from day one.  <br>
<br>
Now, I'm quite satisfied on all of these points.  Language restrictions are intresting, too, although kind of easy to get around.  I've had lots of interesting RP encounters, and made many good friends.  However, TLC and the low population are seriously bumming me out.  Bumming me out to the point where I started a bard on Vazaelle that I anticipate spending more and more time with, even though I have a fairly nice Level 30 Monk here.  <br>
<br>
How is TLC paradoxical?  Well, it is supposed to dissuade the power-gamers from farming low-level items to sell.  OK, it does do that.  But then don't many power-gamers have several accounts?  Couldn't I just buy another account, PL a character up to whatever level I need to be able to kill the mob, then give it to my main, who is able to take it because it isn't no-drop.  Hmm, sounds like a conspiracy to get us to buy more accounts doesn't it?  Makes you want to be a power-gamer doesn't it?  And don't even talk to me about the screwed-up economy on this server.  Personally, I say put NO DROP back on and take out TLC.  Let the farmers come.  I'll kill hill giants for money when I need it, thank you very much.  Then they can sit in their little camps farming and I'll be happy to buy their wares. <p>Tenzin Dralha <BR>

<br>
<br>
Oh I agree with that...  it has always been my attitude.  If they (farmers) want to be the one spending hours waiting for some mob to spawn I'll gladly spend the coin I get from hunting the way I wish to buy it from them.<br>
<br>
As for those who wish to 'get their own stuff' I've wondered what their problem with this is as well. Afterall, now they are now competing with relatively few people (farmers) that is their will be many customers (otherwise it wouldn't be proffitable) per farmer.  Where as if Verant ever did compell farmers to close shop those same people would be competing with every customer the farmers would have had...  possibly several at once instead of one farmer.<br>
<br>
<br>
All of that seems to bypass the point though.  No matter what was intended for TLC it is a PROBLEM.  TLC messes up quests and conflicts with Verants other anti-farming measures (LORE/NODROP/NORENT).  The fact that the problems with TLC exist on Luclin show that Verant is not capable/willing to consider it in their -new- developments.  If they can/will-not do that how can anyone think they will take the time to go back and -fix- the problems that already exist with TLC.  I may very well be wrong, but I see no reason to believe that Verant will take the time/effort needed to make TLC work well.<br>
<br>
That said I believe their is no alternative but to remove TLC entirely.  Just my opinion though.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

The fact that you cannot simply charge in with your High level character and loot Trival mobs is not a 'bug' or 'defect'.  It was intentional.<br>
<br>
If you missed out on a quest or it is a new quest, FV rule set uses the removal of the NO DROP to allow for players to get TLC barred items via Player commerce.  That is the way it was intended.<br>
<br>
Thus, Verant was fully aware of the 'issues' the new low end quests when they released SOL   There are supposed to be Low End quests.  And High Level players method of dealing with them is by interaction with Low level players or merchant mining.  <br>
<br>
So again, other than inconvience, what is the 'problem' with the TLC?<br>
<br>

I really only know the monk class, so I can say that that only really prevents farmers from getting to one item.  The fighting baton drops from a level 32 mob.  It typically goes for  500pp.  In EC or North Freeport on other servers, most of the prices I hear  are in the thousands of pp.  Is the loss of a measly 500pp item (not that he'd ever get that much for it on such a weird economy like this server has) going to keep someone who just wants to farm from coming here?  If he's a real pharmer, a real jerk, then he'd be camping the fungi tunic or some of those nice H2H Luclin weapons.  TLC won't keep him from getting those items.  <br>
<br>
How much stuff that is really worth being farmed comes from a mob less than 34?  Some, yes, but not really enough to justify the stress that TLC puts on all of us for quest items.<br>

<br>
Where is the Post from VI saying that the TLC on FV was ONLY to prevent farmers?  <br>
<br>
Again baseless suppositions and rants.   You can go to the EQ Home page and search the Devel board and find where I am getting my 'factual' information regarding the intention of TLC items, such as epic pieces to be 'obtained with the help of lower level players'.<br>
<br>
Secondly, I though Bjord's original argument was that the TLC is broken and makes quests Impossible.  Having failed to prove this claim, Bjord is now attempting to argue semantics and spread 'fear of famers' into the anti-TLC argument.  To quickly address his new 'claim', there is farming without the TLC as well, so removing it will not address the issue of farm, and thus 'Bjord's Farming Argument' does not support removinig the TLC to address farming.<br>
<br>
Just because you are unable to deal with something does not mean that it is broken.   Just because you cannot level race, and get every and any item you want in a second does not mean it is broke.  Just because you cannot simply Level race to 50, then go and clean out all the 'greenie' mobs  for those nice items you want, does not mean that the TLC is broken or bad.<br>
<br>
The TLC, and the other rule sets of FV work just fine.  They  set up a DIFFERENT game where Leveling is the NOT the priority.   Just becase you cannot use your 'Old world server tactics,' does not warrent a change in the TLC.  How about learning to play with in the rules of the searver?    <br>
<br>
Again, anyone have any Hard data why the TLC is Broken or makes the game unplayable?  And again, the basic anti-TLC argument is 'IT'S TOO HARD NOW, CHANGE IT'.<br>

<br>
If the Anti-TLC argument is:<br>
<br>
The TLC is broken and does not work as intended.  It prevents questing and thus warrents removel.<br>
<br>
Where are specific factual examples to support this claim.<br>
a) That the TLC operates outside its intended use.<br>
b) Quests are unsolvable because of the TLC.<br>
c) A &amp; B are sufficent and prolific enough to warrent remove of the TLC.<br>
<br>
My 'Pro-TLC' Argument is that there is not specific factual evidence to meet the above, and thus the 'Anti-TLC' arguement is based  on opinion and dislike of a core rule of the FV server, rather than factual evidence of damage to the intended game play on FV.<br>

It does not make quest completion impossible if you have spoiler and if you have lots of resources (multiple comps/accs, plat, etc).  If TLC was in place on other servers, I would not have be able to solve the quests I did.  I don't mean complete -- I could have done that if someone else had solved them for me.  I mean it's not possible to do many quests from scratch with TLC and without spoilers.<br>
<br>
I did not and do not read VI board's.  I read these boards and pretty much everyone here was writing that TLC was intended to stop farmers.  That's ludicrous, since it doesn't stop farming.  If that's not the intent, then I have a problem with both the intent and the implementation.<br>
<br>
Lastly, I do not level race.  I've got 8 days played and am only 21.  If I level-raced, I'd be about 50 and I wouldn't have bothered mastering all languages.  I do not farm nor do I have a problem with those who do.  I do not have any problem with getting around the TLC myself.  I never said I did.  I've said it several times.  You keep coming back and saying I've got a problem getting around it.  I don't.  I've played 3 characters to post-50, one to 60.  Getting around TLC is no big deal for me even without reading spoilers because I did a lot of these quests back before there were spoilers.<br>
<br>
My problem is that TLC forces people to wait for other servers to solve quests and post spoilers.  It forces people to read these spoilers, weigh the reward and effort, and then work around the TLC instead of playing through the quest.  TLC hurts newbies, many of whom do not want to be spoiled.  It hurts people that don't scrounge for spoilers.  It hurts people that want to figure out quests for themselves.  It hurts those that don't have two accounts and two computers.  It hurts those that don't have a large stack of plat to pay lowbies.<br>
<br>
All of these things mean that TLC is good for people like me and really bad for most others.  I personally do not like an elitist atmosphere, even if it favors me.  That's what TLC fosters and it's the main reason I want it gone.  There are secondary reasons that are nearly important, too, though.  For one, not one single quest was designed with TLC in mind.  It's an afterthought that isn't really supported.  This makes questing doubly hard, since a quest bug here effects such a small number of people that it's not worth VI's time to fix it. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/uruss386.showPublicProfile?language=EN>russ386</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 34<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(12/31/01 11:07:29 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=935.topic&index=55>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Hmm.</span><hr size=1> Denoi and Calare were able to complete quests without spoiler sites, true, but that really doesn't mean that those who are higher level than they are don't deserve to complete the quests.  TLC says to people who want to level, &quot;You're not welcome here&quot;.  &quot;In fact, we have a code in place that makes levels bad.&quot;  Then why not remove levels?  Make all mobs level 1.  VI could probably do it, with a little effort.  I just don't understand why the challenge of TLC is really necessary. It makes FV kind of elitist, in my opinion, like it's only for experts who ONLY care about quests.   I could write more, but it's New Year's Eve and I'm going to go party.  <br>
<br>
(Oh, yeah.  Maybe we should move the TLC discussions into their own special section.  Maybe the FV ruleset forum?) <p>Tenzin Dralha <BR>

Only Vah Shir can run those quests, as they're all started by turning in your Acryllia slate, and only Vah Shir can get those slates.<br>
<br>
But I understand your point.  Yes, if you want to run a newly introduced quest in the future, you won't be able to (if it starts by killing something that is lower than your current level allows).  No two ways around that... it's going to be a fact of life on this server.<br>
<br>
However, what is the alternative?  Remove TLC altogether?  The cure would be worse than the symptom.  And while the complaints outnumber the defenders on this board (or so it would appear) I think this is more because people who are satisfied don't put time into rants outlining the fact.  I think the majority of players on this server are like myself:  it makes us work harder, but doesn't make it impossible. <p>Denoi Fishwhiskers<BR>
