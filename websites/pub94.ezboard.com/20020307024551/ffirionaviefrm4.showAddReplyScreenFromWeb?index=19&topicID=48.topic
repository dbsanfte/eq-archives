Many of the paying customers on this server want to roleplay.  An unfortunate few think that it is up to them to define roleplaying.  I'm sure it's the same mentality that has people come up to me in stores and on the street to tell me things.  If I'm feeling polite I ask those people what makes them think I respect thier opinion enough to listen to it.  If not f-off works wonders.<br>
<br>
If you are approached by someone who isn't roleplaying, be polite and stay in character.  If you are approached by some twit telling you how to play your character, mock them.  They will get on your nerves anyway, so may as well have some fun at thier expense.<br>

But, I will explain my point of view before I bid you ado. The premise of the thread was to get a consensus from the players about the feel of roleplaying on FV, not just to advocate my point or my own experiences. And the use of the term &quot;RP Nazi&quot; was a mockery of the &quot;Soup Nazi&quot; character on Seinfeld. I was not referring to any similiarieties of the German Nazis and those who take their desires to RP in EQ too far, by my standards. It is clear, to me, with even this simple demonstration of jesting that the narrow-mindedness (RP-only or GET OUT!) on this server is going to deter anyone with a sense of real-life humor from lasting long here. This server will be dominated by hard-assed RP zealots, extremists, diehards, et al. who will demand everyone talk and act like they do. A lack of diversity and sense of individuality isn't very fun for a lot of people.<br>
<br>
The server, whether you choose to admit it or not, *IS* by every definition set up as an alignment server. Not once have you seen a comment made by Absor, Brad, or anyone else that dictated how players should roleplay. They can't because they have no way to enforce RP'ing. The server *IS* set up as an alignment server, which determines everything you can do, who you can group with, experience penalties and bonuses, who you can be buffed or rezzed by, etc. The way you RP has no concrete action against your ability to group with others, having a different alignment does. Yes, the little tag say 'Roleplaying Prefered&quot;, but that is not the process by which you have to play the game on Firiona Vie. The process is set by your alignment, which determines everything you can and can not do functionality-wise, therefore it is an alignment server. No, it is not a Zek. Yes, roleplaying is preferred. Are all players going to RP like everyone else? No. Are all players going to be restricted in their grouping by their alignment? Yes. You do the math then let me know whether or not this is an RP server or an alignment server.<br>
<br>
This commentary is all for not. I've already decided to not play on FV due to the...and yes, I'll say it...RP NAZIS that go around telling others how to play the game. I play by Verant's rules, i.e. I do not KS, I don't train intentionally, I do treat others with respect, etc. The idea of having the challenge of alignment dictate who I can and can not group with sounded interesting at first, but the player base with the incessant whining did me in. There is whining everywhere you go, true. But I really didn't feel the need to subject myself to another 50+ levels of hearing people screaming across a zone, &quot;No, you can't say SoW plz, you HAVE to say 'Might thou spare a spirit of the wolf weave of magic so that I might be able to survive in this densely packed forest wherein beasts of evil and torment live?&quot; *puke* I'll stick with, &quot;SoW plz,&quot; thanks. While RP is fun when everyone else is doing it to, it becomes too taxing for me to try and incorporate RP when everyone has their own ideology of how it should be performed. <br>
<br>
I'm not trying to be demeaning or adverse, I just wanted to express my own thoughts on the matter as lived through my own experiences in my short stint here on FV. Roleplaying isn't hard for me, as I am sure it is not for most of you. But when it boils down to it, this game is still Everquest and no matter where you go you are roleplaying character to some degree. Some do it more than others on various servers. (Felishanna is a prime example of how players can roleplay on any server.) At least here you can roleplay and be praised for it. With that, I bid you all good luck, no hard feelings, and I hope the server is all you hoped to make it. :) <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ufelishannasecretlight.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Felishanna Secretlight</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 7<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(10/17/01 7:53:41 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=48.topic&index=22>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: The use of \OOC channel</span><hr size=1> OOC.<br>
Since you brought my name into your post Bello (Froggy's character name), I will reply.<br>
<br>
Yes, you can roleplay on any server, and yes I have shown it can be done, but you know as well as anyone the gauntlet I have had to run from anti-RP nazis, to butcher your phrase, on the standard blue server we both come from. Everything from exclusion, insults and vilification, personal harassment, lies, and even threats, to try to get the roleplayer to change to a non-roleplaying approach, even though the roleplayer for the most part keeps entirely within their own circle of friends.<br>
<br>
If this is typical of how roleplayers are treated on other servers too, can you imagine how pleased we all might be to actually get a server 'of our own'? Because this is how we feel about Firiona Vie. Some will go too far, and attack the militant non-roleplayers in the way roleplayers have ever been attacked on others. I will not condone it, but I can understand it.<br>
<br>
But Firiona Vie IS a roleplaying server. Not because Verant said it was. But because we players here will make it that way. And if this means the non-roleplayers who have come here and refuse to join in the community style get some problems from this, they also can consider why exactly they moved here. Because unlike roleplayers before Firiona Vie was launched, they have 30+ other servers to choose from.<br>

I thought of your roleplaying style as very ingenious. (Even though you never bought into my 'good' Ogre story. hehe) The mention of your name in my previous post was meant to be complimentary. You endured a lot of heat on Lanys. On FV, your style of play will be more accepted and more often returned. I think that will benefit you and the server in many ways. As far as I am concerned, you are the standard by which others try to emulate in all things pertaining to roleplay. <br>
<br>
The thing I was expecting on this server was more tolerance, not a complete swing the other way. The tag says 'Roleplay Prefered', not 'Roleplay Mandatory'. I was hoping that those who wished to roleplay would be able to do so without harassment and that those who chose not to roleplay as much as others would still be able to play in the manner they wished. Had this been a 'Roleplay STRICTLY Enforced' server, I would have nothing to say right now. But, since it is an alignment-geared server that prefers players that roleplay, I believe I still have the right to tell my side of my own experiences.<br>
<br>
In all honesty, I was really looking forward to roleplaying and playing under the confines of alignments. It just seems to make more sense. But not everyone is on the same page. I can get just as much roleplaying on Lanys as I can here, without a fraction of the bickering. And that is the reason why I chose to go back to Lanys. I am sure this server will eventually lose a majority of the d00dz along the way because they will be ostricized for their behaivor. Perhaps some time in the future I will come back to explore FV's potential to be the roleplay server most of you are hoping to make it.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ukeldal.showPublicProfile?language=EN>keldal</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 36<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(10/17/01 10:33:34 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=48.topic&index=24>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: The use of \OOC channel</span><hr size=1> Felishana,<br>

<br>
Okay now that we have that issue handled let's talk a bit.  Should we criticize people for not roleplaying sure let's go OOC to them and tell them hey guys you are stupid you need to roleplay.  Or if someone is not roleplaying YOUR way let's once again go OOC and tell them.  I am sorry but this seems like We are 5 again and invited people to our house and are going to tell them what they can and cannot do.  Now here is the problem will we have them yes will we have the d00ds yes but when they go OOC do we have to interact with them?  I think not.  I definitely agree with the example of SOW plz and telling the guy to go find a farmer is that going OOC and criticizing no but is that letting him get what he wants without roleplaying  well not from you and if most people do this then we will have a select few groups of uber d00ds and most likely they will get bored and go to Antonius Bayle UK server.<br>

Read my post again. I specifically stated in it - I do not condone it. You must have read over that line, or reduced its importance in your mind.<br>
<br>
Personal harassment of any player by any other is unacceptable. I have been on the RECEIVING end of this enough times, purely because of my choice to roleplay. I doubt you are in a position to understand. In a similar way to some man lecturing in a condescending tone a woman who has been raped, on how AWFUL it is to be raped (though obviously not in the same league of seriousness). This does not mean I advocate shooting rapists ( well ... no ... we won't go there ).<br>

It is not up to anyone to define roleplaying for others to the point of harassment, or harass another for doing it 'their way' (however misguided we may think them).<br>
<br>
To each his own. Always.<br>
<br>
However, I personally will treat those who spam public channels (especially auction) with OOC nonsense with disdain, and I encourage others to do so as well, in the hope of stamping it out. Sorry if you disagree, but we all get to try to mold the community the way we want it. I will similarly be far more sympathetic than average to any who approach me in a roleplay-style, and considerably less so to any who address me with d00d speak. So the extremist non-roleplayer might call me some RP extremist, though actually I am not, I think every person should be able to play they want to and makes them happy, and I have many non-roleplaying friends who just are happy doing what they do, and I group with them lots. But I still question the motives of anyone who actually HATES roleplaying, or even just professes a total indifference towards roleplaying, coming to play the the server tagged as RP (with whatever riders you like). ALL the other servers are not so tagged. Yes, it's a free world, players can play where they want, but coming to the RP server and spamming public channels with d00d speak is like throwing petrol on a fire; it is not exactly keeping it to yourself, it is trying to negatively impact the RP experience of everyone else in the zone.<br>
<br>
My previous post was an explanation of where I believe some harsher feelings are coming from, not an excuse for the behaviour. Understanding a problem is the key to solving it. Blind soapbox statements solve nothing (except to antagonise the readers into thinking you condescending). There will be a bit of a backlash for a time. But this will, I truly believe, become less prominent, as people settle down to enjoying their new environment, and spread out across the zones of Norrath.<br>

I got one of these RP-extremists into a very heated /tell debate today, about how he supposedly  witnessed my lack of RP'ing in CB earlier today. Ummm, first of all, I haven't been in CB for almost 3 days now. Second of all, unless he's using a group say hack, he's not able to tell if I'm RP'ing or not, because I almost NEVER use the general /say channel, unless it's to thank someone for a Spirit of Wolf or something to that effect. I tried for a good 20 minutes to get this through his head (I'll respect this person's dignity by not revealing the name). But noooo, he INSISTED I was in CB at the time, and I wasn't role-playing. Well, when one of his obviously paid-off friends chimed in against me, I just felt a sudden urge to explode, and take some of the flame teachings I've learned on my old server to good effect. However, restraint won through, and I just calmly /ignored them both... two kills later, ding! 15!<br>

For those that want to know, being a Discord Neutral, I'm NOT going to use &quot;thy&quot; and &quot;thou&quot; every 3rd or 4th sentence, I AM going to be a little crude at times, and I WILL go wherever the &lt;bleep&gt; I want to, just because I can do it. (I'm nice enough to censor myself, though. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> ) I do things because I want to do them, and if they coincide with your plans, so much the better. If you need my help, I'll more than likely give it, because I can. But don't be surprised if I get a little base at times. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p><font color="red">Kryshal<br>
