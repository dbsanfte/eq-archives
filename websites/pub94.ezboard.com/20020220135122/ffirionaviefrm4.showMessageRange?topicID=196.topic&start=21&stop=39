He sits right next to me in RL about 6 feet away. And btw he knew exactly what the guy was saying and said he could kiss off. And rightfully so, there was no attempt whatsoever to reson or ask for any sort of compromize. And if sombody in the guild would have asked me to leave because he complained to them. I would have told them to go sit on it also. Like I said I have 0 tolerance for rude people 0 as in none at all as in denatta period end of list. If your rude to me you get nothing and no guild leader no guild member no person on the face of norrath will ever move me in my stand. <br>
          But on the other hand if your polite and courteous and friendly with me I can be the best friend you ever had. I love helping people and grouping with people and having a general good time. Ask people that know me they will tell you. There is absolutly no need for behaviour like thier's I mean come on how hard is it to just ask someone if they will let u camp somthing? And you may belive he has a right to ask other people in the guild for help with me. But if you look at the log I had said a total of 5 words up to that point. I was waiting for him to ask me to either leave or share. I would not have left but I would have waited for him to get his spawn. I see people like him as whiny crybabys that look to try to talk to sombody that has &quot;authority&quot; over you to get thier way.  <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=dromel>Dromel</A> at: 1/2/02 7:42:05 am<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/utwotribes.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Twotribes</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/white_fire.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Board Troll</span><br>  Posts: 169<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(1/2/02 10:08:43 am)</font><br>     <br>Community Supporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Winds of Destiny?</span><hr size=1> Neither party was very clear on anything.  The original poster made little effert to work out what they wanted. Going instead directly to a basic threat of sorts. BUT the second party made ZERO attempt to indicate tolerance or a willingness to arrange a compromise.<br>
<br>
This is assumeing of course that the conversation posted is correct. I assume it is since the second party hasnt claimed it wasnt (though they did add a previous part unknown to it).<br>
<br>
Both sides should understand that they acted in a way that offend the other. And if it is standard practice from them both, I forsee problems for both in the future.<br>
<br>
As the original camper, a tell should have been made that specifically asked the intention of the other, once it was clear both wanted the same thing. By the same token the second party should have been more willing to indicate a willness to come to some arrangement.<br>
<br>
Rudeness begets rudeness. When you purposefully avoid offering compromise and then ACT like compromise was an option if only the others had seen through your rudeness........<br>
<br>
The above paragraph applies to BOTH parties.<br>

Read your posts here.  You sound and type like an idiot.  Your communication skills...lets just say...lack a bit. <br>

I have no idea or judgement on this but I did read the whole thing.  From what I read...your an ass.  Not from what accurred but simply from what you've posted.

And btw there are no recognized camps on this server. So if you find him first more power to ya. But if we do to bad.'<br>
<br>
There is your willingness to negotiate. Your view on what is right on the server, and your form of sharing is clearly stated. That was said, btw, while you were sitting on the spawn spot. My, I'd have a great opportunity at finding him first, eh? <br>
<br>
You arrived at a camp that was obviously camped (the PHs were all dead). I have no doubt that you would share (even envoke PnP) if the jester had been camped by even or red cons to you. Since it was camped by players who conned blue to you, you simply ignored the fact that we were there. You could easily KS us. I did assume that you were logging out at first, since that's what respectable people do when they want to wait their turn for something. Ten minutes later you were still running around killing the mobs that previously had been a nice source of exp for me. It was obvious that you have no respect for your fellow players. <br>
<br>
This is not a PnP issue, btw. If you read the log, you'll not see any text where I claimed the camp as my very own, or demanded that the intruders leave. I only asked if he realized that we had been there in order to determine what kind of person he was. Sure, I hoped that maybe he was stupid enough to not realize we were there and then leave. I asked for an officer referral for the same reason, that is to determine if this was guild policy. You can read that intent in the log. I had already decided to abandon the camp. There are no items in the game that are worth real disputes. There are no items in the game that would compell me to banter back and forth with pricks like Dromel. I trusted his words in game. He stated his position and that is enough for me. <br>
<br>
For the life of me, I can't see where I was rude in this matter. If someone would be so kind as to point out the text, I would be grateful.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/utwotribes.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Twotribes</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/white_fire.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Board Troll</span><br>  Posts: 171<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(1/2/02 10:48:38 am)</font><br>     <br>Community Supporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Winds of Destiny?</span><hr size=1> I agree that the original poster was less rude.

After being informed that the second group was there to camp the same spawn, a jump is made to  &quot;Wow I haven't run across folk like this yet.&quot; and it is down hill from there.<br>
<br>
If I had to pick who got the camp based on the conversation I would pick the first group. But both sides made no effort to compromise.<br>
<br>
Fact is neither side was right and neither side was wrong. Though the second group, in my opinion, had every intention of bullying the first if possible. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=dromel>Dromel</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 17<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(1/2/02 10:57:19 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Winds of Destiny?</span><hr size=1> &quot;You do realize that's what we are doing&quot; is a sarcastic rude and abrasive statement.

You moved from the cook camp down to the jester PH room after we passed you by. So if you want to get technical you didnt &quot;have&quot; the camp when we got there. You were camping an entirely different mob that has nothing to do with the jester. Consider youself lucky I even spoke to you. I wont make the same mistake twice belive me. <br>

<br>
2 people come to a area see nothing but 2 people see spawns they been at for hours attack right away without even saying anything really at all about why and then dance about<br>
<br>
Well that is rude and they were asked twice rather nicely to stop and they were the ones cursing. So I am sorry yeah It was rude geez. Well let me see for those that flame here please go ahead let me know when you camping something that seems important to you so I can come and JUST TAKE and hold no respect for others.And dont lay the PnP stuff on me that never has really worked in most spots trust me I have had GMs come to my camps and work these so called things out and usually first come first server especially when someone has been ther for hours and the person who just got there think they deserve everything since they are so special.<br>
<br>
So remember people its about respect and communication NOT assumptions of mob crashing. Its ridiculous you really think that stuff will work later in life in a 50+ zone its why I left other servers and came here to think I can avoid this stuff. Whenever I come to a spawn pt I see someone there I either I leave and do something else or I ask when will they been done and if they could send me a tell or maybe even ask if they can sell me the item by chance if they have extra. <br>
<br>
Sorry If you think I am rude you few individuals but I know for most part people do things mostly the way I do but we just cant get away from you few people who like to ruin our days and not consider others in life just your own needs. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/urobingoodfellow.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Robin Goodfellow</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 56<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(1/2/02 2:14:43 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   For What It's Worth...</span><hr size=1> Here's what the Play Nice Policies say about &quot;camping&quot;, for what it's worth:<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr>  Contested Spawns<br>
There are cases where two or more groups wish to kill the same thing. In these cases, the groups are required to compromise. If an equitable compromise cannot be reached between players prior to EverQuest Customer Service Staff involvement, the EQCSR will mandate a binding compromise. Refusing to abide by a compromise mandated by an EQCSR will be considered disruption. It is therefore strongly suggested that groups make every attempt to reach a compromise that they can live with prior to involving an EQCSR, who may mandate a compromise that does not suit you to the extent that a player-devised compromise would.<br>

<br>
   I'm Molsone Kanayjen, leader of the Winds of Destiny.  With regards to the original post, I was not aware of it until I was informed about 30 minutes ago by Braxom, an officer in the guild. I shall stress that the WoD does not sanction, &quot;a disrespectful attitude and offensive play style.&quot;  In fact, it has been my luck to have never met a guild that would endorse bad behaviour.<br>
<br>
   Dromel has been a valuable member of WoD and has acted honorably in all my dealings with him to date.  I've received no complaints nor heard of any &quot;bad&quot; stories involving Dromel.  In fact, I've noticed Dromel to be both generous and helpful to guild and non-guild members.<br>
<br>
   Although I have not had a chance to speak with either Dromel or Glail, it would seem that both parties were offended by each other.  Though I would not have replied in the manner in which Dromel has, I take his responses to be an indication of how much he was bothered by the original incident/post. If Dromel says that he would have acted differently had the tone/content of Glail's tells been different, then I accept that as the truth. Case closed.<br>
<br>
  I harbor no ill will towards Glail, who obviously was as offended as Dromel.  I hope that any who read this post might take a moment and consider any words they might say the next time they are confronted with a situation such as this. Tolerance and compromise are usually the best ways to get things accomplished.<br>

If it makes you feel a little better to judge me when you are clueless veloxia then by all means go ahead. But when the same type of thing happens to you then you will understand. Unless everyone on this server is a bunch of spineless jellyfish that just bow to whomever decides they want to push a little with no grounds. <br>
<br>
            A guild tag dosn't put a big bullseye on someone that says &quot;If you dont get your way just send my guildys a tell and they will straiten me right out&quot;. And so far that is exactly what all of you are condoning wich is just utter bull. And if all of you pull that every time you feel like you might not get your way. Well all I can say is keep away from me I dont want anything to do with people like that. Open your mouths and talk to sombody before you judge them. <br>
<br>
Also I have a good idea where he can put his cautious eye. Try turning it on yourself, I doubt you will like what you see. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=dromel>Dromel</A> at: 1/3/02 4:24:41 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/uhalus.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Halus</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 27<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(1/3/02 5:12:33 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Winds of Destiny?</span><hr size=1> Dromel...<br>

She was commenting on your juvenile, hotheaded, get-last-word-in tone. You came back and validated what she said.<br>
<br>
I don't think a person needs to know you in game to get a feeling for your personality. It comes across loud and clear in these two pages, no matter who politely sides with you, or tries to analyze your motives. Every time you write you sound less pleasant.<br>
<br>
You promised several messages ago that it was your last message ... what happened?<br>

I don't believe it was so that you could nail yourself to it again. At any rate, you got far more lenancy (I think you called it vote of confidence) than you deserve. Now that's obviously owed to the fact that you sleep with one of the WoD officers, who is himself corrupt,  more than anything else. I believe WoD, on the guild leaders word, has chosen a good direction. They'll have a tough go at it should they decide they need carry idiots and abrasive players like yourself because of out of game relationships.<br>

So consider the last word mine.  Unless Jaxy wants to unlock the thread, say something else, and lock it again. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

Sorry to everyone if I let this go on longer than it needed to.  Once upon a time there was a ledgitimate point to this thread, in my opinion.  Ah well.<br>
