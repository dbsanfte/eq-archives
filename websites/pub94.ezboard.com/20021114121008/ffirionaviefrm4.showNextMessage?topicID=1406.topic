I feel like my head is about to explode. This is entirely false. I have never, ever made a statement like this, and yet this is the second or third time I've been accused of doing so. I don't believe this, which means that I am incapable of even giving you this message subconsciously.<br>
<br>
This also indirectly relates to my being called &quot;self-righteous&quot; and &quot;egotistical.&quot; Who decided to start that bandwagon? Because now I'm having to put up with it all the time, and not only does it not make sense (from my perspective), it's a quality that I've always hated in others, and it affects me more than you might think it does.<br>
<br>
All right, this isn't a complaint so much as it is a plea. I want someone to provide me with reasons for you to feel this way. Paraphrase or quote or whatever. Show me why I'm too hot for this server. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/udorphen01.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Dorphen 01</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://home.kc.rr.com/ford91sho/kermit3.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 83<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(9/18/02 9:24:36 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1418.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: WTF</span><hr size=1> You respond negitivly in almost any and every post you make.

Please support this claim.<br>
<br>
I realize that you did say &quot;almost any and every,&quot; but I have a feeling that you haven't read any non-Soapbox posts of mine. And that's the purpose of this forum anyway, so I don't know why I in particular should take heat for complaining. I also don't agree with your saying that I belittle anyone who argues with me. It may have happened before, but it was only once I was completely fed-up with that person. I think that you are exaggerating, but then, that's just my opinion.<br>
<br>
Egotism and self-righteousness are similar descriptions, and I personally don't think either apply to me. Both would indicate that I am so convinced that what I am and what I do is great and infinitely superior to what anyone else does, but I rarely compare myself and my actions to other people. If speaking out against someone or something and not even mentioning yourself in the equation qualifies as doing that, well -- there's so many nice and intelligent egotists here that I can only take that as a compliment. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/utzarothfv.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Tzaroth FV</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 511<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(9/18/02 10:34:53 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1418.topic&index=5>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: WTF</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> Sheesh.

This is one of Madrain's posts in the Captain's latest thread. I don't think any of my posts in the past few weeks have been meaner than this (and it's not that harsh). By the way, I agree with what he says here. This isn't an attack against Madrain. And what about Snout (who has admittedly grown on me since the confrontation we had)? Or the occasional Isharra (who I also feel is cool) post?

Sorry Taz, you aren't unwelcome here in my books, but your posts are rarely upbeat.  95% of the time you are either attacking someone (even if I agree with you, you still are) or are pawing over something about FV you think isn't good enough.  Hey, criticism can be useful, but that's still what you are doing.  The statement stands.  And no, I'm not going to pull quotations, you know where you've posted.<br>
<br>
Don't take things so personally Taz. I think that's 90% of the reason you are having trouble being happy.  It was all in good fun, and on a completely irreverent thread.  Shintou doesn't threaten to kill quite everything either, if you haven't noticed.  And I accused him of that also.<br>

I get blamed for alot Tzaroth.  I had to take quite a hiatus from the Soapbox after getting extremely miffed at Vall Shadowstrife and Mollycat, who were constantly attacking Shintou.<br>
<br>
Shin and I aren't necessarily friends or anything, but I do like the guy, and I try to stick up for people I like.  I think I might've said a piece for you before Tzaroth, even if in another thread I was against you.  And I like to be vocal.  *shrugs*<br>
<br>
I rarely get too offended by things these days.  I stop and try to ignore it if that happens.  I defended cyber in the cyber thread, because while cyber does not equal roleplay, cyber doesn't discredit either, at least in my books.<br>
<br>
I rant against Ollias because I don't like the tone of his post.  It's demeaning, as if everyone with a roleplayed racial hatred is unimaginative.<br>
<br>
I honestly don't see how ANY roleplay is bad, considering how rare it is.<br>
<br>
That said, I try to help out in General Chat if I can.  I post Kudos from time to time.  Or some random nonsense in OT/OOC.  Or a story in Bard for a Day.  Or silliness in Hero Heart Tavern.<br>
<br>
I think what gets you a bad rap is that, as Tzaroth, your whole time posting almost seems as if it is entirely in the Soapbox.  Some people may not know that you were Ryael (sp) or Skrag or what have you, and that you posted non-flamy things.<br>
<br>
And yeah...Valquiss exaggerate sometimes.  Exaggeration is a lovely tool.  I wish someone would exaggerate my rambling incoherence sometime. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon3.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/usarhea.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Sarhea</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_redspot.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Tu'Rilthiil Bladedancer</span><br>  Posts: 1523<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(9/19/02 12:45:06 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1418.topic&index=10>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> <BR><img src=http://sarshouse.homestead.com/files/images/sar.gif width=52 height=126></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: WTF</span><hr size=1> no need to exaggerate it hun, it's larger than you.<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

Tzaroth would be proud of ya. Your post is consistent with the low standard that he has set for taking cheap shots. He would also be proud of your 953 posts, a goal he strives to achieve someday. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/uoliiasmoorglade.showPublicProfile?language=EN>OliiasMoorglade</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 381<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(9/19/02 7:18:43 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1418.topic&index=17>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.thephosphorbox.com/cptrply-small.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: WTF</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> I rant against Ollias because I don't like the tone of his post.

&quot;Tzaroth=Smart ass who adds nothing to any post he chimes in. He just throws out his negative comments in hopes to show how cool and above everyone he is. Hes an idiot and lacks witt, the world would be better off w/o him.<br>

<br>
Swap Tazaroth and Shazzy's name and see if it changes anything.  Now swap in the names Bert and Ernie, or Hope and Crosby or Booker T and Goldust.  Does it change anything?  <br>

The trend of making meaningless attacks against people for making meaningless attacks has gotten tired already.  Let's at least AIM to be constructive shall we? <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/umaxvs.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Maxvs</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 59<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(9/19/02 1:10:06 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1418.topic&index=19>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: WTF</span><hr size=1> Leave Tzaroth alone. He is an important part of this community. You see, every message board needs to have a resident troll. Somebody you love to hate. So leave the man alone and let him do his job. He is good at it. <p><br>

EDIT:  I would like to point out that Saiba is our official board troll here...Tzaroth doesn't even compare, because his posts have a theme and coherence, even if they're vague.  Saiba doesn't even play here anymore and manages to come up with flames off the top of her head.<br>
<br>
In the sport of board trolling, Tzaroth = Little league, Saiba = at least collegiate play. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/umadrain.showPublicProfile?language=EN>madrain</A> at: 9/19/02 1:29:25 pm<br></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top">  Page  <b>1</b> <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.showMessageRange?topicID=1418.topic&start=21&stop=27>2</a> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.showPrevMessage?topicID=1418.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.showNextMessage?topicID=1418.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a self href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1418.topic&index=20><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/classic/addReply.jpg border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"><a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.threadControl?topicID=1418.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/professional/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands</a><br> <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=1418.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=1418.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub94.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="firionaviefrm1">Firiona Vie General Chat<option value="firionaviefrm9">OT/OOC Forum<option value="firionaviefrm4">The Soapbox<option value="firionaviefrm58">Telegrams!<option value="firionaviefrm47">Guilds and Associations<option value="firionaviefrm10">A Bard for a Day<option value="firionaviefrm23">Hero Heart Tavern<option value="firionaviefrm15">The Polling Booth<option value="firionaviefrm40">Kudos!<option value="firionaviefrm48">Ye Olde Coffeeshop<option value="firionaviefrm57">Apep's Coffee Talk<option value="firionaviefrm2">The Market Square<option value="firionaviefrm22">The Tradeskill Shop<option value="firionaviefrm38">The Spell Library<option value="firionaviefrm59">The Battlefield<option value="firionaviefrm39">Renaissance Festival<option value="firionaviefrm42">Roleplayers Wanted/LFG<option value="firionaviefrm43">The Fighter's Den<option value="firionaviefrm44">Tower of Magick<option value="firionaviefrm45">Altar of Faith<option value="firionaviefrm12">Suggestion Box<option value="firionaviefrm6">Signature Testing<option value="firionaviefrm7">Patch Messages<option value="firionaviefrm49">Apep's Dead Horse Forum</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#A62A2A>- </font><a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie>Firiona Vie</a><font color=#A62A2A> - </font><a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4>The Soapbox</a> <font color=#A62A2A> - </font><br><br><br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 7.0.8<br>Copyright ©1999-2002 ezboard, Inc.<br>Accelerated By <a href=http://www.wbs.com/ezboard.html>JXEL</a></center></body></html>
