<br>
&quot;She called me a what?&quot; <br>
<br>
No Moon had just looked at me with an expression of shock and disdain I thought his wolfish features were incapable of making. <br>
<br>
&quot;I believe it was a 'puppy spirit.'&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;That’s...&quot; the ghost-wolf paced, glared at me, and paced some more. &quot;That's downright undignified.&quot; <br>
<br>
I had just returned from another night of dancing across the world with Kimaya and couldn't wait to tell No Moon how she had described him. His reaction was exactly what I expected. <br>
<br>
&quot;Puppy spirit... I'm the noble ghost of a ronin wolf! I am No Moon, born under an eclipse, Jester of the White Pack and guardian of your moody half-elven self for decades. Puppy spirit my fluffy white tail...&quot; <br>
<br>
I waved him off as he settled into grumbling. <br>
<br>
&quot;I've some hunting to do, No Moon. Coming?&quot;<br>
<br>
The wolf glared at me. I caught the distant hint of a smile in his eyes, though. I did not know he wouldn't be smiling when he next looked at me.<br>
<br>
***<br>
<br>
Without warning death came for me, and death wore the face of a mourning father. <br>
<br>
I entered Halas slowly, a sack full of mammoth meat and other things weighing me down. It had been a good hunt, a good few days on the plains, and my mind was at peace. <br>
<br>
Then McTaigne slammed the warhammer into me, shattering my armor, shattering bone. <br>
<br>
With a slowness reserved for dreams and hallucinations, I fell to my knees. <br>
<br>
The barbarian stood over me, his hammer pulled back, ready for another strike, a look in his eyes I have only seen in creatures who hungered for my blood. <br>
<br>
I fell, more from weakness than self-preservation, and that fall saved me. A savage blow aimed at my head instead splintered the bones in my shoulder, sent my broken body sliding across the snowy platform at the city’s entrance. <br>
<br>
My arm hung limply, too low on my body. I felt ribs, whole ribs, moving inside me as if they possessed a will of their own. A hum entered my head slowly, growing in power, numbing everything that happened around me. I saw booted feet moving quickly, distant shouts, meaningless chaos. It didn’t matter. I was dying. <br>
<br>
Calmly, I watched my own blood color the snow pressed against my face. The more the crimson stain grew, the slower my heart beat. It was beautiful. <br>
<br>
Then suddenly the humming in my brain became a roar. Harsh Northman voices cried out. I heard a call for a shaman, I heard prayers to the Tribunal, to Mithaniel Marr. Someone, a merchant girl I’d often sold my wares to, knew I once upon a time followed Tunare, and whispered a clumsy, impromptu prayer to the goddess in my name. <br>
<br>
But above it all I heard McTaigne’s voice, the howl of a gut-wounded animal. And I heard him yelling Kathairne’s name. I heard him say she was dead. <br>
<br>
***<br>
<br>
I awoke in a secluded hut. An old beastlord looked at me with a combination of pity and bafflement, arms folded across his chest. <br>
<br>
“The Ravenfolly lives,” he said, seeing my eyes open. I nodded. Too much of me hurt to speak. <br>
<br>
“I don’t know what I should tell ye, boy,” he said, scratching his beard. “The shamans were able to put ye back t’gether again, though I’m sure it’s an imperfect patchin’ – auld McTaigne did a good job a’knocking ye around.”<br>
<br>
I stared at him.<br>
<br>
“The girl is dead – McTaigne’s girl.” He paused, scratched his beard again. “Yer auld girl, ‘afore she run you off.” <br>
<br>
I closed my eyes, winced, balled my fists in frustration. It all hurt. Everything hurt. So much. <br>
<br>
“T’was an accident, as far as we kin tell. The lass slipped and fell by the water, hit her head, fell inna water, nobody thar t’see it. Nobody thar t’save her, either. Happens sometimes, to small children, at least. T’was an accident. But then thar’s you.” <br>
<br>
I opened my eyes. <br>
<br>
“Thar’s been some talk, ‘bout you, ‘bout yer family name. Thar’s been tha’ kinda talk since thar’s been Ravenfollys, ‘course, but it’s been a while since we’ve had somethin’ happen like this. Long time since a Ravenfolly’s taken up with a Halaswoman, even if ye had separated yer ways.” <br>
<br>
The beastlord and I looked at each other for a while, neither of us knowing what to say. <br>
“Why didn’t you let me die?” I croaked. My throat felt filled with pebbles. “Why didn’t you just let McTaigne kill me?”<br>
<br>
“And ye would rather’a died than know she was gone, wouldn’t ye,” he said, crouching down beside me. I nodded. “Aye, I can understand tha’. But we couldna do that, though there were many who woulda liked to see yer line gone from this world.”<br>
<br>
He stood up, scratched his beard again. <br>
<br>
“But we saved ye fer McTaigne’s sake. Because while it’s a curse to love a Ravenfolly, it’s an even bigger curse to kill one. Tha things that happened to those who’ve murdered yer ancestors, well… they’re tales  not fit fer tellin’ by anyone. ‘sides, Ravenfollys are awful good at gettin’ themselves done in.  Don’t need to take that task upon ourselves, I say.” <br>
<br>
He started to leave, stopped at the door. <br>
<br>
“We don’t know what to do with ye, lad. Stay, leave, throw yerself on yer sword – matters not to us, ‘cept McTaigne, and by the look I see in yer eyes I think ye’d let him finish ye now and be happy fer it. Stay here ‘til yer healed. Ye’ve been a good friend to the beastlords of Halas while we’ve known ye. And I’m sorry fer ye, boy. She was a good lady.” <br>
<br>
I stared at the empty door for a long time before darkness took me.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=lest>Lest</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 185<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(10/22/02 12:20:13 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm10.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=532.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> loss</span><hr size=1> II.<br>
<br>
Days on the tundra trying to put myself back together again bled one into another, days of white snow and black skies and blood. <br>
<br>
The pixie watched me the entire time, for once unable to put a smile on my face.<br>
<br>
I hunted for days straight, killing any creature that eyed me with malice. Spiders, orcs, goblins... mammoths I hunted out of habit, hunted them like a predator, silently, or roaring wordless cries that the pixie would later tell me sounded like grief. <br>
<br>
The pack watched over me, and Willowblossom, and NO Moon, from a distance. I should have died. I was too far gone to realize I'd abandoned any value I had on my life. <br>
<br>
Through it all pain the color of the night sky ached in my bones, the wounds McTaigne had given me healing slowly. <br>
<br>
And then, one moment, the haze fell away from my eyes and the world began to move around me again. <br>
<br>
Willowblossom found me huddled in the south tower, bloody, beaten, wild-eyed. My fingers throbbed; at some point I'd begun fighting barefisted. I had lost my helm, but the pixie dragged it behind her like an unwelcome gift. <br>
<br>
&quot;You're different,&quot; she said. &quot;You're back. I can see you in your eyes again.&quot; <br>
<br>
I nodded. My breath came in shallow gasps. <br>
<br>
&quot;You're supposed to say something, like you're a sore for sight-eyes, or something, Lest,&quot; the pixie pouted. I shrugged, held out my hand. She floated to me and came to rest in my palm. <br>
<br>
&quot;Well... I'm sorry about that girl. I am.&quot; She curled up in teh palm of my hand, wrapped her arms around my thumb, the closest approximation to a hug she could muster. The affection I had for her came flooding into me, and I realized what I had to do. <br>
<br>
&quot;I need you to go away for a little while, Willow,&quot; I said softly. <br>
<br>
The pixie perked up and looked at me so crossly I feared for my safety. <br>
<br>
&quot;You're not safe. Nobody's safe around me. I need you to go away, so you'll be safe.&quot;<br>
<br>
Willowblossom stood, picked up her satchel, swung it 'round and 'round, and bonked me on the tip of my nose. <br>
<br>
&quot;Don't you dare be a serve-selfing, you superstickious lout!&quot; she shouted. She got a good grip on my eyelashes and pulled. &quot;I'm not leaving you alone, because you're in a STATE, and you shouldn't leave people in a STATE alone. And I'm a pixie. I'm much more powerful than any old family curse you think you might have. Stupidhead.&quot; <br>
<br>
The pixie plopped down on my hand again, folded her arms across her chest, and glared. <br>
<br>
***<br>
<br>
I spent a day gathering my scattered belongings off the tundra. No Moon joined me, but spoke not a word for a long time. <br>
<br>
&quot;I'm leaving here soon, No Moon,&quot; I said, finally. <br>
<br>
&quot;Good.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;I need a few days. I'm not well enough to travel. Don't have the strength to work my magics right. Need to pack up some stuff, justify a trip to the moon.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Don't need any justifications, lad. Big man with a hammer, your blood on it, that's pretty good justification.&quot; <br>
<br>
I knelt down, picked up a backpack full of food I'd scrounged off the tundra surface. <br>
<br>
&quot;I don't want to leave. The Kelethin won't have me. I... I liked it here.&quot; <br>
<br>
&quot;You'll like other places, boy.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;I hope so.&quot; <br>
<br>
&quot;Written Kathairne a letter yet?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;She's dead, No Moon.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;We've had this conversation before. Have you written?&quot;<br>
<br>
I paused. <br>
<br>
&quot;I will. When I'm ready. When I know how to say I'm sorry.&quot;  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showUserPublicProfile?gid=gneen>Gneen</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Gnomish Bard</span><br>  Posts: 73<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(10/22/02 10:04:08 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm10.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=532.topic&index=2>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: loss</span><hr size=1> In a class by yourself.

<br>
When I was small, I wrote letters to the dead. <br>
<br>
It was No Moon's idea; when he was alive he was intensely in touch with the spirits of those gone, and now that he's left this mortal plane, he's equally in touch with the living. <br>
<br>
Once upon a time he told me to write my twin sister, who died when she was but a child. I did, and it always made me feel better. <br>
<br>
I sat by a campfire outside Halas, quill and parchment at hand, twilight growing on the cloudy horizon. And I wrote to the newly deceased. <br>
<br>
***<br>
<br>
Dearest Kathairne; <br>
<br>
I will never again see snow fall without thinking of you. <br>
<br>
Every man needs a first love; she may not be his only, nor his last, but we must each learn to love in that new and thrilling way only the young and innocent can feel. <br>
<br>
You, Kathairne, were my first love. <br>
<br>
I will never again hear the lilt of a Northwoman's accent without thinking of you. <br>
<br>
I thought of marrying you, Kathairne, in the days after our days... I thought of a farm in the Karanas, of learning to work the earth, of locking away my swords and living and loving. I thought of little children with your eyes and your accent and your happiness. <br>
<br>
On a long trip to Shadow Haven, long ago, I spent every penny I had on a pair of wedding rings, you know. Magical wedding rings, that would fit any finger. But then we talked and things changed. I kept the rings. I have them now. I'll have them likely forever, now. I'm sorry. <br>
<br>
I will never see green eyes or fiery hair again without thinking of you. <br>
<br>
I don't know where we go when death comes; I don't know if we'll meet again in another place. But there is reason to believe that I am partly to blame for your early departure of this world. There is nothing I can do to fix that. Just know that a small piece of me went with you. <br>
<br>
I told you I'd return, before I left. I said I'd always return. Maybe there was more to talk about. I know we were never meant to be, but my world was better knowing you were in it. <br>
<br>
I will never... there are many things I will never do again without remembering you, Kathairne. I hope you know that. <br>
<br>
With love,<br>
<br>
Lest-ye-forget Ravenfolly<br>
<br>
***<br>
<br>
I folded the paper thrice, as always, and dropped it into the fire. <br>
<br>
No Moon sat just outside the fire light, watching. <br>
<br>
&quot;See she receives it, if you can,&quot; I whispered. <br>
<br>
The wolf just stared, his face a mask of mourning. <br>
