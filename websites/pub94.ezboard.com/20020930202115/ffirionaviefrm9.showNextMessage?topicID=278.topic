<br>
You always have to stay in 3rd person perspective, and you move via mouse movement.<br>
<br>
Shadowbane is a PvP game that <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> does</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> require leveling to stay competitive.  Level spreads are less important, but you have more levels.  I watched a level 90 slaughter three level 60's by himself.<br>
<br>
I have followed Shadowbane for 2 years now ... and am a Beta tester.  I think it's and *Interesting* game, but it still far from being released to the public (SB isn't even in open beta yet), and is a PvP game, plain and simple.<br>
<br>
If you like PvP, you'll probably dig Shadowbane ... but it's important to make that distinction.  If you don't like PvP, don't bother with SB ... cause thats what the games all about.<br>

Like EQ mixed with ...Warcraft  :</span><hr size=1> I don't think it's very fair to compare SB with Sullon Zek.  I really don't.  Sullon Zek has a reputation for it's griefers and lack of rules.  There are few spoken rules in SB, but players are expected to police themselves.  Ok, sounds good in theory, works bad in practice.  Griefers will always be there.  But if you'll spend some time on their message boards you might notice that griefers are marked targets already.  Sure, many people will kill randomly, but true griefers that kill over and over again are going to make big enemies very quick.  It's not nice to repeatedly kill a newbie that's friends with the very big guild that owns a huge city just down the street.  I doubt there's going to be very much game regulated faction in this game.  It's all going to be player and guild regulated.<br>

Like EQ mixed with ...Warcraft  :</span><hr size=1> LOL you obviously don't know what either of you are talking about<br>
<br>
<br>
It is not released.  Unless you are a beta tester you have not played it.  - just wanted to state that outright.<br>
<br>
Next, it is not only in 3rd person point of view. - what makes you think that....check out their site.<br>
<br>
Next, it is like Warcraft in that you build buidies and cities and have npc men at your disposal.  Yes on a smaller scale, but still, you do.<br>
<br>
And, if you have not realized, Sony is likely very damn scared of this game.<br>
<br>
Did you notice the price increase for monthly fees.  Did you notice that they will be offering people to buy 12 month subscriptions at a low rate if it is done before the 25th of April, or 24 mo subscriptions.  The 12 mo will come out to $9 per mo, and 24 mo will be less then $8 per mo.<br>
<br>
They fear they will lose people, and this scheme is brilliant, because those of use who are frequent users will perhaps just decide to go and buy a longer / cheaper subscription.  And when that better game comes out... and it will, trust me.  Then those with a tight budget will stay at EQ because they have already made the investment, or those who just say well, I am too cheap to pay for anotehr when I have myfriends here  AND I already paid the next year or 2 in advance.  ...this is all a possibility.<br>
<br>
And if you do not go with the longer economy subscription then, ...you are still going to pay the increased amount.<br>
<br>
What my post is doing here is introducing the reality of the competition and giving a patient and intelligent person the chance to see what else lies out there.  So when they make this financial decision, they might realize that it could be wiser to stay with a short subscription so when the Better game comes out then they are sort-of-free because they have not made the financial commitment.<br>
<br>
And what if I am wrong what if Shadowbane will not be better.  Well, I have only the info they have posted on their site to go by right now.  As do you .  So until you read, and download from their site, do not post ignorant and totally false claims about this game, because so far what you both have said is truely false.<br>

<br>
Now then, I am a Beta tester.  I played Shadowbane this morning.  3rd person is the <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>  only</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> view you have available.  Screenshots can be missleading, people usually zoom in for screen shots, but it is difficult to play the game unless you zoom out to a distance that is very similar to Diablo2.<br>
<br>
Shadowbane is not even close to being relaesed.  It poses no realistic threat to EQ, and Verant knows this.<br>
<br>
What the other posters were trying to say is that Shadowbane is based around PVP.  Yes PVP may not be the same on sullon zek as it will be on SB, but the principal is the same.<br>
<br>
If you don't like fighting other players now, your not going to like fighting other players tomarow.  Which means, you should avoid Shadowbane.<br>
<br>
And you know what?  Anything you read on the Shadowbane message boards that wasnt said by a Wolfpack or Ubi employee, is utter pure crap.  Those folks arent beta testers, they havent <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> played the game</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->.<br>
<br>
I would suggest that if you are interested in Shadowbane, you bookmark the site and check back every month or so and wait until they start open beta.<br>
<br>
Then you can decide if Shadowbane is right for you.<br>

<br>
I am Anders, I posted the intial thread for the purpose stated in my second post.  Basically, so people can find out more info on their own.  <br>
<br>
I definately know only what I have interpreted from the site.  I think I stated that clearly.  I definately do not claim to know any specifics, but instead left a link so others can find out more.<br>
<br>
Yes, perhaps I should have left a link to the main page like you have done, Grankhul.  But instead I left a link to a page which is a link from the main page.  So, it is an official link and not some piece of crap made up reality.<br>
<br>
Anyway.  I left that link because I found the info / story it pointed to to be rather interesting and very exciting.<br>
<br>
So, before this goes into a flame fest, I think we should open the freeze and pull out our chilled beers and just site around and talk about this new thing on the horizon called Shadowbane.<br>
<br>
Grankhul, I am happpy you posted here.  I would very much like to pick your brain about various aspects of Shadowbane.<br>
<br>
Is it true that you can opt to not play in pvp mode?<br>
- if so, how and what are the restrictions?<br>
<br>
The site still says they are planning to release the game in the first half of this year, but your above posts sounds like that is not a possibility.<br>
<br>
Please tell me what you might know regarding its release date.<br>
<br>
Additionally, have you an idea of how much they will charge per month.  I am sure that they would not share that info with beta testers, but perhaps you might have heard something.  I know the site says it will be comparable to the other games of its genre, but there is a big difference between $10 and $15  per month.<br>
<br>
I think that is all.  <br>
<br>
Yes, you are right that the screenshots are misleading regarding first person.  I don't know how I was duped.<br>
<br>
Lastly, what is the name of your character in beta, the char you play currently.<br>
<br>
<br>

No. With the exception of your starting city (we call these gm-run cities, as opposed to player run cities) players may attack each other freely.  There are no restrictions.<br>

Wolfpack has never been very good at keeping dates.  &quot;First Half of 2002&quot; is just a tentative target date, it isn't a &quot;confirmed&quot; date.  Depending on how beta testing goes, I would estimate a 2003 release.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> Additionally, have you an idea of how much they will charge per month.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Wolfpack has stated that what they charge will be &quot;competitive&quot;, and they usualy suggest a 15$ per month price tag.  That is of course subject to change <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> , but plan on paying at least 15$ a month.<br>
