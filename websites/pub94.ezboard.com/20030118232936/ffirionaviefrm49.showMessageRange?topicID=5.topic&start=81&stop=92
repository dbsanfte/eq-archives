You can bitch and moan and complain all you want about Sleepers tomb, but if you are not capable of getting into the zone, or are in a guild who is capable of getting into the zone.... Then you are a non factor in the decision to wake the sleeper or not...<br>
<br>
<br>
Have I woke the sleeper? no<br>
Have I attempted to wake the sleeper? no<br>
<br>
and Neither has my guild.<br>
<br>
I love it how you can be just a nice person 99% of the time.... Sit for hours helping people... Some people who came here and slammed me, without any part of my game, because I wanted to help.<br>
<br>
I said those words that Fuvi typed but they were taken out of context and You dont know the whole story, so keep judging and flaming.. I am to the point where I know who my friends are, and I know who actually cares about me. I just love to see why and how people can turn on you so fast, in an instance.. When they dont know the whole story, when they dont know what happened.<br>
<br>
Humle- You should not preach about people changing.... I dont even know who you are. I thought i did, but you are like a totally different person to me. Thank you for the fun times, for whats its worth, I hope are happy in whatever you do.<br>
<br>
And About fuvi. I hope you all dont get to know the real fuvi, I dont want you to know what I know, I dont want you to realise what I have went through and put up with from him.And i put up with him because of the good side he put out, of what people come here and express. But there is another side to him, that I could no longer tolerate, I hope you all dont see that and he changes, Because I dont think anyone deserves that...<br>

<br>
1] Fuvi clearly has a vested interest in getting back at FaF. Im not sure why more people cant see that... Look at it linearly.<br>
<br>
A] He gets kicked out (for whatever reason).<br>
B] He gets banned from the guild boards.<br>
C] He comes here with what was internal guild information.<br>
<br>
Few people questioned his motivation, which surprised me. He says he posted this for the good of the server, and that may or may not be part of it, but dont be blind to his other obvious motivations.<br>
<br>
FaF has been on the ropes through the string, which is clearly what he intended. Dont kid yourself.<br>
<br>
2] I dont know Fuvi personally, and am not biased as a result by any friendship with him. In the face of much support for how nice and how honest he is, I would like to point out a few things I noticed.<br>
<br>
A] If there are people in FaF he still cares for, and its only a few folks he doesnt like, he should have gone about things differently. Taking this to the boards was a selfish retaliatory move and hurts everyone in his ex-guild, including those he cares for. Maybe he deserved better after 9 months, I dont know...but I do know that bringing internal guild stuff to a public forum, especially via a subject as touchy as The Sleeper, is in very very poor taste. Hes trying to take the &quot;high road&quot; by alerting the server to internal FaF discussions, but there is no &quot;high road&quot; here. <br>
<br>
B] He admits to intentionally withholding loot just to see what Bako would do, which is a bunch of crap in my book. Thats manipulation at its finest. If hes capable of that hes clearly capable of other things...like starting a post string alerting the server to FaF's plans for the sleeper, to get back at them.<br>
<br>
Like I said, I dont know him. But based on what Ive seen and based on his own words, he doesnt seem that saintly to me.<br>
<br>
3] It is **really** easy for those who cant wait the Sleeper yet to say &quot;Oh, we're not going to, dont worry&quot; because the temptation isnt there. Its like being hungry with no food in front of you.<br>
<br>
Its a different story when the food is there, and so close... <br>
<br>
I remember someone on a Sleeper thread on this board saying &quot;Its not a question of whether it will happen or not, but when, and I hope its FaF or Reso who gets it.&quot;<br>
<br>
Realistically, if its there, it will get taken down by someone eventually. I agree it was a horrendous move for VI to create a situation where content can be modified by the ambitions of a few people, but for the moment, thats the way it is. If its not the ambitions of FaF, it will be another guild, eventually.<br>
<br>
Im not going to applaud FaF for considering it, but I will applaud them for being honest about considering it. They could have denied it, even after Fuvi's accusations.<br>
<br>
4] I dont agree with Bako's quote about people who arent involved directly in the situation not airing their opinions. Everyone is entitled. And while 98% of the people who've posted here may not ever see the Sleeper or be affected by the decision to wake it, people are concerned about the callousness of waking it in the first place.<br>
<br>
I do think that this situation has been blown massively out of proportion, though. Its one zone. Waking the sleeper will mean that 4 mobs that are &quot;fun&quot; to kill will no longer be there. <br>
<br>
*blinks*<br>
<br>
Fun.<br>
<br>
Doesnt seem like &quot;fun&quot; to me. <br>
<br>
Im not chosing to view waking the Sleeper as a betrayal of the serverwide community. I say wake the damn thing. Get it over with. Lets move on...<br>
<br>
...which is what Fuvi should have done in my humble opinion instead of exacting revenge in a public forum by broadcasting internal guild discussions.<br>

<br>
I dont think you understand my comment quiet how you took it. So let me explain further. I dont think people who are not invulved with the hype, the headache, the push and the presure invulved in sleepers tomb have an opinion that is strait... things are not always the same when looking from outside the window as it is when your inside. Most people on the outside see it at a slightly different angle.. but until you have experienced what it is like to be in the situation, then you cant posably understand the situation. This is why I said you were a non factor... But not a non factor as in you dont count at all. But a Non factor as in, you opinions should not influence mine or that of my guild.<br>
<br>
Its kinda like a jury for a trail.. they are not exposed to the media or outside opinion, because that opinion can influence people, when they really dont understand the situation.<br>

Just post the date someplace conspicuous so we who don't give a shit about Sleeper's Tomb can get the hell out of Kerafyrm's way. k thx la~.<br>
