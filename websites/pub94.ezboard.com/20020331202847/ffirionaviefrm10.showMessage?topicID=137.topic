<br>
Kimaya was running around in the desert, picking up more sand to throw on the pixies the next time she was in the Fay woods.  She was camouflaged again, since Kenyon told her that when she was running around, sometimes it was better to be shy.  He said she would get into less trouble that way.  Well, she didn't like to get into trouble, so she tried to do what Kenyon said.  Most of the time.<br>
<br>
As she tripped happily over a sand dune, she stopped running.  She saw something that made her want to be careful and quiet so she could get a better look.  It was another one of those other elves, the ones that aren't welcome in the woods where she met Kenyon.  She didn't sneak too closely, since he was busy writing something and she knew how hard it was to write words that could still be understood later.  But she got close enough to see that he had that same kind of pinch around his eyes that she'd seen on the faces of all the rest of the other elves she met -- the one that always made something inside her feel achey.  She could tell that he was in pain, too.<br>
<br>
She could tell from the way he was sitting that his back was probably sore.  And though she wanted to reach out and touch it to make it feel better, she knew that wasn't what really hurt him.  She knew because Kenyon told her.  <br>
<br>
Soon after she met Kenyon, she had heard everyone talking about the other elves and how mean they are.  When she asked why they're mean he said they just didn't know any better, all they knew was hurt and pain.  She remembered that she suggested that maybe if they knew they were loved they'd feel better so all she'd have to do is go love them, and then felt like it was a stupid thing to say because Kenyon just got all serious again.<br>
<br>
But when she looked at the darkened furrow on the tired-looking other elf she wished it wasn't a stupid thing to say.  She wished she could just run over and heal him and kiss him and show him that it's okay to hurt, because then you get to feel better.  She remembered how she wanted to do that every time she met one of the other elves, but that Kenyon said that they're not all like Nestrel and some of them might get mad when she hugged them and filled them with the spirit of barkiness.  Some of them might try to hurt her, and that wouldn't help anyone.  <br>
<br>
So instead she tiptoed away and started running around for sand again.  Sometimes it was better to be shy. <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top"> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm10.showPrevMessage?topicID=137.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm10.showNextMessage?topicID=137.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm10.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=137.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/classic/addReply.jpg border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"><a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm10.threadControl?topicID=137.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/professional/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands (Moderator only)</a><br> <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm10.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=137.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm10.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=137.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub94.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="firionaviefrm1">Firiona Vie General Chat<option value="firionaviefrm2">The Market Square<option value="firionaviefrm4">The Soapbox<option value="firionaviefrm6">Signature Testing<option value="firionaviefrm7">Patch Messages<option value="firionaviefrm8">RP Server Rules<option value="firionaviefrm9">OT/OOC Forum<option value="firionaviefrm10">A Bard for a Day<option value="firionaviefrm11">Announcements<option value="firionaviefrm12">Suggestion Box<option value="firionaviefrm13">Moderator's Forum<option value="firionaviefrm15">The Polling Booth<option value="firionaviefrm22">The Tradeskill Shop<option value="firionaviefrm23">Hero Heart Tavern<option value="firionaviefrm38">The Spell Library<option value="firionaviefrm39">Events<option value="firionaviefrm40">Kudos!<option value="firionaviefrm42">Roleplayers Wanted/LFG<option value="firionaviefrm43">The Fighter's Den<option value="firionaviefrm44">Tower of Magick<option value="firionaviefrm45">Altar of Faith<option value="firionaviefrm47">Guilds and Associations<option value="firionaviefrm48">Ye Olde Coffeeshop</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#A62A2A>- </font><a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie>Firiona Vie</a><font color=#A62A2A> - </font><a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm10>A Bard for a Day</a> <font color=#A62A2A> - </font><a href="http://www.firionavie.org/">Firiona Vie</a><font color=#A62A2A> - </font><br><br><br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 6.6.8<br>Copyright ©1999-2001 ezboard, Inc.</center></body></html>
