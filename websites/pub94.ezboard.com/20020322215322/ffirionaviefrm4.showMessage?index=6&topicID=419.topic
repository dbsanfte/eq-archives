I have done it a few times, but I will admit it: I'm more apt to run to the zone and try to live than die...  but yes, I will take the death if I *KNOW* my train will get people killed. (I do have a /shout &quot;Train to Zone&quot; hot key --- which I will mash repeatedly on my way to the zone).<br>
<br>
Anyhow, what I find more annoying than running a train to the zone are &quot;solo'ers&quot; who repeatedly use neighboring groups as guards... especially the ones who will run into the middle of a group doing /y /y /y with six mobs on their ass... as the group is already up to their ears in a big fight...<br>
<br>
If you get trained, take to zone, take to guards, run by groups doing /y (but stay out of aggro range!), but do NOT run smack dab in the middle of them (esp. when they're fighting) doing /y /y /y ... oh, the carnage...<br>

<br>
Why? Because if they are at the zone, they can move too.<br>
<br>
Now, if I'm running with something especially nasty on my butt, but I can hold it off a bit longer... I stop at the zoneline, shout or /say train... and zone after I see most of them moving.  So for ex. with the frenzy on my butt, I'd stop quick at the zoneline (so it would beat me up, and not others.. giving them a chance to avoid the insta-death that a level 50 mob is to a level 30 pc =P)  Same if I'm grouped and waiting on a caster to get out.. I can take a few hits, so I stand at the zoneline as long as my health allows to try to let others get out.<br>
<br>
The only time folks will die is if they go afk by the zoneline. And that, in EQ, is always risky.<br>

The zone line covers the entire north end of the zone, why can't they just run there? Or go south, I don't care, but if you're going to train, train to a FREAKING ZONE, not the &quot;safe spot&quot; where everyone is resting, which should be nowhere near the train tracks!<br>
<br>
Bleh.<br>
<br>
If you're sitting at the zone line, like with the zone to Kith which is a sort of pass/valley thing, then you ought to be prepared to zone if a train comes through. That's just part of the price of choosing to sit at the zone line rather than a little bit to the side of the zone line.<br>
<br>
I always TRY to announce trains, but if I'm just barely keeping ahead of it by using mouselook/strafe, sometimes I don't have a chance to switch hotkey banks and hit my train button. Much less type out anything close to coherent. I need more fingers. And if I see you sitting nearby, I'll try to detour around you. But if you're sitting on the train tracks, and it was one of those cases where I just couldn't call it out ahead of time... well, that falls into the &quot;hey, it's EQ, it happens&quot; category. The zone IS right there. Even if an unannounced train suddenly starts hitting you, if you're sitting right at the zone you can <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> usually</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> escape anyway.<br>
<br>
&quot;Hey, it's EQ, it happens,&quot; is usually my reaction when someone apologizes to me for a train, too. Just not worth getting worked up over, unless the guy obviously did it on purpose.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/uhalus.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Halus</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 54<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(2/28/02 4:49:43 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=419.topic&index=10>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_devil.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: Die like a real elf!</span><hr size=1> Especially on this server, where shout is fairly useless, it's pretty pointless to get mad about a train at the zone. <br>

If you're going to loiter at the zoneline, be alert. If you go AFK anywhere other than a guarded spot, don't be surprised if you take a quick trip to your bind point.<br>

I recall one time I had a train and the group just stood there and watched until I FD'd (at 12 hp).  The train then proceeded to pound them and one died.  I was equally upset at them for watching when they should have been running and myself for causing a death -- even a death that I felt they could have avoided.<br>
<br>
Also, unless the train is pounding you right there at the zone line, DO NOT hang out and warn people &quot;train coming&quot;.  Stomp the train-key on the way past, but don't stop running.  Why?  Because if you zone, the train won't even get there.  It will stop when you (or the last person with agro) exits.<br>
<br>
IMHO, if you have hp, it's nice to hold 'em if they're nipping at you, but if you're low, just zone. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/unariefv.showPublicProfile?language=EN>NarieFV</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 27<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(3/1/02 12:03:51 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=419.topic&index=16>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_bigsmile.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: Zone!</span><hr size=1> Have to agree with alot of people's comments. When I sit by a zone line, I'm fully aware of the chance I might get trained and die. And if someone does happen to train me by accident by a zone line and I am not paying attention and barely escape by the skin of my teeth, well, it's my fault for sitting at a zone and not paying attention. <br>
<br>
Only time I've ever, ever gotten really ticked off with a train by a zone line, was in the Maze, and a cutesy wood elf, with entirely too many emotes and not enough common sense, trained my group three times while medding,  then as our tank pulled, trained us again, took care of it while she zoned, then while we fought her train our tank had of course already pulled a mino which we were of course very low on mana and hp for because of her, she then pulls another train while we were fighting the mino. Two trains in one of our pulls and five trains total in less than fifteen minutes, and she was light blue as heck to me and didn't belong there, well, at that point I lost it with her. I was still polite as I could possibly be though extremely ticked at the amount of time she had wasted for all of us. But like the other poster said, if someone does it that often in a place they are obviously not prepared to handle, then I get ticked.<br>
<br>
Otherwise, I sit at the zone, I know the danger in it and it would be entirely my fault, not the accidental trainer. <p>Narie<br>

I've been fighting up in Dawnshroud on the moon by the zone line to Sanctus Seru, which is a city.  It's so rare that people fight near there that some of the few who do are in the habit of going AFK on the Dawnshroud side of the zone.  I once zoned in to see one of the few naturally argo things near there slowly beating down a cleric who was just standing there getting killed. Managed to save him too.<br>
<br>
When I see anyone who looks like they might be afk there I tell them not to do that, since there is a perfectly safe city zone right behind them.  I don't often lose control of my charm soloing, but it does happen.  And I'll be damned if I'm going to die because someone who's walked away from the computer is too lazy to zone.  I warn them in advance whenever I can, but if I have to zone after that I do it with a clear conscience.<br>
