<br>
Group 01 is full and doing well...<br>
Most of the group members are in the same guild, guild 01.<br>
Also the group leader is in guild 01.<br>
<br>
Then another member of guild 01 appears and one of the group members who are NOT in guild 01 is told that they are going to replace him with the new arrival.<br>
<br>
Then they remove this guy from group and invite the other player from guild 01.<br>
<br>
Now my question is... is this common?<br>
Is this fair to a member of the group who is settled and doing well and hoping to advance in experience and maybe have a great time and just because another guild member shows up he is removed and replaced and LFG again?<br>
<br>
Saw this happening in Velks some days ago...<br>
<br>
For me it's clear if  I form a group and start inviting people, that I stick to this people even if they have to leave or log for some time. I keep their place in group free so that they can hurry back and rejoin us. I would not replace any member of my group just because a close friend stepped by or because this individual is in my guild. They would have to wait until somebody has to leave, then I would invite them.<br>
<br>
I can only think of disbanding a certain group member if he/she proofs as a complete idiot or is a danger to the group and doesnt learn.<br>
<br>
<br>

I'm also fond of disbanding the group and forming two small groups.. but then, I don't care about loot or experience so I may be an outlier. <p><div align="center">

<br>
Makes for bad blood with the person getting shuffled out, who might have become a friend or guildmate some day, who knows? I know I always remember when malarchy like that happens to me...<br>
<br>
If the group is anticipating the arrival of another, they should let you know that before you join, so you can chose whether its worth it or not. You may have another offer at the time that, if you spurn, will not be open later.<br>
<br>
Its all about courtesy, and respect. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   Treat others with it and the Realm becomes a much easier place to be in.<br>

Ended up in that group of a couple of hours.  But even if it had been for just a few minutes, they were up front with me from the get go, so I wouldn't have minded.<br>

I admit that I would be quite upset if I had been with this group for a while, and they decided to bump me for a guild member or other friend.  I would consider it impolite.<br>

this was a common enough practice, if you weren't the cleric/chanter<br>
<br>
also in a guild group if you weren't the cleric/chanter you could expect to not get a roll on any loot that was greeded, though usually if you needed it you got a shot. My old guild policy on this type of group was first loot of said type went to the guild then  it was opened to &quot;guests&quot;.<br>
<br>
of course this server is alot smaller and generally more friendly.<br>

each to there own. As to blacklisting a guild that practices this, if they are operating this way they are more than capable of telling you to go play with someone that cares usually.<br>

<br>
As you said, &quot;on your last server&quot;.  But here, such behavior would be generally frowned upon, unless it is made clear at the beginning of the grouping that you may be bumped for guild members arriving later.<br>
<br>
The thing with the loot, though.  If I helped you get that loot, then I expect to get a share of it, whether I'm in your guild or not.  I can understand if it's a guild raid, but if it's a pick-up group, then it should be shared equally, even if most of the members of the group are of one guild.<br>
<br>
People here on FV are different for the most part, and whatever happened on your other server does not necessarily translate to the culture here.<br>

As you say, you tell them up front that if Trib members show up, then they will be given the non-Trib's spot in the group.  You tell them before had, and that person has the chance to make that choice.  It's when the person isn't told this ahead of time that it's rude.  After all, that person may have had a chance to join another group that they passed up to stay with your group.  If you then unceremoniously dump them, that wouldn't be fare.  <br>

As long as you tell people up front, then I don't consider it necessarily to be rude.<br>
