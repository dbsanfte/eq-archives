I think you're missing the importance of size of group to GM ratio when you are looking for events.<br><br>The GMs on FV, in what I have observed, look for small groups to pop events on, instead of the PC Loot Bum-Rush that happens on traditional servers.<br><br>Moreover, the smaller events DO seem connected (like they have a common plot or thread) and are not 'stock' events...<br><br>The GMs at Verant are (very obviously) not professional Paper and Pencil GMs (and, yes, there are professional paler and pencil GMs out there, who do make money at it). Regardless, they are getting better at running events, plotting, and figuring out how to work with large groups and the entire dynamic of large group events.<br><br>Since the best way to get good at plotting is to use smaller gorups of players, i APPLAUD them for not having meat-market 50-100 person 'scavenger hunt' events.<br><br>These 'scavenger hunt' and 'scripted' events (like that piece of shit Lanys T'Vyl thing they did) are frequently CRAP, have no real plot or interaction with the players. It is a 'run on rails' event... the players have no input or say in the outcome.<br><br>At least the GMs here seem to trust us, the players, and I like that. <p>Nakath<BR>The Esoteric Order</p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/uartillis.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Artillis</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_redspot.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 146<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(12/23/01 7:11:15 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=945.topic&index=6>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: We need a server event!!</span><hr size=1> There have been a numbe of GM events and will continue to be a number of SMALL GM events.

Or a Norrath-wide guildwar where everyone must take a stance (and rogue guilds would have their own quests created by the rival sides).<br>There are many opportunities, players just have to make them true.<br> <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/uxaviarstormburnt.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Xaviar Stormburnt</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 8<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(1/6/02 1:07:41 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=945.topic&index=17>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> cough</span><hr size=1> /em cough<br>bump<br><br>Xaviar <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=valquisssilverpalm>Valquiss Silverpalm</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Moderator</span><br>  Posts: 137<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(1/6/02 1:55:16 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=945.topic&index=18>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: cough</span><hr size=1> I don't know if there is any way I can say this without it sounding like a criticism, which it is not intended to be, but if you want an event, start one.  If it seems like more than you can handle on your own, get some friends or talk to your guild leaders (if you are guilded) and get other people involved.  This board is in no way responsible for the maintainance of Norrath as we know it on FV, and no one here has any greater responsibility, or ability, to make things happen than everyone else.<br><br>I think it is great when people come forward with ideas and enthusiasm, but &quot;we need more player events&quot; is not a new idea.  And agreeing that we need such events, then looking around for someone else to make it happen, doesn't tend to work.  If there was a player event I would probably show up, but I've got more than enough on my EQ plate right now without trying to organize one. So instead of telling other people they should organize events for me I'm just quiet about it, and if one happens I'll be there.<br><br>Thanks, Sarhea, for alluding to something you might be up to.  I'm interested.  Let me know if I can help.<br><br>Valquiss <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ucoinfist.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Coinfist</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 32<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(1/6/02 11:42:19 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=945.topic&index=19>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: cough</span><hr size=1> *cough* ..

Maybe some RP events that could be supplemented here on the boards, building storylines and stuff like that.  I think something nice might be built with the storylines that Banegrivm has been trying to unearth, if guilds were interested.<br><br>I don't think server-wide events are going to ever come to fruition when left in the hands of individuals, or at least most of them.  With some guild participation something really nice might be worked out.<br><br>I'm a bit low level now to do any fighting, but I'd love to come to the Arena to see some nice fights among Resolution and any others that showed up.  You could charge people admission - a low rate to watch, and a higher rate to participate based on level (I saw one tournament with 2xlvl in plat as an admission fee) and then give a portion of that to the winner, a smaller portion to the runner up, maybe even a third place, and possibly some door prize raffles of some nice gear that guilds might be hoarding.<br><br>*sigh*  I can't wait to get higher in level so I can apply to some guilds, become involved in things. <p>Shiden<br>Dark Elf Shadowknight of Innoruuk<br>Favored of the 6th Skull<br>Firiona Vie<p><center><i>"Sings we a dances of wolfs,<br>Who smells fear and slays the coward.<br>Sings we a dances of mans,<br>Who smells gold and slays his brother."</i><p>--Pagan Saying</center></p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top">  Page  <b>1</b> <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm1.showMessageRange?topicID=945.topic&start=21&stop=27>2</a> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm1.showPrevMessage?topicID=945.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm1.showNextMessage?topicID=945.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=945.topic&index=20><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/classic/addReply.jpg border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"><a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm1.threadControl?topicID=945.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/professional/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands (Moderator only)</a><br> <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm1.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=945.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm1.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=945.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub94.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="firionaviefrm1">Firiona Vie General Chat<option value="firionaviefrm2">The Market Square<option value="firionaviefrm4">The Soapbox<option value="firionaviefrm6">Signature Testing<option value="firionaviefrm7">Patch Messages<option value="firionaviefrm8">RP Server Rules<option value="firionaviefrm9">OT/OOC Forum<option value="firionaviefrm10">A Bard for a Day<option value="firionaviefrm11">Announcements<option value="firionaviefrm12">Suggestion Box<option value="firionaviefrm13">Moderator's Forum<option value="firionaviefrm15">The Polling Booth<option value="firionaviefrm22">The Tradeskill Shop<option value="firionaviefrm23">Hero Heart Tavern<option value="firionaviefrm38">The Spell Library<option value="firionaviefrm39">Events<option value="firionaviefrm40">Kudos!<option value="firionaviefrm42">Roleplayers Wanted/LFG<option value="firionaviefrm43">The Fighter's Den<option value="firionaviefrm44">Tower of Magick<option value="firionaviefrm45">Altar of Faith<option value="firionaviefrm47">Guilds and Associations<option value="firionaviefrm48">Ye Olde Coffeeshop</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#A62A2A>- </font><a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie>Firiona Vie</a><font color=#A62A2A> - </font><a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm1>Firiona Vie General Chat</a> <font color=#A62A2A> - </font><a href="http://www.firionavie.org/">Firiona Vie</a><font color=#A62A2A> - </font><br><br><br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 6.6.4<br>Copyright ©1999-2001 ezboard, Inc.</center></body></html>
