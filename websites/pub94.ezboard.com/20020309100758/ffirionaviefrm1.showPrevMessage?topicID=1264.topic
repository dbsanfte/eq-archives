She asked Dyshira if she would accompany her in a walk through the forest.<br><br>It ended up being a small gathering of us sitting and listening to her story. Here is almost all of what was said, minus all the witty banter and RPing that went on, which would make this post far longer. Also a couple of spelling corrections, the GM was obviously trying to keep up with everything going on around him.<br><br>Firiona Vie says, in Elvish, 'My. Quite a crowd indeed.'<br>Firiona Vie says, in Elvish, 'Tell me. How has the forest been? How is my dear Equestrielle in the lesser forest? The poor thing.'<br>Firiona Vie says, in Elvish, 'And it was with this very sword that I removed that precious horn.'<br>Firiona Vie says, in Elvish, 'I have not found the cure yet, but vengence and justice shall be done for this wrong.'<br>Firiona Vie says, in Elvish, 'The Faceless One shall pay.'<br>Firiona Vie says, in Elvish, 'She is a very old friend. I remember playing with her when I was just a young elf.'<br>Firiona Vie says, in Elvish, 'When I was a child, it was on this very hill that I lived.'<br>Firiona Vie says, in Elvish, 'It was a small cottage. I was raised by Galeth Veredeth '<br>Firiona Vie says, in Elvish, 'I had no idea that I was the Princess of Felwithe.'<br>Firiona Vie says, in Elvish, 'Tunare came to see me often '<br>Firiona Vie says, in Elvish, 'I thought Tunare visited all elves.'<br>Firiona Vie says, in Elvish, 'I was young. What did I know?'<br>Firiona Vie says, in Elvish, 'Then one day after Galeth had given me my lesson in sword play, he lowered his sword and told me that I had been set aside'<br>Firiona Vie says, in Elvish, 'To say the least, it was quite a weight to bare.'<br>Firiona Vie says, in Elvish, 'I remember I showed up in Kelethin one day, seeking information. It seems that there were already many myths and legends being formed about me.'<br>Firiona Vie says, in Elvish, 'Some said that I was born of th goddess.'<br>Firiona Vie says, in Elvish, 'Others that I was of royal blood.'<br>Firiona Vie says, in Elvish, 'Taken from my dead mother's arms in the still of the night.'<br><br>The story was interrupted here when a low level Ranger decided to cast an AoE spell on Firiona Vie... Miracously, he surived, but only because he gated away everytime FV tried to summon him back to deal with him. Quite annoying, but there is always one bad apple. Everyone else was very polite.<br><br>Firiona Vie says, in Elvish, 'I have no idea why elves plot to kill me'<br>Firiona Vie says, in Elvish, 'My own people'<br>Firiona Vie says, in Elvish, 'He is only lucky that Guard Crystalwind did not see his action.'<br>Firiona Vie says, in Elvish, 'Cazic's corruption is growing perhaps.'<br><br>Here there was a short conversation about the prescence of Dark Elves nearby (but not at the gathering)<br>After this, we get to the good stuff, detail about the events in the recent comic.<br><br>Firiona Vie says, in Elvish, 'I have had many encounters with Lanys and her bretheren and only very rarely have I seen one whose heart was not as black as Innoruuk's eyes.'<br>Firiona Vie says, in Elvish, 'Well, the lesser forest is a dangerous place. After all Mistmoore dwells very near.'<br>Firiona Vie says, in Elvish, 'Equestrielle is an ancient beast. I have known her all of my life. She was so beautiful. Her white mane, her glorious horn.'<br>Firiona Vie says, in Elvish, 'Very wise and very timid'<br>Firiona Vie says, in Elvish, 'The Mother watches over me and I shall watch over you.'<br>Firiona Vie says, in Elvish, 'Much sadness has taken place in this forest.'<br>Firiona Vie says, in Elvish, 'One of my companions was killed in this very forest.'<br>Firiona Vie says, in Elvish, 'Lorisyn, dear Lorisyn.'<br>Firiona Vie says, in Elvish, 'I have not seen Lyirae in several moons.'<br>Firiona Vie says, in Elvish, 'But before I set off on my next adventure, I will have to place flowers on his grave in the lesser forest.'<br>Firiona Vie says, in Elvish, 'Lorisyn was a ranger who travelled with me often. His wit and charm were only matched by the accuracy with his bow.'<br>Firiona Vie says, in Elvish, 'Lorisyn was with me when I made that fateful journey to meet with the Ring of Scale.'<br>Firiona Vie says, in Elvish, 'I was foolish to trust them so. They robbed us all of our memory.'<br>Firiona Vie says, in Elvish, 'It was then that Tunare came to me again. She touched me with a beautiful staff, the Lifeguide.'<br>Firiona Vie says, in Elvish, 'My memory returned to me immediately. I could remember everything.'<br>Firiona Vie says, in Elvish, 'The Mother entrusted this staff to me and I set off to find my companions and return their precious memories to them.'<br>Firiona Vie says, in Elvish, 'Anyhow, I first restored the memories of those who lived nearby. Sionachie, my faithful storyteller, and Lorisyn, the brave ranger.'<br>Firiona Vie says, in Elvish, 'Well, it was the Festival of Tunare.'<br>Firiona Vie says, in Elvish, 'I had restored Sionachie's memories and my trusted bard was at my side.'<br>Firiona Vie says, in Elvish, 'I saw Lorisyn in the crowd and a path cleared to allow me through.'<br>Firiona Vie says, in Elvish, 'That happens alot. People tend to clear paths when I walk.'<br><br>Findlestump, my guildmate and RL brother-in-law was playing the disgruntled dwarf and generally being a pain, and the gm responded quite a few times, amused perhaps. At this point he mentioned something about the privledges of being an Avatar.<br><br>Firiona Vie says, in Elvish, 'Chosen, Dwarf.'<br>Firiona Vie says, in Elvish, 'I am a Champion, not an avatar.'<br>Firiona Vie says, in Elvish, 'So, I walk up to Lorisyn. I could tell that I was a memory that was just out of his grasp.'<br>Firiona Vie says, in Elvish, 'Yes, I am a Paladin of the Mother.'<br>Firiona Vie says, in Elvish, 'I touched Lorisyn with my staff, and the confusion left his face.'<br>Firiona Vie says, in Elvish, 'He said simply, Firiona, you don't know how good it is to see you&quot;'<br>Firiona Vie says, in Elvish, 'Then a boulder slammed into his back and he was taken from us.'<br>Firiona Vie says, in Elvish, 'It was thrown by Ghargin Bumblok.'<br>Firiona Vie says, in Elvish, 'An ogre shaman in the command of Vahlai Ka Izal.'<br>Firiona Vie says, in Elvish, 'I stared down at his limp body in disbelief for a second too long.'<br>Firiona Vie says, in Elvish, 'The ogre escaped us.'<br>Firiona Vie says, in Elvish, 'He created a mystical portal. I had no means of knowing where he went.'<br>Firiona Vie says, in Elvish, 'We tended the dead. His twin sister lay on top of Lorisyn.'<br>Firiona Vie says, in Elvish, 'How could I refuse here, when she showed up the next day with her bow slung to her back, asking to join my party?'<br>Firiona Vie says, in Elvish, 'I had heard many tales about the young elf from her brother. I guess I already felt like I knew her.'<br>Firiona Vie says, in Elvish, 'She still travels with me.'<br>Firiona Vie says, in Elvish, 'In fact, she accompanied me just a few moons ago.'<br>Firiona Vie says, in Elvish, 'I was once again in search of the Ring of Scale.'<br>Firiona Vie says, in Elvish, 'The Mother told me that they held the secret to finding my stolen staff, the Lifeguide'<br>Firiona Vie says, in Elvish, 'We strode across the lizard's homeland boldly. Right into the Mountains of Skyfire.'<br>Firiona Vie says, in Elvish, 'On our way to their ancient home of Veeshan's Peek, we were met by Lady Zavo Za'<br>Firiona Vie says, in Elvish, 'Only not in her usual elven form, but her true form, that of a huge red dragon.'<br>Firiona Vie says, in Elvish, 'I'm afraid they are very real.'<br> Firiona Vie says, in Elvish, 'Zavo Za has even been known to spend a great deal of her time in this very forest.'<br>Firiona Vie says, in Elvish, 'She hides herself as an elf. She loves to watch our kind.'<br>Firiona Vie says, in Elvish, 'I have only heard of her killing an elf once, and that was as he killed a drake in steamfont.'<br>Firiona Vie says, in Elvish, 'Although, I don't know much about her.'<br>Firiona Vie says, in Elvish, 'Anyhow, we had a long talk, but Lyirae was quiet angry.'<br>Firiona Vie says, in Elvish, 'She seems to blame the dragons some for her brother's death.'<br>Firiona Vie says, in Elvish, 'She blames them since they stole his memory.'<br>Firiona Vie says, in Elvish, 'Hence putting him in the situation to die.'<br>Firiona Vie says, in Elvish, 'It's ranger logic.'<br><br>Everyone was amused by that... <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br><br>Firiona Vie says, in Elvish, 'Anyhow, she told us that the dragons would have nothing to do with us, but she would help us as long as we did not violate her Code.'<br>Firiona Vie says, in Elvish, 'She told us to search out one of Danak's followers.'<br>Firiona Vie says, in Elvish, 'All but one had fled to Velious to hide from our wrath.'<br>Firiona Vie says, in Elvish, 'But Ghargin Bumblok remained.'<br>Firiona Vie says, in Elvish, 'Now, I thought Lyirae was angry with the dragon, but truer rage I have never seen than the look in her eyes at that moment.'<br>Firiona Vie says, in Elvish, 'Zavo said she could not aid us with claw or tooth, as was their Code, but Ghargin had been watching and he was near.'<br>Firiona Vie says, in Elvish, 'She then took off, the wind from her wings almost blew me over. The last I saw of her was as she dove straight down into a live volcano.'<br>Firiona Vie says, in Elvish, 'At about that time, Ghargin began to taunt us, I felt something strange. He was no longer the shaman that I remembered. I could feel it through my connection with the Mother. He had been possessed by his God, the Faceless.'<br>Firiona Vie says, in Elvish, 'He was on us like a nightmare, a small version of Cazic Thule. If I had not had many brave adventurers at my side, the fight would have been very rough.'<br>Firiona Vie says, in Elvish, 'I ordered my companions not to kill him.'<br>Firiona Vie says, in Elvish, 'But they did not listen.'<br>Firiona Vie says, in Elvish, 'But merely knocked unconscious, I revived him with heals from the Mother.'<br>Firiona Vie says, in Elvish, 'After, Lyirae had bound him of course.'<br>Firiona Vie says, in Elvish, 'I promised him that I would do him no harm, if he would answer my questions.'<br>Firiona Vie says, in Elvish, 'I then grilled him for the information that I sought. Where is my staff?'<br>Firiona Vie says, in Elvish, 'He told me all that he knew and I kept my word, I cut his bonds and turned my back and walked away. I would do him no harm.'<br>Firiona Vie says, in Elvish, 'It was Lyirae would put an arrow straight into his throat.'<br><br>I cheered here, I'm a young Wood Elf, and I consider Lyirae an idol of sorts.<br><br>Firiona Vie says, in Elvish, 'Vengence belonged to her this day.'<br>Firiona Vie says, in Elvish, 'I'm afraid all these memories have worn me out.'<br>Firiona Vie says, in Elvish, 'I am going to seek solitude in the forest and commune with the Mother.'<br>Firiona Vie says, in Elvish, 'Thank you all for joining me this day.'<br>Firiona Vie says, in Elvish, 'I wish to be alone.'<br><br>Here, Firiona was going to hand coin to a player, but they promptly went LD (ouch) and she decided to let Findlestump distribute it instead.<br><br>Firiona Vie says, in Elvish, 'Dwarf, where are you?'<br>Firiona Vie says, in Elvish, 'Distribute this coin to those around as you see fit.'<br>Firiona Vie says, in Elvish, 'Be fair and just with it.'<br>Firiona Vie says, in Elvish, 'It is not much, but it is all that I have on me'<br><br>She gave him 2000 plat (someone commented about 'pocket change' for a princess, hehe) and he distriubuted it to those present, who were mostly low levels. There were about 20 of us, and it ended up being about 100 plat each, which is *very* nice on a poor server like FV. I happen to have just reached 19th, and I was about 60 plat short for spells, so I was very pleased. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/uroninsenshi.showPublicProfile?language=EN>RoninSenshi</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://members.aol.com/sageofthehalo/Kanji.jpg" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Senshi No Adakia</span><br>  Posts: 362<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(2/2/02 5:08:01 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1263.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://members.aol.com/sageofthehalo/Kanji.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: GM Event- Firiona Vie appears in GFay</span><hr size=1> Cool.

I wrote Verant a well written &quot;suggestion&quot; and dumped it onto Verant's Suggestion Box (for Developers Corner) <br><br>it went like this<br><br>------------------------------------<br><br><br>Hello there, <br><br>I play on the Firiona Vie server, which is the RP server. Thus, on this server, good versus evil actually means something, at least in terms of role playing, and more noticeably in terms of gameplay (e.g. grouping, segregation, communities, guild focus, etc) <br><br>I just recently read that a couple of GM Events just occured on my server. Great news. But why on earth are these GM events always based around the good-aligned people? Why do these GM events seem to have a pattern of Firiona Vie the Paladin always looking for help from the newbie wood elves in the Faydark? Verant please show some variety as well as balance. Even when you do these GM events to add some spice to newbie life, please keep in mind that not every newbie is some wood elf hunting in the Faydark. Please do not ignore the newbies who may be the unlucky evil-based characters, like the young Trolls hunting in the Swamp, or the apprentice evil Gnomes of Bertoxxulous hunting in Steamfont, or even the young Iksar broodlings training in the Field of Bones. Please run some GM events for their benefit once in a while. Is this sort of balance and variety too much to ask? <br><br>Thanks for any considerations<br><br> <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/umaladominus.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Maladominus</A> at: 2/2/02 7:39:41 am<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/uvallshadowstrife.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Vall Shadowstrife</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Crime Lord</span><br>  Posts: 122<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(2/2/02 9:03:18 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1263.topic&index=3>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: GM Event- Firiona Vie appears in GFay</span><hr size=1> Why can't Fironia Vie speak in paragraphs on one, smooth line?

I don't know, but it seems that when someone hears 'gm event' now, they also hear the sound of money in their pockets.  What did those people do to deserve money?  They only went thinking that they would get out of there with something just for participating.  The GM events are so cliche and dull that I think Verant feels that they have to give some sort of rewards or people won't stick around.<br><br>There was another event of some sort in North Ro a few nights back, some trolls and ogres fighting over cookies and who's were best (90% of events you read about lately appear to involve cookies).  Every one of them was selectable and weak, I didn't do anything because of the others there to stop their fun, but stuck around a bit waiting to see what would happen, and nothing did.  Very rp'ish too, good and evil people were there standing alongside one another waiting for their chance at loot.  I should have killed each of the GM's that were there in a nice RP'ing fashion, 10 trolls and ogres standing outside of Freeport is nothing short of an invasion attempt if you ask me.  I should have killed them all and gone to Freeport to demand a reward for stopping the invasion in its tracks, now that's a dynamic event.  Sure, people would have said 'Feneant you a*****e, you ruined the event!', but I could have replied 'Don't make me serve good by slitting your throat for consorting with evil'<br><br>No offense, but GM events on Everquest = Major boring, they should take their GM's and put them to better use or at least give fun events (something they apparently never though of). <br><br>[edited to remove nasty word] <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ufeneant.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Feneant</A> at: 2/2/02 11:12:53 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/uzildrax.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Zildrax</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Iksar Fanatic</span><br>  Posts: 150<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(2/3/02 12:40:19 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1263.topic&index=9>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: GM Event- Firiona Vie appears in GFay</span><hr size=1> Heh, the only reason I've wanted to encounter Firiona Vie is to have Zildrax start a philosphical argument with her.

It was good for anyone new to the game, and who didn't know about the history of some NPC's. But I did grow a little bored. The player who attacked Firiona Vie was a high elf wizard named Saurumon, or some other rip off name, of the Fellowship of the Ring wizard. He was a non roleplayer who made fun of the GM and the roleplayers at the event. If anyone meets him, be sure to give him a rough time for the unoriginal name and lousy attitude towards roleplayers. Maybe challenge him to a duel and kill him. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   Personally i would like to see more evil based GM events.
