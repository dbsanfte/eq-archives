The funny part about a guy slipping on a banna peel isn't the fall.  It's that he wasn't looking where he was puting his feet.  Everyone has done it at one time or another.  Most don't come up with conspiracies about black helicopters meanly dropping peels in front of your feet to explain it, though. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/utzarothfv.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Tzaroth FV</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Sweet and Innocent</span><br>  Posts: 696<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(10/15/02 8:33:03 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1564.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_tongue.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: Bah, Syll, you're no fun</span><hr size=1> What the fuck are you talking about? <p><table width="350" border="0"><tr><td width="144"><div align="center"><img src="http://www.geraldfield.com/nadinesplace/calvinquiz/spiff.gif" width="142" height="125" align="absmiddle"></div></td><td><div align="center"><b><font size="3">You are Spaceman Spiff!</font></b><br><font size="2">Zounds!

You've been around the boards long enough to have been able to see Syll in action. Syll's not mousy or timid. She just stopped that thread because of the comments about Las.<br>

She didn't lock it cuz she didn't wanna argue with you*grin*<br>

I also don't think it's unwarranted -- he's the one that came to the boards for opinions with an accusation and only very reluctantly admitted it *might* have been a mistake.  No one sought him out.<br>
<br>
If you want me to go on further, then this thread really becomes a discussion of Robin's personality and all the various posts he's made in the past before you came to FV, Tza.  He's got a very long history of posts about conspiracies against him.<br>
<br>
BTW, I wanted to keep this thread focused on Syll digging in and fighting in a flame thread, then locking it and running away to hide.  I don't mind at all if mods fight or not, but if you're a mod, you basically can't claim to be moderating a thread that you're fighting in when it doesn't go quite your way.  That's petty and cowardly. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ubjond.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Bjond</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/white_redspot.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 1173<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(10/15/02 9:40:10 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1564.topic&index=6>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_lightbulb.gif" align=absmiddle>  Gah ..</span><hr size=1> .. c'mon Sar.

Just because you yourself disagree with my characterization of someone or that my opinion is not flattering, does't make it a personal attack.  A personal attack would be where I go off on Robin for being gay or wearing a fur coat made from baby seals or something -- unrelated to the topic and has no purpose whatsoever other than to make him mad or feel oppressed and shut-out; ie.

There was no need for your slam against Lasgalen. He didn't ask to be judged. He was stating a grievance and only that. I conclude that it was abusive to him as a poster. You intended for people reading your post to side against Lasgalen because, in your opinion, he's annoying and he whines needlessly. You provided no evidence to support this opinion, further comments striving only to make Lanowar, a person who I no doubt believe is a stranger to you, look guilty by association.<br>
<br>
I will jump in on the Syll. topic.<br>
<br>
Syllestrae is a great mod. He's fair in his judgments, and that's all you can really ask of him. He did not &quot;hide&quot; by locking the aforementioned thread, he merely silenced what was obviously going to turn into a drawn-out flame war. And by the way, if you and Syll ever get into it .. well, my $$ is on Syll. But that's for an entirely different reason. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon3.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/usarhea.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Sarhea</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_redspot.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Slave to Dvara<br>Secret Admin..<br>I slept with Apep to get this title</span><br>  Posts: 1847<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(10/15/02 9:46:22 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1564.topic&index=8>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> <BR><img src=http://sarshouse.homestead.com/files/images/sar.gif width=52 height=126></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_lightbulb.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: Gah ..</span><hr size=1> Check your email, Bjond, please.<br>

I already told you why I locked the thread.  It had nothing to do with your weak-ass argument, it had to do with the fact that you were harassing Robin.<br>
<br>
Robin posted about something lousy that happened to his friend.  People responded, some said it might have been an accident.  Robin appended his original comment to read that <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> if</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> it was done intentionally it was mean.<br>
<br>
All of this transpired before you even joined the discussion.  Then you come in there, start callin Robin a whiner, start accusing him of accusing everyone else of a conspiracy of meanness, etc.  None of that has anything to do with the discussion, and everything to do with personal attacks.  Robin didn't even respond to you.  Every time someone <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> else</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> responded to Robin symphathetically, you called him names etc. <br>
<br>
The only comments you made that were related to the topic were that his friend should've known better, and that by knowing better he could've avoided the situation, and that because he didn't know better it's his fault.  That's a separate argument (a shitty one at that), but has nothing to do with why I locked the thread.<br>

I've been in far more heated debates than your argument that practical jokes that involve other player's deaths are funny.  I told you why I locked it.<br>

<br>
My reaction when people slip &amp; fall isn't to laugh, regardless of whether they were looking where they were going or not.  I might laugh if they had a peanut stuck in their hair or something, but personal injury isn't something I find amusing.  You, however, seem to find it hilarious when someone suffers as a result of something they should've been more aware of.  If a skateboarder cracked his skull open on the sidewalk after trying to skate down a railing, by your logic that'd be high comedy, because he should've known it was coming.  I'd be in agreement that he should've known better, but don't think it's at all funny, and certainly wouldn't set up such a situation for my own amusement.<br>

If you think you can post an opinion here and not receive ANY negative feedback, you're living in a unique and very underpopulated little fantasy world.<br>
<br>
Posting against someone when he didn't even bother to check with the person to see if it was deliberate or not counts as whining in my book.  The evidence is all there in that thread.  Basic EQ -- use a map, /con everything in a new zone.  Most folk past level 10 know that.  Hell, even the EQ documention states: /con everything.  He forgoes that, doesn't ask the original source of directions anything, completely omits any hint that the lost guy did anything even remotely dumb, acuses someone of being deliberately and specifically mean, and expects support?  That, my friend, is a whine.<br>
<br>
I intended to convince people it was just another patented Robin whine, like all the rest.  It's not a whine because it comes from Robin, it's a whine because he did some silly bit of foolishness in EQ, then comes here and complains about it being someone else's fault, and expects sympathy.  This is a typical trend, which is what makes it annoying.  When someone hits the boards with similar posts such that roughly 95% of them fit the same description (my groupmates suck, random guild01 is camping the phat lewt and won't let me in, idiots keep training me at the zoneline, etc, etc), well, that's a whiner.<br>
<br>
Was it a nice thing to say?  Hell no, but then this isn't the &quot;all posts must be flattering&quot; forum.  Was I harrassing Robin?  Yes and no -- I was ridiculing him for whining.  Was this a personal attack?  Well, if you think Robin is a whiner, then yes, it was personal to extent that part of his personality was ridiculed.  Aww, poor thing.<br>
<br>
Syll, your skateboard story is incomplete.  Supposing that the 'border did that, naturally I'd think he was incredibly dumb, and yup, I'd laugh at him.  'Course if it became obvious he was seriously injured, I'd probably also be the only one that did anything constructive.  I've been around a ton of accidents and my experience with the serious ones (even my own) is always the same.  First, the size of the tears or volume of the scream has less than nothing to do with the seriousness of the injury.  Second, no one does a damn thing until I tell them to do it.  I shudder to think what would happen if I ever became unconcious due to an injury.<br>
<br>
Oh, and naturally when his buddy the lawyer tries to drum up a suit against the owner of the railing, that's when I laugh at and ridicule the whining idiot -- just like I did here.<br>
<br>
Your post here just confirms things Syll.  You locked it because you disagreed.  You stated they were not heated (they weren't) and thus locked it because you disagree that Robin's post was just another whine in a long history of whines and didn't feel up to defending your point of view.  If you agreed, you'd have let it run.  Post here that he's a whiner and you were protecting him on general principles and I might believe you locked it because it was too personal.  Until then, you're just another mod that got owned by his own temper when the discussion didn't fit your prejudices. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/udomenicdominion.showPublicProfile?language=EN>DomenicDominion</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 17<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(10/16/02 1:29:51 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1564.topic&index=13>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_lightbulb.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: AH</span><hr size=1> *blinks*<br>
<br>
Its clear that Bjond doesnt like Robin, but that was a long way from &quot;abuse.&quot; If that is all it takes to lock down a thread, then there are a number of other threads that should also be locked down. <br>
<br>
Robin has played the &quot;devil's advocate&quot; in the past by his own admission. He has also overracted in the past, as I think he did here.<br>
<br>
Long and short: he should be able to take as he dishes out, and if he cant, he shouldnt post here. This isnt a &quot;get well&quot; or &quot;feel good&quot; forum. It can be confrontational, at times even brutal... a lot more brutal than Bjond's posts.<br>
<br>
Being a moderator is a rugged job, and Syll usually does a good job, but imho that was pretty inconsistent.<br>

You're My Obsession... o/`</span><hr size=1> Bjond, who's whining here?  If you don't like what I have to say, the solution is simple.  Don't read it.  You can't seem to stop yourself--and you can't seem to stop yourself from saying the same thing you've said over and over.  You whine about how I'm supposedly a &quot;whiner.&quot;<br>
<br>
It doesn't matter what I say.  According to you, I'd be &quot;whining&quot;.  This was apparent to me a long, long time ago and I think this latest outburst of yours has made it apparent to everyone else as well.<br>
<br>
In psychoanalysis, there's a concept called &quot;projection&quot;.  That's when the ego projects its own desires outwards onto an object it cathects onto, usually in the form of projecting one's own failings and anxieties onto others.  You're projecting your own failing, that you're a whiner, onto me.<br>
<br>
Why?  Because you're obsessed with me for reasons that remain an utter mystery to me.  Every time I post, you reply, typically three or more times (sometimes in a row).  In fact, you've written volumes on me when I've said absolutely nothing about nor to you.  You're obsessed.<br>
<br>
Haven't you realized that in over a year of attempting to bait me, I've never replied to you?  Except for this post, not once have I said anything to nor about you, here nor elsewhere.  Have you noticed that I utterly ignore you?  I don't care one iota what you think.<br>
<br>
Perhaps that's what you're after; perhaps you need me to reply to you to validate your existence.  This would be consistent with your obvious obsession in what I have to say.<br>
<br>
This is the first thing I've said to you, and I guarantee this is also the last. <p>"Adjusting to an oppressive system cannot be the answer; in the last analysis, it is not we who need the therapy."<BR>

That's not the case, but you can keep thinking that.<br>
<br>
I read your first few replies, responded to you about the topic at hand, and posted in the moderator's forum to see if I was imagining that you were lobbing personal attacks at Robin.  You then followed up with yet another reply about Robin being a whiner etc at which point I locked the thread.<br>
<br>
If Robin posts &quot;Hey, someone tricked my friend into going into Kael and he died there, then I died there, that joker sucks&quot;, you're more than welcome to reply &quot;No he doesn't, malice is hilarious!!!  OMFG I CAN'T STOP LAUGHING!!!  DIED!!!   IN KAEL!!!!  WHEN MAPS ARE AVAILABLE!!!!  OMG I SPIT SODA ON MY SCREEN!!!! A HA HA HA HA HA HA&quot;<br>
<br>
But when you start continually calling Robin a whiner, even when he's no longer even replying to that thread, and when you keep bringing up a point he already admitted he was incorrect about, it raises my little &quot;personal attack&quot; warning flags.<br>
<br>
In the meantime, I'll just agree to disagree with ya that causing suffering in others is funny because they should've known better.  You can derive your amusement by training people fighting near zonelines, and giving people bad directions, and doing trade-window scams, the rest of us will derive ours by playing pranks that don't hurt the other party (shrinking NPCs down to pixie-size, using minor illusion &amp; levitate to make floating magic swords, etc)<br>

Cool.  Next time someone asks me for directions to the mall, I'll give them directions straight through the more dangerous part of town.  I mean, it's their dumbass fault for not taking a look at their surroundings as they drive, or downloading the directions from expedia.com first.

W T F are you talking about?  He states crystal clear in his post that he thought someone took advantage of his friend's ignorance (if they did it intentionally).  Robin only died because he tried to help his friend.  He's not claiming any conspiracy, that's you painting the portrait so you can help justify your calling him a whiner.<br>

One clarification on the original post - it isn't that hard to get yourself caught by see invisible giants - especially for a first timer through Kael. If you take a wrong turn right before icehouse and veer a little right, you will run into at least 1 see invis giant.<br>
<br>
As far as locking the thread - shouldn't have happened. Sorry Syll, you are a good mod, but that stuff was mild compared to other stuff I have seen on other boards and even this one. I thought this forum was for that kind of stuff and only RL personal attacks with RL information was dissallowed. If personal attacks are grounds for locking, most threads should be - half the ones here are about &quot;So and so trained/KSed/Griefed/Cheated me&quot;. That's why the &quot;enter at your own risk&quot; banner is up on this forum from the main board page - if you post here, expect opinions. <p><div align=center>

It's not personal, it's just what happened (or your view of it anyways).<br>
<br>
Making cracks about people's personality flaws (as you see them), especially when done repeatedly can qualify.  It was further compounded by Bjond's skewing of the facts to make Robin look worse (Robin put up a post about his <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> friend</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> asking for directions and being misled, Bjond replies and accuses Robin of being a whiny idiot who needs to get a map, accuses the other person of being a whiner by association with Robin and that their lame personality is justification for any abyuse they get, etc).  <br>
<br>
Ultimately, it's all a judgement call, and one I stand by.  It was based on not only the things Bjond was saying, but how Robin was reacting.  Bjond was making insults at Robin regardless of who was replying, Robin didn't respond to any of Bjond's insults (just left the discussion), and still Bjond continued taking shots at him.  That's when I locked it.<br>
<br>
It wasn't a Kzan/Fuvi situation where they were both at eachother's throats, and it wasn't a situation where Bjond was only trouncing Robin on the topic at hand (ie: he'd stuck to the issue of downloading travel maps and what constitutes a good practical joke -vs- driving off down his little whiner / chip on the shoulder / moron tangent).<br>
