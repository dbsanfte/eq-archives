Dalninil say in her chambers, hands dripping with blood from the last vict.... sacrifice to her lord Innoruuk. It would seem that the traitor Shintou was dead. The was no pleasure to be taken from this, he was a stark reminder of her failure to guide those of the House in the purity of hate. She smiled for one malice not showing on her face as she allowed a small amount of time to think back.<br><br>.. Upper Guk, she'd gotten a missive that some of the house were hunting these grounds, her armor a mix of patchwork and cloth she had attended to the wounds left by the spiders, they had spent along time hunting these ruins, the crocs then one spider room then another, then they were actually hunting the large spider, the squire, the scyre. All of the ruins had eventually bowed it's kneel to the might of House Sel'Quar. That was a good time a time of death, Shintou had shown his hatred true in those times.<br><br>.. Where had he gone wrong, during the skirmish with the Circle of Sisters , that was the breaking of him, his he had tried to lure the druid Ally away with love, and had tainted himself with it. It was down hill from there they had hunted many time but each time he had lost his hate, his world slowly dissolving, until he was considered a risk to the house and sent to his death. She had resurrected him that day, then preached hate, and had nearly killed him again. He failed her that day. Unable to purify himself, she had asked for the head of the fool that had told him to temper his hate with love, he couldn't do it. His failure slowly drove him insane and he was lost to that world for a time. <br><br>They had spoken not to long before his death, but his spirit was long since broken, his personal chaos all that was left of him.<br><br>She took the small painting of him from her dressed, and walked to the fireplace. Holding her hand above the flame she consigned him to the dead, this time she would not bring him back. She released the picture into the flame, wincing as it is enveloped. A single tear rolls down her left cheek. Then it is over. The picture is gone, and so is he.<br><br>The malice returns to her face, and the smiles. A high elf will be her next victim, Innoruuk will be please with his maiden. His terror is evident as she steps into the room, looking at the broken figure on the rack she smiles &quot; Accept the blessings of Innoruuk fool &quot; and the blood rituals begin again. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/umistressoftherose.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Mistress of the Rose</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>The Black Rose</span><br>  Posts: 67<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(1/29/02 3:13:17 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm10.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=140.topic&index=4>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Tis a wonder</span><hr size=1> So you have been looking for the one who was telling Shintou the true path to power?

What do you hate?  Why do you hate?  Blind hatred is useless.  Focused hatred is much more powerful.  If you love something than whatever goes about trying to take away what you love you will hate with a focused hate so bright that you will outshine Innoruuk's own hate.  What you choose to love is your own decision ... I for one have no need of hate to finish off my opponents.
