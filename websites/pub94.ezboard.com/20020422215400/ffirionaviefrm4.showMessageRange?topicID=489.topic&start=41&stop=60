That was me, and every time I see someone corrupting this server or exploiting Legends I will call them out again. Unlike some, I actually care about this server.<br>
<br>
Restoria said: &quot;Who was it that TOOK OVER a plane from a smaller guild who was attempting it under the guise of helping them? (Note: AFTER we helped them back onto their feet, no less.)&quot;<br>
<br>
Ask Edea about that. We did not take over. We CR'd their entire group of people when we came in, and we ASKED if we could come in first. We stated that we wanted the broken golem and nothing else, would clear to it, finish it, they could have all the loot from mobs we killed prior to that, then we would leave. They instead evac'd out after we CR'd them, opting not to take the free loot, but even tho the zone was then empty we did exactly as we said, and had been granted permission to do, cleared to the golem, killed it, and left. The zone was mostly populated at that time. Why they evac'd instead of taking the free loot I do not know, but we were in and out in like 30 mins, just as we said we'd be, and even tho they were gone, our word meant enough to us that we kept it.<br>
<br>
Restoria said: &quot;I'm still amazed that THEY didnt flame you for that. They had every right to, and chose not to.&quot;<br>
<br>
Flame us for what? Entering after granted permission? CR'ing their entire remaining group? Oiffering them free loot on the way to the golem? Or keeping our word and leaving after the golem was dead, even when no one was left in the zone? Odd things to flame someone for, but whatever toots your horn. Obviously, seeing as you weren't there, you really don't have a clue.<br>

There's nothing I can do about it; it's an exploit, and an easy one to get by the GMs if you have half a brain -- and anytime you have such an easy-to-perform exploit, those weak in honor or lacking self-esteem who wish to prop themselves up in that area will use the exploit.<br>
<br>
However, when I see it happen, absolutely I will shun the exploiters like the plague and denigrate them vociferously and often, letting as many people know about their behavior as I possibly can. And for those who associate with these people knowingly, I will most assuredly treat you the same, because that shows you too care nothing about our server.<br>

Seems to me there was ALOT of miscommunication about what happened in fear then. Especially when tons of DA were none to pleased about how Reso went in there. And speaking of honor, how does reso justify the Lodi kill taken from DA.. and then of course giving them the loot (assuming you gave them all the loot).<br>
<br>
Opps! We KS a giant turtle. Sorry our bad. Honor isn't something you can choose to have when it suits you or your guild.<br>

<br>
Replies such as the one you have just given to me are usually done to be so vague as to make it seem as if you have something extremly deep and thoughtful behind your words, when in fact, you're saying nothing but trying to look smart doing it.  Your first responce speaks of the game as it could be played on any server and makes no special mention of FV or its ruleset which instantly disqualifies it from having anything resembling a point to anything I, or anyone else, had to say.  Your second is just mind-numbing fluff.  To put it plainly, you're trying to flame me and doing a horrible job.<br>
<br>
FV was created for RPers.  Period.  I am not an RP Nazi, but I am against people coming to FV with no intention of playing a character. The great thing about how the server stands now is that basically everyone is friendly.  People seem to want to be here to enjoy the atmosphere of family and fun.  One of the things I love so much is that loot is not a concern.<br>
<br>
So let me make this clear from my standpoint.  I do not care about uber-loot or the distribution of it.  I do not care if I re-roll and meet up with a level 5 warrior in full ToV gear, so long as he is adding to the positive atmosphere by being a character.  I do however care about lame-ass, wanna-be power-gamers coming into FV because they can finally be king of the hill, if only because the real powergamers wouldn't waste their time coming here.  Who wants to be king of the anthill?<br>
<br>
Selling &quot;uber-loot&quot; will not be the cause of FVs decline.  It seems to me most of the people who are getting upset are those who already HAVE uber-gear.  The cry &quot;They didn't earn it&quot; looks like &quot;It's not fair because now everyone will be as uber as me and I had to 'work' really hard for mine&quot; because of the attitude behind all the posts.  The respect for a character on FV does not, in my opinion, seem to be based on ones equipment AT ALL!!  Who watches Mr Uber-guild-member_02 run by in the Nexus and go &quot;Wow, he's so cool!  He has PoH armor!!!  I want to just as cool as him!&quot;  Such thinking is for blue servers.<br>
<br>
What would be bad is a flood of d00ds coming over for no reason other than so they can get buy the great no-drop loot here.  Coming to FV to abuse the unique rules = bad.<br>
<br>
But I don't see that happening, as someone who has that much of a desire for loot will be playing on a server that CARES about loot... not FV.  It's not too hard to pop on a blue server, play 24 hours a day, and find your way into an uber-guild.  No need to come here and buy it.  As I said, king of the anthill.  So what I see as being both plausable and bad is the people who just can't hack it on blues coming over here.<br>
<br>
You want to try talking down to me, go ahead.  But I, along with everyone else with half the brain required to see through your third-grade attempts at looking smart, would appreciate it if you accually make a point and some attempt to stand behind it.  That goes for anyone else who can't do anything but fling BS back and forth.  You're just making yourself look equally foolish as the side you're crying about. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ualyissa.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Alyissa</A> at: 4/6/02 9:59:50 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ukurley.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Kurley</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 27<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(4/7/02 12:02:07 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=489.topic&index=54>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: well, there goes the neighborhood</span><hr size=1> ROFL,<br>

If I am coming across as a poor flamer, well thats probably because I dont usually flame folks. If I flamed you, well I guess that makes you special. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

We had a druidess in zone, she saw him pop on tracking, she left to go to GD to pick up the first of the groups. While she was gone getting others, DA spotted Lodi and, seeing no one else in zone, assumed it was theirs. (An understandable mistake, obviously.)<br>
<br>
So, our people ported in, plenty enough to kill Lodi. Did DA have enough to kill him then? I don't know, possibly, possibly not, that is one of those unanswerable questions. Note that I was not there for this one, I heard on guild chat, and it seemed to me that in the intertests of future good will we should just let them have it, even tho we had spotted it first and arrived with the force to kill him possibly first as well. But the people there were like 'We saw him first, we got the force here to kill him first, why should we let him go, we all just left our camps, blah blah'. However, after some convincing on my part and on the part of others, and because the mistake was certainly an understandable one, we gave them the loot.<br>
<br>
And how exactly, then, was this a dishonorable act? We saw him first, we quite possibly had the force to kill him there first, and even though we did kill him, we gave them the loot, no prob. Seems like we acted extraordinarily fairly here, all things considered. But I guess everyone has their own point of view.<br>

I came to FV because I was sick of all the shouting, babbling, oneup-manship, and other blabber on the other servers.  PvP servers are filled with people who get off on feeling bigger because they're twink is greater than your twink.  Blue servers are too populated and full of beggers, shouters, trainers, etc.<br>
<br>
FV is nice and peaceful.  The main thing that convinced me to join here was no zone-wide shouts and no auctions in non city zones.  That alone makes this server far superior to any other server.  In addition, I figured people that liked to role-play were, on the average, more friendly and intelligent then the average monkey.. I mean, &quot;d00d players&quot; on the other servers.<br>
<br>
I also want to play the high end game, because I find that that's the enjoyable part of the game.  If I was truly a dark elf wizard, then I wouldn't have fun chatting with people or going to weddings or consipring on how to take out Another_Useless_Highelf_00.  I'd want to blow stuff up.  Like dragons and giants and big scary monsters.  So, that's what I do.  <br>
<br>
I joined Fire and Fury because we take out big stuff, and I like doing that.  <br>
<br>
(I was intending to tie this to your post somehow..)<br>
<br>
What I also like here is that I don't see every level 5 player running around in level 50+ armor.  In my opinion that trivializes the game.  It annoyed me on Tallon Zek when every single player you ran in to had gear that dropped in level 50+ zones and had an MR of 200+ and killed you in 2 seconds.  It became pointless to do anything when you'd always just run into a twink that could take you down easily.  On (established) blue servers, the market is so saturated that your standard level 1 bard is running around in full lambent or singing steel, your standard level 1 warrior has a lammy and a wurmslayer, etc etc.  I think that trivializes the game.  It doesn't kill my enjoyment of it, but it lessens the enjoyment for me some.<br>
<br>
I'm not speaking for the others in Fire and Fury who are debating the topic of loot and such, but I think I can understand where they're coming from.  <br>
<br>
Anyway I didn't come here to be king of anything, let alone an anthill.  I don't dislike the idea of distribution of planar gear becuase I won't look as good in comparison to others.  I don't like the idea of distribution of planar gear to those who can't go to planes because it would make this server about the same as the other servers I've been on.  The arguments that others in Fire and Fury are making is that people who buy planar gear aren't earning their equipment.  If everyone can go shell out a few thousand plat (which is trivial to get) to buy planar armor, there's no real point for the level 46 restriction to go there.  You just let your Local_Uber_Guild_00 go there and wait for them to flood the marketplace.<br>

If you want to think of it from a role-playing/in character perspective, then it does make sense for good items to bring with them a notion of status.  I.e:<br>
<br>
Galtron walks into the bar with a grim face and orders an ale.  <br>
A novice adventurer looks upon Galtron and whispers to his friend: &quot;By Tunare!  That is the great warrior Galtron.  And look at that breastplate he has donned.  It is rumored he had to kill the great Dragon Trakenon himself for such a prize!  And that sword.  Rumor has it that it was wielded by a horrid snakeman in the Temple of Ssraeshza, the legendary enslavers of the Iksar race.  This is a powerful and great man indeed, my friend&quot;<br>
<br>
(by the way I made up the name &quot;Galtron&quot; so I'm not referring to anyone, and I'm not trying to imply that Trakanon or Ssra mobs are &quot;uber&quot; or anything)<br>
<br>
You have to take that with a grain of salt, but you have to take all of Everquest with a grain of salt if you're trying to roleplay.  <br>
<br>
At any rate, if I was roleplaying in D&amp;D and I was a level 3 warrior in leather armor with a long sword, and then a warrior walked in with plate armor, some ornate shield, a fiery sword, etc I'd automatically give him a little respect and awe.  I'd look at my crappy long sword with dried orc blood on it and think: &quot;Someday I will be a champion of the realms like he is&quot;.   Or if I was a wizard and cast detect magic and a robed figure lit up like a Christmas tree -)<br>
