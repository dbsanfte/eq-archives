The ring is free, all you need is faction.  Faction takes 15 hours or more.  This is a lot of work.  The reward for the faction is the ring and subsequent rings.  This is why all you have to do is tell the Herald and he'll give you one.  Free.  <br>
<br>
Now people are selling them for 1500-5000pp.  And people are buying them.  Stupid.<br>

This happens with all items.  If there are a lot of people out there willing to pay 1.5k plus for a ring you get for free (once you have the faction), you will see a ton of folks in Droga working on the faction so that they can make the rings themselves.  Over time, when more rings start flooding the market, you will see competition among sellers and the price will go down.  In this example, people are willing to pay that much because hardly anyone wants to put the work in to build up the faction.  In the 15 plus hours Kyrial spent working on that faction, she could have farmed hill giants or other loot-rich mobs and have made some money in another way.  She chose to put time and effort into this quest to help her buddies and to get some outside reimbursement.  I don't see a problem with that.<br>
<br>
I don't see this any different from the premiums charged by tradeskill masters or general farmers.  That is the beauty of a free market.  If you feel the price is too high for what it is worth, you can put in the effort yourself or there will be others seeing profit to be made who will put in that effort and sell for lower.<br>

The ring is free and is able to get by a simple phrase because it is supposed to be no drop.  It is an oversight.  I can sit in Chardok and hail the guy over and over again and get 100+ rings if I so desired.<br>
<br>
You have to work faction for just about any quest.  I'm KOS to Thurgadin.  I work my faction up in Thurgadin.  Does that mean it was okay for me to sell the phrase item for 3pp to a vendor?  I mean, by god, I worked up my Thurg faction, that is my reward.<br>

<br>
Yes, it is a free market.  And yes, if she gets rich doing it, I'm sure others will farm faction too.  But the problem is that this only works on Firiona Vie.  It's the same market as selling planar gear.  Sure, you got some planar gear.  Sure, there is a market for it.  2 + 2 = 4, so now we sell planar gear.  Luckily, no one is going to go farm for gear.<br>
<br>
This can be said of a lot of different things that you can't sell on other servers that you can sell here.  The difference here is that one you do *A* amount of work, and then you have an unlimited supply to exploit.  If I camp (which is putting in time) a peice of planar gear, I can sell it once.  If I camp (again, putting in a finite time) chardok faction, I can sell it infinite times.  If you don't think that is an exploit of Firiona Vie's mechanics, then go ahead and sell them.<br>

And what Siman says... fi someone wants to pay me plat instead of putting the time into it....

I dont think charging 5k for a ring is right. (I'm aghast at the fact some folks would pay that much, it's nice but not THAT nice... )<br>

-I- petitioned Verant to change this quest. Much like you, I'm dismayed by the fact I could flood the entire market, thus dropping the 6 ac/65 hitpoint ring market to nothing, etc..hand 'em out like candy.. it's crazy, utterly crazy, I agree.<br>
<br>
If Verant changed ring #1 to no drop, and just let the others be droppable, that'd be just dandy for me.<br>
<br>
If Sneez and Vsoemthing (I cannot spell his name)  want to agree not to sell it, then I wont either. However I'm sure that'd result in just a black market going on =P<br>

Your post makes it that much clearer why a free market will work in this instance.  We are talking about an item that you can have an unlimited supply of once you have finished your initial investment.  There is very little marginal cost needed in acquiring this item--merely running an errand.<br>
<br>
In a free market, over time the cost of an item will tend to move towards the marginal cost of producing an item.  I am not saying that the economy for items on Firiona Vie is a truly free market.  Still, if folks are offering over 1k for this item, you are going to see more people put in that initial investment so they can start selling these.  Once you have as little as half a dozen sellers of these rings, the prices are going to fall pretty far pretty quickly.  <br>
<br>
Given that these can be farmed endlessly, the supply of these rings will go through the roof and prices will fall.  The only drawback I see about these being no drop is that there will be a glut of these items and it will make it harder for jewelers to compete with their ac/hp rings for instance. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=dalnin>Dalnin</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 16<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(8/15/02 1:56:38 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1210.topic&index=9>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: well</span><hr size=1> who'd pay  5k for that ring the one you turn in gobo skins for ?<br>

Nothing being no drop is the back bone of this server. If you start yelling to get even one thing outside of epics labled no drop again, soon another will be, then another. <br>
<br>
Then were back to another blue server.<br>
<br>
It takes alot of faction work to get the ring, it isnt something you can just walk up and do.<br>
<br>
its no different than mid level druids farming Stormfeather and selling the map for 20k to high levels because of TLC.<br>
<br>
Nothing no drop and TLC are all we have left of the original server rules. Don't start yelling so hard before you think about what that means.<br>
<br>
How about ST, if you don't have a key to ST, and are using primal, dont you think people could scream and yell about how thats exploiting the integrity of no drop? You were meant to get those weapons only if you went there, yet you have one.<br>

Each peice of primal is camped and won.  True, it is much easier to get on this server since it isn't no-drop, but each peice has to be earned (by someone).<br>

I still think the closest comparison is still to the 8th Shawl exploit people got rich off of.  All you had to do was say a phrase and walk to a vendor.  It was fixed.  All you have to do is say a phrase to the chardok person, and then sell it to a player.  It should be fixed.  And making the first ring no-drop does just that.<br>

If anyone wants one, I will sell them to you for 500 pp, (400 pp per person if you go to Chardok with me with 3 or more buyers in the group).<br>
