Power hummed from the four pylons of stone that surrounded it, slight tremors caused the leaves that had settled on its surface to dance wildly about, after a moment there was a bright flare of light and four figures appeared on the top. <br>
<br>
The forest was its usual dark and dangerous self, yet nothing appeared to challenge their progress, something which left Valkiri disappointed. She was not looking forward to entering the city of the Teir Dal naked, she would not double her shame by attempting to enter the town invisible. The Shadow Knight was surprised to find her companions were of the same opinion.<br>
<br>
As the party approached the gate one of the Dragoons turned to them with a sneer of disdain which quickly turned into open mouthed lust. Here before him stood three females, one obviously a Teir Dal of some authority and power and two Human body servants. A fourth figure, a male Teir Dal stood behind the females.<br>
<br>
“Who wishes to enter the city of Neriak?” he said in his most professional of manners. Thald, the younger guardsman on his right turned at his announcement and gawped at the quartet that stood before the gates. <br>
<br>
“You don’t need our names soldier, open the gate, and be quick about it.” Hissed Dahliana imperiously. As much as she enjoyed the attention, it galled her to be ogled like a dancer at the Fancy by lesser class Teir Dal.<br>
<br>
“If you won’t give us your names, you will have to pay the toll to enter the town, that’s the law.” The younger guard said with a giggle. He found the tall human with the white hair quite interesting, despite the fact that her left hand was swathed in dirty bandages she carried herself with a certain arrogance that appealed to him.<br>
<br>
Philia was terrified, she had heard nothing but tales of horror concerning the manner in which the Teir Dal treated those weaker than themselves. Entering the city in this manner would do nothing but place her in a dangerous position. The manner of their entry would be no secret, and she would forever be the naked necromancer who had to sell her body at the gate to enter the city.<br>
<br>
“I will pay your toll.” Valkiri said with a confident smile walking up to the younger of the two guards. She kissed him hungrily, the tongue of the guard was cooler than hers and their teeth momentarily clicked together as the two kissed.<br>
<br>
Thald was in heaven. His lips burned like fire when they touched the humans, the tongue was like a flame, licking his mouth, whoever this human was she was an expert at pleasure. He broke the feverish embrace with a gasp. His blood thundered in his ears like waves on the beach. He felt dizzy with passion. This was the best part about being a guard at the gate, toll duty. Some foolish females never realized that they would have to pay toll for each gate in the city if they wished to pass.<br>
<br>
He turned to smile excitedly at the dragoon. As he did so he felt some saliva from the kiss run down his chin. He reached up absently to wipe it away. It was blood. ‘The bitch must have bitten me.’ He thought wiping at his mouth more carefully. The female stood there staring at him expectantly. She seemed eager to follow him into the guard tower to finish paying her “toll.”<br>
<br>
“Requesting permission to question the new arrival about her business in Neriak!” Thald barked to the dragoon. He had to swallow forcefully twice in order to get the sentence out, and his salute was as shaky as a fresh recruits. His tongue felt like it was too large for his mouth, and he slurred his words as if drunk.<br>
<br>
“Granted!” The dragoon barked, he had decided to choose the other human female, she appeared suitably impressed by his power, he liked the way she tried to hide her fear by cracking her knuckles. He hoped Thald would be quick so he could take his turn.<br>
<br>
Diverting his attention from the young human he turned to see Thald still standing before the gate. He seemed to be coughing or trying to clear his throat. He watched in surprise as the younger guard doubled over suddenly with a coughing fit, blood gushed between the soldier’s splayed fingers. <br>
<br>
“Help me…” Thald gasped, his last cough had been full of blood and his hand now held three teeth. He could not properly close his mouth, as his tongue had swelled to twice its size and it lolled out covered with a film of greenish pus. The damn female was still clutching eagerly at him, trying to drag him bodily into the guard house where she could have her way with him.<br>
<br>
The dragoon looked once more at the human female, this time concentrating on the face, with growing fear he began to put the pieces together. There was only one Human female who frequented Neriak whose kiss could kill. <br>
<br>
“This one does not seem to be strong enough to collect the toll…” Valkiri said with a smirk. She sauntered towards the dragoon.<br>
<br>
For a moment, he thought it would be worth it, but as Thald collapsed choking onto the ground the dragoon came to his senses. “Come no closer, Valkiri Blackhand.” He said desperately. <br>
<br>
“Surely a Dragoon of Neriak would be man enough for me.” Her voice was like silk, “Why don’t you collect the toll?” <br>
<br>
With a trembling hand, the dragoon reached into his belt pouch. He removed four passes and carefully dropped them into the Shadow Knight’s hand. “I think that the toll has been paid.” He said, looking over at Thald’s body, already maggots could be seen dancing on his tongue, a glistening feast.<br>
<br>
As the group turned to go, he recovered some of his courage. “Be sure to show those passes to the guards, I can’t have more guardsmen take ill.”<br>
<br>
Philia looked at the rapidly decomposing corpse of the guard. She resisted the temptation to harvest a few chips as she walked past. The young necromancer knew now that she would have nothing to fear concerning her entrance to Neriak or her reputation.<br>
