I don’t claim to have the best knowledge of the class, but I think I know a bit of it and I’ve often had reaction saying “Wow, man, you rock at dealing with your class” such as when I broke a train in KC while the 3 groups being here (including mine and an 54+ enchanter of another group) zoned out and told me “Hey, you’re ok ?” and answer was “Hey guys, why did you all left ? Everything is under control here, come back and kick dem all !”.<br>
This is not something I want to be proud of (well, still a little bit) as I’m not well placed to judge myself, but all these reactions from different people let me foresee that I still have a clue about our capacities.<br>
Being only 50th, and not part of a raiding guild, I won’t speak about high end raids but general things for the young ones.<br>
<br>
First thing is : why do you want to play a shaman ? Even more, what is the style of playing that you want to have ? I personnaly made a shaman for I wanted to be able to solo big things and be usefull to groups. This was reducing my choice of class range. Then I wanted to be able to get hit and still be in the face of mobs (sorry, I’m not the kind of root cooking shaman, though it is a really valid strategy). This was even more reducing the choice. Finally, I wanted to have several way of killing. This drove me to 2 classes : shaman and necro. While necro can be in the face of mobs and have more way of killing than shaman), I deleted my previous necro to make a shaman as one thing I really like is going into newbie zone and buff young ones like Hell and see their joy, this is something necro can’t do hehe. Of course, one thing that you have to keep in mind is that you MUST (yes, I said MUST) play a toon you like. I’ve done incredible things with just a SK 40 and me 47 and couldn’t do that same thing later with a full group ! Why ? Simply because the guy and I (who never met before) really enjoyed our classes and thus could reach our limits without going beyond them. Well, this last statement is obvious, but I still wanted to highlight it.<br>
<br>
The 2 second things are :<br>
-        don’t get discourage. The shaman class has some really hard levels to go through : before 24, from 29 to 34 (these where the worst) and 44-49 (well, I made them in 2 months, but I hardly logged during this time, so I’m maybe a bit biased here). Yes, there will be a lot of times when you will say “Sh.t, this bores me, I’m gonna reroll”. Don’t do that, keep with it, the rewards awaits you and I can tell you that being 50, I often feel like god amongst mobs.<br>
-        Know the other classes possibilities. This might seem obvious, but I still find some people saying “Hey, I didn’t know XXX class could do YYY !”. If you know the other possibilities, you will be better at enhancing their possibilities and fill in the blanks of your group. This will also sometime help you to build some strategy to do something you thought impossible as all class have some “useless” spells which combined can make unwaited results. So don’t be afraid to spend some time on classes sites to learn about them. I’ve found that the places where I could learn the most about some classes (but spell descriptions) are on the specialised forum.<br>
<br>
Now comes the life a shaman. I won’t make a guide for what to hunt, where and when, using any search engine on internet will bring you tons of stuff, though I want to bring a special note about the crucible which is a great source of information. You will find a lot of informations on castersrealm too, but be aware that some of them (especially some spell descriptions) are completely false.<br>
<br>
Now, what is a shaman ? Well, a shaman is a wonderfull toolbox for a party. We are one of those classes that are not specialised in anything (well, we do slow better than anyone, but chanters do that almost as good as us, and later, BST can land their slow more easily than us, but this is information I have from high level friends, well, very very high level friends). These classes (such as shaman or necro) can do almost anything, though not as good as specialized one. The advantage is that in any kind of group, we are usefull, filling in the gap of the party.<br>
<br>
One of our main utility in a group is that we enhance the fighting capacities of others. From this standpoint, the shaman is a twin of the enchanter. Having one in your group is a booster, but while enchanter boost capacities of casters (hey, they can do lotsa things beside that mind you), shaman boost the capacities of fighters.<br>
<br>
Here is a quick review of our spell lines :<br>
-        Stats enhancement. While I’m not sure these are that usefull, they still are. Str increases the attack value of someone, thus allowing him to hit more often and reaching is max damage more often. Dex increases the proc rate of weapon, skill increase and, some say, reduce fizzles on spells though I’ve never remark that. Agi slightly increases AC. STA means more hp and CHA means that when you will go sell your stuff, you will bring more money out of it that the average player (this is not true for me as, being an ogre, I started with a very low CHA). HP, AC and resists buffs : do I really need to explain more about them ?<br>
-        Regeneration and cannibalize. The first one will increase your hp regeneration rate, the second eats your life to give you mana. See the goal of both working together ?<br>
-        Debuffs. Slow will reduce the attack speed of mobs, thus reducing the damage your party will receive. This is, to my mind, the most debilitating effect one can put on a mob in EQ. Incapacitate line will reduce the fighting stats of your enemy (AC and STR mainly), allowing you to it them more easily and reducing (a little, but every little bit helps) the average damage you receive on hits. Finally, here comes the malo/insidious lines. These will reduce the resists of your enemies, and, while not really usefull at low level, later your party members will love you for them as these will allow them to be more efficient mana wise (less resist means less mana to achieve the same goal).<br>
-        Haste spells. These will allow you and your partu members to hit faster. While not as good here as an enchanteur, the shaman is still cool for that when no chantie is here.<br>
-        DoTs. We have 2 lines of DoTs : poison (act fast but will draw you a lot of aggro) and disease (slow acting, but safer. Mainly used as a solo tool as it is really slow acting and generally won’t have reach its full effect when the mob will fall).<br>
-        Utility spells. Here are what I call the travel spells (gate, bind, invisibility, levitate…), the survival tools (summon food and drink, summon a bag) and the vision spells (allow the blind race to see in dark). In this last line, my favourite one is a spell that allow you to see by the eyes of someone else (sorry, I forgot the name). It is very usefull to know what your puller brings you (as when the mob arrives, a good shaman will generally have already debuffed him and, if possible, rooted adds).<br>
-        Healing spells. While they are far from the healing capacities of a cleric, combined with slow and incapacitate line, a shaman is generally a sufficient source of heal for his team. I’ve already be main healer for secondary groups on raid (while this seems not furious, let me tell you that a PoFear brake in is nothing to laugh about) and often be primary buffer/debuffer/healer/crowd controller on groups (in these cases, let me tell you that you hardly have time to swing your weapon and you have to know your spellbook like your pocket as you often have to change your memorised spells during the action).<br>
-        Pet. When you will receive your first Dogdog life at level 34, your whole life will change. But you will have a taste of it if you hunt during your low 30’s in South Karana and charm elephants. I won’t explain why and let you the pleasure to discover it. I will only stress a point about them : do you remember when this bad mob was beating on you while you tried to gate not to die ?  Well, simply send pet, back off, gate. Voila. One advice : always keep crappy weapon to give 2 at a time to your pet, it will improve his damage output allowing him to dual wiled.<br>
-        Blind spells will act, under special circumstances, as a fear spell (provided you do not stay near the mob). This might also give you extra time to cast a gate. This spell saved my life countless times.<br>
-        Alchemy. While not being a spell line, this trading skill we receive during our mid 20’s allow us to use some effects normally not available to us (such as damage shields). But I won’t speak about it as it is really expensive (and I mean EXPENSIVE) to improve and a lot of shaman prefer have a better gear to level and improve this skill later in life.<br>
<br>
In a group :<br>
Why did people think I’m a good shaman (this word is not from me) is due to only 2 things :<br>
-        First of all, I always try to have the mob debuffed (at least slowed) before it reaches our camp, this saves the healer a lot of mana. Eventually when we have some adds, have them rooted out of the fighting place, thus taking enemies one at a time.<br>
-        Don’t be afraid to get hit. I can’t stress this enough. Why could I brake this train in KC (thanks God there were no casters in it) ? Simply because I got all mobs on me, root one, back off, root the second, back of… Then I slowed them all. Of course my mana pool was badly hurt after that, but hey, even if I was near the zoning, I didn’t want to flee without trying.<br>
It is your role to educate people about what you can do (ok, they should have search for it, but hey, not everyone has the wisdom of a shaman hehe). Be aware of what happens. Understand how your group functions. When you have understand it, 2 things are to be done. First, try to find with them out how you can improve your classes combination (here comes the importance of knowing the other’s possibilities). When this is adjusted, your group will be more efficient. Now you will have to improve it again, filling in roles that are not covered in your group. In a group, a shaman has no time to spare. When you will not debuff a mob, you will refresh a buff, heal someone, off tank a mob or swap spells. I can tell you the life of a shaman in a group is not soft <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->     <br>
<br>
For the solo shaman <br>
-        Root cooking : basically root the mob and keep him dotted until it dies. When you will have a good rhythm, you will find yourself slowly cooking up to 3 or 4 mobs at a time. Though this last method is dangerous as if you run OOM (rare) or several roots brake at the same time (more often), you will find yourself in bog troubles. One variant of this is blind cooking. Instead of rooting the mob, keep him blind. This method can be dangerous has the mob can aggro some friends. I use it when I find a mob is too resistant to root spells and I am in a wide place where no add should come.<br>
-        Tanking. Yes, straight tanking ! Pull a mob with slow, incapacitate him. Possibly send a DoT in if you have too much mana compared to your HP at the end of the fight. Then tank the mob IN TEH FACE with Dogdog by your side if you have him.<br>
-        Pet kitting. This method can be tricky and I’m not sure it still works well with the last patch changes. Basically send all you can to draw a mad aggro from the mob, send pet on him and run (in external view). If well done, the mob will be crazy at you and will chase you while Dogdog kills him.<br>
-        I’m sure I forget some as our toolbox is so wide, we can do almost anything.<br>
<br>
I hope this little guide will be usefull to my young fellow and/or explain a little more about the shaman capacities for the people who group with us. In no way I want to say this is the ultimate guide (and this ain't a guide, just advices) as some fellow shaman made some really great guides (this one is a great example : <!--EZCODE AUTOLINK START--><a href="http://forums.interealms.com/shaman/showthread.php?s=&threadid=8841">forums.interealms.com/sha...eadid=8841</a><!--EZCODE AUTOLINK END--> as it covers what I previously said but has more details. /bow Sneez). So feel free to add some things on your own or say me if I said BS <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->    <br>
Finally, I apologise for the mistakes (f english) I could have done. Shakespeare's langage is not my native tongue, thank you to correct me <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   <br>
Feel free to contact me in game if you need more advices, I will do my best to answer you.<br>

Oh, one last thing I forgot to say : if you plan to getting your epic, think about TLC on FV so start t gather the reuired drop as soon as you can.

<br>
I have just acquired my 34th season and am at a lost at what to do to progress.<br>
<br>
The new spells require a lot of mana. Cannibalize only allows me to transfer direct 50 health points for 50 mana points.  I find myself cannibalizing to get mana up ASAP and then have to deal with low-health aggro.  In a group situation, other hybrid healers are using mana to heal me while I cannibalize... causing unnecessary demand on their manapool while meelee'ing.<br>
<br>
If I just solo, I can manage my manapool and cannibalize... but soloing is lonely and my pet can only provide so much company.<br>
<br>
Master Klatcrane, I take to heart your advise.  I would be forever in your debt if you can help me on this issue. :-) <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showUserPublicProfile?gid=blakkon>blakkon</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 678<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(5/6/03 10:33 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm45.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=99.topic&index=2>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Disciple of the Tribunal down on her luck</span><hr size=1> Well I am no master Klatcrane <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

I am however an Oracle having these 60 winters traveled the lands as a shaman.<br>
<br>
Take heart young shaman, you are past the dark days all shaman must transcend and will in every passing circle of speels gain in power.<br>
<br>
If you find that your mana is not sufficient even with cannibilize, that you get too low on health to keep the spirits flowing... there are things you can do to help this.<br>
<br>
You are at the age where your first warhorse will do you proud, if you can afford even the simplest of bridles, you can capture a horse which will make a difference in your life that can't really be described.<br>
<br>
 (standing med and spell changes and no sit agro -- you can also canni dance without the dance, once you get lvl 44 and stoicism you won't need to sit again) <br>
<br>
Also too improve the value of your cannibilization, always have regeneration on.  Further, many who have walked the spirit path ahead of you believe instead of Wisdom, that a shaman should seek stout armor and health improving gear.  The thought being that you want AC to protect your hitpoints, and a larger hp pool to make yoru mana regen flow easier<br>
<br>
 (That is get your AC and hitpoints up as high as you can, and don't worry if your wisdom is 150'ish -- you can make mana on demand, try for 800 ac by the time you hit 40, and 900 by 50 with as much hitpoints as you can get.  If your dressed like a druid you will be increasingly smacked as you gain levels.  If you post your gear and buffed stats I would be glad to advise you on changes)<br>

I'm sorry for not giving a full reply to your advice earlier.<br>
<br>
As soon as I got my Root spell, this became my standard practice:  I root, debuff, slow then DoT.  By the time root breaks, the mob is already so injured that I just straight meelee until the mob dies....very little healing on myself and regen keeps me going.<br>
<br>
Soloing: I find myself soloing alot only because I have only so much time to play.  I go LFG for about an hour or so and hit a mob or two to kill time... after that, I only have an hour left or two left to play so I solo with the LFG tag on.  This is where Murphy's Law kicks in: with 30-40 minutes left before I have to log, I get asked to join a group that has the potential of being really awesome. (Because of this, other than 2hb, all my meelee skills are maxed for my level.)<br>
<br>
Grouping: When in group, the first thing I do is debuff the mob and then slow.  If there is no ranger or druid to snare, I root before it turns (of course I always ask the group first off before any hunting because some people prefer not to have the mobs rooted.  Oh yeah.... and I heal... /grin<br>
<br>
Pulling: (I only pull when it is absolutely neccessary)  I have a certain pulling style called chain pulling, not your run-of-the-mill chain pull.  This is what I love to do... I enjoy it..and I'm good at it...and it shows.  Anyone who has grouped with me knows what I mean.  If I am healer and puller... I use Flash of Light. It is low mana and it gets the mob's attention real quick. By the time FoL wears off, I'm safe at camp, hasted and regenerated my meelee's and my group is ready to engage.  If I am only puller and we have a honest-to-goodness cleric or best-to-none druid, I pull with a debuff... when I get to camp, mob is still far enough that when it reaches camp, I've already thrown off a slow on him.  I pull back, let the tanks tank and I'm off to find another mob.  If I am pulling.. I am pulling, I do not waste time meeleeing.<br>
<br>
Mana:  The hardest thing for me to manage in group (when I am NOT pulling) is debuff, slow, dot and heal and buff the meelees with the limited mana pool I have so I cannibalize right and left as much as I can.  Oh yeah... I just learned the other night that I can cannibalize myself to low enough health that I the low-health aggro thing kicks in.. /grin<br>
<br>
So, this is my problem... I'm in my 34th season, my spells are mana hogs.... I do not want to sacrafice AC and HP gear to up my WIS = <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>low manapool</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->.  I almost always avoid getting addicted to KEI.. I'll take clarity or breeze from a thoughtful and considerate enchanter from my group.  Due to my limited play time, I just cannot commit hours and hours to farming plat for a mount.  Heck, I have a hard enough time getting enough plat together for my spells.<br>
<br>
Loot: IMO, my objective is not the loot.  My objective is the RP interaction that comes with grouping.  I pass on stuff unless I really need it for tradeskills or for crafted upgrade.<br>
<br>
Armour: I have the advantage of having a 50th season beastlord big sister who is at 186+ smithing so as long as I bring her the acrylia and windstones and other needed ingredients, she will make me some nice acrylia chain armour.  So far, I have tunic, legs, bracers, back.  Took me my 28th through 34th seasons to farm the components for these items though.<br>
<br>
I will make note of my stats tonight and post them for you, Lorec.  I'm still running around in hunting leather boots...and I replaced my banded boots because of the weight.<br>
<br>
I am still learning how to be good at being a shaman.  I still have a lot to learn.... so please, please!!! if there is something absolutely necessarily have to have or do to improve my effectiveness, please, please share it with me. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showUserPublicProfile?gid=blakkon>blakkon</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 680<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(5/7/03 3:46 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm45.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=99.topic&index=4>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Advices for shaman</span><hr size=1> Greetings young Shaman!<br>
<br>
It is well known that when spells are freshly scribed that they are not the most efficient to cast.   In time, they become easier and will drain less of your resources.  (Not sure on the details, but there is an extra mana cost for spells until they are a level or two old.  So your 34 spells will cost you less, and your mana pool will be larger in a few levels).<br>
<br>
Do you know the cannidance?  This is a way that many shaman have managed to squeeze a little extra mana.<br>
<br>
(make a hotkey and label it canni. <br>
<br>
/sit off (in case you hit it when your sitting)<br>
/cast 8 (if canni is in your bottom spell slot)<br>
/pause 25 (have to mess around with this depending on your connection)<br>
/sit on.<br>
<br>
Now every six seconds the server updates your hitpoints based on regeneration, and naturak regen.  try to watch your hp or mana bar and when you see it update hit the button.  the effect is you catch the meditation tick, stand up canni, then sit down in time for the next med tick.  A very good way to cut downtime.  I generally aimed to keep my hp and mana bars about equal.  Also if there is downtime  and you are below half mana, let melee's bandage you to speed your mana regen).<br>
<br>
Now many folk want shaman spirits, fact is we can improve near everything on a fighter.   This becomes hard to do if you get into a fighter heavy group and have the additional duties of healing to go along with your normal debuffing and buffing.  The following is wise to consoder in these cases...<br>
<br>
1) In a fighter heavy group, leave the fighting to your pup and the fighters.  Fact is after 20's or so we fall way off the curve in melee effectiveness and your better spending yoru time doin the dance between heals and the like.<br>
<br>
Prioritize buffs. <br>
<br>
2) It will be very hard to keep regen on more than yourself and one other before the group version at 56 seasons.  its great to downtime heal, but only you, and the puller or main tank need to have it on all the time.  <br>
<br>
3) Talisman is good to keep on those who may take damage. Again, a rogue may never take more than a few hits all night, they really dont need the extra hitpoints, but can benefit from str and dex instead. <br>
<br>
4) Shield, again, only yourself and those taking hits need it. <br>
<br>
5) Stamina, yourself, and those taking hits.<br>
<br>
6) agi a bit of extra ac, so again on those who take hits. <br>
<br>
7) your dog wont be tanking for you for a long time.  He gets haste, and doesn't nee dmuch more.<br>
<br>
Finally, you decide who gets what buffs.  don't feel obligated to give every melee every buff, and feel free to say no.  If you are healer the buffs will have to be less than if you are just debuffing.<br>
<br>
Well, there's plenty more, but hopefully soemthing here will help. <br>

<br>
Me can gib you some tips :<br>
- go AC/HP way, you have to tank (( or play a druid <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :D --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/happy.gif ALT=":D"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :p --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":p"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :D --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/happy.gif ALT=":D"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  ))<br>
- try to find some focus items such as extended enhancements...<br>
<br>
- you have a lot of tools, don't try to use them all. Only time when  you have to use all your tools is when you're soloing. When I grouped at your leve, I often pulled (using slow), but if I had to be main healer, I barely casted a DoT or melee (not that fun), but I could slow every mobs we had and offtank one if needed. In this case, I spent my time cannibalizing and my main concern was to be able to regenerate my mana as fast as possible, not having a furious mana pool (wis was about 130 140 aroundthis levels, AC was about 750-800, don't remember hp) and I did really good. My group barely had breaks, and they never where on my request, was always between 20 and 60 mana. Remember that our DoTs are not that good in a group a 34th level ; disease takes too long to be efiicient and poison does few damages.<br>

The diamond dust can be picked up on the iceburg in timorous, The yun powder comes from Trak's teeth, near the aqueduct. You can do this in a small group.  The parts from city of mist and karnors you will have to buy, fortuantely if you watch the bazaar they pop up now and then.  <p>Lorec<br>

Your advice is very good...<br>
<br>
TAKE HEED YOUNG SHAMAN!!!<br>
<br>
Being a 54 Shaman with what I consider to be SUB-PAR GEAR (prolly have the gear most 45-50 Shaman should have already), I cannot emphasize the need to IMPROVE YOUR ARMOR CLASS and HIT POINTS...<br>
<br>
Mobs you will be facing above 50 generally do between 100-250 a hit (wide range I know), and if you have a 900 AC and 1300 HP's unbuffed, plan on getting ALOT of Rezzes LOL!<br>
<br>
Don't hesitate to PAY for KEI or Temperance... or any other enhancing buffs...  JUST don't pay a FORTUNE for them LOL!<br>
<br>
Most important, HAVE FUN, thats what this game is all about...  Sometimes we get so caught up in the mechanics we forget why were here!!!<br>

Does anyone have any Pro's/Con's for a 2 handed weapon ?<br>

Ae am able to get most of the quest components for the Cannibalize II spell. <br>

My roadblock is the alchemy skill high enough to make the successfull combine for the turn-in in Dreadlands.  The scrolls I read said an alchemy of 70 is the lowest possible.<br>
<br>
Me alchemy is only 37 and ae ran out of me 2K plat jist ta get it there. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :( --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/frown.gif ALT=":("><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   With glamour and 2 steins, me charisma is 142 and ae purchase all me alchemy ingredients in Halas.<br>
<br>
It would take me another few more season before ae kin afford ta get me alchemy to 70 jist ta make the successfull combine. &lt;sniff again&gt;<br>
<br>
If anyone kin help how ae kin work up me alchemy that is more affordable, please share...if not, ae be glued to me ice block in Everfrost ferever!!!!!! ARG!!<br>

<!--EZCODE FONT START--><span style="color: red;">UNLIFE AWARENESS til skill 42 (cheap to make and you can actually sell them in bazaar)<br>

One of the STAT potions (STABILITY, VIGOR, COHESION, etc) up to 76-83 skilll<br>
<br>
and then TITAN seems to be the cheapest ingredient wise to get up to 180... </span><!--EZCODE FONT END--><br>
<br>
As for CANNI II - I wouldn't bother...   its a crappy QUEST - alot of work for a pretty worthless spell...<br>
<br>
I would wait for CANNI III @ season 54, IMHO...<br>
<br>
FOCUS ON AC AND HP's!!!!   And resist gear if you plan on doing any REAL raiding...<br>
