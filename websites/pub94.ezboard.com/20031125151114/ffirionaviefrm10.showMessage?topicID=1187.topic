Please forgive the repost, it is mainly to spark my own RP juices with someone I thought I'd let die a long time ago. ))<br>
<br>
Gapemaw lie in the deep moss, his massive head cradled in the gnarled roots of a twisted cypress that forced itself up through the peat. Pointing skyward like an accusing finger, the tree shot through the dense underbrush and aspired to the heavens before spreading out, mingling with its neighbors to form a dense canopy. The jungle floor pulsated with the thick, sickly heat of decay as the earth itself sweated in the sweltering confines of the Feerott. The Ogre sighed contentedly, allowing himself a precious moment of relaxation as he noisily sucked the marrow from a shattered bone he fished from his rucksack.<br>
<br>
The high afternoon sun forced its way angrily through the canopy, hurling brilliant spears of light into the underbrush. The fiery arrows picked their targets, deepening the shadows and making the minutest detail stand forth in sharp relief. The steam and haze rose tentatively from the rich soil, wrapping everything in a dense curtain of emerald green.<br>
<br>
A parrot shot through the tree trunks overhead, a multicolored arrow streaking from left to right in defiance of the brilliant bars bursting through the leaves above. With an ethereal screech, the bird banked tightly and disappeared further into the deep jungle. <br>
<br>
Gapemaw applauded quietly, thoroughly enjoying the brilliant display above him. He had always been fascinated by colors, and the jungle offered him a daily palette of supersaturated hues. Sitting bolt upright, the ogre decided he would not like to let his mental image of the event fade. Biting his lower lip, Gapemaw began to commit the bird's passage to memory, furrowing his brow as he replayed the event over and over in his mind. After several long seconds, a slight grin cracked his face and he settled back into his resting space.<br>
<br>
Parrot. The word drifted forward from his subconscious, painting itself onto the inside of Gapemaw's resting eyelids. Gapemaw took great delight in words, almost as much as he did in the way light played off of different surfaces, giving birth to a multitude of hues and textures. He had developed a talent for words almost unheard of in his race since the Curse, and Gapemaw took great pains to constantly expand and exercise his grasp on the nuances of language.<br>
<br>
Parrots. Tropical and semitropical zygodactyl birds of the order Psittaciformes, characterized by a short hooked bill, brightly colored plumage, and, in some species, the ability to mimic speech patterns or other sounds. The birds couldn't understand what they were saying, but with some training, could be taught any number of words - even sentences. Gapemaw had trained a parrot once. He had found an injured parrot at the base of a tree, a brilliant bird of emerald green plumage. Mr. Biteybeak had learned sixteen words as Gapemaw nursed him back to health in a small box at the back of the Greenblood guildhall. The bird had shown great promise as a potential mascot, bearing a striking resemblance to the faded parrot painted on the cracked, blistering sign outside the hall. For two weeks, Gapemaw hand fed the parrot and lovingly nursed his wounds with his characteristic single-minded attention, until the bird snapped at the ogre's thick finger.<br>
<br>
Mr. Biteybeak had been delicious.<br>
<br>
A sharp crack shocked Gapemaw out of his reverie. His eyes snapped open as he scanned the surrounding underbrush for the source of the sound. Twin red eyes peered at him from behind a thorny bush, stabbing at him from a lumpy, pasty face. The Craknek thug stared hard at Gapemaw, weighing his chances against the resting shadowknight. There was no love lost between the Greenbloods and the Crakneks, and members of both sides took great delight in goading, taunting, and waylaying their counterparts whenever the opportunity presented itself.<br>
<br>
Gapemaw's thick lips pulled back involuntarily, baring his massive teeth in a fierce, silent snarl. His brow furrowed heavily as he stared down the intruder. Seeing that there would be no easy victory here, the Craknek warrior backed slowly away, keeping his eye on Gapemaw even as the green mists swallowed his silhouette.<br>
<br>
Annoyed at the disruption of his quiet contemplation, Gapemaw sat up, drawing his knees to his chin and sulking. He threw the remains of his broken marrow-bone into the underbrush, as if to chase away the specter of the departed warrior.<br>
<br>
Growling in frustration, he fished deep into his satchel, finally pulling out a weather-beaten leather tome and a delicate pair of wire spectacles. The lenses of the battered frames had long since fallen out, but Gapemaw was a stickler for ritual, which meant that the reading glasses went with him wherever he went. In his mind, perching the twisted wire creation on the end of his nose - the hook back arms straining ludicrously around his massive head in a vain attempt to find purchase on his gnarled ears - was as vital to the reading process as the book. Without one, he mused to himself, the other was as useless as a Craknek warrior's washcloth. He chuckled to himself, pleased with his own cleverness.<br>
<br>
The book fell open to the middle, pages spreading out in his gentle hands like the wings of a bird in flight. He carefully placed a thick finger in the middle of a line and began slowly reading aloud to himself. His jawed worked silently as his finger traced his progress down the page, his hushed muttering breathing silent encouragement to his pioneering digit. Every few moments, he would suck in his lower lip and reseat his ponderous bulk as he hunched over the text, plowing through the arduous process of committing the words to memory.<br>
<br>
He needed no context or continuity in his reading. He read for the experience, looking for a new concept or elegant turn of the phrase like a prospector panning for gold. What did not fit his needs or what he did not understand was tucked away somewhere inside his enormous skull, where it waited breathlessly with a hundred thousand others for some new revelation to free it from inside its walless prison in a sudden burst of relevancy.<br>
<br>
Just such an epiphany occurred on the afternoon in question, as Gapemaw's mind made the spontaneous connection between the Allize Volew Lizardmen and the strange and hunched Eeksar that he saw scurry toward the mysterious book the week prior. He had known what an Eeksar was from a sketch made in &quot;Vol D'Alhab's Entymological Survey of the Mysterious and Magikal Realm of Kunark, Vol. II&quot; that he carried in his satchel. <br>
<br>
Gapemaw sat with his back against the bole of the tree, chewing gently on the end of his glasses while he mused over this new connection. The Allize Volew and Allize Taew proved little more than an annoyance to the Ogres in the Feerrott, as the slender reptiles could not hope to match the raw power of the hulking Ogres. However, they remained a persistant irritation, as the clever things were cunning enough to continually avoid the crushing hammer of the Bouncers' patrols. The idea of a stronger Allize Volew, a powerful Eeksar warrior that maintained the same low cunning of his Feerrott kin would be a worthy foe, indeed. If only they had been born of Rallos Zek...<br>
<br>
The hulking ogre scowled, face darkening. The implications this train of thought raised troubled him mightily. The Ogres were unmatched for physical prowess, of this he was sure. But he continually saw his kin kowtowing to the wants of the visiting Dark Elves, bowing to the Elves' big brains. A low rumble forced its way from the back of his throat. A black rage began forming at the base of his neck, setting his hair on end.<br>
<br>
The mightiest of the world's warriors, playing porter to a race that lacked the spine to stand at the front line. The Ogres should be leading the charge, forging a new empire of the Fist, crushing all who dare to oppose the will of Zek. Instead, their pudding brains keep them in the role of stooge, acting as henchmen and meatshields to those with the smarts, who make war from the shadows and use the others as pawns. Gapemaw gripped a root unconsciously, twisting the hardened wood until it began to splinter and break.<br>
<br>
Shoving the book and spectacles back into his back he threw himself to his feet, stalking back through the jungle to his home. He had to speak to Kizrak the Tyrant. Kizrak was wise, and he was sometimes willing to teach Gapemaw those things he was able to learn. The Tyrant had little patience, however, and Gape often needed concepts explained two or three times before he could fully store the new information for later.<br>
<br>
He stalked past the mystical book without so much as a glance, narrowly avoiding a Teir'Dal enchanter struggling under a heavy pack. He continued toward the gates, fuming over the fall of Rallos' children when the Dark Elf shouted angrily.<br>
<br>
&quot;You, there! Get back here, you insolent cur! You can't just brush past me, you lout. By the Father, I'd use your hollow skull for a goblet, if I thought it could hold more than a swallow!&quot; <br>
<br>
Gapemaw turned and stared hard at the caster. His face was a solid mask, but his eyes glittered pure hatred. Silently, he began to reach out with one giant hand. The caster shrugged himself out of his pack and was tightening the straps as he prepared to hand it to Gapemaw to carry.<br>
<br>
&quot;About time you remembered your place, you filthy animal. Be careful with this, as it contains some valuable trinkets that I won't stand to be broken. And don't think for a moment I don't know exactly what's in there. I'll hold you personally responsible if anything ends up miss... urk!&quot;<br>
<br>
Gapemaw closed his hand around the enchanter's slender neck, squeezing slowly as he lifted the frail Dark Elf off the ground. The Teir'Dal kicked frantically, pulling desperately at Gapemaw's thick fingers as he fought to force out his eldritch words of power.<br>
<br>
But Gapemaw continued to squeeze, delighting in the wheezing gasps his prey emitted and the pulsing vibrations he felt on his palm. A thrill shot through his body, as he was realizing his race's destiny, crashing headlong into the tradition of servitude that had developed since the Crse. Drawing his face closer to the terrified Elf, Gapemaw's lips pulled back into a horrible smile. Waves of ecstatic joy rippled along his spine as he heard the first cracklings of the enchanter's neck as it began to splinter like kindling. The stranger's eyes rolled back in his head, as if he were making a final, silent prayer to his Hateful Father.<br>
<br>
With eyes of pure rage glittering maniacally, lips twisted back in an obscene smile, Gapemaw felt the words leap from his body with a life of their own. He heard them for the first time in a voice that was not truly his, a resonance of his deepest subconscious given a fierce form.<br>
<br>
&quot;All.. will.. bow down... to Rallos... ZEK!&quot;<br>
<br>
With an emphatic twist to punctuate his words, Gapemaw felt the enchanter's neck snap in his hand. There was a final gasp as its body tensed, and then sagged limply. Gape let the corpse drop onto the mossy ground, the head lying at a grotesque angle to the rest of the remains. <br>
<br>
Gapemaw expected to feel ill, as he did after a battle, with adreneline rushing from his limbs. But instead of a sense of loss, the Greenblood felt charged with a divine passion. Here before him was incontrovertible proof of the Ogre's Manifest. Smiling, he turned once more to his home to sit and reflect on the day, and to commit every detail of his act to his ironclad memory.<br>
