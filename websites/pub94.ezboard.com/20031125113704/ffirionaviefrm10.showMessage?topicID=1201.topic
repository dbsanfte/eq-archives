Answers about ourselves that we dare not seek, for knowing the truth could destroy everything we had come to believe in.  Of all the hardships, battles, and obsticles we over come throughout our lives it is often within these answers that we find ourselves lacking.<br>
<br>
Acceptance and Truth about one's self is a luxery that few are even willing to obtain, though those who do and have survived the Trial of Self find a power far greater then that of the Gods themselves.  Are you willing to look within, to find whom you truely are?  Are you ready to face that which you find there in?  We often find ourselves unprepared for even these questions when they come, as Shintou did within the Dreaming.<br>
<br>
A Pera'dal girl appeared before Shintou, standing where Miiyu had been but moments before. She had strawberry blonde hair kept in a bouncey ponytail held up with a large blue bow.  Storm grey eyes sparkled with a brightness unlike any he had ever seen before.  She wore a made servant's dress that made her appear to be a little girl, though the look within her eyes showed her to be far older then she seemed.<br>
<br>
&quot;Hello&quot; she said brightly.<br>
<br>
&quot;...What the hell is that?&quot;  Shintou actually looked mildly afraid.<br>
<br>
&quot;What is what?&quot; The girl looked around in confusion.<br>
<br>
&quot;Kill it Shin!  It's ugly!&quot; Kenshin said.<br>
<br>
&quot;Kill what?&quot; She asked, jumping about the couch in an effort to get away from what ever the child was going on about, a look of fear upon her face. &quot;What is it???&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;You appearntly... little girl.&quot; Shintou said coldly.<br>
<br>
&quot;ME?&quot;  The girl said, looking slightly hurt.<br>
<br>
&quot;Yes you, what do you want now?&quot;  Shintou said, starting to look annoyed.<br>
<br>
The girl blinked a moment, the huffs as she places her hands upon her hips.<br>
<br>
&quot;I am NOT ugly you.... you... you.. MEANIE!!&quot;  She said as she stuck her tongue out at Shintou.<br>
<br>
<br>
&quot;This... is pointless..&quot;  Shintou said in annoyance. &quot;What the hell are you up to, Bard!?&quot;<br>
<br>
The girl looked confused for a moment. &quot;Bard? oh! Idanya...&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;All of the illusions and games, what are you getting at?!&quot; He asked angrily.<br>
<br>
&quot;Miiyu thought I should talk to you for some reason...&quot; She said with a smile.<br>
<br>
&quot;What possibly could you have to say to me?&quot; He asked in disgust.<br>
<br>
&quot;I'm not an illusion&quot; She said defensivly. &quot;I dunno.. ask Miiyu.  SHE'S the one who insisted that I come here.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;She disappeared.  That..mental avatar thing.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;She can still hear you.  We all can, it's just that only one of us can appear and speak at a time.&quot; <br>
<br>
&quot;Well Cow?  What is the point?  So it's a child?&quot; Shintou asked to the air about him.<br>
<br>
&quot;So um.... would you.... like.. anything to.. drink?&quot;  She asked.<br>
<br>
 &quot;No..&quot;<br>
<br>
The girl smiles brightly, &quot;eat?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;No..&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Change of clothes?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Nay&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Need anything cleaned?&quot; She asked as she leaned foward, an inquisitive look upon her face.<br>
<br>
&quot;Kenshin needs a bath, I think.  Dirty halfbreeds you know?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Oh, alright then.  This way.&quot;  She says with a bright smile upon her face.<br>
<br>
&quot;He seems to have disappeared.&quot;<br>
<br>
The girl's face falls slightly. &quot;Oh.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;He hates girls, you know.&quot;<br>
<br>
She gasps. &quot;So he likes... men?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Hell, he used to be little and kind before I came along.  Before his mother and step father were slain because of him.&quot; Shintou continued with a smirk on his own.<br>
<br>
&quot;No&quot; He said in answer to her question.<br>
<br>
The girls eyes went wide as she brought her hands to her mouth.  &quot;Oh no, that's terrible!!!  The poor thing....&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;He hated being a haldbreed since that day, that's when he found Innoruuk.  He was trained to be a Shadow Knight by Yotoden, I believe that's when he created me and..... stopped growing.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;How so very sad.&quot; The girl said as her eyes began to shimmer from the tears welling within.<br>
<br>
&quot;It's how he wishes it.  Hatred is his only desire, without it he would destroy himself.  That's why he fights, he enjoys combat.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;But...but... how could he live that way?&quot; She asked in horror.<br>
<br>
&quot;You're a lightbringer.  You could never understand.&quot; He said coldly.<br>
<br>
&quot;I suppose I am, but I don't mind.&quot; She said, smiling brightly though her eyes still filled with tears.<br>
<br>
&quot;That scares me.&quot; Shintou said with a strange look upon his face.<br>
<br>
&quot;What does?&quot; She asked, canting her head to one side.<br>
<br>
&quot;Brightness.  No one shoud be that damned happy.&quot; He said with disguset.<br>
<br>
&quot;Why not?&quot; She asked innocently.<br>
<br>
&quot;Hatred and killing are a part of life.  Too bad for those getting killed.  They are only cattle anyhow.  Slaughter for our own amusement.&quot; He said darkly.<br>
<br>
&quot;Well THAT'S not a very nice thing to say&quot; She huffed.<br>
<br>
&quot;Well, I'm not a very nice person.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;No, you're not.  You big bully!&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Children&quot; He muttered.<br>
<br>
&quot;You go and kill people just to make yourself feel all bug and strong.  Is that it?&quot; She demanded.<br>
<br>
&quot;So weak, so pathetic. Strength is all that matters in this world.  The strong stand tall and rule over the weak.&quot; He continued to mutter.<br>
<br>
&quot;I am not a child.&quot; She stated.<br>
<br>
&quot;You look like one to me, little girl.&quot; He snarled.<br>
<br>
&quot;I'm older then Idanya&quot; She said defensivly.<br>
<br>
&quot;As if Idanyas actually old&quot; He retorted.<br>
<br>
&quot;Well....actually everyone is older then Idanya&quot; She admitted.  &quot;How old is the little boy?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Nine was when the training ended and he was strong enough to be me.  A shame for him that he can not see that he is me, that I am ...well... We're both the same, really.  That little child's love turned into all hatred... by a single moment of slaughter really.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;OOoooOOOooo, that's how old Idanya is!!&quot; She said excitedly as Shintou gave the boy's age, then fell silent at the rest of his story.<br>
<br>
&quot;His self hatred however keeps him from seeing that he is the same as myself.&quot; Shintuo said with a shrug.<br>
<br>
&quot;The poor thing&quot; She said with a sad look upon her face. &quot;Wait, why are you telling me all of this?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Well maybe if I do we can get to the point of why you are trying to pick me apart.&quot; He snarled.<br>
<br>
&quot;Because... no child should have to go through all that pain.  I feel sorry for Idanya too... but... she never even got to BE a child.&quot; The girl said sadly.<br>
<br>
&quot;And who the hell are you?&quot; Shintou demanded.<br>
<br>
&quot;I'm not trying to do anything, except figure out why Miiyu thought I should talk to you.&quot; The girl blushed at Shintou's question.<br>
<br>
&quot;Oh! How rude of me!!  My name is Asana. I... well... I was a servant girl in House VoKhalorn before I was....well... killed&quot; She said with a slightly sadden tone.<br>
<br>
&quot;Well, Miiyu.  What is the point of this Cow?&quot; Shintou demanded as Asana was speaking.<br>
<br>
&quot;Don't you call Miiyu that you big bully!!&quot; Asana demanded as she placed her hands on her hips.  Shintou simply looked confused at the girl.<br>
<br>
&quot;Idanya was trying to make.... a friend that I knew when I was alive feel better... so... she channled me.  I ended up staying because Idanya agreed to help me...&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Never heard of your House..&quot; He said coldly.<br>
<br>
&quot;It's gone&quot; She said sadly.<br>
<br>
&quot;Oh well.. why they weould have a servant girl allowed to be as annoying as you are is beyong me.  You deserve to die.&quot; He said harshly.<br>
<br>
&quot;Thats SO MEAN!!  I am NOT annoying&quot; Asana countered.<br>
<br>
&quot;She is not answering&quot; Shintou stated in extream annoyance.<br>
<br>
Shintou blinked as suddenly Idanya was standing before him again, a large grin upon her face. <p><!--EZCODE FONT START--><span style="color:gray;font-size:xx-small;"><!--EZCODE CENTER START--><div style="text-align:center"><!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>~Dro l'klew'ar whol neitar 'sohna yorn ol doer, lueth vel'drav ol zhah alus, dos inbal jhal er'griff l'tahta ol zet rathrea~<br>
