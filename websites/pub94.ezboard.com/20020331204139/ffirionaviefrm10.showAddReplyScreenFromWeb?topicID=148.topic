(part 1)</span><hr size=1> I realize that I have been vague about my past until this point, a situation that shall now be rectified. My memories are not of difficult times, struggles, or honor, as are many of those here. Indeed, I was well cared for throughout my life, and have not been through many hard times until now. My past, however, is full of confusion about who I am and what I am meant to do. Here is my story.<br>
<br>
I was born and raised in Shar Vahl with many other cubs. We played all the usual cub-games: hunter and prey, king of the hill, wrestling. Every day we would run around our homes in the city, even after it was pitch-black, until our mothers herded us inside and off to bed with a story. I did not know, then, why my mother looked at me so sadly every night when she thought I was asleep. Then, it didn't matter. The new day would come, and we would be off to play again.<br>
<br>
Some of the guards watched us during the day. We thought they were simply bored of standing around all day, but as we grew older, they began to take more interest in our games, singling out those of us who did very well. Those lucky few were sometimes invited to the palace, and offered training as Khala Dun. I was never one of the ones chosen, although I did my fair share in the games. This was around the time I was of thirteen years. As time went on, I found the games less and less exciting, preferring to sneak off and listen to the storytellers who were in the city proper. I was not doing anything wrong by being there, but I somehow knew that the other children would laugh, and drag me back to their games. And so I went alone into the city. I heard many tales during those days: tales of heroes and kings, tales of magic and power, tales of love and peace. But the ones that I loved, more than any others, were the tales of the great hunters of our people, who could sneak through the forests and thickets of Luclin, striking swiftly against any that would harm us. I began to yearn for the outside world. Soon I learned to slip past the guards into the Thicket south of the city. I had naught but a play spear, but I found young hoppers straying from their parents, and speared them, thinking of myself as a great warrior all the while. Soon, I moved to Cht'Thk beetles emerging from their shells. These were more dangerous, and provided better sport, for the bloodlings kept close watch of them, and I knew that I could not stop one of them. Things went well for a long time as I improved my techniques, hiding from Vah Shir trainees and guards all the while, until the day I was seen.<br>
<br>
I was watching a young hopper, ready to strike, when I was suddenly grabbed by the scruff of my neck and pulled to my feet. Whirling around, I saw an Animalist standing over me, clad in hopperhide armor and holding a pair of horns in each hand. &quot;What,&quot; he said, &quot;is a cubling doing in the thicket?&quot; I protested, saying that I knew well the danger and would have had the beetle if only he had not come. He simply pointed behind him, saying, &quot;That is what would have become of you.&quot; Turning, I saw a warder, a beast of legend, standing over the shredded corpse of a needle-clawed hopper, and realized that it had been watching me all the while. I quickly turned and tried to run, but he grabbed me tightly and escorted me back to the city. The guards were astonished to find that I had slipped past them, and demanded to know how long it had been occurring. &quot;Two years,&quot; I said, and their faces grew grim. The Animalist ordered a new guard to be placed so that none would sneak out again, and took me into the city, saying only, &quot;I will take care of this one.&quot; Upon hearing this I feared the worst punishments a young child can. He took me back to my house in the city amidst the stares of the other children. My face grew hot as we continued down the road. It seemed an eternity before we reached my house. My mother came to the door, and was taken aback to see me in the hands of an Animalist. &quot;I cannot stay for long,&quot; he said, &quot;but we must deal with your young one.&quot; I was sent off to my room with the door closed tightly, and I could hear the breathing of the warder on the other side, ensuring that I dare not leave.<br>
<br>
After a time, the Animalist came into my room and sat on the floor beside me. He said, &quot;I have spoken with your caretakers and determined what we shall do with you.&quot; &quot;Do you not mean my parents?&quot; I asked, frightened by this strange speech. &quot;No,&quot; he said, &quot;for your parents they are not, and never have been. You have been raised by these people because they were deemed caring, and had no cub of their own.&quot; I knew what he referred to, it being a common practice for Vah Shir to support one another, but I still protested that it could not be true, that they must be my parents, that I was simply born as a single cub and not in a litter. But he shook his head. He took my arm, then, and rolled up the sleeve, to show a scar. &quot;This,&quot; he said, &quot;is a mark of your kin. Find it, and your shall find others of your true family.&quot; He then looked me straight in the eyes. A more terrible and awesome visage I have never seen. He said, &quot;do I frighten you, child?&quot; I nodded slowly. &quot;I am a Khati Sha. Do you know what that is?&quot; I replied that I had heard the tales of the storytellers, and he said, &quot;then why fear me? For do the Khati Sha not protect our people, as do the Khala Dun of whom you have surely heard?&quot; I said that I feared punishment, that surely his warder would eat me for being such a naughty child. At this he laughed until tears came out of his eyes. &quot;My warder would not harm a hair on your body unless you tried to attack me,&quot; he said. He bade me come and run my hand through its beautiful fur, and I became less afraid, although no less puzzled at why I was not being punished. The warder purred happily, and I had a sudden desire to run off with it at my side, back into the world. But it was not to be. The Animalist rose then, and I heard no more of him for many years.<br>
<br>
I walked out into the common room of the house, and looked my mother in the eye... and she looked away. That was when I knew all of it to be true, and I ran into my room and lay on the bed, crying until there were no more tears.<br>
