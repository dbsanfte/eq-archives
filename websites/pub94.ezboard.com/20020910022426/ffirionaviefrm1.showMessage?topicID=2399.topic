In fact both Cyrlia's parents were half-elves. This fact gives her a sence of racial existence unlike most other half-elves. She see's herself as neither part human, nor part high elven, but something brand new. For a while she's been wanting to promote a racial name for half-elves like all the other elven races have.<br><br>Another thing I look at is the starting stats to define a 'typical' member of that race. Half-elves have a lower stength and stamina than humans, but higher than elves. Thus they are typically the runts when growing up in human lands and the big kids when raised by elves. Also, they have an amazingly low starting wisdom. Wisdom seems to be a collection of common sense, maturity level, and will power. Thus half-elves might tend to be flighty,  immature (Cyl sure is), and sometimes downright foolhardy.<br><br>Amounst races other than elves(Wood &amp; High) and humans, half-elves seem to be considered elves.

'tenacious' is a word i constantly use to describe them.<br><br>dwarves are folk of few words.  they have a sense of humour that one will only discover after trust has been established, but once you've earned it they will gladly die for you.  their main focus is on doing the task at hand well, but will happily fall over drunk with you in an alley sometime afterwards.  stalwart, and steadfast are two words that come to mind.  they deal with each effort as if they were crafting a fine weapon.<br><br>woodelves are usually played as jolly tree huggers, always nice to anyone they don't have a particular grudge against.  although i won't deny anyone their right to play that way, i would take the more tolkienien woodelf over them anyday.  as such, woodelves would be much more mischievious, and at times cruel than most people play them, and not always view outsiders in with the welcome which seems prevalent now.  &quot;fey&quot; is a word that could be used to describe how i view the 'ideal' woodelf.  <br><br>but NOT highelves.  highelves are not fey, although they can be dangerous.  highelves conduct themselves with an inborn sense of their own superiority.  people call them arrogant, but it is a rather difficult for one to feel impressed with the works of other races when you've lived to see them rise and fall, and are still standing.  honour rules highelves, and although they have some bitter and old disputes with certain races, i doubt they'd desire to stoop as low as their enemy's tactics even if it meant vanquishing their opponent.<br><br>erudites are very interesting, although to really understand any of them one would have to spend much time.  they're not given to blabbing &amp; socializing.  they cut everything down to the most efficient system as possible.  i agree that they have the most monkish or priestly attitude of all the races, and desire knowledge to the exclusion of everything else, even if that means the destruction of others.  <br><br>this race has a great potential to be evil simply in their disregard for everything inferior, and they view almost everything besides their own works to be inferior.  think of the cold, heartless mad scientist bent on ruling the world but not ruled by his own passions, and that might sum them up very well.  'sober' &amp; 'studious' are what i think of when i see an erudite.<br><br>halflings.  well, can anyone do any more with halflings?  we all know what they are like, it seems.<br><br>dark elves i have a distinct disadvantage with, having never read these novels of Drows myself.  i would think that norrath's darkelves would best be described by the word 'cunning'.  they seem to have much infighting, and a caste system that is very complicated and changes at the whim of the ruling powers, or by the assassin's blade.  which means that they must constantly strive to be alert and suspicious of each other at all times.  <br><br>in this environment, i don't understand how anyone could play a dark elf as 'honour bound' or even how they justify love in their society, as power is the name of the game and how it was obtained is irrelevant.  but i am always willing to take an individual as just that, and set aside my stereotypes when they don't fit.<br><br>as for trolls and ogres, i know little about them except that they have cannabalistic tendencies.  anyone care to share their trollish or ogrish culture?<br><br>iksar i won't even mention.  zildrax would beat me to a bloody pulp with his tail. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :lol --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/laugh.gif ALT=":lol"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br><br>edit:  humans, how could i forget them!  well, we are humans, so what more is there to say?  we're unruly rabble most times, and can sway whichever way the wind is blowing.       <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ulunathreee.showPublicProfile?language=EN>lunathreee</A> at: 7/24/02 12:03:51 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/uvallerianwintermyst.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Vallerian Wintermyst</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 6<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(7/24/02 12:16:54 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2399.topic&index=12>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: another novel response (in length, not wit)</span><hr size=1> Lunathreee,<br><br>You didn't mention any description on the Vah Shir race.

Two people may join into a marriage to strengthen their house or even personal power.<br><br>Everything is about politics, even if you try to escape them.<br><br>Ogres have an extensive culture, it is just not so apparent - especially with the VI reinforced behaviour of dumbspeak.  They have a history, and surprisingly, they seem to not be as destructive as some would play them.  They have castes within their society that they are proud to belong to, and they are proud to be ogres.  Now that the curse has started to lift there are even more ogres showing up that can speak normally, so even more ogre customs are apparent.  They have a crude architecture - I see Ogres as being simplistic, doing only what needs to be done.  Their homes are made of carved slabs of stone, and the tunneling they do is crude and not reinforced for strength or beauty.  Utility rules in Ogre life.<br><br>Trolls have a little less culture, but they do have a history.  According to Banegrivm's texts, they were children of Cazic-Thule on Kunark.  Cazic abandoned them and they fought a massive war amongst their various clans, until Trakanon intervened somewhat and a great troll leader arose and took control of the two remaining clans.<br><br>The trolls later were abandoned by Trakanon, so they led themselves across the ocean to Broken Skull Rock.  From there they moved to found Grobb within Innothule swamp and immediately began warring with both the Frogloks who use the swamp as their spawning ground and the Ogres of the Feerott.  Over time the strength of the ogres drew a stalemate with the ferocity and regenerative powers of the Trolls, and they grew a hateful respect towards one another.  I see Ogres and Trolls disliking each other greatly, but I imagine they would stand together against a larger force.<br><br>The Trolls that began to worship Innoruuk moved on to leadership within Grobb, while those trolls that worshipped Cazic-Thule still were exiled to the swamp (Lynuga, A Troll Slayer) or to Broken Skull Rock (the faction Broken Skull Clan)<br><br>Trolls IMO are vicious and warlike, more clannish then ogres, but also not as intelligent or wise.  Their dumbspeak I feel is certainly warranted. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/uzildrax.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Zildrax</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Iksar Fanatic</span><br>  Posts: 552<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(7/24/02 12:27:45 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2399.topic&index=14>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: another novel response (in length, not wit)</span><hr size=1> Aww, Lunathree, you fear me, I'm touched! *grins*<br><br>How I view Iksar, well, lessee...<br><br>Noble, efficent, honorble, harsh, proud, and ruthless.<br><br>Iksar have had a very bloody and harsh history, and the only time they ever knew peace was when they sucessfully conquerd their foes, it's easy to see how they ended up the way they are. They tend to be similar to high elves in some ways, their extremely honorble, and dislike deciet of any sort. (including the kind produced by magic or illusions) Their arrogant on a racial level, viewing the Iksar race as above all others, but on an individual level, their fairly humble, often viewing themselves as a small part of a greater thing. The most important thing to them is ensuring the survival of their race,  and they have no problem killing any member of their society they feel weakens it more then helps. Their extremely efficent, and in my opinian, would have the greatest and most skilled armies in Norrath. They want to conquer the world, as they view every other race as horrendous, flawed and a plauge to Norrath, and think they are all better off enslaved or dead. They also tend to feel anyone they don't conquer will eventually try and conquer them.<br><br>Iksar like things to be extremely organized and efficent, and also like to have no doubts in their mind about their brethren. They like to be able to trust every Iksar they see completely without even so much as a second thought. Since Iksar society has very strictly enforced laws and everyone is born to their job and given orders for their entire life, as well as they basically enforce complete and total honesty on eachother, they end up viewing soft skin societies as anarchistic and greed filled. They are always very honest, even with their enemies. They rarely hide their intentions or the intentions of their people as they are always proud of them, and when they do it's more through not mentioning things then lies. Iksar also have the unique perspective of while they acknowledge almost everyone as an enemy, they do not hate them. They aren't that emotional, an enemy is an enemy, one fights out of duty and because it's the right thing to do, not personal emotions.<br><br>While Cazic-Thule favors the Iksar, they are unaware of their gods relationship to other gods, (Or they just don't care) somthing I personally am glad for. *chuckles* <br><br>I've always found Iksar fascinating, one of my favorite races I ever stumbled across. *smiles* <p><img src="http://members.aol.com/bseh42/images/zilsig.jpg"></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/uzildrax.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Zildrax</A> at: 7/24/02 12:38:36 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/utresjoli.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Tresjoli</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.shadow-striders.com/images/wolfIcon.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Elven Princess</span><br>  Posts: 264<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(7/24/02 12:36:02 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2399.topic&index=15>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.cpinternet.com/~theduke/MythStuff/ez-tres.gif  WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: How do you view your race?</span><hr size=1> Interesting topic…<br><br>I don’t consider humans as scum of the earth, at least not all of them.  I see humans as the most diverse race.  They have goodly paladins and dirty, low-down, no-good necromancers and everything in between.<br><br>Some gnomes are cute and cuddly, while others are just plain weird.  Because of their lack of stature and the fact that they look like shriveled up old men, some male gnomes have a bit of an inferiority complex.  That’s why they feel compelled proclaim their “sexAness”.  It’s a bit of overcompensation, imo.  Overall they tend to have this obsession with mechanical objects.  I guess it’s good to have someone to perform more menial tasks, but it seems wholly unnatural to me to have a city filled with these clinking, clunking, mechanical contraptions. <br><br>Then there are my people, the elves.  Despite their claims to the contrary, the Koada’Dal (high elves) aren’t so very much different than we Fier’Dal (wood elves).  While it’s true they’re magic tends toward the arcane while ours is of the wild variety, the truth of the matter is that we elves have the same mother, Tunare, and both races (or sub-races to be more precise) have the same affinity for nature.   Need proof?  Just take a tour of Felwithe.  Look at the structures and speak with the people who inhabit them.<br><br>/ooc<br><br>Are Norrath’s half elves sterile?  I had never heard that they are.  I think this varies from fantasy world to fantasy world.  The lore of the game Shadowbane indicates that the half elves are strerile, but in more traditional settings like Middle Earth (Tolkien), Dragonlance, and Forgotten Realms half elves are not sterile.     <br> <p><b>Trésjoli Louveteau<BR><i>Femme d’esprit</i></b></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon3.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/uwraithbaneofsnowfallon.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Wraithbane of Snowfallon</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 76<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(7/24/02 12:49:23 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2399.topic&index=16>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> <BR><img src=http://www.eqfaces.com/photos/wraithbane3.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: another novel response (in length, not wit)</span><hr size=1> Uh huh, Zildrax.... Too bad they're EVIL! :)<br><br>High Elves in Norrath are interestingly different from what I have seen in other fantasy sources.  They once had a great empire. They build cities. They are often found as merchents in odd places. They are incapable of playing any of the evil or shady classes (with the possible exception of enchanters, but that is more of a philosophical debate) such as rogues.  They would seem to have no real sense of humor, to judge by the NPC's behavior. And they seem to have largely withdrawn to Felwithe to concern themselves only with battling the local orc population.<br><br>I would guess from this that High Elfs are somewhat haughty and proud, but not really very in touch with the current state of affairs in Norrath. Living off of past glory, perhaps.  Yet, they are well received by relatively many races, and there are those curiously wide-spread merchants....  So I suppose that there is a middle class of merchants that are not so preoccupied with the past martial might of the Elfin race, and not quite so proud as to avoid contact with other races to make a profit.<br><br>Too generalize, it seems that most other races do not exactly LIKE High Elves, but they do TRUST them.  As a race, High Elves seem to be remarkably consistent, perhaps even predictable.  With some notable exceptions (my good friend, Isharra comes to mind. :0 ).<br><br>My character is more &quot;old school&quot;. Haughty, refusing to speak any language but Elvish, not really fully confident in group mates that are not High Elfs (though too polite to say so), polite in a formal, distant sort of way.... <p>Wraithbane<BR>Paladin of Tunare<BR><A HREF="http://eq.guildmagic.com/character.cfm?ID=166138">Guild Magic Profile</A> <BR><A HREF="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=220056">Magelo Profile</A> <BR>Is buaine cliu na saoghal.<BR>"Reputation is more lasting than life."</p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/uwraithbaneofsnowfallon.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Wraithbane of Snowfallon</A> at: 7/24/02 1:06:03 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ukaeleth.showPublicProfile?language=EN>kaeleth</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 5<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(7/24/02 12:50:03 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2399.topic&index=17>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: How do you view your race?</span><hr size=1> Vah Shir are the most honorable race.
