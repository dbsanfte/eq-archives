Sightless sockets always staring emptily forwards as it bore a freshly written parchment sealed with black and red wax to denote the Noble House Black Oath. It's eerie grin chattered for a moment as the guard halted it's progress to take the offering from the slave.<br>
<br>
Winds kicked up, gusts of cool and warm to clash around the suddenly startled guards as they peered around and the bone servant was gone, leaving them only with the note. The flap flickered enticingly, and noting no one of rank around and the moment, the guard withdrew the invitation.<br>
<br>
The fresh crimson lettered card was lifted to his nose, senses reeling as the obvious copper tinge of blood was remarked. The bold words scrawled in a beautiful hand across the front.<br>

Ashraven tells hate:1, 'Other races hold that love is the source of such unions, and while the Teir'dal recognize the needs for such desires...'<br>
Ashraven tells hate:1, 'In truth it is the hatred of Innoruuk that drives us in our daily life.'<br>
Ashraven tells hate:1, 'Before I call upon the bindings of the Father, to have you vow to his name your intent....woudl you Xaizael Kel'Tah have any words to speak to your wife to be?'<br>

Ashraven grins mischievously and nods in encouragement to Ciennaa.<br>
Ciennaa tells hate:1, 'When we met, we were but children in the eyes of our God, and our family. Together our Hate and love has grown to boundaries I never expected. I believe he is proud, and stands to watch over us. His hand ever strong, ever sure, as is this bond I would willingly give to dos. My heart, soul, hand and life.'<br>

<br>
Ciennaa kisses Xaizael on the cheek.<br>
Xaizael beams a smile at Ciennaa.<br>
<br>
Ashraven tells the group,in Dark Elvish, '&lt;grins mischievously and whispers something along the line of &quot;already jumping to the end with the kisses&gt;'<br>
Ashraven tells hate:1, '&lt;grins mischeviously as Ciennaa steals an early kiss&gt; '<br>

Ciennaa tells hate:1, 'Eternally'<br>
<br>
Ashraven tells hate:1, 'If you have tokens to share of this moment, now is to do so while I prepare the final rite.'<br>
<br>
Xaizael starts to perspire ever so slightly.<br>
<br>
Ciennaa tells hate:1, '~Draws out a fine black enamaled box, and smiles as she peers up to him. Flipping the lid, nestled within black velvet lining lies Golden Charm of the Hopeful and Golden Fire Wedding Ring~'<br>
<br>
Xaizael tells hate:1, 'Regent Symbol of Innoruuk, Platinum Diamond Wedding Ring'<br>
<br>
Ashraven tells hate:1, '&lt;sets out  a simple white alabaster rose, a thick clay cup stained brown, and a long sharp kris knife as she notes that the gifts have been exchanged and placed upon each partner's fingers she motions for the couple to kneel before her&gt;'<br>
<br>

<br>
Xaizael tells hate:1, 'she is my foundation'<br>
<br>
Ciennaa tells hate:1, 'He, my protector'<br>
<br>
Ashraven tells hate:1, 'Ciennaa, place your hand palm upward above the cup.'<br>
Ashraven tells hate:1, 'your strength must keep his hand in place.'<br>
Ashraven tells hate:1, 'Xaizael, cover her hand with yours.  Your will must keep her from harm.'<br>
Ciennaa tells hate:1, '~Lifts her hand and flips it to hover palm upwards over the cup, peering between them quietly~'<br>
Xaizael tells hate:1, '~places his hand atop Ciennaa's~'<br>
Xaizael tells hate:1, '~Stares...eyes fixed on ciennaa~<br>
<br>
Ashraven tells hate:1, '&lt;Takes up the Kris knife, glance about the crowd...her eyelids half close and the smile on her lip smokey&gt; The Father has born us in pain.  Born us in blood.   Let this union be blessed in his name as his cup is filled.  &lt;On the last words, she plunges the kriss knife through both their hands till it &lt;tinks&gt; against the clay cup's bottom&gt;'<br>
Ashraven tells hate:1, '&lt;As the blood slowly fills the cup, Ashraven stands&gt; '<br>
<br>
Rorack gasps in astonishment.<br>
<br>
Ciennaa tells hate:1, '~Bites hard into her lip, hand trembling but holding fast as it holds up xaizael's atop it in a mold~'<br>
<br>
Mordrae stares at the couple, fidgeting a bit as she hears the blood trickle down.<br>
<br>
Xaizael tells hate:1, '~draws a ragged breath and hisses before composing hisself*'<br>
<br>
Naubol looks concerned.<br>
<br>
Abysinthe winces softly.<br>
<br>
Ashraven tells hate:1, '&lt;addresses the audience&gt; Those here gathered witness the mingling of blood between two of Innoruuk's children.   '<br>
<br>
Mordrae licks her teeth carefully, narrowing darkly glittering eyes.<br>
<br>
Delea stares in astonishment.<br>
<br>
Ashraven tells hate:1, 'If any here would see this cup turned over, speak now.   '<br>
You tell hate:1, '~Stares...eyes still fixed on ciennaa~<br>
<br>
Kiyda smiles at the sight of blood.<br>
<br>
Ashraven tells hate:1, 'Though fair warning &lt;a wicked grin across her lips&gt; They are allowed to dissagree quite vehemently.'<br>
<br>
Ciennaa tells hate:1, '~Peers at him in the same intensity of pain and pleasure at the scent of blood and the feel of the throbbing wound~'<br>
<br>
Ashraven tells hate:1, '&lt;looks to each person and waits for a response.....when she sees none....she nods&gt;'<br>
<br>
Xaizael tells hate:1, '~ Scarlet eyes peer into the cup and flare as the crimson pool shimmers~'<br>
<br>
Ashraven tells hate:1, 'Xaizael, and Ciennaa....this dagger marks more than your hands.  From here on now you will bear the scar of this joining.  It's pain a memory of one who wears its twin.'<br>
<br>
Ciennaa tells hate:1, '~Swallows hard and continues to brace his hand, pinned to her own~'<br>
Ashraven tells hate:1, '&lt;whispers a healing cantrip as she pulls the kris knife cleanly from their hands....the wounds sealing afterward with jagged scars&gt;'<br>
<br>
Xaizael tells hate:1, '~smiles as the Dagger is withdrawn~'<br>
<br>
Ciennaa tells hate:1, '~Issues a sigh of relief, and curls her fingers around his gently, drawing them to her lips for a kiss to the scar~'<br>
<br>
Ashraven tells hate:1, '&lt;takes the cup of mixed blood, brings the alabaster rose to the forefront and pours the thick liquid over the white rose.....the stone does not splatter but drinks the blood with thirsty desire&gt;'<br>
<br>
Lopothandilius thinks they should have put a stud through the hole before healing.<br>
<br>
Ashraven tells hate:1, 'This rose is a symbol of the passion, the hatred, and the pain that binds you.  This seal is a symbol of the marriage you have made.'<br>
Ashraven tells hate:1, 'Who will hold the seal? '<br>
<br>
Xaizael nods at Ashraven.<br>
<br>
Ciennaa glances to Abysinthe.<br>
<br>
Abysinthe steps forward slowly.<br>
<br>
Ashraven tells hate:1, 'Abysinthe your duty to these two is one of grave importance.'<br>
Ashraven tells hate:1, 'You must hold their welfare above your own.  You must be wise when they are driven by anger or passion.'<br>
<br>
Ciennaa tells hate:1, '~And everyone knows THAT wont ever happen. HAH~'<br>
<br>
Ashraven tells hate:1, 'You must keep this seal from any who would break it....even if it be them.   You will be the judge of it's final fate.'<br>
Ashraven tells hate:1, 'Do you accept this charge?'<br>
<br>
Abysinthe tells hate:1, '~nods slowly and reaches her hand out for that seal as she looks towards Ashraven~ I do...<br>
'<br>
Ashraven tells hate:1, 'Take....and flee.  Hide it from their enemies and from themselves. &lt;gives the seal of marriage to Abysinthe and smiles, turning to the crowd&gt;'<br>
<br>
Lopothandilius Begins to weep uncontrollably at the beauty of it all.<br>
<br>
Ashraven tells hate:1, 'These two are joined.  In the name of Innoruuk.  I declare them as one.  '<br>
Ashraven tells hate:1, 'You may kiss each other with all the passions you may muster.'<br>

Mordrae looks slightly startled, dark eyes glittering as they watch the fireworks.<br>
Ciennaa grins evilly at Xaizael.<br>
Ciennaa tells hate:1, 'I would like to take this moment, to thank everyone for their attendance, gifts, and most of all support. Lady Ashraven, a most excellent binding of Hate.'<br>
