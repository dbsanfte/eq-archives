I agree with Dreks.  I had the same idea.  If you put on your LFG flag, people should be able to see your level.  Maybe your class too.<br>
<br>
The only thing I would add to this is that I should be able to see all of the levels and classes of my fellow guild members.<br>
<br>
Language is only a problem if you let it be a problem.  If you take one hour and practice a language with someone (spam, zone, rinse and repeat)  you will have no problem conversing with someone.<br>
<br>
TLC is only a problem (for lower level quests) if you let it be a problem.  If I need a low level quest item because I didn't get it the first time around, I would create a PC quest with the goal being a bounty for the quest item.  For example, if I need to get Master Whoopall's head, I can create a bounty for the first person willing to go and separate Whoopall's head from his shoulders.  The other player gets cash or an item and I get the head.  I have a feeling this scenario is the basis for removing NO DROP on most items on FV.<br>
<br>
I have had a few characters on other servers.  FV is by far the best server.  The d00ds don't stick around here because the ruleset isn't &quot;easy&quot;.  Good, let'em go.  Create a character on another server and go sit in EC for ten minutes and you'll camp out and come back to FV.<br>

I think it would be very wrong to believe that those that leave are mostly &quot;d00dz&quot;. <br>
Actually, I think there are players of all kinds that leave the FV server, but mostly, I would imagine most of those are casual players. With the current rules in place, it makes it close to impossible for the casual player, if he or she is not in a big guild that is around when he/she is, or if he/she brings her own group when starting on the server.<br>
<br>
A damn shame if you ask me, since as most of you have already found out, FV is a server with a high percentage of mature and nice (role)players.<br>
<br>
(By the way, I am one of those people that started at day 1, but left after reaching level 20, due to the current rules. I am still lurking on the boards, though, since I hope the situation will improve one day, so I can re-activate my account.) <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/uimogenelddar.showPublicProfile?language=EN>ImogenElddar</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 67<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(1/20/02 6:15:47 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1151.topic&index=21>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: The server is dying... slowly but surely</span><hr size=1> &lt;&lt;IMHO, if FV was turned into a normal blue server, we wouldn't see a huge inrush of &quot;farming d00ds&quot;. &gt;&gt;<br>
<br>
I do wish you were right, but I fear that you aren't.<br>
<br>
If and when Verant does feel that this server is &quot;dying&quot; (and their idea of dying will probably be &quot;unprofitable&quot;), I'm sure that they will do something.  My guess is, they will take a single step towards making FV a normal server.  In other words, I predict that FV will drop ONE of the rules.  Probably either TLC or forced /role.  <br>
<br>
Verant won't admit that they are doing it out of desperation, either.  They will claim (with some honesty) that they are doing what they were asked to do by the players. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/urobingoodfellow.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Robin Goodfellow</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 80<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(1/20/02 6:53:49 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1151.topic&index=22>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: The server is *NOT* dying... slowly *OR* surely</span><hr size=1> I agree with Valquiss.  I don't believe the &quot;server is dying&quot;.  I'm not at all sure how you'd evaluate that, anyway.<br>
<br>
There are throngs of people in Kelethin all the time now, and the number is pretty much the same stable number it was when I first started in October: about 60-70 during the weekends, about 40 on weekdays, about 20 at night.<br>
<br>
What is different, however, are the hordes of people in the low-to-mid-level dungeons.  Crushbone regularly has 20-30 people in it--it only has fewer if someone's trained DVinn to the zone and he's slaughtered everyone.<br>
<br>
When I spent time in Blackburrow, there were generally more people running around than gnolls except very, very late at night.<br>
<br>
I don't think &quot;the server is dying&quot;.  I think people are levelling slowly, like myself, partly in order not to miss out on quests that otherwise might TLC.  Or because they're &quot;casual gamers&quot;, like myself.<br>
<br>
I suspect that, to people in their 40s, yeah, it looks like the server is dead because there are very few people up there, relatively speaking.  However, the wave is coming.  The people in Crushbone/Blackburrow/etc now will be moving into their 20s soon, and there are a lot of them.<br>
<br>
Also, Sullon Zek hasn't been shut down.  I don't think there is, as of yet, any precendence that indicates VI will shut either server down.  They fit a &quot;niche-market&quot; that VI wants to attract--after all, how many people here have said they'd completely quit the game if it weren't for FV?<br>

That's the only zone in the game with both a portal and /auction.  It will *always* be a gathering spot no matter how low the server population gets.<br>
<br>
We definitely loose a lot of players.  Personally, I think there are only two rules that actually make even a token effort at supporting RP: the language changes and the alignments.  Both have very poor implementations, though.  The entire ruleset simply ammounts to an extra hurdle.  If you're an experienced player, you can probably overcome it -- or at least you won't quit too early, since you know what you're up against from the start.<br>
<br>
Examples:<br>
<br>
TLC -- not RP.  Just makes quests *extremely* difficult or even impossible if you don't read the spoiler sites.<br>
<br>
/roleplay -- not RP.  It means I have to ask and am asked class/level constantly.  I'd prefer conversations to not require game mechanics in the first hello.<br>
<br>
No /ooc or /auc, /yell-range /auc and /shout -- not RP.  RP is handled entirely through communication.  Limitted communication means limitted RP (and you can always turn off /occ, /auc, or /shout if they bother you).<br>
<br>
Languages -- RP on one side, communication limitting on the other.  Should have been done just with NPCs, not PCs.<br>
<br>
Alignment -- RP, but with bad implemenation that limits player creativity.  Should have been done wide open, but with faction consequences; eg. inky can go &quot;good&quot;, but if he does, Neriak/etc. become KoS.<br>
<br>
I could go on and on about how the ruleset really doesn't do anything but make things harder.  It doesn't support RP because Verant never defined what RP was when they went out to support it.  They seem to have just added a bunch of odd restrictions to force folks into small narrow niches.  RP is about creativity and your own storyline, not about marching in step with the NPCs. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/urobingoodfellow.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Robin Goodfellow</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 85<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(1/21/02 2:06:30 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1151.topic&index=24>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: You can't ..</span><hr size=1> I'm not judging &quot;just by Greater Faydark.&quot;<br>

<br>
I'm judging by my experiences in Highpass, where there's almost always two full groups, one on either end.<br>
<br>
I'm judging by my experiences in the East Commonlands, where there were 20-some people there at 3:00 a.m. my time last night.<br>
<br>
Yes, some of zones have fewer people than others, but I think patience will reveal that the server is thriving, in spite of what the doomsayers think (or desire).<br>

I do think TLC has really brought a negative show so to speak as it applies to questing and what not. That I think is bad. Honestly I think the altruistic fix is just to make all magic items no drop and do what they did at release; have lore tags only on all items which were involved in the quests. Those that like loot still get loot, and those that love questing can still go and quest. For that matter, we can still multiquest as well. Think of it from the table top aspect. Magic items should be something special somewhat, worrying about an economy in a role playing game is just out and out wrong.<br>
<br>
The Alignment system just isn't working. Goods and evils just don't belong together in guilds and groups. Think about it from the table top viewpoint which this server was meant to emulate. Paladin X groups with Necromancer X. In a tablerop setting I guarantee you one of the two would be rolling up new characters not long into the first adventure.<br>
<br>
I see and here about people leaving the server consistantly. As much as I hate to say it, I see it. I waited, I watched, and even after Luclin...people continue to go.<br>
<br>
This server needs some changes if its going to really survive long term. As much as I hate to say it, if there aren't changes made and made vocally so...I only see the server continuing on its residual decline. And the longer they wait to make the fixes (if they do), the worse its going to get.<br>
<br>
The idealologies that went into the server are absolutely wonderful. The applications of such however, just isn't equitable math.  <p>Banegrivm Shadowblight<br>Sovereign Lord of the <a href=http://www.1stfistoflight.com>1st Fist of Light</a><br>Firiona Vie</p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/umaladominus.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Maladominus</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 13<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(1/21/02 6:24:35 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1151.topic&index=28>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: SoL</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr>   Personally, I think that the population of the server is much less because of the amount of people that can't run EQ any more because after the Shadows of Luclin update their computers aren't up to scratch any more.

Bingo! <br>
<br>
All other theories aside.... 2 more additional reasons why all server populations may be slightly lower:  <br>
<br>
#1. Luclin expansion = players having a hell of a time getting logged on after the expansion gave them all sorts of technical problems <br>
<br>
#2. People are trying out the OTHER MMORPGs like Dark Age of Camelot, which means they cannot be playing EQ and those other games at the same time, can they? <br>
<br>
Time trying out new MMORPGs = Time away from EQ <br>
<br>
simple equation <br>

The people that I know that are leaving the server are:<br>
a) People that joined this server for a challenge (They want to become uber first, not roleplay)<br>
b) Farmers who thought they could get rich because of lower population<br>
c) d00ds who like showing off their uber gear, but can not shout about how uber they are because the language and limited shout range<br>
d) People whose computers could not handle the Luclin expansion (We have had a number of these in our guild)<br>
<br>
     I believe this server is doing well for the people it was designed for. People who like to roleplay, casual gamers who dislike the crowds and want to see the sights that are always camped on other servers and older players who can never understand d00ds. Now this does not mean RP at all times, but as a matter of practice.<br>
     I do see a problem with the 40+ group though. They all leveled so fast that a gap formed between them and the rest of the server. Alot of them came with ready formed guilds and power leveled their way to the top. Then when FV did not meet their expectations they left and there is not enough mid-level people to fill their shoes.<br>
     My guild, which started about week 3 of this server, is doing well with our leadership group in the mid 20's, even more teens and a few in their 30's. We are growing at a slow and measured pace like we want to keep that family atmosphere. There is almost always someone to group with in our level ranges, but it is rarely over-camped which is nice. Sometimes it can seem there is not enough people in your range because alot of people are busy running quests and things instead of grouping. This has happened to me before where I run a quest one night and the next a person I usually group with is doing the same.<br>
     I like the closeness of this server, the slower pace and the feeling that you know most of the people around you. I always know some of the people I run past on the way from FP to Qeynos, on my old server I never did. Leave the server the way it is. I see it as a fine wine, it will just get better as it ages.<br>

You have to be flexible, you have to be willing to run across continents and take the boats and not rely on others to come to you.  In essence? You really have to try here......<br>
