It’s a sort of pointless absurdity, given the situation.  You shouldn’t really give a damn, but you do.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>“I miss you”</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
Three truer words have never been spoken.  Everyone knows them, all known their true meaning.  I always have and now...  I do not know how long it will linger. Maybe forever.  Maybe not.  I can not tell.<br>
<br>
I knew you for a long time.  I knew you so well that I felt as if you were a part of me.  I felt divinely right when I…  When we both relegated it to being all little more than a memory, but I have been made desolate by your loss.  I am forever wounded, although I would never admit it so, more profoundly than I can ever hope to say in such a pathetic way as the spoken word.<br>
<br>
When it ended, I did not know what to think.  I am free – that was one of them.  Yet I am not, when I think about it.  I am forever chained to you, and I shall never again be able to lose myself as I did to you.  They are thoughts and responsibilities that a man should ever be burdened with really, yet here I am.  Maybe the chain will break, given time.  You are not similarly chained to my memory, however.  You never were.  You refused it so, and I guess that’s your advantage.<br>
<br>
Of all the days in my life, never have I felt more helpless.  I felt cut off.  Small.  Conversation had turned to accusation.  Accusation had turned to proclamation.  Word after searing word had burned our ties as we both lost sight of all reason and realism, each sticking to our ideals and our swords.  We both did, and that is the truth of it.  Finally, the final link burned and that profound slavery began.<br>
<br>
And here I am.  You are gone, and so am I.  We lost each other that day into a pointless abyss.  I won’t accuse you of anything.  I won’t repeat the same mistake twice, I refuse to.  My way is my own, and it was never yours.<br>
<br>
“And that is what you were missing all along, my friend.”<br>
<br>
The sword’s quiet voice had eased it’s way into my reverie.  The word slowly leaked back into view, the gentle breeze running across my neck and through my hair.  Just as she had done.  North Karana was the place of my love, my life, and eventually, my slavery.  Strangely, that was never your intention.<br>
<br>
I turned vaguely focused eyes upon my eternal companion, the sometimes arrogant, but always kind dragon spirited blade of fire, which sat floating at my side, its flickering golden aura coursing into the washy golden form of a great winged dragon.  Xotal spoke gently, his aura moving as if it were a true dragon.  “Bakanome,” he said, “you know this was inevitable, from the first moment she tried to constrain you to her ideals.<br>
<br>
I gazed out over the river, and the sword respectfully moved to away, gazing its ethereal golden head out over towards the mud banks of the great body of water.  “You know what it was she did to you.  I should never have let it happen, and I am sorry I did.”<br>
<br>
I remained silently, letting the final remnant of my doting slip away into the void.  I caught the first flickers of sun rise threatening to wash away the darkness that encompassed these lands at night.  I glanced over my shoulder.  “Looks like dawn’s picking up, Xotal.”<br>
<br>
A wave of relief seemed to ease over his features, and he nodded slowly.  I noted almost absently that he seemed to be gaining huge amounts of control over his aura these days.  “If I remember the way that the sun moves right, if we set off for Nektulos now, we will make it there by dawn tomorrow morning.”<br>
<br>
I nodded as well, picking myself up out of the grass, which glistened slightly with morning dew.  “We’ll move out then.  We’ll need to gather our forces together, and finally bring daylight to that accursed forest.”  I felt a grin form on my face, and I laughed just a little despite the seriousness of the situation.  “Oh it does feel good to have a purpose again Xotal.  Yes it does.”<br>
<br>
Onto Nektulos we went, and it’s city of darkness, pain, lies, and death.<br>

I'd gather my soul, coalesce my thoughts and try to put them all into words that made sense, but they never seemed to anyway.  That's the problem with silly things like words.  They usually ended up seeming to say things I never meant to, so lots of times I tried just being quiet instead.  Sometimes it helped, sometimes it didn't...<br>
<br>
I never could quite express how I wanted you to be free from bindings, not bind you to ways that aren't on your path.  It's why I always felt bad that you wanted things I couldn't give you, worshipped in a way I never could.  I wanted us to help each other learn how to open our eyes wider to see things more clearly, but so often it seemed we couldn't even see the same things to begin with.  I didn't want to just turn your head to what I saw, and I never knew how to describe it...<br>
<br>
I still can't explain why I felt you needed to go.  I don't even know why I'm trying to explain it to myself now, unless there's still that spark of you inside who will sometimes turn to me with questions.  I wish I could give you the answers you need, or even just the ones you're looking for.  It would help me feel like I can still give you something greater than the freedom to give to yourself.  That part of each other that pledged 'forever' will forever be sealed inside of us, but I feel it locked away now in your darkest corner, waiting, wishing...<br>
<br>
I hope you do your part for the world, and I hope it's easier for you without worrying about trying not to worry who else may be treasured within my heart, and why I value them the way I do.  I hope you never succumb to another god trying to control you, and I hope if you choose to anyway, that I can simply let your choice be.  I hope when your work is all done, your spirit will be free, and we can talk again about how things change.  I hope if there's ever another way I can help you, I hope you'll let me help.  <br>
<br>
I hope...</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
Kimaya let her thoughts trail off into a swirl of colors and images beyond the description of words, lost in the flowing flood of feeling and impressions of gifts now past, gifts unopened and gifts she'd never be allowed to give.  After an unmeasured moment, she let this flood flow past her, into the sea, where it may merge with all the other dreams and possibilities that had yet to be brought ashore.<br>
<br>
She looked down into her hand to ponder the small, rosy shell she had clasped into her lap as her mind was occupied, sealing the thoughts, hopes and memories within.  She then reached out and let it slip into the water, wishing that it may perhaps find its way to her 'nuzzles' someday, perhaps may speak again to his soul, or perhaps even simply rest with Prexus as another treasure forever lost at sea.  And again, as always, she wasn't sure which should be true, and was glad it wasn't her choice to make.<br>
<br>
She nodded to the waves as they crashed upon the shore, then whispered the words that would call out her Kazzybear.  Soon, little elf and bear feet had scampered down the beach, leaving nothing but faint shifts in the pattern of the sand. <p><p align="center">
