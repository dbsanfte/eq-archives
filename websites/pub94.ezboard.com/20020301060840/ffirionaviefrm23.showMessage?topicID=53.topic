My nerves were more than frayed. I was sent by the Tier'Dal to map out Luclin for them and to report back about any life and possible allies. It was quite a task. The closest teleporter was in the Elven capital, right past their allies, the dwarves, right inside some dark, confusing forest. Now, the problem with me and the forest is the fact that some of the elves want to live in trees, which was a fifth direction for me to watch. The other four were front, back, left, and right. <br><br>Don't get me wrong. The reward heavily outweighed the difficulties. Not only would I go down in Tier'Dal history, but if life on Luclin could help us defeat the tree-freaks, I would be more than a hero. I'd be living it up in riches. More than enough for me to retire at this young age in luxury. Along with that, I was in charge of a small group of Crushbone Orcs to meet me along the way. There were five of them. I can't remember all of their names, as they were just a series of primal grunts that I wouldn't dare sacrifice my dignity to pronounce. I called the leader Laranis, as Laranis was the name of a thief back home who tried to break an associate out of the Necromancer's dungeon. In the end, he accidentally locked himself into a cell and was slowly tortured to death. Moron. <br><br>&quot;Ten minutes until the teleportation to Luclin commences!&quot; The scion announced once more. <br><br>I've still got time to kill. Let me try and remember the rest of my story. I was able to get to Freeport easily. A few platinum coins and shiny objects and those Militia men are more than happy to guard somewhere else besides the docks, and to buy me a set of clothes. I changed my outfit in an inn, so my dark skin was hidden, including all of my face. I felt so naked without my hidden sheaths, I nearly bungled it all. I could only successfully keep one hidden, and that was in the small of my back. I boarded the ship, and set sail. I went down into the hull of it, and sat down at the bar. It was close to empty. A dirty little tree-elf was sitting on the opposite side, and a human was behind the bar. &quot;What'll ya have?&quot; The human said. His breath wreaked like a typical human's.<br><br>&quot;Water,&quot; I grunted out, trying to sound like one of his kind.<br><br>He looked at me funny, then poured a drink. It was warm, as I figured it would be. Spells to create ice are expensive, and from the creaks and groans of the ship, I could tell that money was more than a problem. About a minute later, the tree-elf noticed me and moved down next to me. &quot;Where are you headed?&quot; He said in his high-pitched voice. I had been taught some Elvish before I had been sent on my journey. Enough to get by.<br><br>&quot;To Luclin,&quot;I said in my gruffest voice.<br><br>&quot;Oh,&quot; The tree-elf said, then some other queer speech I couldn't understand. <br><br>I paused for a moment. &quot;I know what you mean,&quot; I said. I was trying to be as vague as possible.<br><br>The conversation continued on like that, with me humoring him. I picked up a few phrases, about him guiding me to the portals. I kept trying to say no, but he insisted. I remembered I needed to blend in, so I finally agreed, reluctantly. I said I needed to stop by a &quot;scarred tree&quot;. The tree-elf prattled something on about orcs, but this time it was my turn to insist. He agreed, but seemed a bit spooked.<br><br> <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/uvallshadowstrife.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Vall Shadowstrife</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 29<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(1/11/02 10:35:18 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm23.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=53.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: A day in the life of a scout of Luclin</span><hr size=1> We talked (Well, he talked to me while I nodded), and then reached land. As we got off the ship, he said something unimportant, then said to follow. I followed behind him. As we were about to leave the docks, we were stopped by Dwarven customs. I knew nothing of their droll language, but they attempted to question me. They gestured to me, and poked at my clothing. I tightened up, and prepared to draw my dagger and kill one of them. There was no way I could take them all on in a fair fight, though. Fortunatly, the idiot elf covered for me. We continued on, and soon came to the forests. I could feel adrenaline rushing through my veins as I knew a fight was about to arise.<br><br>The dirt-elf must have sensed my nervousness, and asked me what was wrong. He said something about my clothing, then surprised me and pulled off my veil. His eyes widened in fear as he realized my race. I think I smirked, as his terror was so entertaining. I shoved him against a tree and kneed him in the crotch. With my forearm I held his chest against the tree and drew out my dagger. He opened his mouth to scream, but no sound came out. I had rammed my dagger through his throat, which impaired his ability to speak. And live.<br><br>I had recieved instructions on how to reach the scarred tree as part of my briefing, and it took me only a few minutes to get my barings. I conjured up my memory of the map I had shown, and within a few minutes had reached the tree. The five of them surrounded the tree and were looking out in all directions. <br><br>&quot;Hail,&quot; I said.<br><br>&quot;Praises to Innoruuk, God of All Gods!&quot; An orc said.<br><br>&quot;Praises to Innoruuk, for he will empower you and I,&quot; I replied, completing the code phrase so we recognized each other. I had to resist rolling my eyes. I don't worship any gods, as I don't believe in any of them. No one has ever seen them, except in 'visions' and other trash. Priests and the like were only channeling magic in another fashion that healed. I especially despised Innoruuk, as the belief in him had turned my race into fanatics. If my kin hadn't been worked up into a frenzy and spent their time sacrificing each other for some dellusion, we would have conquered the elves already.<br><br>&quot;Who's the leader of this pack?&quot; I said in their language. I had been taught it until I knew it fluently.<br><br>&quot;I am,&quot; Another orc said, stepping forward. &quot;I am...&quot; He then said his name, which I won't embarass myself to repeat, and introduced his friends.<br><br>&quot;No, you're not. From now until I leave this group, I am the leader. You'll be called Laranis. I don't care about the rest of your little followers. How far to the portal?&quot;<br><br>The orc looked surprise for a moment, then quickly recovered, &quot;Six miles.&quot;<br><br>&quot;All right. That should take a couple hours. When we're half a mile away, I'll continue on alone.&quot; <br><br>The orc nodded, and we marched on through the bushes. The orcs told me of their skirmishes with the tree-elves, and how they had fled into the trees. They then explained that they had made an outpost near their village, and were being set back there. They also detailed how they planned to hack down the trees and knock the tree village down. I stopped walking for a moment and boggled at the stupidity of the orcs. <br><br>&quot;Why don't you imbeciles just set the trees on fire? It's less work, there's no nearby large source of water, and it'll be unstoppable.&quot; <br><br>It caught the orcs off guard, and they stopped walking for a moment. They then exchanged glances with each other, and started walking again. They didn't try to talk to me again. A little more time passed, and the orcs stopped again.<br><br>&quot;We're here,&quot; The orc grunted, &quot;Follow this path, and you should reach the spires.&quot;<br><br>I nodded, and began to slowly stalk through the brush. I began to blend in with my surroundings, and slowly fade in. I saw a few patrols of orcs going by, which I snuck by for the fun of it. I also snuck past a troop of dirt-elves. <br><br>&quot;One minute to teleportation!&quot; The scion yelled out once again. I must have missed her other announcements. <br><br>Where was I? Oh, yes, I was just sneaking to the spires. Well, I crept past some dirt-elves. I realized the scion was one of those, heh, fancier dirt-elves, the one who stole our secrets of magic. I put my back against a spire, and waited, listening to her. I listened to her counting of the minutes, until she finally yelled, &quot;TELEPORTATION TO LUCLIN IS BEGINNING!&quot; I leaped into the center of the spires, and was instantly teleported. <br><br>I've been teleported a few times before, and I hate it. The uneasiness, the way that your fate rests in some crazed magic-user's hands, who could easily send you to some place you won't survive more than a minute in. Suffice to say, it gets me sick. The teleport to Luclin was different than the others. I could feel my dissolving into tiny pieces, and rushing to the sky. Gravity had no effect on me, I was free, yet confined to a certain corpse. I then felt the gravity of Luclin, and my body coming back together.<br><br>I stumbled for a moment as I reached Luclin. I felt dizzy, then sick. I vomitted on the ground, and rubbed my stomach. I leaned against a wall for a moment, until I recovered my bearings. I then looked around to see if anyone saw what I had done. No one seemed to be around me. The whole area was pretty empty. Now, it was time to explore.<br><br>To be continued. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/uvallshadowstrife.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Vall Shadowstrife</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 41<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(1/13/02 3:57:49 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm23.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=53.topic&index=2>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: A day in the life of a scout of Luclin</span><hr size=1> If there was a time I was more nervous than now, I certainly can't think of it. I took a look around the room, and realized I was underground. The area was so big, I couldn't even see the ceiling. I looked around, and realized someone must have wanted travellers to be impressed. I certainly was. <br><br>I was atop a raised platform. Four stairways led down, one to the north, another to the south, and two others leading to the west and east. In front of me I could see a tunnel, and when I squinted my eyes hard enough, I spied a human guard and a half-elf. In back of me, and to my left and right were tunnels leading off, too. I finally closed my mouth from awe, and snapped out of my hypnotic state. <br><br>&quot;Welcome to the Nexus,&quot; A voice said behind me. <br><br>I jumped and spun around, only to spy a pale-elf smiling at me. I stepped back at my left foot and felt my dagger in the small of my back, underneath my cloak. Before I could draw it, however, the pale-elf spoke again.<br><br>&quot;You seem lost. Can I help you?&quot; She said again. <br><br>Warily, I said, &quot;I'm looking for the closest city. Where is it?&quot;<br><br>&quot;That way,&quot; She pointed to past me, to the tunnel I had just been looking at, &quot;leads to a teleporter that goes to Shadow Haven. It's basically a gigantic marketplace, with a few inns. Only merchants of Shadow Haven live there permanently. If you travel a ways off, you'll reach Shar Vahl. There--&quot; <br><br>&quot;What the hell is Shar Vahl?&quot; I interrupted.<br><br>&quot;It's the city of the Vah Shir.&quot; She saw my look of confusion, and carried on. &quot;The Vah Shir are a large, cat-like race. They're covered in fur, and are strong enough to break you in two if you cause any trouble...assuming, of course, they don't decide to skin you with their claws.&quot; She smiled sweetly at me. I bowed slightly and restrained myself.<br><br>&quot;Thank you very much, m'lady.&quot; <br><br>I turned, and headed out torwards Shadow Haven. Logic deduced that all races must have been treated equally here, which seemed a bit odd. As I passed the guards, they looked me over, then returned to their conversations. Guess they weren't expecting too much trouble. <br><br>I reached the teleporter, and glanced around. I took a deep breath, then stepped on. Colors swirled all around me, then I was within an ivory-colored city. I was in the middle of a small pool of water, on a small platform. To my left and right branched out little bridges, to walkways. I continued on.<br><br>I looked around the entire city, taking notes of popular and notable areas. I even stopped in a few shops, mostly for some sewing supplies. I bought a needle and thread, along with a new, heavy cloak, and some fabric. The area had some places divided into little quarters, where certain races and such stuck together, such as the short quarter, and the human quarter. I decided to stay away from them, as they didn't seem too friendly. <br><br>I stopped by an inn, one with a bar in the bottom and rooms upstairs. I sat down at the bar, and listened to surrounding patrons and drunks talk about what they had seen. I learned a great deal. Nearby was a bazaar, where people could sell goods, with no questions asked. I made a strong mental note, as I could easily set up a few fences there to get rid of stolen goods. I also heard a few stories about Shar Vahl, and the caverns that I would need to get through to get to there. The trip was going to be tough. <br><br>It grew late. At least, it felt late. I went upstairs to my room, and locked the door. I began working on my new cloak. I sewed in some catches, extra pockets, and sheathes to hold weapons and hide goods. It took me a while, but I finished with a superb cloak. Not only would it keep me warm, but I should be able to walk around fully armed without anyone noticing.  Afterwards, I laid down and went to sleep. <p>[b]Vall Shadowstrife<BR>Tier'Dal Scout of Luclin <BR>Agent of The Ring <BR>"The Gods are two inches up my nose."-Gnomish Philosopher from Dragonlance [/b]</p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/utresjoli.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Tresjoli</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.shadow-striders.com/images/wolfIcon.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 7<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(1/17/02 2:10:20 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm23.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=53.topic&index=3>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.cpinternet.com/~theduke/MythStuff/ez-tres.gif  WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: A day in the life of a scout of Luclin</span><hr size=1> /ooc<br><br>Very nicely written.

I ask myself, &quot;What's there for me to do? Would it really make that much of a difference if I just stayed in bed?&quot; I asked myself that that morning, and I was easily able to say, &quot;Yes.&quot;<br><br>The race was on. My mission had changed. I was to reach Shar Vahl before the dirt elves did, and convince the Vah Shir that the dirt elves were evil. Hopefully, that would hold things over until an ambassador could arrive. How the hell I would contact my home and give the signal for an ambassador to arrive is a different story.<br><br>I rolled out of bed and dressed myself. I was torn between stopping at a nearby market, called the Bazaar, and continuing on my adventure. On the one hand, I might be able to get a decent price on some goods. On the other, I might lose the race and fail miserably. Where I come from, decent prices are once-in-a-lifetime occurance. <br><br>I browsed the Bazaar. I walked past the guards with all my weapons hidden within my new cloak, and they didn't seem to even notice. I bought a potion that promised to bring me home upon drinking it, and another that would speed up my healing process. Normal healing spells don't work on me, for some reason.<br><br>I then began my way torwards what's called &quot;Paludal Caverns&quot;. I heard I was to be wary of the walls of the cavern, and there were fierce creatures inside. I entered the caverns through Shadow Haven. They were damp, and mold was growing all over the place.<br><br>I crept through, taking heed of some of the cautions. I could have gone faster, and I could have gone slower. It was then that I saw these creatures of legend. Suffice to say, I immediatly began creeping as slowly as I could. The creatures were about my height. It's hard to describe them, but they stood on two legs, and had short arms. They looked like they may have been scaled, but it was hard to tell. They did look quite ferocious, however.<br><br>I'll spare you most of the details, but I managed to get through the caverns unharmed. I mostly used trial and error, and luck must have been smiling on me that day because I got through quite easily. I got to see daylight for the first time in a long while then. It was at the end of the tunnel that I first saw it. I stopped sneaking and ran at full speed and took a gasp of the air. I looked up into the sky to see where the sun was, but failed. The sun wasn't in the sky, yet it was still light out. Instead, I saw my home planet. I felt a tinge of homesickness deep inside me, longing to return to my nice, comfy bed and sleep away the day, but I knew I had to carry on.<br><br>I took a survey of my surroundings. A road led out from the tunnels and into a horizon of rolling hills. I began following it, and could feel that my journey was almost over. I took that time to gather my thoughts, and organize what I was going to say, but my thoughts instead decided  to run off.<br><br>Did you know that in some languages, the word &quot;erudite&quot; means learned? It was pretty cocky for those Erudites to suddenly consider themselves learned and name their entire race after it. <br><br>Race. R-a-c-e. That was E-c-a-r backwards. Ecar sort of sounds like scar. I have a few of those. Scars, not ecars, that is. I got one from when I assassinated a Haughty Elf official in that human city, Freeport. I don't remember her name, but I know it was something with a S, maybe a Sh sound. She was headed off to High Pass, and she had an armed guard that were dressed up in full, plate armor. I knew where she was going, and all about her guard. I formulated a plan, a good one, too. I killed one of her guards when he was alone with a fast-acting poison during the night. They were staying the night in Freeport, and then setting off for High Pass in the day, then camping out in the western part of the Commons for the night. In the morning, they were going to set out through Kithicor Forest.<br><br>I brought in a friend, who adjusted the plate armour so that I could wear it, yet it would make me look as tall as a Haughty Elf. He also gave me a sword, just like the one her guard used, that was made of a lighter material. The next day, I set out with her guard. I'll spare you the details, but I grew impatient and buried my sword through the back of her neck, through her spine. Unfortunatly, her armored guard was all around me. I quickly ripped off my breastplate and plate greaves, and began running, as fast as I could, torwards Neriak. I knew that they wouldn't be able to keep up in their armor. One of them, the one closest to me, managed to hit me in the back. I didn't feel it at the time as there was too much adrenaline flowing through me. As I sped off, they all slowed down, and eventually gave up chase. I returned home, and accepted my pay. Of course, I didn't tell them how careless I was.<br><br>A huge, castle-like structure lay in front of me now. Several large, cat-like creatures stood in front of it, with weapons. They tried not to stare at me, but couldn't help it.

He was big, and furry, but I suppose you could describe all of the Vah Shir like that. His fur was dark in color, and covered in spots. I held back obvious remarks.<br><br>&quot;Merciful guard, I am here to warn your king of the incoming plight! There are certain parties that wish to bring down the walls of this magnificent city!&quot; <br><br>The guard studied me for a moment, and I wondered if I laid it on too thickly. <br><br>&quot;Follow me. N'gyor, watch the gates.&quot;<br><br>I did as I was told, and was led through the city. I took in the sights, and the Vah Shir took in the sight of me. There was much whispering and much more giggling. I must have looked annoyed and must have looked more intimidating, as people stopped giggling. We reached the palace, and I was patted down. They asked me to disarm myself, and I handed over several shurikens, a few throwing daggers, and one of my good daggers. I still had another knife hidden in my left boot, and two more throwing daggers hidden in the right one. My potions were carefully under my armpits in seperate vials. <br><br>I was now in the company of three guards. The one I met outside the gate entered the palace, and I was kept in the watchful company of the two others. They tried not to stare, but they also failed miserably. It was a few more minutes, then the original guard returned. I was granted immediate appearance before the king, probably because they considered it rude to keep me waiting. <br><br>I was led into the palace by the three guards. The original stood in front of me, and the other two flanked me. The entire palace seemed like it was created to be more defensive than impressive. A wall surrounded the entire building and there were no windows. There weren't too many decorations besides the occasional tapestry hanging down from here or there.<br><br>I was caught up in looking around and didn't notice the original guard stopped. I walked right into his back. He went down onto one knee suddenly, as did the other two. The throne room wasn't as ornate as it could have been. A throne sat against a back wall, with a Vah Shir woman sitting to the right of it, from my view. To the left was an advisor, and all along the walls were armored men and advisors. <br><br>&quot;GRAB HIM!&quot; Someone cried out from behind me. I turned around and spied a Haughty Elf. To his left was some sort of robed magic-user, and to his right was someone decked out in armor. I suddenly felt a massive paw grab my shoulder. I turned around and, as hard as I could, kicked, hoping that Vah Shir had testicals in the same places other humanoids did. I hit armor, but also home, as signalled by a loud yelp. I stepped out from the triangle the guards had around me. The magic-user was making funny gestures which meant he was casting a spell. I didn't appreciate people fighting back, so I bent over, drew a throwing dagger, and rolled. I threw the dagger and it went in, blade first. That stopped him. By now everyone had at least drawn there weapons. It didn't look like diplomacy was going to get me out of here.<br><br>It was then that I felt cold steel burrow itself in my left arm. I suddenly remembered my regeneration potion, which then made me remember my take-me-home potion. I began sprinting away, and drew out my regeneration potion with my right arm from under my right armpit, which was not as easy as it sounded. I drank it. A minute later I began feeling hungry, which meant it was already taking effect. I sped up more and ran to a nearby room, sealing the door behind me. <br><br>&quot;Who-who-who are you?&quot; A feminine voice said. I turned and realized it was a Vah Shir girl, who had been sleeping.<br><br>&quot;A ghost,&quot; I replied, hastily gulping down my Take-Me-Home potion. She stared at me. BANG BANG BANG! went the door as the guard's swords sliced into it. It was then that I felt my body being sucked away, and knew the potion was beginning to work. I took a deep breath and prepared to loose my lunch upon my arrival home. Better than my life, I suppose. <p>Vall Shadowstrife<BR>Tier'Dal Scout of Luclin <BR>Agent of The Ring <BR>"I thought I saw my own worst enemy, a kind of demon.
