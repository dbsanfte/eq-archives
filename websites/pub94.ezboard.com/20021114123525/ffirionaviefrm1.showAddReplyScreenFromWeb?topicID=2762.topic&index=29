First of all, only a very idiotic game designer would make such an extreme change to the state of the world as to invalidate peoples' roleplay.  However, I do not even necessarily see how the &quot;extreme change&quot; that you use an example would be any more hindering to roleplay than a completely static world.  Alliances shift, moods change, new things happen.  Roleplaying a dark elf or high elf who clings to old prejudgices and holds old grudges, while the rest of his/her society is moving towards a more cooperative and accepting attitude, would still be a <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>  completely</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> valid character to roleplay and in many ways it could only but open more oppurtunities and scenarios for you to enjoy as a roleplayer.

However the real thrust of that change (which I agree would take a complete imbecile in game design ) was that it forced a direction of change upon players that might not suit large numbers of them. I can think of many who would feel uncomfortable with large scale changes and making the majority of your paying customers uncomfortable in order to stimulate the few is  poor business.<br>
<br>
And there I am afraid is your larger problem. We struggle to keep RP alive on FV, one of 20+ servers. The blue server population would have screaming fits if Freeport disappeared or the like. It is bad enough if they change a spawn rate, let alone dispense with it altogether. If there were a growing number of RP-preferred servers then our constituency would be greater for such changes. Heck, they couldn't even keep &quot;dynamic events&quot; going on SH and they had folks paying extra for them. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/utukka.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Tukka</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 203<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(9/25/02 1:48:03 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2762.topic&index=31>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.atlantic.net/~tukka/glowhand.jpg height=44 width=44></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Carthage</span><hr size=1> Well, my basic argument is that EverQuest was designed with little heed or consideration given to roleplay.  I think this is evident in zone design, character design, the game's backstory, the nature of scripted events, the nature of quests and the way the game has been marketed.<br>
<br>
People don't care about roleplay in large part because the game was not designed for roleplayers.  Even people who are inclined to roleplay (such as myself) have pretty much given up on it in EverQuest.<br>
<br>
As far as I'm concerned, there is very little they can do to improve the climate for RP without alienating the bulk of their customer base.  The original question posed was why people feel EQ lacks a coherant narrative, and I guess my answer is that the narrative that we all experience in the form of quests and general game environment is non-conducive to RP... it just serves as a adequate platform from which to launch various challenges.<br>
<br>
I know that by playing to the masses, Verant has pretty intentionally set down this road.  One of the rules of a virtual world is that the quality of roleplaying is inversely proportional to the number of players.   Oh well.  I'm not saying it's bad business sense, I'm just pointing out how this game is clearly not designed with roleplaying as a focus and how it is clearly lacking in this regard.<br>
<br>
I still think that there are things that they could have done (and they probably realize this in retrospect, hindsight is 20/20) to encourage and faccilitate roleplaying without alienating the masses, but it's too late to change things now. <p><B><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS">--Tukka</FONT></B><BR>

They used to happen quite often and there were some pretty fun ones. I missed most of the &quot;War of the Gods&quot; GM event line because I decided to take a break half way through, but it started out pretty cool. I remember lots of GM events &quot;back in the day&quot;. Killer Chickens in DL, Faydedar (or whatever his name is - that fish in TD) in the Lake of Ill Omen, Countless undead invasions of various zones, Scarecrow invasions, Mayong Mistmoore etc. Besides that Friday the 13th battle event, I haven't seen or heard of any other GM events in the couple months I have been back. <br>
<br>
Even though they were kinda lame, GM events used to be very cool. People would run half-way across the world to attend and all of the EQ fan sites would list them and the results after they happened. This was one way where VI could have kept a non-static content going but dropped the ball. It went the way of CS. Instead of enriching the gameplay of the product they had they put all of their energy into adding to it. If I had to choose between lame GM events where a bunch of killer chickens invade the Dreadlands and nothing, I would choose lame GM events.<br>

<br>
1. A fairly rich and detailed backstory that is learned in as bits and pieces here and there throughout the game.  Coupled with a game world that doesn't force you into any particular storyline.<br>
<br>
2. A website that details all the rich history of the world and which is basically required reading to understand what the point of the game is.  An on-going storyline which you will be thrust into the moment the game starts, and have no chance to affect.<br>
<br>
The second option is the approach Neocron, Shadowbane, and Asherons Call 2 are taking.  There's nothing wrong with that, but playing a forced role in someone else's story isn't how I want to roleplay.  It's too much like playing Diablo or Final Fantasy; no matter what you do, the story is going to proceed through a pre-determined and already-written plot. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ubreoghan.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Breoghan</A> at: 9/28/02 4:17:17 am<br></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <br><font color=#A62A2A>- </font><a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie>Firiona Vie</a><font color=#A62A2A> - </font><a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm1>Firiona Vie General Chat</a> <font color=#A62A2A> - </font><br><br><br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 7.0.8<br>Copyright ©1999-2002 ezboard, Inc.<br>Accelerated By <a href=http://www.wbs.com/ezboard.html>JXEL</a></center></body></html>
