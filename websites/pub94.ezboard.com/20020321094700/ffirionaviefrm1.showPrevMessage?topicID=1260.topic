<br>
So...now that the disclaimers outta the way...<br>
<br>
With the one character per account rule on this server, how do you think the character transfer policy would affect this server?<br>
<br>
- Would we see all the &quot;roleplayers&quot; from other servers coming over to join us? <br>
- Would we see people buying second accounts and then bringing over &quot;their mains&quot; to this server?<br>
- Do you think this server would improve over all? Or get worse?<br>

I think it would be a negative thing though. 'Cause no matter what, we were ALL newbies once with nothing. We all had to get over the language barrier in one way or another. We all /cheered and /danced for joy when one of those stupid orc hats dropped that sold for 23pp to a vendor so we could buy our next set of spells, or upgrade from patchwork to banded. <br>
<br>
I personally wouldnt bring my &quot;main&quot; over here... cause she sucks, and she isnt my main anymore, Roawen is my main. Roawen is the only eq char I play anymore... 'cause I just cant go back to the &quot;blue&quot; servers. It isnt the same for me anymore. (For example, my roommate logged into our old server to talk to a friend, and from across the room I saw her screen and i yelled for her to pay attention cause she was getting beat on... but she wasnt, it was just the shouts in the zone filling her screen with red text)<br>
<br>
I dont want them to open character transfer here... no matter how we all feel about each other ic and even ooc, we still have the &quot;Firiona Vie Server Bond&quot; because we all started out equal here... and someone who brought over their pl'd rez whore or port whore or whatever they wouldnt have the same feeling of &quot;home&quot; we all do, and thus wouldnt understand why we all are so adamant about the things we are... <br>
<br>
I guess what Im trying to say, is I dont want them to do character transfers, because part of the FV &quot;experience&quot; is to start out level one naked and with nothing and grow up all over again. You cant trade that. You cant transfer that. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon3.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/uaeonii.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Aeonii</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.myezboard.com/projects/ezboard/ezboard_userimages/immortalkindred/images/colors.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 59<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(1/30/02 2:55:36 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1234.topic&index=2>Reply</a>    <br>Community Supporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: How do you think character transfers would affect us?</span><hr size=1> Amen. <p><p align=</p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/uaelenie13.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Aelenie13</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 1<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(1/30/02 3:19:56 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1234.topic&index=3>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: How do you think character transfers would affect us?</span><hr size=1> i feel exactly the same way. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ukzanverto.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Kzan Verto</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Giver of da juice (tm)</span><br>  Posts: 210<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(1/30/02 3:28:31 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1234.topic&index=4>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: How do you think character transfers would affect us?</span><hr size=1> So, even if its an oppourtunity for all thos other roleplayers (see the thread, the reluctance of roleplayers to leave their server thread) on other servers to come on over you would still oppose it?<br>
<br>
By the way, these transfers would still encounter the language barriar when they arrived. They would be nakid so would still need to get gear for themselves and would have nothing in the bank (as per the character transfer policy as opposed to the /movelog policy).<br>

Alan said that Verant will never open up character transfer to this server, since a large part of the purpose of this server is to create a community, where we know each other, and have a single identity; that allowing new level 50s, for instance, coming and going off the server blows the whole idea of that &quot;community identity&quot;.

They have the 1 character open to them per account just like us.  If they are high levels they know how to get to 50 in a hurry just like us.<br>

If they really wanted to be here I think they would be like the rest of us.<br>

I personally wouldn't have minded character transfer, since it would have let me move one of my other characters here instead of doing it over again, but I understand the importance of the community.  Itchi is right, people who have high level characters know how to get there again pretty quickly.  Unless, of course you are like me and you are in a continual state of character crisis and keep remaking once you hit 20 (I'm on my 7th do-over)  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/unimiane.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Nimiane</A> at: 1/30/02 4:10:24 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=rexfelix>Rexfelix</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 125<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(1/30/02 4:27:07 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1234.topic&index=10>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: How do you think character transfers would affect us?</span><hr size=1> I don't think character transfers to this server would be as &quot;devastating&quot; as people may think.  <br>
<br>
First off, after 6 months, you'll have a significant part of the population in the lvl 50 bracket anyways.  <br>
<br>
Second, the one character per account option would be something of a barrier to entry for most people.  <br>
<br>
Third, this server is so scarcely populated as it is, even if 50% of the people brought in another account, the population would still be far below the other production servers.<br>
<br>
Fourth, the whole &quot;allowing strangers inot a community&quot; thing is not really valid.  Who will actually associate with the new transferred character other than the player's particular group and guild.  Really, what is the difference between the transfer and a guild uber pling a character from scratch to 50 in 3 days?<br>
<br>
Fifth, I miss my necromancer /cry /pine /mourn!<br>
<br>
Personally I wish they'd allow transfers to this server...that way a certain necromancer could sacrifice a certain noodle-armed paladin to his heart's content.<br>

At the same time though, you can't invalidate an argument based on something that an unknown but presumably small percentage of the server will be doing.  Sure, some folks - I don't know how many - have two or more accounts, sure uberguilds do powerlevel (and by definition, &quot;uberguilds&quot; are a small subset of the rest of the server population, most players are not members), but I think that the assumption is that the majority of players will work their way up the ranks and on the way, form at least some type of community unique to FV.   We also can't assume that the person would interact only with their friends and/or guild.

FYI, I had a 54 (maybe 55?) paladin on another server. This was before all the changes to the melee classes and the addition of disc.s etc...<br>
<br>
Anyways, the class was sooooo broken that I stopped playing him and made my shaman (Liddle). Eventually I thought I may as well put him to good use and sac'd him for our guild necro's. Thats about all that class was good for at the time. Anywasy...hope the class is better now. I still have not played him since the melee changes. Has anyone heard anything about paly stun? Have the new Luclin paladin spells cease and desist changed things at the higher end mobs? These spells were suppossed to interupt spells, but not stun the mob. Hmmm, maybe I will start a new thread about this...<br>

<br>
I know that if transfer was possible, at a minimum, I'd have rolled up a Bjond on another server, taught him all languages, then moved him here.  It only takes an hour or so to master them all on a normal blue server if you already have one character that has mastered them all.  Takes about 4-8H if you're starting from zero characters -- either need to run about for the racials or bootstrap them all.  It took me about a week to get Bjond up to master on all racials on FV and I still need to master the rares. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/uklangfv.showPublicProfile?language=EN>KlangFV</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 11<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(1/30/02 9:09:58 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1234.topic&index=15>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: How do you think character transfers would affect us?</span><hr size=1> <br>

getting gear with an epic pet isn't so bad.   But, would that be<br>
fair to the other magicians on this server?    I really don't<br>
think so...    As much agony as I went through doing my<br>
epic in the early days of that quest, I can't even begin to<br>
think of it with the TLC complications now.<br>
<br>
   I thought I read a while back Alan had posted that character<br>
transfers would *never* be allowed to FV.   I sure hope that<br>
stays in force.   It's a different game here, I just feel like it<br>
would be better to leave us alone <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

I'm finally starting a character here, and only because I am sick and tired of the other server's CRAPOLA. I hate having to start over when I have a 51st character that I love on another server. I finally just reached a point where I feel like I can either start over or I can quit EQ altogether.<br>
<br>
I think a transfer option would be a positive thing, personally. The community would not suffer (it wouldn't take long for the new characters to find their places) and it would give the folks who really want to be here a chance to come without losing their main characters (and a lot of time). I would definitely impose a limit on the number of folks allowed to transfer (and even a limit to the number from any particular guild). Even with that, there's just no way to do it without facing a ton of problems. Not to mention the fact that it wouldn't be fair to everyone who put time and effort into new characters on FV.<br>
<br>
Even with all the problems, I'd love to see a character transfer option here.<br>

Even one uber-60-warrior-dewd transferred here that can swat bats down in the blink of an eye, is a slap in the face to all of us who have worked so very hard to make this a fun, vibrant, different, and BETTER server.  Verant's stance on this is correct, and their decision to make this a harder world was a good one.  I like the low population.

Myrke, like you, I have a level 53 character on another server, with several well-equipped twinks.  I have zero interest in playing them ever again.  Any change to our ruleset here increases the odds that I may be forced to go back there, if we become just another server.  <br>

<br>
Let's be honest, who wouldn't do language learning the weekend before you transferred? For one thing, nobody needs it on normal servers, so a transfer character would start way behind, OTOH, if you worked it at all on a regular server, you could blow through languages like nothing. Not fair either way. Bad idea.<br>
<br>
Really a shame, but no matter how much I'd love to bring Numtini over here, I just don't think it would work. <p><table border=0 cellpadding=4 cellspacing=0><tr><td><img src="http://home.tampabay.rr.com/legolaas/images/numtini-100.jpg" width="52" height="100"></td><td><table style="font-family:verdana,arial;" border=0 cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0><tr><td style="font-size:10pt;"><A HREF="http://pub94.ezboard.com/unumtini.showPublicProfile?language=EN" title="<insert popup caption here>" style="color:#ff0000;font-weight:700;">Numtini Lightheart</A></td></tr><tr><td style="font-size:10pt;">46th Season Gnome of Death</td></tr><tr><td style="font-size:10pt;">Member, <A HREF="http://pub96.ezboard.com/beqcivismacto" title="Civis Macto Website" style="color:#ff0000;">Civis Macto</A></td></tr></table></td></tr></table>

The only way transfers are going to happen to or from FV is if another identical ruleset server opens up... and that likely isnt going to happen.<br>
<br>
Its kinda neat to see the different reasoning from everyone though. It seems to all boil down to &quot;protecting the integrity of the community&quot;. Which is cool. I think that shows that were all interested in protecting this server, roleplayer or not.<br>
<br>
As an aside, I do know the mage epic is the only transferable epic. I don't know if thats fair or unfair... I just know that for the amount of work and patience it takes a mage to do their epic it seems justifiable that they do get to keep it. Just my 2 bits on that subject.<br>
