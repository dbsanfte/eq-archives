<br>
If you really want case and point go dig up all the old open raid threads.  The ones where I went solely because I wanted to go.  The only item I would have used was the robe which I actually gave away once I got one because I thought it was too damn ugly.  If you wish give Despa of League of Shadows a tell he is the one I gave my robe to.<br>

I like seeing new things I like killing big mobs and the big mobs are not the same every time.  <br>

<br>
I am somewhat puzzled as to other peoples ideas of what should be praised and congratulated.<br>
<br>
I understand from this post, and from reading others in the Soap Box, that many people have had bad personal experiences when encountering a member of one of these guilds.  Now, I can certainly see why someone would like to complain when another person, especially one they have not met before, comes and does something to ruin their day.  <br>
<br>
I would also say, that if someone, especially one not met before, helps you or is friendly, they do deserve to be praised and thanked.  Now, that being said, I would say that the lack of posts praising these guilds could be they are not the type to readily help their fellow player on a daily basis.  Either by choice or simply by chance this could be. Therefore, there would be no one to come and post a &quot;praise&quot; to them.  On the other hand, it could even be that they do in fact help out many people, but the people they help are not in the habit of posting on these boards.  <br>
<br>
If the latter case be true, I would hope they would come forward and state their good experiences when they see someone labeling the kind players as anything but.  Until that happens, bad feelings will hover in the minds of those who feel wronged by the guilds and those who do not know any different about these guilds.  <br>
<br>
Now, with all that said, I will come to my point and opinion.  I see here that the original poster decided to “praise” this guild, which is quite all right.  However, I fail to see what there is to praise about the guilds from his post.  He has listed the guilds doing some feats that may be difficult for others to achieve.  I though, do not see why they deserve praise for this?  (Congratulations perhaps)  As another poster stated earlier, these things they have done are not firsts.  In fact several guilds on several servers have accomplished these feats before.  In my opinion as well, these acts do not require praise.  I will keep my praise for those who would do things for selfless reasons.  “Owning a zone” or killing an all powerful creature on a raid, do not strike me as selfless acts.  <br>
<br>
My praise would go to those individuals who do simple selfless acts.  Assisting a lone fellow on a difficult corpse run, being the protector to all newbies for a day, or summoning lone player’s corpse from the top of a tall tower after his group has deserted him (I have had the pleasure of receiving this act,) as well as any other such actions.  I am sure someone in either or all of these guilds that were mentioned possibly did do some such thing of greatness similar to those I give as example.  And if they have not received praise, I will say thank you and well done to them all now. <br>
<br>
Congratulations to them all for becoming strong enough to take on the Master Challenges of the Everquest realm.  But, I still don’t see anything to praise them about.  Come everyone do let us know how they have made your lives a bit happier.  (in Kudos section if you prefer, instead of here.)<br>
<br>
As for raids, I would say they are 99% motivated by Loot.  Someone wanted something from there, or at least can USE something from there.  The other 1% I would say are raids simply for the sake of exploring a new area they had not been to before.  (going in a large group is the safest way)  Why do wizards go on the raid when there is no loot for them to get you ask?? Well, they go so when they wish to get an item from a certain zone, they will be remembered for helping others get the things they need from this zone.  (or outside planes raids, to get a chance at rolling on a nice item that no one else there needs for trading)<br>

and to add to that, in general, people that think everyone, or most people, think a certain way.... they themselves think that way. <br>
<br>
sure, loot is nice, especialy when it drastically helps you do your job. but it's certainly not the point of raids in many people's view. alot of people only go to raids for the challenge, or to help guildies, or to just have fun with guildies, to try something new, see new places, new mobs... there are so many other reasons than loot. you could take loot out of the game, and there would still be probably 80% of the raid guilds still around still doing the same thing. <p><BR><B>Baroness Veloxia Voluptuous </B><BR>

I have done many kind things for people and have never been mentioned on the kudos page. Many people have done kind things to me and I have never mentioned them on the Kudos page.<br>
<br>
The kudos page is restricted to something out of the ordinary. Thanks to the good people of Firiona Vie, someone helping someone else is pretty common. Helping people is also often relatively easy.<br>
<br>
Shaking hands with Bristlebane (or stabbing him in the back) is out of the ordinary. What's more, it takes a lot of work. More work than an epic, I would say. People are congratulated upon their epics, are they not?<br>

The novelty of going somewhere for the first time and facing new challenges wears off the first time you do it. Sure, they'll continue to stream back in, day after day, in order to help the guild <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> get more loot</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->. I hate to say it, but progress in EQ works like this:<br>
<br>
... Fight monsters -&gt; Gain experience -&gt; Get new gear to fight better monsters - &gt; Fight monsters -&gt; Gain experience -&gt; Get new gear to fight better monsters ...<br>
<br>
The only time when the game is not about loot is when you're roleplaying. All progress is dependent on loot. Without loot, you can't go further. So are you saying that all these people in these raiding guilds don't care about progressing? <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/unavarre13.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Navarre13</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 6<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(8/13/02 6:46:45 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1193.topic&index=47>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Helping others is too easy to be given Kudos?!?!</span><hr size=1> &quot;The kudos page is restricted to something out of the ordinary.

<br>
Is it really the feeling of players that killing a uber NPC is more important then taking time out of your mindless slaughter to assist another player in trouble??<br>
<br>
I am sure I'm just reading too much into this statement. (I hope).  I would much rather see twenty posts stating that &quot;player A&quot; helped &quot;player B&quot; who was in a jam. Then a single post on some guilds exploits killing a God.  <br>
<br>
Helping others is relatively easy, that is true, if you care to try.  However, It shows more about a &quot;Player's&quot; attitude and mind then any raid on a plane does.  And, this is what should be congratulated.  That someone put another person FIRST or dropped what they were doing to help that poor soul who is up a creek without a paddle.  Anyone can get to level 50 or 60 with enough playing time... and with enough characters of that level, it is sure that most anything can be accomplished if they are assembled in one place.  This shows me NOTHING of what kind of people these are.  <br>
<br>
Running someone over with a train, just cause they are there... or some other such thing (i do not remember all the complaints posted on this board) Speaks volumes about the individual. (barring unintentional actions, followed by apologies to those wrongfully injured. A sincere apology also speaks volumes) <br>
<br>
I'm just thinking the wrong things are being celebrated and the important ones go unnoticed.<br>

Hear hear.  The guilds named above certainly deserve contratulations too.  But are they really doing anything that out of the ordinary?  It's good work, but it's stuff being done on all the other servers all the time.  What's really out of the ordinary is worth the real congrats.  How about all the work Gore, and Thrads, and Ellishae are putting into RP events on this server ... getting dozens of people involved and running around, for NO loot and NO experience rewards.  Spending time in the bazaar fighting it out in public, running around challenging people, working out a whole convoluted story line ... now that's something that's not on any other server, and something truly deserving of congrats.  =) <p><table border=0><tr><td width=20%><img src="http://users.bigpond.net.au/stbt/didi/a_didisig.gif" height=120 width=120></td><td><FONT FACE="Tempus Sans ITC" SIZE="2">

When FnF goes and kills ST warders, the members aren't going there hoping to upgrade THEIR gear..I don't think they do it for a challenge, either, the warder fights are stupidly easy and there's not much that can go wrong in them.  The reason they go -- I'm assuming -- is to upgrade their guild so that it can do harder things.  Anything wrong with that...? <p>--Lacus<br>Grandmaster<br>

We in my guild have been raiding recently places that we can work on our techniques. Sweet lord we were in Dalnirs just so we could work on our training, such as the ghetto mez of split/root, and waiting on the MT, and working on our assisting. Most in my guild have never raided, so we went somewhere we knew well and could practice and not risk too much. We weren't interested in loot, or even the challenege of the mobs, but in honing our techniques.<br>
<br>
Also, as was said earlier. Maybe a Raid is about loot, but that is definitly not the reason many people go. Esp if you go look at the Open Raids from early on. There is NO GROUP for the wizards to be  making stronger in Hate. There is no Guild called Open Raid. It's not a close knit group of 24 friends. It's about 150 people who go to these things (not at the same time). Maybe someone who does win a roll continues on, but there is zero guarantee that they will, so there is NO incentive for the wizards to go. And then there are all the times that some high levels have helped out my guild on raids...raids that their guild did about three months ago. There are two people in particular that I can think of whose guilds are doing planes and better raids...yet they came back to help us do City of Mist and Chardok. There was not one single thing that they needed from those places, so maybe PA was raiding for gear...but they sure weren't.<br>

But once you have it...Come on, how many MT's out there give back their uber gear when they're guildremoved?  I've seen numerous flames about people doing that right here on this board.  Guildleaders and such getting pissed that someone won't give back loot that was gained 'on the guild's back' rather than the player's.<br>
<br>
I do disagree with Tzaroth on raids being completely about loot.  Ryael/skrag/whatever it is this week, I mean come on.  I'd go on a raid to anything if I had the chance, because I've never seen it.  I know every newbie zone in the joint, and it's old hat...I'd gladly welcome seeing a plane, any plane.<br>
<br>
Why the guilds keep going back is so that they can see new things!  You go in a place once, it has nice drops, everyone's seen it, etc.  Now to go to the next NEW thing, more people need the gear that's dropped in the OLD place.  So you have to keep doing what's there until you can move to the next place.<br>
<br>
Look at it from a real life perspective...when you get a job (assuming you've ever had one), do you quit after you get the first paycheck?  No.  You spend the next paycheck on different stuff.  Alot of people work to continue their education so that they can have better careers.  This is the same thing that happens with raiding guilds...they have to get enough members with good gear so that when they go to the next place on the list, they won't wipe out and ruin everyone's day.<br>
<br>
I'd easily go on an open raid if I could just to see new things.  If I joined a raiding guild that could take me places that open raids could never go, I'd fully expect to help them farm things just so I could see the next best thing. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ufaira.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Faira</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 37<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(8/14/02 1:26:54 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1193.topic&index=57>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: How bout someone saying- Congratulations</span><hr size=1> I hardly ever post on this board, but this got my eye...let me quote:<br>
<br>
&lt;Because, my respect is minimal for those who let this game dominate their lives in the way that hardcore raiders do. I always thought the fun of the game came in when you accomplished something like gaining a level or finishing a quest to get a new spell or breastplate. It's when the game becomes all about loot that it mirrors Diablo.&lt;<br>
<br>
This person clearly has no idea what it means to be in a guild that can accomplish such things as FnF, Reso.. etc. No, its not all about the loot!  You go out and you kill one of the hardest badass mobs in the game, and you tell me what kind thrill comes out of that!!  ITS AWESOME! Hasn't a darn thing to do with its loot.. sure that is a nice bonus.. but the reason behind it surely wasn't all for his loot.<br>
<br>
As for not feeling any pride for gaining new spells, quest or lvls.. that clearly is not true. I see every day in our own guild how happy get because they finished a quest.. Myself just tonight finished a quest for a new helm. I was the happiest person on this server tonight!<br>
So, please sit back and look at the big picture here before you make such a statment that you clearly have no idea on...<br>

I am like totally into loot; everyone knows this.  Yes I like getting new stuff its a lot of fun for me; HOWEVER, the big picture is killing a super tough mob that takes much teamwork and coordination.  When you win its just simply an amazing feeling.  <br>
<br>
Recently we killed Aaryonar and went into NToV and killed tons of hard stuff.  It was soooo much fun and yes they drop good items that people /drool over duh? but the whole attitude of everyone there involved was like WOOHOOO whats next!?  It seems only people who have never done this before criticise guilds and say false statements about what they are really after.  Sadly you will never understand until you do it for yourself =)<br>
<br>
Ollias about your *when you kill a mob you show you can beat it so move on*  But the challenge of it is still hard.  King Tormax is a toughy and just because weve won doesnt mean hes a pushover, and we dont win every time.  It is challenging each and every time =)<br>

Never been to Sleepers, PoM, PoG (personal reasons), Hole (just never made it to those raids), Jaggedpines (new).  I think I have been everywhere else.  60 rogue, 34 druid and a 51 bard.  Seen somethings and one thing is for sure, this argument is as old as the first server.<br>
<br>
My opinion is I went on raids for three reasons:<br>
<br>
1) First time there. Once there, no desire to go back unless I liked it.<br>
<br>
2) Help friends (epics, etc ~ most common reason)<br>
<br>
3) Loot.  Most of us were there for the loot.  It's a fact most don't like to admit.  The cheers that occur when the plate bp drops for the next in line but the bickering among some that they should get it.  I have heard it.  Congratulations on 100 plus NTOV raids.  There are firsts.  You need better gear to move on.  Many have excellent gear on this server to compete with others in BoT.<br>
<br>
One of my favorite sayings (paraphrased) in the game is &quot;takes hard work, sacrafice and committment to further yourself&quot;.  True, but I reserve that for me working 50-60  hours a week to pull down a low 6 figure salary to support a few children and a wife near the beach in California.  That is hard work.  That is sacrifice.  <br>
<br>
Last time I checked, I am not wearing a robe with a scythe going to work.  This is a game.  These are pixels.<br>
<br>
For me, no congratulations for 2 reasons.  One is that I have been there done that for alot of it and the luster of first time things actually got old.  Different pixels with new loot.  Second reason is I never really hooted and hollered about even getting an epic much less my ToV bp, etc.  I would congratulate friends or guildmates in tells.  Always in tells.  Personal and not showy.  Raids can be fun and are fun.  We all enjoy different things but the hope of getting the drop is there for the bulk of us (me too).<br>
<br>
As for this public display of love, while some may say it is respect of what others are doing in Pixel World, for me it comes off as sucking up.  Get to 60 and apply.  <br>
<br>
Finally, if it isn't about the loot. If it truly isn't about the loot!!!  Then once your guild members don't need a piece of armor, a weapon or a spell, instead of selling it....pass it on......Hey, it's not about the loot.<br>
<br>
Well, slash away but my opinion won't change after almost 3 years in game (off and on).<br>
<br>
Have fun in GAME!<br>

<br>
I have one question, though; does Reso / FnF / AS even care about getting praise for every little thing they do? Because I'm not sure if the original poster is even in any of those guilds, which brings up an interesting thought: why do <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i>  they</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> care?<br>
<br>
EDIT to address Faira: No guild does something for the server. Guilds are all about self-empowerment. Do FnF members donate money to VI to help keep the server live? Do FnF members double as developers, who quickly and efficiently respond to /bug reports and get the game back on it's feet? Do FnF members even distribute gold pieces and tarnished weapons to newbies as they exit their city?<br>
<br>
I doubt it. So before you go off, telling me I have no idea about what your guilds do, think about what you're saying: FnF does <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> a lot for the server</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->? I'm not trying to disrespect people in FnF, but being in a raiding guild does not automatically equate to doing a service to the community. You toil away at your keyboard for hours upon hours, picking away at a mob that will respawn later that week. You're simply restarting a spawn timer every time you knock off <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> X</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> mob.<br>
<br>
Being the first to do it (on this server); well, sure, a little notion of respect might be nice. I can only state that they should pick up volunteer work at a local hospital or homeless shelter if getting praised is their innermost desire, though. Getting the power up and winning the game isn't important or particularly helpful to anyone. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/utzarothfv.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Tzaroth FV</A> at: 8/14/02 2:54:41 am<br></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top">  Page <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.showMessageRange?topicID=1193.topic&start=1&stop=20>1</a><a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.showMessageRange?topicID=1193.topic&start=21&stop=40>2</a> <b>3</b> <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.showMessageRange?topicID=1193.topic&start=61&stop=80>4</a><a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.showMessageRange?topicID=1193.topic&start=81&stop=84>5</a> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.showPrevMessage?topicID=1193.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.showNextMessage?topicID=1193.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a self href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1193.topic&index=60><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/classic/addReply.jpg border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"><a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.threadControl?topicID=1193.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/professional/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands (Moderator only)</a><br> <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=1193.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=1193.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub94.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="firionaviefrm1">Firiona Vie General Chat<option value="firionaviefrm9">OT/OOC Forum<option value="firionaviefrm4">The Soapbox<option value="firionaviefrm58">Telegrams!<option value="firionaviefrm47">Guilds and Associations<option value="firionaviefrm10">A Bard for a Day<option value="firionaviefrm23">Hero Heart Tavern<option value="firionaviefrm15">The Polling Booth<option value="firionaviefrm40">Kudos!<option value="firionaviefrm48">Ye Olde Coffeeshop<option value="firionaviefrm57">Apep's Coffee Talk<option value="firionaviefrm2">The Market Square<option value="firionaviefrm22">The Tradeskill Shop<option value="firionaviefrm38">The Spell Library<option value="firionaviefrm59">The Battlefield<option value="firionaviefrm39">Renaissance Festival<option value="firionaviefrm42">Roleplayers Wanted/LFG<option value="firionaviefrm43">The Fighter's Den<option value="firionaviefrm44">Tower of Magick<option value="firionaviefrm45">Altar of Faith<option value="firionaviefrm12">Suggestion Box<option value="firionaviefrm6">Signature Testing<option value="firionaviefrm7">Patch Messages<option value="firionaviefrm49">Apep's Dead Horse Forum</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#A62A2A>- </font><a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie>Firiona Vie</a><font color=#A62A2A> - </font><a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4>The Soapbox</a> <font color=#A62A2A> - </font><br><br><br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 6.9.5.4<br>Copyright ©1999-2002 ezboard, Inc.</center></body></html>
