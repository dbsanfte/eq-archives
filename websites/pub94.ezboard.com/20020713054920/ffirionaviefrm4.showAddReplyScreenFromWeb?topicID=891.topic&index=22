be frank, shut the f*** up you newbie bitch.  The new people aren't what made the server, those of us who have been here since the start made the server, the economy, the guilds, everything that this place is.  New people like you come and say 'no alt, please , waa waa waa'.  Well guess what, everyone started like that, but after you've been here 9 month, it gets boring.  Once you'll have been here as long as the posters, then you can complain, but as it stands, there are perhaps 25% of us who are actually left that made the server what it is, we got to 50+ and once there, there is only so much you can do.  If people want to twink the living s*** out of a toon, they will have deserved it since they worked for everything they have.<br>
<br>
And guess what, no one as actually said 'I want an alt to twink' , people are saying, 'I want an alt to mule, to bank or to get a chance to have fun'.  You new people are going around equipped at 20 with what we had at 40, you shout, auction, act like doods and do whatever you want... we formed the economy, most of the guilds, the tight knit community as it stands for the raids and the battles which you can't do alone.  We dealt with no auction, limited shout, forced roleplay, lanquage restrictions, alignement restrictions, so if we want alts to further enjoy the server, why the hell should we not be allowed to have some.  <br>

<br>
Please recognize that there's room for reasonable people to disagree on this issue.<br>
<br>
While earlier I was stating the reality of the situation, I also prefer things to be one character, and I've been on the server, causing one ruckus or another, since the first week (started on day one, but went back to SZ for a week when I couldn't get a kill in edgewise due to the rampant KSing of orc pawns, bees, spiders, etc).  I'm not some &quot;newb&quot; who showed up 4-6 months later.<br>
<br>
However, I understand why people want alternates.  There are times I'd really like to reprise my AD&amp;D paladin Sarah, and FV would be the perfect place for her.<br>
<br>
I think Verant screwed up from the get-go by a) having so many servers and then b) also allowing 8 characters per server except on FV and SZ.  But what's done is done, and there's no use complaining about it now.<br>
<br>
I had 40 characters in my partner's AD&amp;D campaign, at last count, but he had a meta-rule in his campaign that forbade characters of the same player to meet one another--and a harsh rule, at that.  If they did, he (the DM) absorbed one of them as an NPC under his control--permanently.  Coupled with the fact that each magic item that wasn't a limited-charge item (wands, potions, etc) was unique (meaning only one Short Sword +1, one Holy Avenger, etc.), and what we know as &quot;twinking&quot; was just impossible.  Finding a magic item, any magic item, was an Event, capital &quot;E&quot;, no matter how piddly the item actually was.  Anyway, I guess I'm trying to say I understand the urge to create multiple characters and explore what they can do.  I've done it myself in other RPG settings, and there were times I just did not want to play my evil necromancer, and other times I didn't want to play her twin. <p><center><img src="http://home.earthlink.net/~andersonrob/lasgalensig.jpg" border="0"></center>

I did more for FV than you ever will boyo, I was among the founders of a 7 guild roleplay alliance, I was an active member in the open raid community in the plans and leading 36-42 people to Nagafen on a few occasions and giving people a chance to do things they might not otherwise do.  <br>
<br>
No offense, but I deserved an alt for my work on FV, my alt was to have fun and be able to do more.  No matter what you do on the server, you will never surpass me, I was here at the beginning, saw the world form and change, was among those of us here who made it what it is.  I was the first to go to North Karana and East Karana, I was probably the first to get to Freeport on the server from Qeynos at level 5.  <br>
<br>
We are better than you, we don't need people like you coming now and assuming it's your right to tell us what to do.  We MADE Firiona Vie, if it was not for us, there would be no Firiona Vie, it would have died long ago.  But now we have a bunch like you who came after the May 8th patch which ruined the server and you dare tell us what we can and can't do? You have not lived till you've gone from 1-40 speaking only 1 tongue and using Emotes without knowing who is what, not understanding anyone, not being able to shout.<br>
<br>
As for not having an alt, just this week, a 52 friend quit the game like me as he was bored and a 55 in our guild decided to reroll himself as a rogue.  Tons and tons of friends have quit and more will follow.<br>
<br>
I can leave you all with this advice, have fun while you're under 50, but never reach over 50 because then you will find out why you need an alternate.<br>

Sheez, take a breath and count to ten Feneant. Is the injustice of it all just too much for you to handle anymore? Mom ground you for the weekend? Whatever your trip man, embrace the pain, get over it and yourself and mellow. Realize that for everything you did, for everything you accomplished there are those of us out there who are grateful and would like to say thank you...except right now you sound like an arrogant, self-aggrandizing prick and who want's to talk to one of those?<br>

I'm still fairly new to this game.  could someone tell me what a blue server is?  =\<br>
<br>
about the character limit<br>
i'd love to be able to play other characters on this server.  i currently have a paladin at 45 (my first character) but i'd really like to try out some of thee other races and classes.  I started playin on this server but i didn't know there was a character limit until i was about 11 and decided to create another character.  course i learned i couldn't so i just stuck with my pally.   <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/uegilbe.showPublicProfile?language=EN>egilbe</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 35<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(6/30/02 3:44:10 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=891.topic&index=28>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: just random thoughts</span><hr size=1> I just had a thought...doesn't happen very often. When you get a character up to a certain level (say 55) you are granted the option to start a new character. But, hard code it so no equipment can go from the high level toon to a low level toon. Must be a neutral third party involved. That would make it more difficult to pass gear off, but not impossible. <br>
 I have a lot of time invested in Wiestrum-she's my first EQ character-I screwed up that starting stats for a rogue, wish I had put the bonus points into Dex, rather than charisma, but she is still my highest level character on ANY server. Sometimes I wish I could play a troll shaman on this server, but not really looking forward to rerolling. I would miss my Sisters too much. <br>
<br>
blue servers are the hell that *most* people ran from, to come here. They are filled with rude, arrogant, irritating, immature people, who speak a language called d00d.  Good for trying out new characters and classes, but not good for fun. (or my Idea of fun). They are overcrowded, noisy, and generally nasty. They are the standard production servers as apposed to the -Zeks, which are player vs. player, or red (correct me if I'm wrong) servers.<br>

What do you want, chump, a fucking cookie? You are nothing more than a pretentious piece of drivel who needs to let Mommy give you the Prozac.  YOU DESERVE?!?!!?  You are exactly what is wrong with people in this world, you think somehow you're OWED something when, in fact, you are owed nothing.  No one owes you anything, least of all respect.

I'm so torn between ranger and paladin, but with having an account for me and an account that my teens share, plus cable on a switcher out to four computers, I can't justify buying software and springing the $13 for another toon.<br>
