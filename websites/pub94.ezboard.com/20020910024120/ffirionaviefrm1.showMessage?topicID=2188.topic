<br>
Hail and well met friends.<br>
<br>
My name is Emnitaros, a Druid of Tunare.  While cleansing the world of Norrath from the filth that has corrupted the lands, I have been tasked by Telin Darkforest to rid the world of a Corrupted Dark Elf in the Karanas.<br>
<br>
/roleplay off<br>
<br>
<br>
I have a major dilema.   It seems that I lead a dual life here.  In one world (Innoruuk server), I am the leader of a strong guild with many many members.  In another world (here) I'm a quiet solitary nomad that spends his time killing bugs in the Commonlands, and generally enjoying the quiet.  <br>
Where one world if rife with action, the other world is almost deathly silent.<br>
<br>
<br>
I generated Emnitaros on the night that FV went live. The thought of a &quot;Roleplaying Preferred&quot; server really appealed to me, and I was here (and in character) the first night.  I remember the days of seeing 122 people in Gfay, 110 in Butcherblock, and was privy to several Zone Crashes and Orc Pawn KSs.  It was quite fun fighting over a bumble bee with 60 other naked Wood Elves.  My original plan had been to eventually switch over to FV, but then I got nominated as the new Guild Leader when the old one suffered from severe burnout.  He handed the reigns to me, and I told myself that the same fate wouldn't befall me, and have taken precautions.<br>
<br>
Firiona Vie is my place of &quot;Refuge&quot;.  Call it &quot;Superman's fortess of solitude&quot; if you want.  I gravitate here when I need a break from the constant /tells and numerous questions that I get bombarded with on Innoruuk.  I've also notified my guild that from now on, every Thursday night is &quot;Firiona Vie Night&quot; for me, and for them not to expect me heading up any guild events.  I find that Firiona Vie is extremely calm, relaxed, and the population as a whole is fantastic.   The good races that I have met are almost always friendly and the evil races are just that.  I remember the first time a Dark Elf scowled at me when I approached Orc 1 in the Commons.  I was grinning from ear to ear.  Also, the number of &quot;Beggars&quot; that are normally hovering around every major banking establishment are completely lacking here.  This is definately a fine place to play in, and I always feel more relaxed by the time I log.<br>
<br>
<br>
Being a Guild Leader tends to place a great deal of responsibility on one's shoulders.  Some days, I feel like I'm the only one planning anything.  Other times, I'll wonder what would happen if I were to vanish for a week.  Either way though, I love my guild, I love my members, and will never abandon either one.  At the same time, a vacation is always nice, and that is what Firiona Vie is to me.<br>
<br>
<br>
I'm currently level 12, and am already set for my DE Corruptor kill in East Karana.   Yes,  I did the mad dash to the Burning Woods (before the newbie patch) at level 8 by using the boats and a lot of luck.   I took a fist in the face when dealing with Giz X’Tin, and on the way back to BW for the final handin, I died not 10 feet from Telin Darkforest (Giant Ancient somethingorother got me while I was pulling the coin out of my inventory).  The naked run back was a bit of a hassle but I was very happy to finally be able to go to bed knowing I'd gotten up to my first &quot;Epic Battle&quot; on the Firiona Vie server.   I've never played a Druid before, and am really enjoying the fighting style (so different from the Paladin) that a Druid uses.  Also note that I have no intentions of Re-Rolling Emnitaros.  He is my Druid, and always will be.<br>
<br>
I'm not looking for a handout here.  I simply love the quests.  On Innoruuk, I've been privy to several Druid / Ranger Epic kills, as well as about 15 completed Soulfire quests.  I've organized several pickup Vox/Naggy raids as well as many PoF and PoH raids, some of which were public.  My own Epics include my main Paladin at the Vox/Naggy bottleneck, a 6 Paladin with a Soulfire and Ghoulbane (So, another Vox/Naggy bottleneck, although this one will never level), a Warrior 1/4 through his Epic, a Bard at the White Scale bottleneck, as well as a Cleric that just recently killed the Plasmatic Priest.  On top of these, I've aided numerous guildmates as well as in-game friends through the early stages of their Epics, and was even there for 2 final battles (Monk and Rogue).<br>
<br>
Yes, I'm quite used to helping people, and I generally enjoy it.<br>
<br>
<br>
This is what I would like to offer to any of the bigger guilds/groups on this server.   Since I don't have money or items worth mentioning yet I thought I'd offer my quest knowledge in trade.  Here is what I would like to propose:<br>
<br>
I will guide 3 of your Rangers/Druids through the first 4 steps of their Epic Quests (Including faction building and camping the mobs with them). <br>
<br>
I will provide this service either one-on-one over 3 days, or all at once (although Faelin Bloodbriar could be a problem)<br>
<br>
This will bring them up to the same point in their Epics that I am at.  I will then offer my advice on tactics for taking down the Dark Elf Corruptor.  I can also generate the groups using Raid Leader, and can coordinate the attacks via BattleCom (Voice-Over-Ip technology)  <br>
<br>
To kill the Corruptor 3 times in a row will require 3 hours of your guild's time.  I ask only that you stick around long enough to allow me the looting rights on my own DE Corruptor kill which I am not powerful enough to do for myself.<br>
<br>
This will require a &quot;4th&quot; hour, after your three guildies have gained their mixing bowls.   <br>
<br>
My reasons are as follows:<br>
<br>
Since this is my &quot;relief alt&quot; on another server, I can't dedicate the time needed to join an established guild here, befriend everyone, aid them in several epics/kills, and finally get my DE Corruptor kill.  My time on FV is sporatic (sometimes gone for weeks, sometimes here a few nights in a row), and I'd feel incredibly guilty if I tried joining a guild that I couldn't dedicate 100% of my time and energy towards.  Also note, the  whole &quot;Join them until they get me what I want&quot; attitude disgusts me.  As a Guild Leader, I've seen this before, and I've never liked it.<br>
<br>
Therefore, I'd like to &quot;Rent&quot; the manpower/assistance of a bigger guild.  At the same time though, I'll be providing a benefit to your own guild in threefold.<br>
<br>
So I ask you now, will any of the higher level guilds (those with a group or two of level 50-55s) aid me in this endeavor?<br>
<br>
I've known many good Druids that have never even glanced at their Epic.  It's not uncommon to find a few that need a helping hand, and a Guild Leader just doesn't have the time to do this.  A lowly Druid that no one knows about has the time though....<br>
<br>
<br>
Also note:   I will not be pestering the boards for help with Faydedar, Jade Reaver, etc. These kills, I'll gather my own forces for later in Emnitaros' carreer. I just find that the DE Corruptor kill is WAY too early in the Druid Epic, and it's really not that much of a bottleneck, being a triggered spawn and all.  That's just my opinion though.  I still plan on doing the &quot;Cleansing&quot; parts via pickup groups or solo, and if that takes me the next few years, so be it.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
While Emnitaros is a solitary wanderer, he does contain a wealth of knowledge gleaned from various tomes and encounters.  Feel free to question him if you see him around.  My brain is at your disposal.<br>
<br>
I will check this post over the next few days to see what you all think.<br>

Epics arent Soulfires.  You are asking 20-30 high level people to help you out on mobs you cant even be in the same zone with because a single hit will kill you.  Not to be rude, and I admire your tenacity, but no, it will not happen for another 40 levels.  This is Everquest.  Everything is numbers.  You dont have them in front of your name.  No determination, dedication, or other emotion will see past that.<br>

<br>
I would agree with you if I were simply here trying to beg people to kill the DE Corruptor for me.  I am not.  I'm offering a service (guiding 3 druids/rangers in their Epics) in exchange for this kill.<br>
<br>
The Corruptor kill takes 2 groups at most to do.  Guiding 3 Druids/Rangers that haven't read up on their Epics could take upwards of a week's time if the NPCs aren't up.  Granted, anyone can go to EQDruids.Com and read up on it themselves, but it's been my experience that a majority of players are either reluctant to start their Epics simply based on the &quot;Faction building / Handins&quot; portion of the quests, they may not have access to a printer for quick reference, or they may only know about the &quot;Big Kills&quot; through word of mouth.<br>
<br>
Either way, there's no harm in asking.  I didn't expect people to trip all over themselves offering to help a low level Druid that they don't even know, but there may be some people out there that need a guide.  As for joining a guild/putting in the time, I've already explained that this is an alternate character on a different server.  At most, all I would be to a guild is a casual player that is on every now and again, and is quickly outleveled by everyone else.  1-2 nights a week is no match for the 5-6 nights (including weekends) that I spend on Innoruuk.<br>
<br>
Look at me as a consultant for hire.  You try getting a high level Druid from your guild to drop whatever he's doing to guide you through the start of an Epic that he's already done, and then ask him to do it again two more times.  Chances are, he/she/it may be a little reluctant to comply.  Also, that same Druid may be more needed on whatever raid is currently going on than sitting in the Faydark nuking an Orc Pawn every 8 minutes.<br>
<br>
<br>
Like I said, I love questing.  I love reading up on them, I love seeing the stories unfold, and I love hearing that fanfare midi and receiving all of those faction hits.<br>
<br>
<br>
Whether or not you choose to help me is your choice.  Just let it be known that I'm not asking for a handout here.   If I have to, I'll wait until I'm at level 50+ before tackling the Corruptor, and that is fine.  I guess I just want to ride the momentum that I've already built doing my Epic.  Yes, I was pretty happy about getting my Coin at only level 12.<br>
<br>
<br>
Thanks, and I hope to hear from you all.<br>

As for taking a week, I did the turn-ins to get the coin in 1.5 hours which includes time wasted as I had to travel everywhere by foot.  With a druid to port, you can do it in about 30 minutes with SoW and if you know where Faelin Spawns in G.Fay (I've done this part 4 times now...2 for myself, 2 for friends...long story) and we've always gotten her to spawn within 15-20 minutes.  Every other NPC you need is always up, at least as far as I've seen.<br>

<br>
First of all, I'd like to say it's great that you are starting your epic so early.  I started mine around level 30 when I had more port spells, but I think the earlier you start it the more likely you are to finish it.  I used to pick one day and go out and get a piece.  I only need three items to finish my epic and I doubt you could help me with those.  However, I'm always up for helping others.  So if you see me online, send me a shout.  I'm currently guildless, but I will round up a couple friends to come help you do this.  It takes half hour to do it, so it's not a big deal. <br>
<br>
Send me a shout.<br>
