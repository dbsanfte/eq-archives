Skyshrine. She remembered it well. Her first glance went to the banner, which still swayed, although the air in the hallway did not stir. The second glance went to the floor. Faded stains spoke of battle. They took her back into the past. The hours spent here.<br>
<br>
Love and joy. This was where she had felt true joy last. It was this where last time someone had told her she had been loved, At least without her offering a trip to the lodge, to bleed whoever told her until he either denied it, or died.<br>
<br>
She thought back at the weekend. Love and joy indeed. But not for her. She spent some of it with her sister on the moon. It had been the first time in ages that she had seen her. She indeed looked good. Rested. And of course, she was her old self, dragging unwanted truths from her. Aside her sister, she forgot what she was, forgot the cold. They walked the moon together.. Marus Seru, Netherbians Lair, even Mons Letalis. And as in the old days, they fought side by side. But her memories did not stay with her sister all that long.<br>
<br>
Instead, she went back to the evening. A little excursion into a crypt.Together with people she hardly knew. A Bonedancer for hire, that was what she was that evening. She went with them, just because there was no reason not to. Over a dozen strong, they went in. The battle was fierce, as the coerced came in waves. But nothing there could stand against them, and so they went.. deeper and deeper. Down to the bottom, to the one controlling the crypt. <br>
<br>
It was here she heard the call. Someone unknown to her offered a lot, just for someone to come and kill for him. Just as the Overseer fell, his voice echoed through the crypt. &quot;<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> Looking for a young one to aid me. Am willing to pay for the service.</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->&quot;. Once the battle was over, the party settled down to rest. They were to head out soon. All they found was fodder for the monks tonight, so she was free, so to speak. So she offered her services. And was accepted. A bonedancer for hire. Fighting for those who pay. Fitting, for a weekend of joy.<br>
<br>
It was good she had left early, but it took a few hours for her to find that out. Sitting in the halls, waiting for the Blacksmith was boring, so she and the knight rolled dice, and talked. Nothing of interest, really. Just idle talk. No joy. No love. Just business. Then, finally, as she was about to leave, the Blacksmith came, and died.<br>
<br>
She took her money, bowed to the knight, and headed for the moon. No second thought at the crypt, the knight, or anything else. She longed to be back on the moon, safe from the pressure on her soul. So she met up with the Priestess and the Ilharn to discuss the family.<br>
<br>
It was then she heard of the tragedy. Of the enchantress dying as the others headed out. Her corpse was still in the crypt, and she had died again as she tried to recover. She was asking for a Bonedancer to summon it out.<br>
<br>
Love and joy.. Yes... she was overjoyed to hear that the people she had been with had abandoned her.. her, one of theirs too. Their sister, or.. perhaps not. They were not as the conclave. She didnt know. But that, she had not expected. It was getting late, but her corpse was still down there.<br>
<br>
So she formed a plan. It would take the dark one's own luck to succeed, but she would be damned if she didnt try. So messages she sent. Messages of hate.. of need.. invoking old deeds, and asking favours of those she could ask.<br>
<br>
In the end, she had to be content with her old brother in crime. A wizard, who had outgrown her with ease. They had done many silly things together. She went back with him - back to the crypt, and met up with the enchantress, who too had a wizard at her disposal. And there and then, the time of the Bonedancer came.<br>
<br>
She had a plan. And she made sure they all knew. It didnt matter that she was the youngest. She ordered them all around. Go here.. cast there.. stay here.. dont move.. dont die. They cloaked themselves in shadows, used magics to float.. and off they went.. deep into the crypt once more. <br>
<br>
It was an exciting run - past unknowing thralls, goos, and other inhabitants, each of one might easily bring the whole run to an end. But against all odds, they made it to the hallway. The exact place where she had spent hours waiting with the knight,. She knew it was safe, except for one thrall to walk in at times. Here, she bid two of them to wait, while she and one of the wizards went even deeper. Past the magic door, which would not let them return. But they got the corpse there. <br>
<br>
She ordered the wizard to cast.. evacuate.. back to the entrance.. and the race began anew. The wizard didnt make it. His shadows failed and he had to get out again. She did not heed his screams and ran on, deeper and deeper, into the crypt, down through the grave, and through the trapdoor. Running like mad.<br>
And through the magical door, she could summon the corpse, and bring it to the remaining wizard.<br>
And there they waited for the right moment. And when it came, she told the Wizard &quot;<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> Kill.. it.. NOW!!</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->&quot;.<br>
<br>
And while the two of them dispatched the Kly, the Enchantress reclaimed her things. It was the most exhilarating moment she had felt in months.. her plan had worked. Soon, she could poke the wizard to evacuate them all to safety. Noone had died. No corpse had been abandoned. She had done alone what none of the monks had dared. And she had gotten away with it. Indeed, the dark one had smiled on her.<br>
<br>
Love and joy. Maybe not. Death and destruction was more like it. And hate. Hate for those who had abandoned the Enchantress.. hate for the Kly who kept her from recovering the corpse.<br>
<br>
But it had been a good weekend. <p>Silenae Do'Bauthin<br><br>
