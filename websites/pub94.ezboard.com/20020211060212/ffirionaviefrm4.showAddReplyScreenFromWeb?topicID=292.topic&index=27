<br>
I would encourage anyone who wants to kill some time as this joust continues to read all the &quot;Shin&quot; threads in their entirety to get a full perspective on this interesting debate.<br>
<br>
While you are articulate Robin, that doesn't conceal the fact that you are taking things out of context and/or not facing the facts.  Stating that Shintou's position exhibited intolerance was NOT a personal attack.  You're likening my statements to a cross-examination whereby a defense attorney attempts to discredit a witness by giving examples, which have nothing to do with the particular incident, of poor character.<br>
<br>
Yes, I commented that Shin's position was intolerant.  Shintou stated:<br>
<br>
&quot;Roleplayers and Non Roleplayers are two different animals. Completly Different.<br>
<br>
You can't have Males in the Female Bathroom, it just doesn't work.<br>
It just doesn't work.<br>
<br>
Get off our server.&quot;<br>
<br>
So how would you characterize and define the tone of the above statement?  He made MANY comments like this, and I just called a spade a spade.  Are comments like &quot;get off our server&quot; constructive?  Are the targets of comments like that just supposed to comply without voicing their thoughts and opinions?<br>
<br>
Now it's interesting that you are using these types of examples to twist my comments into personal attacks.  You just stated:<br>
<br>
&quot;This is just a personal attack, again. It adds nothing substantial to the argument, and it attacks Shintou's character, not his argument. It implies that he's got a psychological problem, and that's why he disagrees with you. It's also an attempt to position yourself above Shintou: &quot;I'm normal, Shintou's sociopathic.&quot;<br>
<br>
Okay, so by the virtue of your arguement, let's examine one of your quotes:<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE AUTOLINK START--><a href="http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.showMessageRange?topicID=229.topic&start=21&stop=40">pub94.ezboard.com/ffirion...21&stop=40</a><!--EZCODE AUTOLINK END--><br>
<br>
&quot;There is an underlying belief in the U.S. that &quot;freedom&quot; means freedom from social pressure to conform, and that any discursive regime that enforces social behavior is inherently evil, and I suspect your analysis of Shintou's opinion as being comparable to racism stems from this kind of thinking.&quot;<br>
<br>
Were you not using exactly the same tactic that you just rebuked, to discredit other points of views within that thread?  You gave an example of a line of thought that you hold to be flawed, and then drew a parallel between that example and the arguements that you wished to attack, thereby attempting to discredit the authors and thus all of their &quot;thinking&quot;.  This then places you upon a plateau of &quot;enlightened&quot; thinking untainted by the flawed rationalizations you just used to brand those you disagreed with.<br>
<br>
At any rate, to anyone who reads those threads, it should be clear that the majority of us were simply asking for a bit more tolerance and less ranting.  Unfortunately, some people became very defensive (which is somewhat understandable in the face of &quot;Get off our server&quot;) or tired of the endless rants and resorted to the personal comments.<br>
<br>
As I stated over and over in my posts on the subject, FV is large enough to accomodate all playstyles and there really isn't any point in fighting over it.  Likewise, discussions like this are stimulating, even if they are intense.<br>

<br>
You're comparing apples to oranges there, with my quote.<br>
<br>
I was doing a discursive analysis, trying to find the underlying cultural ideologies influencing your claims that Shintou's opinions were comparable to racism.  Even in your own post, you question whether that might be a stretch (and then discount that with &quot;I doubt it&quot;).  I was not trying to attack, or even question, your character, but trying to analyze at how you arrived at that particular conclusion (a conclusion I think is dubious, but you know that).<br>
<br>
Rhetorically speaking, saying someone is &quot;intolerant&quot; is an attempt to shut down the conversation.  You may say it's &quot;calling a spade a spade&quot;, but rhetorically, it's meant to cast the opposition as unreasonable and yourself as imminently reasonable.  There is no rational response to it beyond &quot;No, I'm not intolerant&quot;; it derails discussion of issues into discussion of character.<br>
<br>
While it's not as scurulous as calling someone the various other names that were flung around, it's still in the category of &quot;personal attack&quot;.<br>

<br>
Well, of course I disagree...<br>
<br>
Hehe I know my apples from my oranges, thank you, and your comment, though more subtle, fits within the context of the arguement you wove to villify my comments as personal attacks.<br>
<br>
I was purposeful in stating that Shintou's position was intolerant because, quite frankly, it was.  Telling people to pack up and leave because they fall into a certain category is far more egregious than calling them a &quot;turd&quot; or a &quot;madman&quot;.  Intolerance has no business being in EQ, let alone RL for that matter, and I felt I had to put up a sign and label it, perhaps for reasons similar to those that lead you to defend Shintou.<br>
<br>
Do I think Shin is a &quot;mentally defective&quot; or an intolerant ass in RL - far from it!  He is clearly an imaginative and passionate fella.  However as his statements become louder and more profane, it's only natural that his opponents cranked up the volume as well.<br>
<br>
As the threads progressed, some of his comments (on the anti-non-rp side) became far too volatile as did the counter-statements.  I do feel that you are using the &quot;slippery-slope&quot; tactic of drawing my comments down to the level of personal attacks.  If I stated that Shin was a fanatical rp-nazi, of course that is branding him directly and all that he says on the subject.  In contrast however, his statements were intolerant and anti-social - they left little or no room for discussion.  <br>
<br>
You used the &quot;American thinking&quot; axiom as a means to conduct a &quot;discursive analysis&quot; on my claims that Shin's comments were &quot;comparable racism&quot;.  <br>
<br>
First, jumping to the word racism (which did appear in my post) is sensationalist - there is a distinct difference between intolerance (which did apply) and racism (which did not apply) and I was very clear on that within the thread.  <br>
<br>
Second, would your means of discursive analysis seem so legitimate and inoffensive if I had used a &quot;Stalinist thinking&quot; model to analyse Shin's comments?  In that circumstance, you might be quick to state that such a reference is a &quot;personal attack&quot;.  The only difference is the sensationality of the point of reference...the mechanics, and aim, of the literary device however are the same:  i.e. Stalinst thinking = oppressive therefore your comments = oppressive...American thinking regarding freedom = flawed therefore your comments on freedom of expression = flawed.<br>
<br>
In truth, all comments aimed at an individual's thoughts and statements *could* be patternized as personal attacks using the slippery-slope apparatus.  The steps elevating counter-arguements above the baseness of personal attacks however, are formed from tact and subtlety.  There are times, however, where certain statements should be labelled bluntly.  And, that's what I did.<br>

Robin, I hope you don't take any of my responses as antagonistic or confrontational.  I totally agree with your quest towards civility - I espoused that &quot;Live and Let Live&quot; throughout my posts.<br>
<br>
If y'all wanna let sleeping dogs lie, I'm all for it.  I do find debating (as opposed to argueing, mud-slinging...) interesting so I'm all for that too.<br>
<br>
You have become better at pocket philosophy (3)!<br>
