<br>
Seven steps to heaven. Points 1 and 2 deal with rogue functionality, specifically with groups in mind. Points 3 and 4 deal with problems with raiding. 5 and 6 deal with wideneing the equipment choices of rogues. 7 is a sort of post script. The step I'd most like to see implemented is step 2.<br>
<br>
1) Assassinate should be like banish summoned. You choose to use it (you have a special button), if the mob is lower level than you it has a reasonable chance of success, the mob insta dies with no xp gain and no loot. Assassinate thus becomes a method of crowd control. It should be massive agro catcher and from behind only, meaning that you likely only get one shot at it and if the monster is a hard hitter a failed assassinate can easily mean death. This prevents it overpowering mezzes. Oh, and its only effective on humanoid (pickpocketable) mobs.<br>
<br>
2) Forget special tendonslicer attacks etc. Just make poisons MUCH simpler to use. <br>
<br>
a) Poisons should have only 2 ingredients; a vial and a poison ingredient. This means that you can make poisons &quot;on the fly&quot; as it were. i.e. you're hunting in random_zone_03 and a poison ingredient drops and you can immediately turn that ingredient into a poison without having to run to the bank to get the right vial or other ingredients, and without logging off to trawl through poison recipes.<br>
<br>
b) There should be only 1 type of vial which is used for ALL poisons, thus ensuring that a rogue can carry enough vials around with him at any one time.<br>
<br>
c) Poison making should be less like a tradeskill and more like any the apply poison skill. You should not have to spend hours sitting in PoK doing combines in order to use a skill that is so central to your class.<br>
<br>
d) The vial must be stackable. The ingredient must be stackable. The poison does not have to be stackable since you make them as and when you need them.<br>
<br>
[The idea is that rogue_01 walks around with 10 stacks of vials in his bag. He gets a group, let's say in PoD. The mobs drop a poison ingredient. As the ingredients drop, he should be able to turn those ingredients into poisons. Being able to do this should NOT require that you are a grandmaster poisoner and should NOT require that you have spent hours farming other ingredients and should NOT require that you can remember what the hell the other ingredients are.]<br>
<br>
NB: for those of you worried that your GM poison making should be devalued, the GM poison item can still summon the vials. Everyone else will have to make vials or buy them at a pp a go. Everyone else will have to carry stacks of vials around with them. GM poison makers will not. BUT THERE SHOULD STILL ONLY BE ONE TYPE OF VIAL.<br>
<br>
3) Give rogues (and possibly other melees) an improved parry AA which gives you a much more effective parry that ONLY funtions against ripostes.<br>
<br>
4) Give rogues (and possibily other melees) an improved resistance AA or discipline which dramatically increases AE resistance for a relatively long period of time (one or two mins or more?).<br>
<br>
5) Improve availability of good daggers (not the best daggers, I'm thinking around 12, 13, 14 or 15 damage) AND make ragebringer range slot equipable. Making ragebringer equipable in range slot means that those rogues who can't get hold of other 41 haste items can still play around with their offhand slot. At the moment I wield a decent (14-20) piercer in mainhand that I'm happy with and ragebringer offhand and I absolutly cannot replace either. If ragebringer was range slot equipable, I could play around with my offhand a lot more, perhaps get *gasp* a slashing weapon, or something with a handy proc =)<br>
<br>
6) Make throwing equal to archery. It isn't so hard. Insert some range slot items that summon very good throwing items that have high enough damage to be comparable with archery. Sort of like the bag that summons shissar fangs. Some of these items should be tradeskillable, meaning that they will be acquireable to those that aren't high end raiding.<br>
<br>
7) Review damage. If all the above points 1 to 6 were implemented, I'm not certain that rogues would need more damage increases. But it's worth a look.<br>

Of the three pure melees, they are the ones that fit their role the best.  Warriors are the ones that desperately need some attention, especiallly in the taunt and agro areas.<br>
<br>
1.  Assinate is just fine the way it is.  It actually has some use in the game, though it's minor.<br>
<br>
2. Poisons are not for everyday xp.  They're for specific high level raid targets.  Making them everyday would be bad and would definitely unblance a ton of existing encounters.  You don't need them for xp.  You don't even really need them for raid targets, but for the raid targets, the existing effort vs. reward makes them quite viable already.<br>
<br>
3. Nix the better tanking for rogues.  You're tops at backline damage.  Learn not to flip things if you don't want to take damage.<br>
<br>
4. Nix the better resists for melee.  It's pretty easy to get 100 base in all resists just through gear.  If you work at it, you can top 170 in all resists.  Mine are about 150-180 in normal everyday fighting gear.  Get your resists up and you don't need any special babysitting to resist AE.<br>
<br>
5. Nice daggers are plentiful enough -- too plentiful.  I'm all for rogues doing good damage, but gearing 'em is easier than warrior or monk already.  Be nice if you could upgrade any epic to make it usuable in the charm slot, no way should the rogue epic be instantly range-slot.  It's one of the easiest epics to do and has great longevity.  It doesn't need more without making it a lot harder to attain.<br>
<br>
6. YES!  I like this one.  All the pure melee should get AAs similar to endless quiver.  It's not as if we'd do outrageous damage that way or even damage anywhere close to a ranger, but it would sure give us more options for our range slot.  This is really a monk problem and not a rogue, though.  Rogues and wars can use a primal bow, for instance, and have great stats and a nice pull toy all in one.<br>
<br>
7. I think rogue damage is fine already.  Y'all are by far on the top of the charts there.  I'd be more inclined to ask for ways for rogues to decrease agro than increase damage.  I do think that the highest DPS should go to those that have more risk though.  Rogues should easily top rangers, who can stand off and plink with little risk.  If they're not, that's a problem. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showUserPublicProfile?gid=rhatha>Rhatha</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Elder Animist of Shar Vahl<br>Swiftclaw wants fish!<br></span><br>  Posts: 1225<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(6/4/03 5:13 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm43.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=222.topic&index=2>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://darklance.freewebspace.com/images/rhatha.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Some comments</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>Get your resists up and you don't need any special babysitting to resist AE<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>

That used to be true.  With the stuff we fight now I can't resist a damn thing.  Some of the upper end PoP AEs are nasty.  I personally think some of them, and AE rampage as well, are overdone, I hate fights where I can't feasibly go whack things.. and it's worse for pure melee. <p><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://darklance.freewebspace.com/images/Rhatha_sig.jpg" style="border:0;height:270;width:399;"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--><br>

Easy solution:  Make an AA, 5 levels, pretty expensive, that adds 2 to the level of assassinateable mobs per point, so you could assassinate up to level 56 after spending a lot of AAs.  Then flag boss mobs, like Venril Sathir and such, as non-assassinateable.  This way assassinate would work at 65 the way it does at 60... when fighting lower level mobs (which are not the best for exp, but you might fight them anyway) you occassionally just waste the target for quick exp and a good laugh from your group.  It would restore assassinate to its original use... only useable in lower exp situations (since you'd do better in places with higher level mobs) but fun when it happens, and certainly not overpower.  An AA called Anatomy or similar that let you assassinate non humanoids would be fun too... again, some mobs must be flagged as unassassinateable, to avoid rediculus farming situations (we don't want 65 rogues one shotting Vox)<br>
<br>
2)  Poisons.  Honestly, I think most are fine but too weak.  The dex debuff poisons from both old and new world poisons are great... they don't do a ton on their own but they stack with cripple, making them nice for raids.  They can't land on everything... you need to pick your targets well (on my guild page I'm making a list now of targets I can land poisons on) but they have an effect.  The new resist debuff poison is also great... lowers all resists by 10 (not that amazing) but stacks with everything, so that's helpful.  The damage poisons stink though... who wants to farm for hours to get a few 555 DD one shot poisons when I can backstab for up to 2056 on a double hit?  These need to do a lot more damage.  I'd also change the resists on one shot points... make them -50 poison check or something, so they work when you want them to work, but only once.  The slow and snare poisons also need to last a lot longer... it's really sad when you land a 50% slow 50% snare poison, and it lasts for 1 tick.  But I do like that it's a hard to use tradeskill, with some benefits up top.  <br>
<br>
PoP poisons need to last longer though... they don't work in exp situations at all.  I mean come on, the last batch of oozing iritation I made cost me 600pp with failures.  With 10 charges of 15 minutes each, that's 4pp per minute, not including time spent to combine and farm.  Now compare that to a shaman casting avatar, the component version, which is I think about 15pp for 6 minutes, so 2-3pp per minute for more damage with no farming time, or a cleric casting Virtue, which is cheap as all hell.  Come on, risk vs. reward!<br>
<br>
One easy solution for PoP poisons, of course, would be questable endless decanters for various poisons.  We've got part of the quest already... require the black marble mortar and pestle (which is currently costly and useless) and the master sketch (god that was a lot of work just to be able to make RoI and DoD), and make endless PoP style poisons a reality after an epic style quest.<br>
<br>
3.  Bah, repostes hurt... don't get hit by them.  That's where skill is needed.<br>
<br>
4.  I've actually thought giving rogues an Uncanny Dodge style ability (D&amp;D rip off, I know), that would let us apply our dodge skill to AoEs and Damage Shields.  It would make rogues far more viable in PvP (which they could sure use... it's embarasing to be beaten by AFK druids, okay?) as well as letting us get into the fight in PoP encounters where currently all we can do is sit back and shoot with a bow (go go 30 DPS).  Monks should have this one too.  I'd imagine it would let a person dodge about 40% of them at top level... not enough to allow you to ignore AoEs (which would trivialize high end content) but enough to make it worthwhile to let the rogues fight.  <br>
<br>
5.  Yes, rogue itemization needs work at high level.  It's fine at this level, actually... but needs work farther up.  But the Ragebringer Curse is tough.  Make it rangeable and rogue can no longer use range items, it'll just move the same problem to a different slot.  Best thing I can think of is a few rogue only very tough quests that result in items with Seething Fury, which go in other slots, and then not let the effects stack with other Seething Furies.  That would let rogues get Ragebringer out of that slot and use better ratio weapons again.  As it is, we can't bank our epic until we've got Bloodbath or better for our offhand, and that's a little much.<br>
<br>
6.  Throwing shouldn't equal archery... they are two different skills, and should remain as such.  But it would be nice for throwing to have SOME advantage of archery for rogues, and have a few niceities for monks as well.  Let's face it, we're given fun throwing skills (250 throwing, crits and deadly strikes), but bows still beat throwers across the board, except in the case of the Shissar bag.  Solution:  allow the use of throwing weapons in the ammo slot while another range item is in range slot.  This gives throwing a unique advantage... you're not restricted to using a bow.  Still much less damage and range, but it means you could have better stats in that slot.  Endless bandolier would be nice, of course, as would the two other rogue abilities that are in game but unavailable (use alt act # to find them), namely quick throw and I believe long throw.  But bow damage and range should be better... throwers should just have something to make 'em useful.<br>
<br>
7)  Rogues bring damage to the table.  That's what we do, and it's nearly all we do right now.  If we have other things to bring, okay that's fine, but Damage and a little CR is all we got right now, and when we get outdamaged by rangers beastlords mages and wizards, all of whom bring many other things, we have a problem.  Yes, we need either more damage or more utility.  SoS was a good start on rogue utility, though.<br>

Non-tanking warrior catching agro = mob turns = mob ripostes = dead rogue. Not a lot I can do about that.<br>

<br>
If you get a ranger and a rogue with similar equipment and AAs (and the ranger has EQ/AM3, maybe even AM2), the ranger will outdamage the rogue easily if said mob isn't touching a wall.  And, I believe similar damage even if mob is touching a wall (not totally sure on this, I quit worrying about my DPS after my last weapon upgrade...probably won't parse again until next upgrade).<br>
<br>
As far as weapons, there are few weapons that will outdamage rogue epic.  13/18 pokers in NToV, APMB, Rei's, Tor Vingus, BB, Khal...that's about it until like tier 3 mobs in PoP.  Many classes epics seem to be easier to bag/bank than rogues epic, imo.  Seething Fury is a great effect, I just wish there was a BS mod or better ratio on Ragebringer.<br>
<br>
But, I so enjoy SoS and Escape now and would/could live with less DPS if we could get a few more utility uses.<br>
<br>
As far as aggro reducing, there is an AA that refreshes the evade/hide key faster.  Hastened Stealth.<br>

I was thinking of all pre-PoP.  A ton of the PoP AEs have completely outrageous -resists to them, like -300 or so.  That's ridiculous.  It completely removes all pure mele from the fight unless each one has his own personal healer.  Fat chance there.  An AE like that turns the encounter into one MT inside the AE with all healers on him plus a bunch of ranged damage all outside the AE.<br>
<br>
If you can't do ranged damage for that fight and can't heal, you might as well just /afk or camp. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showUserPublicProfile?gid=decius1@firionavie>Decius1</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 462<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(6/18/03 5:18 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm43.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=222.topic&index=8>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> re</span><hr size=1> Yeah I heard nightmare stories of rogues doing nothing on a raid except shooting arrows from outside of AE. Pretty worrying, I thought. Recently, however, I read something that SOE might have addressed this problem... but you'll have to ask someone mroe knowledgeable to be sure.<br>

Putting ragebringer in range slot isn't about upping DPS. It's about increasing the variety of rogue equipment. After all, variety is the spice of life. Most rogues get their epics in the early to mid 50s. They will probably be using their epic in their mainhand for a long time. When they do eventually get an upgrade, ragebringer moves straight to offhand. That's the stage I'm at now. I will probably never change my weapons. There's no question of swapping in other weapons just for the heck of it; I have to have my main hand piercer for backstabs, and I have to have ragebringer in range slot for haste. I know I'm slightly unusual because I had above par gear from early on, but throughout all of Shackleton's 55 levels, I've only ever used 4 weapons. I'm beginning to run on, but essentially the reason I would like to see ragebringer range slottable is not because it would up my dps. It would have very little effect on my dps. I want to be able to play around with weapon choices. Mainhand restricted by having to be high damage piercer, offhand taken up with ragebringer = no fun for me <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
