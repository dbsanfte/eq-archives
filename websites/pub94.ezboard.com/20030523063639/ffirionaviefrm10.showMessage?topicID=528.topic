It is far from finished though. Please return to check on her welfare in the near future. ~NoirDaila<br>
<br>
<br>
     The dusty smell of old scrolls filled her nostrils and she sneezed for the tenth time in the last three hours. The bruises she wears as a banner are but one of the signs of the punishment she must endure for breaking the rules. She must also alphabetize the library; these were her punishments for being negligent in her studies. <br>
<br>
    Lord Innoruuk blessed her with the gift of healing. Naeneori could think of nothing but the rages of battle, the feel of cold steel in her hand and her enemies blood raining down from the sky. Healers do not fight though, as her Master plainly told her on the many occasions he found her among the warriors. Lord Innoruuks gift was wasted on her, so they said. Clerics cannot fight anymore than warriors can heal. Its simple, but she refused to accept it. <br>
<br>
     Naeneori sat back on the dusty floor, scrolls falling from her hand as she recalled the previous day, the reason for her punishment. <br>
<br>
     A simple training exercise for the warriors, of course she could join, as long as she healed them as well. She grabbed a shield and mace, and then charged into the frenzy of battle. Raising the mace high over hear head, she battled her foes along side the warriors she always dreamed of following. Seeing one of them stagger in pain, she called Lord Innoruuks power and asked for her companions wounds to fade. Blood and sweat ran down her face as she felt the power of the Gods flow through her body. Seeing an enemy try to strike another of her companion, she called Innoruuks Wrath and felled him where he stood. The power flowing through her body was enhanced by the blood and the scent of battle. The same questions swam in her mind that always did when this feeling overtook her. If Innoruuk had not intended for her to fight this way, why was it so fulfilling for her to do so? Was she given the desire to fight only to deny it? <br>
<br>
     Footsteps in the hall woke her from her musings, but she was left with the questions swimming in her mind. “I must get back to this task if I am ever to get done with enough time to practice my spells today.” Sneezing for the eleventh time, she quickly filed the scrolls away in their proper places. <br>
<br>
     Glancing down at her robe, she realized she was filthy from the dusty library floors. <br>
<br>
“This will never do” <br>
<br>
    It was common practice for the newer clerics to live their training days in the guildhall. Naeneori returned to the room she shared with several other clerics and quickly changed her robes. <br>
<br>
“Women must always be clean and proper” Her mothers words echoed in her mind. <br>
<br>
     If her mother had seen her yesterday, she would faint. Naeneori smiled to herself at that thought and quickly walked out to the training grounds to practice her spells. She does not wish to be punished again. The call of battle is strong in her, but the threat of a worse punishment is stronger. The hunting grounds were one of Naeneori's favorite places to be. She could watch everyone else fight while she herself practiced her healing arts. Standing back from the fight, she would call Innoruuks grace to mend the wounds of those in battle. The occasional foe that encountered her quickly felt the sting of her mace upon his brow and Innoruuks wrath upon his dead soul. <br>
<br>
     To those who saw her, Naeneori may have appeared a woman possessed. Standing in the middle of battle, sparks flying from her fingers, her mace raining down upon her enemy and a smile never leaving her face. Her eyes gleaming with the pure hate that only the true disciples of Innoruuk could possess, she turned from one fight to another, showing no mercy. <br>
<br>
     She dreamed of the day the Light Skinned Ones would come before her, their weakness showing as they fell before her might, or groveled for their lives at her feet. In the name of Lord Innoruuk, in the name of Hate, she would slay them all. <br>
<br>
     As the sun climbs the sky, then falls to the horizon, Naeneori sighs deeply and makes her way back to Neriak. It is time to wash up and get ready for the night. <br>
<br>
     Nighttime in Neriak is a truly wondrous thing. The true evil of Neriak comes out, dragging their skeletons behind them. The Shadowknights and the Necromancers. The ones everyone fears, the ones who train in ways she could never know. She had always been interested in the ways of these individuals, the Shadowknights in particular. Their lives are given to the sword, yet they possess the wondrous evil only the keepers of the undead can possess. Naeneori could only pray that she would one day be considered that evil. <br>
<br>
     She reached the entrance of the cleric guild just in time to see them pass to go to the training grounds. Having just returned from their studies, their faces set in grim lines, etched with Hate and belief that Lord Innoruuk would bless them all and banish all of their foes. Wonderfully handsome men and proud beautiful women, Naeneori gazed at them until they passed, then went to bed. <br>
<br>
     Parents turn their children over to guild houses as soon as they show a potential in an art. Naeneori knew at a very young age that she was supposed to be a cleric, yet she hid it. Her desire to wield a sword was so strong; she tried to convince herself of her path as a warrior. <br>
<br>
     One dark evening, a very young Naeneori’s parent found her in the training grounds healing the warriors instead of fighting along side them. Quickly, they sent her to the clerics guild house. Their anger over Naeneori’s deception is still evident today. Her once indulgent father is now cool and refuses to go against her mother. Women rule Neriak and its founding families are lead by all women, it is not so odd that Naeneori’s family is this same way. <br>
<br>
     As all good children do, Naeneori visits her parents as often as her studies permit. They understand her studies must keep her away, but it is expected, within the guild house, that she make time to go see them. Today was that day. Of course, they have heard tales of their daughter fighting among the warriors and being beaten and reprimanded by her guild master as a result. Naeneori almost dares breach the boundaries of insubordination and not visit her parents, or worse yet, lie to them and leave early. <br>
<br>
     She can hear the clang of the swords from the Arena at her parents doorstep. It takes every ounce of willpower she has to knock on the door. The door is opened at the same time Naeneori’s gaze is drawn to the Arena by a victory cry. She never felt the door open, but she felt her Mother strong hand across her face. <br>
<br>
     The door slammed in her face with the words “You will never change” billowing out around them.<br>
<br>
     Now, fair Naeneori was presented with a problem. If she returned to the guild house, she would be beaten soundly then given some horribly menial task to teach her mind to focus instead of wander as she saw fit. If Naeneori went to the Arena, as she was so drawn to do, she would be found out and her punishment would be even more severe. She stood there for a brief heartbeat and then quietly slipped away. She would go to the training grounds, she may be punished for that, but she would have learned more. She would be that much closer to being able to walk away from the guild house and Neriak and not return. <br>
<br>
     She could have no idea how these thought could be her downfall, but I will tell you that part of the story later. <br>
<br>
     To Naeneori’s surprise, not a word was said about her infraction. She could feel the eyes of the Masters on her, but they never spoke a word. &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp  <br>
