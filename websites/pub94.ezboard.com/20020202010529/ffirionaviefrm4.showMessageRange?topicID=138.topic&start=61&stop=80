<br>
the thing that gets me biac...is i didnt see you on any of our guild raids, getting any of those gems that i am charging people so much for...<br>
<br>
you bitching like this is so annoying to me, because you gained so much from being in our guild, yet all you did was solo, not even making an attempt to group with the members.<br>
i dont recall you giving me 2k pp for jewelry, you bought 2k jewelry from me maybe, but i can promise you i dont sell jewelry to members unless it is at my cost to make it, or below it. sure i sell jewelry to non members for a little profit, but not too much.<br>
<br>
akane and belika bitching at us...well...they can say what they want. we dont exactly see eye to eye right now, but im glad they found a home and i hope they have fun with everquest and stop flaming us so much. at least in their case they do have a right to flame the guild, they did put alot into this guild after all....they donated countless thousands of pp to my jewelry skill to help me max it,and many many items. i can't say im happy about the things they say about us, but you wont see me flaming them back, they are entitled to say a few bad things about us, i just hope it stops soon.<br>
<br>
but for you biacicia? i have no respect for you and i hope you enjoy soloing or whatever it is that you do  to have fun in eq( cuz it obviously isn't raiding, afterall you didnt come to any raids)<br>
<br>
as for belika...the things he says about us arent true, and he has a new guild now so i really dont see why he says them about us...but like i said he did give alot to this guild so he is entitled to whine some.<br>
<br>
as for akane... again the things he says about us arent true...but if i were in his shoes i probably would have left the guild also to be in the same guild as my RL friend. my rl friends are the most important thing to me in eq, and you can rest assured whatever guild they are in, i will be too. as i said he gave alot to this guild so he is also entitled to complaining about us, i just hope it stop soon.<br>
<br>
as for tiesto... well i dont agree with him leaving the guild, but i do have respect for him at least. not having the freedom to say what you want to say is a pain in the ass...but i think he interpreted what i had to say wrongly. but oh well.<br>
<br>
p.s. the cash that i get extra from the 50pp for the resist jewelry was going towards buying everyone in guild that didnt have them j boots....and then it was going towards paying thousands and thousands for shrunken goblin skull earrings...because we need those 2 items to do many creatures successfully. thx. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=caparelli>caparelli</A> at: 12/4/01 6:09:37 am<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ubakofv.showPublicProfile?language=EN>BakoFV</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_lightning.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 72<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(12/4/01 6:08:56 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Did someone hack Fire and Fury's Website?</span><hr size=1> what kinda friends that you have that would only pick you up when your car is broke down if you give them loot?<br>

The main reason Belika can join FaF is because he is Akane RL friend.<br>
Belika's action is not acceptable in FaF, so he got kick out.<br>
I think it is the best example to show that why FaF don't want to guild all other members' RL friend, because the leader and officers don't know them much.<br>
<br>
Hmmm, breaking our own rule to let Cidd to join?<br>
Quote from Requirements of joining:<br>
&gt;&gt;p.s. some exceptions may be made to these rules, and only we will make the decision to do so. dont expect it to happen often and never assume we will make an exception for you, unless there is a VERY good reason. &lt;&lt;<br>
Exception is here, I don't see them broke the rule.<br>

  <br>
  And we are raid'ing Hate each week because no one else has asked for a chance, and how do we do higher end things in crafted and other quest armor. The planes are an upper level armor upgrade, we can do them now, so why not do them. It will let us do other things.<br>

<br>
1. I never grouped with Bia. It isn't because I didn't try. I sent her alot of tells and she often was unreachable.<br>
<br>
2. People who did group with Bia claim she ditched a group during CR. bad form.<br>
<br>
3. Bia is not planar level but complains she did not receive planar gem resist gear. tough. <br>
<br>
4. The people that I saw get resist gear from the first raid were on pull team or received little or nothing else from the raid because of bad luck, or the fact their armor doesnt drop in hate.<br>
<br>
5. Bia left guild NOT 60 SECONDS after elder spiritist arms dropped in Karnor and they were not awarded to her. She wasn't there, and as said before, she didn't group with guildmates often.<br>
<br>
I can honestly say I still have respect for Bia, because thats the kind of guy I am, but it isn't easy. It's kinda a &quot;she's another human being playing a game&quot;, so I guess at least she has that going for her.<br>
<br>
I hope whatever guild she joins coddles her and gives her whatever she wants so that she doesn't ditch them too.<br>

<br>
I do not believe anyone in guild is selling things on ebay or char auctions. I can however tell you this.<br>
<br>
Belika was removed because he was indignant to guildmates. <br>
<br>
Belika was indignant to me in my mid 30s and was the reason I did not apply for f and f at that time. Over time, as I grouped more and more with f and f people, and some shaman quest items dropped, when no shaman was in group, I suggested they give he items to Belika becasue in my limited knowledge of f and f at the time, I thought Belika was their only shaman. After that, I sent tells trying to bridge a gap and received a little bit more pleasant conversation that 'You are an ass' and 'You are an idiot'.<br>
<br>
Belika was very angry for being removed from f and f and in striking back, messed with the guild's message board. He says it is his right, well ok.<br>
<br>
Further, from being friends with Bako, Belika and Akane were able to get personal info on Bako and posted as him wherever in mock auctions, selling eq stuff for cash, in an attempt to defame.<br>
<br>
In my opinion , what Belika and Akane did there was criminal. It's called identity theft. <br>
<br>
It is not Belika's intent to educate, but rather to harass, because his feelings are hurt.<br>
<br>
Unlike Bia, I have little respect for Belika because his intent is to injure people outside of game. This is not roleplaying as it extends outside the game.<br>
<br>
Belika needs friends, but friends of Belika beware. The instant you voice your displeasure with his ways he will injure you too.<br>
<br>
That is it. <br>
<br>
No conspiracy.<br>
<br>
We are defending ourselves from a devious human being.<br>
<br>
And now his arms are flailing.<br>
<br>
And I think it's great.<br>
<br>
momma should have taught him better. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/uheagan.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Heagan</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 11<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(12/4/01 3:00:08 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Did someone hack Fire and Fury's Website?</span><hr size=1> Yes, Bia, what I say is truth and I can communicate it without resoting to words like 'idiot' , 'noob', and 'dipshit'.<br>

That's ok in this public forum where no one knows different or cares.<br>
<br>
In truth I'm an experienced player. with alot of online time. I have spent alot of time on boards like this, disputing allegations like this, because I am online often and know whats up.<br>
<br>
I have a working knowledge of this game and how it works. It is never my intention to mislead or misinform. I am capable of handling myself and expressing my opinion without vulgar language.<br>
<br>
I am an educated human being, and a compassionate one with the ability to see when others are not so sincere, and even when they are sincere but misled, themselves.<br>
<br>
You can't discredit me because you have no starting point. 'You can't dig because you have no shovel'. 'You have no back because your head is attached to your butt'.<br>
<br>
I AM 'back'.<br>
<br>
I see what you do. I see what Belika does. I didn't have to be in f and f to see what was going on. It was apparent enough.<br>
<br>
Now I am in f and f. If I thought people were doing things I didn't agree with I wouldn't be in f and f. I joined f and f at level 51 because they are my peers. Being in f and f does not change the way I am.<br>
<br>
Your facts are distorted, bia. Your motives are not pure as the driven snow, Bia. You cap it off with expressions of inflamation, Bia. Quit while you're ahead. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ubiaciciafv.showPublicProfile?language=EN>BiaciciaFV</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 27<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(12/4/01 4:01:28 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   uhh?</span><hr size=1> <br>
Listen,  I think you have it backwards, i dont care how much exp you have, wether you shower, or shave your back........you were not in the guild when this was going on, the ebay crap happened, a week b4 you were a member and thats all youve been a member....you got your BP cleric plane drop 30 min after joining you should stick up for them<br>
<br>
you defend your mates all you want, truth be told as i posted earlier i like most of them, and have heppled some since i quit<br>
<br>
<br>
i quit because of the rules violations, the officers were not inforcing....<br>
<br>
i left because of  lossing members like erys and tiesto, <br>
because the officers wouldnt enforce the rules, simply because ermok is lvl 54.... thats what im talking about,....../.what the hell are you talking about?<br>
<br>
if you cant offer anything which you cant,/ ( not because your no the all powerfull supper dood) but simply because  you weren there,.....and i meant the noob ass kissing thing  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ubakofv.showPublicProfile?language=EN>BakoFV</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_lightning.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 73<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(12/4/01 4:22:00 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Did someone hack Fire and Fury's Website?</span><hr size=1> This conversation is really getting no where, hence why people cant come and discuss things in a civil manner is beyond me.<br>

Sheep? lol Deja Vu there, for all who know about sheep on Morell Thule , You get that joke <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
I dont recall you ever having a conversation to me about someone ebaying Tiesto, I really dont Or I would have looked into it sooner. I actually dont remember anything like that. <br>
<br>
As for Bia, Well I just really hope you get all your anger out here. I have always found you to be a nice and wonderful person, doesnt seem like you posting here.<br>
<br>
We did NOT charge people for Resist jewlery on first raid. The policy was decided on AFTER the first raid. And again its only 50plat.<br>
<br>
Yes there is about 1k left over from the 2 raids combined. Its called a Guild bank, any leader or officer will tell you its something done with every guild.<br>
<br>
I have NEVER sold an item through email, ebay, player auction or any method type like that for Platinum or Real life money on this server or any other. I have not even sold an item in game for platinum on this server. I have rarely sell items for plat in game on my other servers.<br>
<br>
Im not angry mad or see anyone as someone I need to fight against, but I do wish for this to end. I hope it does.<br>
