<br>
Good day, or night, or evening, or morning, to all who find this message and a thank you to all who bother to spend enough of their time perusing the following.<br>
<br>
My name is Shraigon, and to spare my life story (as well as what little writing space I have) I shall attempt to make this brief. I am a decently-seasoned Khati Sha, and to those of you who have not been keeping up with the going-ons of Shar Vahl lately (which would be most of you, as my kind was never the most exciting) that means I am a Vah Shir lord of beasts.<br>
<br>
I grow bored of travelling and working alone, and now seek company, be it in the form of a temporary drinking buddy, an ally, or even maybe a guild or association.<br>
<br>
My message, as short and simple as possible. Which, for me, is never very short. I hope that anyone who happens to come across this would maybe consider keeping an eye out for or perhaps even contacting me.<br>
<br>
I would prefer if those who respond are good in their intent, but in the end it matters not one's alignment.<br>
<br>
Have a pleasent day, or evening, or morning, or night, and may your progress be much more entertaining than mine.<br>
<br>
<br>
(Simply put, it's a Vah Shir Beastlord of the 32nd level. Things have gotten dull, and seeing as how I rarely come across any good RPers, I decided to post here in hopes that a few would come to me. Those that respond MUST be decent at RPing, meaning none of that U, R, or Y stuff. Alignment doesn't matter, but I do have preferences regarding it. Also, I'm fluent in all but one language, so all races free to send a tell) <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showUserPublicProfile?gid=zotrethz>Zotreth Z</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#A62A2A>(2/12/03 2:26 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm42.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=258.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: I seek aid or company.</span><hr size=1> Before she spies the advertisement placed by her own Master Morgrist, Zotreth stands on tippy toes, intrigued by the interesting hand-writing.

&quot;hmm...

&quot;In the name of the Fellowship, I wish to greet you Shraigon, and invite you to seek solace and companionship within our halls.  As an association of followers of the light and balance, we strive to assist each other in the various battles and difficulties we all face as residents of Norrath and Luclin.  <br>
<br>
We are an allied group of nine guilds with different banners and strengths.  Hence, there are several options for which `family' you can investigate and seek to join.  If you wish to know more, I would suggest visiting our halls((<!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://pub69.ezboard.com/bthefellowship62953" target="top">click here</a><!--EZCODE LINK END-->)) and getting to know us.<br>

He gives a loud whistle, and from the corner a medium-sized tiger pads its way over to him. Attempting to shift his weight, he loses his balance and falls flat onto his bottom, facing the warder*<br>
<br>
&quot;Sho... didjha see anyone, Emaria?&quot;<br>
<br>
*The warder lowers its head, almost as if mourning its fate with the Beastlord. Through the growls and hisses of the Vah Shir tongue, it comments on the one it managed to spot perusing the message earlier*<br>
<br>
&quot;Go'cha. Thahnks, Em.&quot;<br>
<br>
*With a dismissive wave, he stands up. The warder raises onto its hind legs, digging its claws into his pants. It growls, feeling a bit annoyed*<br>
<br>
&quot;Ohwkay, o'kee... I'll getcha shome milk later, ahright?&quot;<br>
<br>
*The warder gives a satisfied nod, then disappears. Wobbling, the Vah Shir makes his way up the stairs, tilting his head back to take another swig of Short Ale. He loses his footing and falls backwards down the stairs*<br>
