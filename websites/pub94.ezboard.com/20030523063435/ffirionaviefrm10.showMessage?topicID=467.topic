Jaenu Stormsong is the father of the Ledenyetz Troupe’s Uinin Stormsong.  While Uinin is slowly making a name for himself on Norrath and Luclin, his father lives a life of quiet retirement in a simple hut in Kelethin.  Jaenu was widely regarded as one the best battle bards of his time, minstrels and loremasters that specialized in gleaning important lessons from the tales and legends of heroes past.  Smart generals regularly consulted with their bards before making command decisions, weighing the experience of those before him.<br>
<br>
The tale below relates the tale of the fabled Siege of Thurgadin, where the meager forces of the General Lu Bu’Ving made a heroic last stand against the combined might of the Ry’Gorr orcs and the frost giants of Velious.  The rearguard was decimated by the final assault, but relief forces were able to sweep up the weakened attackers and save the Dwarven city.<br>
<br>
It is worth noting that history remembers the name of Hattori Frostminer as the hero of the campaign, and not the ill-fated Bu’Ving. ))<br>
<br>
The rising sun was obscured by the smoke of a thousand campfires, casting a flickering gray pall on the early morning.  The beleaguered soldiers huddled outside of their tents, haggard faces breathing in the bittersweet relief of a new dawn.  Dull eyes surveyed the field, preparing to stave off another wave of attacks in defense of the diminishing dream of returning home to their families.<br>
<br>
Hungry and exhausted, the pikemen sat beside their simple weapons.  Trained to act as a living wall against the advancing orc horde, the peasants dreamed of the simple farm lives they were uprooted from.  Between them and oblivion stood a simple birch rod, sharpened and sturdy.  Alone, a pikeman stood no chance against a determined foe… as a cohesive unit they stood a slim chance of seeing the next pale dawn.<br>
<br>
In the center of the ragged camp huddled the corps of archers. A collection of mismatched farmers and woodsmen, the longbowmen rained death upon the orcs from the back lines.  In the relative safety of the high ground, the bowmen unleashed hell in the form of thousands of arrows, slaughtering untold numbers of the blue-skinned menace before they reached the pikes at the front.<br>
<br>
The battle had raged for the days outside of the Great Divide.  As the Ry’Gorr orcs advanced, the united tribes banded together to turn back the horde.  As the days passed however, the defenders of Thurgadin came to the grim realization that their supply lines to Thurgadin had been cut by frost giants.  Cut off from support and facing overwhelming odds, the defenders hunkered down, determined to outlast the siege and defend the narrow pass at all costs.<br>
<br>
Food was running low, resulting in widespread and draconian rationing of supplies.  Morale was at a dangerous low, as the men struggled through the hunger and biting cold in the face of overwhelming odds.  The howling winds of Velious were barely held at bay by the raging bonfires each night, and the sobbing of men resigned to their fate were scarcely drowned put by the moaning of the dying on the snow-swept fields of the Eastern Wastes.<br>
<br>
The general’s charger nervously pranced in the swirling snow.  Lu Bu’ving, Paladin of  Rallos Zek, struggled to control the beast while looking down his nose at the footmen below him.<br>
<br>
“Stormsong!” he barked, wheeling his steed to face an Elvin bard in field plate.  “Stormsong, I need your guidance!”<br>
<br>
The green clad bard glanced idly over his shoulder, grinning and nodding to show his acknowledgement as he continued to tune his compatriot’s lute.<br>
<br>
“Be right with you boss,” he quipped, oblivious to the rush of color darkening his employer’s face. “Just making sure your minstrels are ready to record your Grace’s heroism in the face of adversity, milord.”<br>
<br>
The scorn in the bard’s voice was scarcely concealed.  Already having been scolded for his celebration of the common foot soldier in his last ballad, Jaenu was not high on Bu’Ving’s list of favorites at the moment.  The paladin began choking on his anger, sputtering as his face twisted around the acid words stuck in his throat.<br>
<br>
Jaenu casually plucked the lute string, grimaced, and tightened it a tiny bit.  Finally satisfied, he handed it to the young half-elven female and wheeled to face Bu’Ving.  <br>
<br>
‘Now, sir, you were saying?”<br>
<br>
Bu’Ving growled deep in his throat, eyes flashing in fiery rage.  Leather creaked and groaned as he gripped his reins.  Through gritted teeth, he practically spat the words at the insolent bard.<br>
<br>
“Remember your place, jester.  I have come to you to ask you for more pearls of wisdom from the past. <br>
<br>
“After all,” he drawled sarcastically, making a sweeping gesture over the ragged, dispirited camp. “Your ‘wisdom’ has served us so well thus far.  No food, no wood, cut off from Thurgadin, and facing overwhelming odds.  Our archers have no arrows, and you somehow convinced me to burn all our wood in the night with a thousand campfires!”<br>
<br>
Bu’Ving spat in the snow as his steed danced nervously.  “I ought to have my head examined listening to you!  Well, tell me now bard, how are we to fend off the next attack with no ammunition?  Perhaps you will compose a sonnet that will lay waste to the Ry’Gorr?”<br>
<br>
If Jaenu took offense at the tirade, it did not show.  Instead, he cocked his head to the side and grinned broadly.<br>
<br>
“Ah.  The loss of the wood was unfortunate, but necessary.  At night, the extra campfires made your numbers appear larger to the Ry’Gorr.  Perhaps, just perhaps, that is why the orcs never attacked last night?  Only now are they realizing just how few we are, but we’ve seen that they are reluctant to mount an offensive under the sun.”<br>
<br>
Bu’Ving’s lieutenant, a towering barbarian known as Thorion, mulled over Jaenu’s words with an almost audible intensity.  “Perhaps you have given us an extra night, bard.  But at what cost?  What good is a good night’s sleep if it only serves to set us up for the slaughter at the next moonrise?”<br>
<br>
Bu’Ving smirked from atop his mount.  “Yes, Stormsong.  Pray tell, what miracle can you pull from the annals of history to save us now?  What good have your magical fires brought us?”<br>
<br>
Jaenu glanced quickly at his aide, the smile never leaving his face.  His assistant rifled quickly through a hip pouch before pulling out a rolled parchment and handing it to Jaenu.  The master bard handed the scroll to Thorion as he explained.<br>
<br>
“The night before last, the venerable Hattori Frostminer led his host out of Thurgadin.  I would imagine that at this moment, his band has just now laid siege to the outpost in Great Divide.  Within 48 hours, we can expect our supply lines to be restored and fresh troops moved in to fortify our position.  The fires have bought us a night of peace and the time for Hattori to take the battle to the giants at our backs.”<br>
<br>
Bu’Ving, victorious general of a dozen campaigns, glared at the wild elf beneath him, fuming with arrogant fury.  Jaenu’s cluster of battle bards returned his look, brimming with pride and confidence.  Hot anger bubbled from deep within him, turning his face a deep purple.<br>
<br>
Losing his composure, he bellowed at the bard, drawing the eye of every footman an archer within range of his voice.<br>
<br>
“ONE NIGHT!” he shouted, spittle flying through the air.  “You sold our lives for a night of quiet whoring with your gypsy minstrels!  We have no arrows, Stormsong, we have nothing to hold the orcs at bay!  All we can do is wait for them to charge and pray they break themselves on a wall of pikes!  We are doomed, bard, all for one night of quiet!<br>
<br>
So now that you have sold the lives of all of my men, Jaenu, I beg you… grace me with your amazing intellect, tell me a tale that will somehow change this grim reality into a magical triumph.  We have no wood, no arrows, no food.  How are we to take the day?”<br>
<br>
The paladin leaned over his saddle, challenging the bard to speak up in the face of his rage.  A chilly silence settled on the camp, as hundreds of men waited to hear a single word of hope come from the bard.  An icy wind blew through the valley, stirring the smoke and ash of the dying fires.<br>
<br>
The smile never left Jaenu’s face.  Narrowing his eyes to meet Bu’Ving’s challenge, the wood elf began to recite the ballad of an ancient hero.<br>
<br>
“In the days of yore, when the wurms roamed freely on Antonica, the Great Conqueror Barra B’varea found her army…” <br>
<br>
Bu’Ving spat noisily, hitting Jaenu’s plated boots.  “Bah!  I need answers, bard, not blasted fairy tales and legends!”<br>
<br>
Jaenu’s face became an icy mask, cold eyes glittering with a seething malice.  Even Thorion straightened uncomfortably in his saddle under the weight of the withering gaze.  Usually jolly and carefree, the bard’s sudden intensity seemed to darken the very sky in ominous anticipation.<br>
<br>
“It is my job, ‘Lord’ Bu’Ving, to add your name to the list of legends.  It is my intent to have people sing of YOUR prowess in ages to come.  If you are unwilling to learn from the past, then I cannot help you.”<br>
<br>
The bard’s sarcasm was not lost on the nobleman, prompting him to stiffen with anger.  “I feel, elf, that you have forgotten your place.  You are my adjunct; you are here to help ME.  I fear that you may be hitching your wagon to my star.”<br>
<br>
Jaenu barked out a laugh, a clear bell ringing in the frozen halls of Velious. “Me?  Hitch my wagon to YOUR star?  My dear Lu, your fears are misguided.  A bard gains his glory from his composition, whether the subject matter is a tale of heroism or tragedy is immaterial.”<br>
<br>
The war party shifted uncomfortably.  Jaenu swung his rucksack to his shoulder and stepped closer to the paladin, lowering his voice.<br>
<br>
“You want the spotlight, fool?  Take it.  This is your chance.  You have around eight hours to set up your last stand against the orcs.  Eight hours to compose the last verse of your own requiem.  I’m through carrying you, Lu.  From now on, it’s all up to you.  Aria or swan song, it is all up to you.  I wish you the best of luck, as I’ve always felt my comedies lacked a certain something.”<br>
<br>
With that, Jaenu turned and walked off to toward Frostminer’s siege of the giant outpost.  His retinue of battle bards followed.  One lone minstrel stayed by the stunned general, playing a slow, mournful dirge on a plain, wooden flute.<br>
