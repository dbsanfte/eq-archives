8 years ago, I bought a pair of shoes. I'm still wearing the same pair of shoes. They are black, ordinary shoes. Not designer. No label. Just shoes. And they have holes in the soles. At the same time I bought the shoes, I bought a suit. It is my only suit. I still have it. When I left home for university, I bought a coat to treat myself. Two years ago, someone walked off with my coat in a nightclub, leaving behind their own. The two coats were identical except mine was small and his was large. I was unable to recover my coat. Ever since, I have been wearing a coat which is about 4 inches long at the sleeves. Yes I look stupid in it, but that's okay because I can't afford to go out anywhere anyway.<br>

As for food there is plenty of food that is cheaper because its not &quot;name&quot; brand. <br>

I don't buy name brand food. Actually, I don't buy much food. I eat one meal a day. A year ago I was so thin that the doctor threatened to hospitalise me. Instead, I went to stay with my dad for a while, and he fed me up.<br>

Actually, I bought unmetered access for my computer. It's only at nights and at weekends, but its cheaper than buying a newspaper everyday and it's my only connection with the outside world. I don't have a tv. can't afford it. About a year ago my mouse broke. A few months ago my cdrom broke. About a month ago my monitor broke. My father bought me a new cdrom for my birthday. I am borrowing my brother's monitor and mouse.<br>
<br>
At the moment, I am in my dad's house. Unfortunately, there's been a hold up with my housing benefit. It meant I couldn't pay my rent. I had been using my inheritence to pay the rent whilst they sorted it out but it has run out. I have had ot move out of the shared flat I was in.<br>
<br>
This is all with the help of the state and with the help of my family. Without my family, I would probably be homeless by now. A lot of people don't have families like I do. Without the state, I wouldn't stand a chance.<br>

I have come from what many would consider a priviliged background and it opened opportunities to me that I may not have otherwise had access to.  I was able to attend an elite college and an elite law school.  My parents encouraged me to study and paid for my undergraduate education and half of my law school education.  I like to think that I am smart enough to have gotten where I am today regardless but that is not necessarily the case.  If I had grown up in a terrible neighborhood with abusive parents, who knows how I would have turned out.<br>
<br>
The reason I bring this up is that it reminds me of conversations I have had with classmates and, to some extent, my girlfriend, where they don't seem to realize that some people (including them) do grow up privileged in this country and have had opportunities where they may not have otherwise had those opportunities.  There have been a few posts where people have mentioned how they have been able to work their way out of a bad situation and kudos to them.  Just realize that not everyone in that situation is able to do so and we should have compassion for folks with fewer opportunities (for instance, disabilities that prohibit them from working).  <br>
<br>
I read a report recently about upward mobility in this country.  While opportunities abound, the fact remains that folks that are born into wealthy backgrounds are very likely to be wealthy themselves and to earn high incomes.  Conversely, folks with low-income parents are likely to earn low incomes as well.  That isn't a huge coincidence.  In order to make it in this country, you need opportunity and desire.  Folks raised in upper-income families are presented with more opportunities.<br>
<br>
I love this country because it does, more than any other country in my opinion, provide opportunities for people to better themselves.  It is heartening to read success stories.  We need to remember though that some folks lack the abilities to get themselves out of situations and we shouldn't judge them for that.<br>

<br>
No, it won't be super easy.  But if something is harder for you, then you work harder.  If you have learning disabilities it is your parents and your schools responsibility to point them out while in k-12.  If your parents refuse to believe that you have a problem they need a serious kick in their ass. <br>
<br>
If you can make it into a University and fall under $25k (net income not gross) a year you are eligible for a full pell grant $2000 a semester and up to $5000 in subsidized loans per semester.  You also receive certain moneys to go to summer school.  All you have to do is keep a 2.0 which if you are not A or B should be able to attain.<br>
<br>
Decius, not a flame towards you but just pointing out things you said.  You said one meal a day?  What is it?  I can buy a bag of rice and make lots of meals.  Or Ramen.  Do I like them?  Not really, but you learn to live on what you can.  I am lucky that for one or two years my grandparents stepped in so I could get on my feet since neither of my parents care.  <br>
<br>
Blood, I agree that the highest % do some awful things, but you have to realize that 1% is very few people and most of the people who are called &quot;rich&quot; are just people who are lucky, smart, or incredibly skilled.<br>

It's absurd not to believe that there's real people that just can't make it when, well, they are there. I don't care why they didn't made it. Maybe they are stupid. Maybe they had terrible luck. Maybe they have an undiagnosed mental problem. Who cares? The fact is, while I own a small company now and live reasonably well, next year I can become stupid, have bad luck, become alcoholic, get depressed by a dead son, or need a new heart... why not? we're humans, and humans fail. <br>
<br>
I want a decent second chance, and I want others to have a decent second chance as well (not only people with wealthy families should have one). State spends money painting walls, watering grass, and doing many unimportant things: giving people more chances to prosper is a great benefit to the whole society, and the state just can't forget that. We're not talking only about the moral problem. We're talking about less crime, and better chances for the poor to gain wealth.<br>
<br>
If I lose my company, I want an adequate time to find a job where I can put my technical knowledge to work. No, I don't want to work in a McDonalds as a first option, and no, in my country that salary can't pay my family's bills. I have had much worse jobs than that when needed, but I think the benefit for myself *and* for my country will be larger if I can look for a job for a few months without the pressure of being kicked out of my home. <br>

About sales tax: it is applied here in Spain and in the rest of Europe(I think ). sometimes I hate it and I am sure it slows economy a bit, but companies are not affected that much and it can even help sometimes.  <p><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=577826">Echtelion HeavyHand</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--><br>

Beeing single and high wages I pay around 42% taxes on my wage and on top of that there more taxes from the city and provence you life in for services they provide.<br>

We pay taxes for driving a car and pay high taxes on cigarretes and fuel.<br>

Companies who hire me pay a very high amount on top of the wage they pay me. It used to be for every cent you pay your employe you pay a cent to the goverment. I don't know how much it is now since there been some tax cuts in the past lowering the cost to hire somebody.<br>

I would be a very happy man if they reduced taxes or atleast made our tax system more transparent and remove the double and tripple taxation but not at the cost of basic solidarity.<br>
<br>
We pay alot but we get alot in return from it but there is always room for improvement.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showUserPublicProfile?gid=drusila>Drusila</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/themes/blueMoon/unread.jpg" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 28<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(4/22/03 9:35:42 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm62.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=345.topic&index=48>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Being Rich?!?</span><hr size=1> My earlyer point was not to whine about my own situation although I do see it as easly confused with that..<br>
<br>
I used my own situation when I know several other peoples stories that I could have used insted, I just feel that its rude to go speeking about someone else and much easier to speek about myself.<br>
<br>
It was to make the point that things we choose are not always the problem. I Chose a husband with a good reliable job, Medical insurance, life insurance Ect Ect.. We never chose for him to lose the ability to work and with it the health and life insurance.<br>
<br>
We did chose to care for his aging mother, because of the way things have happened in her life (and not all of them were chosen) she has almost nothing and if it were not for us she would have no one. I say it was a choice and Im sure it was but also it is an obligation IMO.<br>
<br>
It is frightening to know that if my son needs lifesaving medications or surgury he can not have it. <br>
<br>
If I am diagnosed with cancer I will have to die because there is no way I could afford a doctor.<br>
<br>
In either case explaining this to a child would be most dificult.<br>
<br>
You may sight darwin on this one.. maybe my son or I dont deserve to live because we are not wealthy enough or because we have made &quot;bad choices&quot; in some peoples estimation.<br>
