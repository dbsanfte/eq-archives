I'm sorry but really, people can and will get offended over anything.<br><br>I go out and to LARP style roleplaying of vampires that run around and suck peoples blood.  I usually wear black and wear my favorite pentagram.  It's a really nice one, celtic knot.  I bet a whole lot of people would find the lot of us offensive if they saw us.  Furthermore I bet they would get offended by my petagram.  On the other hand I think the Wiccans should be offended that people have made the pentagram into a &quot;satanic&quot; symbol when its got very distinct meanings to their culture.<br><br>On the other hand, I only wear that stuff for purely roleplay purposes.  (ok, maybe religious on the pentagram too)<br><br>Hell, I could tell you that I am offended that you chose to play a dark elf.  My friend could be offended by someones roleplaying.  I could be offended by the fact that my friend is offended by someones roleplaying.  I mean honestly people, you can't take yourselves so friggin seriously.  God knows I don't and I don't think there is a god.  Uhoh, think I just offended some people.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :( --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/frown.gif ALT=":("><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   I certainly hope they don't go cry about it and get me banned from the boards.  Damn...<br><br>The fact that people are basically trying to censor someone else's roleplay, their game, and thier work just makes me wonder.  This woudl be the one game to do it in though.  Not like your gonna go walk up to that guy at the LARP and say &quot;WTF man!  I am so friggin offended at that I am going to petition to the GM&quot; or shout across the table at that tabletop game of DND at the storyteller because he just had a character crucified.<br><br>I don't usually post on heated topics or on my personal views because honestly I don't want to be flamed and  my business is none of yours.  But people really need to take a step back sometimes and look at what they're doing.  It's just a *game*.

BUT, if Shintou is playing a certain way and RPing someone who crucifies people OVER and freaking OVER, it can get offensive. There is nothing wrong with a person saying &quot;ok back off I just don't wan't to play that way&quot;. Respect that choice the person has made and don't whine or demonize them, why? because that is being civil about the whole thing. Frankly, I LIKE the way the Sisters of Myth RP, Vivienne plays a succubus she has a very seductive and creepy way with going about things that leaves you with doubt. Honestly, my character fears Vivienne more than someoen like Shin because while Shin is laying all his cards on the table and hacking everything to death, Vivienne is seated regally in a cushioned chair smirking and staring at you the whole time.. Personally I think that is  a more interesting than &quot;I'm going to crucify you....weee I'm going to crucify you, why? because I am TRUE evil and you are only 99.9% evil and that just doesn't FLY in my world, you are a mutt I am a pure bred Greyhound so I'm going to yell at you and threaten to kill you and bathe in your blood because I am MORE EVIL than you blah blah blah&quot; This is really what I see from Shintou and thus the few times I have met him in game, I have walked away within the first 3 or 4 sentances. some people may glorify this as &quot;Wondrous RP, oh my god Shintou you are the best!&quot; others may find all the constant taunting and threatening and slaughterhouse style that is Shintou to get very old and eventually quite annoying. I do not glorify Shintou, he is an ok RPer at best in my opinion, I SEE him taunting others and not letting it go. He posted here, then on the Sisters of Myth board then had to link them together. Exactly WHAT do you want out of Vivienne so much that you have to hound the issue so much? She has told you OOCly to just leave her alone, respect it and leave it alone, you don't have to say that these people are bad RPers just cuz they won't play your game. Plain and simple if osmeone does not like it, STOP DOING IT , there should NOT be a problem with that.<br><br>I don't care for Shintou, hate me or whatever but that is how it is for me.<br><br><br>In regards to Madrain, how many times have you seen someone shouting something that messes with the credibility of another guild shouted over and over in some zone or another, don't base your opinions of other guilds off of random idiots with a keyboard. See for yourself Madrain plain and simple, RP with them before brushing them off. <p><left><a href="http://www.mutedfaith.com/quiz/q3.htm" target="new"><img src="http://www.mutedfaith.com/images/slave.jpg" border=0></a><br><a href="http://www.mutedfaith.com/quiz/q3.htm" target="new">Find your Role-PlayingStereotype</a>, and visit <a href="http://www.mutedfaith.com" target="new">mutedfaith.com</a>.<a href="http://www.livejournal.com/users/labile">[Angel.]</a></left><Br>===================<Br>Solufein Alastrarran<Br>32nd Season Ranger of Tunare<Br>Poud member of the Clan of Brothers<Br>SPANK ME!</p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ucatafv.showPublicProfile?language=EN>cataFV</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Firemunchkin</span><br>  Posts: 118<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(9/17/02 11:44:50 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1411.topic&index=5>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: I'm not going to bore you with a Long Rant.</span><hr size=1> um solufein, read what Didi wrote.<br><br>i've only spoken to Mizzery out of the sisters, and she was nice. but what they are asking doesn't make sense.  i can't say &quot;solufein, you offend me, don't speak to me&quot; and then walk up and talk to you, and expect you to keep ignoring me.<br><br> <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ucatafv.showPublicProfile?language=EN>cataFV</A> at: 9/17/02 11:47:28 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ufalinoralastrarran.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Falinor Alastrarran</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Boobie Boy</span><br>  Posts: 98<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(9/17/02 11:51:03 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1411.topic&index=6>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.game-revolution.com/misc/staff/aawhite.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: I'm not going to bore you with a Long Rant.</span><hr size=1> Ok rmemeber also that Vivienne and Shintou both threaten almost EVERYONE because wll..Shintou hates just about everyone and Vivienne is a schemer....the key point is, if someone says stop, then leave that person alone, Shintou diidn't havr to go post in the Sisters board telling them to take notes from his evilness, Vivienne stated, just end it.

I'm just saying that I think that the fact that one persons view of their game is different than anothers and thus the second person is getting a restraining order put in place is rediculous.  I don't know either of the roleplayers in game.  I personally do not care for seductress style people at all because they remind me too much of vampire larps where you end up with a room full of people all pulling disciplines sitting there all so totally enamoured with each other that they can't resist doing anything but sitting there.  That doesn't mean that I support people that are on a constant crusade.<br><br>And please, don't go off on my examples.  They were only that, examples.  And BTW, if someone in a DND game or especially in a LARP really DID say there were suddenly thousands of crucified peopel everywhere I woudl just accept it because thats how the world is.  You shoudl work the other person's roleplay INTO your's, not totally reject it because they clash a little.<br><br>It woudl be different if this were a mroe realistic game where the players really could attack each other and 1 death was all you got.  Too bad, tough shit.

How is he supposed to react?<br><br>Viv wants her and her guild/friends to be left alone, she needs to leave Shintou and HIS guild/friends alone also.<br> <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon3.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/usarhea.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Sarhea</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_redspot.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Tu'Rilthiil Bladedancer</span><br>  Posts: 1515<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(9/18/02 2:24:13 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1411.topic&index=11>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> <BR><img src=http://sarshouse.homestead.com/files/images/sar.gif width=52 height=126></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: I'm not going to bore you with a Long Rant.</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> Ok rmemeber also that Vivienne and Shintou both threaten almost EVERYONE because wll..Shintou hates just about everyone and Vivienne is a schemer..<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br><br>See, the point I think that's being missed here, is this::<br><br>In the above scenario, one of them is roleplaying, and one of them isn't.<br><br>~Sar. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon3.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/usarhea.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Sarhea</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_redspot.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Tu'Rilthiil Bladedancer</span><br>  Posts: 1516<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(9/18/02 2:29:20 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1411.topic&index=12>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> <BR><img src=http://sarshouse.homestead.com/files/images/sar.gif width=52 height=126></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: I'm not going to bore you with a Long Rant.</span><hr size=1> Damn, no edit.<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br><br>See, it's one thing to not like the style of Shin's RP..I can see where some wouldn't.
