Cancelled</span><hr size=1> Edit **<br>
<br>
Will not waste anyone's time... without the prerequisite classes at least signing up we do not have a chance.  I think perhaps Gore will need to die to donate her bones to the temple. <br>
<br>
This raid is cancelled, my apologies to all who were interested.  <br>
<br>
<br>
On Sunday Oct 26th 7:30 PM EST, (7:30pm EST - Special force, 9:30pm EST main force) I wish to bring a force into Permafrost.  Our objective will be the death of cold, cold Lady Vox.  Should we do this in short order, the next target will be the Lord Nagafen.<br>
<br>
If you are of the dark you will be welcomed, if you are neutral, you will be tolerated.   If you are of the light *eyes narrow*, I will not say whether or not Lord Thule will accept your deaths as sacrifice, but I will not allow one with the banner of a guild of lightbringers on his helm to attend this ritual.  ((OOC I am not going to spend this raid witchhunting ... if any of the light show up and sneak in so be it... I am not going to spend the raid arguing good / evil / alignment. This raid is intended for dark and neutral, but if it turns out that funny DE rogue was actually a halfling I am not going to get that excited about it during or after.)<br>
<br>
Signups***************<br>
<br>
Tell me your profession, and your rank, that I may assign you groups before the battle. Tell me also to which house you pledge allegiance. <br>
<br>
Special Force<br>
Our plan will be this. I require a team to eliminate the giants, spiders, and tentacle terrors from our path. For this, you may be of any age from 52 to 65, and assistance on this task will let you roll upon the spoils. I require a shaman, a monk, a cleric, an enchanter, a shadowknight and a necromancer for this team. I also require a magician to summon items agains the cold.  This group will also help me shield (buff) the adventurers before they face the dragon, and help rescue any who fall into the pits. Coffins and peridots will be provided for these tasks. Please indicate if you would join this special force.<br>
<br>
Main Force<br>
Unless you are on the special force you must be of level 46 to 52. The only possible exception I will make is for bards and clerics, who may be as low as 42.<br>
<br>
This raid will not occur unless the following sign up and are available.. There is nau point in dying a glorious death without a chance of success, such foolishness I leave to the suicidal lightbringers.<br>
Main Warrior - (must be level 52) - please indicate if you can do this role as you sign up.<br>
Monk Tag Pullers ( level 46 to 52) - please indicate if you can do this as you sign up.<br>
Enchanters to mana drain ( at least 3)<br>
Clerics ( minimum 3 level 42 to 52)<br>
Bards ( minimum 4 level 42 to 52) <br>
<br>
Those who sign up have their spots reserved, until 10 minutes before the raid. At this time I will no longer hold your place, and will fill from any others who sign up. <br>
<br>
Should any flee the raid before it finishes, they forfeit their right to any spoils. Should any not listen, and cause confusion and commotion, they also will have their right to remain revoked, and will be assisted to find the exit to the plane of knowledge.<br>
<br>
Spoils ******************<br>
<br>
Only those selected will have rights to loot. Their names will be given..Everything will be rolled on at the end only - after all have life again and are rescued from the pits. Should you win one item, and prefer the next, you must give the first item back should you win the second. <br>
<br>
ONLY the classes list below get to roll for each item. This is not open to negotiation - but if I have missed someone please post, and I will correct before the raid starts.<br>

<br>
Please note, the only thing I want from the dragon are the bones once the flesh has fallen off the carcass.  All else is open to those who have need.<br>
<br>
Dress code *****<br>
<br>
The lady has cold hands, the mage will summon shoulders for us ( +15 resist CR) , but also find if you can other items to guard against the cold. She is a lady of Fear also, to resist her, even sacrifice your armour class to guard against Cold and Magic. Of the two, cold is your most important need.<br>
<br>
Suggested inexpensive items to acquire are...<br>
2xPlatinum Peridot Ring (AC4 CR10), Cloak of the Icebear (AC8 HP10 CR20), Rune Boned Fork (MR10 CR10 FR10), Crown of the Froglok King (AC12 CR20 FR20), Velium Round Shield (AC15 CR10), and Gnomish Environmental Suit (AC9 FR10 CR10 PR10). <br>
<br>
Bring enough food and water, and if you cannot port, bring a gate potion if you have to leave early.<br>
<br>
Basic Rules ********<br>
<br>
1) As you arrive, log on to the channel Ladyvox, turn off annon<br>
2) Groups may need adjustment, when assigned a group find and report to your group leader.<br>
3) Never move unless told to move, do not ever pass the pulling / MA team. There are pits. If you fall in a pit, stand and die, we will get you out. The pits training the raid is the most common cause of failure for the attempts. Again, if you fall in a pit DO NOT MOVE, DIE, we will rescue you.<br>
4) For the duration of the raid, I am the one you FEAR. Listen when I speak, or Lord Cazic Thule will learn your name.<br>
5) Role play is welcomed during the raid... but please save duels for after.<br>
<br>
<br>
Strategy ******<br>
<br>
7:30 - Special force assembled, goes to the king room and begins to clear the giants. Magician will be asked to summon items for the raid force <br>
<br>
8:00 - Magician begins to distribute cold resist items. Groups begin to form at the entrance to Permafrost. Groups formed ...DO NOT BUFF, we do this once at ready<br>
<br>
8:20 - If you are not yet here your spot is forfeit, final group adjustments. Raid is formed. Set up hotkeys for assist, and to announce all actions relevant on raid channel. Clerics join channel ladyvoxheal.<br>
<br>
8:30 Shields and protections applied by groups. Raid instructions given.<br>
<br>
8:45 - groups move in through the flag room to the king room to meet the special force.  We move just inside the doors, and the monks of 52 now pull and clear the lair of the Lady Vox<br>
<br>
Lair is Clear - we move carefully to the buffing area. I will designate people to not pass to mark the pit locations, make sure if you see someone sitting you do not move past them.<br>
<br>
Shielding - This is critical but slow and boring. The special force will provide shields to the raid.  When instructed, remove all your old shields. You will move to the shielding line when told by your raid leader.  Once your group has your shields, you will go to the Firiona Vie chat room (yes you camp out and join chat) You do not return until all parties are shielded and ready, so that your shields are fresh for the battle. I will have an alternate in this room to call the return when we are ready.  When the return is called quickly rejoin your groups. Summon and equip pets, and get full mana. We are now ready for the assault.<br>
<br>
The Assault*******<br>
<br>
1)  We follow the MA into the room, and he/she engages. Bards have only one job, to equip a drum and sing  Elemental Rhythms and Guardian Rhythms - nothing else so they do not aggro Vox. Casters, you must be close to land spells (melee range) Go near her tail, and let her breath on the MA. <br>
<br>
2) Melee, surround her and do not let her be pushed into a wall. Keep between her and a wall. Do not taunt if you are near a wall. Pushing is essential to stop the Lady from completely healing. Melee, watch where you are and always keep her off the walls and pushed.<br>
<br>
3) Healing. Done right, the MA stays alive... the clerics must all be prepared to heal the MA. A rotation of complete healing will be assigned. You must announce heals on LadyVox channel. Your other duty, keep your bard alive for resist songs.<br>
<br>
4) Enchanters cast dispell twice. Then immediately mana sieve til she falls. You can tash at 60%, she should not aggro you then. Necros in group please feed enchanters mana and DOT the dragon. Do not turn Lady Vox into a skeleton!<br>
<br>
5) Shamen try and slow debuff Vox. Send in pets at 80%<br>
<br>
6) At 70% if you can chain slam, bash, stun her so she cannot heal<br>
<br>
7) All non Wizards nuke hard at 50% Fires spells work best on the Lady. Bards if you are dying Dirge. Melee if you have a nuke cast it now. All mana sieve, chain stun, push and bash.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START 8) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/glasses.gif ALT="8)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->         At 30% Wizards nuke hard.<br>
<br>
9) If you fall into the pits STAND and DIE. We will rescue you, do not bring the creatures back to us please!<br>
.<br>
After*******<br>
We rez the slain, rescue the fallen from the pits, and divide the spoils. Should we fail, return to zone so the necros can call your bodies. I will need the help of fourteen stout trolls please to take the bones to the Necropolis - to the Temple of Terror.<br>

&quot;Hey wait a minute!  I have a Spirit fight with a Giant (and I mean GIANT Polar Bear in the caves near Vox's Lair.  I must contact Lady Littany to see if this wouldn't be a nice dessert after Lady Death falls.<br>
<br>
((OOC - I have aBeastlord Epic related battle with a Spirit in Permafrost right near Vox's Lair.  Resists arent really needed for the fight, BUT the bear is said to be HUGE with a HUGE amount of HPs (...roughly 40,000).  The boards recommend 2+ groups of 50+ people.  If we got a raid force in the area, and Littany would agree, I could do the hand in to the scout after lady Vox falls.  It would a nice Bonus fight for those who come.  Just an idea...))<br>

If necros sk's and monks can equip this makes more sense b/c they will likey be the only ones around to make use of its primary purpose until the charges expire...necros can use the amana and hp as well.  Any pally caught using this should be smacked.  It does make a rather attractive young shaman item as well....but fd classes are the ones that can bring a raid back fast by rezzing the cleric.<br>
