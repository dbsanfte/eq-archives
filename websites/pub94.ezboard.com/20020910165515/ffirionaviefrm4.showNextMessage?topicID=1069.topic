<br>
1) Wait until I am crossing through a dangerous area (to me), literally as far from a Soulbinder as I can be, thus making me more willing to take risks.<br>
<br>
2) Send me a /tell in whatever language you happen to be using at the time. It's my fault if I don't understand, for I should have attended language lessons.<br>
<br>
3) Be Invisible. I cannot see through Invisibility, so it's a fun game for me to try and figure out from where you've spoken to me. Don't tell me! I like guessing games like that.<br>
<br>
4) Speak to me about out of character matters without prefacing with OOC or in any sort of parenthesis. This tests my reflexes, and forces me to switch to OOC in my mind. That helps me to increase my empathy with the player behind the character. It helps if you jump back and forth between in-character and out-of-character as well, for this keeps me on my toes.<br>
<br>
5) Intersperse your comments with abbreviations and d00d-speak. I fully endorse time-saving measures, and really, nobody expects you to type 6 whole characters in a string. That would mean taking your fingers off of your buff spell hotkeys.<br>
<br>
6) Make sure that if you need assistance, your character is of the race which my character hates above all. This broadens my horizons and makes me see that although racial prejudices are found in the game, in today's modern hurly burly world we have no place for even simulated racism. Embrace the righteously-challenged! Only in this way can you walk the path of a paladin. Never let yourself discriminate against anyone, no matter who they've eaten or how many of your ancestors they've tortured for centuries on end.<br>
<br>
7) Be as cryptic as possible. I like puzzles.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START 8) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/glasses.gif ALT="8)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  If I ask you for clarification on said puzzle, dodge! I appreciate that you wish to keep the sanctity of the puzzle. Giving me the answers I seek only dulls my mind. I'll thank you later!<br>
<br>
9) Ask me to join your group quickly, before I figure out your puzzle. It's my own little trap. I reward with platinum if you get me to join your group before I understand a bloody thing about what is going on.<br>
<br>
10) Keep hitting the button to ask me to join the group. There's a chance I didn't see it 10 seconds ago. I'm only stalling for time if I don't Follow immediately. don't let me figure out the puzzle!<br>
<br>
11) If I mention that I might not be able to help from a roleplaying standpoint, find a ruler and crack my knuckles. I'm a bit slow-witted, so you must remind me that it is a roleplaying PREFERRED server, and that since the other servers only allow you 5 or 6 alternate characters, you had to choose Firiona Vie out of sheer necessity. Just because I like to roleplay on the single, solitary roleplaying PREFERRED server, does not mean that anyone else should be forced to do it.<br>
<br>
12) Keep hitting the button to ask me to join! Gets my butt moving instead of contemplating this situation dagnabbit!<br>
<br>
13) Ask me to put the roleplaying aside. Some things, like getting your epic items, are more important than roleplaying. How can I be so callous? Don't I understand what is at stake? Stats man, STATS!!!<br>
<br>
14) If I voice my concern in an out-of-character manner, and tell you that there's no way I can put the roleplaying aside for what you ask, get huffy. You have a right to be angry with me. I'ma damned roleplaying nazi, and I should realize that epic items are important.<br>
<br>
15) Do not, in any way, clarify what you wanted me to do initially, or suggest a way that I can help you and maintain some semblance of my roleplaying. It's up to ME to find a way to help you. Why haven't I helped you already?<br>
<br>
16) If I selfishly decide not to help you, and apologize for it, respond only with 'kiss it'. This will make me see the error of my ways, and I will repent. I will see what a jerk I am being for not helping you, in much the same way as hysterical people need a slap across the face.<br>
<br>
*sigh* Of course, this is based on real events, of only hours ago. I don't know what possesses people to assume that I'll join a group with someone I have never met, and who will not explain to me what they want me to do.<br>
<br>
Imagine walking through an unfamiliar area, and getting asked to join a group with someone who's invisible, and won't explain their purpose. They admit that they're a member of a race which my character, in nearly no circumstance, would go out of her way to help. Tolerate perhaps, roleplay through helping, maybe. But just out of the blue?<br>
<br>
All that aside, if there was a way that I could help that didn't involve GROUPING with said character, I might have done it. If I could have done it all out-of-character. I don't hate players, I hate characters. I'm not out to give the players a rough time. But no, in order to help I have to actually do things in the game. Remember, this is for a damned stranger, who will not explain exactly what I need to do, and pushes me to group. Yesiree, that sets my mind at ease! Why, I'll just group with my hated enemy, do whatever they need me to do, and hope they don't find a way to shadowstep me or something into an inaccessible area, 4 zones from where I am bound. Or get me designated KOS in the area. Or give me a giant faction hit.<br>
<br>
And to top it all off, it is to help a character get their epic item, or so they claim. what POSSIBLE reason, aside from kindness, would I have to help my enemies become even stronger? All roleplaying aside, I really don't think the FV server needs an uber running around who gained their epic item through OOC action.<br>
<br>
But maybe I am a jerk. Shut up, don't ask questions, and ignore roleplaying, that should be my goal.<br>

<br>
This would be a great addition to Cylria's journals. Travelling through dangerous terrain when suddenly a voice whispers out of no where in a language I don't quite understand. The voice isn't mean or threatening but seems to want something. After a pause the voice whispers again, this time in Common. He tells me he's a Teir'Dal and needs my help to aquire an ancient weapon. Temped by the thought of seeing such a powerful magical artifact restored, I realize that I would be putting such an item into the hands of evil. After I decline to assist, the voice curses me and my kin and I'm left with silence. I know I have made an enemy this day, but at least it's an enemy without an artifact weapon.<br>
<br>
Based on what you told us there was no need for you to break character. And if he got mad at you for not helping, would your character expect any thing else from a dark elf? Freindly when they want something, Mean and ruthless when you are no longer usefull.<br>
<br>
Instead of griping about this in the soapbox, with a little imagination this could have been a good entry into the bard for a day.<br>

I have RPed with Asdyr's player a number of years and am always entertained and awed by the sheer abilty to stay IC.<br>
<br>
But... why here and not Bard for a Day?  It was a rant &amp; more people read Soapbox than Bard.  Haven't you ever just wanted to get something off your chest?  Note, too, it was told pretty much from the viewpoint of the character with some nods to the game mechanics which could not have been told in quite the same way in Bard.<br>

<br>
Ordinarily Cylria, I'd agree with you. I did, in fact, think that I'd write it up in my ongoing backstory/journal/rant on Asdyr's page almost as you mentioned - the voice from the shadows, the self-serving teir'dal.<br>
<br>
Had it been mostly in-character, I would have done just that. Had it been something to which I could refer in in-character terms, likewise. But so much of it went down OOC that I felt it was better to glaze it over IC. Otherwise, I'd have had to go through trying to find this person, get my elven butt killed, etc., for things which she should not know.<br>
<br>
A lack of imagination on my part? Perhaps. Maybe I was just tired, maybe I was taken aback by some of it. It just seemed much more of a rant incident than a journalworthy incident.<br>
<br>
I tend to reserve my roleplaying for those who appreciate it, or at least those which I can work in coherently. Yes, I could have made it part of my journal that this whisperer in shadows needed my help, but frankly the person was so uninterested in any sort of roleplaying that I'd rather just not deal with it at all. I may still mention it in my journal, I don't know. But since my journal isn't in Bard for a Day, nobody would have noticed anyway.<br>
<br>
Some days I turn the most trivial things into roleplaying fodder. Some days I just can't be bothered. It's a character flaw with us grumpy buggers.<br>
<br>
Oh, as for the things you mentioned, the teir'dal saying what it wanted, how I could help, that never happened. I didn't even know what the epic was, nor what thing the darkling wanted me to do to help. I'd have been glad to roleplay through it. Sadly... <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/utresjoli.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Tresjoli</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.shadow-striders.com/images/wolfIcon.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Elven Princess</span><br>  Posts: 298<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(8/8/02 1:59:02 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1167.topic&index=11>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.cpinternet.com/~theduke/MythStuff/ez-tres.gif  WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Assisting the Teir'Dal</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> If I selfishly decide not to help you, and apologize for it, respond only with 'kiss it'.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--> I don't know why but that struck me as terribly funny. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :lol --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/laugh.gif ALT=":lol"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

<br>
In the past couple of days, every time I come into a Druid Ring, I get sent a /tell from some random person or another asking for Spirit of Wolf.  When I turn around, every damn time it's a Teir'Dal.<br>
<br>
&quot;Brother, can I get a sow?&quot;<br>
<br>
Brother?  Pardon me?<br>
<br>
I'm not sure why they think a wood elf should help them out at all, much less suffer them to live.<br>
<br>
[Edit: By the way, I think this is fallout from the May 8th changes made to the server.  Before, since goods simply could not help out evils and vice-versa, there was no expectation.  Now, you're a &quot;jerk&quot;, &quot;roleplay nazi&quot;, &quot;FV police&quot;, &quot;asshole&quot;, or &quot;punk ass&quot; if you refuse someone's request for Resurrections or Spirit of Wolf (etc) for roleplay reasons.] <p><center><img src="http://home.earthlink.net/~andersonrob/lasgalensig.jpg" border="0"></center>

The choice to be teir'dal is a cosmetic one. Everyone knows they're just dark-coloured elves with pretty eyes and albino hair. The entire history of roleplaying both in EQ and in AD&amp;D with the drow should not give you an excuse not to help someone. It's so difficult looking kewl!<br>
