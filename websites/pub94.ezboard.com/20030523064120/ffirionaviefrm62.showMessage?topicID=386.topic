I saw a bunch of the real doozies, he had a whole big stack of them.  The United States could be found on every continent.  China in Europe.  Los Angeles in Argentina.  That sort of thing.  This was in 2000.  I am not old or arthritic.<br>
<br>
His big thing was to make sure those kids got out of that class knowing exactly where every country on the planet was, and he would give them that test over and over.  It's sad that this had to be done to these kids in college, instead of, I dunno, in 4th grade. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showUserPublicProfile?gid=nakath>Nakath</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 421<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(5/1/03 2:25:10 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm62.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=386.topic&index=4>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: What the hell?!?!?</span><hr size=1> Its not the fault of the 'education system' its the result of the ridiculous political games that are played with that system.<br>

People ask 'what has happened to our schools?'<br>
<br>
You wanna know what happened? Local governments had control taken away from them.<br>
<br>
The USA that landed a man on the moon, defeated polio and smallpox, developed atomic fission, invented the computer and the personal computer and created the richest nation in the history of mankind was educated in a system that was almost 100% locally responsible.<br>
<br>
Now, with 'standardized testing,' 'centralized curriculums' and 'accountable standards of learning,' we are seeing a drastic increase in the number of people slipping through the cracks.<br>
<br>
The reasons for and against this are legion and we could discuss this until the cows come home.<br>
<br>
The bottom line is this: You want good schools and smart citizens, insist that control be given back to the local municipality. <p><!--EZCODE CENTER START--><div style="text-align:center">Nakath Thunderbush<br>

Problem is, you can't exactly lay this squarely at the feet of the concept of central standards...just the execution.<br>
<br>
1.  The textbooks we have, particularly in K-12 education, are nauseatingly PC - thanks to both liberal and conservative groups that harass textbook companies.  They're hardly factual anymore, just pathetically dull, random accounts of how people felt and thought at particular periods of history.<br>
<br>
Instead of learning about the Revolutionary War, students read pages and pages of how &quot;women influenced early America,&quot; thanks to pushes for &quot;gender equality.&quot;  And thanks to overly-patriotic conservatives, much of the early history of both World Wars is left out because &quot;the war only *really* started when the US got involved.&quot;  (Read any history book, trust me, you'll find many instances of this mealy-mouthed crap that never looks at history in a critical light, now that we talk about women and minorities in every sidebar and wouldn't *dare* look at a non-American POV in even a World History book.)<br>
<br>
2.  The standardized tests themselves suffer not only from the rampant PC bullshit, but from being, simply, confusing.  Look, I'm amazing at taking standardized tests, not to brag or anything, but it's true.  I consistently scored in the 99th percentile on all state standardized tests I took in grade school, and in the 95th percentile both on my SATs and my GREs for grad school.  I missed 1 question in the entire verbal portion of my SATs...<br>
<br>
But those tests fricking suck.  The questions are often indirect, and...verbal scores be damned, there's no words to describe how *weak* they are.  They're designed by politicians, not educators...or are at least influenced too much by legislatures.  The tests themselves need to be basic, and clear, instead of deliberately wordy and meandering.<br>
<br>
Local control is not the real answer to the education problem.  The US, I believe, has always lagged in the education department.  Most countries that have better education standards than us - the ones I'm most familliar with are Japan and Britain - have standardized tests out the wazoo.  The thing is, they COUNT.  If you fuck up that test, you are screwed.  In the US, they mean very little, and even now, mean very, very little.  When tests themselves are improved, and children MUST pass them to go on to the next grade, then, well...they learn.  It happened in the Chicago grade schools...almost all of those kids went to summer school, and many of them were able to pass the test by the end of summer.  The problem isn't the testing itself...it's the crap tests and the lack of consequences attatched to not getting it right.<br>
<br>
There's too much focus in the US on the &quot;everyone should go to college&quot; mantra.  The countries that have better educational performance than the US just laugh at that notion, and as I graduate from university myself this year, I'm beginning to see why...  So many morons with roughly 8th grade intelligence levels getting degrees.<br>

<br>
I noticed in Jr high school through Highschool that the the majority of teachers (public school) did not seem to care if the students learned or even showed up. The teachers seemed to lack enthusiasim, the classes were overflowing, the text books falling apart, the students not well behaved and generaly uncooporative, some even violent.<br>
 Could the teachers lack of enthusiasim be because they felt they were not being paid enough? (think risk vrs reward here)<br>
<br>
I personaly was there to learn somthing.. Socialy it was a living hell for me and after a few years of being discouraged by the enviroment I took the equiv test.  passing with wonderful scores.<br>
 Sadly in the US society the Equiv (which many grads can not pass btw) is not 'good enough' qualification in many situations. (employment, further education ect)<br>
<br>
Now My son is in the Public school system and I am frusterated with the whole thing all over again.<br>
The school has enough funding and donations for several sports teams and a new tech speaker system for those events But can not fund an art or music program, drama or anything else, and the playground is pittifuly tiny. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :( --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/frown.gif ALT=":("><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
The staff and even the SD head do not seem interested in quality of learning or the childrens wel-being but let them miss a few days of school and I am getting notes sent home about how they are going to make me explain his absences in a hearing! (this is because the school loses money every day the attendance is down)<br>
<br>
Socialy its a nightmare for him, he Loves learning but the enviroment is terrable, and I often hear him say how he hates school because of the other children and teachers  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :( --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/frown.gif ALT=":("><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
I make sure he learns at home but unfortunatly I teach him things that are true and accurate... somthing his teachers so far do not apreciate *sigh* .<br>
<br>
Many children in his calss (2nd grade) can not even read!<br>
its very sad because I know those kids will get passed from grade to grade just to &quot;get them out&quot;. <br>
