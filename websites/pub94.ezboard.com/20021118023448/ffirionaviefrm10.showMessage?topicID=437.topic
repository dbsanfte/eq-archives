Passing among the busy gnomes bent on their tasks, he moved among them effortlessly and barely noticed. he looked at the palace, repaired after Ebon's storm. All was well again in the city. He meandered past the Gemchoppers and into the market area where the Forge of Defiance churned out steel items of all manifestations.<br>
<br>
One resident did catch his eye. A young gnomette seemed to be pleading with a merchant. He unobtrusively made his way closer to eavesdrop on their conversation.<br>
<br>
&quot;One platinum piece for one rose,&quot; said the high elf vendor,obviously not a resident,&quot; My occupation demands that everything I sell is sold for profit!&quot; His haughtiness was tempered by ire toward the gnomette.<br>
<br>
&quot;I only have 7 gold,&quot; pleaded the gnomette,&quot; my sister has invested our family wealth into becoming a merchant herself. This is all I have and it's mama's birthday today.&quot;<br>
<br>
The observer noticed that despite he claiming to be poor,she did wear armor of a paladin. He stepped forward, &quot;I couldn't help overhearing, but if the rose is that important,why not sell a piece of armor to pay for it?&quot;<br>
<br>
She turned to him, seeing he was one of station and fell to her knees.&quot; I cannot m'lord,&quot; she said with her head down,&quot; It is not mine to sell.&quot;<br>
<br>
He looked down at her.&quot; Possession gives you the right to do with it as you wish.&quot; He saw her tense.<br>
<br>
&quot;M'lord,I have given my word I would take care of this armor until could afford a set of my own,&quot; she said tersely, still hanging her head.&quot;And that is the word of a paladin of Brell Serillis.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;What is your name?&quot; he asked.<br>
<br>
&quot;Lizabeth,&quot; she answered, &quot;of the house of Xi,M'lord.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Where is your sister?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot; I do not know, she does not keep in contact with us,but I have heard she resides on Luclin now. Begging your pardon, M'lord, may I ask your interest?&quot;<br>
<br>
He smiled at her,&quot;Just curious.&quot; He then fished a platinum out of his pouch and flipped it to the vendor.&quot;Give her the rose. She seems honorable enough to repay me  sometime in the future when our paths cross again.&quot; He picked a rather pretty rose from the vendor's stock and softly lifted Lizabeth's chin with it.&quot;Take this to your mother and wish her a happy birthday for me.&quot;<br>
<br>
She stood up, thanked him and ran off with the roses. He watched her until she disappeared into the crowd. Turning to the vendor, he laid out 15 plat.&quot; It has been a long time since I have seen my mother as well.&quot; He pulled a small card from his pocket, scribbled something on it and handed it to the vendor.&quot;See that she gets a dozen roses, would you?&quot; The vendor nodded.<br>
<br>
Later on his meanderings led him to the muses, religious center of the good-natured residents of Ak'anon. He noticed a new addition to the wall of rememberance and was startled to see Lizabeth kneeling before it. He moved over to her and as she noticed him, turned and knelt before him again.<br>
<br>
&quot;I wished her a happy birthday for you, M'lord.&quot; she said through teary eyes.&quot; I am sure she is smiling and Brell is granting you a blessing for your kindness.&quot;<br>
<br>
He was at a loss for words as he noticed the single rose laying beneath a small plaque. He read the inscription to himself:<br>
<br>
Xianna, faithful wife and loving mother. Mage of good standing, Eldritch Collective.<br>
<br>
He turned away, unable to speak for the lump in his throat. An acolyte had been watching over the area and motioned him aside.&quot;Many died that day,&quot; he said, &quot; It is the way of things.&quot; <br>
<br>
He looked back over his shoulder, catching a glimpse of Lizabeth's face before she lowered it again, showing only her fiery red hair. &quot;Yes&quot; he said hoarsely, &quot; The way things will always be.&quot; He pushed passed the acolyte and with quick strides back to the high elf vendor, he asked him, &quot;have you sent the roses as I had asked?&quot;<br>
<br>
The vendor looked up at him nervously,&quot;No, M'lord, I have not&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Don't bother sending them,&quot; he said, &quot; I will take them there myself.&quot;<br>
<br>
<br>
(ooc: yes, it is an old story, just thought it appropriate for Lizabeth's storyline)<br>
