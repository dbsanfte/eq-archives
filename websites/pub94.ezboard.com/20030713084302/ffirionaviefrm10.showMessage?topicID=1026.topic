The snow sparkled in the rising sun, making the mountains seem as if made of glass, for just a few moments. Alone, on the tallest peak, a figure knelt, watching the sun rise with worn blue eyes. He did not flinch as the sun burnt itself onto his retinas, he wanted to remember what he had seen here through eternity.<br>
<br>
After a time, the figure stood, his journey that day long. His white armor shone in the sun, freshly polished and oiled for the coming battle. A familiar, yet haunting rhythm filled the valleys, as he vanished to the moral eye, running on the wind.<br>
<br>
His first stop was but a short one, as he knelt at an unmarked spot in one of the valleys. He remembered then, the proud barbarian who had fought the polar bear, even as her life blood spilt on the ground. She had become a good friend of his, her gruff voice ringing in his ears even now. He knew she was dead now, she had died once more while fighting in the Overthere. A proud barbarian's bones now littered the tigers caves, her warder confined to the Void for all time.<br>
<br>
His journey resumed, taking him swiftly through Blackburrow, the gnolls within feeling the wind of his passage but seeing him not. He paused outside Qeynos, taking in the sight before memory took him once more. He saw Lady C again, the beautiful Koada'Dal whom he helped briefly. He saw himself, his old friends, and her standing just outside, then journeying east...<br>
<br>
He broke the reverie, and followed the beat of the drum as it lead him further and further east. Through expansive Karanas, where he had many a hunt. Into East Karana, where other memories overtook him. He had loved his family dearly, but harsh words had been spoken by all, ill feelings laid bare, friends lost. He thought he had made his peace with the loss, but knew that to be false at that moment, as tears fell from his eyes. He sped through Highkeep on these memories, the tears beating their own music on the ground.<br>
<br>
Another stop, as the sun began to sink in the sky, at his old home. His parents long dead, his only family left in Butcherblock, his childhood home was in disrepair and partially torched. This was orc land now, and only the foolish stayed long. Still, he spent many hours, remembering in his childhood, sitting in the overgrown grass.<br>
<br>
Finally, he reached his hometown of Freeport, and took to the wind once more, taking refuge on the top of the clerics guild, where he was safe from the wrath of the militia. The sun began it's final descent, and he watched it, and felt the burden of his many years fall from his will. With a quiet voice, strained from yelling in battle, he whispered on the wind, &quot;One final sunset.&quot;<br>
<br>
He quietly slipped into the sewers, to the book portal to Knowledge, and then to Tranquility. He pulled forth his sword and mace, and slipped on his winged helm. With a touch of an artifact, he slipped into the land ruled by Terris Thule, a battlecry of his life on his lips. He was finally at peace. <br>
<!--EZCODE HR START--><hr /><!--EZCODE HR END-->The Paladin watched from afar, never to get too close to the proud bard, this proud soul, whom he had fought along side with against all the great evils of the world, now prepared himself to enter a lair full of pure evil.<br>
<br>
As the paladin watched the brave Troubadour enter the crypt, he payed careful attention to follow softly behind him, no one should face evil alone. The bard weaved his last tale, the most beautiful of them all as he cut threw the nightmares at bay. But the crowd of legs and wings overcame the poor bard, and as if never more pure than before, he let out a warcry from his lips...the last. The Paladin tried to help, but he was too late, when he reached the unholy ground, there was no more trace, the bard was truly at peace now. On the ground lay a sword, and a note. The sword was of a beautiful carving, a true masterpiece of metalwork. The note, was on torn parchment, very old indeed. this writing was sacred, a song never sung, but embeded in the worlds heart and soul. The bards memory would not be lost, his valient courage and love for his kinsmen would be remembered.<br>
<br>
The Paladin with all his might lifted the sword above his head, and flung it back into the ground. The sword took form around the earth and stuck true. Anyone who would pass would remember that a brave soul had fought hard here.<br>
<br>
He looked down toward the blade, and saluted it. waiting a few seconds, he slowly rolled the parchment, and placed it into his pack, perhaps he would keep the song alive. <br>
<!--EZCODE HR START--><hr /><!--EZCODE HR END-->The man awoke with a shuddering breath. He was immedietly aware of two things. He was cold, and he was not wearing any clothes. On the heels of that, he wondered if he was in heaven.<br>
<br>
The last memories he had of living were diving into the realm of Terris Thule, a song of war on his lips, his sword and mace in hand.<br>
<br>
&quot;Well,&quot; he thought, &quot;if this is heaven, it's damned cold.&quot;<br>
<br>
With a sigh, he propped himself up, and tried opening his eyes. He slowly focused on the landscape, and recognized it.<br>
<br>
&quot;Nope...&quot; he mumbled, &quot;about as far from heaven as you could get... Great Divide.&quot;<br>
<br>
He stood, and took stock of his condition. He was alive, a definate plus. He was without any of his equipment, a definate minus. And he was cold.<br>
<br>
With a sigh, he began to chant an old tune, the magics of the song letting him walk on the wind. He began to notice small things then, a boulder in the wrong place, a hill shaped differently. He was definately in Great Divide; he could see the waterfall entrance to Thurgaden before him, but something didn't feel quite right.<br>
<br>
He walked unabashed into Thurgadin, and began to haggle with the dwarven seamstress. He knew he was still in excellent shape for his age, and was hardly abashed about his body. She had trouble keeping her eyes on his, and he used this to his advantage, obtaining a few basics for a mere kiss on the cheek. He promised her to return with payment, and checked the fit of the clothes in a nearby mirror.<br>
<br>
Utter shock passed over his face then, his hand drifting to his face. When he had last looked in the mirror, his 64 years had shown in crows feet about his eyes, and a leathery look of his skin. His hair had been whitened, not it's usual platinum. Now, though...<br>
<br>
His past stared back at him, a past fourty years lost. His eyes were bright, his face smooth, his hair young and strong. He stood there for many minutes, just looking at his young self.<br>
<br>
&quot;Ya' allright there, youngin?&quot; came the voice of the dwarven seamstress.<br>
<br>
He affixed a familiar smile on his face, and turned to face her again. &quot;Aye, I am quite good... haven't felt this good in... far too long.&quot; He winked at her then, smiling more broadly as he watched her fidgit. &quot;Again, my sincerest thanks to you, dearest lady, for your generousity.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Aaw, tis' nuttin. Can't 'ave ya walkin' 'round like that... too many youngin's.&quot; She replied with a giggle.<br>
<br>
He bowed grandly to her, and kissed her once more on the cheek, before being shooed out. He wandered to a bar in Thurgadin, again using the full power of his charm and wit to obtain a small meal from one of the bar maids.<br>
<br>
He sat there, munching on the dwarven fare, and tried to remember what had happened. He had been ready to end his days, with sadness on his heart and age in his bones. His swords had served long for Tunare, who had granted him such peace long ago. His last memory was of entering nightmare, fighting with all his skill and power. And now...<br>
<br>
A memory began to reveil itself then, a memory of a conversation.<br>
<br>
&quot;You have served me well, my son. Your heart has endured much, and I am afraid I must ask more of it. Raise your swords once more in my name. Be my champion in these times of darkness. Love once more, care once more.&quot;<br>
<br>
He thought hard over this, and shook his head. &quot;You know, Tunare... you could have at least left me my mandolin...&quot;<br>
<br>
Just then, the barmaid tapped him on the shoulder, holding a bundle. &quot;Some stranger just dropped 'ese off for ya.&quot; With a gracious smile, he took the bundle from her, and opened it. Inside were two things. His first sword which he had sworn to Tunare so long ago, and a badly worn, oft repaired mandolin.   <p><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=318126">Falcolas Swiftsong</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--><br>
