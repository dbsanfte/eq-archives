Again, I apologize for using the market for that.  I'll give all the details.  This past Sunday, Zinclara talked me into rerolling a DE SK.  I agreed to it, thinking it would be fun to travel with a friend all the time.  I tell her that I'm going to spend the money I earned in the bazaar, and I even pick her up a crystal covered shroud and a ring of frost for helping.  So I spend the money, then /shout that I will give 50pp if someone will kill me in the arena (quick way to get back to GFay, hehe).  Unfortunately, no one made money from it, as I was rushed from all sides and Rivald killed me.  Was quite funny though.  We meet at the spires in GFay, and I first give her the items I bought for her.  I then tell her that I trust her with my things, and that if she were to keep them, I would be saddened that a friend would do that all for some items.  Now, before this, she had kept telling me that she would help with a transfer.  I had thought it seemed kind of odd, but since I considered her a good friend, believed I could trust her.  She tells me to go ahead and reroll, that she will take the boat.  I then reroll my SK, and begin to hunt in Nektulos. About 20 minutes go by, she then says shes on the boat.  I don't get any word from her after that, so try and send her a tell.  Shes not on.  About 10 minutes later, she says she went LD on the boat, but she will try again, when she gets back from going out to eat with her friend.  She says she will be back soon.   I begin to get a little suspicious, but again, I trusted her, so I wait.  I waited for over 2 hours, she never comes back.  I now begin to think she took off with my things, so I reroll a wood elf bard.  Well, when I get on, I see her /shout in GFay, asking if she would be KoS in the bazaar.  This really gets me thinking.  I figure she must be at the spires if she is asking that, so begin to run there.  I witness her say &quot;journey to Luclin&quot; to get the stone and be ported up.  I then hail her, ask her where my things are.  &quot;Oh, in the bank&quot;, she says.  I say great, you seem to be headed up to the bazaar, we can get my things then.  All of a sudden, she &quot;has to leave for work in 3 minutes, the military doesn't like people being late&quot;.  She then tries to RP with me, but at that point, I'm having none of that.  She logs.  Not even 10 minutes later, I see she is back on.  I begin to send her tells, yet I get no responses.  At that point, I know she is keeping my things.  I have petitioned, and of course have received no help yet, but I will not give up.  Well, yesterday afternoon, I get a tell from someone named Klarsina.  I couldn't understand it, and I don't know anyone named Klarsina.  I send her a chat tell, ask her to repeat that in Elvish or send a chat tell.  She says &quot;sorry, mistell&quot;.  I keep that name in the back of my head, as I have been looking to see who would try and sell items like I had.  Well, I see Klarsina auctioning off a few items I had handed to Zinclara.  Maybe its just a coincidence, but I head to the bazaar to find out.  I see her near the entrance, con her, shes db to me at 11.  Well, looks like she has a darkedged two hander, a netherbian chitin, crusty arms, legs.  Items I had handed to Zinclara.  Well, maybe its just a coincidence.  I then ask if I can inspect her, she says sure, but then runs off before I can.  I ask her where she is, she tells me near the stalls.  I don't see her, so I ask for a loc.  Surprisingly, she gives it to me.  I then find her, and inspect.  Hmm, shes an SK.  Wow, seems to have everything on I intended to give to MY SK.  Acrylia gorget, plus the other items I had mentioned.  I ask where she got them.  &quot;Oh, from friends&quot;.  Suddenly she gets quiet.  I then tell her that I don't know her, why did she send me a tell before?  &quot;Oh, I was looking for people to group with, sorry about that, if I bothered you&quot;.  Umm, I was in BB, she was in Nek.  Odd, I think.  I then leave, not wanting to scare her into rerolling again.  I know one thing, I am not going to be as trusting of others as I once was.  Thanks, Zin...I mean, Klarsina.  If any of you happen to come across her, smack her for me, eh?  (Sorry for such a long post, but I wanted to get this out there) <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ueaos.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Eaos</A> at: 8/7/02 8:06:13 am<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=mylodi>Mylodi</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 219<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(8/7/02 8:03:35 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1165.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Beware Klarsina</span><hr size=1> People who do shit like this should be dragged out onto the street and shot.<br>

Are you still a wood elf (or some other good race/class)?  If so, what's your character name?  I -might- have some things in my bank taking up space (I say might because I can't remember the last time I did back clearing and what I acquired since then).  Nothing as nice as what you lost, but maybe something to help you get by until you can get some things.<br>

He worked hard for those items, thought he could trust someone (who had gotten him to re-roll, so she was probably planning this in advance) in holding onto his stuff, and then got screwed over in a way that is extremely difficult, if not impossible, to trace.<br>
<br>
I feel sorry for him in that he was probably enjoying his character before the re-rolling, was deceived, and is now stuck back at square one without anything to show for his prior accomplishments.<br>
<br>
The only twinking I really disagree with is the blue-server type, where many of them play with the express purpose of outfitting a low-level alternate in good equipment. Play EverQuest with fun in mind, not gear; though I guess that applies to every server. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ukathatlafv.showPublicProfile?language=EN>KathatlaFV</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 52<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(8/7/02 11:42:08 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1165.topic&index=7>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_cooldude.gif" align=absmiddle>  bored@work thoughts!</span><hr size=1> Bored at work post!!!!<br>

thanks for the heads-up!<br>
<br>
now if i had the money/time...this is what i'd do to anyone who did that to me.<br>
<br>
1.  wait until she's wanting to buy something or say &quot;i have an upgrade for your weapon you seem nice would you like it?&quot;...<br>
2.  send her a tell saying you have that item for (really cheap/free so no one would refuse)...say oh shit i gotta log i'll be on AIM/ICQ(whatever) contact me there (make up good reason why they need to get on to get you to login to give them item..)<br>
3.  Get their IP.<br>
4.  Call their ISP and bribe worker to give you physical address of the person using that IP...or use social engineering.<br>
5.  Have a great time with address. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/uveloxiavoluptuous.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Veloxia Voluptuous</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>RAR!(tm)</span><br>  Posts: 1191<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(8/8/02 12:39:08 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1165.topic&index=8>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_cooldude.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: bored@work thoughts!</span><hr size=1> wow, i would have loved to read this, but it is all in one extremely huge paragraph without any breaks.

Hello Caillou.  Yes I am still the wood elf bard, named Eaos.  Very kind of you to even offer to help.  Many thanks for the offer, but a few friends loaned me some things till I can get back on my feet. (they say they gave the things to me, I say loaned.  I intend to pay them back) I asked for nothing, yet they still gave me some of the things they had.<br>
<br>
Azhrei, I can honestly say her being female had nothing to do with my trust of her.  I trust females as much as I trust the males in game.  Thank you for the information, I never really thought much about this type of thing happening.  Lesson learned.<br>

FV is a small town, and word gets around.  i hope that pretty soon this person's grouping options are eliminated.   <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=korzax>Korzax</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 10<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(8/8/02 12:07:15 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1165.topic&index=14>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: People like that really puzzle me</span><hr size=1> LOL another horn dawg enticed into giving all thier stuff away to the first pretty elf that bats thier eyelids at you. Sorry for your loss, but how lonely are you to fall for such an obvious ploy to seperate you from your gear.<br>
<br>
Or, maybe this is just some story to generate enough sympathy from the other folks that use this board into giving you some free gear which you would otherwise not have.<br>
<br>
And why, after convicing yourself to play an SK didn't you continue to do so?<br>
<br>
Well, if you do decide to take the route of the Knight, /tell me in game, I have sk gear that needs a home, and your story alone has conviced me that you deserve it. I haven't had a good chuckle in quite a while. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/urandy111576.showPublicProfile?language=EN>randy111576</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 10<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(8/10/02 12:46:43 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1165.topic&index=15>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: People like that really puzzle me</span><hr size=1> well we got one char per account on this server to curb twinking.you tried to beat the system and got burnt it happens.and as far as petitioning you gave her the iteams and then deleted your char. there for the items are hers nm what intention you gave them to her under.so if a gm does jump in the middle of this i personaly will be desgusted they got better things to be spendignt here time working on.you willingly give someone somthing and they keep it your on your own with it. i just hope you learned a leason out of it all,yes its a nasty lesson to learn and its a shame you have to but its a hard cold fact of life.and in my oppinion you were tryn to be just as dishonst to the game as she was to you by carring your equipment over to your new char.<br>

<br>
personally, whenever i see posts like this it's used as merely a 'heads up'.  i try, in my personal dealings, to be cautious at all times with everyone except for my guildmembers and friends of same.  when someone brings what they consider 'bad behaviour' to my attention or the attention of this board, i don't usually blacklist the person out of hand.  <br>
<br>
but it does make me a bit more cautious with them.  i've seen a few people that have been proven (if anything can be) to be rascals on this messageboard.  did i snort in their face and show my disgust?  noo.  did i send them any tells saying how low i thought they were?  noo.  i merely observed their behaviour carefully to see if it meshed with everything that that has been tossed around about them.<br>
<br>
looking back over my post, it seems that i was dismissing this particular person out of hand.  hypocrite?  yes, i'm quite as prone to it as anyone else is.  you'd be hard pressed to find more than a handful of people who don't apply any double standards in their own life, but it's no excuse.<br>
<br>
going back to watching warily.  thanks korish!  <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top"> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.showPrevMessage?topicID=1165.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.showNextMessage?topicID=1165.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a self href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1165.topic&index=20><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/classic/addReply.jpg border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"><a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.threadControl?topicID=1165.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/professional/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands (Moderator only)</a><br> <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=1165.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=1165.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub94.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="firionaviefrm1">Firiona Vie General Chat<option value="firionaviefrm9">OT/OOC Forum<option value="firionaviefrm4">The Soapbox<option value="firionaviefrm58">Telegrams!<option value="firionaviefrm47">Guilds and Associations<option value="firionaviefrm10">A Bard for a Day<option value="firionaviefrm23">Hero Heart Tavern<option value="firionaviefrm15">The Polling Booth<option value="firionaviefrm40">Kudos!<option value="firionaviefrm48">Ye Olde Coffeeshop<option value="firionaviefrm57">Apep's Coffee Talk<option value="firionaviefrm2">The Market Square<option value="firionaviefrm22">The Tradeskill Shop<option value="firionaviefrm38">The Spell Library<option value="firionaviefrm59">The Battlefield<option value="firionaviefrm39">Renaissance Festival<option value="firionaviefrm42">Roleplayers Wanted/LFG<option value="firionaviefrm43">The Fighter's Den<option value="firionaviefrm44">Tower of Magick<option value="firionaviefrm45">Altar of Faith<option value="firionaviefrm12">Suggestion Box<option value="firionaviefrm6">Signature Testing<option value="firionaviefrm7">Patch Messages<option value="firionaviefrm49">Apep's Dead Horse Forum</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#A62A2A>- </font><a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie>Firiona Vie</a><font color=#A62A2A> - </font><a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4>The Soapbox</a> <font color=#A62A2A> - </font><br><br><br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 6.9.5.4<br>Copyright ©1999-2002 ezboard, Inc.</center></body></html>
