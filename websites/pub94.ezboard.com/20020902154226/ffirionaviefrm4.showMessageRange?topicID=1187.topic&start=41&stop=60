I think the biggest problem AS has is their PR.  If they worked on it or had someone who was better you probabaly wouldn't see any complaints. <p><B>Zsuzsana Dracul</B><BR><I>Beguiler of the 59th Jewel</I><BR>

That's one of the oddest things I've ever read. Guess that makes Valancer, or his brother, one of the &quot;rightest&quot; doers on FV.  <p><CENTER>

To be an &quot;uber&quot; guild, progression, loot and raiding generally come first over any concerns of roleplaying or looking out for other players.  This of course if a general comment, but for the most part, uber guilds get a bad rap.<br>
<br>
The above &quot;uber&quot; guild concerns however DO NOT include trade-scams, cheating and otherwise doing things contrary to the EULA or human decency - though the latter concern is often violated.  And what Valancer did certainly should have negative repercussions.<br>
<br>
Personally, I like competition but I also like to play nice - doing those two things together is kinda tuff sometimes.<br>

where they walked over my camp for a rare spawn because they wanted to...<br>
<br>
I talked at that time to lacus who i was told was leading the raid he said tough we are going to kill it...<br>
<br>
later , twice i spoke to first xarps wife (unless he was playing mind games) when she sent me a tell to try sort it out, then xarp himself, for over 3 hours, well what can i say...<br>
<br>
that conversation showed me just why ass's members are the way they are. Ive never met such a, well ass!<br>
constant lies, twisting things to suit his purpose, contradicting himself...<br>
<br>
If its leadership and officers are this way no wonder its members see it as fine...<br>
<br>
Im just sorry for the good people who through what ever misplaced loyalty remain in the guild. Yes there are some good, 2 spring to mind i know (cinny and ogarth) and theres probably more. Its their attitude and leadership that stinks and this the guild and its policies.<br>
<br>
I know at least one who has left because of the constant bs of the guild (wont name names but good for you!)<br>

Had he really expressed his feelings to me in game this could have been resolved more civilly and simply with a few tells. At any rate, I suppose I'll attempt to defend myself, but it seems rather pointless as many have already decided that nothing good can come of Awakened Souls and every act committed by the members is an atrocity aimed at ruining the server. It's amazing to me that Hysar flamed me for killing him in the arena, but I guess I should have seen it coming. After all, I recall that just last week, in Kael, when we were killing the statue one of our guild members used /shout to get our raiders to change their push location. This immediately turned into a chance to flame Awakened Souls. I don't recall who it was, but they shouted the typical &quot;every other guild can use a raid channel but you ASs' can't?&quot; Amusing since we were on a channel, and this was after one shout. Had it been any other guild it would have gone unnoticed. <br>
<br>
Hysar's account of what occurred in the arena is quite embellished. I was bored and did run over to the arena to see if anything was going on. Rather than narrate the events, I'll post the log that Uliamarath requested here, so as to clear up the confusion. I didn't think it was all that serious, especially since Hysar had stated he wasn't worried about it.<br>

My behavior, regardless as to whether I was &quot;nice&quot; or not, it was within the arena, a PvP area where player vs player combat is allowed. The game warns you when you enter such an area. Hysar entered the arena and thereby accepted the dangers which could and did present themselves in the form of other players attacking him. If he had desired to duel just one of his friends, he could have utilized the /duel feature of the game. If he really desired some threeway action he also could have gone to a more remote location, like the Arena, but there are no guarantees he wouldn't encounter anyone there who might do the same thing I did. To my knowledge, you did not lose experience in PvP battles as long as the players remained in the arena. To quote Abashi: <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr>  (Abashi) There's no XP loss for any death encountered while in the PK region of the Arena. Feel free to battle to your hearts content inside there. <br>
<br>
(And later - after many players claimed this was incorrect...)<br>
<br>
Ok, let me clarify then, you *can't* lose experience if you die in the PvP section of the Arena. This is not an accident, *but how it was setup specifically in code to allow battles in this area to take place without that risk*. I did go in and do some tests prior to posting, and *nothing* I was able to do caused experience loss, including:<br>
<br>
1. Death by NPC<br>
2. Death by DOT<br>
3. Death by DD<br>
4. Death by own spell (causes experience loss on ALL servers)<br>
5. Death by bleeding to death<br>
6. Death by falling <br>
<br>
Death by pet still needs to be checked, but it all uses the same code. Perhaps Monday I'll log in and see if someone is willing to have their pet beat me to death there. <br>
<br>

<br>
Although I don't consider myself to have committed a horribly wrongful act by killing Hysar, I have decided that I will just refrain from going to any arena as of this post. While I enjoy a bit of PvP now and then, it isn't worth the drama if people are seriously harboring feelings of resentment towards myself and the guild because of such incidents. <br>
<br>
To address side issues that have manifested as a result of this thread:<br>
<br>
Kloevis, *I* never intentionally trained you, though I was with Sydius helping him level when he did. He gave me no warning of his actions before the incident, and I expressed my feelings of displeasure after the event... though when I learned what kind of person you were, I didn't feel any need to take any action to help you. You stormed out before I could apologize to you, but I did apologize to your group, and I did the best to buff them and restore their situation.<br>
<br>
Illudin, I don't remember ever saying that I had a GM friend of any sort. I only vaguely remember coming into the arena on that occasion after I banked for the day... please post a screenshot or log if I'm wrong because I honestly don't remember.<br>
<br>
Uliamarath, I'll be happy to duel you anytime manaburn isn't up /grin <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> . I just don't find dying and having to regen all my mana all that appealing when I have no chance at even getting a spell off.<br>
<br>
Feel free to address any other concerns to me either in game or on this thread, and I'll answer them to the best of my ability. I am in no way blameless, I have done quite a few rather 'shady' things during my time on this server, but know that if someone is sincerely upset with me, you can let the tears flow, and perhaps feel better.<br>

<br>
BULLSHIT.<br>
You're telling me that Sydius (35 at the time) managed to pull 20 some odd gnolls by himself without getting his ass kicked in that tiny area? No. Try again.<br>
As for the apologies- BULLSHIT, again. You said no such thing to either ME or the other two in my group. You didn't buff SQUAT. You taunted Thrads (sorry to bring him into this, but go ahead- if he can remember and feels like talking- he'll tell you.) when he showed up. You stood right next to Sydius and mouthed off the whole time. And I stayed there for a solid 20 minutes WELL after you had left.<br>
<br>
And exactly &quot;what kind of person&quot; is that, pal?<br>
Find me the name of someone I've done wrong (short of /ignoring a beggar) in game. Go ahead.<br>
<br>
And another thing- /duel challenge people all you want. Doubt anyone would have the brains to /accept in a town area. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ukloeviseq.showPublicProfile?language=EN>KloevisEQ</A> at: 8/13/02 5:07:24 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ulunathreee.showPublicProfile?language=EN>lunathreee</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>mistayn the mindless</span><br>  Posts: 430<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(8/13/02 6:01:25 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1187.topic&index=50>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_bigsmile.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: Awakened souls, Feriona's RUDEST and most inmoral guild</span><hr size=1> another &quot;too bad, you're mad.  soo sad...&quot; post<br>

notice there is a large gap between &quot;OK&quot; and the next statement by uli, A LOT was said and done there, that was where everything fell into place and it would have been a lot differnent if you had apologized to me after i lose xp, and maybe it is dangerous to do that BUT it does not say in the rules its ok to TRY to make someone lose xp, and as far as my typos that may be because i am Swedish, how many languages do you know? <br>
 i said that i was not worried about it the FIRST time.... i try to be calm about things but trying something twice like that really angered me, trying to make me look bad with my spelling and grammer does not say much for yourself sounds like your trying to get me with all that you can hit me with, understood, however knowing two languges and getting both &quot;puurfektlee&quot; down is not that easy, aplogogize for the slight off topic... to me this is not all about myself and what you have done to me there are obviously a lot of people that dont like you, some that do like you, but i was there and there were quite a few people who watched you do it to me... (well 3) this will be my final post, im tired of dealing with this and the people of FV can feel or do what they want to about it. <p>Hysar Vakaidon-Primalist
