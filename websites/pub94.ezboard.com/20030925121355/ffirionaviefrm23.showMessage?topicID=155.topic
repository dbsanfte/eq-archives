<br>
..Misguided souls..<br>
<br>
Those who wished to know the truth that is Hate..<br>
<br>
Soon, their will a place where you can gather.. and hear the word of Innoruuk directly..<br>
<br>
For you need Innoruuk in your life. Did you ever have feelings of loathing against yourself.. or others.. and never learned how to express these things? Do you wonder about our father in the Plane of Hate.. <br>
<br>
Does Innoruuk love us?<br>
<br>
Does the dark father care for us?<br>
<br>
The answer is No! Of course he does not! Do you wish to learn the true path to your eternal soul, to ensure that you earn a place within the glaring eye of our Planar Father? Our great creator has a plan for you, and all of his children, and you can learn how you can be apart of that!<br>
<br>
I have spent my entire life learning the mysteries of Hate. From the time when I was just a young boy.. I saught out to learn everything about this emotion that our father intertwined within our very souls upon our creation. I now feel that it is the time for me to share this lifetime of knowledge to all those who seek a place to learn about the true path to hate, that is along the bridges of Anger and Rage!<br>
<br>
I have saught to find a place that could give me the answers to these questions. Our church in Neriak preaches nothing on this. I found my questions unanswered and unused, untill I found for myself, throught prayer and the will of the Father how that his true path of hate is not even upon Norrath yet! ..His will is not here upon this world.. so .. I feel that I should.. no.. that it is my duty to place HIS Church upon Norrath once again.<br>
<br>
I have seen it all. From loathing ones self to love, learn how hate is within everything.. and learn how to use that hatred like a focused weapon upon your foes, every feeling of hatred is like a sword, even the hate you feel for yourself and for the Father Innoruuk! Learn to take this sword and cut down your foes with it's might!<br>
<br>
Lanys T'Vyl, the Mistress of Envy, the first former Chosen of Innoruuk, and the Direct Daughter of Innoruuk has shown us the way. She has died for our transgressions into the lightbringers, she has died for every child of Innoruuk that walks upon the land. Innoruuk slaguhtered her so that we may see the truth.<br>
<br>
The path to hate lies within the Envy, for what you Envy is what you shall have. I will show you to even use this power to your advtange, the power that Lanys T'Vyl left upon Norrath for us all to use, and how to truly focus your hate, NO matter your level of power!<br>
<br>
The Doors are opening, and soon the Fathers true Church will be upon this land.<br>
<br>
Behold the Truth of Hate.<br>
<br>
The Church of the Father, his Church of Rage<br>

She quickly downs the last of her brandy and sets the glass on the bar. Crossing to the posted note, she leans close and leaves a big kiss at the bottom. Laughing at the absurdity of shintou's antics she called for a refill of her glass and waited to see what happened next.... <p><br>

<br>
&quot;Many people have asked me for advice on Hate. What is hate, really? How can I use my hate to fight and kill? What can this hatred do for me to enhance my life?&quot;<br>
<br>
I know the answers to these, and many more questions. I've been throught the trails and tribulations of life itself, I've felt the hate that is brought by silly feelings of love and caring, I know of the pure loathing that is brought by envy and distain, I felt the blow of the Fathers personal Hatred for me, as he has a personal place for all of his Children, Lightbringer or not, in his world of hatred. I know how to return the Fathers hate with the hate of my own, like a personal offering. <br>
<br>
I also know that Hate is the Key to all. To save Norrath from a existance of peace, Hate will be used. I will save those who wished to be saved and teach those who wish to be taught. <br>
<br>
Some may stay at the Temple of Hate, which is currently in contruction in the Rathe Mountains, right in the Former Lanys T'Vyl Camp, for long peroids of time and become acoylites.. some may come just for a short time, take a lesson and apply it in their personal lives.<br>
<br>
It does not matter. The Tier'dal diserve better then to be a Whore race for the rest of Norrath to screw. <br>
<br>
With hate, we'll regain our dignity. I will make this church rise, and those who wish to come, will come.<br>
<br>
And they shall learn the best lesson of all. <br>
<br>
Hatred.<br>
<br>
In the name of Innoruuk and the Daughter, Lanys T'Vyl.<br>
My hate is true.<br>
