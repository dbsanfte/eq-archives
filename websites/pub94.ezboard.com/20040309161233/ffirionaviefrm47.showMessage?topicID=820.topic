      Before you read any further, This is about recruitment to a raiding guild on another server for players lvl 65 with 30+aa, if you have no interest in this topic, there is no need to read further.<br>
<br>
     Do you play during US daytime hours? Or on European time? 1:30pm est - 11:30am pst- 20:30 cet- (all the same time) start time? Are you level 65 with a good rep looking and at least 30aa's looking for a successful  guild? If you are I have something great to offer you. On Maelin Starpyre the newest server added to Everquest, we are lacking people playing these hours,  we have a VERY well organized raiding guild. That has been very successful formed in September, we are still young but have a winning formula. If you are interested in seeing some of our accomplishments take a look at our guild website <!--EZCODE AUTOLINK START--><a href="http://venom.m4d.sm">venom.m4d.sm</a><!--EZCODE AUTOLINK END--> just the list of kills this month is great keep in mind we've be able to tear down this many mobs over the last couple of weeks because our server is not crowded, in our time slot we dont have competition for mobs from any other guilds, the closest has a 2 hour start time after ours, we usually have first choice of mobs on patch days, and are first daily on the server to raid, the fortunes of Everquest are at our fingertips.<br>
<br>
     We are currently recruiting from outside of our own server temporarily for one reason alone, when Maelin Starpyre opened it allowed anyone to move there for 2 weeks and then server xfers were closed. Recently they have been reopened and people are allowed to xfer over with full gear. We have a reasonable amount of level 65's with aa's that raid US night hours, but not many people that play day time. This is an opportunity that we have decided to take advantage of. Our servers population is wonderfully light, but  there are still around a good 300-450 merchants in bazaar at any time, and a good 80 or so in PoK, I'm sure this is alot less than your server but it gives you an idea of the relaxed atmosphere on our server. With less players there is less competition for mobs and camps. LDON groups can be easily found, but alternate camps are an option if you are looking for exp or gear outside of LDON. Maelin is a great server.<br>
<br>
     To tell you a little about our guild,  we are only a few months old and are a collection of players from all servers, and from all over the world. We all speak english in guild chat and on raids, everyone is fluent. We are a raiding guild and raid 5 days a week Sun-Thurs and we expect all of our members to make 80% of raids. We understand real life issues come up we just have to know when you will be out and for how long. We all have Vex Thal access a good number of players have elemental access. We are currently farming VT for gear armoring our players, for our move to the elemental planes, and then on to Time. Our guild leadership is made up of a very skilled / experienced group of players who use tactical raiding skills, and have ALOT of PoP raiding experience, with the right people there is nothing in our way. We have an open road ahead of us to acheive our goals and are looking for a few people who are good players to join us on our journey! <br>
<br>
     Our recruitment policy is very sweet. For the time being we are accepting cross server applications. Should you choose to apply at our website <!--EZCODE AUTOLINK START--><a href="http://venom.m4d.sm">venom.m4d.sm</a><!--EZCODE AUTOLINK END--> be sure to put the server you are on, and the hours you play so we can contact you in game. Read our requirements. Your application for recruitment can be approved before you take any action to move your character to Maelin Starpyre, if you are approved you will need to move your character to Maelin asap, and begin your two week recruitment. This is not a trial but rather a recruitment stage. You will be tagged for the guild the day you arrive at the server and begin raiding that day. You will be eligible for loot from day one. You will begin acquiring DKP points from your first raid.  We are serious about having people join who are in it for the long haul with a stable guild. <br>
<br>
     If you are serious enough to move your character to a new server, you are probably serious about raiding with our guild. We dont vote on recruits, we have a blackball system. If during your two week recruitment you are blackballed you will not be allowed to join the guild. This could only happen to you if you do something completely out of line and uncalled for, or cannot adhere to guild policies, you can review that information on our guild webpage. Normal players who do normal things have nothing to worry about. We have only blackballed one person in the past and that person was blackballed on every guild from their homeserver due to very obnoxious and rude behavior. We have been lucky to only have mature, cool, relaxed people to join us. We kid around in guild chat, sometimes use vulgarities, you have to be 18 years old to join our guild due to the fact our guild chat is unsensored and sometimes conversations are unsuitable for children or those who are easily offended.<br>
<br>
     We fight hard, we play hard, we live like kings. If this sounds like something that interest you we'd love to see your application for recruitment. Please go to <!--EZCODE AUTOLINK START--><a href="http://venom.m4d.sm">venom.m4d.sm</a><!--EZCODE AUTOLINK END--> then go to forums and click on Venom Recruitment to place your app. If for whatever reason you cannot load our main page you can go directly to our forums here <!--EZCODE AUTOLINK START--><a href="http://pub152.ezboard.com/bvenommaelinstarpyre">pub152.ezboard.com/bvenommaelinstarpyre</a><!--EZCODE AUTOLINK END--> or search www.ezboard.com for Venom.<br>
