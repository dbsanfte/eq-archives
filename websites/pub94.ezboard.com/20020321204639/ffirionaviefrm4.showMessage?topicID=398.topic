(Told like a Drill Instructor)</span><hr size=1> Decide how loot will be distributed. There is so many ways to do this I will not delve in to that sloppy pit of hell...<br><br>Choose someone to be your 'Main Assist'. This usually means a 'Warrior, Paladin or Shadow Knight.'. Your main assist is in control of what dies first.<br><br>Everyone should make a hotkey and place it on your first 10 hotkey slots within easy reach... you will be using it religiously for the rest of your EQ Days...<br><br>In full screen mode hit ALT+M. This will bring up your 'Buttons'. Choose 'Socials'.<br><br>Choose any button you wish. Right click the button.<br>Name your button 'ASSSIT'<br>In the first box type the following:<br>/assist NAME (name meaning WHO you will be assist.<br><br>Example: /assist Steeltoe<br><br>Place that button in your hotkeys. Learn it, live it, love it, caress it, hit it constantly, pray to you assist key, tell it you find it sexy and want to bring it flowers... USE this button... it just may save your life...<br><br>Your main tank is RESPONSIBLE for choosing the correct mobs to kill that you will all concentrate on killing. He is my advise in that area:<br><br>Always (in most cases) kill any Healers First, then Casters THEN Warrior type mobs. Make sure your main tank knows his job, knows the mobs you will be fighting and understands his role as 'Main Assist'.<br><br>Second Tank. Always assign a second tank. A secondary tank is someone who keeps an eye out for 'more monsters coming' and will take on an mob(s) solo while the rest of the group (remember... ASSIST) kills the primary mob.<br><br>WATCH YOUR CASTERS. If you pull more then 3 mobs chances are VERY good that if a Cleric heals anyone in the group or a Caster Nukes a mob one of them 'extra' mobs WILL turn and kick the balls in of said 'caster'. Watch for that. Watch for your casters saying &quot;ON ME!&quot;. &quot;ON ME&quot; means &quot;Excuse me, Secondary Tank. Please come and taunt this creature off of me. I will stand here nice and still and take the beating like a man until you can get if taunted off of me.&quot; It does NOT mean &quot;EEEK! MY ASS IS BEING BEATEN. I AM RUNNING AROUND IN CIRCLES TRYING TO GET AWAY FROM IT!&quot;<br><br>That is the #1 stupidist, newbish thing you could EVER do. If you 'RUN' from a mob because it is beating on you all you are doing is making your Warriors job even tougher to taunt it off of you. So STAND STILL and tell them &quot;ON ME!&quot; or &quot;Get this OFF me.&quot; etc.. what ever works for you to get that secondary tanks attention.<br><br>LISTEN TO YOU CLERIC. Your cleric is not a stupid as you think he/she is. They KNOW how much they can heal. They KNOW how many hps you have. They KNOW how many mobs can kick your ass. They KNOW these things. LISTEN TO THEM. If they say &quot;DONT PULL&quot; it means &quot;Excuse me, Mr. Monk. Please sit down on your ass and dont move. Hey Warrior, get behind me and CHILL&quot;... it does NOT mean &quot;Hey guys I need mana so please run around in circles and see if you can aggro stuff on us so I can heal you with my remaining 15% mana then we can all die (or zone...).<br><br>Druids... Sorry Druids but you are not a melee class. yes I know you carry a nice scimitar around and a shield, but know what? Your not. See that Wizard over there sitting on his butt? Thats you. Sit. Med. Drop bombs. Cast regen. Damage Shield your tanks. Sow others. snare, Debuff mobs, drop a Dot... but if you stand and deliever a CRUSHING blow  with that 'mace' of yours you will probably find yourself in a new group <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  So do you job and do it well. Which is CASTING and NOT meleeing.<br><br>Rangers - if you are not snaring then whats wrong with you? Snare is your most useful spell you will EVER get. Period. Use it and use it a lot. Just learn WHEN to cast it. If you think casting snare at the beginning of a fight is 'smart' your wrong. Snare is a HUGE aggro. learn when to cast it and also for the love of all that is holy learn to BREAK attack if you gain aggro. Ranger output damn good damage, but you are a wet paper sack when it comes to 'tanking'. Let your tanks do that. Its there job and they are good at it.<br><br>Paladins - Lay on hands is not a SELF ONLY spell.... jeez.<br><br>Shadow Knights - You make EXCELLENT pullers... when you are level 60. Until then. Make like a Warrior and tank. Thanks.<br><br>Wizards - Did you know that dropping a bomb at a mobs 90% health mark is not cool? Learn to wait, time your bombs and nuke ONCE per fight (maybe twice if you are feeling frisky) and then WAIT to sit down....if you dont wait you will just ping pong a mob and piss off your melee... then sit and med for the next fight. Thats your job. Live it, love it, learn it...<br><br>Shaman - Note 'Druid' above. Also, buff your groups.... besides a Clerics buffs your own all.<br><br>More to come later <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   <p><B>Steeltoe Stonegrinder</B><i> Guardian of Kaladim and Slayer of Ogres</I><BR>Level 20 Dwarven Warrior<BR><BR><B>Steelfaith Stonegrinder</B><I> Acolyte of the Holy Brell</I><BR>Level 20 Dwarven Cleric<BR></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/uitchibumbashalots.showPublicProfile?language=EN>ItchibumBashalots</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 406<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(2/21/02 5:19:29 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=398.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Advise for Grouping...

The combo of root and slow can create mes-like effects on crowds of monsters and the shaman is equipped to take plenty of agro while root parking.  Also they can cast haste, and backup heal.  Their slow spells are the best heals in the games, in some situations.  In many exp groups at the high end its the Cleric who is burning mana on nukes, not the shaman.<br><br>A shaman in a lower level group has alot of options -- depending on the makeup of the group.  Backup healer, main healer, debuffer, buffer.  Almost never DD, occasionally dots in a  group situation, and yes.. with the proper gear they can do a decent amount of melee damage if otherwise full of mana and all buffs are done.<br><br>Cleric buffs+shaman buffs = best combo for hp AC and thats what really counts in late game....<br><br>My 2cp <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ukimayasilverbark.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Kimaya Silverbark</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.alienexplorer.com/clipart/images5/wolf.pawprint2.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Tao Te Bark</span><br>  Posts: 213<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(2/21/02 5:36:36 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=398.topic&index=3>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://home.bellsouth.net/coDataImages/bellsouthpwp/Groups/15/15568/pages/34736/Kimaya-60.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_bigsmile.gif" align=absmiddle>  Two Words..</span><hr size=1> I.

While alot of his advice is sound for all levels, they are not the only way to do things, just the most effective way to do things in specific parts of the late game, which he has recently come from.

If you wish to be an asset you should perform your duties to best of your classes ability. In this case, a druid, meleeing is not your strong point (not even close). Your most beneficial playing as a druid should play which is Snare, dot, nuke, buff, debuff, samage shield, sow etc... not blow all your mana then melee the rest of the fight... if you must manaburn then once you are done... sit down and med up for more burns <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  Heck sitting for 1 minute, gaining back enough mana for 1 nuke it probably more damage then you could output in melee in 1 minute <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br><br>Just my 2 cents...<br><br>Remember guys..

Don't forget the charms for druids.<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> Excuse me, Mr. Monk. Please sit down on your ass and dont move<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END-->ROFL.  Very true if your puller is unskilled, but on the flip side, what I want from a cleric is &quot;how much mana&quot; -- we both know how much you can heal, how much damage we can take, and how much we can kill, but as a puller I also know what is spawned and what is due to respawn.  For a good cleric, I will pull even at 20 or less mana (depending on group &amp; area) and if you ever get over 70 mana, I'm not pulling fast enough.  I like to keep clerics at about 30-40 mana, ideally.  The running joke in my old guild was that I thought cleric &quot;OOM&quot; means &quot;Out of Monsters&quot;.  Ever in a group where fighting seems to drag?  When I pull, folks sometimes ask to slow down and stop fighting so much.<br><br>A couple additions: rogues make excellent main assists.  They can can taunt somewhat on demand if they must, but they always want to stick to the same target.  This makes everyone else's job a lot easier.  Warriors, Rangers, &amp; SKs make great floating taunters, especially if you don't have an enchanter to mez adds.  They can round up the adds quickly with taunt/snare and then go back to eating damage for the rogue.  Pullers should be the last resort for main assist -- they can't go get more in the middle of a fight if they have to hang about for assist duty.  Everyone must be fighting at all times!  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :D --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/happy.gif ALT=":D"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br><br>At higher levels, don't kill the healers/casters first if you have an enchanter.  They'll often keep a caster around as a mez-pet in order to use ToT on it to steal it's mana.  Ask the enchanter if they're going to do this.  Also, the assist might want to either watch the mez order and attack the oldest mez'd critter first or ask the enchanter for the order.<br><br>Druids and wizards: once you have evac, OOM for you means &quot;I can still cast evac, but that's it.&quot;  Never ever go under evac mana unless the group leader says it's OK (and even then it's OK to lie about it and keep evac handy anyway <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> ).  The same thing applies somewhat at lower levels for gate mana if the leader indicates you should keep it mem'd for escaping a train.  Also, beware of evac'ing when a cleric shouts out &quot;DA&quot;.  If the cleric is under DA, she can't be evac'd.  Be prepared to cancel the evac and give a countdown so the cleric can be snatched out as soon as DA wears off.<br><br>Special note for ALL casters, including hybrids:  you can stop a spell from casting by ducking.  If you are ducked at the time the spell fires off, the spell will not cast.  Considering the number of casters I see running in circles to cancel spells, this one really needs to get into common knowledge on FV.<br><br>Oh, and a note on symbols and buffs.  Don't use 'em if they don't make a difference.  If you're not using CH and the fights aren't terribly tough, a simple group hp/ac buff is plenty.  If you do have CH, symbol on main tank is really nice (this is for clerics that don't know this -- suspect Steeltoes does).  Symbol on others is pretty much a waste.  For groups where the cleric would symbol, we'd give clerics all gems.  This may not seem like much down low, but at the levels where clerics have CH, the gem haul in a night usually easily covers the 10p per symbol cost of the peridots. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/utwotribes.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Twotribes</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/white_fire.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Board Troll</span><br>  Posts: 309<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(2/21/02 9:19:14 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=398.topic&index=13>Reply</a>    <br>Community Supporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Advise for Grouping... (Told like a Drill Instructor)</span><hr size=1> As a Ranger...... At 54<br><br><br>On MOST if not ALL mobs of appropriate level in all expansions....... Better start casting snare pretty darn diggly right as soon as it gets to the group.  WHY you ask?  RESISTS....... doesnt do any good to wait till it is at half life to find out it takes 5 snares to land one. By then it is either dead or running.<br><br>As  a Ranger I know all about agro. And unless it is one of a very few HARD hitting stubborn mobs... I can simply adjust my self to drop agro back to whom ever is supposed to be getting it (assuming the maroon knows what he/she is doing).<br><br>Ohh and Rangers can tank when no paladin/sk/warrior is available to do it. We can do it....... Clerics dont like it cause we generally have less hp/ac so get hurt quicker.... <br><br>I almost never use jolting blades and think I have cast Jolt twice. I have better uses for my limited spell slots. I seldom mem root, though it is a VERY good spell to have up in the right situation (like splitting the frenzy room in lower Guk with no chanter).<br><br>What I love is the people that dont play a class that tell someone what to do.....  Like I snare and then move a little to allow the mob to get agro on the warrior (doesnt work, I stop attacking , wait a moment and take a step or two back agian) and get somebody saying..... &quot;dont run&quot; or &quot;dont move&quot;  Usually from the wizard that casts to soon ( oh wait, now I am doing it) hehehe.<br><br>Generalities are fine, but they dont apply at every level. Rangers ARE a main tank till 40 in almost every zone. They can and do Tank just fine in all but the most wild of expansion zones.  Warriors cant get agro without some help usually. Druids can and do fight into the mid 20's. Clerics blast into the mid teens usually.<br><br>And in a Raid it is the place and monster that determines style of play. Adjusted to what classes are available.<br><br>I play a shadowknight also.... if an SK and a Ranger are together... better decide (same with ranger/necro) who snares  same with wizards when they get their snare. Root all you want now adays, since snare will still land... but someone please explain to people that with darkness and snare the mob may try to run at low health and we get free hits... you root it and it fights to the bitter end. Bard snare is ok too, BUT doesnt last for any length of time.<br><br>Ranger should snare over a druid or wizard, we can take the beating if the mob agroes and we hopefully know how to get agro switched.  Snared mobs tend to attack the nearest victim unless extreme agro is had.<br><br>Darkness does NOT stack with snare..... Darkness is usually a lesser snare BUT adds a DOT.<br><br>Anyone with the right skills can pull.... depends on zone as to if a certain class is easier to do it. Doesnt do any good to have a monk FD pull in Hate if the idiot main assist shoots an arrow into the crowd of mobs as he FD. Hell I can pull 15 in hate easy ).<br><br>The fact is the game changes at different levels, at different continents (read expansions), at differnt zones.  The problem is some people arent experienced enough to realize that roles can and do change. Some people are to stubborn to change.<br><br>And something not mentioned........ use of FEAR and use of CHARM<br><br><br>You better warn everyone you are charming a mob.... why?  cause it is beyond annoying trying to beat on a charmed mob. Not to mention a total waste of time. <br><br>And FEAR..... dont do it in a dungeon and dont do it unless you KNOW the mob is at least snared. If your gonna do it to safe people.... TELL them so they know all hell is coming soon. Doesnt matter how much you have made the mob NOT hit if it is gonna wander away feared and draw 4 more in.<br><br>Just my experiences <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/uaronder.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Aronder</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 25<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(2/21/02 9:40:17 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=398.topic&index=14>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Advise for Grouping...
