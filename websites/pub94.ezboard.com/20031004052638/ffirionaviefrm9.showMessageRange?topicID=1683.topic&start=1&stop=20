Didn't it feel like there was WAY too much cheesy stupid plot noone cared about?<br>
<br>
The whole entire movie should have just been The Hulk smashing stuff and that sort of thing (I love when he jumped off the bridge onto the jet to help it climb).  Jennifer Connelly I like as an actress (mostly for Labyrinth and Requiem for a Dream) but everyone else just seemed so blah...<br>
<br>

Definitely a good retelling of the story,weaving modern references into what originally was a cold-war origin. They picked a winner for a director.<br>
 <br>
It is NOT a comic-book slugfest like X-Men 2: You get a feeling that the characters actually are reacting like people would,given the situation-though Bruce's father is done -just- a hair over the top at the end.<br>

Watch it if you like some thought and plot mixed with your action-you'll like the combination.<br>

<br>
Eric Bana, Jennifer Connelly, Sam Elliot and Nick Nolte are not the types of actors you'd normally see in an action/comic book movie, but Ang Lee used them very well.<br>
<br>
For those who know the comic book, the heart of the story is not a big green monster, it is about the very troubled mind of Bruce Banner.  The Hulk itself has a number of incarnations and materializations in the comic series, which are a reflection of Bruce Banner's mental stability and his acceptance or rejection of the Hulk.<br>
<br>
While the movie did not get into the different Hulks, Ang Lee did demonstrate how the Hulk's power grew with his rage, which was a fair artistic licence on the concept,<br>
<br>
Ang Lee also modernized the process by which Bruce Banner becomes the Hulk while at the same time relating it, and his problems, to his father David Banner.  The comics have a different explanation of both how Bruce Banner became the Hulk and his troubled relationship with his father, however Ang Lee found a very effective way to tie the two concepts together in a way that works.<br>
<br>
It is a misnomer that the Hulk comic is all about &quot;HULK SMASH!&quot;, it is very dramatic and explores relationships and Bruce Banner's inner workings - which Ang Lee stayed quite true to.  For those who grew up to the Hulk television show, the movie might disappoint you because the television show was very different from the comic.  You should be happy about the Lou Ferrigno cameo however (with Stan Lee as well).<br>
<br>
I felt the CGI was excellent, particularly the scene involving the tanks and the end sequence with David Banner.<br>
<br>
As for leaving the movie &quot;open&quot; at the end - that's how the comics were and Ang Lee stayed true to that as well.<br>
<br>
Good movie all around. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showUserPublicProfile?gid=kanoganv>KanoganV</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 386<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(6/23/03 1:03 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm9.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1683.topic&index=5>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.battle.net/war3/images/human/units/animations/paladin.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: The Hulk</span><hr size=1> Went to see it the second time, honestly, I was simply amazed.

<br>
If people felt disappointed at one moment, was simply because they were expecting a superficial action movie, and they encountered a deep action-drama that really amused me until the end.<br>
<br>
Very good movie, bit hard to understand for those who don't know the comic well, but is really worth every penny you pay.<br>

I really didnt see any chemistry there.  Holes in the script...How did the Hulk know Betty Ross (or whatever her name was) was at the cabin?

The things I liked...Jennifer Connely did a good job...and felt she was not playing the sex appeal angle as previously.  Nick Nolte did a good job in his assigned role.  Eric Bana was ok in the role of Bruce Banner.  The star of the show was definitely the Hulk...they did a great job on him.  Action scenes were great!  <br>

<br>
Haven’t seen The Incredible Hulk yet but I do know this – if it is another movie that I have to work to like I will be very disappointed. I am saying this in regards to the Matrix 2, which I thought was rather bad. I have read all the spoilers and reductions and sift-throughs that people have posted about the material in that movie, but the bottom line was – it did not entertain.<br>
<br>
Now honestly, I consider myself rather intellectual – I like a good philosophical or scientific discussion from time to time, but I like going to movies and being entertained. I won’t settle for the typical summer blockbuster where we insert famous_actor_001 and sexy_big_boob_actress_003, put them all in leather, whip up some CGI magic and fight scenes, blow shit up and call it a movie. On the other hand, I won’t suffer through a movie that is all metaphor and philosophy and no fun. I want both – but more than that I want a good plot with characters that I care about. I was hoping Matrix 2 was going to be awesome – even after I saw it I tried very hard to like it, but it failed in so many ways I just couldn’t. On the other hand – X-Men 2 was not very intellectual – didn’t really have any metaphor – and I loved it. It didn’t try to BE anything but entertaining and I think it succeeded.<br>
<br>
I wonder how the Hulk movie will do in regards to this. <br>

<br>
Their relationship was very clear.  It was obvious, given the dialogue and establishing scenes (i.e. Bruce and Betty at the cabin) that they had an intimate relationship, however Bruce's inner psychosis and trauma (which is what fuels the Hulk via the mutation gene) kept Bruce from &quot;opening-up&quot; to Betty and giving her the emotional support she required in the relationship.  Ang Lee did an excellent job of demonstrating how Bruce Banner is childlike emotionally (he became jealous when Talbot was hanging around Betty and became cowed like an abused child when Talbot berates him).<br>
<br>
&quot;How did the Hulk know Betty Ross (or whatever her name was) was at the cabin?&quot;<br>
<br>
The Hulk that Ang Lee is utilizing in the movie (as there are many incarnations of the Hulk in the comic, depending on what is going on with Bruce Banner) is an amalgam of the &quot;Banner Hulk&quot; (which is the version where Bruce Banner retains some of his own conciousness while the Hulk can exert some control over the Hulk's actions and rage) and the &quot;Savage Hulk&quot; (which is the Hulk that surfaces due to Bruce's childhood trauma).  As Bruce Banner's conciousness is still prevailent while in the Hulk - contrasted by the &quot;Mindless&quot; or &quot;the Beast&quot; versions of the Hulk, where the conciousness of Bruce Banner is completely submerged - he knew about the cabin.  <br>
<br>
If you were paying attention, Ang Lee established that the cabin was a place that Bruce and Betty had spent solitary time together while they were a couple.  Furthermore, David Banner tipped Bruce Banner off that he was sending the dogs after Betty, and given that Bruce knew Betty was at the cabin, it was natural that he would run to her defense - this was planned by David Banner as he was testing Bruce's ability to manifest the Hulk (much like when Bruce was a baby in the crib and David was denying him his soother).<br>
<br>
&quot;Why did Bruce's father mutate the dogs...and how....where did he get the nanodes and Gamma radiation to mutate them?&quot;<br>
<br>
David Banner is not totally sane and is something of a &quot;mad scientist&quot;.  He wanted to test Bruce Banner's regeneration process on something else to see the effect.  Again, if you were paying attention, David Banner worked as a janitor in the labs where Bruce worked and was stealing material and equipment.  His ability to steal gear was made much easier after Bruce &quot;Hulked-out&quot; the first time and destroyed much of the labs, after which David presumably made off with all sorts of equipment.<br>
<br>
&quot;Why, if his father has the same mutated gene in his body, did he turn into some other kind of mutant other than another Hulk-like being?&quot;<br>
<br>
The mutation gene, as the name suggests, mutates with each person/being it is introduced to.  Bruce Banner received the mutation gene from David Banner by way of David Banner passing it on through fertilization.  Thus the gene changed and conformed to Bruce Banner the way all genetically passed on traits do.  Furthermore, and this stems from the comic, the &quot;Hulk mutation gene&quot; is not the same for everyone - it brings out a person's strongest qualities.  <br>
<br>
With Bruce Banner, the mutation gene embodies his deep seated psychosis, mental trauma and rage.  With David Banner, it seems to have turned his lust for power into the ability to absorb the transient energy in matter and energy around him.  I can't remember the name of the villian, but there was a villian in the Hulk comics who partook the mutation gene and it made him more of what he was, so this is consistent with the comics.<br>
<br>
&quot;What was up with the energy-beast thing his father turned into at the end....and why did he want to absorb the Hulk's energy...to kill him...&quot;<br>
<br>
David Banner became an &quot;absorber&quot;, kind of similar to Rogue in the X-Men.  He was able to absorb the energy and power of whatever he touched.  Thus David Banner simply absorbed the electricity powering the incinerator.  Likewise, given David Banner's dementia and lust for power, he was able to absorb the Hulk's raw power.  Again, as the build-up in the story revealed, David Banner bore resentment towards Bruce because Bruce was successful in his experiments where David Banner had failed.  Bruce Banner was merely another experiment to David Banner, who consider the Hulk (the product of his experiments with the mutation gene) his actual son, rather than Bruce (David Banner actually says this in the movie).  There is poetry in the fact that the power that David Banner wanted to absorb from Bruce, was in fact fueled by the trauma that was caused by David Banner's obsession with his scientific experiments and the hurt David ultimately inflicted upon Bruce and his wife - which David Banner could not deal with and which overwhelmed him.<br>
<br>
&quot;and why did the Hulk decide to go underground after he fell into San Francisco Bay....was he in a sewage system or boring his own path?&quot;<br>
<br>
I'd say he was in the sewer system, but it doesn't really matter.<br>
<br>
&quot;The split screen stuff was too much and just annoying...it didnt add anything to the film....it was like Fox's 24 on steroids.&quot;<br>
<br>
Ang Lee brought the comic to the screen and created real life storyboard panels, just like the page of a comic.<br>

The movie is a very good realization of the concepts in the comic, and everything holds together within itself and with the comics.<br>

Oh, and one more thing I disliked was the Stan Lee/Lou Ferigno cameo...they should have put Lou in a scene with the Hulk....Bah...<br>

Thanks for the clarifications on the movie. It helped a little to understand a movie that I positively loathed. It was too disjointed for me. I felt that it wandered around and had no real goal. I just didn't enjoy it at all, except for the exciting action scenes. I thought the acting was a bit stilted.<br>
<br>
And I liked the Lou cameo <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

People are either loving or hating this movie.<br>
<br>
I am of the former persuasion, particularly because I'm familiar with the Hulk and because I really appreciate Ang Lee's style.  Admittedly, Ang Lee can linger on something a little too much or delve a little too deeply to the point of things becoming obscure and alienating people who aren't &quot;into&quot; whatever it is he's trying to show.  If you watch Crouching Tiger and the Hulk, you'll see many similarities and &quot;vaguaries&quot; that he uses.<br>
<br>
I am a firm believer that this is a movie which improves each time you watch it. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon3.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showUserPublicProfile?gid=cieloinfierno>Cielo Infierno</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Assistant Admin.<br>Cielo the Hutt<br>Pretty title coming soon!</span><br>  Posts: 1163<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(6/23/03 4:08 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm9.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1683.topic&index=14>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> <BR><img src=http://www.primenightmare.org/gallery/cielo_3d2.jpg w=50 h=150></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: The Hulk - Semi spoiler reply</span><hr size=1> I really liked it.

I had very few problems with it. Mostly, I thought it took WAY to long for him to become The Hulk and rip shit up. I also thought the corporate villian guy was extremely lame.<br>

I dunno. The corporate scum got what was coming to him-his ending was a definite cheer-maker (edited for PG-13'ness in a clever way,too).<br>
<br>
I think too many people went expecting a slam-bam-boom action flick when the actual film was something that captured &quot;Hulk&quot; perfectly. <br>
 <br>
It really is a love-hate movie,I fall on the &quot;love&quot; side gladly.<br>

<br>
The acting was good enough.  Especially Nick Nolte.  He brought an intangible depth to the crazy father role.<br>
<br>
The Hulk animation was good.  It looked a little cheese if you focused on it, but the animations were very nice.<br>
<br>
I enjoyed the directing.  The panel effects worked well (most of the time) and Ang Lee has always produced rich visuals from relatively mundane things.<br>
<br>
Only a couple of things really bothered me.  The first was the pacing.  Slow in some parts, a little rushed in others.  Cielo was definitely right about waiting to see Banner turn into the Hulk.  In fact, I definitely remember her saying at least once &quot;....turn into the Hulk already!&quot;<br>
<br>
Also, the end sequence with the father bothered me.  It osilated between being unnecessary, rushed, or incoherent.  But then again, I can't really suggest a better conclusion. <p><!--EZCODE CENTER START--><div style="text-align:center"><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://www.primenightmare.org/gallery/kubie_sig.jpg"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--></div><!--EZCODE CENTER END--></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showUserPublicProfile?gid=czakoriah>Czakoriah</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 111<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(6/24/03 8:59 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm9.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1683.topic&index=18>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: The Hulk</span><hr size=1> Hmmm....if you discover you are reading a spoiler and don't want it spoiled....STOP READING!!!!....I noted it was a spoiler in the Subject heading.<br>

A couple points (anyone notice we are starting to get a little FV movie review and discussion group going? I love it! I nominate Kurley our leader!)...<br>
<br>
...Ang Lee's use of the paneled screen was by far my favorite element of the film. Two images come to mind: the penultimate scene in which all of the major protagonists and antagonists of the story come together on the Presidio (or whatever base that is supposed to be in SF) in different panels, all the while a still black and white of Nolte's eyes linger in a panel on top of the screen.... beautiful imagery. Also, the moment which the Atheon executive (forgetting his name now) is killed by an errant missile and his body becomes a still image as the explosion continues to be a moving image around him, ultimately enveloping him. What an effective way to convey the power of the scene without resorting to gore or more contrived &quot;realistic CGI&quot;.<br>
<br>
Anyone notice that two of the so-called &quot;Action&quot; films of our blockbuster summer (Hulk and Matrix 2) have been gleefully sacrificed the standard big budget aesthetic of pseudo-realism (think Bruckheimer films, or any film in which an enormous structure explodes with limited collateral damage) and have instead pushed the envelope of the computer generated cinematic image? I know it sounds ludicrous, but some of the experimentation that the Wachowskis and Lee used to tell their tales would likely find a more receptive audience with the arthouse audience than mainstream America, and I think that is why they are suffering with the critics (but these days if you get panned by the NY Times, you must be doing something right... see: Fight Club).<br>
<br>
Finally, anyone notice the almost complete absence of gore in this film? I can think of only two on-screen deaths (the security guard killed by David Banner and Bruce's mother) and recall very little blood being shed. For a movie about a superhuman monsterous anti-hero, Lee handled that part of the film very well I thought, showing amazing restraint.<br>
<br>
What a great summer for film! Next up, 28 Days Later...<br>

<br>
I doubt I'll head back to the theater to see it again. I was very agitated with the crowd. Not only did we have a moron with a lazer pointer like Czakoriah, but at least four different pagers/cell phones went off. Plus there was a rather large number of families with rather young children. Now, I do love children, and a baby babbling can make me melt...but not while I'm trying to watch a movie in the theater. grr<br>
<br>
Cheers to Kurley for that informative post. It helped clarify a few things that I missed or hadn't thought about. I'm going to have to be odd though, I can't say that I loved the movie, but I can't say that I hated it either. <p><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=692484">~Airawen~ </a><!--EZCODE LINK END--><br>
