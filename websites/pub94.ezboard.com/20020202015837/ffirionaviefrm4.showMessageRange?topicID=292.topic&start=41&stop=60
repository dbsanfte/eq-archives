<br>
Well, of course I disagree...<br>
<br>
Hehe I know my apples from my oranges, thank you, and your comment, though more subtle, fits within the context of the arguement you wove to villify my comments as personal attacks.<br>
<br>
I was purposeful in stating that Shintou's position was intolerant because, quite frankly, it was.  Telling people to pack up and leave because they fall into a certain category is far more egregious than calling them a &quot;turd&quot; or a &quot;madman&quot;.  Intolerance has no business being in EQ, let alone RL for that matter, and I felt I had to put up a sign and label it, perhaps for reasons similar to those that lead you to defend Shintou.<br>
<br>
Do I think Shin is a &quot;mentally defective&quot; or an intolerant ass in RL - far from it!  He is clearly an imaginative and passionate fella.  However as his statements become louder and more profane, it's only natural that his opponents cranked up the volume as well.<br>
<br>
As the threads progressed, some of his comments (on the anti-non-rp side) became far too volatile as did the counter-statements.  I do feel that you are using the &quot;slippery-slope&quot; tactic of drawing my comments down to the level of personal attacks.  If I stated that Shin was a fanatical rp-nazi, of course that is branding him directly and all that he says on the subject.  In contrast however, his statements were intolerant and anti-social - they left little or no room for discussion.  <br>
<br>
You used the &quot;American thinking&quot; axiom as a means to conduct a &quot;discursive analysis&quot; on my claims that Shin's comments were &quot;comparable racism&quot;.  <br>
<br>
First, jumping to the word racism (which did appear in my post) is sensationalist - there is a distinct difference between intolerance (which did apply) and racism (which did not apply) and I was very clear on that within the thread.  <br>
<br>
Second, would your means of discursive analysis seem so legitimate and inoffensive if I had used a &quot;Stalinist thinking&quot; model to analyse Shin's comments?  In that circumstance, you might be quick to state that such a reference is a &quot;personal attack&quot;.  The only difference is the sensationality of the point of reference...the mechanics, and aim, of the literary device however are the same:  i.e. Stalinst thinking = oppressive therefore your comments = oppressive...American thinking regarding freedom = flawed therefore your comments on freedom of expression = flawed.<br>
<br>
In truth, all comments aimed at an individual's thoughts and statements *could* be patternized as personal attacks using the slippery-slope apparatus.  The steps elevating counter-arguements above the baseness of personal attacks however, are formed from tact and subtlety.  There are times, however, where certain statements should be labelled bluntly.  And, that's what I did.<br>

Shint would roll over in his grave if he knew some bard was speaking for him. especially one that spent time in crushbone.<br>
<br>
OOC :<br>
He was a great person to group with, and/or roleplay with but his attacks on this board earned him what he got. Somefolks may have gotten personal *shrug* of course him telling them and all of there friends and play style off, was just as personal to them. Guess what if he deleted, that was his choice, if he remakes on this server and just stays off the boards his choice, if he starts to post the same thing under a different name his choice. Will he get the same responce ? most likely. Martyr ? him not really ,just a guy that wanted to get heard and the folks he was talking to / harrassing blew him off because they're down what they want for fun. Whine snivel complain or what ever if he comes back it's his choice, If you're going to lead a revolution be prepared to die for it, what he did was just duck out of an online comuntity, that he couldn't fit into because of his own actions. He could have let it drop and played the game a number of times, he chose not to oh well. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=rexfelix>Rexfelix</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 91<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(1/28/02 5:51:39 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=292.topic&index=44>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_cooldude.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: *shrug*</span><hr size=1> A lot of responses popped up while writing the last reply.<br>

Robin, I hope you don't take any of my responses as antagonistic or confrontational.  I totally agree with your quest towards civility - I espoused that &quot;Live and Let Live&quot; throughout my posts.<br>
<br>
If y'all wanna let sleeping dogs lie, I'm all for it.  I do find debating (as opposed to argueing, mud-slinging...) interesting so I'm all for that too.<br>

<br>
Just like on Innoruuk, my OOC fustrations were leaking into my Character. By the Time I saw it, it was too late.<br>
<br>
Am I a Hero? No. I'm just another Roleplayer, that got sick of roleplaying just in the corner as usual.<br>
<br>
I appricate the Defence, but Dal is right. I came here, and I talked.<br>
<br>
I threw down my Gaultlet. Their Gaultlet was bigger. They win, I lose. Personal Attacks? Sure. I attacked them, they attacked back. No big deal. They won, I lost.<br>
<br>
So I deleted, and left. I can't Roleplay anymore, not in a Powergaming Enviroment. I left Uberruuk to get away from that.<br>
<br>
That Loot was all that mattered, and everything else is second. Thats why I didn't like those posts.<br>
<br>
Fnf, Reso, try writing a story about your Conquests, instead of the usual..<br>
<br>
WE KILLED DAIN AND HE DROPPED ABCDEFGHIJK etc.<br>

Dal, I can't just drop it. I just cant. I'm not able.<br>

So I had to leave. They win, I lose.<br>

I'm Anti Social. Thats all their is to it. This will be my last post, now can you just drop it? Let it go.<br>

<br>
I guess the hard truth about EQ is that it is not condusive to roleplaying in its current form.  Basically the game engine is Doom/Quake/Half Life with more powerups and tougher mobs. <br>
<br>
Verant supplies the engine and it's up to the players to roleplay - if they want to.  Hopefully a MMORPG will come out that isn't just LewtQuest...but in the end, they'll just make what sells.<br>
<br>
Heheh Kzan, last night someone ingame told me that NWN was just a big hoax and that it'll &quot;Never&quot; come out...I hope not.<br>

It's really to bad for all of this board crap, you were alot of fun in game.<br>
<br>
Your choice though I hope you have fun where ever you go. The boards are really only read by a few, in game actions are what are remembered. As for this server's top guilds they've a long road to hoe before they can even start to claim uberdom, they might someday catch up, but that remains to be seen. The &quot;powergames&quot; that are here are here because they felt it was easier to restart than put up with those above them. Perhaps when the server is older they will remeber that perhaps not. No amount of written word can change those that want to play some way, most just shrug, and a few will dance the board dance because it's entertaining. That is the harsh reality of the thing. It's just like all MUDS exept this one has a prettier screen to look at, for some it will always be about being on top, and for some it will be about chatting. Then there are those inbetween those spectrams and that is where most of us fall. If some folks  get to 60 then max out AAXP then Gah... to them if some folks never make it past 20 and only get that far for the name, but spend lots of time talking and they have fun then  W00T to them. It's a game in the end something we do for enjoyment. I'm sorry that the boards made this unenjoyable for you, you seemed to have fun in the game.<br>

There are no debates on a MUD about roleplaying and powergaming, unless it's one of those &quot;Roleplaying Encouraged&quot; or &quot;Roleplaying Accepted&quot; ones, and even then, it either is or it isn't. There is no inbetween. On roleplaying enforced, YOU are looked upon as the odd one if you're out there for powergaming. It's kind of ironic. People are deleted and kicked out if they don't roleplay. That's probably the kind of thing Shintou wants. As for making it his own world, though, he'll find himself banned faster than Pee Wee Herman in an adult theater.<br>

Depends. What're you looking for? I'm helping open up this great, new one called AtG. We're always looking for play-testers. Roleplaying enforced, not quite classic fantasy. Tons of great features, too. We're making completely different mobs from what's been out. I.e. instead of that lioness always aggroing on you, there's a 1% chance that it will, that 1% chance being something like you coming too close to the cubs, disturbing her territory, or so forth.<br>
<br>
There's a bunch of great roleplaying ones out there. Armageddon is a good one. Lotsa people like it. It takes place in a Dark Sun-like world. Decent roleplaying, but no ANSI color, and it takes a moment to go between rooms, which I don't like.<br>
<br>
If you're looking for PK, try something using a Godwars codebase. I played on some MUD before that started everyone off at the max level, level 50, and just set them against each other. That was A LOT of fun. Lost the address of that.<br>
<br>
It all depends on what you're looking for. MUSHs are for hardcore roleplaying, honestly. As in, all you do is roleplay, no levelling up or anything. They're fun, to a point. If no one's around, it gets really boring. And they're mostly for Tabletop games, such as Shadowrun or D&amp;D. Use mudconnector.com to search, though. Great site right there. If you need any more advice on MUDs, feel free to ask. <p>Vall Shadowstrife<BR>

A few times, you've said you directed your comments at Shintou's words.  But that's notwhat you actually said.  <br>
Let's take a closer look at what you initially posted:<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> What you [Shintou] are exhibiting is intolerance...which is a degree or two away from racism.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END-->In this quote, you say that Shintou is exhibiting intolerance, not that his words are intolerant.  There is a subtle, but important, difference--it's that same subtle difference that your claim (that you directed your comments at his words, not his character) depends on.  To &quot;exhibit&quot; is to &quot;display&quot;, to demonstrate, to bare oneself in public.  This exhibition, in your own words, is not of Shintou's words, but of his identity, his &quot;you&quot;-ness.  Grammatically and rhetorically, in the sentence you actually wrote, Shintou ('you&quot;) is the source of the &quot;intolerance&quot;.  His words are the exhibition of his inward character; his words are, in the sentence you constructed, the exhibition of the intolerance he bears inwardly.<br>
<br>
If you had actually written &quot;Your statements are intolerant&quot;, that would have been one thing.  That would have restricted your comments to Shintou's comments.  You did not, however, actually do so, and your comments, as written, are open to a reasonable person assuming that you meant that Shintou is intolerant--that intolerance is part of Shintou's character.<br>
<br>
Sure, this post is open to the charge that I'm &quot;splitting a hair&quot;, but allow me to point out that claiming you directed your comments at his ideas and not himself is splitting that same hair.<br>

<br>
A) Indeed, splitting hairs;<br>
B) He, his words, sentences, statements and paragraphs were, inwardly, outwardly, outsidedly, aroundedly and alloverly, intolerant within the context of his attacks on non-rper's (which is the topic of this discussion);<br>
C) Exhibiting is the act of showing or displaying a particular trait - a trait which isn't necessarily a genuine trait (i.e. many public exhibitions of charity on the part of corporations are really just window dressing) and thus not ;<br>
D) as per B above, whether I said he exhibited intolerance or his words exhibited intolerance is kind of moot, since he acted intolerantly towards the target of his rants and thus his words were intolerant as a by-product;<br>
E) Despite looking for ways into the fortress of my arguement, you still haven't proven the most important thing...that my assessment that Shintou, and his words, exhibited intolerance was incorrect;<br>
F) I'm tired.<br>

If your supposed insult was so debatable it took this much long winded intellectual wanking by you all then it probably wasn't that big a deal. &quot;My brain's bigger than your brain!&quot; Here's one to debate: wankers.<br>

That's all you're obvious trying to do, because you won't let yourself be persuaded and you're not trying to persuade anyone else.

<br>
Shintou's gone already and hopefully not coming back. Get over it and stop trying to blame people. HE'S GONE. Really, just drop the subject already. I suppose this is going to warrant some pointless, three-thousand page essay on how I used the word &quot;nitpicking&quot; when he's actually just &quot;pointing out people's mistakes&quot;.   <p>Vall Shadowstrife<BR>

All this and my opinion is the same. <br>
Tolerance, and respect of other peoples desires to play here is the bottom line.<br>
The server is role play preferred - dissect &quot;preferred&quot; any way you want but keep it to yourself.  Accept that others might interpret &quot;preferred&quot; differently.  Hang with those of like mind.  If it can be avoided then don't step on other peoples toes.<br>
<br>
Be nice, play your game.  <br>
<br>
Funny how the only people on &quot;ignore&quot; got there due to message board behavior and not in game behavior.<br>

Rock on!<br>
