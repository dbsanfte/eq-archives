The last post there mentions the possibility that there is nobody left in Lupine.  Oh well.  Before I get started, let me give everyone fair warning that I originally come from the Ayonae Ro server, and if anybody has ever been to that boards NAG section you'll know that nasty is an understatement.  Since coming here to FV I've been extremely happy.  Not only with the outstanding RP'ers but with the honest and decent style of play exibited by 99% of the players here.  So in the spirt of FV, I'll try and keep this bitch civil.<br>
<br>
/rant on<br>
<br>
Meritt, of Lupine awakening, reminded me last night of ALL the reasons I left A Ro and came here to a decently civil server.  As I'm sure alot of you know, there were several city attacks last night.  Neriak and Felwithe both suffered.  Being a necromancer, I of course was present in Felwithe attacking the guards.  We only attacked guards, and openly stated that we would not aggro the bankers or quest npc's.  There were several there who challenged us.  Good and evil fought against one another and it was a great roleplay event in general.  Meritt however, decided to end the event and train the Felwithe/Gfay and GFay/Felwithe zones with guards.  Several times, running back and forth training and disrupting the RP event.  Now this is the kind of activity I'd expect on the uber twinksville/d00d Ayonae Ro server from a mal-adjusted 12 year old who hates all the world.  So needless to say when I did a /guildstatus on the anon Meritt I was shocked to see:<br>
<br>
Meritt is the Guild leader of Lupine Awakening.<br>
<br>
What kind of guild leader not only sanctions this kind of activity, but commits the acts himself?  Even now, I'm amazed at finding this sort of behavior on Friona Vie.  The prick wouldn't even respond to tells.  He just sat there afk in Felwithe.  A complete and total asshole.  And I'm sorry to say, that if I ever come across any who wear a lupine awakening tag, I'm adding them to my ignore list.  I won't have anything to do with a guild that has Meritt as leader.  That's my 2cp worth.  /rant off <p><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=464455">Flacon Vex</a><!--EZCODE LINK END-->, <br>

The event was great, lightbringers and followers of dark paths were fighting very fairly, and we NEVER heard Meritt before his nasty behaviour.<br>
He dont even have the traditional RP excuse.<br>
He was only there to ruin the event.<br>
After this he camped, then came back several minutes later, but NEVER answering any tells.<br>
He sat AFK close to a guard right after the bridge.<br>
<br>
As an officer of Harvesters of Darkness, i tried to contact officers of this guild with no luck. I contacted a member and his answer was the most astonishing one i ever heard.<br>
<br>
He didnt know who was Meritt, he didnt know the name of his guild leader ........<br>
<br>
I know that trying to speak with them wont resolve anything.<br>
<br>
Last thing, i want to thanks heartly people who were there making that time a nice RP event.<br>
I dont want to spell wrong names but if i rememeber well :<br>
Eowyna, Ayrielle, Cielo, Silenae, Flacon, Cinda, Vyany, Airnoa, Bakanoneand other i dont remember, sorry<br>
And a special Kudos to Burlei for challenging me even knowing that he will die. You died with honor. /salute<br>

It's a shame, when all goes well, you have a m***on like Meritt who comes to ruin that.<br>

And you EtteNok, i dont who you are, but it seems you need reading lesson. There was no duel with Lupine Awakening, there was only Meritt (the guildleader, without guild tag on) who came there, trained us without a word. <br>
<br>
I repeat the defenders of Felwithe were great (without an annoying screamming female high elf, i dont remember her name) and all was perfect before Meritt acts.<br>

<br>
I was there last night, as stated above by Daramor. It originally started as a payback to Crusaders Reborn for attacking Neriak. Prime Nightmare was there ready to defend the city by challenging those that were attacking. CR wouldn't duel until after they were done raiding, so we decided to go to Felwithe and attack in retaliation and awate the end of their raid as we could do little there at the time.<br>
<br>
We came to Felwithe and met alot of opposition (kudos to members of Circle of Sisters, Saga, and Keepers of the Silent Oath) and were joined by Silenae, Flacon and Daramor of Harvesters of Darkness. <br>
<br>
There was alot of good RP from both sides and everyone was having a good time. The lighties got to defend their city from evils and the evils actually got to have someone to be evil at *chuckles* There were a few minor griefers, but no one that got too out f hand, so it was still very enjoyable.<br>
<br>
All this fun came to a screeching hault when we were met with NPCs from the paladin guild inside the city, then when we zone out, met by the over-conned outside guards on the other side, all brought by a noble barbarian named Meritt. Shampoo, rinse, repeat. This happened quite a few times, 5 or 6 if I recall. We lost several people, some not even with our party. Thank you again to Dalninil for resurrecting the fallen, as it was greatly appreciated.*hugs*<br>
<br>
So, here I find out that this barbarian is the <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>guild leader</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> of Lupine Awakening. I about died. As a guild leader, I try to represent my guild in the best possible way. Never ever could I even fathom training someone for any reason, let alone doing it several times on both sides of a zone. His behavior was truly disgusting. So, we petitioned and he was told by several of those in my party that we had done so, but only chose to reply to one member, Airnoa of PN. <br>
<br>
Airnoa told me what was said, and apparently, our pal Meritt (*rolls eyes at the irony*) thought that training is justified if you use RP as an excuse. Airnoa tried to explain to him that it was against the EULA and that if he wanted to protect Felwithe he should RP and duel if he wanted to. The problem is, he didn't want to RP, he wanted to grief us, because, as was stated above, he never spoke to one of us one time. He then logged and came back a short time later and sat AFK on the other side of the bridge.<br>
<br>
I was contacted by Ellishae (a guide) and she told me she had witnessed his last few attempts with her very own eyes and was waiting to speak with him, but he ws AFK. I thanked Ellishae and wished her luck in dealing with him, and then attempted to contact an officer of Lupine Awakening. The first person I contacted was AFK Trader in the bazaar. I then contacted a member by the name of Vaen, asked if there were any officers available and found out he was indeed an officer.<br>
<br>
I told him what had happened and he replied to me that he knew of Meritt's actions. I told him that it was unacceptable behavior and that we had petitioned Meritt. He told me that he couldn't control the actions of others and offered no apology to me. I explained that I simply wanted to tell him of this, as I would have wanted to know had it been a member of PN, and that I though it was fair to tell him of our actions of petitioning and my intention to post the incident on the board this morning. I would have gladly spoken his guild leader, the offender, but he was conveniently AFK. Vaen asked me not to judge the entire guild based on the actions of one person. While I don't think everyone in the guild would see training as the answer to an RP attack on a city, I do know that it would be condoned and supported by the leader if they chose to do so, because we watched him do it with our own eyes.<br>
<br>
At this time, I was ready for bed, when I recieved a tell from a rogue of Prime Nightmare. He told me that it looked as if Crusaders Reborn had been trained as well, because he saw their corpses all over the zone. I contacted Caladil and he affirmed the suspicion. <br>
<br>
So, here we have <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>2</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> RP events ruined by childish individuals. *pulls her hair out* Listen, this is suppose to be FUN! If you don't RP, then go away and let the people that actually do, enjoy themselves. If you are one of the individuals that thinks training is RP, you are dead wrong. It is a punishable offense according to the EULA and an uncredibly shady practice that won't win you friends around here.<br>
<br>
Now, to those of you that just had to read this, I apologize for it being so disjointed. My brain is not quite functioning yet.<br>
<br>
Oh, and I have logs, so I am fully capable of backing up what I say with proof.<br>

The first thing i see is when i saw him running to us taking damage from guards. <br>

Thanks for answering my question before I asked Cielo. *hugs*<br>
<br>
This little shit is nothing but trouble.  He is one of the reasons Tynsils raid on City of Mist went so poorly.  He refused to listen to the raid leader, made smartass comments to everyone.  What a waste.  I would continue about that, but...this isn't the place.<br>

Lupine Awakening</span><hr size=1> I speak as a founding member and the first GuildLeader of Lupine Awakening.<br>
I do not condone what Meritt did.  Please understand that.<br>
I was forced to leave the Guild and eventually Norrath due to reality issues.  It had nothing to do with the Guild or its members.<br>
That being said, I ask that you not shun Lupine Awakening based on Meritt's actions.  I understand that he is the current Leader, and is supposed to reflect his Guild.  Well, he doesn't.<br>
The Lupine Awakening that I know is build out of solid people who do the best that they can.  During my tenure as Leader (8 months or so), I received all of 2 complaints about GuildMembers, both of which were dealt with swiftly.  People that have chosen to leave have had a good, solid reputation to build their EQ futures on.  They deserve better than to be punished for what one person did.  I will contact the Officers that I know by e-mail, and Meritt as well- my opinion still holds weight with them, even though I am no longer one of their ranks.<br>
I write this to speak for those who do not deserve to be judged harshly.  Please do not shun them.  Lupine Awakening deserves better than that. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showUserPublicProfile?gid=daramor>daramor</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>The Lord of All That Is Unholy</span><br>  Posts: 66<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(12/16/02 8:15:58 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2009.topic&index=10>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_supermad.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: re.

It was a nice conversation, and i only wanted to warn him about Meritt nasty behavior.<br>
<br>
I have nothing wrong with Lupine Awakening, as it's not the entire guild who act wrong with us. I only hope they will react wisely by firing their actual leader Meritt.<br>
<br>
I REPEAT LOUDLY, IT S NOT THE FAULT OF LUPINE AWAKENING, ALL MUST KNOW.<br>
<br>
But, if , within a few days, Meritt is still the leader of this guild, my views of this guild will change badly.<br>
<br>
So i will check his status in 4 or 5 days. <p><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://dcaussinus.free.fr/signature.jpg" style="border:0;"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showUserPublicProfile?gid=wolfaykin>Wolfaykin</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Strength through Wounding</span><br>  Posts: 239<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(12/16/02 8:39:33 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2009.topic&index=11>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_supermad.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: re.

It might. Like if you were to say &quot;yeah it was a pissass thing to do,lying to a guide, and training ya'll like that. I'm sorry&quot;<br>
<br>
That might change people's attitudes.<br>
<br>
But since you didn't, and your post inferred that you think there's a grassy gnoll to be had somewhere, you can count on opinions staying pretty much what they are. And that's a shame, really.<br>

By this, you simply suggest, that Cielo, Flacon, Airnoa, Sileane me and 10 lightbringers, have been paid by Lupine Awakening and especially Zinner to plan all that, just to fire you from your guild ?????<br>

<br>
I wasn't &quot;fired&quot; from the guild.  I stepped down, mainly due to lack of upper level support in the guild, no chance of raiding parties within guild, etc..  This just topped it off.<br>
<br>
I never lied to a guide.  I was never contacted by a guide.  And while we are on the subject of tells, the -only- person whom I spoke with was the Erudite.. Arinone I believe, and that conversation went nowhere (Arinone had valid points, and I was apathetic to them)  Never recieved a single tell from anynone else, never spoke with a guide, never lied to anyone.<br>
<br>
No, I'm not placing blame on someone else at all.  I'm accepting what I did, and accept any results for it.  Am I sorry?  No.  Well, let me rephrase that --  I -am- sorry that any bad views were brought onto Lupine Awakening, and I believe that has been righted now.  I am not sorry about the actions that I performed myself, however.  I believe I was right in my actions.<br>
<br>
Opinions will stay where they are, and I am going to do nothing to change opinions about past activities.  Opinions may change down the road, but what occured is over with, and I'm not going to try and change viewpoints on that.<br>
<br>
If you are going to kill a man, you don't tell him about it beforehand.  Defeats the purpose, I think.

Was it for fun ? or anything else ?<br>
You dont regret what you did, well, i hope after this, you ll never find what you search : support from others.<br>
Nobody talked to you ?<br>
Yes it's true, how could we spoke to you if you camp after training us ?<br>
Why when coming back going afk refusing to speak with us ?<br>
<br>
Dont try to return the situation !<br>
You trained us without any reasons, we were having a lot of fun, and im sure you only did that to ruin our day.<br>
<br>
I heard tales about trains (i know training is BAD and not admited by EULA) but it is the worst i have ever seen.<br>
No reasons, no explanations, no apoloies, nothing, nada, queudale etc.....<br>
<br>
Please explain yourself, perhaps you have an evil twin who used your account while you were sleeping or maybe aliens took control of your body ?<br>
<br>
If you dont want to explain, please leave us, stay away from quiet players, go on a Zek or do what you want but please when you see bunch of players having fun : ZONE, CAMP, and come back when we are sleeping.<br>
<br>
I think you need to reroll soon with another name, but before that think about your act and maybe MMORPG are not for you.<br>
Maybe you have to return to Unreal Tournament.<br>
