The ability to snare opponents makes them a godsend both indoors and outdoors (shadowknights can snare also, but it doesn't slow the monster as much, and doesn't last as long).  They can deal consistently good damage, and can hold aggro very well (too well <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> ).  Their ability to track over a huge area helps insure that you're always finding the best treasures in whatever area you're hunting in.  They can cast spirit of wolf, keeping themself or the party moving at a good clip.<br><br>   On raiding situations, they can end up suffering (compared to other melee classes) in the Hit point and AC department, but for general hunting (which is how I spend 99% of my time) I think they're great.<br><br>That's all OOC though.

They can even tank fine past these levels but it will be dependent on their equipment.(mainly AC)  Traditional tanks have higher defensive caps, their armor has higher AC, and higher hitpoints.  In the 50's this disparity makes a large difference.<br><br>Rangers have alot of advantages:<br>1.  Best outdoor pullers around.<br>2.  Damage dealers<br>3.  They can tank.

Every other class got something. Part of this lies squarely on Brad's shoulders, he was much malignend for having admitted he played a ranger and prior to some changes to the warrior class rangers were BETTER ( prior to kunark) at most tankly things.<br><br>If anyone had bothered to read the material with the game they would have noticed a few blurbs about optimal performance levels and that some classes got good faster than others but then paid for that later on. Rangers fell in that category. at 42 no skill increase occurred for rangers anymore. But this was exasperated when Kunark released and NO skills were added past 50 either. Add in an apparent AI that purposefully targetted rangers ( sorry but DL and Karnors were death traps at first) over others and you had a messy time as rangers adjusted to the new reality AND after months of complaints Verant added some skills and removed some onerous AI.<br><br>Those that dont believe this are fooling themselves. I played those months and learned first hand about mobs that targetted me over 30 other people ( in Fear for example, I am standing at the back of 30 people sitting and the mob LEAVES the puller, runs through all the sitters and proceeds to pound me silly)<br><br>Those days are gone. Rangers are quite good as secondary tanks ( if equiped and mindset right) and the new so called damage dealer. But it takes a mind set change from 40 on. Prior to 41 a ranger can and does TANK quite well in almost any zone they can effectively hunt in. After 42 that is simply not true anymore, a change has to occur in how one outfits themselves and what roll they plan to play in a group. And it is dependent on zones as well.<br><br>A ranger can tank in any unmodified old world zone with few problems once properly equiped to act AS a tank. But after 40 in any new zone and the ranger is not a good choice, usually, to tank. The mob simply hits to hard for the amount of damage mitigation and hit points the ranger has... A ranger CAN act as tank, but is not the best choice and will cause more mana and different tactics to be employed in a lot of Kunark and some Velious zones. But not everyone is willing to adjust tactics. This is true of Rangers AND the people they group with.<br><br>Rangers act quite well past 40 now, as long as they understand the potential limits on tanking and controlling agro. But the old stories wont die and you have a core of players that repeat the old like it still applies. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ujarkellraven.showPublicProfile?language=EN>JarkellRaven</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 786<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(6/16/02 1:33:36 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2154.topic&index=12>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: stupid n00b ?-serious only need apply</span><hr size=1> Rangers aren't RAID tanks.

When you get to crazy raid targets where the level 60 warrior is getting complete healed by 5 clerics, rangers need not apply.  But who but a warrior would want that job, anyway? <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ulunathreee.showPublicProfile?language=EN>lunathreee</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 103<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(6/16/02 3:27:06 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2154.topic&index=14>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> kill the dwagin, kill the dwagin, kill the dwagin!</span><hr size=1> speaking in a roleplay mode, a paladin might.<br><br>st. george &amp; the dragon come to mind, as well as a whole lotta other legends.  <br><br>but not in eq.  don't ask a paladin to slay any dragons in eq, unless you all want a quick teleport back to the city, or so i've heard.<br><br>soo, at the risk of changing the thread's focus, what DO paladin's do?  i know they heal &amp; buff &amp; stuff.  buuuut, what's their role?<br><br><br><br> <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ueliezeroferudin.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Eliezer of Erudin</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 718<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(6/16/02 4:30:01 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2154.topic&index=15>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: kill the dwagin, kill the dwagin, kill the dwagin!</span><hr size=1> The sad truth is this.

However, with AA and Luclin, Wizards are now considered 'Raid Kings' and get great press.

I snare the add, flame lick, move it away and root it. When we go to kill it I jolt a few times wait for Warrior to engage and start wailing from behind.
