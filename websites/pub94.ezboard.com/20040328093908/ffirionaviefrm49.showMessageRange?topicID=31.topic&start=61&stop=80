<br>
Actually that part is not exactly true.  You got your starting Alignment when you generated your PC.  At Level 10 (or higher) you could change your Alignment ONE TIME ONLY to another Alignment that fit your Race/Class/Deity restrictions.<br>
<br>
So, under the old system you were allowed one 'change of heart' that could theoretically turn Good to Evil or vice versa.<br>
<br>
I will agree that this concept is a problem with defining RP purely on 'as stated' basis - there really isn't anything to stop say a Human character from switching between Good and Evil RP on a daily basis.  So obviously there is a lot of trust involved. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showUserPublicProfile?gid=sirienfv>Sirien FV</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#A62A2A>(1/8/03 11:37 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm49.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=31.topic&index=64>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Side note</span><hr size=1> I don't RP all that often anymore ( I used to ALL the time), but if I come across someone who is RP'ing I'll RP with them.  Usually RP makes the game a more enjoyable experience, unless disputes like this arise.  <br>
<br>
I'm a wood elf ranger ranger and when we could choose alignments I picked discord neutral...which is borderline evil.  I can go either way really.  And as such I'm allied with of course Kelethin, Felwithe, but also with Neriak.  Well okay, not allied, but I can go in the place, use their bank, and talk to the females.  It makes me sick when dark elfs who are RP freaks classify me as 'lightbringer' and are unwilling to change their oppinion of me just because of my race.  I do have a storyline (which is made up of real in-game events...nothing was staged) and that storyline along with my in-game action, etc should be enough to allow me to hang with the evil ones...but often times they just can't get passed the fact that I'm a surface elf.  <br>
<br>
The truth is that my character is probably capable of more evil than any of the cursed children of Innoruuk because he IS allied with both, good and evil places...so if he felt like it, let's just say if we were RP'ing, he could start a war and play every side.  He could possibly align himself with both, good and evil players and just get what he needs from them.  Because of his unique neutrality, he has no cares about taking what he wants from whoever and in the end knows that the only one you need to take care of is yourself.  <br>
<br>
In my youth I used to call myself 'the dark ranger' , but even that never meant anything to most of the freak rp'ers.  It was &quot;oh, he's a lightbringer, he can't join us&quot;.  Then I'd tell them &quot;you mindless fools, if you were a worthy race you'd know that I am a dark ranger&quot;.  Still they didn't care.  And that's sad...RP works both ways...you have to accept other people's storylines too for things to work out.  Sure it still says I worship Tunare, and I don't claim to worship anyone else.  Tunare is the mother of all, not the mother of the good.  I'm supposed to protect nature, but the means with which I do that are all up to me.<br>
<br>
(Just a note here, I dont mean that every evil person I've met used to shun me because I was a surface elf...i mean, how do you think I got access to neriak?  I did have some really good DE friends who accepted me and my story and my attitude at the time.)  <br>
<br>
To me it just seems that a lot of people are not open-minded at all about the many aspects and ways one can RP.  And being as how I spent 40 some levels of my in-game life RP'ing I think that's terrible.  But like I said, I don't really find myself in too many RP situations anymore so I don't have to worry about all the insane made-up rules a lot of people have about how &quot;you MUST be an evil race to join us&quot; or &quot;your name isn't RP enough&quot; ...that's BS.  If someone has a name they like and they also try to RP, then don't hold them back because of their name...chances are they also have a storyline for their name.  And if you really treat this RP world like a 'real world' there are a lot of people in the real world with bazar names, but there's nothing you can do about it.  Maybe their parents were crack heads?  Who cares if you don't like their reasons for their name or don't like their story...it's their call and it's their character and this is never going to be a perfect rp world...same as the real world.  Just let everyone have fun.  <br>

Don't waste your breath. I have had this argument a million times, and I agree with your standpoint. Evil is more than race or class. Most of the &quot;evil&quot; guilds are nothing more than a sorority or fraternity of certain races that act as &quot;good&quot; toward one another as any &quot;good&quot; guild does. They aren't evil. They're just segregated. <br>

<br>
I am a Halfling warrior of Rallos Zek.  Under the alignment system, I started as Discord Neutral, can changed to (True) Neutral after reaching 10, actually 15 I think.  Mainly because I was an officer or Order of the Oaken, and I felt that the responsabilities of an officer would curb the Discordant tendencies.  At any rate, per the alignment system, Halflings could not be evil, as it was against their nature.  <br>
<br>
With the release of PoP, I come to find that NPCs in PoK see me as Evil, and constantly suggest I should move to the dark side of town, and warn me about using the portals in the good side of town.  Good and evil in PoK seems to be defined by your god.  It would now seem that Halflings, at least those who follow Rallos Zek, can be evil.<br>

<br>
Ah, you see, that is the rub.  The FV Alignment system (as well as the Sullon Zek one) are/were complete fabrications.  They ONLY ONLY ONLY had any meaning to Players.<br>
<br>
The world of Norrath in the game of EQ, was designed around the FACTION system.  Base factions are determined by Race/Class/Deity and could be modified through killing monsters or completing quests.<br>
<br>
As a Wizard of Sol Ro starting out when the server began, I could be Neutral Good or Neutral Evil.  But NO NPC in the game would perceive or respect that alignment.  All it affected was which PLAYERS I could group with.<br>
<br>
As an Erudite Wizard of Sol Ro, I would say that the world of Norrath perceives me as Neutral.  I started out KOS only in Ogguk, Grobb, Cabilis and Paineel.  I still have the Dubious faction I started with with Dark Elves and Barbarians.  I'm actually Ally with Paineel now because I've killed so many Kobolds I can't give that faction away, even though I've killed many a Heretic.  So I just RP it that they respect me out of fear.<br>
<br>
I have always played my character closer to Order Neutral, which is the alignment I would have had if it were an option (Sol Ro followers cannot be Ordered under the old system).<br>
<br>
I fight for truth and the interests of Erudin.<br>
<br>
Personally, I think too much emphasis is put of 'Good' and 'Evil.'  I think the Racial/Factional considerations are more compelling.  Elves and Tier'dal don't get along because of their very nature - each is a twisted mockery of the other.  Tier'dal and Halflings are enemies because they are neighboring states at war  -- Even if there are Good DEs and Evil Halflings, in general the two societies don't get along.<br>
<br>
Where people get tripped up, is on the game mechanics - Particular Race/Class/Deity combos that are mandatory or impossible.  Prexus is available to very few characters is it that awful for someone wanting to RP being a Prexus follower... Or Veeshan follower or whatever?<br>
<br>
The number one complaint I have seen to Verant regarding RP is 'Let us change our Religions!'  --  Yet the same people adamantly refuse to let anyone simply RP such a change, as if that word on their character sheet which is INVISIBLE to everyone is the most important thing in the world. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showUserPublicProfile?gid=bakanome>Bakanome</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#A62A2A>(1/8/03 3:35 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm49.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=31.topic&index=68>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Side note</span><hr size=1> The only situation where I honestly say a character cannot possibly be the opposite of their alignment would be the redeemed necromancer/shadowknight or the fallen paladin.

Tunare, Rodcet, Erollsi and Mithaniel Marr would never allow necromantic magics to pervert creation in that way (although Brell may) and Innoruuk sure as hell ain't going to let a person go around curing people of illness, being valorous and Laying Hands.<br>

A dark elf warrior, cleric, or anything like that of Tunare, I can see.  A dark elf shadowknight?  It's not even remotely consistant.  Same goes for high elves and their paladins.<br>

<br>
A defined ruleset of who can and can't be evil promotes a stress free recruiting enviroment.  (This has been said earlier I know but I wanted to expand on it a little)  Who wants to waste a ton of game hours debating with someone's evilness.  I sure as hell do not.  If you want to do that sort of thing...more power to you.  If that type of RP does not fit with mine expect me to react in character from my characters view point.  It's that simple, a high elf walks up and tells my char they are evil...my char will laugh in their face.  <br>
<br>
There is no right or wrong here, but if you decide to create a RP that is contadictory to your born people's it creates a situation.  You have chosen to step outside the basic game outline, fine...just because you did does not mean that my character is going to accept you for what you say you are.<br>
<br>
~Dick Tracy walks into a bar, Pruneface and the boys are having a big mob meeting in the back.  Dick walks right up and says &quot;Hi guys, I am a mobster now too! Can I sit in?&quot;~<br>
<br>
Yeah right Dick Tracy<br>
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br>
Another note ~ RP can only simulate RL to a certain degree.  If someone wanted to prove their evilness they could be tested.<br>
~&quot;Ok if you're so evil, go stick your blade in that old ladies eye.~<br>
No amount of faction work with her family is going to make them come to love you.  Forgive...maybe, love...somehow I don't think so.  In game there is no proof as to your evilness because anything done can be undone.<br>
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br>
<br>
I know this is long...here is my wrap up<br>
<br>
This is just a big mess and colossal waste of time to me.  Being a game I accept certain limitations such as rules and guidelines.  Even as such I will always respond to your chosen RP with a RP consistent with my char.  So if you my char doesn't like yours or the reverse, step away and I will do the same.  Them not liking or accepting each other is STILL RP and there is no reason why it cannot be treated as such.<br>

Since becoming part of the Coven, she has begun to bid for blessings from the White Mother and Dark Father - Tunare and Innoruuk perhaps? - but she does NOT view them as seperate entities, more like aspects of the same being and not even really gods, more a force of thought and ideals. Any ways, my point is, I have yet to encounter somebody that has issue with this in any real RP sense. Nobody has said to me. &quot;what? you can't be an agnostic necromancer&quot; &lt;shrugs&gt;<br>
<br>
I have not played Vivienne viewing herself as evil, she has more depth to her than that. She is cruel, yes, capable of committing some of the most terrifying crimes and acts of perversion, but is also capable of incredilble love and devotion, even going to far as to sacrifice herself so those she loves are not put in danger. Some have called her nice and pleasant, others a nasty bitch. Some have even called her good, others have commented that she gives them chills IRL ( &lt;hugs&gt; to the Clan of Brothers member who said that, I love you for it &lt;giggles&gt; )<br>
<br>
I guess my biggest issue is the views of good and evil... true they are RP guidelines... but that is all, just guidelines, not a straightjacket. In our RL, do we classify ourselves as good and evil? Do we wake up one morning and realize &quot;hey, I am Neutral Good&quot;? No, we don't, so why would our characters? I would never have Vivienne join a &quot;good&quot; guild... why? Because she would not look to them as accepting of her magick and powers, not because their charter says &quot;good aligned&quot; only. Just the same as a paladin trying to join one of the &quot;evils&quot;, they would not find acceptance for their life choice and personality.<br>
<br>
Bakanome has a point though, a fallen high elf paladin would not work, in my opinion, simply because their powers supposedly come from Tunare UNLESS the paladin was in a struggle to redeem themselves - now that would be an interesting character to RP - one with dark thoughts and desire to destroy, but the whispers of their loving mother goddess always in their head, trying to bring them back to the path of righteousness.<br>
<br>
Same idea with a wizard of Solusek Ro ( I am not too familiar with the god and don't have our EQ RPG book handy, but he sounds neutral from others' talk of him ). Fire is a neutral element, but it can be a force of both cleansing good and destructive evil.<br>
<br>
Again, do we fall into the race/class/diety straightjacket? or do we go beyond that? I, for one, would much rather RP with the struggling paladin ( and if I was the leader of a dark guild, go so far as to try and invite them in to further drag them down ) than a cookie-cutter &quot;evil&quot; dark elf or troll. &lt;shrugs&gt; but, that is just my opinion &lt;giggles and waves&gt;<br>
<br>
P.S. as to the cookie-cutter remark, I was not attempting to bash anybody, the dark Innoruuk-loving teir'dal is the norm for the society, just meant to illustrate that somebody shouldn't be punished, but instead embraced, for breaking the norm if their character concept actually has an interesting background and story. <p><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://members.shaw.ca/baddog117/vivirose.jpg" style="border:0;"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showUserPublicProfile?gid=eliezeroferudin>Eliezer of Erudin</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#A62A2A>(1/8/03 5:25 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm49.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=31.topic&index=73>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Drama</span><hr size=1> Fajon, you are absolutely correct.
