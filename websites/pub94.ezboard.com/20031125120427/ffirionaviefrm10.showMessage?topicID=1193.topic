Tanare hadn't quite figured out why the shackles to the wall were necessary as being a mighty and tough ranger she wouldn't get lost in the new city Dronkarr had led her to.<br>
<br>
 <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Maybe all the stores were like closed or something and they didn't want me to accidently go shopping while no one was there. These big foreheady peoples here seem kinda grumpy like that, not like Sergy's friends</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> she thought. Seeing the priestess, wearing in Tanare's opinion a cute balck outfit though something definitely needed to be done about her hair, tapping her foot impatiently she decided to get down to business.<br>
<br>
  &quot;Dear Meledy singy-person,<br>
<br>
  &quot;I know like mother wanted you to like keep track of me and stuff so the big foreheady person named Littany told me to be sure to write you and like let you know where i am. I was killing the bad doggies with Dronky and he told me there was a special sale in that paineel city place. Did you know there was ANOTHER big foreheady person city around cause i didn;t i just thought like Sergy's city was the only one?<br>
<br>
  &quot;Anyways, they had some cute fountains and stuff, and all the big foreheady people were nice like Dronky cause they like rescued those poor skele people stuck outside doing that mining stuff with like no pay or days off. They looked at me funny though and seemed a little grumpy though.<br>
<br>
   &quot;So we looked around and stuff and finally he took me inside this building and all where we saw the Littany big foreheady person there, cause she must have been like in charge of the dress shop there. Anyways we talked and it seemed like Littany and Dronky knew each other or something, i think they both knew this Lord Thuley guy or something.<br>
<br>
   &quot;So i was asking about the outfit when they asked me to like put my weapons away, probably so i wouldn;t accidently cut the dresses or nothing there even though i didn;t see any but maybe they are all in another room. Then Dronky put these wristbands on with this big chain on them, they didn't really match my outfit but i figured it was like a free sample or something for a new customer. Then the Littany person hung the other end of the chain on the wall for some reason, maybe so i wouldn't like trip over it or nothing, cause if i tripped and like bumped my head or something i might sue them or something. These big foreheady peoples are pretty wierd sometimes.<br>
<br>
   &quot;Anyways, after this, Littany person asked me to write to you cause she didn;t want you to be worried or nothin about where i was. She told me there were even going to have a party for me so i guess maybe they didn't want me to stumble into where they were setting the party up or nothing cause she must know i like parties and presents and stuff. Oooh yeah, she also told me she was even going to have a special dress made up just for me! isn't that nice? maybe tomorrow they'll take me to some of the shops so i can let them know what material i like bestest.<br>
<br>
   &quot;I know Sergy is really behind this cause all the peoples in his city must have told them how warm and fuzzy they felt about me when i went to visit there this morning. He was just like pretending to not like me and stuff cause that would like break some big foreheady person rule or something.<br>
<br>
   &quot;So anyways, the bigforeheady person is like tapping her foot so i guess she wants me to like finish or something, i don';t know why since she was the one who wanted me to write this in the first place but i think she's kinda grumpy or something. Do you beleive she actually asked me if i knew how to write? Does she think i'm like stupid or something?<br>
<br>
   &quot;Ok her eyes are starting to get all big and bulgy now so i guess i'll like finish now. So when i get back i'll be sure to show you all the nice stuff i'll buy here... oh wait you WILL be at the party right? Ok have to go now for real like.<br>
<br>
   &quot;Signed<br>
    Tanare<br>

    League of Honory person<br>
    did i mention i'm cute?&quot;<br>
<br>
  <br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Finally!</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> Littany thought to herself as the wood elf finished the letter and handed it to her. Skimming it quickly Littany rolled her eyes wondering how the wood elves could continue as a race with such as this among them. Sealing it , she addressed the note to Meledi Weaver, League of Honour halls.Calling a minion she handed it the letter and said.<br>
<br>
  &quot;Take this to the bard netwrok, they will be sure to deliver it to the proper place.&quot;<br>
<br>
   Looking back at the captive, who was staring back at her with visions of dresses dancing in her eyes, Thule's priestess said. &quot;Very good child, now if you'll excuse me I have other matters to attend to. Someone will be by later to feed you if you are hungry.&quot; and strode from the room ignoring the wood elf who waved goodbye to her and asked if she could  have a salad with little pieces of cheese mixed in and a brownie for dessert when it came time for supper because her mother always gave her brownies when she was good.<br>

<br>
Littany!   She has kidnapped Tanare,  poor child.  And that Dronkarr, I knew that paladin was somehow false... why did I not investigate further!<br>
<br>
And she has her write... to taunt me. Gods know what evil fate they plan for Tanare. <br>
<br>
I will need help. No doubt the evil priestess of Thule will have all the powers of the Necropolis behind her... who.. .who?  Willayen? Sergian? Deasie? Bakanome? <br>
<br>
*Frantically she searches for a piece of parchment that does not have music scribbled on it... at last, she finds a fresh stack and begins...<br>
<br>
&quot; My dear friend...<br>
<br>
I have just received a terrible letter. It seem Littany has taken Tanare ... and plans some evil deed with this young wood elven child.  With the help of Dronkarr they have her held in the city of Paineel.<br>
<br>
We must act with caution, for they could easily and callously slay her if they suspect we might attempt a rescue. Any thoughts are urgenly needed... please.. assist me in my hour of need!<br>
<br>
* she signs it with a determination, and then<br>
<br>
&quot;Oh Gods, what will I tell her mother....?<br>

Dear Sister....  <br>
<br>
I call you this. for as you know we are all but sisters underneath our skin. <br>
<br>
I have decided to assist you, to help you. Overlong have you been burdened with the illusion that you can &quot;help&quot; others in this world. That it is somehow your job to ensure light comes to dark places. Such a heavy, heavy responsibility.<br>
<br>
Are you not tired of always serving such High Purpose? Do you not long to just become a woman as any other, to seek the bed of some kind master?  <br>
<br>
Fear not! Lord Cazic Thule has seen your plight, and I will assist you. I will help you understand that some things you cannot change, cannot alter. <br>
<br>
Tanare is now within my care. Such a young and foolish child, so trusting. I will also teach her, that she may be reborn with more understanding of the world.<br>
<br>
This is not of course about the burning of my Temple in the Necropolis.  Such trivialitys... I dismiss the hint that I would hold this deed against you. <br>
<br>
Do not thank me, I do this for you, my Sister, out of the regard and esteem in which I hold you.<br>

However none of this passed through Tanare's mind at all as she sat and waited for Littany to return.<br>
<br>
   <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Boy these dressy maker peoples must not get a lot of business or nothin if that have to like chain peoples to the walls to make sure they don;t leave and go to another shop or nothing.</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> she thought to herself as she waited. She missed the outdoors already and the fact that all the &quot;bad doggie healy peoples&quot; were no doubt repopulating the Warrens as she waited. <br>
<br>
  <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Well maybe Dronky is taking care of them. it was very rude of him not to tell me when he was coming back though, snobby pally guy</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> she decided still a bit annoyed that dronkarr had turned and left without her. <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>I mean we DO have other shops to visit once i get my dress here and all</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
  Hearing footsteps outside the room she called out  &quot;Hey bigforeheady person is there some place i can like get some food or something?&quot; before she stopped as the door openned and a robed figure walked inside.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>This is surely an honor the priestess has bestowed upon me </em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> thought the novice at the honor of being put in charge of feeding the sacrifice before the cerimony. The almost amused look on Littany's face when she gave him the task seemed odd, but he thought perhaps it was a sign of being pleased with his work.<br>
<br>
    He was startled out of his thoughts when a chipper sounding voice asked  him, &quot;ooh is that mine? I don't see any brownies there, i told the dressy maker person that i wanted brownies!&quot; Tanare declared as she saw the bread cheese and water the novice brought to her. <br>
<br>
    Rising to her feet Tanare stomped her foot on the ground and demanded, &quot;I SAID i wanted a SALAD with the cheese not bread! I mean you big foreheady peoples must have like two brains up there or something and you can't even get my dinner right?&quot; she said poutingly.<br>
<br>
   Looking down his nose at her the novice said, &quot;This is what I have been told to give to you, eat or do not eat, Lord Thule will be satisfied regardless.&quot; and put the tray of food on the table.<br>
<br>
   &quot;ooh Lord THULE is coming to my party yippee?&quot; Tanare clapped happily, before she paused and asked with a confused look in her eyes, &quot;Who's Lord Thule?&quot;<br>
<br>
   At that the novice's eyes nearly bulged out of his head. <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Who is LORD THULE! What sort of ignorant fool is this elf?</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
A faint sinister smile on his face the novice replied, &quot;Lord Thule is our Lord and master, you will become acquainted with his ways soon enough so you will be ready when it is time for your...'party' &quot;<br>
<br>
  He watched the elf think about it some before she answered  &quot;OK..um what's aquainted mean?&quot;<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Now i understand the smile</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> the novice thought as he thought back to the priestess when she gave him this assignment. Addressing the elf again he replied, &quot;Nevermind it is not important.&quot; and watched her smile again as if a great weight had been lifted from her shoulders.<br>
<br>
  &quot;So anyways,&quot; Tanare began again, &quot; next time i want like a nice bowl of yummy rabbit stew, ooh muffins, yes blueberry muffins are always good and some fruit juice to drink too.&quot; nodding to herself she added &quot;oh and when will the dressmakers come by to measure me so they make sure the dress is in my size and all, extra elfin petite but you need like exact measurements so it doesn't like hang off me like a coat or something uncute like that. Do you think they will be a long time? Cause the bad doggies are coming back and i have to kill them all some more before they're like everywhere and stuff.&quot; <br>
<br>
   Then gazing more carefully at the novice she added &quot;and you know those robes don't really go well with your skin tone, and you really need to let your hair grow out some more cause it likes make you look like you have a bigger forehead than a regular big foreheady person does and you might like spin around some day and then fall over cause your forehead was like too big and all and tipped you over.&quot;<br>
<br>
   &quot;Oh yeah and like when i can go take a bath cause if i'm going to be here a while to get my dress done right i'll get like all icky and stuff and my hair will get all dirty and greasy if i don't wash it 4 times a day. and we can't let that happen. So if you see the littany person could you like ask her this for me and stuff cause i can't even sharpen my weapons or nothing cuase they're like way over on the other side of the room and stuff when she put them there by mistake even though i promised her i wouldn't like take them out and mess up the dresses or nothing but she wouldn't listen...&quot;<br>
<br>
   The novice felt his brain begin to throb in the presence of such babble and he muttered something encouraging to the captive who seemed oblivious to the fact that she was one. <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Dresses? a bath? food orders? does this fool think this is an inn or something?</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> he thought as he closed the door behind him, a cheerful &quot;bye bigforeheady person&quot; heard from behind as he shut the door. <br>
<br>
   <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Oh Cazic, what have i done to deserve this fate?</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> he asked his god. <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>How have i offended you and the priesthood for such a cruel punishment?</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> he lamented as he knew the priestess would not relent and give this assignment to another, the favor lost would be great indeed for any future hope of moving up the ranks of the church. <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Perhaps she will let me gag her next time....</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> he mused as he went off to report to the priestess. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon3.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showUserPublicProfile?gid=littanydthule>LittanyDThule</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 47<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(10/23/03 10:59 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm10.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1193.topic&index=5>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: A Letter to Meledy singy person</span><hr size=1> *she looked speculatively at the novice as he left.

<br>
He talked of the guard duty as a ... punishment. Almost he smelled.... of fear.  <br>
<br>
*she frowns in thought. It was time to begin preparing the wood elf for the ceremony. <br>
<br>
Fear is of the mind, not the body.  D'Ron Karr had talked of the vanity of the elf.  She looked at the three enspelled mirrors, and smiled.  Within one, she saw herself aged and withered - a veritable crone. Within the second, she saw herself emancipated to the point of almost death, as if a victim of some strange wasting disease. Within the third she saw herself transformed, her proud eyes dull and blank, her neck bent, a picture of servitude, totally humbled and enslaved. She took a small bell from its hook, and rang, summoning another novice.<br>
<br>
Call trolls, and place these mirrors in the room with our &quot;guest&quot;.  First, place a normal mirror in her room. Then, each day in turn replace it with one of these. Note well her reactions.<br>
<br>
With a wave she dismissed the novice, and then had one last thought.<br>
<br>
Oh.. and the brownie we captured in the Lesser Fay,  the prisoner appears to wish such for her dinner. Please have it brought to her, alive, and carve off a piece for her while she watches....<br>

Looking around he found a young Squire guarding the doors to what, must be, the Main Forge.  He ran over, and in a bent over condition, muttered &quot;Sir Reidus, message, Lady Meledi, urgent.&quot;<br>
<br>
The young Squire looked at the stranger, smiled, and poured some fresh water for the Page to drink from.  &quot;Sir Reidus is in the forge.  He is making Planar Armor and gets very frustrated if anyone disturbs him.  Is there a missive?&quot;<br>
<br>
The Page is somewhat refreshed from the cool water and nods in appreciation.  &quot;Nay, Squire.  M'Lady sends only this.&quot;<br>
<br>
The Squires eyes widen as he sees the magical token only recently he, himself, had delivered to the Great lady.  &quot;May I have the token?&quot;  He grabs the token from the hands of the surprised Page.  &quot;Stay here.  You are safer that way, trust me!&quot;  The Squire straightens his shiny new armor and places his helm upon his head.  &quot;He's most certainly gonna throw sometin at me.  Get away from the door please.&quot;<br>
<br>
The Squire calmed himself and gained the courage to open the door.  A loud creak was heard by the Page.  &quot;BY MARR!&quot;  Someone yelled followed shortly buy the crashing of glass.  &quot;DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA HOW HARD IT IS TO GET INGREDIANTS FOR POVARIAN TEMPERS?!!!&quot;  Metal rings came flying out the door and scattered all over the floor.  The Page bent down to pick one up but stammered backwards as the ring was icy to the touch.  He thought it better to leave it lie.  By then, the one yelling seemed to have calmed himself and was laughing profusely.  &quot;Oh, crapola, Squire.  Sorry about that outburst.  What is so important that you had to go and come in like that?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Aye, Sir Reidus.  This has arrived.&quot;  The Squire stated as he showed the Old Pally the magical token.<br>
<br>
The Old Pallys left eyebrow rose suspiciously.  &quot;Please do not inform me that she has rejected the token.&quot;<br>
<br>
The Squire answered.  &quot;I did not get that idea, Sir Reidus.  More likin M'Lady needs some help, sir.&quot;<br>
<br>
Reidus nodded and hastily removed the smithing gear and began to suit up in his combat gear.  The squire tried to assist him but was rebuffed.  &quot;I can do it myself, Squire.  Go sound the alarm and ask Sir Elindil or Sir Lonoin to muster the Knighthood.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Aye, sir.  Ummmm, sir, where are you gonna be?&quot;<br>
<br>
Reidus grabbed the token and tossed it in the air and caught it with his right hand.  He placed his hand, which surrounded the now hidden token, over his heart and closed his eyes.  &quot;I ride to Paineel.  Ask Sir Elindil to bring some rabbit stew, blueberry muffins and a couple of flasks of fruit juice.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Huh, sir?&quot;  The Squire asked but was too late.  The Old Pally was already outside and mounted on his horse.  The Squire looked to his right to see the Page smiling widely.  &quot;Why are you smiling?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Go sound the alarm and I will explain as we run.&quot;  The Page answered.<br>
<br>
A few moments later the alarm was sounded upon the grounds of the Knighthood.<br>
<br>
&quot;OK, Page out with it.  What do you find so funny in this?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Tis simple, Dear Squire.  I had never believed the rumors told of Paladins.  That one just ran off on his own, without any regard for his own life.  No planning, no thought, just pure instinct.  Objective, rescue the Maiden.  Go.  Now.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Hmmm.&quot;  The Squire answered with his hand under his chin.  &quot;Me thinks you read too many books, sir.&quot; <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showUserPublicProfile?gid=olmembar>OlmEmbar</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 54<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(10/24/03 6:19 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm10.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1193.topic&index=7>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: A Letter to Meledy singy person</span><hr size=1> Curiousity......<br>
<br>
He sat on the ground across from one of the skeletal guards, holding a handfull of cards, which quickly became only a few cards.  His guard duty had ended about an hour ago and he was meerly passing a bit of time before going to fetch some breakfast.   <br>
<br>
&quot;Give me your threes.&quot;  D'RonKarr growled.<br>
&quot;Go fishing, give me your kings!&quot; said Jobbar from his right, with a gleeful cackle.  &quot;Your fours!&quot;   <br>
&quot;You've got them all&quot;  Said D'Ron and dropped the last of his cards, shortly to be followed by the the skeletal guards doing the same.<br>
He dumped the last of his gold coinage on the ground and pushed it over to his 'pet'.<br>
<br>
&quot;Bahh, at this rate Im going to have to raid the Warrens or group with the lighties again in the Rathe Mountains just to keep playing with you.  I can't keep up with you.&quot;   <br>
D'RonKarr stood up and streached, then headed to the local inn, then the backery, before heading back to the temple.<br>
<br>
Passing through the temple doors, and careful to not transgress into certain special holy areas, he made his way over to the corner where Tanare was being kept.   He eyed the rough mat on the floor next the serve-all purposes desk she was sitting at.   Maybe coming here in the morning when she was first getting up was a bad idea.....that mat probably felt lumpy and had flees and other bugs in it....he hesistated then got his nerve back up and continued over to the desk.<br>
<br>
&quot;Mistre....Um, My Lady,  I thought I would just stop by to see how you were doing and how the dress tailoring was coming along.&quot;  He pulled up a chair while Jobbar placed a couple of large bottles of honey mead down on the desk top, then stood asside.<br>
D'Ron pulled out a small wicker basket and unwrapped the cloth to reveal boiled eggs, some cookies and a loaf of cinnamon bread.<br>
&quot;Im not sure what the others have been bringing by, but I figured you would perhaps want something probably different by now, so I brought this.   And that juice has plenty of vitamins and minerals in it....good for keeping your health up.&quot;  He said with a quirky smile on his face.<br>
<br>
He opened the bottles and then proceeded to drink his and eat one of the boiled eggs.  &quot;How are you doing with your sewing?&quot;   <br>
<br>
He listened to her answer, which devolved into an assessment of everything she had observed going on in the temple which devolved into everything dealing with her physical condition and accomadations, which devolved even further into a soliquie about skeletal servents, which devolved into something else that D'Ron was not even awair of until Jobbar gave him a poke with his boney elbow.<br>
<br>
&quot;Oh, Im sorry, was I snoring?&quot;  He asked as he looked somewhat crosseyed up at Tanare who was frowning down at him, but had not stopped talking.<br>
<br>
&quot;Your forehead is all wrinklie now and that juice you brought me tastes funny like it is too old and like they havent given me my brownies yet, are they all out of chocklet here?  <br>
<br>
D'Ron rubbed his face and refocused on her, fascenated by how she could somehow keep talking on forever.<br>
<br>
&quot;Oh and Littany big foreheady person is going to bring me somthing special today, but she didnt say what, like she has to go out of town or something to get it for me because I am special and why are you looking at me like that?&quot;<br>
<br>
D'Ron uncrossed his eyes again.  &quot;I think I had better go and get some sleep My Lady, I have been up most of the night protecting the shops from bandits.  I  will be back later and see about getting you some more sewing...things to occupy your time while you wait....for that special dress.&quot;<br>
<br>
He stood, bowed, and then left the temple.   <br>
&quot;Now you see why I pull guard duty <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>outside</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> of this area, near the enterence?&quot;  Jobbar nodded as he munched on a cookie, the crumbs trailing behind him.  <br>

<br>
   Quiet at first, lest the trolls eat her like her mother told her they sometimes do, Tanare waited until they had placed it where they were told and left leaving only the novice behind. <br>
<br>
&quot;So is this like my surprise the big foreheady dressy maker person had for me?&quot; she asked curiously as she saw how her current time waiting here had done to her and began to primp accordingly.<br>
<br>
  &quot;Yes,&quot; the novice replied, hoping that he would not have to listen too much to the much spoken of babble from the elf before he could leave. &quot;Littany has decided that you needed to see how you looked in each dress she was making for you to be sure you liked it. In fact she insisted that every day we take the mirror out to wash it so it can show your reflection perfectly. So don't be alarmed if you hear anyone coming by at night. we will try not to disturb you.&quot; he concluded with a secret smile to himself at the decepetion he put into play.<br>
<br>
 <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Let the elf think it is the same mirror she sees each day, the priestess' plan may have been seen through if the elf sleeps lightly and woke up during the exchange. Now she will not suspect.</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> he thought to himself.<br>
<br>
   &quot;Oh, okays&quot; Tanare replied, &quot;um when do i get to take a bath? my hair is getting all tangled and icky!&quot; she declared as she tried to work her comb through the snarls of nearly three days without a washing. Her nails weren't quite as bad off, as she had early on learned how to use her healing magics to repair her damaged nails many times.<br>
<br>
  Then smiling as a new thought entered her head &quot;Oh and Dronky said he might be by today too. He brought me a picnic lunch too cause you peoples keep messing up my orders and all- i ask for salad and you give me bread, water for fruit uice, though the juice Dronky brought was kinda icky tasting too. Its very nice of the pally guy to come keep me company and all so i don't lose my place in line cause after all i'm sure you dressy maker peoples would probably like skip me if i left and someone else came in instead then i'd have to wait all over again, and i might even miss my party too and stuff....&quot; she went on.<br>
<br>
   &quot;yes, very..kind, of him.&quot; the novice replied cutting off the onslaught of babble. &quot;Now if you'll excuse me i must tell Littany her surprise has been brought here in one piece.&quot;<br>
<br>
  &quot;oh yes cause if you like dropped it and it broke then you'd have like seven years back luck or something, my cousin Gwenny- though she's not as cute as me or nothing but anyways, broke a mirror once and the next day she fell off the tree city and broke both her legs. Then she ran into the inky guy in Crushbone after they healed and he like chased her all the way home. Then her house got broken into and stuff was like stolen and stuff and then...&quot;<br>
<br>
   &quot;Yes, how sad, i must go now.&quot; the novice replied turning and leaving as Tanare yelled to his back. &quot;Okays big foreheady person, make sure you don't forget to wash the mirror so like no smudges or nothing are one it.&quot;<br>
<br>
   Shutting the door the novice retired to the next room over, where a portrait hung  facing into the captive's room. Moving aside the false eyes he stood and looked through the eye slots and watched the subject as the priestess commanded. At once he saw her take out a bag of cosmetics and began to do what she could to make herself &quot;presentable&quot; even though she wasn't going anywhere.<br>
<br>
   As he resigned himself to a long boring duty, the novice knew this information gathered was critical for the priestess, to get a set of parameters as a baseline to measure the captive's reaction to the arrival of the other mirrors as the days stretched on. <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>No doubt this is another test of the priesthood. Unlike the other fool, i shall not allow this foolish babble distract me from Cazic's purpose.</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> the novice decided and found a chair specially designed with this room in mind as he pulled it to the wall and sat, still watching the elf in the room across from him. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon3.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showUserPublicProfile?gid=melediweaver>melediweaver</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Dirges, a specialty</span><br>  Posts: 440<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(10/24/03 9:43 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm10.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1193.topic&index=9>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: A Letter to Meledy singy person</span><hr size=1> *she was exhausted, having spent the night again writing letters, talking with anxious members of the guild, the fellowship, with plans scattering through her brain one after the other only to be discarded as inadequate, uncertain<br>

<br>
 You say, 'Oh, I brought you a sewing kit, but I do not have the instructions or silks you will need for it yet.'<br>
 Tanare says, in Elvish, 'Oh ok and they must be like fussy and stuff to make sure its perfect or their bigforeheadys would like explode or something'<br>
 Tanare says, in Elvish, 'Oh okay maybe i can ask the big foreheady person when he comes by again'<br>
 You say, 'Yes, that must be it....can you imagine the head aches that they must get?'<br>
 Tanare says, in Elvish, ',giggles&gt; maybe i can like make my OWN dress'<br>
 Tanare says, in Elvish, '&lt;nods&gt; it must be cause of that extra brain they have, they probably like argue and stuff with the other brain all the time'<br>
 You say, 'Im sure you could once you get enough practice, but it takes time'<br>
 You say, 'Yes, probably'<br>
 Dronkarr nodds his head in agreement.<br>
 Tanare looks at the tapestry, maybe she can get some thread from this.<br>
 You say, 'Umm, not a good idea'<br>
 Tanare thinks its kind of ugly anyway.<br>
 Tanare says, in Elvish, 'What?'<br>
 You say, 'That was someones sewing project.  '<br>

 You say, 'Yes'<br>

 Dronkarr then looks back at the scroll he is reading.<br>
 Tanare dunks her hair into the water and begins scrubbing intently.<br>
 Tanare starts humming a tune as she washes her hair...<br>

 You say, 'Well,this is an interesting sewing recepie, but I  suspect that it may only be for streight casters, I wounder....'<br>
 Tanare says, in Elvish, 'They get all the bestest dresses &lt;pouts&gt;'<br>
 You say, 'A little instruction in sewing, ...to start with it is best just to practice combining spiderling silks together to make bandages'<br>
 Tanare says, in Elvish, 'They even told me they had a dress that would DEFINITELY fit me and it just looked like a bathing suit'<br>
 You say, 'I will go out later and get some for you'<br>
 Tanare says, in Elvish, 'Ooh bandages are always good cause us mighty and tough rangers get beat on by stuff that don't realize we're mighty and tough rangers and could like kill them easy and stuff but they don;t beleieve us so we have to like kill them &lt;nods&gt;'<br>
 You say, 'Unfortunately I think it has something to do with your aura, ah being a ranger, you have a special magical aura that interfears with what you wear that is magical also.   '<br>

 You say, 'They seem to carry a lot of them around, dont know why'<br>
 Tanare says, in Elvish, 'Maybe they're like far from home and scared and stuff and they know the dollie will protect them and stuff'<br>
 You say, 'They make you look cuter for some reason.....magic I guess'<br>
 Tanare says, in Elvish, 'Cause they know there aren't any mighty and tough rangers around to help them all the time'<br>
 Tanare ponders this to see if she could concieve herself being even cuter than she already is.<br>
 Tanare says, in Elvish, 'Oh and they like see someone with a dollie and they go Awwwwww SO CUUU and stuff'<br>
 Dronkarr peers at the mirror.<br>
 Tanare says, in Elvish, 'You could like fix your hair better if you took your hatty thing off'<br>
 Dronkarr takes his helmet off and runs his hand through his hair.<br>
 Janab says 'Following you, Master.'<br>
 Tanare nods wisely.<br>
 Janab says 'Guarding with my life..oh splendid one.'<br>
 Tanare gives Janab some coin to help him start out his new life.<br>
 Dronkarr leaves the mirror and sits in another chair nearer Tanare, and looks over at Janab.<br>
 Tanare finds more water- is glad she knows how to swim since this place seems to be sinking.<br>
 You say, 'Go ahead and sit  down Janab.'<br>
 Janab says 'Changing position, Master.'<br>
 Tanare laughs.<br>
 You say, 'He does look funny like that doesn't he'<br>

 Dronkarr looks up at the ceiling as if pondering its soundness.<br>
 You say, 'No, I have not heard anything more about it'<br>
 Tanare says, in Elvish, 'Oh i know its supposed to be a secret right? that's why you're not saying'<br>
 You beam a smile at Tanare.<br>

 (D'RonKarr returns to the 'Temple')<br>
 You say, 'I like this place, everyting is so close by'<br>
 You smile.<br>
 Tanare says, in Elvish, 'Really? i didn't get to see too much before i got in line here'.<br>
 You say, 'Well, we did come at a busy time, unfortunately'<br>
 Dronkarr hands Tanare a muffen.<br>
 Tanare says, in Elvish, 'Yeah these big foreheady peoples are like always doing stuff, mostly nmagic stuff but that like helps put me to sleep'<br>
 Tanare hugs Dronkarr.<br>
 Tanare says, in Elvish, 'Yippee'<br>
 Chomp, chomp, chomp...  Tanare takes a bite from a Muffin.<br>
 Tanare says, in Elvish, 'Ooh look what i found in my bags'<br>
 You say, 'And I have some refreshments for you to try also'<br>
 Tanare has offered you a Cookies.<br>
 You say, 'What did you find.'<br>
 Tanare says, in Elvish, 'COOKIES'<br>
 You say, 'Oh, cookies, thanks'<br>
 Tanare says, in Elvish, 'Roze lady gave them to me I forgot i had them'<br>
 Tanare says, in Elvish, 'I mean Rozey but she's been like sleeping a lot lately'<br>
 <br>
 You say, 'I have something that tastes better than the juice I gave you yesterday, a bit fresher I believe.'<br>
 Tanare says, in Elvish, 'Is this like drunky stuff? last time i took a sip of some the room tried to run away'<br>
 Glug, glug, glug...  You take a swig of Bottle of Kalish.<br>
 You say, 'Just a sip?'<br>
 Tanare says, in Elvish, '&lt;nods&gt; yeah was gnomey spirits or something liek that...another pally guy gave it to me, do like you all drink and stuff?'<br>
 Glug, glug, glug... Tanare takes a swig of Honey Mead.<br>
 You say, 'Why yes, we need our vitamins'<br>
 Tanare hiccups.<br>
 You say, 'Builds muscles also'<br>
 Tanare starts swaying back and forth as she sits and giggles.<br>
 Tanare says, in Elvish, 'Wheee'<br>
 Glug, glug, glug...  You take a swig of Bottle of Kalish.<br>
 Tanare falls over onto her back.<br>
 You say, 'Ah, sit up, it will wear off shortly'<br>
 An odd sound comes from tanare's mouth as she lies there, something that sounds like a dozen ogres gnashing their teeth as 10 trolls begin singing love songs.<br>
<br>
 Tanare continues to snore.<br>
 Dronkarr raises an eyebrow.<br>
 Tanare mutters something as she dozes ooh a sale! then goes back to snoring.<br>
 Dronkarr opens up his spell book and searches for an appropriate spell.<br>
 Tanare comes too and laughs at the clinking noise her chains make.<br>
 Tanare rattles the chains some more before clutching her head in pain at the loud sound it makes.<br>
 Tanare says, in Elvish, 'Ouchy! that was loud'<br>
 Dronkarr sighs, and mumbles to himself about needing more experience in order to learn more of his spells as he closes his bood.<br>
<br>
 You say, 'Oh, one minute, Ill fix that'<br>
 Tanare says, in Elvish, 'Oh is this like medicine?'<br>
 You say, 'This is mild stuff and the bakers like using it in some of their recipies.   Really sweet and some viniger,  like what you might put on salid dressing'<br>
 Tanare says, in Elvish, 'Oh ok'<br>
 You say, 'Helps your digestive system'<br>
 Glug, glug, glug... Tanare takes a swig of Bottle of Kalish.<br>
 Tanare shudders at the taste.<br>
 Glug, glug, glug...  You take a swig of Bottle of Kalish.<br>
 Tanare begins to feel ill.<br>
 You say, 'Ah, we will have that constitution of yours up in no time'<br>
 Tanare leans against the wall.<br>
 Tanare begins to cast a spell.<br>
 Dronkarr looks a little worried.<br>
 Tanare bounces up brightly as her spell worked.<br>
 Tanare says, in Elvish, 'Whee i don't like feel sick now!'<br>
 You say, 'Invigerate?'<br>
 Tanare says, in Elvish, 'Cure sdiseasey thingys'<br>
 You say, 'Humm, I wouldn't think that would work...its not a disease...'<br>
 Tanare says, in Elvish, 'They won't teach me that other spell yet'<br>
 Dronkarr frowns as he wounders about the quality of the drink.<br>
 Tanare says, in Elvish, 'But i was going to be sick so it made me feel better'<br>
 Dronkarr looks into the bottle he has just opened and sniffs it.<br>
 You shrug at Tanare.<br>
<br>
 Glug, glug, glug...  You take a swig of Bottle of Kalish.<br>
 Dronkarr passes her another bottle.<br>
 Tanare says, in Elvish, 'Um...won't this like make me be sick again?'<br>
 You say, 'And a muffen...'<br>
 Tanare says, in Elvish, 'OH, wash it down with a muffin and it don't make you sick?'<br>
 You say, 'Hopefully not'<br>
 Glug, glug, glug... Tanare takes a swig of Bottle of Kalish.<br>
 Chomp, chomp, chomp...  Tanare takes a bite from a Muffin.<br>
 Glug, glug, glug...  Tanare takes a drink from a Pod of Water.<br>
 You take a bite out of a Cookies.<br>
 Tanare says, in Elvish, 'Icky, that made the muffin taste bad, poor muffin'<br>
 You say, 'Umm, oh well'<br>
 Tanare says, in Elvish, 'I don't think i want anymore of that stuff'<br>
 You say, 'No problem, and I saved the best for you to try for last'<br>
 Tanare leaps to her feet as she hears footsteps.<br>
 Tanare pouts as the steps continue past the door.<br>
 You hug Tanare.<br>
 Tanare says, in Elvish, 'Aww i thought it was the sewy person coming'<br>
 Dronkarr smiles.<br>
 Tanare says, in Elvish, 'Maybe I should like track her.'<br>
 Tanare sniffs the bottle cautiously.<br>
 Dronkarr hands Tanare one of his special drinks.<br>
 Tanare opens the top.<br>
 Tanare says, in Elvish, 'This is like black, does that mean its gone bad?'<br>
 You say, 'No, it is very special'<br>
 Tanare says, in Elvish, 'Oh okays'<br>
 Glug, glug, glug... Tanare takes a swig of Eternal Night Black Wine.<br>
 You say, 'It takes quite a bit to brew that one'<br>
 Tanare drops flat on her back as her eyes roll up the back of her head and begins to snore immediately.<br>
 You say, 'And it can give you visions.....'<br>
 Tanare something that sounds like ice comets hitting the ground right near you comes from her lips.<br>
 Dronkarr makes sure she is on her mat, then lifts her head up and puts her pack underneath it.<br>
 Tanare rolls over at the touch and mutters nighty nighty daddy.<br>
 You say, 'Dont want you accidently choking now, do we...um, guess we have to cover her too dont we Janab....'<br>
 &lt;much shouting and curtsing can be heard from the rooms nearby as Tanare's snoring interrupts their concentration and their spells all fizzle&gt;'<br>
 Dronkarr laughs heartily.<br>
 <br>
 Tanare snorks in her sleep.<br>
 Dronkarr looks up at the small ugly tapestry and thinks a minute.   <br>
 Tanare burps then hiccups.<br>
 You say, 'I do not believe they need this very much....'<br>
 Tanare clutches the dollie close to her as she curls up and gets comfy.<br>
 Dronkarr pulls down the tapestry and covers Tanare with it...except for her head.<br>
 You say, 'She will need this when she wakes up'<br>
 Tanare pulls the tapestry up to her chin with her free hand, oblvious as to how it got there.<br>
<br>
 Skafid told you, 'Greetings! Do you happen to be a friend of the Heretics?'<br>
 You told Skafid, 'Yes, what is it you want?   Should I consider you a potential sacrifice'<br>
 Skafid tells you, in Elvish, 'Perhaps. But we might be interested in doing the Heretis a favor'<br>
 Skafid tells you, in Elvish, 'AS it happens we want to slay a few of the beasts that lurk below your town'<br>
 Skafid tells you, in Elvish, 'And we are willing to offer a decent reward to someone who purchases a certain key in Paineel for us'<br>
 You told Skafid, 'What you need to do is kill lots and lots of the kblolds first'<br>
 Skafid tells you, in Elvish, 'I did that in the past - but the I wanted to speak with the Crimson Hands, and the followers of Cazic-Thule hate me since then You told Skafid, 'Raises an eye at Skafid&gt;   I cannot do that sir, I am on guard duty....'<br>
 Davorre Bloodthorn begins to cast a spell.<br>
 Mandaril Dark Knife begins to cast a spell.<br>
 Shevra Kollintar begins to cast a spell.<br>
 You told Skafid, 'Within the Temple.    To Cazic Thule. '<br>
 Skafid tells you, in Elvish, 'I do not want a key to the City of Paineel - I seek to open the gates of the Hole'<br>
 You told Skafid, 'I do not have the key to that ....'<br>
 Skafid tells you, in Elvish, 'But I think you are able to purchase it'<br>
 Skafid tells you, in Elvish, 'And I will provide the funds.'<br>
 You told Skafid, 'I cannot do that sir, but perhaps if you were to talk to High Priestest Littany D'Thule when is awake again she might consider it.'<br>
 You told Skafid, 'Sorry about that.'<br>
 Skafid tells you, in Elvish, 'Wish ye luck '<br>
 You told Skafid, 'thank you'<br>
<br>
 Dronkarr sits looking at the snoring Tanare and then bursts out laughing again.<br>
 Tanare mutters something that sounds like shh i'm sleepi&quot;<br>
 Tanare rolls back over tugging the tapestry with her.<br>
 Dronkarr continues to sit and watch, not quite wanting to leave yet.<br>
 You say, 'She IS cute indeed isnt she Janab?'<br>
 Tanare starts snoring again.<br>
 You say, 'Well,perhaps not the snoring, but everything else'<br>
 You say, 'And you get used to the babble after a couple of days.'<br>
 Tanare emits something sounding like a trollish warcry.<br>
 Dronkarr jumps in nervous reaction.<br>
 Dronkarr then settles back down.<br>
 Tanare smiles in her sleep as she dreams of a bag full of platinum and a store with a million different dresses all in her size to buy.<br>
 Dronkarr smiles at her smile.....<br>
 Tanare hiccups again as she dreams on.<br>
<br>
 Dronkarr pulls out another bottle of honey mead and carefully lays it next to Tanare, but not where it can be seen by someone entering the room.<br>
 You say, 'She will probably need a bit of this when she wakes up.'<br>
 Tanare mutters something again in her sleep about her daddy.<br>
 You say, 'But I think we should be going Janab before someone sees us inhere and gets the wrong impression.'<br>
 You say, 'And Im not sure that the High Priestess would want me this close to her either.'<br>
 Janab says 'Changing position, Master.'<br>
 Tanare snores on oblivious to Dronkarr's comments.<br>
 You bow before Tanare.<br>
 Tanare hiccups.<br>
 You say, 'Sleep well My Lady.'<br>
 Dronkarr bends over and gives her a light kiss on the forehead.<br>
 Tanare stirrs slightly and mumbles night daddy.<br>
 Dronkarr leaves out the door of the Temple.<br>

I regret to inform you that you've taken something that, sadly, does not appear to be yours.  Tanare is Sergian's love, and to deprive him of that simply seems wrong.

He walks through most of the city, following the usual, strict path of the Guards of Paineel.  His head barely turns, but he sees all going on around him.<br>

The skeleton nods slowly as it ends the path and proceeds to circle back.  As it nears the elevator exit again, it would almost seem to smirk.  And with a voice like dry leaves blowing across gravel...<br>

Giving it to the priestess with a bow, the novice said simply &quot;High priestess, this bears my notes regarding the sacrifice's day's activity with the first of the mystical mirrors in place. She sleeps now so i shall have the trolls bring in the next mirror immediately so we may began observing the reactions to that one.&quot;  pausing briefly, as if unsure as to whether he should add this, he decides that it is worth speaking and so concludes, &quot;The sacrifice reacted quite...unexpectedly...&quot; before bowing again and departing at her gesture.<br>
<br>
   Littany accepted the novice's words, pleased that this one seemed to be of sterner stuff than the first who even now was being taught a lesson in the cells far below the city. A bit curious as to his odd conclusion she opens the paper and begins to read.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em> Day 1- three hours before noon.<br>
    Subject awakens, the doll in her arms put down as she stretches and comes fully awake. Looking around she rummages in one of the corners- which seems to have sprung a leak recently, and manages to come across some water.<br>
<br>
   Subject reachs into her pack and pulls out a comb or brush of some sort before turning to the mirror. Initial reaction to the sight of herself as an old wizened crone is unanticipated. The subject first appears confused by the image. then she turns around as if to see someone behind her. Then back to the mirror, then back behind her. This goes on for nearly a half hour before subject again turns to face the mirror in an upset manner. Shaking her finger at her image she says &quot;Hey old person, could you like get out of my way and stuff, i'm TRYING to comb my hair, hey wait that's MY comb you have!&quot; Subject now seems to have forgotten that she is holding the comb in her other hand and begins demanding she get her comb back.<br>
<br>
    This continues for another half hour before she rememebrs the comb in her hand. It was thought that at this point the connection between the image and herself would be made. This however proved not to be the case. The subject then began asking her image where it had bought the comb at and how much it cost. Naturally the image did not reply. Subject then grew upset again as her image naturally mirrored her own movements and she began yelling at the mirror or as she put it &quot;the old person&quot; again for &quot;making fun of her&quot; <br>
<br>
   Subject then gave up and sat on the chair, the comb still in her hand and for lack of a better term &quot;pouted&quot; for hours. Sensing a stalemate i brought the subject her noon time meal where she looked at me somewhat gladly and demanded that i make the old person get out of the way so she could see her own reflection. As she pointed i dutifully looked in the mirror and experienced the discomfort of my own wizened visage staring back at me, though at least i knew what was occuring.<br>
<br>
    Seeing the subject's image i mentioned that it looked like her in a few hundred years. Subject grew very upset and proceeded to go on for an hour about the differences between herself referred to as &quot;cute&quot; versus the image referred to as &quot;old and icky&quot;. Only when i mentioned that my own image was also there did the first signs of revealation cross the subject's face. <br>
<br>
   I turned to leave when the subject- who thankfully did not complain about the food in the midst of all this, asked in a quiet voice. &quot;So this old icky person is like me?&quot; I almost cheered as she spoke these words but paused as i saw her brow still furrowed in what passes for though among those elves, i suspected she wasn't done.<br>
<br>
    To my dismay she was not as she went on and i quote. &quot;So if like this old person is like me, even though its not me cause i'm still cute and all (subject did look at her amrs quickly to be sure they still looked young and muscled unlike the mirror) but the picture is like old and stuff then.... that means....&quot; <br>
<br>
Alas i foolishly allowed my hopes to rise as it seeemed the elf would finall realize the truth when my hopes were dashed as she finished. &quot;...that means the service here is like REAL slow and stuff and that i won't get my dress until i'm like all old and stuff, or maybe cause it just SEEMS like i've been here forever like without even getting a fitting or nothin that it seems like i've been here for thousands of years  until i got all old and icky looking. Do you think i should try another store then for my dress?&quot; </em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
 <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em> I abstained from smacking myself in the forehead and sighing told her &quot;No the best dresses are made here, you should stay.&quot; The subject happily agreed and i left the room without further comment.<br>
<br>
   Returning to my observation post i noticed the subject spent most of the remainder of the day pacing impateintly back and forth, stoppping to glance at the mirror, then at her arms and legs as if to assure herself it hasn't been that long yet and that she still remained &quot;cute&quot; to use her own terminology. Finally she grew tired and went to sleep at last.<br>
<br>
    It is my conclusion that the first mirror did not seem to have the effect desired on the subject as her own so-called logic seems to have reassured her to the mirrors effect. No mention was made that the mirror may be magical enchanted by the subject who seemed to have just accpeted the fact that mirrors could show reflections aged hundreds of years. Perhaps such mirrors are common in her home?<br>
<br>
    The next mirror shall be put into place as scheduled, perhaps her wasted reflection might prove a better catalyst towards the proper responces in the subject.</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>

He returned to his home in South Qeynos to rest his injuries. He thought again about the Tanares plight and the helplessness he felt. Paineel was not a city to be trifled with. It is a true stronghold of evil. He feared for the young ones safety in such a place. He could not imagine a full assault on Paineel. He would have to let some of the craftier folks deal with this matter.<br>

First, there was the letter she must write to Meledi.  It was with amusement she read through the transparent ploys of the bard.  No, far better Meledi should live with the knowledge of her failure to change the turning of the wheel. Far better her fear teach her of the true order of the world. Perhaps one day the bard would even acknowledge Lord Thule, and thus be saved indeed.<br>
<br>
Secondly *she glanced once more at the report of the observer* there was the matter of D'Ron Karr.  *she frowned* It was time the shadowknight proved his vow to the temple, proved that he was not the weakling this report would have it seem.  Perhaps this was all a ploy to make the revelation of his true nature have more impact. But by the Face of God, he would prove his worth or be discarded.<br>
<br>
A penance *she smiled*.  This knight shall indeed assist me whether he is true or false.  He shall be told that he is to reveal his role to Tanare, and tell her of the fate that lies in store for her.  If the bubbleheaded elf was not smart enough to see and fear the message of the mirrors, she could hear from the lips of one she called a friend of his treachery, and learn to fear the future.<br>
<br>
She rang a bell, and summoned a novice. Call in D'Ron Karr, he and I need speak on a small matter.<br>

<br>
It has been long since we last met.I trust you are still alive and well, and have not had the opportunity to spend time in the Shadows of the Arena lately?<br>
<br>
I read with interest your thoughts upon this matter. Please send my regards to Sergian, and remind him of my continued concern for his health also. I had not realized my old acquaintance from Erudin was of any particular importance to this young ranger. As I watch her interact with my minions, and their reaction to her, some part of me indeed would hate to deprive Sergian of such company.<br>
<br>
However practicalities intervene. I need a participant in the rituals of the moondark, and to help in the dedication of my temple.  While Meledi has kindly offered to assist in the place of Tanare, I hesitate to ask her to do this, as she is so busy and has so many responsibilities already.. <br>
<br>
Perhaps Zippus, you can think of a solution for this impasse?<br>

I await your answer,<br>

Re: Disturbing events<br>
<br>
Dearest Flamerge,<br>
<br>
Well, I should say that an affront has been perpetrated, one both scandalous and meretricious!  I have found myself so positively and uncharacteristically nettled.  Perhaps you have heard such rumors and insinuations?  I know not, but I must set to record the events leading to my current state.  As to  the perpetrator...I suspect you already know the name, as this one has been a veritable thorn in my side for some time now.  And so, I shall preface this revelation to provide the proper context, so that you may understand my distress.<br>
<br>
As is my wont, I was busy poring over some rather musty tomes that I had unearthed in a far corner of New Tanaan's &quot;grand&quot; Library.  Of course, this quaint collection of colloquial compendiums is nothing compared to the Great Library of Erudin, but I've found that it will suffice in a pinch.  In addition, they carry tomes that have been rejected outright in Erudin, due to factual inaccuracies and/or outright drivel.<br>
<br>
In this case, I was examining a rather humerous tome regarding stars and their celestial flicker.  Of course, it is proven fact in Erudin that the stars are, indeed, magically illuminated candles suspended from an unimaginably prodigious black blanket that overhangs the night sky.  However (and I must apologize for my rather unprofessional penmanship, as I find myself stifling a sniggle as I write this), some seemingly &quot;famous&quot; Gnomish tinkerer has put forth the most preposterous theory.  In this work, the gnome claims that the stars are, instead, glowing spheres of superheated gaseous substances engaged in some sort of sustaining &quot;chemical reaction.&quot;  What sort of nonsense is this?  But you see why such tomes are rejected in Erudin.  Such preposterous postulations have no place in a Formal library.<br>
<br>
But I digress.  While reading, what do I hear but the most annoying ruckus.  Upon recognition, I knew it was none other than Zippus Maximor, disturber of libraries and gnome of mental stature in direct proportion to the physical.  Needless to say, I did not appreciate the disturbance.  However, and I am sure you understand, knowing the nature of this cretin, asking the fool to desist would only provoke him further.  And so, I consciously and intentionally violated the Posture sub-statute VII.c of the rules set forth by the Council on Proper Courtly Conduct and Gentlemanly Manner, specifically the stature regarding comport while engaged in Proper Study in a Library.  In short, I slumped in my seat and hid behind the Volume in front of me so as not to be noticed.  Childish and peurile, perhaps, but effective, as I was unnoticed.<br>
<br>
Prhaps this was my undoing, or perhaps it was to my utmost benefit.  It seems this Maximor was in company of several of the Zuns, the irregular gnomish clan recently inducted into the League of Honour.  I paid very little heed to their conversation, except upon hearing my very name mentioned.  My attention and curiosity were subsequently piqued...as was my outrage!<br>
<br>
As it turns out, this most banal of gnomes, Zippus Maximor, has been passing rumor that Tanare, that most childishly unkempt and ceaselessly chattering Elf, and I, Sergian Singian-Smythe, a proper Erudite gentleman, are somehow romantically linked!  Can you imagine such scandalous insult to my character?!<br>
<br>
Confrontation was inevitable and, indeed, warranted.  Carefully marking my page, and properly closing and aligning the tome on the table in front of me, I approached this gaggle of gnomes.  At first, Maximor seemed surprised to see me, but then, of all things, the insufferable fool grinned!  I, of course, pressed him for immediate recant of such affront, as well as for written denunciation of this notorious fabrication, to be distributed through proper channel and posted publicly, as well as to have himself subjected for censure by the afformentioned Council on Proper Courtly Conduct and Gentlemanly Manner.  Spreading scandalous falsehoods is a severe violation of subsection XIII.d, as you well know!  Punishments, and I quote, &quot;can include, but are not limited to, fine and revokation of Library privileges for a period not to exceed two (2) months.&quot;<br>
<br>
I should think that this would have cowed the fool, but I should have known better.  I believe his response was (and my apologies if I quote misproperly, for you can understand my distress), &quot;Go ahead, report me, dummy!&quot;  At this, he and the Zuns burst into a fit of incalculably grating laughter.  I found myself with clenched fists, most uncharacteristic!  Sensing my anger, the gnomes disappeared in a giggling gaggle out the main door.<br>
<br>
And so, I have explained the details.  I thought perhaps you had heard such rumors, and I have found myself needing to set the record straight, as it were!  I assert profusely that there is, and never has been or shall be, any sort of romantic link between myself and this Tanare, nor any Elf or Lesser Specie for that matter!  And so I hope that I have resolved this matter at least with you, my trusted friend.<br>
<br>
Sincerly,<br>
<br>
Sergian Singian-Smythe of Erudin, Esq.<br>
Gate Caller, Scholar, and et cetera and et cetera.<br>
<br>
P.S.  I believe Maximor said something about this Elf, Tanare, being abducted or some such.  He may have mentioned my old adversary, the Heretic priestess Littany, but I was so positively outraged that I was not in a proper mental state to recount such minor annoyances.  Perhaps you know something of this?<br>

  Tanare is glad that she got a new mirror today. The old person in the other one kept her from combing her hair. This new one seemed much better- as her thin wssted form reminded her of the trip to the gypsies she took with her father when she was a youngster. There she found many different mirrors- some that made you look fat or thin, others tall and short. She never noticed her father go off with that gypsy woman nor noticed their return with grass stained clothes and tossled hair- a smile on both their faces as he made ready to leave.<br>
<br>
   Now the Erudites seemed to have one of their own as she giggled at her emancipated reflection and saw how thin and wasted she appeared. <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Maybe i should get one to bring home with me after i get my dress</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> she thought to herself as the day moved on as she posed before the mirror for hours making faces and seeing her scrawny reflection try to imitate them.<br>

[Mon Nov 03 11:06:31 2003] Dronkarr says, in Elvish, 'Why dont you try making some more bandages?'<br>

[Mon Nov 03 11:15:23 2003] Dronkarr reaches down to support her and finds he is holding practically all her weight.<br>
[Mon Nov 03 11:15:24 2003] Tanare falls face first in the pelts again and the sound of trollish love songs begins to come from her lips.<br>

<br>
<br>

[Mon Nov 03 11:20:07 2003] Tanare wonders why Dronkarr is sitting so far away from her.<br>
[Mon Nov 03 11:20:29 2003] Tanare smiles as she feels the touch of silk on her face.<br>
[Mon Nov 03 11:20:58 2003] Tanare thinks Dronkarr's forehead seems rather large right now- maybe he's a big foreheady person too.<br>
[Mon Nov 03 11:21:18 2003] Dronkarr stands and offers her a hand.<br>
[Mon Nov 03 11:21:34 2003] Tanare wonders which of the 5 hands she should grab.<br>

[Mon Nov 03 11:23:15 2003] Tanare looks down at her hands and wonders if Dronkarr wants to dance or something.<br>
[Mon Nov 03 11:23:39 2003] Tanare attempts to take a step and bumps into the chair that jumped out in front of her.<br>
<br>
<br>
[Mon Nov 03 11:23:51 2003] Dronkarr says, in Elvish, 'Well, I will have to be going shortly, I have guard duty in about an hour, but...'<br>

[Mon Nov 03 11:25:33 2003] Dronkarr says, in Elvish, '&lt;and is thankful he is wearing his armor&gt;'<br>
[Mon Nov 03 11:26:06 2003] Tanare is busy trying to remember which floor she should be stepping on as they dance.<br>
[Mon Nov 03 11:27:30 2003] Tanare looks up and breathes alcholic fumes in Dronkarr's face as she begins a drunken conversation with a point above his right shoulder.<br>
<br>
<br>
[Mon Nov 03 11:27:57 2003] Dronkarr says, in Elvish, '&lt;Eventually tiring of trying to dance with Tanare and not trip on her feet while she is tripping all over his feet, as well as the chain, he place her carefully back down on the floor, slightly away from the hides.&gt;'<br>
[Mon Nov 03 11:29:06 2003] It begins to rain.<br>

[Mon Nov 03 11:30:59 2003] Dronkarr says, in Elvish, 'But that will not work if you give up drinking these.'<br>
[Mon Nov 03 11:31:13 2003] Dronkarr has offered you a Eternal Night Black Wine.<br>
[Mon Nov 03 11:31:14 2003] Tanare nods again slowly.<br>
[Mon Nov 03 11:31:44 2003] Tanare thinks she'll really be a good sewer if she drinks all this.<br>
<br>
<br>
[Mon Nov 03 11:32:10 2003] Dronkarr says, in Elvish, 'So keep it up and you will get stronger. You will become such a great and mighty ranger.'<br>
