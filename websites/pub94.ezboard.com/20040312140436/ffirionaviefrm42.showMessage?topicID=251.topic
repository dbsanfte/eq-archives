<br>
Either NPC or PC, but I need a name and something to battle if I ever get to that point in my story line.<br>
<br>
If a PC is willing to step up to the plate, here is a little bit of what you need to know (if not, please skip down to NPC?) -<br>
<br>
History of nemesis would include moonlighting as part of Felwithe's darker side - what I like to call the &quot;Administrator of Faith.&quot;  This man would be in charge of hunting down either a single individual or a guild which had attacked Felwithe and then pick an individual from that guild to serve as an example...<br>
<br>
Having captured the individual, the Administrator of Faith would give the individual a chance to repent and renounce his/her hate/fear/death/war/whatever to be released unto Tunare's mercy (in death of course), or refuse... in which case the individual would undergo such torture that could only be rivaled by something thought up by someone of an evil race.<br>
<br>
This nemesis would have been &quot;Administrator of Faith&quot; up until about a month ago, at which time his practices were investigated by a ruling council in Felwithe and he was recommended for retirement (polite way of saying fired).  Since then, he has been having strange dreams, haunted by the figure of some woman. She's cloaked.  All she has ever really done was watched in his dreams from afar.  He has no idea what she looks like at all, what she sounds like, what her purpose is, but... having not much better to do with his time... he's become a little obsessed with her.<br>
<br>
Needs to worship Tunare, even though his personality is a little dark.  His motto very much &quot;an eye for an eye.&quot;  Preferred level around 50.  It is my character's goal to become strong enough to track this person down and duel him.<br>
<br>
What do you get out of it?  Some stories, some RP, and a chance to kill me!  Wee!<br>
<br>
I have several outcomes laid out for my story, so it's incredibly flexible and as constantly changing as the future truly is, and I'm all for making it as fun and interesting as possible, so it is not as if I would be dictating to you how you HAVE to RP to me, just some guidelines to follow.  For instance, I, in no way, want the duel to be thrown in my favor, despite what consequences it may mean for my character.  Everything is pretty much open to change.<br>
----<br>
<br>
NPC<br>
<br>
Because I know that's not going to be so easy to find, NPC may be necessary.<br>
<br>
I have considered just sucking it up and raiding all of Felwithe with guild/allies but it's really something Evani needs to do on her own.  Doesn't *have* to, but would be more fitting.<br>
<br>
I also considered that, after this guy's recommended retirement, he left Felwithe altogether.<br>
<br>
So, if anyone know of any outcast lvl 50ish High Elf NPC's floating around, I could use help with taking names.  Researching Felwithe itself, I can do pretty easily because... well... I know where to start.<br>
<br>
*remembers to breathe*<br>
<br>
I am not in a big hurry to get this done in game. Evani is 43 at the moment, and even if I can keep up the leveling like I have, she won't be 50 for a few weeks, still.  However, I do write stories (all on the PN board.  Link is at the EZjump place, and in the guilds section), and could use a name in them to help lay out some history and some groundwork leading up to the duel.<br>
<br>
Any takers?  Ideas?  Comments?  Please respond here or contact me oocly in game.  Don't worry, I understand Elvish just fine.<br>
<br>

You may rest assured that the Office of Tunare Triumphant has dealt most &quot;mercifully&quot; with those who might fit this description.  As an Arbiter of Rectitude, it is my duty and privilege to maintain the purity and strength of the Faith.<br>
<br>
There are those who would see my recent elevation to the Rectorship of Takish Hiz as an attempt to isolate and quell my zealousness.  They are fools.  The position (long considered honorary retirement within the Office) affords me ample opportunity to zealously propagate the teachings of Tunare among the non-believers, and correct those who dispute the correct interpretations thereof.<br>
<br>
((OOC:  What you are looking for bears remarkable similarities to the story I have begun to write for my character.<br>
<br>
Potential upsides:  this could be pretty cool.<br>
<br>
Potential downsides:  currently level 41, and not a quick leveler, My only roleplay experiences involve dice and are several years in my past, my hours tend to be on week nights, with minimal week-end play (couple hours max on thurs, fri, sat. due to work)<br>
<br>
This seems to me an exciting possibility, the likes of which I have been searching for!  I have a great deal of flexibility as I have no roleplay commitments at the moment.  If this is amenable to you, leave a note here, and I will be happy to discuss it further in game this week.<br>

<br>
hmm, the possible difference in level...  Eh, always possible to be able to work with it, assuming everything else fits well enough.  Would be a shame to chuck it over that since there's so much more involved than just finding some guy to duel <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
So, please do send me an email at evaniFV@yahoo.com or send me a tell in game or both and see if we can't help each other out somehow.<br>
<br>
Thanks!<br>

PS:  I dunno... clerics can be mean to duel if you melee and end up rooted.  As a cleric, I have beaten a shadowknight in a duel.  As a shadowknight, I do not think I have ever dueled a cleric, so, no idea how it would turn out. ...if that makes you feel any better, hehe <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top"> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm42.showPrevMessage?topicID=251.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm42.showNextMessage?topicID=251.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a self href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm42.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=251.topic&index=2><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/classic/addReply.jpg border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"><a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm42.threadControl?topicID=251.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/professional/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands</a><br> <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm42.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=251.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/ultimate/subscribe.gif width=20 height=20 border=0 alt="Click to receive email notification of replies"> Click to receive email notification of replies</a> <br>  <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm42.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=251.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/ultimate/unsubscribe.gif width=20 height=20 border=0 alt="Click to stop receiving email notification of replies"> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies</a> <br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub94.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="firionaviefrm1">Firiona Vie General Chat<option value="firionaviefrm9">OT/OOC Forum<option value="firionaviefrm4">The Soapbox<option value="firionaviefrm62">In the Real Life News<option value="firionaviefrm58">Telegrams!<option value="firionaviefrm47">Guilds and Associations<option value="firionaviefrm10">A Bard for a Day<option value="firionaviefrm23">Hero Heart Tavern<option value="firionaviefrm15">The Polling Booth<option value="firionaviefrm65">Information Station<option value="firionaviefrm40">Kudos!<option value="firionaviefrm48">Ye Olde Coffeeshop<option value="firionaviefrm57">Coffee Talk<option value="firionaviefrm2">The Market Square<option value="firionaviefrm22">The Tradeskill Shop<option value="firionaviefrm38">The Spell Library<option value="firionaviefrm59">The Battlefield<option value="firionaviefrm39">Renaissance Festival<option value="firionaviefrm42">Roleplayers Wanted/LFG<option value="firionaviefrm43">The Fighter's Den<option value="firionaviefrm44">Tower of Magick<option value="firionaviefrm45">Altar of Faith<option value="firionaviefrm12">Suggestion Box<option value="firionaviefrm6">The Gallery<option value="firionaviefrm7">Patch Messages<option value="firionaviefrm49">The Dead Horse Forum</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#A62A2A>- </font><a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie>Firiona Vie</a><font color=#A62A2A> - </font><a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm42>Roleplayers Wanted/LFG</a> <font color=#A62A2A> - </font><br><br><br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 7.31b<br>Copyright ©1999-2004 ezboard, Inc.</center></body></html>
