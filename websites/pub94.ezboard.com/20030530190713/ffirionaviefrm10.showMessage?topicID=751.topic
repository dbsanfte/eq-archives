She was running around climbing over the logs and playing with the beetles, snakes and spiders that scurried by on their business. Her mother sat not far away upon a small hill knitting as she watched her daughter. <br>
<br>
Kahina was a small child for her age but exquisitely beautiful. Her long white hair flowed around her framing her young indigo face. Her eyes though inquisitive and caring showed that indeed she was a child of the Father. Strange piercing red eyes peaked from beneath full dark lashes. <br>
<br>
She was very different from most Tier’dal her age. She was so happy, so full of love, whereas most were angry, hateful and cruel. This was mostly from her environment as her parents where both extremely wealthy merchants of Neriak. Her parents were very well known and respected even though they were well known for being neutralists. They did not follow the ways of Innoruk or the ways of any gods. They did as they wished and believed. They believed in truth, justice and strove to make peace between Neriak and the cities of good. Her parents knew that she was special, not just because of how they raised her but they also sensed great power within her, even as a baby. This power scared them but at the same time made it even more important to them that she learned the ways of love, kindness and caring. They knew from her eyes that Innoruuk had claimed her as his own and when he gave her the name of Kahina they had no doubt that she would be as her name meant, a leader, a prophetess and a princess. They could only hope they could keep her away from the dark Father and that one day she would be the leader in a stand for neutrality and peace among the races. <br>
<br>
Alas Innoruuk knew what they had planned and hoped for their child and refused to allow his chosen to be taken from him. He visited some of the other merchants in their dreams and convinced them that they must eradicate their competition, those merchants who would dare make dealings with the lightbringers and enemies of Neriak. <br>
<br>
So the most powerful of the merchants gathered to rid themselves of this problem, sent word to some mercenaries he dealt with regularly. They made arrangements to ambush Aaminah and Astos when next they traveled for business. The merchant informed the mercenary that if the child Kahina was with them they were not to harm her but make arrangements to return her to the city. <br>
<br>
Several weeks later it was time for the monthly visit to some friends that the family dealt with in Qeynos. They decided that Kahina was old enough to travel with them now and that it would be a great educational opportunity for Kahina to travel with them on their journey. So they packed up the wagon with the shipment of goods and what items they would need for the weeks travel and set out into Nektolus forest. <br>
<br>
The party had just reached the western part of the Commonlands when such creatures set upon them as Kahina had never seen. They looked like the lizards she played with so often in the forest at home but these were the size of men and had hard cruel faces and razor sharp teeth, which glinted in the sunlight. Immediately Aaminah and Astos began to try and stun the creatures with flashes of color and to mesmerize them while Aaminah yelled for Kahina to run. Instantly Kahina jumped from the wagon and began to run. Where she did not know nor did it matter for she had only gone a few feet when something lashed out and grabbed her by the waste. She looked down to find a whip coiled around her waste and she turned to see the creature holding the whip. This creature was obviously the leader as his stature and demeanor was more overpowering than the others. He gave her a wicked grin and grabbed her by her hair yanking her to watch the battle. Several of the creatures fell to her parents but there where too many and soon they were overpowered, beaten and tied.<br>
<br>
The creature holding Kahina spoke to his comrades and they dragged the captives away back to their camp. Kahina could not understand a word that they spoke but they knew that it was not good. When they arrived at the camp they threw all three together in a hut still bound. Kahina worried for her parents as they were bleeding and bruised moved towards her mother and leaned her head onto her mother’s forehead and cried. When she pulled back the most amazing thing had occurred. Her mother’s bruises and cuts on her face were perfectly healed with no traces of injury. They were all astonished. Kahina then moved to her father and did the same thing. Just as she pulled away the leader of the creatures entered the tent and saw the miracle she had made. <br>
<br>
The creature stared at her for a moment an evil amused look on his face. He knew then she was too valuable to return to those foolish dark elves, he would tell them there had been no child with them when they ambushed the party. She was very beautiful and tender as well and would make an excellent slave. He was sure he could make a great deal of coin from her body. Finally he spoke in a thickly accented tier’dal, “I am Xaurix, iksar mercenary of Cazic-Thule and you are my prisoners.” He pointed at Aaminah and Astos, “you both shall pledge your loyalty to Cazic or you shall die.” Astos spat out, “We would rather die iksar!” and Aamirah spat at his feet. “Fine! It shall be arranged then!” Xaurix roared at them. He quickly exited the tent and that night was a night Kahina would never forget. She slept not a wink the entire night plagued by the screams of her parents for there were some in Xaurix’s party that were experts in torturing the body, mind and soul and bringing a person back from the edge of death only to begin the torture over and over again. Finally mid-morning the screaming stopped and Kahina so exhausted cried herself to sleep.<br>
<br>
Even in her sleep Kahina could not escape the screams however. She found herself standing in a place surrounded by twisted trees, dark ravens and other horrific things that as of yet seemed to have not noticed her presence. There was a fog settling in and soon Kahina could hardly see in front of her. Suddenly a form began to emerge from the fog, a woman’s form. She was hooded so that Kahina could not see her face as she approached but when she reached Kahina she drew back the hood to reveal the most beautiful face Kahina had ever seen. Dark yellow eyes stared back at her surrounded by flawless indigo skin. Suddenly a cruel smile appeared on the woman’s face and she let loose with a strange cackle. “You are mine now child, come take my hand.” And she reached out to Kahina.<br>
<br>
Suddenly the sky lit up with lightning as a loud voice boomed “LEAVE HER BE TERRIS! SHE IS MINE!” Next thing Kahina knew she was not standing in the same place, instead she was standing in a large room and there was a man seated on a throne before her. She could hear the echoes of the woman called Terris as she howled in rage. She looked up at the man seated on the throne and he chuckled. “Just like Terris to always try and steal my chosen few from me. Now then my dear, do you know who I am?”<br>
<br>
Kahina looked up at him wide eyed, “N-no sir I don’t” she replied hesitantly.<br>
<br>
He looked at her a bit surprised yet amused. “I am Innoruuk, Dark Prince of Hate, and you are one of my children. I have chosen you to be one of my priestesses in the force of Hate.”<br>
<br>
“What is hate sir? I do not know this word.” She looked up at him confused.<br>
<br>
“Ahh what is hate? I am hate. You stand here before me because of hate. Do you feel that burning inside of you?” She nodded her head. “That burning is hatred and rage. You want to hurt and kill those that killed your parents correct?”<br>
<br>
“Yes sir.” Kahina said with a distant cold expression in her eyes.<br>
<br>
“You will my dear, you will. You will become a very powerful priestess and force to be reckoned with that is for sure. Do not be foolish though. Do not try to exact your revenge until you have learned more and are stronger in Hate. You will know when the time is right to rip the tongues and hearts from the Iksar that have done this to you. In the meantime you must endure each trial that they put you through, you must find a way to turn it into hatred so that you may grow stronger. They intend to sell you to men. Use this to learn how to manipulate men, see what gifts you can extract from the men and how well you can hide them from your captors. If you do well and succeed you will have enough strength, money and power to exact your revenge on the entire iksar race, and then the world. You will be at the forefront of my army in the fight for Hate in time but you must learn to use those around you, even if it is an iksar or lightbringer, use anything they are foolish enough to give you to your advantage as you grow until the time comes that you will not need such things and can call upon your friends and allies of Hate. Now bow before me and return to your sleep but do not forget what I have said.” <br>
<br>
“Yes sir.” Kahina said as she bowed before Innoruuk. When she raised herself up again it was morning and she was sitting up in bed. She turned to look around the tent but she knew she would find no sign of them. Kahina sighed sad at the loss of her parents and was about to cry until the flap to her tent opened and the iksar head poked in to sneer at her. “Come wench, as of today you are a slave and your training as such begins.” Kahina instantly felt the rage of hatred well up inside of her and she took strength from it and returned the iksar’s look with a deep penetrating stare that stopped him in his tracks for a moment. When he broke from the stare he let out a hiss of anger and grabbed her by her hair dragging her out of the tent. <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Patience, patience</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> she thought <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>remember what the Father said, I must use them to fuel my hatred and anger and grow strong in hate and then I shall enjoy ripping them apart with my bare hands.</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> This thought comforted her and she did not make a sound as he yanked her about by her hair. She had found her savior, she had found her lord, she was to be Innoruuk’s Priestess and destroy the world in the name of Hate.<br>
