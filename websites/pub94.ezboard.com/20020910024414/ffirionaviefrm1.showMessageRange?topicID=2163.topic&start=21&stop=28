(No, not saying twinking is equivalent to scamming... reread sentence if you think it says that.)<br>
<br>
Which is why roleplay can't be the end-all, defining virtue. It has to be balanced against game mechanics and basic player fairness and campaign context and all that stuff. And against the overall effect that [insert action here] has on the game long-term. Some perfectly decent roleplay things wind up falling by the wayside to accomodate those other priorities.<br>
<br>
There are viable roleplay reasons why folks should be able to start level 60 EQ characters, too. Doesn't mean it would be good for the game, or for Verant's bottom line.<br>

 <br>
     A short while after starting my high-elf cleric, and traveling to Qeynos for...well, honestly, I forget for what, but I was there, some human male approaches her as she stood in front of the soul binder.  He proceeded to crudely flirt with her, making not so clever sexual innuduoes.  Things like &quot;You're very appetizing... I'd love a cup of Tea! (my character's name is Teapray).&quot;   I played the haughty high-elf well, and answered in character the way one would expect a lady to.  I was fairly civil though..I think the worst thing I told him is that  &quot;I don't need compliments from the likes of you&quot;.  He got mad then, and informed me that this was role-playing server.  Didn't I know how to roleplay?   Apparently, he expected any female he ran across to roleplay as an air-headed slut.  I was getting tells from others nearby telling me what an idiot he was, and to stand my ground.  By their criteria, I was role-playing just fine.<br>
   Also, my character is in love with an ogre warrior, who is in real life played by my husband.  I am in love with my husband.  I have a strong back-story on why we are together.  Good role-playing?  Several people who just meet us seem to think not, till they talk to us, and then decide we are fine role-players.  /shrug.<br>

It is true though, there is absolutely nothing that can't have an RP story pasted to it. You don't need to be on FV to RP that way though, since it's the expected norm on all of the other servers. VI failed the RP community by not providing concrete rules here. To their credit though, they've at least stopped leading the RPer on and have clearly abandoned the idea of an RP server. They should take the next step soon by removing that slap in the face RP Preferred label and replace it with Special Rules or something. <br>
<br>
Why bother inventing a RP excuse to twink? But if we must: My level 10 ENC wrote a desperate letter to The Diety Formerly Known as Prince of Hate. The.. let's just call him &quot;&amp;&quot; for short... &amp; was moved deeply by this plea for ubber equipment and empowered the little gnome with the gift of parent selection. The gnome chose 2 lizards, whom were quite accomplished and wealthy, to be his parents. The lizards truely loved their little gift from &amp;, for now they had 160 more inventory slots in which to stuff all maner of lewts and stuff. As time went by, the gnome grew up. When he was nearly 8 hours and 11 seasons old, he declared, &quot;Faction Smaction!, I want to kill something!&quot; His very supportive parents quickly agreed that he could wear anything he wanted, and as soon as he /auctioned off those other 14 trader satchels of gear he should be on his way to seek his own fame and fortune. And thus begins his own story... <p><CENTER>

But that is not what counts. What counts is the quality of the story, and how does it go on. The story Zariss posted does not. It is merely an explanation for something - and a weak one at best.<br>
<br>
Teapray's story does go on. It is played. There is a significant difference there. Many things can be played. And it can generate wonderful situations, for roleplay, as long as all involved accept the challenge, and roleplay it, rather than going ooc and mouthing off.<br>
<br>
In my eyes, it is the pervect example why rules can never truly work for rp. Any rules set would have made this tale impossible. But it is not. It is possible, and can generate interesting roleplay. That is, as long as there arent dozens of ogre-highelf pairs. And as long as the players are willing to accept that their characters might be ridiculed, scorned, and left out of groups, because of their 'love'. <p>Silenae Do'Bauthin<br><br>

--------------------------<br>
<br>
The rules on the DAOC servers are simple: No inappropriate names and no OOC speech in public.<br>
<br>
For the most part, both rules work and they provide a much more pleasant environment.<br>
<br>
However, they are so popular with gamers, that people just seeking escape from d00diespeak flooded the RP servers. That's the biggest problem because it did dilute the amount of real roleplaying.<br>
<br>
DAOC also has very small server populations because the servers are split into 3 realms and it makes it very hard to get away from people, which degrades the ability to get roleplaying going. I've been on raids where a full third of everyone on the server was taking part. I suspect the rules would work far far better in a PVE game like EQ where you don't need to deal with everyone.<br>
<br>
It's far far from perfect, but for roleplayers it's a heck of a lot easier to roleplay when you don't have idiot names running around babbling about nascar or whatever.<br>
<br>
As far as &quot;who's roleplaying.&quot; This is really a red herring. It just never comes up. There were some people who played it very close to real medieval and others who were pretty free form with it. But it just never became an issue--people lived and let live. Roleplayers are nice people for the most part and are so grateful to have any bone thrown to them that they try to make it work. Not to mention that there are enough non-roleplayers to worry about. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/unumtinae.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Numtinae</A> at: 6/20/02 2:15:22 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/uteapray.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Teapray</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 9<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(6/20/02 11:27:23 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2163.topic&index=27>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: If FV was role play enforced</span><hr size=1> There's no need to put &quot;love&quot; in quotion marks, Silenae.  We really are in love, and our characters are too.   And we do accept that some may not want to group with us.  In fact, it kinda plays into our backstory.  Teapray, while  rebellious to her family, really does love and miss them, and would be delighted if her father would accept her new love, and let her go back home to the wealth of her family.  She tries hard to get other elves to accept Lenny, in hopes that they words of his worth might get back to her father and sway his judgement.  But she knows it is going to be an up-hill battle.  If everyone accepted us, it would kinda kill that aspect of the roleplaying.  It's more fun when others play along, by telling us what disgraces we are.<br>
For what it's worth, I much rather be around the dark elf I met in the Paladul Caverns, who kept snarling at me meanly and telling me how much he would enjoy the sight of Innoruuk feasting on my entrails, then the many, many people who have responded to my drive-by buffs with &quot;thx&quot; or use &quot;o i c&quot;  when I answered a question for  them.<br>
