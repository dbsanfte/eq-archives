&gt; them' situation?<br>
<br>
Historically, almost every ‘great’ leader that has existed across the ages.<br>
<br>
Humans - especially males - feel the need to belong to a distinct group.  Family, clan, tribe, state, nation, team, sect, camp, party, wing, division, whatever.<br>
<br>
Moreover, they want to feel that ‘their’ particular group is special.  Perhaps they feel that it is special because it is superior in some way to another group.  Perhaps they feel that it is special because it is NOT superior to another group.  Sometimes it is purported to be special because it is in direct competition (or being persecuted by) another faction.  Sometimes the ‘special’ perception is gained because they are different (physically, geographically, emotionally, sexually, whatever) from the majority of other groups.<br>
<br>
Whatever the reason you belong to a particular group, the tendency is there to identify with your chosen group and feel less ‘good’ about all the other groups… especially if you are unable to ‘switch’ groups.  The classic ‘us vs. them’.<br>
<br>
Effective leaders have always used this dynamic.  I’ll not draw the wrath of Godwin down on this thread by citing the obvious example.  <br>
<br>
And despite horrific examples of factionalism, this is not usually a bad thing.  People tend to perform better if they ‘believe’ in their group.  Any US high school you can point to uses this dynamic to build “team spirit” through propaganda rallies, uniforms, iconography, etc.  The civil rights movement in the 60s created and utilized a strong sense of cultural identity in the African-American community to effect significant change on the US political landscape.<br>
<br>
Now, I personally can’t seem to identify myself as a “Role-Player” despite the fact that I stay in character pretty much all the time.  I find it much more satisfying to identify with the FV server – after all, with our more challenging ruleset and the issues of the low population and TLC code, we are obviously superior to the people on all those OTHER servers out there, right?<br>

<br>
SOME of the RP'ers dislike the powergamers. VERY FEW of the PG'ers dislike the roleplayers. While I will dress someone down for speaking l33t to me, I can't condone factionalization in any arena.<br>
<br>
Furthermore, a 'great' leader uniting people against a common adversary is hardly the same as creating internecine struggle for its own sake (which I believe the RP vs PG thing is). The leaders who fought against bigotry can hardly be compared to hitler and Stalin.<br>
<br>
And another thing: pride in one's own accomplishments, memberships and belonging does not equate to group spirit necessarily. <br>
<br>
This is an example. While a person who has a lot of pride in the organization can HELP morale, this is not a guarantee. This is because frequently people with overwhelming pride can frequently drive those who view things in moderation away by accusing them of 'having less spirit,' 'having less pride,' 'not being a team player,' and 'not carrying their weight,' solely because they are not zealots.<br>
<br>
Frequently, the moderate voices are people with skills and talents not normally found in zealots.<br>
<br>
So, I strongly suggest that we do NOT keep an uncompromising attitude towards outsiders, newcomers, and powergamers...<br>
<br>
Especially considering that eventually, we will all be 50+ on the same server and you will be then sharing space with the aformentioned powergamers...<br>
<br>
Or needing them to help you do something... <p>Nakath<BR>

1) The healthy gay hangouts I've been to never seemed to mind when hets came by to hang out -- so long as it was to enjoy the place rather than to own the place.  (Yes, there were those who went feeling like they had every right to gawk and generally invade privacy.)<br>

2) I think it's useful to observe how the two &quot;conflicting&quot; elements in one community works out a safe/respectful coexistence, and then apply what's been learned to the elements in another community.  (I use what I've learned in RL in my games, just like I use what I've learned in games in RL.)<br>

Naketh, I composed a couple responses to your post, but I couldn’t manage to get my point across without sounding too inflammatory.

1) we are PGeers, we're here, get used to it.<br>
2) I do not have to defend my existence here to anyone and if asked will give the enquirer what they deserve ... rank hostility. If this bothers you I suggest one of 2 things: Stay the hell away from the soapbox, OR don't post pointless bleating and drivel in the first place.<br>
3) Robin to your infinite surprise I do not find your posts enthralling, informative, or possessing of a point, EVER. I also find your comparison in this case an insult to gay people's struggle, and to the gamers here insulting at best. Leap to his defence if you disagree, you'll find I don't care.<br>
4) It is highly amusing that the likes of Shintou feared the server would becoming a squabbling mess, when Viola! look what is happening. Not over spawns, in this case, but nonetheless that's what you prima-donnas got. Truth is I respected your right and attempts to roleplay from day one, and participated myself. Now I am laughing at the fact that a select few are doing their best to turn the very server they bleated to defend into their own ... worst ... nightmare.  <br>
5) regarding the above, it is not too late for this server. Learn when it is appropriate to STFU and open your eyes, and to drop your jesus complex. <br>
6) No offence to the RPer's out there who are just playing and managing not to bleat like baby lambs. You liven up the game and make this server unique. I salute you.<br>
7) Re-read if there is ANY confusion. I have been pretty blunt and to the point, something which is rare on this board. It is in fact a more appropriate and effective way to communicate. Try it you might like it. Avoid it if in fact you have nothing to say but feel the urge to post anyway. <br>

Conclusion: Up until lately I have been extremely good natured about this nonsense. My hunting partners and friends in the upper echelons are continuing to be good natured about it. For me, that time has passed. Barring further provocation, I am done with this topic. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=milosh>Milosh</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 7<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(2/4/02 7:07:27 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=317.topic&index=31>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Godwin's Law</span><hr size=1> &quot;As an internet discussion grows longer, the probability of a comparison involving Nazis or Hitler approaches one.&quot; Score one for Godwin's Law!<br>

&quot;I also find your comparison in this case an insult to gay people's struggle&quot;<br>
<br>
As a gay man myself, who's been long involved in queer politics, I have to ask what authority you believe gives you the right to make this claim on behalf of &quot;gay people's [sic] struggle&quot;?<br>
<br>
As for the rest, well, it's just an ad hominem attack that, from me, is going to get the treatment it deserves.<br>
<br>
[Edit: &quot;Milosh: I didn't notice the 'nazi' reference in Sliver123's post ending the 1-20 section of this thread.  Good call.  Seems we're invoking Godwin's a lot lately on this message board, and usually on the same people.&quot;]<br>

I was never persecuted whatsoever on my old server. Heck I was treated very well. I was twinked occasionally by higher-ups and generous guildmates that knew me. Sure I would roleplay some, and they would give me funny looks.... but otherwise they never really said anything about it. It was never an issue for me. <br>
<br>
And I think that there are many people here like myself... who play now on FV, but have no reservations about going back to visit and play an alt on their old server every now and then. My reason for looking back on my old server? The friends and the people. <br>
<br>
You can leave phat lewt behind... but tis hard to leave good friends behind. <br>
<br>
OTOH, I'm quickly finding great people and friends on this server, many of them from the guild I recently joined. <br>

Certainly you may have a more comprehensive perspective than others who are not as close to the topic, but it's poor logic to attempt to invalidate others simply because you don't think they are in your &quot;group&quot; and therefore they shouldn't have the ability to have an opinion, let alone disagree with you.  In my experience, there is a lot to be learned in disagreement, and from people not as directly affected.<br>
<br>
I have to agree with Rexfelix that I found the original post to be a little bit offensive.  When I think of safe space, I think of an area where people are free to be whatever they are .. not some exclusive club where one or both sides looks at the other with a condescending &quot;how quaint&quot; attitude.  I'd like to see a culture built on this server where people are free to RP to whatever extent they wish, without people judging them, either because they aren't roleplaying, or roleplaying &quot;good&quot; enough, or because they are roleplaying.  In other words, a culture of *inclusion* and not *exclusion*.  I know that us vs them is the psychologically easiest way to build a community, but I've never been for taking the easy route <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->    <br>
<br>
Going back to the whole PG vs RP thing, I have seen very little either in game or here of the so-called &quot;PGs&quot; making criticisms of roleplay.  I have seen a lot of people criticizing people's style of RP or perceived lack thereof.  So let's make sure that as we worry about creating a &quot;safe space&quot; it's safe for everyone.  Personally, I'm a little tired of being hesitant to interact with other people on the server just because I might not be RPing the way they think I should. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/unimiane.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Nimiane</A> at: 2/5/02 10:30:24 am<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ukimayasilverbark.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Kimaya Silverbark</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.alienexplorer.com/clipart/images5/wolf.pawprint2.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Tao Te Bark</span><br>  Posts: 156<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(2/5/02 12:14:59 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=317.topic&index=36>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://home.bellsouth.net/coDataImages/bellsouthpwp/Groups/15/15568/pages/34736/Kimaya-60.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_bigsmile.gif" align=absmiddle>  Keep using my thread titles for posts that don't match them!</span><hr size=1> Am I the only one who saw this thread as asking how we can make sure that the server remains a place people can still comfortably RP a year from now, rather than making it a place people can't play if they don't RP?<br>

I did not get any of that content from the original post. It was quite exclusionary and slightly accusatory in nature. It cunningly attempted to draw parallels between a RL group of people who have suffered persecution and a game universe set of people who would like to believe they are being persecuted.<br>
<br>
It was a work of art and I admired its craftyness. It was nearly impossible to counter without looking neanderthal or mean. It was only when brave souls were willing to wade into the morass and risk being called names that the true meaning the of the message could be debated.<br>

I didn't read the original post the same way you did, Kimaya.  Maybe what you mentioned was the intent of the post, but the example that was given certainly muddied the water;  of heterosexuals invading the &quot;safe space&quot; of the homosexuals so they could &quot;gawk at the natives&quot; so to speak.  The author seemed to have distaste for anyone being present who was not meant to be there, unlike you who pointed out that the problem would only be with some people and not the entire community at large.  <br>
<br>
I saw the author trying to draw parallels to the whole RP/PG debate.  I couldn't help but think given that spirit of exclusion that the original post seemed to embrace, that we were talking about how do we keep RP &quot;safe&quot; on this server from the PGs who would ruin it, creating a culture that only accepts RP and excludes those who do are not like &quot;us&quot;.<br>
<br>

In my playing there, I did not see RP'ers persecuted--yes the vast majority did not RP--far from it, when you have druids and rangers tracking mobs in PoG for guilds, but they did not persecute either. <br>
<br>
Persecution and need for a safe place to me are terms to me which imply in their connotation a much greater degree of antagonism that anything I have perceived in the game. I am not sure of examples, especially on this server, that can constitute a need for a safe place or any discussion of persecution. Perhaps you can enlighten me on the times you have been persecuted, especially if it has been here. <p>Pakua Chuan <BR>

<br>
We i have read this post from beginning to end. and there is one thing i want to point out. It Is Just A GAME. I have only been on this server for a few weeks. And i think the community is great alot closer then the other servers. I love the fact that you can get a reputation because it is such a small server. But it is just a game. You cant compare it to anything Because it is just a game. You dont like the way someone plays dont play with them. It is thats simple to compare it to RL is impossable because you cant log out of RL<br>
<br>
just my Opinion. I am a RP'er by the way<br>
