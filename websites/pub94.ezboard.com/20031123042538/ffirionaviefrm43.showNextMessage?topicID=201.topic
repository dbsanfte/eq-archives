I have managed to save around 1700pp so far and think I should save up for an upgrade to my primary (currently use goranga club).  Most of the upgrades I am eyeing are fairly expensive and will take some time to save.  However, if I don't get a game plan established soon, I am likely to blow savings on minor upgrades, meaning that I will not have 10k accumulated in a long, long time.  <br>
<br>
I am currently torn between saving around 10k to purchase knotted knuckles (great stats/awesome ratio but the 27 delay seems a little slow for primary) or the scepter of mastery (13/21 1hb).  The Zekhas Katar doesn't do it for me (the 12/23 ratio is the same as the goranga--you are basically spending 6k on the proc).  The sheetmetal ulak is a nice item and affordable (around 2k) but it has a recommended level of 50.<br>
<br>
I am curious to hear what other monks (who have likely wielded one or more of these weapons) have to say.  <br>
<br>
Thanks,<br>

Why? As soon as you get one, you'll be looking around for something to upgrade it with. If you want a nice off-hand 1H weapon, get a stave of shielding. It has essentially the same ratio as the KK, is really cheap, and you'll probably use it nearly forever (you'll keep it to swap in and proc even after you've upgraded). The KK is actually worse than a GSC in your primary hand -- it's purely an off-hand weapon.<br>
<br>
My advice for you on upgrading weapons is to obtain a set of all three (1HB + HtH + 2HB) with low delays and use 'em to keep your all of your skills maxed each level. Based on your magelo, this is what I'd do:<br>
<br>
new 2HB (ad-bo has a nasty AE proc)<br>
eyepatch of plunder (buy lodi's map, camp the rest)<br>
epic<br>
cocw/cof<br>
fungi<br>
<br>
Your weapons are just fine; upgrade them with direct drops when the oportunity allows or if you see a really cheap bazaar deal (eg. 15k for priceless). Don't buy any bane-damage weapons -- you'll be very disappointed.  Work hard on your resists.  You'll be 52+ very soon and if you want to raid, you need 100 unbuffed MR at the same time you also have 100 unbuffed in any one of the others. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showUserPublicProfile?gid=simanmistrunner>SimanMistrunner</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 225<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(2/24/03 4:52 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm43.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=202.topic&index=2>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Monk Weaponry</span><hr size=1> Thanks for the input Bjond.  I currently wield a stave of shielding in my offhand and am awaiting the day when it will proc (over a dozen levels to go still...).  I was even considering buying another one to replace the goranga club in my primary.  I am confused when you mentioned the knotted knuckles are worse than the goranga club in offhand.  I thought the knotted knuckles would be an improvement over the goranga club in primary, at any level.  <br>
<br>
The goranga club is 12/23 and the knuckles are 18/27.  The damage bonus starts at 28 and goes up by 1 every 3 levels.  I understand that the damage bonus only adds 1 hp of actual damage per attack.  Ignoring strength adjustments, the damage per attack of a goranga club would equal (2 *12)+1+damage bonus.  The way I look at it, at level 28, the goranga club in essence becomes a 12.5/23 weapon, a 13/23 weapon at 31 and a 13.5/23 weapon at 34, etc.  At each level until 65, I don't see the goranga club, as modified by the damage bonus, exceeding the ratio of the knotted knuckles, as modified by the damage ratio.  The knotted knuckles have a much better ratio and, more importantly, the difference between the damage and delay is 9 on the knuckles (18-27) and 11 on the goranga club (12/23).<br>

What you want to calculate is expected DPS, not ratio with the bonus.  There are a number of ways to do that, but the easiest and most accurate would be to dual weild bare hands and SoS.  Alternate SoS in both primary and secondary and parse the results.  Then put GSC back in primary and parse that with bare hands.<br>
<br>
Why bare hands?  So the parser can tell the difference between each of your hands and you can issolate the weapon you're most curious about.  If you're adamant about the slow weapon in your main hand, just get another SoS.  The KK is only for people that get it free.  IMHO, it's like an FoL -- a nice item if you get it for free, but it's not worth buying because as soon as you get it, you want to sell it so you can upgrade it.<br>
<br>
Besides, I'm a firm believer in 2HB.  Not only is 2HB eventually by far the DPS leader, but it's also best for both raiding and tanking, too.  An IFS parses out about the same as dual priceless for DPS at 60, costs about 1/10th as much, takes at least 50% less riposte damage, and works much better on high AC reds (like you find on raids).  This probably won't matter a lot to you now, but once you get up to 55+, riposte starts to become a major factor in how much damage you take.<br>
<br>
IMHO, the only real point to having nice 1H weapons is to have +100 hp &amp; resist items in each hand for high level pulling.  You'll never really want to use them as weapons once you get a good 2HB.  Spending a lot of plat on 1H weapons is ultimately futile.  It's twice as expensive as buying a nice 2H (you need two of them compared to just one), but it's lower DPS and only used situationally.<br>
<br>
Also, you're only level 36.  That means you'll be 50 in a few more days.  Things change much too fast at your current level to be worrying about finding the ideal weapon or optmizing an upgrade path.  Parsing and comparing weapon details is for level 60+ when you're likely to be spending months at the same level rather than days.  Focus instead on other items that you'll use for a long long time, like your epic or an eyepatch of plunder.<br>
<br>
Oh, and remember that HtH caps lower than 1HB and 2HB for monks.  Until level 59, assuming the same ratio, 1HB will outperform HtH.  The difference doesn't start until around level 44, but you'll be there before you know it.  Under 50 levels go by insanely quick (level 53 is halfway between 1 and 60 measured by xp). <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top"> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm43.showPrevMessage?topicID=202.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm43.showNextMessage?topicID=202.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a self href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm43.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=202.topic&index=3><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/classic/addReply.jpg border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"><a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm43.threadControl?topicID=202.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/professional/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands</a><br> <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm43.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=202.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/ultimate/subscribe.gif width=20 height=20 border=0 alt="Click to receive email notification of replies"> Click to receive email notification of replies</a> <br>  <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm43.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=202.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/ultimate/unsubscribe.gif width=20 height=20 border=0 alt="Click to stop receiving email notification of replies"> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies</a> <br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub94.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="firionaviefrm1">Firiona Vie General Chat<option value="firionaviefrm2">The Market Square<option value="firionaviefrm4">The Soapbox<option value="firionaviefrm6">Signature Testing<option value="firionaviefrm7">Patch Messages<option value="firionaviefrm9">OT/OOC Forum<option value="firionaviefrm10">A Bard for a Day<option value="firionaviefrm12">Suggestion Box<option value="firionaviefrm15">The Polling Booth<option value="firionaviefrm22">The Tradeskill Shop<option value="firionaviefrm23">Hero Heart Tavern<option value="firionaviefrm38">The Spell Library<option value="firionaviefrm39">Renaissance Festival<option value="firionaviefrm40">Kudos!<option value="firionaviefrm42">Roleplayers Wanted/LFG<option value="firionaviefrm43">The Fighter's Den<option value="firionaviefrm44">Tower of Magick<option value="firionaviefrm45">Altar of Faith<option value="firionaviefrm47">Guilds and Associations<option value="firionaviefrm48">Ye Olde Coffeeshop<option value="firionaviefrm49">Apep's Dead Horse Forum<option value="firionaviefrm57">Apep's Coffee Talk<option value="firionaviefrm58">Telegrams!<option value="firionaviefrm59">The Battlefield<option value="firionaviefrm62">In the Real Life News</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#A62A2A>- </font><a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie>Firiona Vie</a><font color=#A62A2A> - </font><a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm43>The Fighter's Den</a> <font color=#A62A2A> - </font><br><br><br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 7.246j<br>Copyright ©1999-2003 ezboard, Inc.</center></body></html>
