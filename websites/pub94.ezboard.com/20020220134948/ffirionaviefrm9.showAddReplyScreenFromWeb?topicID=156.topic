If you haven't got time to read, you haven't got time to write. Reading is vital to writing, cannot stress that enough. <br>
Also don't start with writing the big novel, start smaller. Short fictions, writing excercises etc. until you have some command of your style. Ideas aren't the problem, ideas are a dime a dozen when you start to look for them. You may get ideas from shorter 4000 word pieces that can turn into something 100000 words long. Only way to be a good writer, is read a lot, write a lot. <br>
 This isnt' coming from someone who is a brilliant writer, coming from someone who wanted to be a writer before he discovered EQ <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->     But that advice is what I read from the pros when I used to persue the hobby. I may do that again one day too, email me if you want and we can exchange ideas/ short fiction. <br>
<br>
Best of luck and have fun. <br>

(And it's not a good idea to write three or four things at a time, like I do. One of them are online, and I've only got the prologue up thus far... And I've got a fan already!

For starters, I HATED The Hobbit and all that Tolkien hogwash. I read Hobbit up to page 80ish (right after he freed his stupid dwarven buddies from the spiders), and about the first ten pages of Fellowship of the Rings. Just wasn't my thing. <br>
<br>
Try and develop your own world, first. I'm a builder/pseudo-admin on the up and coming MUD, Against the Grain, and literally have just about creative control over it all, and I'm not the owner (lady friend of mine). As in, I created the Gods, I created the races, I created the continents, mapped out the cities and everything. That's what you really need to do. Just create a world, and things will begin to flow. <br>
<br>
Or maybe I took the writer's block too metaphorically. If you're literally having trouble starting it off and you've already created main characters, try opening up with a memory. I love first-person novels, as you really get to know what's going on. Introductions aren't that big, though. Heh, I recall a book that opened up with something like(excuse the language), &quot;No shit, there I was...&quot; Cursed, yes, but it was effective (The character was in the middle of a battle, confused, scared, and really wanted to get out of there). Anyway, if you post more specifics I can probably help more. <p>Vall Shadowstrife <BR>

That's how I came up with all of mine. Zxzzaaskes! Look! I've already created an iksar/cheap rip off of a lizard man (anti-classic fantasy! Whoo!) name for you. The hardest part isn't coming up with names, though, it's developing the characters. You have to have characters that avoid stereotypes (&quot;My parents were killed by orcs so I could live! I hate them and I've sworn to wipe out their entire kind no matter what, but I think I'll do this little quest for a while! Hum de dum dum...&quot;), unless it's something that is a hook (Ala, the current world Mr/Ms I-Hate-Orcs lives in is ruled by orcs and they lose their temper so much...but even then, it's pretty limited). Don't read Forgotten Realms/Dragonlance book types for inspiration, as I've basically found them rehashing the same thing over and over again. A bunch of heroes go out and save the world from an evil Goddess/Wizard/Whatever and have lots of hot and steamy sex along the way. If you create your own, non-classic fantasy world, you can come up with plots nobody's seen before. The best example I can think of is Steven Brust's Vlad Taltos line of books. Greatest things I've ever read. Read one, they're great. And just for the record, it was my idea to start up a criminal organization guild before Mr. Brust came around and stole my ingenius ideas of Interplanetary Server Economic Domination <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :b --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":b"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  (I love typing that!). <p>Vall Shadowstrife <BR>

<br>
I've been working on a novel for....oh four or five years*bleh*. And I keep getting stuck.*grin* WHat I do is ...something else for awhile. Read(which I will say the person above who said to read....is really right. Read everything you can get yer hands on, even bad fiction, that way you know what not to write*laugh*)And while I'm at it, here is my shameless plug for the best book ever written. Ever. Like life alteringly good. Like if you've not read it, get off your puter right now and go get it. Right now.*laugh* And that'd be Stranger in a Strange Land by Robert Heinlein.<br>
<br>
And I also suggest creating your own world as at the very least an excercise.  It may turn into something way more than it starts out as.  And I cannot stress enough. Cannot. Use outlines. Brainstorm ideas, becuase in all the three hundred junky ideas one will come up with there will always be a few outstanding things.  But the outline is imho the single most important key to avoiding a block.  <br>
As you can see, I'm pretty passionate about this, so I'll shut up now*grin* <p><center><b><A href="http://pub15.ezboard.com/bsarscorner"><font color="#710672" face="Black Chancery" size="-1">Sarhea </font></a>

<br>
Action films start with action for a reason... it lets the viewer know that it only gets better, bigger, louder and brighter.<br>
<br>
If you take a tiny look at some of the most memorable films/books of any type, the authors pick a style and stick to it.<br>
<br>
S.King - all his characters start of with no name, no identity, almost a mystery. Then they get introduced gradually.<br>
<br>
Tolkein started out with character development fast, you learnt about the characters, where they live, there friends/family, there habits etc... and once you get to know the character the story starts unfolding.<br>
<br>
One of my fav books ever was a tiny book for TSR called 'desent to undermountain' from mark antony. I love that book, short but very action packed.<br>
<br>
Take a look at R.A.Salvator, who i am sure some people have read, judging by the Drizzt clones i see and have seen forever! bah! he always started with the world, describing the habitats, social situations etc, then worked on character development. By the time you goto the characters you already know what type of environment they live in, so can understand some of there actions a bit better when the char development flesh out.<br>
<br>
NOT that i am a big or clever lol, i enjoy things like everyone else, but i always find i 'need' to keep things short of i waffle <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/urhaxalygen.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Rhaxalygen</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 116<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(1/11/02 12:53:47 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm9.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=156.topic&index=13>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_question_mark.gif" align=absmiddle>  Does this sound any good? (REALLY LONG)</span><hr size=1> ...but I'm still a little stuck as to whether this<br>
plot would be good enough to publish or whether<br>
it's just silly.  Any thoughts?<br>
<br>
Main Plot 1:  The Giants and the Wyrms are<br>
prepared to wage an all-out war to decide who<br>
gets ultimate control of the Higher Realms and<br>
affects all the lowly Humans and Elves down below.<br>
(I may discard this if Main Plot 2 has more zing.)<br>
<br>
Main Plot 2:  Down below on the Earthen plane:<br>
<br>
Chrysothemis, a woodland princess of the Elves, yet a<br>
Pally-type healer, defies every tradition and law known<br>
to her people and marries her lover, a Human Bard<br>
named Rhadmir.  Rhadmir is much-hated and feared<br>
by the Elves because he rallies armies to war with<br>
his songs, and he fiercely lives for the heat of battle.<br>
<br>
Chrys and Rhadmir, after much consternation and<br>
help from an Erudite-like Enchantress, Ildara, have one<br>
Half-Elven daughter that they name Rhaxalygen.<br>
She is slated to become the greatest among both<br>
the Humans and the Elves by a Dark Elf wizard's <br>
prophecy, but this fate of hers is called into question<br>
when both of her parents fall victim to a dread disease.<br>
<br>
On their deathbeds, Chrys and Rhadmir give<br>
over their kingdom to their two greatest Human<br>
friends, King and Queen, known as Antus and <br>
Shelbra.  They have one daughter, name of<br>
Abigayle, and a son, a secret Half-Elf, known<br>
as Drohm.  All of them start as good people, but...<br>
<br>
Abigayle starts following an evil sect known as the<br>
Order of the Broken Shackle, which seeks to get<br>
rid of all wrongdoing in the realm by slaughtering<br>
all the wrongdoers.  Drohm is scared of this, as<br>
is Rhaxalygen, but Shelbra, pleased with her<br>
daughter, converts to the faith, as does Antus.<br>
Yet even these parents of Abigayle's are unable<br>
to stomach her latest plan...ally with the Giants.<br>
<br>
The Giants also follow the Order, yet they're more<br>
into the &quot;kill, kill, kill&quot; side of things than the <br>
&quot;eradicate sin&quot; side of things.  In fact, they have no<br>
concept of sin.  Abigayle plans to get the Giants<br>
on her side in the name of the Broken Shackle<br>
and also to destroy the Dragons, who are neutral.<br>
<br>
Yet there's something even the Giants don't know...<br>
Abigayle later convinces the Humanoid followers<br>
of the Order to kill off the Giants once the Wyrms<br>
are dead and the neutral ones like Rhaxalygen are <br>
captured as slaves, whom she tells to convert or die.<br>
<br>
OK, I'll shut up.  *hee*  What to do with the<br>
good guys?  I don't know.  The evil side's just<br>
so much fun to write! :-)<br>

If you want it published, then just create your own world and such. No one can sue you for using elves and such, as they're classic fantasy and been around for hundreds of years. I think it's all right if you compare things to EverQuest as a description, but other than that, you're jumping up and down on the thin ice known as copyright. <p>Vall Shadowstrife <BR>

<br>
Take one scene from your story/world/characters history that inspires you. Write 500 words, a couple of paragraphs describing the scene, outlining the dialogue or some part of it in detail.<br>
<br>
Go play EQ for a few hours <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :D --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/happy.gif ALT=":D"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
Repeat.<br>
<br>
Repeat 4-5 times.<br>
<br>
Reread what you've written, put the paragraphs in a logical order. You now have a short story. It probably won't read very well to an outside observer, but its good writing practice.<br>
<br>
That's a beginning, and that's about as far as I have got <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
In the end you can string together and bulk out those paragraphs, and ones in between and in theory, eventually arrive at a novel. And if any of the bits don't fit or are badly written, you've only wasted half an hour on them.<br>
<br>
But the important thing is NOT to try and write an epic straight off. Write a place, or a conversation, or a battle. Enough of those makes an adventure.<br>
<br>
Like people say, starting at the start sucks. Start in the interesting bits, the rest is just fluff.<br>
<br>
I am also attempting to write a book/create a world or whatever. My bed is usually strewn with pictures and maps of my fantasy world, which although having the base outline drawn up, and lots of pretty dragon pictures drawn, has yet to get off the starting blocks. I'm trying the read-a-lot tactic, in the hope that I will at least learn what NOT to do.<br>

City names, god names, specifics of that nature would.<br>

Erudites as a race would infringe on copywrites.  But the word erudite is nothing but a synonym for intelligent anyway, so you could probably come up with something better.<br>
<br>
As far as writing, never try to write a book from start to finish until you have already completed the first draft.  Pick a character, write something about them.  Put them in a fight or some other dramatic scene to get your creative juices flowing.<br>
<br>
Also, I find it very difficult to write on the computer... i use pen and paper at a table or sitting on the floor.  Many writers write to specific types of music, give that a try.<br>
<br>
If you write an outline of how you want you story to develop, dont be afraid to junk it if you start writing something that differs from the outline.<br>

Write something every day.<br>

<br>
Yes, these should be fantasy races that should be OK and are not &quot;property&quot; of some company currently. <br>
<br>
Elves, dwarves, dragons, giants, ogres, trolls -- many of these have been in mythical existence since ancient times, or Medieval Europe, or Scandinavian mythology. No person today has a sole copyright on them.<br>
<br>
Orcs -- I could be wrong, but I think JRR Tolkien invented Orcs. I have never heard of &quot;orcs&quot; before in ANY world literature before the writings of Tolkien in the early 20th Century.  However, I doubt that Tolkien legally retained a sole copyright on Orcs.... just look at the 5 bazillion fantasy games that use them today. Conclusion? The use of the mythical Orcs probably belongs to the public domain by now. <br>
<br>
Also, there is a clause in international copyright rules. If the original author dies, after some time has passed.... there are certain elements that can automatically go into the public domain.  <br>
<br>
Barbarians -- definitely public domain. Ancient Greeks first coined the term &quot;barbarian&quot; to refer to uncivilized savages who spoke a garbled language that sounded like &quot;ber ber ber ber&quot; <br>
<br>
The best way to distinguish yourself is to give names and culture to each of your races. For example, dont just call them elves. Call them something like &quot;The elven people called the Seldarain who dwell in the forest of blah blah blah....&quot;  And think of making them different from the other elves. Give them a couple of features or traits that totally makes them stand out from the typical elves in D&amp;D or Everquest. Make your elves unique! More people will want to read your stories if your creatures are unique and really stand out. <br>
<br>
Likewise, don't just call them Giants.  Write about them like &quot;And there lived beyond the Great Glacier a large race of giant men, who refer to themselves as the Jarls of Kranigsheim&quot; <br>
<br>
just my 2 plats <br>
