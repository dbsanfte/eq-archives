They're just trying to make it an official on the books kind of practice (vs having the judicial system yelling at them as they are currently).<br><br>Abdullah al-Muhajir (AKA Jose Padilla, an american citizen) was arrested in early May.  He's still being held, and no charges have been filed against him.  Ashcroft announced that Padilla was one of the masterminds behind a plot to detonate &quot;dirty bombs&quot; in several US cities spreading radioactive material everywhere and making them inhabitable.  Investigations into it have pretty much pointed at the guy being a low level gang member who was talking about the concept of something like this, but hadn't actually made any plans of doing it (at least not yet).<br><br>He's been denied access to the legal system because Ashcroft has labelled him &quot;an enemy combatant&quot;.  So he's just sitting there in a cell, with no charges filed against him, and no real evidence of yet to do so, so they can search for evidence to charge him with some crime or another.<br><br>I'm not saying this is some martyr, the guy's pretty clearly a total scumbucket who probably <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> should</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> be in prison.  But they need to be doing it legally, especially since we're talking citizens here.  With the precedent that this sets, they can (and will) be able to just haul off anyone they suspect is a terrorist, and then search for evidence while they rot in prison.<br><br>- Syll<br><br>PS: This is the right they're violating with this crap...<br><br><!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr>  Definition: Habeus Corpus is a Latin term which means &quot;you should have the body,&quot; and is a legal principle which requires that the government must present an accused and arrested person before an impartial judge in order to prove that there exists just cause to hold that person against his or her will. <br><br>Without the Writ of Habeus Corpus (traditionally called the &quot;Great Writ&quot<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  , a government could hold a person in jail for any length of time without having to prove that there is any good reason for doing so. Thus, if you are being held by the government, you can request a writ of habeus corpus and, if a court issues it, then the government must bring you to that court and demonstrate that they have arrested you for a compelling reason. If they cannot, then they must set you free. <br><br>The principle of habeus corpus also refers to the power of federal courts to review the legal decisions made by lower state courts. Thus, if you think that you have been unjustly convicted in a state court, then you can appeal to a federal court. If your appeal is approved, the federal court can issue a writ, requiring that government officials bring you before it so that your case can be reviewed. This oversight authority has been restricted in recent years, in particular with regards to death penalty convictions. The ability to request a hearing before a federal court means that it takes longer for a death sentence to be carried out, and about 40% of capital convictions are overturned on federal review. Supporters of the death penalty find this unacceptable and have successfully lobbied for less federal oversight. <br><br>It should be noted that a person's right to a writ of habeus corpus was the only one considered important enough to be included in the original text of the Constitution.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br><br>The above from atheism.com (but only because it's the first thing that came up in the search engine)<br> <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/usyllestraefv.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Syllestrae FV</A> at: 8/16/02 12:03:51 am<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/utzarothfv.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Tzaroth FV</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 147<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(8/16/02 12:01:10 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1218.topic&index=4>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Not to talk politics, but...</span><hr size=1> As far as terrorism goes, better safe than sorry.<br><br>But this obviously isn't the answer, and I don't know what is. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/usyllestraefv.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Syllestrae FV</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>New Mod!</span><br>  Posts: 944<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(8/16/02 12:03:08 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1218.topic&index=5>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Not to talk politics, but...</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> As far as terrorism goes, better safe than sorry.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br><br>In total agreement with that.

While not a formal 'declaration of war', the resolution passed satisfies the provisions of the War Powers Act which defaults to the President the authority to engage in military action.
