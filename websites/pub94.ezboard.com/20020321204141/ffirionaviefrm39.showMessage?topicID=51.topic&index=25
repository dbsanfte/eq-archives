So let me enlighten you young one.<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr>   &quot;of course, everyone likes to have fun killing big mobs and getting nice stuff. everyone would also love to claim stuff before it drops, irregardless of who is there to help.&quot;<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
 When you initially replied in this thread, (which you really had no business in the first place as you cannot participate) I was quite shocked to see that such an Uber member of Fire and Fury took their busy time to even acknowledge us. I quickly learned that you had not posted to maybe offer constructive advice, nor had you even posted to help the event in any way. Your meer intention was to flame. This really did bother me as you are the first poster from FaF I have noticed other than Biji, and he has always seemed nice here and in game. Yes we will have fun. Yes will get get some good loot. No it really doesn't apply to you, therefore it is none of your business who the loot goes to, or how it is divided.<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr>   &quot;gain benefit from my experience, kid. believe it or not I just made your guild's future a little brighter.&quot;<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--> <br>
 This statement here REALLY makes me laugh. How can a incompetent, uneducated, ( Just look at you sentence structure and horrible run on's, Hell you dont even know what a shift button is for ) board jockey who has nothing better to do than flame everyone else hope to teach anyone anything? Let me tell you a secret... I have been playing 2 years, was a member of the first guild to legitamely awaken the sleeper, and sported 3 of the BotB players in the world last year. I came to this server to get away from all that Uberdom and simply play and enjoy the game. 8 of our guilds core have characters on other servers 58+. It would really surprise me if you have ever even killed Naggy or Vox, but then again, you be an almighty speaker for the Uber FaF, I'm sure you've done it all 10 times over.<br>
<br>
 As to the Kid statement.... well, I think my posting style and yours shows the true kid here.<br>
<br>
 Wherever the hell you came up with this you helped our guild crap beats the crap outta me. You have done nothing but talk down on it, talk trash on the people that are trying to put it together, and throw flames to anyone who will listen to immature ass. Do us all a favor and follow my advice the last time I responded to you... STFU<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr>   &quot;or maybe you don't care about that. shrug.&quot;<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--> <br>
 Here's another really good example of your awesome articulation.. I dunno.. maybe it's me.. but I have no clue what the hell your talking about. The only thing I can assume is your handy dandy Cracker Jack super decoder messed up.<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr>   &quot;and hey, I'm not in the 'uber crowd' as your profound ignorant jealousy put it, because I want to be necessarily. I am because of my experience in the game and hours logged on. I love eq, I love the nuances of it, and I can see a mile away whats coming. none of this is new just because it's new to you.&quot;<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--> <br>
 If I were truly jealous, I wouldn't be here playing, I would be on my old server doing the Nonstop raid day after day, after day, after day. As I said, I left that to take it easy and enjoy the game and friends I have.<br>
<br>
 As to the reason you are in FaF, thats simple. It has nothing to do with your ability to play. It's because like you, 90 percent of FaF is concerned with 1 thing and have been since day 1. EXP. Anyone can do it, fact is I came to this server to get away from that type of play. Fact: Your a high level cleric. Fact: FaF really could care less who ya are, so long as you are there, and you make them stronger. Am I saying there is anything wrong with this? Nope.. been there, done that, to each his own.<br>
<br>
  LOL Oh man.. you need to keep playing and stay away from these boards. I would venture to say you will not last in FaF very long at your rate now. You are becoming more and more arrogant in your ways, and let me tell you a little something about bein ubbah... You start showing your ass too much, and they will can it. Been there.. canned some myself. <br>
<br>
 Also another word of advice, think before you speak. errrr Post that is. As you never know what you will get tangled up in. ie. Me You don't want any more I'm sure. But if you do, I emplore you to take it soapbox and out of this thread. I have asked you nicely, but seeing your immature posts and style, I knew you would have to try and get the last word here so you could enlighten all of us peons. Gimme a break.<br>

Kareem's &quot;ficticous&quot; accompliments, aren't one bit ficticious.  Two officers in BoTS(Blood of the Spiders) played an online game with us from 95 to 2000.. We were a close knit unit, such as we are now.  If you've been a somewhat avid online gamer for the past 7 years, you'd have heard of the game we play, and possibly even the unit.  We all played a game called MultiPlayer BattleTech: Solaris.. Units name was DRAAGUN(Wasn't allowed to use that as a guild name here, because, GMs said it wasn't a &quot;roleplay&quot; name).  I could honestly care less about BS politics, and everything else.. But when you come out in the open, and denounce someone and call them a liar in an open server forum, that's just complete BS.  You weren't there, you don't know the facts, so please, refrain from sounding all mighty in the matter by trying to say his accomplishments are just figments of his imagination.  And to quote you, &quot;k thx la~&quot;.<br>

PS-If you feel like attempting to call peoples wrongs, I'll go ahead and point one out for you.  As soon as you get ANY amount of aggro(Throwing one buff, heal, hitting a dragon once with melee or spell if your 52+, you get ported out of his lair).  That's the way it's always been, it was done like that on the test server BEFORE Kunark came live.  The only thing in terms of helping while you were a 53+ cleric, would have been helping to buff, or helping to rez afterwards. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=kareem>Kareem</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 43<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(2/22/02 7:36:23 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm39.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=51.topic&index=33>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Open Nagafen Raid</span><hr size=1>  I ask the moderators to please ban Heagan from this thread as he is merely trying to make this a flame war, bring down not only me and my guild, but kill the event for everyone.

 You cannot even cast a spell in Naggy's lair if you are 53+, never have been able to, never will. Same with Vox. Heagan please. Go away. Your a babbling idiot who continually tries to get me to get in a who is bigger contest, but it's clear you don't even belong in the competition.<br>
<br>
 To those who wish to join us, if you are level 53 or higher, you will have to kill yourself before the raid till you are 52. We will rez you acordinglly after Naggy falls <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

Oh yea Heagan... Its k thx la~, I would call you a newb.. but your doing a good job proving it yourself.<br>
<br>
and fyi. Naggy and Vox are Uber.. I'd venture to say that 75% of all raids on them are a failure as many have the slightest clue what to do. Kinda like you and your 53+ tales, thats all they are.. Tales of a babbling idiot.<br>

Not that I am wondering why just an interesting observation.  The last time I saw anyone like this on the boards (and they weren't 1/2 as bad as Heagan) it was Fuvi.  Fuvi gets banned (even though I disagreed with him I didn't think he deserved getting banned) and Heagan gets praised.  <br>

<br>
and as to my '60 wizard with lots of aa' reference, yes that wiz would be banished as soon as he landed one nuke, but how much damage would that one nuke potentially do? 2 or 3 k is very realistic, but would you dare say 10k? twice that? more? you bet. <br>
<br>
the kthxla was sarcasm directed at the 'uber heagan' comments, as it has been in past threads with similar dumb context.<br>
<br>
so, you point at certain references, like you have selective hearing. my original beef was with claiming dragon loot while hosting an 'open raid'. It's an 'open raid' because your guild can't do it on their own. oog saw some wisdom in those words and revised his original post. plus you still haven't answered my question about the hundreds of guilds who have hosted open dragon raids over the last 2 and a half years, who don't claim dragon loot, or why they don't.<br>
<br>
look, if you were truely as leet as you claim to be, with all this 'well ' I ' was in the guild that first legitimately woke sleeper', honestly you wouldn't screw with nagafen or vox. you wouldn't say that high level guilds only require 'leveling' as you would know it requires teamwork, dedication, practice, patience for trial and error... all of these things were mysteriously overlooked. or maybe you have no darn clue what you're talking about. it's like your some jealous part timer trying to down the full time players. THAT's why I called you a liar. swallow it.<br>
<br>
maybe you played on test server for a while, where things are rigged by the gm's for trial and error. hell, when SZ was in test every level 2 and his cousin were bumped to 25 in a matter of hours. &lt;just as an illustrated example, similar goings-on happened on test over the years&gt; or maybe you read safehouse, or maybe you have friends who accomplish alot, well that hardly qualifies you to proclaim your leetness. <br>
<br>
yeh, I'll have to go with my original understanding, more than before even, that you are some greedy, bull sh**ing quasi newbs who whine like bitches when your hand is called.<br>
<br>
well, I do hope you kill a dragon, really. probably more for your 'guests' ' sake, than your own, but still.<br>

Go, have fun, learn how to kill a dragon or teach folks how to kill depending on your background, and then relax over it.  Default something or nothing or everything.  It won't matter in the long run.<br>
<br>
If you want dragon haste bad, level up to 55, get 2 groups of 55+ together and go kill the fish in CS.  He spawns a lot and drops CoCW so often, it's trivial to outfit all your guilds melee classes with dragon haste.  This is not directed at CA, but at those saying the only reason to go is to get a CoF.<br>

We will be providing any resist jewelry necessary.   We will be providing the peridots necessary.  We will be porting all of the folks there that can't get ports themselves or are too lazy.  We will be taking our time, our money, to make sure this raid is successful, and when it comes time for vox, we'll be doing the same.  I also said there would be more &quot;open&quot; raids in the future.  But, ya know what, I didn't feel like having to deal with a huge flame war over one piece of loot, so I retracted that.  And the part about us claiming to have done stuff like awaken sleeper, etc.. I never did it.. I hated old economy servers(Rathe was one of the initial 10 or 12 that came up when EQ went live).. But I did log on to talk to my friends there, hence me knowing that Kareem was a part of that event.  And honestly Heagen, if you claim to not to be as &quot;uber&quot; as you said you were, why would you have decided to openly flame me, when I gave an email addy for &quot;questions/comments/flames&quot; in my intital post regarding loot rules?  Oh, because your all mighty self can say whatever you please, and not have any consequences for your actions maybe?
