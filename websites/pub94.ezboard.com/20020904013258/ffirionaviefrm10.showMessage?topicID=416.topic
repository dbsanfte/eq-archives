And before anyone tries to guess who it is... no, chances are REAL good you don't really know him, so don't sweat it.)</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
Nearly falling over with laughter, Kimaya sped around the corner to hide from the merchant who had just angrily found that all of his displays had been carefully arranged so that the suits of fine armor appeared to be doing unnatural things to one another.  She simply loved Shadowhaven, there was a whole city full of people who had never before enjoyed a good pixie prank!<br>
<br>
One of the suits of armor glinted again in her mind, and she might have wanted to take it if she didn't think it would be wrong.  She was thinking of how good it would have looked on her secret lover, the one she met by chance once before, then again by design and secrecy a couple times after.  She still found herself mildly saddened by the almost-fight they had a while before, moreso now that she had an idea of how it had happened.  Was he drawn into a web of suspicion, or simply of jealousy?<br>
<br>
Sighing, she tossed the whole question aside.  All she knew was that she had told him the truth, that she’d never do anything that would hurt him, and she tried again to suppress a fresh wave of hurt that he'd ever have such a fear.  She had even shared a secret part of herself to hopefully reassure him, but she knew his path wasn’t her decision to make…  <br>
<br>
Soon her ponderings were interrupted, for she heard a little pixie whisper that her secret sweetheart was nearby.  Her mind slipped him a message that she wanted to see him again, then laughed back at his surprise.  She tried to explain that she wasn't angry anymore, she only wanted to see him again, and she STILL wanted to despite the dangers they both may have faced.  Finally, when she agreed to his request that she wear her blood-red leathers, he said he could no longer resist her invitation.<br>
<br>
After careful arrangements and hurried sneaking around corners, she led him into a seldom-visited bar.  She purchased a rare champagne to celebrate another of their equally rare visits, but he insisted he found her beauty more intoxicating.  She only laughed, then suggested with a wink that perhaps he should see her in her blue wicker just to see if he liked that better.  He reluctantly agreed, almost certain he'd like nothing more than how she then looked.  <br>
<br>
Though she was half-suspicious he agreed solely so he could catch glimpses of her changing, his eyes lit up as she came out in the tight dark-violet leathers, her curves faintly visible through thin gauze.  She giggled as she saw his eyes wander where his hands wanted to, as almost everyone ended up voting for the violet...<br>
<br>
After a quick slap on his hand and a reminder that the bank was not a place to test the texture, she led him back to the bar in hopes he'd take more champagne.  Yet he said all he wished for was a taste of was her lips, and of her soft creamy neck that he whispered he had longed for so long... when he suddenly remembered they were still in a public place, however semi-private.  Instead he slipped behind her to hold her in his lap while they talked of... what had they spoken of?  It hardly mattered, as before long his hands spoke of a desire for a more private place, and her voice suggested they find one.<br>
<br>
There was in inn nearby, with one empty room.  It was a small room with an even smaller bed.  There were few words spoken before he lifted her up onto the bed, his eyes meeting hers with a quiet intensity.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> He asks softly, 'Kimaya, may I please make love to you this night?'<br>
Kimaya laughs, 'Why only tonight?  What's wrong with tomorrow and the next night as well?'  Softening her mirth into a faint smile, she replies again, 'Yes, please, I've been waiting for you to ask.'</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
With hardly a hint of shyness, he asked her for help with his armor, then helped her shed hers.  The shyness surfaced soon enough, however, as he admitted, or half-asked another question.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> His words were softly spoken, 'This is my first time.  Is that okay?'<br>
She doesn't reply with laughter, but gives him a sweet smile and a sparkle in her eyes. 'Of course it's okay, sweetheart.'<br>
He smiles back, his eyes still looking into hers.  'I'm so glad it's with you.'<br>
She pulls him closer, whispering, 'I can't find the words tell you how much it means that it's with me, too.'</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
With a faint rustle of sheets, he snuffed out the candles and slipped gently into the welcoming darkness.<br>

She knew he was sometimes shy, and nearly always busy with one thing or another, but Kimaya really didn't care -- lotsa folks remembered her when they needed help, and she never seemed to mind.  She went to the Commons to pick him up, as it was still rare for them to have a chance to see one another.  <br>
<br>
He wanted to get to Luclin, but since she didn't yet know how to bring him directly there she offered to bring him to Toxxulia Forest instead.  And as soon as he said he'd never been to one of her most favoritest woods, she started casting the spell to change that sad oversight.  He seemed to find the woods interesting, but he swore the only sight he wished  to see was her.  She giggled, blushed and smooched him again before tugging at him to follow her.  She didn’t want to be late.<br>
<br>
She wished she had time to show him all the places she loved around there, but she knew it wasn't the right time anyways.  Some sharings were for some people at some times, while other things were right for others.  So instead she camouflaged him and slipped herself back out of view, trying not to let themselves be seen together lest they get teased, or worse.  Even so, she couldn't keep herself from a sneaking pinch or a stolen kiss now and then while they waited for the spires.<br>
<br>
When they reached Luclin, they knew they couldn't part right away.  They continued sneaking through Shadowhaven, moving carefully with her scouting ahead to ensure none of his companions would spot them together.  If there was one thing Kimayas were good at, it was being sneaky and remaining unseen, especially when it would help keep a loved one out of mischief.<br>
<br>
Finally, they had made it to her room, not even pausing for drinks or any other pretense of how they wished to share their precious time together.  Casual conversation, shyness, clothing... all were carelessly tossed aside in the comfortable joy they had always shared with one another.  <br>
<br>
He had backed her into a corner soon enough, yet rather than feeling trapped she felt safe and close, though still somehow coy and bashful as she often was with him.  Was it his boyish enthusiasm, his shy politeness... could she ever be sure?  Ignorant of the reasons he had such an effect on her, she still giggled freely and shivered softly as his gentle hands and soft lips caressed and tickled her skin.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> He asks, 'My lady, may I please make love to you?  A gentleman always asks.'<br>
Kimaya giggles, smiling with sweet, bright eyes as she replies, 'And a Kimaya who loves you always says yes.'</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
He carried her quietly to the bed, the time they shared even sweeter than the time before, and their eyes locked into one another's through each moment they were not closed in happiness.  After a shared eternity of blissful moments, he pulled her close to sit in his lap and gently patted her belly.  <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> He whispers into her ear, 'We'll have to be careful.  You know, babies can grow in there.'<br>
Kimaya laughs, putting her hand over his and holding it tightly against her.  'Oh, silly, I'm not gonna have a BABY!  There's fae secrets, and they make sure there's no babies until it's time.'</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
She nodded emphatically, secure in her belief it wouldn't be time for quite a while, maybe even never.  He still held her close, and mused aloud about what his companions would say if they knew she was carrying his child.  She laughed and joked that it would be the same thing they'd say if it were a Tuesday, though she was half-aware he didn’t find the whole topic quite so funny.<br>
<br>
Soon it was time for them to part again -- he had another hunt to join and she had another errand to run or crisis to help with.  They shared one lingering kiss and went their separate ways, once more shifting from secret lovers to cherished memories. <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top"> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm10.showPrevMessage?topicID=416.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm10.showNextMessage?topicID=416.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a self href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm10.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=416.topic&index=1><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/classic/addReply.jpg border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"><a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm10.threadControl?topicID=416.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/professional/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands (Moderator only)</a><br> <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm10.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=416.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm10.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=416.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub94.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="firionaviefrm1">Firiona Vie General Chat<option value="firionaviefrm9">OT/OOC Forum<option value="firionaviefrm4">The Soapbox<option value="firionaviefrm58">Telegrams!<option value="firionaviefrm47">Guilds and Associations<option value="firionaviefrm10">A Bard for a Day<option value="firionaviefrm23">Hero Heart Tavern<option value="firionaviefrm15">The Polling Booth<option value="firionaviefrm40">Kudos!<option value="firionaviefrm48">Ye Olde Coffeeshop<option value="firionaviefrm57">Apep's Coffee Talk<option value="firionaviefrm2">The Market Square<option value="firionaviefrm22">The Tradeskill Shop<option value="firionaviefrm38">The Spell Library<option value="firionaviefrm59">The Battlefield<option value="firionaviefrm39">Renaissance Festival<option value="firionaviefrm42">Roleplayers Wanted/LFG<option value="firionaviefrm43">The Fighter's Den<option value="firionaviefrm44">Tower of Magick<option value="firionaviefrm45">Altar of Faith<option value="firionaviefrm12">Suggestion Box<option value="firionaviefrm6">Signature Testing<option value="firionaviefrm7">Patch Messages<option value="firionaviefrm49">Apep's Dead Horse Forum</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#A62A2A>- </font><a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie>Firiona Vie</a><font color=#A62A2A> - </font><a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm10>A Bard for a Day</a> <font color=#A62A2A> - </font><br><br><br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 6.9.5.4<br>Copyright ©1999-2002 ezboard, Inc.</center></body></html>
