<br>
Time fer me to get up on me stool so everyone can see me!  har har har!!!!<br>
<br>
There are so many things to say here I'm not sure where to start!   Hmm let's see...<br>
<br>
I'll start off by saying I have made thousands and thousands of plat (guessing over 30kpp) with my top tradeskill being tailoring at 15 (aye, fifteen).  How in Brell's name is that possible ya might ask?!?   Well I'll tell yas!<br>
<br>
While adventurin' I'd hear about items that were in demand or were fetching a pretty penny and I'd wonder how I'd get ahold of one (or five!) to sell in order to make coin fer me armors and weapons.  Well it seemed that fer some of these things they were produced either by a skilled tradesperson or assembled fer some quest.  It seemed natural to me that if I were to assemble all the various components for making an item that was in demand, there would be some profit in it fer me.<br>
<br>
So that's how it started, and as my business grew, I realized that I was actually bringing businss to people when I needed their skill and expertise.   The example I'll use here is one already mentioned by Xylox, and that's the acrylia plate (and chainmail) armor market.<br>
<br>
While I was lookin' through the scrolls in the library (ooc: eqtraders.com) about smithin' and good armors I'd be wanting (they HAD to be stout resistant too as I'd spill on me armors a lot), I saw acrylia armor listed and saw what attributes they had.  So I studied what it would take to get some acrylia armor made.<br>
<br>
The recipe for acrylia plate armor is as follows:<br>
<br>
Plate armor mold + leather padding (tailoring trivial around 35) + acryila combine temper (brewing trivial 122 methinks) + folded sheets of acrylia ore (smithing trivial 120 or so) + acrylia chaing jointing (smithing trivial 80 or so) + combine smithy hammer (bought in katta).<br>
<br>
When I looked at the recipe fer it I saw there was a lot of work to be done, and then I looked at my skills and saw only me alcohol tolerance was skilled up at all (200!) I knew I needed help in making this armor!<br>
<br>
This is where it gets interesting.<br>
<br>
I was able to farm acrylia ore by the time I had looked into this (high 30s in season) and so had raw unworked acrylia ore to do.  I also was able to obtain the ingredients for making the acrylia combine tempers (which also included getting some vials of mana from an enchanter).  So what I needed was skilled tradespeople to help me make the armor.<br>
<br>
It went a little like this:   I auctioned on the market fer leather paddings and was able to buy 'em fer I believe 3 or 4pp a padding (I have since increased what I pay fer 'em, but this was back when I dind't have a lot of plat), then I auctioned fer a brewer of 130 skill or higher, and sure enough I got responses.   I gave them my temper ingredients then after they made my tempers I paid them for their time and skill.  Methinks in the case of the temper makin' I paid anywhere from 50pp to 200pp per session if it was a big batch of tempers.  With tempers and leather paddings in hand, I then searched for a grandmaster smith to work with the ore.  I got a response from the market which gave me a list of 4 or 5 smiths with skills in their 240s.   I then asked the smith if they'd be willing to make me some acrylia armor for a fee.  It's my opinion that those I had approached had never (or rarely) had a stranger approach them willing to pay fer their time and expertise.  Every smith I approached was willing to take some plat fer their time.   When I first started I paid 'em 150pp for doing all that (which was about 10 minutes work) and both parties were happy with the results.  I now pay anywhere from 200pp to 300pp per piece made to GM smith because not only can I afford it, but it's just a way to thank them for their time.<br>
<br>
Last night I had a smith make 7 pieces of acrylia plate armor, which took him 10 minutes (by now I have everything ready, including the ore already processed and the jointings already made).   That smith made 1750pp in 10 minutes.   I'll be making in the neighborhood of 10kpp for the armors.  I honestly consider that they've been paid well for their time (dunno many people who would complain about making 'only' 1750pp in 10 minutes), and I will be compensated for my time in farming and processing (or having processed) materials.<br>
<br>
Most of that skill will be going right back into working my tradeskills, as getting all this armor done made me realize I wanted to be a GM smith.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
The points made herein are:<br>
<br>
1 - You don't need to have a tradeskill to make coin<br>
2 - If you are working a tradeskill and need more platinum to continue working it, it is very likely that you will be earning platinum *outside* the field of skill you're working in.  <br>
3 - Spend some time listening to the market channel and pay attention to what items you see being asked for frequently.  Chances are if you are able to bring some of that to the market, you are going to be paid well for your time (as there are many lazy and/or time constrained people with way more plat than time to spend collecting stuff)<br>
4 - I practice what I preach.  (bein' cleric almost makes that mandatory...  Har har!!!)<br>
<br>
The acrylia plate armor is just an example, there are many other platinum making opportunities.<br>
<br>
Another thing I believe that bears mentioning (though it's not in the same tangent as I've been talkin' about) is that in my experience even if there are a lot of highly skilled traders in one particular area, they will usually semi-retire from the market in general, thus opening up the market to new people coming through.<br>
<br>
A couple examples of this follow:<br>
<br>
Grandmaster smithing seems to be a field where the smiths are largely inactive once they attain their &gt; 240 skill rating.  The one exception is Xylox.  Out of the 5 GM smiths I've worked with, he's the only one that actively plies his trade still.  The others have either gotten bored with smithing and moved on to other things or can't be bothered to hawk their wares in the market (or don't like to).  That leaves someone like me an opportunity to carve out a living filling the gaps left by semi-retired smiths by selling high end smithing items in the market (without having the skill to necessarily do it myself mind you).   Other opportunities exist, this is just one I can attest to myself.<br>
<br>
The other example that I see here is this whole tinkering debate which is fueling this thread and abit of animosity amongst my gnomish friends.  In many cases, people will skill up in a trade (and i'll use tinkering here as an example tradeskill) to become a grandmaster (200 or 250 depending).  While they're skilling up (Bend), it may happen they'll sell for cheap (as long as it's over merchant pricing).   Once they've reached that peak, they won't usually remain active in the market and things will return to an equilibrium again.<br>
<br>
While its noble to want to be able to make it to 200 or 250 in any tradeskill financing one's way primarily through the (by)products of that tradeskill, it isn't (even with COTS, unless COTS becomes massive) feasible.   With the combination of rich people skilling up at any cost and/or non-COTS people doing their own thing, other sources of platinum should be looked at and followed.<br>
<br>
Or, in a nutshell:  Bear the burden Bend may put on the market while he skills up.   As he moves upwards in skill he'll stop making geerlocks when they don't present him with learning anymore.<br>
<br>
It's all hindsight in this case now, but in a similar situation, I'd have informed him (or anyone else in that position) that the market would saturate quickly and if he could kindly ration the number he sells in the market that'd be great for everyone.  As it stands now, the formation of COTS in reaction to his actions has seemingly ruined a large chunk of the tinkering market because he's now actively *trying* to make things difficult.   It now seems to come down to a matter of will.  As long as he has the will to do free combines of flood the market with super cheap geerlocks (even if he's passed the skill up mark), the tinkering market's hurt bad for traders.<br>
<br>
Seems the next logical step to me would be for Darai and Bend to have a chat in-game and work these issues out.<br>
<br>
and on that point I'll have another drink and be on me way!  Har har har!!! <br>
