It seems like it's a really special community, and I'm looking forward to getting involved once my Vah Shir Shaman gets off the ground.<br><br>Anyway, I've read a whole bunch of threads about the TLC, both pro and con, and I thought that, despite being a newbie, I'd share my thoughts. Please keep in mind that all of this is simply my opinion, and apologies in advance if some or all of this has already been stated elsewhere.<br><br>To start, I'd like to take a look at why the TLC has been turned on in the first place. Basically, there is no RP reason for having TLC. This isn't to say that good roleplayers can't come up with reasons for it being in place -- it just means that the TLC does not in and of itself facilitate more and/or better roleplaying.<br><br>The main purpose of TLC being implemented server-wide is to cut back on farming. Without getting too much into the specifics, I'll simply say that heavy farming can cause a number of issues and situations to crop up that can degrade the server and that are a hindrance to roleplaying. Having TLC turned on severely limits the ability to farm items.<br><br>However, I would like to question how much of a problem farming would be if the TLC were to be turned off. As others have already pointed out in other threads, FV already has a number of other devices in place to hinder farming and powergaming in general -- the language barrier, the alignment system, the elimination of /ooc and limitations on /shout and /auctions, and especially the one character rule. This last one I believe is particularly important, since removing mules and alts severely limits the amount of loot that a farmer can amass and limits the number of buyers for a potential farmer.<br><br>Furthermore, and this has also all been said already, the TLC has created almost as many problems as it solves. Put quite simply, almost all of the existing quests and zones in the game were not designed with the TLC in mind. For most quests, this is not a problem, but it is not surprising to me at all that there are many quests which are now extremely difficult to complete because of the TLC. <br><br>Some (including Sony) have said that it is perfectly reasonable to need to buy quest items off of other players, creating more interaction and roleplaying opportunities. But the community already seems RP-friendly enough, and the low server population and one character limit has made it harder to find some of these quest items than it should be.<br><br>All of this being said, I'm not quite ready to say that the server would be a better place without TLC. Removing the code would almost certainly result in more farming than at present, especially when you consider the fact that the removal of NO DROP has greatly increased the number of potential items to be farmed.<br><br>As an alternative to a server-wide removal of the TLC, I'd like to offer this solution. I think it solves the problem of broken quests while leaving most of the server free of farmers:<br><br>Break the zones down into three groups. Don't break them up by geographical location or level range -- do it in a fairly random fashion.<br><br>Turn off TLC in one of the three groups, and leave it on in the other two. Every week, rotate which group of zones has TLC turned off.<br><br>The expected results would be as follows: every week, some people would go ahead and farm some items in some of the zones. They would get their items, and make some profit by reselling them to the general populace, which as has already been seen is a much softer market than on regular servers. Meanwhile, two-thirds of the zones would be generally free of any farmers, just as they are now.<br><br>Anyone trying to complete a quest or get an item that is affected by TLC has two options: try to buy what they need from another player like they do now, or wait up to two weeks until the TLC gets turned off in the right zone.<br><br>Best of all, this solution is fairly easy to implement. It does not require someone at Sony to go through each quest to see whether or not it is broken by TLC. Assuming that Sony can turn the TLC on and off with a switch, it should be relatively easy for someone to write a script that does just what I described, and set it up as a cron job that runs automatically each week.<br><br>So what does everyone think? Please post your feedback below -- if there's enough support for this, I'd love to write up a petition and lobby Sony to put this change in.<br><br>Thank you for reading this far.<br><br>Ajaja<br>Humble Dar Khura Recruit of Shar Vahl <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/umadrain.showPublicProfile?language=EN>madrain</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Kerran Lord</span><br>  Posts: 142<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(1/8/02 9:16:16 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1060.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: TLC analysis and my solution</span><hr size=1> I like this idea, to some extent.

I can't think of a single normally farmed item that is effected by TLC -- nothing in lower guk, nothing in old sebelis, nothing in icewell, etc. etc..<br><br>TLC's only effect that I can see is to seriously inhibit questing -- especially quest discovery.  It creates a major obstacle to all quests that the quest designers don't take into account when designing quests; ie. it makes quests a lot harder, more prone to bugs, and bugs less likely to be fixed.  Due to the substantial increase in quest diffictulty, it behooves all FV questors to let other servers solve the quests and post full spoilers before we attempt them here.  Effort versus reward ratio on FV is a lot higher than on other servers.<br><br>TLC needs to be removed.  OTH, TLC is not why I'd consider leaving FV.  If I moved to a different server, it would be due to the lack of multiple characters.  There's a serious bank-slot shortage here and with TLC you really *need* an army of mules to bank all the quest items you find as you level up -- you can't ever go back and get them later.  I've been out of bank slots since about level 12, most of it taken by TLC'd quest items I plan to use later.<br><br>So, on FV, I don't like TLC and I don't like the character limit.  I do like the language changes.  I don't like the grouping restrictions, but I like the buffing restrictions (both alignment and level).  All of these fall into the background noise, though.<br><br>The reasons I started up again on FV instead of one of the other servers was 1: it's a new server, 2: it's an &quot;RP&quot; server, 3: it's small, and 4: the people on this board sounded fun.  The new ruleset, to me, is mostly just an ad-hoc unsupported joke by Verant that I have to get around. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/umalathos.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Malathos</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 2<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(1/10/02 10:34:41 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1060.topic&index=7>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Hmm ,,</span><hr size=1> I think that part of the problem is that most of the people on FV have alts or even mains on other servers and are used to operating under a different set of rules. The rules on FV are different, but we (and yes, I do include myself here) are still trying to use methods that work with the old rulesets.<br><br>The rules HAVE changed. We must adapt to the new ruleset and find new ways to cope with the problems it presents us with. <br><br>I arrived in Qeynos too late in life to do quest for the Int earrings in the aqueducts (L17 Wiz from Freeport). So when I get the time, I plan to hire a couple of mercenaries to go and get them for me. On the other hand, I'm heading to High Pass Hold to obtain a certain Testament of Vaneer. I plan to use it in trade at a later date (assuming the no drop flag has now gone).<br><br>I'm hoping that the population will slowly rise as the economy builds up and should also be given a boost when the Bazaar is finally opened for trading. This will enable newbies to stack up on TLC items they can get hold of and then put them up for sale in the Bazaar.<br><br>I'm not sure how it's all going to work out, but I'm definately hanging around to find out.<br><br>Malathos<br>Wizard of Firiona Vie <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/utrinnityfv.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Trinnity FV</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 18<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(1/10/02 2:24:15 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1060.topic&index=8>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Hmm ,,</span><hr size=1> My biggest complaint...my ONLY complaint regarding TLC on FV is that it truly cripples cultural smithing.
