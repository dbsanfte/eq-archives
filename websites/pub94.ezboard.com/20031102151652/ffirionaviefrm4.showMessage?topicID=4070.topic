<br>
Effect the Ranger, currently 44th season joined my group on a dungeon crawl in Rujarkian Hills.  I had been reticent to invite him because I had seen him in Karnor's the previous night wher ehis group had decided they could fight in the entrance way where my group was already fighting and kept pulling through us while then repeatedly begging us for Haste spells.  But I believe in second chances.<br>
<br>
We were not the ideal group.  We had an enchanter, cleric, shaman, warrior, bard and him.  As well, as is sometimes the case in North Ro dungeons we accidentally zoned into the dungeon before stopping to buff and med.  This put us behind schedule but we bore away.<br>
<br>
We fought for about ten minutes.  He kept stealing aggro.  I told him he had to Snare and he claimed he was yet all the mobs kept running at 20% life and aggroing adds the cleric had Pacified.  This forced me, the enchanter, to spend all my time on crowd control.  Meanwhile he was constantly complaining there was not enough DPS in the group.  I had done a role-call at the start so he was well aware of the classes going in.  He kept trying to lecture all of us on how to play when he clearly didn't understand how taunt works and wasn't taking any breaks to lose aggro despite having Haste.  I've played a ranger up to level 49 I know this is a necessary evil sometimes.  <br>
<br>
After about 25 minutes in the dungeon (less than 20 of that actually involving fighting) he announced that we were going to fail.  We were on a collection mission.  Anyone knows the timer is no real indication of how well you are doing on a collection mission.  He continued to whine, complain and be pessimistic until suddenly &quot;he had to get going&quot; which he announced in the middle of a fight where he had again not snared the mob.  <br>
<br>
Since he said had to go, as groupleader, I dropped him from the group.  He had been master looting but frankly I didn't care at that point.  He was bringing the entire group down and my groupmates all agreed with my decision.  <br>
<br>
I put him on ignore.  He then stayed in the dungeon for AT LEAST ten more minutes.  I thought he &quot;had to go&quot;?  The way back was clear and easy to find, he could have made it out easily.  He tried to contact another group mate near the end to, according to that group-mate, &quot;get some recognition&quot;.  That group-mate put him on ignore as I believe everyone eventually decided they would.<br>
<br>
We pressed on with just 5 of us and though we failed we were quite sure we could get the consolation prize.  Sadly a near total wipe was caused by an unsnared wounded mob resisting a last ditch attempt at root and running off to aggro an entire room.  We were short only 3 items at that point but felt there was not enough time to recover and continue (we might have pulled it off).<br>
<br>
So Effect, you were wrong.  Had you stayed we might well have won.  We certainly would have gotten a partial reward.  But you know what?  I am glad you left.  I could care less about the loot you had it was worth it to not have your negativity and bossiness in the group.  I just recommend no one ever group with you again.<br>

He wasn't *quite* as bad in my LDoN group, but not far off.<br>
<br>
Exact same pencheant for bossiness as well as a serious lewtwhore attitude.  When a Mask of the Sacrificed dropped - the +8 Wis mask in my Magelo - he demanded to roll on it, even though he couldn't wear it, until the three other group members who couldn't wear the mask leaned on him to stop being an ass.  I end up winning the mask, an upgrade for me.<br>
<br>
He still spent the rest of the dungeon more worried about phat lewts and what everyone else was doing than his own damn work being the MT.  We did succeed, but mostly because the group was really competent and ignored his put-downs and rabid desire to pass the blame onto someone and rant when something went wrong.<br>
<br>
He was already on my avoid list for his attitude and loot behavior, but this situation you're telling us about just makes him firmly on my no-group list.<br>

<br>
I agree with all said, except the same thing everyone else is on about.  Sorry, but that's *damn* near as close to ideal as it gets.  DPS a bit low?  Well, sure, but with crowd control and slowing and a spare healer and a bard for health/mana regen there should be no such thing as down time.  Zero.  Assuming things work right anyway.  That's a case where steady group DPS can make up for lower burst DPS.<br>
<br>
Now, I know your group didn't work well, which sucks, but if it had been that's one hell of a list of classes.  There are weeks I would have killed to be in a group that balanced, if not for the additional factor that it was apparently balanced in terms of competence (as in a &quot;nice&quot; mix of competence and incompetence) as well.<br>

Was a pain in the ass there as well not snaring (we were a small group without a healer so runners sucked).  He claimed to be a &quot;Shadow Magi&quot; in roll call, and when /who showed him as a ranger, I was wondering wtf he wasn't snaring.<br>
<br>
Fast forward a few weeks, LDoN is released and I see him again.  We go into LDoN with Ranger (effect), Necro, Wizard, and a magician..  and another class I cant remember.  We had no healer, and many first time LDoN adventurers so we were ready to deal with no succeeding, but hoped for the best.<br>
<br>
Anyway, since it was &quot;his&quot; group - he took his bossy attitude to town.  When someone went ahead to pull, he would spawm &quot;Im leader&quot; about 5 times - apparently wanting to go first.  All in all, we did come close to succeeding.. it was a rescue mission, and we made it to the guy and halfway out when all of a sudden we get mad aggro from a room we'd obviously missed clearing.  Everyone then zones, dies, or FD's as the hostage was killed rather quickly.  <br>
<br>
Effect comes back, bitches and whines, then drops the group with a bad attitude.  *shrugs*  Considering the make up we had, and it being the first dungeon for most of the people involved I was pleased with the experience.  Succeeding would've been great, but it was fun regardless save for the attitude from Effect.<br>
<br>
To wrap up, he hasnt made permanent ignore, but he's close since he's always shouting for buffs and such it seems.  He has made it to the avoid at all costs list however. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showUserPublicProfile?gid=antoinnolouj>AntoinNolouj</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>EQ doesn't drain your brain, honest.</span><br>  Posts: 353<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(9/23/03 5:05 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=4070.topic&index=6>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: My first asshat report: Effect the Ranger</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>To add to DPS Bard was mixing mana song and berserk.

<br>
An average bard can twist 3 songs.  Twisting 4 is about as much as the game engine will allow you until you get some form of extended song duration--I believe it goes up with level but my dad's the bard, not me.<br>
<br>
Manasong can cause problems because it's instant and not twistable per se.<br>

<br>
But a few thought occur to me:<br>
<br>
1) This sounds a great group. Not enough DPS - a warrior, ranger and bard all under chanter and bard haste? Plus a shammy who doesn't have to worry about heals because you've got a cleric. Plus a chanter who doesn't have to worry about slowing because you've got a shammy slowing and so can throw a few nukes. <br>
<br>
2) Re. crowd control - why wasn't the bard crowd controlling? As a chanter I love grouping with a *good* bard because they leave me with nothing to mezz. The bard should have been single pulling all they way - there should have been no need at all for the cleric to be using pacify. I've been round LDON dungeons with a bard who knows what hes doing and finished with 45 minutes to spare and cast mezz about twice. <br>
<br>
3) I can understand the bard swapping snare for mana song on the understanding the ranger would take care of snares. But mana song isn't neccessary for success - unless you and the cleric wanted to chain nuke your way round the entire dungeon. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

Without the retard ranger, I'd agree that DPS was a little low. But with, you should've been able to do it. With the bard snaring. I don't know what level you all are, but the bard has access to two songs. I hope your bard reads this. Maybe it will help impart a little wisdom and make your groups better for the future. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

<br>
Level 23 slow / snare song. <br>
<br>
Secondly:<br>
<br>

<br>
Level 51 slow/snare song, which also reduces AC/AGI of target.<br>
<br>
Personally, I use this (level 51) song thusly (The former song could be used for the same technique, without the AC debuff):<br>

When pulling, I will pull with the snare. This acts as a ghetto slow on pull (30%), which is very nice when you realize that it doesn't do much for aggro, and helps the tank out in the first few seconds before the real group slower can nail the target with a slow.  Even when I'm not pulling, I will usually try and land this song as soon as the warrior is engaging the target. That extra little slow is a huge help because the enchanter (or shaman, or beastlord, whatever) then gets a little more breathing space before he/she needs to slow. This isn't really very important until stuff starts hitting in the 500s. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
I sometimes twist this in to help with the AC debuff. Sometimes I don't. Depends on my mood. BUT. When I'm snaring, I will swap this song in when the target gets to 30%. (Yes 30%. That way if I don't think about it when it's at 20 and it starts to run, I don't kill the party) There's absolutely no need to have it playing the entire time as snare is mostly useless at 70%. (Not fully useless. Just mostly) Enough additional DPS would've been added and the target would've been snared, thus reducing the potential for disaster. <br>

<br>
Manasong is an interesting enigma. It doesn't work like other songs like the cantana of soothing which has an icon. It actually triggers the mana increase at the end of each casting. Instantly. Theoretically, a bard can sit (well, stand. Stationary) and play nothing but mana song, and when the song ends, play mana song again. This helps to decrease downtime due to out of mana and can triple mana reproduction from bards. I call this technique Mana Pumping. (If you've ever seen me say Mana Pump, this is what I'm doing)<br>
<br>
On the other hand, it's really boring to do, and as a bard, I don't want to spend 4 hours twisting non stop when in an XP group. So don't always ask me to do it.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showUserPublicProfile?gid=anasong>Anasong</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 29<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(9/23/03 7:41 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=4070.topic&index=10>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: My first asshat report: Effect the Ranger</span><hr size=1> Blame the Bard its not the stupid rangers fault.<br>

I personally will never snare if there is a snare class in the group.<br>
<br>
Rangers are snarers not bards only a retart would expect a bard to be group snarer when a ranger is in group.<br>

My apologies that this happened to you. I shall mention it to the other officers within our guild and it will be looked into. However, all I ask is that next time you contact an officer before venting upon these boards so we can deal with the matter privately and efficiently. My guild rarely if ever comes to rant upon these boards nor has need to and would prefer that things stay that way. Though of course, you have the right to come here. I am merely asking.<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :D --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/happy.gif ALT=":D"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  If you need help with an issue like this I, myself am available most days between 10:30p - 3:00am Gmt (-2:00 from est.) and more often than not there is atleast 1-2 other officers about the remaining times. . Again my apologies that you had such a terrible experience and it will be looked into. <br>

<br>
Do look into this one. I grouped with Effect last night in LDoN and have to confirm. Worst ranger ever.<br>
<br>
I was the cleric during this group, but I do play a Ranger as my main, so have some experiance there. And by far an large, Effect is a lousy ranger, and much worse is a horrible personality in the group.<br>
<br>
The group consisted of 2 mages, 2 warriors, 1 ranger and cleric. I pacified and we started off with ranger arrow pulling, which didn't work because Effect couldn't lose agro if you blindfolded it and spun it around 10 times. So we moved to Mage pulling with pet, and again Effect would get agro. <br>
<br>
I had a couple of resisted pacifies, and we survived the first one, but I was LoM from having to constantly heal Effect. He whined and complained, and got into a fight with one of the warriors in the group about the 'bad pull' as he put it. What a pain in the butt. It wasn't a bad pull, it was pacify gone bad. He did not understand.<br>
<br>
Anyway, had a 3rd resisted pacify and got killed for that one. Came back and got killed again. So we called the group to an end. I rezzed one of the warriors who had been killed, myself twice and left. Worst LDoN experiance ever. Luckly next group was with friends and really made up for that one.

Well, sort of, but power pulsing the mana song will result in what they call 'phantom mana'.  Your mana bar will appear to be full, but on the first cast it will reset to the accurate amount of mana regenerated.  You can read all about it  <!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://&quot;http://pub142.ezboard.com/feqdivabardsofeverquestfrm2.showMessage?topicID=753.topic">HERE</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--><br>
<br>
Therefore, whilst I agree with Anasong that the Ranger sucked and should have been snaring, as soon as the group realised that the Ranger sucked, the Bard should have compensated and loaded up snare.  The Bard doesn't need to twist it in for the entire battle, just make a note of when the mobs begin to run and twist in in just before then!!  Yes, mana regen would have dropped slightly, but at least you wouldn't have to deal with those nasty runners! <br>
<br>
The Bard has eight song slots, so there would be no reason in the world why they couldn't have it loaded up and twist it in at the end of the fight to compensate for the sucky Ranger .... <br>
