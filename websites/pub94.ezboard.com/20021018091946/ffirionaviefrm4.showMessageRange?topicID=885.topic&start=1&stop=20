<br>
The people directly involved:<br>
Joe - Ogah\Akane\Nabiki<br>
Charles - Belika (now called Shoug I believe)<br>
Jason - Zokof (second nabiki owner)<br>
Michael - third Nabiki owner<br>
<br>
This story would never have come out if I hadn't logged in on Saturday.  I haven't played EQ for 1.5 months or so, but still read the FV boards from time-to-time.  I read lastweek that a good friend of mine, Lyonn, had achieved his epic, so I decided to log in and congratulate him.  Lyonn thanked me for the congratulations, and also had some disturbing news for me.  <br>
<br>
He had discovered that Ogah was the person who had stolen the Nabiki account, and that Ogah is actually the original Akane (Joe).<br>
<br>
<br>
FLASHBACK TO DECEMBER 2001:<br>
<br>
Joe had a falling out with FnF and was not happy with EQ anymore.  He decided to put both of his FV accounts (Akane &amp; Nabiki) up for sale on Playerauctions.  I, Jason, was tired of my then current server, Vazaelle, and decided to try out the new special rules server, FV.<br>
<br>
I saw Joe's auction on playersauctions and sent him some questions about his cleric account.  He answered my questions and we struck a deal for me to purchase the cleric account from him (the money was actually payed to Charles however via PayPal (this is important later on)).  <br>
<br>
I received the login info from Joe and logged in.  The level 53 cleric was named Nabiki.  I decided to run over to Karnor Castle and see if I could get a group.  There was only one group in Karnor castle.  It was comprised of some FnF people (Qixx, Sliver, Heagen, and someone else).  I was denied a place in that group because Nabiki had a terrible reputation.  The same thing happened when I went to Velks.  I resolved at that point to make a new character and not play Nabiki as a main.<br>
<br>
I made a beastlord named Zokof.  As I leveled and began to meet other players, I befriended some people in the guild Resolution and eventually joined that guild.  We had some very good times.  Coinfist (guildleader of Reso) then hooked me up with another beastlord named Lyonn and we leveled together from the 30s to 50.<br>
<br>
The legends server was announced and I told Lyonn and the Reso guild that I wanted to try it out.  The dynamic content sounded pretty cool.  I enrolled and Zokof was transferred over to Stormhammer (legends server) when the server opened.  <br>
<br>
At this time a real life friend of mine decided to play on FV, so I gave him the Nabiki info to help himself level.<br>
<br>
My friend was not playing very much, so I decided to sell the Nabiki account on playerauctions.  This would allow me to recoup some of the money I had earlier spent, and give someone else a chance to level a bit faster.  Michael contacted me and I sold the Nabiki account.<br>
<br>
A couple weeks after the account was sold to Michael, I got a desperate e-mail from him.  He stated that he could no longer log into the Nabiki account, and that someone else was playing Nabiki online.<br>
<br>
I instantly wrote back to Michael explaining that I was not the original owner and could not get the account back thru Verant, but would contact Joe immediately to see what assistance he could offer us.  After weeks of working with Joe (and Charles a little bit) he basically did nothing.  He said he could not get the account back thru Verant because he no longer had the CD key, and would not do anything else.  Joe also then moved and did not supply a new phone number so I could no longer contact him by phone.<br>
<br>
In the end, Michael's money was refunded back to him and I was out the money I put into the account.  There was not much I could do at that point since I did not know who stole Nabiki.  <br>
<br>
After two months on Legends, the dynamic contect was not that good and I cancelled the Legends service.  Zokof was restored to FV server a few weeks later.<br>
<br>
I contacted Lyonn, Coinfist, Rollen, and other friends to let them know Nabiki had been stolen and to keep their eyes open for her.  I was hoping that by knowing who Nabiki was grouped with, or who she was powerlvling, that this info would lead me to realize who stole her.<br>
<br>
Since Nabiki was always anon (due to server rules) I could never find her to see what she was doing.  I finally grew tired of EQ, gave some gear and gems to Rollen to distribute to Reso, and logged out.<br>
<br>
I have been reading the FV forum boards off and on since and read that Lyonn achieved his epic.  I logged on Saturday and luckily he was online.  I sent him a /tell congratualting him on his epic (WAY TO GO), and he responded with a thanks, and that he had figured out who stole Nabiki.<br>
<br>
He explained to me that Akane (Joe) had started an ogre warrior named Ogah, and had been seen multiple times powerleveling Ogah with Nabiki.  He also said that Ogah is seen quite often in Velks leveling with Nab.  I ran Zokof to Velks and logged him out there hoping to see Ogah and Nab together when I would log in the next day (Sunday).<br>
<br>
Well I logged in Sunday morning and soon afterward Ogah and Nabiki logged on in Velks.  I said hello to Ogah and he said &quot;sup&quot;.  I asked him if he was Joe.  He replied, &quot;Who is this exactly?&quot;  I responded with his social security number and birthdate (did some research on him).  Nabiki was logged out within a minute, and Ogah logged out about 3 min afterward without another word.  During the time he was logged on, I inspected him and he has done quite well.  Runed Bolster Belt, Chestplate of Vindication, Sleepers weapon, Eyepatch of Plunder, etc...  <br>
<br>
His stealing Nabiki to powerlevel his new warrior definitely paid out for him, but the real kicker, the thing that dumbfounded me was that he was in Resolution, my old guild.  How could this be when I told Coinfist and Rollen that Nab had been stolen and to keep a look out for her?<br>
<br>
Apparently Ogah gave Rollen some story that I had not paid for Nabiki so he took the account back (which is a lie since I have the paypal history to prove it).  When I spoke to Coinfist he said he had forgotten about the Nabiki situation.  My point here is not to flame the leadership of Reso in any way.  They were not directly involved and it had been over a month, but I will be curious to see what they do from here on out knowing they have a thief in their guild...<br>
<br>
What do I want?  What is the purpose of this post?<br>
<br>
I don't want Joe to continue to profit from his stealing of the Nabiki account.  He obviously powerleveled up Ogah and possibly his friend Shoug (Charles\Belika) so that they could get more loot, sell their accounts and perhaps steal them again (it worked the first time).  I laid this story out on the soapbox so that the server (or those who read here) will know what Ogah is, and be careful of him. <br>
<br>
What am I doing now?<br>
<br>
I have written the FV server GM and Sony Online support copying in Joe's mails to prove that the Nabiki account had been sold and should be banned.<br>
<br>
I have filed a complaint with PayPal against Charles (since he is the one the money was paid to).  I will not be reimbursed for the money I spent (since the transaction was 9 months ago), but my complaint will become a part of his permanent PayPal record, and if he gets more complaints perhaps they will take some action.<br>
<br>
I have filed a complaint with the Internet Fraud Complaint Center (associated with the FBI) against Charles for accepting money from me and then stealing the account back (he in cooperation with Joe).<br>
<br>
I am collecting all the information on Joe I can find to use in some future action.  So far I have collected all sorts of data<br>
<br>
Thanks for your time.  I know this post was a book, but I didn't just want to say Ogah\Akane\Nabiki is a thief and can't be trusted.<br>
<br>
Regards,<br>
Jason<br>

NOTES:<br>
<br>
- The E-Bay situation has been debated many times.  I hope this thread does not turn into a flame war about buying\selling virtual data.  Perhaps I deserved to have the account stolen because I purchased it?  Maybe, but either way, this thread was created with the intent of exposing Joe (Ogah) for what he is so that he cannot profit from his stealing.  If you wish to discuss buying\selling, please start a different thread.<br>
<br>
- I really don't expect any kind of response to this post.  I just want people on FV to know about Joe and his stealing.<br>
<br>
- Joe becareful if you decide to debate on this.  I have saved every single e-mail and will not hesitate to post them.  I have nothing to lose.  However, with all your new characters and new found loot, you have quite a bit to lose. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/usyllestraefv.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Syllestrae FV</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>New Mod!</span><br>  Posts: 425<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(6/24/02 2:09:18 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Ogah (akane) stole Nabiki account on FV server</span><hr size=1>    Speaking as the player &amp; not the board mod, I have only one comment to make (well, two actually).<br>
<br>
   1) I met both Belika and Akane/Nabiki back in October shortly after the server opened.  They were hands down the rudest individuals I have ever come across on the FV server, a title which they still hold to this day (we're not talking oh no, they KS'd my orc pawn kinda stuff).  I wouldn't trust them so much as to buy a banded tunic from them (or their original players anyways) let alone exchange accounts.<br>
<br>
    That being said, as with all of these kind of situations, there's not really any proof.  Just as easily as Nabiki's original owner could've restored the account info back to him, you could've restored it back to you.  If you're posting this as a good advertisement of &quot;Look how sucky things get when you sell / trade accounts&quot; regardless of who you're buying it from, well then I'll give ya that <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <br>
<br>
   2) One very good reason it's against the EULA to sell/trade accounts is because this kind of stuff happens all the time.  I'd highly advise people <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>   not</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> to do this, as I've known a lot of people who've done it w/ people they were sure were their best friends ever and <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>   still</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> had this kind of stuff happen to them.  If levelling in EQ is so boring that you'd buy an account to bypass it, you should really think about how much enjoyment you're actually getting out of the game and consider a new hobby.  <br>

Don't know what else to say.  I have seen both Ogah (an ogre warrior) and Shoug (a rogue) in the bazaar and know who he is talking about.  I don't know Ogah or Shoug very well but I know Shoug has sent me several tells for ports.  I also remember one of Shoug's tirades on the market channel a month or two ago when he was trying to sell some silver chitin hand wraps.  If memory serves, one of his selling points was that for men beating women, it would increase the haste of your attacks.  Lovely.  I believe they are both members of Resolution.  I would be very interested to see what their response to these charges is.<br>
<br>
This is definitely not your classic troll post.  He provides plenty of supporting detail and is leveling specific charges.  <br>
