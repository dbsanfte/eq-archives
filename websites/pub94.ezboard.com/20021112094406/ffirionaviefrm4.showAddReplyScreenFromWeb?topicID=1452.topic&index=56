<br>
There has been a lot of fighting between these three guilds.  Mistakes, poor judgement calls, and outright hostility has come from all three.<br>
<br>
What it comes down to is this: in the end, no guild can stop another guild from waking the sleeper.  All they can do is commit to not doing it themselves.  Step up and say, whatever those other guilds do, WE will do the right thing.<br>

<br>
First off i am proud member of Fire and Fury. Level 60 shaman with pretty good gear. I have been to ST. I have tried crazy stuff, Solo PoG, duo ssra basement, duo/solo in cazic. I got a few points to cover prepare for rambling.<br>
<br>
First off regarding Myga. I was one of the 5 people who went and killed Myga in the middle of our raids. After that day there a Reso member, Sirena (if i recall or spelled correct), sent me a tell showing her displeasure. We chated for a good long time and I think we came to an understanding. Resolution feels that they where the only ones killing Myga therefore desreved the spawn. Well the big problem with there logic is they where not the only one killing Myga PHs, so where we and who knows who else.<br>
<br>
Regarading when a part in Rollens post : <br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> &quot;First of all the 100K reward was posted after FnF ganked back to back Myga's by timing Reso's clearing of the PHs.&quot;<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
this is incorrect. Please see the following links. the first dated August 8th, <!--EZCODE AUTOLINK START--><a href="http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm38.showMessage?topicID=226.topic">pub94.ezboard.com/ffirion...=226.topic</a><!--EZCODE AUTOLINK END--><br>
and the second August 11th <br>
<!--EZCODE AUTOLINK START--><a href="http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.showMessage?topicID=1181.topic">pub94.ezboard.com/ffirion...1181.topic</a><!--EZCODE AUTOLINK END--><br>
Those links take you to a old posts 1, Coin offering 100k for myga and the other 3 days later Rollen skirting the Myga topic, and yes this is when it took place.<br>
<br>
So sorry Rollen you are wrong regarding that.<br>
<br>
Again i say no one owned the myga spawn cause many peopple where killing the PHs and Reso was no angel.<br>
<br>
<br>
Next topic. KT.<br>
<br>
Who was there first we will never really know, cause both sides believe they are right. Facts i do know is that while i assuming Reso was still buffing FaF moved up towards where the snow starts at the WL zone. we pulled a few mobs then your entire guild ran up toward his castle. Now you started pulling mobs and stuff. also making it clear if we pulled over you a /petion would result. so you effectivly cock blocked us. Okay whatevers thats nice.<br>
<br>
But then you got everythign dead but KT so ran back to WL zone where we had been sitting waiting for you to try so we got a chance. From my understanding the GM told capa have the guild stay there and not interfer. We proceded to let you attempt KT even though you had run ahead so we could not pull then when only KT was left ran back and pulled him. Regarding Mod Rods i dont know who picked them up. I know i did not. i would be pissed to learn that any other FaF did. basicly you guys put up a good fight, got him to abotu 25% and wiped. we zoned.<br>
<br>
Then as CR started someone trained the zone. i dont know who you dont know who. Coin saying it was us is dumb. A lot of people proceded to die FaF and Reso.<br>
<br>
Following this both guilds sat and talked, i personly cyb0rzed with Bri (yeah she liked it), and capa and coin and GM had to come to an agreement. From my understanding Coinfist was not going to let us have a try because he felt that Reso's attempt was not fair since we where sitting there causing lag. Now i am sure there was more lag than normal, but that can be fixed my looking at the ground. One thing i find interesting is that accounts from Reso members you guys where not every organized and Oogmog who was first tank was not even supposed to be first tank. basicly it sounds like you guys where not very prepared either way, and it was not like we where tryign to pull over you.<br>
<br>
Again who was right i dont know, i am sure both guilds did wrong. personaly i would have liked to /ran 0 1 in the first place gotten it over with.<br>
<br>
<br>
New topic KT is dead. ST (old things, not waking)<br>
<br>
Reso and FaF had a ST rotation when we first went in, this is when ST key was not no drop. then the key went No drop. No guild entered ST for what i would guess was month or two. Finnaly FaF went in. Reso assumed that the rotation was still up and therefore was pissed when we went in again after. <br>
<br>
Now was FaF in the wrong or Reso wrong to think rotation was still on? i say both again. I mean the circumstances changed drasticly it was a new time and place. I personally feel that keeping the rotation did not make sense. after all Both guild knew that if push came to shove Reso had a better track record of getting places, due to there larger numbers and different play/raid times. the funny part is both guild stayed away from ST after this little fight for a while that is.<br>
<br>
<br>
Coinfist, you made a refrence to kland. When that took place it was simular to KT, both guild where forming. if i recall there was a group of FaF there before hand but not enough to kill him. Either way you guys pulled wiped. Kland went back to spawn was full hp we pulled and killed. then after that a few rude comments where made which embarresed me as a member of FaF, but whatevers thats ancient history.<br>
<br>
now to stop addressing topic brought up and just ramble.....<br>
<br>
Is Resolution a Bad guild? no they are not. Is Fire and Fury a bad guild? no they are not. Is Awakened Souls a bad guild? no they are not. People who hold such prejudice against another guild make me sick. To be so ignorant as to think that your guild is so superior to another guild is just plain dumb. it shows you really dont have a clue. Are any of the three previously mentioned guilds angels? hell no we all have our faults. Is the leaders of Reso and FaF spawns of the devil? I have good friends in Fire and Fury and Resolution, hell if i was not in FaF i would have no problem join reso, assuming they would have me  <br>
<br>
so whats the point of this way to long of post? people need to shut up for a change and look in the mirror and realize what dumb ass's they are coming across as. this goes for Fire and Fury and Resolution.<br>
<br>
Both guilds are strong and have impressed me with feets i have heard of or taken part in.<br>

That's good.. That's real good.  Are you done?  Thanks.. Now go back to your closet and keep thinking that.  You know it's true, I know it's true(more than one person that was in FnF validated this).

Time to bust out the logs for all of you.<br>
<br>
I welcome any valid logs here.  Don't give me that leapfrog shit.  We had a group in the zone waiting for our raid time.  We had 8 when you had none. (At this point we started gathering for KT)<br>
<br>
View the logs and see for yourself.  At no point did you have more numbers in the Zone than Reso.  You didn't even have your lowest number for killing KT in the zone when KT was pulled. (someone refresh my memory from FnF's greatest kills l ever in the history of EQ vol. 1)<br>

You tried to claim KT with 12 when we had 18.<br>
We had ~30 when you had 23 (still have to look at the logs for exact number)<br>
<br>
And to be clear.  The GMs said to not to interfere (according to you) but at no point did we get a valid/clean attempt on KT at the zoneline with FnF at the zone.  <br>
<br>
View the logs and YOU telll me each and everyone who reads it who is leapfrogging.  <br>

==================================<br>
<br>
On top of that, one of you trained our CR.  Don't even try to deny it.<br>
<br>
Point in fact:  <br>
If 18 is needed to claim a mob, we had it you didn't<br>
If that's not the case, only when we pulled KT did you have a force to do KT.  Well maybe you were going for a record and trying him with 19 or something who knows for sure.  <br>
You were beaten in a FCFS straight up and you didn't have the decency to leave the zone and say &quot;maybe next time guys&quot;.  Instead it was, &quot;lets see if we can screw them up&quot;<br>
<br>
I have 2 computers with very similar logs, although this is the log that I used /who on more frequently, the results are very similar. <br>
<br>
If you have valid logs to prove this otherwise I'd like to see them.<br>

Well that's exactly what FnF did.  They showed up after us with less numbers and want to roll on KT.<br>
<br>
So if you think that's fair stop scheduling all mobs.  Because soon as you plan something we'll show up with 2 groups and ask for a roll.<br>
<br>
It's total BS and you are only kidding yourselves FNF.<br>
<br>
IF you showed up first with 2/3rds of the number to kill a mob, I would have turned our guild around and we would have done something else (Like Klandicar ;P ).  I'm not talking about claiming a mob with 1 person either.<br>
<br>
In the case like KT, 1 group can clear the necessary mobs to KT, so nobody should be able to claim him with that.  Hell we had 8 in the zone when you had none.  I'm not going to claim KT with that.  I said the race was on, and the logs show you who clearly won and who wanted to play bad sport.<br>
<br>
All you had to do is walk away.  Instead you didn't and dug yourself deeper in the hole.  This just shows me what this guild is really about.  It's not about better themselves or having fun, it's about how much you can spite others.<br>
<br>
FCFS is healthy and fun, but when you lose, you just have to walk away. <p>Macgee<br>

Well Rollen is just a little sore.  Again I'm all for FCFS.   You spot a mob up...great.  If a group is already there clearing PHs and more are on the way and you try to gather a greater force quicker....well that ends up in the grey area.<br>
<br>
You want to follow reso around waste your time, that's fine, I hope you all are better than that (and I'm sure most of you are).  If you don't want to clear phs and rely on others to do it and just check to see if myga is up when PHs are due, well again, you are approaching the grey area.  Tactic is valid, and adheres to FCFS but is not morally correct or honorable.<br>
<br>
Klandicar.  Well here is another of FnF finest hour.  Both teams start gathering for a mob.  One teams beats them to the pre-defined 18 (we had set 18 long ago and it applied then, not sure if it does today).  Instead of cutting their loses, FnF chooses to wait to see if Reso would fail.  I believe it was our first attempt on him with good numbers (27 at the time).  FnF choose to wait in the shadows.  When we failed, they pulled.  <br>
<br>
PnP says it's okay, you waited for kland to become unengaged.  But morally and honorably, you know it wasn't right.  Top that off with FnF's comments after the fight and we know exactly what kind of guild you all are.  No we weren't KSed, you didn't engage a mob that was hurt hps wise, although he was probably still debuffed.<br>
<br>
KT Yeah, you guys would have preferred to Roll.  Why?  Because you knew you didn't have the numbers when we did. and you knew we were there first.  You're going to say it is fair for Resolution?  What did FnF have to gain?  A chance at KT.  What did they have to lose? Nothing.  What did Resolution have to gain?  Nothing, we were there first, we had the numbers first, etc.  What did Reso have to lose?  KT.<br>
<br>
So you're saying everytime Resolution wants to do a mob all we have to do is show up in the same zone you're gathering in and ask for a /rand?<br>
<br>
Seem fair to everyone? <p>Macgee<br>

I just /rand 1 3 a couple of times to get two guilds for my example. I don't think having a limited number of high level zones is by design for competition. Fixed resources simply don't scale to a dynamic population. VI doesn't want us fighting over resources, they add new servers, new zones and such to alleviate that as much as possible. With PoP they might actually get it closer and give each raiding party their own private copy of the zone they're raiding. Scaling is good.  Ultimately they'll have to face facts and install a &quot;Game Over&quot; script so we can get some closure here and move on to the next game.  <p><CENTER>
