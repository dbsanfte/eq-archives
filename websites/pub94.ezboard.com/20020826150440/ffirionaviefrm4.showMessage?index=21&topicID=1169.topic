I have met a *lot* of lower level characters, though, who seem to think that the higher level character should do everything after they say &quot;Hail, Titaisia&quot;.  I roleplay this like most people would if they were called to by a stranger.  I stop, and say hi there, or hail them back, and wait to see what it is they wanted.  A lot of time, they run off.  *sigh*<br>
<br>
I want to roleplay, but Titaisia (and I think most of us) aren't going to tell our life's story to every character who hails us.  If you want to roleplay with someone, think of something to say to them after &quot;Hail, Titaisia.&quot;<br>
<br>
For the people who have been on Firiona Vie longer, there is one thing I think almost all of us could do to improve roleplaying, and it is pretty easy.  Unless you are having a conversation that your characters wouldn't want others to overhear, try to remember not to roleplay in /gsay.  I think just overhearing other people roleplaying will encourage new people that roleplaying does happen, and maybe it will give someone overhearing the conversation a chance to join in the roleplaying a little bit, too.<br>
<br>
Oh!  One last word of warning: consider your race (and class, if it is obvious) when you are roleplaying with someone.  If you are obviously of an evil race or class, for example, maybe that woodelf ranger *is* roleplaying when she ignores you.  Not every character who considers herself your enemy will immediately insult you and challenge you to a duel.<br>
<br>
I hope that helps, and keep trying!)) <p>Captain Titaisia Lightheart<BR>

My friend, Traw, and myself were trying to figure out where to go one night. Off to Paludal for the hundreth hunt? Maybe explore some zone we have never been to, until we get killed and have a long corpse run? What to do to have an interesting and fun night?<br>
As I was on my way to meet him in the Moors, he sent a tell asking if we'd be interested in helping a young kitty make her way to the Nexus.<br>
My first thought was, geez, someone that needs to meet a twinking buddy on Norrath. Still, I caught up to him and a young rogue. Her name escapes now.<br>
All along the way, our talk was RP'd like a youngster asking advice from her elders. She asked how she should play her class. We gave some advice, like her best friends will be those that can taunt and why.<br>
By the time we got to Shadow Haven, she was asking questions of who she should avoid and who to hunt with. I like the tree elves because they have great scratching posts and even the snobby high elves can be fun when they let their guard down.<br>
She never asked for anything but advice.<br>
Once in Haven, we took her to the bank and got her some things that had helped us out in our early hunts; low-end items that had been gathering dust. No twinkage that could start her off on the wrong paw with other youngsters.<br>
She accepted the gifts, in a noble fashion. Which again made her standout.<br>
We decided to escort her to her final destination, after all that orc centurion could attack her before she'd have a chance to bind her spirit. <br>
While we waited for the Scion, her questions continued as she wondered what were the big creatures of the realm. Being a bard, I spun her tales of dragons and those so-called gods.<br>
When we arrived in Gfey and gave her the quick tour…it was like seeing Norrath again for the first time. When she saw Felwithe, she seemed taken aback and remarked at its beauty.<br>
We helped her learn how to get around in Gfey and where she should begin.<br>
Before we had to camp for the night, we gave her lessons in elvish, to make her hunts with the pointy ear furless ones easier. Traw boosted her natural abilities and off she went on her first hunt. There was so much more we could have taught her. Even the game mechanics were roleplayed. It was not even the usual old English thee's and thou's that seems to be the first RP some young ones have.<br>
Last I saw she was nearing level 10 hopeful of one day reaching a level where she could hunt with us. If she were to accomplish such a feat, I would find her to be a worthy hunting partner.<br>
My shaman friend and I never made any experience  nor coin. But, it had been one of the best nights we had in the realm for some time. All because we met a new rogue, fresh paws on the great trail and excited to leave her mark on the world.<br>

I was after shade silks, but ran into the city to buy some alcohol.  When I came out of the city, there was a cat standing there, looking puzzled at 'the blue creature' and purring to himself.  He was working on his quest armour and I ended up handing him a few of the crude stone weapons that I got from the sshak dratha, and pulling a few monsters in for him.  He asked me all sorts of questions about Neriak and Teir'dal society and asked me what my role was in supporting the city - he was apparently responsible for foraging for food for Vah Shir.  I had to explain that we Teir'dal are so factionalist that we really support our own Houses/guilds, not the city as a whole ... guess our twisty blue politics didn't make much sense to the poor cat ... anyway it was nice to see.  =) <p><table border=0><tr><td width=20%><img src="http://users.bigpond.net.au/stbt/didi/a_didisig.gif" height=120 width=120></td><td><FONT FACE="Tempus Sans ITC" SIZE="2">
