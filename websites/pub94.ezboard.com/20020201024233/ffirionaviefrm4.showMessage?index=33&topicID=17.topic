Banegrivm, denying that your attitude is one of arrogance is preposterous.<br>
<br>
&quot;Face it, deal with it, or leave. The RP'ers are the ones with all the bullets on this server and many feel likewise. If they want to RP great, if not then don't get offended for the RP'ed responses you get. Plain and simple; own up to it.&quot;<br>
<br>
First of all, you are the one who originally said you wouldn't deal with people who don't roleplay.  I guess that would make it pretty hard for powergamers to deal with people who share your attitude.  Second, as I stated in my first post, the majority of the people who've responded on this thread are completely overexaggerating the d00d problem.  Yes, the person reciting the lyrics to &quot;Because I Got High&quot; is a moron.  The last time I checked, though, the word &quot;moron&quot; wasn't synonymous with &quot;powergamer.&quot; (not that powergamer's an actual word or anything).  Just because someone chooses to play the game to &quot;win&quot; doesn't mean he or she isn't capable of roleplaying.  I have no idea what you mean when you say, &quot;don't get offended by the RP'd responses you get.&quot;  Why would a powergamer be offended?  It's not as if powergamers can't read the part of the server name that says roleplaying preferred.<br>
<br>
All in all, I think you're strongly prejudicing powergamers.  If you still think you aren't being arrogant, read Vexis's post and the ways he intends to interact with people.  How would you respond if you were playing a druid, and someone walked up who was red, and obviously had better equipment, and asked, &quot;Could I please have a sow?&quot;  Would you deny it to him because he didn't ask, &quot;Excuse me, fine Druid, could you please enchant my legs with the Spirit of Wolf?&quot;  Ignoring the person or refusing to give him or her sow will almost certainly leave the person with a sour taste in his mouth about roleplaying.  A much more constructive way to deal with it would have been to offer a kind, RP'd response and given him or her sow.  Maybe you'd pass the mood on.<br>
<br>
And lastly, consider this.  You don't know that RPers will be the ones with the bullets on this server in the end.  I'm all for roleplaying, and I honestly hope we won't need to argue about these matters a few months down the line because there aren't any problems, but, at this point, believing that roleplayers will outnumber powergamers here for the challenge is honestly wishful thinking.<br>

RP vs. Non-rp BS. The only reason I'm still posting is so my side has a voice! <br>
The problem with arrogant people who know they are &quot;right&quot; is that even if they are wrong they still view themselves as being right. I lightened up, tried to get a nice fun feel going, I didn't make out I was a freakin victim. That PvP idea's a good one /cackle.<br>
Its clear to me that the majority of the RP server will accept me and my friends/guild. If 3 people want to add me to ignore go right the hell ahead!<br>

Not only is it descending into outright hostility and name-calling (and I don't claim innocence) but it's also based on a server that hasn't even opened.<br>
<br>
Banegrivm, when you post on this board, you're asking to be judged.  I've never judged you personally, but I have judged your posts and your opinion, just as you've judged mine.  I never claimed to know you, but I don't think that should stop me from expressing my opinion as freely as you express yours.  You made no attempt to reasonably respond to my argument.  You weren't obligated to, of course, but I thought this board had more class than others.  You did, after all, refer to me as &quot;Mr. I know Banegrivm.&quot;<br>
<br>
With regard to you being one of the nicest people you know: I've had a hard time finding a post where you've been nice to anyone who's advocated an opinon different from yours.  Your response to Bludge's post was cold.  You show no compassion for people who have a harder time roleplaying in EverQuest than you do.  Someone saying, &quot;Could you please spare a Sow?&quot; is not an example of someone who is disrespecting you.  I cringe when I read what you said to Morrizar on Bludge's thread (before that movie, though <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> ).  And about immaturity, please read your last post here.  That's one of the most immature posts I've seen on this entire board.  What does you being a man of your word have anything to do with what we've been talking about?  I think that should have read, &quot;I'm incapable of respecting someone else's opinion.&quot;  Both here and on Bludge's thread, you claim you're only &quot;stating the facts.&quot;  Do you know how ignorant that sounds?  You are stating your opinion.<br>
<br>
Will you be saying you're the one with the bullets if powergamers outnumber roleplayers on FV?  I don't see any reason why it won't happen.  The rules are harder, but that's about it.  I know this is a pessimistic point of view, and I know it's crappy to rain on everyone's parade, but I think it needs mentioning.  I don't know what's left for roleplaying in EQ if this happens.  To be honest, I really don't see much hope if this fails.  Maybe after everyone's moved on to other games it'll be different.  Who knows.<br>
<br>
Banegrivm, all I hope is that you'll realize that such a dismal outlook on non-RPers only hinders roleplaying on the server.  That kind of thinking is what got powergamers and roleplayers fighting in the first place long ago.  Look over this entire board.  I see barely any examples, if any, of powergamers complaining about roleplayers on the server.  Almost all of them are just here for the change of game and the challenge, and most have specifically gone out of their way to say that they hope to get along with roleplayers fine.  If you roleplay to them, I'm sure they will return the favor.  On the other hand, this board is flooded with fanatical, extremist views that basically represent roleplaying only, and at all costs.  If you categorize yourself as one of these people, then I suggest cancelling your subscription to EQ and buying DAoC where roleplaying is enforced, because you'll never be able to get what you're looking for here.  On the other hand, if you'd only look at things a bit more moderately you'd discover a bright future for Firiona Vie.<br>

The funniest part of everyone arguing is that it'll mean nothing when the server goes up.  Those who enjoy it will keep playing.  Those who don't will come here and complain.  Cases like these are the only times I find myself visiting message boards and getting worked up.  Bludge's post is a perfect example at how easy it is to get burnt out on a server before it's even online.  I used to be into Shadowbane when I first read about it, but I got bored of it over a year ago and it STILL hasn't come out.<br>
<br>
Whatever.<br>
<br>
--EDIT--Oops, I posted again, I wasn't going to do that.  Ah, well, it had no relevance.<br>

If you don't like that, tough. <p>Banegrivm Shadowblight<br>Sovereign Lord of the 1st Fist of Light<br>www.1stfistoflight.com</p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/urazzlerdazzler.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Razzlerdazzler</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 72<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(10/4/01 9:18:30 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=17.topic&index=45>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: A thought on the Non-RPers</span><hr size=1> Damn you took a long time writing that post to accomplish absofreakin lutely nothing at all. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/umorrizarthesorcerer.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Morrizar the Sorcerer</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 102<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(10/4/01 9:19:37 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=17.topic&index=46>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: A thought on the Non-RPers</span><hr size=1> I have several things wrong with that post...<br>

Which half?  The part where you called me Mr &quot;I know Banegrivm&quot; that doesn't, or the one where you said I was judging YOU.  I thought, originally, it was you judging nonRPers.<br>
<br>
I haven't judged you.  I'm sure we could be best friends in game with or without knowing each other.<br>
<br>
Stop inflicting me with your &quot;truth.&quot;  I'm going to out on a limb here.  Just because you think what you're saying is the truth, doesn't mean it is.  It'd be nicer for everyone if you'd admit you're stating your opinion.  ROLEPLAYING PREFERRED.  PREFERRED.  Where's the required?  So stop acting like you own the place.<br>
<br>
At least, &quot;I don't think that will be the case at all. Not with one character and the server architechture,&quot; is upbeat.<br>
<br>
You won't have to put up with people who want uber loot.  They'll be off getting it and you'll never see them, except when WFP becomes the main auction zone.<br>

<br>
 - I never judged non RP'ers. In fact if YOU actually stopped to read back through my posts you would see even where I stated that I am sure those guys in the powergaming/uber guild are good people. Great, but again this isn't a a standard blue server.<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;I haven't judged you. I'm sure we could be best friends in game with or without knowing each other.<br>
<br>
 - I really hope thats the case, on both accounts. Your not gonna be a stinkin evil tho are ya? :P<br>

<br>
 - I am not, I just will be taking up residence here. I'ts an RP server. People don't want to RP on an RP server and they think they are above the ruleset...leave. That IS a fact.<br>
<br>
