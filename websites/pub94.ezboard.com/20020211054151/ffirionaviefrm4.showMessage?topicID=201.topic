I try not to bitch too much because who wants to hear it? It just pisses people off.  I feel I just have to get this off my chest, it's really bugging me.  Don't read if you want want to hear it.  <br><br>With the coming of Shadows of Luclin, my EverQuest playing experience has been significantly reduced.  I fall into the category of people who have the expansion, but don't run the models because their vid card won't fully support them.  I see about half of the armor, and not the other half.  Quite annoying.  <br><br>That's not the pain in the ass.  I can go without reskinned zones and new models.  I like my old breastplate better anyhow.  The problem is a whole bunch of graphical and otherwise issues that have suddenly sprung up:<br><br>-I see black splotches in many places I didn't before, like armor and hair.  This happened AFTER the initial patches, in one of the follow-up &quot;fixes.&quot;  <br><br>-I don't see the eyes through the visor slit in human helms<br><br>-I don't see full particles in spell effects anymore.  Especially the &quot;sphere&quot; that is created around a target in spells like Lifetap, Frost Rift, etc.  I have always and still have my particle density maxed.<br><br>-Zone times into certain Velious and Kunark zones takes forever and a day where it used to take 20 seconds or less.<br><br>-FPS bug in certain dungeons, like Guk or Cazic (we've all had this one)<br><br>-Framerate is raped in zones that I previously had no problem with before, like Iceclad, Lavastorm and Innothule.<br><br>-In these zones I now run either slower or (rarely) faster than my group.  This is an incredible pain in the ass, as I don't want people waiting on me, and I don't like dusting them either.  This particular bug drives me crazy, because I don't want some orc chasing me down when I have SoW because of a bug.<br><br>Probably some other crap too I can't think of.  I'm on a Laptop, otherwise I'd run out and by a GF2/3 and stick it right in.  850p3 and 256megs of ram.  The graphics card/chip in the laptop has 8megs, so it is within the limits of non-Luclin requirements, but I still get this bullshit (And yes, I did reinstall the drivers after dx8.1).<br><br>I figured the live team would fix this eventually, like they fixed some of the other bugs I had, but alas, it looks like there is no hope in sight, and my EverQuesting is less than it was before.<br><br>So just fuck you Luclin.  I can take it if my computer can't handle your prettiness, but you don't need to dump on what was perfectly fine before.<br><br>Ah.  I feel better now. <p><B><font color="darkred">Velve D'Verin</font><Br><small>40th Knight of Innoruuk</small><br>Kyorl'jabbuk of<BR><a href="http://members.tripod.com/selquar">House Sel'Quar</a></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=dalninil>Dalninil</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 79<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(1/4/02 2:17:45 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=201.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: /sigh.. /rude SoL</span><hr size=1> Haha time for all the kitty's to run in circle around Velve and crash his comp....<br><br><br>Also I agree it's been a pain to get my machine to run this stupid expansion right.. not that it does yet. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/uvordul.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Vordul</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 2<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(1/4/02 3:51:20 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=201.topic&index=2>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: /sigh.. /rude SoL</span><hr size=1> There's a way to &quot;fix&quot; the framerate problem a bit, although it's annoying as all hell.<br>You can take an older version of the eqgfx_dx8.dll and paste it over the newer version that got patched in on the 18th of last month.<br>If you need the older version of this, let me know and give me an email to send it to.<br>What you do is put the older version in a location you can get to easily. Then you run the patcher (auto-play has to be off). Then you paste the older file over the one in your EQ folder. Run the game after that and your set, framerates should improve.<br>The downside to this is that it makes the fonts big, big enough that unless you move your chat window all the way to the left, you won't see all of the longer lines of text. I didn't mind much at first, but it got pretty damn annoying and so I stopped using it.<br><br>Oh, btw, make a copy of the latest version of that dll (the one currently in your folder) and move it to another easy to reach location as well. Every time you close EQ you'll have to replace the old file with the new one so that EQ doesn't try and patch the new one in again. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ublakkon.showPublicProfile?language=EN>blakkon</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 17<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(1/8/02 3:59:44 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=201.topic&index=3>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: /sigh.. /rude SoL</span><hr size=1> Vordul, <br><br>could you mail me a link to the eqgfx_dx8.dll you are referring too?

If you have a Voodoo card with 32mb that's actually good enough, so long as you dont pig out on max clipping planes. It's true that if you have less than a 32mb Voodoo/GeForce/NVidia card, then frame rates will be compromised. But as I've read many many times, your typical screen lag from places like Swamp of No Hope aka Texture Hell (very classic example here) is because the PC does not have enough RAM to process all the texture graphics.... what ends up happening is that the hard drive has to end up caching those textures momentarily.... and since HD speed is much slower than RAM speed, that's why players will realize the socalled lag. I've just seen many players say they had this problem, and then they went out and doubled their RAM.... and voila, the screenlag probs start to disappear. <br><br>So when Verant says that SoL reeeeeeally &quot;recommends&quot; 512mb of RAM.... they aren't horsing around. They really mean it. Even 256mb is considered just &quot;minimum requirements&quot;.... which translates in English to &quot;you can run the darn thing, but don't expect to be happy about the performance&quot; <br><br>I think that Verant made a miscalculation when they jumped to an expansion that recommends 512mb RAM to play smoothly. That kind of expectation simply caught a lot of players off guard. In fact very few top-of-the-line PC games today ever require that amount of RAM..... altho it might be the norm in the next 12-18 months. <br><br>just my 2pp<br><br><br><br><br><br> <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/umadrain.showPublicProfile?language=EN>madrain</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Kerran Lord</span><br>  Posts: 169<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(1/12/02 9:12:39 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=201.topic&index=13>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: lol you gona hate the answer.</span><hr size=1> Could be other things besides just textures, too.
