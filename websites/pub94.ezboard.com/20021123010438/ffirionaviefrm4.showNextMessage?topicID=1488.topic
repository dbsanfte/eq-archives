<br>
I'll give you an examaple, Lets say theres a Warrior and a necro in a group together. The warrior currently wears full Kael armor with the exception of his arms which are Crafted ... The necro on the other hand wears nothing but cloth, Anyway their fighting in Velks, havin a good time and some Cystal Chitin vambracers drop, who should get them.. the warrior who would replace his rusty old crafted ones with them, or the necro who cant even wear them.<br>
<br>
IMO if any of you said the Warrior, Then I think your greedy and you dont really believe in the nb4g rule, because that Necro surely fuckin needed those arms much more then the warrior, He could have sold them and actully bought some half decent gear which would improve his current status dramatically while the warrior would have only see a minor improvement.<br>
<br>
Also Lets say someone said &quot;Hey dude we could really use a chanter for OS&quot;  And I already had everything I needed from that zone, gear wize... WHY in the world would i want to go there, when I could get more Xp in Velks or some other zone in which i actully needed gear.  Why would anyone chose to go to a zone that offered less XP and no loot over a zone with better XP. <br>
<br>
    And eventually thats whats going to happen, soon enough the majority of people will use the all random rule, or else they simply wont go.  If you dont believe me log onto any older server and see what all the 60's prefer<br>
<br>
Until then, when I join groups I'll accept whatever Loot rules they got going, but I just want to let you all know I think its BS and All Random is the fairest way to go<br>
<br>
(This is only the case in random pickup groups, I firmly believe in nb4g during guild/friend groups and guild raids, because they hand down there gear and will eventually help you when you need it) <br>

Also I disagree on this topic.  Need before greed rules are named wrong.  It really means that the person is going to use the item rather than sell it.  Selling sucks.  When you sell stuff there is a high chance you will lose alot of value before you get something decent back.  AKA, to sell that good item in a decent amount of time you have to discount it 300-500pp less than what everyone else is selling and then buy what you need at Bazaar's jacked prices.  Not to mention the time lost in the friggin bazaar.<br>
<br>
Honestly, I've never thought of it as need until its a warrior in full kael minus sleeves versus a shadowknight in darkforge.  Then there would be no doubt in my mind that the SK needs them.  But the necro holds no raight to the vams in a need before greed situation from my perspective. <p><p><a href=http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=373025>Rubis<BR><img src=http://users.bigpond.net.au/stbt/sigs/rubissig.jpg></p></a></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/udrdemiath.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Dr Demiath</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 18<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(9/30/02 7:41:28 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1477.topic&index=4>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Why Need VS Greed Sucks in pick up groups</span><hr size=1> Raines you need some gear bro?

<br>
From your example i could reverse the rolls could i not and come up with this:<br>
     Robe for Thurgadin quest necro robe drops - the warrior has a crafted breastplate so can he have the robe item to sell for enough cash to buy a breastplate?<br>
     No way, i cant see this scenario ever happening.<br>
<br>
And if the Necro is wearing cloth at lv40 then he should not be so cheep.<br>
<br>
You mean to tell me that not only did the necro never bother to purchase a few pp upgrade for raw silk, he never even bothered to quest his lv30 temple of solusek ro quest items... then he ignores all the droppable upgrades until lv40.... then when he is 45-50 he expects to roll on everything so he can buy items?<br>
<br>
Necromancers are not as equipment driven as warriors, if a necromancer spell droped would you expect that to goto the necromancer? or to the warror to sell? warriors dont have spells... they have armor and wepons, those 'are' there spells and hence they need constant upgrades <p><img src="http://eqsighost.netfirms.com/Braellarth/sig_02.jpg"><br></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/udrdemiath.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Dr Demiath</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 20<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(9/30/02 7:51:11 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1477.topic&index=6>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Why Need VS Greed Sucks in pick up groups</span><hr size=1> Well said Braellar.

<br>
It's not everyone else's fault that you are dead broke and poor, you did that yourself.<br>
<br>
<br>
==========<br>
Aside from that, I do agree... I just find you saying it ludicrous, because quite frankly you are only saying it because it doesnt' benefit YOU.  <br>
<br>
Pickup groups, well nobody really benefits from having the &quot;need&quot; person gain the item, and &quot;need&quot; is a fairly arbitrary term, so usually it's better to do open.  But that's cause I dont trust the folks to tell the truth.  I believe the warrior just switched out the thurgadin arms for crafted, so he could roll on the crystal chitin arms =p<br>

<br>
NBG is an amorphous concept and different people have different ideas what it means.  If we are assuming a relatively efficient economy, an item won by the group should roughly provide the same upgrade potential for each group member.  Random loot rules seem to me to be a very fair way of allocating loot.<br>
<br>
NBG, in pick-up groups, often tends to award the most vocal (in some cases selfish) group members.  I definitely agree that it should be random in pick-up groups.<br>

<br>
If you join a group and don’t ask what the looting rules were, you have no right to be upset with the warrior when he claims the Codpiece of Hammering.<br>
<br>
I asked to join a group once and was invited in.  The looting rules were “everything goes to [Frank].”  The reasons that Frank got to loot everything were many and varied, and they have no real bearing on this thread.<br>
<br>
I agreed.  I didn’t particularly like the rules as I was a bit short of cash, but they were the only group willing to take me and I didn’t relish hiking to another zone or trying to solo.<br>
<br>
Later, another player joined and they explained the loot rules, which caused her to get quite upset.  “Not fair” and “lame” were some of the terms used, as I recall.  The group leader patiently asked if they were going to abide by the rules or not, and when the new arrival refused he wished her luck and booted her out of the group.<br>
<br>
That person later started her own group with drips and drabs that later came into the zone and did all right for herself, I guess.<br>
<br>
So what is my point with this story?  That might makes right?  That you sometimes have to live with lousy looting rules?  That you should suck it up and quit whining?<br>
<br>
Well, ‘yes’ to all of the above.  But the primary thing I’m trying to get across is that for a pick-up group, as long as the rules are known at the outset, you have no right to whine when it actually occurs.  You knew the score.<br>
<br>
If, on the other hand, you DON’T know the loot rules until the rare item in question is lying on the ground… then you still don’t have a lot of leeway to complain, because you were too lazy to ask what the rules were.<br>

<br>
Firstly, no-one understands master looting.  I spell it out, in large letters in /g.  You have FV monks using /autosplit on!  Now, you must be roleplaying a darn stupid monk to be doing such a thing! HELLO!  Monk = keep your weight down.  Well, they may understand as they lose 200ac and die ..... or maybe they have not twigged yet &lt;sigh&gt;.<br>
<br>
Worst is good loot drops.  I've seen ninja, then all sorts of rubbish with attempted loot assignments.  The worst thing I've ever heard of is 'I must be the group leader and assign loot because I am a Paladin'  Reaction = /disband (this was experienced by a guildy).<br>
<br>
My guild operates need before greed.  If an item drops that another class can use, you give to that class, normally holding the item a few days in your bank if someone does not log on.  You get DKP back for upgrading other people and your guild grows stronger as a result.<br>
However, does this apply to pick up groups?  Of course not.  Why?  Well, for example, if I take part in a group in CoM then if a Wus drops I'll want to loot even though I have a Ranger and Druid.  Reason is we have a monk that can use it and if not I can sell it.  Also add to that its a rare drop and probably the best thing in the zone and no .. I will not let a monk in my group autoloot it.<br>
<br>
Also, looting for need leaves casters in trouble.  Most armour or wearable drops are for melee classes.  There is much less caster loot to gain.  As such NBG leaves clerics/chanters and shammies left behind (we'll ignore necros for the moment <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> ). Why should they not enjoy the fruits of their labours and gain some unwearale loot to sell on? <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ubjond.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Bjond</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/white_redspot.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 1016<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(9/30/02 1:26:15 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1477.topic&index=15>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   There is actually more caster loot out there ..</span><hr size=1> .. than there is melee.  Why?  They have all the same slots to fill plus spells.  Saying that one class (yours) gets screwed on loot just shows your own greed or a poor choice of camp spot.  Don't like pickup groups?  Make some friends, join a guild.  Pickup groups in the popular zones suck for the most part.  Go meet people in the hard byog zones.  Those are the fun people.<br>
<br>
Anyway, most of this doesn't apply under 50 unless you have a group of twinks or immigrants that know how to behave over loot.  Lowbies are often extremely gear-hungy, especially around 45 or so.  From 30-45 most make at least one big upgrade a day.  It slows down a ton around 45 and this starts people fighting over gear, since they've recently been conditioned to expect easy gear.<br>
<br>
Anyway, whether you go NBG or not depends a lot on the group.  I will typically avoid groups that I feel can't be trusted to do  basic NBG or that otherwise can't give me what I want.  Usually that's xp, rarely it's loot, and sometimes it's meeting people.  In any of those cases, I'm willing to forgo the secondary reasons for grouping.  It's the groups where the people are fun, the xp is great, and the ML chases you down after you leave to make sure you get your fair share that I like best.  And, yes, they do exist out there even in pickups.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/usyllestraefv.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Syllestrae FV</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Moderating inconsistently<br>since Jun 2002</span><br>  Posts: 1375<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(9/30/02 1:29:58 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1477.topic&index=16>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Why Need VS Greed Sucks in pick up groups</span><hr size=1>    While I think the example Raine used is kind of stupid (cloth wearing necro in Velks), I do agree with his/her point.<br>
<br>
   In <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> pick-up</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> groups (where you jump in with a bunch of people you may or may not know), I think pure /randoms is the fairest way to distribute all loot, whether the winner of the roll can actually wear it or not.  <br>
<br>
   I've known people who march down to Lguk, win an FBSS, put it on their alt, then march right back down there again and claim NBG, and you'd have no way of knowing that they actually had one unless you were with them the first time they won it.<br>
<br>
   In areas with multiple loot drops (like Highpass) it's best to ask everyone to pick the item they want to roll on (Like &quot;Who wants to roll on the PGT, and who wants to roll on the CDS?&quot;).<br>
<br>
   I think NBG works great when grouping with guildmates, or friends, but in plain old pickup groups I really recommend a /random system.  It's fair.  Even if a necro wins the CC arms, and can't actually wear them, he can sell them and buy something he can wear.  That way everyone has an even shot at the loot, and you don't have to worry about someone faking their &quot;need&quot; for an item.<br>

Random coin adds up and /autosplit is NOT fair in the distribution.  The looter ends up with about twice the plat as anyone else.  What typically works for me as a monk is to let a non-puller do all the looting and then if they get overloaded with heavy vendables, I can carry those in a 100%.<br>
<br>
BTW, one thing we used to do way back pre-kunark was instead of randoming off trade items was to sell them and split the proffit.  I was playing a wizard back then, so on break, I'd gate to the good selling zones (no, not gfay, the hunting zones were tons better) sell the stuff, then fly back and split the proceeds.  I haven't seen anyone do that in a long long time, though. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/uxethux.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Xethux</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Tyrannical ruler of the Galaxy</span><br>  Posts: 311<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(9/30/02 2:03:08 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1477.topic&index=20>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: One of the bigest reason for ML ..</span><hr size=1> What you say is true Bjond, but at my level, and with the people I group, the 40-100 pp you might make from cash drops means very little, It's the 100's-1000's we might make from loot drops that is the attraction.<br>
<br>
As I said, I have autosplit on, as it cuts down on how often I must <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> hand off</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> the money I end up with. Before it got bugged, I would simply /split whenever I got too heavy, thus, I was the only one who ended up shorted. But now, since it is often not possible to split more than once per group per zone, I hand the money off to someone else, usually trying to keep it even. I have never recieved any complaints.<br>
<br>
Just one other note, this is not the norm, but an exception for when noone else is willing to master loot.<br>
