<br>
A few times recently I have been heading to C in a dungeon with folks fighting spawns in my way at A.<br>
I have employed a mix of:<br>
1) Talk to them<br>
2) Buff them<br>
3) Assist them<br>
4) Offer to join with them while A is cleared<br>
5) Sat and waited for A to be cleared so there is a window to get to B<br>
6) They allow me to kill the things in the way<br>
<br>
I always do 1 and 2 then usually one or a couple of the others :-)<br>
<br>
Now recently I was in a dungeon, raid game in sat down in my pull path and started to slaughter everything. No message to zone nothing.<br>
I ask someone from the group and get told we are going to kill named X.<br>
<br>
Okay, knowing the way guilds normally go to get to him I move team further in to dungeon and start to hunt.<br>
Monk runs by me and trains me.<br>
I ask why this happened and add please do not train me, get told &quot;we are clearing to get to X will not be long&quot;.<br>
Few minutes later I get trained again by another puller from their guild. This chappy will not even reply to my tell.<br>
<br>
After being trained a few more times (hey so sometimes I am slow) I move to a much crappier place for my team and hunt the few remainnig mobs. Not many mobs remain as they are killing everything in sight<br>
<br>
After a while I say oh well this and go somewhere else :-)<br>
<br>
Now to me the issue is actually not clear. If a group is in the way do they have the right to inconvenience a raid coming through?<br>
<br>
Visa versa does a raid coming though have the right to inconvenience a group hunting by killing everything they where hunting for an hour.<br>
<br>
I find these two issues confusing, the solution though maybe is not to answer that question but in how the inconvenience can me lowered.<br>
<br>
a) Communication both to the zone and to the folks in the way. Apologies, be nice :-), be pro active. Do not wait to talk until you have trained them and they are bitching <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
b) Buff them, you got a raid you can probably do some nice things to a group in your way, this will not inconvenience you the raid too much<br>
c) Perhaps if they are the right lvl offer that they might join you.<br>
d) Pull for them even<br>
<br>
This are just thoughts of course.<br>
<br>
So what do folks think? Is it might is right? If 48 folks come along they have the right to inconvenience say the 12 who where doing exp work?<br>
<br>
This is btw not a rant :-) but a question/discussion with un named examples :-) on issues that are to me confusing <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

As long as you got there first, etc.<br>
<br>
When it comes to pulling named mobs in dungeons you never have the right to pull through another recogized camp to get your mob. You must take the risk of moving past the other camp and pulling to a spot that does not put the other group in danger. <br>
<br>
One example is the KPC Camp in SolB. It is usually possible to hold that camp and pull down to the Nobel too. There are several paths that can be take, but most of them run through other camps. One must pull through the longer and more dangerous path to keep from wiping things off onto other groups. To do otherwise is just plain..um, jerky.<br>
<br>
The guild in your example above should be ashamed of themselves, in my opinion.<br>

<br>
While hunting a given area, I have often seen groups promptly move in right in front of me or to the same area and start pulling mobs.  <br>
<br>
When asked to please respect my presence, I get a mixture of responses.  Sad to say, as often as not, I get a rude remark something to the effect of who the #$^ do I think I am.  They have as much right to be there as I do.  They are correct of course.  They do have as much right to be there as I do.  <br>
<br>
The fact that I have cleared the area so they can safely move in is irrelevant.  The fact that I was there before they got there is also irrelevant.  The only thing lessening their claim to be there is a moral sense of respecting the sensibilities of others and a desire to have other also respect their presence should they happen to establish a presence before someone else arrives.<br>
<br>
Thankfully, I have seen many people on FV who extend this courtesy to their fellow adventurers.  Sadly, it only takes a few inconsiderate people to put a bad taste in everyone's mouth.<br>

It'd be nice if folks had the forthought to work around you're exp camps but usually the raid leaders are trying to get group going, figure out where when what and it's the lastthing on there mind that someone is doing xp. You've lead raid i'm sure before and know that on the list of important things someone is in our way isn't high on the priority list of things to think about.<br>

If they poach the pull, I get more.  Poachers usually end up dying to their own idiocy -- they have to actually attack stuff I pull to draw it off me, so it's not as if they're being trained.

The real problems come in recovery efforts if the trains wiped out groups. Usually a small handful who know what they are doing end up have to clean up everyone's mess, getting trained by the uncooperative the whole time. <p>Finneas MythHunter <br>

This is wierd isnt it? You were there first... but now 24+ people want to disrupt you. Who's right?<br>
<br>
Try thinking about it like this...<br>
<br>
You and your date are enjoying a quiet dinner out. You got a cozy little table in a quiet corner of a restaurant. Then a baseball team comes in and they set them up right next to you. Now its not quite a perfect analogy... the baseball team can't train you and your date with mobs. :P But both groups have the right to be there, no one is right or wrong, even though one group is being bothered.<br>
<br>
This is all about good communication.<br>
<br>
Dont talk to the pullers... they are busy pulling (seriously). They have 24+ people waiting on them. They are not gonna stop just to chat with someone. Ask someone in the zone who the raid leader is and discuss with the raid leader what issues you might have. Hopefully they will be civil, but I would think that whether or not they can move the raid, or you get asked to move will depend entirely on the different situations.<br>
<br>
I suspect that most times you will get an answer like, &quot;We're just passing through&quot;. But other times a mob will just &quot;have&quot; to be moved (thanks Verants buggy pathing/suiciding mobs) and you might be asked to accomodate the folks on the raid.<br>

And i would also say - talk to the raid leader.. or talk to one not pulling to figure out who is teh raid leader. Most cases should be possible to be resoved with a little communication. The one comment saying 'just keep'em coming' - thats the typical example of miscommunication, and will most likely lead to one of three things.<br>
A) Your group dies cos they dont take what you bring<br>
B)  They stay longer, cos they need to slow their approach due to your pulls<br>
C) Some or all of them die - which also extends their stay.<br>

<br>
Communication is the key.  Since everyone knows the situation from the &quot;I'm camped, a raid moves through&quot; side, I'll give the good and bad experiences I've had the other way.<br>
<br>
In both cases I was the puller, and in both cases the good/bad result was on me. First off, that's bull that the puller is too busy to talk. As the puller, you are the first, or one of the first in the area, you should know if someone is camping in your way. Sure the raid is pushing you to pull, but common courtesy requires that you not pull over an existing camp. Tell the camp what's up, let them know at some point you'll be moving through. find out how much of your path they've already cleared out. Ideally, you can time moving by them when they're pulling the max range mobs, you simply move by them and let them take the respawns behind you.<br>
<br>
Sometimes it's more complicated, say a group that can barely handle the spawn cycle immediately in front of them, but is unwilling to cooperate with you moving by. Rare occurance, but has happened. or your path may diverge from what their pulling, but to clear it you must cross pull mobs that will aggro. You try to time it well, but things happen. (this is what happened when I screwed up. Raiding party gave rezzes and I apologized, but there were still bad feelings &lt;shrug&gt;)<br>
<br>
In my experience, communication and consideration from both sides is all that's required. But the party moving through should initiate the conversation, the group camping should never have to say, &quot;WTF, can't you see I'm camping here&quot;, and I've seen that happen far too often.  And &quot;We're just moving through&quot; is not an acceptable answer try to work with the people already there.<br>
<br>
Don't talk to the raid leader, the raid leader has a thousand little details (s)he is trying to organize, and it's possible will not even notice your conversation in the deluge of spam on the monitor. Talk to someone who is obviously not doing something, find out who is helping the raid leader, and talk to them, they probably have the authority to straighten things out, and the raid leader's ear if there is a big issue.<br>
