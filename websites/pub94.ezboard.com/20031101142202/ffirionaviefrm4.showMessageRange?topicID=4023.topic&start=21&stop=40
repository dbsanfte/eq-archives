That is to say we do not use DKP. Everyone who receives gear does so with the agreement that it remains guild property. This may not be the right system for everyone, but it works for Trib. FnF, Reso and several other uber guilds are littered with Trib gear and the officers got tired of it. Guild awards are one way to combat that to a small degree. It has worked well as new awards often lead to hand downs for others. All this is to say that Kindredwolf took the item with that as his agreement. He now has stolen property. If it were DKP or NBG that would be one thing, but it is not the system under which he obtained the item and he is wrong.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Hmm.... so your telling me, if you hit the eject button on Trib, you'd return all your gear that was &quot;issued&quot; to you....<br>
<br>
&quot;Issued&quot; is such a touchy word...<br>
<br>
Issued normally means it came from a gulid supply.. From the way this sounds... the person went on the raid and earned the item by assisting in the battle, its not like they went to the Tribulation yard sale and picked and chose....<br>
<br>
So, if he acquired his epic parts, or epic via a guild raid, you going to ask him to give them back, or delete it since he doesn't &quot;own&quot; it...<br>
<br>
Give me a break...<br>
<br>
...and I highly doubt that Reso and FnF is littered with uber gear from Trib.... being I know at least one person who left Trib for FnF, and his gear was far from &quot;uber&quot; before he got there...<br>
<br>
but bottom line...<br>
<br>
I could understand that rule if the gear was in the bank before they arrived, and they took it under those circumstances...<br>
<br>
but... he didn't...<br>
<br>
And if Tribulation ever broke up, who's gonna get the gear then....?  Sounds like one of those things... keep in in the guild, then if we break up, we got a stockpile to sell to the general public for our own benefit...<br>
<br>
calling bullshit...<br>

I am but posting what all have said to me since after I deguilded. Many feel you are an officer because your husband is. I flammed Tribulation here, because I was banned from even the visitors section, and to me that was the last straw. Now I am called a theif for not giving up the end result of a quest, when an Item for the whole quest was given to me. Now if Tribe supplied all parts and got me though skyshrine for Turn in, then yes I would have returned it, like I did the Gem of Courage, as all items for it came from the guild bank. All I did was go to the GF spires and turn them in. I am sorry you took it as a flame on you from me. I was but posting the way the leadership of Tribulation is seen by those who are not kissing the leaderships arse. <p><!--EZCODE HR START--><hr /><!--EZCODE HR END--><br>

<br>
I'm not terribly fond of Tribulation--the only time I hunted with them I was invited, died on the first pull, and then the group broke up.  And I never really got a reason that I was satisfied with--the whole 'main healer as puller' may work well with group members you're used to working well with, but well, I'd never met any of these people.  If they did, they'd known I don't pay for buffs.  Put two and two together.<br>
<br>
At least they rezzed me for my trouble.<br>
<br>
As far as complaints went, I filed a formal complaint through the member who had invited me.  Since I really didn't lose all that much time, I figured, &quot;what the hell&quot; and left it at that.  Never cared to follow up.  I remain wary but I really don't care much either way.<br>
<br>
Then I joined places that had strict no-lightbringer policies, and it was moot.<br>
<br>
End background<br>
<br>
THAT BEING SAID.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>Well an officers wife won, big surprise. And Slivern won. Slivern in all honesty deserves it. Now Skylias, though I love her to death, in the minds of the masses did not. Well this did not give representation to the late night members that we sought, and many of us left.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Wait a minute.  Slivern won.  Slivern deserves it.<br>
<br>
But Skylias didn't win by popular vote, so those upset with the outcome left because she was the favorite of the late-nighters.<br>
<br>
I don't know if I'm getting this right, but if I am, that sounds like a severe case of fair-weather friendship to me.<br>
<br>
That and honestly, the helmet issue doesn't seem to be clear as crystal.<br>
<br>
Slight Digression:<br>
<br>
Alnan used to kill sentient armors because he liked the challenge.  The XP is terrible but he's ROLLING in every quest gem except flawless diamonds.<br>
<br>
I don't see most gems in bazaar for 333+ platinum each, which is what it would take to get them for over 1K.  But perhaps I'm looking at the cheap gem vendors which are playing when you're online.<br>
<br>
Digression over<br>
<br>
IMO I would have held out for a better deal--it seems to me you spent 1K in order to get the gems NOW.  I don't think, and I have absolutely no idea but this is a hunch, that probably there aren't a lot of other shadowknights in Tribulation, so that if you did give the helm back it would be (mostly) USELESS to them.<br>
<br>
So you instead make the helmet yours, so that you can claim &quot;well I'm gonna get another helm and give you that.&quot;<br>
<br>
I was an officer once, of League of Shadows.  If a situation like this had ever come up, and I WAS a Quartermaster in charge of handling loot...<br>
<br>
I would have basically said &quot;I don't expect you to give me that helmet.  Ever.&quot;<br>
<br>
Whether you will or not, the fact that you converted it AFTER you left says something that really mars your arguement.<br>

I don't know how other guilds operate, but my officers all have &quot;jobs&quot;. i.e. they are expected to put quite a bit of RL work into their responsibilities, whether it be planning raids, publishing the guild bank, recruitment or loot policy administration.<br>
<br>
It is not a power thing, these are people who are prepared to go the extra mile and take care of a PITA admin task that makes the game more fun for the rest of the guild. Guild officership isn't about status, or isn't where I come from anyway.<br>
<br>
Secondly, as a GL, I would never put officership up for vote. I am always going to pick people based on their willingness and ability to do a job, and more importantly they will be people <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>I</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> trust. At the end of the day, I am going to be delegating stuff to these people, and I will have to deal with the mess if they make a bad call or do a shitty job. If I am going to be responsible for what they do, you can be damn sure I am going to hand pick those people myself.<br>
<br>
Voting in guilds is the debil. It encourages people to take opposing sides in which there will be a losing side and a resulting bad taste in their mouths. It encourages cliques and block voting. GLs should sit back consider the situation, make their best judgement call that they can, stick to it, and the guild should support them in it. Of course you really have to trust your GL to do the right thing. And you have to forgive them mistakes sometimes too. You can't please all of the people all of the time. <p><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=280145" target="top">Patrician</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--><br>

You know at least one member of Trib: me. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  Sky and Slivy won by votes. And Sky's &quot;husband&quot; ingame, since we're doing this all ooc, had nothing to do with that. She has shown loyalty and dedication as a member, and people remembered that when they voted. Kindredwolf had very little chance of being elected to an officer position because he had recently posted that he was considering leaving the guild then changed his mind. I know that I myself and a few others were wary of helping him at all after that. All the flowery phrases of how much he loved Trib and all his friends in the guild wasn't going to instantly make everyone forget that a couple weeks before he had posted that he was leaving. All his constant talk in character about honor, and it comes to this. <br>
<br>
The fact is that we are not a late night guild and we have very few late night players. He left after not being elected. We have a specific loot award system in place designed to help our members. It's in the guild rules and if you don't agree to them, don't raid. <br>
<br>
Personally, I don't care if we ever get the helm back. It just proves we voted wisely. <br>
<br>
And, Antoin, I'm sad you had such a bad experience with a group. You're a blast to play with and I learned a bit about game mechanics when fighting with you.<br>

   Many Winds has known Kindred for quite a long time. I've never questioned his honor. He has aided us countless times.

I'm a non-gater (Paladin). I've run from PoK to Skyshrine and back more times than I care count. If you're of a level to be doing the SS armor quests, the run there is really no big deal. Sure it's five zonings away, but it's not like it's the Freeport-Qeynos run of old. And getting out is faster than getting in. <br>
<br>
I blame PoK portals for making people lazy. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :\ --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/ohwell.gif ALT=":\"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

If you don't feel like running back, carry a Thurg potion. The parts are easily farmed and the vendor sold parts only cost a few gp.

Why, when she's got me? *big grin*<br>
<br>
<br>
I know Kindredwolf. He's a friend and I like him and he seems honest and trustworthy. I don't understand that whole policy of having to give up an item I earned on raid after leaving -- so I'm glad TS doesn't have that policy because its stupid. If I work hard on a raid, and something I need comes up, and we roll on it or they award it to me or whatever, its mine, end of story. I think there's been only one or two items where I've seen them say -- please give this back if you leave, and it was a quested item -- that an individual had gotten most of the pieces for on their own time, and donated to the guild so that one of our guildies could have it. <br>
<br>
If Kindred says he'll get the original piece for the guild that he was given -- I say, why not give him time to get it? Is there a pressing need to 'have it right away'? I don't see one. I don't think he should have to give the end product because he put in time, money and effort to complete it. And the end product isn't what he was 'given' anyhow.<br>
<br>
As for quested gems: When I bought my leather bracer for Rowyl's bracer of nature from the bazaar, I had one crushed opal on me which I'd been saving for this, I bought one, for 300 pp, and my friend Binmera gave me another she had gotten in Velks. -- I got lucky. But if someone had been selling all 3 gems for 300 a piece, I'd of had to pay 900 pp.<br>
<br>
So you know, just whatever. Tribulation needs to have paitence. Give Kindredwolf time to return the original piece. I'm sure he will as soon as he can.<br>
<br>
But you know, I'm not sure what you meant by the fact that officer awarded loot leads to guild handme-downs, because I can tell you that: If I am being given an upgrade that I cannot keep when I leave the guild, I sure as hell am not handing down what I replaced to another guildie especially If I earned it outside of the guild. So, I get an item that I get screwed out of if I leave, and I don't get any compensation for the item I gave away?  Um, ok.<br>

Kindred you did what I could/did not. I had a problem with ONE person who happened to also be an officer in Trib. and I think everyone in Trib knows who that person was. Now I tried for about 2 to 3 WEEKS to try and ignore the problem but when we were assigned to the same group in a raid, for example, that he wouldnt communicate to me at all. That was the last straw for me. Now I consitered Trib as my family and as such I did not want to raise a fuss when I announced I was going to reroll. I left without going into details about why I was doing it. I just felt I had to let them know I was leaving and I was not going to be returning. There is a part of me that regrets not saying anything because there are some issues that should be addressed in the guild, but its not my place to adress them. As far Kindred getting kicked off the Trib visitors board...well then I think that you pretty much asked for this...its hard to take care of private matters then you cant post on a private form. Also the fact that Kindred offered to replace the helm shows what kind of person he is. Now I have known Kindred In game for a long time and I have had several conversations with him in RL both through phone and email so I have a pretty good idea how he acts and thinks. And I do NOT think him to be a theif as long as he does in fact return what was loaned to him. Not saying that is always the case, but I whole heartedly agree with him and I will stand beside him. Tribulation will never be my enemy just for the simple fact many of my friends are still members, however, (and this pains me to say this) I will not recomend new friends join them. All the former members I have talked to myself have said that most of the problems in trib all boil down to one person, this is also the same person that drove me to not only leave but reroll and I was literally in tears when I sacrificed my druid (59 with 18 AAs and epiced) because I put so much time and work into him to have one A$$hole ruin it for me. At least now I have a new character that I can RP with and have fun with and I now have a new family. But a part of me is still crushed that I was forced to start this new life. Ok...I have said my peace and although I have STILL not stated the name of the person out of respect for Trib. I just offer the advice to look further into it and trust your gut and not be manipulated. <p><!--EZCODE CENTER START--><div style="text-align:center"><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://home.earthlink.net/~sopersix/Kenludar.jpg"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--></div><!--EZCODE CENTER END--><br>

I do not know how you did what you did.<br>

To actually sacrifice your druid of 59 levels, 18 aa's and an epic and it being a character you loved.<br>
<br>
I couldn't do that. I dunno if I could ever delete Syluran. I would cry for days. I would rather just cancel the account so that she stays there forever, and buy a new game account to start a new character..<br>
Because I know someday, I'd probably change my mind.<br>

<br>
Honestly that is like asking someone to give back their epic if it were possible, just because the guild helped acquire one of the rarer pieces.<br>
<br>
Kindredwolf has been nothing but a kind and good hearted guy in any encounter with him, he doesn't deserve to be called a thief or anything of the sort. <p><br>

And yes running to Sky Shrine is easy, the getting to the maze, and through it , to the quest giver, and getting out of the skyshrine once you step on the portal at end of maze to go to quest giver, is like jumping off the ledge in the Hole....You are not getting out with gate or port. I carry gate potions on me, but they are very expensive as well.....Tribulation did not aid in the aquirring of the gems, getting through the maze, doing the quest, and paying for the gate potion. I was on a raid to ToV and a helm dropped and I was the only one who could benifit by doing the quest. So I got it, did the quest, and gave my Blazing Helm of Fennin Ro to a guildie when I finnished the quest. <br>
<br>
Could a moderator please lock this thread. I am done with it, and Tribulation needs no more flamming. This subject has been beaten and the horse is already dead. I have been placing WTB unadorned Plate Helm tells into market, and will buy it if need be to return it to Tribulation. I gave my word that I will and frankly I care not if I am thought of as a thief. Those who know me, know I am not and I am a man of my word. That is all that matters to me. I do not play for everyone to like me, I play for fun and to chat with friends. My main reason for leaving Tribe, was I was not having fun. I have had more fun in my new guild in the past 2 weeks than I had in the past 4 months in Tribe. <p><!--EZCODE HR START--><hr /><!--EZCODE HR END--><br>

We kill Something Big (oh, I dunno, Gorenaire? Xanamech? Whatever...) and there drops Something Good.<br>
<br>
The raid leading person, and pretty much everyone else, has a clear idea of what is for int casters, what is for wis casters, what is for hybrids, and what is for melees. Only the subgroups likely to gain from using the item will be rolling.<br>
<br>
That's right, we just go and random it. And guess what, the one with the highest roll gets to KEEP the item forever! Or untill they sell it.<br>
<br>
All this talk of handing someone something and telling them it's not theirs sounds way too much like 'buying' a product from the software industry.... not like playing a game and having fun.<br>
