<br>
#$%^ the user, let's get that new expansion out...we need the cash.<br>
<br>
Point 1. It crashes, one moment yer in norath, the next yer looking at wall paper, no errors at all..it'sa big $%^&amp;ing bug, and it's still there..FIX IT.<br>
<br>
Point 2. My eyes are not as good as they used to be, I like to use chatfontsize 4 (since 5 looks the same, I settle for 4), but the chatfontsize 4 in the new UI is smaller, the 5 is bigger AND FATTER, which is still not the same as the old 4, and chatfontsize 6 (yeah, it exists, even though it says 0-5) is just bloody silly. Again..@#$% the user.<br>
<br>
Point 3. After 3 years, when I see the boot, I know that is my sow icon...would it have fucking killed them to use the same icons? I guess so. a waste of someones creative time..and my money! Skin like nature, a shield with a leaf would have made sense, instead, we get a shield with a $%^&amp;ing popcorn string on it...and everytime I look at my healing icon, I do not see a heart, i see what looks like spiderman looking through a hole...what was wrong with a BIG RED CROSS? naw..that would make $%^&amp;ing sense.<br>
<br>
point 4. Why oh why must the bloody things fade in and out? It's the one thing I hate the most, I want to see my spell casting icons WITHOUT the background..but I have no option to do that...FIX IT!<br>
<br>
Point 5. Do we really need to have &quot;hot buttons&quot; and &quot;target&quot; and &quot;group&quot; and &quot;effects&quot; over these boxes? I know what they are, I've known what they were from about 4 hours after i first started playing EQ 3 $%^&amp;ing years ago.<br>
<br>
Point 6 Why is there extra &quot;frills&quot; around the boxes? I liked the &quot;black outline&quot; look of the older UI, not the original ui..that was terrible..oh wait..now it looks just like AC2!<br>
<br>
Point 7 Again..chatfontsize. If I change it to 4...why must you still force me to squint as I type in chatfontsize 0 in the &quot;text entry&quot; box? what are you..sadists?<br>
<br>
Point 8. Boy..lots o points eh! The bazaar...what a wonderful idea, I think it's great, my biggest problem? I have to change my res down to 640x480 just so i can see what the $%^&amp; other people are selling...again..make it so that we can change the damn font size..is that too much to ask for?<br>
<br>
Point 9. I had this complaint about the old ui too. would it be too much to ask to be able to change the fontsize of the tracking window? When i'm asked what's up..it takes me forever to read the teeny tiny text in that window...<br>
<br>
Point 10. why do you lop the bottoms off &quot;y&quot;'s and &quot;q&quot;'s and &quot;g&quot;'s in the chat window? Doesn't anyone do any bug testing and tweaking of their code before it's pushed out the door in an acknowledged beta..oh wait..i've just answered my own question...DUH!<br>
<br>
Point 11. Okay, I managed to turn off the compass..how the $%^&amp; do I turn it back on? would have been a GOOD IDEA to put it in the WINDOW SELECTOR...don't you think? I really hate having to /petition for my own stupidity.<br>
<br>
point 12. How the $%^&amp; do I select a different language. I've been stuck in human (luckily) for weeks now...really hard to help those low lvl Gnomes nowadays, since they don't speak human all that well. Maybe it's just a magic key combo i'm missing.. It's not alt-cntl-del, that much I do know.<br>
<br>
Point 13. Mac OS and windows use the same convention for windows, top left is close, top right is min/max window..why do you $%^&amp;ers have to be different? why don't you really $%^&amp; with my head and swap the $%^&amp;ing mouse buttons while yer at it!<br>
<br>
Point 14 It's bad enough that you foisted a half finished BETA on us, but you $%^&amp;ed the one that was working just fine.<br>
Maybe you $%^&amp;ers like having a BIG POINTER in the middle of your screen, I DON&quot;T!   fix this, it wasn't broken, but now it is, having to &quot;F10 -  option -screen same res &quot; twice everytime I log on is getting to be a joke...This was acceptable 4 years ago in BETA, it's not acceptable now!<br>
<br>
Point 15 Yer not fooling anyone, the view of yourself in F10 is gone..WHY? It's not like it's working in the new UI either..FIX one or the other..Or both..but FIX IT SOON! I like looking at my new gear when I put it on.<br>
<br>
Point 16 Was it too much work to make the spell book have the same amount of slots in the new book as the old book?<br>
I had all my spells nicely organized..took my over 50 lvls to do so, now it's all over the place. I'm anal..<br>
<br>
Point 17. Why not right one of those many wrongs that people have been suggesting to you for years...ring/circle/portal/gate to the dreadlands makes sense...COMBINES does not. it's the only odd man out..$%^&amp;ing change it already! (nothing to do with the new UI you say?) ever meant to port a group to deadlands..but ported them to wakening lands instead...and wooshi was up at the time...I used to have wakening lands in a certain spot in my book, so that I would never use it..books all jumbled with the new ui, and I was trying to get to a friend with coffins so that he could summon corpses from the depths of a dungeon..made for an interesting night, but that's a whole other story.<br>
<br>
Okay, that's my rant...discuss<br>

Perhaps you should upgrade your system, have the latest drivers, and generally make sure your system is peak.  96% of all people that have this problem are the ones too lazy to watch where they are slamming their fingers, and hit the windows key instead of the spacebar.  The other 4% have substandard Made-in-a-third-world-country-sweatshop crackerjack computers and don't even know what a driver update is.<br>

1.  This game wasn't designed for your specific pleasure.<br>
2.  Not everyone has a 6500 IQ like you, they didn't assimilate complete mastery over the game simply by logging in.<br>

Okay, forget Point #2 as obviously that isn't enough.   My suggestion is this:  You should petition Verant to include a free seeing eye dog with every Trilogy purchase, to assist you in translating the so-hard-to-read text of this game.   Or better yet, you could have them develop braile technology for plasma flatscreens, and include one with every subscription!  Cause you know, its their top priority and everything.<br>

<br>
Try expanding your chatwindow up 5 microns so that it isn't chopping off the text, Mister Happypants.   Oh wait, that must be a bug.   They should have sunk more dev time and testing to make sure the default chat window size in any resolution is exactly tall enough to not chop off the bottom 2 pixels of the letter Y.  HOW COULD THEY HAVE MISSED IT?!!!<br>

Do you need a damn &quot;EQ for Dummies&quot; manual?   Maybe you need one of those gigantic wall-sized color coded poster instruction things like they put in with new computers now?  At least you aren't in denial, that is the first step to recovery.<br>

I really agree on the /language bug.  It says it switches your tongue, but it doesn't.  Anything that forces you to use a mouse is inherently broken.  Mice are for fumble fingered clutzes that can't type faster than 60 wpm.<br>
<br>
You can configure things to never fade.  It's tedious, but you can do it.  AND, to top it all off, if you truly want the old UI, you can still use it.  If you want old UI look and feel with the bazaar, you can download the old-UI skin.  It pretty much makes the new UI look identical to the old one, including all the spell icons.  IMHO, VI should have provided this as the default rather than have a customer develop it, though. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/utzarothfv.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Tzaroth FV</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 526<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(9/21/02 3:02:23 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1433.topic&index=10>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Well</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> Eh, most of them are valid points ..<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>

Not really.

It's poor engineering design, too.  It breaks the 80/20 rule: you don't design something for the 20% case, you build it for the 80% case.  Since the label only matters to perhaps 0.001% of the people out there and only matters for at most a few seconds when playing for the very first time, it's a waste of space.<br>

No, the issue really is that most of them aren't really bugs, they're just poor UI design.  Most fall into the category of changes that don't deliver any new functionality; it's just change for the sake of change.  He's gone balistic over trivia.

<br>
Almost everything else in that list can be worked around by modifying the UI files, though. If you can't figure out how to do it yourself, there are plenty of canned mods available for download online. You can remove the title bars. You can make windows transparent (I mean transparent background, not alpha fade which fades everything including, say, spell icons which sucks). You can change your spell icons, hell on my screen I actually have the names of the buffs listed next to them so I don't have to right-click to see what they are. Pretty sure you can change the number of spells per page in your book too. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/uyiar01.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Yiar01</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 16<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(9/21/02 4:03:33 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1433.topic&index=14>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: ROFL</span><hr size=1> I love the point about Combine Gate/Portal/Circle/Translocate<br>

OK please!!!  Thats just downright anal.  First off, I'm hoping that your a druid, if not, I think its time for me to just hang up my robe if your a wizard and have no f'ing clue as to why its called combine portal.  Sure, I used to get confused between west gate (wk) and common gate (wc) but these thing you learn.<br>
<br>
Do you know the difference between Markars and Tishan's reolcations?!?  They have no bearing on EJ or Skyfire, or winds of the north/winds of the south for duids(respectively, unsure about order on druid evacs) as far as name goes.  Have you never noticed the MASSIVE COMBINE CITY that just happens to be closer to the portals than the cave to the dreadlands.  VI didnt just pick some random name when they made that spell (well maybe they did with the evacs), they actually used a bit of creativity back then.<br>
<br>
Learn a bit of the lore behind the game... its actually interesting.<br>
<br>
All your other points... well, most of them are crap, and if you want the old ui without any major work (sacrificing the bazaar function) just delete your EQclient.ini file and you'll get the old UI back, or surf through there and find newui = TRUE and change it to false.... and dont forget to f'ing save!!!!!<br>

Most of your points are really minor quibbles considering what a <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> huge</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> upgrade this is for us over the old UI.  It still is broken in some respects, but overall it's still worth using, so what's your complaint?  If you don't like it, don't use it.<br>
<br>
Anyway, the only real problems I have with the new UI is the fact that you can't switch languages with the /language command, the fact that sometimes I lose mouse or keyboard function after I camp, and the fact that you can't set a default channel for socials anymore via your chat box, so you have to manually change socials to put a /g or /channel# in front of all the text.<br>

That's not true. Go to the spellbar file and set <br>

<br>
(with the HTML brackets around the Style_transparent tags, stupid EZboard won't let me display them)<br>

<br>
The pointer thing HAS been around since the start of EQ, you've just been lucky enough not to see it. I get it on my Voodoo3 but not my GeForce3 (although I did for a while; it disappeared a few patches ago). The latest drivers are most definitely not always the best. (I couldn't get anything but 21.85 to work with my GeForce2.) Try some older drivers and see if they work better for you. Just make sure you completely uninstall your existing drivers first. You can get Detonator Destroyer to do that.<br>
<br>
I didn't even know you could doubleclick the top left icon to close a window. I dunno, I guess the nice clear X in the upper right next to the other icons was intuitive enough for me. Learn something new every day.<br>
