This post might end up sounding sarcastic at times, but it really isn't meant to be.  After reading a couple of posts recently, and considering them in combination, I have come to understand far better the pressures faced by raiding guilds striving for end-game content, and I have come to believe that they have been indirectly shafted by some really bad design in EQ.<br>
<br>
First, I was thinking about that thread about Resolution with bad karma in the title or something.  The point was that guests on a Reso raid were asked to leave once members showed up to clear room on the 72-person raid, which would end up being who got flagged for the PoP kill.  That was an eye-opener for me.  I always knew raids got big in the end, but Resolution needing to *fill* the 72-person roster?  Wow.  I'm not a complete noob or anything, and I've been on and led some fair-sized planar raids.  But I guess always figured that even though huge raids do happen, skilled and well-equiped raiders can still raid in 30-40 person groups and continue to progress that way, even if they move in smaller steps than a gigantic raid force. Looks like I was wrong.<br>
<br>
Second, I was reading that thread about F&amp;F where they were being accused of backing down from their stance on Ebayers in order to grow.  The idea being that they now either need to grow or die.  I don't have a clue if that last part is at all true and I'm going to omit my feelings about the first part.  The point is, in light of the first revelation about what kind of raid force it takes to approach the end game, I can begin to understand how and why a raiding guild would end up compromising on just about any standard when faced with that obstacle.  And that sucks.<br>
<br>
I did some quick math.  I figure that a well-organized, seriously hardcore raiding guild might manage to field a 72-character raid force with a roster of about 80 players, assuming a fair number of them are duo-boxing (or more) and there are very few vacations from EQ in there and they all manage to play at very regular times.  A less-organized, serious raiding guild might need as many as 120 players in its roster to field a 72-character force regularly, especially if it includes players who aren't willing to raid 6-7 nights a week.  Am I in the right ballpark there folks?  I really don't know, but for now I'm proceeding on the assumption that to continue progressing and advancing steadily a serious raiding guild needs about 80-120 people on its roster.<br>
<br>
All I can say to that is Holy Shit!  Even if I've over-estimated and it's more like 60-90, still, Holy Shit!<br>
<br>
We like to talk about how different priorities can co-exist in the same guild, and how a guild might roleplay and still raid, or raid and still roleplay, etc.  But all I can think of is that one of the things I value most about a guild is when I can say I am honestly proud to be associated with everyone else who wears that tag.  Not just in terms of their raiding skill, but in all aspects of their personalities.  If I can't say that I just won't wear the guild tag.  And now I thinking about raiding guilds....  This isn't meant to imply that raiders are any less worthy than anyone else, but I can't imagine *any* group of 80-120 (or even 60-90) people I'd care to associate myself with that way.  When was the last time you can remember going out to the movies with 80 of your closest friends?  It just isn't part of human nature to be at all close to that many people at a time.<br>
<br>
So it seems to me raiding guilds end up in a situation where they are reduced to considering one and only one thing when it comes to recruiting new members, and that's raiding ability.  With perhaps a secondary emphesis on making sure the person they add to the guild isn't such a total tool as to offend the rest of the guild and mess up doing anything co-operatively.  And again, that's sad.<br>
<br>
I think EQ is moving in the right direction with the LDoN expansion, and even though we think they are moving in a new direction there I would claim, rather, they are exploring on a micro level what they have already done on a macro level with PoP.  They *did* effectively limit the effective encounter force for a lot of PoP, just they limited it so high (72) we tend not to notice.  But it is at least limited.  Otherwise we might be seeing raid forces over 100 strong.<br>
<br>
I remember when F&amp;F had a distinctive flavour on FV.  I remember when Resolution had the same.  Now I can't even tell them apart, in membership, attitude, or philosophy.  I'm sorry to anyone who has a serious grudge and resents being compared to the opposing camp, but I really can't tell the difference.  I just can't.  And I wonder what it might be like if raiding encounters were similarly limited to, say, 36 characters.  Maybe then these top end guilds wouldn't be forced to grow or die.  Maybe then they might retain a tight core of people who worked together and shared some ideals and ideas beyond just getting to end-game content.  Maybe....  I don't know.  I just wanted to point this all out.<br>
<br>
Limiting the number of people who can attempt any one thing together at once is good for the game.  At every level.  It gives us more ability to choose who we are going to associate with without the massive pressure of raising a huge force when needed.  I'm sure I'll have people disagree, but that's the way I see it.  I respect what the end-game raiders are doing, and where they are taking their own quests, but I'm sorry for what they've had to give up along the way.  And I wish they didn't have to.<br>
<br>
Take care,<br>

<br>
look at it this way. faf was on a different step from reso tier 3 vs 4<br>
<br>
so you really think reso is going to gear up tons of people then have them ditch out because they want to see eplanes and take the easy way with someone already there? well now they they are there, they did it a different way, sure it still takes skill, but honestly do you think they fully vt / ssra ect geared every new app while doing this the past 1-2 months? i doubt it. gearing up that many people is going to take a bit longer and just slows the progression. <br>
<br>
so they filled a raid. accomplished what they wanted and now your like  <br>

hmmm... sounds like your trying to say something. and the topic well its pretty clear. but maybe you should think and look at the situation next time. i know if i were a guild leader I wouldn't want people ditching my guild and moving to another just because i cant give them what in the end they all want, progression. but im not a guild leader or raid leader so doesn't matter.... <br>

im sure the 72 people that were there are happy in eplanes. they sure aren't complaining. <p>Lothor</p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showUserPublicProfile?gid=taldaydarfv>Taldaydar FV</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>/join cyberwithtald</span><br>  Posts: 1017<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(9/3/03 12:54 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3968.topic&index=2>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: You know, I feel bad for the raiding guilds</span><hr size=1> Well Valquiss had a very nice post there....<br>

I personally think your numbers are probably a bit low, I would guess the hardcore guilds (reso/fnf) would need around 100 people (ie 130ish char roster including bots), while the less hardcore guilds (AD) would probably need around 130 people (ie 160ish roster) to get through to the final plane.<br>
<br>
Not sure if I should really talk about our roster size verse raid size.... perhaps I will let Bjond elaberate on that... but generally in my opinion even in a raiding guild your effective raid force is a fair chunk below the potential you have from your roster (could be that I have always been in optional raiding guilds).<br>
<br>
Lothor... I have no idea what you are going on about there.... perhaps I missed some subtle insult Valquiss made.... but it kinda looks like you went into agro mode for no reason there<br>

Isn't it more like working for a larger corporation as opposed to a small business? If you want a particular kind of working lifestyle you might join a small friendly company and get to know all your colleagues well. If you take a job with a large company you will get other kinds of benefits, and hopefully will agree with the overall corporate culture, but you won't be close to every single one of the other employees. <p><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://www.studioeternity.com/EverquestFV/Viala02.gif"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--><br>

I think if raiding encounters were limited to a more reasonable, but still big 48 people or so, you'd see the quality of the guilds go up, peoples enjoyment of the game go up, and just a general improvement in the game. If guilds didn't have to compromise their membership requirments to grow, everyone would be better off IMHO. That and getting and running  a guild of 100+ really requires more time to run then is healthy to dump into a game. I spend too much time as it is as an officer of my guild. <p>Delandril Ravenclaw<br>

<br>
thus it's usually pretty difficult to do with anything at that point in the game less than close to full raid size (72 people). and to achieve that you obviously need a far bigger guild roster than that to make up for casual players, people who can't make it, etc. granted its a GREAT feeling when you finally do conquer something as difficult as that, and at times its actually kinda fun to watch such a huge force get stuff done, and i'm sure that in time it will require less and less people to accomplish, but it can be a pain in the arse to get that amount of people around, not to mention get them all geared up and ready to go. i am semi-glad that LDoN is lowering raid size, i would prefer to see well thought out, fun encounters with lower raid sizes, but a change like that has its own problems which i'd rather not bring up here <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :p --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":p"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
in terms of the whole closeness thing, i personally know most of my guildies pretty well, and we field quite a large raid force at times, so i do believe it is possible to have large raids and still be pretty tight-knit. i do agree with delandril, though, that smaller raid sizes would probably help foster better guilds and happier players.  <p>Veteran Norok Zek<br>

<br>
To me, this is what is more wrong with the &quot;end-game&quot; content.  There is a focus on a few classes but not opportunities for all of them, so a raid (and by extension raiding guild) is forced to be exclusionary, to exclude those who might want to participate.  On other servers that might not be as much of an issue because each player will generally have multiple characters on his/her account all close to the same level so they can just change to one that is needed mechanics-wise.  Mechanics is the god we really are trying to slay.<br>
<br>
Mechanics.... that's what has made the game 55+ a lot less fun for me.  Even the more RP oriented guilds and associations end up bowing to the &quot;god&quot; of mechanics once it gets 60+.  The amount of grinding (which is boring) one has to do to &quot;measure up&quot; is daunting and when the RP is gone or diminished, it jsut isn't worth it to me.  <br>
<br>
Heck...  I can even see why a raiding guild would not only accept but even desire ebayed characters because the player behind them handling the mechanics is what they are looking for and mechanics is all that one is buying with a &quot;toon&quot;.  I can also understand, on a mechanics level, why raiding guilds would even buy &quot;toons&quot; themselves to be botted or played by a member of the guild.  I can understand the mechanics reasons.<br>
<br>
Mechanics are what seperate and exclude in this game.  People have to work very hard not to let the mechanics overrule everything else... and it jsut doesn't work at some point. <p><center><table width="55%"><tr><td align="center">

I found raiding to be challenging and very satisfying. Kudo's to the raid leaders who get these circuses all to the right spot and generally aimed at the right monster.<br>
<br>
I like the idea of a mix of smaller group challenges and the massive OMG we need a f*cking army to take that down. Both have their appeal and both have their pit falls but I would rather have both than just one or the other.<br>
<br>
On RP and raids, I think it is a wonderful time for opposing sides to interact while trying to achieve a common goal. It makes for the kind of story I would want to read. They fight with vigor against one another, they unite against the worse enemy, vanquish the monster(s) and then return to trying to kill each other again with hate and admiration of a worthy foe.<br>
<br>
Just my take on it and the possibilities it presents.<br>

<br>
The problem with limiting enocounter size though, is exclusion, again.<br>
How about if FnF, with 55 actives according to Xoraxis' last post, has a turn out of say, 50, but encounter size is limited to 48? Who sits on the bench? and why would they stay?

<br>
But in FV due to low population we have only 2 'big' guilds, and that nearly guarantees they will be confronted. In other servers, with 4-5 high end guilds, it may be more natural to form such alliances of 2-3 uber guilds with 50 people roster each. <p><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://www.hi-logic.com/Echtelion_sig.jpg" style="border:0;"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--><br>

I would just like to add that in FaF  Xoraxis's leadership teamed with some of the best players I have ever grouped with work so well that we don't have to have 72 to do most raids..Its in the leadership, their strategies and the players capabilities. When you have to invite people to join a raid just for numbers to accomplish that goal then maybe you need to work on strategies or quality of players.  <p><!--EZCODE CENTER START--><div style="text-align:center"><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://www.tenebrarm.com/saphsig.jpg" style="border:0;"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--></div><!--EZCODE CENTER END--><br>

<br>
I hope they do that to EQ 2.  That would make a huge impact on the game.<br>
<br>
This new expansion sounds like fun too.  I much prefer 1 group stuff now.<br>
<br>
Having 80-100 people in a guild is too much.  Too many personal clashes.  Too much angst.  Too much resentment for too many reasons(showing up late, loot arguments, people not logging on).  Too much pressure to play all the time(without it you cant progress...with it you burn out)...and much more.<br>
<br>
I personally dont have the time nor the patience to do that anymore.  I like to play EQ but not for someone else....for their agenda or their goals.  I like to help people.  I like to group with folks I enjoy being around and I like to aquire things for friends.  But I like to do it at my pace.  So.... im not in a high end guild <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> ...and the game is starting to turn towards my style of play.

I can only agree. Like Delandril  said, I don't think any guild should have to compromise who and what they are to grow.  SOE is a bit stuck here. They try to cater to the 'high end' guilds by adding really tough challenges, that require you to dump insane amounts of time into the game, in organization alone. Like Caillou said I'm glad they're gearing the latest expansions, and EQ2, towards smaller teams.<br>
