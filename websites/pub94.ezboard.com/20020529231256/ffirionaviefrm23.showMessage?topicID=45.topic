There they could smith their unique weapons, and create newones to suit their new style of fighting..<br>
Many weapons were created, from the Simple Katanas' to long curved blades, made for Field Combat, a 'Nodat-chi'. Several types of bows and Arrows, and other weapons, such as a Sickle, with a chain and mourning star attached, a 'Kursai-gama'. Also, they created many small swift weapons, Daggers of sorts.. as well as many throwing Stars, fingerdarts, and other vairous things. The Dark Samurai used these small arms for when they did more.. covert operations.<br>
Much like a Rouge, some took to the duties of sneaking, stealing, spying, and many other 'Dishonorable' acts. This brand of Samurai soon became known as 'Ninja' and they had a fighting style all their own.<br>
<br>
Two years of recuitment, training, and prepration.. Soon, they would be blessed by Rallos Zek himself to bring war back into Norrath.<br>
And that is exactly what they did. They were legion, and as a legion should, they began cutting down all those that served the will of the Tranquil, Cutting down mostly those Monken fools based in Freeport, setting themselves several camps within the Eastern Commonlands so that they could have their war. The Monks never knew what hit them. <br>
Many of them were slain, for the Samurai outmatched them in almost every aspect of Combat, and their rage kept their will strong and unmoving as the blood flew, and the screams that filled Freeport rang in the air. <br>
Those screams fell upon deaf ears, the 'Militia' had already been dealt with. Several pieces of gold and you can run a muck in a city it seems.<br>
So the Monks began dying, being forced to flee to the only save haven they could find in Freeport.<br>
The Knights of Truth. <br>
Finally, the Samurai had some resistance. Those Knights rose their swords in Valor, and for it was the right thing to do, they defended the almost defenseless Monken friends, but as it was, those Samurai were just too skilled, too powerful.. too..<br>
Insane? As the battle grew on, a trend did run throught those darkones, it seemed that they just stoped killing to destroy the Monks..<br>
They begun killing just to kill. The will of Rallos Zek would be carried out, the weak would die, for if they were not weak..<br>
They would not die.<br>
Merchants, women, Warriors, Children. None were safe from these Samurai Warriors as they battled on. The Knights of Truth tried their best, but it was in vain, the Senshi No Adakia overran all of Freeport, right at the Very doorstep of the Temple of Marr.<br>
But that is where it ended.<br>
Divine intervention is always an annoyance, and it was time for some to take place..<br>
For Mithanel watched his Honorable followers die long enought, so he tossed his blade down before the SnA, it shining brightly with the light of Valor (Urg I'm sick of using that word :/), getting brighter.. and brighter.. untill it engusef the whole legion of Dark Samurai.. burning their flesh, and caushing pain to their very souls.<br>
And one by one, they began to fall. The light was powerful, too powerful for even them.. forcing them to either die or retreat.<br>
Some stood and faught. The smart ones decided to leave and come back another day.<br>
<br>
Leaving freeport.. one-eight of the legion survived... the rest had their corspes littered about the streets of Freeport..<br>
<br>
Those Paladins that lived.. they gave their thanks to their lord.. and they shouted throughtout the City.<br>
(Here it comes again..)<br>
&quot;Long live Valor and Honor!&quot;<br>
<br>
This battle, the first in what would become a fourty year war, small on the scale of the Gods, but in terms of man, a very long time indeed.<br>
This war that would result would be Known as the War of Chaos. <br>
<br>
..Back within the city of Freeport.. Several days after Mithanel's intervention, Several of the High Ranking officials within the Knights of Truth decided that something had to be done. They knew that they had not seen the last of those Dark ..'Samurai' they called themselves?<br>
Something had to be done. And that something was to be learned from the Monks, who knelt in thanks before the Knights of Truth, and who were indebted to them for saving what remained of their clan from Adakia.<br>
<br>
&quot;Why did they come after you all with such force?&quot; was the first question asked.. and the reply was simple.<br>
<br>
&quot;Because we choose not to fight with Rage or Hate in our hearts. They are.. well.. Warriors.. one, their leader used to be a Monk Brother along side the rest of us. But. he turned to the side of Rage.. tossing aside the tranquility and picking up a blade. The result is what you saw there.&quot;<br>
<br>
And the High Knights of the Truth poundered this a bit. A Monk that picked up a sword he said..<br>
<br>
&quot;They will be back.. we have to defend ourselves from them. We ask of you all, teach us to.. well. To fight like they do..<br>
So if they come after us once again..<br>
We can defend ourselves..&quot;<br>
<br>
That very statement caused rifts within both houses, Monk and Paladin alike..<br>
Many did not wish to come close to learning that Horrific fghting style of those evil men that invaded Freeport..<br>
And Many of the Monks would not teach them anything..<br>
<br>
But a select few.. as it was.. tore apart from the Knights of Truth and  The Monks of the Tranquil.<br>
<br>
They were to teach eachother it seems.. The Knights teaching these Monks how to use the sword.<br>
And the Monks would teach the Knights how to unlike their bodies potential. how to use their sprit when fighting.<br>
<br>
And they became a new faction, a new Guild.<br>
Korin No Samurai. Samurai of the Light.<br>
<br>
The Stage of battle had been set. And soon, the second assult would begin.<br>
<br>
In 1 years time.<br>
