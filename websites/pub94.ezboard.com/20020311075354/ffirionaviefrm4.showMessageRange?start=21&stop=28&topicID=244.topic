<br>
 I am not saying that is how I interpreted it when FV was created. I came here for many things, RP was and is at the top of the list. I RP pretty well for a MAWNAM (middle aged white north american male), but I will never be able to immerse myself to the extent some of you can.<br>
<br>
Recently the massively unrational and poorly thought out arguments that blatently told people to either conform to some people's idea of RP or leave made me angry. I took stands that I believe are true, but not necessarily what I would personally like to see. My analyst side took over and forced me to present arguments in an attempt to balance the sides.<br>
<br>
If you ever have need for a poorly leveling barbarian to take up a sword in your defense we will have a good time. Borm is a very stupid and straight forward warrior. Just do not use too many big words in his presence and you will be alright. (Think large dog). <br>
<br>
I just do not want to see anyone chased off this server because of his/her RP views. If a d00d comes here bashing RP then you will think I am Shintou reborn.<br>
<br>
Borm, stoopid, eer stuped, umm stouped, Dumb warrior. That is it!<br>

<br>
Anyway, accept the fact that you don't belong here, and enjoy the game. I know I don't belong on FV, but I like it here for many other reasons so I'm staying. I'm not so insecure about my intentions or so guilt-riden that I have to manufacture a defense for it. It's very plain and simple. FV was launched for the roleplayers. I'm not a roleplayer, much. I'll respond in like context when presented with it, but I pretty much just want to do the exp hunt, dungeon crawling, video game part. I don't think I'm harming any true RPers game with my quiet style. I want to get to the end-game, but having been there before I'm not rushed to it. I'm rather enjoying the availability of all those low and mid level dungeons that I didn't do the first few times around. I think the RPers have to RP our presence because, right or wrong, we ain't leaving. Likewise, since the RPers are the only reason this server exists, we owe them utter courtesy and respect. They will eventually lose this server to us and the PGers to come, and that's pretty messed up for them.<br>
<br>
End-game guilds are the nails in the RP coffin. Argue amongst yourselves on that if you want. Right now there's 1 nail, and that's not so bad, really. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=aradil>Aradil</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 16<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(1/17/02 4:25:37 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=244.topic&index=23>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Wow, my point was just taken out back and molested by 17</span><hr size=1> /agree Hrain.

<br>
Borm, I see nothing wrong with saying &quot;If you aren't going to RP, I would prefer that you play on a different server.&quot; There's nothing nasty about that, just stating a preference. That's my stance. <br>
<br>
&quot;If you ever have need for a poorly leveling barbarian to take up a sword in your defense we will have a good time.&quot;<br>
<br>
I don't doubt it, although Aradil is more than capable of defending himself <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
Vall said, &quot;I'm sick of seeing regular players being kicked around and intimidated by some guy who thinks Firiona Vie was created for roleplayers only. It wasn't. That's why it's called preferred.&quot;<br>
<br>
Then you said, &quot;I'd like to add that you people should stop trying to say what Verant meant.&quot;<br>
<br>
I'm not the kind of guy who likes to hold people to their exact wording, but this is a pretty blatant contradiction. If you're going to get nasty, at least try to be consistent. And no one here has made personal accusations, Vall, at least that I remember, certainly nothing like &quot;scum of the earth&quot;. Except maybe the people who say &quot;RP nazi&quot;. &quot;Powergamer&quot; and &quot;uberguild&quot; are I think only offensive to people who are ashamed (?) to be in that category. <br>
<br>

&quot;Non-roleplayers don't have a side of their story. Otherwise, they'd be roleplayers.&quot;<br>
<br>
Of course they don't! It's foolish to think that people who don't roleplay are NEVER bothered by roleplayers. Why, we roleplayers are better than those non-roleplayers. I can't understand why those non-roleplayers get angry when we yell at them in character, or tell them that they don't belong on that server. <br>
<br>
In case you can't tell, that was dripping with sarcasm.<br>
<br>
To the person who said I was contradicting myself:<br>
<br>
I was paraphrasing exactly what Verant said.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/umarvell15.showPublicProfile?language=EN>marvell15</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 14<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(1/17/02 6:11:38 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=244.topic&index=25>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_devil.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: A stand for all the d00ds, phat l3wt3rs, twinks, ubers, </span><hr size=1> I have to go and agree with Vall. I may have a problem with another post of his, but he spells it out nicely here. I dont get hassled about roleplay and yet to have someone ask to duel me because I dont. Noone can ruin my playing time here just like noone can ruin yours unless you let them.<br>

Roleplayer joins a Non-RP group on a blue server - talks in flowing verse in contrast to the others' short, succinct, plain modern english.<br>
<br>
The players can either belittle the Roleplayer and ostracize him for his ways, or accept it as a quirk, long as he can do the job.<br>
<br>
Now that the situation has reversed on Firiona Vie, which would you (and maybe your RPer party) do to the non-roleplayer, long as they maintain a semblance of dignity?<br>
<br>
&quot;Hi guys, can i join for a while to kill some aviaks and get a little xp?&quot;<br>

On RP duelling - <br>
<br>
when the person you wish to duel says :<br>
&quot;Sorry buddy, I got an hour and just want to kill some orcs and level today.  Don't feel like duelling.&quot;<br>
<br>
will you harass and berate them, or continue on to find someone who is more willing to roleplay with you?<br>
<br>
I think that you should just leave the person along, maybe say something like: <br>
&quot;You are lucky today, minion of the light/dark, I have duties that draw me away.  I shall let you live - for now&quot; <br>
&quot;Callow coward! I will find a more fitting opponent to whet my blades, I will not stain my blade with your cowardice!&quot;<br>
<br>
and then maybe an ooc &quot;(have fun, maybe we'll duel some other day.)&quot; in a tell.<br>
<br>
Act like a jerk, expect to be treated the same way in kind, even if you are just roleplaying it.  You can consider the return treatment to be RP as well.  =\<br>
