<br>
AS/SA - I miss them to be honest. I like honest competition and AS were honest competitors. For the most part they were humble and sometimes even obsequious. I really hated how so may people trashed them for a few people.. in VELKS of all places.<br>
<br>
Aside - If you dislike someone over what they do in Velks, YOU are the asshole most likely, not them. Velks is a shit pit, go xp somewhere else.<br>
<br>
Zsu - How could we possibly make use of rods that were innately changed? It was announced earlier that the actual item would be changed...<br>
<br>
On top of that, Why would he leave them on corpses in the bazaar arena? Why not someplace out of the way, but near a portal, like 300 kliks west of the NK spires? Maybe you should apply occam's razor to the situation and realize that maybe Rollen was just having fun in the arena.<br>
<br>
Zsu and Restoria - Funny... did someone hit a sore spot for you to get so defensive? Lots of very big guilds post that they are taking on recruits, just to see who they get who ISN'T in the uberguild community. Why would we do differently. We didn't intentionally set out to destroy a guild just to slow them down and recruit from... the same could NOT be said for some of your guild's actions. Remember, Reso was NOT the first guild to decide to awaken the sleeper on FV... (and we weren't the last either /snicker).<br>
<br>
I am not saying that there is right or wrong here necessarily... but you two seem to act like you have odor-free shit, a fact that is sadly false. <p><center>Nakath Thunderbush<BR>

Thats funny that you bring that up, when the fact of the matter is we talked about doing it, but you did it.. Even more interesting that Reso was the ones posting We WILL NOT WAKE THE SLEEPER, and then found a way to rephrase it to the community under the guise of roleplay to make it all better that you were doing it. <br>

I am not saying that I can do no wrong, I was merely pointing out the fact that if anyone was mass recruting, (ie going to the masses and saying COME TO US) it would be Resolution.  We did not.  The fact that many AS people came to us may have stemmed from the fact that we were negotiating joint raids with them prior to their disbanding.  We offered no guarantees that they would be guilded and agreed to be fair and judge them individually, just as we would anyone else who applied to us. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/uchinesevboy.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Chinese V boy</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>random_cleric_01</span><br>  Posts: 69<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(10/18/02 2:32:45 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1583.topic&index=33>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_sad.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: For those who didn't know...</span><hr size=1> omg! stop the flammage! be happy!<br>

<br>
For those that did observe, there was some active recruiting, perhaps not on the boards, but it was active. I would run past many meetings happening in the Nexus for perhaps a a little partnerships on raids. Now, unless no one talks to anyone else, this is known as a &quot;mixer.&quot; <br>
<br>
So the both of us being private guilds, It would perhaps come to my realization, that there must have been an invitation of some form brought to the other side. Now, people talk. Do you mean to tell me no one between both camps (Fire and Fury, Awakened Souls/Souls Arisen) talked about a possible future, one with the other, if something were to go wrong? I mean I'm not pointing fingers, In fact this is all totally speculation. This is in a sense a form of mass recruiting, in the sense that if my house burned down, I would stay at a friends house or a shelter.<br>
<br>
 I think that I would prefer the friends house.<br>
<br>
Anything wrong with that? Nope. Does it work to an advantage? Well in this case, it seems like many benefit, so this is great. Now, should all of Firiona Vie care? No, just the few that were helped should care, as it means benefit to them.<br>
<br>
So lets not jump on recruitment. Sometimes, it happens in a way that is slow, subtle and effective. <br>
<br>
Such as what I speculate, happened.<br>

<br>
I know we spoke about alliances. We spoke to alot of guilds about alliances. There are mobs out there that took 50 to 70 people to do WITH mod rod2. Now that mod rod 2 is changed the idea of alliances was discussed to help take out those targets without mod rod2.<br>
<br>
Dreadstorm, Reso, AS. All had been approached. Who knows we might still be able to work something out. After they fix / retune these mobs who knows what kind of numbers raid forces will need to take them down. Not one guild on FV can field a raid force of 70 by themselves. Not a one.<br>
<br>
Mergers? Sure it was talked about privately (within guild). It was brought up as an option against an alliance. We even had a poll. 70% of FnF that voted voted against a merger. They wanted to continue slow recruitment, being relatively picky.<br>
<br>
Does that answer your question serion? <p>Kzan Verto<BR>

Whether you meant to do it or not you did it.<br>
<br>
As for the Sleeper being awakened why don't you guys tell the server the REAL reason you awakened the sleeper?  You know the little bit about the 4th warder not using his aoe properly and how easy it would be for another guild to go kill him?<br>
<br>
As for the rods ... I didn't say you were smart about it Nakath I just said it was done.  Plenty of people were watching him and laughing at him.<br>
<br>
As for it touching a spot ... yeah it directly put a bad light on Fire and Fury ... a guild I am proud to be a member of.  I am sure if people posted vague statements that put Reso in a bad light you wouldn't like it either.<br>
<br>
Joint raids were considered yeah simply because we have had a lack of numbers and both guilds could benefit from it.  It was also a chance to get to know the other guild.<br>
<br>
Like Kzan just posted about the merger most were against it.  However it happened that SA needed a change and now they are going through the app process that everyone else goes through. <p><B>Zsuzsana Dracul</B><BR><I>Phantasmist of 60 Seductions</I><BR>

If it's not about mass recruiting, then why are you letting people that are known ebayed chars raid with you(Eldraed) when your so anti-ebay?<br>

<br>
When it became obvious to me that my guild was going to disband i choose <br>
<br>
It became clear that resolution for different reasons wasnt the option for me, or neither many of my friends. So we decided to all apply to the same guild and by that still beeing able to raid together and accomplish things in the high end game together. <br>

<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> This is the reason Fire and Fury has gotten alot of recruit applications the last few days. </b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
No more needs to be discussed about this<br>
<br>
Of course you can go on and guess or imply things about the way you think it is. but what i wrote above is the real deal. <br>
<br>
thank you <br>

When Bako/Cap said no to a join General raid for rogue epics a long long time ago and called us losers because we wanted to piggy back on FnF's muscle is what started all the animosity between our two guilds. We at Reso always hoped to have some joint raids on the bigger stuff. I was the naive one who actually thought our guilds could work some raids together. FnF had just wiped to Klandicar while Reso was hunting dragons in WW and we went over and rez'd/healed them up. I offered to lend them a hand taking down the vile beast with no claim on the much desired ST key component, but was rebuked because Caparelli was too superior in regards to Reso members. I also discussed the possibility of a join AOW raid a few months ago, but got the same chilled response from Cap/Bako. Now keep in mind I have few problems with anybody in FnF besides Cap/Bako so FnF members if you want to be loyal to your leader then flame away at me if you must. I will understand it, but one day you will understand. We all play this game to have fun and I hold no animosity towards ex-AS/SA toons who wish to join FnF.<br>
