Is there -anyone- here who's been around FV since 2001, who can remember what it used to be like, who feels that RP is alive as it used to be?  Sure, ppl are still RP'ng on an individual level, playing out their interaction w/ others, but all the major epic stories... the big plots that involved whole guilds and even races... just isn't around anymore (as I see it).  Is there anyone who would disagree w/ that?  The community simply doesn't have the make-up of avid RP'rs that it used to, and perhaps more importantly, is lacking ppl that seem interested in making stories that involve other ppl (real game masters).  Or am I simply too far removed from things now, and don't see that it is still going on?<br>

The casual RP (i.e. outside the clique) has diminished because of that fear and will continue doing so.  In other words, someone starting on this server today has a much higher likelihood of not being to find RP or to connect with the RPers than one who started even just 1 year ago (let alone Spring a year ago or even when the server began).<br>

How is this different than the blues which most of this community (the RP community) fled?<br>

As for whole plots and races and guilds involved, um I must have been working that day, because I never saw such thing, aside from a few guild vs guild things. the only big serverwide RP thing I ever saw was the whole Gore-Thrads thing. Now if /guildwar worked, I'm sure you would see some more things going on, as I know of at least two guild vs guild rivalries that would be happy to go /guildwar on each other.<br>

Frankly, I wish on FV that the chat channels were (automagically) language dependent - I will admit the first thing which started to hamper my RP was being able to fall back on the chat channels when buying / selling (*chuckle* the ol market channel - before there was a bazaar, and before the market turned into 90% blabbing).<br>
<br>
Cail, I know what you mean about the cliques, but I think in some cases it is not so much fear of reprisal, but just being tired.  People know who they've RP'd with, and it is easy and comfortable to keep it up as is.  Shortly before I disappeared from the server I had tried thinking up things to do to involve other ppl (like I had done with my own role in the Thrads/Gore conflict as the mortal woman who loved Thrads, and similarly in my numerous minor butting of heads with the League of Shadows, Valdria more specifically), but what ended up happening in the end is that I had just gotten tired.  While recruiting in the war against Gore it had gotten to a point I was working full-time, playing 8 hours a day, and 7 of those 8 hours I was spending telling ppl of events and what-not.<br>
<br>
Thraall, *wink* not my fault if ya weren't involved in RP - *chuckle* if ya remember, I tried to sweettalk you into siding w/ me against Gore (*laugh* and Didi - back when she and I were at odds over me trying to come between Thrads and Ellishae).  *smile* Every dark elf needs a strapping young Barbarian chap to take care of her needs, and I'm sure you wouldn't have minded (*chuckle* martial needs of course - slay this or that, intimidate so and so, etc... *shakes head in mock surprise* sheesh... what were you thinking?).  Still, it's interesting to hear from someone who doesn't see much of a change.<br>
<br>
And Jhary, your opinion certainly is an interesting one as well.  I'm not sure I fully agree, but I'm not so close to things anymore so as to be able to say for sure.  I do know a few ppl that do make an effort to at least remain in character, and you are right that it's better for ppl to make an effort to role play their character, not just role play sttrictly along racial lines, but on the whole to me it seems like fewer and fewer ppl care.  Mayhaps that's cuz Mizzy has grown older - perhaps it is predominately younger folks who RP (I think we'd all agree that once most of us hit raiding age RP starts to decline) - *chuckle* or perhaps I simply spend too much time hanging around the Bazaar and PoK.  As far as events/stories went on a server-wide scale, the Gore/Thrads story is the only one I'm aware of as well, but there were -many- inter-guild clashes (*laugh* SoM and LoS were always on the verge of war, and it wasn't unusual for other guilds to get sucked into what would start as a two-guild conflict).<br>
<br>
Perhaps it is only that I am haven't been directly involved with anything myself, but it has felt for some time (even before I stopped playing much) that RP has regressed only to social interaction, and what few events seem to take place (at least where someone is &quot;game master&quot; - making a story for the event) are happening only within the context of a single guild.<br>

I remember when I was in Clan of Brothers, we all came to the defense of Halas when Gore came to assult the city.<br>
<br>
I remember when we were pushed back by Gore and Rivald/Medhai and as we exited the city, a veritable army of people came to fight Gore (I think it was Court of the Crosswinds? not sure, Lust was in a guildwar with them I believe). It was little things like that which I remember best, was really fun.<br>

As to RP in it's current state, yes, it has become more of a personal thing for many, many do not RP anymore, while the clique's, as Caillou put it, still exist here and there. <p>===================<br>

I can play this from a few different angles.  There are good RP guilds out there, but they can be notoriously difficult to get into, and are small enough that any personality conflicts are sure to go ooc and result in some very hard feelings on one or both sides.<br>
<br>
Now, my personal experience being outside the RP guilds... has been that they *are* very tight cliques... and extremely difficult to break into.  The only RP event I ever was able to get in on was the Bloodmoon event through Poyson... and even then I missed half the story because I was not in LoS.<br>
<br>
And - about to be painfully honest here - to hear things like the Necropolis saying unguilded people (or non-roleplaying guilded people) are not welcome among them (the largest evil RP association)... sucks.  The same when I hear of them discounting personal RP in favor of what is on your character sheet - you can't play an evil wood elf and be accepted, and any evil guild which did accept you would receive grief for it.<br>
<br>
I can't say much about the good RP groups - the only ones which have ever been known to me have been the siblings, who are very closed with their events, or so it seems, and the blackmaul crusaders, who's events I have only heard of through these boards. <p><!--EZCODE CENTER START--><div style="text-align:center"><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://mywebpages.comcast.net/b_angel517/images/FalcSig.jpg" style="border:0;"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--><br>

<br>
True it does take effort to get involved especially at the higher seasons because now instead of the choices of xping or rping you add the choice of raiding into it also.  <br>
<br>
I do think there are clicks, it is easier to rp with someone you already know rp's.  <br>

I have been able to seek out people that love RP and have been welcomed warmly by them.  I came to FV from a blue server, (where I still spend some time), with a mind to RP here and thankfully I am able to do just that and I'm loving it!  I will also say that I found the Necropolis to be very open to me as an unguilded DE necromancer, before I proudly accepted the badge of the League of Shadows.<br>

Yes, most of them are part of my guild, but I'm talking to more and more people outside that &quot;clique.&quot;<br>
<br>
Like Minru, I can't comment on how things were before, but I can tell you I think FV just might be the best server out there, in terms of RP and community.<br>

Just my two coppers, though.<br>

(I have been here since day one).<br>
Now it seems that you will find RP in several small communities within the community, roleplayers gather on little islands in the big sea of OOC...It used to be the other way around.<br>
<br>
Raids are no excuse not to RP, i roleplay on raids and noone has complained so far, if your character is a fighter, he/she should be able to be as disciplined as your OOC self hehe.<br>
And why do you 'XP'? :P You are missing the journey unless you want to get to the end so you can start over. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

I don't really think most RPers are intentionally exclusive, but moreso defensively exclusive.  I know I have passed up RP in various places (even within my own &quot;clique&quot; lately) because of it.  Lazy? yeah at times that plays into it, too.  There is a &quot;giving up&quot; quality to it.<br>
<br>
One of the reasons I play more sporatically now and took a break from both game and boards for a bit was because I had lost quite a lot of the quality of EQ even while I had high quantity.  Some of the major OOC issues elevated by this board coupled with the rise in OOC in game and the anti-RP of both was making the game a grind not an &quot;escape&quot;, a diversion, something fun outside of the real world.    EQ, for me, was turning into just another video game (which I don't really find interesting and so rarely play) with occassional moments of RP.  I still like the video game of EQ over Diablo II because it is multi-player in a persistant world (not just invite only world instances like D2) more like the MUDs I enjoyed before (and for much the same reasons).  EQ no longer scratches my itch to play an RPG, eventhough, at one time, FV did.  On other servers (and increasingly on this) EQ becomes a chat room (the social part) where you can kill things (without any regard for else), to me that is very 2-dimensional.<br>
<br>
Sorry for waxing philosophical (errr rambling) but I woke at 6am and can't sleep.  Ironically, one of the things bugging me is that last night I gave up an RP opportuntity to group with guildmates because I knew the alternative was soloing and not spending any time with them.  I had fun, but it was in the video game category without the RP.  I really need to figure out how to reconcile that place with RP (how do other Marr followers who RP heavily deal with Halls of Honor?)  <br>
<br>
Just so you know EQ is not my life, the other thing &quot;bugging&quot; me is that I am going to a party tonight, I'm not sure I will know many of the people (and so am fighting my shy tendancies) and I bought a new outfit (well just the skirt and paired it with stuff my roomate and I have) which I am not sure I should wear (I'm not skinny and it is short short and I am not young and it is very piratey/goth/furry... so the voice of doubt in my head is telling me I will be a caricture and not perky fun which I want it to be and was having fun assembling it).  Though I will readily admit the shy thing I fight is one reason I like to immerse in EQ and RP.<br>

<br>
In 2 years, or very close to, of playing, I got to RP 2 times. Both were great fun, and would be so much more fun to play if there was more.<br>
<br>
The first time was in high hold pass, where the orcs are. There was a group of evil, there was our group. Insults started to fly, untill i got dueled. Woot my first duel... con the guy, yellow hehe. Well still accepted the duel, wich lasted 90 minutes /yawn. Some might wonder why 90 minutes, lets just say one side started healing/buffing the groupmate dueling, the other group followed suit. I died, but I never gave up, me being a hieh elf paladin, him being a dark elf shadowknight.<br>
<br>
Second was a raid Gore lead on Akanon, to wich a lot of of lightbringer went to defend. Lots of dueling, but what I remember the most was someone having the idea to create a living barrier to block Gore and his allies to enter the city. Ended in a GM coming down, to summon the evils one by one inside Akanon. We were told that we were violating a PnP rule. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showUserPublicProfile?gid=gothmatum>Gothmatum</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 10<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(8/16/03 9:09 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3873.topic&index=20>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://users.zoominternet.net/~gothmatum/images/lilgoth.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: *scowls*</span><hr size=1> OMG there's life outside EQ??? <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
