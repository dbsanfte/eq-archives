There was zero reason to lock that thread but it was locked anyway.  <br>
<br>
I felt the need to respond however to some of the accusations and comments made in the original thread.<br>
<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>Traelle: So take your happy ass back over to Kane Bayle, with all the plat you traded to get there<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Please provide evidence of this Traelle.  Before I left FV, I stripped both characters and gave everything including my bank funds to Chorahl because he is a very kind, giving person and is one of the few people that retains his original RP integrity on this server. <br>
<br>
If I had wanted to I could have traded it for over a million PP on KB or made a substantial amount of money on EBAY.  Why you continue to make this stuff up is beyond me.  I still like you Traelle, not sure why though, given your rabid fantasies regarding Ikon the Lootwhoring Ebayer.<br>
<br>
In truth, I hardly play there, I'm wearing cured silk which I made for myself, SoM and I have an uber opal encrusted stein as my primary.<br>
<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>Syluran: Can anyone who does not agree with your opinion be considered to have an original thought in your definition?<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Yes, any thought that you adopt because it suits you personally is a valid unique thought.  Do you think Murder is wrong? You'll probably say yes but what about when I police officer shoots and kills a mass murderer trying to escape custody.  Thinking about a belief rather then just believing it because its commonly accepted is generating unique thoughts.  <br>
<br>
What i'm trying to say to mods is don't lock a topic because its too difficult, or because somebody who can't help themselves from reading it finds it boring or because its making you feel uncomfortable.  Lock it because it needs locking and for no other reason.<br>
<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>I really don't think they're being all that censoring. They don't REMOVE the posts. They just lock them to calm folks down<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
If that was true then why was my thread locked. I would suggest because some ezyboard junkies decided it was boring due to the fact it actually addressed some real issues rather then just being the same old tired &quot;you suck shit, no YOu suck shitz!&quot; tirade that is the usual soapbox rant.  And K thought it would be fun to abuse her mod powers and put Ikon the Unpopular in her place.<br>
<br>
<br>
Anyway i'm going to take my happy ass back to KB and play with cured silk.<br>

I think the mods here do a great job.  I really do.  I understand what they go through, having one of my really good friends as an ex-mod.  I think it is a service to the community, one that I applied for, and am at times quite happy I was not chosen.<br>
<br>
That being said.<br>
<br>
Even though as of 3:37am the thread in question was not locked....although apparently, it wasn't because no one attempted to lock it.<br>
<br>
Even though the only gripe I could come up with about Kai after about an hour of searching is that the collar on Roose's neck in her sig is not noticable enough. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
I do not see any reason at all for that thread to be locked or attempted to be locked.<br>
<br>
I think the sig threads should not have been locked.  If someone gets out of hand, then delete/edit their post, or ban them, and get on with it.<br>
<br>
By the time I heard about the new sig guidelines, and flew to the FV boards to post my five cents (nope, not just two this time) every possible place I could express my extreme disgust was locked.<br>
<br>
Sure.  I could have started a new thread.  And then watched it get locked in about, oh, 30 minutes maybe?<br>
<br>
So instead, I had to resort to the telegram section, to atleast express a small part of my displeasure.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>And K thought it would be fun to abuse her mod powers and put Ikon the Unpopular in her place.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Look.  I do not agree at all with the above quote.  I am not defending Ikon because she is my friend, because honestly I only know her from her posts in the 'box, and my impression is negative.  Some of her points are good, some bad.<br>
<br>
But that thread (even though, at 3:53 am est it is still not locked, although the intention to lock it was expressed, not once but twice) should not have been locked.<br>

When the odds are all but against you, it's time to quit while you're still ahead, I was saving this person some extra grief, I'm really sure of that. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
That and I really don't see the point of the thread, it's just another person telling the mods what a bad job they're doing to take away everyone's &quot;Free speech&quot; and then getting attacked by everyone else who knows we're doing a good job. And it's just going to boil down to name calling anyways, like those threads normally do.<br>
<br>
But hey. if Iko wants more punishment, fine by me. <p><center>

We explained to you, time, and time , and time again. It was locked because it was a dead horse topic.  Nothing new could be added, nothing new could come of it, and no solution was in sight.  They were locked because people were becoming progressively more aggressive with each post.  This is not a democracy Ikon, this is a benevolent disctatorship.  Get over it.<br>

Newsflash Ikon.  It isn't locked, It wasn't even locked before you made this thread.  It was locked for maybe about 25 minutes.  It does not address real issues, it addresses moot points, because once again , this is not a board controlled by the people, it is controlled by the administration.<br>

You should stop suggesting , and assumine.  Because each time you do , you are proved incorrect.  If things are boring in the soapbox, people don't post on them.  You do not address any real issues, you just have a delusion that you do.  And I'd like you to point out a majority of the threads that are of the tirade &quot;you suck shit , no you suck shitz!&quot; type.  <br>
<br>
Please , use real information , truthful points, and stay on a topic.  Because right now , you're a laughing stock.

I think it was the blue teletubby that was gay, not the purple one ... as is widely assumed.  I have compeling evidence to support this, but I'm not allowed to elaborate in the interest of national security.(I'm assuming there was a blue one, I didn't really pay attention)<br>
