I dont think you can actually define what chaos is, but you can define what it is NOT. Chaos has no rules, rules is order and order is the opposite of chaos. <br>
<br>
Having said that order is the opposite of chaos what constitutes order? Well good and evil are rules in a way, they are sets and standards that one must follow to stay good or evil. By having rules order is present.<br>
<br>
Now if evil is based in order and order is the opposite of chaos then how can behavior be both chaotic and evil at the same time, simply put it cant. That is why traditionally chaotic evil clasified people are completly insane. They are a walking contradiction.<br>
<br>
In order to be truly chaotic one must be willing to ignore completly and totally what is both good and evil. they must follow no rules, even the ones that they set for themselves. <br>
In addition to this anyone wanting chaos to rule is actually seeking order. Because it is actually a selfish attempt to apply the persons rules of &quot;chaos&quot; on others thus making order when those rules are followed.<br>
 <br>
Im sorry if this seems cryptic or hard to follow, i sometimes have trouble expressing the thoughts in my mind when they are as abstract as chaos.<br>

&quot;Your sense of duty is commendable, servitor of Thule. Your fear has made you strong, and while I do not venerate your 'god,' I have found his followers to be... most impressive adventurers. If I may, however, ask you a question, as my friend, a Crusader of Greenmist, has not yet reached your level of enlightenment and involvement in the politics of your Empire. Do the castes of your Empire reflect power and achievement, rather than politicking and birth? If they do, I suspect it would be natural and proper for you to dominate Norrath, as you would be bringing the order of a meritocracy to lands that are now, with few exceptions, ruled by the corrupt and the incompetent. Corruption, of course, takes many forms, but claiming one can lead the powerful without having power oneself is hypocrisy and the highest corruption of all. I suspect most adventurers here would agree,&quot; the Enchanter comments as his granite eyes scan the room, &quot;that the strong should lead. Strength is, after all, an objective measure, so long as one defines what strength is important for what position. The barbarian, for instance, if he is truly strong, would make an excellent warlord, while the Artkeepers would make masterful lords of the magical forces. Even those who practice the fine art of arbitration, such as myself, have a place once our strength in that is proven.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;On the other hand, if birth is key, your system is no less corrupt than others. If those not of your kind who accept the meritocracy cannot gain access to the positions to which they are most able, we once again have the weak leading the strong, which is a quick way to disrupt the carefully structured order. I would like to think more of your Empire, of course, as from what I have seen, it seems to be far superior to the conspiratorial kingdoms of Antonica, Odus, and Faydwer,&quot; he states, narrowing his eyes and sharply, bitterly, accenting the final word.<br>

Who ones father is has no bareing on his caste or position. We have no desire to allow outsiders within our society, those not hatched Iksar are hatched flawed and weak, and have not been raised properly. We may accept Iksar who are hatched from beyond the Empire's borders who seek to redeem themselves and join us, but not other species. They are flawed, and allowing them in would be a mistake.&quot; <br>
<br>
&quot;We are strong, soft skin, Iksar are always assigned to the caste they are best suited for. Under the rare circumstance an Iksar shows he is truly gifted at a caste he was not assigned, his caste is changed. One can recieve training from other castes in their off time, if they so wish, although their skill will never match those assigned to that caste. Those who prove they are incompetent are killed, so there are few, if any, incompetent Iksar. We have politics, but they are few and nothing like yours.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;The only exception to this is the Emperor, who is suceeded by one of his heirs. But even the Emperor's offspring belong to a caste themselves.&quot;<br>

<br>
&quot;It does. Interesting, that. At least among your own kind, you have the right idea. However, I don't see why prudent alliances with those who share your point of view -- or, rather, at least some of your point of view -- is such a negative thing. It sounds almost as if your empire is falling to the same curse of bigotry and unreasoning hatred that's weakened the rest of Norrath. If I conspire to destroy your country, as the Teir'Dal are doing to the proud Ogres and the Fier'Dal, I can understand your hatred. However, when I work to establish a meritocracy similar to your caste system, and battle our mutual foes, I don't understand why, by birth, I am inherently at fault for the actions of the other Koada'Dal which, admittedly, are not necessarily wise,&quot; the magus states matter-of-factly, with a slight hint of detachment in his voice.<br>
<br>
After a brief pause, he continues. &quot;I also agree that your politics can't possibly be as bad as those on Antonica, Odus, and Faydwer. The clerics and paladins of Felwithe have a conspiracy to destroy the Keepers of the Art, for instance, and there's a secret war going on in the streets of Freeport. Cabilis is far more peaceful.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;In any event, I don't, of course, begrudge you your beliefs. I just happen to specialize in the fine art of arbitration, so I'm interested in knowing both sides and trying to draw everyone into a mutually beneficial agreement. Allying all adventurers of Norrath into a powerful organization to overthrow the false lords who claim rulership through divine right or appointed position, I think, would serve everyone's goals and establish a new age of order.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Of course, to do that,&quot; the magus smirks and winks, &quot;we'd need to get past the issue of birth determining value. I think even the advocates of chaos, like the Teir'Dal on the stage, would have a place as the armies of this new order. Giving people the ability to do what they want to do -- in his case, destroy everything -- is always advantageous, and at least in the cases of some, fear would be a powerful ally in controlling them. I can see the Sebilites acting as the commanders of a glorious military working in the service of Order.&quot;<br>

<br>
The shaman takes a big breath, looking at Illudin closely.<br>
<br>
&quot;You creatures are born flawed. You are not Iksar, you do not act or think like Iksar, you are inferior, and as such there would be problems if you were to live amongst us. The natural tendencies of you creatures are different from us,  you are different in ways we find revolting.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Also, everyone in our society has a clearly defined rank, according to their caste, and their position within their caste. Those who belong to no caste, and have no rank, our society simply does not have a method of accomodating. Who do they take orders from? What are they allowed and not allowed to do? Our society doesn't accomodate this. Visitors from outside have no place amongst us. Perhaps some system could be worked out if we truly desired for outsiders to be amongst us, but we do not. As I said, they are flawed.&quot; <br>
<br>
&quot;As long as there are multiple nations, races, and independent countries, they WILL fight, and they WILL war, and they WILL betray eachother. The only way this will ever stop is if there is only one nation, and one ruling goverment. We Iksar intend to become that nation. Once we rule, the petty wars and fights will cease. The only form of co-exsistance we will tolerate is if we can be assured we shall never, ever have to interact with those beyond our borders, and the chances of such a relationship developing are slim, and even if they did, someone would eventually break it.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;We all revere Cazic-Thule, and we won't tolerate the worship of false gods, nor shall we tolerate the worship of ones self. The ways of fear shall be the only path followed, and the only path allowed.&quot; <br>
<br>
&quot;We do not have any desire to be part of a joint army with lesser beings who will lie, betray, backstab, and run around doing their greedy little soft skin things and worshipping false gods. We do not wish to command troops we do not have anything but the utmost faith in, Iksar. Espicially not those wretched Tier Dal. Those things should be wiped off of Norrath permanently.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Some Iksar work with soft skins, yes. But just remember when the time comes and the Empire calls, we shall be enemies.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Does that answer your question, soft skin? Do you have any more?&quot; <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/uzildrax.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Zildrax</A> at: 8/8/02 2:40:29 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ugravesfv.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Graves FV</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 96<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(8/26/02 11:08:07 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm23.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=101.topic&index=30>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Time is soon.</span><hr size=1> Word reaches the catacombs.

A wink to the old hag in the corner, once a beautiful maiden of Qeynos, Graves grabs his scythe and starts for the secret panel.  As he is about to exit, he is guided by words of his mentor....<br>

&quot;Graves, be silent out there.  Time is on our side.  Spread the plague.  Let the fools fight with metal and their weak hearts.  In the end, there is only one side and our plague can't be stopped.&quot;<br>

Graves turned and nodded at his mentor.  <br>
<br>
&quot;I shall take note of your words wise one.  Arrogance is for the weak.  Challenging in battle eventually will kill the messenger.  We wait for the weaken victor to stand alone and then we shall reign all lands.  I shall use the shadows to our benefit and poison the fields, the water and the land as our creator wishes.&quot;<br>

&quot;hmm, so back to this old hat again? Well, as much as I love a good argument, we all know for any survival, order must prevail, even chaos is order in and of itself...&lt;snickers&gt; Everything happens from a simple cause and effect pattern, unless we are to expect intervention from a supreme deity, but those &quot;gods&quot; I fear, cannot interfere any longer as we have over powered even them...<br>
Which means cause and effect, a simple rule of order, rules all our lives, no matter how much one can try and escape it, it follows you. &lt;mutters a bit under his breathe&gt; Order is a path for the wise, not because we wish to follow it, but because we know that it is the only true path...<br>
&lt;closing his eyes and relapsing into a long drawn out memory&gt; <br>
You know, I would prefer being ignorant, since ignorance is bliss, and following chaos. Even those who say they are chaotic are doing so from a cause, whether its because they are in search of a money &lt;chuckles&gt; which could have infinite causes, to sheer lust for destruction which could stem from a disgruntled childhood to a unfortunate accident in the past....&lt;sighs heavily, and takes a long drink from the pitcher&gt; Either way, I know you will continue believing your following you non-existant path, and more power to you, but order is the only path, and cannot be deviated from, sad as it is...&lt;soon becomes overtaken by sudden grief, and leaves in search of the bottom of the pitcher or 10&gt; <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=zatranik>Zatranik</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 1<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(9/2/02 4:52:28 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm23.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=101.topic&index=32>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Chaos</span><hr size=1>   Suddenly, a hole breaks in the ceiling and a figure falls through.

  &quot;Well... I was lissstening from above. An arguement over good and evil, hmm? I agree with Zildrax, of what he stated a while ago. The sssoftskins are the evil oness, the have what, four, five continents to themselves? And they barge into Kunark and make an outpost of their own?!&quot; The iksar hisses and looks around.<br>

The softssskins all see themselves as good, even the ogres over the humans, the dark elves over the halflings. They all think they are the good team. They'd probably even pay to be called good.
