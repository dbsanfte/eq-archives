<br>
Interesting you should bring up the &quot;n-word,&quot; C-Pete.<br>
<br>
One of the things that I had to get used to hearing while working with the next generation of America's Most Wanted, is that many of the young African American males and females refer to each other using the N-word.  And, when they use it in the slang style, it is considered a friendly way of referring to one's &quot;homeys&quot; (not referring to a building structure here).<br>
<br>
However, if an unwelcome Anglo American uses this word, it is considered to be a threat, and will be treated as such.<br>
<br>
What is also interesting is that listening to rap music (which I shall not cast comment here regarding however, tis a part of the job that I do come into contact with this style of music), I hear the use of the N-word frequently by black singers referring to one another, without remorse from its listeners, which happen to be a broad African, Asian, Mexican, Anglo, Native and all other included American population.  And rap music sells- even Eminem got a Grammy, and his lyrics are not exactly considered &quot;kosher&quot; in most crowds.<br>
<br>
So the word that many of us have been raised as offensive, has found its place back into the vocabulary; if I had a stronger linguistic background, I would be inclined to say that the innotations of how the word is said, and its context, have bearing on determining whether or not it was used within its appropriate context of its &quot;new meaning.&quot;  <br>
<br>
Again, I am not saying that this is right or wrong; it is just something that I have noticed as occuring within the English language.  Personally, I can not fanthom that word emerging from my lips, but there is a growing sector of the population which appears to feel that the word has a place in every day speech, if used appropriately and in context.<br>
<br>
(brief comment:  Just to clarify for readers, the N-word is *not* referring to the band N*Sync, another grammy award winning musical group).<br>

<br>
No, its pretty commonly accepted that the N-word is bad.  BUT in certain circles among people of African-American descent THEY use the word amongst themselves as an endearment or slang.  In THAT context it seems acceptable.  Its all about context. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ueliezeroferudin.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Eliezer of Erudin</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 408<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(3/24/02 12:55:16 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_supermad.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: oops.</span><hr size=1> &lt;&lt;  That's my point... it's a bad habit that's hurtful and, consciously or not, mean-spirited. I prefer to take a stand against letting derogotory slurs become common language rather than accepting them. &gt;&gt;<br>
<br>
I would not at all mind seeing the word drop out of usage.  Brion's statement to edit out such references is his perogative and fine.  I am just against labeling everyone who uses the term as some kind of hate monger, since I am quite sure many people are using it in a context where the LAST thing on their minds is Homosexuality.<br>
<br>
EDIT: I am also against the unnecessary application of 'Political Correctness.'  The original ranter isn't even gay.  It doesn't bother ALL gay people.  If I did something that offended someone, tell me and I will do my best to accomodate.  But don't chastise me because MAYBE I did something that MIGHT offend someone.  If you go down that road where do you end?  See my comments vis a viz 'lame.' <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ueliezeroferudin.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Eliezer of Erudin</A> at: 3/24/02 12:59:14 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ukurley.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Kurley</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 4<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(3/24/02 1:52:09 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_supermad.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: oops.</span><hr size=1> First off, if you think our board has a &quot;gay bashing&quot; problem, I beg to differ.  Check out the F&amp;R section of almost any other board and you'll see what I'm talking about.  It's disgusting.<br>
<br>
Second, from what I've observed, &quot;ghey&quot; is developing it's own meaning in the vernacular of d00d sp3@k.  Undoubtably you cannot mistake that ghey was derived from gay.  However it's taken on its own qualities that lead people who wouldn't otherwise use the word &quot;gay&quot; as an insult to use the word &quot;ghey&quot;.<br>
<br>
Third, for those labelling anyone who uses d00d sp3@k as a &quot;fucking idiot&quot; or a moron, or unintelligent or any other insult, that is plain hyporcisy.  Calling someone an idiot because they decide to use a slang lingo that is widely accepted in the online community is just as base as insulting someone for their sexual preference, religious belief or racial background.<br>

You're right I'm not homosexual, and I suggest you watch one react to some one saying &quot;That's gay&quot; in a hateful way.  They may say they don't mind, but watch them cringe.<br>
<br>
As for the &quot;N-word,&quot; the use of it among African-Americans (and I'm being specific because it's not used anywherelse, Canada maybe) is often seen as a way of taking the offensive power of the word away.  Now I'm not saying gay is a bad word, I speaking specifically about it's usage, how d00dz etc... use it in association with something being bad.  That's the problem. <br>
<br>
I'm not sure if I can be any more clear. <br>

<br>
I agree that folks have mutated &quot;gay&quot;, meaning homosexual, into &quot;ghey&quot;, meaning stupid, idiotic, etc.<br>
<br>
I remember when I was a kid, and &quot;Polish&quot;, meaning a person from Poland, was mutated to &quot;pollock&quot; (sp? - I don't care how it's properly spelled), meaning stupid, idiotic, etc.<br>
<br>
What I don't remember is anyone trying to tell me that it's okay to use &quot;pollock&quot; because people are spelling a group's label differently, and only referring to what they THINK of the original group rather than the actual group itself.<br>
<br>
I could go on with my speculation on what the difference is supposed to be in the minds of those defending the idea that when a word evolves, it automatically loses the psychological connotations of the original word -- an idea that's defended for the first, but not the second word I mentioned.  In the end though, I don't care.<br>
<br>
I see the roots of the word &quot;ghey&quot; for what they are, and it should come as no surprise that I find them ugly.  Due to that, I can't be fully objective whenever someone uses it, or defends its use.<br>

I've already posted this, but I'll say it again.  Part of this has its roots in a heterosexist/homophobic attempt to attach a negative meaning onto the word &quot;gay&quot; (and, like others, I'd never seen it spelled &quot;ghey&quot; before seeing Heagen do it here), a word that is a distinctly positive term in the queer community.  I've said it before, but culturally, it's a discursive attempt to resignify the term as something negative, as something shameful.  And we gay men, bisexuals, and lesbians are very familiar with attempts to make us feel ashamed.<br>

<br>
Here, I will repost exactly what you said so I can explain what I meant.  You said:<br>
<br>
&lt;&lt;  arkitip:<br>
<br>
That's something of a cop-out, don't you think? Sure, many of us are unconscious of our own sexism, racism, classism, religious bigotry, homophobia/heterosexism, biphobia/monosexism (*smile* Bakanome), etc. That does not, however, mean we should be paralyzed rather than confront others' - isms. (By the way, some of us make very conscious efforts to combat, internally and externally, the oppressive ideologies our culture inculcates into us.)  &gt;&gt;<br>
<br>
My impression was that you were labeling his use of the word 'gay' as an example of the &quot;unconscious sexism, racism, classism, religious bigotry, homophobia/heterosexism, biphobia/monosexism (*smile* Bakanome), etc.&quot; that you mention above.  If that is not the case, fine.  But Arkitip said he sometimes instinctively used the word 'gay' in speech as a synonym for lame, and it /looked/ to me like you were labeling that 'unconscious homophobia.'<br>
<br>
I can only assume your use of the term 'str8' is meant to be a humorous way of showing the negativity of the term.  Believe it or not I do agree.  The term with the spelling 'ghey' is used on many EQ boards, I don't know about the larger internet as a whole.<br>
<br>
But I am happy to concede the point at this juncture.<br>

Why is it so hard to have a debate about a simple issue of semantics?  We're not talking about violence against gays, hate against gays, or anything like that.<br>
<br>
Its like every six months or so there is a news article about how some Native American group is trying to sue to force the Washington Redskins, Atlanta Braves, or Cleveland Indians to change the name of their team.  Now, I fully support that Native Americans got the shaft HARD in this country, moreso than any other group ever (in the US I am saying), but enough already!  Changing the name of the Washington Redskins is not going to fix anything, and I think its been around long enough that it has no real negative connotation. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ueliezeroferudin.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Eliezer of Erudin</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 413<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(3/24/02 6:09:47 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_supermad.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: what about this?</span><hr size=1> &lt;&lt;  Is it offensive if instead of gay, or ghey, someone was to say &quot;this is queer?&quot; &gt;&gt;<br>
<br>
Queer means odd.  However aside from a few small pockets in the society I doubt you see it used that way much anymore.<br>
<br>
The Homosexual community has 'recaptured' the term Queer and use it to identify themselves.  But the original meaning of the word is still valid.<br>
<br>
So, my opinion:  If you say 'This is queer' AND the context is perjorative, meaning you are using it as an insult, then yes I would say it can be found offensive.  BUT if you say 'This is queer' AND the context is NOT negative but merely like 'Wow this is odd in a sort of questioning way, then you are using it in the proper context and I don't feel anyone should take offense.  Its not negative and doesn't refer to homosexuality in any way, which is not true of 'ghey.' <br>
<br>
Context is everything. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/urobingoodfellow.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Robin Goodfellow</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 291<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(3/24/02 7:51:54 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_bigsmile.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: Of course I'd post...</span><hr size=1> Eliezer:<br>
<br>
You need to read both posts a little more closely.<br>
<br>
What arkitip was saying, and what I was responding to, was that on some level we're all prejudiced, biased, and/or discriminatory.  He was using this as something of a shield: &quot;Don't call me prejudiced because you are, too.&quot;  Aside from the logical fallacy of the argument (the a priori determination that everyone else must be prejudiced as well), it's also a rhetorical gesture designed to deflect attention away from one's own potential prejudices and onto one's interlocutor.  Psychoanalysis would call this &quot;projection&quot; (for all its faults, psychoanalysis sometimes has some powerful insights).  My post wasn't calling arkitip &quot;homophobic&quot;; it was challenging his attempt to reverse the discourse.<br>
<br>
Furthermore, the line of thinking he proposes, that we're all on some level prejudiced/biased/discriminatory and therefore shouldn't point out others' prejudices/biases, leads to paralysis: &quot;You can't say I'm sexist because you're homophobic!&quot;  That was the other part of his post I was challenging.<br>
<br>
Even further, the part you're quoting is my concession of a point arkitip originally made himself.  He said we're all, on some level, biased.  I said, &quot;Sure, that may be true, but that doesn't get us off the hook about doing something about it.&quot;<br>
<br>
I don't even know how you got out of that that I was accusing arkitip of being &quot;homophobic&quot;.  That seems to me to be yet another projection.  My words are fairly careful in my response.  I'm not terribly subtle when I think someone's actually being homophobic/heterosexist, as is evidenced on this board in previous posts.<br>
<br>
Changing topics, a number of the people who are actually gay/lesbian/bisexual have already spoken on this matter, in this thread and in others.  Some of us don't mind, like Bakanome, but a lot of us do, like myself.<br>
<br>
There's nothing &quot;new&quot; in the way kids are using &quot;gay&quot;, as in &quot;that's lame.&quot;  That was going on when I was in junior high, more than a decade ago.  That doesn't make it any less homophobic.  The equation is this: gay=stupid.  The intent of that equation is clear, and no matter how defensive you get about it, it's intended to insult gay people.  As soon as an actual gay person objects to this usage, then all the defenses of the term come out.<br>
<br>
But how about this, instead of the defensiveness?  How about thinking before you speak?  How about *not* saying something you now know is offensive to a group of people?  Isn't that called &quot;common courtesy&quot;?<br>
<br>
Maybe I'm too much of a midwestern boy, but I really don't understand why some people go so completely out of their way to defend themselves when they've insulted someone, instead of saying &quot;Gee, I'm really sorry, it won't happen again.&quot;<br>

granted, there are people uncomfortable with homosexuality, but does that mean every person who uses a word which vaguely resembles what you vaguely resemble is fearful?<br>

<br>
Why does it have to be a projection?  This is my only complaint.  I am perfectly capable of being wrong without having some underlying root cause.  I don't need a diagnosis.  If I misinterpeted you, fine.  I still think your original post was not as clear as the position you have defined here.<br>
<br>
&lt;&lt;  There's nothing &quot;new&quot; in the way kids are using &quot;gay&quot;, as in &quot;that's lame.&quot; That was going on when I was in junior high, more than a decade ago. That doesn't make it any less homophobic. The equation is this: gay=stupid. The intent of that equation is clear, and no matter how defensive you get about it, it's intended to insult gay people.  &gt;&gt;<br>
<br>
Here is where we will have to agree to disagree.  I am WITH you in that it would be better for all for the usage to be dropped.  I will NOT agree however that it is always intended to insult gay people.  As you say, the gay/lame reference has been around a long time.  Long enough that people do use it and homosexuality never crosses their mind.  There is NO INTENT to insult gay people.  If A&amp;B are having a private conversation and neither A nor B are gay, and A says 'Dude that's gay,' there is no context for it.  They are using it as lame.  However, the possibility certainly exists, as this thread is perfect example of, that the usage CAN cause insult, intentional OR unintentional.  I just don't buy that everyone who has ever used 'gay' as a synonym for lame is homophobic or is intentionally insulting homosexuals.<br>
<br>
&lt;&lt;  As soon as an actual gay person objects to this usage, then all the defenses of the term come out.  &gt;&gt;<br>
<br>
Actually, several times I have stated the term would be better unused.  I am only defending that people who have used the term are not necessarily the homophobic childish morons that people here are saying they are.<br>
<br>
&lt;&lt;  But how about this, instead of the defensiveness? How about thinking before you speak? How about *not* saying something you now know is offensive to a group of people? Isn't that called &quot;common courtesy&quot;?  &gt;&gt;<br>
<br>
If you think that my position is contrary to that, you should re-read my posts.<br>
<br>
&lt;&lt;  Maybe I'm too much of a midwestern boy, but I really don't understand why some people go so completely out of their way to defend themselves when they've insulted someone, instead of saying &quot;Gee, I'm really sorry, it won't happen again.&quot;  &gt;&gt;<br>
<br>
I didn't insult anyone.  This thread started because someone said basically that they hated it when people used gay/ghey as a perjorative, and then several people slammed anyone and everyone who used the term as a child, a moron, and a wanker.  This thread was NOT a complaint about an individual who said something inappropriate.<br>
<br>
If you are looking for an apology, look elsewhere, I didn't insult you.<br>

If I was a Jew and people started using the word 'jhew' to indicate something was bad in some way, that'd irritate me too, even if the person using the term didn't mean anything anti-Semitic with the use of the word. We have *plenty* of words in the English language to describe anything bad or negative. English is probably the richest language in the world; there is no need to make up words or distort existing words. Doing so just hints at a lack of education or intelligence in my viewpoint (but then again, one of my majors was English, so I am probably biased).<br>
<br>
I suspect that like most slang used by the young, it was originated and is perpetrated by those who lack self-esteem and wish to look cool to others. I doubt it's really any deeper than that at this point, at least in general. However, it wouldn't surprise me if the first person to use the word 'gay' in this manner was either a closet homosexual, a generic homophobe, or someone young having a gender identity crisis who desperately wanted to look ultra-straight to others because the person was scared he or she might *not* be straight. Often it is the people who have a secret fear that they may be gay (or who are, in fact, gay) that use the most anti-gay terminology, and that's probably true of this distorted meaniing as well.<br>
<br>
/shrug<br>
<br>
Mainly, it just annoys me because it's inaccurate uneducated English and I personally love my language too much to see it widely distorted, especially when it's in a way I *know* may offend some part of the population.<br>

I just don't find it cool to see kids running around like they're on a moral high horse with some &quot;oh that's so offensive!&quot; when these are probably the same people who see a white person who listens to hiphop and dresses a certain way and calls them a &quot;wigger&quot; as though there's nothing wrong with that statement.<br>
Am I to be assured that you all have never said &quot;that's retarded&quot; about something? I doubt it. So cut the morals discussion from that two steps above people standpoint, that's what I'm getting at.<br>
<br>
And Eliezer, that's sorta what I was getting at. The word queer has been &quot;hijacked&quot; in a sense by the gay community in reference to said community. I was pointing out that a word *can* change definition in a manner of speaking. It can now be seen as offensive if a straight person says &quot;this is queer.&quot;<br>
