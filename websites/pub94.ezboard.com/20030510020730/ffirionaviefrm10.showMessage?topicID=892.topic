<br>
<br>
The circle of life... Or what is should be. A child is born, brought screaming into this world by a women and a man. A child grows into an adult if lucky and grows from experience. A child is something I never had the pleasure of being. No... Not me. Created? Formed? Manufactured perhaps... but not born… <br>
<br>
<br>
“Do you think it will work?” the young Tier’Dal asked, gazing at his master in wonder.<br>
<br>
“Hush Dron. I need to concentrate now, we shall see is it will work or not” <br>
<br>
“Yes, of course forgive me.”<br>
<br>
The old wizard laid the dead body on a table before him with extreme care; the price the necromancer asked for the corpse was too great to pay twice. The blue skin of the young male was covered in tattoos, his skin flawless; the bastard necromancer had not lied when he said he would find a prime specimen. He was young, he had to be, this body must last.<br>
<br>
“Bring me the rune, its time to begin” the old wizard croaked, stress and excitement breaking into his normally calm voice. <br>
<br>
“Yes Master, here you are.”<br>
<br>
The old wizard placed the rune on the body, the spot marked by the head of a black phoenix. He stepped back, nerves making his hands quiver in fear of the sin he was about to commit. Breaking the laws of nature, the laws of Tunare herself. Making life not of a women and a man but of death, fire and magic. <br>
<br>
“It begins.” He whispered, more to himself then to be heard.<br>
<br>
He pushed up this sleeves and began the incantation, the arcane words flawless as he spoke. He had been working for this moment for years, perfecting the spell, finding body after body to experiment with. All before this had failed horribly, the spell was to strong, the corpses could not handle the fiery spirit, burning into ashes on the table. He was sure this time would work; he would have his creation, his demon pet. The thoughts raced through his mind, he would be the creator of this new perfect race, created to serve Fennin and the fires of Ro. <br>
<br>
As the old man worked the rune began to glow bright, the tattoos on the body faded from a coal black to a crimson red, clashing with the blue skin on the body. Fire licked the ends of the table, threatening to char the precious body and end the spell in failure just like the rest. The old man opened his eyes with the last of the words, watching the fire lick the body.<br>
<br>
“No!” he cried out “Not again.”<br>
<br>
With a speed unnatural to his age he pulled the ice spell to his mind, in a mad attempt to douse the fires. He was too late, the room itself had begun to glow, smoke filled his eyes blinding him. <br>
<br>
“Dron!” he called out to the young boy “Get out of the room, close the door behind you!”<br>
<br>
It was too late, in his concentration the fires had consumed the right half of the room. Blocking the exit trapping both him and the boy. The boy was franticly casting every ice spell he could call to mind at the taunting fire to no avail. The searing heat was unnatural, it consumed the furniture and shrugged off the cold magic like an annoying insect. <br>
<br>
“I fear this is the last time I will fail at this. I don’t think ill be trying again” <br>
<br>
The old man watched the dancing red and yellow though the thick smoke as it grew ever closer. He and his apprentice would die here,  slowly, consumed by the very fires he called to this realm.<br>
<br>
                                       *                *                 * <br>
“Ugh.. “ The young man groaned, searing pain in his back and chest.<br>
<br>
He sat up slowly, opening his crimson eyes for the first time, a young male in his early 20’s. He shook his pounding head, trying to clear his foggy vision. Sliding off the table he crumpled to a heap on the ground, his legs would not support him. <br>
<br>
“ Where..” He whispered, his voice smooth and unwavering.<br>
<br>
His eyes shot open at the sound, this was not his voice, this was not his body and this was definitely not his home. He struggled to his feet, forcing his eyes to scan the blackened room, nothing but stone and ash. It was then fear and bewilderment set in, he was alone naked and in pain. Fighting to walk he stumbled to a wall, using it as support to stand. A sick crunch rang out form under his foot as he crushed the skull of a boy, the bone so frail and weak from the fire it crushed like an egg shell. <br>
<br>
“Where am I “ he thought, unwilling to hear the strange voice again. “How did I get here?!”<br>
<br>
He struggled to clear his mind, How did he get here? What was going on? Who was he? He crouched down in the ashes in the dark corner of the room the sick realization finally setting in. He did not remember why his voice sounded so different, he did not remember how he got here, and he did not remember anything before this moment. Panic set in as he fought to make sense of things. <br>
<br>
“Think, think fool. What was the last thing you remember? Where were you? What were you doing?!” His mind raced.<br>
<br>
There was no answer to his questions, his mind was blank. He was new to this realm, not born but created. The knowledge of how to speak, how to walk and think perhaps remnants of the body he was forced into, perhaps the mind of his soul, perhaps fed to him though the destructive fire that breathed life into his chest. More questions he could not answer, there were only questions, never answers.<br>

<br>
Hours passed into days, days into weeks and weeks into months. After the fire there was not much left of the lab tucked deep away in the Rathe mountains. The food storage and dining area were damaged but otherwise intact, the only room that remained untouched was the old wizard’s bed chambers. For months he pawed over books and notes, bits and pieces of arcane script, and journals, fruitlessly. The old wizard had covered his tracks well, to well, the only scrap of useful information that could be found was a scribbled list of names and spell components. Flame agates, corpses, parchment, ink all useless, save for one item. At the bottom of the list was the most resent purchase, “corpse: Tier’Dal , Draehan Aramil.” <br>
<br>
            *                           *                            *      <br>
  <br>
“Hello!” The booming voice of the massive warrior was loud even though the thick wooden door.<br>
<br>
“Hay! any one home?” Groganthanos boomed once more before his massive foot turned the door in on itself. <br>
<br>
The huge man grinned as he looked in the remains of what once was an entrance hall. He had to duck fit under the door frame, the Ogre stood a good 8 feet tall well over the capacity the home was built to handle.<br>
<br>
“If you’re here you may as well come out now! Hide and you’ll regret it!” He stood his full height, his bald head grazing the ceiling of the room, allowing his voice to echo off the walls.<br>
<br>
Draehan could hear the voice from the bed chamber like a trumpet. He worked quickly, unsure of what to expect. The precious notes were tucked away in a hidden wall storage before he made his way quietly out into the dinning area. The massive room was empty save for the long table, the door to the entrance hall at the opposite side of the room. A voice, something his ears had never heard before rang out once more.<br>
<br>
“This is your last chance old man; don’t make me come find you!”<br>
<br>
Draehan stood silent by the doorframe, a small flame danced on his fingers. He readied to defend himself if needed, though any thing he could have thrown at the warrior would have only proven to anger him. He stepped into the main hall boldly, knowing very well there was no where to hide in the remains of the home.<br>
<br>
“There yo-.. Hey, you’re not Malories. Get your master out here, he has some explaining to do!” the Ogre growled fiercely.<br>
<br>
Draehan stood quiet for only a moment, the name now burned into his mind “Malories”.. One more piece to the puzzle fell into place. <br>
<br>
“He’s not here” Draehan’s voice was soft, his vocal cords still not working fully for he had not used them yet.<br>
<br>
“Well when will he be back? I have a score to settle and an arena to run damn it, if he doesn’t show his wrinkled face out here in 15 minuets im making him sorry he ever placed any bets.” <br>
<br>
It was then the images sunk in to the Ogres mind, the normally lavish room was almost empty, the walls black with carbon. What was left of the tapestries hung in taters, the rugs half burnt. He gaped a moment before turning a sharp glare at the robed Tier’Dal.<br>
<br>
“Bandits eh? .. Well this here house owes me a debt and I don’t care whose liven here... you had better pay.”<br>
<br>
“Bandits?.. “ Draehan's whisper of a voice was filled with confusion. “What bandits?”<br>
<br>
“Well if your not here to rob the place when what happened here? Explain boy. “Groganthanos spoke quickly, growing impatient.<br>
<br>
“I don’t know... I’m afraid I can’t tell you anything.” <br>
<br>
The large warrior eyed the young man once more, his patience growing thin.<br>
<br>
“Fine, if you won’t talk then I’ll just take my payment. I could use some fodder for the arena and you’ll fit the bill just fine me thinks.” <br>
<br>
He said nothing more, he didn’t need to. With one swing of his massive club the still weak Tier’Dal was laid out on the floor. It took the Ogre only moments to drag him from the hall and toss him limply in the back of his wagon. Draehan could not hear the words that would have driven fear into any casters mind.<br>
<br>
“The people love a good fight, well see how you do with out your finger wigglen in the area boy. “<br>

<br>
The wagon moved ever on for what seemed like days.  Coming in and out of consciousness Draehan was only half aware of what fate lay at the end of the road. He could only open his eyes for moment before the pounding on his head forced him to retreat into darkness once more. <br>
<br>
“Ahh, here we are!” Groganthanos spoke to himself.<br>
<br>
He pulls the wagon over by the gates of a small stone arena. He jumped from the wagon and lumbered to the back to unload. <br>
<br>
“I’m back! come put this junk away.” He boomed.<br>
<br>
Shortly after 3 Ogre boys trotted out from what looked to be a storage room. The oldest nodded to his father wile the other 2 started picking bags and weapons by what they could carry. Garganthanos lifted the limp Tier’Dal man from the cart by his belt, only needing one hand for the effort.<br>
<br>
“Here take him to the back and see that he’s awake for the fight.” Graganthanos growled, as he tossed the lifeless man at his son.<br>
<br>
“Okeys dad, meas do dat.” <br>
 <br>
                            *                                      *                           * <br>
<br>
Draehan woke with a start as the cold water hit his face, it stung like needles. It took him only seconds to focus, his eyes darting around the cell instinctively looking for an escape. The small jail was only a stone room with bars for a door, blood dirt and urine covered the floor. Draehan stood groggily, the smell of the floor driving him to his feet. He staggered, his wits slowly returning to him. Walking to the gates he could see he was not alone, countless other cells lined the walls, filled with all manner of beats. He shook the bars, testing there strength before giving up completely, he would have to wait for what ever was in store for him.<br>
<br>
Hours passed with nothing, no hint of what fate lay before him. The young man jumped as he heard the faint clank of armor growing closer.<br>
<br>
“You ready to fight boy?” The familiar boom of Groganthanos’s voice shattered the silence.<br>
<br>
He walked to the gates, unlocking and tossing them open. With out a word he grabbed Draehan by the wrist, wrenching him down the hall to a new room. Warriors and fighters of all race and creed lined the walls of the packed room. Sounds of metal clashing with metal as the armored figures shifted and moved was deafening.<br>
<br>
Groganthanos walked to the center of the room and put a massive hand to his mouth “Alright listen up. Tonight’s event is a free for all. Ya fight till ya die, and if ya don’t die ya win the pot, got that?” <br>
<br>
The room grew quiet for a moment before erupting into a roar of cheers and yells. A chant of  “glory for the warlord!” broke out from a small band of Ogres in a back corner.<br>
 <br>
Groganthanos shot a hand up into the air, calling for silence. “The fight starts in a moment, everyone to the arena floor and find your positions.”<br>
<br>
With astonishing obedience the room cleared out, moving in 2 lines to the arena floor where the battle would begin. Draenhan stood dumfounded in the center of the now empting room. This was how he was going to die? His mind raced, he had no weapons, no armor, and no skill in battle. With a fierce shove from his captor he was forced ever closer to the arena floor that spelled his death.<br>
<br>
He stood in the stand of the open arena, his back pressed to one of the walls as he eyed the other fighters closely. His thoughts were not on winning, only on living through the night. There were 10 or so other combatants, all grunting and cheering, convincing them selves of there own bravery. There had to be a way to live through this his mind chanted. The mage scanned the arena, looking for weak spots in armor, flaws in there stance, anything that would give him even a glimmer of a chance. With in seconds a trumpet sounded, he was out of time. <br>
<br>
The roar of battle filled the circular death trap, weapons clashing, screams of pain and anger. He turned just in time to see the mace swing at his face, he was not strong but he was fast. With a quick motion of his head the mace smashed into the stone wall behind him. The mace was in the air once more, enough to crack the skull of an Ogre no less a Tier’Dal, but it never finished its descent. From the right a human’s sword plunged into the troll’s side, just under his arm, causing the troll to whirl around in pain. The human grinned, knowing the wound would cut off the use of the arm that used the mace. Draehan did not stay long enough to see the swing that caused the trolls cry to be cut short, he had to keep moving, to stay out of reach of the others. <br>
<br>
The battle raged on, one by one the fighters fell, blood slowly painting the sand red. There could only be about 5 left, only 5 more to avoid, and if he survived, one would need to die by his hand. He leapt over the body of a barbarian, just avoiding the sword thrust at his head. Only minutes now, just a little longer. His thoughts were cut short as the shield slammed into his chest, tossing the small framed Tier’Dal a good 3 feet. He gasped for air; the shield had caught him off guard and forced the air from his lungs. Draehan looked around desperately, the pain in his chest making it hard to move. It was then he realized how much he looked like the bodies that lay near him, his red robes soaked in the blood as he lay on the ground. This was the answer; this is how he would survive, unmoving, and patient in the sand. The others would not try to kill one who was already dead.<br>
<br>
<br>
The battle lasted for what seemed like hours until all was quiet, one lone troll stood over the body of the last to fall, a human that had put up a good fight. Draehan risked opening only one of his eyes, he needed a weapon. The troll looked around the arena once, his dim mind not catching the faint raise and fall of Draehan's chest. <br>
<br>
“Rahhhhhh! “ The troll’s voice cried out in victory as he turned to face a platform where Groganthanos stood silent. <br>
<br>
The veteran warriors keen eyes could see what the troll could not, the slight movement of the red robes in the center of the area. The troll was quiet a moment, his mind working to understand why he was not being rewarded. Draehan worked quickly, grabbing the shaft of an arrow from the quiver of a near by corpse, the only weapon in reach light enough for the small man to wield. He crept ever closer to the troll, he would not die today... He could not die today.  The lone warrior turned with only enough time to see the crazed mage leap at him with shear desperation, all of his weight forced behind the attack. The troll raised his weapon but it was to late, the arrow head lodged into his eye, forcing its way into his skull. He wailed in pain as his scenes started to dull, the fatal blow numbing his mind. Draehan did not let go, anger and adrenalin welling up inside of him; he pushed on the shaft of the arrow with all of his might, driving it to hit the back of the trolls skull. <br>
<br>
A faint clapping was the only sound that broke the crazed Tier’Dal's attention from the troll that lay at his feet. As he looked up Groganthanos saluted him with a quick thrust to his breastplate. <br>
<br>
“Well done boy. I didn’t expect this outcome at all.” With a quick motion of his hand the eldest son appeared at his side. “Go see that this man is cleaned up and bring him to my office” <br>
<br>
With that said he turned to leave his boys to finish up the work, remove the bodies from the arena and fetch the winner of the battle...<br>

As he watched the three boys run about the room, biting and punching, pretending to be fighters in the arena, he couldn’t help but think how long he had been here. To him life was still new; he only had a memories of about 6 years. Four, he had been here for four years now, working for a place to sleep and food to eat. With that thought he rose to his feet, it was time to move on. He had been hiding from it long enough, it was time to go home and figure out his meaning... <br>
                 *                      *                      * <br>
<br>
Entering the old halls the memories of fear and confuses flashed in his mind as if they were only days past.<br>
<br>
“This place is a wreck...” He spoke to himself, his voice an eerie echo on the bare walls.<br>
<br>
The room was just as he left it, half burnt and charred. Blackened furniture and tapestries lined the stone walls. The dining hall and study were much worse; the fire had died as it reached the main hall. As always the only place to rest was the main bed chambers, untouched by the fire. Draehan ran his hand along the wall, feeling for the place he tucked the notes four years past.<br>
<br>
“I know it was... “ his voice was cut short as a small click opened the hidden panel. “here.”<br>
<br>
He pulled out the notes but did not look them over; he knew what they said already. Placing them on the desk his glance fell to the door and the room past. The keep had once been the old wizards home and Draehan would now make it his. Much of the wood had been destroyed but simple things such as that were replaceable. The money from the arena would be enough to rebuild what was lost.<br>
<br>
                 *                                             *                                  * <br>
<br>
Draehan sat in the main hall at his desk finishing off the last of his work. A wooden plaque that would soon hang over the door of the entrance... “Fireforge keep” <br>
