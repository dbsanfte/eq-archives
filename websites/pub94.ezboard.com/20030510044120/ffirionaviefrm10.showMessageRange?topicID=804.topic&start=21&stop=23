Even with the mask Kyri knew whose face lay behind it which confirmed her own suspicisions that Maelgroth was indeed one of the Waes'Harventhar. She sensed something when her &quot;uncle&quot; greeted him upon his arrival, some whispered conversation with meaning to only the two of them no doubt. Of course, as expected, Nystyre briefly looked towards her in case she did not recognize Maelgroth herself.<br>
<br>
   Mingling for a bit with the noblity to not be too obvious in her actions, a chore to be sure dealing with generally empty headed nobles who thought that mere birth granted greatness.<br>
 The matron of the Chath’elg’Caress was another reason why Kyri was glad she was not nobly born. As if a marriage bond interested her in the slightest, unless of course a great deal of platinum was involved. Kyri briefly felt bad for those noble daughters forced to wed because of some alliance or deal necessitated it. Soon enough she watched as the matron went to maelgroth next before the sounds of luaghter drove her from the field so to speak.<br>
<br>
   When the time came, Kyri decided to make her way to Maelgroth and discuss things. She knew he saw her for their eyes locked briefly as she watched the masked stranger  holding court with the member of house Ragar’Golhyrr. Soon after he went to see the lady Athava and chatted briefly which seemed to Kyri to have done well for Maelgroth left the guest of honor in a much better mood than when he first greeted her. Seeing him prepare to leave Kyri slipped out another way to meet him outside for a chance to speak privately. The time for comparing notes seemed to be right.<br>
<br>
  He saw her, she knew he did but oddly he appeared uncomfortable as she drew near. Before she could speak he vanished. <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>What spooked him?</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> she thought, knowing that her mere presence shouldn't have done so. It was one thing to have people say someone was intimidated by another's beauty but this was a bit much. With Maelgroth gone, Kyri knew she had best return inside before she was noticed to be missing.<br>
<br>
  Back inside she caught her &quot;uncle's&quot; eye and the two of them stepped out into another room briefly.<br>
<br>
  &quot;Well, what did you discover?&quot; Nystyre asked<br>
<br>
  &quot;Nothing actually.&quot; Kyri replied &quot;I managed to find him alone but as i came near to speak with him he used his magic to vanish to who knows where. I didn't have a chance to say a thing.&quot;<br>
<br>
  &quot;Hmm, that's very odd. This one did not seem the type to flee at the sight of a woman if he is indeed what he claims to be.&quot; Nystyre said. &quot;Well then if he is gone you may as well make some use of yourself the rest of the night and see what the other houses are up to since you scared off your main objective. But come 'neice' our guests are surely missing us by now.&quot;<br>
<br>
  Taking his arm, the two of them returned to the main hall. As Nystyre went back to his own duties Kyri found herself the sole remaining novelty of the event with Maelgroth having left. Several old women of various houses couldn't believe they had not heard of a branch of the D'vir clan in Mistmoore. The young men were even more attentive at her arrival, though most failed to raise their eyes above chest level when speaking to her, until she grabbed one from the Chath'elg'caress - perhaps the same one the matron spoke of earlier, by the hair and raised his eyes to hers while smiling sweetly with a cold glint in her eyes and saying &quot;When someone won't look me in the eye when speaking to me, I find it rather insulting. I would be happy to show you some of the techniques Mayong Mistmoore taught me to deal with insults if you continue this.&quot;<br>
<br>
   At the mention of the dark power of Mistmoore, the Chath'elg'caress's eyes grew wide as he stammered an apology and promptly thought of somewhere else he had to be. For some reason after this, the rest of the young men around her had pressing business to take care of as well and the crowd around her dispersed. To be sure some of the older noblemen smiled upon hearing the comment- the youth of today DID need to be shaken in their belief of their own superiority every now and then. This neice of Nystyre's seemed to be doing the job quite well.<br>
<br>
  &quot;Perhaps I should ask your uncle to lend you to my house for a time. You seem to be routing the Chath'elg'caress fairly well tonight.&quot; Ayon'daro stated as he drew close.<br>
<br>
  &quot;Well, to be honest they don't seem to be much of a challenge. I'm surprised they have risen as high as they have if this is the best they can muster.&quot; Kyri replied.<br>
<br>
  &quot;Yes, the old witch is on her way out I hear. You'd best be careful here Lady K'yari, its been said hired knives are cutting down many of the noblity. After tonight you may have an enemy or two.&quot; Ayon'daro warned<br>
<br>
  &quot;Hired knifes? My uncle's estates here are well defended. It would take a truly skilled killer to break in, and those would be expensive.&quot; Kyri answered.<br>
<br>
  Smiling Ayon'daro teased &quot;Oh really? What would someone so far away from the politics of Neriak know of the hiring of killers and their fees.&quot;<br>
<br>
   Cursing to herself at her slip Kyri quickly answered &quot;Well how else could a lone outpost in the middle of the weak elf lands stand? Military leaders need to be removed, strong rulers slain. Just because we are isolated does not mean we are ignorant my Lord Aton'daro.&quot;<br>
<br>
   &quot;True enough,&quot; Ayon'daro admitted, &quot;It must be terrible being stranded out there so far from court. Perhaps you could convince your uncle to let you stay here a time. You'll find things are much more interesting here.&quot;<br>
<br>
  &quot;Perhaps, we shall see.&quot; Kyri said, then changing the subject. &quot;My Lord, what did you think of that stranger with the mask, a most mysterious sort he seemed to me, and vanished just as quickly as he arrived. When I saw his arrival I almost thought this was to be a costume party and me without my mask.&quot;<br>
<br>
   Chuckling Ayon'daro said, &quot;That one is an odd one, if I could see his face I am certain i could place him and his house. As it stands he does seem familiar but I can not tell from where. At any rate he appears to be a foe of the Fire Hags which makes him good enough in my book. Why do you ask?&quot;<br>
<br>
  &quot;Oh I had the same difficulty, I thought I knew of all the houses here but that one was unfamiliar, even my uncle mentioned little of him. I had thought that one who had been around neriak longer than I might be able to answer this question for me but it seems we share the same puzzle.&quot; Kyri answered.<br>
<br>
  At that Ayon'daro took his leave of Kyri and mingled elsewhere, lest some see the two speaking overmuch and think some sort of alliance was in the works. The rest of the night was uneventful a few folk spoke of the masked stranger in the halls, but none had a clue who he was or which side he was on. Eventually the guests departed and Kyri was again alone with Nystyre.<br>
<br>
  &quot;Well I suppose I'll need this guise again for the actural ascension. Perhaps my good looks won't frighten him as much next time.&quot; Kyri mused after she passed along the tidbits of gossip she had picked up on.<br>
<br>
   &quot;A different dress of course&quot; Nystyre replied &quot; a lady of House D'vir would not be caught wearing the same dress twice to any formal gathering. But yes, this Waes'Harventhar does need watching, one who would take such pride in a whispered mention of his fallen house's name would certainly wish to make their mark here. It will be interesting to see what his next move shall be. But until then we shall continue to watch.&quot;<br>
<br>
   Soon after Kyri made her way from the estate, back in the comfort of her own gear, all that pampering in the estate would make her soft and vulnerable if she had to deal with it on a regular basis. <br>
<br>
   But the question of Maelgroth still remained. She was holding out on D'vir as it stood. Nothing had been said to him of the old woman or the priestess as yet. Plus Maelgroth seemed to panic when she approached him at the party. Was he lacking nerve? In over his head perhaps? Using magic to leave was a bit overdoing things, he might be less confident than she had first thought, thus the mask? To hide his fears?<br>
<br>
  Better to wait a bit longer, she decided, let him make his next play and see how it turns out. If his fear was a sign of weakness then he'll be devoured by his foes, if it was a temporary lapse then there is still hope for him. Still a helpful hint or two might be in order.<br>
<br>
   The next day Naelaelayle found a note in their old shack in the Foreign Quarter, as she still visited the old place from time to time to keep up the appearance of habitation to any watching eyes. It was sealed in wax but no house emblem was seen. A name was on the outside. Maelgroth.<br>
<br>
    Returning quickly to their quarters in the League halls, she gave the note to Maelgroth who openned it and read the brief note inside as a platinum coin fell to the floor as the note was openned.<br>
<br>
   &quot;A truth seeker can almost see the truth through the mask. Caution in word and deed might be prudent. A great house watches and waits but its chief eyes lay in the Shadows. Time has been bought, and further assistance might be given.&quot;<br>

It did not take long for Maelgroth to decipher the message. Discrete inquiries resulted in the identity of the author being revealed.<br>
<br>
“Tell me brother, what do you know of Kyri?” Maelgroth asked his brother Malingrad, they were meeting in the old shack where the note had first been found.<br>
<br>
“She is a talented assassin.” Malingrad replied carefully. Was his brother preparing to replace him after his failure at house security.<br>
<br>
“Better than you?”<br>
<br>
“Her skills are becoming legendary, as is her unusual devotion to platinum.”<br>
<br>
“So she is a mercenary?” the young necromancer growled.<br>
<br>
“Hardly, though she does work for pay, she is quite selective, from what I hear.” Malingrad was watching his brother closely, he had grown in power very quickly and the rogue doubted he would survive a fight with his younger half brother. “Would you like me to seek her out?”<br>
<br>
“I don’t think your services will be necessary for this task, I have another mission for you, one more suited for your skills. It is time we prepare to move against House Sol’Calar (the Eye Eaters). As you know they live in 2nd gate inside our first ancestral home. They are a quiet house, rarely taking part in vendetta and politics.” Maelgroth carefully handed a scroll case to Malingrad.<br>
<br>
“Inside are the original blueprints to the house. I am sure there have been some changes, but perhaps a few of our secrets remain undiscovered. Scout out this house and return with information concerning their security.”<br>
<br>
“I will obey.” Malingrad replied in the old tongue. He was sure he was being sent to his death. The mission was too easy. As he stood up to leave his brother called out to him.<br>
<br>
“Be careful, we are close to our goal.”<br>
<br>
After his brother left, Maelgroth gated back to his quarters.<br>
<br>
“I have sent Malingrad to scout the Sol’Calar. That should keep him busy.” <br>
<br>
“Good, tell me more of this Vynna K’yari.” His mother chirped.<br>
<br>
She had not stopped chittering about how a cousin of mighty hose D’Vir had taken an interest in her son. Maelgroth was beginning to regret asking her advice on this matter, especially in light of recent events. He could tell the old woman was dying to gossip with someone about the doings of her house, they were so close and she had waited a very long time.<br>
<br>
“I am more concerned with our vengeance, there will be time for alliances after our victory.”<br>
<br>
“Of course you are right.” She conceded. “You have a task for me?”<br>
<br>
“The Fire Hags are loosing too quickly, the Ragar’Golhyrr are too strong for them.” Maelgroth began. This was a dangerous and risky mission. “I need you to get a carriage, similar to those used by House D’Vir and I need you to arrange an incident.”<br>
<br>
“A bold move.” Naelaelayle replied. “Do you intend to duplicate the blazon of house D’Vir as well?”<br>
<br>
“It won’t be necessary, we won’t be angering House D’Vir.”<br>
<br>
“I will have things arranged in a few hours.” His mother said, leaving the room.<br>
<br>
As soon as he was alone, he cloaked himself in shadow and headed upstairs. It was with some trepidation he approached her door.<br>
<br>
The door opened before he could knock.<br>
<br>
“Kyri?” Maelgroth whispered. The room was dark, but with his vision he could see the table and chairs as well as the battered targets on the wall, many still with throwing knives sunk into their centers.<br>
<br>
“Took you long enough.” A voice whispered back, from behind him.<br>
<br>
“Well, I have been busy, Vynna K’yari.”<br>
<br>
“If we continue to call each other by our aliases we will be standing in the hall all night, won’t you come in, we have much to discuss.”<br>
<br>
As he shuffled carefully into the room he saw, Kyri pop into view in one of the chairs, somehow she had ghosted past him as he passed through the doorway. He noticed she took the chair farthest from the door, it also had its back to the wall.<br>
<br>
“I have disarmed the traps you are most likely to trip, don’t do anything unexpected and you will be fine.”<br>
<br>
“So, which of us is caught up in the other’s business?” Maelgroth began, cutting directly to the reason he had come. “Are you working an angle with House D’Vir? If so I will not tip your hand.”<br>
<br>
“There is no angle with that one, at this time. He merely asked me to make some inquiries as to the identity of a certain house guest.”<br>
<br>
Malegroth had grown up in the alleyways of the foreign quarter. He knew what was coming next. “So, how much does he know, and how much do you want?”<br>
<br>
“He knows your house is attempting to make a comeback, he knows you were behind the fall of Vlos’Shannaal and he suspects your hand in the war between the Chath’elg’Caress and the Ragar’Golhyrr.”<br>
<br>
“Who else knows?”<br>
<br>
“I have told no one else.” She could see the necromancer considering his options. He could attempt to silence her permanently. That was the least likely and possible. He could attempt to bribe her, but he must know there is no way his house could compete against the coffers of house D’Vir. Or he could simply ignore the matter.<br>
<br>
“So what do you want?” He asked again.<br>
<br>
“I don’t really know, at the moment I am enjoying my view of events. I will have to share some additional information with Nystyre soon.”<br>
<br>
“I am sure you will, what does he know about you?”<br>
<br>
‘Nice try, kid.’ Kyri thought to herself. “He knows more than you would think.”<br>
<br>
“As you know we are a poor house, with little to offer at the moment.”<br>
<br>
“Indeed.” She agreed, curious to see what he would come up with. A promise of future support would be valuable, but had no tangible value at the moment.<br>
<br>
“What would you say if we were to offer you the chance to examine, up close, and under supervision the workings of a greater house vault?”<br>
<br>
Kyri had been itching to get the chance to look at one for years, and seeing the Waes’Harventhar vault in the shack those many months ago had only whetted her appetite.<br>
<br>
“Under supervision eh?”<br>
<br>
“There is no other way for me to vouch for your safety. My mother will know if anything goes missing and, as you know the chest is sentient after a fashion.” Maelgroth knew he had her interest.<br>
<br>
“Well it is a relic of a bygone era, it might be worth looking at for novelty reasons.” Kyri smiled, the chance to spend some time studying one of these legendary chests, why the knowledge gained from such a visit would be invaluable. Sure there were few such chests left, but all were considered to be nearly impregnable.<br>
<br>
Now it was Maelgroth’s turn to smile.<br>
<br>
‘Nicely played.’ Kyri thought. Now she was going to offer something of value. “What do you want?”<br>
<br>
“I suppose it would be ok if you told Nystyre a bit more, perhaps something about my membership in the lodge of the dead, possibly my presence within the League and if you must my name.” Maelgroth replied carefully.<br>
<br>
“Yes, that’s really nothing, what do you really want?”<br>
<br>
“You can assist me tonight in our vendetta, it will be a small thing, easily done by one with your skills and present you with nearly no risk.”<br>
<br>
“Tell me more...”<br>
<br>
That evening….<br>
<br>
<br>
“I can’t believe I let him talk me into this!” Kyri hissed as she slithered out of the exquisite dress Nystyre had given her for the evening ascension. The equipment she had selected for this caper she had not worn in years, but she was glad it still fit. She had stashed the gear on the borders of the D’Vir manse and then submitted to an hour of pampering at the hands of Vil’Kev’s assistants. She had promised Nystyre she would have some information for him after the party, already the carriages bearing the D’Vir house crest and crewed by animated skeletons would be prowling the city collecting the guests for the affair. She would have to hurry.<br>
<br>
Maelgroth and Jabaner sat a few blocks away from the Ragar’Golhyrr manse, the carriage was a perfect match of the ornate teak carriages used by house D’Vir. It did not bear the all seeing eye crest of that house, instead it was decorated with the severed heads of  Chath’elg’Caress members. <br>
<br>
“Where did you get these?” Kyri whispered.<br>
<br>
“They are trophies of Malingrad’s.” Maelgroth replied distractedly.<br>
<br>
“He works for you?” Kyri giggled, suddenly understanding the attitude of the young rogue she had seen some time back at the Ebon Mask.<br>
<br>
“He is a member of our house.” Maelgroth laughed. “Ok, we only get one chance at this so we have to make it look good. Remember Kill Jabaner here not me!”<br>
<br>
“Not a problem.”<br>
<br>
Maelgroth cast a spell and the flesh melted away from his bones, leaving a giggling skeleton, nearly identical to the one standing next to him.<br>
<br>
“Problem.”<br>
<br>
“I will be driving, Jabaner will be hanging onto the back.” Maelgroth replied, climbing into his position on the coach. The other skeleton followed, climbing onto the place usually occupied by the footman. With a clatter the carriage took off for the Ragar’Golhyrr manse. Kyri trotted along, hidden in the shadows, awaiting her moment.<br>
<br>
As the carriage approached the front gates the guards recognized the carriage, they had been waiting for it, and saw what they expected to see, they cheered their delight as they opened the gate when they was the heads decorating the sides.<br>
<br>
“You will Pay for your Treachery!” Kyri hissed, blossoming out of the shadows and striking at Jabaner. She deliberately pulled her blows to give the skeleton a chance to fight back. She clambered onto the back of the carriage, still trading blows with the skeleton and attempted to force her way inside. Maelgroth quickened the pace and the horses galloped towards the mansion. The gate guards rushed to intercept the assassin.<br>
<br>
“Look out, the Chath’elg’Caress attack!” one shouted striking an ineffectual blow at Kyri who paused a moment to finish off Jabaner before vanishing once again into the shadows.<br>
“Damn assassins, don’t have the guts to face a real fighter!” another hissed, sheathing his sword and allowing the carriage to pass.<br>
<br>
Lord Ayon’daro watched the altercation carefully, he wondered at first why the Fire Hags would be so desperate to attack one of D’Vir’s carriages, when he saw the decorations, suddenly he understood. He snickered to himself as he strode out the front gate and slipped into the carriage. His house must be doing better than he thought if one of the great houses was publicly allying themselves.<br>
<br>
As they passed through the outer gates of his manor he waved to his guards. ‘Those men should get a bonus for driving off that assassin.’ He thought. As they took the road towards the Temple of Innoruuk he thought how nice it would be to arrive at the D’Vir manse in a carriage decorated with the heads of his enemies. Why he even recognized a few of them.<br>
<br>
The thought jarred him. He had paid for the deaths of most of the decorations on the cart. There was no way house D’Vir would take contracts like a common assassin. Something was wrong. Hurriedly he looked around, no where was the blazon of the D’Vir visible.<br>
<br>
“Driver, Stop the Carriage Now!” Ayon’daro shouted.<br>
<br>
The vehicle sped up, now it was racing along the road, he could see the temple approaching across its moat. He could hear chanting coming from the driver’s compartment.<br>
<br>
“You won’t catch me that easily! He screamed. With a series of powerful kicks he broke the door and leapt out, aiming for the moat, it was deep and would protect him from being crushed on the road.<br>
<br>
He landed with a titanic splash, the impact literally drove him to the bottom. He had nothing to worry about, he was a strong swimmer and close to the temple, he would survive. How typical of the Chath’elg’Caress and desperate.<br>
<br>
Suddenly, he realized he was rooted to the bottom of the moat. He thrashed about wildly desperate to escape, after a while the moved no more.<br>
<br>
The chanting stopped, and the cart moved on, at a more sedate pace, as Lord Ayon'Daro drowned he could see the broken door flapping wildly as the carriage moved away.<br>

She should really be getting back to the D'vir estate before she was missed. Then again there was that guard's comment as she left that had to be addressed. <br>
<br>
  <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>&quot;Too afraid to face a real guard?&quot; I think not</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> she thought to herself. It was annoying to have to fiegn flight before such ill trained guards. Of all the guards only one actually managed to even draw a sword before she had all but gotten into the carriage. Now they will have to be punished for their arrogance, after all she did have her reputation to think of if anyone managed to identify her. Drunken guards boasting of how they drove off Kyri Velkyn would certain lower the asking price of anyone seeking to hire her in the future. So the guards had to be dealt with.<br>
<br>
 There were four in all, the two at the main gate on the outside and two others just inside. The real trouble would be avoiding the bloodshed, after all D'Vir would get a bit suspicious if she returned all splattered in blood. <br>
<br>
  The two at the gate were congratulating themselves on a job well done and not even close to paying attention as they should. The assassin had been driven off and they were the heros of the night. The younger of the two, as Kyri suspected, had been a bit nervous about the prospect of a fight- no doubt why he was banished to exterior duty. So it was only moments before the guard wandered off to the bushes to relieve himself while his partner kept watch. Unfortunately he chose the place where Kyri was hiding, her garrotte itching to be used. Slipping behind him she strangled him as he was unable to call for help and the shaking of the bushes failed to alert his partner, who merely thought the youngster didn't have the stomach for the work and was puking his guts up in the bushes.<br>
<br>
 After the bushes fell silent and the guard failed to return, his companion now grew suspicious and warily made his way to the bush where his partner was last seen. <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>If that pup fainted on me i'll have his head.</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> the veteran thought to himself as he grew near. Suddenly he heard a whistling sound through the air and fell to the ground as the throwing star struck him cleanly in the throat. As he gurgled his life's blood away Kyri slipped out from the other side of the bushes and took some rope out of her packs. <br>
<br>
The inner guards would be checking up on their companions shortly, she knew from her observations earlier before the carriage arrived. So she only had a short time to prepare. Sure enough, a muffled call met by silence brought the openning of the side gate where a third guard stepped outside looking for the two who failed to answer his call. At the sight of the guard lying in a pool of blood near the bushes he made a quick call to within and his partner also stepped outside. The moment he did so a pair of nooses droppeded around both their necks from above where Kyri had balanced herself at the top of the wall while staying out of sight from the other side before she stood and readied the nooses when the second guard was called.<br>
<br>
  Before the guards could react, Kyri leapt off the wall inside the estate holding onto the ropes in each hand. Now while she wasn't heavy enough to drag the guards up the wall while she descended, the suddenness of her action and the the fact she gave herself half the length of the wall additional rope to work with drew the nooses tight around the guards necks and with two sickening cracks, the guards' brief struggles came to an abrupt end as Kyri's weight added by the time spent falling proved to be enough force to break their necks.<br>
<br>
   At the sound of the cracks, Kyri dropped to the ground and slipped out the still open side gate before anyone else could react. Checking the guards she found the two who were hung lying on the ground, their heads at odd angles , as dead as the other two she dispatched only minutes before.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>So much for fear eh?</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> Kyri thought to herself as she gazed down at one of the guards at her feet, the one who had made the comment as she left the area after the 'assassination' attempt.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Well NOW I feel better. Guess its time to go back and get a bit more pampering before the ascension. If anyone says anything, well, i just needed some air.</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> Kyri thought as she slipped back into the night, making her way to the D'Vir estates. After all this ascension would be one talked about for months to come she was sure. And Kyri had a front row seat for it.<br>
