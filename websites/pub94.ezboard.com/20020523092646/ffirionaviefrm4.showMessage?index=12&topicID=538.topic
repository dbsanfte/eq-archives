To me, the level of the characters is not the issue.  Both parties had a right to the camp.  Neither party had an exclusive right to dominate the camp for four hours.<br>
<br>
<br>
&lt;&lt;If there are newbies around, I just toss my spiffy little damage shield on them instead&gt;&gt;<br>
<br>
Stunning the mob works well, too.  No damage, so you can't steal credit for the kill, it stobs the mob from attacking or running temporarily, so it helps the newbie, and you'll both get the faction hit.  Or you can wait until the mob is well below half health and kill it, but I prefer Stun, as it is so much less likely to worry the newbie that maybe you are trying to kill-steal.  When I played a monk, I would throw a single shuriken at the mob. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ueliezeroferudin.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Eliezer of Erudin</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 538<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(4/14/02 11:00:21 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=538.topic&index=13>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: /rude guild.</span><hr size=1> I am neutral on this account too few details.

As to the Deathfist Belts and Faction - you can turn them in in two places.

Second there are two different quests you can do with those belts to repair faction. One lowers the guard faction the other raises it. You can do both in wolf form and not be KoS (is you are already KoS).<br>
<br>
Third, I have no idea why this high level person would be such an ass, but I wouldnt dismiss the whole server just because of this one person.<br>
<br>
Verant has no way of enforcing the &quot;role play&quot; part of the FV server. Its simply a suggestion. Many people play on this server for alot of different reasons despite what Verant may have wanted the server to be used for.<br>
<br>
Bottom line is no matter where you are you will run into people you dont agree with. The only thing that matters is how you decide to behave here... and hopefully that will eventually result in your being happy here.<br>

First of all, at 51 he was obviously not there for experience, which means he was there for one of three reasons: 1) to PL an alt; 2) loot; 3) faction. If it was (1), then you can think of it as his other level=appropriate character was there, and you have no more right to the camp than he does. I consider #2 very doubtful. And #3 can be done in cooperative fashion. I've done that myself when I was bored, but I did it by buffing the people there, then debuffing the mobs for them to make them easier to kill (and thus getting me my faction hit).<br>
<br>
This server is no absolute haven from the inconsiderate. There are probably fewer such people here, but they certainly do exist, as you have seen. The good thing about this server is that reputation does mean something, and when people screw other people over, just spread the word. This may not have a tangible noticeable effect immediately, but over time it does make a difference.<br>

The faction hits for knights of truth are small but after enough you can get anyone non kos to nfp doing orcs and the belts can repair faction with the malitia (and not lose nfp faction by alternating btwn the 2 quests).<br>
<br>
The only reason I can see anyone being there is for that reason. I got an iskar necro to dubious in both nfp and wfp/efp doing that. The only place he was KoS in FP was the bard and cleric guild.<br>
<br>
As far as where else the person could have gone? Well same goes for the other player. I am not defending this person btw. I think he was pretty rude to. But it seems to me he has as much right to be there as anyone else... he should have just been a little more diplomatic about how he handled the situation.<br>

<br>
Secondly...  I will say I have been one of the offenders of this so called &quot;Farming&quot; of the orc camps in the past, but not to this situation.<br>
<br>
My story is...  I am an Iksar Shaman.  Being one of &quot;evil&quot; lieniage, I have few places to rest my weary bones on those long treks from my homeland, Cabilis.  So, one of the simple solutions is to become friendly with the residence of Freeport.  Also, part of epic quest involves traveling in this ilgotten place of the softskins.<br>
<br>
Personally, I just sit and slaughter the camp..  preferably the one to the west in West Commons.  No need for me to loot the carcasses..  I have no place to bank and the copper was/isn't worth my trouble to get off my arse and risk loosing my camp.  Besides, I figure the youngens could use the pennies to upgrade thier attire, and they can have all the belts to thier hearts content.<br>
<br>
Now then, I have come across quite a few youngens who were grateful at my scraps and were curious as to my doings.  Great conversations and I educated them in the why's &quot;a bear&quot; is slaugtering orcs, besides despising those orcs for ruining the softskins lands.  Some have asked if they could steal some of the perpitrators, I always reply, &quot;if you can snag one from my pet, you are more than welcome&quot; (I have a 1st level, 5pt nuke, for faction tag and buffs/heals work too.)  But the latter is so time consuming (PLing), when my pet can slaughter the camp in minutes and I have been here a week already (weigh those factors).<br>
<br>
Then again, I have run into those select few that would attempt to &quot;evict me&quot;.  If they come up to me and say, &quot; Exuse me, all the other camps are taken, may my group have this camp?&quot;  I would comply and sit on the sidelines.  Now, if they come up and say, &quot;Dood!  Your farming!  Get out!&quot;  Guess what?  And this has happened.<br>
<br>
This reminds me of the time I was doing my fourth shawl in EW, on a blue server...  When I was trying to trigger Tanik.  I had to zone from the Death Squads.  When I came back a druid had taken the middle of the ramp and claimed that he had the Tanik Camp and that I had no right to it.  I obviously saw he did not know what he was doing (because the spoiler gives wrong info).  So, I continued about my bussiness.  But, because he had a mob charmed, my pet kept looking at his pet.  Well, he got irate after I pulled a DS in his general direction after /shouting knowing he was threre (yes, I am still curtious, even to jerks).  He then goes off on those colorful discriptions about my lieniage and other forms of name calling.  Well, when his frustrations got the best of him and he decided to leave, guess who spawned?  Takes about nine DSes, FYI.  I have done that darned quest so many times now &lt;frown&gt;.<br>
<br>
Moral of the story...<br>
<br>
We did not design the game and we are not exploting any rules (faction farming).  If you feel the need to talk to someone about thier behaviour, talk to them, don't threaten nore become irrate.  I have as much time playing as you do, folks.<br>

And yes deathfist slashed belts are great for power leveling.  If you take a dark elf you can get them up to 6 real quick and easy with wine quest and then with enough belts up to 15 or so within a few minutes.  Severe lack of skills but oh well. <p>Zsuzsana Dracul

However, orcs are about one of the slowest ways to fix faction with FP.  Smart faction fixers use Tumpy Tonics or (a bit slower) buy scalps from newbies in HPH.  Starting from scowly with a full pack of 160 tonics, Mo became non-KoS over all of FP and still has over 100 tonics in the bank.  Total time for this faction work?  About 2H.  Only an idiot farms belts for FP faction.<br>
<br>
On the camp issue, I feel like most, though.  Level doesn't matter.  If he's keeping the spawn down, the camp is his.  He owns it for as long as he cares to keep spawn down.  Whether or not it's worth owning is a separate issue.  PnP only applies to GMs.  PnP is the only viable way for GMs to settle disputes.  It's not what most players use.  <br>
<br>
Most players use FCFS on camps.  The unfortunate part about PnP is it permits KS'ers to call in a GM to KS a camp for them.  The bad part about FCFS is when players rotate in a group to keep a spawn exclusive after the originals have long gone.  For the most part, though, FCFS works a lot better than PnP, which is why the players use it.  KS'ing a camp, whether you do it yourself or with a GM is just plain rude, greedy, and shows no respect or concern for the effort put in by the group already camping. <p>Mosushi, Lizard Master of the Fish<br>
