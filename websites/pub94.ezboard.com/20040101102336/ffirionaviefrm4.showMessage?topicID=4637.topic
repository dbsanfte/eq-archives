My electric bill!!!!</span><hr size=1> Ok. I do not know what the hell is going on here but something HAS to be wrong.<br>
<br>
I have had the most abnormal electric bill -EVER-.<br>
<br>
It is higher than I have ever had for an electric bill, even when I was living with my roomate last winter with the -gas- heater going all day and my oscilating electric heater fan going all day, and my computer going all day.<br>
<br>
I think the highest I've ever had was around 60 something dollars then, and around 350 Killowats in a month, total.<br>
<br>
Thats when I was shocked, amazed and stunned all at the same time when I opened my bill for last month and found out that I owed 95 dollars, and  that 778 killowats had been used.<br>
<br>
Um. WHAT THE FUCK??<br>
<br>
I live alone now. I'm not home. I still leave my computer on all day, but not every day.<br>
<br>
I think one time this month I left the oven on for a few hours longer than I should of -- but um, most people do that multiple times in a month making huge meals. Oh, and I used my oscilating heater fan a few times.<br>
<br>
Last month, I used 108 killowats in 18 days.<br>
<br>
I just went and read my meter this morning. Since the 4th of December (which is when they read the meter) If I read the meter right, I've supposedly used 259 killowats??<br>
Thats only 8 days!!<br>
<br>
WHAT the hell is going on here??<br>
<br>
The only, and I repeat, ONLY thing I have done differently (and yes I realize I just moved, and am living in a new apartment) is turned on the electric heat in the apartment. There's a wall unit thermostat, and it powers the baseboard heater in the living room. The bedroom heater I only started using this last week because I couldn't turn the knob. The entryway also has its own baseboard heater. But these things were set around 65/68 degrees and turn themselves off when the room is warm enough.<br>
<br>
The lady on the phone at the electric company told me the highest the electricity has ever run in that apartment was 500 something killowats in a month. The last person that lived there was more than one person.<br>
<br>
So, someone help me out here before I start to cry and rip my hair out. What the fuck can possibly be going on here? I'm so confused. I'm very upset, and very stressed out. I cannot see how I am using soo many killowats per month (25 average per day??). And I can in no way afford 95 dollars a month.<br>
<br>
But how the heck can I find out what is draining the electricty? What recourse I have?<br>
<br>
I'm very upset about this. I can't seem to think of much else.<br>
<br>
I'm going to be hurting for money if it keeps up, and I'm going to HAVE to move if it persists because there's no way I can afford this abnormal rate.<br>
<br>
Is it possible someone elses apartment is hooked up to my meter in addition to mine, because it sure as hell seems like the electricity output of a huge household and not one person living alone in her apartment <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :( --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/frown.gif ALT=":("><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :( --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/frown.gif ALT=":("><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :( --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/frown.gif ALT=":("><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :( --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/frown.gif ALT=":("><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

My electric bill!!!!</span><hr size=1> There is a way to test it.  Turn everything off in your apartment and unplug it all as well (this includes your refrigerator).  Use no electricity for an hour or two and check your meter before and after you do.  If there has been an increase and you are absolutely certain that you have had no electricity use (remember that if something is plugged in like a VCR, a microwave, or other things that use power even when not turned on, you'll still have an increase) then perhaps you have something to ask the apartment manager about.<br>
<br>
I have to say that those apartment heaters, especially the ones that are in the floor/ceiling, use lots of electricity.  Because of that, we use space heaters even though we have the heaters built into the floor.  The same thing goes for air conditioners.<br>
<br>
In any case, I hope you do find out what the problem is and can correct it. <p><!--EZCODE CENTER START--><div style="text-align:center"><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://www.leagueofhonour.com/images/members/oligith.jpg"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--><!--EZCODE BR START--><br /><!--EZCODE BR END-->Sage Koada'dal Coercer of the 65th Circle<!--EZCODE BR START--><br /><!--EZCODE BR END--><!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>  Elf of Many Faces</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><!--EZCODE BR START--><br /><!--EZCODE BR END--><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=425188">Equipment</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--> | <!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.geocities.com/lsteim/OgHist.html">Stories</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--></div><!--EZCODE CENTER END--></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showUserPublicProfile?gid=tormalin>Tormalin</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 92<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(12/12/03 12:11 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=4637.topic&index=4>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_supermad.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: WTF? My electric bill!!!!</span><hr size=1> It's possible one of the heaters is damaged somehow, that it's costing much more electricity than it ought to. You should go over all the devices, check how fast the meter runs when they're active.<br>
<br>
Also, have you considered having the meter itself checked? It's a thing. Things break sometimes. Unless your computer is a mainframe, I wouldn't expect it to be the thing racking up the power bill like that. (actually, the power cost would be rather shocking if it were)<br>
<br>
First thing to do to check out would be to deactivate every device completely, and see if the meter is still running. If someone is tapping into your grid, it'll be easy enough to notice the meter still running. If it stops completely, then it's something being broken, one of your appliances, or the meter itself. If it doesn't stop, you have a leak somewhere, and it doesn't have to be a nefarious neighbour at all, but you should mention that to your landlord. Bad wiring can burn the place down, after all.<br>
<br>
There's a lot of possible causes, don't fret over it, you'll figure it out and lower the bill. Speaking of which, my heating needs a new thermostat... This one's on autopilot.<br>

<br>
This past summer I noticed my own electric bill went through the roof. Well, after some investigating, I discovered the problem. When the landlord put in new washing machines and dryers in the basement, his handyman accidently plugged them in to my power, and not the building's main. It could be something like that. (And I never knew that I had an outlet in basement connected to my own power hehe. I am glad the landlord was honest and pointed out the mistake).<br>
<br>
Well, good luck to you.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showUserPublicProfile?gid=aglaranniaspellweaver>Aglarannia Spellweaver</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 10<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(12/12/03 12:39 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=4637.topic&index=6>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_supermad.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: WTF? My electric bill!!!!</span><hr size=1> Like one person suggested above, unplug everything.  Or better yet, flip the breakers or pull the fuses out of the electrical panel box.  Cut off all power and then check the meter outside.  If it's still spinning, there's a problem with the meter and you need to contact your electric company to have them repair it.<br>
<br>
They could also be reading your meter incorrectly or it's possible that someone else could be hooked up to your meter.  If you're living in a multi-unit building, the meters are frequently all together.   If the identifying tags have been moved around somehow, you could be charged for someone else's usage.  <br>
<br>
It's not unheard of for these meter rooms to be left unlocked and people to change tags or make modifications so they receive &quot;free&quot; electric.  It could even be a couple of kids that were playing around.<br>
<br>
Your electric company should have on record the usage levels for the past several years.  You can request a copy of these levels and compare them with your current usage.  <br>
<br>
Another thought to consider since you said you haven't been living there very long:  A lot of older appliances typically use a lot more electricity than newer energy-efficient ones.  Refrigerators, ovens, stoves, furnaces, washer/dryers... these can be quite costly if they're older appliances.  A lot of electric companies offer a free service where they can come out to your home and give an evaluation about how to reduce your monthly bill.<br>

My electric bill!!!!</span><hr size=1> Also, a computer uses 250 - 450 Watts of power, depending on your make and model. Usually it's around 300 - 350 for an average computer. If you leave a computer on all day, that will add up hella fast. Also, after you throw in the 125 - 200 Watts your monitor uses, added in with your electric heater, any lights you leave on, the television, and any other electric devices you use (Electric blanket, Stereo Equipment, Water heater, ect...), it can add up quick. I agree with checking the power box. Flip all your breakers (Or remove the fuses), then check the box. Be reminded that the box will never &quot;stop&quot; because for self service reasons it keeps moving (Yes you pay for they're preventive maintinance), but it should move REALLY slow. Definately keep check on this, and try and make sure no one is ripping you off. I believe this is true though, because people really dont realize how fast these add up, ESPECIALLY a computer/monitor/speakers/printer/scanner/ect... Those can add up to over 1kw themselves on a hefty system, and can add a huge chunk on your powerbill if left on 24/7 <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showUserPublicProfile?gid=mysteweave>Mysteweave</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Hug the Druid!<br>

My electric bill!!!!</span><hr size=1> To give you all a little more information...<br>
<br>
I've left my computer on all day before, for the last few years and it never got up this high before. I will admit that in my last apartment I had a one room gas heater. However, I also had a roomate and it was a two bedroom apartment. Electric stove there as well, and I also had an oscillating heater fan.<br>
<br>
My new apartment has electric heat. They are base board heaters. The living room heater is hooked up to a switch in the wall that has a thermostat. The bedroom and entryway baseboard heaters have their own little dial nobs 1-7 that you turn to make the setting. I presume they turn off after a certain temperature because though the entryway one was 'on' it was cold at one point. I could be wrong. I'm fairly sure the living room one does though because of the temperature gauge.<br>
<br>
<br>
However, I turned on the heat about the first week or so of November when it started to get cold (kept it low) was not using the bedroom one, the knob was missing. Entryway one also was used but on low. The living room one has climbed up to sit around 70 when I'm at the apartment and 65 or so, maybe even 60 when I'm not.<br>
<br>
Ever since I turned it on the first time it was making a popping noise once in a while. While I was gone out of town last week, it shorted out and melted through a wire. Maitence guy for my apt. just replaced it with a new baseboard heater -- its smaller and brand new. No more popping. He also put a dial on the bedroom baseboard heater so I could use it. (Was using my oscilating heater fan in there)<br>
<br>
This exchange of living room heaters was done Dec 5th. My reading was done the 4th of November, and 4th of December.<br>
<br>
I read the thingy myself this morning and since the 4th it has used 259 killowats, or so. (If I read it right) So though the heater is fixed, it still seems to be using an abnormal amount (its only been 8 days). My first 18 days of living in my apartment, with computer on all the time, sans heater, was 108 killowats, so I'm thinking its definitely centered around the heater somewhere. A guildie suggested that the short in the living room could of overamped it (But why does it still seem to be using an abnormal amount?). Also the lady on the phone told me that previously, the reading in the apartment I live in, the highest wattage ever read for a month was around 500 something.<br>
<br>
I can't think that the lady who lived in the apartment before for -12- years never ever used the heat in the apartment.<br>
So there may still be something wrong with the wiring/heater? Maybe? Who do I get to investigate this? How?? Do I have the electric company do it? Or the mangement. I had guildies say both of them should. And that I should try to get my management to pay part of my electric bill if there is a problem.<br>
<br>
This is so outside of my expereince. I've never had to deal with a potential problem like this.<br>

My electric bill!!!!</span><hr size=1> I havent' had that experience yet, but seeing as you are in an apartment complex, try your management complex first.  They may know a LOT more than you do about wiring. Tell them you are desperate... if they are totally clueless and/or unhelpful, go ahead and try other methods.<br>
<br>
Several possibilities..<br>
a) record your reading every day so you can track changes<br>
b) turn off heating, leave everything else on, track how much you used the next day (if back to &quot;normal&quot; levels, you know it's a heat problem)<br>
c) I dont know if this an option but since you suspect it's the one heater, turn it off, leave everything else on.. check meter a day later.<br>
<br>
<br>
Record everything you do, date/time/#s... just in case.  If the new heater is a problem, your management may help pay the bills but only if you can show them how much it's been costing you.<br>
<br>
Good luck and let us know. <p><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://www.leagueofhonour.com/images/members/kyrialsignature.jpg" style="border:0;"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showUserPublicProfile?gid=ilmarinceleborn>Ilmarin Celeborn</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 199<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(12/12/03 3:03 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=4637.topic&index=13>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://users.adelphia.net/~kotso/images/small2.bmp WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_supermad.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: WTF?

You also may of not noticed it but they could of made energy price changes in your area and it is in fine print on your bill somewhere. 95 is not too bad though. I have 3 kids all with stereos, 4TV's in the house, 2 computers, 3 sony playstations, 2 VCR's and a DVD player. So something is always left on in those rooms. So I feel for you friend and hope it gets better soon.

My electric bill!!!!</span><hr size=1> Side note. I would not assume your hall heaters have a self shut off system if they dont have a thermostat for them. As they are controlled seperatly from your other rooms. It leads me to believe that they are not tied in with the others. And thus have noway of knowing what temperature it is. They just know on or off.<br>
<br>
Had a situation like yours once in an apartment. One room had been updated with a temperature control system while the rest of the apartment was still in late 60's early 70's condition. My first winter was an expensive one till I learned to fine tune it all.<br>
<br>
You may know this already. But do not pull fuses without 1st marking them for where they go back too. Older houses and apartments may have differing fuses. Mixing and matching will be a headache if the box is not marked with the approperate fuses for the approperate circuts. If it a newer apartment. There is a master switch for your fuse panel at the very top of the circut panel. Most likely marked as a 240v switch. ( If your in the U.S. I am not familure with Euro voltages or others.) Throwing this switch will cut off all power to your apartment in one move. ( Switch may also be marked as a 110v also. Depends on the spec's at the time building was constructed.)<br>
<br>
Good luck<br>

<br>
I also agree with the other post here about checking the other heaters for automatic shut off and that you might want to consider a space heater and just heating the spaces you are living in as you live in them.<br>

<br>
A lot of electric companies offer to do this for free and you might want to call them and ask them if they offer this service in your area. <br>
<br>
Calling your property management office would be a good idea, but they won't necessarily fix an appliance that is drawing an unusual amount of electricity.  If it's broken, they will fix it so that it's operational.  Most companies that I've worked with won't bother fixing something if it's just drawing more electricity though.<br>
<br>
Most of the people that the property management office will send out to &quot;investigate&quot; the problem won't necessarily have the tools or equipment to determine whether or not your unit is drawing an excessive amount of electricity.  They can usually fix things if they're broken, but not usually in special circumstances such as the one you're experiencing.<br>
<br>
You can also consider calling an inspection company.  They will charge you for this (if it's a private company) but you will have something that you can give to your property manager in writing.<br>
<br>
An inspector (or the electric company) can use an amp probe to determine the amount of electrical current that your heaters are drawing.  There should be an amp rating on the plate on your heater (where the model and serial numbers would be) that would state what that particular appliance should be drawing.  <br>
<br>
There are other gizmos available that can be hooked up for longer periods of time to monitor the electrical current and any spikes that may occur over a period of time.  A lot of these other methods are costly though depending on the duration of monitoring.  <br>
<br>
I'd call the property management office and see what they can do (I doubt very much) and then the electric company and see what they can do for free.<br>

My electric bill!!!!</span><hr size=1> Just a note.<br>
<br>
That little oscilating heater fan doesn't use as much electricity as you would think. I ran it every day last winter (because there was only a wall gas heater in the living room that didn't heat up anything at all) and my electric bill wasn't larger than normal. My compuer and that fan are only a max of 2 years old, if that. Most of my equipment is within 5 years or less.<br>
<br>
So I don't think that I would go from using 350 killowats a month last winter (when I had a roomate) to 778 a month just because of that fan <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
I do not have anything other than a normal fridge and stove (both of which I think are less than 5 years old as they said they replaced both not too long ago when I first moved in).<br>
<br>
I will try turning off the heaters -- all of them, completely, for a day and checking the meter, then turning them on, and checking the meter. That is a good experiment and I will document meter readings.<br>
<br>
As I said, there was some kind of short in the wiring of the old floorboard heater just last week so that may have caused some kind of problem. I will also ask the management what they think the normal output is.<br>
<br>
My concern is that maybe there is some kind of plug somewhere that is connected to my wiring, and they've been doing improvements in my hallway for the last few weeks (painting and texturizing and stuff and using high powered bulbs) because to me it sure seems like someone's being using a truck load of power equipment.<br>
<br>
I think the electric company may be the best to check the ampage of the heaters as well and will see if I can get them out to do that.. and also notify my management of the unsusual circumstances.<br>
<br>
Still, I can't see that the electrical heating would draw that much heat. You may be right (the one that mentioned this) that the bedroom and entryway are not monitored by a thermostat and would need to be manually turned off each day. (I did that this morning)<br>
<br>
Ah well. We'll see what happens. I'm just a little distressed. I talked to the manager before I moved in about the energy usage in the apartments -- because they'd kept some statistics, she told me the averages and no one had anything like this even with heat or air conditioning running.<br>
