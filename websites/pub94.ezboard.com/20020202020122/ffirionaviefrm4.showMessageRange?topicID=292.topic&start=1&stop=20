But I think that happens much too often -- everywhere.  Rather quickly, it became fairly discouraging, and both sides lost any hope of converting me to their point of view.<br><br>As an aside, and not totally off-topic;  I only see a handful of active participants on this board, and many of those were in opposition to anything Shintou said (I'm aware that's an over generalization).  It seems that if Shintou could have set aside some of his ego and placated his opponents with a bit more docility, he may have been able to state his case for a longer period, but the result would have probably been the same.  I didn't see anyone being overly rational in the several debates involved (another over-generalization). <br><br>Things don't often go smoothly when fanatics are involved, and it seemed several diametrically opposed perspectives came into conflict.  It was sad, and discouraged me from becoming a bit more active.  Especially when I come to play a game.  If I can't play the game the way I want, I move on, either in-game or too another.  If FV doesn't pan out, then I'll be in another game.  Hopefully one I enjoy will be released soon.  As it is, EQ is the only one of this genre I still desire to play.  <br><br>I do hope more objective moderation becomes a norm for this board. Since I don't feel part of &quot;the crowd&quot;, and will probably not be extremely active here -- it would be nice to feel comfortable posting here once in awhile.  As it is, I almost feel as if I'm intruding on a private playground.  <br><br>Okay, to close this lengthy post and try to swing back towards the topic -- what was it, btw?  Oh, I think both sides of the numerous discussion behaved poorly, and it wouldn't have been so lengthy and troublesome had more moderation been present, or moved to a more appropriate location.

Even then, he admitted to ripping off most of his stuff. It's pretty easy to seem like you're better than you really are when you're copying someone else's writing. Hell, I probably could have gotten away with posting some exercpts from Steven Brust's Vlad Taltos novels in the Hero Heart Tavern and made everyone believe I was a great writer.

It says he's &quot;intolerant&quot; (and implies that he's &quot;racist&quot;), or that he's characterized by &quot;intolerance&quot;.

It adds nothing substantial to the argument, and it attacks Shintou's character, not his argument.  It implies that he's got a psychological problem, and that's why he disagrees with you.

Was actually working on a quest to get him a cool shadowknight lance.<br><br>   However, I felt (and still do feel) that the manner in which he rants / whines here serves no constructive purpose except to let him get stuff off his chest.  It further feeds the whole useless &quot;Roleplayer -vs- Powergamer&quot; debate, and it has to scare away at least a few new players who come to these boards only to find a screaming match going on.<br><br>   Regardless of some guild's participation in said arguments, I rarely if ever find that they've <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> started</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> the argument, except maybe by acting a little too out of character in a post.<br><br>   As much as his in-game personality was what I was looking forward to on Firiona Vie (cool characters with interesting stories played differently then &quot;Hey, wanna camp orc 2 with me?  It's good XP!&quot;), I think he refuses to let an issue drop, and expects far too much from the server populace as a whole.  If he wants the non-stop, intense level of Roleplay, with no one participating to a lesser degree, he should turn off the computer, and put together a pen &amp; paper group.<br><br>   I'm not sorry he left.  I don't mean that to sound rude, I just don't think that his leaving was anyone's &quot;fault&quot;.  He's been distraught for what, months now?  Hopefully wherever he does go, be it another server, or off of EQ in general, he'll find the gameplay he's looking for and it'll make him happy.<br><br>- Syll <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top">  Page  <b>1</b> <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.showMessageRange?topicID=292.topic&start=21&stop=40>2</a><a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.showMessageRange?topicID=292.topic&start=41&stop=60>3</a><a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.showMessageRange?topicID=292.topic&start=61&stop=75>4</a> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.showMessage?topicID=302.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.showMessage?topicID=301.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=292.topic&index=20><img src=http://www.firiona-vie.com/images/arfv.jpg border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"><a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.threadControl?topicID=292.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/professional/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands (Moderator only)</a><br> <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=292.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=292.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub94.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="firionaviefrm1">Firiona Vie General Chat<option value="firionaviefrm9">OT/OOC Forum<option value="firionaviefrm4">The Soapbox<option value="firionaviefrm10">A Bard for a Day<option value="firionaviefrm23">Hero Heart Tavern<option value="firionaviefrm15">The Polling Booth<option value="firionaviefrm40">Kudos!<option value="firionaviefrm2">The Market Square<option value="firionaviefrm22">The Tradeskill Shop<option value="firionaviefrm38">The Spell Library<option value="firionaviefrm39">Events<option value="firionaviefrm42">Roleplayers Wanted/LFG<option value="firionaviefrm43">The Fighter's Den<option value="firionaviefrm44">Tower of Magick<option value="firionaviefrm45">Altar of Faith<option value="firionaviefrm8">RP Server Rules<option value="firionaviefrm7">Patch Messages<option value="firionaviefrm11">Announcements<option value="firionaviefrm13">Moderator's Forum<option value="firionaviefrm12">Suggestion Box<option value="firionaviefrm6">Signature Testing<option value="firionaviefrm47">Guilds and Associations</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#A62A2A>- </font><a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie>Firiona Vie</a><font color=#A62A2A> - </font><a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4>The Soapbox</a> <font color=#A62A2A> - </font><a href="http://www.firiona-vie.com/">Firiona Vie</a><font color=#A62A2A> - </font><br><br> <center><a href="http://www.firiona-vie.com/fvchat.html" target="_blank"><h3>Chat Room</a></h3></center> <br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 6.5<br>Copyright ©1999-2001 ezboard, Inc.</center></body></html>
