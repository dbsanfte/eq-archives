<br>
Everything thats going on in EverQuest all deals with the coming of the gods and the end of the world as Trakanon saw of it. Here is the beta release on it all.<br>
<br>
The Story of Edril<br>
Of Carandril's death and Edril's journey to Antonica:<br>
At the age of 450, Carandril became deathly ill. The emperor fought death for more then a year before his passing into the next realm. High elves and wood elves crowded the busy streets of Felwithe for a full day to witness the funeral procession, and Edril was saddened greatly by the loss of his mentor and friend. As per elven tradition, when Carandril passed away a new emperor was chosen by the council and the new emperor, after being crowned, chose a new head for the imperial army. Edril was awarded estates in the surrounding imperial lands, a hero's send off, and a large amount of gold coins for his retirement wealth. Nobody, however, expected Edril ever to lay his sword to rest. &quot;He has the blood of a hero,&quot; emperor Carandril used to say, &quot;try as you might, you could never keep Edril from the adventure.&quot; Thinking there was nothing left for him in the empire of the elves, Edril gathered what wealth was given to him and set sail for the far-off human lands of Antonica.<br>
<br>
Arriving in the city of Freeport, Edril was recognized as a wealthy elf only. His name was unknown to these western lands, but that quickly changed. Edril became almost instantly renowned in the Freeport area for his fighting prowess, as he helped many of the villages along Lake Neriuss against the raider Zellain and his band of dark elves. His real fame, however, came as a desert fighter. Edril held a chief role in defending an outpost in the Kithicor woods against a large goblin attack, and it was during this battle that Edril became infatuated by the deserts of Antonica. Whether it was because they were so foreign to him or whether he loved the danger, Edril spent most of his remaining time on Antonica wandering it's deserts, from the eastern desert of Ro all the way to the dead hills in the west and the plains of Karana. His most noteworthy exploits in these areas included capturing Ragoth the sand giant and his &quot;dust marauders&quot; in the desert of Ro as well as flushing out an entire nest of frogloks around lake Rathetear. He soon was recognized back in Felwithe as a remarkable cataloguer of strange creatures, as he would write notes about all his adversaries and send them to the imperial library. As he made his way to Qeynos, he even fell in love with an erudite female mage named Almaril and they were wed.<br>
<br>
Of Almaril and Zisstrik the insane:<br>
For a time in Qeynos Edril forgot about adventure or Carandril or his home back with the elves. He loved Almaril deeply and she took him back and forth from Erudin to Antonica, teaching him everything he wished to know. He was as much interested in her crude but powerful magic as she was his graceful fighting styles. For the first time in a long time Edril was satisfied and happy, and to the astonishment of all it seemed that the elven warrior would actually settle down in Qeynos with his wife forever. But fate moves unpredictably and Edril was called into service once more.<br>
<br>
An old merchant noble from Freeport, a long time friend of Edril, sent him a letter detailing the problems he was having with a band of local trollish thieves. The thieves, however, were not everyday thugs. Goods from merchant caravans had increasingly been stolen to fund for a splinter trollish army somewhere in the desert of Ro. The army, whom the kingdom of Grobb wanted destroyed very much, was lead by an obnoxious would-be-preacher troll named Zisstrik the insane, who lead his band of trolls on what he called a &quot;religious crusade.&quot; Edril agreed to help with the problem. The troll bandits were easily found and easily dispensed with, but more important was what Edril learned during the hunt. Zisstrik spoke at length, before he was killed, about the troll dragon-god Trakanon and how the dragon told Zisstrik in his dreams to steal and kill the local human merchants who &quot;pollute the desert and the swamps with their presence.&quot; Edril dismissed most of what the troll said as crazy dribble, but he became increasingly interested in the tale of Trakanon. In return for the destruction of the splinter army, Edril only wished in payment that he be allowed to speak with the shamans of Grobb about the great dragon. The trolls, however bitter and tentative, agreed.<br>
<br>
Of Edril's research and his quest for Kunark:<br>
The elven warrior was immediately in love with the story of the troll heritage. He was fascinated by the idea of dozens of glorious armies dessimating eachother because of hunger and confusion, fascinated by the imagery of the far off and blasted land of Kunark, but even more fascinated by the character of Trakanon, a powerful being once a god to the trolls and only seen by a single chief. He immediately thought Trakanon was evil both for what he did to the trolls and because of what Edril knew about all dragons. The elf silently vowed to make the hunt for Trakanon his final and most glorious quest. Utilizing ancient trollish texts and learning what he could, Edril soon had plotted a course to and over Kunark. Almaril protested greatly and called Edril crazy for trying to carry out such a silly fantasy, but the elf couldn't resist the pull of perhaps the greatest adventure he would ever have.<br>
<br>
Leaving his wife sobbing behind him on the docksides of Freeport, Edril set sail for several weeks before arriving at what he hoped was the lost continent of Kunark. Frightened by the horrible site of the field of bone before them, the crew of Edril's ship told the warrior they would remain on the coastline until his safe return. Packing what he needed for a long and arduous journey, Edril made his way alone across the dead fields of the ancient trollish homeland until he arrived.at the jagged cliffs of Trakanon's Teeth. What happened next no one knows for sure, as Edril was careful not even to divulge it to his wife before his death, but it is rumored Edril had to escape many clever traps and fight through several horrendous challenges before reaching the throne of the great beast. Even then, he did not kill Trakanon because what the dragon had to tell him was of far greater importance then any quest. Herein lies the complete text of Trakanon's prophecy, as Edril himself never forgot the words of the great beast and later told his wife in order that the whole of Norrath may read the message:<br>
<br>
Of Trakanon's prophecy, excerpt from &quot;The Book of Edril&quot; by Edril's late wife Almaril:<br>
The great dragon looked on Edril as a father on his son and smiled widely. &quot;So,&quot; Trakanon spoke in a voice that shook the very ground, &quot;at last you have come.&quot; Edril, great among the elves, felt himself begin to tremble as he stared deep into the dragon's fiery eyes. &quot;You have no reason to fear me, warrior, even though you have come here to kill me. But I doubt that even you could perform such a task. You see, child, I was born before the stars were made, before the foundation of this world was ripped by Veeshan's claw, and before the gods gave birth to the elder races. I have been and always will be the eternal mystery between life and death and gods and man.&quot; With that said, Edril bowed his head in awe and somehow knew the great beast spoke the truth. &quot;And yet,&quot; the dragon continued, &quot;I am but a watcher. For while I claim this world as my own I am forbidden by laws forged millenia ago to change it's course. It is the curse of all my kind: to love a world so much and to have to watch it die. Take heed, warrior, because Norrath's death is fast approaching.&quot; Edril lifted his head, his eyes wide in a look of shock and fear. The dragon simply nodded. &quot;Yes, Edril, Norrath's fate was decided long ago, or so the gods think. But the visions of your gods are often warped by their own vanity and selfishness, the future is never set, and the elder races may yet prove them wrong. The gods made you all as a means to an end in their struggle and as the wars of the elder races escalate, so shall the gods descend from their planes of existence and make the whole of Norrath suffer. But there are those among the races untouched by the taint of immortals whom I have chosen as the saviors of man.&quot; Trakanon then stabbed deep into the ground with his left claw and ripped the bottom of his cave dwelling asunder with one powerful stroke of his arm. Edril looked over the sides of the newly formed chasms and noticed the walls glowing a bright red. A face began to form from the blackness deep within the cracks, and Edril could clearly make out the aging face of an old man. The face had sad eyes, gaunt cheeks, and long silvery hair. &quot;His name is Miragul,&quot; said the dragon, &quot;a human mage, gifted in all talents of magic and able to bend the laws of life and death to his will. He exists now as an empty shell, wandering his tombs filled with powerful magics.&quot; The next face that formed was that of a troll, but surprisingly it was a noble and proud visage. Scars ran from both eyes down to the troll's mouth, and the troll's eyes were strong and unwavering. &quot;He was called Nalikor. He was the troll first to enter my kingdom and find me. He ended centuries of brutal war, was greatest among his soldiers, and was able to lead his people from death and starvation to a powerful kingdom.&quot; The dragon then turned his eyes to Edril. &quot;You, elf, are my third chosen. You are Edril the warrior, a brilliant soldier and great hero. Death haunts you at every turn but you are always able to overcome your obstacles. You are a deadly fighter, a wanderer of Norrath, and a lord among elves. And now I award you with a much bigger destiny.&quot; Trakanon spoke deep in a language Edril couldn't understand, and suddenly a small pendant flashed into existence around Edril's neck. &quot;To Miragul I revealed the existence of artifacts that would enhance his powers in the arcane arts. To Nalikor I awarded a flaming sword to enhance his warrior prowess. To you I give this: a small pendant that will allow you to talk with me always. But it does much more. My strength is finite, Edril, and already my powers begin to weaken. Soon either the gods or the elder races will find the means to my destruction, and when that happens then the final war for Norrath shall be waged. But when I die, before I leave for the afterlife, I will impart my power to the bearer of this pendant, and he shall have all the wisdom and the strength of the most ancient of creatures.&quot; Trakanon then laid his serpent-like head on the floor of his cave. &quot;That time is fast approaching. Here is my prophecy, young one. Everything I say now shall soon come to pass. When the wars of the elder races begin to come to fruition, the gods shall take notice and plan for their coming into the world. Then, on the third day of the third season, in the dark of the night on all the continents of the elder races, shall be reborn my chosen in the bodies of other men, representing all of the three virtues: good, evil, and the gray neutral between them both. They will arise to the call of a fourth chosen, great among them, who will collect my gifts unto himself: the magic enhancements of Miragul, the flaming sword of Nalikor, and your dragon pendant. The peoples of Norrath will revere this one as Trakanon's chosen, and he will watch the whole world burn.&quot;<br>
<br>
Of Edril's last days:<br>
When he returned home he was changed forever. With his greatest achievment completed, Edril the warrior, feared of the orcan clans, slayer of the plague dragon of Akanon, first soldier of the empire, and desert wanderer of Norrath, hung his sword to rest forever. He lived many happy years in the arms of Almaril, his wife, and they even gave birth to a son, something no one thought possible between a erudite and elf. But whether it was fate's choice to test Edril one last time or because erudites were enough &quot;non-human&quot; so procreation was near impossible, Edril's son was taken by disease at an early age. The event crushed the indomitable elf and at the age of 405 the warrior passed away. &quot;No spear or sword or arrow, fang, claw, or spell could ever hope of killing the elf known as Edril,&quot; recounted Biddyn at the funeral of his friend, &quot;but for a father, the death of an only child is the worst poison the world can give.&quot; The lord of Qeynos thought it best to send his body back to the elven empire and there gathered a very ecclectic funeral procession: Merchant friends from Freeport and Qeynos, human lords of Antonica, almost the entire gnomish population, and even troll shamans from Grobb to bear witness to the last warrior to ever lay eyes on Trakanon. Some said the dark elves were also present, spying on the funeral from the shadows just to make sure Edril had actually lost the battle with death. Dozens of elven trumpets sounded his passing and his casket was floated over the top of the Elizerain Lake to sink into it's depths forever, an honor normally reserved only for the emperors. It is written that even now, at the bottom of the lake in that same casket, the dragon pendant of Trakanon waits, grasped tightly in Edril's cold, dead fingers.<br>
<br>
You will note that it was Bertoxxulous who destroyed the Shissar with his &quot;green mist&quot; and it was Bertoxxulous who cursed the Karana Plains again with his &quot;green mist&quot; and you will also note...Trakanon was once a sky dragon and is called the &quot;poison dragon&quot; when in fact...he is the second plague dragon. Note his breath weapon, a &quot;green mist&quot; that seeps into your skin like a slowly churning plague. Then look at whats in sebilis and notice some of the things in there and then go read the information on Bertoxxulous on EQ.com and read about his plane.<br>
<br>
Trakanon made a pact with Bertoxxulous (brought in as the god of death in Norrath by the Nameless) to cheat death so that he could see the end of days and assist in averting it all. Trakanon also had a heavy influence in the Combine Empire, of which the word Combine is oft used synynomously with dragons. The Combine Empire being the dragon empire of which had the direct involvement of Trakanon. Take a look at the screen shots on the fist site in the beta compendium for the combine empire and the prophecy of trakanon.<br>
<br>
The sword of Nalikor by the way is the sword of Mithaniel Marr...the legendary Truthbringer which was lost in the battle of Nektulous woods against Innoruuk who also lost his weapon Malevolence the Governor of the Wicked as well in the same battle. Both losses caused as a direct result of the intervention of Bristlebane. <br>
<br>
In beta players USED to be able to quest for Truthbringer. It was the reward for returning Lucan's testimony but was removed at release following the event that transpired in Nektulous Wood the final day of beta. Similarily speaking Soulfire used to be held in the hands of Pietro Zarn the shadowknight lord of the Dismal Rage which also ties into the story of the current Soulfire quest.<br>

Thats where we go to talk about Norrath Lore. Theres pages of the stuff. Two huge threads one of which is broken. I am currently in the process of taking all that I know and compiling it into one huge war compendium, the beta of which is posted over there.<br>
<br>
<br>
As to Truthbringer, it hasn't been seen since beta. It is also the Sword of Nalikor, taken by Trakanon. Also keep in mind the Combine Empire, where it was seated and who was involved with it...Trakanon. And who was the main faith of the Combine Empire? Mithaniel Marr.<br>
<br>
And the fourth hero will ascend and inherit the gifts of the three from the good the neutral and the evil and he shall watch the world born...<br>
<br>
By the way, guess who will do the burning? The Sleeper...<br>
<br>
The fourth warder mentions the fourth hero of Trakanon as being his slayer.<br>
<br>
Truthbringer probably won't bee seen along with the other two artifacts until the GM event happens, in which I believe Qeynos will fall and the world will be forever changed. <p>Banegrivm Shadowblight<br>Sovereign Lord of the 1st Fist of Light<br>www.1stfistoflight.com</p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <br><font color=#A62A2A>- </font><a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie>Firiona Vie</a><font color=#A62A2A> - </font><a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm1>Firiona Vie General Chat</a> <font color=#A62A2A> - </font><a href="http://www.firionavie.org/">Firiona Vie</a><font color=#A62A2A> - </font><br><br><br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 6.6.4<br>Copyright ©1999-2001 ezboard, Inc.</center></body></html>
