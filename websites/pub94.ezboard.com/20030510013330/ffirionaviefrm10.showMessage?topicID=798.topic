So sorry. ))<br>
<br>
The busy Tavern is filled with noise and laughter as those of the dark alliances revel in their victories of the day. As the night moves on the patrons become more loud and obnoxious. Balancing a tray with mugs of ale a small Teir’Dal female makes her way through the rowdy patrons. A young, male Warrior roughly grabs her arm as she places one of the mugs on the table.<br>
<br>
Turning eyes the color of ice, upon him she scowls, “Ye would do better not to touch me…. My Lord.” The last two words drip from her lips as sarcasm dipped in thick honey. All the males at the table laugh at the small girl and her pathetic threat. He releases her arm only to quickly grab her by the face pulling her eyes closer to his. Keeping his blood red eyes glaring directly into hers he shouts to the barkeep, “How much for the wench?!”<br>
<br>
“I am not a wench.” She growls out between clenched teeth. Her hand firmly on his arm she tries to free herself without spilling the mugs she holds with the other hand still on the tray. His eyes squint down to an evil smirk, “After tonight. We will see. You may even enjoy it.” She tosses her tray at him the ale spilling all over him and the floor. Still gripping her face tightly he stands, “You will pay for that wench.” Releasing her face he backhands her sending her sprawling to the floor.<br>
<br>
Strands of hair hang loosely in her face as she raises her cold eyes to meet his. She places her fingertip to her bleeding lip which heals itself upon her soft whisper. Suddenly, he grips her by the face once more pulling her to her feet. As she rises she deftly snatches a dagger from a nearby onlooker’s boot pressing it against the males neck, the only vulnerable place when fully armored. “Touch me and ye shall surely die.” She growls out at him.<br>
<br>
“Lithiah! That is not how we treat our patrons!” the barkeep shouts at her as he approaches.<br>
<br>
Ignoring the dagger she holds to his throat he holds her jaw firmly in his hand. Aware that one twist of his wrist would surely break her jaw she remains still but holds the dagger to his throat, still in defiance of him. His eyes never leaving hers he asks the barkeep again, now his voice even deeper and anger filled, “How much for the wench?”<br>
<br>
“She is not worthy to be a wench my Lord. Too young and inexperienced.” The barkeep says apologetically as he grabs another girl from a patrons lap. “Here, this one is pretty. She knows how to please a mighty warrior such as yourself.”<br>
<br>
“No.” He growls out, “This one. How much?” His eyes locked on hers she pushes the blade deeper into his skin. His face curls into a grin as blood begins trickling down his neck. “You will enjoy bleeding for me tonight, young one.” Unable to speak as his grip tightens on her jaw, a small whimper disobediently escapes her lips.<br>
<br>
“No, no my Lord. She is not worthy. Here, this one is pleasing.” The barkeep pleads. Finally, the Warrior glances over to the beautiful and much more well proportioned Teir’Dal female who flashes him a seductive smile. Returning his eyes to Lithiah he grins, “You have been lucky tonight. Go away little girl.” Tossing her aside he laughs quickly grabbing up the other girl placing her on his lap as he sits.<br>
<br>
The barkeep scowls, “Lithiah, follow me. NOW.” He takes the dagger from her hand and grabs her roughly by the arm providing a lecture her all the way back to the bar. Handing her another round of drinks, “Here, take these back and apologize. Or, I WILL let him have you tonight.”<br>
<br>
Lithiah nods silently, though the look of anger is still quite apparent on her face. She makes her way back to his table ignoring the pain remaining in her jaw. Placing the mugs on the table she looks over at the Warrior with cold eyes, “I….” She pauses a moment trying to spit out the words. “I….” Looking up at the barkeep she sees him watching her and looks back at the Warrior who looks up at her, quite amused with himself. <br>
<br>
An equally evil grin slides across her face as she coldly stares into his eyes, “I…. Pray to The Father…. That….” She leans down placing the tray onto the table, leaning close into his face. A wicked grin upon her blue Teir’Dal complexion. Their eyes lock with cold hatred towards each other, “I pray to The Father he allow me to take your life this night.”<br>
<br>
“Why you!” Tossing the wench aside he jumps up backhanding Lithiah to the floor once again. Scowling up at him from the floor she bolts as if a feline after prey as a deep growl erupts from her tiny body. From out of no where a foot deters her from her path finding it’s way to her ribs sending her flying sideways into a table. Quite dazed from her contact with the table she looks up to see a darkly dressed Shadow Knight facing the Warrior. His calm demeanor over the Warriors anger peaks her interest for only a moment before she stands ready to attack either of the two who come at her first.<br>
<br>
The Knight and Warriors eyes never leave each other as the Knight stretches his hand out to Lithiah. She looks at his hand for a moment, then to the two males facing each other. Feeling a strange sense of trust she places her hand in his and he pulls her behind him. “You will not touch my Charge. For, if you do. You touch death.” He says in a calm, but demanding, voice. The Warrior knowing this Knight is too much for him backs down causing a wicked grin to manifest from the Knights face.<br>
<br>
Still holding her hand the Knight turns dragging her along with him. Passing by the bar he tosses a bag of coins on the bar. “She’s not a wench mighty Knight” the barkeep says in more of a questioning tone than statement.<br>
<br>
“No. She is not. She is mine.” The Knight states calmly. The barkeep picks up the bag and feeling there is enough coin there to fully purchase 10 wenches he grins. “Do what you want with her. But, be warned. She has been nothing but trouble since she was found.”<br>
<br>
Grinning the Knight drags the girl behind him walking out the door, “Good. That’s what I had hoped.”<br>

Beautiful description and great detail. I like how the character is interesting and yet not perfect. The character is beautiful yet not as beautiful or well endowed as the other Teir'Dal woman. It will be interesting to see the character develop. A lot of books out there have &quot;perfect&quot; characters. Perfect looks, perfect battles, etc. That gets boring. Your work is refreshing.<br>
 I'm not saying make her more imperfect <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> .Or not to let her become more beautiful than the other Teir'Dal woman. It would be neat if she did. It's just refreshing to come to the FV Bard for a Day and read good work and more believable characters like yours. Who are not perfect, yet still attractive and interesting. I look forward to more of your work.<br>

<br>
He turns grabbing her by the neck shoving her up against a wall. “Quiet or you die here.” Her eyes widen as he squeezes hard enough on her throat to just cut off the air. She tries in futility to remove his grasp as she pulls at his wrist to free her neck from his hand.<br>
<br>
He lets out a sigh of disappointment, “I thought you were stronger. I may be wrong.” Releasing her she slides down the wall holding her throat gasping for air. “Get up.” He states firmly as once again he roughly apprehends her arm dragging her along.<br>
<br>
Silently she follows him, more being dragged than walking on her own as his steps are fast but not running. “Where are we going?” she finally blurts out struggling to keep up with the Knight. “Quiet.” He says. She begins wondering what is to become of her when turning the last corner they come to a dead end.<br>
<br>
The Knight turns to face her. Holding her shoulders his eyes lock with hers, “Stay here. Do not take even one step.” His serious face weaves of an evil mixed grin. She nods silently then he is gone. She blinks a few times astonished at his disappearance.<br>
<br>
She rubs her still aching jaw as she looks around the alley. Walls of stone raise high into the night sky where she cannot see. She tries to peek around behind her trying not to move her feet as the Knight has instructed. Unable, she begins concentrating on the walls around her. Leaning a bit she peers at one part of a wall in particular. ‘Is it moving?’ she thinks to herself in silence.<br>
<br>
She straightens as whispers begin from all around her. The walls seem to be moving, shifting in her presence. She feels as if they touch her. Not her physical being. But, her inner soul. As the alley darkens she takes a ready stance, “Who are ye? What do ye want?”<br>
<br>
A whisper standing out before the others, that of the Knight, surrounds her as if entering into her mind and surrounding her body, “Who are <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>you</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->?” The question is stated to her in long drawn out words. “What do <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>you</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> want?”<br>
<br>
Her face turns cold, her voice angry, but the fear is apparent, “Don’t mock me. Answer me.” Her feet still unmoving she looks at the walls. Shifts as if rifts in time were more apparent now. Flickers from the stone seeming to be hands reaching out to her.<br>
<br>
“Answer <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>me</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->.” The whisper states. Rising and fading as if a ripple in her mind. Her anger takes over as she growls lowly her foot shifting a bit with her hands raised in defense.<br>
<br>
She grins trying to bury the fear within her. Or, at least hide it. “Come on out Knight. I challenge ye.” An echo of laughter is heard encircling her. “You have your fathers resolve.”<br>
<br>
“My father? You are a Knight of Innoruuk and you don’t even call him your father?” she questions the whispering Knight. Her eyes continue watching the movement of the stone as forms of figures and doorways fade in and out.<br>
<br>
“I was hoping you would have your mothers ferocity. You may be too <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>weak</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->.” The whisper of the Knight states calmly and directly into her mind. The word ‘weak’ emphasized to seek a reaction from her fulfills its Masters request.<br>
<br>
“I am not weak!” She shouts turning around thinking him behind her. As her foot leaves the ground she is kicked suddenly from a force she has never felt. She lands on the ground looking up, a deep growl departs her lips through angry clenched teeth. <br>
<br>
Snickers from thousands of directions aim directly into her mind. “Obey me. Now, rise and do not move unless told.”<br>
<br>
“No.” her voice defiant and strong she raises on her own terms. “I am not a slave.” When she straightens the force kicks her once more to the ground. A slight mutterance of a yelp escapes her as she lands back to the ground on all fours.<br>
<br>
“Lesson one. Do not ever refer to yourself as less than you are.” The whisper now sounding more real like. As if the person may actually be standing there. “We don’t have much time. Now, rise. And learn your next lesson.”<br>
<br>
Gathering her strength she stands in bold contempt, her body weak and pain filled. The night continues on, strike after strike as she continuously defies the shadowed Knight. <br>
<br>
Finally, when she is too weak to even stand the Knight appears before her. “I will not obey ye.” She growls out at him. Her words overflowing with anger and hatred for him. The pain within her body nearly unbearable.<br>
<br>
“Good.” He says causing her to look up at him with questioning eyes. The cold steel of his armored hand makes a loud clank as it meets her head.<br>

The scurry of an unknown number of people surround her. The cold, hard stone on which she lays seems to vibrate with a magick of it’s own. Unable to move, she can only feel. Her arms, legs, every part of her disobedient to her commands as she lay motionless.<br>
<br>
“She wakes. Summon her Knight.” A low voice hisses a command. She tries to turn her head to the voice. But, again is left unmoving. <br>
<br>
“Get me off here.” She growls out at the darkness. Again she struggles against her own body to move. Just an inch would be an accomplishment.<br>
<br>
Hearing the clanking of heavy armor she hears the voice of the ShadowKnight once more. “Lay still Lithiah.” His voice, cold, demanding.<br>
<br>
“No!” she calls out towards him. “Let me go.” Again she struggles against herself.<br>
<br>
“Leave.” The voice of the ShadowKnight tells the others in the room. Hearing the feet of those in soft shoes scuffing on the floor tells they have left the room. But, she feels something. A sense of watching. Her mind tells her she is not alone. <br>
<br>
“Where are you?” she asks in an angry growl. “Release me and let me defend myself.” The ShadowKnight begins walking slowly around the altar where she lays. The shifting of his armor making soft clanks, his boots hitting the floor in sturdy steps. She even smells the scent of battle from him.<br>
<br>
“Lithiah, what was your first lesson?” he asks. His voice again, demanding an answer. Refusing to answer she growls low, trying to get her body to do something, anything. Just get one hand free even. Darkness remains about her as she struggles from within. “Answer.” He demands an answer giving her one last chance that she recklessly throws away.<br>
<br>
The ShadowKnight grins taking a dagger from his belt. Laying the flat of the blade across her bare stomach he asks one more time, “What was your first lesson?”<br>
<br>
Lithiah swallows hard, still unable to move, her mind panics. She growls in her only way to defend herself and struggles to move. The ShadowKnight tilts the blade causing its sharp edge to touch her skin. Her last warning to answer his question. Quieting her growl she spits out her words hatefully, “Never consider myself less than I am.”<br>
<br>
“Then…. Why are you still on the altar?” Though she cannot see him, the tone in his voice tells her he is enjoying this power over her and she growls angrily at him. She can hear he is amused as he snickers softly causing anger to rise within her. “What was the second lesson?”<br>
<br>
She calms herself, playing along with this game. What else could she do? Confused, she thinks back to the alley. Remember the taunts and punishments she spits out, “I will not obey ye.”<br>
<br>
“Almost correct.” He sneers out at her pushing the blade into her skin.<br>
<br>
Feeling the sting of her skin cutting once again she quickly states, “I will not obey.” <br>
<br>
Again he asks her, “Then….. Why are you still on the altar?” His voice menacing, taunting her causes a growl to well up in her throat that she tries to choke down.<br>
<br>
She blinks again. She can feel her eyes are open. She knows they are. But, nothing, its pitch black. Her mind torments her back to the alley. The moving wall, the grasping hands, the pain. She relives it once more her mind unable to suppress the fear and anger it raises within her. <br>
<br>
Pain sears through her body as she feels a hot substance poured over her feet. She tries to scream out being silenced with a large gag quickly shoved into her mouth. She can feel them pouring the hot substance up both her legs, the pain nearly sending her to unconsciousness. She begs in her mind to lose consciousness as the substance reaches her sensitive abdomen. <br>
<br>
Incantations fill her mind, whispers, voices, snickers, and laughter. Overwhelming her into another state of being. Still she can feel the pain of the hot substance keeping her senses peaked as it covers over her ribs slowly to her neck. An armored hand covers her mouth as the liquid is poured over her head. She panics at the air being cut off trying to inhale but is stopped by the firm grip of the hand, which could only belong to the ShadowKnight. Removing his hand, she pants against the gag in her mouth, the twisted cloth blocking some air. <br>
<br>
The heat from the liquid doesn’t fade as it seems to harden over her skin. She reels in this rapture of pain. Fear, hate, anguish all built up within her. Again she tries to scream feeling a blade of ice cut through the fiery dried substance into her skin. The blade goes deep into her skin, but avoids cutting into muscle. She pants again, the cloth now wet she rolls it with her tongue and pushes it down to breath. She hears the ShadowKnight mutter, “Good Lithiah. Fight for your life.”<br>
<br>
The carving of her skin with the blade of ice contrasted by the heat of the hard substance over her skin now seeming weak torture until they begin packing her wounds with a thick clay type substance which stings the sliced skin. Again she pants from the pain, the incantations of whispers, voices and sneering laughter rising in her head nearly deafening her. Finally she is released into unconsciousness<br>
<br>
(( Again, rough draft. Just wanted to get it out.

Her eyes open slowly focusing on the dark room about her. “What now?” she thinks to herself as robed figures enter the room where she lay curled up nude on a small cot against the wall. An Ogre brings in a large round bathing tub and the robed figures approach her slowly. Quickly she tries to stand to defend herself. Falling to the floor weakly causes a growl of anger to erupt from her.<br>
<br>
Her growl becomes louder dealing with the pain-filled movement of barely healed wounds when the robed figures move her towards the washing tub. Sliding into the hot water she bites back a wimper. A robed figure places a small pillow behind her head and pulls her hair up over the sides leaning her head back onto the pillow.<br>
<br>
Closing her eyes she lays still as the herbs in the water work it’s way deep into her pores easing away some of the pain. Four robed figures whisper chants and incantations holding their glowing blue hands over the water as it too begins to glow surrounding her body with the healing. She lays motionless feeling the hatred of the Father pulse through her veins. <br>
<br>
She hears the robed figures shuffling around the room and exiting closing the door behind them. Laying back in the water she grins to herself allowing relaxation and calm to accompany her into the tranquil moment. A dagger is thrust into her shoulder causing a sharp pain to jerk her back into reality. She opens her eyes to see the ShadowKnight standing next to the bathing tub holding the dagger pulling it swiftly out.<br>
<br>
Her hand over her open and bleeding wound she looks up at him curiously, growling away the pain. “Heal yourself.” He states blankly walking by her feet, sheathing his dagger. Whispering a soft incantation she places her slightly glowing hand over the wound healing it as much as she is able.<br>
<br>
Rising from the washing tub the water runs in droplets down her indigo skin. The ShadowKnights eyes take into appreciation the form of the young female Teir’Dal before him. He licks his lips as his eyes hungrily watch her move towards a drying blanket. His gaze deep, dark, craving, unmoving from her nude figure. He stealthly moves behind her inhaling her sweet scent. Turning to face him she bumps into him raising her ice colored eyes to meet his red, hating, lust filled gaze.<br>
<br>
Reminding himself he is her teacher for the moment he pushes his mind back into her training. They stand silently glaring at each other. His stand a challenge to her as much as hers to him. Low growls erupt from them both before he grabs her neck thrusting her up against the wall. He holds her at arms length against the wall growling out at her, “Why didn’t you get off the altar?”<br>
<br>
She grabs his wrists gasping for air as he continues, “Why aren’t you free of me now?” Growling at him she kicks at him, his armor deflecting her bare feet easily. Her eyes widen as he tightens her grip cutting off her air completely, “Free yourself.” He demands of her.<br>
<br>
Waving her hand she gates out of his grasp to appear kneeling gasping for air on the other side of the room. He turns around and looks down at her grinning, “Good…. Remember that.” He leans against the wall “Get dressed.” Her cold eyes lock on his as she slides her robe over her head and down her body.<br>
<br>
Standing he exits the room, “Let’s go. We need to get you outfitted.” She follows silently keeping herself a safe distance from him as she rubs her neck. <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top"> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm10.showPrevMessage?topicID=798.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm10.showNextMessage?topicID=798.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a self href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm10.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=798.topic&index=9><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/classic/addReply.jpg border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"><a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm10.threadControl?topicID=798.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/professional/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands</a><br> <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm10.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=798.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm10.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=798.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub94.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="firionaviefrm1">Firiona Vie General Chat<option value="firionaviefrm9">OT/OOC Forum<option value="firionaviefrm4">The Soapbox<option value="firionaviefrm62">In the Real Life News<option value="firionaviefrm58">Telegrams!<option value="firionaviefrm47">Guilds and Associations<option value="firionaviefrm10">A Bard for a Day<option value="firionaviefrm23">Hero Heart Tavern<option value="firionaviefrm15">The Polling Booth<option value="firionaviefrm40">Kudos!<option value="firionaviefrm48">Ye Olde Coffeeshop<option value="firionaviefrm57">Apep's Coffee Talk<option value="firionaviefrm2">The Market Square<option value="firionaviefrm22">The Tradeskill Shop<option value="firionaviefrm38">The Spell Library<option value="firionaviefrm59">The Battlefield<option value="firionaviefrm39">Renaissance Festival<option value="firionaviefrm42">Roleplayers Wanted/LFG<option value="firionaviefrm43">The Fighter's Den<option value="firionaviefrm44">Tower of Magick<option value="firionaviefrm45">Altar of Faith<option value="firionaviefrm12">Suggestion Box<option value="firionaviefrm6">Signature Testing<option value="firionaviefrm7">Patch Messages<option value="firionaviefrm49">Apep's Dead Horse Forum</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#A62A2A>- </font><a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie>Firiona Vie</a><font color=#A62A2A> - </font><a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm10>A Bard for a Day</a> <font color=#A62A2A> - </font><br><br><br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 7.240<br>Copyright ©1999-2003 ezboard, Inc.</center></body></html>
