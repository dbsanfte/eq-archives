Now many may not aggree with her role-play choices, but it is not their character. I commend her for trying though and think it should be allowed. Now i know that many of you disagree with me but i think slight changes in alignment should be allowed for any race to almost any alignment. <br>
how would we keep the balance? when a person makes a drastic alignment change, like DE to a neutral alignment, they become KOS to their respective race instantaineously and there they stand and must improve from there. if as drastic as evil to good, they become KOS to ALL evil races. The good still hate them also, so very careful work must be done to increase their faction. now i do not think that a Cleric or Druid should be allowed to cross their god for that would destroy their character's ability to perform their abilities being they come from 'their god' as i see it in role-play. If this could be allowed, then converting would be possible and full role-play possibilies would exist. Now what would stop all from doing this kind of change? Making good from KOS is a VERY tedious thing as i see it seems every town is split into 3 or more factions. For example, lets say this DE went to Crushbone to raise faction...killing orcs helps with guards...not the merchants. So i do think it should be possible as long as the class considered does not need to worship a god to function. This probably is only my dream because im sure the coding involved would probably be too much for the benefits given as Verant would see it. I am curious to see all of your opinions on this idea though. &quot;<br>

This is what i posted on another board....i would love to see what others think...<br>

Dhugal -- yeah, I'd like to see people changing religions and not just their alignment.  Currently, we're stuck in a &quot;your religion and class determines the flexibility of your alignment&quot;.  Real roleplaying would lead to very mutable characters.<br>
<br>
Of course, we'll have to take consequences of changes in religion.  Going from Mithaniel Marr to Erollisi Marr should not have too many repurcussions ... but Innothule to Erollisi?  Ouch ... Innothule should be hunting you down the way Hera (Greek goddess) punished anyone who defied her.<br>
<br>
To support that idea, I'd suggest &quot;missionary&quot; NPCs for various religions (maybe in the Bazaar) where you can undergo a quest.  Finish the quest, and you can change religions.  <br>
<br>
<br>
Another thought along the same lines, but this is probably impossible:  How about &quot;multiclassing&quot;.  A character starts life as a street rat (rogue), using his hide, sneak, and &quot;critical hits from the back side&quot; to survive ... he eventually earns a living as a scout and learns how to survive in the wilderness (ranger) ... a period of war comes along and he is drafted into the army (warrior).<br>

<br>
For instance if it wasn't for the obvious problems with LD, I'd like to see the /invite command only work in cities. Yes, I realize this is shocking and nasty, with many problems. But I like the thought of forcing people to meet in cities and form groups. An exception could be that guildmates can be invited to your group in any zone.<br>
<br>
Basically any further restrictions that forced people to socialize and come together would be fun for me.<br>
<br>
But I realize people HATE restrictions. They are already crying about all the ones that are in place and the low server population.<br>
<br>
SO, how about more incentives (sort of like the Sullon Zek XP Bonus):<br>
<br>
- Higher group XP bonuses (to encourage social behavior)<br>
- XP bonuses when all members of a group are same race or maybe same religion (to encourage unity of purpose for roleplaying).<br>
- General XP bonuses to those of evil or good alignments, so that people will take a stand! (Seems like many people are going Neutral for grouping reasons and I hate to see Good/Evil discouraged for game mechanics reasons on an RP server. Of course I'd hate seeing Good and Evil in the same group/guild even more!)<br>
- XP bonus if guilded (again, encourage social behavior)<br>
<br>
Anyway, feel free to think of more &quot;incentives&quot; and I'll probably support them to increase the server population. However, I will not support ANY easing of current &quot;restrictions&quot; on FV.<br>

Human warrior goes out and learns tell around level 14, then becomes a mage and learns tell past 14.  At which time he won't be able to wear normal armor, but if he focuses on all the different self buff spells like mirror image and iron skin combined with improved invisability and whatever other self defence spell a wizard in AD&amp;D has he can become a mean damage machine just with his swords.  Heck if he felt like it he could gather the stuff and smith his own magicaly enhanced weapons.  Plus there is enuff caster werable stuff in AD&amp;D that his armor class and saves wouldn't be hurting.<br>
<br>
Anyway some of the rules might be able to use a little tweeking but I am fine with almost all of them.  I love TLC and like it the way it is.  Would be nice if languages were a little easier to learn, especialy for INTL casters sence they ARE book worms.<br>

As to EXP bonus for grouping, there is one.  IF your group is all the same alighnment you can get a EXP bonus, can't remember all the details to it.  Oh and if your group is of to many opposing alighnments you can get an EXP penalty. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ubjond.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Bjond</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/white_redspot.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 54<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(12/19/01 1:18:50 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=921.topic&index=14>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> I'd do it backwards of that Grim ..</span><hr size=1>  .. penalty for same alignment, penalty for same guild, penalty for same race.

<br>
One thing is sure: people don't want, and will not stand for, penalties.<br>
<br>
And if you think a group of six people of the same race and/or religion equals a boring pack of clones nodding in harmony, which will only interact by agreeing with people... then you've met some pretty bland people.<br>
<br>
The only reason I mentioned people of similar race and/or deity grouping together, is because that was one of the stated ideas Verant had for this server. That's why there is no common tongue.<br>
<br>
Verant wanted people to meet and form sub-communites based on the race of their home town to give the server a more interesting flavor. They wanted to see young trolls grouping with other young trolls and getting to know each other to give the community a more diverse flavor. I agree that diversity is the key fun roleplay, but you have to develop your own racial identity before you can be diverse from/to anyone else. The other blue servers are so cookie-cutter and lacking in roleplay that they only difference race makes is &quot;what your toon looks like dewd&quot;.<br>
<br>
If you wanted a server full of diversity where dark elven shadow knights grouped with high elven paladins and if you think all the FV restrictions are far too narrow-minded and parochial...then I gotta ask...&quot;Why are you playing on this server at all when you don't like the ruleset?&quot; If you're just looking for low population, then there's always Antonius Bayle.<br>
<br>
Anyway, my point is this: I liked the rule set and moved here because of it. I like all the restrictions and my creativity has not been stifled.<br>
<br>
Now I see many people posting that they don't like the rule set and want to yell at Verant for changes. If you want to go back to the way other blue servers are handled, then move back to one of the twenty-some servers that have the normal rule set and leave this one alone.<br>
<br>
If Verant feels they need to get the server population up, let them come up with incentives for people to come here. But don't repeal all the rules that the majority of us came here for.<br>
