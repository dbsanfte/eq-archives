<br>
I found out yesterday a friend of mine died from brain cancer. In February. Right now I'm pretty devastated, and I'm having difficulty separating the grief from the guilt. I'm saddened by his passing, but I'm feel really badly that those of us who worked with him for three or four years didn't find out until over three months after the fact.<br>
<br>
In our defense, several of the people I had to speak to today told me they had emailed him earlier this year, but his parents said they couldn't find contact information for any of us. We only found out when my RL fianceé sent out our save-the-date announcements and his mother emailed us.<br>
<br>
Does it make me a shitty friend that he's dead and I didn't know? I mean, fuck, I haven't talked to my own <!--EZCODE UNDERLINE START--><span style="text-decoration:underline">father</span><!--EZCODE UNDERLINE END--> in over two years.<br>
<br>
No condolences please, just answer the question. Should I have tried harder to keep in contact? Am I a bad person for being relatively diffident and stand-offish unless I think there's something important to say?<br>
<br>

You are not a bad friend. People make friends and eventually tend to drift apart and lose contact, thats pretty natural. At least you are grieving for him, if you were'nt then perhaps you are a bad friend. <p><!--EZCODE CENTER START--><div style="text-align:center"><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://www.screamparks.net/eqsigs/images/hosted/dalion.jpg"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--></div><!--EZCODE CENTER END--><!--EZCODE CENTER START--><div style="text-align:center"><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=209679">Keeper of the Bunny Slippers: Flopsy and Mopsy</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--></div><!--EZCODE CENTER END--></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showUserPublicProfile?gid=melydia>Melydia</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 60<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(5/24/03 12:07 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm57.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=245.topic&index=2>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Am I a bad friend?</span><hr size=1> I would have to agree with Dalion. It is hard to keep up a relationship if you don't see someone very often, no matter how close of friends you were. I am just graduating from college now, and I keep in contact with some of my friends from high school, but the time in between e-mails or whatever can be up to six months sometimes. I just tend not to say anything unless I have something relatively important to say. For some of them, it might be a long time before I found out if something happened to them, but that doesn't mean I wouldn't care. <br>
<br>
Anyway, I think that guilt is a natural reaction to death. Even for people who don't lose touch from each other might feel guilty. For instance, someone might feel bad because the last time they saw their friend alive, they had gotten mad at them over something stupid. <br>
<br>
In my opinion, the time it took for you to find out is less important than your reaction after finding out. (After all, its not like your friend, who had your contact information, could e-mail you and tell you the news. You can't help that his parents didn't have the information.) The important thing is that you still care about what happened to your friend.<br>

<br>
How did I find out?  Buddy of mine also from high school, junior class when I graduated, emailed me since he works for the local paper, asking for information about her since he couldn't get much out of the family.<br>
<br>
I wrote back...first line in my email...<br>
<br>
&quot;Shit, she died?&quot;<br>

I had no idea.  A lot of people who go to college and also went to high school here break off and make their own friends.<br>

Was he really a friend if you had no contact with him?  I would count him as an 'old friend' or 'former friend' whom you speak with rarely.  If you had no contact with him, you can't really say you were a friend to him at all (presently anyhow).  <br>
<br>
I'm not at all critisizing...just making a point.  To me this is no big deal simply because the contact wasn't there.  Remember communication goes 2-ways.  If he didn't make the effort to contact you for such a long time, I'm sure he had other people around him to fill the spot you used to be in.  You've done nothing wrong and you should not feel bad about this.<br>
<br>
Feel a little sad that he is gone.  Remember any good ideas or thoughts that he may have brought into your life.  Move on with a clear consience.<br>

Had last seen him in July when we made an insane road trip out to a convention in Durham together. (I was driving. He kept me sane.) We'd had a hasty supper that evening at a really crappy McDonald's, I dropped him off at the Greyhound station and he went home to NYC.<br>
<br>
Then September 11 happened, and I and all of his other friends who keep in touch online were worried about him, but he popped up a couple days after the fact to let us know he was all right; he'd actually had a job interview scheduled in the second tower that morning, but he'd overslept and missed it. Freak chance. That's the sort of thing that just gives you chills.<br>
<br>
Then in late December he stopped logging on. We assumed at first he was just busy with the holidays, then we figured he must have gotten a new job that was keeping him busy (he'd had long periods of inactivity like that before). No one really worried about him; we just figured he'd pop up again eventually and we'd all give him shit for being a stranger. The following July his mother finally managed to get in touch with a few of us to let us know he'd been murdered. <br>
<br>
I cried all day.<br>
<br>
I'm not sure what the moral of the story is, but I don't think I was a bad friend. I just hope the bastard who took my friend away from me regrets it every day of his sorry life in prison. <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top"> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm57.showPrevMessage?topicID=245.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm57.showNextMessage?topicID=245.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a self href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm57.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=245.topic&index=7><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/classic/addReply.jpg border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"><a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm57.threadControl?topicID=245.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/professional/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands</a><br> <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm57.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=245.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/ultimate/subscribe.gif width=20 height=20 border=0 alt="Click to receive email notification of replies"> Click to receive email notification of replies</a> <br>  <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm57.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=245.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/ultimate/unsubscribe.gif width=20 height=20 border=0 alt="Click to stop receiving email notification of replies"> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies</a> <br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub94.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="firionaviefrm1">Firiona Vie General Chat<option value="firionaviefrm2">The Market Square<option value="firionaviefrm4">The Soapbox<option value="firionaviefrm6">Signature Testing<option value="firionaviefrm7">Patch Messages<option value="firionaviefrm9">OT/OOC Forum<option value="firionaviefrm10">A Bard for a Day<option value="firionaviefrm12">Suggestion Box<option value="firionaviefrm15">The Polling Booth<option value="firionaviefrm22">The Tradeskill Shop<option value="firionaviefrm23">Hero Heart Tavern<option value="firionaviefrm38">The Spell Library<option value="firionaviefrm39">Renaissance Festival<option value="firionaviefrm40">Kudos!<option value="firionaviefrm42">Roleplayers Wanted/LFG<option value="firionaviefrm43">The Fighter's Den<option value="firionaviefrm44">Tower of Magick<option value="firionaviefrm45">Altar of Faith<option value="firionaviefrm47">Guilds and Associations<option value="firionaviefrm48">Ye Olde Coffeeshop<option value="firionaviefrm49">Apep's Dead Horse Forum<option value="firionaviefrm57">Apep's Coffee Talk<option value="firionaviefrm58">Telegrams!<option value="firionaviefrm59">The Battlefield<option value="firionaviefrm62">In the Real Life News<option value="firionaviefrm63">Ayrielle's Story Contest!</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#A62A2A>- </font><a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie>Firiona Vie</a><font color=#A62A2A> - </font><a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm57>Apep's Coffee Talk</a> <font color=#A62A2A> - </font><br><br><br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 7.245c<br>Copyright ©1999-2003 ezboard, Inc.</center></body></html>
