------------------------<br>
<br>
You missed the big one: TIME.<br>
<br>
Dungeon crawls take a big time investment. Screaming for a group in [insert Kunark zone appropriate for your level] can be done in an hour or two.<br>
<br>
I always figured I needed a 4-5 hour commitment minimum to a good dungeon crawl (Befallen, Guks, Najena, TOFS, CC, etc.)<br>
<br>
In all the games I've played, the most fun evening I ever had was a long crawl with 4 friends through Droga/Nurga. Nobody had ever been there. Most stuff was blue, but in enough numbers and with freinds enough to scare us. It was incredible. But we started at 7pm and ended around 2am--7 hours. Work nights I have to be in bed by 10pm or I'm overtired and rip (L)users heads off when they bother me.  <br>
<br>
Kunark outdoor zones offered EQ to the casual gamer. Even with them, the time factor required of EQ was one of many reasons that I left the game. The game was my friends and I just didn't have the time to catch up with them in levels.<br>
<br>
On the subject in general of the latter stages of games, you might look at Designer Dragon's site about the evolution of online games (<!--EZCODE AUTOLINK START--><a href="http://www.legendmud.org/raph/).">www.legendmud.org/raph/).</a><!--EZCODE AUTOLINK END--> He was the lead designer of UO for a long period--the Brad of that game. One of the things he notes is that as time goes on, the low and mid-game move higher and higher. Creatures are more easily taken out because strategies have been worked out. The game (whatever game) has a sort of inflation towards the high end. Some of the simplification of the under 10 game seems to mirror this thought. <br>

<br>
I mean no offense here, so don't take this the wrong way, but clearly I would say you are someone who has never stepped foot into a dungeon then, because your time assessment (for the most part) is all wrong. <br>
<br>
When Cazic Thule was a popular zone (pre-kunark), you could walk into that zone and have a group in 5 minutes. It was fairly small dungeon, with a lot of isolated side-rooms (which helped reduce zone-wide trains), that only would take a few seconds to get to. There were plenty of times I would logon, and within 2-5 minutes I was physically in a group and fighting. <br>
<br>
Now, mind you, it wasn't this way when I first stepped foot in that zone. At lower levels, my first few trips there, nobody knew me, and it took time to build a reputation. But in a dungeon like that, in a few days time, you can build a reputation, and then finding a group fast is no problem. <br>
<br>
(sidebar: Cazic Thule, and Guk, are two of the best designed multiplayer dungeons I've seen. I only wish Verant had made more dungeons like them. Unrest, Karnors, and Mistmoore suffered from the one-main-path problem, which would cause any train to cover the whole zone... and then the Kunark dungeons really ruined it, because they were almost all designed in a linear fashion, and not to be &quot;camped&quot;)<br>
<br>
I've played it both ways. I've spent time in nearly every dungeon that was popular, and I've put 3-4 twinks through the Kunark outdoor zones as well. For most any situation, finding a group comes down to reputation. It can actually be faster to find a group in a dungeon, depending on the popularity of the zone and the reputation you have earned. <br>
<br>
Most of the dungeons I prefer are not dungeons that are linear. I think the linear dungeons, while good for single player games, basically suck for games like EQ. People need to be able to treat a dungeon the same way they treat an outdoor zone: login, shout for group, find one, get there, and begin fighting in a designated &quot;camp&quot;. Moving around in a linear dungeon, like Howling Stones, or Nurga, is fine, *if* you have the time committment.  <br>
<br>
Dungeons like Nurga and Droga, I have railed against since thier inception. They are totally stupid designs. <br>
<br>
But dungeons like Cazic Thule, Guk, and portions of Velks, are designed very well. You can get in there, group up, and fight, in the same amount of time that it would take you to do so in an outdoor zone. <br>
<br>
The problem with Kunark released dungeons, being linear, is that they changed the perception for gamers. People who had never stepped foot into Unrest, Guk or Cazic Thule had no idea what a well designed multi-player dungeon was like. They only saw dungeons like Droga and Nurga, and ran screaming. <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> Because you are right about those dungeons</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->: They are linear, and they require a serious time committment if you want to &quot;crawl&quot; through them. <br>
<br>
The point is, not every dungeon was designed that way, and many of the old-world dungeons make far better exp zones than anyth outdoor zone anywhere else on Norrath. But, unless it's a high level dungeon, it can be useless to a lower level group, who doesn't possess the high-level tools to do dungeons well. <br>
<br>
For most people, their first exposure to a &quot;dungeon&quot;, post-Kunark, was Karnor's Castle. That's a level 50 dungeon. At that time, druids have egress and evac and clerics finally have a decent rez. That dungeon becomes doable. <br>
<br>
But pre-level 50, dungeons aren't worth the hassle. They were before Kunark was released, because until Kunark came out, nothing compared to the dungeons. Post Kunark, it was simple: Why go to Cazic Thule when you could get the SAME experience modifier in an outdoor, safe, Kunark zone? <br>
<br>
People chose outdoors. And rightfully so. Without a good cleric rez, and evacs, and corpse summons, why go to all the bother? Pre-Kunark you were almost forced to, and we all made it work. But give the players an easy alternative, and what are they going to chose? <br>
<br>
<br>
I've met a lot of total n00bs to EQ in the past year, on my old server, while playing twinks. Most of them had no idea what the old-school dungeons were like. They had no idea how good the exp and loot were. If you *could* manage to get some of those people to go with you, they almost always loved it. But it was so hard to get them to go. Most people hated that the dungeons were so far away from bind points for melee, and that rezzes and such were far and few between. <br>
<br>
I think if you gave clerics the proper rezzes at low levels, and druid/wizards the proper evacs/egress/ports at lower levels, then certain dungeons might rise in popularity. <br>
<br>
At any rate.. I feel mostly that it's a design flaw. I can't fault players for being afraid, or having a misconception about the time committment. Nobody wants to lose their corpse, and nobody wants to spend more than few minutes on CR. I wish things were different, but they're not. <br>

The vision was of a hard core, challenging, mutually dependant type of game. From that perspective it is a great game. The Problem is that it is such a fun game that it crossed boundaries and us casual gamers infested it also. <br>
<br>
What I would like to see, in games of this type is what I suggested earlier. Categorize players and design servers around them (elite to causal, to pvp, to roleplay etc.). <br>
<br>
The feeling I got from Brad's reply was that the tendency for the future is that there will be different games to cater to different player classes. What I would like to see more of is all games catering to all (or specific levels of players).<br>
<br>
To me this would allow a company to reach a broader audience as well as benefit players. It may be too late for an established game such as EQ, but it would have been nice to see elite servers for the hard core gamers, and casual types for, well, the casual types. <br>
<br>

Here's something realy interesting though. If you go to Dark Age of Camelot and talk to disgruntled ex-EQ players (probably half the playerbase) what single factor in EQ they miss the most. Almost everyone answers that they miss the classic &quot;crawl&quot; dungeons like Droga and Nurga. (Most dungeons in DAOC are like the ones you describe--campers in every room and easy access.)<br>
<br>
From my point of view, whether or not I have a roof over my head is of little importance. Sitting in a single spot in Guk or Stonehenge Barrows is no different than sitting in Lyonesse or Dreadlands. <p><table border=0 cellpadding=4 cellspacing=0><tr><td><img src="http://home.tampabay.rr.com/legolaas/images/numtini-100.jpg" width="52" height="100"></td><td><table style="font-family:verdana,arial;" border=0 cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0><tr><td style="font-size:10pt;"><A HREF="http://pub94.ezboard.com/unumtini.showPublicProfile?language=EN" title="<insert popup caption here>" style="color:#ff0000;font-weight:700;">Numtini Lightheart</A></td></tr><tr><td style="font-size:10pt;">46th Season Gnome of Death</td></tr><tr><td style="font-size:10pt;">Member, <A HREF="http://pub96.ezboard.com/beqcivismacto" title="Civis Macto Website" style="color:#ff0000;">Civis Macto</A></td></tr></table></td></tr></table>

<br>
In classic RPG fashion. You and a group of people would crawl through a dungeon and defeat the big bad boss at the end. Problem with EQ is that all dungeons don't work that way, only the planes.<br>
<br>
You and a group of players all get together to reach the bottom of this fierce dungeon. The goal is to kill the overlord's henchmen and the Overlord himself. On the way there slaying all minions that get in your way. In EQ you battle your way down to a henchmen and find out he's not there. So you stand around for hours waiting for him to &quot;spawn&quot;. After he spawns you keep working you way down. Finally you get to the bad boy himself and guess what?.... he isn't there as well. So you and group of fellow players stand around for hours waiting for him to &quot;spawn&quot; to kill him. Hours go by and still hasn't spawned.<br>
<br>
Only the planes in EQ were to me the best dungeon crawl there was. Each plane had a different way of being completed. The henchmen were always up and the Overlord himself is always where he should be. It gave everyone there a feel of achievement. Waiting around for the climax of the crawl is like watching Star Wars Episode 2 and having the movie paused for hours for bathroom break right before the ending.<br>
<br>
The spoils of the fight in plane raids are actually good. Someone will leave with something they feel was worth it all, increasing the achievement of the fight. With normal dungeon crawl not everyone will leave with something or with anything at all.<br>
<br>
DAoC didn't have planes when it first came out. What I think people were referring to was the plane type raids that EQ is so famous for. That is why months after the game came out Mythic added planes to each realm. People were begging for a true old style dungeon crawl that everyone can benefit from and feel like they've done something important. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/bfirionavie.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=vick>Vick</A> at: 5/22/02 12:27:30 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ukrazakthule.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Krazak Thule</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 46<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(5/22/02 1:34:03 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1984.topic&index=53>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Dungeon Crawls</span><hr size=1> The problem with any dungeon &quot;Crawl&quot; is that such a thing is designed to be done once. Like I said above, this is *great* for a single player game like Baldur's Gate. <br>
<br>
This is undoable in a large, persistant, MMORPG, like EQ.<br>
<br>
In my opinion, you have to design the dungeon around the game. In huge, MMORPG's like EQ, you need dungeons like Guk. They are well designed, and can allow for multiple parties of adventurers to inhabit at one time. Most of the &quot;camps&quot;, where named montsers spaw, are isolated in such ways that a train from one of them to the zoneout doesn't run over the other parts of the dungeon (this is a problem with dungeons like Mistmoore and Unrest). <br>
<br>
The dungeon is also level-based somewhat. The assassin room is a place where people level 35-40 can easily camp it, where as the Lord room is a place where higher level people are required. <br>
<br>
When that dungeon is at max capacity, it can support upwards of 50 people. <br>
<br>
<br>
Now, I'm not saying &quot;crawl&quot; dungeons can't, or shouldn't be put into games like EQ. They can be popular. Howling Stones is one such dungeon. <br>
<br>
But a &quot;crawl&quot; dungeon, especially one that is physically designed to promote that type of experience (one-way drop offs and zone-out points that are far away from zone-in points) requires a higher time committment from the players, and requires different tools in terms of spells. <br>
<br>
For instance, if you die in Guk at level 35 in the assassin room, there's a good chance that there is a level 49 cleric somewhere near the Lord/Magus/Frenzied Ghoul room that can rez you. Because of the way the dungeon is designed, you (or a friend) will probably be able to drag your corpse to them. They will likely help you because they won't have to give up their camp. <br>
<br>
Now... take a dungeon like Droga. If you die there, you have to do CR, starting from the beginning. And if there, for some reason, is a 49 cleric in the zone, they probably wont' help you, because they would have to give up their camp to go fetch you. <br>
<br>
Linear dungeons work great in single player games because if you screw up, you can just hit &quot;load&quot; and go back to your last savegame. If you bite it in a linear dungeon in EQ, you have to restart from the beginning, and this time without your gear. <br>
<br>
Now, biting it in Howling Stones, and biting it in Droga, are two different things. <br>
<br>
Suppose you and your group wipeout in Howling Stones. If you're group has a cleric, he/she is probably level 50, and has a rez that will get you back most of your exp. If you had a druid/wiz with you, some of you probably were able to evac to a safe place and port to SF. And if you had a necro/sk with you, they were probably high enough level to summon you. <br>
<br>
But suppose your group of level 35's and 40's dies in Droga. You're cleric is at least 9 levels away from a rez that means something. Your necro or sk can't summon corpses yet (which means having to fight your way down with inferior backup gear, or paying high levels to come do it). The druid/wiz in your group might have an evac, but it probably puts you a continent away... <br>
<br>
From my perspective, this all comes down to tools. It has seemed to me, all through my EQ life, that classes don't really start to shine until level 50. At that point, you finally get all of the good spells, and everything else is just a matter of getting stronger and doing things better. <br>
<br>
This seems especially true for clerics... <br>
<br>
There are certain spells and abilities that are central to a particular class. I'd love to see these class-defining abilities given to classes at extremely low levels. I think this would promote two things: <br>
<br>
(1) Players would get a *true* feel for their class at a much lower level. I think you'd see people finding a class that they were truly happy with at a much earlier stage in their character's life. I think this would be good. <br>
<br>
(2) Players would become more knowlegeable about their class much sooner. People would start learning tactics at a much younger level. <br>
<br>
As it is now, people really don't learn good grouping techniques, and raiding techniques, until after level 46.. <br>
<br>
That seems like 46 levels that are overlooked, to me. <br>

There are lots of players who have never gotten to level 50 and many who never will.  I can't agree with a statement this blanket.<br>

EQ can be fun at first level.  I don't see why one needs ALL the good spells to have fun. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ukrazakthule.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Krazak Thule</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 48<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(5/22/02 3:04:29 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1984.topic&index=55>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Fun</span><hr size=1> I wasn't trying to make any blanket statement about *FUN* <br>
