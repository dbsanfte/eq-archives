<br>
I think it is very important not to have the global omnipotence that the /who command gives to maintain a semblance of roleplaying.<br>
<br>
Besides which ... it gives rogues a chance to actually be &quot;sneaky&quot;.  <br>
<br>
People who are &quot;/lfg on&quot;  have &lt;LFG&gt; next to their names in the current /who list.  These people also have an asterisk next to the name floating above their heads.  (ie, if Ankles was lfg, she would be *Ankles)<br>
<br>
If you're looking for a particular class, you should /shout it over the zone.  Yeah ... shout is not all-zone-wide ... but that's roleplaying for you.  Verant's vision for Firiona Vie was to have players get entire parties together in a town and then head out to the wilderness -- very different from what is prevalent in any other server (go up to a camp you want and join the list).<br>

Yeah ... I understand how specific classes are needed for high-end encounters.  But going back to the old system just because that is what everyone did on the other servers is not a good enough reason to get out of roleplay.<br>
<br>
That's like saying:<br>
<br>
&quot;we should turn the ooc channel back on because that is the easiest way to talk over the entire zone during a high-end raid.&quot;<br>
<br>
... or ...<br>
<br>
&quot;we should let any alignment group with any other alignment because we need both evil and good -aligned clerics in various groups for the raid.&quot;<br>
<br>
... or ...<br>
<br>
&quot;we should remove the language barrier so that raids are easier to do.&quot;<br>
<br>
... or ...<br>
<br>
&quot;we should allow for multiple characters so that we can make spawn-check twinks (ie, camp a newbie ranger just to check on rare spawns with tracking)&quot;<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Instead of doing an omniscient &quot;/who all warrior 45 60&quot; or something like that, players on Firiona Vie *have* to learn of other characters thru either first-hand knowledge or word of mouth ... the way an actual character would do in-game.<br>
<br>
Leader: &quot;Hey gang!  We need a warrior to replace Beeegphist.&quot;<br>
Bard: &quot;Just do a /who all ... DOH, you can't&quot;<br>
Leader: &quot;Yeah ... so do you know anyone who can help?&quot;<br>
Ranger: &quot;Hold on ... lemme ask the guild ...&quot;<br>
Wizard: &quot;Let me check my friends list ...&quot;<br>
Cleric: &quot;Someone owes me a favor from when I rezzed him ...&quot;<br>
Druid:  &quot;I just ported one to West Commons an hour ago, let me ask her ...&quot;<br>
Leader: &quot;Great!  Tell them to send me a tell&quot;<br>

Yes, I agree it's harder.

Even without anon, it's is by far one the most tedious activities in EQ.  Increasing the time spent doing something that is not fun is not good.  The forced anon is probably the single worst thing about FV and will likely be what forces more people to leave than anything else, though they'll phrase it as &quot;I'm bored&quot; or &quot;can't get a group&quot; instead of &quot;don't like /anon&quot;.<br>
<br>
I did a ton of group leading on my last server.  It is a lot of work setting up a group.  Sometimes for a week or even a couple of months, it's really easy and you have a steady set that just seems to be there all the time for you (and vice versa).  That's fantastic when it happens, but then the cleric roams off or whatnot and you have to setup all over again.<br>
<br>
I'd say post-50, I spent about 60% of the time setting up groups.  I'd go off and solo-camp some green ultra-rare quest mob that hadn't spawned in 4 months, do &quot;who all xxx&quot;, and send out tells to people as I saw them log in.  Sure, I knew all of them (by 50+, you really do know nearly everyone), but there's just no way I could have kept it up by name and not by class.<br>
<br>
Sure, it's possible to limp along with everyone anon.  It's definitely not desirable, though.  What we really need is to expand the search capabilities, not reduce them.  Make it so groups can advertise for classes &amp; levels they need as well as for people to advertise availability.  The current &quot;/who all xxx&quot; is pretty pathetic, so tie it up in a nice interface so people don't have to spend all their time looking and can spend more time actually playing.<br>
<br>
With anon it's even worse.  Currently, the very first question asked of anyone that is LFG is &quot;what's your class &amp; level?&quot;.  I'm even thinking about hotkey'ing it.  IMHO, asking someone class and level is a lot more jaring wrt. suspension of disbelief than being able to do &quot;/who&quot; and seeing it there without asking or being asked.<br>
<br>
Getting people together so they can play is what this is about, whether it's for killing XP MOBs, or questing, or chatting up an RP storm.  Puting artificial bariers up that make it harder and more tedious for people to do those things for which they bought the game is bad. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=d1c3b5><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub94.ezboard.com/urobingoodfellow.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Robin Goodfellow</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 18<br> <font color=#A62A2A>(12/18/01 2:26:17 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=920.topic&index=5>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: This would be a huge ..</span><hr size=1> I agree with Stormtower here.<br>
<br>
I've found it ridiculously easy to pull together groups if you go to a city zone and /auction.  I had people fall out the woodwork for a group I put together that way.<br>
<br>
I can't understand why people think that the /anon thing is what's keeping this server population low.  That's ludicrous.  That's the easiest of the server's rules to get around: talk to the people you run into.  Ask them their class and their level, or just watch them.  Use /consider on players--it'll give you a general idea if they're in your level range or not.<br>
<br>
Please, let's be honest.  The reason this server's population is low is because twinking is difficult, and near impossible without having two accounts.  A good number of players on the other servers don't understand how to play without powerleveling and twinking.  This has nothing to do with /anon.<br>

...people are leaving because they can't find groups?  And you only start having trouble finding groups when you're 50+?  So all these people who are supposedly leaving are 50+, right?  That is, of course, the logical extension of this argument.  In fact, that's the only way this argument coheres, and, of course, it's still ludicrous.  There are only a handful of 50+ characters on the server to begin with.<br>

I'm very aware of the low population on this server and the group-needs when you reach the higher levels.  I've played several classes to mid-level just to discover that I'm extremely dependent on groups.  (Which is one reason I liked my first bard character ... solo? sure.  Get a group? even easier.)<br>
<br>
But the forced /roleplay IS one of the many things that makes this server a lot different from any other.  I don't want to get /tells out of the blue &quot;Hi, elder brother bard.  Got some stuff a new singer can use?&quot;  or &quot;Hey, you're a bard, right?  Get your butt to Vox, we need you to sing resist buffs&quot;.  I can imagine it's even worse for clerics:  &quot;Hello Mr. Cleric, Rezz plz now thx ... &quot;<br>
<br>
Take the /roleplay away from the ruleset, and what you have is a server that's almost exactly like any other server<br>
<br>
the language barrier is not that big (easy to skill up while waiting for a group near a zone line)<br>
<br>
the alignment barrier can be overcome (everyone just choose neutral to make it easy)<br>
<br>
and city binding doesn't really matter when you have portals and translocates at the high-end game (who cares, only the unskilled use zergling tactics anyway).<br>
<br>
<br>
/roleplay forces the players on this server to find constant companions, trusted associates, and stable guilds.  Developing those relationships are a true test of social skills far different from &quot;/ooc Lord Room group looking for a healer, send tell&quot;.<br>

I have always been a strong proponent of roleplaying, and fight for this playstyle on my own 99% non-RP server I play on most of the time. When I came to play on FV as well, I loved the new ruleset.<br>
<br>
I agree with the languages, the grouping restrictions, the /ooc removal, the range limit on /shout, and the single character per server rules wholeheartedly, as they promote this server and its distinct RP attitude and community.<br>
<br>
But even I, a stalwart of the RP aproach, find the permanent /roleplay setting, with no visibility of class/level, too much to bear. It is simply put, for those of us who do not want to be in large guilds, almost impossible to get balanced groups for anything, even at low level.<br>
<br>
This fact alone has made me more and more reluctant to play here, though I love this place in principle and the types who play here, because I can find groupmates on Lanys, even with my strict RP rules, far more easily than on FV, especially when I play (in European peak time, not American). I do not find being LFG and bored or soloing all the time fun AT ALL. I know very well, if this one thing were lifted, these problems would be wiped away.<br>
<br>
That is my take on this, anyway.<br>
<br>
Be well, everyone. And I will still be around (just more often on Lanys than here).<br>
