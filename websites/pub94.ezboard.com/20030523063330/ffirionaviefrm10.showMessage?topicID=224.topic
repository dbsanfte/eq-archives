Yawning and stretching I swung my legs off the side of the bed and clumsily got to my feet.<br>
<br>
I crossed the room to the basin of water in the corner, splashing my face with it and preparing for the day.  I pulled my armor from the stand and dressed myself.  Sitting on the bed, donning my boots, I began to think.   I had only one guess where I could find my husband.  Shaking my head of the thoughts of having to retrieve him from that incipid mold factory he'd become a fiend for. <br>
<br>
I peeked out my door, hoping to see him strolling down the hall.  'No luck', I thought.  Just as I was about to close the door, I kicked a scroll that had been slid under the door.  I unrolled the parchment and began to read:<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i>   Restoria,<br>
I am in need of a priest and warrior to aid me in the settling of an old score with the Mistress Drusilla of Sathir.  If you would accompany me, I assure you it will be nothing short of an adventure.</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> <br>
<br>
I stopped reading for a moment, 'With the way you pull, there's no doubt.'  I chuckled to myself.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i>   If you would be so good as to join me, contact Baron Witherweaver Wyntari and he will provide the transportation  to lessen your travel time.<br>
<br>
                                                  Regards,<br>
                                                  Qixx </i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> <br>
<br>
Being on the moon has its disadvantages, for I could not gage the time of day and hadn't a clue how long the scroll lay underneath my door.  I gathered my bags and set out to find Kritical.  I strolled onto the cobblestone streets of Shadow Haven, which showed a decent amount of activity from the shoppers and tavern patrons in the streets.  &quot;Hmm must still be early yet... good.&quot;<br>
<br>
I continued through the Caverns and into the dank dark swamplands of the Grove.  Just as I suspected, there he was, doused in fungal fluids from harvesting the shrieker mushrooms.  Quite a delicasy in soup, I might add.<br>
<br>
&quot;Up for some adventure, my love?&quot;<br>
<br>
He hacked into the last remaining mushroom and looked up at me, wiping the sweat from his brow.<br>
<br>
&quot;I suppose I could be persueded.&quot; He grinned.<br>
<br>
I smiled mischieviously,&quot;It will provide quite an experience.. Qixx invited us.&quot;<br>
<br>
He chuckled.  &quot;Sure, lets go.&quot;<br>
<br>
I sent word upon the winds for Witherweaver to meet us in the marketplace known as the Bazarre, hoping that would allow us time to stop by the inn and get the smell of fungus off Krit's armor.<br>
<br>
&quot;Walk down wind please.&quot; I grinned, holding my nose and quickening my pace to avoid the musky smell.<br>
<br>
'Haha! Suffer!&quot; He shouted, running after me and grabbing me around the waste, hugging me tightly.<br>
<br>
I sighed, resolved to live with the stench.  &quot;Well, we've smelled worse I suppose.&quot; I giggled.<br>
<br>
When we reached the Bazarre, Witherweaver was waiting for us.  The Tier 'Dal stood proud in his dark green robe, threaded with royal blue insignias.<br>
<br>
&quot;Ready you two?&quot; He spoke human tongue as well as I, and he motioned for us to join and we went to a quiet area near the stables so he could chant the portal spell with no interruptions.<br>
<br>
His incantation was brief, we disappeared from the marketplace, in a large ball of flame leaving only a little smoke from where we once stood.<br>
<br>
A hole opened up in the sky in the dragon infested lava pits known as Skyfire.  Realizing that we weren't in the most ideal of places, we hurried quickly through, carefully avoiding the wandering wurms.<br>
<br>
Qixx was waiting for us just through the cave separating skyfire from Overthere. &quot;Thanks for coming, guys.&quot; He smiled, grinning his goofy scaled grin.<br>
<br>
&quot;Are we it?&quot; I asked cautiously.<br>
<br>
Qixx chuckled, knowing that walking into our destination would be quite difficult without the aid of a rogue.  &quot;Lolo and Mezz are meeting us at the canyon.&quot;<br>
<br>
'Ahh, a nice test of skill for Mezz' I thought to myself, as he had hopes of wearing the insignia of our guild and I had yet to see his skill for myself to judge.  Sure enough, there stood another Tier'Dal in a shining purple robe, some even thought it to be weaved out of metallic threads.  I didnt see the rogue though.<br>
<br>
Just as that thought passed through my head, a human female clad in black armor emerged from the shadows, the epic ragebringer piercer aimed at the weakest point in Kritical's armor.<br>
<br>
&quot;Gimme all your loots!&quot; she exclaimed, giggling as she poked him with the very tip of the blade.<br>
<br>
Kritical jumped, nearly losing his balance at the edge of the canyon.<br>
<br>
&quot;Hey Lolo.&quot; Kritical said, turning to her and regaining his composure.<br>
<br>
&quot;I got you so bad!&quot; Lolodory laughed.<br>
<br>
Kritical raised an eyebrow at her, &quot;Bah, I'll deal with you later!&quot; <br>
<br>
Witherweaver dug through his bags and produced a handful of batwings.  He waved his hands quickly, chanting and threw the wings into the air.  They crumbled into dust, and as it rained down upon us, each of us began to float.<br>
<br>
&quot;Thanks Wither.&quot; I said as we started down the large canyon, and through the temple entrance, passing enormous scorpions.  We came to a dead end in the maze,  a red glowing orb in the center.<br>
<br>
&quot;We all have keys, right?&quot; Kritical asked, eager to get on with the adventure.<br>
<br>
Lolodory frowned as she looked through her bags.  &quot;I guess I dont.&quot; she sighed, pulling out a lockpick and attempted to pick the virtually invisible lock holding the orbs door to Charsis from opening.<br>
<br>
&quot;No problem, I'll get MY druid slave to give you one.&quot;  Qixx laughed, calling out his for long time friend Beornn.<br>
<br>
Beornn agreed to bring the rogue a key, and Lolodory suggested we go inside lest we wake the scorpions sleeping nearby.  We stepped into the dungeon also known as Howling Stones, and I began casting protection spells on all of us.  <br>
<br>
'At least I'll have time for some meditation before we start.' I thought to myself, knowing the impatience of my husband to run into battle with me unprepared.<br>
<br>
Lolodory thanked Beornn and stepped inside.<br>
<br>
&quot;Good.  Now we can begin.&quot; Kritical said enthusiastically.<br>
<br>
We carefully explored the underground castle, Qixx running ahead to survey the scene.<br>
<br>
&quot;Through here.&quot; he pointed at a small set of stairs leading to a painting of what appeared to be lizard royalty.  Sure enough, the painting was an illusion, and we walked through it, stumbling a few paces where stairs should have been on the other side.<br>
<br>
The room was filled with a few animated iksar bones and some large stoney golems, who didnt really care for our intrusion.<br>
<br>
Hacking and slashing, kicking, piercing and blasting ensued, and the room was cleared, leaving only dust, and bloodstained walls as a reminder of the guardians of the room.<br>
<br>
We pressed on, deeper through the castle, and came to a hallway where the tapestries looked finer, the candles burned brighter and even the walls looked as though they were comprised of better building material.<br>
<br>
&quot;We must be close.&quot;  Mezzmorizer said.<br>
<br>
&quot;Aye, her room is around the corner.&quot; Qixx whispered. <br>
<br>
&quot;Well, are we ready?&quot;  Kritical asked, looking at me.<br>
<br>
&quot;One moment.&quot;  I answered, kneeling in prayer.  <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i>   Karana, grant me your wisdom and blessings to protect my friends in this battle. </i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
With that I arose, instantly feeling better.  Casting final blessings on my friends, we prepared for battle.<br>
<br>
&quot;Now Im ready.&quot; I stated calmly.<br>
<br>
That was all the monk needed to hear.  He disappeared around the corner.<br>
<br>
&quot;Qixx pull incomming!&quot; he shouted, running back to us and falling to the ground, allowing Kritical to taunt  the foes.<br>
<br>
Mezzmorizer chanted quickly, and the additional mobs grew silent, standing as if statues, forgetting why they had been angered in the first place, allowing Kritical to focus on the royal mistress of the castle herself, Drusilla of Sathir.<br>
<br>
Kritical swung fiercly, slahing at the lizard boned mistress with dual swords whirring through the air, making a voilent 'clang!'  as it sheered through her bones.<br>
<br>
Lolodory ran behind, avoiding the large boney tail, swinging menacingly and piercing the weakened remaining flesh of the her back, and poking into the spine.<br>
<br>
Flames danced on Witherweaver's fingers as he chanted loudly, eyes closed in concentration.  Loud booms erupted in the air and the smell of singed bones followed each incantation.<br>
<br>
Qixx jumped up into the air, landing clawed feet at her skull with precision.<br>
<br>
I watched, a few steps away, for any sign of weakness or injury from my party members, ready to cure them and send them back into battle as new.  I shouted out the ancient words, pouring a celestial elixir onto my husband, watching his health renew over the course of the battle.<br>
<br>
One of Drusilla's guardian golems awoke from his magical dreamworld, recalling who had made him drousy, he ran straight at Mezzmorizer.  Knowing illusionists have little stamina for combat battle, I thought quickly, and chanted one of my oldest spells, taught to me in the earliest days of clericing.  <br>
<br>
The golem froze, shaking its head violently.. stunned.  This allowed Mezz the time to recant his spell, putting the beast back into his magic enduced slumber.<br>
<br>
The battle raged on, all 6 of us testing the limits of our abilities in the close quarters of this hallway.<br>
<br>
Soon after, all the foes lay still at the feet of my party, a gory pile of bloody flesh, crumpled bones and stone.<br>
<br>
We collapsed to the ground, resting a moment from the furious battle.<br>
<br>
&quot;So Qixx, what was this old score we just settled with her?&quot; I asked, helping everyone dress their wounds.<br>
<br>
&quot;Nothing really,&quot; he grinned. &quot;I just wanted to piss Venril off.&quot;<br>
<br>
We all laughed as he knelt over the marrow that once was Drusilla.  &quot;But we got this.&quot;  He smiled.. scooping up a vial of tears.<br>
<br>
We all grinned, the thrill of the battle would have to suffice this time.... perhaps the item he seeks is still down that canyon in the underground castle waiting to be found.<br>
<br>
Witherweaver took a handful of shards, circling them around our heads we all disbursed, tired and hungry to retreat to our camps and prepare to explore another day.<br>

<br>
My head flew up off a pile of books when a small scroll mysteriously landed upon my desk.  I must have fallen asleep studying again.  <br>
<br>
&quot;Witherweaver.  We require your assistance in the magical art of transportation to venture into the depths of Charasis and kill the vile Drusella Sathir&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Damn it all!&quot; I cursed.  &quot;What am I their damned transportation service?  Don't the recognize my power and my potential?&quot;<br>
<br>
I decided that I should turn on my new gnomish tinkering device contrapted by Bend, our local rogue and tinkerer.  The device crushed beans from a local plant growing in the plains of Karana (a dreaded place indeed), and mixed them in heated water.  It turns out that the beans have a substance in them which makes people more amiable.<br>
<br>
After drinking a long goblet of the dark liquid, I read the letter again.<br>
<br>
&quot;Wow that feels much better.  I guess I can come.  I never really liked the Sathirs' much, anyway.  Perhaps I can even hone my skills and furhter my study of wizardry.&quot;<br>
<br>
I immediately sent word to Restoria, and her arrogant husband, Kritical: &quot;Get ready I'm coming&quot;.  <br>
<br>
I mumbled some magical incantations and the world around me blurs as I find myself in the wonderous spires of the Nexus.  I made my way to the bazaar to meet the pale-skinned duo.  <br>
<br>
There they were.  All shiny with armor and swords and such.<br>
<br>
&quot;Let's go,&quot; I said<br>
<br>
I began to again to mumble some magical incantations, with the intention of bringing us to the volcanic mountaints of Skyfire.  But then a suddent thought struck me.  Perhaps I have been associating myself with these pale skins too long, but I got a feeling of concern for their safety.  I decided I should use my magics to first hide them from view so that wurms and drakes of Skyfire did not eat them alive.  They probably wouldn't last too long there, anyway, without powerful magics such as mine to keep them alive.<br>
<br>
After taking precautionary measures, I mumbled the incantations to bring us to Skyfire.  As the world blurred and cleared up again, I saw Restoria rumbling through her backpacks.<br>
<br>
&quot;For the love of Karana!&quot;  Restoria exclaims, and immediately casts a spell which I recognize as gate.<br>
<br>
I cast a sidewise glance at Kritical.<br>
<br>
&quot;She had forgotten her key in the bazaar,&quot; Kritical explains.<br>
<br>
Witherweaver sighs, clearly dissapointed.  &quot;I suppose I better go meet her then and bring her back.  You go ahead, I'll catch up with you.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;But I don't know the way,&quot; said Kritical.<br>
<br>
Witherweaver sighs, clearly disappointed.  Do they not make maps where pale skins come form?  &quot;I shall be right back.&quot;<br>
<br>
So after another short drip to the Bazaar, we finally begin to make our way to The Overthere, in which lies the ancient estate of Venril Sathir, Charasis, known to adventurers today as Howling Stones, dubbed so no doubt due to the screams of dying adventurers in the depths of the dungeon that can mysteriously be heard above the rocks in the Overthere.<br>
<br>
So we made our way through Skyfire Mountains, dodging the occasional wurm and lava pool.  As we were making our way into the Overthere I found the iksar martial arts master, Qixx.  &quot;Good,&quot; I thought, &quot;we're going to need his experience for this one.&quot;  I rummaged through my packs and found some batwings, and uttered the words to make my friends fly through the air.  &quot;You're going to need this unless you like falling to your death&quot; I explained to them.<br>
<br>
As we were heading towards Charasis, Qixx informed us that Mezzmorizer and Lolodory were still at the undead outpost up north.  <br>
<br>
&quot;Damn it all!   Is this thing ever going to get started?&quot; I thought impatiently.  &quot;I'll get them,&quot; I told my friends.<br>
<br>
I quickly ran up to the outpost at which I had spent many of my earlier years gaining experience in the arts of wizardry.  The gargoyles Corundium and Tourmaline quickly noticed me and smiled my way.  I nodded back at them in recognition, remembered how they used to help me when I was overwhelmed with sarnarks and tigers fighting in the wilderness surrounding the outpost.  It was too bad, they were soon going to think me their enemy because I was about to defy their master.  Oh, well, they are simpletons, and I cannot waste time thinking about simpletons, even those from whom I have benefited in the past.  If they wish to hate me after my experiences, so be it; they won't be the first.<br>
<br>
I found Mezzmorizer dressed in his metallic purple roses, and Lolodory made herself evident soonafter.  &quot;Make sure you cannot be seen&quot; I told them.  &quot;There are dangerous folk on the way.&quot;  I also gave them the gift of flight, as them falling to their deaths would really slow us down.<br>
<br>
Finally we made our way to the massive fissure seeming to tear into the plains of The Overthere.  I brought out a map I had stuffed into my packs before I left my tower.  &quot;According to this map,&quot; I told my friends, &quot;the cave we are looking for is right down there.&quot;  I then jumped off the cliff into the scorpion filled pits below. <br>
<br>
&quot;Follow me and make sure you're flying, not falling.  It's quite a way down,&quot; I told them.<br>
<br>
As we reached the ground Qixx informed us &quot;This passageway here leads us to the entrance of the infamous Howling Stones.  The journey will be difficult but the rewards will be great.  Be on your guard, and be wary of the scorpion creatures around us.  If they spot you they will tear you up in a matter of seconds.&quot;<br>
<br>
We made our way in.<br>
<br>
After crawling through twists and turns around the menacing Scorpikis', I spotted a large red orb.<br>
<br>
&quot;That is the entrance,&quot; Qixx said.  &quot;If you take out your key and turn the lock, you will find yourself magically brought into the dungeon.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Let's go,&quot; I said, taking out my key.  I quickly found the lock and turned it, and indeed the world around me began to haze as I heard mumbles behind me having something to do with Lolodory.<br>
<br>
When I entered I was on a floating rectangular platform with four paths leading to stairs, at the top of each of which was a golem-guarded door.  Suddenly a skeleton noticed me and drew upon its dark energies.  The skin in my body cringed with pain.  My magical protections has blocked the hardest of it, but I could still feel the energy of pure hatred and evil within this being attempting to destroy my life force.  Then it lunged at me.<br>
<br>
&quot;Damn it where are you guys!  I am under attack!&quot; I screamed into the room, but no one seemed to here.  Have my companions left me to die?  Are they simply too stupid to figure out how to use the lock?  These thoughts went through my mind however useless they were at the time.  But I needed to do something, to immobalize or destroy the skeleton.  But alas I was not concentrating, and even though I managed to immobalize the skeleton he had gashed my chest and torn my robes, and I was bleeding badly.  As I backed away from him sharp teeth dug into my shoulder and I howled out in pain.  The skeleton broke free from my magical binds and crushed my leg.  There was no chance, I had been defeated.<br>
<br>
Darkness evenloped my world, and I regained consciousness in Sanctus Seru where I had bound my spirit.  I convinced myself that my friends would avenge my death and Restoria would bring life back into my spirit.  <br>
<br>
It turns out that my companion's hesitation was due to Lolodory's lack of a key.  The others watched as she unsuccessfully attempted to pick the lock.  But the others found their way in and Restoria renergized my body.  After some preparatory measurements, we proceeded to make our way through the dungeon.  <br>
<br>
The minions of Sathir proved no match to our forces.  We clawed our way through skeletons and golemn and weird amorophous ooze creatures until we finally found Drusella's room.<br>
<br>
When we reached Drusella's room Qixx initiated the combat (I believe I overheard &quot;Hey, bish!  I hear your loved has the hots for Beornn!&quot; - I always wondered what Qixx used to pull.  No wonder how he gets so many mobs pissed at him at once).  Immediately four golems charged our small party, along with a swirling pile of bones that from my lore I identified as the late Drusella Sathir.  Apparently she too has cheated death like her lover, though perhaps undeath isn't quite a cheat.<br>
<br>
Mezzmorizer stopped the golems in their tracks with his magical flashes of light and enchanting images.  I concentrated on destroying whatever it was that remained of Drusella.  Kritical withstood her blows well, while Restoria repaired any damage.  Qixx must have been doing something becaues I cought a glimpse of scaly arms and feet flying through the air.  I wrought forth the raw power of magic upon Drusella, and she fell to our might.  <br>
<br>
We took from Drusella what was on our corpse and I used my powers of transportation to take us back to the floating platform.  <br>
<br>
&quot;Well,&quot; I said, &quot;We have proven our self greater than an ancient pile of bones&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;You're always so negative&quot; Kritical responded.  &quot;Now take me back to the Bazaar&quot;<br>
<br>
Witherweaver sighs, clearly disappointed.<br>

<br>
In my studies i have found none of my ancient forefathers so amusing and repulsing as this Venril Sathir. For years he has grown powerful and bloated raising his foul necromancy in the heard of the Werewolf city, and living with the dead. Alone i stand no match against this awesome force, but in my travels i have aquired the..... aid... of powerful warriors and mighty weilders of magics. With these forces i would be able to strike into the heart of my beloved land, and clean what filth had grown in the iksar race's reclusion.<br>
<br>
Cloaked in peddlers clothes i traveled the lands of the humans, at each of my companions dwellings tacking a simple note to the door<br>
<br>
&quot;I am in need of help in the settling of an old score with the Mistress Drusella of Sathir. If you would accompany me, I assure you it will be nothing short of an adventure. <br>
<br>
If you would be so good as to join me, contact Baron Witherweaver Wyntari and he will provide the transportation to lessen your travel time.<br>
<br>
Regards,<br>
Qixx &quot;<br>
<br>
At Witherweavers door i tacked a simpler note...<br>
<br>
&quot;Powerful magics to be had, heed your friends calls, come, fight.<br>
-Qixx&quot;<br>
<br>
And come they did. Those that are called Witherweaver, Lolodory, Mezzmorizer, Restoria and Kritical came, powerful beings in their own right, a massive force combined.<br>
<br>
We journeyed to the lands of my ancestors, and deep in the caves overrun with scorpikis, entered the tomb of the once beautiful, sensuous, deadly, Lady Drusella, wife of my enemy.<br>
<br>
Upon entry the choke of dead flesh, and vile good assailed my keen iksar nostrils. With a silent curse to my god, for creating fear in the hearts of mortals, and bestowing me with a slight twinge of his everlasting gift to the world right then, i flung 2 shruiken at the guardians of the entryway. I have no taste for defensive action, and as the horrible skeletal creatures stepped towards me, intent on ripping my heart out, a shining figure stepped in front of me, clad in gleaming silver platemail. My warlord companion's silver blades danced in the dark room like lightning, the blows rebounding off his sturdy armour as his mate, Restoria wove beautiful protective magics around him. With a fiery blast from Witherweaver and a quick thrust from Lolodory, the foul beings were sent back to the eternal rest from which they had been unfairly summoned from.<br>
<br>
Our devious rogue Lolodory claimed she knew no way to open doors, as she had not become proficient in the use of her lockpicks, untill i mentioned the hoard of gold usually stored in the royal iksar crypts. She became unnervingly attentive, and extremely deft with her lockpicks and thenceforth opened any door she deemed might have loot behind it. Many skeletons we laid to rest, many golems turned into dust as i clawed and kicked my way to the royal chambers.<br>
<br>
Finally we came upon it. The ladys door. The woman that loved me and i her, in times long past, that had ventured into the desperate passion of venril, the wife of the man who banished me from her thoughts and her from mine with foul necromancy. In the heat of the moment i remember not what i said, but i am sure it was something to the effect of &quot;Drusella, you are my bish whether you like it or not&quot;, knowing full well how much the female breed of iksar likes to be called &quot;bish&quot;. Roaring out of her room like hell unleashed she came, tearing the walls of her beautiful crypt apart with her fury. (hell hath no fury like a dead woman reborn) <br>
<br>
With her came 4 monstrous golems, foul beings of magic with arms as thick as my sleek chest. Their claws tore the stones of the ground and ripped columns from their moorings as they strove to smother the spark of life that lived in me. I flung myself against the wall, and lay still on the ground. The mindless beings were unsure how they had bested me so easily and stood there for a moment. That was all the time we needed. My companion Mezzmorizer cast a mighty enchantment, and the 4 golems froze, drool slipping down the side of their chins, caught in dreams of their previous life, and their creator, unable to return to the reality in which they lay.<br>
<br>
Drusella however was not so easily fooled. She screamed out &quot;Useless druid-spawned-gnomeloving-creatures&quot; and rushed for kritical, rending his armour and tearing chunks from his flesh. Restoria was healing his wounds and keeping her at bay as best as she could, but Drusella was really really pisssed. I stood up and attacked with Lolodory from behind, ripping bones from her scrawny (yet not altogether un-attractive) carcass. Yet we were fighting a losing battle, Mezzmorizer was keeping her magically held in place, but she was too powerful, and the sources that sustained their magic were weakening. Then from behind me, an intense blast drove the foul witch back. Then another blast, this time greater than before, reeking of sufurous flame burst upon her, charring her bones into oblivion. A shout rang up upon the companions, the woman defeated. I rummaged through her belongings quickly and found the item which i desired. The urn which carried her memories of me, and mine of her, forced from our bodies and imprisoned in the urn by the evil Venril, which had tormented my dreams for years. I grabbed it and hugged it close to my chest as i beat a hasty retreat to my companions. Witherweaver nodded so slightly behind me and as i turned around my face froze with horror. The 4 monstrosities dreamlike expressions had vanished, and they were now severely angry with us. &quot;oh sh!t&quot; i exclaimed as i ran back to the group yelling &quot; ggogogogogogo&quot; Witherweaver began casting the magical portal that would take us out when i noticed Lolodory, digging through the gems that littered the floor. She would not notice the portal in time, and would be stuck to fend for herself. I grabbed her around the waist and flung her over my shoulder as i nimbly bounced into the ring of magics starting to coalesce around Witherweaver. As i set Lolodory down she kicked me hard, in the shins. Looking across the room while curled on the floor i noticed that in my haste to recover my friend, i had dropped the one item that would free me from my nightmares, the one testament of my true love for Drusella, and the one item that would allow me to spend eternity with her when i finally departed. As the magics closed around me, i sprang out, an agonising call of failure and loss tearing from my lips, reaching out my hands for this, my history, my only hope at love, and my memories of my beloved. the tips of my fingers brushed one last time against the cool blue porcelain, a faint glimpe of her in my arms, and then the 6 companions, me included, vanished into thin air. Appearing moments later hundreds of miles away. I concluded our mission, and silently walked away. I spent 100 days in meditation contemplating that which had forced my desires away from the center of my attention, that had cost me everlasting happiness, that which i would never rank high on my priorities again: Friendship.<br>
