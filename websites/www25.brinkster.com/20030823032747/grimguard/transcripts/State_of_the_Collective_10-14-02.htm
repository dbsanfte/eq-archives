</B></U><P ALIGN="CENTER">Hail and good evening to you all. As promised, I am giving a brief statement as to the status of our Guild as of this day and time.</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER"></P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">Our current membership is as follows:</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER"></P>

<UL>
<LI>51 total REGISTERED characters</LI>
<UL>
<LI>30 Primary characters
<UL>
<LI>13 Primary Officers</LI>
</UL>
<LI>21 Alternates</LI>
<UL>
<LI>5 Alt Officers</LI>
</UL>

<LI>Of the REGISTERED characters they can be broken down thus:</LI>

<UL>
<LI>1 bard</LI>
<LI>2 beastlord</LI>
<LI>6 cleric</LI>
<LI>7 druid</LI>
<LI>2 enchanter</LI>
<LI>2 magician</LI>
<LI>7 monk</LI>
<LI>6 necromancer</LI>
<LI>1 paladin</LI>
<LI>2 ranger</LI>
<LI>1 rogue</LI>
<LI>4 shadowknight</LI>
<LI>2 shaman</LI>
<LI>5 warrior</LI>
<LI>3 wizard</LI></UL>
</UL>
<LI>While we like to stress that RL should take precedence over EQ, we have a few members that have been ‘MIA’ for a few weeks. If anyone has any information on anyone that is listed as a member on the roster, but may no longer be Guilded with us, please let an officer know, so that we may attempt to keep our roster current.</LI>
<LI>Guild Bank &amp; Library Status:</LI>

<UL>
<LI>353pp 5gp 4sp 4cp Cash-on-Hand</LI>
<LI>Bank Inventory: There are 81 Bank Slots filled with various Items. Won’t list them all here, but will give a brief over-view. To see the completed listing, visit the roster and click on the [Bank] link.</LI>

<UL>
<LI>25 Armor items</LI>
<LI>15 Jewelry items</LI>
<LI>16 Weapon items</LI>
<LI>1 stack of Sharpening Stones</LI>
<LI>9 MQ cat pelts and 6 HQ cat pelts</LI>
<LI>20 slots are misc. items</LI></UL>

<LI>Library Items: There is a large assortment of Research Items currently in the Library. We need to identify which are common and which are not. We could eliminate the need to maintain an inventory of the commonly dropped items, and only hold onto those that are more rare, or only drop in more dangerous areas.</LI>

<UL>
<LI>If we could also have volunteers to donate a bit of time to research some of these items into usable spells, which may prove to be more lucrative as well.</LI>
<LI>2 books</LI>
<LI>4 spells</LI>
<LI>11 Part of Tasarin’s Grimoire (various)</LI>
<LI>15 Runes (various)</LI>
<LI>9 Salil’s Writ (including 1 Faded)</LI>
<LI>4 Velishom’s Tome (including 1 Faded)</LI>
<LI>35 Words (several multiples)</LI></UL>
</UL>
<LI>There have been a few policy changes of late concerning planned events and communication and I would like to highlight some of them for you here:</LI>
<UL>
<LI>All PLANNED Guild-related events will be posted to the Msgboard, and a sign-up link will be provided. To access a list of currently PLANNED Events, simply click on the &quot;EVENTS&quot; button found on the Guild website.</LI>
<LI>If an event is PLANNED, and you do not sign up, you will not be allowed to attend. If you can get to us, you can ‘hang out’ but unless there is an opening in a group, you will be unable to join in.</LI>
<LI>There will always be ample time to sign up for an event. Most events will be announced on the Msgboard, and in the News Brief (on the main Guild Webpage) at least a week in advance.</LI>
<LI>It is recommended that you visit the Guild Website regularly. If you don’t, you won’t know when an event is coming up.</LI>
<LI>There is a new Website address (collective.dynu.net). You can continue to visit the old link (www25.brinkster.com/grimguard) but I’m not sure how long I will continue to update that page. When I finally decide to stop updating that page, I will put an announcement on the site.</LI>
<LI>Along with the new roster, there is a new gallery feature as well. You no longer have to send screenshots to me to see them displayed, nor will you have to put up with my stupid comments, as you can upload them yourself, and add your own stupid comments!</LI>

<UL>
<LI>Only able to accept .jpg and .gif files (to keep the sizes down)</LI>
<LI>Keep the size under 500k or it won’t upload and please, if the sceenshot isn’t very easy to see, clean it up first. (use a graphic editor with gamma features like Paintshop Pro or you can try Vicman Pro. It is a nice, simple editor, fully functioning, but with annoying nags and a size limit on the images.)</LI></UL>
</UL>
</UL>
<P ALIGN="CENTER"></P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">We hope to plan more events and raids, but we are still experiencing a lack of ideas/participation. It seems the same people are suggesting all the events, and quite frankly, they feel a little selfish to be constantly suggesting things to do that will benefit themselves. It is very difficult to find mid-level events where more than one class will benefit. So, if you are interested in getting an item, or getting a part of a quest, and you need backup, then post it on the msgboard for all to see and then we can plan an event around it.</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER"></P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">In closing, I would like to say that we have seen some amazing growth in the last few months. I want to keep up the momentum, and to start doing more regular events. More events will mean more loot and more opportunity for growth, both personally, and as a Guild. People see our Guild tag everywhere now, and they associate good things with our members. Let’s keep it up.</P>

<P ALIGN="CENTER">I would like to get some feedback on the 1<SUP>st</SUP> Collective of Dark Honour <U>State of the Collective</U> Speech. If there is something that I left out, then let me know, and I will do my best to get that information to you, and if you think that I have given too much info, let me know that too.
