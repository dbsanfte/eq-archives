         <FONT SIZE="+1" FACE="GoudyMedieval" COLOR="#8E913C">The
         seeds of the Court of Ruins were planted many eons ago in
         the souls of three highborn in a Nameless corner of Norrath.
         These seeds found fertile ground but were unable to blossom
         and mature. When the time came that these three left the
         world, the seeds remained with their souls. </FONT></P>
         
         <P><FONT SIZE="+1" FACE="GoudyMedieval" COLOR="#8E913C">The
         souls and their kernels lay dormant until the universe
         declared they should be reborn. Some odd twist of fate
         determined that these souls be reborn as practitioners of
         the dark arts and in the forms of the dark races in an
         alternate Norrath known to its inhabitants as Luclin. Though
         they were placed far apart, these three were drawn together
         and the seeds were once again stimulated to
         growth.</FONT></P>
         
         <P><FONT SIZE="+1" FACE="GoudyMedieval" COLOR="#8E913C">The
         Court of Ruins was founded on the ideal that those of the
         dark races, practitioners of the dark arts, those following
         the dark gods and those following their own path should
         bring ruin to the existing establishment of Norrath. They
         would restore order to the world as they felt it should be.
         After all, the Dark Elves were once the ruling class in the
         world and should be again.</FONT></P>
         
         <P><FONT SIZE="+1" FACE="GoudyMedieval" COLOR="#8E913C">Guildhalls
         were commissioned in Neriak and the Court began to gather
         its forces. Dark Elves and Ogres came together with
         Necromancers and Shadow Knights of the "lesser" races. Plans
         were made and set in motion. The Court encountered many
         stumbling blocks along the way. Each was addressed and
         conquered until the strength of the Court was sufficient to
         being spreading to the world outside of Nektulos and
         Innothule. </FONT></P>
         
         <P><FONT SIZE="+1" FACE="GoudyMedieval" COLOR="#8E913C">The
         Council met to discuss the issues at hand. Much heated
         discussion occurred in those nights. Some were of the
         opinion that the Court would thrive and conquer as it was.
         No outside help was needed. The Court would stand on it's
         own and reclaim the world! Others expressed the need to take
         slaves from other corners of Norrath. After all, every
         empire needed slaves. Still others claimed the need for
         agents in other cities- spies to report the activities of
         the Court's enemies and lay the groundwork for the Court's
         invasions. A minority preached tolerance. If the Court was
         to rule, it must rule all fairly and justly or it too would
         be overthrown. These last voices were drowned out quite
         quickly.</FONT></P>
         
         <P><FONT SIZE="+1" FACE="GoudyMedieval" COLOR="#8E913C">Finally
         it was decided a few slaves would be taken to serve the Dark
         Masters. Gnomes and Humans found their way into the halls of
         the Court. The experiment seemed to work well enough. The
         Council met again and determined that some races such as
         dwarves and halflings, and certain classes such as the
         holier than thou paladins, simply could not be bent to the
         will of the Court and therefore had to be
         destroyed.</FONT></P>
         
         <P><FONT SIZE="+1" FACE="GoudyMedieval" COLOR="#8E913C">The
         Council met once more. With much discussion, it was finally
         decreed that those willing to commit to the ways of the
         Court and its ideals would be admitted but only after a test
         of their devotion. Followers of the fickle gods must be
         willing to become hated in their own temples. They must
         become outlaws in the cities of their birth. Only then would
         they be welcomed to the Court as equals. Amazingly, or
         perhaps not so, there were those willing to do just this.
         All the while, the ideal of tolerance was growing among the
         members of the Court.</FONT></P>
         
         <P><FONT SIZE="+1" FACE="GoudyMedieval" COLOR="#8E913C">The
         Council again met to take a look at the progress and goals
         of the Court. The general population had grown and changed,
         as had the structure and make up of the Council. Much had
         been accomplished since the Court's birth and many trials
         had been weathered. Of its peers, the Court was one of the
         few still standing. Over time, the Court's slaves had become
         spies. These spies were planted in many cities across the
         face of Norrath and had accomplished brilliant work in the
         furthering of the Court's goals. There were still hurtles
         that simply could not be overcome, no matter how they were
         approached. These puzzles could not be solved with the
         fear-induced work of slaves, or with the sometimes-grudging
         cooperation of spies. Something else had to be
         done.</FONT></P>
         
         <P><FONT SIZE="+1" FACE="GoudyMedieval" COLOR="#8E913C">A
         long forgotten idea and a revision of the Court's goals were
         presented- tolerance. Let us build a new world on the ruins
         of the old; not create ruins in the wake of our advance. If
         the Court was to restore the glory of Norrath, as it was
         before the great wars, acceptance and not dominance must be
         the rule of the day. There were places the Court simply
         could not go and goals it could not accomplish. This idea
         was met with grumbling from some of the older Councilors.
         </FONT></P>
         
         <P><FONT SIZE="+1" FACE="GoudyMedieval" COLOR="#8E913C">"Why
         should we be tolerant? Why change the status quo
         now?"</FONT></P>
         
         <P><FONT SIZE="+1" FACE="GoudyMedieval" COLOR="#8E913C">"Look
         at those guilds, founded at the time we were, who have
         devoted themselves purely to the dark ways. They are small
         and ineffective, if they are still in existence. They change
         little in the grand scheme and often find themselves drunk
         in their own halls or continuously drifting from one guild
         to another. They will never be face to face with their gods.
         The mighty dragons will never cower in fear of them. These
         guilds are not legends but footnotes in history. Those of
         our number who have become outlaws in their birthplace
         cannot advance in skill or understanding beyond what they
         had when they joined us. They have no one to teach them, no
         arena to train in. This is decidedly not the path to
         greatness!"</FONT></P>
         
         <P><FONT SIZE="+1" FACE="GoudyMedieval" COLOR="#8E913C">Those
         opposed to the idea of tolerance did acknowledge that there
         was a certain amount of wisdom in this argument. They
         expressed their continued belief that the Court should hold
         to its original intentions, though they did vote to ratify a
         new charter, one of mutual respect and cooperation. The
         Court would still seek to rule but rather than rule by
         destruction and domination, they would rule by production
         and cooperation. </FONT></P>
