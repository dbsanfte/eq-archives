	<LI><B>Guild Meeting Tonight!</B> <U>'State of the Collective'</U> Speech to be held tonight. I ask that all talking in Guild be suspended beginning at 9:00pm through the completion of the 'meeting'. When it is completed, we will be returning Guild-speak to normal chatting, and myself and the other Officers will answer any questions you have regarding the speech. See a pre-view of the speech here: <a href="transcripts/State_of_the_Collective_10-14-02.htm">State of the Collective 10-14-02</a>
	<LI><B>Hate Raid Info:</B> Tomorrow is the deadline for reaching the required level. If you haven't reached 46 by midnight Wednesday morning, you will not be allowed to participate, as much for your own health as ours. Also, we only have 10 members signed up. We will need more than that if we intend on doing anything. Go to the Events page and sign up!

	<LI><B>Guild Meeting Announced!</B> Mark your calendars: Monday, October 14,2002 at 9:00pm Eastern, there will be a Guild Meeting to be held in Guild Chat, in which i give my first ever "State of the Collective" speech. Afterwards there will be an opportunity for everyone to voice an opinion and ask questions of the Guild Leader and the other Officers.
	<LI><B>Hate Fast Approaching!</B> If you are close to the minimum level for attendance (46) and are interested in attending, get together with some of our higher Guilies and get those last few XP points. If you arent ready by Oct 15, 2002, you will be unable to attend!
	<LI><B>Event Sign-up Enabled!</B> If you are interested in attending the Hate Raid, or any other future Raid, Click on the EVENTS button to the left and sign up! <B>IF YOU DO NOT SIGN UP FOR AN EVENT, THERE WILL NOT BE A SPOT LEFT OPEN FOR YOU!</B> We sometimes plan the events days, or weeks, (in the case of Hate a month) in advance. If we don't know you are coming, then we cannot plan for your safety or placement. We will not take the extra time to re-arrange the groups 10 minutes before we start because you "just found out." Watch the MsgBoard, the /GUILDMOTD, and here for events and sign up at the EVENTS whenever you are interested in attending.

	<LI><B>EVENT RESULTS:</B> We were successful in protecting one of the 2 Scouts we activated last night in Grimling Forest. Tuvin recieved one of the Medals of War as a reward. Congrats to you Tuvin! After that, well, lets just say that the night went downhill. Sorry, Aga.
	<LI><B>ROSTER NEWS:</B> The new Roster is completed. I think I got everyone, and your information is as accurate as your Guild Magic profile was. Which is to say, if it wasn't right before, it isn't right now.
		<UL>
		<LI>To access the new Roster, click on the Roster Button, like you always did.
		<LI>I will be e-mailing a notification to everyone to let you know how to log in to update your information.	
		<LI>As of right now, there is no way to change your Diety, if I messed it up, other than to create the character anew. I am working on making that field editable, but it wasn't real high on my priority list.
		</UL>
	<LI><B>NEW GALLERY ADDED:</B> There is now a way for you to submit your own screenshots without e-mailing them to me first. To do this, you need to know the Guild Password (same as the one for the Roster) which is posted on the Message Board.
	<LI><B>EVENTS LISTING ADDED:</B> There is also an EVENTS section of the Roster/Gallery/Bank Inventory tool. This will be replacing the Events Calendar, and will be accessible through links on both the Roster pages and the Events Button on the Navigation Bars to the Left.
	<LI><B>NEWS ARCHIVES ADDED:</B> I have also added a News Archive Section, in case you want to see what we talked about in previous Briefs. I will be moving our News Briefs into the Archive at the beginning of every new month.
