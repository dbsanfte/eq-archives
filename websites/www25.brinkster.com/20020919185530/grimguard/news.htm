	<LI>Added Officer's Club section to the MSGBoard. Access is granted only to Officers. (oddly enough =)) If you are not signed in under a username with Guild Officer rights, you will not be able to see that particular section at all. Officers, please be sure to visit this area of the MSGBoard on a regular basis. It may just save your life... =)

	<LI>I would like to apologize and to offer a belated birthday to our Guild! We first recieved our approval from Verant on Sun, 2 Sep 2001. Of course, as it was Labor Day weekend here in the U.S., it took almost 3 days for our guild to be formed. But anyway, <B>HAPPY FIRST BIRTHDAY to the Collective of Dark Honour!</B>

	<LI>Patriot's Day: Our hearts and minds go out to those families of the victims of 9-11-2001. Alot has happened in the last year, but those events will forever be burned into our memories.

	<LI>Added Pictures of the Epic Weapon Stats to the (as-of-yet uncompleted) Epic Checklist pages. To see what the stats for your epic will be, click on Class Menu, then scroll down till you find your class, then click on the Scroll labled Epic Quest on your class page.
		<UL>
		<LI>Anyone who has compiled, or found, an Epic Checklist is asked to send them to me, as I don't always have the time to create or find existing Checklists.
