         </FONT><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#9999FF">Even though he
         enjoyed working at the bank, he just wished he could get out
         a bit more, or at all in fact, yet ever since he completed
         his training as a wizard he had been assigned here, as a
         bookkeeper. Ok, the work was steady and safe, pay was a
         little low, but he managed. The door to his office (it
         wasn't really an office, rather it was more like a large
         coffin, a necromancers dream to study dark arts in, with
         nice stone walls) open. He looked aghast completely unsure
         what he should do next, for there, in front of him (or
         rather in front of his table) stood a gnome. Must be
         someone's slave was his first thought, nicely dressed was
         his second. There was not time for a
         third.</FONT><FONT FACE="Arial"><BR>

         <P><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#9999FF">"You are the one
         called Quartermaster?" speaking the common tongue, the
         little gnome used a voice much deeper than he would have
         thought possible. </FONT></P>
         
         <P><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#9999FF">Quartermaster scowled
         at it.</FONT></P>

         slave and be quick about it, before I call the guards and
         have you whipped"; Quartermaster had had few dealing with
         the other races that inhabited Norrath, but he had learned
         early on how to handle enslaved ones.</FONT><FONT FACE="Arial"><BR>

         guys from the bad has been a problem throughout history,
         this was no exception. With a swift wave of his hand and a
         swirl of green lights, the little gnome rose above the table
         and stood eye-to-eye with him. </FONT><FONT FACE="Arial"><BR>

         <P><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#9999FF">" I will take my own
         time good sir" the gnome said pleasantly in the speech of
         the Tier Dal, "for time is something that I have much of and
         you may not." </FONT></P>
         
         <P><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#9999FF">The smile that went
         with that froze Quartermasters heart. " But you are young

         me. Your superiors seem to think that you are a capable elf
         who will soon be going places. Allow me to introduce myself,

         turned upside down. Tyre Dreadslayer, the only gnome in the
         Court of Ruins, a wizard of fame and fortune. At first he
         thought that his life was over, but now, now this mighty
         wizard wanted him to join the Court (as it is affectionately
         known around Neriak)! People to go out adventuring with!
         Sites to see! And the knowledge, he could nnot find a better
         instructor! This could not be passed up, opportunity does
         not come along twice, not like this.</FONT><FONT FACE="Arial"><BR>

         great one, anything I can do, anything at all and I will
         give it all that I can." Quartermaster could not keep the
         excitement out of his voice.</FONT><FONT FACE="Arial"><BR>

         <P><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#9999FF">"I expect no less of
         you, nor will we take less, but we will take more"; Tyre
         smiled, a lazily smile, one that said ' you have been
         warned'. "Come now apprentice, let us be off, for your boss
         has already released you". </FONT><FONT FACE="Arial"><BR>

         too much. Quartermaster followed the still floating Tyre
         Dreadslayer out of the bank, saying his goodby's to everyone
