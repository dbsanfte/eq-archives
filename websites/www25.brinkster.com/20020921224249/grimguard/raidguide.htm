<P><FONT face=Arial color=#ffffff>One goal of this guild is to 
get our members to higher levels to go places that only large, organized groups 
are able to go. To this end, another goal is to prepare our guild members for 
such raids with lower level "training" raids. We will be having various raids planned for everyone in the guild to participate in, as well as other 
group/party events, such as:</FONT></P>
<UL type=disc>
  <LI><FONT face=Arial color=#ffffff size=2>Faction Raids (where party members 
  can raise desired factions for quests or removing KOS status)</FONT> 
  <LI><FONT face=Arial color=#ffffff size=2>Dueling Tournaments (with the goal 
  of learning the strengths and weaknesses of other classes)</FONT> 
  <LI><FONT face=Arial color=#ffffff size=2>PvP Practice Raids (taking groups 
  into the Arena against higher level members to learn raid tactics)</FONT> 
  <LI><FONT face=Arial color=#ffffff size=2>Training Events (where trade skills 
  training and language teaching, amongst other things, will occur)</FONT> 
  <LI><FONT face=Arial color=#ffffff size=2>And much, much more...</FONT> 
</LI></UL>
<P><FONT face=Arial color=#ffffff>But here I want to discuss with my fellow 
Guildies some basic guidelines and suggestions for Party Raids. A Party Raid is 
usually a combination of two or more groups with one common goal - to kill as 
much as they can and get as much loot as possible. With this in mind, there are 
many things to consider and remember when participating in such an 
event.</FONT></P>
<P align=center><FONT face=Arial><IMG height=11 
src="backstories/blackbar.gif" width=591></FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial color=#ff0000 size=3><STRONG>1. Do not be afraid to 
die.<BR></STRONG></FONT><FONT face=Arial color=#c0c0c0 size=2>This is a very 
important rule, believe it or not. Raids are not typically designed for gaining 
experience, but rather for the fun, the exploration, and the loot. An 
unfortunate "side effect" of raiding is character deaths, sometimes more than 
once. It' s a fact of raiding that is unavoidable, but with practice and 
coordination, can be kept to a minimum. So do not get mad or frustrated if you 
die, because it will happen to everyone at least once. But most importantly - DO 
NOT PANIC.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial color=#ff0000 size=3><STRONG>2. Try not to focus on your own 
hit points.<BR></STRONG></FONT><FONT face=Arial color=#c0c0c0 size=2>This 
basically follows #1. Not only is it a distraction from whatever your task may 
be, but it can also prove deadly to everyone. If you are running low on health, 
it is very easy to panic, run off, or shout frantically for help. This however 
will only serve to create more confusion and distraction, and could end killing 
many more people, with the potential to wipe out the entire raiding party. 
Therefore, DO NOT run or panic. If you're hitpoints are getting low, don't start 
yelling for a heal - it is your group healer's responsibility to heal you and 
they are watching all hitpoints. If you do end up dying, wait until you are sent 
a tell from the Raid Cleric(s) - do not send /tells yourself as this can create 
more confusion and distraction if the group is still fighting. We will have a 
rez-capable cleric at every guild raid so that we can get our members back into 
action as soon as possible, as well as to minimize the experience loss from 
death. This is important because every member of a party raid will have an 
assigned task, whether it is healing, buffing, nuking, snaring, melee, etc. We 
need to recover as soon as we can from mishaps to maintain our efficiency and 
effectiveness. Remember that no matter how small you may think your role is, it 
isn't. Everyone in a raid party is equally important to the overall 
success.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial color=#ff0000 size=3><STRONG>3. Main healers should focus 
only on their group's hit point bars.</STRONG><BR></FONT><FONT face=Arial 
color=#c0c0c0 size=2>As I said before, we want more than anything else to 
maintain our focus and think clearly and quickly. The primary healers should not 
be concerned with the combat around them, but rather the status of the hit point 
bars of their group mates (every group will have an assigned primary healer). 
Should the primary healer come under attack, they should announce so in group 
say (/gsay). Melees and pets should attempt to taunt the attacker off of the 
healer, even if it means abandoning their current target (unless that target is 
on the run and near death). I cannot stress enough the importance of keeping 
your group's primary healer alive. I have seen many good groups overcome seeming 
insurmountable odds because they were able to keep their healers alive, and I 
have seen many strong groups die to inferior enemies because their healer was 
eliminated. To minimize distraction, the main healers are the only ones that 
should be asking for assistance in /gsay if under attack. <EM>(In the planes, it 
is of the utmost importance that clerics survive. It costs 250pp to port one 
group into the planes, and if things go bad, clerics are told to camp out so 
that they can rez people back into the zone and thereby minimize the expense of 
ports, as well as the pain in returning to the camp point.)</EM></FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial color=#ff0000 size=3><STRONG>4. Listen to your Raid Director 
and Group Leaders.</STRONG><BR></FONT><FONT face=Arial color=#c0c0c0 size=2>The 
Raid Director will generally have had a lot of experience in large groups and 
raid events, or at the least should know the zone quite well, so you should feel 
much safer under their direction. They will use /shout for directions, 
instructions, or combat commands (i.e., if there is a certain target all groups 
should focus on due to strength, abilities, etc.). Group Leaders are to use only 
/ooc. Excess communication is unnecessary and to be avoided so nothing is 
missed. No other raider should use /shout or /ooc. If you are lost or in need of 
something, tell your group, and the Group Leader will use /ooc if necessary. If 
for any reason a raider <EM>has</EM> to go /afk in RL, tell your group. The raid 
doesn't necessarily have to be halted unless you are the primary healer, mezzer, 
or assist. If the group leader feels that his party cannot function properly, 
announce the /afk in /ooc so that the Raid Director can act 
accordingly.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial color=#ff0000 size=3><STRONG>5. Turn off all chat modes 
except /shout, /ooc and /gsay.</STRONG><BR></FONT><FONT face=Arial color=#c0c0c0 
size=2>I can again not stress enough the importance of maintaining focus and 
minimizing distraction. The Raid Director and Group Leaders will use /shout and 
/ooc to communicate to everyone as necessary. During the raid it is recommended 
that everyone minimize non-related chat so that they don't miss something, such 
as a sudden drop in a group member's hit points, or an urgent command issued by 
a director or group leader. I also recommend using /afk with a message 
describing your status, such as <EM>"/afk Participating in a raid right now, 
please try and reach me later, thanks"</EM>. This is generally sufficient for 
most people to understand that you are preoccupied and unavailable for 
discussion. But also understand, there will be some down periods when there is 
nothing wrong with joking around or recovering your wits from the previous 
close-encounter with death. Just be ready to get serious quickly if the action 
picks up again, or if the Directors instruct the party to move ahead, or brief 
everyone on what is going to occur next. Also make sure you turn off "combat 
spam", such as "Other Hits", "Other Misses", etc. If you don't know how to do 
this, ask a group mate for assistance. Battle spam can also be very distracting 
and combined with lag, could cause you to miss an important order or directive. 
There will be no reason to participate in /guild chat while on a raid, as this 
also detracts from focus and adds too much extra text flashing by.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial color=#ff0000 size=3><STRONG>6. Make an /assist macro if you 
haven't already.</STRONG><BR></FONT><FONT face=Arial color=#c0c0c0 size=2>This 
little macro will prove to be extremely useful, whether in groups or in raids, 
particularly for melees. All you need to do is take a blank social box, name it 
"Assist", and on the first line type "/assist name". "Name" will be replaced by 
whoever the main assist of the raid is. Whenever a mob(s) is pulled, click on 
this Assist macro so that you know what they are currently fighting. The Main 
Assist should also have an incoming message in /shout to announce what his 
current target is, or if he changes targets, for example "/shout I am attacking 
%T". Use your Assist macro at all times before casting or attacking - it really 
sucks to attack, nuke or DoT an NPC that has taken no damage yet, because you 
thought it was the one the tanks were attacking, and then find yourself being 
jumped by a really ticked off mob and have no assistance. The /assist macro is 
mandatory for all raiders. And remember to click on it regularly, just in case 
your "main assist" (the assigned main attacker of the group) had to change 
targets for whatever reason, such as to pull a mob off the group's 
healer.</FONT></P>

  <TR>
    <TD width="100%"><FONT face=Arial color=#c0c0c0 size=1><EM>Note: In case 
      you don't know, the "%T" is automatically replaced by whatever you have in 
      your target window at the time you say it. Try this - target an NPC or PC, 
      hit enter to bring up your chat bar, type "Hello %T", and then hit enter 
      again. %T will be replaced by whatever was in your target window at the 
      time. For example, if you targeted Grimguard and typed "Hello %T", your 
      chat screen would show "You say, 'Hello Grimguard'". If you didn't have 
      anything targeted at the time, it would instead show "You say, 'Hello 
      Target'".</EM></FONT></TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></CENTER></DIV>
<P><FONT face=Arial color=#ff0000 size=3><STRONG>7. Stick together, as a group 
foremost, but also as a party.</STRONG><BR></FONT><FONT face=Arial color=#c0c0c0 
size=2>We want to keep everyone from dying if we can, and one way most people 
get killed is they wander off by themselves or get lost. The group leader of 
each group is responsible for making sure that everyone in his/her group is 
following. Do not just bolt off because you know where the party is going, and 
then discover so-and-so isn't there. When the party moves, keep a head count, so 
to speak, and regularly check to see that everyone in your group is with you. 
Raid parties should always move in small steps, not giant leaps and bounds. New 
and unfamiliar people easily get left behind this way, whether it's due to lag, 
or making a wrong turn, going back to find everyone gone. One way to do this is 
to use the 5-second run-and-stop method. You should never move constantly for 
more than 5 straight seconds without stopping briefly to allow everyone to catch 
up. Real life always intervenes, so if a group leader notices someone is still 
sitting where the group just left, he should announce it in /shout so that the 
Directors know to halt their progress until the person returns and catches up. 
In such an instance it is recommended the entire party back up to where they 
were in the event a wandering mob happens into the area and attacks the lone 
individual. At risk of sounding serious, keep in mind that a raid is not a 
sightseeing tour. If you stop to smell the roses, you may find yourself lost and 
alone, and shortly thereafter dead. Again, maintain your focus and stay with the 
party. So as you can see, it is very important to <STRONG>always</STRONG> stick 
together. Also, if you must go /afk, announce it to your group, don't just 
disappear, for when you return you may find yourself in an undesirable 
situation.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial color=#ff0000 size=3><STRONG>8. If at all possible, print a 
map of the Raid Plan of Attack and get familiar with 
it.<BR></STRONG></FONT><FONT face=Arial color=#c0c0c0 size=2>This will help to 
avoid getting lost and/or stranded, as well as helps the overall raid occur more 
smoothly. If everyone has a general idea of the layout, even if they have never 
been there before, they have a better chance of not getting lost. Every guild 
raid will have a Raid Plan of Attack posted on the website. It will usually be 
using a map offered by EQ Atlas (www.eqatlas.com) with alterations made 
according to where the raiding party will be going and what it will be 
attacking, as well as the path(s) it will take. Having this available beforehand 
will hopefully help to prevent losing anyone as well as to allow you to see what 
types of things the party will be encountering and what to expect. Every PoA 
will also have a description of mobs, loot, expected problems or Code Reds (mobs 
that should receive the focus of <STRONG>all</STRONG> groups should it be 
encountered), as well as bind points and a travel guide to get to the raid 
location.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial color=#ff0000 size=3><STRONG>9. Know your task and avoid 
deviating from it.</STRONG><BR></FONT><FONT face=Arial color=#c0c0c0 size=2>If 
you are the main healer, you should only be healing. If you are the nuker, you 
should only be nuking. If you are a melee/backup healer (i.e, Paladin), you 
should be meleeing most of the time and only healing if the primary healer is 
low on mana. I've seen many times in groups where a cleric or druid starts to 
melee because he/she is out of mana. A lot of times, someone ends up dying. 
Instead, that cleric should be medding for more heals, in case they are needed. 
Also, healers wasting mana on nukes is downright stupid - no matter how much 
mana you may think you have, something almost always comes up and proved you 
didn't have enough to waste. Always stick to your task unless a Director issues 
an overriding order, which generally won't occur unless it is an emergency. All 
tasks will be assigned previous to the raid depending on the number and class of 
people that sign up, but changes may need to be made for no-shows.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial color=#c0c0c0 size=2>Please keep in mind that you should 
show up if you sign up if at all possible, because the raid will be planned with 
everyone that signs up for it. As I mentioned before, everyone is important to 
the success of the raid, and no-shows could seriously hamper or even altogether 
cancel a raid. Also, try your best to be online at least 1 hour before the 
scheduled raid time, to allow time for everyone to get transportation to the 
raid site if necessary, as well as to be debriefed on any changes or 
plans.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial color=#ff0000 size=3><STRONG>10. All raids will have 
assigned looters.<BR></STRONG></FONT><FONT face=Arial color=#c0c0c0 
size=2>Generally speaking, Group Leaders are the only ones allowed to loot. In 
higher level dungeons it is easy to see who is supposed to loot, as the group 
that gets the experience is the only ones that can at that moment. Do not loot 
if you are not a Group Leader or an assigned looter. All coin loot and proceeds 
from "junk" loot will go to the Guild Bank, so Group Leaders are recommended to 
either have no cash on them when they go to the raid, or at least note how much 
they had when they got there so they know how much the raid party earned. If the 
Group Leader is a monk, they should assign someone else in the party to loot to 
avoid encumbrance. </FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial color=#c0c0c0 size=2>All items of worth will be awarded 
after the raid concludes, or when an acceptable break in the action occurs. One 
exception to this is whenever NO DROP loot is encountered. If a Group Leader 
finds NO DROP loot on a corpse, announce it in /ooc. The Raid Director will 
permit all those who <EM>can and will</EM> use it to roll for it. We will use 
the "/random 1 200" command when rolling for loot drops (please do not use 
"/random 200" as this rolls between 0 and 200, not 1 and 200; we prefer that 
everyone uses the exact same rolling technique). Our guild raids award loot 
based on who can use the item - i.e., if something drops that is only useable by 
warriors, only the warriors will be permitted to roll for it. If something drops 
that is not useable by any class present (i.e., there are no warriors), then 
everyone in the party will be allowed to roll for the item. Certain special loot 
rules may be designed for certain raid sites; check the PoA for 
details.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial color=#c0c0c0 size=2>Also, we understand that some raid 
locations have drops geared more towards a certain class than others (such as 
monks in Dalnir), but do not let this discourage non-monks from attending. You 
will want those same monks to help you get your stuff from another location 
later on that you could not possibly get on your own or with your own class. The 
Collective of Dark Honour is about helping one another, and we hope to accomplish that in our 
raids.</FONT></P>
