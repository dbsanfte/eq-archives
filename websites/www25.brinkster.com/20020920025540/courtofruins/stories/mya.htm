         <P>She had just finished her training with <A HREF="mya/hekzin.htm" TARGET="_blank">Master
         Hekzn</A>. As usual, <A HREF="mya/mya.htm" TARGET="_blank">Myanaa</A>
         was anxious to try out her newly learned skills, and she was
         quite thirsty. Fortunately, she knew just the place to solve
         both dilemmas, <A HREF="mya/maiden.htm" TARGET="_blank">The
         Maiden's Fancy</A>.<BR>
         <BR>
         She was never surprised to note that she was the only female
         patron, this was a dance hall after all; and then there was
         <A HREF="mya/ratraz.htm" TARGET="_blank">Ratraz</A>. For
         some reason, most of the women in Neriak didn't like to be
         in the same room with him. That had never been a problem for
         Mya.<BR>
         <BR>
         She exchanged a silent greeting with <A HREF="mya/molon.htm" TARGET="_blank">Molon</A>
         and then glanced around the room, noting several new faces.
         They looked young, younger even than she. They must have
         been this year's new recruits. Time to start the dice games
         again.<BR>
         <BR>
         <A HREF="mya/cecile.htm" TARGET="_blank">Cecile</A>
         suggested the fish wine, as she did every time Mya was here
         and Mya turned it down, ordering the brandy instead. She'd
         heard that there was a bet going between Master Hekzn and
         the K'jartans on just when Mya would get tired of saying "no
         thanks." Mya wanted to make sure Master Hekzn won.<BR>
         <BR>
         Settling quietly into her favorite shadowy corner, she
         sipped her brandy and watched the patrons. There was the
         group of mages, who for reasons incomprehensible to her,
         chose to study languages in this noisy place. Some of the
         off duty guards were here, getting quite drunk as they had
         three days before their next tour. Of the new faces, she saw
         mostly shadow knights, a bit odd, as most of last year's
         recruits had been SK's. Perhaps the war had taken a greater
         toll than Her Majesty made known.<BR>
         <BR>
         Losing interest in the customers and having finished her
         brandy, Mya wrapped herself in her great black cloak and
         slipped downstairs. She was please to see Belyea behind the
         bar; the night would be profitable.<BR>
         <BR>
         
         <HR>
         
         Long ago, when Mya first began practicing her art, she
         targeted the Maiden as an "easy mark." The patrons were
         generally three sheets to the wind, it was dark, and the
         bartenders always seemed to be too busy to see everyone. She
         couldn't have been more wrong.<BR>
         <BR>
         Before she managed to lift her first coin, <A HREF="mya/belyea.htm" TARGET="_blank">Belyea</A>
         had her in one of the back rooms asking her "What in the
         name of Innoruuk do you think you are doing!" Shocked, and
         more than a little scared, she just stared up at him for a
         moment. Finally finding her voice, she said the first thing
         that came into her head.<BR>
         <BR>
         "I'll make you a deal"<BR>
         <BR>
         Now it was Belyea's turn to be shocked.<BR>
         <BR>
         He opened his mouth to speak, abruptly closed it, and sat
         down on a crate. He looked at her a moment, as if judging
         whether she was serious.<BR>
         <BR>
         "Ok, let's hear it."<BR>
         <BR>
         Now what? She had to come up with something fast.<BR>
         <BR>
         "How about five percent?"<BR>
         <BR>
         "Of everything you take while you're here?"<BR>
         <BR>
         Mya nodded.<BR>
         <BR>
         Belyea cupped his chin in his hand and thought for a
         moment.<BR>
         <BR>
         "Make it ten and a ten person per night limit."<BR>
         <BR>
         " And you don't target my employees or my cash box."<BR>
         <BR>
         Mya stuck out her hand and said, "Deal." After all, ninety
         percent of something was better than nothing and being
         turned over to the Dreadguard.<BR>
         <BR>
         
         <HR>
         
         Mya waved to <A HREF="mya/dirza.htm" TARGET="_blank">Dirza</A>
         and <A HREF="mya/mare.htm" TARGET="_blank">Mare</A> and took
         up a seat at the end of the bar. The easiest place not to be
         seen was right out in the open. She ordered ale and passed a
         few words with Belyea. He always had a tip on who her first
         "customer" should be. Tonight it was the card game across
         the room.<BR>
         <BR>
         She never cheated at cards. She didn't have to when the
         other players were either blind drunk or focusing on the
         fact that she was a woman. She poured on the charm and the
         plat came rolling in. Mya passed several hours at the table,
         picking up on several of the players' signals. She would ask
         a question here and there, about the game, or their work,
         sometimes about their families. It never hurt to know what
         you might be up against should you get caught.<BR>
         <BR>
         The conversation had turned to the subject of work. The boys
         at the table were complaining about the extra long shifts of
         late. They said there was one detail in particular, which
         seemed to be getting the short end of the stick. Mya ask
         what they meant and they all passed glances before one of
         them leaned across the table and quietly whispered, "No time
         off for at least two months."<BR>
         <BR>
         Mya sounded horrified as she replied, "How awful!" Her mind
         was calculating the plat in their collective pockets while
         her voice and body was expressing disbelief that such a
         thing could occur in Neriak.<BR>
         <BR>
         "Two months&#133; why, that just can't be right."<BR>
         <BR>
         She looked around the table, noting that the expression on
         each mans' face bore out the truth of the statement. She was
         delighted. There would be the regular wages plus a bonus for
         extended duty and if that applied to the whole
         detachment&#133; She almost couldn't keep the smile from her
         face.<BR>
         <BR>
         Mya glanced around the room and noted the late hour by the
         lack of customers. She was just about to call it a night
         when the lights in the hallway faded a bit and several
         recently off duty guards walked in. The man next to her
         leaned in close to tell her these were some of the very same
         guards they had just been speaking of.<BR>
         <BR>
         There were only four of them and she had already made a tidy
         profit for the evening. Then there was the fact that she
         knew these four had families and she still had to settle
         with Belyea. As she collected her things, she listened to
         the conversation.<BR>
         <BR>
         Nothing new here, complaints about the job and the pay,
         asking after family and friends&#133;<BR>
         <BR>
         "Kzhaddul's not with you tonight?"<BR>
         <BR>
         "No. As soon as we were dismissed he headed for the forest.
         Said something about meeting some friends for a hunt."<BR>
         <BR>
         So this motley crew had a new addition. She'd have to be
         sure to check him out for targetability. Mya ordered one
         last drink and settled with Belyea. She asked him to keep an
         ear out for this Kzhaddul and then she slipped out into the
         night.<BR>
