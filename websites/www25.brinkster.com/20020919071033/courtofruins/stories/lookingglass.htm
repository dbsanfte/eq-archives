         <P><FONT SIZE="+1" FACE="GoudyMedieval">Even deep within the
         mighty guildhall sounds of battle could be heard. Mythas,
         leader of Maelstrom (first amongst all the guilds of Neriak)
         looked upon his officers and trusted men. "My friends Neriak
         is going to fall, of this there is sadly no doubt." The
         mighty ogre shadowknight, Bhaz, looked down at him; " Neriak
         no fall, Maelstrom will save!" he thundered.</FONT></P>
         
         <P><FONT SIZE="+1" FACE="GoudyMedieval">Asphyxia looked at
         Bhaz; "While it is true we do have the power to save Neriak,
         we have committed ourselves across the globe to stop the
         Fier'Dal, it is thus that we are understrength here. Our
         allies have already committed thier forces elsewhere and the
         trolls have refused all requests for aid. We are
         lost."</FONT></P>
         
         <P><FONT SIZE="+1" FACE="GoudyMedieval">Mythas looked upon
         his sullen comrades. " There is one last hope, Innoruuk
         himself has pledged to assist us in one final way. At the
         cost of a single sacrfice, he will open pathways to other
         like dimensions. In spirit, Maelstrom will survive. I say in
         spirit, becuase we will not all, if any be in the same
         places, the decision is put before you all."</FONT></P>
         
         <P><FONT SIZE="+1" FACE="GoudyMedieval">An explosion rocked
         the fabled guildhall....</FONT></P>
         
         <P><FONT SIZE="+1" FACE="GoudyMedieval">Bhaz (and a few of
         the other "lesser races" members) left the great room
         without a word to give themselves to the battle above. Those
         that remained bowed their heads in acceptance. Mythas,
         mightest of the wizards, without a word, stepped into the
         flames and was instantly consumed. Into their midsts formed
         a great shadow of nothingness, a hole of the purest black.
         Bidding goodbye, Asphyxia was the first to step through. One
         by one the officers and most trusted henchmen of Maelstrom
         stepped through.</FONT></P>
         
         <P><FONT SIZE="+1" FACE="GoudyMedieval">An explosion ripped
         the great door off it's hinges. A small force of dwarves
         poured into the room. Kzhaddul, seeing that there was still
         a fair number waiting to get through sounded the Maelstrom
         battle cry and charged, calling for others to follow him,
         they had to hold the dwarves long enough to let as many as
         possible escape. Loyal Tier'Dal fell by his side, but the
         dwarves fell faster. A rain of fire, followed by several
         more cleared out the surviving dwarves. The remaining
         wizards bowed to him. "My Lord you must go, you must be one
         of the ones to continue on."</FONT></P>

         <P><FONT SIZE="+1" FACE="GoudyMedieval">One of the wizards
         smiled as he cast another spell. Kzh was stunned, literally.
         Two of the wizards picked him up as he silently protested
         and just before he was thrown threw the one who stunned him
         said; " For Maelstrom you must live". The world became
         black....</FONT></P>

         <P><FONT SIZE="+1" FACE="GoudyMedieval">Kzhaddul awoke,
         wounded and sore. As he looked around he noticed that he was
         in a graveyard, a very old graveyard.Yes, it did look the
         same, he was in Ferrott, in the graveyard.</FONT></P>
         
         <P><FONT SIZE="+1" FACE="GoudyMedieval">"Welcome Kzhaddul,
         welcome to my graveyard"</FONT></P>
         
         <P><FONT SIZE="+1" FACE="GoudyMedieval">Kzhaddul looked at
         where the voice was coming from. He could barely make out
         the shadow of a man. A shadowed man, no wait, this was the
         graveyard, that meant....</FONT></P>
         
         <P><FONT SIZE="+1" FACE="GoudyMedieval">"Yes, I am a dark

         you enjoy it here, now please leave my
         graveyard."</FONT></P>
         
         <P><FONT SIZE="+1" FACE="GoudyMedieval">Kzh scrambled up and
         out as soon as he could get to his feet. It was only then
         that he realized he was naked. Somewhere deep in his soul he
         heard laughter....</FONT></P>
