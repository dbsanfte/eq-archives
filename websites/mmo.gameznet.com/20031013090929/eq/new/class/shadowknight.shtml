     <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Shadowknights
     are evil warriors who specialize in not only the art of weaponry and
     warfare but in the dark art of necromancy as well. Shadowknights are 3/4
     warrior and 1/4 necromancer, a very powerful mix indeed. If one takes a
     look at all classes and their worth at level 50 the shadowknights are
     perhaps the most powerful. It is a trade off however because getting that
     point will be an extremely long difficult road. Shadowknights are not only
     one of the more hated classes in the game but when you combine that with
     the fact that the evil races make the best shadowknights you will be killed
     on sight in most locations of the game. Shadowknights pay a hybrid penalty
     for experience gained making them the slowest leveling class in the game.
     Combine that with the fact that you will most likely want to be an <a href="file:///E:/gameznet/eq/class/shadowknight.html/../race/ogre.html">ogre</a>
     or a <a href="file:///E:/gameznet/eq/class/shadowknight.html/../race/troll.html">troll</a>(both
     of which suffer racial experience penalties) you can more or less resign to
     the fact that you will level more slowly than most of your comrades in the
     game.<br>
     <br>
     Shadowknights start slowly and peak late. At low levels they are nothing
     more than weak <a href="file:///E:/gameznet/eq/class/shadowknight.html/warrior.html">warriors</a>
     who do not have the benefit of kick and generally have 3 hit points less
     per level. However one ability that shadowknights do get from level 1 and
     no other class in the game will ever gain is harm touch. This allows you to
     do (level*10)+1 point of damage once per game day(about every hour and a
     half). This is the shadowknights reverse version of the <a href="file:///E:/gameznet/eq/class/shadowknight.html/paladin.html">paladin's</a>
     lay hands. The difference is that lay hands can heal most characters to
     full health(though level 32+ warriors will begin to have need a bit more
     healing) from level 1. Harm touch is a nice addition to have however though
     it is much more useful at early levels. For example to a level 4 character
     41 points is a lot of damage. A level 50 character isn't going to get too
     excited about 501 points of damage however. Either way it makes a good last
     chance spell. If you have it free and are considering running but think you
     might have a chance to win it is nice to have. It will soften them up and
     hopefully kill them and save you from zoning.<br>
     <br>
     At level 4 shadowknights get the ability to bash. This is very important
     because up until this point warriors could kick. This allows them to dish a
     bit more damage than a shadowknight of the same level because they have an
     extra attack. Bash however requires a shield which is the biggest reason to
     choose a troll or an ogre than any of the other available races. Large
     races(ogres and trolls) have the ability to slam which let's them bash even
     when wielding a two handed weapon. In the longrun bash is better than kick
     so you will not be missing out on anything. You will also get the leg up on
     non large warriors who need a shield to bash. The reason behind this is
     because you cannot kick magical monsters, yet with a magical sword you can
     bash them. Bash not only does similar damage as kick at higher levels but
     it also can stun which will allow you to catch up to fleeing monsters as
     well as interupting spellcasters.<br>
     <br>
     Upon gaining level 9 make sure to stop by the local shadowknight guild and
     train a point to all of your spell skills(abjuration, conjuration,
     evocation etc). If you do not train a point into your spell skills they
     will not go up and you will be unable to cast spells. We will cover spells
     in a little more detail in a paragraph below but first I wanted to mention
     the other skills that paladins gain at higher levels.<br>
     <br>
     At level 10 shadowknights gain dodge. Warriors gain this ability at level
     6. Dodge allows you to dodge blows before they have a chance to hit you and
     is a very welcome addition. When you combine this with Parry(at level 17)
     and Riposte(at level 30) you will take much fewer blows than most other
     classes in the game. It should be noted that while you get all of these
     skills 4-5 levels later than a warrior you do get them. This is important
     because it goes to show that shadowknights peak later but they do peak and
     in the longrun 3/4 warrior 1/4 necromancer can be much more effective than
     4/4 of either class.<br>
     <br>
     At level 20 you gain the ability to double attack. This is perhaps the most
     important level in a young shadowknights career. Though you never get dual
     wield double attack will suffice. By using a 2 handed weapon in addition to
     slam you will be a force to be reckoned with.<br>
     <br>
     At level 35 you will gain the hide skill. Hide can be thought of as a form
     of invisibility except that you will be unable to move while hidden. This
     is a very important skill to use when meditating as it will keep you from
     getting stepped on by a hill giant or other powerful nasties.<br>
     <br>
     Level 40 sees the final of your meelee skill additions in disarm. Disarm
     rarely works but when it does it is quite useful. Monsters with weapons hit
     harder than those without them. Disarm might allow you to throw the weapon
     from the monsters hands and grab it for your own keeping.<br>
     <br>
     Last but not least shadowknights get meditate at level 14. This is an
     important skill when it comes to spellcasting as it will drastically reduce
     downtime while waiting for mana.<br>
     <br>
     Now that we've covered the meelee end of things let's cover the spells.
     Shadowknight spells are probably the most varied among hybrids. Rangers get
     nice outdoor spells with a bit of healing thrown in. Paladins get buffing
     and healing spells with some undead direct damage spells thrown in for good
     measure. Shadowknights get a great mixture of different spells. The
     majority of these spells revolve around undead, summoning undead, finding
     undead and destroying undead. However it doesn't stop there. Shadowknights
     also get invisibility spells, the ability to see invisible beings, utility
     spells such as siphon strength, lifetap style spells which not only damage
     your foe but heal you, damage over time spells as well as being the one of
     three classes in the game who can summon pets. We will attempt to describe
     the different types of spells in the paragraphs below.<br>
     <br>
     First and foremost let's cover shadowknight pets. Before we even get
     started dispell any thought of using your pet as another party member that
     will allow you to solo as if you had a tank with you. Shadowknight pets
     have recently been improved but they are still quite weak. In general your
     pet will be equal to a monster about half of your level. These pets do not
     make good tanks and really aren't going to be able to dish much damage to
     the monsters you will be facing. That is not to say that they are useless
     however. Shadowknight pets are cheap to summon as they only require cheap
     components(bone chips). Your pet will never share your experience because
     it's never going to survive a fight if used correctly. Shadowknight pets
     can be used to send into battle before you enter the fight. While your pet
     is keeping the monsters distracted you can go ahead and cast spells on the
     monster(just make sure you stand back from a safe distance). Use your
     damage over time spells such as clinging darkness, siphon the monsters
     strength and if you wish go ahead and shoot off any direct damage spells
     that might be useful versus this beast(this is good for undead once you get
     ward). Around this time your pet should will die and the mob will rush you.
     When it does you meelee it to death, gaining assistance from the DoT
     spells. At level 15 you get the mend bones spell which allows you to heal
     your pet, however your better off just letting it die.<br>
     <br>
     The locate corpse and sense undead spells can be useful in certain
     scenarios(trying to find a roaming undead in an outdoor area or trying to
     find youru corpse). They are a nice addition to the spellbook but you will
     not be using them very often. Same thing goes for endure cold. This spell
     is nice to keep up if you make a trip to <a href="file:///E:/gameznet/eq/class/shadowknight.html/../zone/permafrost.html">Permafrost</a>
     but generally you will not use it very often.<br>
     <br>
     Invisibility spells are very useful especially if you are soloing. At level
     9 you will be able to cast invisibility to undead which will be useful in
     primarily undead zones such as <a href="file:///E:/gameznet/eq/class/shadowknight.html/../zone/befallen.html">Befallen</a>
     or <a href="file:///E:/gameznet/eq/class/shadowknight.html/../zone/unrest.html">Unrest</a>.
     At level 30 you will be able to make yourself invisible to the rest of the
     world. This will allow you to be able to travel off the mainland as you
     will be able to sneak in past the guards. It will also allow you to be able
     to sneak by the monsters you do not wish to fight and get right to the
     juicy stuff.<br>
     <br>
     Damage over time spells are the meat of the shadowknights offensive spells.
     These spells will slowly eat away at a monsters hit points. Not only are
     these great for finishing off running monsters but also for general combat.
     Every combat round the monster will take a bit more damage and over the
     course of a battle these will add up.<br>
     <br>
     Fear spells such as fear and spook the dead can be very useful and very
     dangerous to use. These spells will cause your target to turn and run away
     in fear for about 30 seconds. This can be good if you are outnumbered by
     monsters and would like to reduce their numbers. It can become a problem
     however if the monster runs and picks up help on the way back because you
     will now be facing even greater numbers.<br>
     <br>
     The vampiric embrace spell is a very interesting shadowknight spell. This
     is the shadowknights only way of healing themselves. The probelm is that it
     does not let you choose when you need to be healed. This spell has a
     duration. During the duration of this spell you will randomly lifetap on a
     succesful hit. This has the double effect of not only damaging your
     opponent but of healing yourself. The higher your dexteriry the more often
     this will go off. This is a nice addition to the spell collection however
     it can not be relied on to use as healing device as you will be vastly more
     outdamaged in a fight than you will heal yourself.<br>
     <br>
     The ward/expulse undead spells are your best direct damage spells. These
     spells have a pretty good mana:damage ratio versus undead foes. When you
     combine being able to soften up(or finish off) your opponents with these
     spells and your ability to meelee nearly as well as a warrior these spells
     make you very powerful versus undead foes.<br>
     <br>
     At level 15 you get the numb the dead spell. This spell allows you to calm
     undead beings. This means if there are 3 undead monsters in a room and you
     only want to fight one of them then you can numb the other two then drag
     the one monster away to a safe spot and fight him there.<br>
     <br>
     Another useful level 15 spell is shadow step. This spell is a mini teleport
     spell which can be used for escape. This spell will teleport you a short
     distance away and hopefully give you enough seperation between you and the
     attacker so that you can get away.<br>
     <br>
     So you think you want to be a shadowknight? Trying to decide what race to
     be? Well in my opinion there are really only two choices and those are ogre
     and troll. It doesn't really make much sense to be a &quot;good&quot; race
     because you are going to be shunned by your own people anyway. One could
     argue that dark elf shadowknights are the best casters and that is very
     true. However you are 3/4 warrior and 1/4 caster and being such you should
     concentrate on the warrior end of things. Only ogres and trolls will be
     able to slam. Without slam you will need to use a shield if you want to use
     your extra attack(bash). This will make you that much weaker as a meelee
     class and should be avoided.<br>
     <br>
     So which race should you be? My personal pick is an ogre. Not only do they
     have high strength and stamina(for the fighter side of things) but they
     also have a higher intelligence(for spells). The only real reason to be a
     troll is for the natural regeneration. So it really boils down to whether
     you plan to be a solo artist or a team player. In a team an ogre would be
     more beneficial and you could let the healers or bards do the healing. Solo
     you might decide to go with a troll simply because there will be less
     downtime resting.<br>
     <br>
     All in all the shadowknight is a very powerful class. You can use most
     weapons, most armor and have some powerful shadowknight only weapons. The
     ability to cast spells keeps the class from ever becoming boring. On the
     downside you will be killed on sight most everywhere(unless you choose a
     &quot;good race in which case you will be allowed to live but will have a
     hard time finding vendors to deal with you) and your choice of cities to
     bind in will be limited. However being evil also opens up a whole new area
     of opportunity to simply kill everything you come accross and not worry
     about factions. Being a shadowknight will not be easy early on as this
     class really doesn't peak until after level 22. If you don't plan on
     playing much you will probably be better off with another class. If you
     plan on playing to the highest levels however shadowknights might just be
     the perfect class for you.<br>
