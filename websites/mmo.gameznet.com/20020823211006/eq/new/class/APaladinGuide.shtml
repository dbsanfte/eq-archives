<P><B><I>DeHawk's Paladin Review - For We Whom Walk the Road Less Friendly</B></I>

<P>Before I truly begin I want to state that there are two reasons I'm posting this guide, and as there are two reasons, there are also two groups of people that I am writing this for. Group one: Paladins that are up and comming and want to hone their skills a bit and get some refresher knowledge. Group two: People that don't know the difference between a paladin and a ranger - and what we can do. I'll do a guide on what race (Dwarf or Human) we should pick and our good stats (STR DEX AGI).. oh wait, I just said that. Ok, pick Dwarves for stats, they edge out better than humans but humans have better starting faction (nightblind tho) with our stats being close to those of our dwarven breathren. If I had to do it again I'd go human, because that's what I'm familiar with.. but otherwise, go shorties.

<P>The other paladin races aren't so good for the reasons following:<BR>
-High Elves, very low STR. You'll be encumbered often and won't hit as hard as you should.<BR>
-Half Elves, same as High but a little better.. almost, but not quite, as good as humans.<BR>
-Erudites.. I love and respect the few, the proud, the naturally GOOD Erudite Paladins that can get to lvl 50. They have what could be considered the greatest stat problem in the game, with low STR, DEX, AGI, and half decent WIS. Not to mention the newbie zone from hell (Toxx Forrest). Still, no other race looks better decked out in full platemail...

<P>That's it on my character slection tips. Was very deep and inquiring, wasn't it? Heh.

<P>With that said, I'll begin by destroying some false illusions that abound concerning our class. ...


<P><B>Oh you're a hybrid - you can't tank.</B><BR>
First up, we can tank as well as anyone - warriors included. We've been given good AC and decent HP levels for a reason, and it's not there just so we can show off. Yes, most warriors will have higher AC than you. However, it is just as possible for you to raise your own AC level to within 20pts difference of a warrior of comparable level. (IE: 1 or 2 higher at the most) Yeap, that 20 AC can make a difference, but it's a small one. (One thing to remember, however. Warriors get naturally high MR and other resistances - the MR also goes up a couple points or so *I think* per level, but I'm not sure. This means that we have to worry about resist gear earlier on, or at least, wear it more often when we start going out to the upper level mobs. This, sadly, costs us AC, which is one of the reasons you will seldom find a paladin declared as the primary tank - but we still do backup right well) Somthing else I will add, in some dungeons and zones we can tank a helluva lot better than a warrior, just because of our spells - more on this later. Personally, I can routinely taunt mobs off of level 60 warriors (at 52, this is..) even if the mob is red to him - all I need is for the critter to be at least partially non MR, and then the agro goes up the wall. Ask any cleric or chanter: those that can de-agro a mob from a caster are wonderful to have around. Unfortunatey, our damage output is lower than a Warrior (and even SK's or Rangers) which also hurts our sanding as a tank, but when it comes to agro.. we're as good as a ranger, only we do it on purpose.

<P><B>Illusion 2 - Our Spells Suck.</B><BR>
I'll admit, they could be better. TECHNICALLY, it would be possible to up our wisdom to a level that we would be able to have the same mana pool as clerics or other Priest classes - but even then we pay a higher mana cost per cast than the purists do, and we'll be dropping in AC faster than Clinton's pants at an intern convention. However, don't let that fact dismay you. Offensive wise, we have some good casts: Force - 90pt DD stun and knockback; Holy Might - 60pt Stun, Stun - no dmg but fast recast; Root - not only can it stop a mob from moving it also builds up agro like mad; Flash of Light - our only pure Direct Damage spell Vs All, 125pts of it, a good spell to increase our combat effectiveness a bit and again, add the all important agro; Ward Undead Line - it's DD against undead and it does a nice job of it.. again, nothing great but Dismiss Undead is still 162pts of dmg you weren't doing earlier; Spook the Dead, not a great spell as you grow older, but if you can get it to work at the lower levels it can be handy - expecially if you're with a class that can cast snare; Flash of Light - risky to use in dungeons, but it puts you so far up on the agro list it is Not funny (be warned, however! This can also act like a Fear spell if the conditions are right, which can catch many a group surprised - and then dead)

<P>Defensive wise isn't too bad either. Your "Spirit Armor" line of spells - going up to AoF at level 49 and Shield of Words in the mid / late 50's (or earlier, if you find thyself lucky enough to get one of the SoV Paladin Class Specific BP's - including the one that drops in Hate, 2nd Floor) - can be of great use to ease downtime of your group. Ask the cleric if he would mind if you would take over buffing that way - most times the cleric won't mind and you save him / her mana while still getting your group buffed up and prepared. Greater Healing is THE heal spell for you to use for quite a while. When you get it you will be overjoyed, and tho it doesn't make you able to be a pure healer by any means, it CAN and DOES save lives many a time in bad situations.. or can be used to lessen downtime. We get a few Resist spells (the most benificial of which is Endure Magic, +20pts MR; yes, other classes can outbuff it but unless you are on a raid they seldom do, casting this on you and your group is an added bit of protection..) but aside from EM, they don't do too much good.. ah well. We also can cure Disease and Poison, which again can be used to save your life and the life of others. Oh, and speaking of Buffs, we get the nice Symbol Line that Clerics do. Why is this nice? Again, saves on your clerics mana level - and in a pinch, can be used as a cheaper (yet less expensive) HP buff.. a single Jasper (~1pp) is a heck of alot cheaper than a Peridot (~20pp) and the HP difference really isn't that much.

<P>In general, I also refer to our spells in this way:<BR>
Combat (Stuns, Wards, Flame of Light)<BR>
Emergency (Root, Heals)<BR>
Backup (Buffs, Cures)<BR>
Utility (Cancle Magic, Yaulp, Spook the Dead, Flash of Light)<BR>

<P>It's nothing fancy, that's just the way they're used. Seldomly - but occasionally - you will have to cast Backup spells in combat... Utility spells, eh. It depends. You won't be casting them consistantly in battle, but at times, when the situation demands it, you will.. same with outside of a fight, doing it then aswell, when ecessary, but deffinately not always. I'll say this many times.. always, always keep enough mana.. I don't like to go below 40%... for emergency spells. A timely root or heal may save not only your life but the lives of your groupmates AND anyone else in the general vacinity. (And if you don't beleive that, go play around in Velks or Karnors on a bad day.. tell me that moibs that run at a bad time don't cause hell.. ;) )

<P>Speaking of combat spells, let me point out my favorite line: Stun. Stun is a beautiful spell line, they are fast casting, build agro, some damage (depending), and.. stun. I'm not going to tell you why stun is important (it stops mobs froma ttacking you for a few seconds and interrupts mobs spellcasting).. ok, so I just told you, but.. keep one, if not two - or even all three - stuns loaded AT ALL TIMES. Make use of them aswell.. they will help, well and truly.


<P>Now then, next..
<P><B>Ok wiseguy, you sound like you know so much - what is our role?</B>

<P>Well that I can answer in a question: What type of role are you speaking of? General grouping or raiding? And if rading, Zone Raiding or Epic Raiding? Guess I'd better define what I mean by this.

<P>- General grouping: You go into a dungeon or other zone and ask for a group.<BR>
- Raiding: Going with a number of people into an area to accomplish a specific task.<BR>
- Zone Raiding: Going with a group of people into a zone where raids are the only time (or most of the time) the zone is used for; IE: Plane of Growth, Plane of Fear, Temple of Veeshan, Howling Stones, Chardok, ect.<BR>
- Epic Raiding: Going into a zone, regardless of zone, after an Epic Item. Unfortunatly, some epic items (The Cleric note from the Overking in Chardok, killing the Dragon Gorenaire for the Paladin Book of Frost, ect) are obtainable only on a Zone Raid.. because what i mean by this is simply one or two groups doing the assult, and usually going after a mob that is either a rare/random spawn or is a triggered spawn. Examples of this include the Epic Spawned version of Venri Sathir, or Xenovorash in the Lake of Ill Omen. 

<P>Now with those four stated, let me describe your role in each - or what our role should be. At the begining of this I will also say the few things we should be doing ALL THE TIME, regardless of what type of group we're in.

<P><I>All The Time Duties</I>. Your mission, weather you accept it or not, is to do Melee Damage. Get in there, swing away with whatever weapon you're using. You are also - unless specifically told not to - to make sure that you have an agro range just below that of whomever is the main tank, or to keep the agro if you are the main tank. Also important is to keep your group alive, and be the backup for the cleric. You have a fast casting heal at 39 that's called Greater Healing and it takes one bubble (or so) of mana per cast but heals 300hp - more than enough to notice a change in the life level of your local caster or healer. It even does good to bring up your other groupmate's health postfight.

<P>You also need to try and ease the mana load on your cleric (or whomever else is doing the buffing) by providing buffs in terms of AC and the occasional time you will be asked to Symbol your group. Don't argue with 'em, this is helpful by decreasing downtime, which increase exp in the end. Speaking of mana, don't blow it all on combat spells. Clartiy is a great thing, but don't abuse it (unless you've had Clarity 2 casted on you, in which case, you'll never need to med for more than a minute at max) - never go below half mana on combat spells unless necessary to keep agro up. (Keep in mind, ROOT should not be considerd an "in combat" spell, because of how useful it is and how powerful it can be.. learn root, learn how to use it well, trust me)


<P><I>General Grouping.</I> In this, our role can be one of a couple things. We are either the Main Tank, Main Puller, Backup Tank, Backup Puller or just simply, A_Random_Tank_01 where we get to do damage and not worry about the rest. These roles are pretty self explanitory, if you are the main puller you pull if you're the main tank you tank, if you're the secondary anything you.. well, you're backup incase the main tank dies or whatnot. Not too hard to figure out..

<P><I>Zone Raiding</I>. Now here's a time when you will never, if ever, be the puller. What you will be is a reserve tank.. you're there to do melee & magical damage and to ensure the safety of the people in your group - and if necessary, other groups. This is a time when you should have Lay of Hands up and ready at all times if possible, and if things start to go bad, you LoH someone that NEEDS it, IE: the Main Tank or a Cleric or even more important, one of the Enchanters. Here's another annoying thing.. you will very seldomly be the person that needs it. Now, use it on yourself if you must and there isn't someone else who needs it more, but otherwise, keep it saved. Keep in mind tho, if you have low hp's and no mana, you're a downgraded Warrior in all respects and not too useful to anyone, which is why I say that you cast it on one of the "necessary" classes if it comes down to it..

<P>Another thing about being on a major raid like this, one part I don't like, but will do if told. Of all the classes that go on a raid, we are the most useLESS in BossMob encounters. The only things that make us viable are Bash and Stun, with the rare heal or LoH. Even Rangers get to do lots and lots of damage, hell, same with SK's. Sadly then, if your luck is like mine, oft you will be given the job to agro a mob.. that can Death Touch. What happens in this instance is you run up, get aggro'd, get your name screamed out and then end up dead. Afterwards you get to go over and take a smoke, get a drink, use the toilet, play a game of solitare or whatever until teh mob is dead and you get your rez (or until the raid is killed off and a CR has been put underway).

<P>Glamorous, it ain't. Necessary, yes.. sometimes. I've been used as Mr_DT_Magnet many a time.. I also have this deep connection for mobs that deatchtouch.. before they made Cazic Thule a good fight, I ended up being abused by him up to 6 DT's in one raid - and that was just from killing stuff in his zone.

<P><I>Epic Kills</I>. A spot where we really shine, because 95% of the time we can do just about anything. I've been asked on so, so many epic bug hunts it's not funny. We've got the HP and AC to tank, the power to do damage, the ability to build agro; in short, we've got the power to tank and tank well against these (usually) single mobs and such. Most other paladins I know also get called in to help many a time for many a reason, eiter as the main tank or backup. Now, unlike Zone Raids, here you may be wanted to be the puller, main assist, or whatever else necessary at the time. 

<P>Treat this sort of thing like you would any exp group but give it your best.. keep in mind that a failure on a spawned mob is a Bad Thing since it noramlly makes the spawn-er restart the quest in part or completely... this is bad, incase you couldn't figure that out.


<P>Ah, where to go next. Actually, good idea.


<P><B>Here are a few good zones to go to, and reasons why, in your quest for experience and more...</B>

<P>Unrest: Good dungeon to learn how to pull and manage agro. Also VERY much undead, with only a few mobs not counting as such (Fungus, Werebats, Death Beetles, Tentacle Terrors) Good for 15 to 20 then again 27 to 30-32 at the max.

<P>Lake of Ill Omen: Good exp from 18 to 30, crap for loot. Also undead wanders a bit here, letting you keep your EVOC skill up a ways.

<P>Frontier Mountains: Great loot, bad exp. Go figure.. can take you from 30 to 38 or 39 here. Keep in mind that the Giants won't be stunned if you stun or bash them, it only works to build agro.

<P>Overthere: Bad, and I do mean BAD loot, great exp.. welcome to "balance" in everquest. However, you can stun like a monster here, so do it frequently.. watch out for the local Dragoons, they hurt a bit.

<P>Lower Guk: Both good loot and exp. Also ALOT of undead here, only problem is that you will usually not have an easy time getting a group before 39.. but try anyways. I was able to solo with a mith2h and ghoulbane at 30 on the front end mobs, but.. wasn't always easy, so be careful if you go this route. Expect to be here from 30 to 50 if you can stand it that long..

<P>Crystal Caverns: I could say a dictonary full of good and kind words about this place, but that'd be boring as all to read. Instead, allow me tu sum it up like this: EXP, LOOT. Let me repeat.. EXP and LOOT. No other zone has loot this good for the level range supported, period. No other zone has the exp, either.. one thing tho, you have to get to here through a fotress of RyGorr Orcs in the lvl 40 range which hit for 120's.. so be careful and try to travel there with a group.. due to the difficulty gettingt here, few people go that aren't looking to farm items or money. 

<P>Eastern Wastes: Good sov zone. Like all the other outdoor sov areas (not counting DN as outdoor, you don't portal in to outdoor zones, I'm sorry) there is nada in terms of undead - but there are enough mobs and GOOD loot to keep you well and happy, as well as entertained. However, a warning.. like all other sov zones, the mobs in here are ultra agro, hit harder than what you would expect and hit faster than what you'd expect from similarly level'd mobs. Then again platnium drops, velium weapons and the like are ultra common.. lvl range: 35 to 49..

<P>Dreadlands: GO HERE. You can barrel through 40 to 50 in a short order. You will get alot of experience on mobs that have tons of HP, mobs that hit hard, and mobs that will hit fast. Infact, I'd recommend going here over LGuk, or even Eastern Wastes. While the only undead is in a camp in the far north east corner, DL has a number of things going for it.. close to a melee bind spot (FV, FM).. the undead that ARE here are single pullable - and even better, spookable - and to make things great, you get to fight one of my favorite critters..

<P>The Drovlarg. Why do I like these dog beats, these overgrown gnolls, these realitives of Flippy Darkpaw on steroids that sound like a Kobold having a rectal exam? Well, they hit for moderate damage and up, giving you a chance to wake up to the upper level game. They also have reasonable ammounts of HP - even below reasonable in some cases, which makes them good kills.. they drop good loot, lots of plat, gems, words, runes, bronze armor. But the real reason I like these.. they stun oh so well. A single stun - and I mean the level 30 one, even - can lock them up for up to 5 to 10 seconds. Ain't that grand? Builds up agro nicely too, but if you really work it you can neutralize them for a good 25% of the fight.. THIS IS WONDERFUL. This breed of critter is why I recommend this zone to everyone.. (They also spawn in FV, but due to lag, pathing and "helpful" npcs, that's a really bad hunting ground.. sadly..)


<P>Now when you consider where to go and what to do for 50+.. you'll find it all breaks down into 3 dungeons, but I'll also suggest a couple others that aren't oft used - which means with a good solid group, you can take brutal advantage of them. I've been to every dungeon I'm about to list.. (Which may be why I level slow.. I like to quest, read, write, and have variety.. /shrug)

<P>Old Sebilis: Hard at times to find groups, most people think that only warriors can tank and thus you're not needed.. give them a couple good sessions with you as the tank and let 'em learn. Loot here is amazing, and that's all I'll say about that.. you can hit 60 here easily. You do need a Key to get in however, but a fast jaunt through Trak's Teeth with a small group and a good tracker will get you the necessary medallions from the Froglok Hunter and Forager.

<P>Karnors Castle: Two things that any paladin should know is wonderful to have in this place. Undead (nearly half the zone, if not more) and Drovlargs. Loot is good/great, platnium drops are common (not as much so as seb, same with gems) and the items that drop vary from decent to obscenely wonderful. Oh yea, and yer one zone away from FV and a bind spot..

<P>Velkator's Labyrnth: Loot is bad on the bugs and statues. Unless you're fighting in the upper part of Velk's, where the loot (items) are insane and surpass Deepwater Armor with much ease. Also a very nice Paladin weapon - no drop, great stats - called the sword of blessings drops in here. Oh yea.. loot is good, so I am told, off of the Kobolds.. The good news? EXP here will make every other zone look awful in comparison.


<P>Atm, at least on Veesh, those are the top three zones. Here are a few other suggestions..

<P>The Hole: Good exp from 40 to 60... exp modifer is around 25% more per kill than a normal dungeon. Loot isn't bad either..

<P>Kedge Keep: The exp is good, the zone is hard, few people like to come here, sadly..

<P>Wakening Lands: SoV Quest Gems make up this land, at least in terms of things you should be killing around 45 to 55. Genoids my friend, genoids..

<P>Siren's Grotto: When SoV first came out the best guilds in the game got wiped out hard fast and often by the pathing. Then they changed it a bit to make it easier, however, the legacy still lives on. (And it's not easy to get to, anyways) I love to hunt here when ppossible, really.. strange.. zone. Good exp - almost as good as Velks - and the loot is rather nice aswell.

<P>I used to love Chardok, but ever since I wasin a guild that raided there about 3 times a week for 4 motnhs straight.. hell no. Still a good zone to camp the front end of tho..


<P>More zone information..
<P><B>Good drops and where for our class.</B>

<P>From 1 to 35 or so.. don't expect to GET good drops. This sounds mean but little "good" equipment drops durring these levels. I encourage farming of lowbie zones for a few fast plat (just don't take the spot from groups that can get exp) and I did it often to support myself through these levels (once I hit the mid 30's, anywho). My motto, "Loot is forever Exp can be regained" may seem to be greedy by some... but it's kept me well armored, even if it meant I level'd slow.

<P>Now at 35, start hanging out in Guk, Crystal Cavs, and the Eastern Wastes. Might also want to run into Thuragdim B (Icewell Keep) a few times for any armor that might be rotting (Do NOT beg from the people that hunt here, it's in bad taste) and even better, the Velium Round Shield. It's got 15 AC, +10 to SVCold, has a great look, and is VERY low weight. The cloesest competitor is a shield that weighs 12 stones and has 14 ac.. Oh, and while in LGuk, pick yourself up a free pair of the Shin Greeves - infact, come here earlier if you risk and try to loot a pair that are rotting, unless you have better.. they are basically Bronze Legs with stats and a steel look.

<P>In those three zones you can get A) weapons (any of the midbie weaps out of CC), Armor (RyGorr Chain Mail in EW), and Money (Guk).. and by money I also mean items you can sell to other players. 

<P>And I'll assume that by 47 you'll be getting yourself inolved in Raids to the Alternate Planes (Fear, Hate) for the armor and weapons there.. you'll know this stuff once you hit your low 40's, trust me.

<P>Karnors has a few peices of Deepwater Armmor for you to attempt to pick up: Gaunts, Boots, Legs (If you get lucky enough to be on a raid to kill VS)

<P>Sebilis is where you can find DW Bracers, Vams, and the Helm (which you can actually buy in your low 30's if they are as common on your server as they are on mine) not to mention the BP, which drops off of Trakanon himself. 

<P>Velk's has some armor and good weapons for us.

<P>Kael Drakkel is where you can find a good Paladin only cloak..


<P>Now, you should know all that by the time you start hitting those zones to begin with, but I will add in a few things you might have forgotten about.

<P>Castle Mistmoore: A good and oft forgotten cloak, the Hooded Black Cloak, drops here. You can farm it solo in your high 40's low 50's, just be prepared for a helluva fight getting out (I recommend jumping on the doorway of the castle after you cross the bridge, then run up and over the walls to the fountain.. camp first to kill any agro you might have built up before you drop down)

<P>Icewell Keep: If you don't find keeping the dwarves on your side is a good thing, go here and kill. The armor that drops here is superior to Valoirum (Plane of Fear Paladin Armor) in AC and almost as good in stats. 

<P>Lower Guk: FBSS and TBB. One is bad AC with good haste, the other is no haste with good AC and 15 STR. Also, the Enameled Black Breastplate. It's 25 AC, cheap, and if you hate the look of the Treeweave as much as I did.. Mithirl 2h sword isn't a bad weapon - not great either, but not bad - which you can pick up fer cheap now aswell.

<P>Liberated Citadel of Runneye: Good Paladin 1hs weapon for your low 30's (Sporali Defender's Blade) and an AWESOME mask - Grotesque Alloy - (which of course is as rare as you'll ever see.. /sigh) drops here. 

<P>The Estate of Unrest: Jagged Bands work well until you can buy the AC 5 HP +55 rings or the AC 6 HP +65 variety.

<P>Befallen: The new armor that drops there, while nothing great, is a good thing to tide you over durring your transition from Bronze to Armor of Ro / RyGorr Chain (the latter of which I recommend now)


<P>Well, for what I've said - and it's been alot - this will hopefully be a bit of a help. Before I end it I wish to say four things:

<P>1: Never give up, if you can't find a group start a twink.<BR>
2: Do not think that your mana is only for your personal use, use it to help heal 'n buff, and remember that you are at all times charged with keeping the chanter and cleric alive using whatever means necessary.<BR>
3: QUEST OFTEN. We're a melee class but we can still hold our own in getting items for ourselves, and farming them for profit.

<P><B>And last but not least...</B><BR>
Fight hard, fight often, fight for life and fight for love, peace will come to you when your battles are all said and done.
