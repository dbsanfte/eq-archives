                    <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8"><font face="Verdana" size="2">This
                    guide will serve as a strategy for those of you who wish to
                    hunt at the dungeon of Befallen. I have spent a great amount
                    of time in this dungeon, and have decided to pass along my
                    opinions, strategies, and tactics regarding this undead
                    wonderland. It should be said that while this is designed
                    with clerics in mind, much can be used by other classes. I
                    will proceed with stages of increasing reward and
                    difficulty, including both soloing and grouping strategy.
                    For those of you who live under rocks, Befallen is in the
                    West commonlands, two zones west of Freeport. The best way
                    to find it is to run west through the newbie garden at
                    Freeport, scale the sandy mountains to left of you in the
                    East Commonlands and follow them til you zone into the West
                    Commonlands. Then continue to run along the sandy mountains
                    until you come across a hole in the side of the mountain
                    with a blue glow. Be careful of Hill Giants, Kizdean Gix,
                    and wandering Ghouls. Walk through the short hallway,
                    careful not to step on all the meditating PCs, and proceed
                    into the dungeon.</font></p>
                    <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8"><b><font face="Verdana" size="2">You
                    have arrived.</font></b></p>
                    <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8"><font face="Verdana" size="2">You've
                    just zoned into Befallen and were greeted by a Ghoul who
                    decided to gnaw on your arm as you oriented yourself to the
                    first hallway. You quickly turn around and zone, asking
                    yourself why you traveled through so many zones to get
                    whooped up on.</font></p>

                    to Befallen.</font></b></p>
                    <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Like
                    many other popular hunting grounds, you have just
                    experienced a &quot;train.&quot; In this case, the ghoul
                    (who resides in the third level) will wander around feasting
                    on youngsters in the first level until some seasoned vets
                    answer the numerous shouts of &quot;GHOUL!&quot; and
                    &quot;Stop training from the third level!&quot; and put the
                    smack down. Don't be discouraged! This happens all the time.
                    What you did is the most common (and effective) form of
                    fighting and retaining experience in Befallen. Retaining
                    experience means earning experience, while not dying (some
                    people are content with just gaining experience, but I enjoy
                    retaining far more, trust me). Learn when to turn tail and
                    haul arse to that zone. Clerics, when you hit 2 bubbles left
                    of health, and you've got two skeletons on you, cast Divine
                    intervention and make a dash for the door (Note: Divine
                    Intervention = 1st level cleric spell renders the caster
                    invulnerable for 30 seconds). This is the most important
                    fact of life for you &quot;power levelers.&quot; Use the
                    easy zone access to save your life and the life of your
                    party. Also, clerics, if you are in a group, cast Divine
                    Intervention and tank that Ice-Boned skeleton while your
                    party members zone to safety. Well enough about running
                    away, let's talk hunting!</font></p>
                    <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8"><b><font face="Verdana" size="2">You
                    seek revenge (Levels 5 through 8).</font></b></p>
                    <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Now
                    it's time to assess your prey. In the first level, there are
                    NPCs of varying difficulty, though most of the spawning
                    types are good solid fights for level 5-8 PCs. I recommend
                    collecting all the stackable giant rat parts you can
                    (stackable means you can have up to twenty, rat ears, for
                    instance, in one inventory slot). These make surprisingly
                    good cash when you sell them in bunches of 20 or so. Please,
                    do your fellow Befallen hunter a favor and remember to
                    destroy what you do not take off your fallen adversaries.
                    So, let's see, soloing at levels 5-8 can be quite
                    profitable, as long as you stay away from the Llrodd
                    Skeleton near the well, the shadowknight in the room next to
                    the Llrodd, and getting double and triple teamed. Oh yeah, I
                    forgot, GET BOUND in Freeport. It will save you headaches,
                    and you'll get quite good at making the run from Freeport to
                    Befallen. :P Putrid Skeletons can be tough for casting
                    classes early on especially if coupled with a regular or a
                    few giant rats. Remember to con everything, and run to the
                    zone when you are overmatched. Clerics Note: A huge part of
                    hunting in Befallen is the temptation to nuke every walking
                    corpse with Ward Summoned. Don't. I'm sure if you are
                    playing a cleric you've read somewhere how to save your mana
                    for healing, rather than offense. No where is that theory
                    applied better than when fighting Undead masses. You can
                    solo decently in Befallen with your normal blunts, adding a
                    Ward here and there. The nice thing about Divine
                    Intervention is that it's relatively cheap mana-wise, so you
                    should always have that handy. When I hunt in Befallen, and
                    I have full mana, I can routinely take things down that con
                    red, even up to 4 levels above my own. This is why we are
                    clerics. We punish the dead. I do not recommend this unless
                    you know the lay of the land, and are very good at timing
                    your ofensive spells in combat. Though there's nothing like
                    lighting up a greater skeleton with 4-5 Wards, it seriously
                    hampers your efficiency in achieiving experience.</font></p>
                    <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8"><b><font face="Verdana" size="2">You

                    <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8"><font face="Verdana" size="2">You
                    been clobbering the denziens of the first level, avoided the
                    trains of Dread Bones, Ice-Bones, and Acolytes, and even
                    managed to take down that &quot;gatekeeper&quot;
                    shadowknight and picked up his key. You are curious about
                    what lies behind the locked door. You finally figure out how
                    to operate the door with your newfound key (ugh! that took
                    me 15 minutes the first time :P), and you venture inside.
                    Approaching the crumbled staircase, you see a Bard running
                    for his life with 5 uglies chasing him up the stairs. You
                    turn tail but you are slain by (insert tough Undead here)
                    before you can fumble with the darn key and run to zone.
                    That was my first experience with the second floor. Ok, as a
                    spellcaster, I IMPLORE you to group before venturing
                    downstairs. With that in mind, we enter my group strategy
                    section of Befallen. This dungeon is a dangerous place, but
                    with efficient grouping skills and competent members, you
                    can level up like no other place I know of.</font></p>

                    <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Begin
                    by sitting in the entrance to Befallen and shout around for
                    a couple of folks to join you for some undead bashing.
                    Before entering, make sure you have at LEAST one tank, and
                    at LEAST, one cleric or druid (the slacker healers). This is
                    definitely one of the few places where a wizard can be
                    substituted for with a cleric (Cleric's Wards rival Wizard's
                    Bolts, but for other creatures, I have to give props to
                    wizzies, obviously). Ok, game on. You want as many clerics
                    as you can get your hands on for four fairly obvious
                    reasons; to take the mana load off from 1)buffing, 2)
                    healing, 3) creating food and water and 4) burning with
                    wards if the situation calls for it. Those four functions
                    create a large burden on the cleric to manage his mana
                    efficiently, and to meditate whenever possible. A great idea
                    is to stake out one of the rooms on the second level, and
                    send your tank to pull things into your room. This is a good
                    way to start each battle, as each group member can flow into
                    his/her role easily, if all the uglies are on the tank.
                    Watch for spawns inside your area, however, and idiots who
                    get in over their heads and train a bunch of uglies through
                    your room while you all have your noses in your books.
                    Nothing creates panic more than to see a MOB show up while
                    you are all at half or less mana, or even worse, tanks at
                    half or less health.</font></p>

                    courteous to your fellow man (elf, dwarf, etc.) and open
                    that 1st level door for anyone shouting for help. Whether
                    the person is in need of an escape, can't find their key, or
                    is retrieving their corpse, they need someone to open the
                    door. Also, if someone trains a bunch of baddies up to the
                    zone point, and there's 5 or 6 people medding in that
                    corridor, get your nose out of the book and be a sport; join
                    the fight. You can always zone out of the fray if that ghoul
                    is giving you a good once over. Apologies to those above
                    15th level or so, but I haven't been able to research the
                    third floor much. When I do, I'll append this guide. As
                    always, let me know what you think.</font></p>

                    have appended it sooner. I have now reached the 20th level,
                    and can fairly say I have become an expert at Befallen.
                    Before I wrap up the Third Floor, I'd like to thank all of
                    you who emailed me with tidbits of information. There are
                    too many people to list, but you know who you are!</font></p>
                    <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8"><b><font face="Verdana" size="2">Back
                    into the depths of Befallen...</font></b></p>
                    <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Now
                    you have decided to penetrate the deepest part of this
                    Undead lair, and you need to know what lies ahead. Well,
                    let's start with the door, shall we? As you approach the
                    steps down to the 3rd locked door, there is a spawn at the
                    top of the stairs. This spot is usually occupied by a
                    greater skeleton, but can be a variety of ugly things, with
                    the toughest being a necro acolyte, ghoul, or ice boned
                    skeleton, and the weakest being a large skeleton. As you go
                    down the stairs, there is a spawn point on both the left and
                    the right of the door. These points can bring the toughest,
                    non-special MOB in the whole dungeon; the theurgist. These
                    are the head necromancers and are between 17-20 in level.
                    They are very hard to solo when they have a pet, I would
                    recommend only taking them in when in a group; their DoTs
                    are wicked and they can hit fairly hard for being casters.
                    Other spawns at this point include ice bones, greaters,
                    ghouls, and lesser necros. Keep in mind that the cruelest of
                    skeletons lurks behind the door, and will open the door and
                    come to the aid of its comrades. This fiend I speak of is
                    the elf skeleton, around level 20, and hits hard and fast.
                    This creature is important to dark elves as it drops pieces
                    of mallet for the Thex Mallet quest. Be wary of the elf if
                    you are under 18 or a caster, because it can rip you up.
                    This is a good place to mention the level range of the third
                    floor. I would suggest that you wait and get a full party of
                    16s or 17s before you even attempt to cross the threshold
                    here. A wiser choice would be several 18s or 19s IMHO.</font></p>
                    <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8"><font face="Verdana" size="2">With
                    the glass key from the Ogre SK in hand, you open the third
                    door and arrive at the elf skeleton's spawn point. Move
                    fast, for that fiend spawns rather quickly. Proceed down the
                    hallway and feel around the right wall for a secret door.
                    Here you can walk through a portion of the wall, and are
                    quickly met with two spawn points, one behind a chair, and
                    the other in the middle of the small room. Conquer these
                    foes and continue on to a vast cave-like chamber. There are
                    two or three weak spawn points at the edges of this room,
                    but they are slow. This is a good thing, because you have
                    arrived at the most coveted spot in the third floor. This is
                    a relatively &quot;safe&quot; place to rest and meditate
                    from your battles. I use the word &quot;safe&quot; with
                    caution as no one, no where can be completely safe, so still
                    be careful. There are three rooms for you to choose from as
                    you sit against the back wall of the cavernous room. To the
                    left, there are two special spawns, in addition to several
                    normal spawns. This room contains the thaumaturgist, a level
                    20-22 necro very much like the theurgists. It is this
                    thaumaturgist which drops the coveted Gossamer Robe (AC 8,
                    casters only, white appearance). The Gossamer Robe is the
                    rare drop, and the common drop is the thaumaturgist's robe
                    (AC 5, AGI +3, casters only, brown appearance). These robes
                    fetch a very nice price: Gossamer gets between 30-60pp in
                    the Freeport Area (I got nearly 100pp in the Qeynos area)
                    and the Thaum Robe draws between 20-40pp. That's not all.
                    She usually drops the Dagger of Marnek (weak damage/delay,
                    but INT +3, +15 vs. Magic, necro only) which can get around
                    20pp as well. If you think that's plenty for this room,
                    there is still Priest Aziz, a rare spawn who drops the
                    blackened wand, which is part of a monk quest. He's a tough
                    necro, a little stronger than the thaum or the theurgists,
                    but well worth the story.</font></p>
                    <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8"><font face="Verdana" size="2">The
                    middle room contains the broken well. This is the room you
                    fall into when you jump down the well near the Llrodd
                    skeleton on the first floor. This is a great way to reach
                    the third level if you are trying to join a party already
                    down camping, or even when invisible to drag your corpse to
                    the door for an easier rescue. So don't be surprised if a
                    group tells you to meet them on the third floor, and to just
                    jump down the well...just make sure you TRUST them...hehe.
                    There are two spawn points in the well room, as well as one
                    leading into the well room, just FYI.</font></p>
                    <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8"><font face="Verdana" size="2">The
                    room on the right is the reason you see 25+ level PCs in
                    Befallen, for there spawns the Troll SK with the BBC, or
                    Bone Bladed Claymore. The Troll, IMHO, is a pussy cat in
                    full plate. I've never had a problem killing him, even when
                    I was 16 or 17 in a full group. Yes, is harm touch is rough
                    on a caster type, but if you are prepared to heal that
                    unlucky chum, you'll be allright. There are about 5 spawn
                    points in the short hallway and in the SK room, so it is
                    best to keep it clear while waiting for the Troll to spawn.
                    I have heard rumors that the Troll will only spawn WITH the
                    BBC once or twice per RL day. Who knows. I've spent 5 hours
                    at a time down there, and killed the troll about 6-7 times,
                    and got one BBC. I'm sure others have had different
                    experiences.</font></p>
                    <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8"><font face="Verdana" size="2">The
                    rest of the third floor consists of 4-5 rooms that contain
                    normal spawns, save one. There is a female drow SK which
                    drops the barbed leggings, but I have never seen her. Most
                    of the time, when someone wants to hunt the third floor,
                    they are talking about &quot;camping the thaum and SK.&quot;
                    Always be wary of trains, and have a great time! You will
                    see less high level campers with the new &quot;Yield&quot;
                    rule, so you should make some very good money down here for
                    your level, and come out with a couple of nice items to
                    sell/trade at your server's next bazaar to boot!</font></p>
