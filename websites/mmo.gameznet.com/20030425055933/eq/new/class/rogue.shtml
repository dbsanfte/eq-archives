     <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8"><font face="Verdana" size="2">So..
     you want to be a Rogue do ya?</font>
     <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Maybe
     this guide will help you on your way... and maybe it will help you on
     another choice for a class. All in all … this guide was written to help
     any adventurer out weather rogue, cleric, mage, or any of the other
     classes.</font><u><i><b></p>
     <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Race</font></b></i></u></p>
     <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8"><font face="Verdana" size="2">So...
     the first question is... what race do you want your rogue to be?</font></p>
     <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Halflings
     are said to make the best rogue... with naturally high dex and agility...
     as well as decent strength and stamina. They also wear small sized armor...
     which is lighter and cheaper then both medium and large type armor.. which
     adds to their playability. They also get infra-vision... which helps on
     those dark Norrath nights..</font></p>
     <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8"><font face="Verdana" size="2">My
     personal favorite is the wood elf, for many reasons.</font></p>
     <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8"><font face="Verdana" size="2">-First,
     they are natural rogues by sorts in their high agility and dexterity make
     em wonderful at their trade.</font></p>
     <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8"><font face="Verdana" size="2">-They
     also have the option of wearing both small and medium armor, where a
     Halfling can only wear small. This plays a greater factor in some magic
     armor that is medium… and some magic armor that is small. This allows the
     Wood-Elf and Dark-Elves to wear both... which adds to the amount of toys
     they have access too.</font></p>
     <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8"><font face="Verdana" size="2">-Wood-Elves
     also have foraging... a rogues best friend. Foraging helps a rogue stay out
     of towns and hunt for a long time, and help them get food when t would
     otherwise be impossible without the help of other players. Though the
     foraging skill does not go up for wood-elves that aren't druids or rangers,
     the skill it begins at is adequate enough to supply yourself with food and
     water.</font></p>
     <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8"><font face="Verdana" size="2">-
     Wood-elves also get infra-vision... which edges them above the human and
     barbarians.</font></p>
     <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Dark-Elves
     come in second in my choice for a rogue... and nearly are as good as a
     wood-elf... if not equal to them in diversity. The one thing that
     Dark-elves have over Wood-elves is Infra-vision... but their race/class
     combo makes them hated throughout Norrath. If you choose to be a thief-type
     and role-play evil more... maybe Dark-Elves would be a wiser choice then
     Wood-elves.</font></p>
     <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8"><font face="Verdana" size="2">-Barbarians
     also have a strength... though many weaknesses to go with it. The slamming
     ability of the barbarian class gives Barbarian Rogues an edge over their
     counterparts... allowing them to stun their opponents (for a little damage)
     and then whirl around for a backstab. The slamming ability, however, never
     goes up in skill for a rogue.. so you have to be content with 1 - 4 damage
     with it. Barbarians also have the ability to wear both medium and large
     type armor (which makes them edge out human-type rogues) as well as being
     an excellent fighter. Barbarians, however, along with humans are blind as a
     bat when it comes to night. If you choose a Barbarian of any type... you
     need to get a Greater Lightstone as soon as possible, or find yourself
     stumbling into camps of monsters and dying often.</font></p>
     <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8"><font face="Verdana" size="2">-Humans
     rogues have two weaknesses. They are limited to medium armor and have no
     infravision. If you choose a Human rogue... make sure to read what I said
     about Barbarians.</font></p>
     <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8"><font face="Verdana" size="2">-I
     would not recommend a gnome or a Dwarf as a rogue... though Dwarfs tend to
     have the stats. They might have the numbers down.. but to me its hard to
     imagine a successful gnome or dwarf rogue. They might.. however.. be better
     Rogues then humans and/or barbarians... but I'm not too certain. Also
     Dwarfs never seem to like Rogues.. although not KOS by the dwarf guards..
     it was a very hard time to get a shopkeeper to deal with you. I ruled out
     Gnomes fairly quickly just going to Ak'Anon once... I despise that city. =P
     Also they never liked me much after I killed all their zoo exhibits.</font></p>
     <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Whichever
     the class, pick the one you want to be by the area you are in and what type
     of character you want to be. Being the &quot;Ultimate&quot; rogue with best
     stats would lead you to be a Halfling, but that won't help you much if all
     your friends are Barbarians. So choose a race with both the class in mind
     and your preferences. How you use ability points is another factor, which
     brings me to my next Topic.</font><u><i><b></p>
     <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8"><font face="Verdana" size="2">How
     to Spend your Ability points</font></b></i></u></p>
     <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Spending
     your ability points is really flexible.. depending on what you want to do
     with your rogue. I'll just basically tell what each stat does and tell you
     my preference.</font></p>
     <blockquote>
      <i><b>
      <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Strength</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana">
      - </font></i><font face="Verdana" size="2">Strength basically affects your
      damage a little bit, but more importantly how much you can carry. If your
      a small class, (dwarf, gnome, Wood-elf, dark-elf, halfling, etc) you want
      your strength to be at least in the 70's... to be able to wear your armor
      and higher for the medium/large classes...</font></p>
      <i><b>
      <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Dexterity
      </font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana">- </font></i><font face="Verdana" size="2">Dexterity
      supposedly affects how often you hit in melee combat, but haven't seen
      this shown much. Dexterity does affect missile/throwing weapons however,
      so if you are planning on using archery or throwing.. make sure you have a
      decent dexterity. Dexterity also determines the rate at which magical
      effects on weapons take effect, so dexterity will play a more important
      role later on in your career as a rogue. Dexterity also slightly affects
      the usage of your skills.. Such as pickpocketing, picking locks and what
      not. Dexterity is one of the prime Requisites for a Rogue... at least
      thats what Verant leads you to believe.</font></p>
      <i><b>
      <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Agility</font></b></i><font face="Verdana" size="2">-
      This is the mother of all stats for a Rogue, as well as any melee class in
      my opinion. Agility is the skill that most directly impacts your character
      in his AC.. So the more agility you have the less you get hit. (Does
      wonders when combined with dodging and parrying). A high agility is what
      makes a Rogue a worthwhile melee class. Another Prime Requisite for Rogues
      here.</font></p>
      <i><b>
      <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Stamina</font></b></i><font face="Verdana" size="2">
      - Stamina affects your Hit Points… as well as how tired you get while
      fighting. You might want to add a point or two here if you see yourself
      needing more hitpoints, but is totally un-needed in my opinion.</font></p>
      <i><b>
      <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Intelligence</font></b></i><font face="Verdana" size="2">
      - Intelligence, though more important for mage-type characters, is an
      important stat none the less. It affects how fast you learn skills... so
      if you envision yourself with multiple-types of weapons.. you might want
      to add a few points here. I found that an intelligence of 75 lets me learn
      quite quickly... allowing me to learn piercing, slashing, archery
      (somewhat), and un-armed combat pretty quickly without being behind in
      skill.</font></p>
      <i><b>
      <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Wisdom</font></b></i><font face="Verdana" size="2">-
      The only thing wisdom does for you is affect your resistances slightly.
      Other then that.. it doesn't really seem to affect anything else.</font></p>
      <i><b>
      <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Charisma</font></b></i><font face="Verdana" size="2">-
      Charisma might be important for you, because your going to need the edge
      you can get when dealing with NPCs. All in all everyone will hate ya...
      but a high charisma might help you get your faction up with some classes.
      If you’re a Dark-Elf good luck. =P</font></p>
     </blockquote>
     <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8"><u><i><b><font face="Verdana" size="2">&nbsp;</font></p>
     <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8"><font face="Verdana" size="2">How
     to start off...(A guide from 1-20)</font></b></i></u></p>
     <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Starting
     off is hard in any class, but luckily its nearly all the same. You just go
     out and kill things out in the newbie gardens and scrounge up some money
     for basic Equipment. Kill the local ruined-pelt giving animals
     (wolf/cats/bears) for patchwork armor and get a tailor (or be a tailor
     yourself) to make some patchwork. You also want to stick with that training
     dagger start off with and get another rusty/tarnished dagger as soon as
     possible. Though you might not always use a dagger... and prefer a spear or
     other piercing weapon.. a dagger is nice to boost your skill relatively
     quick, since you hit a monster a lot more with a dagger, which is a greater
     chance to increase skill per fight. This goes for all weapons... find the
     one with lowest delay and use that to boost skill. Also lower delay weapons
     help out on the higher-level critters in hitting em.. and I seem to do much
     better with lets say a tarnished dagger then a tarnished spear on monsters
     that con as gambles or low tombstones. Stick to the newbie gardens until at
     least level 5.. doing some exploring before then to where you'll hunt next.
     Always know your surroundings as well, it helps a lot with locating your
     bodies. At level 3 make sure you throw a point into dodging. It
     &quot;primes&quot; the skill up and it will increase by itself eventually.
     At level 5 or 6... you should be out of the newbie gardens and maybe a zone
     away or two. Around these levels... group with a cleric one or two levels
     lower then you... both you and the cleric will gain experience quickly
     killing off some of the undead around. Also practice some of your skills
     while resting and in combat... especially pick pocketing at level 7. You
     shouldn't use your practice points much unless its in a trade skill or the
     &quot;basics&quot; you MUST spend on skills to start learning them. Also a
     trade skill might pop in as well as archery/throwing... where it is wise to
     spend some points. Save some points up though... since skills later will
     need some boosting.</font></p>
     <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8"><font face="Verdana" size="2">At
     level 10... you get your most prized skill.... backstabbing. Backstabbing
     makes you a viable component in any group, which is when you should start
     considering dungeon hunting and being in groups of more then 2 people. When
     you get level 10... you might want to consider pumping in a good 15 points
     into backstabbing since its a somewhat hard skill to increase quickly. Safe
     Fall at level 12 is also a skill that tends to refuse to go up much... so
     might want to prime it up a bit. You might also be considering either
     store-bought leather.. or maybe player-made metal armor now.. if you have
     the plat for it.</font></p>
     <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8"><font face="Verdana" size="2">At
     level 13, you get parrying. This skill is a much-welcomed added defense
     which lets you get hit less by blocking an attack. Only spend a point or
     two here... it eventually goes up by itself.</font></p>
     <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Then
     comes the level 15/16 combo. Here you get Double attack and Dual wield...
     Which are just add so much to a rogue I can't put it into words. If you
     trained up something besides piercing.. such as slashing.. Have your
     Primary weapon as a piercing weapon and your secondary weapon as either
     piercing as well.. or maybe a minotaur axe or Tentacle whip (The life-tap
     abilities help a lot), whatever you want. These two skills tend to have a
     slow start... so primer them up if you have training points to spare.</font></p>
     <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8"><font face="Verdana" size="2">At
     level 18 comes another Rogue-specific skill... the Art of Poisoning. This
     skill doesn't come to play much til level 20... when you get to make your
     own poison. During the beta.. poisoning wasn't in yet (at level 10).. but
     it seems like a wonderful skill to have.</font></p>
     <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8"><font face="Verdana" size="2">At
     Level 20.. comes the ability to make your own poisons.. which will help a
     lot for that apply poison skill... as well as the last name that you can
     have bestowed upon you. Make sure you petition a GM if you want your last
     name (unless they changed that). You also get Disarm traps at level 20,
     which would be real helpful if there were many traps to disarm. The
     abilities of a rogue don't seem to come in too often.... below 20 that is.</font></p>
     <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Remember
     that speed is a much needed quality in all your weapons that you get...
     Rogues tend to to better hitting a lot then hitting for a lot, but always
     have balance between damage and weapon speed.</font><u><i><b></p>
     <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Level
     20 and beyond...</font></b></i></u></p>
     <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8"><font face="Verdana" size="2">If
     you haven't been grouping yet... I am surprised you have gotten this high.
     now its ESSENTIAL to be grouping. Use your skills to add to the groups your
     in and be a viable team member. Some skills, such as Disarm traps and such
     not seems like they would be valuable skills, but they come into play
     during the deep-dungeon expeditions. Instill Doubt is a nice welcome to
     your arsenal, causing enemies flee (and showing their backsides for a nice
     backstab). Disarm also is a nice skill.. which lets you take the weapons
     your enemy is using (adding to the coin purse a lot there). Basically, your
     abilities beyond 20 truly increase in the new toys or items you get. A
     rogue, probably as much or even more then a warrior depends on the
     equipment he has a lot... with the rogue tending to have more cash then the
     warrior to buy this equipment. The upside to this, however, is that you get
     a bunch of cool toys to play with . =P This alone makes Rogues a much more
     appealing class then their nearest coutnerpart.. the Monk.. though the Monk
     is one of the true masters of avoiding damage, Rogues come in at a close
     second but with the added fun of all the nice toys that are available
     (especially for the wood-elves... since they can wear both small and medium
     sizes and quest for a lot of stuff). Remember to make a lot of friends...
     since you need em. =P The most important thing to remember is to have fun,
     is a game after all.</font></p>

     <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8"><font face="Verdana" size="2">The
     Downsides to a Rogue</font></b></i></u></p>
     <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8"><font face="Verdana" size="2">There
     are, however, lots of downsides to a Rogue. They are hated by most every
     race, (except Halflings of course), and that makes it a challenge
     sometimes. They also don't have the nice abilities of a magic-using class
     of getting spells every 4 or 5 levels... so at higher levels Rogues might
     tend to get a little boring (unless you can keep getting better and better
     equipment). They are however more enjoyable then a Warrior.. as you can see
     with a high-level backstab skill. They are, however, limited to 1-handed
     weapons... which makes it a kind of disappointment damage wise (as you see
     all the warriors completely destroying a monster with a halberd or other
     2-handed weapon). Although we dodge melee attacks well, we take some hard
     hits from spells, making us weak to some higher level monsters (having less
     hitpoints then the other melee classes). This is where a lot of
     magic/fire/cold/poison/disease resisting magic items come to affect for the
     Rogue. Rogues also tend to be a class ignored by the programmers (their
     skills are somewhat incomplete and not very usable at times), and that
     tends to hit them hard from being truly balanced with all the other
     classes.</font></p>
     <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Your
     choice of character really is determined by how you want to play. There is
     no &quot;best&quot; class, there are no tank mages... which makes this game
     all the more enjoying. Rogues can be a worthwhile class, as all classes can
     be, and to me they are the class I would enjoy EverQuest the most as. But
     that is why you have eight slots.. To explore all the racial and career
     opportunities provided by each class.</font></p>
     <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8"><font face="Verdana" size="2">All
     in all... although Rogues seem to be more popular now we are in the
     final... many people may find themselves struggling with a Rogue... as all
     classes seem to have, which can make the game frustrating. If you choose
     the Rogue because they can pick pockets... your going to be somewhat
     disappointed with the class in the long run. If you chose a Rogue because
     all their abilities and characteristics seems like the type of character
     that you would have the most fun with, then the game will be much more
     enjoying in the long run.</font></p>
