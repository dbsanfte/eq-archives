     <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Warriors
     are the meat of any role playing game. They are a neccesity to every well
     balanced party. Warriors can dish punishment and more importantly they can
     absorb it. Warriors keep the monsters occupied while the casters launch
     away from distance. Warriors don armor, they wield the weapons, and when it
     is all said and done they often get all the credit from the onlookers.<br>
     <br>
     Many people might argue that warriors are not an incredibly interesting
     class to play. Casters gain a whole new set of spells every 4-5 levels.
     Warriors only have a few interesting skills and they are few and far
     between. However the flip side of the coin is that warriors are the ones
     who are in the thick of things. When the casters have their noses in the
     spellbooks meditating for the next heal or for the death blow, the warriors
     will be battling on.<br>
     <br>
     While casting types await to get new spells and other meelee types await
     for new special skills the warrior really lives from item to item. A
     warriors livelihood lies in his equipment. The advantage of this is that a
     warrior can concentrate purely on equipment and does not have to worry
     about spells and the like. It is important to always have the best
     equipment possible at your level because this equipment can and will mean
     the difference between life and death.<br>
     <br>
     Traditionally warriors are the leaders of a group. They are the ones who
     brave the foes first. They are the first ones who take the damage, and
     often they are the first to die. A warrior must have faith in his party
     members. A warrior needs to have the courage to stand and fight until his
     healers get enough mana to throw him a heal. A warrior must have the heart
     to stand in there while the wizards get the mana to deal the death blow. As
     a result of this a warrior is often the one who makes an impression on a
     crowd of onlookers. I recall a time when myself, Hafez and Grog were
     battling with Hill Giants in the Oasis of Marr. Hafez and myself were
     keeping Grog(our fearless warrior) healed long enough for him to defeat the
     mighty beast. At the end of each battle the crowds would shout and cheer,
     &quot;Grog just killed another hill giant! All hail Grog&quot;. Such is the
     life of the warrior, remembered not only for his fearless deeds but also
     for his flashy and brilliant equipment which often outshines all other
     classes.<br>
     <br>
     So what does a warrior have to look forward to skill wise?<br>
     <br>
     At level 5 warriors gain the ability to bind wounds. This skill allows you
     to use bandages to help yourself heal faster when critically wounded. This
     skill fails a lot early on and requires bandages. To be quite frank with
     you most players never use this skill they instead rely on party healers or
     <a href="file:///E:/gameznet/eq/class/warrior.html/../equipment/barkpotion.html">bark
     potions</a>. However at higher levels if you have money to waste you might
     want to invest it into bandages and bind wounds. This skill can heal up to
     22 points at a time when maxed and can be used to heal you to up to 50% of
     your health.<br>
     <br>
     At level 6 you gain the ability to dodge. This is a very important skill.
     Dodging causes your opponent to miss and thus raises your armor class.
     Seeing that you will be tanking most of the time every little addition to
     your armor class helps.<br>
     <br>
     At level 9 you gain the bash skill. Bash gives you an alternative to kick
     and requires a shield. Bashing generally does less damage than kicking it
     does however have a chance to stun your opponent. This is important when
     your prey attempts to flee. It is also important when doing battle with
     spellcasters and a bash will interupt their spell. Large races gain the
     ability to slam which is identical to bash except that it does not require
     a shield.<br>
     <br>
     At level 12 you gain the parry skill. Parry is similar to dodge in that it
     causes your opponent to miss and thus raises your armor class.<br>
     <br>
     Level 13 and 15 are the warriors power levels. At level 13/15 you get your
     two most important skills: Double attack and duel wield. Level 13 gives
     dual wield and level 15 double attack. It is wise to save up most of your
     training points to pour into these two stats. Double attack allows you to
     hit twice per round. Duel wield allows you to have the option of using two
     one handed weapons and thus theoretically be able to get up to four attacks
     per round. These skills go up slowly and are not overly effective at first,
     but once they start gaining in skill you will notice a huge difference in
     effectiveness.<br>
     <br>
     At level 25 you gain the riposte skill. This is basically another armor
     class increasing skill.<br>
     <br>
     At level 35 you gain the last of your skills: Disarm. Disarm allows you to
     knock a weapon out of your opponents hands(although it very rarely works).
     This can accomplish two things. First off it can get you a nice weapon if
     you are lucky. Secondly a monster with a weapon hits quite a bit harder
     than a monster without one.<br>
     <br>
     Most races are allowed to be warriors. The exceptions are the high elves
     and erudites who simply do not have it in their nature to shed blood in
     this manner. The three races best suited to be a warrior are the <a href="file:///E:/gameznet/eq/class/warrior.html/../race/barbarian.html">barbarians</a>,
     <a href="file:///E:/gameznet/eq/class/warrior.html/../race/troll.html">trolls</a>,
     and <a href="file:///E:/gameznet/eq/class/warrior.html/../race/ogre.html">ogres</a>.
     Notice that all three races are of the large variety. This is not only
     because of stats but due to the fact that large races get the racial
     ability to slam which allows them to bash(stun attack) without a shield and
     also allows them to do so while using both duel wield and double attack.<br>
     <br>
     Barbarians are probably the weakest stat wise of the three and they also
     lack infravision. However barbarians are the only of the big three that is
     widely accepted throughout Norrath. Barbarians also have the extra perk of
     being able to wear both human and large sized armor(human sized armor is
     cheaper).<br>
     <br>
     Ogre's are probably the best pick stat wise. You will probably want to pour
     a lot of points into agility but otherwise they are set. Ogre's have
     extremely high strength and stamina which are prime traits for a warrior.
     The weaknesses of ogre's are that they are evil and their low intelligence
     will result in your skills raising slowly.<br>
     <br>
     Trolls have stats that lie somewhere between a barbarian and an ogre. The
     advantage of a troll however is in his natural regeneration. This is an
     important ability for a warrior as regeneration means less downtime when
     you are soloing.<br>
     <br>
     Thus far we have discussed the strengths of a warrior and how well he fits
     in a party. Now we will cover the weaknesses of a warrior and why he does
     not make a great solo character at later levels(20+).<br>
     <br>
     Warriors do not make great solo players for several reasons. The first one
     to become obvious is the fact that monsters run. At the first couple levels
     you will be able to finish these runners off in a swing or two and it will
     not be that big of a deal. As the monsters get tougher however they will
     require quite a few hits to finish. In a dungeon environment this is
     especially deadly because they will lead you into tougher monsters as you
     chase behind them trying to finish them off. In a party you will usually
     have casters who can root the monster or finish it off with a direct damage
     spell.<br>
     <br>
     The second weakness that becomes apparent around level 5 is that warriors
     heal slowly. Warriors have more hit points than any other class yet they
     heal at the same rate. At higher levels you can expect to rest for up to 20
     minutes if you are fully damaged. You can invest in bark potions or quest
     for a <a href="file:///E:/gameznet/eq/class/warrior.html/../quest/squadring.html">Squad
     Ring</a>(unless you are an evil race) but these can be expensive or hard to
     achieve. This factor probably more than anything else will lead a warrior
     to team with some sort of healer.<br>
     <br>
     The third weakness with a warrior is the amount of time it takes him to
     kill monsters at higher levels. A properly equipped warrior may be able to
     kill the same monsters as a casting class of the same level but it will
     usually take the warrior much longer. This is to be expected. We hit for
     less damage and can absorb much more. However in the amount of time it
     takes you to finish off your opponent the chance continues to grow that
     another monster will respawn or walk accross your path thus spoiling your
     fun and possibly forcing you to run. This can be quite frustrating to fight
     a monster for a couple minutes only to be forced to run empty handed and
     then rest for 10-15 minutes as a result of it.<br>
     <br>
     The fourth glaring weakness of a warrior is the lack of his ability to cure
     himself of diseases and poisons. This becomes evident as you begin to gain
     levels and more or less makes entire dungeons(such as <a href="file:///E:/gameznet/eq/class/warrior.html/../zone/befallen.html">Befallen</a>)
     completely impossible for a warrior to solo in. Some diseases can last for
     hours and in the meantime you will be unable to heal(or even worse you will
     be losing hit points) until some nice cleric comes along and cures your
     disease.<br>
     <br>
     Thankfully there are items that can cure some of the warriors deficiencies
     allowing him to do some more interesting things. An example would be
     healing potions, potions of gate, cure potions, <a href="file:///E:/gameznet/eq/class/warrior.html/../equipment/journeymanboots.html">journeyman
     boots</a>, etc. However these will never hide the fact that a warrior is
     designed for a group. A warrior should be a leader and will find it hard to
     branch off on his own. In a group however you will be very happy. Warriors
     are in the thick of things more than any other class in a group and you
     have others to make up for all of your shortcomings.<br>
     <br>
     In the end warriors are a perfect class for a certain style of play. They
     are not a class that is well suited for solo play and if that sort of thing
     is your bag you might want to try a <a href="file:///E:/gameznet/eq/class/warrior.html/druid.html">druid</a>,
     <a href="file:///E:/gameznet/eq/class/warrior.html/magician.html">magician</a>,
     or a <a href="file:///E:/gameznet/eq/class/warrior.html/necromancer.html">necromancer</a>.
     However if your idea of a good time is to be a good team member and to put
     your life in the hands of others and trust them to keep you alive then a
     warrior is an exciting and a very fun class to play.<br>
