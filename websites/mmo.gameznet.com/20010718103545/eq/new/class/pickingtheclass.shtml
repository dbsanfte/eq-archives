            One of the things that is great about a class based game is that
            each class has it's own strengths that make people want to play that
            class. On the flip side of that every class also has it's
            disadvantages which will make you wish it could do x like class y.
            The strengths and weaknesses of each class are the very factors
            which insure that teamwork and grouping in the game will become
            neccessary to conquer the epic monsters in the game.<br>
            <br>
            That having been said each class has it's own strengths and
            weaknesses that will be addressed here and we will try to address
            what you can expect from all of the classes at higher levels. In the
            end we are hoping that you will have enough information to choose
            the right class for you from the get go.
            <p align="center" style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8"><font face="Arial" size="4" color="#DDDD00">Class
            Categories</font></p>
            <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8">There are four distinct types of classes in Everquest. It's a
            little more complex than that as some classes borderline on one
            another such as druids and bards but in general every class falls
            into one of the four categories:<br>
            <br>
            1) Melee classes are the bread and butter of the game. Warriors,
            monks and rogues are melee classes. These classes are designed to
            hack and slash. Monks and rogues have some extra abilities which
            keep them more interesting than the warrior class however they
            suffer from fewer hit points and items.<br>
            <br>
            2) Priest classes include clerics, shamans and druids. These are the
            healers in the game. These classes can make other classes stronger
            with their healing and buffing spells. Each has it's own other
            advantages and weaknesses which we will cover below. They have
            harsher item restrictions than pure melee classes but a much wider
            range of items than mage classes.<br>
            <br>
            3) Mage classes include wizards, enchanters, necromancers and
            magicians. These classes can use very few types of armor and even
            fewer weapons. They are very weakest classes in melee combat and
            also have the fewest hit points. They make up for it with the most
            powerful spells in the game.<br>
            <br>
            4) The last category is the hybrid classes. These include rangers,
            paladins, shadowknights and bards. These classes are a mix of other
            class types. All hybrid classes can melee well and can cast spells
            to boot. The problem with this type of character is that they level
            much slower than other classes and that they are not as good as any
            of their parts. For example a ranger is half druid and half warrior.
            He will never be able to fight as well as a warrior and he will
            never be able to cast as well as a druid. What he is however is a
            fine mix of the two class types. The druid class could also be
            considered hybrids in a sense. Druids are part ranger, part cleric
            and part wizard in many players eyes. However they do not suffer a
            hyrbid experience penalty.<br>
            <br>
            What I am going to attempt to describe below is a comparison of all
            of the classes in the game by category of what they can do and what
            they can use. Depending on your personal style of play you should be
            able to get an idea of what classes you should be narrowing your
            decision down to.</p>
            <p align="center" style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8"><font face="Arial" size="4" color="#DDDD00">Armor</font></p>
            <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8">First and foremost we will discuss items beginning with armor.
            There are many different types of armor in the game and not all
            classes can wear all types. Warriors, paladins, shadowknights,
            clerics and bards can wear the widest variety of armor. They can
            start with cloth armor and move all the way up to magical platemail.
            The only armor they cannot wear is pure mage armor such as damask
            and gossmer.<br>
            <br>
            Rangers, rogues and shamans are next in line when it comes to armor
            selection. They can use cloth, leather and chainmail types which
            will be readily apparent from the beginning. What many players do
            not realize is that they can also use high level platemail types of
            armor such as rubicite and green splinted platemail. They cannot
            wear store bought or bronze platemail.<br>
            <br>
            The next in line of armor selection is the druid and monk classes.
            They can only wear leather type armor. This includes several types
            of magical armor such as bone, spiked and snakeskin armor. These
            classes can not use high level magical chainmail or platemail which
            will become an apparent weakness at higher levels. In defense of
            monks however they are the best dodging class in the game which will
            prevent them from taking as many blows as other melee classes. It
            should be noted that at higher monks can wear some high level
            magical platemail(such as green splinted plate) but you will not
            receive this armor until you are of very high level.</p>
            <p align="center" style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8"><font face="Arial" size="4" color="#DDDD00">Weapons</font></p>
            <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8">Now that we have covered armor we should discuss weapons. One
            thing that should be noted is that each different class has it's own
            type of special weapons. For example paladins have access to the
            holy swords such as Ghoulbane which will dish great damage
            especially to undead. Rangers will gain high powered one handed
            weapons that will cast ensaring roots randomly on successful hits.
            We will not be covering all of these weapons here except to say that
            each class get a fair shake. Paladins have the most powerful of the
            special weapons which will help them make up for the lack of duel
            wield and kick/slam.<br>
            <br>
            Warriors, shadowknights, rangers and paladins have the largest
            selection of weapons. They can use basically any weapon they can
            find including 1h/2h blunt and slashing weapons as well as piercing
            weapons. Paladins however can not use the archery skill as it is
            beneath them to wage warfare from distance.<br>
            <br>
            Rogues can use any one handed weapon but excel in the use of
            piercing weapons. They also are somewhat limited in what weapons
            they can duel wield because of the need of a piercing weapon for
            backstab.<br>
            <br>
            Bards can use most weapons in the game and can train in all of the
            different melee weapon skills. However I have yet to find many 2
            handed weapons which are actually wieldable by the class.
            Considering that they get duel wield and not double attack it would
            probably be foolish to equip a 2 handed weapon anyway.<br>
            <br>
            Druids are next in line but not by much. Druids can use 1h/2h blunt
            and also can wield scimitars which no other priest class can. At
            first this does not seem like a big deal and many young druids
            choose to go the 2h blunt route. However the druids special weapon
            is an oaken scimitar and there are also other mid level weapons such
            as the silverish scimitar which are fine weapons(7/28). By choosing
            to use a scimitar a druid can also use a shield or magical shield to
            help their armor class and perhaps get some magical bonuses.<br>
            <br>
            Clerics and shamans encompass the next tier. They are allowed to use
            both 1h/2h blunt weapons only.<br>
            <br>
            Last but not least are the mage types which can use very few
            weapons. They can use staffs, daggers, giant snake fangs, and a few
            throwing weapons.</p>
            <p align="center" style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8"><font face="Arial" size="4" color="#DDDD00">Hit
            Points</font></p>
            <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8">Next in the scheme of things we will cover hit points. Warriors
            have by the largest amount of hit points per level. Not far behind
            them are monks, shadowknights and paladins, following them are
            rangers, bards and rogues. After which will come priest classes and
            finally mage types.</p>
            <p align="center" style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8"><font face="Arial" size="4" color="#DDDD00">Melee
            Combat</font></p>
            <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8">Next we will attempt to cover melee combat. melee combat is the
            meat and drink of the game. melee combat encompasses any time you
            stand and fight an opponent at close range with weapons. It is
            neccessary not only to dish out damage to your enemies but it also
            allows your &quot;tanks&quot;(melee classes) to keep a monster
            occupied while your spellcasters can get off their spells from
            distance.<br>
            <br>
            On the issue of melee we can split things up right off the bat by
            the category your class falls under. melee and hybrid classes get 5
            skill points * (level+1) for their various melee skills. This means
            that at level 1 you can raise any of your melee skills(say 1h slash
            for example purposes) to 10. Priest classes only gain 4 skill points
            * (level+1) meaning their skills would max at 8. Mage types only
            gain 3 skill points * (level+1) meaning it would max at 6. This will
            become more and more apparent as the levels add up.<br>
            <br>
            More importantly however priest and mage classes never get an extra
            attack. Shamans are the exception because of their races innate
            ability to slam. However it will only slam for 1 point of damage.
            While this may be a nice addition at level 1-10 it will be more or
            less useless beyond that point. Anyone who is under the impression
            that they should choose a priest class because they can melee as
            well as cast spells should get this out of their mind right here and
            right now. Your extra hit points and armor may keep you alive longer
            if a monster turns on you but it will not allow you to melee a
            monster after level 15 or so.<br>
            <br>
            Having covered that we will go into the extra attacks and skills of
            the various melee classes. Warriors get the most extra attacks.
            Warriors get both duel wield and double attack at level 15. They
            also get all of the defensive melee skills earlier than any of the
            other classes(these include dodge, parry and riposte). Warriors also
            can bash though a shield is required for non-large races(large races
            can slam without a shield). Bash allows you to not only dish damage
            but also stun your opponent. Warriors also can kick which will not
            stun but generally does a bit more damage than bash. Warriors also
            get the disarm attack at level 35.<br>
            <br>
            One can argue that monks are actually the best melee class damage
            wise and it would be hard to argue against them. Although monks do
            not get the toys of a high level warrior they also do not have to
            depend on them. Monks hands and feet can attack for a large amount
            of damage as well as being able to disarm their opponents earlier
            than a warrior. They are also lightning quick and magical in nature
            at early levels(all special monk attacks are magical but you will
            need magical gloves such as netted/woven which are available at
            EARLY levels to punch). Monks are the best duel wielders in the game
            though you will probably never want to actually use a weapon as your
            hands do more damage in a quicker amount of time. What evens them
            out melee wise is that they cannot wear much armor(and must depend
            on dodge/block) and that every time they gain a new and improved
            special attack the skill starts off low and will take some time to
            train it to a reasonable level.<br>
            <br>
            Paladins and shadowknights get most of the skills of a warrior they
            simply get them at later levels. Noticeably missing is kick and duel
            wield. Rather than being able to kick paladins/shadowknights will
            have to rely on bash. This is not a big deal to a shadowknight who
            will likely be an ogre or troll and will be able to slam and use a
            two handed weapon. It is a big deal for a paladin however whose
            special weapons are one handed and will need to rely on a shield in
            order to bash.<br>
            <br>
            Rangers get most of the abilities of a warrior just a bit later.
            Noticeably absent is the bash skill and the fact that you will not
            gain double attack until level 20(though you do get duel wield at
            15).<br>
            <br>
            Rogues are next in line and are the true wild card melee wise. They
            have most of the skills of a warrior. They even get some of the
            skills before a warrior(such as disarm). Rogues will not be able to
            duel wield as large a variety of weapons as a warrior or a ranger
            however. The trump card of a rogue however is the backstab skill.
            Backstab may not be very useful when soloing but it is a great extra
            attack in a group. Not only can it act as an instant taunt to get
            the monster off of your comrades but it will also do a ton of damage
            if succesful. It is the highest damage extra attack in the
            game(edging out the flying kick of the monks).<br>
            <br>
            Lastly we will cover bards. Bards are the weakest of the hybrid
            classes when it comes to melee. Bards do not get kick or bash. They
            do gain duel wield but do not gain double attack. They also do not
            gain parry, riposte, or disarm.</p>
            <p align="center" style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8"><font face="Arial" size="4" color="#DDDD00">Healing</font></p>
            <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8">Healing is one of the most important abilities in the game.
            Healing allows you to not only reduce downtime but also to increase
            your efficiency in a battle. Healers can double, triple even
            quadruple and more the amount of damage a player can take during the
            course of a battle. This is very important at higher levels when
            monsters hit extremely hard and have an insane number of hit points.<br>
            <br>
            When it comes to healing clerics are first and foremost number one.
            Not only are their healing spells efficient than the same spell when
            cast by another class type but they also have the two most powerful
            healing spells in the game exclusively. These being superior
            heal(which heals roughly 650 hit points) and complete heal(which
            will completely heal any player). You will not get these spells
            until level 34 and 39 respectively but they are incredibly
            useful(though they may not be the most mana efficient way to do
            things when you first get them depending on who is your tank).
            Clerics also get group heal spells which aren't very useful in most
            situations but can be useful when fighting monsters who cast area
            effect spells.<br>
            <br>
            Next in line would have to be druids and shamans who gain all the
            way up to the greater heal spell(at level 29). While their greater
            heal is not as mana efficient as a clerics it still is very useful
            and will allow them to fill in as a cleric in many groups if a
            cleric is not available. Another very useful spell is regeneration
            and pack regeneration(which is a group regeneration).<br>
            <br>
            The next class would have to be a paladin. Not only do paladins have
            the ability to lay hands(which heals nearly 1000 even at level 1)
            once per game day but they also gain all the way up to the greater
            heal spell(at level 49). The problem is that they get their heal
            spells later than druids and shamans and also have much less mana
            and fizzle considerably more.<br>
            <br>
            A good distance behind paladins are rangers. Rangers never can cast
            beyond the heal spell(which they gain at level 39) and generally are
            not all that useful healing wise during the middle of a fight. They
            can be quite useful however in reducing downtime.<br>
            <br>
            Bards should be mentioned in the same breath as rangers. Bards
            healing is more of a regeneration spell. It is not incredibly useful
            in fight but it is great when resting to reduce downtime and will
            save the other healers in the group from having to waste their mana.<br>
            <br>
            Way in the back of the pack are the necromancers and even further
            back the shadowknights. Their spells can be very useful when soloing
            as they are lifetap style spells which not only heal the caster but
            damage the target. The only heal spell which they can cast on
            others(besides their pets) is the dark empathy spell which will heal
            your target but will damage yourself.</p>
            <p align="center" style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8"><font face="Arial" size="4" color="#DDDD00">Buffing
            Spells</font></p>
            <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8">Buffing spells are an important part of the game. Buffing spells
            last for a pretty long period of time and can add to a players armor
            class and hit points. It is important to note that all mage types
            also receive buffing spells however their buffs can only be cast on
            themselves and will not be discussed other than to mention that they
            do exist(in the form of shielding spells).<br>
            <br>
            Clerics are the kings of buffs. They have three(and in essence four
            with the guard spell) lines of spells. One is the courage line of
            spells which adds considerable armor and hit points. The second is
            the holy armor line of spells which adds armor class. Third is the
            symbol line of spells which adds hit points but requires a material
            component.<br>
            <br>
            Shamans and druids also get their own buffing spells which can
            compete with the clerics somewhat but are not as mana efficient.
            They also only have two different lines of buffing spells rather
            than the three(or four) that a cleric posesses. Druids second line
            of spells is an armor class and thorn spell which can only be cast
            on themselves.<br>
            <br>
            Paladins follow the mix with their ability to cast all three of the
            cleric lines of buffing spells. The weakness is that they gain the
            spells much later than clerics and have less mana to cast them with.
            They are not incredibly useful if there is a cleric, shaman or druid
            in the group but can be great if there is not or if you are soloing.<br>
            <br>
            Enchanters can buff with the haze line of buffing spells. These
            spells are not as powerful as those of priest types but they are
            great if there is no other buffer around.<br>
            <br>
            Rangers can cast druid buffing spells although as with paladins they
            get the spells quite late.<br>
            <br>
            Last but not least is the necromancer. This might be surprising to
            some but necromancers can cast spirit armor which is the level 19
            cleric armor class buffing spell and they get it at a very early
            level 20.</p>
            <p align="center" style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8"><font face="Arial" size="4" color="#DDDD00">Stat
            Increasing Spells</font></p>
            <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8">Stat increasing spells allow you to enhance some of your ability
            scores such as strength, intelligence etc. These spells can be quite
            useful if used in the proper situations.<br>
            <br>
            Bards have the ability to boost certain stats for their entire party
            at once which makes them a contender in this category. The problem
            is that bards can only sing one song at a time(though they can cycle
            between the one they sing fast enough to keep a couple effects going
            on at once) and they will often be better suited to sing other songs
            in a group.<br>
            <br>
            Shamans are the kind of stat increasing spells. They can increase
            every statistic a player has with the exception of intelligence and
            wisdom. It was deemed that intelligence and wisdom boosting spells
            could toy with the mana balance in the game and they were left out.
            Not only can shamans increase other players ability scores but they
            can do so at early levels which makes them a desired member in a
            party.<br>
            <br>
            Clerics, druids and enchanters can enhance a players stats but they
            are way behind a shaman. Generally they can only increase a small
            number of stats usually strength. All of these spells are different.
            Enchanters probably are the most useful being able to not only
            increase a players strength but also render him invulnerable at the
            same time.<br>
            <br>
            Enchanters have several stat increasing spells such as berserker
            strength which not only grants strength(in exchange for agility) but
            also makes a player invulnerable for a brief period of time.<br>
            <br>
            Necromancers can also cast a strengthen spell on other players and
            both necros shadowknights can cast siphon strength which not only
            strengthens themselves but weakens their target. Rangers get feet
            like cat at level 15 which will increase the agility score and
            strength of earth at level 30 which will increase strength which
            grants them a bit of added usefulness.</p>
            <p align="center" style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8"><font face="Arial" size="4" color="#DDDD00">Damage
            Shields</font></p>
            <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8">Damage shields can be a quite useful bonus in Everquest. These
            spells will do damage to any monster that damages the you. Generally
            the monster will hit you for quite a bit more than the damage shield
            will hit back but it adds up. The weakness of these spells is the
            generally short duration. Rangers and druids get a special line of
            damage shields which add armor class and do a very minor amount of
            damage which have a long duration. Problem with that line of ranger
            and druid spells is they can only be cast on yourself.<br>
            <br>
            Druids and magicians are the kings of damage shields. Their damage
            shields can be cast on others and do a pretty good amount of damage.
            They can also be stacked which allows you to add them all up to do
            extra damage to a beast.<br>
            <br>
            Rangers can also cast damage shields though they get them much later
            than their druid counterparts. A side note is that a rangers damage
            shields are much more useful when cast on themselves than a druid
            casting them on himself. This is because rangers can absorb more
            punishment and wear better armor than a druid thus allowing them to
            fight longer and do more damage.<br>
            <br>
            Necromancers and shadowknights(though much later) can also cast
            damage shields but they can only be cast on their person.</p>
            <p align="center" style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8"><font face="Arial" size="4" color="#DDDD00">Damage
            Absorbing Spells</font></p>
            <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8">Damage absorbing spells are a different twist. These spells will
            absorb a certain amount of damage rendering the caster invulnerable.
            The problem is that these spells generally can only be cast on
            yourself. All pure mage types get damage absorbing spells(in the
            form of leatherskin style spells) but with the exception of the
            enchanter they are self use only.<br>
            <br>
            Enchanters are thus the kings of damage absorbing spells. Beginning
            with the level 16 Rune I spells and growing from there(next in line
            is the level 24 Rune II spell). The problem with these spells are
            that they require a component and can thus get expensive if you use
            them often. I recall a time when Talyanya the high enchantress blew
            somewhere near 50pp in one night of adventure in lower guk.<br>
            <br>
            The only other class that can cast a damage absorbing spell on
            others is the cleric class and they don't receive it until level 49.
            In actuality the word of divine spell is not a damage absorbing
            spell(which absorbs x amount of damage and then expires) it is an
            invulnerability spell which renders every member of the party
            invulnerable for a short period of time and can only be cast once
            per 15 minutes.<br>
            <br>
            Necros, wizards and magicians can cast damage absorbing shields but
            they can only cast these spells on themselves.</p>
            <p align="center" style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8"><font face="Arial" size="4" color="#DDDD00">Direct
            Damage Spells</font></p>
            <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8">Direct damage spells do direct damage to one target. They are the
            bread and butter of offensive spells for most classes. There are
            also direct damage spells which only affect certain monsters(such as
            undead) which will be discussed in the next chapter.<br>
            <br>
            Wizards are the kings of direct damage though this will not become
            readily apparent until higher levels. At early levels wizard damage
            spells are similar to all other mage types and also druids. This
            discourages many a young wizard into abandoning the class. However
            wizards don't begin to peak until level 20 when they receive Force
            Shock the first of their high powered direct damage spells. Things
            only get better from there and at level 50 you will be dishing out
            well over 1000 points of damage with your DD spells.<br>
            <br>
            Druids and magicians are next in line when it comes to dishing out
            direct damage. Magicians spells generally do a bit more damage while
            druid spells are more mana efficient. However the edge here might
            have to go to magicians when you consider that most magicians will
            have a higher intelligence than druids will have wisdom thus
            equaling more mana.<br>
            <br>
            Shamans and enchanters can also dish direct damage though they are
            quite a ways behind druids and magicians in most instances. There
            are periods of time during certain levels(for example between level
            34-39) when a shaman can outdamage the aforementioned druids and
            magicians when those classes are waiting for their next spell in
            line. Shamans generally are more DD efficient than enchanters.<br>
            <br>
            Clerics are the weakest direct damage class in the game. An argument
            can definately be made that their efficiency with special case
            monsters(see below) can make up for this somewhat. However cleric
            spells are usually high damage high mana consumption spells with a
            poor dmg:mana ratio.</p>
            <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8">Bards can dish direct damage though they really never will. It
            can be useful when soloing as an additional attack but bards should
            rarely be soloing and in a group their songs are better used for
            other purposes.<br>
            <br>
            Rangers can also cast direct damage spells though they are casting
            old spells and have low mana and their mana should be saved for
            healing, buffing and damage shields.</p>
            <p align="center" style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8"><font face="Arial" size="4" color="#DDDD00">Direct
            Damage - Special Monsters</font></p>
            <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8">This category of spells encompasses being able to cast DD spells
            on special case monsters. These fall into two categories undead and
            summoned. Undead requires no explanation summoned however might.
            Summoned monsters include elements and are much less common than
            undead though in the elemental planes they will be plentiful.</p>
            <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8">Clerics reign supreme when it comes to direct damage attacks on
            special foes because they can damage both types. Clerics mana:dmg
            efficiency on undead beasts is matched only by high level wizards.
            Wizard spells do have a shorter recast time and more mana than a
            cleric allowing them to actually outdamage a cleric in most
            circumstances post level 24 however clerics will maintain an edge
            over other classes. Clerics also get the ward summoned line of
            spells starting at level 19 and culminating with the level 49 expel
            summoned. While druids still mantain an edge over them versus
            summoned opponents it keeps clerics competitive with other classes
            versus these beasts.<br>
            <br>
            Druids have to rank second because of their ability to cast spells
            versus summoned foes. They are the only class which can cast banish
            summoned.<br>
            <br>
            It can be argued that necromancers should actually rank above druids
            in this field but I will stick with druids. Necromancers get all of
            the undead DD spells that a cleric receives but they get them one
            circle later. The argument could be made this is more useful than a
            druid because undead are more plentiful. However at higher levels if
            a druid wanted to stick to summoned beasts he could move to an
            elemental plane.<br>
            <br>
            Magicians also gain spells versus summoned foes though they
            generally get them very late. They do not receive ward summoned
            until level 16 where a druid gains the spell at level 5.<br>
            <br>
            Each of the hyrbids can cast special damage spells. Hyrbid special
            DD spells are received a bit later than a true caster but are still
            quite useful(especially for fetching or finishing runners). Both
            paladins and shadowknights receive spells versus undead all the way
            up to the level 49 dismiss. Paladins generally get them one circle
            earlier however. Rangers have spells verus summoned but they only
            have two ward and then dismiss. They get dismiss at level 39 which
            is 10 levels earlier than the paladin or SK special DD spells.
            However they miss out on the expulse variant of the spell which
            might hurt them in middle levels. It probably will not however as
            there are not many level 25-39 elements running around.</p>
            <p align="center" style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8"><font face="Arial" size="4" color="#DDDD00">Damage
            Over Time</font></p>
            <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8">Damage over time spells often have a very efficient damage:mana
            ratio but it will take time to kick in. These spells generally do x
            amout of damage per round(6 seconds). The problem is that it will
            take a couple of minutes to get the full damage out of the spell.
            This is the bread and butter of necromancer damage spells.<br>
            <br>
            Necromancers are the masters of DoT spells. They receive a couple of
            different lines of DoT spells which can be stacked with one another
            and they receive both of them by level 12. These being the clinging
            darkness line of spells and the heat blood line of spells. When
            stacked together you will be doing a lot of damage every round while
            your pet tanks the mob. You can also stack the disease cloud spells
            with these for even more damage(though not much more).<br>
            <br>
            Shamans and druids also receive DoT spells though they are not as
            effective as a necromancers. However these classes can cast spirit
            of the wolf and when combining SoTW and DoT you can take down
            monsters with little effort or danger(though it may be quite boring
            and is considered cheesy).<br>
            <br>
            Enchanters also receive DoT spells beginning at level 1 with the
            choke spell. They are the enchanters most effective offensive spells
            for efficiency.<br>
            <br>
            Shadowknights and rangers also receive DoT spells. Rangers only
            receive one the level 30 stinging swarm which druids receive at
            level 14. Shadowknights however get several different spells which
            can be stacked. At level 9 they receive disease cloud(not all that
            useful but it helps). They receive the clinging-&gt;engulfing
            darkness spells at level 15/22 respectively. However things don't
            really get rolling until heat blood at level 30 which can be stacked
            with engulfing darkness to maximize damage. Shadowknights receive
            their final DoT spell with the level 39 heart flutter(which also
            reduces strength and armor class).</p>
            <p align="center" style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8"><font face="Arial" size="4" color="#DDDD00">Area
            Effect Damage Spells</font></p>
            <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8">Area effect damage spells can be useful when fighting several
            foes at a time. An area effect spell can damage several opponents at
            once. There are three types of AE spells. First is the personal
            based area affect spell(PBAE) which centers around the caster. This
            can be useful for clerics and shadowknights as they might be able to
            absorb the damage of the beasts around them(and it acts as an AE
            taunt spell). The second is area effect target spells which will do
            damage to everything around the target including the caster. The
            last is the rain spells. These spells do three rounds of damage and
            should be cast on your tank. It will damage all of the monsters
            surrounding him but will also make them really want to kill you if
            you aren't careful.<br>
            <br>
            Wizards are the kings of area effect spells. Not only do they
            sport(and also PBAE spells though I don't suggest using them) the
            most damage:mana efficient rain spells but they also come in several
            flavors. Do not underestimate the effectiveness of fire/cold/magic
            based attacks which can do a good amount of damage to different
            types of monsters. For example you aren't going to do much damage to
            a fire element with a fire based attack.<br>
            <br>
            Magicians can also cast some quite good area effect spells. They
            have both PBAE and rain spells which come in several varieties of
            damage types. They are probably second to wizards in this area.<br>
            <br>
            Druids excel at outdoor area effect spells. They can cast both the
            tremor-&gt;earthquake line of spells which are person based and can
            damage a very wide area(though aren't very mana efficent) as well as
            the lightning based area effect spells which center around the
            target. The weakness of druids area effect spells is that they are
            outdoor specific.<br>
            <br>
            Necromancers and clerics can cast person based AE spells from the
            word of pain-&gt;shadow line of spells. These spells will damage
            everything around you and have a decent ratio(though not enough to
            kill a blue at higher levels alone) but will turn all of the
            monsters targetted against you which may not be a good idea
            especially if you are a necromancer. This can be quite useful
            however if you have 2 clerics or necros both casting these spells as
            you will be able to eliminate several foes at once.<br>
            <br>
            Rangers get the druids lightning based attacks though much later.
            They have the same advantages and disadvantages of the druids AE
            spells however having less mana they are more of a parlor trick than
            anything else.<br>
            <br>
            Bards also get area effect damage spells though you will rarely use
            them beyond the early levels.<br>
            <br>
            Last and least are the shadowknights. At level 49 they receive word
            of shadow a level 19 cleric and level 20 necromancer spell. It is a
            PBAE and the damage is not a whole lot at this level. It can be
            useful for taunting monsters however and is the only spell which
            shadowknights ever get that can do direct damage(even if it is area
            effect direct damage) to non-undead enemies.</p>
            <p align="center" style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8"><font face="Arial" size="4" color="#DDDD00">Teleport
            Spells</font></p>
            <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8">Teleportation spells can drastically reduce a players travel
            time. All pure casters(priest and mage types) can both bind affinity
            and cast gate. The combination of these two allow you to change
            where you will spawn after you die and then gate back to that point.
            Wizards and druids get extra travel spells which allow them to
            teleport themselves or their entire party to one of a number of
            locations.<br>
            <br>
            Wizards are the masters of this arena. Wizard teleport locations are
            generally safer than druids which can teleport you into the middle
            of trouble from time to time. Wizards are also able to teleport into
            the alternate planes of existance and are the only class which is
            able to do so.</p>
            <p align="center" style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8"><font face="Arial" size="4" color="#DDDD00">Charm
            Spells</font></p>
            <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8">Charm spells allow you to charm another being and use them as a
            pet. Charm spells can be quite unpredictable as animals will not
            like you trying to charm them if you fail and the unpredictable
            duration is further complicated by these animals breaking charm and
            attacking you.<br>
            <br>
            Enchanters as you might suspect are the lords of this domain. They
            are the only class which can charm a wide variety of monsters.<br>
            <br>
            Druids can charm animals and force them to server as pets. The
            problem is that there aren't many level 30+ animals to be charmed
            with the exception of griffons and there are not many animals in
            indoor zones(save the wolves at permafrost).<br>
            <br>
            Necromancers can charm undead and force them to serve their will.</p>
            <p align="center" style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8"><font face="Arial" size="4" color="#DDDD00">Summoning
            Spells</font></p>
            <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8">Summoning spells are defined here as any spell which summons a
            pet to server your will. We are not including summoning food/drink
            or weapons in this category.<br>
            <br>
            Magicians are arguably the best in this field. While necromancers
            can also summon pets of equal strength magicians have a choice of
            several different types of pets(water, earth, fire and air) which
            each has it's own unique advantages and disadvantages.<br>
            <br>
            Necromancers and shadowknights can summon undead skeletons to do
            their dirty work for them. Necromancers are much more useful in this
            field as their pets are much tougher than their shadowknight
            brothers. Shadowknight pets however are simply an added extra for an
            already potent class where necromancers require their pets to allow
            them to get off their DoT spells and for their DoT spells to take
            full effect.<br>
            <br>
            Enchanters can create illusionary pets with the Pendril's Animation
            line of spells. Enchanter pets are not as effective as a magicians
            or a necromancers but they add on to the class and are a welcome
            addition.</p>
            <p align="center" style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8"><font face="Arial" size="4" color="#DDDD00">Utility
            Spells</font></p>
            <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8">For the sake of this editorial we will consider utility spells to
            be anything that is not a damage or a defensive spell but does
            something a bit different. It is a very wide topic and I will
            attempt to explain what most classes can do in this respect.<br>
            <br>
            Druids and shamans have perhaps the widest range of utility spells.
            Spirit of the Wolf(which allows you to travel faster in outdoor
            zones) is probably the most well known and liked of these spells.
            Enduring breath will allow you to breath underwater and can be quite
            useful when rooted underwater or if you wish to travel to one of the
            underwater adventure locations. Winged courier allows you to
            transfer an item to a player far away and spirit pouch(shaman only)
            allows you to summon a special container which will reduce weight in
            items. Druids and shamans can also cure the various afflictions
            which you will receive over time(disease, blindness, poison, etc)
            and can cast invisibility and levitation spells.<br>
            <br>
            Enchanters also have several types of utility spells. Probably the
            best of their spells are the quickness line of spells which will
            increase a players attack speed. Enchanters are also great in the
            way of debuffing spells such as Tashan which will lower their
            opponents magic resistance.<br>
            <br>
            Magicians have their own style of utility spells. Magicians can
            summon just about anything you would ever need including bandages,
            food/drink and weapons. Magicians also can summon magical pouches
            and cast invisibility.<br>
            <br>
            Enchanters also have their own blend of utility spells. Enchanters
            can cast mesmerize and AE mesmerize spells which can calm monsters
            and prevent them from attacking. Enchanters can also cast illusion
            spells which will grant them access to areas previously unreachable
            by appearing to be a race which they are not. Add to this
            invisibility, confusion and all sorts of other &quot;mess with
            you&quot; spells and the enchanters are a very useful addition to a
            group.<br>
            <br>
            Necromancers can cast an area effect weaken spell which can be
            somewhat useful as well as fear spells. To help themselves they can
            also feign death and cast invisibility/see invisibility and
            infravision.<br>
            <br>
            Wizard utility spells include invisibility and scout spells. The
            scouting spells include the popular eye of zomm which creates a
            controllable eye which can be used to peek into unscouted terrain
            and the bind sight spell which allows you to see through someone
            elses eyes.<br>
            <br>
            Clerics and paladins can cast invisibility versus undead, fear and
            calming spells. Calming spells allows you to avoid conflicts with
            otherwise aggressive monsters. Fear spells are also useful if you
            are outnumbered and clerics even gain an area effect fear spell at
            level 24.<br>
            <br>
            Rangers can cast invisibility(outdoor at level 15 and indoor at
            level 49), spirit of the wolf, root and water breathing spells.<br>
            <br>
            Shadowknights also sport a few utility spells including an AE weaken
            spell and invisibility versus undead. They can render themselves
            invisible and grant themselves the ability to see invisibility and
            infravision.<br>
            <br>
            Bards are the most effective class when it comes to group utility
            spells. They can grant the entire group a spell similar to spirit of
            the wolf, water breathing and invisibility as well as casting area
            effect calm spells on their opponents.</p>
            <p align="center" style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8"><font face="Arial" size="4" color="#DDDD00">Special
            Skills</font></p>
            <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8">We that we have covered the spells in the game it's time to cover
            special skills available to different classes.<br>
            <br>
            Paladins have perhaps the best class specific skill in lay hands.
            This ability can only be used once per game day(about every hour and
            a half) but will heal close to 1000 hit points even at level 1. This
            is a life saver.<br>
            <br>
            Shadowknights have the harm touch skill which is the exact opposite
            of lay hands though not near as effective. Where lay hands heals
            damage harm touch causes it. It will do (level*10)+1 damage when
            used. This means it will do 11 damage at level 1 and 501 damage at
            level 50. Like lay hands it can only be used once per day. The main
            problem with this skill is that it can be resisted as a spell and it
            often doesn't do full damage.<br>
            <br>
            Forage is a skill gained by rangers, druids and bards. This skill
            will allow you to scrounge up food and water and will reduce the
            amount of money spent on food and prevent you from having to make
            food runs.<br>
            <br>
            Tracking is gained by rangers at level 1, druids at level 20 and
            bards at level 35. This is an incredibly useful skill as it allows
            you to not only track down monsters in outdoor zones but also to
            discover if monsters have spawned in indoor zones. This skill is
            almost a neccessity for finding rare npc's in outdoor zones.<br>
            <br>
            Instill doubt is a skill gained by rogues and bards. It is a skill
            based fear spell which will cause your opponent to turn and flee.<br>
            <br>
            Safe fall is a skill that rogues, monks and bards will gain. It will
            prevent you from taking damage when falling from great distances if
            succesful.<br>
            <br>
            Hide and sneak are gained by monks, bards and rogues and can be used
            together as a skill based invisibility spell. Sneak will cause you
            to move slowly and hide will only work if you are standing still.
            They are not the most effective way to go around it but they do work
            and are better to have than not have.<br>
            <br>
            Apply poison and create poison are rogue specific skills which when
            working will allow you to create a poison and poison blades to do a
            DoT damage to your opponents.<br>
            <br>
            The rogue skills of sense and disarm traps can be used to find traps
            and remove them. There are some deadly traps in the game and these
            can help in exploring new areas though traps are few and far between
            in Everquest.<br>
            <br>
            Pick locks can be useful if you are stuck in a dangerous place
            behind a locked door. It is gained by rogues and bards.<br>
            <br>
            Alchemy is a special skill available to shamans which will allow
            them to create potions which can be passed out to party members.<br>
            <br>
            Last but not least pick pocket will allow rogues to steal from their
            target. Beware this can result in being attacked if caught and will
            lower your faction with the friends of the victim.</p>
            <p align="center" style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8"><font face="Arial" size="4" color="#DDDD00">All Is
            Not Well...</font></p>
            <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8">Now that we have covered what each class can do let's talk about
            what they can't do.<br>
            <br>
            Warriors can both dish and absorb punishment. The upside is that in
            a group they will always be fighting and a part of the action. The
            weakness is that there isn't much variety in being a warrior. Your
            battles will consist of nothing more than hitting the kick or slam
            button and occasionally taunt. After you receive dual wield and
            double attack at level 15 there isn't much to look forward to from
            that point on. You do receive riposte at level 25 and disarm at
            level 35 and they are nice additions, but they aren't much to strive
            after. Warriors find themselves relying on their party members more
            than anyone else. It is your job to stand there and take the
            punishment and you will need to have faith that your healers will
            heal you before you die. Finally having a lot of hit points can be a
            curse as well. You will not be able to solo very effectively at
            higher levels unless you don't mind resting for 30+ minutes after a
            fight while regaining your hit points.<br>
            <br>
            Monks have enough extras to keep them a bit more interesting than
            warriors. You can sneak and feign death which might save your life a
            time or two. Perhaps most importantly is the mend wound skill which
            can heal you during combat(but it can only be used every 5-10
            minutes which makes it a one shot per fight type of deal). Monks can
            dish a whole lot of damage however they can't take as much as a
            warrior. There aren't many items which you can use and your human
            eyes can be a weakness(monks can only be human). The lack of armor
            will become more apparent at higher levels and a level 10 monk will
            look much like a level 40 monk. There is of course the level 50ish
            green platemail armor that monks can in fact wear but you will not
            receive it until you are very high level.<br>
            <br>
            Rogues can make a very fun class for the right type of player. They
            have many special skills which prevent them from becoming as
            monotonaus as a warrior although some of these skills will not be
            used very often. In traditional pen and paper RPG's the sense/disarm
            traps and pick locks were very effective tactics. In Everquest they
            can be used but you will find very few circumstances where you can
            use them. Pick pockets is great as you can actually steal keys off
            NPC's(since picking locks is not as effective as many rogues would
            like) and you can lace your pockets with gold. However around level
            30 you will find that you have all the equipment that you need and
            can buy and that extra money will largely go unused. Another problem
            with being a rogue is that you will not be liked very well by many
            NPC's and a lot of them will refuse to deal with you.<br>
            <br>
            Bards are a great class in a group. They are the only class which
            can cast a wide variety of spells which can enhance every member of
            your party. The weakness in bards is primarily the same as their
            strength. They are great in a GROUP. Bards suffer a fierce
            experience penalty when soloing and most of their spells are most
            useful in a group. If you love to group then a bard might be the
            right solution for you as they can do so many different things
            casting spells, using rogue skills and being a decent fighter who
            can use most items. If you plan on doing a lot of soloing bards
            might not be the best choice unless you want to level slowly.<br>
            <br>
            Rangers are an excellent class for both soloing and grouping.
            Rangers can fill in as a warrior and can also cast healing and
            buffing spells on themselves and others which will reduce downtime
            when soloing or in groups without a priest. Tracking will give them
            a leg up on finding the rare npc's who carry some of the most
            powerful magic items in the game and will also make it easy to find
            targets in outdoor zones. The inability to use most platemail armor
            will rear it's head during the late 20's to high 30's until you are
            able to get a hold of rubicite or green splinted platemail. Your
            offensive spells are by and large useless because they do not do
            much damage and will suck a lot of your mana.<br>
            <br>
            Paladins make a great class at higher levels. They can heal, buff
            and damage undead. The holy paladin swords are very powerful and
            they can use a wide variety of items. Be prepared for a long hard
            trek if you choose a paladin. Other than the ability to lay hands
            they are nothing more than a weak warrior without kick for the first
            9 levels. Up to level 20 they are still quite underpowered. If you
            wish to use an extra attack you will have to wield a shield as bash
            requires it(and you never receive duel wield). With the exception of
            lesser heal(level 15) your spells will be underpowered at lower
            levels and you won't be able to double attack until level 20.<br>
            <br>
            Shadowknights can be a very powerful class at higher levels however
            like paladins be prepared for a long journey early on. Until level
            15 your spells will be not be very useful(though siphon strength is
            a nice touch) and harm touch is no lay hands in terms of usefulness.
            The saving grace is that you can start off with 2h slashing and use
            it all the way through if you choose a troll or ogre(which you
            should if you plan on getting the most out of this class) and still
            gain an extra attack(slam). Slam will only do 1 point of damage
            until you reach level 12 and train in bash but that 1 point is
            better than nothing and will also stun. At level 15 you will receive
            a pet which will help get thigns going. The problem with
            shadowknights is that they can only heal themselves during a fight
            and only receive one heal spell and that isn't until level 22. That
            having been said prepare for a lot of downtime if you plan on
            soloing. Your offensive spells are damage over time which fits in
            well since you are primarily a melee class but unlike other hybrids
            you never receive the root spell which will make it hard to chase
            down runners. Last but not least shadowknights are shunned by the
            majority of Norrath which will make life difficult.<br>
            <br>
            Druids are one of the best solo classes in the game. The ability to
            track coupled with their strong outdoor spells allow them to be the
            king of outdoor soloers along with high level wizards. Group
            teleport and healing spells insure that you will be desired in most
            classes indoor or outdoor. The weakness of druids doesn't really
            begin to show until around level 30. Druids can only wear leather
            type armor and cannot wear mage type armor. This means that you will
            not be able to stand toe to toe at higher levels and take advantage
            of your damage spells or limited melee ability. What it means is
            that at higher levels mage types might actually have a higher armor
            class than druids. The other weakness is that they will often become
            healers in groups without a cleric which means medding during battle
            which canbe quite boring.<br>
            <br>
            Shamans are one of the most loved group classes but they can also
            solo with high efficiency. They are loved for their utility spells
            and they can use up to chainmail type armor and some high level
            magical platemail. The weakness in the class is that their heal
            spells end with greater heal and that their utility spells will be
            in high demands which will equal out to a lot of meditating at high
            levels. Their offensive spells are decent but are not the most
            effective in the game which means you will have to turn into the
            healer in many parties which will mean a lot of meditating during
            the battle.<br>
            <br>
            Clerics are a powerful class that is always in demand. They are
            mighty undead destroyers who also happen to have the best healing
            and buffing spells in the game. By soloing undead clerics can often
            powerlevel through the early levels and by having the ability to
            wear platemail they are a favorite choice of many beginning players.
            Be warned however their strengths are also the same factors which
            make them a boring class at higher levels. Because you are the best
            healers in the game you will be expected to meditate during fights
            to heal the tanks so they can fight the toughest possible monsters.
            This means that you will do very little fighting after level 30 and
            will basically become a first aid kit for the rest of the party to
            carry around.<br>
            <br>
            Wizards are probably the most viable solo class at higher levels.
            They are also in much demand by parties looking to take on powerful
            challenges. Their group teleport spells can help a party escape from
            sure death situations and their sight spells can help scout out new
            locations. However being a wizard is a long hard road. At low levels
            wizards are probably the weakest of all classes and you may find
            yourself shunned at early levels. You can kill monsters quickly but
            it will blow all your mana and you will be forced to sit and
            meditate. When you are sitting and meditating you are very
            vulnerable. Wizards like most mage types have low hit points and you
            will not have a pet to guard you. Some wizards also complain that
            being a wizard can be very repetitous root and nuke then med and do
            it over again. Nonetheless they are quite powerful and should not be
            overlooked.<br>
            <br>
            Enchanters are the masters of illusion and confusion spells. They
            are not a great solo class but are highly sought after in a group.
            They are also one of the more interesting classes in the game as
            they can do so many unique things. Charm is also a useful(albeit
            dangerous) tool. Weaknesses are their low damage DD spells, the fact
            that their spells are resisted more than other classes, and the fact
            that they are most effective in a group.<br>
            <br>
            Necromancers are one of the strongest classes in the game. They are
            also one of the most difficult to play. You will find very few NPC's
            who will deal with you and this will cut you off from some of the
            more interesting quests in the game. You also don't have much in the
            way of direct damage. You will need to rely on your pet or a tank so
            you can get off your damage over time spells and slowly eat away at
            your opponent. That having been said your pets are quite powerful
            and you have a wider variety of spell types than most other classes
            perhaps only matched by druids.<br>
            <br>
            Magicians are another interesting class. They have several different
            types of pets and can summon many different items. They are useful
            to lower level parties whose tanks may not have magical weapons. You
            can also summon bandages which can be used to practice the semi
            useful bind wound skill and save your healers mana. Weaknesses of
            the class is that you will never be able to match damage with a
            wizard and the fact that buying 4 new elemental summoning spells
            every level can get quite expensive.<br>
            <br>
            We have gone in this guide over the positive and negative side of
            all of the classes in the game. I'd like to be able to tell you
            which class and race to choose right off the bat but in a game such
            as Everquest this is impossible. There are so many great options
            that it purely depends on your playing style. Hopefully this
            editorial will help you ease the decision making process and more
            importantly will let you know of some weaknesses your class may
            experience at higher levels. There is nothing worse than dedicated a
            large amount of time to a class only to discover that you dislike
            what it can do at higher levels and want to play a different one.</p>
