<CENTER><FONT FACE="DungeonKeeperII">DeHawk's Newbie Guide to Fear</FONT></FONT></CENTER>
<BLOCKQUOTE><FONT SIZE=-1>
<P>What kills more in the Planes than anything else? Cazic? Dracholiche? The breakin?

<P>Actually, none of the above. The one thing that gets more people killed and raids wiped out are people that don't know a *thing* about Fear, at least, until they zone into it. This guide is written not to tell you how to break in - face it, everyone does it differently - but what to expect when you get there. I hope this will make it easier on those who are going in for the first time.

<P><I>What is the Plane of Fear?</I><BR>
Ok. The Plane of Fear is the home of Cazic Thule, the God of Fear. Once you zone in you'll think it looks just like a jungle zone, until you notice that the sky is blood red - and speaking of blood, it rains it here - and there are strange buildings along the land.  There is ONE zone in point into the Plane of Fear, and you CANNOT zone out from it. That spot is the Portal, it's big, ugly, and slightly pink in it's appearance. The portal is in the South West corner of the zone, and will drop you facing North.

<P>The zone out in the Plane of Fear is at Cazic's Temple. You CANNOT make it out if you run to it when there are mobs still up in that area. Period. If you try you die. What does this mean? Well, it means that if you can't gate out on your own or have someone gate you out, you're stuck up there. And yet tanks still come to this zone after loot. We're gulliable, what ye say? =) Don't worry tho. I have NEVER seen someone permantly stranded in a Plane and I've got over 100 hours logged in 'em.

<P>The Plane of Fear is where the following armor types drop: Carmine (Wizard), Thorny Vine (Ranger), Valorium (Paladin), Umbral (ShadowKnight), Vermituclated (Druid), Blighted (Necromancer), Shiver (Monk) Cryosilk (casters), and a few misclenaious things like a Warrior Whip, a Ranger Axe, a Cleric Belt, a Shaman Belt, and some other goodies.

<P>Is there better armor than this? Yes, but usually substantially harder to pick up. This is a good transitional gearset between Mainland Armor - Kunark / SoV armor types. Of course, as always, there are some peices that suck and some peices that are quite good. (Example: Valorium Gauntlets are good, but not as good as Gauntlets of the Black, which can be picked up for about 1500pp on Veeshan) Alot of prestige comes from this armor because it says, basically, "I came, I saw, I fought hell and came back with the t-shirt."

<P><I>What should I expect?</I><BR>
Everything. You're going to find some really ugly stuff in this zone. You're going to find mobs that debuff, fear, backstab, cast, grav flux, hit for obscene ammounts of damage, knockback, harmtouch, deathtouch, and a few other not so kind and loving things. You CAN expect to die and die hard your first few times (and every time after) because you're walking into World War 3, basically. Ever seen a train consist of 120+ lvl 50+ mobs? Come to the PoF, and you will. (Note: mobs and their specials will be listed below)

<P><I>Where is the Plane of Fear?</I><BR>
The Fearplane is located through a Portal in the Ferrott. The Specter cave on the South West side of the Ferrott zone is where you have to pass through to find the portal. You can't miss it, it's the BIG gate with the strange graphic in it. And I mean strange.

<P><I>What level do I have to be to go in it?</I><BR>
46 is the minimal level required, however, with the good chance at death and the amount of exp you lose, you should wait until level 47 at least. I speak from experience on this - experience gained from a 12hr+ CR and PLing job.

<P>Some very important things you need to know about the Planes.

<P><B>1.</B> If you do not ASSIST the main tank, you will likely either get yourself or your group or even the whole raid killed. Assist is there for a reason, and that is so that the players don’t break mezz on mobs until those mobs have been selected to die by the main tank. If you need to know how the Assist key works, simply type in /assist <name> where <name> is the name of the tank you are to be assisting. Make this button a hotkey and do NOT press the autoattack key. This will get you thrown from a raid long before anything else.

<P><B>2.</B> Protect the chanters. If you are a healing class - and this DOES include us Paladins - you keep the enchanter in your group alive and at full health all the time. They have few HP and it doesn’t take too many hits by a creature connecting for 120 for them to die.

<P><B>3.</B> Protect the clerics. Same as above.

<P><B>4.</B> I’ll say it again, ASSIST the main tank. If you do not know who it is, then FIND OUT. 

<P><B>5.</B> Stand and die. If you are agro’d by a mob upon zone in, *and unless specifically told by the raid leader* you stand and die on the spot. Do not train the main group, if you do you’ll wipe out everyone. And that’s bad. Very, very bad. It’s a surefire way to get kicked off of a raid - and if the person leading it isn’t nice, responsible for your own CR.

<P><B>6.</B> Don’t whine or beg for specific mobs or item drops. When loot drops it will be awarded / rolled on, depending on who is leading it. Whining is another good way to make sure you won’t be on another planar raid or get any items while you’re there. 

<P><B>7.</B> Crap happens. If you get killed or your raid gets wiped out, don’t cuss out the guild or throw a temper tantrum. Your corpse will be recovered, you will get your items back. Again, good way to not get invited on a raid again.

<P><B>8.</B> Don’t invite more people on your own. ASK the raid leader if they can come, and if he / she says no, then they don’t. Don’t even try to argue unless you want to stay with them outside of the Planes.

<P><B>9.</B> If you get Feared/Summoned/Transported away, when it breaks you stand still for a minute to see if you are agro’d. If you aren’t, then come back to the main group, and carefully. If you are, get a /loc and die on the spot. You’ll get a resurrection. 

<P>Now for the specific mob types.

<P><B>Scarelings.</B> Evil incarnate. These creatures are often the downfall of many raids, and unfortunately, they populate the portal area like nothing else. They hit for around 100 max, but can backstab for closer to 300. They drop a Rogue Raiper with decent stats on it. <I>Special Attack:</I> transportation. They can randomly transport you from where you are to any other part of the zone. This hurts a bit. 

<P><B>Spinechiller Spiders.</B> Ugly white spiders. Drops various pieces of Cryosilk Armor. I think that they have a poison special attack, but not sure.

<P><B>Shiverback Apes.</B> Big mean apes that drop the monk only Shiverback Armor. <I>Special Attack:</I> cold based nuke. They do cast an Ice DD spell, but for how much I’m not sure.

<P><B>Samhains.</B> Giant Jack o’ Lanterns. They drop a Ranger-Only Axe, and have no special attacks. Counts as an Undead Target..

<P><B>Turmoil Toad.</B> Small and hard to hit. Drops Turmoil Warts, a throwing weapon, They look like miniature undead Frogloks. Drops the Flayed Turmoil Skin Belt, a Shaman item. <I>Special Attack:</I> Gravity Flux. Counts as an Undead Target.

<P><B>Fright Fingers.</B> Very small to see. Hits hard. Drops Carmine (Wizard) armor.

<P><B>Boogeyman.</B> Looks like a gigantic Ghoul. Drops Blighted (Necromancer) armor. Counts as an Undead Target.

<P><B>Fetid Fiend (Male).</B> A gigantic zombie. Drops Valorium (Paladin) armor. Counts as an Undead Target.

<P><B>Fetid Fiend (Female).</B> Another gigantic zombie. Drops the Girdle of the Diligent, a Cleric only belt. Counts as Undead.

<P><B>Glare Lord.</B> An evil eye. Has a pet. Drops a Magican Wand that has 4 charges of  "Lavashield". <I>Special Attack:</I> High level AoE Dispell Magic.

<P><B>Gorgons.</B> Resembles the Harpies in Steamfront. Drops Vermiticulated Armor (Druid)

<P><B>Phantasim.</B> A massive Specter. Never seen one of these drop anything, and really only can recall seeing one per raid time while Planar. Counts as an Undead Target.

<P><B>Phoboplasm.</B> The Gelatinous Cube of Qyenos returns. This mob drops random pieces of Planar armor, and usually quite a few at that. ANY armor from Fear or Hate can drop from this mob. <I>Special Attack:</I> AoE Dispell.

<P><B>Tentacle Tormenters.</B> The Tentacle Terrors of the mainland reborn. Drops Thorny Vine (Ranger) armor. <I>Special Attack:</I> Knockback, AoE Mass Dispell

<P><B>Worry Wraiths.</B> Gigantic Wisps. Enchanter type mobs, have a pet. Drops a funky type of Lightstone. 

<P><B>Nightmare.</B> A horse. Drops Iskar SK armor. <I>Special Attack:</I> Blinds

<P><B>Amygdalan Knight.</B> Drops ShadowKnight Umbral armor. Can’t describe this one. <I>Special Attack:</I> has a pet, Harm Touches.

<P><B>Amygdalan Warrior.</B>  Drops the Nautilus Shield, Amygdalan Tendril, which are Warrior items.

<P><B>Fright, Dread, Terror.</B> Golems that drop items off of Cazic Thule’s old treasure horde. <I>Special Attack:</I> Fright and Dread DT. Terror AoE Dispells and has a Cold based AE.

<P><B>Dracholiche.</B> Undead dragon. Drops items off of CT’s old treasure horde + new and unique items aswell. Counts as an Undead Target <I>Special Attack:</I> Deathtouch, AoE Fear, and more.

<P><B>Cazic-Thule.</B> The God of Fear. Drops a slew of awesome items, is very hard to kill, has MANY special attacks that are too numerous to list here.

<P><HR>
<P><I>Keep in mind, when this was written, I didn't expect to have a home for it here on EQLizer, and thus, I am without links to hte mobs specifically. However, you can find them by checking in the Planar and Mob spawns list.. have fun.. ~Akaran D.</I>
