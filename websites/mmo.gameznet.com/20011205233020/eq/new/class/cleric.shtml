     <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Clerics
     are the most powerful healers in all of Norrath. Clerics are the best class
     in the game at healing and buffing other players. The ability to cure
     diseases and protect players from other dangers is their prime domain.
     Clerics are the only class in the game who can ressurect the dead. They can
     banish undead in a with their mighty spells that can rival those of a
     wizard. When it is all said and done every party is always in need of a
     cleric.<br>
     <br>
     That having been said if you are considering a cleric you will need to know
     a few things up front. Do not be caught up by the fact that clerics can
     wear <a href="http://gameznet.com/eq/equipment/plate.html">platemail</a>
     and wield <a href="http://gameznet.com/eq/equipment/ogremaul.html">ogre war
     mauls</a>. If your primary reason for considering a cleric is because you
     believe they can fight well and also cast spells then get that idea out of
     your mind right away. In <a href="http://www.everquest.com">Everquest</a>
     clerics are not very strong on the meelee side of things. At lower
     levels(1-12) you may be able to stand toe to toe with your enemies healing
     yourself and getting away with it. However at higher levels the life of a
     cleric is one of a healer. Your duty in a group will be to heal, buff, and
     god forbid ressurect your team members. If this sounds like your kind of
     fun then a cleric is definately for you. If it does not excite you then you
     will probably be better off with another class.<br>
     <br>
     Clerics can don most armor up to and including platemail and they can use
     most blunt weapons. This makes them the best suited of the pure casters and
     priest classes when it comes to meelee. However cleric weapon skills only
     go up at a rate of 4 points per level in comparison to 5 points per level
     for a true meelee class. In addition to this clerics only gain one
     defensive skill that being dodge(at level 15). Clerics dodging skill maxes
     out at Very Good where a meelee classes dodging skill can raise much
     higher. In addition meelee classes gain parry, riposte and disarm. Meelee
     classes also receive double attack and in some cases duel wield, bash, slam
     and kick. This means that while clerics can fill in as a tank at higher
     levels they will not be able to actually meelee anything blue to
     death(unless they have a couple people healing and rooting for them and a
     lot of time to spare). This is not only a problem with clerics and combat
     but with all other casters other than hybrids.<br>
     <br>
     The ability to dawn powerful armor such as platemail is definately a plus
     but it also makes decisions tough on a cleric. Plate armor is extremely
     expensive. Clerics are the only non-hybrid casting class which has to not
     only buy spells but also has to save money up for plate mail at the higher
     levels. This can make a clerics life one of poverty.<br>
     <br>
     As with all other priest classes clerics gain the channeling skill at level
     4. Channeling allows you to regain your concentration and continue casting
     a spell if you have been hit in the middle of casting your spell. This does
     not always work and will work very seldomly at first. However it is a great
     skill and will save your life more than once at higher levels. It is
     important to remember to train at least one point in this skill after you
     reach level 4.</font>
     <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Clerics
     also gain meditate at level 8. Once you get meditate your life will be much
     easier as you will have less downtime waiting to regain your mana. It is
     important to remember to train at least 1 point into meditation once you
     hit level 8 so you can begin practicing this great skill.<br>
     <br>
     The last skill which clerics attain is specialization at level 30.
     Specialization allows you to specialize in a particular school of magic.
     For example you can specialize in Evocation and be more powerful using your
     offensive spells. Most clerics will choose to specialize in Alteration or
     Abjuration which will allow them to be more efficient with their healing
     and buffing spells.<br>
     <br>
     Enough of this boring stuff let's get to the <a href="http://gameznet.com/eq/spells/cleric.html">spell</a>
     breakdown:<br>
     <br>
     Clerics are the most powerful healers in the game. They generally get their
     healing spells one circle before other priest classes. Meaning that while
     druids and shamans must wait until level 19 to get the heal spell clerics
     will gain that spell at level 14. Clerics are also the only class in the
     game that gets the complete heal spell at level 34. This spell will be very
     important for fighting the highest level(45+) mobs in the game as it is the
     only spell or ability in the game that can heal a warrior completely at
     those levels.<br>
     <br>
     Clerics buffing spells are also very powerful. The main strength of a
     clerics buffing spells is the fact that there are three different lines
     that can be stacked. The courage-&gt;center-&gt;daring-&gt;etc line of
     spells adds both armor class and hit points. The holy armor-&gt;spirit
     armor-&gt;etc line of spells adds armor class. There is also a third line
     of spells the symbol of transal line of spells which grants additional hit
     points though this line requires a spell component. With the combination of
     these three buffs a cleric can buff a player to extremely high statistics
     that are unattainable with the buffs of any other class.</font></p>
     <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Clerics
     have a very useful line of spells that begins with divine aura(at level 1).
     These spells grant the cleric total invulnerability for a brief period of
     time. I cannot tell you how many times these spells have saved my tail.
     This spell not only can be used for self evasion but also will allow you to
     remain confident in your ability to stay behind and heal your party members
     making sure that they all get out because you know that you can divine if
     things get bad. The higher level versions of this spell(including the level
     29 divine barrier) not only render you invulnerable but also regenerate
     your hit points and stamina.<br>
     <br>
     Clerics also feature a calming line of spells. These spells can be very
     useful inside of dungeons. Clerics never receive invisibility versus normal
     monsters(though at level 14 they do get invisibility to undead) but calm
     spells can be used as a substitute to invisibility if used carefully. Calm
     can also be used to limit the number of monsters that your group will have
     to face. Say for example you come up against 3 different monsters and your
     group has no chance of defeating all three. You could calm two of them and
     then pull the third out with a spell. Your group will now only have to
     fight one monster at a time. Be careful with these spells however becauase
     if the monster resists he will be very angry and will charge straight for
     you.<br>
     <br>
     As we mentioned at the beginning of this guide clerics are the only class
     in the game which can raise the dead. At level 29 clerics gain revive which
     basically teleports a player back to his corpse saving him a lot of travel
     time and potential danger. The level 39 and level 49 variants of the spell
     not only teleport the player to his corpse but also restore a portion of
     the experience that the player lost upon death. This is the one line of
     spells that truly gives clerics their own identity.<br>
     <br>
     Clerics are also mighty warriors against undead foes. Clerics offensive
     spells versus undead are by far the most powerful versus these beasts at
     the early levels. Necromancers also get these same spells but not until a
     circle after the clerics. Undead are plentiful in the game and frequent
     many dungeons including <a href="http://gameznet.com/eq/zone/befallen.html">Befallen</a>,
     <a href="http://gameznet.com/eq/zone/najena.html">Najena</a>, <a href="http://gameznet.com/eq/zone/unrest.html">Unrest</a>,
     and <a href="http://gameznet.com/eq/zone/lguk.html">The Ruins Of Old Guk</a>.
     If powerleveling is your game then you will be happy with a cleric if you
     stick to undead dungeons. At higher levels(24+) wizard spells begin to
     become just as efficient versus everything as clerics are versus undead.
     They never become more efficient than cleric spells they do however has a
     faster recast time. This means that clerics at higher levels will still be
     better than every other casters versus undead other than wizards and they
     will be close to them.<br>
     <br>
     Verus non-undead monsters cleric offensive spells could use a lot of help.
     There are three different lines of spells that work on all monsters.<br>
     <br>
     First there is the stun-&gt;holy might line of spells which stun your
     opponent for a brief period of time and do a small amount of damage. These
     spells are only really useful versus casters or runners and then they are
     only useful in a group. They have a long recast delay which limits their
     usefulness.<br>
     <br>
     The second line of offensive spells is the word of pain-&gt;shadow line of
     spells. These are person based area effect spells. Word of pain may allow
     you to take out low blues when you first receive it at level 9 however
     after that these spells are only really good for clearing hall trash. Only
     time you can actually use these spells to kill blue monsters is if you have
     several clerics all casting the same spells.<br>
     <br>
     The third line of offensive spells are the only ones that are really
     useful. This is the strike-&gt;smite-&gt;wrath-&gt;etc line of spells.
     These spells are the only thing that allows a cleric to be able to solo
     anything blue(non undead) post level 20. These spells have a pretty bad
     damage:mana ratio in comparison to the spells that other classes receive.
     They also briefly stun your opponent. One problem is not only the bad
     damage ratio but also the fact that they have a long recast delay. But by
     far the biggest problem with this line of spells is that they are few and
     far between. For example strike is totally useless around level 6 or so,
     smite becomes useless in the low 20s, and wrath is totally useless by
     around level 40. That having been said you will still be glad to have these
     spells as they do allow you to stand some kind of a chance against your
     foes and also are great for cleaning up running prey.<br>
     <br>
     One other glaring weakness in the cleric line of spells is the lack of
     utility spells. Clerics basically have two utility spells at their
     disposal. The first is the reckless strength line of spells. These spells
     are somewhat useful but they pale in comparison the a shamans spells. The
     second is the invigore line of spells which restore a players stamina.
     While this is useful you rarely have the extra mana to spend in a battle on
     restoring ones stamina.<br>
     <br>
     Now let's assume your convinced that you want to be a cleric. What race
     should you choose? As always I feel that race is purely a matter of
     personal playing style but some races are more suited for the task than
     others. My personal favorite pick would be a <a href="http://gameznet.com/eq/race/dwarf.html">dwarf</a>.
     Dwarven clerics are good for several reasons. They have naturally high
     strength, stamina, and wisdom which are very important statistics for a
     cleric. The glaring weakness of a dwarven cleric lies in his agility. I
     would recommend you pour most of your training points into agility and give
     it at least a score of 80. Spread the rest between strength or wisdom.<br>
     <br>
     All in all I feel that clerics are a very good class and one that is
     neccessary in this game. There will always be a place for you in any group.
     However don't be surprised if at higher levels you become nothing more than
     a band aid. You will spend the majority of your time with your nose in the
     spellbook trying to meditate for mana. This is a challenge in itself as you
     try to balance the amount of mana at your disposal with a players need to
     get healed. It will take careful timing to get the most out of your mana
     and not waste any, all the while you may have some panicked tanks. If this
     is your idea of fun and challenge then a cleric is the class for you. If
     you would rathe be the disher of punishment then perhaps you should choose
     another class.</font><br>
