     are one of the most interesting professions in all of Norrath. While
     wizards dish damage, magicians create things and necromancers delve with
     the dead an enchanters role is not as readily apparent. Enchanters
     encompass a wide range of spell types including charm spells, enchanting
     items(for jewelcrafting), illusions, buffs and debuffs. They are often
     overlooked by many players however I can assure you that once you have
     grouped with a high level enchanter you will never want to be without one.<br>
     <br>
     When creating an enchanter there are only two abilities that you really
     need worry about. First and foremost is the obvious intelligence. More
     intelligence equals more mana and more mana is a good thing. The secondary
     trait is charisma. Charisma helps the duration and succes rate of charm
     spells. I would recommend you max out your intelligence and put any
     remaining points into charisma.<br>
     <br>
     Enchanter skills are standard mage fare. You will not have many special
     skills though you can look forward to dodge at level 22, research at level
     16 and specialization at level 20.<br>
     <br>
     The important thing to remember about enchanters is that your not going to
     get really interesting until later levels. A lot of players give up on
     enchanters in the first four levels. They see that enchanter spells get
     resisted a bit more often than other classes and that it's quite easy to
     die in this level range and often abandon the class altogether and try out
     a different class. As it will become apparent by the end of this article
     however enchanters are a unique class whose abilities can greatly benefit a
     party. Let's delve into the different types of enchanter spells:<br>
     <br>
     Perhaps the most famous of enchanter spells are the illusion line of
     spells. These spells allow you appear as a different being. Minor illusion
     is one of my favorites as it will make you appear as an object in the area.
     For example depending on location you can appear to be a house, a rock or a
     gigantic najena door. This is very interesting for PVE(and is fun to mess
     with people with) and can be a lifesaver in PVP play. The other illusion
     spells allow you to take the shape, form and characteristics of different
     races. Say for example you are a dark elf hated in human cities you could
     assume the form of a human and walk around the city as an accepted member
     of the society. This is just the tip of the iceberg however. You also can
     use the special abilities of that particular race. Let's say you wanted to
     regenerate faster after a long battle you could assume the form of a troll,
     larger beings can bash, etc. You could assume the form of an element and
     walk a dungeon in piece if it's denizens accept elements. This indeed is a
     great line of spells.<br>
     <br>
     Another great line of enchanter spells is the calming line of spells. These
     spells allow your party to fight a single monster rather than two or three
     at once. This is a neccessity if you do not have a monk or a shadowknight
     fetching for you at higher levels. The calm line of spells are used before
     combat. You can cast these spells on all of the monsters in a group then
     pick out the nearest one and hope the others do not join in.<br>
     <br>
     The mesmerize line of spells are similar to calm yet they work during
     combat. Calm will not work once a monster has become agitated however
     mesmerize will. You will need to cast it multiple times during a battle as
     its duration is short. However if you had a bad pull it is a great way to
     allow your party to deal with less mobs at once.<br>
     <br>
     Enchanters can summon pets in the form of Animations. These pets are quite
     useful though they are limited in comparison to the pets of a magician or
     necromancer. You will not be able to issue commands to your pet. It will
     basically follow you around and fight what you fight. This is not a major
     problem but it would be nice to be able to command your servant.<br>
     <br>
     Let's go ahead and get to the nitty gritty of any class, the ability to
     dish damage. This is one area where enchanters are often under estimated.
     Enchanters can cast both damage over time(dot) and direct damage offensive
     spells. Their direct damage spells will never rival that of a wizards but
     they are rather decent considering all the other things that an enchanter
     can do. Combine those with their damage over time spells and an enchanter
     can fill in as a nuker quite nicely.<br>
     <br>
     Enchanters gain the ability to cast invisibilty at level 4 the earliest of
     any class. Not only can they cast this spell on themselves but also on
     others as well. This is an extremely useful spell especially on the PVP
     server.<br>
     <br>
     Perhaps enchanters most famous line of spells is the charm spells. This is
     yet another way that enchanters can help in those rough battles. Not only
     does a charmed monster equal one less mob that you have to contend with but
     it can be a very powerful party member as well. Enchanters gain the ability
     to charm at an early level 12.<br>
     <br>
     It only makes sense that enchanters are likewise the best at canceling
     charm as well. Enchanters taper/strip enchantment line of spells allow you
     to not only cancel one spell effect at a time but several at once. This is
     very important if you have multiple players charmed in a tough battle.<br>
     <br>
     Enchanters have a large variety of utility spells as well. At level 8 you
     will be able to grant see invisibility to other players. At level 12 you
     will be able to cast infravision and water breathing. These are all very
     useful at their respective levels. You gain the ability to root at level 8
     and cast ultravision at level 34.<br>
     <br>
     One other useful spell attained at early levels is the fear line of
     spells(beginning at level 4). These spells will allow you to get rid of
     unwanted foes for a short period of time. Be careful with this spell
     however as a feared monster may bring back some friends on his way back to
     the fight, and he WILL return.<br>
     <br>
     This is where memory blur comes in. Memory blur will reset a monsters aggro
     list. This means that if you agitated a beast he will now forget about you
     and everyone else. Without this spell you would have to zone or kill the
     beast or else he would continually be searching for you.<br>
     <br>
     Enchanters also excel in stun spells. Stun spells will interupt a caster
     and will prevent melee classes from attacking during the period of the
     stun. They will also prevent monsters from running temporarily.<br>
     <br>
     Enchanters are the only class you can enchant metals which is essential to
     jewelcrafting. This ability combined with their high intelligence makes
     enchanters the ideal jewelcrafters. Jewelcrafting can produce some
     excellent magical necklaces, facemasks, bracelets, rings and earrings and
     should not be taken lightly.<br>
     <br>
     The area where enchanters really excel in however is buffs and debuffs.
     They get good spells and they get a lot of them. The majority of the other
     enchanter spells are of the buff/debuff nature and the more popular lines
     will all be covered below.<br>
     <br>
     The first of the buff/debuff spells you will receive are the level one
     weaken and strengthen spells. Strengthen will of course increase the
     strength of yourself or a party member and weaken will take it away(from a
     monster). These can be rather useful at low levels.<br>
     <br>
     Level 4 will see the first of your tradional(armor class) buffs in the form
     of the haze spell. This line of spells will be upgraded every couple
     circles(beginning with the level 12 mist). These spells may not be able to
     rival those of a cleric but they are useful nonetheless if you are the only
     buffer in a party.<br>
     <br>
     The tashan line of spells is perhaps the best debuff an enchanter(or any
     class) can cast in a group heavy with magic users. These spells lower your
     opponents magic resistance. This is important as it will allow your party
     to cast direct damage(or other harmful) spells on the beast with less fear
     of their spells being resisted or partially resisted. This is especially
     important if you are fighting red or yellow opponents.<br>
     <br>
     The disempower line of spells will reduce your opponents strength, armor
     class and stamina making it a very useful spell during combat. Your tanks
     will love you for it.<br>
     <br>
     The berserker strength spells can be cast on your team members in sticky
     situations. This spell trades 20 strength for 20 agility. At first this
     will seem like a bad idea however it also grants temporary invulnerability
     from attacks. You chain casting this spell you can make your team members
     untouchable and strong.<br>
     <br>
     Speaking of invulnerability let's not forget the rune line of spells. Rune
     spells grant a player invulnerability for a certain amount of hit points.
     The only downfall is that they require a reagent making them expensive to
     cast and forcing you to be judicious about when to use these spells.
     However if your healers are out of mana and your tank is dying this spell
     can be a lifesaver.<br>
     <br>
     The quickness-&gt;alacrity-&gt;haste line of spells increase a players rate
     of attack. Faster attacks = more damage over the course of a fight. These
     spells have a decent duration as well allowing you to cast this on the
     tanks then med away while your party reaps the rewards.<br>
     <br>
     While you can increase your parties rate of attack you can also decrease a
     monsters with the languid pace line of spells. The slower a monster swings
     the less damage it will do to your tanks saving the priests mana and giving
     your tank a sense of security.<br>
     <br>
     Not all of your spells revolve around helping the tanks in your party
     however. You can also clear the minds of your casters allow them to
     increase their mana regeneration. This spell alone ensures an enchanter
     will always be in heavy demand at higher levels.<br>
     <br>
     By this point you should have a good idea of just how powerful and
     interesting the enchanter class truly is. You will not have the glory of
     dishing 1100 points a pop like a wizard, or the glory of wearing shiny
     metal armor like most melee classes. The enchanters deeds often can go
     unnoticed in the course of a battle. However the party will notice the
     benefits of an enchanter when they are no longer around. Many high level
     parties will not leave home without one and with good reason.</font><br>
