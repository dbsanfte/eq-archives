<P>An Overview -

<P>Rogues are viscious dealers of melee death.  They offer extreme damage in combat, and more importantly, *sustainable* damage.  They are not only a very powerful class, but a very fun class to play, with more active gameplay than other melees (will mention some tactics later).

<P>Compared to other classes, Rogues are around a Ranger in terms of hit points.  A rogue's armor is somewhat limited, generally to chain-type armors.  Their AC is pretty similar to a Monks (better if well equipped) but generally somewhere between Rangers and tank classes.  Their defensive and offensive skills cap higher than most classes.  Rogues also have extremely high dual wield skills, and generally even without backstab do superior damage compared to all melee classes aside from Monks.  With backstab calculated in, even Monks are dwarfed in terms of damage.
<P>&nbsp;

<P>Starting Out -

<P>What race?  The best choices stat-wise are probably Barbarian, Half-elf, and Halfling.  Personally, at risk of my guildmates kicking me out for encouraging people to play halflings, I suggest... yes, the midgets.  Racial exp bonuses/penalties still apply, Halflings have the best racial *bonus* (Why?  It must be in the Vision[tm]...).  Plus they actually have pretty good stats.  Personally I'd dump into strength because that will help you the most, although at high levels where Str is so easy to get I find myself wishing I had spread it out to Dex and Sta a little.  Though it doesn't matter much either way.  One of the high points of being a halfling rogue is laughing as your exp bar moves that bit extra faster from Class *and* Race exp bonuses (Yes, I know VI removed exp penalties for hybrids but they specifically stated they were leaving in the bonuses for warriors and rogues because if they didn't it would be interpreted as a "nerf", you do level faster as a rogue).  Plus you're right next to Misty Thicket, easiest newbie exp available.  Even if you do have to associate with the Zorro midgets as guards...

<P>&nbsp;

<P>Rogue Special Skills of Note -

<P>Sneak : Lv1 : Sneak will lower your movement speed greatly, but turn on sneak and walk behind mobs.  Consider them.  Notice their faction goes to Indifferent?  This can be used to complete quests or interact with hostile npcs.  It's useful for walking by mobs that see through all forms of invisibility (if you walk behind them, of course).  Also, when sneak is up you can move while using Hide (see below).  At high levels (55+ I believe to be specific)  the movement speed penalty is decreased, up to full speed at level 60.

<P>Hide : Lv3 : This skill is special for Rogues.  Typical hide works fairly similar to invis, however Rogue hide also confers invisibility to most undead creatures.  In fact, it confers invisibility to many creatures which see through both.  This is an invaluable scouting, exploring, shortcutting (is that a word?), and corpse retrieval tool.

<P>Evade : Lv3 : This is not an actual "skill".  This is an ability activated by turning off attack and then hitting Hide while in combat.  It will reduce your aggro by a small ammount if you're not the mob's primary target, or will drop you to between the 2nd and 3rd person on the mob's hate list if you are its primary target.  In laymen's terms, it gets stuff off you and onto the tank.  It was implemented to offset the rogue tendancy to overaggro.

<P>Pick Lock : Lv6 : Not too important for most of the early game.  To use it, just buy some lockpicks and click on a locked door.  If your skill is high enough, you will pick the door and your skill may raise.  Make sure to get it to 201 when possible (Level 51).  It takes a while and is painfully boring but there are several doors which can be only opened by 201+ lockpicking in the game...

<P>Pick Pocket : Lv7 : Steal coins and occasionally items off a mob.  You must turn off attack to use this.  Generally a good skill if you need cash and don't mind alienating those you group with. =b  Though some don't care.  Actually, at high levels you can steal spells and valuable gems with this (no, I don't do it or condone it).  However it is an important skill to max, as you will need to pick pocket a couple items for your Ragebringer quest later, which is the best Rogue backstabber in the game.

<P>Sense Traps : Lv8 : Max it if you want.  I put it in my Evade macro (see Tactics, below) until it hit 200.  Isn't really important save a few very high level Velious zones (Dragon Necropolis).

<P>***Backstab*** : Lv10 : Backstab gets stars because if you didn't have it you would be a pathetic class.  Backstab makes rogues monsters.  This may only be done with a piercing weapon in your main hand.  From the front side it will hit as an extra pierce, from the back it will attempt to stab your target in a vital area.  This results in greatly increased damage, at all levels.  At low levels you will hit for numbers that will make you blink with suprise, at high levels you will aggrivate wizards by backstabing for over a thousand.  This skill has a small reuse time, but costs nothing to use, thus making rogues the premiere class in sustainable damage.  Backstab damage is LARGELY based off of your main weapon's damage.  It is also affected by Backstab skill and Atk.  (see also Double Backstab and Assassinate)

<P>Safe Fall : Lv12 : Take less damage from falling.  Fall from "unsafe" heights to raise your skill in it.  NOTE: You do not need to take falling damage to raise this skill.  It caps at a meager 94 though.

<P>Dual Wield : Lv13 : A must for Rogues.  Wield a weapon in each hand.  However, the secondary weapon does MUCH less damage than the primary (roughly 10-20% of total damage at high levels, if even!).  Also, there is a damage bonus applied to each hit which increases as your level does, so weapons with very low delays may in fact be better than weapons with good dam/delay ratios, if in the main hand.

<P>Apply/Make Poison : Lv18/20 : Put 1 charge of the selected poison on your weapon which will "proc" the next time you hit a target.  This is generally a fairly ineffective and annoyingly expensive skill.  Unless you play on a PvP server or intend to solo a lot (there are some poisons which slow atk speed...), I wouldn't put much work into this skill.

<P>Disarm Traps : Lv21 : Click on a trap to disarm it.  About as useful as Sense Traps.  Wouldn't worry about it much until you hit 50s, and even then noone will really care if you have it.

<P>Instill Doubt : Lv22 : Once you activate the skill, your character attempts to fear the opponent.  After a few seconds, you will, if you pass your skill check, make a kick.  If the kick lands, it will cast a fear spell on the target, which can still be resisted.  Generally this is not a useful skill.  But in the right place... or when really desprate or soloing...  it has some uses.

<P>Disarm : Lv27 : Disarm your opponent's weapon.  In concept, great!  In reality, it almost never works.  However, this skill is useful for disarming mobs and removing their low-delay weapons if you can get it to work.  More practically, this skill is amazing in PvP.  Land a disarm without your opponent noticing and you can land quite a few free hits until they realize they're punching you.

<P>Discipline - Resistant : Lv30 : Zawabababa looks more resistant.  Disciplines are extremely short duration abilities.  I like to think of them as desperation attacks.  Basically you imbue yourself with extremely powerful abilities for a very short length of time (9-18 seconds typically.  Once a discipline has been activated, NO OTHER disciplines can be used until the cycle time on that Discipline has passed.  Cycle times are reduced by 1 minute each time you level (e.g. at level 34 your cycle time for Resistant will decrease by 4 minutes).  Resistant raises all your resistances for 5 minutes, but by a meager 10 points.  Use it at will, it doesn't do much.  Can be useful if you're desprate or want an extra edge against a caster though. Its cycle time is 60 minutes.

<P>Discipline - Fearless : Lv40 : Makes you immune to all fear spells.  This includes Dragon Fear, thus having some decent use unlike Resistant.  Cycle time is 60 minutes.

<P>Discipline - Counterattack : Lv53 : Riposte is great.  It's even better when it happens 100% of the time.  When Counterattack is activated, a rogue will counter every single attack to his front (and only his front) attempted on him.  This lasts 9 seconds and has a 60 minute cycle time.

<P>Discipline - Deadeye : Lv54 : Zawabababa feels unstoppable!  You'd be suprised how much damage is lost in your misses.  Deadeye makes you land every single attack for 14 seconds.  This includes backstabs, making it extremely powerful.  It has a 30 minute cycle time.

<P>***Double Backstab*** : Lv55 : This is starred again like backstab because backstab should be your life. =)  At level 55 you gain the ability to get a double attack on your backstab, allowing you to inflict twice as much pain.  Yum.

<P>Discipline - Nimble : Lv55 : Zawabababa bounces about nimbly.  Great disc, particularily if you find yourself making dangerous pulls or otherwise getting eaten.  Lasts for 12 seconds and has a cycle time of 30 minutes, giving it 2 advantages over counterattack.

<P>Discipline - Kinesthetics : Lv57 : Zawabababa's arms glow with mystical power.  All Double Attack and Dual Wield skill checks will succeed for 18 seconds.  I thought this would be great, but after testing... it doesn't affect Double Backstabs.  Personally I prefer to use Deadeye to guarantee hits on backstabs, it seems to do more damage to me.  Cycle time of 30 minutes.

<P>Discipline - Blinding Speed : Lv58 : Yay, a disc to put you at max speed.  That would be cool if people didn't always have someone around to haste and a Ragebringer to give them 40% in the first place.  I rarely am not at max haste from AQ and RB.  But if you're a level 58 rogue without a haste item or haster this could be useful.  Probably not.  But if you can't get your Ragebringer (let alone another haste item) by level 58 there's something wrong with you. =b  15 seconds duration, 30 minute cycle, like you'll ever use it.

<P>Discipline - Duelist : Lv59 : Ow.  This is the skill that tears things a new... bleh, this is gonna be on a public website, huh?  Anyhow, this discpline will increase damage of all your melee hits.  Greatly.  Especially the backstabs...  If you want a damage disc this is it, people joke that Duelist is superior to a chain bane-ing wizard (2000pt unresistable nukes).  Whether or not they're correct, it's, well, ownage.  12 second duration, 30 second cycle.

<P>***Assassinate*** : Lv60 : I love putting stars by backstab skills.  Spoke with Lady Dae RL about this once... basically it works as follows.  It will not affect any mobs which aren't green to you.  Assassinate is skill checked when you land a double backstab on a target.  If you land that there's a check to see if you land a "triple" backstab (the assassinate), and if that roll succeeds, the mob takes 32000 points of damage.  Hillarious, fun, free, and it leaves a corpse unlike Level 60 instant-death spells (Disintigrate, Banishments).


<P>Equipment Suggestions -

<P>Twink Equipment: Won't bother to mention because if you can make a twink you can read EQ equipment websites.  But I strongly suggest a strong backstabber and a regen and haste item.

<P>Earned equipment: Try to see if you can get someone to make you some banded at low levels.  Get the highest damage piercer you can find to backstab with.  As you level, try to get Ravenscale armor (rogue only) from Cazic Thule.  As far as simple weapon upgrades go, Serrated Bone Dirks aren't too high to aim.  Try to get a Flowing Black Silk Sash (haste sash) out of Lower Guk when you can, or some other haste item.  Haste items increase the refresh of your Backstab as well as your normal attack. Once you hit around 50, try to raid the Plane of Hate for Woven Shadow armor, a huge upgrade.  At higher levels, look into Velious quest armor/Plane of Growth armor, which I would generally rate from best to worst: Deceiver's (Kael), Shadow (Skyshrine), Brigand's (Thurgadin), Assassin's (Plane of Growth).  Ths last two are pretty much the same (if not entirely).  This is just a general outline, there's definitely a lot of equipment pieces inbetween and loads upon loads not listed.  And stuff much better than even Deceiver's armor.  But I'm not going to list off items for 4 pages, you have a web browser, look on Eqlizer or whatever. =b


<P>Leveling Suggestions -

<P>Best places to level for EXP only (you might wanna hit some other zones for items still):

<P>1-10 : Misty Thicket<BR>
11-15 : Deserts of Ro and Oasis, or Field of Bone if you don't mind being in hostile territory<BR>
16-26 : Lake of Ill Omen<BR>
27-35 : Frontier Mountains (not the giant fort for **** sake! they're the worst exp in the zone.. find the sarnak ruins)<BR>
36-41 : Overthere<BR>
42-45 : Sol B Pool Room.  Say what you will but you can do 45 in 5 hours there with a good group of 4.<BR>
46-50 : Dreadlands<BR>
51-52 : Karnor<BR>
53+ : Sebilis, The Hole, Howling Stones.  Again noone believes me but The Hole is the best exp zone in the game (though slightly worse when Crusaders get green at 56 or 57), mobs that fight like LDCs and give exp like Krups.<BR>

<P>This is just my experience with these areas.  Yours may differ, please don't bother sending me anything about how I should have listed Sol A as the greatest zone ever or whatever because I will block your ip for email, block your screen name for AIM, block your ICQ UIN, or whatever. =b  I know this isn't perfect, but deal with it!


<P>Tactics -

<P>Make an Evade macro.  Script a social button with /doability (1-10), /autoattack on, and /autoattack off commands so that you can turn off attack, hide, activate a few skills (I like things like Hide and Disarm), then turn attack back on.

<P>Stun circles.  Can't get a group?  Grab your favorite cleric friend you trust and have them stun, while you circle around the mob and backstab it.  Just takes some getting used to with strafing, fun to do for a little while and a good tactic.  Great for when the warrior goes LD too, after all, you do most of the damage anyhow!

<P>Stay as far away from mobs as possible.  Aggro is HUGELY determined by your proximity to the mob, so always be just *barely* in melee range.

<P>Use your evade wisely.  Sometimes evading isn't the best thing.  Rogue AC actually doesn't suck THAT much.  Even without decent gear I think I'm up to 1055 or so at 57.  While that might equivilate to alluminum armor, remember that the ranger next to you is wearing paper mache armor and the enchanter is protected by high density dental floss.

<P>Chose your groups wisely.  Everyone says Warriors are the shiznit.  Generally this isn't true with a rogue.  SKs the best tank to compliment rogues, because they are the one tank class who can hold the aggro off of you.  Less aggro = More backstab, and less non-melee evading time.

<P>Recognise what you can do with small groups.  Rogues are perfect for small exp groups.  Don't grab 6 people if you don't need it!  Just you, a tank, a cleric, and an enchanter are an ideal group right there!  Rogues do more damage than several melees combined, so when you're there, you don't always need 6.  An extension of this is duoing with a rogue, either with someone stunning for you or with a Shaman slowing and/or tanking as you tatter that ratman warrior.

<P>These are just a few things.  There's really a lot more, especially PvP (though I'm not qualified to speak on these as I play on a happy treehugging server) tactics.  But I hope these will get you started!


<P>Ragebringer -

<P>Your sweet sweet candy.  This is the rogue epic.  Back when this quest first was implemented, I said that it was ridiculously easy and people yelled at me.  Then I made a rogue.  Guess what?  It IS ridiculously easy!  With very little clue of what I was doing, I obtained one in half a day.  IMHO that's the biggest joke of an epic quest I've ever heard.  But the effect is pretty bad (particularily with new higher haste items from Velious), so I guess it balances out.  Personally I wish their was a harder version of Ragebringer with a better effect... Anyhow.

<P>The stats: 15/25, 20str 10dex 10sta 10agi 10disease 20magic 100hps 2lbs.  Effect of Seething Fury (40%haste, 40atk, 9ac).  This is your rifle, this is your gun.  There is only one other backstabber that has over 13dmg on it in the game, and it has 0 stats, a high delay, and comes off of the Djorn or OOA in Sky.  So love thy Ragebringer, for it is thine best backstabber.

<P>The quest is fairly easy and can be found on the Safehouse web page or Castersrealm among other sites.  I'd rather not give everything away, if you really want just read those sites.  But it is EXTREMELY easy.  You must be level 50 to do most of this quest.


<P>Good luck to you, young stabbers and killers!
