     <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8"><font face="Verdana" size="2">How
     to start and have a good LARGE RACE WARRIOR, an essay.<br>
     <br>
     Before we begin, these are my own experiences, and I in no way guarantee
     success using these tactics and tips, only that it worked for me and I'm
     very happy.<br>
     <br>
     I know for a fact that warriors are the backbone of any RPG. I originally
     started a Barbarian warrior. I chose that race for several reasons.
     Barbarian's are a large race with a naturally high STRENGTH, a natural
     ability to slam, they are widely accepted in most cities, and most
     importantly, I liked the way Barbarians looked. So, I go to create my
     warrior, and like most new folks, I created a warrior with high STRENGTH
     and put the rest of my points into STAMINA. I was thinking that these were
     the most important attributes to the foundation of a good warrior. However,
     after having attained level 18 through much bloodshed and deaths, I came to
     the realization that warriors are really hard to play and level up if you
     are constantly getting your butt kicked. Something else was amiss here. I
     found it hard to believe that the developers to this game would purposely
     make warriors a weak class. I wasn't looking at the big picture, I think.<br>
     <br>
     There had to be a solution beyond the &quot;lets revamp the warriors&quot;
     one. Now, naturally, there are some areas that DO need some tweaking, but
     overall the warrior isn't really as bad as everyone is screaming about.<br>
     <br>
     Being the typical engineer, I did some research. What did I find out? Well,
     to begin with, the starting attributes I should have selected to pump up
     for a LARGE RACE warrior were AGILITY and DEXTERITY.<br>
     <br>
     What's that? Come again?<br>
     <br>
     Yes, you read correctly, AGILITY and DEXTERITY. How did I find this out?
     Well, by reading all those message boards and getting answers in game from
     some high level warriors I've run into. The articles I've read that were
     the most intriguing were articles about Halfling warriors and their high
     AGILITY that are not taking any damage during fights. Interesting I
     thought, tell me more. I found out that STRENGTH for a LARGE RACE warrior
     just means you get to carry more things, it doesn't always help with
     damage. I know, some of you are going to yell about not being able to do
     maximum damage and some of you are gonna yell about not having enough
     strength to carry armor, but trust me and just read on, you'll be impressed
     I promise.<br>
     <br>
     The idea behind STRENGTH is this (information given to me by J.C.Smith of
     EQ'lizer):<br>
     <br>
     &quot;1 STRENGTH = 1 Attack. So when you're talking about the difference
     between say a Halfling warrior with 80 STRENGTH and an Ogre warrior with
     150 STRENGTH that's a 70 point attack difference. 70 points of attack is
     about the attack equivalent of 4-5 levels.&quot;<br>
     <br>
     While I don't doubt the validity of the formula, the attack level of a
     Barbarian (and the other LARGE races) is already high because of naturally
     high STRENGTH. So saying this, the actual point difference per hit is in
     the range of 5 to 15 points (ROUGHLY) of extra damage per actual HIT. My
     argument is that I would much rather avoid most 90+ hits from say, a Hill
     Giant, than to dish out an extra 100 to 300 points (ROUGHLY) per fight.
     Why? Because I figure that after that Hill Giant has hit you for the tenth
     time for 90+ damage, you might be thinking a little bit differently at this
     point.<br>
     <br>
     Why would you think differently? Well, the Hill Giant just took 100 to 300
     points extra damage, whereas you have just taken 900. Lets face it, this is
     not a good trade-off. The argument about STAMINA is the same. If you aren't
     taking as much damage then not having a high amount of hit points is a moot
     point. Of course, there are always going to be unique situations where this
     might no be the case.<br>
     <br>
     Ok, so let me continue to rebuff the argument about needing alot of
     STRENGTH. Having played the warrior to level 18 I found out that the little
     &quot;strength less than 90&quot; Halfling was doing the same damage I was
     doing with a STRENGTH of 130. Hmmm ... lets see here ... Same damage? ...
     After talking to some level 20+ warriors and picking their brains about
     whether or not you received a STRENGTH bonus to damage after level 20, and
     getting a negative response from some, or a response of &quot;not enough to
     make it worth it&quot; from others, I thought &quot;hmmm ... interesting
     ...&quot; As far as STRENGTH making a difference wearing plate, my response
     is this: Whom can afford the plate sold in stores, and what make you think
     that plate is the best armor anyway? Yes, plate armor does tend to absorb
     more hits than other types of armor, but there are some trade-offs worth
     noting.&nbsp;<br>
     <br>
     Example: I sold my Bronze plated cloak for a Lizardscale cloak. I get the
     SAME AC as plate, but with a fraction of the weight and a plus 5 to
     DEXTERITY. That is MUCH better stuff and is MUCH lighter. So don't be too
     worried about STRENGTH, don't be a fool and discount it all together, but
     just know that as a LARGE RACE warrior, AGILITY and DEXTERITY are much more
     worth the extra build points. I then said to myself what the heck, and
     recreated my character and I am now Faman Wrathblade, Barbarian warrior
     with high AGILITY and good STRENGTH and DEXTERITY. I've never looked back
     since.<br>
     <br>
     As it stands now I have acquired two plus 5 AGILITY rings (player made), a
     necklace of plus 7 to both DEXTERITY and AGILITY (player made), Snakeskin
     gloves with a plus 3 DEXTERITY, a Grotesque Mask with plus 7 DEXTERITY,
     Barbed Armplates with plus 2 DEXTERITY and the Lizardscale cloak I
     mentioned earlier with the plus 5 to DEXTERITY. At level 25 now, my warrior
     has an unbuffed AGILITY of 124, and an unbuffed DEXTERITY of 94. Not the
     greatest stats of them all but, let me tell you, what a difference I have
     seen. Also, because of the large race being used (Barbarian), the starting
     STRENGTH of 113 is a good start point. I actually added 5 to STRENGTH and
     not DEXTERITY thinking that there were more DEXTERITY enhancing items than
     STRENGTH. So my STRENGTH is not high but respectable at 118. Ogres and
     Trolls have an even higher starting STRENGTH, so they have an even bigger
     advantage.<br>
     <br>
     Now, I hit alot more often and still get the maximum damage just as much.
     When I dual wield my third attack hits quite a few times, and I know my
     fourth attack will kick in as well alot(once the skill is high enough). My
     Polished Granite Tomahawk goes off AT LEAST twice and up to six or seven
     times every fight. And god forbid I get some buff spells cast on me by
     anyone that gives me even higher DEXTERITY and AGILITY ... Woohoo daddy I'm
     a wrecking machine! The mobs miss me a heck of alot more too. I get quite a
     few dodges and misses EVERY fight. Now its not like I'm going after Hill
     Giants and such, but if I have to fight ANYTHING that cons blue, with the
     exception of a very few select creatures, I waste them. Sometimes I take a
     little more than a few bubbles of damage, most times even less than that.
     As far as yellow cons go, I can beat some of those DEPENDING on what it is
     and what weapon(s) I am using. Red cons, however, are hard to judge because
     you can't really tell what level they are above you, so I usually stay away
     from them unless I'm in a group.<br>
     <br>
     Bottom line: High AGILITY makes the monster miss ALOT more and you dodge
     ALOT more. Higher DEXTERITY helps you hit ALOT more, dual wield ALOT more,
     double attack ALOT more, and your magic weapon(s) goes off ALOT more. Also,
     with the possible implementation of critical hits, which attribute do you
     think will make the critical hits occur? Yes, you guessed it, DEXTERITY.<br>
     <br>
     Enough said?<br>
     <br>
     Ok at this point let me say this, THESE ATTRIBUTES HELP YOU TO SURVIVE AND
     COMPETE BETTER IN THIS GAME, THEY DO NOT MAKE YOU A GOD. I felt that I need
     to say that. I didn't need anyone coming to me later and saying I lied to
     them. What I'm trying to say is that you still need to have a good
     understanding of how to play the warrior too. Having great stats alone is
     not going to make you a better warrior. Warriors are not the simple
     &quot;hit the attack button and sit back and read a book character&quot;
     that everyone thinks they are. There are definite strategies and abilities
     that warriors are the best at. YES, I actually did say that warriors have
     something they are best at, and after having read about how &quot;this
     warrior sucks because of this&quot; and &quot;that warrior sucks because of
     that&quot;, I decided that this needed to be written so that people
     wouldn't be discouraged by a few individuals that<br>
     don't know how to REALLY play the class. Yes, I know that I'm not a hugely
     high level (level 25), but I've had so many less deaths and sweated so much
     less blood with this guy that I cant see things going sour in the future.<br>
     <br>
     Let me continue.<br>
     <br>
     A warrior must know alot of things. He must know what weapons best go with
     which adversary. He must know whether it is time to use a two handed blade,
     or when to dual wield two swords. He must know when to use bash as opposed
     to when to use kick. He must have bind wound, he must have archery, and he
     must have taunt. He must know when to attack like a madman and when to back
     out a bit. Use your brain in combat. The warrior must not fear death, but
     embrace it as a learning experience. Sounds a little scary? Well, it is.<br>
     <br>
     Onward ...<br>
     <br>
     Don't listen to the idiot that tells you two handed weapons are the only
     way, or the one that says one-handed weapons are the only way.<br>
     <br>
     LEARN THEM ALL.<br>
     <br>
     It doesn't take very long to become proficient in each of them. If you are
     creating a warrior that is only proficient in one weapon skill, you are
     doing yourself, your future group, and the character you are creating a
     great disservice. Also, don't worry about your low level of INTELLIGENCE.
     You will learn all the combat skills just as quickly. How, you might ask?<br>
     <br>
     Well, what does a warrior do? He is constantly swinging a weapon. He is
     constantly kicking, taunting, bashing, and binding wound. You will be
     surprised once you try this and see that because of the amount of
     repetitious acts the warrior must do to survive, his COMBAT SKILLS will go
     up just as fast as anyone else, regardless of the intelligence he has.<br>
     <br>
     LEARN ALL THE ABOVE SKILLS. ALL OF THEM. TOTAL. EVERY ONE. Did I make
     myself clear?<br>
     <br>
     One of the skills that I cant seem to stress enough is archery. It's a
     warrior's long range attack. It is a MUST have skill. You are that much
     more diversified and deadly if you can use a bow well. Later in the game
     when you have acquired some wealth, you will definitely want to buy a good
     bow with high damage and long range. The benefits from a good bow and the
     skills to match shine during fierce group fights when you are down to very
     low health. You can back out of the infighting, and still dish out some
     decent damage (with higher archery skill). It's also a GREAT luring weapon.
     I can also beat ANY caster to the punch using my bow. I can lure creatures
     WITHOUT having to go up to them and hit them with my weapon. This in itself
     is a huge plus.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
     <br>
     I will finish up here by saying this: These stats are the best combination
     of stats and skills that I have come up with by experimentation, and I bet
     you will find that the ideas presented here will really help you in the
     long run. I know they made a WORLD of difference to me and my group and
     most importantly, my warrior. Have fun playing this game and don't lose
     sight of the fact that there are real people behind those characters you
     see on the screen, and most importantly remember this one fact: its only a
     game, have fun.<br>
