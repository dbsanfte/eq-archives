     <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Paladins
     are the holy knights of Norrath. They stand for all that is good and just,
     and they will destroy all that is unholy and evil. A true paladin will
     never leave a comrade behind and will stand and fight until all of his
     allies have escaped. A true paladin will treat others with respect and will
     give his life to save another's. The paladin is a strict follower of the
     code of chivalry and as such it is perhaps the hardest class to properly
     role play in the game.<br>
     <br>
     Not only can the role of paladin be mentally challenging it can also be
     very difficult from the pure gaming aspect. Paladins are 3/4 warrior and
     1/4 cleric. At higher levels this can be a very powerful combination but at
     lower levels things will prove to be very difficult. You suffer a 25%
     experience penalty for being a hybrid which means that you will usually
     level slower than most other classes.<br>
     <br>
     The hardest task of a paladin compared to other classes will be reaching
     level 9. At level 9 you receive your spells and things will begin to get
     much better for you. Until that time you are basically a warrior who does
     not have the benefit of kick and has 3 less hit points per level. At level
     6 warriors get dodge which you will not see until level 10 further widening
     the gap between the two classes.<br>
     <br>
     The saving grace of low level paladins is the ability to Lay Hands. This
     allows you to heal close to 1000 hit points even at low levels. You can
     only use this skill once per game day(about every 1 1/2 hours in realtime)
     so you will want to use this only in emergencies. I've seen some paladins
     use this skill to try to take monsters that are normally too difficult to
     kill figuring it can nearly double their hit points. This is a mistake in
     this paladin's opinion. You should always keep this for emergencies. You
     never know when you or more importantly someone else will need you to lay
     hands to prevent death.<br>
     <br>
     At level 9 you will gain your first spells. The spells that you can cast at
     this level are the same spells that a cleric can cast at level 1 although
     you will not gain the benefit of using all of the spells of any circle.
     Paladins get the most important cleric spells however and this is key. You
     get all three lines of cleric buffing spells(though you won't gain the
     third line until level 30). This is great if you are soloing or if your
     party does not have a cleric along. These spells grant you additional armor
     class and hit points and are perhaps your second most important type of
     spells.<br>
     <br>
     By far your most important type of spells are your healing spells. At level
     9 you get minor healing which will reduce the time you will have to sit and
     rest and also allow you to heal yourself in combat to some extent. At level
     15 you get lesser healing which is the same spell that level 15 druids and
     shamans will still be using. You are the only hybrid class that will ever
     be able to cast greater heal which is also very helpful. Though a paladin
     is not as good of a healer as any of the pure priest classes your healing
     spells are important for two reasons. First and foremost they cut down
     resting time if you are soloing or do not have the benefit of a priest type
     class in your party. Secondly they can be a lifesaver when the going gets
     tough. I can recall a time when we were fighting a hill giant and things
     were going sourly. We thought our tank would surely die as both the cleric
     and the druid were totally out of mana. At that point our paladin calmly
     stepped back and began healing the tank. By the time he had run out of mana
     both the cleric and the druid had regained enough mana to get off another
     greater heal and we won the encounter.<br>
     <br>
     In my opinion your third most valuable line of spells is the ward undead
     line of spells. These spells make paladins very effective when soloing(and
     no less effective when grouping) undead beasts. Only clerics and
     necromancers can outperform paladins when it comes to these beasts. Sure
     pure casters such as wizards can outdamage you spell wise but when you add
     up the damage you can do with your weapons plus the damage you can do with
     your spells and add the amount of damage you can take I would take the
     paladin in this encounter 7 days of the week and twice on Sunday.<br>
     <br>
     At level 22 paladins get the root spell. This is very important if you
     don't have another player in your party who can cast it and a neccessity if
     you are soloing in dungeons. This spell will prevent those monsters from
     running away until you can finish them off.<br>
     <br>
     A very underated line of paladin spells is the lull-&gt;soothe-&gt;calm
     spells. These spells allow you to walk past normally aggressive monsters
     and more importantly allow you to calm a few members of a group of monsters
     so you can pull one away and fight it alone.<br>
     <br>
     Another line of paladin spells is the yalup and yalup 2 spells. These
     spells only last for a short period of time but give the paladin a strength
     and armor class bonus. Since they use a relatively low amount of mana they
     can be a great addition to your spell collection.<br>
     <br>
     Level 22 sees the addition of invisibility to undead. This spell can be a
     big help in undead dungeons as it allows you to bypass the monsters you do
     not want and get to the ones you do. It also allows you to do some recon on
     an area if you haven't been there before.<br>
     <br>
     At level 39 you get the cancel magic spell. This spell is plain and simple
     a lifesaver. There are times during the game when someone in your party
     will get charmed or rooted and death will appear a certainty. Cancel magic
     allows you to cancel the spell effect(though it may take a few casts) and
     save their lives. It also can be used on yourself when you are suffering
     from those particularly nasty spells such as blood boil.<br>
     <br>
     The rest of the paladin spells are a mixed bag of cure spells, endurance
     spells(which give a player a bonus to his saving throws) and a couple of
     utility spells(such as reckless strength). A couple notable exceptions are
     holy might(which you gain at level 49) which is a stun spell which also
     does a small amount of damage, spook the dead which is a fear spell that
     affects undead beasts and hammer of wrath(level 15) which summons a magical
     warhammer which can be useful at that level.<br>
     <br>
     Now that we have covered the cleric side of things let's cover the warrior
     side. Paladins gain all of the attacks that a warrior does with the
     exception of kick and duel wield. The catch here is that they receive these
     skills 3-5 levels later than a warrior.<br>
     <br>
     At level 6 you get the bash skill. Bash is the only secondary attack you
     will ever gain as a paladin so it is important. The problem with bash is
     that it requires a shield to use. Basically this reduces paladins to using
     one handed weapons or else forfeiting their only secondary attack. So how
     does bash compare to kick? It does a bit less damage especially at lower
     levels but it does stun your opponent.<br>
     <br>
     At level 10 you get the dodge and bind wounds skills. Bound wounds is
     utterly useless at this level because you can already heal yourself. Bind
     wounds does not heal very much damage, it takes time to do and it requires
     a bandage(which can get costly). It is also very ineffective at lower
     levels. You will doubtfully ever use this skill. Dodge however is very
     useful. This skill causes you to get hit less and anything that can do that
     is a welcome addition.<br>
     <br>
     Level 14 grants the meditate skill. This is NOT a meelee skill it is a
     skill that allows you to regain your mana faster.<br>
     <br>
     You get parry at level 17. This skill is much like dodge in that it allows
     you to get hit less and thus is a very welcome addition. Fighters gain the
     parry skill at level 12 so if you want to compete with them as a tank this
     is an important level.<br>
     <br>
     At level 20 you get the most important of your meelee skills. This is the
     ability to double attack. At level 15 warriors get the ability to both duel
     wield and double attack and become much more effective at damaging their
     opponents than you are. While you can never duel wield double attack will
     allow you to close the gap between a paladin and a warrior in dishing
     damage.<br>
     <br>
     A paladin gains the riposte skill at level 30. This skill will cause you to
     get hit less similar to dodge and parry.<br>
     <br>
     The last of your meelee skills is gained at level 40. This is the disarm
     skill. This allows you to knock a weapon from your opponents hands. NPC's
     hit harder when they are wielding a weapon so this winds up being a very
     effective attack. Not only does it cause you to take less damage but it
     also allows you to pick their weapon off of the ground and use it or steal
     it.<br>
     <br>
     Paladins can use most of the weapons in the game and can also wear most of
     the armor including platemail. Paladins also get some very special weapons
     in the form of their holy swords. The first of these swords is ghoulbane.
     This weapon is not only very powerful damage and speed wise but it also
     randomly casts dismiss undead which will cripple your undead foes in no
     time. Higher level weapons have not been discovered at the time this guide
     is being written but I have no doubt the fiery avenger will be nothing
     short of astounding.<br>
     <br>
     So what race makes the best paladins? This is really subjective. Dwarves
     have all the right ability skills and also have infravision(they are my
     personal favorite). They pay for this however in the form of an experience
     penalty. High elves can also be paladins however they have low base
     strength and this can hurt when it comes to the warrior side of things.
     When all is said and done most paladins are human. They are the middle
     ground and level faster than the other races.<br>
     <br>
     To play a paladin you have to be a certain breed of player. To properly
     role play the class you have to be prepared to give your own life to save
     the life of others and you can expect to be outleveled by most of your
     friends early on. You will never be as good in battle as a warrior and your
     spells can not come close to those of a clerics. However the parts of the
     two can be greater than the whole of the others if you play this class
     properly at higher levels. To get the most of this class you have to be
     prepared to spend a lot of time to reach the higher levels of the game.
     When you do however you will be rewarded with one of the most powerful and
     one of the funnest classes in the game.<br>
