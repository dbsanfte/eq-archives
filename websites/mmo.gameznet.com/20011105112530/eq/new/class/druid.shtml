            If there is one class in Everquest that can do it all it is
            certainly the druid. Druids are the masters of nature and certainly
            have no match in their domain. However they are also adept
            adventurer's indoors as well in that they can fill many different
            roles in a party. If your idea of a good time is being a jack of all
            trades then a druid is the class for you.<br>
            <br>
            To illustrate what I mean here let's look at various classes and
            their strengths and compare them to a druid:<br>
            <br>
            <a href="http://gameznet.com/eq/class/cleric.html">Clerics</a> are
            great role players. Their strengths are in their buffing spells,
            their ability to fight undead and their ability to heal. They also
            have the unique ability to be able to ressurect dead players. Druids
            can not ressurect and do not get specialist spells versus undead.
            They do however get pretty good buffing spells and healing spells.
            Generally druids get the same healing spells as a cleric only one
            circle later. They do not however get the complete heal spell that
            is cleric specific.<br>
            <br>
            <a href="http://gameznet.com/eq/class/wizard.html">Wizards</a> are
            powerful casters whose mastery is in dishing damage. Wizards also
            have great teleport and group teleport spells up to and including
            teleportation into other planes. While no class can match a wizard
            in mana:damage efficiency druids can go toe to toe with just about
            every other class in the game. Other classes will trade positions
            from time to time as they get new and more powerful spells however
            druids never fall too far behind.<br>
            <br>
            <a href="http://gameznet.com/eq/class/ranger.html">Rangers</a> are
            the other nature loving class in the game. Rangers are 3/4 warrior
            and 1/4 druid. They also have the forage and tracking skills. Druids
            get these same skills only at later levels. This means that druids
            will not have to worry about spending money on food or water or
            returning to town as a neccessity to buy these products. It also
            means that druids will have a leg up over every class other than
            rangers when it comes to tracking down outdoor animals. Likewise
            animals are not naturally agressive to druids. That wolf that will
            attack most other classes will leave you alone.<br>
            <br>
            <a href="http://gameznet.com/eq/class/magician.html">Magicians</a>
            specialize in their pets and their ability to summon things such as
            food, water and bandages. They also have good damage shields which
            will punish the monster for hitting a player as well as a ward
            series of spells versus summoned beasts(elements). Druids get damage
            shields that can rival those of a magician. They can also charm
            animals and use them as pets. Druids can forage which renders
            summoned food and drink useless. Summoned food and drink will
            dissapear when you log out. Foraged food will not. Magicians summon
            spells are actually spells inherited from druids. Druids get these
            same ward summoned spells a couple circles earlier than magicians
            and at the same level range that clerics get their ward undead
            spells.<br>
            <br>
            <a href="http://gameznet.com/eq/class/enchanter.html">Enchanters</a>
            specialize in illusion and charm spells. Druids are never able to
            touch the former but the latter is acquired for taming animals. This
            allows druids to tame those mighty <a href="file:///E:/gameznet/eq/class/druid.html/../beastiary/griffon.html">griffons</a>
            and use them to do your dirty work for you.<br>
            <br>
            <a href="http://gameznet.com/eq/class/necromancer.html">Necromancers</a>
            have two main areas of expertise. One is their mastery of undead and
            the other is their Damage over Time(DoT) spells. Druids have no
            mastery over undead however they do have a mastery over summoned
            beasts. There are many less summoned monsters in the world however
            druids can quickly dispose of those that exist. Druids have powerful
            DoT spells in the form of the stinging swarm line of spells. These
            will eat away at monsters over a period of time.<br>
            <br>
            On the equipment side of things druids are somewhere between a
            mage-type class and a priest class. They can wear up to leather type
            armor but cannot wear metal armor. They can wear both <a href="file:///E:/gameznet/eq/class/druid.html/../equipment/lupinearmor.html">lupine</a>
            and <a href="file:///E:/gameznet/eq/class/druid.html/../equipment/bonearmor.html">bone</a>
            armor however which is in many players eyes better than the much
            ballyhooed <a href="file:///E:/gameznet/eq/class/druid.html/../equipment/plate.html">platemail</a>.
            Weapons wise they have a have a big leg up on mage types class and a
            small bonus with regards to other priest classes. They can use one
            or two handed blunt weapons and also can use scimitars. This may not
            seem like a big bonus at lower levels however there are several
            higher level magic scimitars that druids will be able to take
            advantage of including a rumored druid only scimitar.<br>
            <br>
            That all having been said you will probably be wondering why druids
            are stronger outdoors than indoors? Several of the druids most
            popular spells are outdoor only. For example you will not be able to
            conjure lightning indoors. Also you will not be able to use spirit
            of the wolf(a very popular travel spell) indoors. You will not be
            able to cast invisibility until higher levels as your level 5
            camoflauge spell will not work in indoor zones. The only real
            disadvantage here is that outdoor monsters give 25% less experience
            than their indoor counterparts and for good reason. One of the more
            popular druid tactics is what is known as kiting. The druid will use
            spirit of the wolf to outrun their prey while their stinging swarm
            line of spells will slowly eat away at the beast until it is dead.
            It is a low risk tactic which is very cheesy yet still very
            effective.<br>
            <br>
            Things will be slow going in the early levels until you get meditate
            at level 8. Once you get meditate however things will really begin
            rolling. At level 15 you will gain the ability to dodge which will
            help you avoid punishment. It maxes at a rather low level though and
            will not be nearly as effective as the dodging ability of meelee
            classes.<br>
            <br>
            At level 20 you get the ability to track which is a major addition.
            Tracking will allow you to find those rare NPC's in the large
            outdoor zones who carry those rare and powerful magic items such as <a href="http://gameznet.com/eq/equipment/mroonsdoll.html">Mroon's
            Doll</a>. It will also allow you to keep track of monsters in
            dungeons. For example if you are waiting for the emporer to spawn
            but don't want to wander into his anti camp radius to find out you
            can use tracking to check to see if he's on your scope. When he pops
            then you go kill him.<br>
            <br>
            At level 30 you gain the ability to specialize in a certain field of
            magic. This will allow you to be most effective in one field say for
            example conjuration or evocation.<br>
            <br>
            The most important thing about playing a druid is to play to your
            classes strengths. Use your DoT spells, take advantage of your
            teleport spells, use your thorns on your party members. You can play
            the role of a cleric, wizard, magician, necromancer or ranger
            depending on the situation. You are a welcome addition to any party
            because you can fill so many roles.<br>
            <br>
            So you think you want to be a druid but don't know which race you
            should choose? The race most fit to be a druid would be the <a href="http://gameznet.com/eq/race/woodelf.html">wood
            elves</a> with <a href="http://gameznet.com/eq/race/halfling.html">halflings</a>
            coming in a close second. You really can't lose with either of these
            choices. Wood elves have slightly better statistics for being a
            druid but their city can be confusing and a wrong turn can result in
            death at lower levels(its a long fall from the &quot;ewok
            village&quot;). The halflings newbie zone(<a href="http://gameznet.com/eq/zone/mistythicket.html">misty
            thicket</a>) is much less crowded and probably a better overall zone
            that <a href="http://gameznet.com/eq/zone/greaterfay.html">greater
            faydark</a> which the wood elves must share with the <a href="http://gameznet.com/eq/race/highelf.html">high
            elves</a>. Misty thicket is also quite a bit less confusing. The
            only saving grace of greater faydark is the fact that <a href="http://gameznet.com/eq/zone/crushbone.html">Crushbone</a>
            is only a short distance from the wood elf village. Crushbone is an
            excellent dungeon for young druids as all of the magical items found
            there with the exception of the dwarven ringmail are great druid
            items.<br>
            <br>
            What it all boils down to is that druids are a fine class. They can
            do a little bit of everything which will keep them from becoming
            boring. They can fill in as a tank at lower levels when their
            fighting skills are not too far behind those of a meelee classes and
            can fill in several different caster roles at the higher levels.
            Perhaps most importantly their group travel spells can save a
            parties life when things get hairy at higher levels. Druids truly
            are one of the finest classes in the game.</p>
