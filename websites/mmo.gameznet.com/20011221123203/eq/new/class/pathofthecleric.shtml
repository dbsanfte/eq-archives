     guide was submitted by: Adrek Dawnfire<br>
     <br>
     Several guides have been written on the Cleric class, so you may not see
     why another is needed. I have always felt that most guides are incomplete
     or give an overly simplistic definition of the life of a Cleric. I have
     also read too many times that it is not a fun or glorious life, but I
     totally disagree. So I decided to share my own views and impressions on the
     greatest healing class of Norrath. This guide is a good overall review of
     the class’ abilities, however it is not written for total newbies, so I
     will not take the time to explain the uses and level requirements of basic
     skills such as meditate or channeling. I will not give either any sort of
     walkthrough that is supposed, in theory, to help advance faster through the
     early levels. I will however explain in detail the various spells lines and
     abilities at our disposal.</font></p>
     <p align="justify" style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8"><font face="Verdana" size="2">For
     those who hadn’t noticed it so far, Clerics are the best healers in
     EverQuest, they have access to more healing spells than any other class and
     at lower levels than others. During most of your career, except perhaps the
     lowest levels, your main duty will be to heal others and keep your group
     alive, if this does sound boring for you, I advise stopping reading here
     and creating a necromancer. It is true that it might not be the favorite
     path of most players, but it shouldn’t be either. I believe most clerics
     belong to a different breed of players, a category of more social and
     helpful people, because these qualities are necessary to be successful in
     our profession. It is true that most of our time will be spent with the
     nose in our spell books trying to get mana, it is true that in the heat of
     battle, and our main spell will be healing. However, I dare anyone to tell
     me these heals are less needed than the warrior taking the blows or the
     wizard calling the elements to our help. Monks might get praise</font></p>
     <p align="justify" style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Now
     that this has been said, lets begin, shall we? I will start by describing
     the abilities, strengths and weaknesses or the class. It should be noted
     that Clerics receive their spell circles, and their skills, at the same
     rate as the other priest classes, Druids and Shamans. First of all, if
     melee combat is important to you, I advise choosing a true melee class or
     an hybrid, because although they can wear platemail and wield some very
     good blunt weapons, Clerics in EverQuest are definitely not very strong in
     that aspect of things. They will hold their ground until about level 15 and
     remain able to take some hits and inflict some damage until about level 25.
     After that point, however, Clerics will become unable to be efficient at
     all in melee combat except maybe for short periods of tanking to take some
     heat off the main tanks. So, in the end, Clerics are pure casters, and
     their melee abilities are minimal. This is why Wisdom is by far more
     important than any other statistic for Clerics. The ability to wear
     platemail remains a true advantage though, as it allows you to wear tons of
     equipment that other casters cannot use, such as Adamantite epaulets.</font></p>
     <p align="justify" style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Now,
     let’s get to the interesting part: the spells. The first and main line of
     Cleric spells is the healing spells, from minor healing to complete
     healing, they are the main weapon in your arsenal. They allow you to keep
     yourself and your group fighting longer against the toughest monsters and
     live to see another day. Remember that healing will be your main duty
     through your life, so you have to know exactly how it works, know the
     casting times intuitively, etc. An important note is that heals works as AE
     taunts, and if you heal too much, monsters might aggro on you, causing a
     swift death if the warriors are not able to relieve you quickly. There is
     also a separate line that can heal your entire group, the Word of health
     series, that Clerics receive late in their life but that can be a lifesaver
     if used properly. Still in the healing lines, Clerics get the ability to
     cure poisons and diseases, which are useful but rarely vital except against
     some very powerful poisons. Perhaps the most needed of the healing
     abilities, that always makes high level clerics in high demand, are the
     revive lines that allows us to bring a fallen comrade back to his corpse,
     alive, and at higher levels, that also allows to restore some of the
     experience lost upon death. The healing abilities are indeed the most
     critical ones, especially at high levels, and they have lead some people to
     think that Clerics were only band-aids for their group. However an
     efficient use of the other abilities to our disposal can make us much, much
     more deadly for our foes… and much more useful for our group.</font></p>
     <p align="justify" style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8"><font face="Verdana" size="2">The
     second ability of Clerics, that is almost as important as healing, is
     buffing. Clerics receive three separate and stackable lines of buffing
     spells, as well as resistance buffs. First the main line, from Courage to
     Resolution will increase the HP and AC of the target, the most
     underestimated line, the Holy Armor line that increase the AC of your tanks
     and finally the costly Symbol line that requires to spend a precious stone
     everytime you use it, but that can add tremendous quantities of hit points
     to your tanks. The resistance buffs are also quite useful in specific
     situations but only the most patient or foolish of clerics will try to keep
     the 5 buffs on at all times on their entire party. Clerics also receive a
     self only combat buff, Yaulp, which is very useful, especially as an
     abjuration trainer, during the early levels, the upgrades are however much
     less useful since almost no melee battle is done at the levels where they
     are obtained. Since its somewhat of a buffing spell I will also speak on
     the Divine Aura and Divine Barrier spells here. These long recast time
     spells give you temporary invulnerability against everything but stuns for
     a short period of time. The upgrade, divine barrier also allows you to
     regenerate hp and mana while invulnerable at a fast rate. I keep these two
     spells memorized at all times, they saved my life, or sometimes my entire
     party, by allowing me to stay alive and keep healing, so many times that
     its not even funny.</font></p>
     <p align="justify" style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Let
     now see what offensive spells we have to our disposal: lets start with
     offensive spells. We have three lines of offensive spells, first, the VS.
     Everything DD spell, the strike-retribution line. Highly inefficient in
     most situations, especially in groups. Mostly used when soloing, which is
     definitely not the forte of a Cleric. The two other lines however are much
     more interesting: the VS. Undead line allows us to attack efficiently
     undead foes with mana/dmg ratios similar to those of a Wizard. It is not
     only useful when soloing but it’s also worth using in groups, especially
     against undead casters to bring them to their knees quickly. In an undead
     dungeon, it gives us a purpose once we are full mana with everyone in good
     condition. The last but not least, there is the stun lines. Highly resisted
     but fast to cast and very useful in groups to give a few seconds of free
     beating to tanks, or to interrupt a caster in a DD that would have forced
     us to cast a greater healing spell. The re-cast time is slow, so a few
     clerics who can spare the slot keep several stuns memorized and chain cast
     them to keep casters stunned at all times. It is definitely an underrated
     line that I still use at level 50. I do not recommend trying to stun
     yellows or low reds though, unless they are MR de-buffed, the success rate
     would be ridiculously low.</font></p>
     <p align="justify" style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Finally,
     I will explain the use of our crowd control spells. Although somewhat
     useless with an enchanter in the group, the spells could be of critical
     importance if you are the only one able to use them in the group. They
     include the fear series which allows you to make monsters run away for a
     short period of time to deal with their friends first, be warned that they
     may come back with friends though, very dangerous in a dungeon. Clerics
     also receive a VS. Undead variant of this line, spook the dead, which is
     more efficient but which can only be used against undead targets. Another
     vital line is the Lull line that allows a Cleric to calm some foes and make
     sure they will not harm you while you pass nearby or slaughter their
     friends. Finally, there is the root spell that could arguably fit in this
     category, it prevents a monster from moving. Snare, a druid/ranger ability
     is much more useful to prevent monsters from running, so no one should root
     if a member of one of these classes is present in the group.</font></p>
     <p align="justify" style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Clerics
     also receive a few utility spells, such as bind, gate, invigor stamina,
     reckless strength, etc. Useful in the correct circumstance, but not much
     more than that. Bind and Gate however are vital spells that can greatly
     reduce death downtime or increase the speed of selling trips to town.</font></p>
     <p align="justify" style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8"><font face="Verdana" size="2">As
     you can see, the Clerics have a variety of spells available to them.
     Although their healing and buffing spells will always remain their main
     weapons, they aren’t purely band aids in groups. If being the lifeblood
     of your group, the tide-turner, sounds exciting, the Cleric class is
     definitely for you. Some of our miscellaneous advantages are that we are
     always wanted in groups, we are always needed in Dragon and Planes raids
     and we have always a lot of fun if we like our job. We can also make a lot
     of friends very quickly. I have read that monks were praised for their
     pulls, warriors for the critical hits and wizards for their incredible
     blasts, well, personally I’ve never seen anyone being praised as much as
     myself last time I menaged to get a complete heal off in time on a warrior
     who had fallen below 1/8 of a bubble of HP =) Being a Cleric have its
     glory, and people do realize how vital you are to them. That’s by itself
     a very important satisfaction.</font></p>
     <p align="justify" style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Good
     luck young Clerics, go forward in the name of your Gods, and let nothing
     stand on your way until you stand at the top of the highest tower of the
     Plane of Air!</font></p>
