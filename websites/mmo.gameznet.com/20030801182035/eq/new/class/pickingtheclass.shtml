            One of the things that is great about a class based game is that

            each class has it's own strengths that make people want to play that

            class. On the flip side of that every class also has it's

            disadvantages which will make you wish it could do x like class y.

            The strengths and weaknesses of each class are the very factors

            which insure that teamwork and grouping in the game will become

            neccessary to conquer the epic monsters in the game.<br>

            <br>

            That having been said each class has it's own strengths and

            weaknesses that will be addressed here and we will try to address

            what you can expect from all of the classes at higher levels. In the

            end we are hoping that you will have enough information to choose

            the right class for you from the get go.

            <p align="center" style="MARGIN-LEFT: 8px; MARGIN-RIGHT: 8px"><font face="Arial" size="4" color="#dddd00">Class

            Categories</font></p>

            <p style="MARGIN-LEFT: 8px; MARGIN-RIGHT: 8px" 
           >There are four distinct types of classes in Everquest. It's a

            little more complex than that as some classes borderline on one

            another such as druids and bards but in general every class falls

            into one of the four categories:<br>

            <br>

            1) Melee classes are the bread and butter of the game. Warriors,

            monks and rogues are melee classes. These classes are designed to

            hack and slash. Monks and rogues have some extra abilities which

            keep them more interesting than the warrior class however they

            suffer from fewer hit points and items.<br>

            <br>

            2) Priest classes include clerics, shamans and druids. These are the

            healers in the game. These classes can make other classes stronger

            with their healing and buffing spells. Each has it's own other

            advantages and weaknesses which we will cover below. They have

            harsher item restrictions than pure melee classes but a much wider

            range of items than mage classes.<br>

            <br>

            3) Mage classes include wizards, enchanters, necromancers and

            magicians. These classes can use very few types of armor and even

            fewer weapons. They are very weakest classes in melee combat and

            also have the fewest hit points. They make up for it with the most

            powerful spells in the game.<br>

            <br>

            4) The last 
            category is the hybrid classes. These include rangers, paladins, 
            shadowknights, beastlords&nbsp;and bards. These classes are a mix of 
            other class types. All hybrid classes can melee well and can cast 
            spells to boot. The problem with this type of character is that they 
            level much slower than other classes and that they are not as good 
            as any of their parts. For example a ranger is half druid and half 
            warrior. He will never be

            able to fight as well as a warrior and he will never be able

            to cast as well as a druid. What he is however is a fine mix

            of the two class types. The druid class could also be considered hybrids

            in a sense. Druids are part ranger, part cleric and part wizard in

            many players eyes.</p>

            <p style="MARGIN-LEFT: 8px; MARGIN-RIGHT: 8px" 
           >

            <br>

            What I am going to attempt to describe below is a comparison of all

            of the classes in the game by category of what they can do and what

            they can use. Depending on your personal style of play you should be

            able to get an idea of what classes you should be narrowing your

            decision down to.</p>

            <p align="center" style="MARGIN-LEFT: 8px; MARGIN-RIGHT: 8px"><font face="Arial" size="4" color="#dddd00">Armor</font></p>

            <p style="MARGIN-LEFT: 8px; MARGIN-RIGHT: 8px" 
           >     First and foremost we will

            discuss items beginning with armor. There are many different types of armor in

            the game and not all classes can wear

            all types. Warriors, paladins, shadowknights, clerics and bards can wear the widest

            variety of armor. They can start with cloth armor and move all the

            way up to magical platemail. The only armor they cannot wear is pure

            mage armor.<br>

            <br>

                        

                     Rangers,

            rogues and shamans are next in line when it comes to

            armor selection. They can use cloth, leather and chainmail types which will be

            readily apparent from the beginning. They cannot wear store bought

            or bronze platemail or steel armor.<br>

            <br>

                        

                      

                      

               The next in line of armor selection is

            the druid, beastlord and monk classes. They can&nbsp;mainly wear leather type

            armor. This includes several types of magical armor such as bone, spiked and

            snakeskin armor. In defense of monks however they are the best dodging

            class in the game which will prevent them from taking as many

            blows as other melee classes. It should be noted that

            at higher monks can wear some high level magical platemail.</p>

            <p align="center" style="MARGIN-LEFT: 8px; MARGIN-RIGHT: 8px"><font face="Arial" size="4" color="#dddd00">Weapons</font></p>

            <p style="MARGIN-LEFT: 8px; MARGIN-RIGHT: 8px" 
           >  Now that we have covered armor we should discuss

            weapons. One thing that should be noted is that each different class has

            it's own type of special weapons. For example paladins have access

            to the holy swords which will dish great damage especially

            to undead. Rangers will gain high powered one handed weapons

            that will cast ensaring roots randomly on successful hits. We

            will not be covering all of these weapons here except to say that each

            class get a fair shake. Paladins and Shadowknights&nbsp;have the most powerful of the

            special weapons which will help them make up for the lack of duel

            wield and kick.<br>

            <br>

                   

                      Warriors,

            shadowknights, rangers, beastlords&nbsp;and paladins have the largest selection of weapons. They

            can use basically any weapon they can find including 1h/2h blunt and

            slashing weapons as well as piercing weapons.<br>

            <br>

            Rogues can use any one handed weapon but excel in the use of

            piercing weapons. They also are somewhat limited in what weapons

            they can duel wield because of the need of a piercing weapon for

            backstab.<br>

            <br>

            Bards can use most weapons in the game and can train in all of the

            different melee weapon skills. However I have yet to find many 2

            handed weapons which are actually wieldable by the class.

            Considering that they get duel wield and not double attack it would

            probably be foolish to equip a 2 handed weapon anyway.<br>

            <br>

                         

               Druids are next in line but not by much.

            Druids can use 1h/2h blunt and also can wield scimitars which no other

            priest class can. At first this does not seem like a big

            deal and many young druids choose to go the 2h blunt route. However

            the druids special&nbsp;Epic Weapon&nbsp;is a one handed slash. By choosing

            to use a scimitar a druid can also use a shield or magical shield to

            help their armor class and perhaps get some magical bonuses.<br>

            <br>

            Clerics 
            and shamans encompass the next tier. They are allowed

            to use both 1h/2h blunt weapons and shamans can also weild a

            limited supply of piercing weapons.<br>

            <br>

            Last but not least are the mage types which can use very few

            weapons. They can use staffs, daggers, giant snake fangs, and a few

            throwing weapons.</p>

            <p align="center" style="MARGIN-LEFT: 8px; MARGIN-RIGHT: 8px"><font face="Arial" size="4" color="#dddd00">Hit

            Points</font></p>

            <p style="MARGIN-LEFT: 8px; MARGIN-RIGHT: 8px" 
           >Next in the scheme of things we will cover hit points. Warriors have

            by the largest amount of hit points per level. Not far behind them

            are monks, shadowknights and paladins, following them are rangers,

            bards, beastlords and rogues. After which will come priest classes and

            finally mage types.</p>

            <p align="center" style="MARGIN-LEFT: 8px; MARGIN-RIGHT: 8px"><font face="Arial" size="4" color="#dddd00">Melee

            Combat</font></p>

            <p style="MARGIN-LEFT: 8px; MARGIN-RIGHT: 8px" 
           >Next we will attempt to cover melee combat. Melee combat is the

            meat and drink of the game. Melee combat encompasses any time you

            stand and fight an opponent at close range with weapons. It is

            neccessary not only to dish out damage to your enemies but it also

            allows your "tanks"(melee classes) to keep a monster

            occupied while your spellcasters can get off their spells from

            distance.<br>

            <br>

            On the issue of melee we can split things up right off the bat by

            the category your class falls under. Melee and hybrid classes get 5

            skill points * (level+1) for their various melee skills. This means

            that at level 1 you can raise any of your melee skills(say 1h slash

            for example purposes) to 10. Priest classes only gain 4 skill points

            * (level+1) meaning their skills would max at 8. Mage types only

            gain 3 skill points * (level+1) meaning it would max at 6. This will

            become more and more apparent as the levels add up.<br>

            <br>

                      

                     

                        

                          

                      

                  More importantly however priest and mage

            classes never get an extra attack. Shamans are the exception because of their races

            innate ability to slam. However it will only slam for 1 point of

            damage. While this may be a nice addition at level 1-10 it will be more

            or less useless beyond that point.<br>

            <br>

            Having covered that we will go into the extra attacks and skills of

            the various melee classes. Warriors get the most extra attacks.

            Warriors get both duel wield and double attack at level 15. They

            also get all of the defensive melee skills earlier than any of the

            other classes(these include dodge, parry and riposte). Warriors also

            can bash though a shield is required for non-large races(large races

            can slam without a shield). Bash allows you to not only dish damage

            but also stun your opponent. Warriors also can kick which will not

            stun but generally does a bit more damage than bash. Warriors also

            get the disarm attack at level 35.<br>

            <br>

                       

                      One can argue

            that monks are actually the best melee class damage wise and it would be hard

            to argue against them. Although monks do not get the toys of a

            high level warrior they also do not have to depend on them.

            Monks hands and feet can attack for a large amount of damage

            as well as being able to disarm their opponents earlier than

            a warrior. They are also lightning quick and magical in

            nature at early levels.&nbsp; Monks are the best duel wielders in the game

            though you will probably never want to actually use a weapon as your

            hands do more damage in a quicker amount of time. What evens them

            out melee wise is that they cannot wear much armor(and must depend

            on dodge/block) and that every time they gain a new and improved

            special attack the skill starts off low and will take some time to

            train it to a reasonable level.<br>

            <br>

            Paladins and shadowknights get most of the skills of a warrior they

            simply get them at later levels. Noticeably missing is kick and duel

            wield. Rather than being able to kick paladins/shadowknights will

            have to rely on bash. This is not a big deal to a shadowknight who

            will likely be an ogre or troll and will be able to slam and use a

            two handed weapon. It is a big deal for a paladin however whose

            special weapons are one handed and will need to rely on a shield in

            order to bash.<br>

            <br>

            Rangers get most of the abilities of a warrior just a bit later.

            Noticeably absent is the bash skill and the fact that you will not

            gain double attack until level 20(though you do get duel wield at

            15).<br>

            <br>

            Rogues are next in line and are the true wild card melee wise. They

            have most of the skills of a warrior. They even get some of the

            skills before a warrior(such as disarm). Rogues will not be able to

            duel wield as large a variety of weapons as a warrior or a ranger

            however. The trump card of a rogue however is the backstab skill.

            Backstab may not be very useful when soloing but it is a great extra

            attack in a group. Not only can it act as an instant taunt to get

            the monster off of your comrades but it will also do a ton of damage

            if succesful. It is the highest damage extra attack in the

            game(edging out the flying kick of the monks).<br>

            <br>

            Lastly we will cover bards. Bards are the weakest of the hybrid

            classes when it comes to melee. Bards do not get kick or bash. They

            do gain duel wield but do not gain double attack. They also do not

            gain parry, riposte, or disarm.</p>

            <p align="center" style="MARGIN-LEFT: 8px; MARGIN-RIGHT: 8px"><font face="Arial" size="4" color="#dddd00">Healing</font></p>
            <P style="MARGIN-LEFT: 8px; MARGIN-RIGHT: 8px">Healing is one of the most important abilities in the game.

            Healing allows you to not only reduce downtime but also to increase

            your efficiency in a battle. Healers can double, triple even

            quadruple and more the amount of damage a player can take during the

            course of a battle. This is very important at higher levels when

            monsters hit extremely hard and have an insane number of hit points.<br>

            <br>

                       

                       

                        

                    

             When it comes to healing clerics are first

            and foremost number one. Not only are their healing spells efficient

            than the same spell when cast by another class type

            but they also have the two most powerful healing spells in the

            game exclusively. These being&nbsp;celestial healing&nbsp;and complete heal(which will completely heal any player).

            Clerics also get group heal spells which aren't very useful in most

            situations but can be useful when fighting monsters who cast area

            effect spells.<br>

            <br>

            Next in line would have to be druids and 
            shamans.&nbsp; At level 60&nbsp;shaman get a massive heal

            called Torpor which&nbsp;can heal 
            up to 1200 hit points&nbsp;over 24 seconds but slows the attack 
            rate&nbsp;30% and snares the person&nbsp;being healed.&nbsp; This will not matter 
            much if the person is standing and meleeing.&nbsp; Both 
            classes get fast casting heals that usually cost heavy 
            mana over the slower casting heals.&nbsp; Most of the slower 
            healing spells can heal large

            amounts of hitpoints over the faster casting heals.&nbsp; Druids at level 60 get a

            fast curing heal called Nature's Touch which heals up to 978 hit&nbsp;points.&nbsp;

            While most of their&nbsp;heals&nbsp;are not as mana efficient as a clerics it still is

            very useful and will allow them to fill in as a cleric in many groups

            if a cleric is not available. Another very useful spell

            are the regeneration lines both classes have.<br>

            <br>

            The next class would 
            have to be a paladin. Not only do paladins have the ability to lay 
            hands(which heals nearly 1000 even at level 1)&nbsp; but they also 
            get group heals, large single target heals,&nbsp;divine 
            spells&nbsp;(immune to damage, casting that works on the person 
            casting it

            only) and ressurections. The problem is that they get their heal spells later than

            druids and shamans and also have much less mana and fizzle considerably

            more.&nbsp; But Paladins are very underrated for their healing ability.&nbsp; They have a 24 second

            long lasting heal that cures up to 700 hit points called Celestial

            Cleansing and they have group heals that can cure up to 600

            hit points on everyone.&nbsp;<br>

            <br>

               A good distance behind paladins are rangers. Rangers&nbsp;do

            get some healing spells such as&nbsp;Greater Healing at level 57 but&nbsp;generally are

            not all that useful healing wise during the middle of a fight. They

            can be quite useful however in reducing downtime.<br></P>
            <P style="MARGIN-LEFT: 8px; MARGIN-RIGHT: 8px">Beastlords are a 
            class that get some spells that are lower level versions of what 
            shamans get.&nbsp; Beastlords can cast heals up to Greater Healing 
            at level 57 but usually like rangers, are busy meleeing and are not 
            effective as a healer in a high level group encounter.</P>
            <P style="MARGIN-LEFT: 8px; MARGIN-RIGHT: 8px">

            <br>

            Bards should

            be mentioned in the same breath as rangers and beastlords. Bards

            healing is more of a regeneration spell. It is not incredibly useful

            in fight but it is great when resting to reduce downtime and will

            save the other healers in the group from having to waste their mana.<br>

            <br>

            Way in the back of the pack are the 
            necromancers. Their spells can be very useful when soloing as they 
            are lifetap style spells which not only heal the caster but damage 
            the target. Though Necromancers do not get a traditional heal, they 
            do have a line of spells that takes hit points from them and gives 
            it to&nbsp;another player.&nbsp;</P>

            <p style="MARGIN-LEFT: 8px; MARGIN-RIGHT: 8px" 
           >Buffing spells are an important part of the game. Buffing spells

            last for a pretty long period of time and can add to a players armor

            class and hit points. It is important to note that all mage types

            also receive buffing spells however their buffs can only be cast on

            themselves and will not be discussed other than to mention that they

            do exist(in the form of shielding spells).<br>

            <br>

            Clerics are the kings 
            of buffs. They have&nbsp;a symbol line of spells which adds hit 
            points but requires a material component.&nbsp; Their biggest and 
            best buffing spell is Ageosim at level 60 that adds 1100 hit points 
            and

            54 AC.&nbsp; This spell lasts an amazing 150 minutes.&nbsp;(they also get a

            group version of this spell at level 60).&nbsp; The best at increaseing AC

            is also the Cleric.&nbsp; However, keep in mind it can be

            expensive to be a cleric who is buffing at any stage.&nbsp; Most of

            their best buffing spells throughout all their levels can require gems to

            cast.<br>

            <br>

            Shamans are the next best at buffing.&nbsp; At 
            level 60 they get a spell called Focus, which stacks 
            with&nbsp;cleric spells adding to your hit points.&nbsp; This spell

            lasts 100 minutes and adds 405 hit points 67 strength and 60

            dexterity.&nbsp; They also get a group version of this spell.&nbsp; Shamans are&nbsp;extreemly helpful&nbsp;to

            have around.</p>

            <p style="MARGIN-LEFT: 8px; MARGIN-RIGHT: 8px" 
           >Druids&nbsp;are not the best&nbsp;option for 
            buffing for high end encounters from the melee view.&nbsp; Their hit 
            point spells do not stack with&nbsp;cleric ones, but they do stack 
            with shaman ones.&nbsp; At level 60&nbsp;druids do get an amazing 
            spell called Protection of the Glades.&nbsp; This spell increases 
            hitpoints by 450,&nbsp;AC by 24 and assists in mana regen by&nbsp;6 
            per tick.&nbsp; This spell is usually best suited to caster classes 
            because it will stack with

            some of their self buffs, where shaman spells will not.&nbsp; Also druids

            have damage shield spells which are amazing at higher levels.&nbsp; When casted

            on a player any hit they take can do up to 32 damage&nbsp;to

            the attacker.&nbsp;</p>

            <p style="MARGIN-LEFT: 8px; MARGIN-RIGHT: 8px" 
           >

            <br>

            Paladins follow the mix with their ability to cast all three of the

            cleric lines of buffing spells. The weakness is that they gain the

            spells much later than clerics and have less mana to cast them with.

            They are not incredibly useful if there is a cleric, shaman or druid

            in the group but can be great if there is not or if you are soloing.<br>

            <br>

            Enchanters can buff with the haze line of buffing spells. These

            spells are not as powerful as those of priest types but they are

            great if there is no other buffer around.<br>

            <br>

            Rangers can cast druid buffing spells although as with paladins they

            get the spells quite late.<br>

            <br>

            Last but not least is 
            the beastlord.&nbsp; They, like rangers and paladin get lower 
            versions later in levels of other classes spells.&nbsp; Paladins get 
            some cleric spells, rangers get some druid spells and beastlords get 
            some shaman spells.&nbsp; If there is any of the three main buffing 

            priest classes around, beastlords are not useful to buff.&nbsp; One thing this

            class does have is a small clarity like spell that stacks with

            enchanter lines of clarity and the mana regen buff that was just mentioned

            from druids.</p>

            <p style="MARGIN-LEFT: 8px; MARGIN-RIGHT: 8px" 
           >Stat increasing spells allow you to enhance some of your ability

            scores such as strength, intelligence etc. These spells can be quite

            useful if used in the proper situations.<br>

            <br>

            Bards 
            have the ability to boost certain stats for their entire party at 
            once which makes them a contender in this category.

            The problem&nbsp;that bards have to time their songs and if they are

            able to can sing up to four songs&nbsp;at one time.&nbsp; But if

            they encounter lag or are stunned, interupted or miss a note in their song,

            this can lower the&nbsp;number of songs they can sing at ones time.&nbsp; Even

            with this bards get songs that can increase melee speed, melee stats, mana regeneration

            or health regeneration.<br>

            <br>

                     Shamans&nbsp;can increase

            every statistic a player has with the exception of intelligence and

            wisdom. It was deemed that intelligence and wisdom boosting spells

            could toy with the mana balance in the game and they were left out.

            Not only can shamans increase other players ability scores but they

            can do so at early levels which makes them a desired member in a

            party.<br>

            <br>

            Clerics, druids and enchanters can enhance a players stats but they

            are way behind a shaman. Generally they can only increase a small

            number of stats usually strength. All of these spells are different.

            Enchanters probably are the most useful being able to not only

            increase a players strength but also render him invulnerable at the

            same time.<br>

            <br>

                Enchanters have several stat increasing

            spells which not only grants strength(in exchange for agility) but

            also makes a player invulnerable for a brief period of time.<br>

            <br>

                      

            Necromancers can also cast a strengthen spell on other players

            and both necros shadowknights can cast&nbsp;siphon spells which take

            stamina, strength and AC from a target and&nbsp;buff it to a group

            member but these are not large enough stat boosters to only

            desire a shadowknight as a stat buffer.</p>

           >

                     Rangers do

            get some stat boosting spells but again they are smaller

            versions of what a druid can have.&nbsp; They do

            get an agility increasing line of buffs, which druids do not have,

            but like shadowknights they are not high enough in stat boosters

            to desire a ranger for stat buffing.</p>

               Beastlords can help melee statistics in minor

            forms by adding strength at later levels by 25

            and dexterity by 40.&nbsp; These are spells that shamans get at lower

            levels but if a shaman is not present this class at

            least add some benefit to overall stats.</p>

            the monster will hit you for quite a bit more than the damage shield

            will hit back but it adds up. The weakness of these spells is the

            generally short duration. Rangers and druids get a special line of

            damage shields which add armor class and do a very minor amount of

            damage which have a long duration. Problem with that line of ranger

            Druids and magicians are the kings of damage shields. Their damage

            <br>

            Rangers can also cast damage shields though they get them much later

            than their druid counterparts. A side note is that a rangers damage

            shields are much more useful when cast on themselves than a druid

            casting them on himself. This is because rangers can absorb more

            punishment and wear better armor than a druid thus allowing them to

            fight longer and do more damage.<br>

            from there. The problem with these spells are that they require a

            component and can thus get expensive if you use them often.<br>

            <br>

            The only 
            other class that can cast a damage absorbing spell on others is the 
            cleric class

            and they don't receive it until level 49. In actuality the word

            of divine spell is not a damage absorbing spell(which absorbs x amount of

            damage and then expires) it is an invulnerability spell which renders every

            member of the party invulnerable for a short period of time and

            can only be cast once per 15 minutes.&nbsp; Usually

            there is more than one type of "divine" spell for this class that

            they can use.<br>

            <br>

            Necros, wizards and magicians can cast damage absorbing shields but

            they can only cast these spells on themselves.</p>

           >Direct damage spells do direct damage to one target. They are the

            bread and butter of offensive spells for most classes. There are

            also direct damage spells which only affect certain monsters(such as

            undead) which will be discussed in the next chapter.<br>

            <br>

            Wizards are the kings of direct damage though this will not become

            readily apparent until higher levels. At early levels wizard damage

            spells are similar to all other mage types and also druids. This

            discourages many a young wizard into abandoning the class. However

            wizards don't begin to peak until level 20 when they receive Force

            Shock the first of their high powered direct damage spells. Things

            only get better from there and at level 60 you will be dishing out

            up to 2000 points of damage with your DD spells.<br>

            <br>

            Druids and magicians are next in line when it comes to dishing out

            direct damage. Magicians spells generally do a bit more damage while

            druid spells are more mana efficient. However the edge here might

            have to go to magicians when you consider that most magicians will

            have a higher intelligence than druids will have wisdom thus

            equaling more mana.<br>

            <br>

            Shamans and 
            enchanters can also dish direct damage though they are quite a ways 
            behind

            druids and magicians in most instances. There are periods of time

            during certain levels(for example between level 34-39) when a shaman can

            outdamage the aforementioned druids and magicians when those classes are

            waiting for their next spell in line. Shamans generally are

            more DD efficient than enchanters but shamans don't have any large

            DD upgrades post level 50, which hurts them greatly.<br>

            <br>

            Clerics 
            are the weakest direct damage class in the game unless you're 
            talking about undead damage. An argument can definately be made that 
            their efficiency with special case monsters(see below) can make up 
            for this somewhat. However cleric spells are usually high damage 
            high mana consumption spells.&nbsp; Clerics do, however, like 
            paladins get

            wonderful stun DD spells.&nbsp; Though they do not do massive damage they

            can be extreemly helpful when stopping a gating mob, helping

            to give a caster time to move away from a

            mob that is hitting them and to stop mobs as they

            are casting spells.</p>

            <p style="MARGIN-LEFT: 8px; MARGIN-RIGHT: 8px" 
           >Bards can dish direct damage though they really never will. It

            can be useful when soloing as an additional attack but bards should

            rarely be soloing and in a group their songs are better used for

            other purposes.<br>

            <br>

            Rangers can also cast direct damage spells 
            though they are casting smaller damage spells than the aboved 
            mentioned.&nbsp; They do get a

            450 DD spell at higher levels but because they are mostly

            a meleeing class, they do not have massive mana to deal out large

            amounts of DD through spells.</p>

           >This category of spells encompasses being able to cast DD spells

           >        Clerics reign supreme

            when it comes to direct damage attacks on special foes

            because they can damage both types. Clerics mana:dmg efficiency on undead

            beasts is matched only by high level wizards. Wizard spells do have a

            shorter recast time and more mana than a cleric allowing

            them to actually outdamage a cleric in most circumstances post

            level 24 however clerics will maintain an edge over other classes.

            Clerics also get the ward summoned line of spells starting at level

            19. While druids still mantain an edge over them versus

            summoned opponents it keeps clerics competitive with other classes

            versus these beasts.<br>

            <br>

            Druids have to rank second because of their ability to cast spells

            versus summoned foes. They are the only class which can cast banish

            summoned.<br>

            <br>

                      

              It can be argued that necromancers should actually rank above druids

            in this field. Necromancers get all of the undead DD spells that a

            cleric receives. The argument could be made this is more useful than a

            druid because undead are more plentiful. However at higher levels if

            a druid wanted to stick to summoned beasts he could move to an

            elemental plane.<br>

            <br>

            Magicians also gain spells versus summoned foes though they

            generally get them very late. They do not receive ward summoned

            until level 16 where a druid gains the spell at level 5.<br>

            <br>

                      

                   Each of the hyrbids can cast special

            damage spells. Hyrbid special DD spells are received

            a bit later than a true caster but are still

            quite useful(especially for fetching or finishing runners). Both paladins and shadowknights receive

            spells versus undead all the way up to the level

            60. Paladins generally get them one circle earlier however. Rangers have spells verus

            summoned but they only have ward and dismiss. They get dismiss at

            level 39 which is 10 levels earlier than the paladin or SK

            special DD spells. However they miss out on the expulse variant of

            the spell which might hurt them in middle levels.</p>

            Necromancers are the masters of DoT spells. They receive a couple of

            different lines of DoT spells which can be stacked with one another

            and they receive both of them by level 12. These being the clinging

            darkness line of spells and the heat blood line of spells. When

            stacked together you will be doing a lot of damage every round while

            your pet tanks the mob. You can also stack the disease cloud spells

            with these for even more damage(though not much more).<br>

                Shamans and druids also receive

            DoT spells though they are not as effective as a necromancers.&nbsp; Shamans would

            have to rank next in line when it

            comes to DoT's.&nbsp; Shamans also like&nbsp;necromancers can stack DoTs and have

            their pet melee a mob.</p>

            cast spirit of the wolf and when combining SoTW and

            DoT you can take down monsters with little effort or danger.&nbsp; Necromancers only

            have one safe guard when trying to avoid being hit and

            that is feign death.<br>

            <br>

            Enchanters also receive DoT spells beginning at level 1 with the

            choke spell. They are the enchanters most effective offensive spells

            for efficiency.<br>

            <br>

                    

                     Shadowknights and

            rangers also receive DoT spells. Rangers only receive one

            the level 30 stinging swarm which druids receive at level 14. Shadowknights

            however get several different spells which can be

            stacked. At level 9 they receive disease cloud(not all

            that useful but it helps). They receive the clinging-engulfing darkness spells at level

            15/22 respectively. However things don't really get rolling

            until heat blood at level 30 which can be stacked with

            engulfing darkness to maximize damage.</p>

           >Area effect damage spells can be useful when fighting several

            foes at a time. An area effect spell can damage several opponents at

            once. There are three types of AE spells. First is the personal

            based area affect spell(PBAE) which centers around the caster. This

            can be useful for clerics and shadowknights as they might be able to

            absorb the damage of the beasts around them(and it acts as an AE

            taunt spell). The second is area effect target spells which will do

            damage to everything around the target including the caster. The

            last is the rain spells. These spells do three rounds of damage and

            should be cast on your tank. It will damage all of the monsters

            surrounding him but will also make them really want to kill you if

            you aren't careful.<br>

            <br>

            Wizards are the kings of area effect spells. Not only do they

            sport(and also PBAE spells though I don't suggest using them) the

            most damage:mana efficient rain spells but they also come in several

            flavors. Do not underestimate the effectiveness of fire/cold/magic

            based attacks which can do a good amount of damage to different

            types of monsters. For example you aren't going to do much damage to

            a fire element with a fire based attack.<br>

            <br>

            Magicians can also cast some quite good area effect spells. They

            have both PBAE and rain spells which come in several varieties of

            damage types. They are probably second to wizards in this area.<br>

            <br>

            Druids excel at outdoor area effect spells. They can cast both the

            tremor-&gt;earthquake line of spells which are person based and can

            damage a very wide area(though aren't very mana efficent) as well as

            the lightning based area effect spells which center around the

            target. The weakness of druids area effect spells is that they are

            outdoor specific.<br>

            <br>

            Necromancers and clerics can cast person based AE spells from the

            word of pain-&gt;shadow line of spells. These spells will damage

            everything around you and have a decent ratio(though not enough to

            kill a blue at higher levels alone) but will turn all of the

            monsters targetted against you which may not be a good idea

            especially if you are a necromancer. This can be quite useful

            however if you have 2 clerics or necros both casting these spells as

            you will be able to eliminate several foes at once.<br>

            <br>

            Rangers get the druids lightning based attacks though much later.

            They have the same advantages and disadvantages of the druids AE

            spells however having less mana they are more of a parlor trick than

            anything else.<br>

            <br>

            Bards also get area effect damage spells though you will rarely use

            them beyond the early levels.<br>

                  Though it is not a huge damage spell,

            Enchanters get an amazined Area Effect stun, which paired with wizards AE's and a cleric,

            can generate massive experience in one large multi-mob pull. (I'd recommend

            a tank puller and two wizards for a cleric and enhancter to

            do this with the most safety)</p>

            Last and least are the shadowknights. At level 49 they receive word

            of shadow a level 19 cleric and level 20 necromancer spell. It is a

            PBAE and the damage is not a whole lot at this level. It can be

            useful for taunting monsters however and is the only spell which

            shadowknights ever get that can do direct damage(even if it is area

            effect direct damage) to non-undead enemies.</p>

            <br>

            Magicians are arguably the best in this field. While necromancers

            can also summon pets of equal strength magicians have a choice of

            several different types of pets(water, earth, fire and air) which

            each has it's own unique advantages and disadvantages.<br>

            <br>

            Necromancers and shadowknights can summon 
            undead skeletons to do their

            dirty work for them. Necromancers are much more useful

            in this field as their pets are much tougher than their shadowknight

            brothers and they can summon more than one type of

            pet. Shadowknight pets however are simply an added extra for an

            already potent class where necromancers require their pets to allow

            them to get off their DoT spells and for their DoT spells to take

            full effect.<br>

            <br>

            Enchanters can create illusionary pets with the Pendril's Animation

            line of spells. Enchanter pets are not as effective as a magicians

            or a necromancers but they add on to the class and are a welcome

            addition.</p>

           >Also along the same lines of enchanter pets, 
            wizard animations do not do normal damage because they cannot be 
            casted and told commands.&nbsp;

            The pets are almost like DoTs and do damage

            on the one mob that is being attacked and they disappear and

            have to be recasted for each new mob&nbsp;being attacked.&nbsp; These pets are not mana

            efficient.&nbsp;</p>

           >For the sake of this editorial we will consider utility spells to

            be anything that is not a damage or a defensive spell but does

            something a bit different. It is a very wide topic and I will

            attempt to explain what most classes can do in this respect.<br>

            <br>

            Druids and 
            shamans have perhaps the widest

            range of utility spells. Spirit of the Wolf(which allows you to

            travel faster in outdoor zones) is probably the most well known

            and liked of these spells. Enduring breath will allow you to breath

            underwater and can be quite useful when rooted underwater or if you

            wish to travel to one of the underwater adventure locations.&nbsp; Druids and shamans can

            also cure the various afflictions which you will

            receive over time(disease, blindness, poison, etc) and can cast invisibility and levitation

            spells.&nbsp; Shamans additionally can cast a quickness line of spells on players

            and use their malosini line of spells to debuff mobs.&nbsp;

            Both classes get bind sight, which lets you view

            through the eyes of a nearby target.<br>

            <br>

            Enchanters also have several types of utility spells. Probably the

            best of their spells are the quickness line of spells which will

            increase a players attack speed. Enchanters are also great in the

            way of debuffing spells such as Tashan which will lower their

            opponents magic resistance.<br>

            <br>

            Magicians have their own style of utility spells. Magicians can

            summon just about anything you would ever need including bandages,

            food/drink and weapons/armor. Magicians also can summon magical pouches

            and cast invisibility.<br>

            <br>

            Enchanters also have their own blend of utility spells. Enchanters

            can cast mesmerize and AE mesmerize spells which can calm monsters

            and prevent them from attacking. Enchanters can also cast illusion

            spells which will grant them access to areas previously unreachable

            by appearing to be a race which they are not. Add to this

            invisibility, confusion and all sorts of other "mess with

            you" spells and the enchanters are a very useful addition to a

            group.<br>

            <br>

            Necromancers can cast an area effect weaken 
            spell which can be somewhat useful as well as fear spells. To help 
            themselves

            they can also feign death and cast invisibility/see invisibility and infravision.&nbsp;

            They also can cast a enduring breath, levitation&nbsp;and resist buff called Dead

            Man Floating, which is very useful in some

            situations.<br>

            <br>

            Wizard utility spells include invisibility and scout spells. The

            scouting spells include the popular eye of zomm which creates a

            controllable eye which can be used to peek into unscouted terrain

            and the bind sight spell which allows you to see through someone

            elses eyes.<br>

            <br>

            Clerics and paladins can cast invisibility versus undead, fear and

            calming spells. Calming spells allows you to avoid conflicts with

            otherwise aggressive monsters. Fear spells are also useful if you

            are outnumbered and clerics even gain an area effect fear spell at

            level 24.<br>

            <br>

            Rangers can cast invisibility(outdoor at level 15 and indoor at

            level 49), spirit of the wolf, root and water breathing spells.<br>

            <br>

            Shadowknights also sport a few utility spells including an AE weaken

            spell and invisibility versus undead. They can render themselves

            invisible and grant themselves the ability to see invisibility and

            infravision.<br>

            <br>

            Bards are the most effective class when it 
            comes to group utility spells. They can grant the entire group

            a spell similar to spirit of the wolf, water breathing and invisibility

            as well as casting area effect calm spells on their opponents, resists, sight

            and have armor that they can use that can cast the

            same scouting eye that wizards have.</p>

           >We that we have covered the spells in the game it's time to cover

            special skills available to different classes.<br>

            <br>

            Paladins have perhaps the best class specific skill in lay hands.

            This ability can only be used once per game day(about every hour and

            a half) but will heal close to 1000 hit points even at level 1. This

            is a life saver.<br>

            <br>

            Shadowknights have the harm touch skill which is the exact opposite

            of lay hands though not near as effective. Where lay hands heals

            damage harm touch causes it. It will do (level*10)+1 damage when

            used. This means it will do 11 damage at level 1 and 501 damage at

            level 50. Like lay hands it can only be used once per day. The main

            problem with this skill is that it can be resisted as a spell and it

            often doesn't do full damage.<br>

            <br>

            Forage is a 
            skill gained by rangers, druids and bards. This

            skill will allow you to scrounge up food and water and will

            reduce the amount of money spent on food and prevent you from having

            to make food runs.&nbsp; Also foraged items can be used for trade skills

            and quests.<br>

            <br>

            Tracking is gained by rangers at level 1, druids at level 20 and

            bards at level 35. This is an incredibly useful skill as it allows

            you to not only track down monsters in outdoor zones but also to

            discover if monsters have spawned in indoor zones. This skill is

            almost a neccessity for finding rare npc's in outdoor zones.<br>

            <br>

            Instill doubt is a skill gained by rogues and bards. It is a skill

            based fear spell which will cause your opponent to turn and flee.<br>

            <br>

            Safe fall is a skill that rogues, monks and bards will gain. It will

            prevent you from taking damage when falling from great distances if

            succesful.<br>

            <br>

            Hide and sneak are gained by monks, bards and rogues and can be used

            together as a skill based invisibility spell. Sneak will cause you

            to move slowly and hide will only work if you are standing still.

            They are not the most effective way to go around it but they do work

            and are better to have than not have.<br>

            <br>

            Apply poison and create poison are rogue specific skills which when

            working will allow you to create a poison and poison blades to do a

            DoT damage to your opponents.<br>

            <br>

            The rogue skills of sense and disarm traps can be used to find traps

            and remove them. There are some deadly traps in the game and these

            can help in exploring new areas though traps are few and far between

            in Everquest.<br>

            <br>

            Pick locks can be useful if you are stuck in a dangerous place

            behind a locked door. It is gained by rogues and bards.<br>

            <br>

            Alchemy is a special 
            skill available to shamans which will allow them to create potions 
            which can be passed

            out to party members that can increase anything from stats, hit

            points, health and mana regeneration, gate spells and damage shields. (and more!)<br>

            <br>

            Last but not least pick pocket will allow rogues to steal from their

            target. Beware this can result in being attacked if caught and will

            lower your faction with the friends of the victim.</p>

            <p align="center" style="MARGIN-LEFT: 8px; MARGIN-RIGHT: 8px"><font face="Arial" size="4" color="#dddd00">All Is

            Not Well...</font></p>

            <p style="MARGIN-LEFT: 8px; MARGIN-RIGHT: 8px" 
           >Now that we have covered what each class can do let's talk about

            what they can't do.<br>

            <br>

            Warriors can both dish and absorb punishment. The upside is that in

            a group they will always be fighting and a part of the action. The

            weakness is that there isn't much variety in being a warrior. Your

            battles will consist of nothing more than hitting the kick or slam

            button and occasionally taunt. After you receive dual wield and

            double attack at level 15 there isn't much to look forward to from

            that point on. You do receive riposte at level 25 and disarm at

            level 35 and they are nice additions, but they aren't much to strive

            after. Warriors find themselves relying on their party members more

            than anyone else. It is your job to stand there and take the

            punishment and you will need to have faith that your healers will

            heal you before you die. Finally having a lot of hit points can be a

            curse as well. You will not be able to solo very effectively at

            higher levels unless you don't mind resting for 30+ minutes after a

            fight while regaining your hit points.<br>

            <br>

              Monks have enough extras to keep them a bit more interesting

            than warriors. You can sneak and feign death which might save your life a time

            or two. Perhaps most importantly is the mend wound skill which can heal you during

            combat(but it can only be used every 5-10 minutes which makes

            it a one shot per fight type of deal). Monks

            can dish a whole lot of damage however they can't take

            as much as a warrior. There aren't many items which you

            can use and your human eyes can be a weakness(monks can

            only be human). The lack of armor will become more apparent at higher

            levels and a level 10 monk will look much like a level 40 monk.</p>

            <p style="MARGIN-LEFT: 8px; MARGIN-RIGHT: 8px" 
           >

            <br>

                         

                     

               Rogues can make a very fun class for the

            right type of player. They have many special skills which prevent

            them from becoming as monotonaus as a warrior although some of

            these skills will not be used very often. In traditional pen and paper

            RPG's the sense/disarm traps and pick locks were very effective tactics. In Everquest

            they can be used but you will find very few circumstances

            where you can use them. Pick pockets is great as you can

            actually steal keys off NPC's(since picking locks is not as effective as many rogues

            would like) and you can lace your pockets with gold. Another problem

            with being a rogue is that you will not be liked very well by many

            NPC's and a lot of them will refuse to deal with you.<br>

            <br>

             Bards are a great class in a group. They are the only class

            which can cast a wide variety of spells which can enhance every member

            of your party. The weakness in bards is primarily the same as

            their strength. They are great in a GROUP. Bards suffer an

            experience penalty when soloing and most of their spells are most

            useful in a group. If you love to group then a bard might be the

            right solution for you as they can do so many different things

            casting spells, using rogue skills and being a decent fighter who

            can use most items. If you plan on doing a lot of soloing bards

            might not be the best choice unless you want to level slowly.<br>

            <br>

                     

                Rangers are an excellent class for both soloing and

            grouping. Rangers can fill in as a warrior and can

            also cast healing and buffing spells on themselves and others which will

            reduce downtime when soloing or in groups without a priest. Tracking will give them

            a leg up on finding the rare npc's who carry some of the most

            powerful magic items in the game and will also make it

            easy to find targets in outdoor zones. The inability to use most platemail armor

            will rear it's head during the late 20's to high 30's. Your

            offensive spells are by and large useless because they do not do

            much damage and will suck a lot of your mana.<br>

            <br>

            Paladins make a great class at higher levels. They can heal, buff

            and damage undead. The holy paladin swords are very powerful and

            they can use a wide variety of items. Be prepared for a long hard

            trek if you choose a paladin. Other than the ability to lay hands

            they are nothing more than a weak warrior without kick for the first

            9 levels. Up to level 20 they are still quite underpowered. If you

            wish to use an extra attack you will have to wield a shield as bash

            requires it(and you never receive duel wield). With the exception of

            lesser heal(level 15) your spells will be underpowered at lower

            levels and you won't be able to double attack until level 20.<br>

            <br>

            Shadowknights can be a very powerful class at higher levels however

            like paladins be prepared for a long journey early on. Until level

            15 your spells will be not be very useful(though siphon strength is

            a nice touch) and harm touch is no lay hands in terms of usefulness.

            The saving grace is that you can start off with 2h slashing and use

            it all the way through if you choose a troll or ogre(which you

            should if you plan on getting the most out of this class) and still

            gain an extra attack(slam). Slam will only do 1 point of damage

            until you reach level 12 and train in bash but that 1 point is

            better than nothing and will also stun. At level 15 you will receive

            a pet which will help get thigns going. The problem with

            shadowknights is that they can only heal themselves during a fight

            and only receive one heal spell and that isn't until level 22. That

            having been said prepare for a lot of downtime if you plan on

            soloing. Your offensive spells are damage over time which fits in

            well since you are primarily a melee class but unlike other hybrids

            you never receive the root spell which will make it hard to chase

            down runners. Last but not least shadowknights are shunned by the

            majority of Norrath which will make life difficult.<br>

            <br>

            Druids are one of the best solo classes in the game. The ability to

            track coupled with their strong outdoor spells allow them to be the

            king of outdoor soloers along with high level wizards. Group

            teleport and healing spells insure that you will be desired in most

            classes indoor or outdoor. The weakness of druids doesn't really

            begin to show until around level 30. Druids can only wear leather

            type armor and cannot wear mage type armor. This means that you will

            not be able to stand toe to toe at higher levels and take advantage

            of your damage spells or limited melee ability. What it means is

            that at higher levels mage types might actually have a higher armor

            class than druids. The other weakness is that they will often become

            healers in groups without a cleric which means medding during battle

            which canbe quite boring.<br>

            <br>

            Shamans are 

            one of the most loved group classes but they can also solo with

            high efficiency. They are loved for their utility spells and they

            can use up to chainmail type armor and some high level magical platemail.

            The weakness in the class is that their&nbsp;greatest heal spell also

            snares the person it's casted on..making kiting (running, casting spells and damaging

            a target, running, casting, rooting and medding) very difficult if you need a quick

            exit. Their offensive spells are decent but are not the most

            effective in the game which means you will have to turn into the

            healer in many parties which will mean a lot of meditating during

            the battle.<br>

            <br>

            Clerics are a powerful class that is always in demand. They are

            mighty undead destroyers who also happen to have the best healing

            and buffing spells in the game. By soloing undead clerics can often

            powerlevel through the early levels and by having the ability to

            wear platemail they are a favorite choice of many beginning players.

            Be warned however their strengths are also the same factors which

            make them a boring class at higher levels. Because you are the best

            healers in the game you will be expected to meditate during fights

            to heal the tanks so they can fight the toughest possible monsters.

            This means that you will do very little fighting after level 30 and

            will basically become a first aid kit for the rest of the party to

            carry around.<br>

            <br>

            Wizards are probably the most viable solo class at higher levels.

            They are also in much demand by parties looking to take on powerful

            challenges. Their group teleport spells can help a party escape from

            sure death situations and their sight spells can help scout out new

            locations. However being a wizard is a long hard road. At low levels

            wizards are probably the weakest of all classes and you may find

            yourself shunned at early levels. You can kill monsters quickly but

            it will blow all your mana and you will be forced to sit and

            meditate. When you are sitting and meditating you are very

            vulnerable. Wizards like most mage types have low hit points and you

            will not have a pet to guard you. Some wizards also complain that

            being a wizard can be very repetitous root and nuke then med and do

            it over again. Nonetheless they are quite powerful and should not be

            overlooked.<br>

            <br>

            Enchanters are the masters of illusion and confusion spells. They

            are not a great solo class but are highly sought after in a group.

            They are also one of the more interesting classes in the game as

            they can do so many unique things. Charm is also a useful(albeit

            dangerous) tool. Weaknesses are their low damage DD spells, the fact

            that their spells are resisted more than other classes, and the fact

            that they are most effective in a group.<br>

            <br>

            Necromancers are one of the strongest classes in the game. They are

            also one of the most difficult to play. You will find very few NPC's

            who will deal with you and this will cut you off from some of the

            more interesting quests in the game. You also don't have much in the

            way of direct damage. You will need to rely on your pet or a tank so

            you can get off your damage over time spells and slowly eat away at

            your opponent. That having been said your pets are quite powerful

            and you have a wider variety of spell types than most other classes

            perhaps only matched by druids.<br>

            <br>

            Magicians are another interesting class. They have several different

            types of pets and can summon many different items. They are useful

            to lower level parties whose tanks may not have magical weapons. You

            can also summon bandages which can be used to practice the semi

            useful bind wound skill and save your healers mana. Weaknesses of

            the class is that you will never be able to match damage with a

            wizard and the fact that buying 4 new elemental summoning spells

            every level can get quite expensive.<br>

            <br>

            We have gone in this guide over the positive and negative side of

            all of the classes in the game. I'd like to be able to tell you

            which class and race to choose right off the bat but in a game such

            as Everquest this is impossible. There are so many great options

            that it purely depends on your playing style. Hopefully this

            editorial will help you ease the decision making process and more

            importantly will let you know of some weaknesses your class may

            experience at higher levels. There is nothing worse than dedicated a

            large amount of time to a class only to discover that you dislike

            what it can do at higher levels and want to play a different one.</p>
