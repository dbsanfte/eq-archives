            Monks, like rogues, don't peak until later levels. While warriors
            can dish out 30hp damadge with a two hander at level 10, monks wont
            be doing 30 damadge until level 30. However take comfort in the fact
            that at later levels, you will mop the floor with warriors. Monks
            are the only class that start with duel wield, although it wont work
            very often until you reach level 15 or so (which is the level
            warriors get duel wield) it does decrease the gap between warriors
            and monks at low levels.
            <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8">Stats:</p>
            <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8">Strength - Will make you
            do more damadge at high levels, and let you carry more. I wouldn't
            put any points here, since you don't need to carry more (you wont be
            carring more then 15 pounds since that will make you lose AC), and
            you wont make that much more damage at higher levels...</p>
            <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8">Stamina - You get a few
            more hps every level, very insignificant. Don't put any points here.</p>
            <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8">Agility - This is where
            you should dump all your points. Agility will raise your AC a little
            but the important thing it will do is make you dodge, block and
            riposte better. And not getting hit is always top priority, besides
            there isn't anything else worth putting points at.</p>
            <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8">Dextirity - Nobody knows
            what this stat does exactly... supposingly it makes you hit more
            often but I havn't noticed any difference. And it also helps with
            ranged atacks and spells, but you wont be using any of those.</p>
            <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8">Equipment:</p>
            <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8">Monks don't need much.
            The can use blunt weapons but it's really not recommended, while it
            may be a bit better then hand to hand at low levels, hand to hand is
            far superior at higher levels. But as long as you keep your hand to
            hand maxed, feel free to use blunt weapons. Monks can't wear more
            then leather (except some magical armor). The first thing you should
            do is get yourself a set of cloth armor, it's very light and will
            get you about 40AC. A full set of cloth armor costs about 3PP. Then
            you may want to save up for netted gloves, as they will let you kill
            wisps (Invlurnarable to everything but magical attacks, you should
            be at least level 10) which drop lightstones (greater lightstones
            can be sold for 5PP, very nice for level 10). After cloth armor you
            may want to travel to Guk (a dungeon in the innothual swamp), it's a
            pretty dangerous trip, better get someone to cast invisibility on
            you. You can find Woven armor on level 8 mobs in guk. Woven is the
            same as leather but much ligher. That's what you will be using until
            you get to level 20-25 at which point you will want to go back to
            Guk, and fight Froglock Gaz warriors. They drop Mesh armor which is
            almost as good as chain but still much lighter. Unfortunatly, you
            will be using Mesh up to really high levels at which point you may
            want to seek out rubicite armor. When you reach level 50 you could
            try and get green splinted platemail which is the best armor in the
            game. It's much stronger then plate (the gloves give 14AC), very
            light and give some nice attribute boosts. Monks are very vulnerable
            to magic, that's why you should look for items that will increase
            your resistances as you travel. Just remember to keep your weigh
            below 15 at all times. That means you will either have to sell loot
            often or be selective as for what you are looting.</p>
            <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8">Starting location:</p>
            <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8">Monks can start in
            Freeport or Qeynos, depending on deity. I have been to qeynos and
            freeport many times, and yet I'm not sure what's the best place to
            start in. Qeynos is less crowded, yet there are less mobs to kill.
            There's a nice dungeon in the qeynos hills which you can go to at
            level 6 or so. Freeport has alot of mobs to kill, and it borders
            with the northern desert of ro, which is a great place to get from
            level 7 to 15. However there are griffins (a level 35 mob) wandering
            around freeport which are agressive and will kill you in one hit if
            you go near them. It's very fustrating to fight near griffins... I
            think the best thing to do is start in freeport and go to misty
            thicket (borders with rivervale, go to east commonlands, zone east
            to commonlands, zone east again, zone north into rivervale, and exit
            rivervale from the north to get to misty thicket.) Misty thicket is
            one of the best newbie places to hunt in. If you follow the road out
            of rivervale you should rich a wall with two halfling guards. Beyond
            the wall you can find bears, shadow wolfs, goblins, giant scarabs,
            giant spiders... very safe and plantyfull place for newbies ranging
            between levels of 5-12.</p>
            <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8">Skills:</p>
            <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8">You start with Mend,
            perhaps the most important Monk skill. Mend will heal about 25% of
            your health when succesful and it recycles every 6 minutes. Mend
            drastically reduces downtime. I wouldn't use mend during battles
            until your mend skill is at least 100 because it may fail and hurt
            you, and there's nothing more anoying then almost winning a fight,
            then using mend worsening your wounds and dying. Most peopel will
            tell you to hit this skill constatntly to imrpove it, that's true
            but when you get to level 7-8 you can start using it only when you
            need it, it'll max out anyway.</p>
            <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8">Level 1 - Dodge, although
            you start with this skill you must put 1 point into it for it to
            start rising. This skill let's you avoide blows (duh). You will
            start appritiating this skill more as you level up (because it will
            work more often and because you will be getting hit for much more
            hps...)</p>
            <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8">Level 3 - Safe fall. At
            the moment this skill will not go up, sometimes it actualyl works
            and you don't take damadge (you don't get a msg)</p>
            <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8">Level 5 - Round kick.
            Same as kick but it does a bit more damadge and has a cool animation
            :)</p>
            <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8">Level 8 - Sneak. This
            skill will make you move 1/4 of your normal speed. It happens to
            have a side effect that makes you move silently, that means that if
            you use it you can walk behind mobs and they will not atack you
            (because they wont know you are there). Pretty useful as it let's
            you get the first hit in, but it's very hard to cross thru zones and
            not getting hit with this skill (I think you are better off
            running...). also useful in PvP.</p>
            <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8">Level 10 - Tiger Claw.
            Another special move, This one will do about as much damadge as
            round kick does when you get it to the same skill level but it does
            recycle a bit faster. The animation for round kick is better though.</p>
            <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8">Level 12 - Block. This
            skill is like dodge.</p>
            <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8">Level 15 - Double atack.
            This skill will make hit twice every round if successful. When you
            get this skill and duel wield high (level 25 or so) you should get
            four atacks per round from time to time.</p>
            <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8">Level 17 - Feign death.
            This skill is a life saver. The only thing to remember is to take
            attack off before you feign or it will fail every time. It is this
            skill which makes monks the best fetcher in the game. You can hit a
            monster that is grouped with a few others and they will all come.
            Then feign death, after the monsters slowly return to their spawn
            points pick off the last to leave and you can get one at a time most
            times.</p>
            <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8">Level 20 - Eagle strike.
            This special attack actually does more damadge then round kick,
            about twice as much.</p>
            <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8">Level 25 - Dragon punch.
            Another special move, sheesh.</p>
            <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8">Level 30 - Flying kick.
            The last of your special moves, this will do like 100hps at level
            50, and about 70 once you get it maxxed at level 31-32.</p>
            <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8">Level 35 - Riposte.
            Another dodge like skill.</p>
            <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8">Monks don't get taunt,
            but what most people don't know is that your special attacks act as
            taunt. Flying kick will almost always make a mob turn to you...</p>
            <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8">As a monk you should be
            grouping from level 10 up, you can solo beyond level 10 but it's
            much slower then grouping... in conclusion, let me add that you
            shouldn't worry about not being able to wield that execusioner's axe
            or fiery avenger, the monk's fists are the deadliest weapon in the
            game at level 50, especially with a claw... :)</p>
