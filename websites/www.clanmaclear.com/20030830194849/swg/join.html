&nbsp; &nbsp; Welcome, and be of good heart you who wish to join<BR>
with MacLear to protect our cherished Tome.
<BR>
<CENTER>But:</CENTER>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Be warned hereby that if you be of those who do not wish to join with us
in the spirit and times of The Galaxy, including but not limited to having a name 
that is appropriate for role playing and behaving more or less in character or bring
with you lies, deceit, division, selfishness or any other foul spirit, go no further.
We are of those who call themselves honorable and whose characters remain in the spirit
of The Galaxy in "Star Wars: Galaxies". Should you be one of those who call of themselves
eL1T3 d00dz or any other of the followers of The Twisted One, we will turn upon you
and you shall be from us outcast forever for we shall appeal to the gods and ask them to
remove you from Starsider and from the memory of all those who &quot;play the role.&quot;
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; In applying to MacLear, you are agreeing to obey The High Council. You
also agree to speak no foul or negative word against any MacLear except privately to
that MacLear or in complaint to a member of the High Council. You further agree
that you will not submit your fellow family to rants against Verant, MacLear, or any
other aspect of our life in-game. You also will not use our forums, guildchat or any
other aspect of our game life to speak fouly and illy of any other organization or person.
In other words, we don't want to hear of your pent up emotions about what you see as
the bad things of the world in guild chat! If you have a complaint you would like to
hear comment on, feel free to comment anywhere. On the other hand, don't give us
a monologue about the faults of the universe. We have quite enough negativity in real
life. We come here to escape that! :-)</p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Those who play any race <B>other</B> than human will not ever be allowed
to carry the last name MacLear in SW:G. It's simply not in line with our story. Those
who DO have a human character cannot create a character of the last name MacLear
unless you have already been MacLear prior to the release of SW:G without special permission
from The High Council.<BR>
<BR> 
<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">The process of joining is as follows:
</p>
<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">
<OL>
<LI>First, you must fill out every question in the form below.&nbsp; Some
of the questions have answers that are found on this site.&nbsp;
When you have completed the form, hit the Submit button, which will email it to
us.
<LI>Once your application is submitted, The High Council will review it for completeness and
appropriateness. If it passes that minimum muster, then it is posted in the Applicant
hall for comment.
<LI>You must have two sponsors who are Kin or above to be admitted as an applicant.
If you have those requirements and have not been able to submit them in person, email the
petition and the names of the sponsors to <a href="mailto:nosferum@mojodata.com">
nosferum@mojodata.com</a>.
<LI>Once you have a primary character in MacLear, your other family members will be
admitted automatically.
</OL>
<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">Finally, we have three rules to emphasise:</p>
<UL><li>Do not speak ill of your brother or sister except to them privately or
in a complaint to an officer.
<li>Conduct yourself in a manner that will bring honor to the name MacLear in
everything you do or say.<li>Obey our Laird and the officers appointed by her/him.</UL>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; Once you have submitted the application to the address above, if you 
have not heard from an officer in five days, contact an officer in-game.&nbsp; 
Please make sure that your email address is accurate and that you include your 
character name in the application!</p>
