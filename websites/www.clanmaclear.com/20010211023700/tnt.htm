  <p><font size="3"><strong><em>Note: some of this lesson may be seem over simplistic for
the more seasoned role player or online gamer. However, there are also items that will be
of considerable interest to those who have played for years. </em></strong>

  <ol>
    <li><strong><em>Battle Etiquette</em></strong></li>
    <ol>
      <li><strong><em>Don&#146;t take someone else&#146;s kill. If someone is already fighting
      something don&#146;t jump in unless invited or if they are in trouble. If it looks like
      they are in trouble, ask them if they need help. If you actually do wind up jumping and
      saving their butt, the simplest way to do it is to target them and use the /assist
      command. This command allows you to attack whatever they are attacking.</em></strong></li>
      <li><strong><em>Don&#146;t block someone&#146;s escape route. This is a sensitive subject to
      anyone who has tried to flee the terrors of the dark deeps and found themselves blocked
      by&#133;.YOU. This can put you on the &quot;bad&quot; list of someone for weeks on end.
      Although EQ is non pvp oriented, the monsters can be so hard that having a friend around
      just when you were least expecting them can save your bacon. People who I thought were
      strangers have saved me several times&#133;just because I was nice to them at one time or
      another.</em></strong></li>
      <li><strong><em>Don&#146;t be greedy. For example: there are 3 female barbarians standing
      around in the snow shivering in their mini kilts and halter tops and one of them has 3
      bear cubs attacking her. One of the other wild women tries to attack one of the bears and
      gets yelled at by the one wearing the &quot;monster magnet&quot; perfume for stealing one
      of &quot;her&quot; kills. This is just not right. Just because the monsters like the taste
      of your blood doesn&#146;t mean that you need to hog all the action. See 1.2 about the
      &quot;what goes around comes around&quot; principle.</em></strong></li>
    </ol>
    <li><strong><em>Manual Dexterity</em></strong></li>
    <ol>
      <li><strong><em>I don&#146;t know about you, but after a long day of stomping monsters my
      wrists need some ice. One of the hazards of EQ addiction is what is called Carpal Tunnel
      Syndrom. This occurs when the tendons in the wrist become enflamed from over use or in
      this case misuse. The way to overcome this challenge (other than VR gear &#150; when, oh
      when will my people be free of the shackles of mouse and keyboard) is to keep your hand
      and forearm in the same plane. In other words, don&#146;t bend your wrist.</em></strong></li>
      <li><strong><em>In EQ, this is nearly impossible with the default settings for the different
      combat modes. The Z key (auto primary attack) must be struck every time you start
      meleeing. Also the number keys (1-6) are in use almost constantly during the game in one
      mode or another. If you look at your keyboard (yes, do it now) you will see that the Z key
      and the number keys are not close to each other at all. Since combat takes up more the 50%
      of you time in this game, this constant movement and bending of the wrist will almost
      surely lead to enflamed tendons (it happened to me and I&#146;m no old fogey).</em></strong></li>
      <li><strong><em>THE SOLUTION: move your &quot;auto primary attack&quot; key to the key pad 0
      key. Other defaults that should be moved there for prime manual dexterity and general ease
      of use are the &quot;NPC targeting key&quot; (defaults to the N key), and any other key
      that you use often (for magic using classes, and monks there are several special keys that
      I would recommend moving to the keypad vicinity). </em></strong></li>
      <li><strong><em>How I did it: I assigned the &quot;auto primary attack&quot; role to the
      keypad 0 key, the &quot;NPC targeting&quot; key to the &quot;. /Del&quot; key, and the
      other number based keys I put on the key pad. With this method I can keep my wrist
      straight and get things done on average about 50% faster than other players.</em></strong></li>
    </ol>
  </ol>

  <p><strong><em>I have more planned for this article.&nbsp; It is aptly named &quot;The
Basics&quot; because there are many more little &quot;secrets&quot; that will make you a
better overall player of EQ.&nbsp; If you have anything that you think should be added to
the EQ Battle Tips and Tactics section of EQSS, please email me at <a HREF="mailto:l00ter@hotmail.com">l00ter@hotmail.com</a>. This is a temporary email until
Den can get past some technical difficulties with getting me a stratics.com email address.</em></strong></p>
