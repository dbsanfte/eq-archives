<p><em><strong>The Quest of Stone</strong></em><small>: (updated 14 April 99)<br>
<b>This is the only commonly known Quest. All others are known only to The High
Council, Keeper of Quests and to the participant. To leave the lowlands of Lads
and Lasses and enter the Highlands of the Kinsman or Kinswoman, you must
complete the Quest of Stone. To complete the Quest, you must travel far from
your homeland of ice and snow to find four circles of stone. There you must
capture power of the place in your soul. To symbolize this internalization, you
must take with you from that place an item that can only be got from that
region. - You must enter the Ring of Toxxulia on Odus and bring back a Kobold
Hide from the forest. - Then you must enter the Ring of Misty Thicket and obtain
a Giant Wasp Wing that can only be found there. - Next you seek out the Ring of
Butcherblock where you will collect a Scarab Carapace. - Finally you visit the
Ring of Greater Faydark and bring back a Jar of Royal Jelly as proof. Good luck
and safe travels, Future Kinsman.</b></small></p>

five or ten seasons of growth to strong enough to accomplish. Each quest may
require assistance from others in the form of a group, but each journey must be
for one member only and others who wish to complete the quest must do so on a
different day in the plane of reality.</small></strong></em></p>
