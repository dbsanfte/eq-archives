<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; The Clan MacLear is a <a href="http://www.everquest.com/">EverQuest</a>
guild dedicated to Halas and their kinsmen.&nbsp; Our purpose is to
enrich the fame and fortune of the Clan to defend Halas from the dangers of
Norrath and to offer service to make the world of Norrath a better place to
adventure.
&nbsp; We do this by knitting the loyalties and strengths of our individual members into
something larger than themselves, the Clan MacLear.&nbsp; We honor the gods of Justice,
Valor,&nbsp; and War above all others.&nbsp; We also pay homage to the primal forces of
nature: Fire, Water, Earth, and Air.</p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; Our guild is based on the premise that the Clan MacLear is a large
extended family founded by Lord Lear and the people that he led from another Time/Place
(see <a href="frmmac.htm#Clan MacLear">History of the Clan MacLear</a>).&nbsp; Over time,
the Clan has &quot;adopted&quot; members of other races as they were stranded in Halas,
came to the Clan for help, aided the Clan in some way, or otherwise positively interacted
with the Clan through in-character means.</p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; As we value Justice, we live by a set of <a href="#Rules">laws</a>.
&nbsp; To enforce these laws and to protect our weaker members from criminals we have a
<a href="#Ranks and Titles">rank structure</a>.</p>

<p align="center">
<big><a name="Rules"><strong><font face="Balmoral D"><big><big>C</big></big></font>lan MacLear
Laws</strong></a></em></big></p>

<ol>
  <li><p align="left">Obey and respect the officers and
    leaders of the Clan.&nbsp; (See <a href="../charter.htm#Ranks and Titles">Ranks and Titles</a>)
    &nbsp; The Chieftess and the High Council have the power to banish a member and it is their
    duty to use it when a member dishonors Halas and the Clan.&nbsp; (OOC: this means if
    you are consistently out of role, being a pest to others and just generally being a pain
    in the neck you will be removed from the guild)</p>
  </li>
  <li><p align="left">Conduct yourself in a way that brings Honor to the
    Clan. &nbsp; A MacLear does not complain of hardship.&nbsp; A MacLear does not leave his
    comrades in danger unless they have granted leave.
    A MacLear does not speak ill of another MacLear in public except in formal
    complaint to the Chieftess or member of the High Council. All MacLears may
    petition the Chieftess or any member of the High Council concerning the behavior
    of another member of the Clan.</p>
  </li>
  <li><p align="left">No MacLear will associate themselves with
    followers of the Twisted One.&nbsp; These are those who speak evilly and
    plot against virtue and honor to destroy the unity of MacLear. &nbsp; Any MacLear
    seen defending one of these Followers of the Twisted One will
    be put to Trial before the Council and may be banished without notice by the
    Chieftess.</p>
  </li>
  <li><p align="left">It is every MacLears' duty to instantly obey the Chieftess
    and protect the Chieftess from harm in Warfare.</p>
  </li>
  <li><p align="left">A MacLear Shaman must strive to learn new Secrets and
    Items of Lore and to inform the High Council so that they may be recorded in the Twisted
    Tome to the greater power of the Clan.</p>

<B>Official Server:</B>&nbsp; Our official server in Norrath is Xegony.
<blockquote>
  <ul>
      <li>Honorary Member: These are not members, but wish to have their
        relationship with our guild recognized in a formal way.&nbsp; Honorary members are
        accepted into the guild by invitation only.&nbsp; They do not receive voting rights in the
        guild, but their opinions are considered and they are always welcomed. &nbsp; They cannot
        carry guild rank like regular members, but should occasionally group with members or
        contribute to the Clan in some way.</li>
    <li>Alignment: All members must be Neutral or Good. Necromancers, death
        knights, dark elves, iksar and other things of evil intent are not accepted.</li>
    <li>Any Character sold or allowed use by another player will be considered to have immediately
        resigned from the Clan unless prior permission has been given by the
      Chieftess.
        Readmission of the Character will require two members to sponsor the
        Character of Kin level or higher and be subject to the judgment of the
      Chieftess. Any officer allowing another player to play his or her character
        shall be banned immediately unless permission has been given from the
      Chieftess.</li>
    <LI>We are not here to kill dragons and collect loot. If you want a guild for the purposes
        of empowering your character's statistics, look elsewhere. If you want people to group with,
        chat with, and you like to roleplay as barbaric (ruggedly neutral) then you're a shoe-in.
        A clan is only as good as it's members so if thing go south, look in the mirror.

<p><B>The <a href="images/tormod3.jpg" target="_blank">Chief</a></B> (Art by
Nosferum): <br>
There is only one Chief.&nbsp; This person is said to be the spiritual descendant of Lord
Lear and has the mandate of the gods to lead Lear's people.&nbsp; Only the Chief may Banish a

High Council.</p>

<p><B>The High Council :</B><br>
 All members of the High Council serve at the pleasure of the Chieftess

They may also Banish members from the Clan with a majority vote.&nbsp; The Council may
enact Laws by Majority vote.</p>

<p><B>Thane :</B><br>

A Noble is a Kinsman or Kinswoman who has proved his or her strength and courage by
achieving four hands of ability, completing the Quest of Fire to the
satisfaction of the Chieftess or the Council and been appointed as such.&nbsp; A Noble is
rarely denied audience with the Chieftess or with the High Council and is normally given a

for high crimes against the Clan and the name MacLear.</p>

<p><B>Lad / Lass :</B><br>
A Lad or Lass is one who has sworn fealty to the Chieftess of
the Clan MacLear and been accepted to probationary membership in the Clan by the
Chieftess or her appointed officer. &nbsp;A Thane, subject to appeal to the

Lad/Lass.</p>

Language</B></big></A></p>

<P>Since our inception well before the time of Norrath, we have incorporated basic components
of the Scottish Gaelic language (<I>Gaidhlig</I>) into our common vocabulary. It is recommended--
though not enforced-- to use this language in your every day experience in-game. This helps
immerse
you and those around you (in-guild and not) in the idea that we are what we say we are. Below are
some of the more common examples, and last is a link to the Siol Lear site that gives an even more
in-depth look at the language, it's real history, and a few more phrases and terms. Note: we also
use a very small amount of Latin.
<BR>
<BR>
<B>Failte</B> - "Welcome"<BR>
<B>Oidhce mhath</B> - "Good-bye"<BR>
<B>Laird</B> - (our reference to Tormod)<BR>
<B>Ciamar a tha thu?</B> - "How are you?"<BR>
<B>Mi faultich thu co saor neach</B> - "I salute you as a free man"<BR>
<B>Spectamur Agendo</B> - (our motto) "Let us be judged by our actions"

Clan MacLear Counting System (&quot;Hands&quot;)</B></big></A></p>

<p align="left">Due to the constant battle to survive in Everfrost,
there is not much time to educate those who have not been chosen as shaman.&nbsp; The
warriors and rogues would not be able to understand how to gather enough spears and arrows
for battle or how to estimate the size of an enemy force is the High Council did not give
them the &quot;Hands&quot; system.&nbsp; This is &quot;Hands.&quot;&nbsp; See and
Remember.</p>

<p align="left">1 hand is 5 fingers. 2 hands is double that many
fingers. &nbsp; Thus if an enemy has 2 hands of warriors and the MacLears have only 1 hand
of warriors.&nbsp; We must be very clever or the enemy may defeat our warriors.</p>

<p align="left">If there are more than 10 hands of something, a warrior
should find a shaman to help count the thing.</p>
