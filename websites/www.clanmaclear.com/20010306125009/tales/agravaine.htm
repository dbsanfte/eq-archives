<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt">Agravaine MacLear is my name and I am a Cleric of the
God Brell Serilis.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>However, this
was not always the case.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>In my
youth, I was trained as a warrior by my father Adarin Drendaiin and his brother
Garanel Drendaiin.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I spent many a
day practicing with my wooden sword and shield to become a great warrior like my
father had been.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>My father and
uncle were the two greatest warriors in all of Kaladim, as my grandfather Kornic
Drendaiin had been before them.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>They
were seated on the war council of Kaladim and sat to the left and right of our
King.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Any time a battle was waged,
they were at the front lines, killing the enemy in droves and leading the troops
to victory.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>To my knowledge, they
had never lost a battle.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>This was
my dream, to become like they were.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I
too wished to be a noble warrior and lead my men to glorious victory.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>My future was already planned, and it was wonderful.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Then one day, a wounded elf was found by one of our guards and returned
to the city.<o:p>
</o:p>
</span></p>
<p class="MsoBodyText"><span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The best clerics in Kaladim were helpless to heal this poor elf.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>His fate had been sealed by some dark magics, magics that they had never
encountered before.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>All they could
do was to ease his pain before he died.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I
was out practicing swordsmanship with my cousin while all of this was taking
place, but after the events that followed, I demanded to know the truth of what
the elf said before he died.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>This
is what my mother told me.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt"><span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>This elf was one of three elven scouts that had been sent to a mansion by
the lake in the mountains.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>A family
of elven nobility lived in the mansion, and the city of Kelethin had not heard
any word from them for over a month.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The
family had great business dealings in Kelethin, and so it was very unusual to go
a day without hearing from them, let alone a month.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>The Kelethin Council was becoming worried by the silence of these nobles,
and so had sent three scouts to go to the mansion and see what was amiss.<o:p>
</o:p>
</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt"><span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The elves passed through the mountains without incident.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>The goblins had been soundly defeated only a week before, and were in
hiding.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>As the scouts neared the
lake, however, they noticed that the trees began to look sickly.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>At the lakeshore, all the trees had died, and all the animals had fled
the area.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The few animals that
remained were diseased and mad with plague.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>The scouts had to fend off many a serpent and rat as they approached the
mansion.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The air grew thick and
cold, and stank like a closet that hasn’t been opened in many months.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>When the mansion was in sight, a skeleton arose out of the lake and
attacked the scouts.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>If not for the
sharp eyes and keen ears of one of the scouts, the three would have been taken
by surprise and surely slain.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>As the skeleton fell to the ground, the scouts noticed that
the musky smell was coming from the scattered bones.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>Taking this to be an ill omen, the three hurried to the
mansion.<o:p>
</o:p>
</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt"><span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>What they beheld as they walked through the gates was too terrible that
the elf was unable to speak of it himself.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>He just shook his head and mumbled over and over, “Dead.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>All Dead.”<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Our clerics
then drugged the elf, so that he could sleep and save his strength.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>The elf had troubled dreams though, and he spoke in his
sleep.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The things he spoke of were
so frightful, that the nurse who was with him was taken with fear and ran from
the room screaming.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The elf told of
hoards of undead beings.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Corpses
that rose from the earth and began to move around.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Humans and elves alike with no flesh walking about and preparing for
battle.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Victims of plague calling
out in agony as they died.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Little
is known about what happened next, for the elf began to panic and scream in his
sleep; and shortly thereafter, he died.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>What
our clerics think happened is that one of the beasts saw the three scouts and
attacked them.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>It slew two of them
on the spot, and pursued the third into the mountains where our guards found him
lying in a field.<o:p>
</o:p>
</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt"><span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>When we reported all of this to the Kelethin Council, they grew very grim
indeed.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>They were currently engaged
in a great battle with a band of orcs led by Emperor Crush.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>They had no forces to spare and could offer little in the manner of
advise about the mansion.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>They only
knew that the nobles there were very wealthy and had dozens of servants and
their families living on the grounds.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>With
Crush battling against the elves, they could be of no help to us.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Our King called his war council together to decide what to do about the
evil that had grown on the shores of our nation.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Like true warriors, my father and uncle suggested that we attack the
mansion before they had finished preparations for war.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>If we struck first, we would surely have the upper hand and defeat the
evil that had taken hold of that once fine mansion.<o:p>
</o:p>
</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt"><span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Preparations for battle were made in Kaladim.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>The militia was called together and armed.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>It was a grand sight to see so many brave warriors adorned in steel and
wielding sword and hammer.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Clerics
were sent as well, so as to heal and guard our warriors during the battle.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>My father came to me the night before he departed to tell me
that he was going to another battle; and that he would be home by sundown the
next eve.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The following morn, I was
glowing.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Here was my father and
uncle leading a parade of armored warriors and clerics into a battle that they
would surely win.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>As they left the
gates of Kaladim, I ran into my house and took up my sword and shield.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>I was eager to practice my skills so that one day, I could lead the
parade out of town.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I woke my
cousin at his house and we began to practice the skills of a warrior.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>I was only 14 years of age then.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>As
the sun was at its height in the sky, we were safe inside the caves of Kaladim.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>I swung my sword at my cousin, and he blocked my blow with
his shield as if he had known where it would land.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>He thrust at me, and…<o:p>
</o:p>
</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt"><span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>My eyes flashed a blinding white light.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>I shut my eyes in pain, but the light persisted.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>I could not block it out of my eyes or my mind.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>As quickly as it had come, it was gone, but I was no longer in Kaladim.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>I was no longer Agravaine either.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I
was ethereal.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>I was floating in the air above my father’s head as he
marched to the mansion on the horizon.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I
turned to see the great host of dwarves that was following my father into
battle, and my heart was filled with pride.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Here were assembled all of Kaladim’s finest warriors and clerics.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Their skills were unmatched by any other in the city.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Any force that was foolish enough to meet them in battle deserved to be
slaughtered for stupidity.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span><o:p>
</o:p>
</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt">As I watched my father march, the light flashed
before my eyes again.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Now I was
hovering above something else.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>It
was taller than a dwarf, but thinner than an elf.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>It was wearing chainmail and wielded a saber.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>It was not marching; it was hiding in a bush along the waters
edge.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I could not make out what it
was, until it raised it’s head and looked up to where I should have been.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>As it looked up, I saw that it had no hair…no; it had no flesh at all!<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>This was a skeleton hiding in ambush of our warriors!<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>I shut my eyes in horror and the flash returned again.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>I was high above the lake, looking down upon the battle that was about to
ensue.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I could plainly see the
column of dwarves coming along the shore.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I
could also see many shapes in the bushes and in the lake itself.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>There was also a much smaller column of warriors marching to meet my
father.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I knew that my father could
not see the forces hiding in bush and water.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>I knew that he would assume that the small column was all that there was.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>I knew it, but I was helpless to do anything about it.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>I was doomed to watch what followed from my high vantage point.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span><o:p>
</o:p>
</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt"><span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The columns met at the far side of the lake.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>I could see that my father had marched right into the middle of the trap
the evil beings had set.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>As my
father shouted the battle cry that would begin the fight, the hidden shapes in
the bushes and water sprung to the attack.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>They attacked the dwarven army from the rear, where all the clerics were
seated.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>The clerics were slaughtered as if they were nothing more
than insects.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The few that realized
what was happening before it was too late jumped up and ran to the warriors for
protection.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Half of our warriors
had already charged into battle with the undead army, the other half had to deal
with the army that was now behind them.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Our
forces were split, and divided; we had not much hope of victory.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>When it looked as if we might win, great bats with claws and
fangs began to swoop out of the sky and attack our battered warriors.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>My father and uncle, seeing that this was a lost battle, called for a
retreat.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Most of the remaining
dwarven forces focused on the army to their rear and finally broke through it.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>My father and uncle were holding off the great host of undead as the
remaining warriors fled into the mountains.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>There were only two clerics left, and one ran with the warriors, the
other stayed with my family.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>As the
last of the warriors ran away, the cleric cast a great spell.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>A purple wave spread from him, and the undead fled before it.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Then my uncle and father turned and ran, the cleric followed suit.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>I watched them run, and sighed my relief that they had not fallen.<o:p>
</o:p>
</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt"><span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>My sigh was immature, for as they ran, a final shape arose out of the
water.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>This creature had once been
a woman, I think.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>She had obviously been one of the first to die, and had died
of plague.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Her body was rotten and
corroded.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>She had been twisted by
some very powerful and evil magics.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>She
began to move her hands about and I realized she was a spellweilder.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>I saw as she worked her hands, a ball of fire swell around
her.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>At her command, the fire flew
out over the lake and struck my uncle in the back.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>His platemail armor provided little protection from the heat, and his
cloth shirt burst into flames.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>He
roared in pain as the fore covered his body, and he began to run towards the
water to put it out.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Just then,
roots grew up around his feet and held him on the shore, a mere foot from the
cooling waters.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>As he fell over,
the white flash returned.<o:p>
</o:p>
</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt"><span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>I was now looking directly at the charred body of my uncle.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>I saw the undead hag float across the water to where the remains were.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Then I saw a feat of magic that I have never seen again, and hoe that I
will never again witness in my life.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Rather
than just bend his body to her bidding, she captured his very soul and twisted
it.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>His spirit rose out of his body and began to hover.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>It’s eyes then turned blood red and it took up my uncle’s arms and
began to pursue my father and the cleric.<o:p>
</o:p>
</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt"><span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>As another flash faded from my vision, I was looking at my fathers face.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>He was running for all his might, and I could see bruises and blood from
where he had been struck with their weapons.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>I rose up to look over his head, and I saw the cleric running behind him.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>But the cleric was losing speed, for he had been wounded in the leg in
the attack.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>Behind him, I saw the spirit of my uncle racing towards them.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>The cleric must have sensed the evil coming, for he stopped running and
turned to face the ghost.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>He
released the same purple wave that he had done before, but it had no effect on
the evils that bound my uncle’s spirit.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>In
desperation, the cleric turned and cast a powerful healing spell on my father.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Just then, the ghost came upon him and he was dead within seconds.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>My father, knowing what had happened, ran with all his might.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>The ghost looked up from the cleric, and threw his axe across
a great expanse of land to strike my father in the back.<o:p>
</o:p>
</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt"><span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The white flash returned me to Kaladim and my practice as the ghost was
taking his axe out of my father.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>My
cousins sword was still in motion and struck my soundly on the side.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>I screamed a terrible scream as my vision went black and I fell to the
ground.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I awoke an hour later with
a fright.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I was in the clerics hall
and the remaining clerics were wondering what was wrong with me.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>I leapt up and told them to go into the mountains and get my father,
quickly!<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>They were skeptical as to
how I came to know this, but upon looking in my eyes, they knew that I was very
serious.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>They took some guards and
ran into the mountains to look for what I had told them I had seen.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>They found much more.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span><o:p>
</o:p>
</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt"><span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Not one of the warriors had survived.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Their bodies lay scattered all over the mountains.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>The ghost had done its job very well; it tracked down and killed every
warrior that had been under its command in life.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>The clerics found my father exactly where I said he would be, and he was
still alive.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>When they returned to
Kaladim, the clerics did everything in their power to try to heal his wounds.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>He had been smitten in the back and was going to die, nothing they could
do could prevent that from happening now.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>My
mother sent me home and told me to stay there, but I couldn’t leave my father.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>I stood outside the Cleric Temple and peeked in a window.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>I watched my own father wither away and die within an hour.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span><o:p>

</span>I told the people of Kaladim what I had seen in my vision, and they
laughed at me.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I was a warrior in
training, how could I have seen this with no spiritual training?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Furthermore, how could I have seen all this in the time it took my cousin
to swing a sword?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I was ridiculed
by the learned and went home in shame.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>No
one knew the truth of what I had seen.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I
had seen ultimate evil at work, it had killed many people that I knew and loved.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>I had watched it all happen and no one believed me.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>They all thought I was just worried about my father and got lucky.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>That night after the town was asleep, I rose and kissed my mother
goodbye.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I left that city in
disgust.<o:p>
</o:p>
</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt"><span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>I wandered for months.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I
took boats and walked across vast expanses of terrain.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>I knew not where I was going, or what I hoped to find.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>I only knew that I could not go back to Kaladim as I was.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>I had not completed my training as a warrior, so I was very
vulnerable.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>One day in my travels,
I can upon a cave that very much resembled my home.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>I walked into it only to find that it was inhabited by a race
of dog people.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I knew that this
would be my end.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>They all had great
fangs and were armed with weapons rusty with age.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>I began to run out of the cave and hope for the best.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>As I emerged, I tripped over a rock and fell to the ground.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>I rolled over to see the dog men coming close to me, and I shut my eyes,
I was preparing to join my father.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span><o:p>
</o:p>
</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt">I heard a great howl and the running of feet.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>I opened my eyes to see a very tall looking man standing over me with a
great sword in his hand.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>One of the dog beasts lay dead at his feet.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>This giant of a man took me in his arms and carried me to his home.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>His land was covered in ice and snow, and it was so very cold.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>I was very weary and so I fell asleep in his arms.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>When I awoke, I was in a hut made of straw and lined with great white
furs.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>A very tall woman was
standing over me and rubbing a leaf over my forehead.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>I awoke again to find a different woman looking at me.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>She spoke in an accent I had not heard before, “Aye lad, you be a wee
one eh?”<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>I asked where I was, and she told me I was in the city of
Halas.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I had never heard of this
city, and it seemed to be populated by giants.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>I was scared, and began to cry.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>This
woman comforted me and asked me what was wrong.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>She was the first person to show any compassion to me in months, and so I
told her everything.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I told her of
my home, of my family, of my visions, everything.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>She was amazed at my story.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>She
had never heard of a dwarf!<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>What
kind of a barbarian was this!<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>When
I told her of the evil magics, she became very interested.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>She told me of a similar conflict that her people had with evil a long
time ago.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>A man with a black aura
came to their lands many generations ago.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>He
slew dozens of their warriors and then animated their bodies to fight for him.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>This was exactly what I had been looking for, knowledge.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>She had great knowledge about this Twisted One as she called him.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>She also knew much about the art of healing.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>After a while, I asked her name, “Shatara” was all she
said.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span><o:p>
</o:p>
</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt">I spent many months with her and her people learning
the ways of healing from them.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I
also learned all I could about this Twisted One.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>I wanted to find him and kill him for all the grief he had caused my new
friends and my old family.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I
learned that blunt weapons crushed bones, and that a certain sort of spell was
very effective against the undead.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>After
I had learned much of their ways, I decided to return home to my mother and my
people.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I had learned much from
Shatara and her kind.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I learned
ways of healing that my people knew not of.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>I learned spells that had not been discovered by dwarves.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>I sad farewell to Shatara and to Dragall, who had saved me
from the gnolls, and departed.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Wielding
a new hammer, shield, and elementary magics, I began on the long journey
homeward.<o:p>
</o:p>
</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt">When I returned, Kaladim was in an uproar.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>I had been gone for two years, and I had returned.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>I was thought long dead, and yet here I was.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>I came and taught the clerics of Kaladim what I had learned from these
peoples.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>From there, the clerical
ways grew at an amazing pace; new spells were derived almost daily for weeks.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>I learned the ways of blunt fighting from the warriors, and the ways of
magics from the clerics.<o:p>
</o:p>
</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt">As I was training, I vowed that I would return to
that mansion and destroy the undead that had given it the name “Unrest”.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>I would avenge my father and the other slain dwarves that had given the
mountains the name of “Butcherblock”.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I
would slay my uncle’s ghost and free his spirit.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>After that, I would seek out and destroy this Twisted One so that he
could harm no other being ever again.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span><o:p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt">That is how I became the dwarf I am today.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>I have a vow to uphold, and I will fulfill it or die trying.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>I took on the name MacLear in honor of the barbarians that saved my life
and taught me so much in my youth.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I
am Agravaine MacLear, dwarven cleric of Brell Serilis, and I will be avenged on
the Twisted one.<o:p>
