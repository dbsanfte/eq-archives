    its sweetness. When he awoke from his sleep, he saw close by him a branch of silver with
    white blossoms, nor was it easy to distinguish its bloom from that branch. Then Bran took
    the branch in his hand to his royal house. When the hosts were in the royal house, they

    at them. Bran sent one of his people on the island. He ranged himself with the others, and

    island. Whenever his man came past Bran, his comrades would address him. But he would not

    did not venture to go on shore. The woman throws a ball of thread to Bran straight over
    his face. Bran put his hand on the ball, which clave to his palm. The thread of the ball
    was in the woman's hand, and she pulled the coracle towards the port. Thereupon they went
    into a large house, in which was a bed for every couple, even thrice nine beds. The food
    that was put on every dish vanished not from them. It seemed a year to them that they were
    there,-it chanced to be many years. No savour was wanting to them.</p>
    <p>Home-sickness seized one of them, even Nechtan the son of Collbran. His kindred kept
    praying Bran that he should go to Ireland with him. The woman said to them their going
    would make them rue. However, they went, and the woman said that none of them should touch
    the land, and that they should visit and take with them the man whom they had left in the
    Island of Joy.</p>
    <p>Then they went until they arrived at a gathering at Srub Brain. The men asked of them
    who it was came over the sea. Said Bran: 'I am Bran the son of Febal,' saith he. However,
