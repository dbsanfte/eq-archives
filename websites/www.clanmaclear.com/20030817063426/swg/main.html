      <TR><TD CLASS="block">
        &nbsp; &nbsp; In the days of The First Age, it is said that savagery was among us. For generations beyond
        measure did we fight and plot and toil in the earth until those who would not abide this time would take up
        the talent. They spake aloud and thus began the cinneadh. Among there count grew those who would recount their
        history-- the shamen. The best among them they would call "bard" for they did not speak our history; they put
        it to song. With this they could call sagas long forgotten and enigmas never unraveled and they were raised
        high, for chief among the people was their history.
        <BR>
        <BR>
        &nbsp; &nbsp; And so it was that we would cast aside our old ways and take up the tilling of soil and the
        building of wood homes, that we may live in peace. Thus began The Second Age, as they sought the Gods to ask
        for bountiful food, and children aplenty. The First among them was <B>Lear</B>, who stood among his people as
        chief, thus our name that endures to this day. The Gods they gave names, and the names the shamen would call upon
        with the talent. The cinneadh grew and endured many moons and the shamen and bards kept the lineage. The Gods
        grew weary, though, and set upon the people an abomination. <I>The Tome</I> teaches us that in those times,
        the dead walked among the living.
          <BLOCKQUOTE>&nbsp; ...<I>so that he brought a ruination upon the lands of the north, breathing
          into the dirt a black smoke from which rose an army of corpses who wrought fear, and disease
          and &nbsp;</I>The Consumption<I>. Many among them, once called kin in ages past, now stood as ghastly
          epitaths to their new enemy.</I></BLOCKQUOTE>
        &nbsp; &nbsp; The Dark Ones did summon The Great Tyrant, Aintighearnas that he may again ply his malice. The
        cinneadh was nearly extinguished when...
          <BLOCKQUOTE>&nbsp; ...<I>Lord Lear looked upon the hordes of The Daemon and was shaken by the carnage
          that the Dark Ones had wrought. And he knelt to his knee, touched his bloodied sword to his head and prayed
          to the Great God that he did not know, who was Chief of all the Gods, that he would answer his call for mercy
          and deliver them from the Time of Trials.</I></BLOCKQUOTE>
        &nbsp; &nbsp; The Great God summoned a swirling pool of mist in the sea, that <B>Lear</B> may lead his clan
        through into unknown, but presumably safe lands, as he fought back The Daemon, keeping him at bay. Thus ended
        The Second Age and the Time of Trials. At this, our history fades and it's pages are blank.
        <BR>
        <BR>
        &nbsp; &nbsp; It begins again with runes that have defied understanding until the High Shaman, Ravnanger,
        under Laird Lanandena of Norrath,  comes to us. Pages upon pages of runes and drawings and enigma
        once thought dark among the people-- and seen only by the shamen-- laid before us. Such is the perview
        of the shamen and we will speak of it last.
        <BR>
        <BR>
        &nbsp; &nbsp; <I>The Tome</I> is again silent until it starts again, in a tongue we understand, with
        Agonisty, who would lead the family in a new land, called Britannia. Some in this land wielded powers-- then
        called "arcane"-- and Agonisty was found to possess this. Agonisty, with his brothers Erath and Dolgan, founded
        <I>The Hand of Virtue</I> to maintain power. They built fortresses and routed the unseemly from the roads, but
        the tide was rising. For generations the land of Britannia was war-torn, and <I>The Hand of Virtue</I>
        staid the course. But the minions of The Destroyer came and again breathed his black smoke into the soil.
        The great tower Amun'ris was built that he may lay his dreadful eye upon the land and cast about a great
        darkness. <I>The Hand of Virtue</I> could not sustain under such weight. After decades of strife, Agonisty,
        Erath and Dolgan, like their fathers before them, stayed behind and ushered on their kin to other lands for
        refuge. The fate of the three sons of Lear-kin is lost to us.
         <BR>
         <BR>&nbsp; &nbsp; The land they discovered would some day be called Norrath, and the territory of MacLear
        called Everfrost. Many generations lived on the shores of Norrath, adventuring for glory. The beasts
        were greater in that land, but the people banded together against the enemy, keeping safe. Such
        security did not last. Their ancient enemy, called by some The Consumption, found them again and
        best upon the cinneadh a new villany who's name we write only as The Twisted. A generation of the cinneadh
        was lost in bitter wars against the undead army. Their chief did then fell the foe and The Twisted One fled into
        the frozen steppe where upon the family discovered our greatest treasure. The pride and glory of the family
        was a book of immense power and knowledge. Called <I>The Shaman's Mantra</I> by those more learned and <I>The
        Tome</I> by the lay, this one item, alone, defines MacLear. Quoting <I>The Chronicles of Tormod the Younger</I>:
          <BLOCKQUOTE>
          &nbsp; <I>In hushed voices, those who will speak of it will say that in the time of our grandfathers'
          grandfathers there came through our lands an ancient and powerful user of terrible death magiks. Everything
          that he touched was drained of life and withered. Many of our clan were lost or withered in the terrible and
          strange battle with the Twisted One. After losing many of our kin, the Twisted One tired of our tireless
          pursuit of him and traveled deeper into the heart of the frozen wasteland that is Everfrost. Years after his
          passage an ancient and worn tome of writings was found near a cave, deep in the wastelands. The MacLear shamans
          determined that the book was not of our ken and understanding and must have come from beyond our lands. It is
          believed to have once belonged to the Twisted One.</I> 
          </BLOCKQUOTE>
       &nbsp; &nbsp; It was Lanadena, the All-Seeing who catalogued the "auld tongue", the language of the family in
       more ancient times. It is that tongue, called Gaidhlig by the fluent, that we honor in our daily speech. The
       cinneadh languished in Norrath for many moons before this generation, but it was this time that some of the people
       set out for other shores, a'viking. So it is that hearts grew restless and some among us set out to explore
       other shores. Few have returned from the perilous journey with news of the new sept's victories, but such is
       journaled <A HREF="http://www.siollear.com/main.html">here</A> of our exploits in the land of Mitgaard.
       <BR>
       <BR>
       &nbsp; &nbsp; It was under the tuteledge of Lanadena, in Norrath, that <I>The Tome</I>'s great secret was
       revealed while the expedition abroad was away. The shamen tell us only that the pages of runes once thought
       the incantations of a madman are, in fact, instructions from a Fifth Age. Much time had passed since the reign
       of <B>Lear</B> and much knowlege was lost. Three ages had passed between <B>Lear</B> and Agonisty and we were,
       in fact, still in The Sixth Age, until then dubbed The Third. Thus our timeline was rewritten. If the runes
       speak of our history, the shamen don't speak of it. They tell us the secret that it reveals gave us a chance--
       if only once-- to send an expedition BACK in time, Gods forgive us, to The Fifth Age.</TD>

        &nbsp; &nbsp; So it is that we find ourselves here in The Fifth Age. The honor is great, but do not overstay
        your welcome. Our purpose is singular. We must find <I>The Tome</I> and return it to the cinneadh in Norrath
        that it may be kept out of the hands of The Twisted One. We cannot know what all may result, but such risks
        are called for by the shamen and, thus, it is our charge. Our second goal, if the shamen do not lead us astray,
        is to find the source for <I>The Tome</I>. It is told to us that <I>The Tome</I> in our posession is not the
        original script, but an ancient copy from something we are told many not appear to be a book. Keep a watchful
        eye, bretheren, for chief among us is our history.
        <BR>
        <BR>
        &nbsp; &nbsp; Also, the shamen tell us that we will not find many MacLear here of blood, but rather a cadre
        of mixed races that share our cause. We must join with their kind and bring them into the fold, for they
        truly are kin. Some among them may even be our ancestors.
        <BR>
        <BR>
        &nbsp; &nbsp; Go and bring forth word, cinneadh, of our victories and we may write them down that those we
        call sister and brother in our homes may read of us in another age. Here we make our history.

  <!-- ORIGINAL VERSION &nbsp; &nbsp; During the first age, MacLear was a family of shared blood. The first among us was
        <B>Lear</B>, a great warrior of his time, thus our name that lasts to this day. It is said
        <B>Lear</B> stood among his kin as chief through the Time of Trials, a dynasty plagued by suffering
        and terror at the hands of the unnatural. <I>The Tome</I> teaches us that in those times, the dead
        walked among the living.

        &nbsp; &nbsp; <B>Lear</B> lead his clan through a portal into unknown, but presumably safe lands, as he
        fought back The Daemon. His sacrifice would be remembered in the song <I>Brathair, Ceannard 'a Treubh 'a
        Lear</I>, commissioned by his second son, Agonisty, who would lead the family in this new land, called
        Britannia. Some in this land wielded jedi powers-- then called "arcane"-- and Agonisty was found to possess
        this ability.
         <BR>
         <BR>
        &nbsp; &nbsp; Agonisty, with his brothers Erath and Dolgan, founded <I>The Hand of Virtue</I> in an effort
        to maintain power. They built fortresses and regularly routed the unseemly from the roads, but the tide
        was rising. The land of Britannia was war-torn, and <I>The Hand of Virtue</I> could not sustain under such
        a weight. After decades of strife, Agonisty, Erath and Dolgan, like their father before them, stayed behind
        and ushered on their kin into other lands for refuge. We do not know the fate of the three sons of Lear.
         <BR>
         <BR>&nbsp; &nbsp; The land they discovered would some day be called Norrath, and the territory of MacLear
        called Everfrost. Whether MacLear founded the city there or infused themselves into existing tribes is not
        known. Many generations lived on the shores of Norrath, often adventuring for glory. The beasts were much
        greater in that land, but the people banded together against the enemy, keeping cities safe. Such security
        did not last. Their ancient enemy, called by some The Consumption, found them again. An entire generation
        of the family was lost in bitter wars against the undead army, where upon the family discovered our greatest
        treasure. The pride and glory of the family was a book of immense power and knowledge. Called <I>The Shaman's
        Mantra</I> by those more learned and <I>The Tome</I> by the lay, this one item, alone, defines MacLear.
        Quoting <I>The Chronicles of Tormod the Younger</I>:
          <BLOCKQUOTE>

       &nbsp; &nbsp; Some believe <I>The Tome</I> was lost for some time, but recovered under the reign of Lanadena The
       All-Seeing. It was Lanadena who catalogued the "auld tongue", the language of the family in more ancient times.
       It is that tongue, called G…idhlig by the fluent, that we honor in our daily speech.

       the face of The Empire. We have long stood as a thorn in the side of the so called Emperor. If protecting
       <I>The Tome</I> is our primary, then the struggle against tyranny is our secondary. While the dead no
