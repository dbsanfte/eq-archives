      concisely and placed it on the <A HREF="main.html">starting page</A>. I then made it hidden (you'd
      have to read the source) as Loden might write us a story afterall.

      section will have to remain empty, of course, until we're in-game, playing. I'd like to get stories up
      as quickly as possible, though, so any stories from BETA or stories from anyone familiar with Star Wars
      in general would be nice. The <A HREF="lore.html">Lore</A> section will also remain empty until--
      you know-- we find some, uh... some information. The <A HREF="join.html">Claim Lineage</A> section will
      have to be redone. There are a number of references to DAoC, which make it confusing.

      Mostly, I'm just gutting the content. The <A HREF="family.html">Family</A> page is just a short list of names
      I remember off the top of my head who expressed interest in playing. Loden is there
      for now, whether he intends to play or not. The same goes for all the pages, really.
