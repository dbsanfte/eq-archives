    <td><em>Ravnanger stood on an island in a beautiful sea. The sun was low in
      the sky in a spectacular sunset while wind rustled the leaves of the trees
      around him. There were many people about the simple but grand buildings
      nestled in the grass. Looking about he did not know most of them but some
      of the faces were familiar from the realms of Norrath. Each of them
      bristling with equipment and skill as they waited here on Tranquility, for
      friends, Clan mates, or just allies to press on through the portals.
      Looking about he spied a mountain not far in the distance. From there he
      might be able to see what he searched for</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->

      <em>Following a river cascading down from some high point Ravnanger picked
      his way up the slope. The air became moist as he ascended, the roar of a
      waterfall lay ahead. On the wind carried a tune no bard nor 100 bards
      could master. Pausing, Ravnanger had come to the end of his search. Above
      him pouring out of the mountain was a great torrent of water divided into
      two falls each spilling over one side of a giant set of scales, the Scales
      of Justice. With some trepidation he stepped into he stream of water, his
      arms outstretched as he felt the magiks overtake him. In moments he was in
      a place hellish in nature</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->

      <em>As the wash of magiks faded Ravnanger found himself under a dark
      sullen sky wheeling quickly overhead. He was surrounded by Grey
      featureless stone walls. The air carried the screams of the condemned. At
      his feet were the stones marking the graves of those who would not stand
      an eternity of punishment. In silence he left the graveyard. Out in the
      courtyard there was a small group of people resting or mending wounds.
      Huddled as they were far from the other things here. Instruments of death,
      Guillotine, Hangman's nooses, the executioners block. Once again the
      sounds of the hopeless could be heard.</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->

    <em>Slowly the magiks of the portal in the waterfall releases them into the
    graveyard under the dark foreboding sky amongst screams of the forsaken and
    forgotten. The courtyard is empty of life. Taking her hand he leads her to
    the stairs leading deep into the fortress of the Tribunal. Large riveted
    iron doors seal off corridors of grey stone. At the first corner an
    expedition of adventurers lie in shambles. Their party broken, their flesh
    rent and gnawed upon. A still warm Master lies dead, his fists glowing as
    the mice eat hungrily and cast their magiks on themselves. In silence we
    move along past row upon row of cells. Prisoners of the ages, the forsaken
    and forgotten. Some speak, telling their woes while others are beyond
    contact.</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->

    <em>Startled Ravnanger comes to a halt, Lana almost crashing into him. She
    places a hand on his shoulder as she sees why he stopped. A large cloaked
    figure many hands taller then either of them blocks the corridor on its
    patrol of the cells blocks. It swings its hammer from side to side as it
    passes them as if it never saw them. They watch the sentinel disappear
    around the next corridor before proceeding. Deeper they went, to the place
    where the worst were kept. Here Specters guarded whatever was in the cells,
    prisoners themselves forever.</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->

    <em>Pausing at an intersection they ponder which hall to take as they all
    look the same. Somehow they sense which way to go and open a door off the
    main corridor. This hallway descends, then opens up to a large room flanked
    with many guardians and sentinels. Each godlike in their own right they
    watch with a judging eye as the two shamans pass. Then before them is the
    Warden of this eternal prison. He looks impassively at Rav then longer at
    Lana. His eyes burning into their souls.</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->
