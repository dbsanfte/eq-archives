    &nbsp; &nbsp; Our tales are listed in reverse chronological order, with the oldest tales
    on the bottom. They begin as early as Beta 3. Most of the tales are of true events, with roleplay
    added for flavor. The rest are original fiction.

    &nbsp; &nbsp; <B>Celtic Tales:</B> Our guild is based on Celtic tradition and most of the players
    that have characters in Clan MacLear have Celtic blood running in their veins from times ancient.
    These tales have been passed from father to son for more than a thousand years in the real
    life history of Celtic peoples.
    <BR>
    <BR>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; <B>The Clan MacLear:</B> The Clan MacLear was led in Halas long before the present
    age by Tormod and many heroes who lived in the ages of legend that the gods called Beta.

&nbsp; &nbsp; Loden MacLear became aware he was in a grove of trees. Even though it was still dark,
he could hear the first stirrings of the creatures that know better than we the coming of dawn. As was
his long habit upon waking, he did not move at all or even change his breathing, but extended his
senses around him warily.

&nbsp; &nbsp; Agravaine MacLear is my name and I am a Cleric of the God Brell Serilis. However, this
was not always the case. In my youth, I was trained as a warrior by my father, Adarin Drendaiin, and
his brother, Garanel Drendaiin. I spent many a day practicing with my wooden sword and shield to
become a great warrior like my father...

<a href="tales/recovery.htm">Recovery</a> - by Tormod "the Elder" MacLear<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; On the evening of the 6th day of the year 2000 as dwellers on the plane known as
Reality figure such things, I ventured forth again to that place called Norrath in the world o
Xegony. Some, among them my wife of three decades, call this place where I adventure Unreality
and consider it a place of time wasted and useless exertions.

<a href="tales/The_Tribunal.htm">The Tribunal</a> - by Ravnanger MacLear<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Ravnanger stood on an island in a beautiful sea. The sun was low in the sky in a
spectacular sunset while wind rustled the leaves of the trees around him. There were many people
about the simple but grand buildings nestled in the grass. Looking about he did not know most of
them but some of the faces were familiar...

&nbsp; &nbsp; A cold night swept across my back whilst preying upon the heathen Gnolls of blackburrow
as I had so many times before. That breeze felt good, but it carried something with it. At that time
it was but a mere spark of wonder, curiosity, and reverence. "For Halas, For MacLear!"

&nbsp; &nbsp; Dry and clear-- that's how I remember the air of Ro's Oasis that morn-- a far cry
from our home in the Northlands. Speaking to my brothers we agreed; today we slay giants.

<a href="tales/resurrection.htm" TARGET="_new">Resurrection of Gamaeliel</A> - by Nosferum<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; As the moon waned the unnamed members of Clan MacLear began to gather to Halas again.
Gathering fram as far as Faydwer and as close as Everfrost, their bretheren did come to the Pub and
greet each other with the love only a Clan can appreciate. I cannot tell you all that transpired...

(two tales in one)<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; In the ages of legend long ago that the gods called Beta, Clan MacLear existed.
In those days, the gods did not recognize guilds or clans...<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Nosferum decided to forego his home with the Ashen Order in Freeport to defend Halas.
About three hours before the final Sundering four Gnolls pledged an attack on Halas...

<a href="tales/freeport.htm" TARGET="_new">Quest for the Eastern Sea</A> - by Tormod "The Younger" MacLear<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; I come into the world of Norrath a naked Son of Halas. Note to soft folk: Only you soft
folk call us "barbarian." As we know this is a term that means "uncouth wild person" we except it. 
For it is truth. However, we do not take your term for us as our own.

tureen of hot soup.

&nbsp; &nbsp; In the dark stormy night the wind does howl<BR>
The driven snow is blinding and the cold is mighty foul<BR>
From across the frozen tundra comes the sound of battle<BR>
Brave sons and daughters of Halas showing their mettle<BR>

&nbsp; &nbsp; It was fifty quatrains the woman from unknown lands sang on the floor of the house to
Bran son of Febal, when the royal house was full of kings, who knew not whence the woman had come,
since the ramparts were closed.

&nbsp; &nbsp; The story of the birth of Fin MacCumhail and the founding of the Fenians is as true as
the day is long and the grass is green in Erin. I have it on good authority from unimpeachable sources
among the wee-folk.
