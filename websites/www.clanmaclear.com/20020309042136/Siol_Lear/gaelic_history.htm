&nbsp; &nbsp; The history of the Gaels and their languages (4 are left) is a rough one.
     While we will mainly deal with the Scots Gàidhlig, we definately have to primer
     the other three.

&nbsp; &nbsp; It is incorrect to think of Scotland as a wholly Celtic country.
Since the first millennium BC, Scotland has been a place of multiple 
languages and this tradition continues today. First of all it was 
Pictish and British; then Gaelic, Norse and Scots came and today it's 
English, Scots and Gaelic. Nearly all of Scotland was once Gaelic speaking
except Orkney, Shetland and Caithness which had a variety of Norse
until recent times and East Lothian which was settled by the Angles.
Galloway had a Gaelic community which became separated from the Gaelic
speaking Highlands and Gaelic was still in use until about the 17th
century in Galloway. Gaelic is a Celtic language, like Irish, while Scots is
a Germanic language like English.

&nbsp; &nbsp; Irish is one of the many languages spoken across Europe and as far east as India,
that trace their descent from Indo-European, a hypothetical ancestor-language thought to have
been spoken more than 4,500 years ago. Irish belongs to the Celtic branch of the Indo-European family.
It and three other members of this branch -- Scottish Gaelic, Welsh, and Breton -- are today alive
as community languages. The form of Celtic that was to become Irish was brought to Ireland by the
invading Gaels -- about 300 B.C., according to some scholars. Later it spread to Scotland and the
Isle of Man. Scottish Gelic and Manx gradually separated from Irish (and, more slowly, from each
other), and they can be thought of as distinct languages from the seventeenth century onwards. The
term "Gaelic" may be used to denote all three. It appears that the early Irish learned the art of
writing at the time of their conversion to Christianity, in the fifth century. After that, the
language can be seen to go through four stages of continuous historical development, as far as it's
written form is concerned: Old Irish (approximately A.D. 600-900), Middle Irish (c. 900-1200), Early
Modern Irish (c. 1200-1650), and Modern Irish. Throughout this development Irish borrowed words from
other languages it came into contact with, pre-eminently from Latin, from Norse, from Anglo-Norman
(a dialect of French), and from English. From the earliest times, Irish has been cultivated for
literature and learning. It in fact possesses one of the oldest literatures in Europe.

	  &nbsp; &nbsp; <B>Scottish Gaelic</B>
	  <BR>
	  <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; In Britain (including  Scotland), Brythonic Celtic predates Gaelic by
almost 1000 years or so. Being spoken from Kent up to Glasgow and
across to Wales. Some people even suggest that Brythonic was spoken in
Ireland before Gaelic, but this notion begs the question... "Where did
Gaelic come from and when?" But that's another story. Pictish (possibly a
Celtic language) would probably predate even Brythonic.
  <BR><BR>
<I>(From Scottish Gaelic in Three Months, by Roibeard O Maolalaigh and Iain MacAonghuis, Hugo Language
Books Ltd., 1996)</I><BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Gaelic was brought to Scotland by colonists [ed. refugees] from Ireland towards the
end of the Roman
Empire in Britain. By 500 A.D. these Gaels had established their Kingdom of Dàl Riada, centered on
what is now Argyll in southwest Scotland; in Gaelic, Earra Ghàidheal, "the coastland of the Gael."
To Roman writers they were Scotti -- Scotia at this time denoted Ireland [ed. the Latin name "Scotia"
was no longer used to mean Ireland, but the kingdom we now know in English as Scotland. The war cry
of Scottish soldiers, used in war against the Vikings in 903, against the Danes of  York in 918 and
against the English in 1138, was <I>Albanaigh, Albanaigh</I>] -- although these names cannot be traced
with certainty to an origin in Gaelic itself. But from these Latin forms came the name Scotland.
In Gaelic, however, the country is Alba, as in Irish Gaelic, and Alban in Welsh. [ed. It is important
to realise that the modern national geographical boundaries of Ireland and Scotland did not exist; only
a narrow channel of water. Gaels secured a lasting success in Scotland when Dal Riada under Kenneth
Mac Alpine, became merged with the Pictish kingdom of Fortrui, which had already consolidated
Pictish authority to a large degree.]
	 <BR><BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <B>Pictish</B>:  The Picts were Celts but spoke a mixture of languages.
They spoke a pre-Celtic language for ritualistic purposes (source: Prof
Derek Thompson - "Why Gaelic matters"), and Pictish at other times.
Pictish is mentioned in The Cambridge Encyclopedia of Language as possibly
being Celtic or possibly being a non-Indo-European isolate like Basque.
Thompson says "It is clear from the evidence of place names that there
was much common ground between [Brythonic] and the Celtic constituent
of Pictish". There is some debate as to whether Pictish was non Indo-European or not,
as there is so little information available on it.
<BR><BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Many of the Scottish Island names including Arran, Skye, Lewis and Jura
are Pictish. For more information on placenames: (W.F.H. Nicolaisen
"Scottish Place Names", Batsford, London 1976). 	 
<BR><BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; As to Gaelic and English in Scotland, The Highlands of Scotland were
occupied by Picts and the Lowlands were occupied by Brythonic Celts.
The Romans  occupying the Lowlands during this time and when the Romans
left in 407, they left a weak kingdom, but still brythonic. The Scots
(Gaelic speaking) extended their region of Dalriada into Argyllshire,
between 500 and 550. The Angles  extended the Kingdom of Northumbria
into Lothian, Berwick, Selkirk, Peebles  and Roxburgh. As far as I am
aware these areas are in present day Scotland. The Angles spoke a 
dialect of what is know today as "Old English". The Angles moved into 
this area about 540 -600,  these are rough dates. As time went 
on, Scotland was left with 4 distinct areas. Dalriada, Pictland,
Strathclyde and Lothian (Northumbria). In 625 the Northumbrian Kingdom
stretched from the Humber to the Forth and was ruled by Edwin. In 685
the Northumbrians decided to try and extend Northumbria into Pictland
and hence invaded the Picts, but this was a big mistake. The
Northumbrian army was defeated by the Picts and eventually Northumbria
lost supremacy to the Southern Saxons. (Also why RP is based on
Southern English and Not Northumbrian ???). The Picts became the
supreme overlords of the Scots in Dalriada and the Brythonic Celts in
Strathclyde. 
<BR><BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; About 785, Pictland started to receive attacks from bands of Norse
invaders and these lead to Pictish defeats and in the 830 (approx), the
Norse invaders made permanent settlements.
<BR><BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; In 843 Dalriada threw off Pictish control, where upon the Scots King
Kenneth  MacAlpine laid claim to the Pictish throne through the Celtic
law of Tanistry. Followed by the union of the Picts and the Scots. The
now "United Kingdom" tried to oust the Northumbrians from Lothian but
were  unsuccessful. At this time the Norse people occupied the Western
Isles, Northern Isles and Caithness.
<BR><BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The Scots allied themselves to the English to get rid of the Norse
Invaders and sometimes allied themselves with the Norse to get rid of
the English.
<BR><BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; It was not until 1018 that the Scots Kingdom managed to remove Lothian
from the hands of the Northumbrians and in 1034 the Scots, Angles,
British and Picts were a United Kingdom of Scotland.
<BR><BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; As far as I am aware MacBeth was the last of the Gaelic Kings, and he
himself was followed by Malcolm, whose wife (an English lass) moved the
royal court to Edinburgh around about 1070. At this time many
persecuted English people moved into Lothian from England due to Norman
Conquest. The English who were persecuted in England flourished in
Scotland.
<BR><BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The real point of all the above is that English has been spoken since
the 6th Century in Scotland. Not all of it but quite a large piece. The modern Scots
language dates back to the first Angle invasions at this time. Incidentally whilst parts
of Scotland were English speaking, parts of England were still Celtic speaking {eg;
West Yorkshire Kingdom of Elmet and part of Cumbria.)
To sum up English has been spoken for longer in Edinburgh than in Leeds.

&nbsp; &nbsp; By the eleventh century [ed. The Dark Ages], Gaelic was at its highest point in
Scotland and known to some
degree virtually throughout the country. A Gaelic-speaking court, supported by the Columban church,
gave patronage to makers of literature at the highest levels of society. With the Anglicisation of
the dynasty late in that century, what was been described as a shift to an English way of life was
deliberately planned and, as far as possible, implemented. The court itself became English and
Norman-French in Speech and the northern English dialect (Inglis) was fostered as the official
language. The loss of status that these changes entailed for Gaelic had a profound and permanent
effect.  In the mid-twelfth century the Lordship of the Isles, founded in part on the Norse kingdom
of the Western and Southern Isles[ed. Norway officially returned control of the Hebrides to the
Scottish crown in 1266.], but drawing also on the traditions of a former, wider Gaelic
territory, emerged as a quasi-independent state. Until the Lordship was destroyed by the central
authorities of Scotland in the late fifteenth century, Gaelic culture and learning continued to
flourish. In the same twelfth century a reorganized literary order, whose main centers were in
Ireland, was codifying Gaelic to produce an elegant formal register of the language, which we call
Classical Gaelic. It was common to the learned classes of Ireland and Scotland and taught to the
children of the aristocracy. It lasted in Scotland until the eighteenth century.
	 <BR>
	 <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; While it is true that the history of the language is largely one of resistance to
ethnocidal policies that sought to exclude the Gaels from the world of post-Renaissance Europe,
contemporary developments in education, radio and television, and in literature generally, aim
to redress the balance. And it should be noted that some of the most interesting writers now
active on the literary scene are not native speakers but learners of Gaelic.
	 <BR>
	 <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The eighteenth and nineteenth centuries saw large numbers of Gaelic speakers removed
from their land in the Highlands and Islands by landlords. Many were forced to emigrate and Gaelic
communities were established in parts of Nova Scotia (Alba Nuadh). There is still a considerable
number of Gaelic speakers in Cape Breton Island (Eilean Cheap Breatainn), but the language is largely
confined to the older generation. Enforced exile has given way this century to voluntary emigration,
and expatriate Gaelic-speaking Scots are all over the world, but especially in Canada and the United
States (Na Stàitean Aonaichte). Many Gaels have also moved south to England for employment.

&nbsp; &nbsp; <B>The Celtic Languages</B>
	 <BR>
	 <BR>
<I>(From Dictionary of Celtic Mythology by James MacKillop, Oxford Univ. Press, 1998)</I><BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The Celtic languages: a subfamily of the Indo-European Family of languages. In
antiquity, speakers of Celtic languages could be found in what is today Turkey (the Galatians
of the Apostle, Paul's, letters), the Balkans, and most of central and western Europe from the
Danube valley to the British Isles, including large portions of northern Italy and the Iberian
peninsula. In modern times the living Celtic languages have been Irish and Scottish Gaelic, and
Manx (now extinct) from the Goidelic or Q Celtic branch, and Welsh, Cornish (now extinct), and
Breton from the Brythonic, Cymric, or P Celtic branch. Despite stereotypes, the Celtic languages
have been spoken by a wide variety of physical types, from short and dark to tall and fair.
Much controversy surrounds speculation on the meaning of the word Celtic. It appears to be derived
from the Greek, keltoi, used to denote people a people north of what is now Marseilles. Julius
Caesar also reported that the Gauls described themselves as Celtae. The perception that the Celtic
languages were all related was slow in coming, and thus the word "Celtic" did not always denote
all the Celtic-speaking peoples. Classical commentators did not call the inhabitants of the
British Isles Celts, and the word "Celt" has no counterpart in Old Irish or Old Welsh, as speakers
of those languages did not see themselves as forming a linguistic community. The term "Celtic
language" was not used in English with its present meaning until the beginning of the eighteenth
century.
