&nbsp; &nbsp; The Celts (pronounced with a hard C like "Claymore") appear in Europe
as a group of peoples who spoke languages in the Celtic branch of the
Indo-European family of languages. Other branches of the Indo-European
family are Albanian, Anatolian, Armenian, Balto-Slavic, Germanic
(includes  English), Greek, Indo-Iranian, Italic (Latin based) and
Tocharian. European languages *not* belonging to the Indo-European group 
are Basque, Hungarian, Finnish, Estonian and Lappish (also called Saami). 
Basque is notable in that it is almost certainly a remnant of the languages 
present in Europe <B>before</B> the Indo-European expansion.  Hungarian, however, 
was brought from the East at a later date. Pictish (now extinct) was also
probably non IE, more of this later.
<BR><BR> 
&nbsp; &nbsp; The Celts evolved from the <B>Urnfield Culture</B> (given that name because
of the burial system of cremation and placement of ashes in urns which in turn were 
buried in fields)  much earlier than the Romanized Celtic world of the late 500-400 BC.
<BR><BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; I use the word "evolve" because it is difficult to define just when the
Celts became a culture unto themselves.  That said, a culture can be
defined according to economic stability, shared religious beliefs and
social structure. 
<BR><BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Around 1500-1000BC, the Celts lived in an area which today is mostly in 
Eastern France. The area stretched from roughly where Luxembourg is today
to a bit further south than Geneva and took in parts of modern day
West Germany and Switzerland. It was an area a little bigger than the
island of Ireland.

&nbsp; &nbsp; The Celts then expanded to cover an area covering most of Western
Europe and Central Europe. Around 400BC, the Celts lived in what
is now the UK, France (i.e. Gaul), Belgium, Switzerland, Austria, and the Czech and
Slovak Republics. Celts also lived in parts of Spain, northern Italy, The Netherlands,
the southern half of Germany, and parts of Poland and Russia (source: "The
Story of English", Faber and Faber; BBC books 1992).</FONT></TD></TR></TABLE>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; After the height of their power, the Celts (the first Indo-European
group to spread across Europe) were pushed north and west by successive
waves of Indo-European peoples, notably Germanic and Latin based. The main
migration was by the Galli or Gauls into France, northern Italy and the
north of Europe. 
<BR><BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; It is only relatively recently that archaeologists have begun to
refer to the Celts as a civlization at all and only more recently that they have
vaulted to the status of "Great Civilization." Previously, only the Romans and Greeks
were believed to reach that status during the Bronze Age, but in recent findings it
appears that the Celts, too, had equal power, culture and influence. It doesn't hurt
to sac and ransom the greatest city in history as well-- Rome.
<BR><BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Keep in mind as you look at the map above, that borders are a remarkably
tricky line. We are attempting to show where the <B>culture</B> reached, not some singular,
organized society. You might say "Hey, Celts had more land than the Romans !" That would be
improper, of course, because the Celts were not a singular society, nor were they organized.
Also, we can pretty much be assured that their influence never covered all that area at any
given point in time. We are talking about an intangible force spanning a thousand years or more.
