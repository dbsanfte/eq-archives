          <I>The Legend of the Siol Lear</I>
          - as recited by our laird, Loden MacLear
     <BR>
     <BR>
      &nbsp; The Sons of Lear or in the eldritch tongue, <i>Siol Lear</i>, live today in 
      Midgard of Percival but it has not always been so. Long, long ago, in a time 
      beyond times, Lear was born in this land. To the north was the land of fire and 
      ice and to the south were the sea and wastelands. Lear, and the peoples others 
      came to call “Norse,” lived in the “middle–land” called in their tongue <i>Mitgaard.</i> 
      The people into whom Lear was born called themselves the <i>Siol,</i> meaning “sons” 
      or “people,” believed Mitgaard <i>was</i> the whole world of mortals. The legend 
      of Lear says that the Siol were the first mortals to live in Mitgaard, granted 
      leave to do so by Odin All-Father himself after fleeing from some great disaster 
      that befell the world of men.
     <BR> 
     <BR>
      &nbsp; The Siol lived in as hunters and fishers in the coastal forests and fjords of 
      Mitgaard. Gradually others began to come to the homeland of the Siol, each 
      claiming they were first in the land. From the dense forests in the south of 
      Mitgaard came the giant Trolls. From the mountains to the west came those we 
      call Kobolds. Others of the race we call human came from the forests and hills 
      of Mitgaard. Now the Siol were a wanderung folk who loved to venture out for 
      days and weeks, hunting, exploring, and raiding the godless peoples. They soon 
      found that the new races were often honorable and worshiped the same gods as the 
      Siol, and thereby were not to be raided or made war with. Still, the Siol soon 
      felt the pressure of many people in the land that had long been theirs alone. It 
      was in those days that the Blodfeleg separated themselves from all god fearing 
      folk and began to war on those that followed Odin All-Father. They rebelled 
      against the gods and hated all those who were not like them and all who 
      associated with the other races. A great war began between the Siol and the 
      Blodfeleg that is not settled to this day.
     <BR> 
     <BR>
      &nbsp; Under the pressure of more and more &quot;others&quot; in the land and facing 
      the continued raids of the Blodfeleg, Lear and his sons chose to go a' Viking, 
      which meant in the auld language to “venture out and find new lands.” Little 
      understanding such things, it was then the new races first began to call the 
      Siol “Vikings.”
     <BR> 
     <BR>
      &nbsp; The Sons of Lear ventured out to a newly found land simply called The 
      Highlands where they settled and lived in peace for many years. It was in that 
      land that the Sons of Lear first took the surname MacLear. Again, though, there 
      came into the land new races. Humans from the land of Albion soon began to 
      attack their villages. The soldiers of Albion slaughtered their women and 
      children as if they were animals and showed them no respect or honor as people. 
      Their Chief or King was called Uther Pendragon and was a warrior without 
      understanding or honor in anything he did. It soon became clear that MacLear 
      could not stand against the Pendragon’s endless hordes. The High Council of 
      MacLear met with Lear and determined that once again, the Siol must find new 
      lands.
     <BR> 
     <BR>
      &nbsp; MacLear viking’d to the south and east in their long boats. Agonisties, 
      a Son of Lear, was the first to find the land across the Ether Sea, now known as 
      Britannia, where he offered allegiance to Lord British and the gods of that land. 
      Lear and his other sons, Daran, Conan, and Erath, soon joined him. Those 
      northern lands, oft covered in snow and cut by deep fjords reminded the Siol of 
      their ancient home in Mitgaard and they settled there. The land was wild and 
      filled with wild and strange beasts that the Clan MacLear soon learned to defeat 
      both on the land and beneath it in the many caves and ancient dungeons.
     <BR> 
     <BR>
      &nbsp; Soon others wished to join the Sons of Lear and so was born The Hand of 
      Virtue, who’s Chief was Agonisties MacLear. The Hand of Virtue was a band of 
      citizens who guarded the roads leading out of Britain to the Northlands. All 
      those who joined with MacLear in those days called themselves <i>The Free People</i> 
      and first began greeting each other with the words, “I salute you as a free 
      person!” or in the language of that place <i><u>Mi failtich thu co saor neach!</u> </i>For 
      many seasons the Hand of Virtue fought well and defended the roads and commerce 
      between the Highlands and Britain. Finally even Lord British was driven from 
      Britannia by the bands of murderers. The Clan MacLear withdrew back into the 
      frozen highlands where they carved out a small portion of that land to call 
      their own and defended it against the savages who were devastating the rest of 
      Britannia.
     <BR> 
     <BR>
      &nbsp; Once again, MacLear believed they had found rest as their fighters were 
      grouped into well organized bands and the terrain lent itself to defense. They 
      were easily able to defend themselves against the tribes called <i>PeeKay </i>in 
      their strange and twisted language and even enjoyed venturing out of their new 
      homeland to ambush the bandits.
     <BR> 
     <BR>
      &nbsp; So it was until a foul daemon ruler of the undead came against MacLear. 
      He poisoned the land and brought death and destruction wherever he went. Hoards 
      of Undead followed him and acknowledged him as their lord liege and soon the 
      bandits and killers joined in the madness and destruction. MacLear fought 
      against them hard and long but soon realized that they once again must migrate 
      to some new land in order to survive. In the battle to cover the withdrawal, 
      Lear their first Laird, was slain, but Siol Lear and many of those who had 
      joined themselves to the Siol were able to board the longboats and escape. 
      Agonisties rallied the remaining fighters and began a campaign of guerilla 
      warfare that continued to harass and extract revenge on the bandits for many 
      years thereafter.
     <BR> 
     <BR>
      &nbsp; After a long journey through the darkness and myst that had descended 
      on the world, Siol Lear came ashore in a new land called by its inhabitants, <i>Norrath 
      of Xegony. </i>They soon swore allegiance to the gods of light in that land and 
      were granted the right to settle in Halas a city hidden in a land of eternal 
      snow and ice, surrounded by high mountains and protected by a maze of passes 
      through a region the Siol learned to call <i>Everfrost</i>. One of their first 
      actions was to elect a new Laird in the land of Norrath, Leod MacLear, a son of 
      Erath, who was a son of Laird Lear himself.
     <BR> 
     <BR>
      &nbsp; Leod was a fiery warrior who led the clan in battle to secure the land 
      they had claimed as their own. His hatred of the undead and those who associated 
      with them was famous across the new land and earned him, and the Clan MacLear, 
      the eternal enmity of the very kingdom of the undead. From far away Miragul 
      heard of MacLear’s war on the kingdom of the undead. Miragul was a great Wizard 
      whose advances in power distorted his very being until he became so entwined 
      with the majiks of Undeath that he became one who had not died but was part of 
      their kingdom, caught between the world of Undeath and the world of the living. 
      In his inability to return to the living he evolved a hatred of all that was 
      alive until that very hate was the force that gave him immortality, but deprived 
      him of his soul. Soon he assumed leadership of the Undead in the land of Norrath. 
      He survived on his hate by spreading fear and terror amongst the free people of 
      the living. The living soon became afraid even to speak his name and began 
      calling him <i>The Twisted One.</i>
     <BR> 
     <BR>
      &nbsp; Miragul came out of his home in the east to make war on the Free People. 
      A time of darkness came upon Norrath as hordes of Undead belched out of the deep 
      holes in the earth slaughtering the Free People wherever they found them. It was 
      then that Laird Leod called upon the gods to join with MacLear to defeat 
      the Twisted One. In the battle that followed, the Clan, which was in those days 
      mostly Barbarians of Norrath, was reduced to a small part of its strength so 
      that to this day there are only small villages of Barbarians in the lands where 
      they once ruled and in others only ruins mark the places where The Free People 
      once dwelt.
     <BR> 
     <BR>
      &nbsp; Much is written of those, the first Days of Darkness, in the scrolls of 
      the <a HREF="../frmmac.htm">Clan MacLear of Norrath</a> as the Clan and the Free 
      People struggled against the forces of the Twisted One. The Twisted one followed 
      them to Everfrost where the final battle of the Days of Darkness occurred. Laird 
      Leod and the Clan MacLear defeated Miragul and his horde in a long and bloody 
      battle on the plains of Everfrost. The great forces unleashed by both sides in 
      that battle laid ruin to the great temples and buildings that once crowned the 
      civilization of that icy land. Miragul was banished by the gods to a cave deep 
      under the ice where he is said to still dwell in agony and hatred of MacLear and 
      the Free People. Even imprisoned beneath the ice by wards keeping him locked in 
      his dark cave, Miragul continued to study the secrets of the Undead. From his 
      prison he learned to send his soul out to capture the mind of mortals.
     <BR> 
     <BR>
      &nbsp; After the banishment of Miragul, the Clan MacLear began again to 
      venture out into the lands of Norrath. Following the death of Lear, the Free 
      People elected Tormod MacLear to lead them again against the remnants of the 
      followers of The Twisted One. Tormod spoke to the gods who answered him and 
      promised their support against the forces of darkness. The Free People would 
      once again be heard throughout Norrath. For many seasons, the young Laird Tormod 
      led the Clan MacLear to destroy the forces of the Undead and those who called 
      upon them until the central lands of Antonia in Norrath once again rang with the 
      battle cry “For Halas! For MacLear!”
     <BR> 
     <BR>
      &nbsp; Once while Laird Tormod was away from Norrath on a journey to meet with 
      the Sons of Lear in Britannia, one of the trusted leaders of the Clan MacLear, 
      an esteemed member of the High Council, fermented a rebellion against the 
      officers Tormod had charged with leadership in his absence. It was only later 
      that the Siol came to realize he was an agent of the Twisted One who had 
      infiltrated The Free People. The light of MacLear waned as they fought amongst 
      themselves, led astray by the lies spread by the follower of The Twisted One. 
      Laird Tormod returned to rally the Clan and do battle with the traitor. Miragul 
      had granted him invincibility though, and he could not be harmed by any force 
      known to man. By careful words and deep majiks, Laird Tormod was able to cause 
      the Twisted One’s servant to ban himself from our people. Afterward his name was 
      wiped from our scrolls and sagas lest in speaking it we would call him back to 
      us and again unleash his lies and deceit upon our people.
     <BR> 
     <BR>
      &nbsp; Over the many seasons that followed, an older Laird Tormod led the Clan 
      into all the continents of Norrath and the Free People grew in number and in 
      honor throughout Norrath. Even in the midst of the peace and unity that came in 
      those days, darkness came again out of Neriak. The Dark Elf, Lady Morgaene of 
      Darkmoon and her legion of masters of the undead emerged to challenge the Free 
      People once again in Norrath. Many battles ensued with brave warriors and 
      workers of majiks on both sides littering the land with their corpses.
     <BR> 
     <BR>
      &nbsp; Tormod and the shamans of the Clan called upon the gods of Norrath 
      again and again as the spells of the Free People oft times seemed to have no 
      effect on the followers of Morgaene. While in battle, the Free People were 
      commonly affected by a wasting sickness that was not of Darkmoon but a curse of 
      the gods. In all the battles, the gods would not answer Tormod or any of the 
      Free People, but were seen standing in conversation with the Dark Elves.
     <BR> 
     <BR>
      &nbsp; In the end, Darkmoon was driven back out of all the lands except their 
      home city of Neriak. As MacLear closed in on their dark homeland, the Lady 
      Morgaene emerged and acknowledged Tormod “Laird” and her nobles called him “My 
      Lord Tormod.” Tormod faced them, long tired of endless warfare and disgusted 
      with the gods who had withdrawn from his people, accepted her submission. He 
      caused her and her nobles to swear that as they called forth the dead, they 
      would solely call forth those warriors who had not been privileged to die in 
      battle and so had not been allowed entrance to Valhalla. She further swore that 
      such undead warriors would be given the opportunity to die in battle or be slain 
      by the caller in fair combat. As is so oft true though, the elves did lie and to 
      this day harass and attack MacLear in Norrath.
     <BR> 
     <BR>
      &nbsp; After the defeat of Darkmoon, Tormod retired to Halas to rest and recover 
      from his wounds. As he meditated a voice came to him out of the darkness. Olaf 
      the Black, Tormod’s father, who had gone a 'Viking many years before was calling 
      to him. Olaf the Black called from Valhalla that he had found his way back to 
      their ancient home but had died fighting a strange race of savages called the 
      Tomte. He challenged the Sons of Lear and all who had been adopted into their 
      fellowship to return to Midgard of Percival as it was now called, and avenge his 
      death.
     <BR> 
     <BR>
      &nbsp; Recognizing his age, his wounds, and the need for him to stay in 
      Norrath and lead the colonists there, Tormod called upon his brothers Loden and 
      Torveig to avenge the death of their father and sent them forth to Midgard. As 
      the word spread that Loden and Torveig were to go a' Viking many of the Sons of 
      Lear claimed the ancient privilege of Viking allowing them to accompany Loden 
      and Torveig. Word was sent to Agonisties and Daran in Britannia where they had 
      been granted the boon of long life of the call to Viking. They too were weary of 
      struggling against the bandits and a new wave of the followers of the twisted 
      that was sweeping across Britannia, the savage tribe of <i>
      EL1T3 D00DZ
      </i> who having twisted their own existences into a perversion of life, sought 
      to destroy all those who would follow the old ways.
     <BR> 
     <BR>
      &nbsp; Lanadena, the Shamaness MacLear read the runes of the gods of Midgard 
      and brought the word to Clan MacLear that the newly rediscovered Midgard was at 
      war with Albion and Hibernia. With the death of Uthur’s Son, Arthur of Camelot, 
      his followers had been unleashed to attack Midgard. Sensing a weakness, the 
      vicious Elves of Hibernia had also vowed to exterminate the citizens of the 
      realm of Midgard and had begun moving toward the boundary of the realms.
     <BR> 
     <BR>
      &nbsp; Tormod called upon the gods of Midgard and asked that the Clan MacLear 
      be granted a boon to come again to their ancient home Even as the Free People 
      set off to Midgard of Percival full of enthusiasm and desire to reclaim their 
      homeland and to extract vengeance on the Albions and Hibernians. Within a day of 
      their arrival in Midgard, the gods spoke to Torveig and later to Loden granting 
      the right of settlement with the provisions that The Free People reclaim their 
      ancient name, Siol Lear, fight the forces of darkness that had infiltrated the 
      land, and defend the realm against its enemies.
     <BR> 
     <BR>
      &nbsp; In the days that followed, Clan MacLear assembled in the Hall of Names 
      in the city of Jordheim and &nbsp;was granted the name Siol Lear. On that day, 
      The Free People elected Loden MacLear their Chief in the land of Midgard. Those 
      among the Siol that had been accorded kinship in the ages gone by commonly took 
      the surname MacLear in remembrance of the land from which they had been unjustly 
      evicted by the soldiers of Albion and to commemorate their oath to reclaim their 
      home.
     <BR> 
     <BR>
      &nbsp; It was given as a boon to all those who were adopted by the Clan MacLear or 
      were descendants of those so adopted in any of the lands the Clan had once lived, 
      to take the surname MacLear in memory of those days and to bear witness to their 
      stolen homeland in the Highlands of Albion. All others were to take the name 
      only after application to the High Council of Siol Lear and approval by the 
      Chief.
