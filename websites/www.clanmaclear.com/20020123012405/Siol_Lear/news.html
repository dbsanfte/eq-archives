        <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ronod had the completely brilliant idea to start a
        Team Sound server so that the Siol Lear could communicate via voice
        chat.&nbsp; This helps greatly in RvR and is a lot of fun even in PvE.&nbsp;
        In the <b><a href="lore.html">Lore</a></b>
        section near the bottom of the page, you can link to the Team Sound tutorial and download the
        program.&nbsp;&nbsp;</font></p>

        <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There is now a PayPal donate button on the right side
        of this page about halfway down the page.&nbsp; My PayPal identity is
        &quot;Mac Inc.&quot;&nbsp; The clicking the donate button will link you
        to the PayPal Secure Server and will allow you to set up a monthly
        donation of $5.&nbsp; If you ever want to stop donating, just go to
        PayPal and cancel your subscription to the monthly donation billing.&nbsp;</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I want to note that
        donating is completely optional.&nbsp; I fully expect that we'll
        actually have a rush of folks who want to help out.&nbsp; Don't feel bad
        if you didn't get to contribute.&nbsp; If you would like to be put on
        the waiting list to contribute in case someone stops their monthly
        donations send me an email at <a href="mailto:joshua@clanmaclear.com">joshua@clanmaclear.com</a>
        and I will add you to the waiting list.&nbsp; If we have a large number
        of folks on the waiting list then we can simply reduce the amount each
        person is donating so that more people can feel like they are helping to
        carry the Clan financially.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Clan's hosting
        costs average around $40 per month.&nbsp; I am going to contribute my
        share of $5 per month, so we have $35 left to raise.&nbsp; I'll make a
        listing that shows how much is being donated each month and those who
        have contributed to the cause.&nbsp; ;-)&nbsp; After you donate send me
        an email at <a href="mailto:joshua@clanmaclear.com">joshua@clanmaclear.com</a>
        to let me know what Clan member name you want to have recognized for the
        contribution.</font></p>

        Updates </b><a href="mailto:joshua@clanmacear.com">Torveig</a><br>
        <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Added the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.camelotherald.com/">CamelotHerald.com</a>
        link above on this page.&nbsp; Added links to Siol Lear realm points on <a target="_blank" href="http://www.camelotherald.com/">CamelotHerald.com</a>
        and realm frontier keeps status.&nbsp; Note: the keep status page also
        shows the top 20 guilds by realm points for the entire server.&nbsp;&nbsp;
        Also removed the advertising banners at the tops of all the pages.&nbsp;
        Although there was general support for it on the message board, when the
        advertising was added I got some complaints.&nbsp; So, &quot;its&nbsp;no
        big deal&quot; as Bill Murray put it on Caddy Shack.&nbsp; ;-)&nbsp;
        I'll add a donate button instead.&nbsp; I request that you do not donate
        more than $5 per person per month.&nbsp; That way we can all share the
        cost of hosting instead of one us &quot;owning&quot; the site.</font></p>

        [Uliam]</a><br>
        <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Laird Tormod was able to send me fresh copies of many
        of the original MacLear tales for the EQ section. Of course, this fixed
        the links on the Siol Lear tales page as well.<br>
        <br>
        <b>11-29-01 - Lore Updates (maps and other info) </b><a href="mailto:joshua@clanmacear.com">Torveig</a><br>
        <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Added links to maps to all frontiers areas in Midgard,
        Hibernia and Albion.&nbsp; All map links are marked with an
        &quot;S&quot; if they lead to information about monster spawns and could
        be considered spoilers.&nbsp; They are marked with &quot;SF&quot; if
        they are Spoil Free.&nbsp; Also added links to daoc.catacombs.com
        (excellent class specialization information) and to
        camelot.allakhazam.com which has a great item database.&nbsp; I also
        saved copies of all the maps on our site in case the sites that
        currently host them go belly up in the future.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>11-23-01 - More Updates</b> <a href="mailto:nosferum@premiernet.net">Nosferum
        [Uliam]</a><br>
        <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Changed the logo that covers the top of every page
        just a bit, in accordance with the Laird and his lady.<br>
        <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Modified the Roster as requested, both times. We are
        looking at giving each player their own page so we don't have to fill
        one huge page with all that information. One potential problem, though,
        is that some character pages would be huge and I'm sure others would be
        virtually empty. I like a level of uniformity, but we'll see.<br>
        <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I added large sections to the <a href="file://C:/Documents%20and%20Settings/Joshua/Local%20Settings/Temporary%20Internet%20Files/Content.IE5/41IB45I3/gael.htm"><b>Gaelic
        Language</b></a> , <a href="file://C:/Documents%20and%20Settings/Joshua/Local%20Settings/Temporary%20Internet%20Files/Content.IE5/41IB45I3/gaelic_history.htm"><b>History</b></a>
        and now a <a href="file://C:/Documents%20and%20Settings/Joshua/Local%20Settings/Temporary%20Internet%20Files/Content.IE5/41IB45I3/celt.htm"><b>Celtic
        History</b></a> page. Yes, I know it's confusing, but the fact of the
        matter is that it <b>is</b> going to be confusing.<br>
        <br>
        <b>11-13-01 - Lore Page</b> <a href="mailto:nosferum@premiernet.net">Nosferum

        <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Moved the <a href="file://C:/Documents%20and%20Settings/Joshua/Local%20Settings/Temporary%20Internet%20Files/Content.IE5/41IB45I3/Maps/Midgard[1].jpg"><b>Map
        of Midgard</b></a> link to the <a href="file://C:/Documents%20and%20Settings/Joshua/Local%20Settings/Temporary%20Internet%20Files/Content.IE5/41IB45I3/lore.html"><b>Lore</b></a>
        section. In fact, I'll probably put some more info there. Unlike the
        Tome in our EQ section, I don't plan on making the most definitive
        source of info. There are already a hundred sites out there with better
        information-- no reason to re-invent the wheel.<br>

        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Our sister in Norrath, Lanadena, deserves great
        credit for bringing forth the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.calsnet.net/cmacdaoccal"><b>Calendar</b></a>.
        I have set it up, but haven't tested it yet, so beware. If it happens to
        work, please use the heck out of it. I would use a static version of it
        on our end, but I don't claim to have the time to keep it fresh, so I'll
        cheat and use someone else's.<br>

        <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Loden made an excellent page for our language. I
        fidgeted with the formatting a bit and added two more pages accessible
        from the <a href="file://C:/Documents%20and%20Settings/Joshua/Local%20Settings/Temporary%20Internet%20Files/Content.IE5/41IB45I3/gael.htm"><b>Our

        [Uliam]</a><br>
        <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We've pretty much finished the first version of the
        site. Torveig was gracious enough to upload the <a href="file://C:/Documents%20and%20Settings/Joshua/Local%20Settings/Temporary%20Internet%20Files/Content.IE5/41IB45I3/frmjoin.htm"><b>Join</b></a>
        form and make it look all pretty. Today, I basically fixed the
        formatting on all the pages so they would be precisely the same, as well
        as updated the roster many times over.<br>
        <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Note: Alt-Tabbing out in PvP is a current exploit
        being resolved by Mythic. Apparently, it allows cheaters and cowards to
        avoid PvP death. This explains all the corpses in RvR that stand up
        (they aren't dead). Not that I need to say it, but just for measure, any
        Siol found doing this will be immediately deguilded-- I kid you not.<br>

        <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I'm revising this all in the few short minutes before
        our first official meeting as Siol Lear. Fortunately, FP 2000 allows me
        to make and modify using HTML so I don't have to fidget with the editor.
        The pages will all be changing a bit, but for now this will do. Also,
        expect the News section here to be updated. **update** Yes, I know one
        of the images on the front doesn't work. I have the pic elsewhere right
        now, but should function fine tomorrow. I have given up on using CSS (gotta
        make those links pretty) but we may reactivate it all later if we want.
        I have not yet tested the site in Netscape (it probably won't look
        right).<br>
        <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We had our first official gathering today ! We
        discussed many issues such as guild colors (5s brown armor) and an
        eventual 10% tithe of all hunting money. As well, we honored those who
        gave to the 300g &quot;Emblem Fund,&quot; promoted Orden to Black Watch,
        promoted several other members to Kin or High Council as appropriate. In
        addition, many plans have been laid for the future. <i>/em raises a hdn
        in salute</i>.<br>

        <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; By the time you see this site, there will be another
        update. The only people seeing this update as &quot;new&quot; are Loden
        and myself. I'm making each of the pages out now, and waiting for Loden
        to decide (a) if we're even redoing the site and (b) what sort of color
        and tone we are setting. Yes, the site looks better in IE than Netscape.
        That's because AOL owns Netscape and AOL is inferior to M$. =)
        Specifically, the links hover and the text is slightly different in IE.</font></p>

          &quot;The Romans then asked whether it was right to demand land from
          its owners on pain of war, indeed what were the Celts doing in Etruria
          in the first place? The latter defiantly retorted that their right lay
          in their arms: <b>To the brave belong all things</b>.&quot;<br>

          &quot;It is not the critic who counts; not the man who points out how
          the strong man stumbles, or where the doer of deeds could have done
          them better. The credit belongs to the man who is actually in the
          arena, whose face in marred by dust and sweat and blood; who strives
          valiantly; who errs, who comes short again and again, because there is
          no effort without error and shortcoming; but who does actually strive
          to do the deeds; who knows great enthusiasms, the great devotions; who
          spends himself in a worthy cause; who at the best knows in the end the
          triumph of high achievement, and who at the worst, if he fails, at
          least fails while daring greatly, so that his place shall never be
          with those cold and timid souls who neither know victory nor
          defeat.&quot;<br>
