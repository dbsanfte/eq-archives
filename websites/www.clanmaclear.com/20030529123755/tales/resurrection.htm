&nbsp; &nbsp; As the moon waned the unnamed members of Clan MacLear began to
gather to Halas again. Gathering fram as far as Faydwer and as close as Everfrost, their
bretheren did come to the Pub and greet each other with the love only a Clan can
appreciate. I cannot tell you all that transpired, as it is the sole knowledge of the
Clan, but I can tell you of the Great Resurrection and the two Gods who did show
themselves for the Clan.
<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Heads were held low as, while the Clan was supposed to celebrate
this night, one of it's sons had met the final death the night before. Gamaeliel, half
elven decendant of Lord Lear, had been swept up by the final death, and was unable to
attend the initial gathering.
<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; MacLear acted quickly, though. Mustering all the power given them
they did walk, in formation of 6 fingers, from Halas to the chill broken temple of
Everfrost. The Clan fought to wipe the frozen tears from their cheeks so as not to lose
faith that Lord Lear would return their kinsman to their embrace. Once arriving at the
temple, they immediately called upon all manner of God and Spirit to return the soul of
MacLear to this shell. Our Shamans and Sages welled up powers and magics beyond imagining
to impress the Gods in hopes they would be swayed. The first volley of spells, while
taking their tole on MacLear's casters lit up the cold sky like day. The Warriors and a
lone Monk bid the Gods come and restore their kinsman, bowing in humility. The second
volley of magics shook the silt below as a God appeared before the Clan in a flash of
brilliance. His light shone so powerfully that the family knelt one one knee each and
prayed in silence; letting only Chief Tormod represent them in speech.
<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &quot;I, Tormod MacLear, Chief heir to Clan MacLear, summon you now
to bid my calling. Gamaeliel, or kinsman, has been taken from us without cause. MacLear
will not stand for this, as we have done nothing to condemn our souls. I ask your hand in
leniance.&quot;
<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The Spirit, clad in green, did speek, &quot;Tormod MacLear, we shine
on you still. We have not taken your kinsman from you... he is simply lost in the Guf. I
will find him and return him to you in one full day.&quot;
<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The Clan rose and cheered on high as the God engulfed in flame and
was gone.
<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; With this done, they still had to return to Halas in reverent
formation-- two by three in lines-- and commit to memory all that had transpired that
night.
<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; On the slow trek back to Halas they met a flying God named
Palladius. He wore black metal and commanded the Clan stop the funeral procession. Not
only had he met with the soul of the fallen lad, he was to bestow Clan MacLear with
&quot;God reognized&quot; Clan status. They would walk Norrath with Clan MacLear's name to
shine with them. Lads and Lasses, Kinsman and Lady alike, washed back their tears and
praised the eve as, one by one, officers were appointed and the family was crested.
<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Never before had one night brought together so many Gods with their
children since the First Awakening and the Spirits walked Norrath. Let it be rung aloud
&quot;Gamaeliel walks with us again as a MacLear!&quot; &quot;For Halas! For
MacLear!&quot;
<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Now, MacLear meetings are truly secret, so gettting a series of
pictures from one of their ceremonies is highly unique. Here we have 8 pics (if I remember
correctly) starting from Procession Formation to the Gathering at the Ruin, to the
Summoning, to The First God, to the Meeting with Palladius to the Officiation of MacLear
(albeit misspelled...;).
