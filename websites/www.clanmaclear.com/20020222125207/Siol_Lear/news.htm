          <b>01-02-02 - Team Sound Tutorial by Ronod </b><a HREF="mailto:joshua@clanmacear.com">Torveig</a>
          <br>
          <br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ronod had the completely brilliant idea to start a Team Sound 
          server so that the Siol Lear could communicate via voice chat.&nbsp; This helps 
          greatly in RvR and is a lot of fun even in PvE.&nbsp; In the <b><a HREF="lore.html">Lore</a></b> 
          section near the bottom of the page, you can link to the Team Sound tutorial and 
          download the program.&nbsp;&nbsp;</font>

          <br>
          <br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There is now a PayPal donate button on the left [ed.] side of this 
          page about halfway down the page.&nbsp; My PayPal identity is &quot;Mac Inc.&quot;
          &nbsp; The clicking the donate button will link you to the PayPal Secure Server 
          and will allow you to set up a monthly donation of $5.&nbsp; If you ever want to 
          stop donating, just go to PayPal and cancel your subscription to the monthly 
          donation billing.&nbsp;</font>
          </p>
          <p>
          <font FACE="ARIAL" SIZE="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I want to note that donating is 
          completely optional.&nbsp; I fully expect that we'll actually have a rush of 
          folks who want to help out.&nbsp; Don't feel bad if you didn't get to contribute.
          &nbsp; If you would like to be put on the waiting list to contribute in case 
          someone stops their monthly donations send me an email at <a HREF="mailto:joshua@clanmaclear.com">joshua@clanmaclear.com</a> 
          and I will add you to the waiting list.&nbsp; If we have a large number of folks 
          on the waiting list then we can simply reduce the amount each person is donating 
          so that more people can feel like they are helping to carry the Clan financially.</font>
          </p>
          <p>
          <font FACE="ARIAL" SIZE="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Clan's hosting costs average 
          around $40 per month.&nbsp; I am going to contribute my share of $5 per month, 
          so we have $35 left to raise.&nbsp; I'll make a listing that shows how much is 
          being donated each month and those who have contributed to the cause.&nbsp; ;-)&nbsp; 
          After you donate send me an email at <a HREF="mailto:joshua@clanmaclear.com">joshua@clanmaclear.com</a> 
          to let me know what Clan member name you want to have recognized for the 
          contribution.</font>

          <br>
          <br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Added the <a TARGET="_blank" HREF="http://www.camelotherald.com/">CamelotHerald.com</a> 
          link above on this page.&nbsp; Added links to Siol Lear realm points on <a TARGET="_blank" HREF="http://www.camelotherald.com/">CamelotHerald.com</a> 
          and realm frontier keeps status.&nbsp; Note: the keep status page also shows the 
          top 20 guilds by realm points for the entire server.&nbsp;&nbsp; Also removed 
          the advertising banners at the tops of all the pages.&nbsp; Although there was 
          general support for it on the message board, when the advertising was added I 
          got some complaints.&nbsp; So, &quot;its&nbsp;no big deal&quot; as Bill Murray 
          put it on Caddy Shack.&nbsp; ;-)&nbsp; I'll add a donate button instead.&nbsp; I 
          request that you do not donate more than $5 per person per month.&nbsp; That way 
          we can all share the cost of hosting instead of one us &quot;owning&quot; the 
          site.</font>

          [Uliam]</a><br>
          <br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Laird Tormod was able to send me fresh copies of many of the 
          original MacLear tales for the EQ section. Of course, this fixed the links on 
          the Siol Lear tales page as well.<br>

          <b>11-29-01 - Lore Updates (maps and other info) </b><a HREF="mailto:joshua@clanmacear.com">Torveig</a>
          <br>
          <br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Added links to maps to all frontiers areas in Midgard, 
          Hibernia and Albion.&nbsp; All map links are marked with an &quot;S&quot; if 
          they lead to information about monster spawns and could be considered spoilers.&nbsp; 
          They are marked with &quot;SF&quot; if they are Spoil Free.&nbsp; Also added 
          links to daoc.catacombs.com (excellent class specialization information) and to 
          camelot.allakhazam.com which has a great item database.&nbsp; I also saved 
          copies of all the maps on our site in case the sites that currently host them go 
          belly up in the future.</font>

          [Uliam]</a><br>
          <br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Changed the logo that covers the top of every page just a bit, 
          in accordance with the Laird and his lady.<br>
          <br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Modified the Roster as requested, both times. We are looking 
          at giving each player their own page so we don't have to fill one huge page with 
          all that information. One potential problem, though, is that some character 
          pages would be huge and I'm sure others would be virtually empty. I like a level 
          of uniformity, but we'll see.<br>
          <br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I added large sections to the <a HREF="file://C:/Documents%20and%20Settings/Joshua/Local%20Settings/Temporary%20Internet%20Files/Content.IE5/41IB45I3/gael.htm">
          <b>Gaelic Language</b></a> , <a HREF="file://C:/Documents%20and%20Settings/Joshua/Local%20Settings/Temporary%20Internet%20Files/Content.IE5/41IB45I3/gaelic_history.htm">
          <b>History</b></a> and now a <a HREF="file://C:/Documents%20and%20Settings/Joshua/Local%20Settings/Temporary%20Internet%20Files/Content.IE5/41IB45I3/celt.htm">
          <b>Celtic History</b></a> page. Yes, I know it's confusing, but the fact of the 
          matter is that it <b>is</b> going to be confusing.<br>

          <b>Lore</b></a> section. In fact, I'll probably put some more info there. Unlike 
          the Tome in our EQ section, I don't plan on making the most definitive source of 
          info. There are already a hundred sites out there with better information-- no 
          reason to re-invent the wheel.<br>

          <br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Our sister in Norrath, Lanadena, deserves great credit for 
          bringing forth the <a TARGET="_blank" HREF="http://www.calsnet.net/cmacdaoccal"><b>Calendar</b></a>. 
          I have set it up, but haven't tested it yet, so beware. If it happens to work, 
          please use the heck out of it. I would use a static version of it on our end, 
          but I don't claim to have the time to keep it fresh, so I'll cheat and use 
          someone else's.<br>

          <br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Loden made an excellent page for our language. I fidgeted 
          with the formatting a bit and added two more pages accessible from the <a HREF="file://C:/Documents%20and%20Settings/Joshua/Local%20Settings/Temporary%20Internet%20Files/Content.IE5/41IB45I3/gael.htm">

          <br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We've pretty much finished the first version of the site. 
          Torveig was gracious enough to upload the <a HREF="file://C:/Documents%20and%20Settings/Joshua/Local%20Settings/Temporary%20Internet%20Files/Content.IE5/41IB45I3/frmjoin.htm">
          <b>Join</b></a> form and make it look all pretty. Today, I basically fixed the 
          formatting on all the pages so they would be precisely the same, as well as 
          updated the roster many times over.<br>
          <br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Note: Alt-Tabbing out in PvP is a current exploit being 
          resolved by Mythic. Apparently, it allows cheaters and cowards to avoid PvP 
          death. This explains all the corpses in RvR that stand up (they aren't dead). 
          Not that I need to say it, but just for measure, any Siol found doing this will 
          be immediately deguilded-- I kid you not.<br>

          [Uliam]</a><br>
          <br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I'm revising this all in the few short minutes before our 
          first official meeting as Siol Lear. Fortunately, FP 2000 allows me to make and 
          modify using HTML so I don't have to fidget with the editor. The pages will all 
          be changing a bit, but for now this will do. Also, expect the News section here 
          to be updated. **update** Yes, I know one of the images on the front doesn't 
          work. I have the pic elsewhere right now, but should function fine tomorrow. I 
          have given up on using CSS (gotta make those links pretty) but we may reactivate 
          it all later if we want. I have not yet tested the site in Netscape (it probably 
          won't look right).<br>
          <br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We had our first official gathering today ! We discussed many 
          issues such as guild colors (5s brown armor) and an eventual 10% tithe of all 
          hunting money. As well, we honored those who gave to the 300g &quot;Emblem Fund,&quot; 
          promoted Orden to Black Watch, promoted several other members to Kin or High 
          Council as appropriate. In addition, many plans have been laid for the future. <i>/em 
          raises a hdn in salute</i>.<br>

          [Uliam]</a><br>
          <br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; By the time you see this site, there will be another update. 
          The only people seeing this update as &quot;new&quot; are Loden and myself. I'm 
          making each of the pages out now, and waiting for Loden to decide (a) if we're 
          even redoing the site and (b) what sort of color and tone we are setting. Yes, 
          the site looks better in IE than Netscape. That's because AOL owns Netscape and 
          AOL is inferior to M$. =) Specifically, the links hover and the text is slightly 
          different in IE.
