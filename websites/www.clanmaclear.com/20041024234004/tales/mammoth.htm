<p>After a long hard day of buffing my rusty bastard sword on the hides of the
arrogant Gnolls, I asked Friend and Clansman Tabot the Shaman to join me for a
little sip of the good stuff at Fire Ciders. A brief and discouraging stop at
the bank revealed that both of us were down to our last few gold pieces, meaning
that our evening would be spent indulging in Rot-Gut again, rather than the
&quot;good stuff&quot;... much to my smaller intestine's dismay.</p>
<p>I was able to purchase 6 short beers and Tabot 4. The big question that came
to mind was where would be the most appropriate place to make arses out of
ourselves. We determined that anywhere outside of Halas would be a waste of
foolishness and drinking around the reputable stores would get us ejected from
our favorite haunts again. And so the decision to consume our consumables in the
boat outside of Old Smokies fish house was made... The last stop before crossing
into Everfrost Peaks.</p>

<p>Drinking in a boat gives me a wonderful sense of kinship, bringing to memory
the days in which, as a young berzerker, my Grand Pappy would drag me slowly
through the water to attract a Sperm Whale. I can remember how I would splash
joyfully behind the boat, dipping and bobbing dizzily with anticipation of the
first bite on our lines. I have many pleasant scars --- 'ER --- memories of
those days.</p>
<p>Actually, the vomiting after a good bout of drinking is what reminds me most
of those days, as too much saltwater would often make me violently ill.</p>
<p>The first short beer was just as I remember it to be, bitter as a Barbarian
Woman and as intoxicating as a freshly clubbed baby seal. I wont go into the
details of the whole drinking process, as you readers are well aware of how it
goes, but to my surprise I slid straight out of the boat in into a pile of Fish
Entrails that Old Smoky left out for his sled dogs. Which incidentally have been
missing ever since that pack of Polar Bears made a quick snack of them.</p>
<p>I was quite put off by the cold, rank smell of barely edible guts. I finished
with haste my last two beers and went straight off (a wobbly kind of
&quot;straight&quot; one can only perfect through the mass consumption of Rot
Gut) to have a talk with Old Smokey about the location of his Dog Team, and to
re-explore the theory that they weren't coming back, and how the piles of Fish
Entrails tends to draw the attention of more Sled Dog Eating Polar Bears.</p>
<p>Old Smoky wasn't at as amused by my rantings as Clansman Tabot was, so after
barfing on the produce, we went off for a nice swim across Lake Halas and passed
on into Everfrost Peaks. The plan was to teach the Skelli-Bones how to get in a
good workout and put a little meat on their bones. As it happens, Skelli-Bones
go for a considerable amount of money, which naturally affords me more beer.</p>
<p>During a nice workout like Skelli-Swatting, I like to let my mind wander and
I think about the day’s events. People have said to me that when I am in this
trance-like state I tend to look at my feet allot, and they must be right,
because swatting Skelli's got me to thinking about how crusty my shoes were.
Now, anyone who has been around knows that the most destructive element in the
Barbarians lands is not the wind, nor the cold, nor even the Rot Gut, but are
those semi-warm piles O' Mastodon poop which litters the Badlands. The acid
content (as I am told by my elders) is so great that one could put a tarnished
copper piece into a warm pile of Mammoth Poop and in a day or so, crack the
dried pile apart and find a clean, shiny coin!</p>
<p>After repeated requests to the Mastodon Herd Leaders to put an end to the
indiscriminate dropping of Poop (for which I attribute the loss of over seven
pairs of padded shoes), and after repeatedly being ignored, I felt that
something had to be done. But how? I am just a simple man with no true political
aspirations, so calling for a boycott of Mammoth Tusks was out of the question.
My mind spun dizzily.</p>
<p>Finally it came to me in a vision... I would get someone to kick some Mammoth
Butt! And I knew just who to get to do it.</p>
<p>&quot;Tabot!&quot; I called to my friend who was busy crushing Skelli-Bones
with his old rusty mace that I had pried from the cold dead paw of a Gnoll
Guard. &quot;Let’s go see Snowflake.&quot;</p>
<p>The trip to visit Snowflake the White Wolf-Husky really seemed to fly, the
canyon wall zoomed blurredly past as the peak of my beer buzz kicked in. &quot;Tabot,&quot;
I whispered. &quot;Say 'Snowflake, find Megan'&quot;. He did. Snowflake gave a
&quot;woof, woof&quot; and bound merrily out into the Badlands. I had taken this
trip before, but never with a buzz or a companion.</p>
<p>Snowflake trotted off to the East, hot on the trail of Megan, the Girl of
Arnis (Protector of the way to Black Burrow). Passing by a few Ice Goblins,
Tabot and I decided to let Snowflake continue while we avenged ourselves upon
these, our antagonists from our younger days. The 3 cowards fled under the blows
of our alcohol strengthened weapon arms, and we swiftly ended their pitifully
useless lives as is often sung of in the tales of our fathers.</p>
<p>We gathered our bearings and sprinted off in the direction Snowflake had
taken. Snowflake had been doing a little avenging of his own, for we saw a large
spider corpse along the route, and could see some commotion going on up ahead.</p>
<p>As we crested the hill we came to the realization of what was happening…
Snowflake was attacking! My sweet vengeance upon those poop pile pacifists was
taking place without my being there! Rushing headlong into the fray I saw that
the full sized mammoth bull was hurting pretty badly and trying to escape.
Finally, my chance to extract some pride from the whole messy situation. I slid
my well-practiced rusty bastard sword into my pack and placed my shield onto my
back and drew forth the Eliminator… My seldom used, seldom practiced, seldom
seen, two-handed blade of Justice!</p>
<p>To my right I could see a grin of almost evil intent on the face of Tabot.
Surely he was already planning an ivory pipe or two to be created from the
large, battle damaged tusks mounted on the business end of our pal, Mr. Mammoth.
He steadied his Mace, his fingers locking around its aging handle.</p>
<p>My eyes rolled into the back of their sockets as my mouth began to foam.
Bodily orifices tightened in anticipation of the battle and my legs prepared for
the pounce… RED! My vision exploded with the fireworks of bloodlust as I
sprung forth, my valiant friend and clansman Tabot at my side. Ohhhh.. It
isn’t a pretty sight when Tabot berzerks… You think Mammoths make large
piles? You ain’t seen anything yet!</p>
<p>The Attack! I drove powerfully forward, striking open a large gash in the
rear flank of our foe while its attention was diverted by the relentless
gnashing of Snowflakes Teeth. Tabot swung left, striking powerfully at the knee
joints of the foul smelling beast. The creature reared in up in pain, or perhaps
surprise of our stupidity.</p>
<p>I looked in its eyes as I drove forward for the killing blow and saw not
fear, or grim acceptance of its fate, but pity… Pity for the poor fools it
would now have to trample beneath its immense feet.</p>
<p>It swung around, goring me with its right tusk, throwing me high into the
air. My already cooling corpse must have shocked Tabot into action, for I saw
him turn to flee just before I blacked out for the finally trip to Valhalla,
where I would naturally be the laughing stock. My final thought… &quot;Alcohol
and Mammoths don’t mix.&quot;</p>
<p>Damnit! What a waste of a perfectly good buzz...</p>
