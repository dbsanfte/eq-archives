<p align="left"><font size="4"><em><strong>The story of the birth of Fin MacCumhail and
the founding of the Fenians is as true as the day is long and the grass is green in Erin.
I have it on good authority from unimpeachable sources among the wee-folk. Additional
credit must be given to Jeremiah Curtin, Susan Kirk, George Bain and a host of Celtic
common folk throughout the world for maintaining the oral and visual artistic traditions.</strong></em></font>
</p>

<p align="left"><em><strong><font size="5">C</font>umhal Macart was a great champion in
the west of Erin, and it was prophesied of him that if ever he married he would meet death
in the next battle he fought. For this reason he had no wife, and knew no woman for a long
time; till one day he saw the king&#146;s daughter, who was so beautiful that he forgot
all fear and married her in secret. Next day after the marriage, news came that a battle
had to be fought.</strong></em></p>

<p align="left"><em><strong>Now a Druid had told the king that his daughter&#146;s son
would take the kingdom from him; so he made up his mind to look after the daughter, and
not let any man come near her. Before he went to the battle, Cumhal told his mother
everything,-- told her of his relations with the king&#146;s daughter. He said, &quot; I
shall be killed in battle today, according to the prophecy of the Druid, and I&#146;m
afraid if his daughter has a son the king will kill the child, for the prophecy is that he
will lose the kingdom by the son of his own daughter. Now, if the king&#146;s daughter has
a son you must hide and rear him, if you can; you will be his only hope and stay.&quot;</strong></em></p>

<p align="left"><em><strong>Cumhal was killed in the battle, and within that year the
king&#146;s daughter had a son. By command of his grandfather, the boy was thrown out of
the castle window into a loch, to be drowned, on the day of his birth. The boy sank from
sight; but after remaining a while under the water, he rose again to the surface, and came
to land holding a live salmon in his hand.</strong></em></p>

<p align="left"><em><strong>The grandmother of the boy, Cumhal&#146;s mother, stood
watching on the shore, and said to herself as she saw this: &quot;He is my grandson, the
true son of my own child,&quot; and seizing the boy, she rushed away with him, and
vanished, before the king&#146;s people could stop her.</strong></em></p>

<p align="left"><em><strong>When the king heard that the old woman had escaped with his
daughter&#146;s son, he fell into a terrible rage, and ordered all the male children born
that day in the kingdom to be put to death, hoping in this way to kill his own grandson,
and save the crown for himself. </strong></em></p>

<p align="left"><em><strong>After she had disappeared from the bank of the loch, the old
woman, Cumhal&#146;s mother, made her way to a thick forest, where she spent that night as
best she could. Next day she came to a great oak tree. Then she hired a man to cut out a
chamber in the tree.</strong></em></p>

<p align="left"><em><strong>When all was finished, and there was a nice room in the oak
for herself and her grandson, and a whelp of the same age as the boy, and which she had
brought with her from the castle. She said to the man: &quot;Give me the ax which you have
in your hand, there is something here that I want to fix.&quot; The man gave the ax into
her hand, and that minute she swept the head off him, saying: &quot;You&#146;ll never tell
any man about this place now.&quot;</strong></em></p>

<p align="left"><em><strong>One day the whelp ate some of the fine chipping left cut by
the carpenter from the inside of the tree. The old woman said: &quot;You&#146;ll be called
Bran from this out.&quot; All three lived in the tree together, and the old woman did not
take her grandson out till the end of five years; and then he couldn't walk, he had been
sitting so long inside. When the old grandmother had taught the boy to walk, she brought
him one day to the brow of a hill from which there was a long slope. She took a switch and
said: &quot;Now, run down this place. I will follow and strike you with this switch, and
coming up I will run ahead, and you strike me as often as you can.&quot;</strong></em></p>

<p align="left"><em><strong>The first time they ran down, his grandmother struck him many
times. In coming up the first time, he did not strike her at all. Every time they ran down
she struck him less, and every time they ran up he struck her more. They ran up and down
for three days; and at the end of that time she could not strike him once, and he struck
her at every step she took. He had now become a great runner.</strong></em></p>

<p align="left"><em><strong><font size="5">W</font>hen he was fifteen years of age, the
old woman went with him to a hurling match between the forces of his grandfather and those
of a neighboring king. Both sides were equal in skill; and neither was able to win, till
the youth opposed his grandfather&#146;s people. Then, he won every game. When the ball
was thrown in the air, he struck it coming down, and so again and again, never letting the
ball touch the ground till he had driven it through the barrier.</strong></em></p>

<p align="left"><em><strong>The old king, who was very angry and greatly mortified at the
defeat of his people, exclaimed, as he saw the youth who was very fair and had white hair:
&quot;Who is that fin cumhal {white cap}?&quot; The punning resemblance suggested the
proper name for the boy: &quot; Ah, that is it; Fin will be his name, and Fin MacCumhail
he is,&quot; said the old woman. The king ordered his people to seize and put the young
man to death, on the spot.</strong></em></p>

<p align="left"><em><strong>The old woman hurried to the side of her grandson. They
slipped from the crowd and away they went, a hill at a leap, a glen at a step, and
thirty-two miles at a running-leap. They ran a long distance, till Fin grew tired; then
the old grandmother took him on her back, putting his feet into two pockets which were in
her dress, one on each side, and ran on with the same swiftness as before, a hill at a
leap, a glen at a step, and thirty-two miles at a running-leap.</strong></em></p>

<p align="left"><em><strong>After a time the old woman felt the approach of pursuit, and
said to Fin: &quot;Look behind, and tell me what you see.&quot; &quot;I see,&quot; said
he, &quot; a white horse with a champion on his back.&quot; &quot;Oh, no fear,&quot; said
she; &quot;a white horse has no endurance; he can never catch us, we are safe from
him.&quot; And on they sped. A second time she felt the approach of pursuit, and again she
said: &quot;Look back, and see who is coming.&quot; &quot;I see, a warrior riding on a
brown horse.&quot; &quot;Never fear,&quot; said the old woman; &quot;There is never a
brown horse but is giddy, he cannot overtake us.&quot; She rushed on as before. A third
time she said: &quot;Look around and see who is coming now.&quot; Fin looked and said:
&quot; I see a black warrior on a black horse, following fast.&quot; &quot;There is no
horse so tough as a black horse,&quot; said the grandmother. &quot;There is no escape from
this one. My grandson, one or both of us must die. I am old, my time has nearly come. I
will die and you and Bran save yourselves. (Bran had been with them all the time.) right
here ahead is a deep bog; you jump off my back, and escape as best you can. I&#146;ll jump
into the bog up to my neck: and when the king&#146;s men come, I&#146;ll say that you are
in the bog before me, sunk out of sight, and I&#146;m trying to find you. As my hair and
yours are the same color, they will cut it off, and take it in place of yours, and show it
to the king; that will satisfy his anger.&quot;</strong></em></p>

<p align="left"><em><strong>Fin slipped down, took farewell of his grandmother, and
hurried on with Bran. The old woman came to the bog, jumped in, and sank to her neck. The
king&#146;s men were soon at the edge of the bog, and the black rider called out to the
old woman: &quot;Where is Fin?&quot; &quot;He is here in the bog before me, and I&#146;m
trying can I find him&quot; lamented the old woman. As the horse man could not find Fin,
and thought the old woman&#146;s head would do to carry back, they cut it off, and took it
with them, saying: &quot;This will satisfy the king.&quot; </strong></em></p>

<p align="left"><em><strong>Fin and Bran went on till they came to a great cave, in which
they found a herd of goats. At the further end of the cave was a smoldering fire. The two
lay down to rest. A couple of hours later, in came a giant with a salmon in his hand. This
giant was of awful height, he had but one eye, and that in the middle of his forehead, as
large as the sun in heaven. When he saw Fin, he called out: &quot;Here, take this salmon
and roast it: but be careful, for if you raise a single blister on it I&#146;ll cut the
head off you. I&#146;ve followed this salmon for three days and three nights without
stopping, and I never let it out of my sight, for it is the most wonderful salmon in the
world.&quot;</strong></em></p>

<p align="left"><em><strong>The giant lay down to sleep in the middle of the cave. Fin
spitted the salmon, and held it over the fire. The minute the giant closed the one eye in
his head, he began to snore. Every time he drew breath into his body, he dragged Fin, the
spit, the salmon, Bran, and all the goats to his mouth; and every time he drove a breath
out of himself, he threw them back to the places they were in before. Fin was drawn time
after time to the mouth of the giant with such force, that he was in dread of going down
his throat.</strong></em></p>

<p align="left"><em><strong>When partly cooked, a blister rose on the salmon, Fin pressed
the place with his thumb, to know could he bread the blister, and hide from the giant the
harm that was done. But he burned his thumb, and , to ease the pain, put it between his
teeth, and gnawed the skin to the flesh, the flesh to the bone, the bone to the marrow;
and having tasted the marrow, he received the knowledge of all things. Next moment, he was
drawn by the breath of the giant right up to his face, and knowing from his thumb what to
do, he plunged the hot spit into the sleeping eye of the giant and destroyed it. That
instant the giant with a single bound was at the low entrance of the cave, and , standing
with his back to the wall and a foot on each side of the opening, roared out: &quot;
You&#146;ll not leave this place alive.&quot;</strong></em></p>

<p align="left"><em><strong><font size="5">N</font>ow Fin killed the largest goat, skinned
him as quickly as he could, then putting the skin on himself he drove the herd to where
the giant stood; the goats passed out one by one between his legs. When the great goat
came the giant took him by the horns. Fin slipped from the skin, and ran out. &quot;Oh,
you&#146;ve escaped,&quot; said the giant, &quot; but before we part let me make you a
present.&quot;</strong></em></p>

<p align="left"><em><strong>&quot;I&#146;m afraid to go near you,&quot; said Fin; &quot;if
you wish to give me a present, put it out this way, and then go back.&quot; The giant
placed a ring on the ground, then went back. Fin took up the ring and put it on the end of
his little finger above the first joint. It clung so firmly that no man in the world could
have taken it off. The giant then called out, &quot; Where are you?&quot; &quot;On
Fin&#146;s finger,&quot; cried the ring. That instant the giant spring at Fin and almost
came down on his head, thinking in this way to crush him to bits. Fin sprang to a
distance. Again the giant asked, &quot;Where are you?&quot; &quot;On Fin&#146;s
finger,&quot; answered the ring. Again the giant made a leap, coming down just in front of
Fin. Many times he called and many times almost caught Fin, who could not escape with the
ring on his finger. While in this terrible struggle, not knowing how to escape, Bran ran
up and asked: &quot;Why don&#146;t you chew your thumb?&quot;</strong></em></p>

<p align="left"><em><strong>Fin bit his thumb to the marrow, and then knew what to do. He
took the knife with which he had skinned the goat, cut off his finger at the first joint,
and threw it, with the ring still on, into a deep bog nearby. And again the giant called
out, &quot;Where are you?&quot; and the ring answered, &quot; On Fin&#146;s finger.&quot;
Straightway the giant sprang towards the voice, sank to his shoulders in the bog, and
stayed there.</strong></em></p>

<p align="left"><em><strong>Fin with Bran now went on his way, and traveled till he
reached a deep and thick wood, where a thousand horses were drawing timber, and men
felling and preparing it. &quot;What is this?&quot; asked Fin of the overseer of the
workmen. &quot;Oh, we are building a dun for the king; we build one every day, and every
night it is burned to the ground. Our king has an only daughter; he will give her to any
man who will save the dun, and he&#146;ll leave him the kingdom at his death. If any man
undertakes to save the dun and fails, his life must pay for it; the king will cut his head
off. The best champions in Erin have tried and failed; they are now in the king&#146;s
dungeons, a whole army of them, waiting the king&#146;s pleasure. He&#146;s going to cut
the heads off them all in one day.&quot; Why don&#146;t you chew your thumb?&quot; asked
Bran.</strong></em></p>

<p align="left"><em><strong>Fin chewed his thumb to the marrow, and then knew that on the
eastern side of the world there lived an old hag with her three sons, and every evening at
nightfall she sent the youngest of these to burn the king&#146;s dun. &quot;I will save
the king&#146;s dun,&quot; said Fin. &quot;Well,&quot; said the overseer, &quot;better men
than you have tried and lost their lives.&quot; &quot;Oh,&quot; says Fin, &quot;I&#146;m
not afraid; I&#146;ll try for the sake of the king&#146;s daughter.&quot;</strong></em></p>

<p align="left"><em><strong>Now Fin, followed by Bran, went with the overseer to the king.
&quot;I hear you will give your daughter to the man who saves your dun,&quot; said Fin.
&quot;I will,&quot; said the king; &quot;but if he fails I must have his head.&quot;
&quot;Well,&quot; says Fin, &quot;I&#146;ll risk my head for the sake of your daughter. If
I fail I&#146;m satisfied.&quot; The king gave Fin food and drink; he supped, and after
supper went to the dun. &quot;Why don&#146;t you chew your thumb?&quot; said Bran;
&quot;then you&#146;ll know what to do.&quot; He did. Then Bran took her place on the
roof, waiting for the old woman&#146;s son.</strong></em></p>

<p align="left"><em><strong>Now the old woman in the east told her youngest son to hurry
on with his torches, burn the dun, and come back without delay; for the stirabout was
boiling and he must not be too late for supper. So he took the torches, and shot off
through the air with a wonderful speed. Soon he was in sight of the king&#146;s dun, threw
the torches upon the thatched roof to set it on fire as usual.</strong></em></p>

<p align="left"><em><strong>That moment Bran gave the torches such a push with her
shoulders, that they fell into the stream which ran around the dun, and were put out.
&quot;Who is this,&quot; cried the youngest son of the old hag, &quot;who has dared to put
out my lights, and interfere with my hereditary right?&quot; &quot;I,&quot; said Fin, who
stood in front of him. Then began a terrible battle between Fin and the old woman&#146;s
son. Bran came down from the dun to help Fin; she bit and tore his enemy&#146;s back,
striping the skin and flesh from his head to his heels. After a terrible struggle such as
had not been in the world before that night, Fin cut the head off his enemy. But for Bran,
Fin could never have conquered.</strong></em></p>

<p align="left"><em><strong><font size="5">T</font>he time for the return of her son had
passed; supper was ready. The old woman, impatient and angry, said, to the second son:
&quot;You take torches and hurry on, see why your brother loiters. I&#146;ll pay him for
this when he come home! But be careful and don&#146;t do like him, or you&#146;ll have
your pay too. Hurry back, for the stirabout is boiling and ready for supper.&quot; He
started off, was met and killed exactly as his brother, except that he was stronger and
the battle fiercer. But for Bran, Fin would have lost his life that night.</strong></em></p>

<p align="left"><em><strong>The old woman was raging at the delay, and said to her eldest
son, who had not been out of the house for years: ( It was only in case of the greatest
need that she sent him. He had a cat&#146;s head, and was called Pus an Chuine, &quot;Puss
of the Corner;&quot; he was the eldest and strongest of all the brothers.) &quot;Now take
torches, go and see what delays your brothers; I&#146;ll pay them for this when they come
home.&quot;</strong></em></p>

<p align="left"><em><strong>The eldest brother shot off through the air, came to the
king&#146;s dun and threw his torches upon the roof. They had just singed the straw a
little, when Bran pushed them off with such force that they fell into the stream and were
quenched. &quot;Who is this,&quot; screamed Cat-head, &quot;who dares to interfere with my
ancestral right?&quot; &quot;I,&quot; shouted Fin. Then the struggle began fiercer than
with the second brother. Bran helped from behind, tearing the flesh from his head to his
heels; but at length Cat-head fastened his teeth into Fin&#146;s breast, biting and
gnawing till Fin cut the head off. The body fell to the ground, but the head lived,
gnawing as terribly as before. Do what they could it was impossible to kill it. Fin hacked
and cut, but could neither kill nor pull it off. When nearly exhausted, Bran said;
&quot;Why don&#146;t you chew your thumb?&quot; Fin chewed thumb, and reaching the marrow
knew that the old woman in the east was ready to start with torches to find her sons, and
burn the dun herself, and that she had a vial of liquid with which she could bring the
sons to life; and that nothing could free him from Cat-head but the old woman&#146;s
blood.</strong></em></p>

<p align="left"><em><strong>After midnight the old hag, enraged at the delay of her sons,
started and shot through the air like lightning, more swiftly than her sons. She threw her
torches from afar upon the roof of the dun; but Bran as before hurled them into the
stream. Now the old woman circled around in the air looking for her sons. Fin was getting
very weak from pain and loss of blood, for Cat-head was biting at his breast all the time.
Bran called out; &quot;Rouse yourself, oh Fin; use all your power or we are lost! If the
old hag gets a drop from the vial upon the bodies of her sons, they will come to life, and
then we&#146;re done for.&quot;</strong></em></p>

<p align="left"><em><strong>Thus roused, Fin with one spring reached the old woman in the
air, and swept the bottle from her grasp; which falling upon the ground was emptied., The
old hag gave a scream which was heard all over the world, came to the ground and closed
with Fin. Then followed a battle greater than the world had ever known before that night,
or has ever seen since. Water sprang out of gray rocks, and cows cast their calves even
when they had none, and hard rushes grew soft in the remotest corner or Erin, so desperate
was the fighting and so awful, between Fin and the old hag. Fin would have died that night
but for Bran.</strong></em></p>

<p align="left"><em><strong>Just as daylight was coming Fin swept the head off the old
woman, caught some of her blood, and rubbed it around Cat-head, who fell off dead. He
rubbed his own wounds with the blood and was cured; then rubbed some on Bran, who had been
singed with the torches, and she was as well as ever. Fin, exhausted with fighting,
dropped down and fell asleep.</strong></em></p>

<p align="left"><em><strong>While he was sleeping the chief steward of the king came to
the dun, found it standing safe and sound, and seeing Fin lying there asleep knew that he
had saved it. Bran tried to waken Fin, pulled and tugged, but could not rouse him. The
steward went to the king, and said: &quot;I have saved the dun, and I claim the
reward.&quot; &quot;It shall be given you,&quot; answered the king; and straightway the
steward was recognized as the king&#146;s son-in-law, and orders were given to make ready
for the wedding.</strong></em></p>

<p align="left"><em><strong>Bran had listened to what was going on, and when her master
woke, exactly at midday, she told him of all that was taking place in the castle of the
king. Fin went to the king, and said: &quot;I have saved your dun, and I claim the
reward.&quot; &quot;Oh,&quot; said the king, &quot;my steward claimed the reward, and it
has been given to him.&quot; &quot;He had nothing to do with saving the dun; I saved
it,&quot; said Fin. &quot;Well,&quot; answered the king, &quot;he is the first man who
told me of its safety and claimed the reward.&quot; &quot;Bring him here: let me look at
him,&quot; said Fin.</strong></em></p>

<p align="left"><em><strong>He was sent for, and came. &quot;Did you save the king&#146;s
dun?&quot; asked Fin. &quot;I did,&quot; said the steward. You did not, and striking him
with the edge of his open hand he swept the head off his body, dashing it against the
other side of the room, flattening it like paste on the wall. &quot;You are the man,&quot;
said the king to Fin, &quot;who saved the dun; yours is the reward. All the champions, and
there is many a man of them, who have failed to save it are in the dungeons of my
fortress; their heads must be cut off before the wedding takes place.&quot; Will you let
me see them?&quot; asked Fin. &quot;I will,&quot; said the king.</strong></em></p>

<p align="left"><em><strong>Fin went down to the men, and found the first champions of
Erin in the dungeons, &quot;Will you obey me in all things if I save you from death?&quot;
said Fin. &quot; We will,&quot; said they. Then he went back to the king and asked:
&quot;Will you give me the lives of these champions of Erin, in place of your
daughter&#146;s hand?&quot; &quot;I will,&quot; said the king. All the champions were
liberated, and left the king&#146;s castle that day. Ever after they followed the orders
of Fin, and these were the beginning of his forces and the first of the Fenians of Erin.</strong></em></p>
