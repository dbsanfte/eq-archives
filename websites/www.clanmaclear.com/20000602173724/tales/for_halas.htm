<p align="center"><font size="3"><b>The Origin of the Battle Cry of the Clan
MacLear.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</b></font></p>
<p><font size="4">In the ages of legend long ago that the gods called Beta, Clan
MacLear existed. In those days, the gods did not recognize guilds or clans. Each
individual was on his own to survive or not as they might. But the Clan MacLear
stood together. It had existed even before the land of Norrath. Lord Lear had
established the Clan in the years long gone by to defend the weak and to uphold
righteousness. In those days there were no maps of the great zones of Norrath
and he that had leather armor considered himself fortunate. Even that thing we
take for granted today, the lightstone was nearly unknown and had more value
than most had accumulated in a lifetime. To go as far as Highpass was to risk
total loss as the Orcs ruled there and would destroy any they captured. Is not
the story of how Tormod was the first of the Barbarians to reach the Eastern
Sea, now known as the Ocean of Tears recorded here in these tales?</font></p>
<p><font size="4">In the beginning of the days of legend in the ancient ages of
Beta, the gnolls ruled supreme in Blackburrow and ventured out at will into the
Hills of Queynos and into the valleys and plains of Everfrost with none to
oppose them. Many were the Barbarians, Humans and Half Elves that died at their
hands in those days. As MacLear became stronger Tormod led them into the home of
the gnolls to take revenge and cause them to cease their raids on the new
citizens of Norrath. But that is another story for another time.</font></p>
<p><font size="4">In each age of Beta, the Clan would begin again with only dim
memories of what had gone before. In each of the ages MacLear subdued the gnolls
of Blackburrow until an enmity had arisen between them unlike any in Norrath. In
the fourth age of Beta the gods did speak to Tormod and warn him that there were
those among the gods who would destroy Halas but they would not show their hands
directly. They rather would open the secret deep gates of Blackburrow, and loose
the great gnolls upon Everfrost with a madness upon them that would make them
come to Halas and destroy it.</font></p>
<p><font size="4">More, the gods revealed to Tormod that the end of the age was
at hand and those cities that survived until the end of the forth age of Beta
would indeed survive into the new age that was to come upon Norrath in the days
to come. In that age all who paid the price would be born again, some with the
same identity some with another, but if Halas did not survive into the next age,
there would be no Halas. In those days there was no guildspeak and there was
much to do to assemble all those who valued Halas. The word went out from Tormod
to the zones west of Highpass to assemble in Halas to defend the ancient home of
the MacLears. Over the days that followed those loyal to Halas and to MacLear
began to assemble.</font></p>
<p><font size="4">When the fatal night came a great host of the faithful and
brave had assembled in Halas and marched with Tormod out to the caves where the
guards of Halas stood. Even the bravest felt fear knowing that the end of time
was upon them and their very existence was in doubt. Tormod posted scouts on the
routes from Blackburrow and soon heard of survivors streaming out of the
dungeon. They told tales of great gnolls as large and as powerful as hill giants
and named gnolls with much strength and cunning attacking all barbarians in the
Burrow proclaiming the arrival of the kingdom of the gnolls. Soon the scouts
reported named and powerful <a href="../images/Knollwar/From%20the%20Tunnels.jpg"> gnolls</a> pouring out of
<a href="../images/Knollwar/Kraddiqq%20emerges.jpg"> Blackburrow</a> and up the valley
toward three igloos, the shortest route to Halas. The <a href="../images/Knollwar/The%20Attack.jpg"> assault</a> on Halas had
begun.</font></p>
<p><font size="4">With a cry for blessing from the Tribunal, Tormod led the
assembled barbarians and those who had been adopted by the Clan to the battle.
Amongst us on that day were: Agonisty, Daran (the Flea), Ikar, Shatara, Wolfdor,
Gamaeliel, Nosferum, Xoam, Axelrod, Tokahn, Rhuarc, Olaf and many others who no
longer run through the valleys of Everfrost. The assembled Clan rushed into the
valley of the three igloos and met the advancing army of gnolls head on.&nbsp;
To say a great battle ensued would not be sufficient to describe the melee that
followed. The casting of spells, the swinging of axe and sword, the clashing of
steel on steel and the shrieks of battlecry filled the valley. The Clan held
against the onslaught but many fell and the corpses were thick enough on that
day that one could walk across the valley upon them without touching the ground.
It is believed that Tormod struck the <a href="../images/Knollwar/Kraddiqq%20Falters.jpg"> killing blow</a> that felled the leader of the
gnoll army, Furris the vile, but the Burrow King escaped back to Blackburrow
swearing to return and destroy Halas and MacLear. Even as the Burrow King fled
the field he summoned one to save him from certain destruction at the swords of
MacLear.</font></p>
<p><font size="4">Into the valley came striding <a href="../images/Knollwar/gnolll.jpg">a
giant gnoll.</a> Indeed, he was the size of a hill giant, and struck fear into
the heart of even the bravest barbarian. In the stunned silence that accompanied
the entrance of the giant gnoll, Tormod shouted what was to become the eternal
cry of the MacLears: &quot;For Halas! For MacLear!&quot; and fearlessly charged
the enemy. The valley rang with the shouts of the MacLears and those that had
allied themselves to the Clan. The small surviving band of barbarians swept
forward and attacked the gnoll. As they slammed into the vile creature, they
discovered to their dismay that all they could reach was his feet. At the same
time the gnoll was swinging a great sword the size of a ship's mast! Soon great
warriors were falling like wheat before the scythe!</font></p>
<p><font size="4">It was then that those of the lesser races and other classes
proved their worth. The rangers began furiously firing their arrows at the heads
of the monster while the wizards, shamans and druids began to <a href="../images/Knollwar/gnoll2.jpg">fire
their spells</a>, distracting the fierce gnoll. The citizens of Halas still fell
like flies but soon the <a href="../images/Knollwar/gnoll3.jpg">giant gnoll </a>began
to weaken. Then, he slowly fell to the ground as the surviving warriors
scattered. A great silence descended upon Everfrost for a moment. Then went up
the cheers and shouts that ring to this day in memory, &quot;For Halas! For
MacLear!&quot;</font></p>
<p><font size="4">Then those few who <a href="../images/Knollwar/victory.jpg"> survived</a> surrounded the <a href="../images/Knollwar/gnoll4.jpg">corpse</a>
and examined this wonder. <a href="../images/Knollwar/gnoll5.jpg">Tormod</a>
looked about warily and warned that the battle was not over. Again <a href="../images/Knollwar/gnoll6.jpg">groups
were formed</a> and set out to slay the White Dragon that had been loosed upon
the Plains of Everfrost, but that is a different story.</font></p>
<p><font size="4">Through the rest of the night the members of the Clan fought
and killed the stragglers from the army of gnolls that had dared to challenge
Halas and MacLear. Even as the last of them fell and the end of the age
approached, the gods again spoke to Tormod and warned him that the gnolls of
Blackburrow were defeated but not destroyed. The gods then charged Tormod to
eternal vigilance over the burrow with the prophesy that the great gnolls would
again break loose from their hidden prison and MacLear would be the Clan
standing between them and the destruction of Halas.</font></p>
<p><font size="4">On that night the Clan MacLear established its fame and
existence in the land of Norrath, later in the new age to be recognized by the
gods. On that night in the valley of the three Igloos Halas and the honor of
MacLear was saved. From that night on MacLears have shouted &quot;For Halas! For
MacLear!&quot;</font></p>
<font size="4">Another tale of the assault, from Nosferum:</font>
<blockquote>
  <font color="#3f5b20">
  <p><font size="4">Nosferum decided to forego his home with the Ashen Order in
  Freeport to defend Halas. About three hours before the final Sundering four
  Gnolls pledged an attack on Halas. They called out from the northern mouth of
  Blackborrow with slander and vex. &quot;BARK! BARK! All Halas will die
  tonight!&quot;</font>
  <p><font size="4">The Clan MacLear had all decided to stay to defend their
  home. Ready at the battlefield that night: thirty Barbarians, two Gnomes an
  Erudite, a High Elf, two Half Elves and a Monk. The air was chill as Nos
  scouted ahead to Blackborrow... ebbing his way to the maw of the Gnolls.</font>
  <p><font size="4">&quot;There... At the Three Igloos. A Gnoll named Kraddig,
  as big as a house!&quot;</font>
  <p><font size="4">Apparently, those big ears on the beast work well, because
  he charged me. Fleet of foot and light of load I turned on my heel and
  sprinted back to Halas. Kraddig stopped short and returned to the Three
  Igloos. It seems that he and the three other named Gnolls were to make camp at
  those igloos. The Clan MacLear and other Halasians swelled at the valley to
  the Three Igloos, warrily eyeing the invaders. Chief Tormod recognized the
  larger of the four as the Gnoll who had slain Feldor Stoutheart and his family
  of seven so many winters ago. Tormod's blood boiled within him, as out came a
  cry that rumbled the Underfoot. &quot;Cleanse the frozen earth with their
  blood, brethren! Cleve them!&quot; Ahead of us all charged Tormod, with total
  abandon. Behind him, Daran, Ikar, Onain, and a fleet of twenty others. Soon
  came tens of passers-by, casting in their volleys and sacrificing their lives
  for the hearth of the Everfrost Peaks. My blows to the invaders fell with
  impunity as, most often, I missed. It was then that I realize Quellious was
  teaching me something, even as I stood. Alone, we are nothing. When allied, we
  are everything.</font>
  <p><font size="4">Onain fell soon, as did ten others. Their offensive barrage
  lead to their own demise as the attackers focused on the most powerful.
  Tormod's life came into question on occasion as the Clan's healers revived him
  to ensure he finished his job. Tormod stepped back and let Daran absorb the
  blows to allow our healers to to their bidding. It was then that Kraddig's eye
  turned from the fray... to Tormod in the distance. &quot;YOU!&quot; &quot;Tormod,
  of the MacLears! You are alive?!&quot; &quot;I killed you! I watched your
  heart seep on the tundra ten winters ago. You and your wife and children...
  all eight of you!&quot;</font>
  <p><font size="4">Moments passed as Tormod realized his folly. His eyes welled
  up and his back wretched to let out a great, silent cry. While none could hear
  him, I could see the word from his lips: &quot;Noooooooo.&quot; Kraddig had
  come to Everfrost to rip Tormod from his clan so many years ago, but mistook
  Feldor for Tormod in that night. The MacLears had been killing Kraddig's
  sisters and cousins for decades, as Kraddig was a mere pup. As Kraddig grew
  beyond measure, it was clear that the great Gnoll intended to exact vengeance
  for his brood. One frozen night, in the tundra so many years ago, Kraddig
  crept from his grand lair to snuff the MacLear's chief and his heirs in their
  sleep. Tormod had asked Feldor Stoutheart of the Halas Guards to stand watch
  that night with his family in Tormod's stead as Tormod had a meeting with the
  High Council to attend. In Barbarian tradition, the night's guard to the Wooly
  Mammoth area would sentry with his wife and children nearby as they slept. It
  was their way. The frozen wastes took yet another family as Kraddig had snuck
  in the night and ate the hearts of the Night Watchman and his heirs. Kraddig
  had thought his home saved, since he beleived he had just slain the Chief of
  the greatest family in all of Halas... the MacLears. In truth, he had just
  slain a simple watchman with his devoted family.</font>
  <p><font size="4">Tormod had always known Kraddig as the murderer of his great
  friend, but he had never known WHY. With this Tormod lept forth, at half
  health, bearing only an iron sword in his hand and the spirits of eight
  Clansmen in his guff. Tormod's blade sang true as he sliced and severed poor
  Kraddig. The tide of the eve was clear as the Elders of the Clan, including
  Daran the Gnome cleft Kraddig's heart from his still-warm chest. The great
  Gnoll hero had fallen. Two of the other named Gnolls had already fallen and
  the last of the four-- in total-- was not far behind them. The Clan had,
  again, sent a great enemy to The Underfoot.</font>
  <p><font size="4">It was then that Halas raised a mug of ale in honor of all
  those who had died that evening. Many, many of whom were NOT MacLear, but had
  pledged their lives for the greater good of Halas. Tormod, stepped aside from
  the cheers and spoke quietly to himself. While I cannot begin to know what he
  said, I can only think he was asking the forgiveness of&nbsp; Feldor, whom
  Tormod had just avenged.</font>
  <p><font size="4">Bards will sing, and Shamans will chant of this night... the
  night Clan MacLear took back eight souls to rest in Halas again. I still walk
  alone, though. No family to sing of, no home to recall. Alone I tread softly
  as I pray to my Lord, &quot;May Quellious be with you, MacLears.&quot;</font></p>
