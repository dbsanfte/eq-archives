      &nbsp; &nbsp; No doubt, it will take some time to acclimate to these new weapons. Brother Wolfdor,
      in particular, is still prone to mace his enemies with his rifle. Now, before I continue, let us
      learn a few words.<BR>
      <BR>
      <B>Pistol</B> - Held in a single hand. Point the hole away.<BR>
      <B>Carbine</B> - Held usually in both hands. Again, point the hole away.<BR>
      <B>Rifle</B> - Always held in both hands and, again, point the hole away.<BR>
      <B>Vibro-</B> - A mechanical type of standard weapon that increases it's damage.
      <BR>
      <BR>
      &nbsp; &nbsp; Do not fret. There are more normal weapons in this land, though their design
      is strange and sometimes awkward. As can be expected, there are staves. There are swords, but
      you'll note that some are of a strange design. As well, there are two-handed axes and so forth.
      This essay will focus, mainly, on the newer seemingly magical weapons.<BR>
      <BR>
      &nbsp; &nbsp; These new weapons are called "guns" by the locals, and they are very dangerous. As
      noted before, make sure to point the hole <B>away</B> from yourself and <B>toward</B> the enemy.
      This is where the Gnomish fire spits out.
      <IMG SRC="weapons_essay_aim.jpg" ALIGN="right" width="282" height="148"> As you can see, the Bothan on the left is pointing
      the hole at the <B>enemy</B>, as these boys in white were nice enough to demonstrate. Pay attention to
      the arrow. The three types are the first three words we learned, and they all have a range
      of 65 meters.<BR>
      <BR>
      &nbsp; &nbsp; <B>Pistols</B> are small enough to be wielded in one hand. It takes no real strength
      to use any of these new weapons, but it does take a steady hand. Literally, you just point it and
      squeeze the triggering device placed just where your first finger would go. It is the least accurate
      of the three types at a long range, but it does rather well up close, within spear-throwing range.
      The training masters in the city teach that the primary role is to sap your foe's health. Those
      who choose to specialize in it even learn ways to use it as a blunt instrument.<BR>
      <BR>
      &nbsp; &nbsp; <B>Carbines</B> are a hybrid of the Pistol and the Rifle. They are actually built
      much like the Rifles, but are shorter. Because of this length, it is awkward to use in defense against a
      foe who uses melee. You <B>will</B> get hit harder by non-ranged enemies. Those who are good with this
      weapon focus mainly on keeping the enemy from moving around, and saps their stamina.<BR>
      <BR>
      &nbsp; &nbsp; <B>Rifles</B> are the longest of the three weapons, and requite two hands. They are the
      most accurate at their maximum range, and are a poor choice up close not only because of their inaccuracy,
      but because they are almost useless to parry. You will certainly take a lot of damage if hit with a melee
      weapon or an unarmed foe. I highly recommend either switching to a Pistol or some sort of brawler weapon
      when they get close.<BR>
      <BR>
      &nbsp; &nbsp; There are forces in this land similar to our former home, but a little more lenient. Rather
      than completely preventing you from using weapons well beyond your capacity you simply won't know how to
      use it effectively. The best weapons really only should be used by those of sufficient training.
