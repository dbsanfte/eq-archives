    <p></font><em><strong>&quot;Lassie why don&#146;t you tell us your whole story from the
beginning ? Thus far we have just heard bits and pieces&quot; I looked up into the face of
the towering warrior as he bent over to hand me a tureen of hot soup. His rough face was
weathered from battles with the harsh environment and scarred from battles with even more
deadly foes. I whispered a &quot;thanks&quot; as I took a sip from the steaming liquid.
The hot soup scalded my tongue but oh the warmth! As the soup hit the inside of my belly
it felt like boiling lava coursing through my body. I sat hunched over cupping the hot
vessel and feeling the steam on my face I just couldn&#146;t remember the last time I had
been this happy.</strong></em></p>

    <p><em><strong>&quot;You are a child of Halas eh lass?&quot; Bolmon asked. After I nodded
he added &quot;as am I and Kinan and some of these other warriors&quot;. I flinched as
shouts of &quot;Hail Halas! Hail MacLear!&quot; echoed against the rock walls.</strong></em></p>

    <p><em><strong>We had taken shelter in a shallow cave that the forces of nature had
hollowed out of a massive cliff wall. Looking out into the night I could see the snow
being madly driven by the wind. The howl of the wind would rise and fall like the call of
something deep and wild. I closed my eyes and listened to the rhythm, letting my body sway
back and forth to the song of my home land.</strong></em></p>

    <p><em><strong>&quot;Lass?&quot;, Bolmon repeated, which brought me out of my reverie. I
looked across to where he had taken a seat on the opposite side of the roaring fire. Then
I glanced around at the circle of men who were squatting and sitting close to the fire. I
took the final swallow of the now cold soup and began to speak.</strong></em></p>

    <p><em><strong>&quot;I&#146;m not sure how long I had been wandering before you found
me&quot; I stammered. &quot;It has been at least a week since I last saw someone on the
tundra. I tried to call out to them but the wind robbed me of my voice. I tried to follow
them but I lost them in the storm&quot;.</strong></em></p>

    <p><em><strong>&quot;Close to dead you were Shatara when we saw you lying in the
snow.&quot; The dwarf was rummaging through his backpack as he spoke and produced an old
but serviceable blanket that he draped over my shoulders. The blanket was so small that it
barely covered any of my back but I was grateful for the extra warmth. He peered deeply
into my eyes, his intense green eyes twinkling with a thousand sparkles of light. I knew
from his clothing and equipment that he was a holy man. He had been the one that had
brought me back from near death. &quot;Thanks Trok, you are too kind&quot; I said managing
the best smile that my painfully wind blistered and cracked face could muster. &quot;You
are welcome fine little lady&quot; he said with a flourishing bow. Then he quickly
retreated closer to the fire.</strong></em></p>

    <p><em><strong>&quot;How did you happen to be wandering around alone in the
wilderness?&quot; asked Mertok. I looked at the elf who obviously was a dealer in the
arcane arts. &quot;For the last few days while Trok has been working on you you&#146;ve
been mumbling about orcs and brigands and all types of such things&quot;.</strong></em></p>

    <p><em><strong>&quot;She was just having feverish dreams there studied one&quot; said Trok
with a sideways glance. &quot;I&#146;m sure there is nothing to worry about&quot;. </strong></em></p>

    <p><em><strong>&quot;Well that still doesn&#146;t explain how she got out there&quot; the
sorcerer sniffed as he adjusted his robe.</strong></em></p>

    <p><em><strong>&quot;Be quiet&quot;. The voice was old but solid and spoke with authority
that was not to be questioned. I looked at Kinan who was leaning back against the wall of
the cave. &quot;If the lass could get a word in edge wise I&#146;m certain we will soon
know all&quot;. &quot;Would you start from the beginning little one and tell us your
tale?&quot;</strong></em></p>

    <p><em><strong>&quot;Aye sir I will, listen and I will tell you as best that I can. I have
seen evil and perhaps such a strong and brave group such as yourselves can rid Norrath of
it!&quot; At this the men stirred slightly and Bolmon pulled his great 2 handed sword a
little closer. &quot;That sword is a long as I am&quot; I thought and I felt safe for the
first time in a long time being in the company of these men.</strong></em></p>

    <p><em><strong>&quot;I remember little of my childhood. I used to remember more but the
memories have slipped away from me like a bird&quot;.</strong></em></p>

    <p><em><strong>&quot;That is not uncommon, little one, considering the state that you were
in. Your memories will probably come back&quot; interrupted the dwarf. After a glance from
old Kinan silenced Trok I continued.</strong></em></p>

    <p><em><strong>&quot;My father was a brave warrior and my mother spoke with the spirits
and worked magic.&quot;</strong></em></p>

    <p><em><strong>&quot;Aye a shaman&quot; Bolmon said quietly.</strong></em></p>

    <p><em><strong>&quot;I believe that I was born in Halas but I have no memory of the city.
My childhood home was the tundra. My father had been sent to lead a relief group of men to
a hunting camp that was quite a distance across the frozen plains from Halas. My mother
went along to care for them and of course took me along I must have been about 5 or so at
the time although I don&#146;t really know. We were to be there for only several months
but the next group that came out to relive us ran into troubles with wandering bands of
orcs and when they arrived many of them needed to be immediately cared for by my mother.
The captain of that group had perished on the trip and my father decided that he would
stay to help fortify the defenses of the camp. He attempted to send my mother and I back
to Halas with the returning warriors and hunters but she said that her place was there,
taking care of the brave men of Halas. &quot;</strong></em></p>

    <p><em><strong>&quot;The troubles with the orcs increased. The hunting parties were being
harassed almost daily. My father sent word back to Halas with the next group that left
with their stores of meat for the city. Reinforcements needed to be sent out immediately.
Weeks later a couple of seriously wounded men staggered into camp. The warrior
reinforcements had been ambushed by a group of a hundred or more orcs. All had perished
save these two and I watched as one of them died lying with his head in my mother&#146;s
lap.&quot;</strong></em></p>

    <p><em><strong>&quot;My father instantly started making preparations to hunt these orcs
down. We were seriously outnumbered but the travel route between the hunting grounds and
Halas had been apparently cut off. Without the route being opened back up for safe travel
the citizens of Halas would starve. My father sent 3 separate runners back toward Halas
hoping that one of them would make it back to inform them of his plan. He hoped that an
army could leave from Halas and meet our group as we traveled back catching the orcs in
the middle and crushing them.&quot;</strong></em></p>

    <p><em><strong>&quot;The night before we were to depart the orcs fell upon us. The posted
guards went down in the rush as dozens of orcs stormed the camp from all directions.
Confusion and pandemonium was everywhere. I stumbled about trying to stay from underfoot.
I saw orcs being slayed to the left and the right. The ice was running with blood, the
snow colored deep crimson. Shouts and grunts filled the air. Still the orcs came, they
seemed to pour out of the ground itself. Our warriors were going down one by one.&quot; </strong></em></p>

    <p><em><strong>&quot;I saw my father standing with a pile of dead orcs around him. The
corpses were stacked so high that I could only see his shoulders and head as his blood
covered weapons flashed in the moonlight. A group of at least 20 orcs climbed up the pile
of their fallen brethren and descended on him in a writhing mass. I heard a scream and saw
my mother leave a fallen warrior and start running toward where my father had been but now
there was but a heap of moving arms, legs and bodies. I heard the most horrible sound
escape from what I assume was my father. Then I felt a sharp explosion on the back of my
head and saw only blackness.&quot; </strong></em></p>

    <p><em><strong>The silence in the cave was broken only by the crackle of the fire and the
wind outside. Finally Kinan stood and walked out to the edge of the precipice looking out
into the night. &quot;Aye lass I know well of this. One of the messengers that your father
sent back to Halas made it and a large army of warriors were gathered and quickly departed
to meet with your father&#146;s group. After days of quick movement, taking little time to
rest they arrived at the camp. There they found not a living soul only the frozen corpses
of the Sons of Halas and many many dozen orcs. In rage they hunted down and killed groups
of orcs. They were able to put down the orc uprising and make the hunting area and camp
safe again. Halas continued to be able to hunt it&#146;s food.&quot;</strong></em></p>

    <p><em><strong>Kinan turned and looked at me his old but still powerful frame filling the
entrance to the cave. &quot;You still have much a story to tell us Shatara for that event
happened almost 4 years ago. As hardy as our lot is I find it hard to believe that a
little girl survived for that long alone out there&quot; he chuckled with a broad sweep of
his hand behind him. &quot;We will stay here until this blizzard abates some. You will
have plenty of time to tell us more. You should rest now.&quot;</strong></em></p>

    <p><em><strong>&quot;Thank you Kinan I am still very tired&quot; I said as I laid down
close to the fire. Trok walked over to me, place his hand on my head and started mumbling
a very pleasant sounding chant in a language that I couldn&#146;t understand. The last
thing that I heard as I drifted off to sleep was Mertok whispering to Bolmon &quot;my
warrior friend where has she been all of this time, what has she seen?&quot; Bolmon
quietly replied to the user of magik &quot;evil Mertok, she said that she has seen evil
and looking into her eyes I believe that she indeed has&quot;.</strong></em></p>
