<H3>Chapter 1</H3>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Loden MacLear became aware he
was in a grove of trees. Even though it was still dark, he could hear the first
stirrings of the creatures that know better than we the coming of dawn. As was
his long habit upon waking, he did not move at all or even change his breathing,
but extended his senses around him warily. He could hear the horses nearby and
smell the familiar odor of their sweat and the leather of the packs and saddle.
On his left he heard a small shift in position as Shanna, his dog, awakened. The
spirit bind that linked them strengthened as the dog’s senses came fully
awake. She too extended her far sharper senses of hearing and smell around them,
sampling the gently moving night air close to the ground.
<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Carefully, he accounted for all
the sounds and smells in the small grove of twisted live oaks. Just as
importantly, he verified that there were no voids in the quiet rustlings of the
small creatures that would have announced danger as surely as the sudden
snapping of a twig. He smoothly pushed the dew coated sleeping cover from his
body and rose with a fluid motion. A sword appeared in his hand as if it had
sprung from his palms rather than being pulled from the hidden sheath beneath
cover. The light of the countless stars that seemed to hang just over the trees
revealed a lithe warrior who’s short beard was mostly gray and whose face was
no longer young. Looking at him carefully, an observer could see the confidence
in his movements born of command.
<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; As if linked by a physical bond,
the large wolf-like dog rose to his left and quickly disappeared into the
darkness. The insect sounds came reassuringly from all sides leaving no void in
which a wraith warrior could be hiding. Satisfied, the man again sat down. The
sword disappeared as silently as it had appeared. He reached into the pack he
had been using as a pillow and pulled out a fresh pair of socks. The socks were
quickly on his feet and, after a careful shaking in the inverted position, so
were a well-worn pair of leather boots.
<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Rising again with that smooth
motion that looked almost unnatural, he rolled up the sleeping mat and cover and
moved silently across to the nearest horse. He ran his hand gently along the
side of the tall mare and then reached up to her head and scratched around her
ears. Still without making a sound, he bent down to the ground and lashed the
sleeping roll to the back of a well used military saddle. He hoisted first a
blanket and then the saddle across the back of the unresisting horse. With the
same economy of motion he quickly greeted and then loaded a second horse with
packs tightening the girth with a quick smooth pull.
<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; An observer who knew horses
would have been amazed to see the practiced ease of the man and even more so the
discipline of the horses that stood so silently as they were loaded in the
slowly graying darkness. Within moments from the first sign of visible movement
in the grove of trees, the man, the dog, the gear and the horses had disappeared
as if they had never been there. As the gray bearded human led the horses up a
nearby draw towards the dimming northern star, he thought how foolish many
travelers were to have a camp fire in the camp and to begin the morning by
relieving themselves then creating even more smell and light by building up the
fire and beginning to cook right where they had spent the night. In the long
years of war recently behind him he had seen and caused many such camps to be
the last their makers had the chance to experience.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; After about thirty minutes
silent walking, he dropped the lead of the riding horse on the ground. Both
horses stopped and stood silent in the darkness. The man carefully circled back
to the left and up the side of the ravine. Slowly, carefully, he extended his
head around a rock near the crest of a small ridge and watched his campsite as
it came into view with the graying eastern sky. To his right he sensed the
presence of his canine companion. As the light grew he could see that nothing
moved around the grove of trees. Slowly his eyes scanned the surrounding terrain
for any sign of movement. The only life he saw was a small herd of deer crossing
to the east as they slipped along in the shadows of darkness remaining like
puddles of water after a rain. Soon the sun would evaporate the darkness as
readily as it did water in the desert. By that time the deer too would have
vanished to their daytime hiding places.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; He turned his attention to the
west, his presumed direction of travel this day and for days to come. To his
left was a wide river valley threaded with a meandering dark line of trees that
marked the course of the small stream that qualified for a river in this parched
country. Scattered here and there were groves of gnarled and twisted oaks like
the one in which he had sheltered for the night. Unlike the soft wooded trees
along the stream banks, he knew these ancient groves were sacred to the dark
skinned tribes who held claim to this harsh country. He understood their awe of
the groves that sometimes covered areas hundreds of paces across but were
actually only one tree linked together underground. Their huge trunks and broad
limbs rarely rose more than four man-heights above the ground, but their size
and slow growth gave evidence of a life more ancient than any other in that
land. The paths in and out of the groves, where they existed at all, were
twisted and maze like, weaving in and out of the huge limbs that often ran along
just above or even on the ground.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The Warunga or Wraith People, as
his people sometimes called them, considered the groves places of intense spirit
activity and power. They believed that each grove, or more properly, tree, was
inhabited by an ancient spirit being that spent most of it’s time sleeping.
Awakening such a spirit was to be done with great care for it could take control
of any person that came within the grove and cause him to go forth under its
control for good or for evil. They called those spirits Chisos and believed the
Chisos had formed this land and lived as the first people here.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; In those ancient days, so it was
said, the Chisos walked freely in forms not unlike those who walk today. The
Chisos were all male and their wives were the sky gods, the Tarcuna whose forms
still march across the sky in late summer flashing bolts of lightning and
calling to their sleeping husbands with voices of thunder. As they pass over
their sleeping forms, the Tarcuna pour out their sweet tears bringing life again
to the land. Sometimes in their anger that their husbands will not arise and go
with them to dance in the wet country to the east, they lash out with bolts of
fire and blast the ancient trees or even the very mountain tops.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Sometimes a Chisos awakens and
reaches up to greet his bride in her cloud form. When that happens the Tarcuna
will reach down to the earth with a clear, slender arm. When the arm touches the
ground it is filled with the Chisos’ spirit and he, in turn, draws his ancient
body up into the arm, making it his own. The howling and roaring of the Chisos
as he rises to meet his bride is the most terrifying of all the sounds of the
earth. He takes the strength of the Tarcuna and makes it his own. The dance they
make across the land is like nothing else in the world as the Chisos jumps from
place to place stripping the land bare wherever his foot touches the ground.
Often several Chisos dance together with one Tarcuna. Whenever that happens a
great chief of the Chisos is always near and the path of destruction he leaves
on the land is evident for many years to follow.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The river valley led upstream to
the west and then turned through a ridge to the north before again resuming its
westerly path as a line of green in the brown and gray terrain. With the
lightening sky to his back, Loden could see no evidence of movement anywhere in
the valley or the hills around.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; He slipped silently back down
into the draw and squatted to remove the skins from the hooves of his horses.
Any tracks he would leave all seemed to start from nowhere and end the same way.
The horses had already taken advantage of the stop to relieve themselves and
continue the never-ending task of processing the sparse grass into strength and
droppings for the bugs to eat. Loden followed suit, at least with regard to the
emptying of waste product, which he carefully concealed off to one side of the
draw. He then opened a pack on the second horse and removed trail cakes made of
dried meat and grain. Mounting the saddled horse, he turned its head to the west
and continued his long journey.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; As he rode in and out of draws
well up the north side of the valley hidden from view by the low cedar and thorn
trees, his thoughts turned to his home now many weeks behind. Coming home from
the great orc war, he found his manor and estate in disarray but his wife,
daughters and servants all none the worse for wear. His sons, though, were a
different matter. Father and sons had all gone together at the call to arms when
the orc army invaded from the great swamp in the far southeast where they had
long held sway. For three years, the humans had first retreated then rallied and
finally emerged victorious. As the leader of one of the companies that had
penetrated the orc lines and set up ambush to their rear, he could believe the
rumor that few of the invaders had survived to return to their swamp kingdom.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Just before the tide of war turned, a cache of documents had been
captured from the orcs. In it was an ancient tome that described an artifact of
great power. The artifact was reported to have the power to transport people and
even bands of warriors to other places in the twinkling of an eye. Only a small
part of the original document was preserved, but even without the instructions
for controlling the item the tremendous potential for either side was
immediately recognized. The company of orcs carrying the document had,
apparently been on a mission to penetrate the human lines and proceed far to the
west where the manuscript indicated one of the magic teleporters was hidden.
According to the ancient writings and the map fragment with it, beyond the hill
country and the high plains, there was an island of mountains deep in a
forbidding desert bounded on its south side by a river flowing out of a great
canyon cut through a gigantic cliff and reentering another canyon on the eastern
side of the mountains. To the north and east was a great vertical wall of stone
thrust from the ground with but one entrance. To the northwest was a volcanic
waste indicated on the map as a place of death for those who entered.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Among Loden’s people there had long been a legend of an isolated group
of mountains to the west full of strange magic and wonders. He had assumed it to
be one of the superstitions of the Warunga and had paid it no mind. As he
replenished his supplies in the most western human outpost, the town of
Junction, he had again heard rumors of those mountains. Junction, where the
river he was following upstream met another before continuing east, was the only
town in all of humandom where the Warunga and humans mingled willingly. The
Warunga wanted the rare steel weapons and tools the humans had and the humans
wanted the gold, silver and skins the Warunga seemed to have in abundance.
Neither allowed the other to trespass on their territory so a place of trade was
a matter of necessity. There too, he had heard that his sons had passed through
over a year before. They told no one there their destination, but as soldiers on
a secret mission, that was to be expected.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; After the human wizards had
pondered over the captured documents and maps, they convinced the king and his
counselors that it was critically important to have the artifact referred to in
the document, if only to prevent the orcs from having it. At first the plan was
to send a reinforced company west to seize the artifact from its resting place
in the Chisos Mountains. Loden, among others, had been called to advise the
generals on how to best do this. He, not knowing the effect it would have on him
and his family, advised them that the land to the west of Junction would not
support a large band of soldiers. Worse, the Warunga would consider it an act of
war to send a large force into their territory. In his opinion, having long
dealt with them from his holdings on the west border of humandom, the Wraith
warriors would take the company out one at a time as they slept and as they
traveled. Many times over the long years since humans had first come to the
country, groups of adventurers or even warriors had disappeared into the western
hills. Only rarely had even one or two survivors returned to tell what had
befallen the others.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; After he had returned to his
ranger company a call went forth through the human army for any who had
knowledge of the Warunga or the land to the west of human civilization. Loden
and his men had been deep in orc territory and had missed hearing of it until
after they returned. By then the call had been cancelled and he was thankful, as
he would have felt obliged to answer but questioned the sanity of any such
mission. His advice to the generals was that the artifact was probably quite
safe as it was in the most holy place of the most fearsome people known, the
Warunga. It did not occur to him that the reason the call had been lifted was
that it had been filled. More specifically, three young officers had come forth
who claimed to know the ways and the language of the Warunga and were eager for
adventure and fame. The three were his sons.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The Warunga, as they called themselves, or the Wraith, as the humans
called them, never would stand in battle like men or even orcs. Rather they
would raid and snipe at their enemies always leading them deeper into the dry
and deadly land they called their home. He knew it was a matter of great pride
to them that outsiders had never escaped from their land to reveal the location
of the secret water places, or even the trails within their homeland.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Living as he had for so many years on the boundary of civilization with
nothing to the west of his land but the steep hills and deep canyons of the
Warunga Hill Country, he had thought it wise to offer gifts to the local tribe.
Shortly after coming to the narrow hidden valley he now called home, he had
noticed a group of Warunga outlined on a ridge to the west each evening at
exactly the same time. Knowing that the Warunga rarely allowed themselves to be
seen by humans, he guessed that he was being tested or that a message of some
kind was intended by their obvious presence.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; After four evenings of seeing the line of warriors sitting on their
ponies as the sun set behind them, he determined that the several previous
owners of the narrow but very fertile valley had failed in this test. Each had
been effectively run off by the slow, harassing slaughter of their livestock one
by one. If that had not been enough, next they would find a dead watch dog on
their porch one morning with its throat slit by a stone knife. Failure to get
the message at that point resulted in the death of one of their workers. In each
case, the worker would have his throat slit while he slept in a bunk house full
of other workers and sentries walking guard. Each time that had happened, the
owner himself would awaken to find yet another dead dog, but this time the dog
would have been killed at the foot of its master’s bed.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; In the 150 or so years that humans had been trying to farm and raise
livestock in this beautiful, fertile valley, not one had stayed after that
night. Within a day of abandonment, any buildings or structures the humans had
erected would be disassembled and have disappeared as if they had never been
there. It was rumored that smoke would rise up from within the hills within a
few days as the Warunga burned the timbers and furnishings of the abandoned
holding as a sacrifice to the Chisos and the Warunga.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; When he heard of the valley and noted that it was for sale by its most
recent owner, or victim, depending on your perspective, he had purchased it for
a fraction of what he presumed it to be worth. Before he made any attempt to
move into the valley, he had carefully questioned all the people in the area who
claimed to have any knowledge of the Warunga. He first concluded that every one
of the previous owners had made the potentially fatal error of cutting down one
or more live oak trees. The Warunga, believing as they do that they are the
descendants of the Chisos, saw that as desecration of their ancestors.
Secondarily, he concluded that the previous owners had made no attempt to
“redeem” the land from the Warunga with a gift of some kind.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; On the fifth day of the Warunga visitation, he purchased a fattened calf
from a nearby farm. As the afternoon matured, he led the calf to the flat rock
upon which he had seen the warriors the previous nights. He tied the calf to a
small live oak growing out of the center of the rock and laid a well shaped
steel knife in front of the calf. The knife alone was worth more than he had
paid for the land from the previous owner but he figured that it was a simple
case of two parties each having claim to the land. As he laid the knife on the
rock he had a sudden strong feeling that he was being watched. A chill went down
his spine and despite his long experience and many brushes with death he had to
force control over his body to keep from shuddering.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; One of the reasons he was alive by the end of the war was his nearly
magical ability to sense when someone was looking at him. He had long known that
he had such a talent for men and animals, but was surprised to find that it was
even more acute when the watcher was an orc. The knowledge of presence that he
had was a comfort to him and had saved both his and his soldiers’ lives on
many an occasion when they otherwise would have fallen to ambush or raid. The
only way a person could hide his presence from him was to concentrate on <i>not</i>
looking at or thinking about Loden.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Since anyone not even thinking about him was normally not a great threat
the talent was quite useful. He also knew it was dangerous to rely too heavily
on it. One time, while on a raid into the orc army’s rear, he had stumbled
across a company of orcs just settling down for the night. Because of their
exhaustion from a long day of marching and the skill of their leader, they had
neither kindled a fire nor were engaging in the normal loud bickering and
boisterousness that marked orc encampments. He and his men were among the orcs
before either they or the humans were aware of the other’s presence. Since the
orcs did not know he was there, they were not thinking about him and were as
invisible to him as he was to them. On that occasion they had been saved by the
relentless drills he had put his men through until they could be aroused from a
sound sleep and instantly react to an ambush, each man knowing exactly where the
others were, even in complete darkness. The well-trained and coordinated humans
responded as one organism, chewing through the orcs like a sharpened saw through
rotten wood. Only later did they realize they had been outnumbered more than
three to one.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The Warunga were a different story. They alone of all the beings he had
encountered were able to come into his presence without notice. On several
occasions, upon entering his land or the hills around it, he had backtracked to
find that he had been followed without ever having sensed the presence of his
followers. There were two opinions among the few rangers who had experienced
their unsensed presence and lived to speak of it. One was that the Wraith had
some power to blind the inner eye of humans. Others believed they could mask
their presence somehow by some inner discipline or talent. Loden’s conclusion
was in agreement with the second group. In either case though, the Warunga had
made themselves known to him here and now.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The question that raced through
his mind was, “Why now?” He had heard tales of the Wraith allowing their
presence to be known only after they were in the midst of a camp in order to
panic the ones they wished to destroy. The fact that he could sense their
presence only a few paces from him so clearly confirmed the rumor that they had
complete control over the sense and that bothered him too. Few humans had such a
sense as did he and the fact that the Warunga could and had announced their
presence in such a manner could be a very strong indication they knew of his
talent.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Once again the long, difficult
ranger training he had received so many years ago came to the fore. It is not
uncommon for a ranger to encounter an unexpected situation when ranging ahead or
to the flanks of an army. In every unexpected situation there were nearly
endless possibilities. Trying to sort through such a tangle was confusing at
best and paralyzing at worst. Deep within the ancient wooded hills of the Ranger
Forest he had learned to focus on that which is known and leave the speculation
of what might be to a later time. He activated that discipline now, clearing his
mind of thought and allowing his training to take over.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Rising from where he had
deposited the knife he turned toward the thick oaken underbrush to the west
where he sensed the presence of the Warunga. He first bowed in the direction of
the setting sun then drew his sword, placing the guard against his forehead with
the blade pointed upward. He then swung the blade down and to the right, opening
his chest to those in front of him in the formal military salute of an officer
to his superiors. He held the position for what seemed like an eternity while he
waited to see if an arrow would suddenly appear protruding from his exposed
torso.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Just as he was beginning to be
convinced that exposing the top of his head and then his chest to the hidden
warriors was probably a foolish impulse, five dark warriors seemed to appear
from nowhere to stand in the shade just in front of the tree line now
silhouetted by the lowering sun. With the sun at their backs above them it was
difficult to see any great detail about them but he was sure he saw no movement
before they became visible. For the first time he truly appreciated how they had
earned the name “Wraith” from the humans along the frontier.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; By instinct, luck or perhaps
telepathy, he had done the only thing that would have made them expose
themselves and later acknowledge him as a fellow being worthy of life. That
moment was the beginning of a relationship that was as far as he or the Warunga
knew was unique in the history of their peoples. He had chosen the right moment
to expose himself and offer his sword, not to the Warunga as he thought, but to
the sun. It was only later after learning their tongue that he discovered they
worshiped the sun as the great high god. He also learned why they so greatly
desired steel weapons.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; With the Warunga as with all the
races, steel or even iron was greatly prized and extremely valuable. Among the
humans the rare find of a meteorite, or the even more rare vein of iron,
provided them with the raw material for a steel implement that would not chip
and would hold its edge longer than other materials. Knowing that iron was born
either from the fiery descent of a meteor or in the fire pit of a volcano and
gained its great strength from only the hottest of fires, the Warunga had
concluded it was far more than the raw material for making tools. It was to them
a gift of the great fire god, which men called the sun and the Warunga called
Chi. When he made the snap decision to offer a formal military salute to the
wood line where he knew the warriors were waiting, he had faced the sun on the
day of equinox within the hour of its setting and unknowingly offered his steel
to the service of Chi. The question he could not answered was from where or whom
the desire had come.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; At least one of the warriors he
later discovered had desired him to do exactly what he did. Just as they had
communicated their presence to him by an act of their will, he guessed that he
could have received the impression of what he should do. The combination of the
impression along with the ranger mind-clearing discipline could have allowed him
to respond to the thought and desire communicated to him by the warrior. He knew
that on more than one occasion he and his company of rangers had responded to
attacks without sound passing between them and each known exactly what to do to
support the others as if they all were an extension of one being rather than the
individuals they had been before becoming a unit. If that same talent had
somehow been activated, it would account for his odd reaction to the Warunga.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The Warunga had a rather
different opinion of what had happened on that rock. They had shown themselves
for four days and had returned for the fifth, the holy number of The People, the
translation of the word Warunga into human language. It was their custom to show
themselves to any who trespassed upon the land they considered under their
stewardship five times. If by the end of the fifth showing the intruder showed
no recognition sign that he or they were indeed People, then they were to be
considered demons and either expelled or killed. If intruders damaged any of the
sacred oaks then there was no need for showing but only exorcism or death
remained as possible solutions.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The high priest of the local
Warunga had prophesied that the five days for this one should end on Chithane,
the day when the Chi, the sun, began to spend more time under the ground than
above it. According to their legends, that was the day the tide of darkness
begins to win the eternal war and the warriors of the Warunga prove their
courage and loyalty by dedicating themselves to Chi to hold off the darkness
with fire, steel and flint on the surface so that Chi could be victorious over
the darkness under the earth and return again to rule the heavens. The priest
had prophesied that on the day of Chithane, blood would be shed and steel would
be dedicated to the service of Chi and his sons, the Chisos.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Loden often wondered later just
how unhappy the priest had been when told of he miraculous conversion of the
human to be recognized by the Warunga as one of the People. His prior prophecies
had indeed come true as the blood of humans in the small valley was shed and
steel tools and weapons had been captured. In his experience, when priests
called for bloodshed, a single calf was not what they had in mind. On this
Chithane, the blood shed was that of the fattened calf and the steel dedicated
was that of Loden’s sword and the knife he had laid at the head of the calf.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Although Loden had, at that
time, long despaired of finding any truth or practicality in religion, the
thought now often crossed his mind that he knew of no other source from where
the inspiration might have come to bring a calf and a knife to that rock on that
day. Nor was he sure from where the impulse came that caused him to turn his
back on the warriors, pick up the knife from the rock and use it to slit the
throat of the calf, causing a geyser of blood to pour out on the rock and drain
into the hole from which grew the single oak in the middle of the rock. Once
again he had done not only the right thing but the exceptional thing. He had
watered a sacred oak with blood, an obligation of a warrior of the Warunga to
seal the covenant of steel. With no knowledge of the ways of the Warunga and
precious little even of their language, he had managed to perform the sacred
rites on exactly the right day and even in front of the right Warunga to become
the only human admitted to the Band of Steel, the secret society of the most
elite Warunga warriors.

<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; As he continued to ride along
the north side of the valley with the sun still to his back, Loden looked down
at the band of steel that incased his left arm from the wrist nearly to the
elbow. Were it not for the stark reality of that strange unrusting metal that
had become as much a part of him as the very arm it covered, there were times
when he would have not been able to believe the weeks that followed the meeting
on the rock were anything but a dream.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Three times during the great orc war, the band on his left arm had saved
him from death, or at least serious, disfiguring injury. Each time he had been
at least as surprised as the orc who thought he was delivering a killing blow to
the ranger captain. When he instinctively threw his arm up at becoming aware of
an axe or sword swinging toward his exposed neck or head, he should have seen
his arm severed, or at least knocked aside by the tremendous energy of the
swinging blade. Each time, though, the strange metal from which the band was
made seemed to absorb the entire energy of the swing, and then reflect it back
down the blade to the hand of his assailant. Each of the three times he had seen
almost certain death recoil upon his opponent, as the hilt seemed to jump from
the orc’s hand leaving the hand itself unusable. In each case Loden, reacting
from training rather than thought, returned a blow to his enemy that ended the
orc’s life before the rather interesting academic question of whether the
apparent lifelessness of his opponent’s hand was temporary or permanent could
be answered. Only after the battle had ended and he had time to reflect, did he
realize the force of the blow would have been sufficient to break his arm even
with a metal guard.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The first time it had happened, the orc must have weighed ten times as
much as he, and that bulk included arms nearly as large as Loden’s torso! The
monster of an orc had swung a two handed axe larger than any he had seen before
or since. A rather ordinary orc (if you can bring yourself to believe that a
hulking, hairy, slobbering beast whose normal mass was twice that of the typical
barbarian, and sported five inch fangs extending over his lower jaw, qualifies
for the word normal) had attacked Loden from the right. He turned and engaged
the brute and was quickly assisted by another ranger who was able to impale the
orc in the vulnerable spot just under the arm where the armor did not quite
cover.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; As the orc began to sag with that puzzled look on his face that seemed
to be fairly normal as bullies, orc or otherwise, found themselves defeated by
what they considered to be inferior beings, Loden became intensely aware of a
distinctly unfriendly presence on his left. He spun to face the threat and
immediately noted that a very large something was where nothing had been a few
moments before. The next thing that struck him was that the very large thing now
to his front had both arms extended upwards so far as to be outside of his range
of sight. He rapidly concluded that a very large, very hostile, being with his
arms extended upward, but rotating them downward was, in all likelihood, not a
good sign. In the split second or so he had to react, he was intensely aware
that his sword was hung up in some part of the smaller orc’s equipment or
limbs and all he could throw between his body and the gigantic, double edged axe
blade being propelled toward the point where his neck and shoulder met, was his
left forearm! Had he time at that moment to consider the probable outcome, he
would have rightly concluded that he was effectively dead.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; He couldn’t actually say he saw the axe hit the metal band covering
his forearm because it was moving so fast it had become a dark blur. He did know
that his mind had formed the question, “I wonder how it will feel be to cut in
half?” followed by, “This should answer my questions about what, if
anything, follows life.” but when the axe made contact with the metal he
felt… nothing…<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; He held his arm in place, slightly in front and above his head and
stared at it in disbelief. His first thought was that he must have died so
quickly he didn’t notice it and now had his spirit body while his physical
body was sliced in two pieces on the ground. He tore his eyes away from his arm
and looked down the front of his armor expecting to see either his chest ripped
into two pieces or some sort of perfection from the spirit world. His disbelief
multiplied as he was clearly in one piece and still wearing the bloody,
stinking, dirty raiment he had been longing to scratch under for the past
several hours.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; He continued staring down the front of his chest for a moment and it
suddenly occurred to him that even if he was unharmed, there was probably still
a seriously massive and undoubtedly very angry orc standing in front of him, who
recently had been reported to be in possession of a deadly weapon of immense
proportions. His head snapped up and focused on the orc-mountain, which, sure
enough, was still standing right where he was last seen. Possibly because of the
greater distance nerve impulses had to travel to reach whatever orcs use for
brains, the extra-large-would-be-ranger-captain-killer standing in front of him,
was still in the staring-at-body-parts mode, as he attempted to account for what
had, or more accurately, had not, happened. In his case, it was his hands at
which he was staring.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; In one of those odd events of hand-to-hand combat that those who have
never been there cannot appreciate, both the monster-orc and Loden were frozen
in place staring at the orc’s hands. Two things registered immediately to
Loden. First, they were empty! It was as if the small tree sized axe handle had
simply vanished. Second, they were apparently frozen with the fingers spread out
and back as far as they would go.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Perhaps because Loden partially considered himself already dead, a
stray, objective, thought flipped through his mind, “Whoa! I bet that hurts a
bunch!” The feeling came to mind of the time he had swung an axe at a tree in
his youth only to have it glance off the wood and make a square impact on very
solid rock. The stinging numbness had shot all the way up his arms and down his
spine and left him unable to grasp anything for several minutes afterward.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Of course, the orc’s axe had not simply vanished but had flown
backwards over the orc’s shoulder and, as such things happen, it was
determined afterward that it did split a warrior pretty much in two.
Unfortunately for the orcs, the splitee was determined to be the orc captain
rather than the ranger captain. Said orc captain had apparently considered a
position several steps behind his behemoth-in-residence the most advantageous
for leading the battle, in retrospect, a clearly incorrect tactical decision.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; After what seemed like an eternity, but probably was about five seconds,
it occurred to Loden that although the orc was now unarmed, and in possession of
what appeared to be either very painful or numbed hands, staring at said hands
was unlikely to resolve the personal difference of opinion that had arisen
between them. It was quite clear to Loden, that the unfulfilled purpose-in-life
of the rather substantial mass to his front, was to create ranger-mulch from
rangers, captain or otherwise. This presented the intellectual challenge of
exactly how does one take down an armored being so enormous, that a full sized
man was at that moment staring it directly in the stomach?<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Given the rather significant size of said stomach as it protruded from
under the chest-plate, Loden surmised that, like many who preferred eating to
armor, the orc had no armor over his stomach parts. He glanced up toward the top
of the mass and noted that the familiar puzzled look was still wrinkling the
incredibly ugly brow as it continued to stare at the place where quite recently
an axe handle had been in residence.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Satisfied that the mountain would not be coming to him, for a few more
moments at least, Loden backed up about five paces, and in doing so managed to
extricate his two handed sword from whatever unseen tangle had been holding it.
He leveled the sword directly in front of him with the blade edges horizontal
and the tip pointed slightly upward, locked his arms, and ran at the orc with
all the strength in his being. Sure enough, the blade slid under the
monster-sized breastplate as Loden forced his body upward, driving the sword
into the chest cavity above his head.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; As the hilt of Loden’s sword encountered the bottom of the orc’s
breastplate, it came to a stop. With four feet of steel extended upwards to the
vicinity of where the orc heart ought to be, presuming he had one, Loden felt
rather satisfied that he had chosen the correct approach to this problem. Then
it occurred to him that the sword he was grasping so firmly was still above his
head! According to all he knew about sword wounds and similar subjects, the
insertion of four feet of steel into even the largest orc’s chest should have
resulted in some movement. Although in the rush of the moment he had not
considered exactly what result he expected from his charge, and the resulting
penetration of the giant’s defenses, he was sure complete non-movement was not
included in the desired results.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Faced with this new and intellectually challenging problem, Loden
exercised his sharp wit and intellect by rotating his head to look up at the
still rather distant face directly above his. The first point of new information
his eyes reported was that the rather unintelligent eyes were no longer focused
on the orc’s hands. Rather, the still puzzled brow now surmounted a set of
rather displeased and pig-like orbits that were staring directly at him! Then he
realized that the probable reason its hands were no longer the focus of
attention was that they were now behind Loden. That would explain that the
sudden tightening in his chest was not from fear, although that was beginning to
reassert itself now that he was gradually becoming convinced he was not dead,
but from the fact that the orc was embracing him with a hug not exactly intended
to convey affection.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Fortunately, as with everything else that had happened in the past few
seconds, things had gone significantly more right than wrong for Loden. As he
followed his sword into single combat, the orc’s hands and arms had been
extended downward. When the orc began to close them around Loden they were also
coming up, and in doing so were pulling Loden up over the rounded top of the
previously mentioned stomach bulge. Loden kept his arms extended and locked as
the orc squeezed him upwards and watched in amazement as the hilt of his sword
was forced under the breastplate. His hands, then his wrists, and finally his
metal covered forearms followed his sword into the chest cavity. About halfway
up the forearms, the orc-mountain gave a great shudder, rattling Loden’s now
well off the ground bones, and began to weave first forward, then backwards.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Just as the weave switched again from backwards to forwards, a veritable
waterfall of blood came gushing from the cavity now being held open by Loden’s
arms. As he wrenched his head to the side to avoid the flood poring over him,
another odd, objective thought crossed his mind, &quot;It would certainly be
noteworthy to be the only ranger ever to have drowned in orc blood.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; That thought was quickly banished by the realization that if this
particular orc continued to fall forward, drowning would not be the issue, nor
would he need to be buried as he would already be flattened under a small
mountain of orc. With all his will he commanded the orc to fall backward! Noting
that even non-mountainous orcs were not too responsive to his will, he began to
pray fervently for backwardness to assert itself on just this one orc.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; As if in response to his prayer or perhaps his willed command, the orc
seemed to regain his strength for a moment and attempted to stand up. Of course,
that meant his not-insubstantial mass was propelled backwards to correct his
recent forward leanings. Just as he should have been arresting his rearward
momentum to arrive at the upright position, the orc shuddered one more time and
sagged, finally, to the rear!<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; As his forearms were now locked rather solidly under the breastplate and
ribcage of the giant, Loden had no choice but to go along for the ride. First
slowly, and then with increasing speed, he felt himself going both forward and
down. The orc hit the ground with a tremendous “thud.” Although he had ended
the ride on top of the giant, the weight of the orcish arms still above him were
enough to knock the small amount of remaining breath out of Loden’s lungs.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; A strange silence seemed to settle over everything. Loden attempted to
open his eyes, but could see nothing but a dull red glow. He tried to move, but
the great weight of the orc’s arms over his back, combined with the fact that
his forearms were still trapped by the breastplate, prevented him from moving
anything but his legs. He strained to breathe and found he could, but just
barely, and with great difficulty and pain. Once again he called upon his
reportedly superior intellect and quickly concluded he was dead meat if he did
not somehow find a way to correct the current situation. All he had to do was
make a dead orc giant release him while simultaneously find a way of extracting
his arms from said orc’s chest cavity. His intellect also noted that it was
statistically impossible for a sufficient number of those things to happen in
the few minutes until he suffocated, so he was once again effectively dead.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Noting that his intellect had incorrectly pronounced him dead several
times in the last few minutes, he decided that it had been rendered unreliable
by current events and should be ignored. Loden switched to plan B, commonly
entitled: “When in Doubt and Imminent Danger of Death, Kicking and Screaming
Probably Won’t Hurt Anything and Just Might Help.”<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The Kicking and Screaming plan was immediately initiated over the feeble
objections of his intellect. He began to kick his legs with all the energy he
could muster while using the limited air he had been able to draw into his lungs
to attempt a yell for help. He was disappointed to note that the attempted
bellow sounded much more like a protest from a drowning mouse than the
commanding cry for assistance he had intended.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Suddenly, the weight on his back lifted and he felt his legs being
pulled by great strength. His arms threatened to completely abandon the
operation and remain in the orc’s chest but finally agreed, after signaling
their displeasure, to come along with the rest of the body. Surprisingly enough,
they were good enough to drag along the hands, which were still firmly grasping
his longsword.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Numerous unseen hands raised him to his feet and he felt his face wiped
sufficiently clear of blood to enable him to see and breath again. His first
action was to draw in a deep breath of wonderful air! That action, although
greatly appreciated by the rest of his body, brought extreme protests of pain
from his thoroughly bruised ribs.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Opening his eyes, he found himself surrounded by several rather shocked
looking rangers who were staring at him as if he were a monster himself. He
looked down at his aching chest and promptly realized the cause of their
expressions. He was absolutely and completely bright red with orc blood draining
from under his armor and down his arms. His clothes and armor were ripped and
awry with blood streaming out of every tear and gouge. He looked back up at the
pale and shocked expressions on the ranger’s faces.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The thought ran through his mind, &quot;Sure, this was a heck of a lot
of orc blood, but it was just more of what all of us have seen before.&quot;
Then it occurred to him that they thought it was his blood that was draining out
on the ground!<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Loden threw his head back, drew in another lungful of air, and laughed a
deep and heartfelt laugh. Painful as it was for his bruised ribs, that laugh was
the best laugh he believed he had ever experienced. Within seconds, they were
all laughing and cheering at the victory.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Those who had witnessed the battle between Loden and the giant orc later
told him it had all occurred in but a couple of minutes. To Loden it seemed to
have taken hours or even days. They told him too, that when the giant’s axe
split the orc captain in two, the rest of the orcs had panicked. Few had escaped
as the rangers put their bows to good use bringing down the fleeing monsters.
The rest of the company had pursued the stragglers, but those directly around
Loden had turned at his bellow, “For MacLear!” as, seemingly being pulled
forward by his sword, he charged the giant as if he were on the jousting field.
They had then watched, frozen in place as his sword and then arms had
disappeared into the orc’s body even as the orc had seemed to be assisting
Loden in its own demise.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The rangers extracted the giant’s axe from the body of the orc captain
and offered it to Loden as a trophy. He had considered keeping until he
attempted to pick it up. He could lift it…just barely, but not on the first
try! It would have taken a packhorse to carry the gigantic weapon, not something
ranger companies had in great numbers. Instead they buried it and later made a
gift of the axe to the king.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The Warunga priest had promised
him that the magic that bound the band to his arm would do more than keep the
metal from rusting and his arm from chafing, much more, but refused to say just
what that was. Actually, during the first week he was among the Warunga, and for
many weeks to follow, he didn’t have a clue what was being said, other than
what they chose to explain by much pointing and gesturing. He did recognize that
a great gathering of senior Warunga was convened in the camp to which they took
him about a week after he arrived. He figured it took that long for the call to
go out to wherever they had come from and for the senior Warunga to journey to
the camp. Later he understood that many of them had come from such a distance
that the call must have been transmitted instantly, and the ensuing week was
even far too short for any human to have traveled the distance some of them had
come.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; During that time he waited,
first unknowingly, for the arrival of the elders and senior priests of the
tribe, and then while they deliberated and examined him again and again. During
that entire period, four of the five warriors who had appeared in front of him
stayed with him almost constantly. Occasionally one of them would disappear for
a short period of time, but it was clear that they considered remaining in his
presence the most important thing in their life for those days. He was well fed
and allowed to wander almost anywhere in the village. The notable exceptions
were the grove of oaks in the center of the encampment where the elders were
meeting and anywhere more than about a bow shot from the camp. Even when he
would try to go further they were never violent about restraining him. They
almost seemed afraid of him as they showed great agitation when he would near
the invisible boundary of his captivity. Even with almost no knowledge of their
language he could tell they were pleading with him not to go further. As much as
he wanted to return to his wife to tell her he was all right, he recognized the
danger of offending his “hosts.” As the days went by he became more and more
convinced they would not attack him if he left but that they would consider it a
serious breach of trust and honor.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; At the beginning of his forth
week among The People, as he later knew they called themselves, he was awakened
and taken to a deep pool of water near the camp. There his companions, as he now
called them, stripped him of his weapons and clothes and scrubbed him thoroughly
from head to foot. As he emerged from the water, they dressed him in a Warunga
loincloth and produced a bowl of some blue substance. They carefully applied the
blue pigment to his face, his arms and his upper torso in strange swirling
patterns that appeared to his rather incomplete observation to be a series of
mazes or labyrinths. After they had finished and the four of them stood around
him studying and commenting on their art work for a few minutes, the fifth
member of the original party appeared.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; He too was painted in complex
patterns although several colors made the labyrinths on his body appear to be
almost three-dimensional. As he moved, the shifting patterns seemed to blur and
move around creating a strange sense of seeing <i>through</i> him, but not to
what was on the other side of his body. The sense was that he had become a
window to another place or time and looking at him made Loden dizzy. The newly
arrived Warunga, clearly the leader of this band, carefully examined the blue
patterns on Loden’s body and seemed to find them acceptable. He uttered a
sharp word Loden immediately recognized as a command, turned and began to walk
slowly back to the camp. A wave of disorientation swept over Loden and he had to
struggle not to stagger. The others lined up on both sides of Loden, forming a
box with him in the middle. It took little effort for them to communicate to him
that he was expected to remain in that position as they walked.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Normally, if such a term could
be applied at all to what was happening around him then, he would have had to
force himself not to stare at the strangely painted creature ahead of him.
Averting his eyes was not a bit of trouble on that day, as looking at the leader
as he walked would have quickly rendered Loden unable to walk himself. Even
looking away, the patterns seemed to loom larger than the Warunga’s body and
to pull him into a depth so that he felt as if he were looking down from the top
of a high cliff. Finally, he found that by staring at the ground between him and
the leader, he could keep his wits about him.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; It was then he noticed the
silence. He looked around as they walked between the skin and wood structures
that in all the days past had been surrounded by men, women, children and dogs
in a mad chaos of life. It was as if every living being in the community had
disappeared from the earth. Even the sounds of the birds were absent. For the
first time since meeting the Warunga warriors on the rock, he felt fear. The
dizziness he had felt when he first looked at the back of their leader gave way
to a sense of “otherness” unlike anything he had felt before.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; He glanced at the four warriors
walking beside him and found that somehow they too had become painted with
strange shifting patterns. Unlike his or the leader’s bodies, their patterns
were composed of two colors, blue and green. Even the two colors seemed to shift
and flow, making their forms appear unsubstantial as if they were both <i>there</i>
and <i>not there</i> at the same time. He looked down at his own body and was
shocked to find that he too was covered with shifting variations of blue that
seemed to almost allow him to look <i>through </i>himself into a deep blue sky
or body of water. He almost fell as the disorientation swept over him and would
have collapsed to the ground if his companions had not reached out to steady
him. After that he made a point of not even glancing at his own form until long
after what followed.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; As they continued through the
village, he had a sense that the people, the dogs and the birds were still
there, but he simply could not see or hear them. For the first time he
understood the ability of the Warunga to penetrate even into the interior of a
guarded building and escape without detection. Sure, he could not see any living
thing, but he would be willing to bet no living thing, other than those who were
under the same spell as he, could see him either. He guessed that the blue lines
made him both invisible to and unable to see those who did not have any of the
colors at all, while the green lines allowed the warriors to see others while
not being seen themselves. That would explain why he was carefully kept in the
middle of the four companions, so he would not accidentally collide with one of
the people in the village. He could not help but think this ability to become
invisible was a very valuable thing. His respect for the Warunga moved up
several notches as he realized they could have slaughtered anyone they desired
any time they wanted among the humans.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Soon they were past the last of
the hide-covered huts in which the Warunga seemed to spend very little time
except for the very young or very old. The forest grew thicker here and then
suddenly ceased as they began to climb a slight hill. At the crest of the hill,
surrounded by a circle of short grass and rock about a bow’s shot across, was
a magnificent grove of huge live oaks. The trunks of even the outer trees were
as thick as a man is tall. They entered into the green semi-darkness of the
grove at a point where the grass had been worn down to a dirt trail and began to
wind about between the huge limbs and branches of the trees. As they penetrated,
the trees became bigger and bigger and the limbs began to be higher and higher
until, at the center of the grove, they walked into what almost appeared to be a
cathedral, with one huge tree in the center, whose gigantic branches started
about five man-heights above the ground They reached over to join the branches
of the inner circle of oaks in an almost perfectly symmetrical ceiling.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; On the far side of the circle
were about a hundred Warunga, seated with their backs to the inner circle of
trees and all facing the base of the trunk at the center. At least, he presumed
they were Warunga. Like the leader of his small group and his companions, it was
nearly impossible to focus on any one of them. Some were shifting patterns of
blue and green, like the warriors who walked beside him. They tended to be
towards the back of the group. Others were far more colorful, with the intensity
and variety of the colors increasing with nearness to the central tree. On the
side of the tree facing the seated observers, the trunk was slightly concave and
the surface of the ground seemed to have been raised by the roots of the mighty
tree. Two of the tree’s gigantic roots fanned out to either side of the raised
ground, creating something very much like a stage.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; He did not need his sense to
know that every being seated in the clearing, which he began to think of as a
temple, was focused on him intently. His sense <i>did</i> tell him that there
were watchers other than the ones he could see. Suddenly, he became aware that
someone or something else was focused on him. The feeling was so intense that
for a few moments he was almost blinded by the intensity of the feeling. At
first it was <i>very</i> confusing because the sense indicated that he was
surrounded by unseen beings observing him and that the one with the overwhelming
presence was also seeing him from several directions. Then, he realized what he
was sensing. The huge tree itself was aware of and quite interested in his
presence. Each of the other trees echoed that same interest, but with less
intensity. The confusing thing was that each of those beings was really only one
being, something he had never encountered before.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; They led him to the platform and
up into the concavity of the trunk. The four companions walked away, two to each
side until they were no longer between Loden and the assembly. The Leader, as he
had come to call the obviously senior member of the group he had met on the
rock, stood alone before him. It was then that he realized the Leader’s colors
were a match or better than any other being in the grove.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The leader turned his back to
the beings seated on the ground and faced the tree and Loden. He began to sing,
at least that is the best way to describe what he was doing for anyone who has
not witnessed it. His singing was more than voice as the colors that permeated
his being moved with the sound, shifting across the spectrum and growing with
each note until Loden could no longer see the assembly for the Leader’s
enlarging and brightening aura. Then he sensed the tree behind him beginning to
respond to the singing and he was engulfed in something he referred to from that
day as <i>Treesong</i>. Within moments he lost all sense of being in the
physical world and was being pushed and pulled through a universe unlike any he
had every imagined or heard of from any wizard or priest. He knew the presence
of the Chisos, the great chief that dwelt in that grove of trees. He felt the
longing to be free and dance across the sky with the Tarcuna as well as the
great peace that comes from having roots that run under the earth from tree to
tree. He felt the sweetness of the rain-tears from the Tarcuna and the energy
from the sun. For him from that day, time changed, for to the Chisos, a hundred
turnings of the year is a short season and the coming of man and even the
Warunga is something that just happened in the last couple of days.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Loden became aware that the song
had changed and the whole assembly seemed to be joining in. Then he heard a new
voice that was very different from the others. It was deeper and had a different
quality. At first it did not seem to fit at all, but then all the others began
to change and take on some of the qualities of the voice. The he felt the voice
itself change and it too began to take on some of the hues of the other voices.
It was only then he realized, the voice was his. After what felt like a very
long time but in another way only a moment, the voices became one voice then
began to slowly die away. Loden became aware that he was again standing on the
platform at the base of the tree trunk in the grove. The colors of the Warunga
in front of him were shrinking and dulling back to what they had been before the
song began.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The Leader was standing to his
left front and had encased Loden’s left forearm in what appeared to be tree
bark. Loden found that his mind was in an almost dreamlike state and as a
result, the idea of having part of his body covered with tree bark was quite
acceptable. At that moment he was willing to accept just about anything. He felt
a harmony within him that made his prior existence seem like a crude drawing
when compared with the multidimensional reality he had just experienced. It was
then that Treetender spoke to him.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; His clear and authoritative
voice sounded much like the song he had just sung to Loden’s ears. The one
Loden had thought of as Leader said/sung, “I am Treetender and I welcome you
to the People and to the brotherhood of the Chisos.” It took Loden a moment to
realize that Treetender was speaking in the language he previously had not
understood. Now it seemed so simple and harmonious that his native language was
made to sound crude and harsh.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Treetender continued, “You are
Treefeeder-Who-Brings-Steel and you are the first of your kind to join our
brotherhood.”<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Loden answered, “Do you mean I
am the first of the…” At this point he hesitated and struggled between the
word he had called his people from childhood and the word that came to mind. He
chose the Warunga word and continued. “…blind-tree-killers to be admitted to
your brotherhood?”<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; “No, although that is true.”
Treetender answered. “You are the first to answer the call to feed the tree
who may also wield the sharpened steel blade. Among The People from the
beginning, the priesthood has been called to tend and feed the Chisos within the
trees but the Chisos have never called one who carries steel weapons dedicated
to the Chi before. There are two brotherhoods that are here assembled together
for the first time, the brotherhood of steel who are dedicated to Chi, the god
of creation and war, and the brotherhood of the Chisos, who are dedicated to
life and harmony. Each is part of The People as both life and death are part of
existence. You are the first to be called to both.”<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; “We have spoken and sung much
over the past days and weeks both among ourselves and with the Chisos who dwells
here. He, in turn has sung with the tree that grows from the rock near where you
dwell and called you to feed it. That tree is but a small branch of the great
grove that stands nearby. As with many of the Chisos, he does not allow us to
penetrate his grove, but allows us to feed the small tree where we met you. We
had arrived that day to give you one more chance to present yourself before us
for judgment and then, had you failed, to feed the Chisos with blood from one of
your animals before banishing you from The Land.”<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; “His brother, the Chisos that
dwells in the valley where others of your tribe have come, has been injured by
them and is only now healing from the last Tree-Killer who dwelt there. The
Chisos of the valley spoke to your heart and you heard him. The rock Chisos,
where we met you, doubted your heart but spoke to see if you would hear and
respond. Never before has the Chisos chosen to call one who had dedicated his
steel to Chi. The Chisos have long spoken of the joining of the two
brotherhoods, but neither they or we expected it to be one of your tribe who
would be the first to dwell in both lodges.”<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; “The Brotherhood of the Tree,
as we who serve the Chisos are called, has chosen to grant you the gift of
language and life. You are now alive with us and you sing our song. The
Brotherhood of the Rock, as are called those who have dedicated their steel to
Chi, has given you the steel rock for your arms. Under this tree bark, the
strength of the earth is being bound to your body. Within one moon the bark will
fall away and the steel stone will be part of you as you are part of us.”<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; “I am the leader of the
Brotherhood of the Tree in this part of The Land. The Brotherhood of the Rock,
who has no permanent leader but choose their leader for each battle, is
represented by the Four who have stood both with you and witness to your
worthiness. Had you abandoned us to return to your people during the time of
testing, they would have been put to death by their brothers.”<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; “Know too, that the Tree
commands the Rock, for the Rock exits to support and nourish the Tree. Your role
in The People is unknown to any of us. Chi and the Chisos must be the ones to
determine your path and we are but their servants.”<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; While he lived with the Warunga,
he learned the Chisos had not always been spirits that slept within the great
oak groves. In a distant past, when great creatures, more terrible and wonderful
than any man had ever, seen roamed the earth, the Chisos were the rulers of all
that was beneath the sky, and according to the legend, much that lay beyond it.
Treetender had taken him far to the west to the stones that told the tale of the
ancient ones. He had sat with Loden for long hours as they first sang to the
stones and then, to Loden’s amazement the stones began to sing back in the
same language he had first heard from the tree. The stones sang that the Chisos
had walked the earth for far more years than Loden could understand. They sang
of a people that had much knowledge and much power. They had learned the secrets
of life and death and had used them to extend their lives indefinitely. They had
learned the secrets of the very rocks and could somehow extract things from the
stones themselves that could convey images from one place to another in an
instant. At first Loden had trouble believing it, but the ancient ones seemed to
have iron in abundance that they dug from great pits in the ground. They used
steel as if it were clay or wood. He finally understood that they had somehow
used it up!<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Later they used the very sand to
make magic that neither Loden or Treetender had any understanding of. That very
magic was what was allowing them to listen to what he now knew to actually be a
voice of one of the ancient ones. Only after some time had passed did he realize
that the voice he was hearing from the stones was actually the same voice he had
heard from the tree. Thousands of years ago the spirit that now dwelt in a grove
of oak trees had been one of those he had come to think of as gods, with powers
beyond those of the greatest wizards of his people.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The stones went on to tell that
the Chisos had split into three groups. One wanted to continue to extract power
and new items directly from the rocks and from space itself. The other wanted to
use the knowledge and power they had to nourish the life that was on the earth.
At first they went their separate ways in peace with one group reshaping the
very earth to their desires and the other attempting to reestablish a balance of
life as it was before the Chisos began to extract the vital minerals from the
soil and the rocks. As time went by the two groups began to be more and more
hostile to each other.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; After years of increasing
hostility between the two groups, a third group appeared with members that had
originally been in both groups. The new group advocated using the magic and
knowledge the Chisos had gained to join the things of the earth with the things
of power to unite the good of nature with the blessings they had obtained from
the magic. Sadly only a few of the Chisos chose the third way. Those that did
learned to become one with the very nature the second group claimed to be trying
to defend.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Finally, the group who claimed
to defend the earth itself declared war on those who still sought to use it. The
war was lost before it began. The wizards who had been using the earth had
powers far beyond the understanding of those who wanted to simply turn back
history to what they claimed was a simpler time. The victory destroyed not only
the losers but the winners as well. The forces unleashed by the wizards tore
open the earth and blackened the sky.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The war ended as a gigantic ball
of ice and rock smashed into the sea near where the Nature Wizards had their
capital. Walls of water and great winds tore the very plants from the ground.
Volcanoes roared from the ground where none had been before and the very earth
split open, creating oceans where land had stood.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The Chisos of the Third Way had
stood apart from the war and sought ways to preserve some of what they had
learned as well as some of all manner of life that they could. They retreated
underground to wait for the end of the violence. After the destruction of the
forces that sought to turn back history, they emerged from their shelters deep
under the land only to find that the Users of the Earth had gone mad in their
quest for power. They had declared themselves the creators and destroyers of
creation. They had raised up for themselves a great fortress pulled from the
very roots of the earth. In it they had hidden away their implements of power
and created a paradise where they believed they could hide themselves away from
the destruction they had rained upon the earth.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; They did not plan though for
what happened next. The faction that had wanted to reverse history had prepared
a surprise for the Chisos in the event they lost the war. They had released a
disease that would kill every Chisos and every Tarcuna. Despite feverish work to
find a cure, the nature wizards had created an infection so deadly that none of
the survivors of the cataclysm could find any way to fight it.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The wonders they created and
extracted from the ground and the sky had long been long worn to dust or
extinguished by volcano, or flood, or wind, but a few things remained of their
arrogance. The skeleton of the place the Earth Users created still survived.
They had built it as a paradise and a fortress to protect themselves and their
creations, but it survived only as a broken, shattered landscape, bearing
witness to the end of the works of mortals who dared to challenge their Creator.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The few Chisos to survive the
disaster were those who had learned to dwell outside of their own bodies. Soon
though, they realized that without physical bodies, they would begin to fade
away until they ceased to exist. The males, the Chisos, had chosen the oak trees
in which to dwell. The females, the Tarcuna, had chosen to dwell in the very air
with their spirits sweeping across the earth. When enough energy gathered in the
form of thunderclouds, the Tarcuna would assume the body of the cloud even as
the Chisos had assumed the body of the tree. The women were always drifting with
the wind to see one another and to dance in new places, continually changing
their billowy attire. The men were quite satisfied to remain where they were and
tend what was around them.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; According to Treetender, the
Chisos had told him that only the smallest of animals, those that could live in
burrows under the ground, survived the war of the Chisos. Afterward, it took so
long that the numbers of years were meaningless, for life to return in the
profusion that had existed before the cataclysms. When life did return, it was
in a form very different than that the Chisos had known before. After many, many
more thousands of years, there appeared those who would later be called The
People. Later came humans and then the orcs. Treetender told him that there
existed in other places, other intelligent beings, some who dwelt in the earth
itself and others who dwelt in the trees and were closely related to the
Warunga.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; He went on to warn Loden that
the Chisos had called them to guard the way to the mountain fortress in which
the Chisos Earthusers had once dwelt. Apparently some of them and even some of
the Nature Wizards had not been killed. Some of the Earthusers had transferred
their existence to stones not unlike the ones that had sung to them. Among the
Nature Wizards, it was not as clear what they had become. The Chisos of the
Trees did know that the orcs were not natural but had been perverted from other
beings, perhaps even humans. The Nature Wizards that survived had done so by the
force of their hatred for all intelligent life. They believed that all thinking
beings were an infection on the face of the earth and existed to cleanse the
earth of them. The Chisos of the Trees believed the Nature Wizards had gone mad
in their hatred and guilt. They refused to accept that the war they started
against the Earthusers was the cause of the destruction of all they claimed they
wanted to save.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Both the surviving Earthusers
and the Nature Wizards wanted access to the secrets of the Chisos hidden away in
the ruins. The Earthusers longed to find a way to take back some form that would
allow them to move about and reestablish their rule of the earth and all in it
for their own pleasure. The Earth Wizards wanted to capture the weapons and
secrets so that they could destroy the life that existed today in order to
restore the life that had existed when they walked on the earth. Each wanted to
return to what they had before the war, but alone and in control of the earth.
For them the war was not over and they dwelt in their hatred of all who
disagreed with them.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; It made Loden more than a little
uncomfortable to learn that two such groups of powerful spirits existed, one
desiring to enslave all who lived to serve them and the other to destroy them.
But Treetender had yet one more warning for Loden.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Apparently some of the Chisos of
the Trees had also lost their sanity. In the many thousands of years they had
dwelt away from their original bodies, some of them had come to desire to live
in a mobile body again. Some rose up to dance with the Tarcuna, and in their
madness spread destruction everywhere they put their feet. Once they had don so,
they would die, unable to find a tree in which to dwell after destroying so many
trees in their dance. Others were what Treetender referred to as “grouchy.”
They had forgotten why they existed and would strike out at any intelligent
creature that ventured into their presence. Sometimes they would even take over
the body of the person as if it were a puppet and cause a destructive madness
that almost always required the death of the person.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; He returned to his people and
over the years to come, established a prosperous holding and a family to make
any man proud. His sons learned to walk with the Warunga but never were called
to either of the brotherhoods. They did become accomplished warriors among the
humans and were much sought after as officers and leaders when there were
battles to be fought. Each year he would return with a calf to the tree in the
rock and make the sacrifice to the Chisos. Each time he would hear the Chisos
sing his thanks and bid him well.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; He carefully protected the trees
in the valley where he held his land. He taught the people that lived on the
frontier what he knew about how to not offend the Warunga. For many years the
community of humans and the Warunga of the White Hills, as they were known among
the greater Warunga, lived in peace and as much harmony as such different people
could.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Other than his ability to
understand the Warunga, which was certainly no small gift, he had the shields on
his forearms that, thanks to the current style of wearing long sleeves, were not
too much noticed. Prior to the beginning of the Great Orc War, his ability to
hear the Chisos sing was the gift he most appreciated. Many were the times he
would be traveling in the forests when he would sense the presence of one of the
ancient ones. He enjoyed turning aside to sing to the tree. The tree, in turn
would give him a grant of peace and strength. Later, during the orc war, he
gained a reputation of being able to know where the orcs were before anyone
else. He knew that no one would understand, so he did not reveal that there were
spirits in the great oaks even in the eastern lands. He found that he could ask
one tree spirit and the word would spread across the land. As much as the tree
spirits did not like the humans, they hated the orcs. The orcs would fell trees
simply for the sport of seeing them fall. Some of them could hear the tree
sprits and seemed to greatly enjoy hearing them suffer as their ancient home was
destroyed.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; So it all might have ended had
not the orcs been determined to find and use the secrets that were hidden in the
Chisos Mountains far to the west beyond the hills of the Warunga, beyond the
high plains, and beyond the Killing Desert.
<h3>Chapter 3</h3>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The sun was growing hot on his
back as Loden climbed yet another of the low ridges between the innumerable
draws that drained into the valley to his left. At the top he stopped his horse,
and benefiting from the additional height of being horseback, was able to see
the terrain to the west that he would have to cross on his present course.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; He was about half way up the
ridge that ran east and west on the north side of the valley. The ridge was
wrinkled with washes, draws and ridges where the sparse rain had washed the
soft, chalky rock down to the valley on his left. That was exactly why he was
using it. No traveler in his right mind would take such a rough and difficult
route when he could either follow the bottom of the valley and have relatively
even ground and water to boot, or, if he wanted to be less likely to encounter
others, the ridge top where there would be no water but the traveling would at
least be on fairly even ground. The other side of that coin was that anyone
wanting to set an ambush or look for tracks would also make the same choice.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Even those who had lived in the
wilds for most of their lives often did not realize that there was almost always
a trail running part way down a ridge or hillside and parallel to it. Those who
could defend themselves traveled high or low, but the deer and anyone who did
not want to be noticed traveled between the two.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Not that he was being hunted at
the moment, or at least he hope he wasn’t, but he was quite sure he would be
if the Warunga knew he was here. Brother to the White Rock Warunga he might be,
but he had already passed through the lands of the Red Rock branch of The People
and now was in the lands held by yet another branch. He had never met any of
this tribe but he knew they were called the People of the Cave.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; At the moment he faced the
problem that the stream on his left forked ahead of him. The main branch split
to the right where it had long ago cut through the ridge on which he had been
traveling. The left fork continued straight ahead up the valley but looked as if
it were little more than an extended draw with little or no water. This meant he
either needed to cross the ridge to the right and cross the valley beyond or
continue straight ahead and cross the stream. He knew that the main trail that
passed through this area followed the next valley to the north and he strongly
suspected that by crossing the ridge he would be visible from it and soon have
to cross it. Going straight ahead presented the problem of crossing the stream
without leaving a trail clear enough for a blind man to follow.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; As is often the case in dry
country, the need of both the man and the horses for water decided the issue. By
electing to cross the stream and continue to the west he would have the
opportunity to both drink and fill the water skins that now hung limply on the
sides of his packhorse. He knew better than to proceed straight ahead as that
would also be the place where someone following the stream valley would cross.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Just ahead of him was one of the
many draws leading off the ridge downward to the south. This one was
considerably wider and deeper than most of the others and, more importantly,
continued as a tree line all the way to the stream. He eased his horse slowly
down to near the bottom of the draw and saw what he was looking for, a game
trail following the ravine about a third of the way from the bottom.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Suddenly his horse jumped under
him as a herd of about ten deer came rushing down the ravine, rattling the
bushes, knocking rocks to the bottom and stirring up a cloud of dust. Loden
froze and mentally commanded his horses to do the same. At almost the same
instant, Shanna, the great wolf-dog that was his spirit partner, flashed an
image of running deer. For a moment Loden was confused and then he realized that
Shanna was two ravines to the west and seeing another herd of deer rushing in
the same direction. All he sensed from the deer was fear of something totally
unknown.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; He commanded Shanna to work her
way toward the top of the ridge and attempt to find what was causing the deer to
panic. Unfortunately, the wind was from the south so neither he nor Shanna were
able to get any sent from the direction the deer had come. Meanwhile, Loden saw
an opportunity to take advantage of the situation. He urged his horses forward;
following the path the deer had so recently taken. He reasoned that any watcher
with any degree of skill would be focused in the direction he had sent Shanna
and not likely to be watching as numerous herds of deer stampeded across the
valley. An additional virtue of this course of action would be that it would put
more distance between him and whatever was scaring the deer.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; In a few moments, Shanna
reported there were more deer and some antelope behind him in the ravine. He
urged more speed out of his horses and crouched down over the saddle to avoid
being scraped off his horse’s back by low hanging limbs. Soon the ground
leveled off and he was out of the ravine with his horses running along between
two thick lines of trees to either side of the dry stream bed. A moment later he
was to the stream and heard the deer in front of him splashing their way across.
The draw came out at a place where the stream spread out and ran across a wide
rock shelf. The horses splashed down onto the shelf and started across. As they
neared the other side, Loden pulled them to the right and headed them up stream.
He figured that one of the possible reasons the deer were all running in the
same direction so close together was that they were being driven to some sort of
ambush. Since the upstream direction turned back toward the same general area
they seemed to have come from, it was unlikely that any drivers of game would
expect anything or anyone to turn in that direction. It was also likely that the
water would cover any sent the horses left and help hide their tracks.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; He worked his way upstream for
about two hundred paces then urged his horses out on the opposite side from
which he entered. Up on the bank, he stopped the horses in a thick grove of
trees and dismounted. Shanna was still working her way carefully downwind across
the ridge. She was very nervous and that emotion transferred itself to Loden. He
commanded her to find a place to hide and wait for whatever was coming. He
grabbed the water skins off the packhorse and ran to the stream to fill them. In
just a few, but very tense, minutes, he had them filled and back on the
packhorse. He made one last trip down the bank to fill his water skin. He bent
over and slipped his water skin under the water, then pulled it up and tightened
the thong that held it shut. Just as he was standing up, a huge buck burst out
of the tree line on the other side of the stream and made a mad lunge across the
water. Loden jumped to the side to avoid being run down.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; As the buck reached the bank
were Loden had been standing his legs suddenly collapsed under him and he
smashed into the bank, kicked a couple of times, then lay still except for his
heaving chest. A bloody froth foamed from his nose and mouth as he gasped for
air. After less than a minute even the heaving chest was still. Loden’s first
impulse was to flee from the scene before the hunters who were surely following
this magnificent animal could come upon the scene. His desire to know who was
causing this great disturbance overcame his caution. He cautiously approached
the fallen buck. Sticking out of the side of his chest was the broken shaft of
an arrow. As he drew closer a cold chill settled over Loden’s heart. The arrow
was black. He moved to the side of the deer, pulled out his knife, and in a
moment had extracted the arrowhead from the chest. The jagged edges of the point
confirmed his worst suspicions. Orcs!<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; He quickly moved to his horses,
mounted and headed upstream on the left side. From what he had seen of the buck,
the Orcs were probably in the valley on the north side of the ridge on which he
had been traveling until a few minutes before. He sent a mental warning to
Shanna. He knew some orcs had been bred to have a sense of smell nearly as sharp
as Shanna’s. If one smelled her or him, there was little chance the orcs would
not come after them and once they were on the track, there was even less chance
they would turn aside until either hunter or prey were dead. He called Shanna
back from the ridge and told her to come to the stream and turn right in the
water. That well could throw any followers off long enough for him to put some
well needed distance between him and the brutes.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Hidden from the ridge to his
right by the trees that grew along the stream bank, he followed the stream
towards the northwest as it approached the water gap in the ridge ahead. He
could see that the tree line came within a few paces of the wooded hillside just
before entering the water gap. At that point he would have an opportunity to
leave the stream, hopefully without exposing himself to observation from the
ridge to the northeast.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; He felt Shanna enter the water
at about the same time he turned the horses into the underbrush and up the slope
to his left. He quickly found a ravine bottom to follow that would keep him and
the horses out of sight. As the hillside steepened and the ravine shallowed, he
dismounted and began to lead his horses up the hill. A short distance from the
top he dropped the reigns and slowly eased his way up to the crest, being
careful to not outline himself. By this time the sun was at its highest and only
slightly south of directly overhead. As his heart began to slow back to
something like a normal pace he became aware of the heat. Sweat dribbled down
his face as he crawled along under the bushes, trying to avoid the thorns,
sometimes not too successfully.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; As he reached the crest, he had
to negotiate a cluster of rocks that capped the hills. Carefully looking where
he put his hands and feet lest he surprise a snake, centipede, or scorpion
hiding from the midday sun, he extended his head up and looked out between two
rocks. He had a good view of the valley from where the stream turned through the
ridge on which he was hiding both up and down the valley for quite some
distance.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The first thing he saw were the
death birds circling and swarming over the other side of the valley. On the
ground beneath them were a number of black dots. Several were smaller in size
while the majority were larger. From the way they were laid out it appeared to
him that there had been a battle, probably the day before from the number of
birds that had gathered.</TD></TR></TABLE></CENTER>
