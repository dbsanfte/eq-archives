&nbsp; &nbsp; Welcome, and be of good heart ye who wish to join with the Siol Lear to
reclaim our ancient home. We battle with the dark forces that have spawned in Midgard
to grow strong and defeat our ancient enemy in Albion and their foul allies in Hibernia
to reclaim our lost home in the Highlands.
<BR>

<CENTER>But:</CENTER>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Be ye warned hereby that if ye be of those who do not wish to join with us
in the spirit and times of Midgard or bring with ye lies, deceit, division, selfishness
or any other foul spirit, go no further. We are of those who call themselves honorable
and whose characters remain in the spirit of Midgard in the Lost Age of Camelot. Should
ye be one of those who call of themselves eL1T3 d00dz or any other of the followers of The
Twisted one, we will turn upon you and you shall be from us outcast forever for we shall
appeal to the gods and ask them to remove you from Percival and from the memory of all
those who &quot;play the role.&quot;
