     <TD CLASS="block"><DIV CLASS="tales">&nbsp; &nbsp; The axe rose and fell breaking through chain and sinking into
     vile flesh of the enemy Keep Lord. Bledmere was ours once again and cheer went up through the Lear army. Laird
     Loden strode up the parapet above the gates and raised the banner of the Siol Lear to proclaim to all that this
     was our faste! Again the war cry rang out, “For Lear! For Midgard!”<BR>
     <BR>
     &nbsp; &nbsp; Much merriment was had that night amongst the gathered Lears, and as would be regretted later,
     much ale and mead too. The dwarf Krakadoom had join the Lear in battle that day but having had a few ales too
     many got into a bragging match with the kobold know as Sitra. The two were talking about what master craftsmen
     they were and how they could build anything. Staggering up to the two and gesturing wildly in the general
     direction of the faste’s merchants Gelain challenged, “Rather than talkin’, why do ye nae build us somethin’
     marvellous!” and then promptly fell over flat on his back while the stars spun wildly around him. The others
     all laughed and pointed saying, “Verrily so! Now meet the challenge or shut up!”<BR>
     <BR>
     &nbsp; &nbsp; The drunken dwarf and sloshed kobold then staggered off to the merchants and begun their building.
     As the night wore on it became obvious that they were both building a long boat each, although due to lack of
     room they were building them with a flat rear resting on the group and the front pointin’ to the sky. The Lears
     would often wander over to check the progress, offer a fresh cup to the builders, and occasionally lend a well
     meant but often misplaced hand.<BR>
     <BR>
     &nbsp; &nbsp; At some stage after the moon had reached its peak the vessels were almost finished when a drunken
     Vruul pointed out, “Har! They ha’e nailed each other’s boat to their own!” And so they had. What started out as
     two longboats was now one completely enclosed contraption. Scratching his head a little Kraka slurred, “Well at
     leasethet we nae get wet!” He then created a door and invited the Lear inside. “Now,” roared Gisli, “if there
     were only water here we could make a fine raid on those pansy elves!” At that point Pim quipped in, “I’ll jus`
     send a blast a runic fire ta send us to the ocean!” Thankfully the Lady Jalia was of somewhat sound mind and
     reminded us that we should pack more ale before leaving on the raid.<BR>
     <BR>
     &nbsp; &nbsp; With a jug of mead in one hand and his staff in the other Pim began the incantations to add power
     to his runes. A might blast of fire poured forth from the bottom of our round boat and into the air we flew. At
     this stage we all must have been extremely drunk for Tali grabbed the rudder saying, “I’ll steer” and no one
     seemed to mind.<BR>
     <BR>
     &nbsp; &nbsp; The sun shone extremely bright causing untold pain to the adventurous but very hung over Lears.
     All around them though was nought but air. Pim was slumped over his staff mumbling and somehow keeping the runic
     fire roaring while Tali was biting her nails saying, “umm, I think I’m lost.” Dhugal looked out the port hole
     and with his keen Hunter’s eyes (well not quite as keen due to the drink but a hell of a lot better than the
     rest of us) and spotted a large sandy coloured land mass. “Down there,” he directed Tali who promptly pointed
     the now flying boat in that direction. The land mass kept getting bigger and bigger until it first filled the
     entire view and then building became visable. Unfortunately no one thought to relieve Tali from the rudder,
     or really to wake up Pim, and we landed with a gentle thump that totally destroyed the boat. Luckily for us
     we had drunk all the alcohol the night before and not a drop was wasted.<BR>
     <BR>
     &nbsp; &nbsp; With the flying boat no more than timbers and the Lears sprawled all over the sand we took a look
     at this strange place. The buildings were strange and there were strange creatures roaming the streets of the
     city. Unusual streets they were too, for as far as the eye could see there was sand. It looked like the entire
     land was one large beach. Luckily a human walked by. “Greetings good man,” our Laird spoke, “we are somewhat
     lost and need directions. Could you tell us where” “We could find a tavern,” interrupted Gelain, much to the
     joy the only slightly sober Lear. “Sure,” said the man pointing to a building close by, “that is the Mos Eisly
     Cantenna.”
