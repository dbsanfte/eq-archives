<H2>The Twisted One, Or<BR>
The Erudites, Necromancy, and the rise and fall of Miragul</H2>
<FONT SIZE=2>As told by Aradune Mithara, sometimes historian, more often Ranger Lord, Outrider of Karana</FONT></CENTER>
&nbsp; <IMG SRC="images/lettero.gif" width="30" height="30"> ver three thousand years in the past humanity was in its infancy. Mankind
dwelled in the center of Antonica, spreading out slowly to inhabit the vast
and fertile plains of Karana. Villages appeared and prospered, several reaching
the size of towns, and two even became cities -- Qeynos to the west, and
Freeport to the east. Humanity, much to the disdain of the elder races who
watched from afar, was strong -- it rapidly gained a solid foothold in the
world of Norrath and was there to stay. 
<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; <IMG SRC="images/lettert.gif" width="30" height="30"> his is not to imply, however, that humanity was at peace. Early on small groups
formed, some linked by similar appearances, others by common goals. Competition
was fierce, and when resources grew scarce for one reason or another many groups
abandoned the promises and alliances of their past and fought. A few leaders
spoke out against the violence, urging the masses to remember why they had fled
the cold north. They had broken away from the lands of Halas and their
barbarian brothers in the name of peace, and these leaders insisted that humanity
adhere once again to those principals to which all had agreed. 
<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; <IMG SRC="images/lettert.gif" width="30" height="30"> heir cry was not totally ignored, and the fighting subsided. Villages were
encouraged to trade with one another and to respond to competition nonviolently.
An economy based largely on agriculture appeared and the villages and small
towns were surrounded by large farms. Most of humanity’s leaders were pleased
with this, wanting nothing more than peace and food on every man’s table after
a hard day of work. A few, however, wanted more. Even though their people had
risen well beyond the standard of living endured by their barbarian brothers
to the north, they were not content. Explorers and adventurers returned from
afar with tales of elves, dwarves, and other strange creatures, as well as
descriptions of ancient abandoned cities. A few even came back with limited
knowledge of sorcery and the mystic arts. And when that discontent minority
of leaders heard all of this, they became both jealous and determined. 
<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; <IMG SRC="images/lettera.gif" width="30" height="30"> &nbsp;small, fragile man of great intellect called Erud led this group, and he
formed them into a council. They quickly became irritated, even disgusted,
by their fellow man. Leaving a small network of spies behind, the remainder
of Erud’s followers fled the city of Qeynos and boarded a small fleet of ships.
They sailed to the west and landed upon the barren coast of the island of Odus.
The land was sparse and uninhabited and quite appealing to the council and
their people. They quickly built a city of their own, dissimilar in almost
every way to both Qeynos and Freeport, for it was almost entirely a towering
castle. Erudin it was called, and within it the scribes and scholars, who
called themselves High Men, gathered and analyzed reports, captured books
and scrolls, and other artifacts brought to them by their spies. The first
human mages were then born – wizards, sorcerers, and enchanters occupied the
great halls of Erudin and grew immensely in both power and knowledge. 
<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; <IMG SRC="images/lettero.gif" width="30" height="30"> ne of the more adept practitioners of the arts was named Miragul. Unlike and
more extreme than the others, he not only abhorred his human brothers on the
mainland to the east, but he also grew to hate his fellow Erudites. To him they
were both short sighted and narrow. They created schools of thought,
categorizing magic into three groups and assigning themselves to three classes:
Wizards, Sorcerers, and Enchanters. Miragul found this limiting and thoroughly
resented the thought of being restricted to one school of thought or another. 
<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; <IMG SRC="images/letterh.gif" width="30" height="30"> e soon found others who felt similarly. They were a small but growing group of
outcasts who often studied forbidden texts and other knowledge generally kept
secret from the majority of students. The council was morally and ethically
opposed to much of the information gathered afar by their spies. Miragul found
that these outcasts not only studied the three schools of magic, but also a
fourth. It was called Necromancy and a few lucky spies had returned from a
distant underground city (Neriak, it was called, home of the dark elves) with
both their lives and also ancient texts describing this art. Miragul was
intrigued, and, by using powerful magic, created for himself four identities,
four separate countenances and names, and joined all four schools without the
knowledge of the council, nor anyone else for that matter. 
<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; <IMG SRC="images/letteri.gif" width="30" height="30"> t came to pass some years later that the council, in its ever growing desire
to know all there was to know, both in distant lands and also in its own city,
discovered the group of Necromancers. They were branded heretics and great
conflict arose. For the first time in several hundred years, the Erudites fought.
They engaged in a civil war not entirely dissimilar to that which they had loathed
and fled from back on the mainland. But there was one very significant difference
– they did not use swords and bows, but rather magic, and the result was terrible.
Lives by the hundreds were lost, great buildings and structures destroyed, and
eventually the heretics were forced to flee Erudin, to hide and regroup in the
southern regions of Odus. 
<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; <IMG SRC="images/letterm.gif" width="30" height="30"> iragul, being a member of all four schools, was not blind to the implications
when the conflict began. He left the heretics before they fled the city, abandoning
his fourth identity and siding apparently with the council. But this was only a
ruse in order to buy time. He soon gathered every artifact and tome he could
discreetly steal and then left Odus entirely, taking a ship back to Antonica
and to the city of Qeynos. The lands of men, however, were not only to his
dislike, but also filled with Erudite spies. Miragul grew afraid, even paranoid,
and soon fled again. He headed far to the north and then to the east, wishing
to avoid the barbarians of Halas. After many weeks he found himself near the
great lake called Winter’s Deep and he hid there for some time. 
<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; <IMG SRC="images/letterw.gif" width="30" height="30"> hile Miragul waited in secret his mind was not idle. He schemed and planned,
and looked over every letter of every scroll and tome he had taken from Erudin.
Time passed and his understanding and power grew. But he was unsatisfied and a
deep hunger for even more arcane knowledge ate away at him. He soon left his
hiding place and began to travel long distances in search of more ancient texts
and artifacts. His power had grown and confidence overcame his fear of Erudite
spies. Once again he cloaked himself in false identity and countenance and
traveled the lands of men. 
<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; <IMG SRC="images/lettern.gif" width="30" height="30"> ot far to the south of where his cache of artifacts lay, Miragul soon found
another of the new races, the Halflings, and their town Rivervale. The mage
feared these small people and their propensity to sneak and to steal, and as
his treasures grew in both size and value, he eventually made the decision
to move even farther north, and away from all intelligent life. He traveled
leagues and leagues, far beyond the range of both Erudite spy and curious
Halfling, and eventually came to a vast tundra. This land had no name, and
was not until centuries later referred to as merely the Frigid Plain. This
frosty and remote environment appealed to Miragul’s heart, for it had grown
cold, obsessed with only knowledge and the abstract, and filled with only
hatred for others. Creatures with intelligence forced him to be discreet and
slowed his acquisition of knowledge and items. He had as little to do with 
them as he could, only hiding amongst them when absolutely necessary. 
<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; <IMG SRC="images/letteru.gif" width="30" height="30"> nder the icy ground of the Frigid Plains, Miragul created a large network of
tunnels and rooms in which to hide and study his collection. He used no labor,
but rather deep magic to remove the earth from his way. Room after room,
passage after passage, he did create to house his store of artifacts. He split
his years, spending one score out in the world, exploring and amassing knowledge
and items, returning them to his cache, and then the next dabbling with them,
experimenting in one of several laboratories he had created. 
<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; <IMG SRC="images/letterm.gif" width="30" height="30"> any years passed, even centuries. Miragul grew old, even though he did his best
to extend his life using magical means. There was a limit to his enlightenment
when it came to aging, and he soon acknowledged that one day even he would die.
Only one aspect of death did he fear, and being no longer able to learn and collect
wrought him with terror. As his skin grew wrinkled, and his breath short, Miragul’s
time was spent less exploring the world of Norrath and more studying the existential.
He soon discovered the various hidden dimensions that neighbored his own, the
Planes of Power and Discord. He discovered means by which he could traverse these
planes, making portals that led between them. But his strength was leaving him,
and his journeys into these realities were short and often unprofitable. More and
more, his own mortality limited his reason for living, and the specter of death
haunted him daily. 
<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; <IMG SRC="images/lettert.gif" width="30" height="30"> he mage’s research into life and death was built upon a foundation he had learned
from his fellow outcasts centuries before in Erudin. Necromancy, more than any
other art, became Miragul’s obsession. Eventually he discovered a means by which 
to create portals within his own plane and made them to travel great distances in
mere seconds. He traveled back to Odus, to its southern regions, in search of the
other Necromancers. Perhaps, he mused, they had unearthed by now a way to cheat
death. 
<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; <IMG SRC="images/lettert.gif" width="30" height="30"> he mage soon found that the heretics of Erudin had built a city into a great hole 
that led to unknown depths beneath the earth. This chasm was apparently the result 
of that huge civil war from which Miragul had fled centuries earlier. The city, 
called Paineel, though somewhat suspicious, allowed Miragul to enter and after a 
time he earned its inhabitant’s trust. Many humored the old man and his claims, 
while a select few respected him and were willing to trade knowledge for knowledge, 
power for power. They revealed to him the true power of necromancy, the ability to 
raise the dead, creating zombies and wraiths obedient in every way to their master. 
Many of the heretics planned to assault Erudin with vast armies of undead, to wreak 
revenge upon the council that had exiled and made war upon them in centuries past. 
<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; <IMG SRC="images/lettero.gif" width="30" height="30"> ne important aspect of their necromancy interested Miragul, the fact that the undead 
ceased to age. Their lives appeared endless and the elderly mage knew that he must 
discover a way to be like them. He feigned interest in the heretic’s goals, learning 
spells to raise the dead, helping them raise their undead army. All the while, 
however, he was experimenting himself, hiding much of his research in the small home 
he was given in Paineel. After some time he discovered that which he had sought, a 
way to transform a living being, as opposed to a corpse, into the undead. 
Unfortunately, time was scarce, for he was tired and almost dead himself, his body 
deteriorating with age, and the heretics were almost ready to make war once again. 
<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; <IMG SRC="images/letterm.gif" width="30" height="30"> iragul then left Paineel, using a small portion of his dwindling life energies to 
make a portal back to his cache hundreds of leagues to the north. Upon arrival, he 
withdrew silently to his most secret laboratory and prepared his final spell. 
Dreaming all the while of endless exploration and discovery, he slowly made ready 
his ultimate experiment. The enchantment laced with necromancy was finally made, and 
Miragul hid his remaining and fragile life within the phylactery, a small device he 
had pilfered from the other necromancers. Clouds of mystical energy gathered and then 
dispersed, revealing a shell of the man Miragul once was, an undead mage, what 
ancient scripts and legends called a lich. 
<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; <IMG SRC="images/letteri.gif" width="30" height="30"> n his haste, however, Miragul had made a miscalculation. The lich, while retaining 
all the mystical power of his formal self, lacked a spirit. Only the mage’s soul, 
now locked within the phylactery hidden deep in the cache, retained the ambition and 
desire to amass knowledge and power. The spiritless lich possessed none of these human 
traits, and Miragul’s soul screamed in silence as the undead creature began to 
aimlessly wander his menagerie of wisdom and enlightenment, his rooms filled with 
artifacts of power.
