    <td>Agravaine MacLear is my name and I am a Cleric of the God Brell Serilis.
      However, this was not always the case.<br>
      <br>
      In my youth, I was trained as a warrior by my father Adarin Drendaiin and
      his brother Garanel Drendaiin. I spent many a day practicing with my
      wooden sword and shield to become a great warrior like my father had been.
      My father and uncle were the two great warriors of Kaladim, as my
      grandfather Kornic Drendaiin had been before them. They were seated on the
      war council of Kaladim and sat to the left and right of our King. Any time
      a battle was waged, they were at the front lines, killing the enemy in
      droves and leading the troops to victory. To my knowledge, they had never
      lost a battle. This was my dream, to become like they were. I too wished
      to be a noble warrior and lead my men to glorious victory. My future was
      already planned, and it was wonderful. Then one day, a wounded elf was
      found by one of our guards and returned to the city.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br>
      The best clerics in Kaladim were helpless to heal this poor elf. His fate
      had been sealed by some dark magics, magics that they had never
      encountered before. All they could do was to ease his pain before he died.
      I was out practicing swordsmanship with my cousin while all of this was
      taking place, but after the events that followed, I demanded to know the
      truth of what the elf said before he died. This is what my mother told me.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br>
      This elf was one of three elven scouts that had been sent to a mansion by
      the lake in the mountains. A family of elven nobility lived in the
      mansion, and the city of Kelethin had not heard any word from them for
      over a month. The family had great business dealings in Kelethin, and so
      it was very unusual to go a day without hearing from them, let alone a
      month. The Kelethin Council was becoming worried by the silence of these
      nobles, and so had sent three scouts to go to the mansion and see what was
      amiss.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br>
      The elves passed through the mountains without incident. The goblins had
      been soundly defeated only a week before, and were in hiding. As the
      scouts neared the lake, however, they noticed that the trees began to look
      sickly. At the lakeshore, all the trees had died, and all the animals had
      fled the area. The few animals that remained were diseased and mad with
      plague. The scouts had to fend off many a serpent and rat as they
      approached the mansion. The air grew thick and cold, and stank like a
      closet that hasn’t been opened in many months. When the mansion was in
      sight, a skeleton arose out of the lake and attacked the scouts. If not
      for the sharp eyes and keen ears of one of the scouts, the three would
      have been taken by surprise and surely slain. As the skeleton fell to the
      ground, the scouts noticed that the musky smell was coming from the
      scattered bones. Taking this to be an ill omen, the three hurried to the
      mansion.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br>
      What they beheld as they walked through the gates was too terrible that
      the elf was unable to speak of it himself. He just shook his head and
      mumbled over and over, “Dead. All Dead.” Our clerics then drugged the
      elf, so that he could sleep and save his strength. The elf had troubled
      dreams though, and he spoke in his sleep. The things he spoke of were so
      frightful, that the nurse who was with him was taken with fear and ran
      from the room screaming. The elf told of hoards of undead beings. Corpses
      that rose from the earth and began to move around. Humans and elves alike
      with no flesh walking about and preparing for battle. Victims of plague
      calling out in agony as they died. Little is known about what happened
      next, for the elf began to panic and scream in his sleep; and shortly
      thereafter, he died.<br>
      <br>
      Our clerics think one of the beasts saw the three scouts and attacked
      them. It slew two of them on the spot, and pursued the third into the
      mountains where our guards found him lying in a field.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br>
      When we reported all of this to the Kelethin Council, they grew very grim
      indeed. They were currently engaged in a great battle with a band of orcs
      led by Emperor Crush. They had no forces to spare and could offer little
      in the manner of advise about the mansion. They only knew that the nobles
      there were very wealthy and had dozens of servants and their families
      living on the grounds. With Crush battling against the elves, they could
      be of no help to us. Our King called his war council together to decide
      what to do about the evil that had grown on the shores of our nation. Like
      true warriors, my father and uncle suggested that we attack the mansion
      before they had finished preparations for war. If we struck first, we
      would surely have the upper hand and defeat the evil that had taken hold
      of that once fine mansion.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br>
      Preparations for battle were made in Kaladim. The militia was called
      together and armed. It was a grand sight to see so many brave warriors
      adorned in steel and wielding sword and hammer. Clerics were sent as well,
      so as to heal and guard our warriors during the battle. My father came to
      me the night before he departed to tell me that he was going to another
      battle; and that he would be home by sundown the next eve. The following
      morn, I was glowing.<br>
      <br>
      Here was my father and uncle leading a parade of armored warriors and
      clerics into a battle that they would surely win. As they left the gates
      of Kaladim, I ran into my house and took up my sword and shield. I was
      eager to practice my skills so that one day, I could lead the parade out
      of town. I woke my cousin at his house and we began to practice the skills
      of a warrior. I was only 14 years of age then. As the sun was at its
      height in the sky, we were safe inside the caves of Kaladim. I swung my
      sword at my cousin, and he blocked my blow with his shield as if he had
      known where it would land. He thrust at me, and…<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br>
      A brilliant flash of white stabbed at my eyes. I threw my hands over my
      eyes, but the light persisted as if it where within my very eyes. I could
      not block it out of my eyes or my mind. As quickly as it had come, it was
      gone, but I was no longer in Kaladim. I was no longer Agravaine either. I
      was ethereal. I was floating in the air above my father’s head as he
      marched to the mansion on the horizon. I turned to see the great host of
      dwarves that was following my father into battle, and my heart was filled
      with pride. Here were assembled all of Kaladim’s finest warriors and
      clerics. Their skills were unmatched by any other in the city. Any force
      that was foolish enough to meet them in battle deserved to be slaughtered
      for stupidity.<br>
      <br>
      As I watched my father march, the light flashed before my eyes again. Now
      I was hovering above something else. It was taller than a dwarf, but
      thinner than an elf. It was wearing chainmail and wielded a saber. It was
      not marching; it was hiding in a bush along the waters edge. I could not
      make out what it was, until it raised it’s head and looked up to where I
      should have been. As it looked up, I saw that it had no hair…no; it had
      no flesh at all! This was a skeleton hiding in ambush of our warriors! I
      shut my eyes in horror and the flash returned again. I was high above the
      lake, looking down upon the battle that was about to ensue. I could
      plainly see the column of dwarves coming along the shore. I could also see
      many shapes in the bushes and in the lake itself. There was also a much
      smaller column of warriors marching to meet my father. I knew that my
      father could not see the forces hiding in bush and water. I knew that he
      would assume that the small column was all that there was. I knew it, but
      I was helpless to do anything about it. I was doomed to watch what
      followed from my high vantage point.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br>
      The columns met at the far side of the lake. I could see that my father
      had marched right into the middle of the trap the evil beings had set. As
      my father shouted the battle cry that would begin the fight, the hidden
      shapes in the bushes and water sprung to the attack. They attacked the
      dwarven army from the rear, where all the clerics were seated. The clerics
      were slaughtered as if they were nothing more than goblin whelps.<br>
      <br>
      The few that realized what was happening before it was too late jumped up
      and ran to the warriors for protection. Half of our warriors had already
      charged into battle with the undead army, the other half had to deal with
      the army that was now behind them. Our forces were split, and divided; we
      had not much hope of victory. When it looked as if we might win, great
      bats with claws and fangs began to swoop out of the sky and attack our
      battered warriors. My father and uncle, seeing that this was a lost
      battle, called for a retreat. Most of the remaining dwarven forces focused
      on the army to their rear and finally broke through it. My father and
      uncle were holding off the great host of undead as the remaining warriors
      fled into the mountains. There were only two clerics left, and one ran
      with the warriors, the other stayed with my family. As the last of the
      warriors ran away, the cleric cast a great spell. A purple wave spread
      from him, and the undead fled before it. Then my uncle and father turned
      and ran, the cleric followed suit. I watched them run, and sighed my
      relief that they had not fallen.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br>
      My sigh was immature, for as they ran, a final shape arose out of the
      water. This creature had once been a woman, I think. She had obviously
      been one of the first to die, and had died of plague. Her body was rotten
      and corroded. She had been twisted by some very powerful and evil magics.
      She began to move her hands about and I realized she was a spellwielder. I
      saw as she worked her hands, a ball of fire swell around her. At her
      command, the fire flew out over the lake and struck my uncle in the back.
      His platemail armor provided little protection from the heat, and his
      cloth shirt burst into flames. He roared in pain as the fire covered his
      body, and he began to run towards the water to put it out. Just then,
      roots grew up around his feet and held him on the shore, a mere foot from
      the cooling waters. As he fell over, the white flash returned.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br>
      I was now looking directly at the charred body of my uncle. I saw the
      undead hag float across the water to where the remains were. Then I saw a
      feat of magic that I have never seen again, and hope that I will never
      again witness in my life. Rather than just bend his body to her bidding,
      she captured his very soul and twisted it. His spirit rose out of his body
      and began to hover. It’s eyes then turned blood red and it took up my
      uncle’s arms and began to pursue my father and the cleric.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br>
      As another flash faded from my vision, I was looking at my fathers face.
      He was running for all his might, and I could see bruises and blood from
      where he had been struck with their weapons. I rose up to look over his
      head, and I saw the cleric running behind him. But the cleric was losing
      speed, for he had been wounded in the leg in the attack. Behind him, I saw
      the spirit of my uncle racing towards them. The cleric must have sensed
      the evil coming, for he stopped running and turned to face the ghost. He
      released the same purple wave that he had done before, but it had no
      effect on the evils that bound my uncle’s spirit. In desperation, the
      cleric turned and cast a powerful healing spell on my father. Just then,
      the ghost came upon him and he was dead within seconds. My father,
      guessing what had happened, ran with all his might. The ghost looked up
      from the cleric, and threw his axe across a great expanse of land to
      strike my father in the back.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br>
      The white flash returned me to Kaladim and my practice as the ghost was
      taking his axe out of my father. My cousins sword was still in motion and
      struck my soundly on the side. I screamed a terrible scream as my vision
      went black and I fell to the ground. I awoke an hour later with a fright.
      I was in the clerics hall and the remaining clerics were wondering what
      was wrong with me. I leapt up and told them to go into the mountains and
      get my father, quickly! They were skeptical as to how I came to know this,
      but upon looking in my eyes, they knew that I was very serious. They took
      some guards and ran into the mountains to look for what I had told them I
      had seen. They found much more.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br>
      Not one of the warriors had survived. Their bodies lay scattered all over
      the mountains. The ghost had done its job very well; it tracked down and
      killed every warrior that had been under its command in life. The clerics
      found my father exactly where I said he would be, and he was still alive.
      When they returned to Kaladim, the clerics did everything in their power
      to try to heal his wounds. He had been smitten in the back and was going
      to die, nothing they could do could prevent that from happening now. My
      mother sent me home and told me to stay there, but I couldn’t leave my
      father. I stood outside the Cleric Temple and peeked in a window. I
      watched my own father wither away and die within an hour.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br>
      I told the people of Kaladim what I had seen in my vision, and they
      laughed at me. I was a warrior in training, how could I have seen this
      with no spiritual training? Furthermore, how could I have seen all this in
      the time it took my cousin to swing a sword? I was ridiculed by the
      learned and went home in shame. No one knew the truth of what I had seen.
      I had seen ultimate evil at work, it had killed many people that I knew
      and loved. I had watched it all happen and no one believed me. That night
      after the town was asleep, I rose and kissed my mother goodbye.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      &nbsp;<br>
      <br>
      I wandered for months. I took boats and walked across vast expanses of
      terrain. I knew not where I was going, or what I hoped to find. I only
      knew that I could not go back to Kaladim as I was. I had not completed my
      training as a warrior, so I was very vulnerable. One day in my travels, I
      can upon a cave that very much resembled my home. I walked into it only to
      find that it was inhabited by a race of dog people. I knew that this would
      be my end. They all had great fangs and were armed with weapons rusty with
      age. I began to run out of the cave and hope for the best. As I emerged, I
      tripped over a rock and fell to the ground. I rolled over to see the dog
      men coming close to me, and I shut my eyes, I was preparing to join my
      father.<br>
      <br>
      I heard a great howl and the running of feet. I opened my eyes to see a
      very tall looking man standing over me with a great sword in his hand. One
      of the dog beasts lay dead at his feet. This giant of a man took me in his
      arms and carried me to his home. His land was covered in ice and snow, and
      it was so very cold. I was very weary and so I fell asleep in his arms.
      When I awoke, I was in a hut made of straw and lined with great white
      furs. A very tall woman was standing over me and rubbing a leaf over my
      forehead. I awoke again to find a different woman looking at me. She spoke
      in an accent I had not heard before, “Aye lad, you be a wee one eh?”
      she said with a smile. I asked where I was, and she told me I was in the
      city of Halas. I had never heard of this city, and it seemed to be
      populated by giants. I was scared, and began to cry.<br>
      <br>
      This woman comforted me and asked me what was wrong. She was the first
      person to show any compassion to me in months, and so I told her
      everything. I told her of my home, of my family, of my visions,
      everything. She was amazed at my story. She had never heard of a dwarf!
      What kind of a barbarian was this!?<br>
      <br>
      When I told her of the evil magics, she became very interested. She told
      me of a similar conflict that her people had with evil a long time ago. A
      man with a black aura came to their lands many generations ago. He slew
      dozens of their warriors and then animated their bodies to fight for him.
      This was exactly what I had been looking for, knowledge. She had great
      knowledge about this Twisted One as she called him. She also knew much
      about the art of healing. After a while, I asked her name, “Shatara”
      she said, with another of those brilliant smiles.<br>
      <br>
      I spent many months with her and her people learning the ways of healing
      from them. I also learned all I could about this Twisted One. I wanted to
      find him and kill him for all the grief he had caused my new friends and
      my old family. I learned that blunt weapons crushed bones, and that a
      certain sort of spell was very effective against the undead.<br>
      <br>
      After I had learned much of their ways, I decided to return home to my
      mother and my people. I had learned much from Shatara and her kind. I said
      farewell to Shatara and to Wolfdor, who had saved me from the gnolls, and
      departed. Wielding a new hammer, shield, and elementary magics, I began on
      the long journey homeward.<br>
      <br>
      When I returned, Kaladim was in an uproar. I had been gone for two years,
      and I had returned. I was thought long dead, and yet here I was. I came
      and taught the clerics of Kaladim what I had learned from these peoples. I
      learned the ways of blunt fighting from the warriors, and the ways of
      magics from the clerics.<br>
      <br>
      As I was training, I vowed that I would return to that mansion and destroy
      the undead that had given it the name “Unrest”. I would avenge my
      father and the other slain dwarves that had given the mountains the name
      of “Butcherblock”. I would slay my uncle’s ghost and free his
      spirit. After that, I would seek out and destroy this Twisted One so that
      he could harm no other being ever again.<br>
      <br>
      That is how I became the dwarf I am today. I have a vow to uphold, and I
      will fulfill it or die trying. I took on the name MacLear in honor of the
      barbarians that saved my life and taught me so much in my youth. I am
      Agravaine MacLear, dwarven Cleric of Brell Serilis, and I will be avenged
      on the Twisted One.<br>

</center>
    <p align="justify">Darkness all around. The rank smell of rotten meat.
    Blackness pierced by lightning. The bodies and blood. The torn banner and
    the split shields. The blackened skeletons. Soft laughter, rising to boom in
    ears. Laughter so loud it hurts. So loud head is ready to burst. Red eyes in
    the dark. Looking at me. Looking through me. Lightning flash from the sky.
    Lightning piercing my body. Ground open under my feet. Fire belching from
    the rent ground. Body on fire. Burning. Burning. Laughter splits ears. Red
    eyes in the dark. The torn banner.<br>
    <br>
    I hit the floor with a low thud. This dream was the worst so far. They had
    been tormenting me for months now. Each night getting more desperate. The
    furs on my bed were dripping with sweat, and my nightclothes might have just
    been washed in the well for the cold and damp in them.<br>
    <br>
    I summoned a flask of water and drank of it thirstily, then another. When
    the second flask was finished, I held it in my hand for a while, studying
    it. A fire came into my eyes as a grimace overtook my face. I threw the
    flask across the room, it shattered on the opposite wall, sending shards of
    glass sprawling across the floor. I went to my battle chest and very nearly
    tore the lock from the wood in my haste to open the thing.<br>
    <br>
    In all my years, I had never armored myself so quickly. Straps and buckles
    were tightened and my armor fit like a second skin over my own. The metal
    was cold to the touch, but I was boiling with my own thoughts.<br>
    <br>
    After I had strapped my hammer to my side and my shield to my arm, I reached
    down into the chest one last time and removed a small silver medalion.
    Nothing set this medalion apart from any other except this one bore the
    crest of a house of Kaladim. I slipped the medalion over my helm and tucked
    it into my coat of mail.<br>
    <br>
    I reached down and pulled out a familiar object. No other MacLear had ever
    seen this item. It was a dagger. More than a dagger, it had been made in a
    dwarven forge from a strange metal found in the mines. Very few such blades
    had been made, and none of them had ever left the hands of dwarves. It was
    hilted with silver and it gleamed as if in the sun even when it was in the
    darkness. A saphire was set in the hilt at the base of the blade and dwarven
    runes were etched into the blade with gold. The blade was given to me by my
    father before he left for his battle. He told me it had been given to him by
    his father when he was ready to begin his training as a warrior. I had worn
    it into every battle I had ever taken part in, tucked into my belt and under
    my mail coat where none could see. When I wore it, I always felt closer to
    him. Always felt as if he were there with me, guiding me.<br>
    <br>
    I held the dagger in the light, remembering the pride in his eyes when he
    had handed it to me as he left our house that day. Remembering the look in
    his eyes as he lay in the Temple surrounded by clerics. That blank look of
    one who has seen true terror and fear. The look of a man without a soul. The
    look of a man dead on the inside.<br>
    <br>
    I gripped the dagger in my hand and my knuckles whitened with the force of
    it. I quickly penned a note on a parchment. I left my chamber and closed the
    door behind me. I held the note on the door and thrust the dagger through
    the parchment and deep into the wood of the door.<br>
    <br>
    A guard making his rounds came down the hallway as I stabbed at the door. He
    came up as if to ask what I was up to but stopped short when I turned my
    gaze to meet his. My eyes blazed as a furnace and chilled as a glacier at
    once. They burned with a pain many years old and never tended to, and they
    froze with determination and a sense of the highest duty.<br>
    <br>
    The guard stopped dead in his tracks. Though the man was easliy twice my
    size, he looked at me as if I were Vox herself come from Permafrost to find
    him. He turned and started off back down the hall almost at a run. I don't
    know what he was afraid of. My business was not with him, not with any man
    or beast living.<br>
    <br>
    When the guard was out of sight, I closed my eyes and a faint glow
    surrounded me. The air crackled and sparked and I vanished into the night.<br>
    <br>
    I appeared in the mountains of Butcherblock. It was the place I had been
    bound as a child. One never forgets his first binding. I turned away from
    the massive statue and the bonfires that marked the entrance to my childhood
    city. I headed into the night to meet my fate and find my destiny. I had a
    score to settle.<br>
    <br>
    Next morning when I failed to show up for breakfast, the note and dagger
    were found in my door. The note was plain and informal, it read:<br>
    <br>
    <cite>I have gone on a journey that I must make alone. Please do not follow
    me for the dangers be greater than any story makes them out to be. I go to
    meet my fate, and to seek my destiny. I go to complete a vow I made long ago
    and have neglected for far too long. If I do not return, have this dagger
    sent to Kaladim. The guards will know who it is from and who to give it to.</cite><br>
    </p>
    <p align="justify">It was easy to tell when you neared that foul place. The
    earth was dead for miles around it in all directions. No tree or grass would
    grow, not even weeds, the taint was so strong. The low green hills gave way
    to jagged crags of rock as I drew closer to the lake, closer to the mansion.<br>
    <br>
    The lake was still and stagnant. The few fish that managed to survive in it
    were unfit to eat. Anything that bathed in the water became diseased and
    crazed, even the rats.<br>
    <br>
    As I made my way along the shores of the lake, I came upon a camp of aqua
    goblins. Even these foul creatures were twisted by the taint of the mansion,
    less than a mile away. I gave the camp a wide birth, for I had no time to
    play with goblins. The excited, gutteral shriek behind me told me that I had
    not given them a wide wnough birth, and that I would soon have to do battle
    with the goblins.<br>
    <br>
    I spun around to find the first of the creatures nearly upon me. Apparently
    it had been looking for a cauldron rat to eat and had spotted me instead. I
    quick glance past this first goblin showed four others running at me from
    their crude tents. Having little recourse left to me, I unsheathed my hammer
    and readied my shield.<br>
    <br>
    The first goblin closed the gap between us with such speed that I was taken
    a little aback. But my shock was of little avail to the creature. It was a
    young goblin, and as such it's first blow was clumsy, to say the least. I
    casually stepped aside, letting it's blow strike at the air and throw the
    insulent goblin off balance. As it staggered to regain it's footing, my
    hammer fell across the nape of it's neck. The deep thud and sickening crack
    told me I had nothing more to fear from this goblin.<br>
    <br>
    I turned my attention away from the green corpse to the four other goblins
    who were charging at me. Their stride broke when their companion fell, but
    only for a moment. Howls of rage and anger gave them new resolve as they
    quickened their pace. My eyes searched for the largest of the goblins, and
    upon finding it, locked onto my next target.<br>
    <br>
    I began to chant an incantation that I knew by heart. Clerics should never
    have cause for this particular spell, but my path had called me to use it
    far more than I would have wished. My hands wove in ancient symbols of the
    dwarven people and my eyes began to glow a faint whilte. I called out to my
    god Brell. Called for him to give me the power and the strength to vanquish
    those who would see me slain. My answer came as a tingling feeling in my
    hands. I whispered a prayer of thanks as I pointed at the biggest of the
    goblins and the glow in my eyes turned from white to a dull red.<br>
    <br>
    Where my finger pointed, the air grew dry and charged with power. The goblin
    slowed it's pace as it felt the air around it change. It's eyes grew wide as
    it's expression changed from rage to wonder to absolute terror. The spells
    of a cleric are not of water or fire or ice. The spells a cleric uses are of
    light, pure and crisp. The flash of red light seemed to burst from within
    the goblin. It's scream echoed off of the bare, jagged rocks of the cauldron
    and mingled with the boom and crack of the spell striking home. When the
    flash of light faded away, all that remained of the goblin was a pile of
    grey dust.<br>
    <br>
    The other goblins lay about on the ground. None of them were injured, but
    the flash of light and sudden crack of power had frightened them to their
    wits ends. One of them managed to get to it's feet and take a look about. It
    saw it's fellows scattered about on the floor, and the pile of dust, and
    took off running back the way it had come, yelping with fear.<br>
    The others remained on the ground, scared to move.<br>
    <br>
    As much as I would have loved to remain and slay the others, I had little
    time to spare, and I had already used too much power on these hateful spawn.
    My duties took me further down the lake shore.<br>
    <br>
    I left the goblins behind me, as i knew they would not trouble me or any
    other passerby for a long while to come. In the distance stood the mansion
    that I had traveled so far to come to. The clouds hung thick and black over
    the mannor, allowing not the slightest hint of sunshine through. The mannor
    was set in a valley in the jagged mountains and was walled off from all
    sides. The only way in was from the front, through a tunnel.<br>
    <br>
    I approached the tunnel entrance with much caution. Nothing moved this close
    to the mannor, even the rats shied away from this place.<br>
    <br>
    The tunnel was empty. At it's end, it let out into a courtyard. It had once
    been a beautiful sight to behold, gardens and green lawns, the fountains
    running with crisp clear water. Now everything was dead. The grasses of the
    lawns were greyed and dry. The water of the fountains were dark and of a
    color that seemed part red with blood and part brown with decay.<br>
    <br>
    Beyond the fountains were mazes of hedge on either side of a paved walkway.
    The walkway led to a great wooden porch and the huge oaken doors of the
    front entrance to the mannor. Lightning flashed in the sky and illuminated
    the great wooden tower looming over all the mansion grounds. This was the
    place from my dreams...<br>
    </p>
    <p align="justify">This was the place from my dreams! I had come to the end
    of my journey. Now I had but to finish my task, had but to destroy the evil
    that had corrupted this place and avenge my father his death.<br>
    <br>
    Memories drifted back to me all too slowly. This WAS the place from my
    dreams. In fact, this was the exact spot I had always stood when I... I dove
    to one side as the very earth belched fire and lightning fell from the sky
    upon the place I had just stood. As I flew through the air, I glanced up at
    the tower towards the blood red eyes I knew I would see there.<br>
    <br>
    I had escaped death, but I had not escaped the blast unharmed. A bit of the
    fire had licked over my left leg. It should have been a few singed hairs at
    the most; but the burning pain that tore at the spot told me that had been
    no ordinary fire. The wizard that cast it had been powerful in life, and the
    unnatural death had augmented that power, and twisted it. The taint of the
    evil was stronger than I had imagined; the burn was growing, as if I held my
    leg in a furnace.<br>
    <br>
    I crawled behind the hedges, out of eyesight with the tower. Every healing
    spell I had ever learned came to mind. The burn was not very large, but it
    was growing with increasing swiftness. I chose to use Greater Healing on it.
    instantly the burn halted it's progress, and the pain softened, but the burn
    remained. None of the spells healed the burn, and the pain did not go away,
    it only diminished to a dull throb.<br>
    <br>
    I pulled myself up onto my feet and tested the leg. Putting weight on it
    still made the burn rage with pain. It would make walking difficult indeed,
    but I had to go on. I had come this far and I would not fail in my task, it
    was far more important than the burn. I cast a spell to shield me from
    undead eyes, and my skin tingled with a crisp coolness. Focusing my mind, I
    was able to ignore most of the pain. I was still aware of it of course, but
    it seemed distant.<br>
    <br>
    I made my way towards the house. Not knowing anything about it, I decided to
    use the front door. No one suspects an attack from the front, not even the
    dead. The door creaked open and I limped through with as much caution as I
    could. To either side of the door were small rooms, probably coatrooms from
    when the mansion was still thriving and alive. Now they housed creatures
    from beyond death.<br>
    <br>
    To the right was what appeared to once have been a goblin. It
    &quot;stood&quot; with a deep crouch, it's knuckles would have touched the
    floor if it had not been holding it's arms out, ready to pounce on anything
    that tried to enter. Skin that once was green was brown and blackened with
    rot. Parts of it peeled back to reveal grey muscle. A dull yellow glow came
    from it's hollow eyes. Those eyes revealed no awareness at all, this
    creature had become the puppet of some greater power.<br>
    <br>
    The invisibility spell was working as it should have. The creature didn't
    move at all even when I stepped into plain sight. The mummy to the left made
    no move to stop me either.<br>
    <br>
    Now I was inside the mansion, but I had no clue where to go. I knew there
    were many floors to this place, but where was the evil I was looking for?
    Passageways opened to both sides of the front door. &quot;Left.&quot; The
    thought came and went with such speed that I had to assure myself that I had
    it at all. Somehow, the thought was not my own. It was in my head, but I had
    not made it. It came with a sense of urgency, but no malice was in it. I
    turned left and took that corridor.<br>
    <br>
    Doors stood shut on my left side, and an open entryway on the right side of
    the hallway led into a larger room. I started down the hallway, waiting for
    another thought to come to me, waiting for the ambush the strange thought
    could have set me up for.<br>
    <br>
    No thought came and I neared the opening to the larger room. Inside that
    room stood another mummy and a skeleton bleached white with age. Cruel iron
    hooks hung from rusty chains from the ceiling and a staircase ran up to the
    next floor. I turned to go up the stairs, after all, I had seen the red eyes
    in the tower. &quot;Left.&quot;<br>
    <br>
    I turned to my left and found a closed door. I opened it was great care, and
    limped inside. Another skeleton stood in this room, it's bones drowned with
    dirt and blackened by fire. It made no attack. &quot;Right.&quot; I stood
    staring at a bookshelf. Other thoughts came to me, &quot;Up.&quot;
    &quot;Down.&quot; &quot;Right.&quot; My hand touched a book that had once
    been bound in red leather. The leather was cracked and the red was faded to
    brown. &quot;There.&quot; I tugged at the book and it clicked. The shelf
    swing inwards and a dark passageway opened behind it.<br>
    <br>
    I held my shield as if to block some great blow, but none came. My knuckles
    were white for my grip on my hammer. I gathered my wits and took a drink
    from a bottle of ale I took from a drunken fire goblin in a cave above a
    volcano. It made it easier to focus my thoughts and a calm came over me. I
    hobbled into the passageway, down into the darkness...<br>
