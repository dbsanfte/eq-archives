Journey from Halas to Freeport</em></strong></big></big></big></p>

<p><strong><em>This story is guaranteed to be true to in-game detail.&nbsp; However, as a
whole it is only based in truth as I have compiled some of my more memorable experiences
and best screenshots to give you an rough overview of the life of a Barbarian Warrior from
1st to 16th level and linked them here as one story.</em></strong></p>

<p><strong><em>This story starts off where all stories should, at the beginning.&nbsp; The
beginning happens to be the Barbarian city of Halas.</em></strong></p>

<p><strong><em>I come into the world of Norrath a naked Son of Halas.&nbsp; Note to soft
folk: Only you soft folk call us &quot;barbarian.&quot;&nbsp; As we know this is a term
that means &quot;uncouth wild person&quot; we except it.&nbsp; For it is truth. &nbsp;
However, we do not take your term for us as our own.&nbsp; </em></strong></p>

<p><strong><em>I am born with the ability to slam and stun my enemies, to endure cold, and
greater strength and stamina than all but the evil Troll and dark Ogre.&nbsp; I choose to
be a warrior as my father before me.&nbsp; After killing many polar bear cubs, goblin
welps, wooly spiders, decaying skeletons, gnoll pups, and learning the confusing maze of
glacial crevasses that is Everfrost I make 10th level.</em></strong></p>

<p><strong><em>Soon after I have saved enough platinum to buy a chain helm.&nbsp; Although
it impresses many that I meet I still am not nearly tough enough to take on a <a href="images/story1/mamrump.jpg">wooly mammoth</a>. </em></strong></p>

<p><strong><em>After running in fright from the thundering, stomping feet of the mammoth I
find myself lost.&nbsp; For some time I was wandering around in the icy wastes of
Everfrost and I saw the entrance to a castle lit by huge torches.&nbsp; I peek inside the
castle and get my first and last living look at an <a href="images/story1/EFicegiant.jpg">ice
giant</a>. &nbsp; I died to bring that shot to you so you better look at it.&nbsp; That is
the closest you will ever come to an ice giant unless you are willing to die.&nbsp; There
were two hits...he hit me and I hit the ground.</em></strong></p>

<p><strong><em>After realizing that the wastes of Everfrost could be too perilous even for
a warrior of my stature I decide to find the famous dungeon of Black Burrow.&nbsp; At
first I am disbelieving that such a <a href="images/story1/bbfalls.jpg">peaceful scene</a>
could be the home of vicious beasts.&nbsp; However, if you look carefully you will see the
gnoll watcher that is silently calling his mongrel friends to come slaughter my while I
soak in the false serenity.</em></strong></p>

<p><strong><em>Five minutes later the gnolls have taken over!&nbsp; They are formed in a
battle formation that is as powerful as its name entails.&nbsp; A gnoll <a href="images/story1/bbtrain.jpg">TRAIN</a>!!&nbsp; If you love life, don't be in the same
area as a train or you will soon die.&nbsp; I thought that I would be able to run away
from this death machine.</em></strong></p>

<p><strong><em>Just after that screen shot was taken a turned to run only to be buried in
gnolls that had snuck up on me from behind.&nbsp; I am fairly certain that everyone in
that shot died soon thereafter.</em></strong></p>

<p><strong><em>After learning how to survive in a dungeon (hint: learn how to swim) I
found that battling the gnolls of <a href="images/story1/bbmouth.jpg">Black Burrow</a> was
what I had been born to do.&nbsp; Many, many gnolls died to my axe's blade before I <a href="images/story1/HalasBoat.jpg">returned to Halas</a> for what would be the last time
in many moons.</em></strong></p>

<p><strong><em>While I was in Halas I heard from a friend that there was much more to the
world than ice, snow and gnolls.&nbsp; He warned me it would be dangerous, but I decided
to journey to the easternmost city of Freeport and on the way I would see the world of the
soft folk.</em></strong></p>

<p><strong><em>My first sight was the beauty of a Karana sunrise.&nbsp; I was in awe of
that event and would have stopped to take it in.&nbsp; However, our party had spotted
several Hill Giants in the area.</em></strong></p>

<p><strong><em>After running east for many miles through the plains of the Karanas (where
many of my party died to Hill Giant attacks on our camp) we arrived at Highhold Keep.
&nbsp; There we were ambushed by a family of gnolls called Mucktail.&nbsp; They were bad
news and nearly finished off the party.&nbsp; Fortunately for us, we were saved by a group
of High Elven mages.&nbsp; The smell of fried gnoll still reminds me of Highhold Keep.</em></strong></p>

<p><strong><em>On the other side of Highhold Keep is Kithicor Forest.&nbsp; There we
decided to rest for what we thought would be a night or so.&nbsp; It turned out that we
stayed for many moons as we found the people of Riverdale charming and the <a href="images/story1/minotaur.jpg">minotaurs</a> of the maze very challenging.</em></strong></p>

<p><strong><em>By the time I left my fine, fur footed friends of Riverdale I was 15th
level and ready to face the world.&nbsp; I headed east again through the sands, forests,
and hills of the Commons.&nbsp; In the Commons I did battle and fled from a
werewolf.&nbsp; Those creatures of the night are vicious and have the ability to infect
you with the disease of Lycanthropy. &nbsp; If you are infected you will become a
werewolf.&nbsp; Not a nice thought.</em></strong></p>

<p><strong><em>After several other adventures in the Commons, I finally arrived at
Freeport and I had made enough platinum to buy a couple more pieces of chainmail and <a href="images/story1/fptavern.jpg">beers for my comrades in arms</a> in a local tavern.
&nbsp; Getting drunk after a good battle is second nature.</em></strong></p>

<p><strong><em>Freeport is a very large city and it took me many days to understand its
alleys and streets.&nbsp; Once I began to feel comfortable, I got the yearning to head
east once again.</em></strong></p>

<p><strong><em>After waiting much of the night for the ship that would give us passage on
the Ocean of Tears, my <a href="images/story1/fpdock.jpg">travel companions</a> were ready
to do battle with anything.</em></strong></p>

<p><strong><em>A note to the gnomes: The first of your kind that I met wore a very large
metal helm.&nbsp; It took me by surprise to see what looked like a walking, talking helmet
addressing my boot.&nbsp; For a minute I thought I was enthralled by some eastern magik.
&nbsp; Soon, Zurditen convinced me he was not a helmet, but a cleric of the gnomish race.
&nbsp; I still call him Helmet.&nbsp; He still talks to my boot.</em></strong></p>

<p><strong><em>After finally booking passage on a fine ship, we settled in for the long
voyage.&nbsp; As soon as I had taken refuge in the ships hold, we docked on an island.
&nbsp; My fast moving, new found, gnomish friends decided that there were pirates on the
island and forced me to accompany them to rid the island of the sea brigands.&nbsp; After
such a long wait for passage out of Freeport, I had second thoughts as I saw the <a href="images/story1/tearship.jpg">ship</a> leave for the eastern horizon.</em></strong></p>

<p><strong><em>However, the island proved interesting as we found pirates to battle.
&nbsp; We also found strange green skinned &quot;aqua goblins&quot; and an even stranger
island race of giants called Gornit that could swim faster than most fish.</em></strong></p>

<p><strong><em>Best of all I found a secret <a href="images/story1/TearStones.jpg">Stone
Ring</a>.&nbsp; My people consider these places holy ground.&nbsp; There I took a moment
to bless my sword to the service of my kinsman and the <a href="Default.htm">Clan MacLear</a>.</em></strong></p>

<p><strong><em>There ends the story.&nbsp; For you have caught up to me.&nbsp; Now let's
see if I can avoid those Gornits and make it back to the ship alive...</em></strong></p>
