<CENTER><H2>The History of the Clan MacLear</H2></CENTER>
&nbsp; <IMG SRC="images/lettert.gif" width="30" height="30"> he Clan MacLear began as a guild of barbarians who were
born and raised in Halas. During the many battles with the many evil monsters and undead of
Norrath, the Clan has befriended valorius peoples of other races and, to reward their loyalty
to the Clan, they have been made MacLear and are allowed all the honors of one who shares our
blood. This is the legend of how the Clan MacLear came to call Halas and the frozen wastes of
the North home.

<FONT SIZE=2> &nbsp; &nbsp; - Quoted from the Spring Moon, 3rd Hand of The Shaman's Mantra
</FONT></CENTER>
<BR>
&nbsp; <IMG SRC="images/lettert.gif" width="30" height="30"> he Shaman's Mantra is all the MacLears have left of their
history and they treasure it above all other things.  It tells of the legendary Lord Lear, the
leader of the ancients, and how he brought them into the lands of Everfrost and the city of Halas.
Much of the history of our Clan was lost in the second dark age, but is even now being
rediscovered.  Lord Lear was a lord in a once great army of warriors that were dedicated
to defeat an ancient evil empire from another existence.  While commanding part of this
great army, Lord Lear became aware that his commander had planned the destruction of
several of the best warriors in Lear's band. Lord Lear challenged his commander only
to discover that he was in league with the evil one who led the forces of darkness.
In the battle that ensued, Lord Lear defeated the evil commander but was unable to destroy
him. In the years that followed the evil empire was defeated but in the process, the great
army was decimated and infected with the very evil it had set out to defeat.
<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; <IMG SRC="images/letterl.gif" width="30" height="30"> ord Lear gathered around him those of his clan and those
who chose to follow him and set out for a distant world thinking to escape from the curse of
the twisted thinking of the evil one. After many years and severe trials in which many
who chose to follow him were lost, they came to the ancient world of Britannia where they
established themselves as a virtuous and hard working clan. It was in those days that Lear,
having married, was gifted with three sons: Erath, Agonisty and Dolgan. Sadly, it was not
long in that world before the followers of the dark forces came to bedevil Britannia as well.
The Clan MacLear was then formed and in turn formed the society called in that world Hand of
Virtue. For many long years the MacLears led the forces who defended the roadways west of
Britain. Despite their best efforts those who follow the destroyer multiplied. The sons of Lear
held council and determined that their sons should not have to fight continually against the
dark forces. Having heard of a distant world where those of character would not and could not
attack each except in agreed upon duels and where good men and women would come together to
fight the monsters that would conquer the world and plunge it into darkness, they chose to
send their sons on to Norrath. 
<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; <IMG SRC="images/letteri.gif" width="30" height="30"> t is not known if Lear's People were the first to inhabit
Everfrost or if Halas was already inhabited by peoples that are called Barbarians. Perhaps, some
day a clever Shaman or Wizard will discover these answers.  It is reported that the sons of
Lear still defend the roads west of Britain to this day.

&nbsp; <IMG SRC="images/lettert.gif" width="30" height="30"> hrough the generations, the MacLears have become strong and
tall due to the harsh environment of Everfrost.  Halas, the Northern most city in Norrath, is the
MacLear's only refuge from the continual winter that is Everfrost.  To insure that the
MacLears will continue to grow strong in this harsh climate, one of their customs is to
set their newborn children in the snow from Moon Rise to Moon Set.  If the child survives
the rite it is then named.  Thus those that do not survive are not even considered to
have existed.

&nbsp; <IMG SRC="images/letterm.gif" width="30" height="30"> any years after Lear's People had come to call Halas Home,
there came an twisted, dark skinned man to Everfrost.  When he came to our lands word was
spread by watchers and scouts that everything that he touched was blackened by decay almost
instantaneously.  Several watchers who got too close to the Twisted One were sapped of
their life and fell lifeless to the snow.  Chief Leod, the Chief of MacLears at that
time, took up his axe "Gungnir" and commanded his people to rid the MacLear lands of
this blight.  After losing many of their kinsman to strange death magiks that no Shaman
of that time had ever seen, the Twisted One disappeared into the frozen depths of
Everfrost.  Many years later, a scout on Quest found a worn and strange Tome half
buried in the snow near a cave deep in the Wastes.

<B><A NAME="Miragul">T</A>he Legend of the Twisted Tome</B><BR>
&nbsp; <IMG SRC="images/letterc.gif" width="30" height="30"> lan MacLear is famous for its long history of harrowing
deeds and fabulous wealth; although, it is said that many of the harrowing deeds were done
to atone for the shady manner in which such fabulous wealth was acquired.  In the shadows of a
dying campfire, it is said that the key to the MacLear wealth is the Twisted Tome.
<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; <IMG SRC="images/letteri.gif" width="30" height="30"> n hushed voices, those who will speak of it will say that
in the time of
our grandfathers' grandfathers there came through our lands an ancient and powerful
user of terrible death magiks.  Everything that he touched was drained of life and
withered. Many of our clan were lost or withered in the terrible and strange battle
with the Twisted One.   After losing many of our kin, the Twisted One tired of our
tireless pursuit of him and traveled deeper into the heart of the frozen wasteland that
is Everfrost.  Years after his passage an ancient and worn tome of writings was found
near a cave, deep in the wastelands.  The MacLear shamans determined that the book was
not of our ken and understanding and must have come from beyond our lands. It is believed
to have once belonged to the Twisted One.
<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; <IMG SRC="images/lettera.gif" width="30" height="30"> fter many years of research and study, and assistance from
a wise High Elf from lands beyond the big water, the High Council was able to translate much
of what remained of the tome.  The Tome is said to to hold many of the most powerful secrets
of Norrathian Magik and Lore.  The secrets are said to have the power to twist and ruin
all but the most stout of heart and mind.  Thus, the High Council keeps the contents
safe from prying eyes, even from fellow MacLears who have not yet reached two hands of
ability.
