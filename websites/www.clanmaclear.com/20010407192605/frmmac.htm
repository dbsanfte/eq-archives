MacLear</a>  began as a guild of barbarians who were born and raised in Halas.&nbsp; During
the many battles with the many evil monsters and undead of Norrath, the Clan has
befriended valorius peoples of other races and, to reward their loyalty to the Clan, they
have been made MacLear and are allowed all the honors of one who shares our blood.&nbsp;
This is the legend of how the Clan MacLear came to call Halas and the frozen wastes of the
North home.</small></i></strong></p>

<blockquote>
  <p align="left"><em><strong><small>&quot;And Lord Lear looked upon the hordes of the
  Daemon and was shaken at the Carnage that the Dark Ones had wrought.&nbsp; And
  he knelt to his Knee, touched his blooded sword to his head and prayed to the
  Great God he did not know who was Chief of all the Gods, that He would answer his call
  for Mercy and deliver Them from the Time of Trials...&quot;</small><br>
  <small>- Quoted from the Spring Moon, 3rd Hand of The Shaman's Mantra</small></strong></em></p>
</blockquote>

<p align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0"><em><strong><big><font face="Balmoral D">T</font></big><small>he Shaman's
Mantra is all the MacLears have left of their history and they treasure it above all other
things.&nbsp; It tells of the legendary Lord Lear, the leader of the ancients, and how he
brought them into the lands of Everfrost and the city of Halas.&nbsp; Much of
the history of our Clan was lost in the second dark age, but is even now being
rediscovered.&nbsp; Lord Lear was a lord in a once great army of warriors that were
dedicated to defeat an ancient evil empire from another existence.&nbsp; While
commanding part of this great army, Lord Lear became aware that his commander
had planned the destruction of several of the best warriors in Lear's band. Lord
Lear challenged his commander only to discover that he was in league with the
evil one who led the forces of darkness. In the battle that ensued, Lord Lear
defeated the evil commander but was unable to destroy him. In the years that
followed the evil empire was defeated but in the process, the great army was
decimated and infected with the very evil it had set out to defeat.</small></strong></em></p>

<p align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0"><em><strong><small>Lord Lear gathered
around him those of his clan and those who chose to follow him and set out for a
distant world thinking to escape from the curse of the twisted thinking of the
evil one. After many years and severe trials in which many who chose to follow
him were lost, they came to the ancient world of Britannia where they
established themselves as a virtuous and hard working clan. It was in those days
that Lear, having married, was gifted with three sons: Erath, Agonisty and
Dolgan. Sadly, it was not long in that world before the followers of the dark
forces came to bedevil Britannia as well.&nbsp;&nbsp; The Clan MacLear was then
formed and in turn formed the society called in that world Hand of Virtue. For
many long years the MacLears led the forces who defended the roadways west of
Britain. Despite their best efforts those who follow the destroyer multiplied.
The sons of Lear held council and determined that their sons should not have to
fight continually against the dark forces. Having heard of a distant world where
those of character would not and could not attack each except in agreed upon
duels and where good men and women would come together to fight the monsters
that would conquer the world and plunge it into darkness, they chose to send
their sons on to Norrath.&nbsp;</small></strong></em></p>

<p align="left" style="margin-top: 0"><em><strong><small>&nbsp;It is
not known if Lear's People were the first to inhabit Everfrost or if Halas was already
inhabited by peoples that are called Barbarians. &nbsp; Perhaps, some day a clever Shaman
or Wizard will discover these answers.&nbsp; It is reported that the sons of
Lear still defend the roads west of Britain to this day.</small></strong></em></p>

<p align="left"><em><strong><big><font face="Balmoral D">T</font></big><small>hrough the
generations, the MacLears have become
strong and tall due to the harsh environment of Everfrost.&nbsp; Halas, the Northern most
city in Norrath, is the MacLear's only refuge from the continual winter that is
Everfrost.&nbsp; To insure that the MacLears will continue to grow strong in this harsh
climate, one of their customs is to set their newborn children in the snow from Moon Rise
to Moon Set.&nbsp; If the child survives the rite it is then named.&nbsp; Thus those that
do not survive are not even considered to have existed.</small></strong></em></p>

<p align="left"><em><strong><font face="Balmoral D"><big>M</big></font><small>any years
after Lear's People had come to call Halas Home, there came an twisted, dark skinned man
to Everfrost.&nbsp; When he came to our lands word was spread by watchers and scouts that
everything that he touched was blackened by decay almost instantaneously.&nbsp; Several
watchers who got too close to the Twisted One were sapped of their life and fell lifeless
to the snow.&nbsp; Chief Leod, the Chief of MacLears at that time, took up his axe
&quot;Gungnir&quot; and commanded his people to rid the MacLear lands of this
blight.&nbsp; After losing many of their kinsman to strange death magiks that no Shaman of
that time had ever seen, the Twisted One disappeared into the frozen depths of
Everfrost.&nbsp; Many years later, a scout on Quest found a worn and strange Tome half
buried in the snow near a cave deep in the Wastes.</small></strong></em></p>

<p><strong><i><small>The Legend of the Twisted Tome</small><br>
<big><font face="Balmoral D">C</font></big><small>lan MacLear is famous for its long
history of harrowing deeds and fabulous wealth; although, it is said that many of the
harrowing deeds were done to atone for the shady manner in which such fabulous wealth was
acquired.&nbsp; In the shadows of a dying campfire, it is said that the key to the MacLear
wealth is the Twisted Tome.</small></i></strong></p>

<p><strong><i><font face="Balmoral D"><big>I</big></font><small>n hushed voices, those who
will speak of it will say that in the time of our grandfathers' grandfathers there came
through our lands an ancient and powerful user of terrible death magiks.&nbsp; Everything
that he touched was drained of life and withered. &nbsp; Many of our clan were lost or
withered in the terrible and strange battle with the Twisted One.&nbsp;&nbsp; After losing
many of our kin, the Twisted One tired of our tireless pursuit of him and traveled deeper
into the heart of the frozen wasteland that is Everfrost.&nbsp; Years after his passage an
ancient and worn tome of writings was found near a cave, deep in the wastelands.&nbsp; The
MacLear shamans determined that the book was not of our ken and understanding and must
have come from beyond our lands.&nbsp; It is believed to have once belonged to the Twisted
One.</small></i></strong></p>

<p><strong><i><big><font face="Balmoral D">A</font></big><small>fter many years of
research and study, and assistance from a wise High Elf from lands beyond the big water,
the High Council was able to translate much of what remained of the tome.&nbsp; The Tome
is said to to hold many of the most powerful secrets of Norrathian Magik and Lore.&nbsp;
The secrets are said to have the power to twist and ruin all but the most stout of heart
and mind.&nbsp; Thus, the High Council keeps the contents safe from prying eyes, even from
fellow MacLears who have not yet reached two hands of ability.</small></i></strong></p>

<i><strong><big><font face="Balmoral D">

<p><font size="4">I</font></font><font size="2">t is said that outside of space and time
an entity known only as the Nameless exists, and that this being created all that there is
and was and will be. It is also written in ancient texts that from His mind sprang not
only the universe and its countless suns and worlds, but also a myriad of sentient,
powerful, yet finite creatures whom one such as a man, or elf, or dwarf, would call a god.</font></p>

<p><font face="Balmoral D" size="4">I</font><font size="2">n aeons past came one of these
gods upon the world Norrath. Veeshan, Crystalline Dragon and ruler of the Plane of Sky,
found this world pleasing and deposited her brood onto the frozen continent of Velious.
With one swipe of her mighty claws, Veeshan opened several great wounds upon the surface
of Norrath, staking her claim to this promising new world. Dragons then walked the land
and flew the skies, powerful beings of great intellect, wisdom, and strength. Thus began
the Age of Scale.</font></p>

<p><font face="Balmoral D" size="4">I</font><font size="2">n time the other gods noticed
Veeshan&#146;s work, and being often petty and jealous beings, they too came upon Norrath,
intent upon leaving their mark. Brell Serilis was first, and from his Plane of Underfoot,
a dark realm of vast caves and endless tunnels, he quietly created a magical portal to a
cavern deep in the belly of Norrath. Through this portal the Duke of Underfoot seeded the
depths of Norrath with all manner of creatures. Brell then returned home, sealing his
portal within a labyrinthine chamber of mystical Living Stone. </font></p>

<p><font face="Balmoral D" size="4">A</font><font size="2">nd when the other gods came to
Norrath, Brell Serilis approached each of them, and after some time convinced them to meet
as one to discuss the fate of the world. The Great Mother Tunare, and Prexus, The
Oceanlord were in attendance, and Rallos Zek, the warlord, was also there, yet in mistrust
kept his distance. Brell, carefully avoiding all queries as to the origins of his
information, told of Veeshan's discovery of the new and potentially powerful world in
which she had deposited her brood. Words befit of the King of Thieves poured forth from
Brell's lips and he proposed that they accept an alliance of sorts, to which all save
Rallos Zek agreed, ignorant of the fact that Brell had already released some of his
creations into the Underfoot of this new world. The planet that would be called Norrath
was divvied up between these beings of power for the purpose of keeping the Wurmqueen in
check. Each would create a race of beings to watch over Norrath and keep a vigilant eye on
the schemes of Dragonkind. Brell claimed the bowels of the planet and created the Dwarves,
stout and strong, deep beneath the mountains of Norrath. In the abysmal depths of the
oceans Prexus left his children, the Kedge, hearty aquatic beings of great mental power
and stamina. And on the surface of Norrath did Tunare create the Elves, creatures of
limitless grace and beauty, and Rallos Zek the Giants, fierce and formidable beings,
intent upon the defense of their lands. Thus began the Elder Age. </font></p>

<p><font face="Balmoral D" size="4">I</font><font size="2">t was inevitable that such
energies involved in seeding planets with life would attract even more of the gods, and it
was the Elves who drew the unwanted attention of Innoruuk, Prince of Hate. In a decrepit
tower overlooking the dark decaying alleys of the Plane over which he ruled, Innoruuk
waited, stoking the fire of his Hate until it was a raging inferno. He cursed his fellow
gods for not including him in their pact and vowed to make them regret such disrespect.
From the halls of the Elves' fair city, Takish-Hiz, the Prince of Hate snatched away the
first Elven King and Queen. In his realm of pain and anger he slowly tore them apart,
physically and mentally, over the course of three hundred years. He then gathered the
quivering remnants of these beings of light and rebuilt them into his own dark sadistic
image, a twisted mockery of Tunare's noble children. In depositing the Teir'Dal, as
Innoruuk's Dark Elven creations would come to be called, back into the Underfoot of
Norrath, the seeds for The Prince of Hate's final revenge were sown.</font></p>

<p><font face="Balmoral D" size="4">F</font><font size="2">izzlethorpe Bristlebane and
Cazic-Thule came next to Norrath, and Brell met them, concocting a second pact with these
latter gods, wishing another excuse to create more peoples into the world. Rallos Zek
again watched from afar, determined to add to his creation as well, and this time Brell
convinced the Warlord to join the pact, assuring him that it was indeed an appropriate
time to fulfill his desires. Deep in the earth did Brell return to create the gnomes,
resembling dwarves to some extent, yet more wiry and gnarled, consumed with tinkering with
devices more so than their cousins. On the surface, away from Elves and Giants,
Bristlebane made the Halflings, short and stubby folk, agile and with a propensity to
meddle and even pilfer at times. Cazic-Thule, Lord of Fear, was drawn to the swamps and
jungles of Norrath and there created the green skinned Trolls and reptilian Lizard Men.
And Rallos Zek returned to the surface, pleased with his sanction to create even more
peoples for his army. He made then the Ogres, massive, unmovable beings of questionable
intelligence, and the Orcs, bred for battle and singled-minded in their desire for
conquest. </font></p>

<p><font face="Balmoral D" size="4">B</font><font size="2">y this time, those who are now
known as the elder races of Norrath had begun to expand and mature. Villages became
cities, and cities became kingdoms. Several of the races became bent on expansion and
warfare became part of their developing cultures. And of all the races, it was the Ogres
who quickly proved the most interested in battle and plunder, and their empire grew
outward from their mountain home until it eventually encompassed a large portion of
Tunaria, largest of the known continents. Their knowledge of magic grew as did their
greed, until they became weary of only Norrath, and when they learned of other planes and
dimensions, invaded the Plane of Earth itself. Rallos Zek watched with pride as his
creations challenged the gods of that realm, and when they eventually knew defeat, the
Warlord himself led a second invasion. The war that ensued shook the heavens and angered
the greater gods. Through their combined might, Rallos Zek was finally thwarted and forced
back to his domain, after which a great barrier to the Planes of Power was erected,
denying entry to both the lesser gods and mortals as well. And then, in what some view as
spite and others justice, the gods cursed the Warlord&#146;s creations. Thousands of Ogres
were slain and their empire collapsed around them. The Giants were spread from one end of
the earth to the other, forced to flee their homes as the gods brought snow and ice to
their previously lush lands. And the goblins were also cursed, but no writings remain of
their punishment as they no longer keep records of their history (which is perhaps some
indication as to the severity of their curse). Thus began the Age of Monuments.</font></p>

<p><font face="Balmoral D" size="4">A</font><font size="2">s the dust settled, the last of
the gods came to Norrath. Mithaniel Marr, god of Valor, and Erollisi Marr, goddess of
Love, created the Barbarians, a hardy race who settled the cold and rugged northlands,
near the ruins of the Giant empire. Being the youngest race, they were generally unwashed
and rugged, possessing very few social graces. And while they too had a warlike culture,
there were those amongst them who began to believe in something more. By this time the
other civilizations of Norrath had either long since declined, or were well on their way,
and this small minority of Barbarians saw an opportunity to triumph where the others had
failed. Perhaps this was a seed of wisdom planted by the Marr Twins, or perhaps it was
only by chance, but as the Barbarians spread out across the lands, warring with both each
other and any other race encountered, this tiny movement continued to grow. And so even
amidst desolation and war, there was hope. Thus began the Age of Blood.</font></p>

<p><font face="Balmoral D" size="4">T</font><font size="2">he last of the old races to
decline was the empire of the Elves. The Elddar Forest spread across the entire
southeastern quarter of Tunaria. Cities and villages built high into the trees housed
thousands of Wood Elves, and the marble cities of the High Elves were built in the
forest&#146;s clearings and meadows, their white towers and spires climbing out of the
forest, higher than the tallest tree. But then came the last curse of the gods, as Solusek
Ro, Lord of Flame, arched the spine of the serpent mountains, bringing heat from the
burning sun to the ancient forest. The rivers ran dry, it rained less each year, and while
the great elven druids fought long and hard, using their powerful magics to combat the
change, they could only delay the inevitable. Slowly the forest gave way to desert, and
eventually even great Takish-Hiz crumbled and the elves were forced to flee Tunaria,
leaving much of their greatness behind. Thus began the Lost Age.</font></p>

<p><font face="Balmoral D" size="4">T</font><font size="2">his next period of Norrathean
history as it relates to many of the races is the least known. It is surmised by the more
knowledgeable historians that while the elder races regrouped and reestablished
themselves, a small group of Barbarians were suddenly transformed both physically and
intellectually. Most believe this to be the last major and direct act of divine
intervention, and perhaps the reason so little is known about this period is that the gods
wish it to be so, deciding afterwards that they would have less to do with their
creations. In any case, this small and enlightened group were the fathers of the Human
race, and they rapidly gained a foothold throughout the lands, studying the lost art of
geomancy. The Combine Empire, as this lost race of Humans is called, spread throughout the
known world, but then died even more quickly than it grew, and for reasons still unknown.
And while they are the ancestors of every Human on Norrath and their relics and ruins
still litter the lands from Odus to Faydwer, little history of this period remains.</font></p>

<p><font face="Balmoral D" size="4">A</font><font size="2">fter the fall of the Combine
Empire, the remnants of mankind dwelled mostly in the center of Tunaria, inhabiting
primarily the vast and fertile plains of Karana. Villages appeared and prospered, several
reaching the size of towns, and two even became cities. To the west a strong and noble
band of Humans, lead by Antonius Bayle the First, founded Qeynos under the lofty
principles of law. Freeport, to the east, became an active and dangerous port of call for
all who dared to venture into the Ocean of Tears. Humanity, much to the disdain of the
elder races who watched from afar, remained strong, even daring to rename their home after
one of their own instead of one of the gods. The great continent of Tunaria would forever
more be known as Antonica. This is not to imply, however, that humanity was at peace.
Competition was fierce, and when resources grew scarce for one reason or another many
groups abandoned the promises and alliances of their past and fought. A few leaders spoke
out against the violence, urging the masses to remember why they had fled the cold north.
Others reminded them of their former glory and the might of the Combine Empire. These
leaders insisted that humanity adhere once again to those principals to which all had
agreed. Explorers and adventurers returned from afar with tales of elves, dwarves, and
other strange creatures, as well as descriptions of ancient abandoned cities. A few even
came back with limited knowledge of sorcery and the mystic arts. And when that discontent
minority of leaders heard all of this, they became both jealous and determined.</font></p>

<p><font face="Balmoral D" size="4">A</font><font size="2"> small, frail man of great
intellect called Erud led this group, and he formed them into a council. They quickly
became irritated, even disgusted, by their fellow man. Leaving a small network of spies
behind, the remainder of Erud&#146;s followers fled the city of Qeynos and boarded a small
fleet of ships. They sailed to the west and landed upon the barren coast of the island of
Odus. The land was sparse and uninhabited and quite appealing to the council and their
people. They quickly built a city of their own, dissimilar in almost every way to both
Qeynos and Freeport, for it was almost entirely a towering castle. Erudin it was called,
and within it the scribes and scholars, who called themselves High Men, gathered and
analyzed reports, captured books and scrolls, and other artifacts brought to them by their
spies. The first human mages since the Combine Empire were born &#150; wizards, sorcerers,
and enchanters occupied the great halls of Erudin and grew immensely in both power and
knowledge. Thus began the Age of Enlightenment.</font></p>

<p><font face="Balmoral D" size="4">I</font><font size="2">t came to pass some years later
that a small group of Erudites discovered the lost art of Necromancy. They were branded
heretics and great conflict arose. For the first time in several hundred years, the
Erudites fought. They engaged in a civil war not entirely dissimilar to that which they
had loathed and fled from back on the mainland. But there was one very significant
difference &#150; they did not use swords and bows, but rather magic, and the result was
terrible. Lives by the hundreds were lost, great buildings and structures destroyed, and
eventually the heretics were forced to flee Erudin, to hide and regroup in the southern
regions of Odus. In one final battle, great mystic energies were released and an immense
hole leading to unknown depths beneath the earth was created. Into the sides of this chasm
the heretics built their own city which they called Paineel. And while both sides still
seethed with anger and hatred towards one another, their fear of what the last battle had
wrought has kept any further conflict at bay. Thus began the Age of Turmoil.</font></p>

<p><font face="Balmoral D" size="4">I</font><font size="2">t is in this age you find
yourself, an age filled with wonder. The elder races have begun to reclaim their former
glory. The younger races have matured, and an active economy stretches across Odus,
Antonica, and Faydwer. And while conflict and battle is hardly rare, it has also been
centuries since open war has plagued the lands. A myriad of alliances and factions exist,
friend and foe plot and scheme, and the world of Norrath is ripe for action. </font></p>

agriculture appeared and the villages and small towns were surrounded by large farms. Most
of humanity&#146;s leaders were pleased with this, wanting nothing more than peace and
food on every man&#146;s table after a hard day of work. A few, however, wanted more. Even
though their people had risen well beyond the standard of living endured by their
barbarian brothers to the north, they were not content. Explorers and adventurers returned
from afar with tales of elves, dwarves, and other strange creatures, as well as
descriptions of ancient abandoned cities. A few even came back with limited knowledge of
sorcery and the mystic arts. And when that discontent minority of leaders heard all of
this, they became both jealous and determined. </font></strong></p>

<p><strong><font face="Balmoral D" size="4">A</font><font size="2"> small, fragile man of
great intellect called Erud led this group, and he formed them into a council. They
quickly became irritated, even disgusted, by their fellow man. Leaving a small network of
spies behind, the remainder of Erud&#146;s followers fled the city of Qeynos and boarded a
small fleet of ships. They sailed to the west and landed upon the barren coast of the
island of Odus. The land was sparse and uninhabited and quite appealing to the council and
their people. They quickly built a city of their own, dissimilar in almost every way to
both Qeynos and Freeport, for it was almost entirely a towering castle. Erudin it was
called, and within it the scribes and scholars, who called themselves High Men, gathered
and analyzed reports, captured books and scrolls, and other artifacts brought to them by
their spies. The first human mages were then born &#150; wizards, sorcerers, and
enchanters occupied the great halls of Erudin and grew immensely in both power and
knowledge. </font></strong></p>

<p><strong><font face="Balmoral D" size="4">O</font><font size="2">ne of the more adept
practitioners of the arts was named Miragul. Unlike and more extreme than the others, he
not only abhorred his human brothers on the mainland to the east, but he also grew to hate
his fellow Erudites. To him they were both short sighted and narrow. They created schools
of thought, categorizing magic into three groups and assigning themselves to three
classes: Wizards, Sorcerers, and Enchanters. Miragul found this limiting and thoroughly
resented the thought of being restricted to one school of thought or another. </font></strong></p>

<p><strong><font face="Balmoral D" size="4">H</font><font size="2">e soon found others who
felt similarly. They were a small but growing group of outcasts who often studied
forbidden texts and other knowledge generally kept secret from the majority of students.
The council was morally and ethically opposed to much of the information gathered afar by
their spies. Miragul found that these outcasts not only studied the three schools of
magic, but also a fourth. It was called Necromancy and a few lucky spies had returned from
a distant underground city (Neriak, it was called, home of the dark elves) with both their
lives and also ancient texts describing this art. Miragul was intrigued, and, by using
powerful magic, created for himself four identities, four separate countenances and names,
and joined all four schools without the knowledge of the council, nor anyone else for that
matter. </font></strong></p>

<p><strong><font face="Balmoral D" size="4">I</font><font size="2">t came to pass some
years later that the council, in its ever growing desire to know all there was to know,
both in distant lands and also in its own city, discovered the group of Necromancers. They
were branded heretics and great conflict arose. For the first time in several hundred
years, the Erudites fought. They engaged in a civil war not entirely dissimilar to that
which they had loathed and fled from back on the mainland. But there was one very
significant difference &#150; they did not use swords and bows, but rather magic, and the
result was terrible. Lives by the hundreds were lost, great buildings and structures
destroyed, and eventually the heretics were forced to flee Erudin, to hide and regroup in
the southern regions of Odus. </font></strong></p>

<p><strong><font face="Balmoral D" size="4">M</font><font size="2">iragul, being a member
of all four schools, was not blind to the implications when the conflict began. He left
the heretics before they fled the city, abandoning his fourth identity and siding
apparently with the council. But this was only a ruse in order to buy time. He soon
gathered every artifact and tome he could discreetly steal and then left Odus entirely,
taking a ship back to Antonica and to the city of Qeynos. The lands of men, however, were
not only to his dislike, but also filled with Erudite spies. Miragul grew afraid, even
paranoid, and soon fled again. He headed far to the north and then to the east, wishing to
avoid the barbarians of Halas. After many weeks he found himself near the great lake
called Winter&#146;s Deep and he hid there for some time. </font></strong></p>

<p><strong><font face="Balmoral D" size="4">W</font><font size="2">hile Miragul waited in
secret his mind was not idle. He schemed and planned, and looked over every letter of
every scroll and tome he had taken from Erudin. Time passed and his understanding and
power grew. But he was unsatisfied and a deep hunger for even more arcane knowledge ate
away at him. He soon left his hiding place and began to travel long distances in search of
more ancient texts and artifacts. His power had grown and confidence overcame his fear of
Erudite spies. Once again he cloaked himself in false identity and countenance and
traveled the lands of men. </font></strong></p>

<p><strong><font size="2">Not far to the south of where his cache of artifacts lay,
Miragul soon found another of the new races, the Halflings, and their town Rivervale. The
mage feared these small people and their propensity to sneak and to steal, and as his
treasures grew in both size and value, he eventually made the decision to move even
farther north, and away from all intelligent life. He traveled leagues and leagues, far
beyond the range of both Erudite spy and curious Halfling, and eventually came to a vast
tundra. This land had no name, and was not until centuries later referred to as merely the
Frigid Plain. This frosty and remote environment appealed to Miragul&#146;s heart, for it
had grown cold, obsessed with only knowledge and the abstract, and filled with only hatred
for others. Creatures with intelligence forced him to be discreet and slowed his
acquisition of knowledge and items. He had as little to do with them as he could, only
hiding amongst them when absolutely necessary.</font> </strong></p>

<p><strong><font face="Balmoral D" size="4">U</font><font size="2">nder the icy ground of
the Frigid Plains, Miragul created a large network of tunnels and rooms in which to hide
and study his collection. He used no labor, but rather deep magic to remove the earth from
his way. Room after room, passage after passage, he did create to house his store of
artifacts. He split his years, spending one score out in the world, exploring and amassing
knowledge and items, returning them to his cache, and then the next dabbling with them,
experimenting in one of several laboratories he had created. </font></strong></p>

<p><strong><font face="Balmoral D" size="4">M</font><font size="2">any years passed, even
centuries. Miragul grew old, even though he did his best to extend his life using magical
means. There was a limit to his enlightenment when it came to aging, and he soon
acknowledged that one day even he would die. Only one aspect of death did he fear, and
being no longer able to learn and collect wrought him with terror. As his skin grew
wrinkled, and his breath short, Miragul&#146;s time was spent less exploring the world of
Norrath and more studying the existential. He soon discovered the various hidden
dimensions that neighbored his own, the Planes of Power and Discord. He discovered means
by which he could traverse these planes, making portals that led between them. But his
strength was leaving him, and his journeys into these realities were short and often
unprofitable. More and more, his own mortality limited his reason for living, and the
specter of death haunted him daily. </font></strong></p>

<p><strong><font face="Balmoral D" size="4">T</font><font size="2">he mage&#146;s research
into life and death was built upon a foundation he had learned from his fellow outcasts
centuries before in Erudin. Necromancy, more than any other art, became Miragul&#146;s
obsession. Eventually he discovered a means by which to create portals within his own
plane and made them to travel great distances in mere seconds. He traveled back to Odus,
to its southern regions, in search of the other Necromancers. Perhaps, he mused, they had
unearthed by now a way to cheat death. </font></strong></p>

<p><strong><font face="Balmoral D" size="4">T</font><font size="2">he mage soon found that
the heretics of Erudin had built a city into a great hole that led to unknown depths
beneath the earth. This chasm was apparently the result of that huge civil war from which
Miragul had fled centuries earlier. The city, called Paineel, though somewhat suspicious,
allowed Miragul to enter and after a time he earned its inhabitant&#146;s trust. Many
humored the old man and his claims, while a select few respected him and were willing to
trade knowledge for knowledge, power for power. They revealed to him the true power of
necromancy, the ability to raise the dead, creating zombies and wraiths obedient in every
way to their master. Many of the heretics planned to assault Erudin with vast armies of
undead, to wreak revenge upon the council that had exiled and made war upon them in
centuries past. </font></strong></p>

<p><strong><font face="Balmoral D" size="4">O</font><font size="2">ne important aspect of
their necromancy interested Miragul, the fact that the undead ceased to age. Their lives
appeared endless and the elderly mage knew that he must discover a way to be like them. He
feigned interest in the heretic&#146;s goals, learning spells to raise the dead, helping
them raise their undead army. All the while, however, he was experimenting himself, hiding
much of his research in the small home he was given in Paineel. After some time he
discovered that which he had sought, a way to transform a living being, as opposed to a
corpse, into the undead. Unfortunately, time was scarce, for he was tired and almost dead
himself, his body deteriorating with age, and the heretics were almost ready to make war
once again. </font></strong></p>

<p><strong><font face="Balmoral D" size="4">M</font><font size="2">iragul then left
Paineel, using a small portion of his dwindling life energies to make a portal back to his
cache hundreds of leagues to the north. Upon arrival, he withdrew silently to his most
secret laboratory and prepared his final spell. Dreaming all the while of endless
exploration and discovery, he slowly made ready his ultimate experiment. The enchantment
laced with necromancy was finally made, and Miragul hid his remaining and fragile life
within the phylactery, a small device he had pilfered from the other necromancers. Clouds
of mystical energy gathered and then dispersed, revealing a shell of the man Miragul once
was, an undead mage, what ancient scripts and legends called a lich. </font></strong></p>

<p align="left"><strong><font face="Balmoral D" size="4">I</font><font size="2">n his
haste, however, Miragul had made a miscalculation. The lich, while retaining all the
mystical power of his formal self, lacked a spirit. Only the mage&#146;s soul, now locked
within the phylactery hidden deep in the cache, retained the ambition and desire to amass
knowledge and power. The spiritless lich possessed none of these human traits, and
Miragul&#146;s soul screamed in silence as the undead creature began to aimlessly wander
his menagerie of wisdom and enlightenment, his rooms filled with artifacts of power. </font></strong><font face="Balmoral D"></p>
