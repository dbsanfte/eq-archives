<p><em><strong>Article by: Kaun</strong></em></p>

<p><em><strong>Note to reader: This article is meant for the newbie, as a guide to the
selection of class, and as a starting point for tips on game play. It is in no way a
complete guide, and is not meant to be. My goal is to leave most of the game&#146;s
mysteries to be found by the player.</strong></em></font><font SIZE="5"></p>

<p><em><strong>Why the Barbarian Shaman?</strong></em></font></p>

<p><em><strong>Shamen in Everquest are very race specific. This character class is
available only to Trolls, Ogres, and Barbarians. As such, shaman are rare in most places,
and a valuable addition to any party.</strong></em></p>

<p><em><strong>Of these three classes, only the Barbarian is acceptable to most other
communities. So, as the most communitive and socially mobile shaman around, the Barbarian
makes a logical choice for the typical new player. However; for the more daring and/or
experienced player, Trolls and Ogres have excellent role playing potential, and probably
come with a more challenging beginning. But, Trolls and Ogres are topics for later
articles, so I won&#146;t go into them now.</strong></em></p>

<p><font SIZE="5"><em><strong>&nbsp;</strong></em></p>

<p><em><strong>The Newbie</strong></em></font></p>

<p><em><strong>Halas has all the characteristics needed to be an excellent starting
location for any player, but it also has many qualities that make it ideal for the newbie.
Its wide variety of low monster levels, all found within easy access to the city, make it
all a new player could dream for. The area outside the city includes a vast lake, where
the art of swimming may be practiced, and fishing is a favorite past time. Also on its
shores reside two vendors who have taken residence at two make-shift tents. Here a player
can buy the base necessities for battle and sell all achieved loot without the
inconvenience of entering the city.</strong></em></p>

<p><em><strong>On the other hand, it is easy to get lost if one wanders too far, so be
cautious when journeying out until you know the tundra&#146;s geography. It is advisable
to learn these landmarks as quickly as possible.</strong></em></p>

<p><em><strong>At level one especially, stick close to the guards. Combat situations can
become rather sticky in short order if you don&#146;t know what you&#146;re doing. Gnoll
pups and goblin whelps, both individually within the grasp of a first level shaman, can be
quite deadly in groups. They tend to stick together and stand up for each other, so keep a
watchful eye out when fighting. Decaying skeletons are also not too difficult to kill.
They wander about the icy landscape, often with weapons in hand, and can be handy for
swift profit.</strong></em></p>

<p><em><strong>At level two, venture further from the city, seeking more difficult
monsters. Polar bear cubs are now within your grasp if you are quick with your heal spell.
Their pelts, if undamaged, are worth gold, and their size makes them easy to hit. Woolly
spiderlings are good for experience now too, though I found them more difficult. Their
legs and silk sell for silver in most places, and silver can add up quickly. Keep killing
small monsters close to the gates until level three or four, then for the best efficiency,
join a party.</strong></em></p>

<p><font SIZE="5"><em><strong>&nbsp;</strong></em></p>

<p><em><strong>Spells</font> </strong></em></p>

<p><em><strong>Spells are the stock and trade of a shaman. Without them, the shaman is
little more than meat for any monster. Buy spells as soon as you can, and as often as you
can, no matter how inconvenient it may seem. The repetitive &quot;save money, buy spell,
save money&quot; cycle may seem redundant, but when your spellbook is full and monsters
topple before your arsenal of spells, it becomes worth it. Armor and weapons are tempting
prospects, but they are only to be seen as secondary tools. Spells are the strength of a
wise shaman, and they should be used with great care.</strong></em></p>

<p><em><strong>The most important spells to the shaman are those that focus on defense.
Spells that heal or modify stats and abilities are the shaman&#146;s forte. Keep a good
number of these spells memorized, especially in a party. They can make a large difference
when layered upon an already tough warrior. Do not; however, neglect the healing spells.
Spells of this type should priority over all else in group combat. Shaman are most widely
sought for their healing, and secondarily for their modifying spells. Concentrate on both,
but remember that the best healing shaman is the most useful.</strong></em></p>

<p><em><strong>In addition to defense, shamen receive a small supply of offensive spells.
These spells are nice supplements to combat, but should only be used in small parties or
in one-on-one combat. In a large party, the offensive spells in a shaman&#146;s book are
mostly a waste of mana. Leave major spell damage to the magi classes, and heal where they
cannot.</strong></em></p>

<p><font SIZE="5"><em><strong>&nbsp;</strong></em></p>

<p><em><strong>The Party</strong></em></font></p>

<p><em><strong>Grouping is, in my opinion, one of the best qualities of Everquest. The
social interaction (even the sarcasm) and the ability to wallop many monsters that would
previously have thorough stomped a lone shaman are among its best and most obvious
advantages. A varied group is best, as each class brings its advantages with it, and can
share these among the other members.</strong></em></p>

<p><em><strong>One example of a well rounded party includes the following categories:
tanks, artillery, and medics. The &quot;tanks&quot; (or bullet sponges, if you prefer) of
the party should be the characters who can take the most damage, and are experts in doing
so. Tanks are most commonly warriors, as they have the highest hit points, but are not
necessarily limited to them. Wizards and other members of the magi classes, make up the
&quot;artillery&quot; of a party, dealing out massive damage to the enemy from behind the
safety of the tanks. &quot;Medics&quot; also stand behind the front line. This category is
exclusive to clerics and shamen. Medics are responsible primarily for keeping the tanks
and artillery healthy and pumped for battle, and secondarily for adding supplementary
damage to the fray through armed combat. Though there is some blurring of the categories
in places (i.e. a cleric acting as artillery when a new offensive spell is gained or
taking hits if a warrior is severely injured), the party system works best with a
character or characters specialized in each.</strong></em></p>

<p><font SIZE="5"><em><strong>&nbsp;</strong></em></p>

<p><em><strong>The Shaman&#146;s Role</strong></em></font></p>

<p><em><strong>The shaman should stay in the background of the fighting, hitting the
monsters as often as possible without attracting their attention away from the
&quot;tanks&quot; of the party. The shaman is a medic, as described above, and every bit
as valuable as the other categories. Keep a close eye on the health of the character
taking damage, making a point of keeping his health high. This is to give the tank
confidence in his position and in his medical support. If his health slips too low, he
will be inclined to run, leaving the rest of the party in a vulnerable position.</strong></em></p>

<p><em><strong>Healing the tank allows the fight to extend in duration, which in turn
allows more damage to be done by all members of the party. Be aware; though, that monsters
hate healers, and love to get there claws on them when they least suspect it. Each time
you heal a character that is being attacked by a monster, it is the rough equivalent of a
direct assault doing a greater or equal amount of damage to the monster. Imagine that the
monster has &quot;hate points.&quot; Healing the person it is attempting to kill adds up
in the monsters &quot;hate point&quot; balance sheet, and if you generate more hate points
that the character the monster is attacking, it will turn on you.</strong></em></p>

<p><em><strong>In cases like this, where healing is needed often, it is sometimes a good
idea not to be attacking the monster with supplementary damage. A shaman can even go into
a mana restoring meditation out of the monster&#146;s range, coming conscious long enough
to heal the tank in need. This allows for a greater amount of healing, and can sometimes
be more useful to a party over time than the damage a shaman might dish out in physical
combat.</strong></em></p>

<p><em><strong>One final point on grouping. It is best to cast all modifying spells before
entering combat. Do as many of these as are practical for a situation, even if that means
memorizing and then forgetting. They can really make the difference between a win and a
loss in some cases. Take a few minutes to recuperate, then rally for the battle.</strong></em></p>
<font SIZE="5">

<p><em><strong>Have Fun!</strong></em></font></p>

<p><em><strong>There is one rule above all others in Norrath. Call it the golden rule if
you want, as it applies to all characters and classes: have fun. Remember that you are
playing a game, and that the people you play it with are real. Help them to have a good
time too, it will come back to you some day when you need it. The people are what make
Everquest new and different. In order to enjoy this game to its fullest, make friends and
enjoy them. They are what make Everquest a timeless experience. Go forth and explore the
wonders of this new world!</strong></em></p>
