top of a peak in Lough Foyle, contemplating and looking over the four quarters of the
world, it seemed to him that he saw a shadow and a likeness of a land far away from him.
Eyre, went back to his father, and told them what he had seen; and said that he was
mindful and desirous of going to see the land that had appeared to him. Aelle, said that
it was no land he had seen but clouds of heaven, and he was hindering Eyre from going on
the expedition. Eyre did not consent to stay, however. </strong></em></p>

    <p><em><strong>Then Eyre, brought his boat on the sea, arriving on the land called
Antonica, taking harbor near what is now called the Frigid Plains. Eyre went to the shore
in search of local inhabitants, and each of them told news to the other in the Irish
language. Eyre asked them the name of the land to which he had come, and who was in
authority over it. &quot;Halas ,&quot; they said and we are ruled by Miragul, and his
hordes of Ice Giants who do his bidding. </strong></em></p>

    <p><em><strong>Soon , there after Miragul appeared, having heard of a stranger in his
realm, and ordered his pet to kill the young lad . Eyre escaped only to find that his boat
had been destroyed by some unknown deamon. </strong></em></p>

    <p><em><strong>Eyre, knowing this was the land he had seen, and knowing well it was a land
of dreams swore that he would put an end to the life of Miragul, and his minions of evil. </strong></em></font></p>
