to the chat server being down for a long period of time on the day of the event many of
those who wanted to attend were not able to (even the new chief was only able to log on 10
minutes after the event was supposed to have taken place).&nbsp; So by the time we had a
fairly good number of people show up it was too late to have the competitions we had
planned.&nbsp; So, we canceled them and headed for a tavern to get trashed.&nbsp; Even in
special events like this one we have to remember that it is beta and just be thankful that
we are able to experience this wondrous world early.

&nbsp; &nbsp; <BIG><font face="Balmoral D">I</font></big>n celebration of Tormod being
elected Chief we all met in McQuaid's Dark Stout (a tavern in Halas), where Shatara stood
on a table and honored the new chief with an appropriate poem
[ <a href="../images/party/tavern.jpg" target="_blank"><B>screenshot 1</B></a> ].&nbsp; Here is
Shatara's poem:
<blockquote>
      <FONT SIZE=-1>In the dark stormy night the wind does howl.<br>
  The driven snow is blinding and the cold is mighty foul.<br>
  From across the frozen tundra comes the sound of battle.<br>
  Brave sons and daughters of Halas showing their mettle. <br>
  Weapons clash and sparks fly. <br>
  Magic crackles and lights up the sky.<br>
  The mighty and the strong wage their war for all of us.<br>
  Hail to them! Hail to thee! Hail to Halas!<br>
  &nbsp; &nbsp; - Shatara, Poet of MacLear</font>
    </blockquote>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <big><font face="Balmoral D">A</font></big>fter
the poetry, we began buying each other ale, whiskey and beer.&nbsp; Not only did we get
drunk [ <a href="../images/party/drunk1.jpg" target="_blank"><B>screenshot 2</B></a> ], but we got
really drunk [ <a href="../images/party/drunk2.jpg" target="_blank"><B>screenshot 3</B></a> ].&nbsp;
The situation really began to go down hill after the first 6 drinks or so.&nbsp; Daran,
the clan gnome, &nbsp;started a brawl with Ikar (Daran's pretty barbaric for a gnome -
that's why we like him).&nbsp; This caused McQuaid, the bar owner to get very pissed and
he proceeded to beat the living snot out of Daran.&nbsp; That was the first time the
little guy died.&nbsp; We all cried over Daran's corpse but were too drunk to stay sad for
long.&nbsp; Unfortunately, after becoming so smashed that we could no longer make it
through the door without hitting the door post we decided to go outside
[ <a href="../images/party/drunkoutside.jpg"><B>screenshot 4</B></a> ].&nbsp; Too bad for us, the Halas
well is positioned right outside the door of McQuaid's so most of our drunken band wound
up in the water [ <a href="../images/party/well_advice.jpg" target="_blank"><B>screenshot 5</B></a> ].
&nbsp; Daran had returned to us by this time and died a second and a third time by
drowning in the well (swimming and grain alcohol do not mix well).&nbsp; Nosferum, Ikar,
and even our new chief nearly drowned as well but fortunately sobered up enough to climb
out of the well at the last minute.&nbsp; For the poor drunk sods trapped in the well, it
was a terrifying experience.&nbsp; For those smart enough not to fall in it was absolutely
hilarious entertainment!
<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <big><font face="Balmoral D">A</font></big>fter everyone had either
climbed out or been fished out of the well we went to the Pit of Doom for the ceremonial
crowning of the chief [ <a href="../images/party/comedown.jpg" target="_blank"><B>screenshot 6</B></A>
- Daran calling Tormod up to face the onlookers ].&nbsp; To everyone's amazement Daran
presented Tormod with the &quot;Helm of Lear&quot; that, according to Legend, has been
passed down through the generations from Lord Lear himself
[ <a href="../images/party/cheering.jpg" target="_blank"><B>screenshot 7</B></A> - the crowd responds to
the presentation of the Helm of Lear ].&nbsp; Congratulations, Chief Tormod!&nbsp; All
Hail MacLear!&nbsp; All Hail the <a href="../images/party/chieftormod.jpg"><B>Chief</B></a> of
MacLears!

[ed; - The story of attaining the crown was actually my favorite part, but it was never mentioned before.
Back in very early release, Tormod was quite a purist for roleplay. He rarely said anything out of
character-- even in private /tells. He contacted Kahlan and me (Nosferum) asking our assistance in avenging
Lord Lear. Of course, we were honored. The three of us met at the West Gate of Freeport and he gave us
the plan. "See tha' guard in there? 'e was part of the group that stole Lord Lear's Helm. You lure 'im,
Nos, and Kahlan and I will kill 'im." Now, we were each levels 13, 11 and 11, so picking out a single
guard from the gates of Freeport was suicide. Also, at that time, no one had ever imagined killing a guard
of any sort-- particularly a Freeport guard. Well, I died, but we killed him. you see, at that time the guards
of Freeport dropped a helm called a "Cracked *something*" that looked like a Bronze Helm. That early
in the game the only players that had Bronze looking armor were the small races, so it was quite an
achievement, visually.]
