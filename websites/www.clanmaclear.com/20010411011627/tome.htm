<blockquote>
  <p align="left"><small><strong><i>In hushed voices, those who will speak of it will say
  that in the time of our grandfathers' grandfathers there came through our lands an ancient
  and powerful user of terrible death magiks.&nbsp; Everything that he touched was drained
  of life and withered.&nbsp; Many of our clan were lost or withered in the terrible and
  strange battle with the Twisted One. &nbsp; After losing many of our kin, the Twisted One
  tired of our tireless pursuit of him and traveled deeper into the heart of the frozen
  wasteland that is Everfrost.&nbsp; Years after his passage an ancient and worn tome of
  writings was found near a cave, deep in the wastelands.&nbsp; The MacLear shamans
  determined that the book was not of our ken and understanding and must have come from
  beyond our lands.&nbsp; It is believed to have once belonged to the Twisted One.</i></strong></small></p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong><i><small>After many years of research and study,&nbsp; a wise Monk
  named Nosferum&nbsp; was able to translate much of
  what remained of the tome.&nbsp; The contents of the tome are said to have the power to
  twist and ruin all but the most stout of heart and mind.&nbsp; Thus, the High Council
  keeps the contents safe from prying eyes, even from fellow MacLears who have not yet
  reached two hands of ability.</small><br>
  <small>- Quote from the <a href="frmmac.htm">History of the Clan MacLear</a></small></i></strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p><em><strong><small>The Tome is said to contain much of Norrathian Lore and Secrets of
Magik. &nbsp; Few who have made themselves aware of its contents have been
unaffected.
&nbsp; There are said to be secrets contained within that even some of the gods are not
aware of.&nbsp; Before entering, you must decide if you are willing to know the secrets.
&nbsp; Often, secrets are best left covered in the Snows of Time.</small></strong></em></p>

<p><em><strong><small>If you choose to discover those secrets that are recorded in the
Twisted Tome, you must be given access by a member of The High Council.&nbsp; To be
granted access you must be a Kinsman or Kinswoman who has&nbsp; completed the Quest of
Stone, of four hands experience and&nbsp; have made a request for access to the High
Council and that request be approved by the Chief. You must
also swear never to reveal what you read to others (the Council does not wish to be held
responsible for warping innocents with the Power of the Tome).&nbsp; Any MacLear who
reveals these secrets will be Banished.</small></strong></em></p>
