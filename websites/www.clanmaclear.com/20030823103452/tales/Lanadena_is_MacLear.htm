  <tr>
    <td><i>Meditating on recent events, Lanadena's head fills with images of
      other Clan MacLear spiritual leaders. The first powerful High Shamaness
      that Lanadena knew was Jalia Wolfsdottir.<br>
      <br>
      Jalia was schooled in the ancient art of alchemy. Polar bear skins, zombie
      skins and other items of nature assisted in her craft. Lanadena had not
      tasted her potions, but knew they were reputed to have been concocted with
      care and precision. Jalia was always ready for a dance or two if the
      proper occasion arose.<br>
      <br>
      The second High Shaman that Lanadena knew was Graack. When Lanadena met
      Graack, he was younger than she... it was as if someone had cast a slumber
      spell upon Lanadena and when she awoke, everyone she knew had gotten
      older. Graack had aged several hands when he was given the title of High
      Shaman. The spirits spoke to him and troubled him. Though not as
      light-hearted as Jalia, he could dispense wisdom and read the runes.<br>
      <br>
      After Graack was spirited away, Clan MacLear was without a High Shaman for
      many moons. Lanadena was then given the title of High Shamaness and
      invited into the High Council of Tormod. She tried to take care of
      spiritual and physical matters regarding the her family. Many nights she
      found herself in talks, offering advice to her brethren. On hunts she
      found herself providing blessings and healing poultices. On joyful
      occasions she found herself offering food. As a spiritual leader, Lanadena
      felt it was appropriate to know the languages of Norrath so she could read
      journal entries in lost crypts and converse with those that wished to
      contact her family yet did not know the native Barbarian tongue.<br>
      <br>
      Lanadena's breathing returns to normal. Standing and walking across her
      quarters, Lanadena pours crystal clear water from The Nest into her wash
      basin. Looking into the water, Lanadena sees her reflection. Gone is the
      raven hair with a lock of grey. Now her hair is a warm dark brown with no
      hint of grey at all. It is as if she has gotten younger... only her eyes
      belie her age. Lanadena is unsure what caused such a transformation in
      her. Her silver eyes look at her family and Norrath as though seeing them
      for the first time.<br>
      <br>
      When the MacLears viking'd to Midgard of Percival, Lanadena was named
      Steward and given the authority to act on behalf of Clan MacLear's Chief.
      Lanadena kept in contact with her Brothers and Sisters that made the
      journey to Midgard. All seemed to be prospering and doing well. Radu, who
      had once courted the Teir'Dal with poems and flowers, returned to Norrath
      from time to time but was different. The druid of Tunare was now older,
      with grey and silver hair.<br>
      <br>
      Tormod had spent much of his time in the MacLear castle and had not been
      seen by many. When he next showed himself to the MacLears, his beard,
      which had once been light brown, with some grey, had turned. His hair,
      once light brown, had also gone grey as well. Always a handsome man,
      Tormod seemed even more handsome.<br>
      <br>
      Touching her fingers, lightly, to the water, her image shimmered. Replaced
      was the image of Tormod MacLear, her Laird. On their last meeting, he
      transferred the mantle of authority to her. Souly, who was the only wolf
      Lanadena knew to transform himself into a druid, was witness to the event.
      The fishing village in Western Karanas, where Lanadena's father had
      perished, was a fitting place for such an event. This man that she saw,
      Tormod, had loved her like a father. Past and present came together for a
      moment. Her father's spirit was on one side of her, Tormod standing in
      front of her, and Souly standing to her other side. The McMannus' clan,
      whose livelihood was built on her father's blood, watched solemnly what
      transpired that day. It was then, that Lanadena finally took a surname.<br>
