<p><strong><em><small>The Clan MacLear is a <a href="http://www.everquest.com/">EverQuest</a>
guild dedicated to Halas and their kinsmen.&nbsp; Our purpose is to
enrich the fame and fortune of the Clan to defend Halas from the dangers of
Norrath and to offer service to make the world of Norrath a better place to
adventure.
&nbsp; We do this by knitting the loyalties and strengths of our individual members into
something larger than themselves, the Clan MacLear.&nbsp; We honor the gods of Justice,
Valor,&nbsp; and War above all others.&nbsp; We also pay homage to the primal forces of
nature: Fire, Water, Earth, and Air.</small></em></strong></p>

<p><strong><em><small>Our guild is based on the premise that the Clan MacLear is a large
extended family founded by Lord Lear and the people that he led from another Time/Place
(see <a href="frmmac.htm#Clan MacLear">History of the Clan MacLear</a>).&nbsp; Over time,
the Clan has &quot;adopted&quot; members of other races as they were stranded in Halas,
came to the Clan for help, aided the Clan in some way, or otherwise positively interacted
with the Clan through in-character means.</small></em></strong></p>

<p><small><strong><em>As we value Justice, we live by a set of <a href="#Rules">laws</a>.
&nbsp; To enforce these laws and to protect our weaker members from criminals we have a <a href="#Ranks and Titles">rank structure</a>.</em></strong></small></p>

<p><small><em><strong>The <a href="images/tormod3.jpg" target="_blank">Chief</a> (Art by
Nosferum): <br>
There is only one Chief.&nbsp; This person is said to be the spiritual descendant of Lord
Lear and has the mandate of the gods to lead Lear's people.&nbsp; Only the Chief may Banish a Council Person from
the Clan.&nbsp; The Chief may overrule all but a Unanimous vote of The High Council.</strong></em></small></p>

<p><em><strong><small>The High Council:<br>
All Thanes are, by right, members of the High Council. Others may be appointed
by the Chief. All members of the High Council serve at the pleasure of the Chief
who may remove them without cause. In Matters
of Council, the Council Person's word is second only to the Chief.&nbsp; A Council Person
may Admit petitioners into the Clan after permission has been granted by the
chief or by </small><small>unanimous</small><small> vote of the Council.&nbsp; They may also Banish members from the Clan with
a majority vote.&nbsp; The Council may enact Laws by Majority vote.</small></strong></em></p>

<p><em><strong><small>Thane:<br>
Thanes have the right to be leaders of a Sept (a sub-division of the Clan) and may be given
lordship over a zone or zones by the Chief. Thanes are appointed and serve at
the pleasure of the Chief.</small></strong></em></p>

<p><em><strong><small>Noble:<br>
A Noble is a Kinsman or Kinswoman who has proved his or her strength and courage by
achieving four hands of ability, completing the Quest of Fire to the
satisfaction of the Chief or the Council and been appointed as such.&nbsp; A Noble is rarely denied audience with the Chief or
with the High Council and is normally given a position of authority in the Sept.</small></strong></em></p>

<p><em><strong><small>Kinsman / Kinswoman:<br>
A Kinsman or Kinswoman is a Lad or Lass who is a member in good standing of a
Sept,&nbsp; has completed the Quest of Stones and has
reached two hands of ability as well as received the endorsement of his or her
Thane.&nbsp; A Kinsman or Kinswoman must wait their turn at Council
meetings and is sometimes visited by the Chief's attentions.&nbsp; A Kinsman or Kinswoman
may view the Twisted Tome. Kin may only be removed from the Clan by the Chief
for high crimes against the Clan and the name MacLear.</small></strong></em></p>

<p><em><strong><small>Lad / Lass:<br>
A Lad or Lass is one who has sworn fealty to the Chief of
the Clan MacLear and been accepted to probationary membership in the Clan by the
Chief or his appointed officer. &nbsp;A thane, subject to appeal to the Chief,
may remove a Lad or Lass from the guild without formal process. Each should have
a designated Thane who is responsible for the training and promotion of the
Lad/Lass.</small></strong></em></p>
