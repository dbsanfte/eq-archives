Under the care of his devout father, Rex grew into a strong young lad in the harsh and violent wilderness.  As fates would have it, his father was killed and his clan was destroyed by the Gnolls when he was but three winters old.  Out of kindness, the Shaman of Justice took in the orphaned youngster, and Rex has followed the paths of the Tribunal (The Seven Hammers) with faith and determination ever since.<br>
<br>
Some of those people closest to him have found that his faith and determination borders on fanaticism.  He has been a loner most of his life, having very few friends (partly due to the fact that he was an orphan and partly because of his faith – he often found that his friends were hypocrites and this often resulted in confrontations and loss of friendships).  Because of high tensions in the guild house, his mentor urged him to journey off into the world to find his own path.  His mentor suggested that he find the path of the Heyokah because there he may find peace and happiness.<br>
<br>
It was a sad day for Rex on the day of his leaving Halas.  He was young, only a shaman of the 9th circle and untried in many ways.  He decided that he would first seek the fabled city of men, Freeport.  No one in Halas knew where Freeport was, but the bard in the bank told him that he should try asking in the city of Qeynos, far to the south.  When he left, all who knew him consigned him to death, as they did not expect him to be able to pass the Gnolls of Black Burrow.</td></tr></table><table width='100%' cellspacing=1><tr><td valign=top id=MsgBoardGroupNameTD width=150><center><font color=white>Tedara</font><br><font size=1>9/6/02 1:15:17 PM</font><br><img align=center src='ImageWrite.asp?Name=Tedara' width=100 height=100 border=0></img></td><td valign=top align=left id=MsgBoardGroupName2TD><center><font color=white><b>RE:Characters Sketches</b></font></center><hr>Teddi's story is taking a bit longer to shape up than I thought...

 "Oh, ok." the father chuckled.<br>
 The youngster settled into his bed as his father recited the story.<br>
<br>
<br>
  It was a cold winter night, and the storm from the North threatened the small vilage in the Qeynos Hills. Over the screetch of the mailstrom, the squall of a newborn pierced the air. She was hungry, but there was no one left alive to feed her. How the ravaging band of Snow Orcs missed her was beyond the realm of mortal kind. For this girl-child bore the birthmark of Rodcet Nife. The storm lulled breifly, as if calmed by a unseen hand, as an old woman reaches down and lifts the small bundle.<br>
 "My Lord!" she spoke into the storm. "What shall I do with this child?"<br>
 A light musical voice came from the wind, "Raise her in my way, teach her the art."<br>
 "Yes my Lord." the woman nodded.<br>
 "And what name shall she be hailed by?" she asked the storm.<br>
 The voice softened slightly. " She is the incarnation of my daughters' will, name her Azreale!"<br>
 "She has come from the storm and in time she will strike back at her enemies like a hammer to the forge." the voice in the storm stated.<br>
 The strange voice lifted inside the fury of the storm. " Let her be known as Azreale Stormhammer!, Daughter of Rodcet Nife!"<br>
 The old woman nodded once again. " As be your will, My Lord."<br>
<br>
 The voice spoke again. "Go quickly, I can no longer upset the balance, this storm must flow, and another needs my intervention, for these two are destened."<br>
 "Go" it commanded. Then in a softer voice said. "You have little time!"<br>
<br>
 The old woman held the small bundle close and ran through the storm to her small cave. <br>
<br>
 The storm that night was the worst ever remembered, even by the old ones. It races across the hills and frosted the gnoll lair of Blackborrow. It raged until it reached the towering peaks of Everfrost.<br>
 <br>
 And in the the wailing of the storm, a small girl could be heard...<br>
<br>
 "Papa?, Papa?, Where are you?...<br>
<br>
The old Hobbit glanced at his sleeping son, he got up, kissed him gently.<br>
<br>
 "Sleep well, Diddally my son"<br>

<br>
--------------------------------<br>
<br>
Sinking into a small boneless heap in front of the roaring fire, the slight brunette smiled a silent thank you to the buxom barmaid who handed her a steaming draught of Halas Heaters and then closed her eyes.  Gripping the mug tightly, she struggled to take a sip as her overstrained muscles protested the slightest movement.  Taking a fortifying breath, she slung back her head and gulped down the steaming contents.  The mug empty, she floated along in her sea of exhaustion.<br>
<br>
Somewhere in the back of her mind, she knew she was supposed to be doing something, but she just… couldn’t… concentrate… on what.  Even as her weary body tried to catch a few minutes of much needed sleep, her subconscious reviewed the day’s drills.  Swing, slash, kick… turn, punch, hack, taunt… switch hands, swing, slash, kick… duck, turn, punch… Repeat… No sire… I’m not goofing off.  Yes sire… I understand the word slam.  No sire… it doesn’t appear that it’s working for me.  Swing, slash, kick… turn, punch, hack, taunt… switch hands, swing, slash, kick… duck, turn, punch… Rep…<br>
<br>
At the cruel hand clenching her shoulder, the young girl leaped to her feet and braced herself for an assault.  Seeing Orndorff the Brute, her defensive stance relaxed a notch as she looked at the much larger man with wary eyes.<br>
<br>
“Lazing away the day, lass?’ he barked while stepping closer to her, crowding her against the wall, close but not quite touching her.<br>
<br>
‘No, milord, merely warming up a few minutes before continuing on,’ she responded, her dark eyes flashing at the blatant intimidation attempt.<br>
<br>
‘When are you going to give up this foolishness?’ he growled, his hands balling into fists.<br>
<br>
‘I fear I require but a few minutes more to warm up,’ she responded, purposefully misunderstanding his question.<br>
<br>
He blinked at her a few seconds before erupting in a tirade of cuss words ending by spitting ‘You’ll have the Gnolls believing we’re producing nothing but puny weaklings such as yourself’ inches from her face.<br>
<br>
As calmly as she could, the girl slowly wiped the spittle from her face and through clenched teeth, she said in a sugary voice, ‘Then surely we would have the element of surprise on our side, sire, should the Gnolls dare invade Halas.’<br>
<br>
Toe to toe they stood.  The large warrior goading the young recruit, taunting with the reasons why she should quit and take up an easier career, say baker or seamstress, and the small girl cheerfully explaining all the ways she could aid in the defense of their beloved icy homeland.<br>
<br>
‘Lass, you can’t even slam an opponent, what makes you think you can be a part of the Wolves of the North?’<br>
<br>
‘Sire, I may be the smallest recruit to come before the Clan, but I am more fleet of foot and can see far better than the oldest, most seasoned warrior such as yourself.’<br>
<br>
‘What good is that when you can’t find your way from her to yon without getting lost?’<br>
<br>
As the girl though fast and furiously for a clever response, the barmaid called out in a loud voice, ‘Tedara, your brother looks for you.  Don’t keep him waiting, lass.’<br>
<br>
At this, Tedara turned to her tormentor and smiled sweetly.  ‘I hope we can continue this discussion at a later time.  As you heard… my brother awaits.’  With those words, she purposely brushed by the seething male, smiled yet another thank you to the barmaid and pushed through the outer doors to seek out her brother at their residence.<br>
<br>
Walking briskly through the snow, she finally remembered that she had received word during the noon drills to seek out her brother once they were done.  Ducking under the flurry of snowballs being tossed by some of her friends, she scrambled around the corner and up to the modest lodging situated at the end of the lane.<br>
<br>
Bursting through the doors, she called out for her brother, ‘Azrealean, I’m home.  Where are ye?’  A faint response had her moving deeper into the house towards the great room.<br>
<br>
Standing before the roaring fire, legs spread, arms crossed over his massive chest, he did not say anything when she first entered the room.  Seeing her brother staring into the fire, she went to his side and held her hands out to the flames.<br>
<br>
‘Azrealean, what is it?  What troubles ye?’<br>
<br>
After a few long minutes, he turned his face to her, looking at her closely with his one good eye.  ‘Lass, I hear you are having problems with your training.’<br>
<br>
At his words, her heart sank at the thought of letting down her beloved brother.  ‘Tis nothing,’ she said fiercely, ‘I’m just not able to slam like everyone else.  I just need to work harder.’<br>
<br>
‘Tedara, they are saying that you lack the ability to be a warrior.  That you could not defend yourself against our enemies.’<br>
<br>
Swallowing hard to keep the hurt from showing, she said in a small voice, ‘And you, brother, what do you think?’<br>
<br>
Looking down from his great height, he assessed her with a critical eye.  ‘Tedara, lass… you don’t even come halfway up my chest… even I wonder if you could take down a warrior such as myself.’<br>
<br>
Dark eyes challenged the pale blue one.  ‘And if I could take you down, brother?’ she asked quietly, hands clenched at her sides and her weight shifting.<br>
<br>
Azrealean grinned at her indulgently, noting her attempt at a threatening stance.  ‘Little sister, you are still too young to think you could do battle with me… even by surprise.  I don’t want you to get hurt.’<br>
<br>
The next thing the seasoned warrior knew, he was flat on his back… his little sister’s knee at his throat, effectively pinning him down, her fist drawn back for a crushing blow.  Before he could blink, her arm shot forward, but instead of a blow to his head, she flicked his nose and in a husky voice said, ‘I win.’<br>
<br>
With her knee still at his throat, Azrealean roared with booming laughter and managed to choke out the words, ‘Well done, lil one, well done.’<br>
<br>
Hopping off him, Tedara grinned happily at the surprise she had seen in his eye and the approval she saw now.  ‘Now then, Azrealean, mayhap now you’ll believe your sister can follow in her mighty brother’s footsteps.’<br>
<br>
Sitting up gingerly touching his throat, he coughed suddenly and in a serious voice said, ‘Aye, lass… that was the reason I wished to speak with ye.’<br>
<br>
Tedara had the sudden urge to flee the room at the odd expression she saw on his face.  ‘What is it, brother?  Are you leaving once more?’<br>
<br>
‘Yes, Teddi, Lysbeth wants me to run a scouting expedition in Black Burrow.  The Gnolls appear to be massing there more so than normal.’<br>
<br>
It wasn’t the news about their sworn enemies that caused the young girl to pale; rather, it was the use of her nickname… the one he reserved for deathly sick times… that had her heart beating furiously.  ‘And this is different from the other times, how…?’ she asked hesitantly.<br>
<br>
He sat so still, not even blinking, that Tedara began to worry that perhaps she had slammed his head on the floor too hard during the demonstration of her abilities.<br>
<br>
‘It’s hard to say, lass,’ he finally said breaking the silence, ‘I just don’t have a good feeling about this… and… and it aches.’<br>
<br>
Her startled gasp punctuated his statement.  The news that his empty eye socket pained him was surely a bad omen.  Some said it was the shock of losing his left eye to a raging mammoth at such an early age.  Others whispered of his parentage, but everyone agreed that the gift of sight was normally passed from shaman father to son, not from shaman mother.  Whatever the cause, whenever Azrealean’s eye socket ached and he had a ‘feeling’, no one ignored the warning.<br>
<br>
Tedara looked carefully at her brother, noting the crinkled brow and the eye that wouldn’t quite meet hers.  While she was many seasons younger than him, he never tried to shield her, but rather had spoken to her as if she were his equal.  ‘What else is there, my brother?’ she queried sensing something still left unsaid.<br>
<br>
He sighed heavily, closed his eye for a brief moment, and then motioned her close to him.  When she dropped to the floor and scooted over to his side, he placed a heavily muscled arm around her slim shoulders and sighed again.<br>
<br>
‘Azrealean, you’re making me verra nervous,’ she said quietly.<br>
<br>
Finally he spoke in a husky voice so low that Tedara had to lean closer to hear, ‘Teddi, lass… it’s been the two of us for such a long time… you know you’re the most important person in my life… nothing would ever make me less than proud to call you sister…’<br>
<br>
‘You found out it was I who honeyed Bandl and Bonn’s helms, didn’t you?’ she confessed.<br>
<br>
Her words startled a low chuckle from him, and he latched on gratefully to the distraction.  ‘So, it WAS you.  I had feared as much when I heard of the occurrence.’<br>
<br>
She grinned at him unrepentantly, ‘Well, they were always buzzing around me during drills.  I figured they were missing their honey.’<br>
<br>
He shook his head slowly, giving her his sternest look, ‘Lass, one of these days that sense of humor of your is going to land you in trouble…’<br>
<br>
‘If my mouth doesn’t do it first,’ she finished the familiar sentence for him with a devilish grin and laughing eyes.<br>
<br>
Seeing the conversation getting away from him, he coughed and tried to get back to the task at hand.  ‘Tedara, sister of my heart, what is your earliest memory?’<br>
<br>
Her brow furrowed at the odd question, but she turned her thoughts back in time, past her first sword, past the days when she ran around Everfrost delivering tonic to warm her brother’s friends, to the shadowy figures that were her parents.  ‘I remember a soft, gentle voice and big hands that made me feel so safe,’ she finally answered.<br>
<br>
Taking a fortifying breath, he decided to just spit out his news.  ‘Tedara, the Tribunal demands that you be told now that you are nearing your 10th season.  Lass, have you ever wondered why you are so much smaller than me?  Why you can’t see to slam no matter how hard you try?  Why I wouldn’t allow anyone else to begin your training but me?’<br>
<br>
Fighting against the panic that coursed through her body, she answered in a small voice, ‘No, brother… I thought I had yet to hit my growth spurt like you had at 12 seasons.  I don’t practice hard enough to slam right, and I thought you wanted to be close to me…’<br>
<br>
Sighing deeply, he responded, ‘Lass, I was already more than a head taller than you when I was your age.  My growth spurt was more out than up… Teddi, the truth is you were not born unto the Stormraider clan nor are you even part of the Barbarian race.  I found you as an infant in Black Burrow.  All that remained of those with you were broken wagons, tattered clothes and you tucked in a crevasse in the wall.  I only found you because I heard cooing and found you trying to push away the leaves that had covered ye.’<br>
Tedara sat there not responding, no blinking, no swallowing, nothing…<br>
<br>
‘Lass, you will always be my sister regardless of your true parentage.  My parents adopted you as their own when I returned to Halas with you and loved you fiercely while they lived.  When they were killed by Ice Giants but a few months after you joined the family, the Tribunal agreed to allow me to continue to raise you.’<br>
<br>
Tedara slowly turned to face Azrealean and in the most muted voice he had ever heard asked, ‘I am not your sister?  But then, to whom do I belong?’<br>
<br>
Crushing her to his side in a hard hug, he growled fiercely, “Teddi, you will ALWAYS be my little sister.’<br>

When the news finally began to sink in, her body quivered as if she had been found in a snow bank.  Pulling her onto his lap, he rocked her like he had done so many seasons before.  Softly brushing her hair from his face, he continued, ‘Lass, it was never our intention to keep this information to ourselves.  As soon as you reached 10 seasons, we were to journey to Qeynos, where it is believed you are originally from.<br>
<br>
At this, her slender form started violently, and he continued in a soothing voice, ‘Not to leave you there, little sister, but to see if you had blood relatives who continued to search for you.  Do you really believe I would give you up so easily?  Why, half the town would have my head if I returned without you.’<br>
<br>
‘Aye, but the rest would be happy to see me gone,’ she muttered grumpily.<br>
<br>
He laughed and gave her another squeeze while ignoring her complaints of bruised ribs.  “Bah, you keep them on their toes and they know it.’<br>
<br>
‘Does everyone know?’ she asked once she felt she could breath again.<br>
<br>
“Aye, lass, most everyone.  You’re just not the same size as most of the town.  And why do you think the bardmaids and merchants are always pressing something warm in your hands?  It’s verra apparent that you’re always cold.’<br>
<br>
Her snort of disgust was her only comment.<br>
<br>
‘Teddi, when I return from Black Burrow, you should be ready to journey to Qeynos, and we will face whatever is there together.’<br>
<br>
She squeezed his arm in agreement and promised herself to train even harder while he was gone.<br>
<br>
‘One last thing, lass, I know you normally just stay here by yourself while I’m gone, but I would feel better if you went and stayed with Alferic, one of the elders.  I’m not sure how long this mission will be, and I wouldn’t put it past Orndorff and the others to goad you while I’m gone.’<br>
<br>
Her exasperated sigh had him rushing on with, ‘To make it up to you, we’ll even go to Oasis after we stop in Qeynos.  That’s one of the hottest places I can think of… I’m sure you’ll love it.’<br>
<br>
‘I will do as you bid me, brother, but I hope you are not gone verra long.’<br>
<br>
As Tedara continued to lean against her brawny brother, she swore she heard him mutter something about hoping that Alferic could keep her in line.<br>
