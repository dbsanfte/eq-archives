<br>
-- Teddi<br>
<br>
=======<br>
<br>
An open letter to a terrorist:<br>
<br>
Well, you hit the World Trade Center, but you missed America. You hit the Pentagon, but you missed America. You used helpless American bodies, to take out other American bodies, but like a poor marksman, you STILL missed America.<br>
<br>
Why? Because of something you guys will never understand. America isn't about a building or two, not about financial centers, not about military centers, America isn't about a place, America isn't even about a bunch of bodies. America is about an IDEA. An idea, that you can go someplace where you can earn as much as you can figure out how to, live for the most part, like you envisioned living, and pursue Happiness. (No guarantees that you'll reach it, but you can sure try!)<br>
<br>
Go ahead and whine your terrorist whine, and chant your terrorist litany: "If you can not see my point, then feel my pain." This concept is alien to Americans. We live in a country where we don't have to see your point. But you're free to have one. We don't have to listen to your speech. But you're free to say one. Don't know where you got the strange idea that everyone has to agree with you. We don't agree with each other in this country, almost as a matter of pride. We're a collection of guys that don't agree, called States. We united our individual states to protect ourselves from tyranny in the world. Another idea, we made up on the spot.  You CAN make it up as you go, when it's your country.  If you're free enough.<br>
<br>
Yeah, we're fat, sloppy, easy-going goofs most of the time. That's an unfortunate image to project to the world, but it comes of feeling free and easy about the world you live in.  It's unfortunate too, because people start to forget that when you attack Americans, they tend to fight like a cornered badger. The first we knew of the War of 1812, was when England burned Washington D.C. to the ground. Didn't turn out like England thought it was going to, and it's not going to turn out like you think, either.  Sorry, but you're not the first bully on our shores, just the most recent.<br>
<br>
No Marquis of Queensbury rules for Americans, either. We were the FIRST and so far, only country in the world to use nuclear weapons in anger.  Horrific idea, nowadays?  News for you bucko, it was back then too, but we used it anyway. Only had two of them in the whole world and we used 'em both.  Grandpa Jones worked on the Manhattan Project. Told me once, that right up until they threw the switch, the physicists were still arguing over whether the Uranium alone would fission, or whether it would start a fissioning chain reaction that would eat everything. But they threw the switch anyway, because we had a War to win. Does that tell you something about American Resolve?<br>
<br>
So who just declared War on us? It would be nice to point to some real estate, like the good old days. Unfortunately, we're probably at war with random camps, in far-flung places. Who think they're safe. Just like the Barbary Pirates did, IIRC. Better start sleeping with one eye open.<br>
<br>
There's a spirit that tends to take over people who come to this country, looking for opportunity, looking for liberty, looking for freedom.  Even if they misuse it. The Marielistas that Castro emptied out of his prisons, were overjoyed to find out how much freedom there was.  First thing they did when they hit our shores, was run out and buy guns. The ones that didn't end up dead, ended up in prisons. It was a big PITA then (especially in south Florida), but you're only the newest PITA, not the first.<br>
<br>
You guys seem to be incapable of understanding that we don't live in America, America lives in US! American Spirit is what it's called.  And killing a few thousand of us, or a few million of us, won't change it. Most of the time, it's a pretty happy-go-lucky kind of Spirit. Until we're crossed in a cowardly manner, then it becomes an entirely different kind of Spirit.<br>
<br>
Wait until you see what we do with that Spirit, this time.<br>
<br>
Sleep tight, if you can. We're coming.</td></tr></table><table width='100%' cellspacing=1><tr><td valign=top id=MsgBoardGroupNameTD width=150><center><font color=white>Belisana</font><br><font size=1>9/13/01 2:35:01 PM</font><br></td><td valign=top align=left id=MsgBoardGroupName2TD><center><font color=white><b>RE:Hit the building, missed America</b></font></center><hr>More tears are flowing now.<br>
<br>
That letter was a bit of rambling in places...however it hits the heart.  American spirit is one of the greatest forces in the world.  Not a force to be trifled with.  We are patriots, no matter what are background is or our history.  We are a people that love our land and will fight to the death to defend it.  Not all of us will be called for that duty, not all of us will be called upon at all.  But the enemy best run, because the greatest country in the world is coming for them...and we will take no prisoners this time.  <br>
<br>
May the gods and goddessess' bless us, our country and our allies.  May the evil spirits of the underworld open their jaws to feed upon the black souls that will be sent to them in due time.<br>

<br>
I posted this on the Valor's Companions board, but I thought I would share it here too... (can you tell I am a hippy-Vancouverite?)<br>
================================<br>
I feel very strongly about this issue. Please pardon me, if I speak out on this. I am usually quite quiet about such matters, but like I said, it's emotional.<br>
<br>
There are many very, very good people out there. I keep hearing about folks all over the world going above and beyond the call of duty to help and to heal. <br>
<br>
Although our world seems uncertain during this time, all of us face it together. Out of this tragedy it seems to me that many countries have felt this thing in the heart. (I know I have) The world seems to have come together to stand united on this issue. I get some comfort from that.<br>
<br>
There is something that my father read at my wedding that I believe in very much. Again, pardon me for sharing my feelings with you, but I think it is beautiful.<br>
<br>
"Recompense to no man evil for evil. Provide things honest in the sight of all men. If it be possible as much as lieth in you, live peaceably with all men..... <br>
<br>
... Be not overcome of evil, but overcome evil with good."<br>
<br>
I think of you as my friends, and I want you to know, that even though these many miles between us stand long, this Canadian holds you in her heart. I know that there are more good folk in the world then truely "evil". <br>
<br>
We unite in love and in healing, in this it gives me strength.<br>
======================================<br>
<br>
I know many people are hurting<br>
I know many people want PAY back for this horrible thing.<br>
<br>
What I want is the truely responsible ones brought to justice.  <br>
<br>
Evil wants evil to ensue.  Throw a stone to ripple the water.<br>
The best way to defeat this is not to give them what they wish, as hard as it may be.  (Sometimes the hardest thing to do is nothing at all)<br>
<br>
Defeat evil by being good. Overcome the wrongs but uniting together.  We cannot undo this thing.  However, we can unite in love and by doing so, undo evil completely.<br>
<br>
/many hugs<br>
