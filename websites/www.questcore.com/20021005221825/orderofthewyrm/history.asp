<center>Last Modified:8/18/01 11:59:56 PM</center><br><br><font color=aaaaff>In a time when good and righteousness ruled the land, all creatures of
Norrath lived in  peaceful coexistence.  Although separated by racial,
cultural and linguistic uniqueness, prejudices and biases were unknown
to them.  Barbarians, humans, elves and dwarves all lived side by side,
breaking bread together, hunting together and working together. 
However, this was on the surface.  Far below the surface of Norrath
lived the followers of Innoruk, the evil one. They were a collections of
the foulest of the foul creatures and races.  Serving their dark lord
and his evil brethren gods, they toiled at their evil deeds.  Jealous of
the surface creatures' happiness, Innoruk and Cazic Thule joined forces
to banish the pure and true.  Using a basic strategy of divide and
conquer, strange dark magics were used  and split the land in all
directions.  Chaos and panic spread across Norrath as brother and sister
were separated, fathers and mothers lost.  At the height of the
pandemonium, Bertoxulus set a plague upon the lands.  The forces of dark
rose up and began to sweep across kingdoms, destroying everything in
sight.  Yet this was not to be the end.  Rallying behind King Mistmoore
II warriors and spellcasters arose from all of Norrath to smite the
onslaught.  A constant battle, swaying too and for continued for 12
years.  Tiring of the indecisive war, Innoruk called upon the most vile
of all his subjects to punish King Mistmoore and smash the uprising.
<br><br>
News of some great evil being brewed by Innoruk and Cazic Thule reached
the advisors of King Mistmoore II at the cost of several lives. 
Preparing to meet this new menace, King Mistmoore II turned to one of
his most honored knights.  Long being known as a great cultural kingdom,
the King had created The Great Library.  Within the library lay the
greatest and most rare of books on all of Norrath.  The custodian of  The
Great Library was this honored knight, appointed by Mistmoore himself as
a reward for many years of good service.  The knight's name was
Octavious Veridyme, Keeper Of  The Words.  His brother, Falla Veridyme,
Keeper Of  The Code was King Mistmoore's closest advisor.  The two
brothers were responsible for training and educating all of the
Mistmoore Knighthood.  The combined curriculum led to the Motto of
Mistmoore, "Through the words come wisdom; Through the code comes
power;  Through the words and code comes balance."  Falla, the elder
brother had a son named Junus who was a promising young knight in the
ranks.  Octavious had a son named Granger, who was several years younger
than his cousin Junus, but idolized him none-the-less.  Too young to
even squire, Granger poured himself into the books his father cared for,
listened into the lessons and absorbed everything in order to prepare
himself for the day he would apply to be a squire.  A fine warrior,
Octavious had reluctantly accepted the post, but soon grew to love his
position.  When word came down from the council that some great evil
would be brought into the war by Innoruk, Octavious began to research
all the great books of history and lore.  Unsure what to look for,
Octavious became overwhelmed and had his son Granger apprentice him. 
Father and son worked side by side for weeks, hypothesizing and
guessing.  When all the ideas had been written down for the King's
advisors to contemplate, a sense of relief came to Octavious and
Granger.  As they sit back and partook of a loaf of bread and some
cheese, Granger cocked his head to one side as he looked upon a book on
one of the uppermost shelves in the corner.  The book seemed to have an
aura about it.  Octavious followed his son's gaze to see the book
himself.  His curiosity piqued, Octavious walked over hesitantly to see
a book he had never seen before.  Cautiously he removed the book from
the shelf to find a perfectly smooth leather bound book with small
diamond shaped lightstones imbedded into it.  It was so finely crafted
that to the touch Octavious could not feel a seam or ripple where the
stones appeared to live in codependency with the leather.  Upon the
cover, in pure gold lettering were three words, on atop the other,
"Wurmlore", "est" and "Veeshan."  Slowly, Octavious opened the book to
find crisp parchment that appeared as if they had just been pressed. 
The words, which were in a language he had never seen, seemed to still
be damp on the page.  
As Octavious  sat down with Granger, they began to work feverishly at
trying to decipher this mysterious book.  Words began to form, followed
by sentences, paragraphs and finally chapters, making sense.  As the
strange words began to realize that the book was of an ancient language,
unspoken by humanoids.  Most importantly, it was a history of Norrath
before the kingdoms were formed.  A time when all creatures dwelled on
the surface, and of creatures in formation as yet unknown to Norrath. 
The beginning of Norrath and the arrival of the Gods.  One word kept
appearing over and over that could not be translated.  The word Wurm
appeared to be some creature that was so powerful and found in
multitudes of shapes, sizes and colors.  This creature, although
sometimes benevolent in some forms, was also heinous and hideous in
others, so foul that to speak the word Wurm left a bitter taste on the
lips.  Legends of great warriors and heroes filled the book.  Within the
stories, tales of Dark Elves, Trolls, Erudites, and Ogres stood against
their evil brethren's ways.  Along with these stories, tales of the
"good" races turning on their brothers and falling prey to the evil ones
were revealed.  At the end of each tale the ending was the same, as a
beacon and a warning, "Judge not but for actions." 
After a fortnight of constant work, they reached an impasse and could
not could not decipher the last chapter.  As the darkened hours of the
morning waned, Octavious blew out the candles and carried his sleeping
son to his bed.  Octavious walked the towers of Mistmoore Keep to clear
his mind.  The faint haze of the morning carried a heavy feel to it,
like a wet blanket on the mind.  As Octavious walked back to his
quarters he heard a rushed and harried commotion at the gates.  He ran
down to see what was going on where he saw several warriors approaching
rapidly.  One of these was his nephew Junus, whose face was a ghostly
white and his eyes filled with something his uncle had never seen in him
. . . panic.<br><br>
As the Mistmoore Knighthood, the King's Advisory Council, Octavious,
and the King himself gathered in the Chapel of Mistmoore's Council Hall,
Junus and the few he had returned with began to tell the tale of their
routing.<br><br>
"The night was eerily calm," Junus began.  "The standard patrols out,
the watch set and the camps made.  Then . . . a . . . a cold mist came
over the bivouac.  A swarm of creatures were upon our perimeter and were
met by our forces.  We held our ground and the battle seemed to be ours
. . . until . . . until . . . until IT came."  Junus shivered and
dropped his head.  As he did so mutters and rumblings swept across the
chapel until King Mistmoore cleared his throat for quiet.
"Sir Junus, what was this 'IT' you speak of"
Junus calmly raised his head to meet the King's eyes and said in a
lucid voice, "A creature of whose origins I have not known.  It was as
large as this chapel, with wings and a pointed tail.  Its  skin
appeared to be reptilian in nature.  Its basilisk shaped face had a
tongue and hideously sharp teeth.  I . . . I . . . I . . . could swear
my lord that it spoke to the ground forces, directing them in combat. 
Almost warning them in each of their own languages of its oncoming
fury.  Then, it reared back, inhaled deeply and blew a sheet of ice from
its mouth.  Knights became frozen in place . . . in time, monuments to
death.  Our archers could not pierce its skin, our spellcasters had no
effect, and our warriors could not wound it.  Hundreds fell before the
retreat order was given.  I fear we are lost my lord."
A silence fell upon the Knighthood as all took in what Junus said. 
Finally, King Mistmoore looked to Junus and asked, "What of my brother,
Antel?"
Junus looked up sheepishly and the King and replied, "Dead, sire, as he
was one of the first to go."
The King slumped at the news, obviously shaken.  "Have we no idea what
this creature is?"  
One of the knights that returned with Junus replied, "Sire, I believe I
heard some of the opposing forces chanting, 'Wurm Lox.' 
Suddenly, a fire burned through Octavious' mind causing him to slump
over in pain.  As the entire congregation turned, Octavious stood and
excused himself.  He reached the library to find Granger awake, and at
the desk where the Wurmlore book lay resting.  Granger had awakened to
the same pain his father had experienced in the chapel, and when he came
to find his father in the library he glanced at the book.  Much to his
surprise, as he glanced at it he could swear it spoke to him, and he
noticed that the words were now easy to read in their original
publication, not needing to be ciphered.  Octavious too could read every
word as if it had been written in Elven.  Now, the final chapter was
legible to him, as was the cover.  "Dragonlore, By Veeshan."  And
suddenly he realized that Wurm was not just spelled that way, but also
Wyrm.  They were different creatures by nature.  The Wyrm were good
dragons by nature, and the Wurm were evil by nature.  Also, Wyrm and
Wurms were Dragons.  Veeshan was the Wyrmqueen, as explained in the
book, whereas Innoruk was the Wurmlord.  The mysterious word now made
sense.  Wurm Lox was Dragon Lox.  The mysterious language was in the
Wyrmqueen's own language.
The final chapter spoke of ancient magics, hidden throughout Norrath,
of large parties working together in unison to drive away the evil
Dragons that opposed Veeshan, the Wyrmqueen.  All races and types of
humanoids gathered together, from bakers to tailors, from warriors to
healers and other spellcasters united to face this menace.  They worked
with a pure heart to banish Innouruk's pets.  As they read on, the walls
began to shake apart.  Out of the eastern window of the library a dark
cloud began to cover the morning light on the horizon.  A cold mist
crept across the keep and bustling noises dotted the walls with shouts. 
Suddenly, Octavious realized what was coming.  "A Dragon."  Octavious
hurriedly got into his armor and grabbed his trusty weapon and headed to
join his comrades in the battle to defend Mistmoore.  By his side was
Junus and Falla.  As the sky darkened and the winds rose to a freezing
temperature, eyes squinted and swept the sky searching for the beast
Junus described.  
Cloaked in a heavy wrap, Granger stood by a doorway near the eastern
wall of the keep.  He was the first to see it, but could not speak as
the fear filled him.  Junus was next and shouted, "INCOMING!!!!"  Many
knights just stood and gazed in awe, others fled like children so filled
with the Dragon's fear.  With a flurry of steel and magic, the knights
composed themselves and began to fight off the fear and the dark forces
swarming the walls.  From above, the menacing creature began a rapid
decent, faster than anything Granger had ever seen or imagined.  He
watched in awe as the muscles rippled along the neck and wings of the  creature.  Teeth sharper than any blade forged by the Mistmoore
smiths gleamed in the light, tainted with fresh blood.  Suddenly, the
dark forces slowed and ebbed as the first of the horrified knights
looked to see the sheet of ice coming from the creatures mouth, just
before they were encased in ice.  As many tried to fight off the foul
creature they were cut in half by its bite and its tail that whipped
around, and those lucky enough found themselves impaled by the razor
sharp talons of the creature.  The knights began to fight their way back
into the inner portions of the keep.  As they did, the dark forces
flooded the walls.  It was then that Falla and Junus were slain by
Orcs.  Octavious quickly ran to Granger and grabbed him, carrying him
back to the library.  King Mistmoore and his personal guard fought their
way back to the chapel and prayed for the gods to help them,
unfortunately it was too late.  For too long they had lived in
self-importance, believing that they were above the gods in their
lifestyle.  
In the library, Octavious ran to the Wurmlore book, wrapped it in a
cloth and gave it to Granger.  "No matter what happens here today, you
must take this to the others.  They are out there, and you shall know
them.  As the book says, 'Judge not but by actions.'  They will reveal
themselves.  Gather them together, unite them, tutor them and train
them, and defeat the evil ones. Through the words come wisdom; Through
the code comes power;  Through the words and code comes balance. You are
last to know, the final link in the chain.  With you, this book will be
in the hands of love and only good shall come from it and from within
you."  With that, Octavious sent Granger out through a secret door to
safety.  
Just as he shut the door, the roof was blown off the library and Wurm
Lox looked down upon Octavious.  Grinning evilly, the Lox spoke, "Time
to die, little one."
Much to his surprise, Octavious knew what Lox said, but even more
surprising was when he spoke back in the Wurm tongue and the look on
Lox's face.  "From the heart of good, you shall be sent back to the pits
from which you came."  With that Octavious spun his sword and charged
Lox.  Peeking in from behind the door, Granger saw his father stop in
mid track as he was frozen by the large creature.  
Screaming from the pit of his soul, "Father!!, Noooooo!"  Suddenly, Lox
turned to Granger and inhaled deeply.  Just as he began to breath out,
Granger shut the door and ran as fast as he could.  Hearing the creak of
wood an stone bending at the impact, followed by a hideous screech from
Lox, Granger continued to run, and never stopped until he finally
collapsed. When he woke, he was in the woods, quiet and alone.  As he
made his way to Kaladim, the first of the news came in at a shop along
the way.  The war was over.  Conditions were sketchy, but what was known
was that King Mistmoore was dead, his body being drawn and quartered. 
The four parts were to be spread across Norrath to serve as a warning of
rebellion.  Mistmoore itself would be occupied and given to the dark
forces, along with the coastal mansion of King Mistmoore's in Dragnor's
Cauldron.  These terms had been reached in agreement of all the gods. 
Finally, Veeshan and the other gods of light had stepped in to stop the
madness.  Granger's mind ached.  He was alone, with no home and no
family.  He saw his father die in front of him and could do nothing but
shake for hours.  He reached in his bag to get some bread he had taken
with him, and saw it.  It was the book, Wyrmlore, wrapped in the cloth
by his father.  He suddenly was filled with a sense of responsibility,
and remembered his father's words.  From that day forward, he traveled
all of Norrath in search of those to teach in the ways of the Wyrm,
seeking to gather the forces to rid Norrath of Lox and his Wurmkind, and
teach those who were worthy the difference between The Wyrm and The
Wurm.  This was the beginning of "The Order of the Wyrm."<br><br>

<b>And so it began.  Through the ages of darkness that followed, the Order of the Wyrm continued to grow.  Slowly, as Granger carefully sought out those who were ready, then a bit faster as the years passed.  In his dying days he passed on the mantle of leadership to keep the Order from becoming stale under one leader.  Under his supervision the Order of the Wyrm was divided into 5 houses, with each house bearing the load of the main house.  Here, I begin my story for you.  My name is Galidorne Wyndthalos, of the house of Wynd.  I am a bard by trade, but a romantic at heart.  There will be times that my words will seem to sting, yet the truth sometimes hurts&  and sometimes it makes us laugh, I hope that I achieve both by telling the truth.</b>
<br><br>
The first of the houses was to be responsible for keeping the Lore of the Order as well as the chronicles of the world.  This was first granted to an elf of the wood species, Durrak Wynd (his wife being Alecia Thalos), who then passed it down to his son Quienth Wyndthalos (His wife being Crysandra).  Durrak and his family were chosen for this for their blatant honesty.  They spared no words for politics, but rather openly spoke their thoughts and feelings.  They would then be able to present the Lore in a manner untainted, yet romanticized for all to know.  There were times that the words were disliked, and the author disliked due to those words, yet they have never been untrue by any means.  His daughter, Ginderlo was then appointed the first female Guild Mistress, who then passed the title down to her daughter Meritus Wyndthalos (her brother being Jantor and her husband being Averi Ver'Dunn).  It was here, during the Chaos Wars that the first split came to the Order Of the Wyrm.  Approximately one-third of the Order Of the Wyrm left.  Their virtues still the same as The Order of the Wyrm, however they did not agree on the way to achieve this goal.  Those who left formed a new guild, Wyrm Bane.  Wyrm Bane, which will no longer be mentioned hereafter, set off to destroy Dragons and Evil in their own way, yet always kept a good and strong virtue.  At the end of the Chaos Wars a time of peace fell upon the land and the son of Meritus and Averi Ver'Dunn was passed on the title of Loremaster.  This was Mishka Ver'Dunn.  Mishka then married a human named Laura.  This was the first inter-racial marriage within the guild, although it was hidden due to prejudices at the time.   They then had a bastard son named Devaril who was given to a human woman to raise in secret.  Devaril was not told of his identity due to the shame of the inter-racial offspring, however when he reached maturity, I brought his true identity to him, for as his friend I knew that a man is only half a man without his heritage.  At this point, when the bastard rogue Devaril came of age, he was appointed the title of Guildmaster.  Unfortunately, his wife (and my sister) Merti Ver'Dunn fell victim to the power of love and abandoned Devaril for Bewen Mandrake.  Merti loved Devaril, but not in the way that he needed, and he could not requite her love.  From her sorrow, she left the Order of the Wyrm, as did Bewen.  After a quiet annulment, Bewen and Merti were married.  There was much sorrow and torment over the loss of these members. Brothers were turned against each other, and the Order of the Wyrm almost ceased to exist.  [As a personal note, always greet them warmly and friendly, for they were and always shall be family to the Order, even if they are no longer participating members.  They are the friends of us all.  Do not speak harshly towards them, yet do not allow them to sway your heart from the Order, for to quench their own needs and desires for the remission of their guilt they would rather see The Order fold than to praise it.]  While Devaril Ver'Dunn was a good leader, his shame and sorrow forced him to turn the leadership over to Tristian Fireweaver, a High Elf of Felwithe.  During the reign of when Devaril Ver'Dunn was chosen as Guildmaster the task of Loremaster was passed along to the grandson of Jantor Wyndthalos.  That would be Galidorne Wyndthalos, who is me.  My father was Veritus Wyndthalos.  He was the Guildmaster prior to Devaril.  Normally, as with most "royal" titles, I would have been granted that title, however the Bylaws of the Order of the Wyrm dictate that leadership be passed from house to house so as to prevent a single bloodline from maintaining and distorting power.

For new potential members, I hope you have read this far.  By doing so you have had some entertainment, and gotten a feel for the guild.  Your keyword is "Rainbow."  Please finish the story and enjoy.  You may post on our message boards if you liked or disliked the story.  Feedback is always welcome.

The second house of The Order was to be responsible for all monies collected for distribution.  This House of the Treasury was assigned to a warrior of human kind, Troi Ramses, however due to his ineptitude to properly collect and distribute the funds for the guild he was removed from his post.  His family name was spared by this and today there are still members within the Order who are good and true, yet there are those who are leery of loaning them money.  The title was passed from Troi to his cousin Marek Shadowfal.  The Shadowfal clan held this house until the days of Sureity Shadowfal (father of Seakrops), when the title was passed to the clan of Leafwind due to an unusually large amount of funds and equipment that were found to be missing yet never discovered [It is apparently a family thing].  Lariette Leafwind, mother of Ladara Leafwind (who later by the graces of the gods became my wife and lover, Ladara Wyndthalos), collected and distributed funds justly.  She passed the title on to her daughter Ladara at her death, so at that time two houses were as one with the marriage of Wyndthalos and Leafwind.

The third house of The Order was set up for promotion and encouragement of the ranks.  This was and is the Questmaster position.  The first of the Questmasters was Beebop Fizzlefingers, of gnomish kind.  This title was passed to his son Breezey, who handed the title to his daughter Salandra Fizzlefingers, whose illegitimate son Corky [an unusually tall gnome] was in office during the Chaos Wars.  [It is rumored that there was a Fireweaver in the woodpile]  It was from this house that the first of the dissenters left.  It was not the entire family, but many within it.  Corky, although shamed by his brethren, stayed within The Order.  His son, Peinto Fizzlefingers continued the position of Questmaster most diligently and adequately until he passed his post to his son Bippin Fizzlefingers.  Bippin, seeking personal harmony, resigned his post and passed the mantle to Moonknife Nordendrache, of the Barbarian race.  There are those who ask to the validity of this house today, but as Granger had designed this house to carry forth the ideals of virtue, promising an equality for members who sacrificed personal gain by taking time to prove themselves to others in The Order, and therefore be raised in rank and privilege and praised for their deeds.  It is through the quests that one can find their strength for future days, the appreciation of their brethren in The Order, and the awakening to the good of their deeds and actions.  Granger knew that we could not defeat the evil ones alone, but united to stand tall against them, unwavering.

The fourth house of The Order was that of Administrators.  The Administrators would be responsible for keeping order within The Order.  This would be obtained through the keeping of records, passing them on to the Lore Master house when necessary, announcements of events, publishing of the Lore and registry, promoting growth, and maintaining discipline.  Because this house would be so large, many families were brought into this.  Beginning with the three houses of Fireweaver, Dal'Sango, and Shadowfal.  Over the years these families have moved to other positions, as well as new ones coming in, last names changing through marriage and unions.  Some of the other families to be in this house have been Ramses, Longquan, Darcazian, Ver'Dunn, and Desareth.  All nobly and justly maintaining and administrating their posts.

The last house to be created was that of Guild Leader.  Naturally, this one person would have authority only to call for a guild war, cease a guild war, anoint officers and be the titular head of The Order.  Of course, our first Guild Master was Granger.  His son would have been appointed to succeed him, however in a freakish accident in the Tree City of Kelethin his son William fell to his death from 500 feet above the ground.  Desolate, Granger passed leadership to the house of Marrish.  This clan maintained control for two generations until the barren wife of Webling Marrish was unable to produce an offspring, thus ending the lineage.  The control of Guild Master was then passed on to the first female Guild Mistress, my ancestor, Ginderlo Wyndthalos and her daughter Meritus, before the title was passed back to another clan for protecting the power.  The next to hold this post was a Ramses.  Although not trusted with money, the Clan of Ramses were strong and powerful leaders for four generations.  Passing the Mantle of power to The Shadowfal Clan, back to the Wyndthalos Clan, then the Ver'Dunn Clan and most recently the Fireweaver Clan.

Thus, we have come to the end of the tale as it is.  We are many strong and growing.  We survive love, loss, and tragedy, for we are of good and kind spirits.  We shall triumph; we shall survive, for good shall always triumph over evil with the aid of Veeshan, the Goddess of the good Wyrms.
