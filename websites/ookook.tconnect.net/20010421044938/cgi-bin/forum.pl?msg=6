Purpose:

We the members of Ook Ook, in order to form more frivolous
union hereby commence the EverQuest Guild 'Ook Ook'. Members
of Ook will be required to conduct themselves in an eclectic
and obtuse manner as possible. No Normal behavior is
permitted. 

Rules:
In the manner of loot issues or membership votes, disputes
will be settled by sexual acts. Or, in the case of halflings
or Gnomes, two sexual acts.

Members:
Ook Ook favors Clerics. In fact, Ook Ook favors its clerics
barefoot and in the kitchen rezzing people for free or the
afore mentioned sexual favors.

GuildMates:
We are friends who play in close formation, in EQ or Real
Life, no matter the distance between us. We like the game,
but we love each other. From Behind.

In the Matter of Membership:
Membership in the guild is a colrful thing. Deep greens and
blues are the colors we choose to beat over the head of
unsuspecting dolphins. When the Alarm clock goes off, be
sure to grab the nearest cardboard box and fill it with your
personal effects. After that, the CheeseWiz exploded with a
enough force to kill two small doberman insects. You will
need submit two life size posters of Regis Philbin.

Seriously.
