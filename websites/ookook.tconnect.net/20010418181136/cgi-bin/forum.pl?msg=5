I have the site nearly done, need some content to stick in
the dumb catagories I made...

- Charter(no idea here)
- Members(think I know everyone :)
- Forum(seems to be working)
- Events(also working)
- Screen Shots(have a few of inno and such.. anymore would
be cool though)
- Tips & Tricks(joat's idea i think? i dont have any tricks
i want to share :)

Sent any ideas to djwillenbrin@stthomas.edu  Site is almost
done, have the graphics and stuff finished up, just need
content so it doesnt look as empty as this :)

Serieux
