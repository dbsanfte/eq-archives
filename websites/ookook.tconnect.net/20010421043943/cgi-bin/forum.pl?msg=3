You guys blow ass, frigging chat here or something, Im
friggin bored. Blah. I wanna go home, hear that Eruds can be
SK's soon? Piss poor stats, but ah well. Yada yada. Painell
is coming, wankers, better get ready. Once, I saw a tulip,
it wasnt normal, haps it was the shade of grey that came
from deap within. But as far as that goes, its 2 pence short
of a dye.
