        <td><p align="center"><font color="#FFFFFF">WARNING: If
        you are totally new to making maps and using triggers, I
        suggest you get these skills up to scratch before
        attempting this, as it is a long and complicated process
        as compared to any of the other tutorials thus far. You
        need to know how to get an object's SCID, a node's GUID,
        and remember a bunch of node door numbers. I suggest you
        copy and paste all these numbers into notepad with a
        small description so you can refer back to them as you do
        this. It's a pain in the ass, really, but this is the
        only way you'll be able to do it. If you don't get it
        right the first time, don't fret, just re-do it. I know
        that can be a pain but there's no other way to do it
        really.</font></p>
        <p align="center"><font color="#FFFFFF">Now that we have
        that over with, LET'S MAKE A DAMN DISPLACER ALREADY!</font></p>
        <p align="center"><font color="#FFFFFF">First off, make
        sure you know where you want the displacer building, and
        all the destinations. A displacer building is limited to
        3 platforms, so make sure if you have a really big map to
        place them in the right spots. We will only be setting up
        one displacer, you can add additional ones with the same
        method. First off, let's make the displacer that is out
        in the field (not the one in your town). The nodes we'll
        be working with are all in &quot;Terrain
        Nodes/teleport_hub&quot;.</font></p>
        <p align="center"><font color="#FFFFFF">Place the node
        &quot;t_th_01_teleport-platform-outside-a&quot; in the
        spot that you want the destination. it can be in any
        region in your map EXCEPT the town, because that's where
        we'll want to place the displacer building :-D This is
        the location you need to initially &quot;calibrate&quot;
        the displacer before you can use it all the time. Ever
        notice how you can't use a displacer right from the
        displacer building the first time, until you've gone to
        that location and used it once? That's beccause it
        requires activation first. We will get to this part
        eventually. Now, back to the destination. Next, on door 5
        of the displacer base, attach the node
        &quot;t_th_01_teleport-tower-ele-top-a&quot;. Make sure
        door 1 of the platform lines up with door 5 of the base,
        and door 2 lines up with door 7 of the base. Next, in
        &quot;game objects/gizmos/interactive tools&quot;, place
        a &quot;statue_spin_mini&quot; in the middle of the
        platform. Next, add a &quot;use point&quot;, located in
        &quot;game objects/gizmos/special&quot;, on the platform
        as well, but not in the middle. Let's say, in one of the
        corners. Copy the SCID of the use point, and paste it
        into the value field &quot;use point SCIDs&quot;, located
        in the properties window, template properties tab, of the
        statue_spin_mini. If you did it right, when you click on
        the statue, an orange animated arrow will be pointing to
        the use point.</font></p>
        <p align="center"><font color="#FFFFFF">Next, we will
        want to add a &quot;set_bool&quot; object (it's called
        Sets boolean value upon recieving we_req_activate),
        located in game objects/gizmos/triggers, on the grass
        just off the displacer platform base. Make sure this
        object is not on the platform or the platform base! Go to
        the properties of the set_bool object, and in the
        template properties tab, at the very bottom is a field
        called &quot;bool_variable&quot;. Put in something like
        &quot;displacer_1_activate&quot;. Remeber this value.
        Next, create a &quot;trigger_generic&quot;, located in
        &quot;game objects/gizmos/triggers&quot;, on the
        displacer platform. Go to the properties of the trigger,
        trigger properties tab. Create a new trigger with the
        button &quot;new&quot; at the bottom left of the window.
        Add a new condition
        &quot;party_member_within_bounding_box&quot;. Adjust the
        Half diag X value to 3, the Y value to 1, and the Z value
        to 3. Add a new action &quot;send world message&quot;. In
        the &quot;send to object&quot; field of this action,
        paste the SCID of the set_bool object. On the top of the
        trigger properties window, make sure ALL boxes EXCEPT
        &quot;flip-flop&quot; are checked. There should now be a
        green animated arrow pointing to the set_bool object.
        Done. Now add a &quot;check_bool&quot; object (says
        Checks boolean value upon recieveing we_req_activate),
        located in &quot;game objects/gizmos/triggers&quot; in
        the air above the statue_spin_mini. In the template
        properties tab of the check_bool object, in the field
        &quot;bool_variable&quot;, enter the bool variable you
        put in the set_bool object. I used
        &quot;displacer_1_activate&quot;. Copy the SCID of the
        check_bool object, and paste it into the fields &quot;on
        SCID&quot; and &quot;off SCID&quot; in the template
        properties tab of the &quot;statue_spin_mini&quot;.
        Change the value &quot;we_req_deactivate&quot; below
        &quot;off SCID&quot; to &quot;we_req_activate&quot;.
        There should now be a green animated arrow pointing from
        the statue_spin_mini to the check_bool object. Cool. Now
        place an &quot;elevator_instant_4s_1c&quot; object,
        located in &quot;game objects/elevators&quot;, above the
        check bool object, which is above the statue spin mini.
        Copy the SCID of the &quot;elevator_instant_4s_1c&quot;
        object, and paste it into the field
        &quot;sent_to_scid&quot; in the template properties tab
        of the check_bool object. Save. Your setup should now
        look something like this:</font></p>

        src="tutorials/displacer1.JPG" width="491" height="479"></font></p>
        <p align="center"><font color="#FFFFFF">I have created a
        text file that you can copy and paste all the ID numbers
        you will need as you set this up, you will need to refer
        to it as you set up your displacers. The numbers that are
        already there are what you must use, the ones that are
        not are the ones YOU need to put in. Get it </font><a
        href="tutorials/displacers.txt"><font color="#0000FF">HERE</font></a><font
        color="#FFFFFF">.</font></p>
        <p align="center"><font color="#FFFFFF">For the first
        part, &quot;DISPLACER BUILDING ELEVATOR OBJECT
        SETTINGS&quot;, you will need to get the following SCID's
        and GUID's: other_elevator = object SCID of
        &quot;elevator_instant_4s_1c&quot; object,
        e2_elevator_node = the displacer platform node at the
        location you just made, and connect_node_location2 = node
        GUID of displacer platform base in the region you just
        made. For the second part, &quot;DISPLACER PLATFORM IN
        THE FIELD ELEVATOR OBJECT SETTINGS&quot;, you will need
        to get the following SCID's and GUID's: elevator_node =
        node GUID of displacer platform, connect_node_location1 =
        node GUID of displacer base at the location you just
        made. Make sure you can access this file easily.</font></p>
        <p align="center"><font color="#FFFFFF">Now we will make
        the displcaer building in the town. Open the town region,
        and create the displacer building
        &quot;t_th_01_teleport-tower-base-a&quot;, add
        &quot;t_th_01_teleport-tower-doorsides-a&quot; to door 12
        of the displacer building. Add
        &quot;t_th_01_teleport-tower-doortop-a&quot; to door 11
        of the displacer building. Add
        &quot;t_th_01_teleport-tower-ele-base-a&quot; to door 10
        of the displacer building. Add
        &quot;t_th_01_teleport-tower-top-a&quot; to door 9 of the
        displacer building. Add
        &quot;t_th_01_teleport-tower-ele-cap-a&quot; to doors 3
        and 11 of the displacer tower roof. Add
        &quot;t_th_01_teleport-tower-ele-top-a&quot; to door 7 of
        the displacer tower roof, making sure door 1 of the
        displacer platform lines up with door 7 of the displacer
        building roof, and door 2 of the displacer platform lines
        up with door 9 of the displacer building roof. Now you
        can add ALL the same objects as the first displacer you
        made, EXEPT for the &quot;set_bool&quot; object and the
        &quot;trigger_generic&quot;. These objects are used only
        on the other side, to activate the displacer and make it
        useable from both sides. Remember how trigger_generic was
        &quot;one-shot&quot;? That makes it so that once a party
        member crosses that trigger, it activates the set_bool
        variable. Upon activating the statue_spin_mini on either
        side of the displacer, the check_bool objects then ask
        the set_bool if it has been activated yet or not. If it
        has, the displacer activates. If it hasn't, the displacer
        is useless. That is why when you try to use a displacer
        directly from town, it doesn't let you, at least not
        until you have triggered the set_bool with the trigger
        generic, which is on the other displacer platform. Make
        sense? That's ok, just continue with the tutorial :-D</font></p>
        <p align="center"><font color="#FFFFFF">Create the same
        stuff, &quot;statue_spin_mini&quot;, &quot;use
        point&quot;, &quot;check_bool&quot;, and
        &quot;elevator_instant_4s_1c&quot;. Set them up the same
        way as before, and copy all the same data as you did
        before into your text file, in the fields that are still
        empty. You should know where they all go now, and it is
        documented for ease of use. Now enter all the data from
        the &quot;DISPLACER BUILDING ELEVATOR OBJECT
        SETTINGS&quot; section into the
        &quot;elevator_instant_4s_1c&quot; template properties
        tab, in its object properties window, even the stuff that
        I entered in the text file. Save, and open the region
        where your displacer &quot;in the field&quot; is located.
        Enter all the data you copied into &quot;DISPLACER
        PLATFORM IN THE FIELD ELEVATOR OBJECT SETTINGS&quot;,
        including the values that I put in there.</font></p>
        <p align="center"><font color="#FFFFFF">Place a start
        position beside the displacer &quot;in the field&quot;,
        so you can test it out. Now, if you folloed all the steps
        right, you should now have 100% WORKING DISPLACERS! As
        for the fading of the displacer building when you enter
        it, refer to the </font><a
        href="dsmaps/tutorials/multifade.htm"><font
        color="#0000FF">FADING</font></a><font color="#FFFFFF">
        tutorial, and for the elevator that goes up to the roof,
        the </font><a href="dsmaps/tutorials/elevators.htm"><font
        color="#0000FF">ELEVATORS</font></a><font color="#FFFFFF">
        tutorial. Only difference is you'd use a &quot;2-state,
        1-connection, 2-node elevator&quot;. Another thing to add
        is in the object properties window, template properties
        tab of the elevator object. In the two values
        &quot;Moving1_ActionInfo&quot; and
        &quot;Moving2_ActionInfo&quot; add the following:</font></p>
        <p align="center"><font color="#FFFFFF">Moving1_ActionInfo
        = 0x00000001(this would be YOUR region ID),5,5,5,in,3.5</font></p>
        <p align="center"><font color="#FFFFFF">Moving2_ActionInfo
        = 0x00000001(this would be YOUR region
        ID),5,5,5,out:black</font></p>
        <p align="center"><font color="#FFFFFF">Lastly, in the
        node properties window for the displacer building roof,
        the caps, and BOTH of the displacer platforms, in the
        &quot;fade settings&quot; tab set all values to 5. That's
        the one on the roof AND the one in the other region. This
        makes those nodes fade out when you go down on the
        elevator. Just make sure you have a fade type = in
        trigger set up outside of the displacer building, or else
        it will stay faded out! Might as well have the fade type
        = out:black trigger just inside the door too, in case you
        enter from the bottom to use the displacer. This all
        makes sense when you read the fading tutorial, trust me.</font></p>
        <p align="center"><font color="#FFFFFF">Was that not the
        most annoying thing ever to set up? I thought so, but it
        sure does teach you a lot!</font></p>
