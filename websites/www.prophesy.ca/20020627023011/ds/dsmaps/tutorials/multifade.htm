        <td><p align="center"><font color="#FFFFFF">UPDATE: I
        have recieved a very informative e-mail from David
        Tomandl, one of the level designers for Dungeon Siege
        over at Gas Powered Games, revealing to me the lovely
        secrets of properly using that joyus fade_nodes trigger.
        Here is the e-mail he sent me:</font></p>
        <p align="center"><font color="#FFFFFF">&quot;Basically,
        you flag nodes with a specific Section, Level, and Object
        value (under the Fade Settings tab in Node properties),
        and refer to those values with the &quot;fade_nodes&quot;
        action in a trigger.&nbsp; So if you flagged the house
        roof as 1,2,3 (section, level, object), then in the
        fade_nodes action, you would need to paste the region
        guid (found under the Settings menu, in Region Settings),
        and fill out the Section/Level/Object values 1,2,3, along
        with the type of fade (usually &quot;out:black&quot; or
        &quot;in&quot;).&nbsp; Then when you walk through the
        trigger, all nodes in the region with those node fade
        flags will fade. Using this method, you can fade a house
        roof, or a dungeon, or a large field...even an entire
        region!&quot;</font></p>
        <p align="center"><font color="#FFFFFF">As you can see,
        I've been doing things the hard way, LOL. To reflect this
        change, I have updated the information in this tutorial
        accordingly.</font></p>
        <p align="center"><font color="#FFFFFF">This tutorial is
        for those who are having trouble with the 2 story, (or
        more) buildings and getting things to fade in and out
        properly.</font></p>
        <p align="center"><font color="#FFFFFF">First, create the
        base for the house, like this:</font></p>
        <p align="center"><font color="#FFFFFF"><img
        src="tutorials/mf1.JPG" width="580" height="372"></font></p>
        <p align="center"><font color="#FFFFFF">Next, add the
        door-top node to door 16 of the house. We're gonna want
        to make this node fade out on it's own when we enter and
        leave, so select the door-top node, open the node menu
        from the top, and select properties. Under the general
        tab, uncheck the bounds camera box, and check the camera
        fade box. Under the fade settings box, set all the valuse
        to 0. Done.</font></p>
        <p align="center"><font color="#FFFFFF">Next, add the
        stairs to door 15 of the house. next, add floor 2 to the
        house on door2 of the STAIRS. Select floor 2 node and set
        the properties to occludes camera and occludes light
        only. Under the &quot;fade settings&quot; tab in node
        properies (select the node, open the node menu up top
        then click on node properties), set section, level, and
        object all to 1. Add the roof to door 2 of floor 2. The
        generic-b-shingle and generic-b-thatch roofs fit. Under
        the &quot;fade settings&quot; tab of the roof in node
        properties, set section, level, and object all to 2.Hide
        the roof node by selecting it, selecting the node menu,
        and clicking hide node(s). Do the same for level 2. Now
        we want to create our triggers. Create 4 generic triggers
        located in game objects/gizmos/triggers, 1 outside the
        house steps, one just inside the door, one at the base of
        the stairs, and one on the landing that is almost at the
        top of the stairs. It should look like this:</font></p>
        <p align="center"><font color="#FFFFFF"><img
        src="tutorials/mf2.JPG" width="585" height="372"></font></p>
        <p align="center"><font color="#FFFFFF">Now we want to
        set up the triggers. On the trigger outside and inside
        the door, follow these steps:</font></p>
        <p align="center"><font color="#FFFFFF">1. Select the
        trigger, right click, properties, trigger properties.
        Click NEW at the bottom left, expand the tree at the top
        left, and select trigger_0. Add a new condition,
        party_member_within_bounding_box. Adjust the half diag X,
        Y, and Z values to the following: X=0.5 Y=1 Z=1. Add 2
        fade_nodes actions. From the settings menu on the top of
        the SE window, select region settings. Copy the region
        GUID number (CTRL-C or highlight, right click and select
        copy) and paste it in the Region GUID value field in the
        fade_nodes action boxes in the trigger properties window,
        located within the object properties window of the first
        trigger outside the door. In the Section, Level, and
        Object fields in the same box, enter 1 for all values of
        the first action, and 2 for all values in the second
        action. In both the fade_nodes actions, set the fade type
        to IN from the drop down menus. Copy everything from this
        first trigger and put it into the second trigger inside
        the door, but change the fade type to OUT:BLACK. Now when
        we enter the house, the first and second floors vanish,
        and when we exit, they fade back in. Now we want to make
        the second floor appear when we get to the landing in the
        middle of the stairs, and fade out again when we leave it
        from the bottom. Copy the settings for the first action
        of either of the triggers beside the door, both condition
        and action. It should have the Section, Level, and Object
        values of 1, and enter them into the trigger_generic at
        the bottom of the stairs. Set the fade type to IN. Select
        the trigger at the top of the stairs, and repeat the
        process for the one at the bottom, only with this one set
        the fade type to OUT:BLACK. Rotate and move your triggers
        accordingly, and you should have something that looks
        like this:</font></p>
        <p align="center"><font color="#FFFFFF"><img
        src="tutorials/mf3.JPG" width="577" height="360"></font></p>
        <p align="center"><font color="#FFFFFF">That's all there
        is to it! You're done! Save the map, export as .dsmap,
        and play it!</font></p>
        <p align="center"><font color="#FFFFFF">What you can do
        with this, as mentioned above in the e-mail sent to me by
        David Tomandl, is set ANY node you want to fade with that
        trigger to have the same Section, Level, and Object
        values, making it possible to fade like 200 floors on a
        super high tower, or even fade a whole region! This is
        how you make the rest of the world fade out when you
        enter a dungeon that goes underneath the ground, such as
        Cellars and Crypts and whatnot. You'd simply use
        &quot;select all regions&quot; from the node menu up at
        the top, then select node properties from the same menu
        (this will adjust the settings for every node in the
        region), and set the Section, Level, and Object fields
        all to the same numbers. You would then set the same
        settings for the stairs and the dungeon all to 2, that
        way, the one fade_nodes trigger you'd have at the top of
        the stairs for the cellar would fade out the whole region
        except for the dungeon and stairs. I would advise that
        you make the dungeon a seperate region, then stitch it to
        the stairs. It makes the game run smoother. Isn't this
        terrific? I knew you'd love it!</font></p>
