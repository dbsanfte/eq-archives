        This program converts Dungeon Siege v1.1 maps (from the
        Siege Editor Beta) to the v1.0 format (That the unpatched
        Dungeon Siege understands)<br>
        <br>
        Usage:<br>
        1. Build your map in the Siege Editor.<br>
        2. Save it as a .dsmap file somewhere. When saving
        uncheck the 'Include in build' under lqd options.<br>
        3. Use TankViewer to extract the contents of the .dsmap
        file and then delete it (the .dsmap file that is.)<br>
        4. Run DSMConvert.exe, click 'Fix map...' and select the
        main.gas file residing in the root dir of your
        (extracted) map.<br>
        5. Watch as DSMConvert changes the local guids to the
        global ones of all the areas in your map.<br>
        6. Use TankCreator to build a tank of your map again,
        place it in /Dungeon Siege/Maps/<br>
        7. Start Dungeon Siege and take a stroll through your new
        map.<br>
        <br>
        Revision history<br>
        1.01 - Fixed one bug that appeared when running the
        program on the same map twice.<br>
        1.00 - Initial release.<br>
        <br>
        Disclaimer: The usual. Im not in any way responsible for
        any damage that might happen to your
        map/computer/body/house and/or pet when using this
        program.<br>

        <p><font color="#FFFF00" size="5">Method 2</font></p>
        <p><font color="#FFFFFF"><br>
        I found another (much simpler) way of using </font><a
        href="files/programs/DSMConvert.exe" target="_BLANK"><font
        color="#0000FF">DSMConvert</font></a><font
        color="#FFFFFF">. This makes it possible to directly use
        the 'Save Map as .dsmap' option and then start the map in
        Dungeon <br>
        Siege without the hassle of having to
        uncompress/convert/recompress it.<br>
        <br>
        These are the steps you need to follow (I know it's a bit
        long, but you only need to do 1-5 once):<br>
<SPAN class="bold">        1.</SPAN> First you need a map to work with, either if you
        choose to use a map you've already created (<SPAN class="underline">don't</SPAN> forget
        to back it up! <SPAN class="underline">very</SPAN> important!) or decide to create a new
        one.<br>
        Anyway, make sure you have a map with at least one region
        and a node and make sure its properly saved.<br>
        <br>
<SPAN class="bold">        2.</SPAN> Close the Siege Editor and start DSMConvert.<br>
        <br>
<SPAN class="bold">        3.</SPAN> Now click the 'Fix Map...' button and browse to your
        '/My Documents/Dungeon Siege/Bits/world/maps/%mapname%/'
        folder. (%mapname is, you guessed it, the name of the map
        you're going to convert). Select the main.gas file and
        watch as DSMConvert does it's job.<br>
        <br>
<SPAN class="bold">        4.</SPAN> Now that the map is converted to a v1.0 map, you need
        to tell SE this. So open the main.gas file in your
        favourite text editor (Notepad, Skritpad, Ultraedit or
        whatever you use) In this file you will find a line that
        says &quot;b use_node_mesh_index = true;&quot;. This is
        what tells SE to use the mesh index. Change the line to
        read &quot;b use_node_mesh_index = false;&quot;, or
        remove it completely as it defaults to false. Save.<br>
        <br>
<SPAN class="bold">        5.</SPAN> Start the Siege Editor again and make sure the map and
        region(s) loads correctly. SE will identify the map as a
        v1.0 map, and will save it in that format from now on.<br>
        <br>
<SPAN class="bold">        6.</SPAN> Now, most of us probably tried making a .dsmap of our
        map even though we were told it wouldn't work (after all,
        the last thing a human being abandons is hope), and we
        all found that the map didnt show up in Dungeon Siege.
        This is because GPG changed the 'Min. Required version'
        tag of the saved .dsmap file so Dungeon Siege won't load
        it. But there is a way around this too. When you save
        your map as a .dsmap file the 'Min Version' box will
        read: &quot;00.[05].2002.03.0801&quot; but if you open up
        the saved tank in TankViewer and look, it has been set to
        &quot;00.[05].<SPAN class="underline">4002</SPAN>.03.0801&quot;. SE adds 2000 to the
        third field to make sure the maps do not show up in DS as
        it doesn't support the new format without the patch. But,
        we altered our map, didn't we, it's in the v1.0 format
        and should load nicely. So, when you make a .dsmap out of
        your map, change the 'Min Version' box to read
        &quot;00.[05].<SPAN class="underline">2</SPAN>.03.0801&quot;. SE will add 2000 to the
        field and it will read 2002, just like any other tank
        created by TankCreator (and the original .dsres files).<br>
        <br>
<SPAN class="bold">        7.</SPAN> Save the .dsmap in the '/My Documents/Dungeon
        Siege/Maps' or the '/Dungeon Siege/Maps' folder.<br>
        <br>
<SPAN class="bold">        8.</SPAN> Start Dungeon Siege, load your map and enjoy.<br>
        <br>
        Remember, next time you want to export your map from SE,
        just save it as .dsmap, change the 'Min Version' box to
        &quot;00.[05].2.03.0801&quot; and play!</font><br>
