        color="#0000FF">WORLD LOCATIONS</font></a><font

        if you have a large world, or are planning to make your
        world large.</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font color="#FFFFFF">On a completely
        unrelated note, but still a warning, I will be away this
        weekend from today until Monday, June 10th, as I am going
        to a friend's graduation ceremony, and plan to get
        excessively drunk. That means, don't bother e-mailing me
        unless it's IMPORTANT! Such as, you absolutely MUST know
        how to do something, and will die or kill yourself if I
        don't show you. Ok? OK! Man this is gonna kick ass...</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font color="#FFFFFF">I finally read
        &quot;The Fellowship of the Rings&quot;, the first in
        J.R.R. Tolkien's &quot;Lord of the Rings&quot; Trilogy,
        and I severly regret not having read it earlier. What an
        amazing piece of literature! It gave me some great ideas
        for lore in the land of Athesia, but I WON'T rip off any
        stuff from it (at least not DIRECTLY. Some things may
        remind you slightly of it, but the similarities will be
        just that. As for those of you who haven't seen the movie
        or read the books yet, I truly pity you as both are
        amazing. Everyone remember the Balrog of Kazad-Dum,
        Durin's Bane? When I saw that in the movie, I thought to
        myself &quot;THAT is exactly how I pictured a
        Balrog&quot;. Expect that SOB to be in the Land of
        Athesia, if I can make the model for it. That's gonna
        take a lot of time, but I will make sure it loks really
        cool, with fire and smoke effects and all. PHEAR THE
        BALROG!</font></p>

        <p align="left"><font color="#FFFFFF">I am holding a
        SKINS contest, to see if anyone is willing to help make
        the land of Athesia the kick-ass place it was meant to
        be. This contest will be for &quot;Elves&quot; skins,
        male and female. So bust open your Photoshop and stark
        churning out those ksins, and we'll see what everyone
        comes up with! I will put up a poll in exactly a weeks
        time with everyone's skins, so that YOU, the community,
        can choose the best of the best. ROCK ON! Just attach the
        PSD or equivalent file to an E-MAIL, and I'll post them
        in the soon-to-be-created skins section of Athesia.</font></p>

        <p align="left"><font color="#FFFFFF">UPDATE: Added a new
        tutorial, seems as though some ppl have been having
        problem with making doors that are activated by switches
        so here it is, </font><a

        color="#FFFFFF">. Enjoy!</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font color="#FFFFFF">It seems that the
        closer I get to completing the Spider Caverns, the less I
        want to do it, lol. I am so close it isn't even funny, I
        could be done in like 3 hours, tops. Only problem is,
        it's all mostly placement of scenery, and that consits of
        large amounts of cobwebs and mucosas and spiders. Trust
        me, it isn't as fun as you'd think it would be! I do plan
        to take my friend's advice and &quot;suck it up,
        bitch!&quot; and just finish what I started. From there,
        I will be able to create the transition forest from
        valley to swamp, which will then connect to Blight Bog.
        That in turn will connect to The Ancient City of Tenesia.
        Expect &quot;unusual&quot; things to happen to the
        storyline there. I won't give anything away, suffice to
        say it will be things you will not be expecting...</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font color="#FFFFFF">I have ideas for a
        final boss too, everything is starting to fit together as
        I write more lore books. I'm really quite happy with the
        storyline so far, and I hope it will only get better. The
        lore books I make will simply be supplimental knowledge
        to the history of Athesia, and may go so far as to
        include short stories/accounts written by the residents
        of my land. I hope to make an experience that adds just a
        bit more &quot;character&quot; to the area which you
        journey, as I found that lands such as Ebb and the Urtaen
        Penninsula were magnificently designed, but failed to
        really convey the &quot;feeling&quot; of a land that had
        any sort of history, other than the scattered bits of
        ruins and whatnot that you discovered as you journeyed
        through them. </font></p>
        <p align="left"><font color="#FFFFFF">I recieved a very
        good suggestion from a visitor to the site, about
        alternative modes of transport between cities. Things
        like boats, hot air balloons, etc. </font></p>
        <p align="left"><font color="#FFFFFF">I'd like to at
        LEAST make boats, like you take a boat from one town to
        the other, as opposed to using things such as the HUB. I
        will still have Displacer Platforms, as these make it
        easier to join up with people who are scattered around
        the land, and are good for heading back to town for
        supplies every once in a while. True, as of right now
        Frostdale DOES have a HUB platform, but I think
        &quot;certain&quot; cities will not have them, and will
        only be reachable by other means. One of these cities
        will most definitely be the Dark Elf city of Drak
        Vilerran, which is deep within the Underworld, and will
        require a long journey to reach. This town will be a
        pivotal area in the storyline, so expect it to be nothing
        short of spectacular. Same goes for the city of
        Qwithnairn, the city of the elves. It's gonna look
        WICKED. I would not do any less for the magnificent
        elves, as they have been around since before the days of
        man.</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font color="#FFFFFF">Suffice to say,
        things will only get darker and more opressive as the
        storyline moves on, and you will be fighting some truly
        &quot;colossal&quot; foes. You think rock beasts are big?
        Mwa ha ha, you ain't seen NOTHIN yet ;-)</font></p>

        the displacer platforms got me interested in the HUB, so
        I tinkered with it until I got it working, and it works
        good! In fact, it was easier to do than the displacer
        platforms! Only problem is once you get into the hub, if
        you try any of the other switches it crashes DS :-\</font></p>
