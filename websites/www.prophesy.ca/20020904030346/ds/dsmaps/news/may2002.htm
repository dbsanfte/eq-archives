        <p align="left"><font color="#FFFFFF">By popular demand,
        and my own curiosity, I spent 2 hours last night trying
        to figure out Displacer Platforms. You know, the
        elevators that take you REALLY far, REALLY fast? Kinda
        like teleporters, but there's no need to say &quot;beam
        me up scotty&quot;. Strange coincidence, if you have ever
        watched the original Sart Trek series, you would realize
        that NOT ONCE does ANYONE say the phrase &quot;beam me
        up, scotty&quot;. Not once. Don't believe me? Watch em
        all and you'll see ;-)</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font color="#FFFFFF">Back to the real
        news. I made a tutorial which explains how to make your
        own displacers, but it takes quite a while to do. I hope
        that by following my instructions, not only will you get
        it working properly, but quickly. I'm hoping it will take
        you about 30-40 minutes to do it. Check it out </font><a

        and let me know if anything needs calrification. Don't
        attempt it if you don't know what SCID's, GUID's, door
        numbers, nodes, objects, or anything like that are. This
        is an intermediate tutorial :-D</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font color="#FFFFFF">I have also made
        some major revisions and tweaks for Athesia. I found that
        in order to have the custom content appear, you will need
        to download 2 files. First you will need the </font><a

        Dungeon Siege/resources. I wil make in inastaller that
        will do this for you automatically in the future, but for
        now you're gonna have to do it manually :-)</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font color="#FFFFFF">Among the changes
        is a working displacer platform, and some tweaks in the
        Ancient Temple and Northwind Cellar. Also added &quot;set
        player world location&quot; entries (the messages that
        popup saying &quot;so and so has entered whichever
        place&quot;). A tutorial on that soon, don't worry!</font></p>

        <p align="left"><font color="#FFFFFF">WHEW! I've been
        really busy trying to get this one region I've made
        finished, only problem is, it's HUGE! Like, 2080 nodes or
        something like that. It's totally insane, but man does it
        ever look good! Upon exiting the ancient ruins at the top
        of Northwind Peak, you come out into a cave, that exists
        to a big gorge with a rope brige across it. The area then
        becomes a heavily wooded forest, complete with big-ass
        sequia pine trees and lots of great looking foliage. You
        traverse the forest, which a merchant NPC lives in (Horty
        Olaf, but with a different name), crossing over a river
        in another gorge before ending up in some cool looking
        forested canyons. At the end of the canyons, you descend
        the far wall and cross the river at the bottom using a
        stone bridge, which leads to a cave entrance inside the
        canyon walls. That cave leads to the Spider Caverns, so
        expect the same kind of monsters you'd be fighting in
        Hovard's Folly. I don't think I'll have skeletons in
        there though, as there are more than enuff in the Ancient
        Ruins! It looks really great, but I haven't fnished
        adding all the scenery yet. As for monsters, the only
        place that has any is the Ancient Ruins at the top of
        Northwind. I plan to get my map to the ruined city of
        Tenesia in Blight Bog before I go back and start adding
        monsters. I will then play-test the map up to Tenesia
        with monsters added, to make sure it IS possible to live
        through it all. Don't expect anything as easy as the maps
        GPG made though, this is going to be TOUGH! It can get
        boring killing the same weak monsters all the time, so I
        plan to throw a few slightly tougher ones at you here and
        there, just to keep things interesting :-D</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font color="#FFFFFF">Other than that, I
        am also still working on the complete list of all moods,
        but it is a rather slow process, as I need to test EVERY
        SINGLE MOOD to see what it does and how it may be used. I
        hope that when I am done I will have a good description
        of all the moods, so that you can easily pick and choose
        which one you are looking for. I may end up putting them
        in a searchable database, so you can enter a string like
        &quot;dark forest mood&quot; or &quot;snowy mood&quot;,
        and the search result will display all matching moods. I
        haven't had much experience with this before, so if
        anyone out there is good with databases and is willing to
        help, please </font><a

        <p align="left"><font color="#FFFFFF">I've got some grand
        ideas for Athesia once that Gmax pack comes out that
        let's us make our own models for DS. Firsly, I plan on

        <p align="left"><font color="#FFFFFF">Considering I have
        3D Studio MAX as well, I'm hoping GPG releases their .ASP
        file format mesh import/export plugin for it. I'm sure
        when they developed it, they made it so it JUST worked,
        so maybe a 3rd party will get ahold of it and fix it up a
        bit. Once the ability to make models and custom nodes
        becomes available, I will be EXTREMELY busy churning out
        custom content for Athesia. Keep checking back for

        <p align="left"><font color="#FFFFFF">Is it just me or is
        the 1.09b patch giving a LOT of people problems? I've
        heard nothing but complaints about it, but I got it to
        work no prob 1st time. Must be the stupid luck that's
        been following me around lately :-p</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font color="#FFFFFF">I must say,
        Zonematch is a lot faster with the patch, and my
        framerate has jumped up by about 10 FPS, but nothing
        really dramatic has been changed. The Zonematch interface
        has been juiced up, and has a few more options, such as
        adding filters. I still think they need a &quot;sort by
        ping&quot; option, dammit! There's nothing worse than
        getting that stupid icon with the 2 computers and the
        lightning bolt, or the turtle when you're the server! </font></p>
        <p align="left"><font color="#FFFFFF">I've been buggering
        around with skrit and gas files lately, more specifically
        the TEMPLATES. Teplates effect all kinds of crap, but I'm
        mostly going for modifying the templates for enemies
        right now. You see, I need to create the base template
        for the Necromancers, and specialized templates for each
        one. I'm trying to take the &quot;Bandits&quot;, and
        modify them so that they cast spells and such. I've
        almost gotten it figured out, but for some reason they
        keep switching to melee attack anyways. Weird...</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font color="#FFFFFF">Another few things
        I will be doing once the appropriate resources are made
        available is the models for the Elves and Dark Elves. I'm
        thinking of just taking the farmboy and farmgirl meshes
        and modifying them (make them slimmer, longer hair, the
        tell-tale elven ears, etc.). As for skins, I'll make
        those when I've got the meshes made. This is gonna be
        great once that GMAX pack comes out from Microsoft. I
        asked one of the guys over at GPG if they could provide
        me with some of their in-house tools, such as
        import/export plugins for 3D Studio MAX (which I own). No
        reply yet, but I only sent it last night, so we'll see
        how it goes :-D</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font color="#FFFFFF">Sorry, but I don't
        have any really new content for you all except a revision
        of the Athesia map, which now extends to Northwind Peak,
        and ends in the start of the dungeon up at the top. Just
        to let you know, what I've made so far is about 1/90th of
        the total world I am planning. In other words, add 89
        more of the same thing and you have a basic idea of how
        big it will be. I'm hoping about 6 hours of gameplay.
        That means about 3 - 4 months of development time for the
        maps, not including any skrit/gas editing that needs to
        be done. I hope to add neat features such as rideable
        mounts, like horses and dragons and such. They will be
        expensive, but will be well worth it, especially to
        weaker classes like pure combat/nature mages and such.
        I'm also going to make some custom music for my map, as I
        have a great software package to make a soundtrack with.
        I'm starting to think that eventually I'm going to have
        to put a team together. The only thing I would really
        care about is that I AM THE BOSS! lol</font></p>

        color="#0000FF" size="3">www.planetdungeonsiege.com</font></a><font

        with me here.</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font color="#FFFFFF">&quot;I agree with
        Kasper 100%. The chances of getting an editor this
        functional from ANY game company are very slim, indeed.
        Sure, you could bring up things like the Starcraft
        editor, but CMON, Dungeon Siege is a WAY more complicated
        game than Starcraft, so to compare a 2D and 3D level
        editor is just stupid. Not only stupid, but almost
        unthinkable. For a 3D WORLD editor, Siege Editor is
        amazing. Before it came out, I imagined what it would be
        like to use, and it's pretty much what I guessed it to
        be, but with way more things than I could ever dream.
        Sure there's bugs, but it IS a BETA, and beta's require
        testing and bug reporting in order to fix them and polish
        them off. The latest version of SE has already fixed many
        bugs from the first version, sadly there are a bunch that
        are still there. Future versions will have less and less
        bugs, until eventually it is a flawless and uncrashable
        program. It takes people who are willing to use it
        regrdless of the bugs and report them to make it a better
        product. Those of you who give up too easily, obviously
        weren't interested enough in creating your own maps in
        the first place. Give GPG a break already, it's not like
        they HAD to give us the Siege Editor, they did it because
        they want us to be able to do what WE want with the game.
        GPG doesn't need to hire as many beta testers for it's
        products that way, it gets the community involved in that
        process. To be a part of that process myself is an honor

        <p align="left"><font color="#FFFFFF" size="3">Today I
        recieved a very informative e-mail from </font><font
        color="#FFFFFF">David Tomandl over at Gas Powered Games,
        explaining the use of the &quot;fade_nodes&quot; trigger.
        This humble trigger allows for a greater versatility of
        node fading, but without the hassle of creating a
        &quot;fade_node&quot; trigger for every node you want to
        fade. It's amazing that the people over there at
        Gaspowered pay attention to their community, it's very
        rare that a game company does such a thing. So, to keep
        things fresh and cutting edge, I have updated the
        tutorial as necessary. Check it out </font><a
        href="dsmaps/tutorials/multifade.htm"><font
        color="#0000FF">HERE</font></a><font color="#FFFFFF">.
        Work on my world continues, as I fight with the evil
        forces of the Stitch Builder to create my stitch index
        PROPERLY. Am I the only one having problems with the
        stitching in this damn thing? lol</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font color="#FFFFFF">It seems as though
        the sitch builder doesn't want to create a proper
        boundary, instead it acts like a turd and makes my nodes
        go all flashy and dissapear when I test it in-game.
        Sometimes, the destination node ends up UNDERNEATH the
        original entrance, and my character does a cool ass
        moonwalk through space-time into the weirdo region below.
        I'm sure someone has seen this before, it's quite amusing
        the first time, but causes me to swear and curse in
        frustration these days. I've figured out how to make it
        work flawlessly now, but it hasn't been easy. I will also
        be researching the creation of your very own NPC custom
        talk skrits, so expect that information available in a
        week or less, depending on how easy it is to do. I will
        make up a base template and create a &quot;no
        techno-babble&quot; explanation of how to make it all
        work. That's right, your days of speaking in SKRIT are
        OVER!! now if you'll excuse me, I need to
        we_require_activate my need for value = food and search
        my fridge directory for some munchies_object.</font></p>

        you usually have with hireable NPC's. I've found out a
        few new things, but nothing thats worth putting up on a
        tutorial, YET. I will continue to mess with my tank files
        in an attempt to load up the custom skrits I made along
        with my map. I did, however, figure out a few things that
        were problematic with certain NPC's in the Siege Editor,
        such as Potion/Spell vendors, and regular NPC's that you
        talk to. I haven't bothered with trying to figure out
        quests yet, but I will start with that soon, to be sure.

        attempt to ovveride the settings the editor may have put
        in place. SO far the Blacksmith works fine, as well as
        certain other NPC's such as the barkeep Garek, a lady in
        the bar, and guard captain. There's way more NPC;s than
        that, including 2 hireables, so who knows, I'll keep
        trying. Keep in mind that this is the FIRST town of my

        HUGE map, GPG came up with a technique called stitching.
        First, a breakdown of how maps work. Let's say you have a
        main area with a dungeon and a cave. The main area, the
        dungeon, and the cave, are all their own seperate
        &quot;region&quot;. A map is divided into regions, and
        are stitched together at certain points. Ever notice how
        the game gets smoother when you go into a dungeon? Less
        to draw right? WRONG. Less level to load is what it is.
        Right at the entrance would be where the stitch takes
        place. This allows for seamless integration. GENIOUS! I
        love the flexability this editor has, and even though I
        had problems with getting it working initially, I think
        I've figured out most of the quirks. The only
        disadvantage I have right now is not being able to
        actually PLAY my map, due to the lack of the 1.09 beta
        patch. I'm hoping GPG releases it before Friday, so I can
        do some in-game testing. I will post my map in the </font><a
        href="dsmaps/maps.htm"><font color="#0000FF">MAPS</font></a><font
        color="#FFFFFF"> section when I feel it is at a playable
        level. Expect a beta release within a week or so.</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font color="#FFFFFF">Until then, happy
        Dungeoneering, and enjoy this fine game!</font></p>

        <p align="left"><font color="#FFFFFF">I just put this
        website up, so any of you unfortunate souls who happen to
        come by, WELCOME TO MY NIGHTMARE! </font></p>
        <p align="left"><font color="#FFFFFF">Seriously though,
        as I'm sure you are aware, Gas Powered Games released a
        beta of the Siege Editor today. What is the Siege Editor?
        Well, it lets you make your own worlds to be precise.
        Where can you get it? Right </font><a
        href="http://download.microsoft.com/download/DungeonSiege/Utility/1.0/W982KMeXP/EN-US/SiegeEditorInstall.exe"><font
        color="#0000FF">HERE</font></a><font color="#FFFFFF">.
        I've included a link in the downloads page as well. Oh
        don't get TOO excited yet...apparently until the 1.09
        beta patch comes out, we will be able to create and work
        on our new maps, but not play them. Bummer! I'm sure GPG
        has a good reason for not releasing the patch yet, and
        I'm sure we'd all LOVE to hear what it is ;-)</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font color="#FFFFFF">In the meantime,
        check out the downloads I'm offering to you, including
        some handy tools for opening and creating tank files
        (dsres, dsmap,dsparty, etc.) as well as a .GAS file
        editor. In the media section, I have taken a few screens
        of my first map in it's development stages, aptly titled
        &quot;Mike's Test Map&quot;. It's gonna take me a little
        while to get this whole world building thing down, but
        this is easier than making DOOM levels was! Expect some
        really fun maps and mods by me in the future, including a
        COLUSSEUM for PvP battles and various Single Player and
        Multiplayer Questing maps. Until my next update, fare
        thee all well, and HAPPY SIEGING!</font></p>
