        <br>
        The Land of Athesia has seen it's fare share of war and
        desctruction. From the rise and fall of the <br>
        Dark Armies who invaded from the seas to the west a
        thousand years ago, to the interracial war <br>
        known as The Purification. 40 years after the
        purification, each of the races, Humans, Elves, Dwarves, <br>
        Droog, and Krug, have found a tenative balance among each
        other. The Humans, being the most <br>
        prosperous of the races, Claimed the southern continent.
        Dispersed goblin camps were spared any <br>
        further destruction, but at a cost. The Goblins were
        given a swampy area of land to the Southeast, <br>
        now known as the Goblin Moors. The Dwarves, now on good
        terms with the Humans, reside within <br>
        their mountain fortress of Cairnwotlen in the center of
        the Mithril Mountains to the south. As for the <br>
        Droog, they took the eastern desert known as the Burning
        Sands, as it is their preferred climate and is close to
        the shoreline. <br>
        The Droog still hold tenantive trade routes with the
        Humans and Dwarves, but it is tenative at best for sure. <br>
        Secluded within Qwithnesti, the ancient Elves took the
        northern part of the continent, including the <br>
        Northern Forest and Northvale. As the Elves distrust all
        other races, they swore that any tresspassers <br>
        would be killed upon sight. To the Southeast of
        Northvale, the Krug have calimed the vast swamps <br>
        known as Blight Mire, setting up a primitive city within
        the ancient ruins of Tenesia upon the Bay of Blight. <br>
        <br>
        All was well despite the few skirmishes that arose at
        times, but now a new threat has arose from the <br>
        depths of the vast caves and tunnels under the Mithril
        Mountains. <br>
        <br>
        Long ago, an elven Magus known as Lord Soth began to
        experiment with the ancient and dark powers of <br>
        Necromancy, effectively being able to control the forces
        of life and death itself. The Elven High Council saw <br>
        this as a dessacration of life, and banished Lord Soth
        into the Underworld. Taking his followers with him, <br>
        Lord Soth traversed the twisting, endless caverns and
        passages of the Underworld until he found a huge cavern <br>
        with an underground hotspring, and vast groves of strange
        underground plant and animal life. The area was rich <br>
        and was the perfect place to start a new civilization.
        After 1000 years, the Dark City known as Drak Vilerran
        was <br>
        flourishing, and a new race of Elves, the Dark Elves,
        were growing in numbers and power. Now, Lord Soth has <br>
        decided it is the time to reclaim the surface world which
        was denied to him by his Kin. Entrusting his most adept
        students with the command of their own Undead Armies, the
        Dark Elven Necromancers forged a dark pact, and became
        known as The Six Deaths, Dromael, Eithos, Anasia,
        Trevail, Habrina, and Soth. With their Undead Legions,
        coupled with the witless Krug with whom a deal was
        struck, the Six Deaths have begun their assault upon the
        land of Athesia, and are using the powers of terror and
        darkness to bring suffering and terror upon those <br>
        of the surface world. It is truly the stuff of nightmares
        come to life...<br>
        <br>
        You are a former merchant from Arnheim, who fled from
        their due to perilous circumstances and moved to the
        secluded<br>
        snowy valley where the Town of Frostwind lies. The Town
        Guard has issued a lockdown, the Necromancer Legions are <br>
        beginning their invasion, and preperations for war are
        underway. Are you the one who will rise to the occasion
        and seek <br>
        out Lord Soth and destroy the leaders of the Necromancer
        Legions? Then enter The Land of Athesia, and prepare for
        an <br>
        epic adventure that will thrill and haunt you for ages to
        come.<br>

        <br>
        Moving to Frostdale was a good idea. Life in Akrain was
        getting a bit too &quot;dangerous&quot; for <br>
        any person's liking. Even though it meant leaving all
        your connections and friends behind, at least<br>
        your Aunt Tessie and Uncle Garek lived there. It wasn't
        like you had a choice in the matter, the<br>
        Royal Guard of Akrain were looking for you, and even went
        so far as to offer a 1,000 gold pieces <br>
        reward to anyone who turned you in. Sneaking past the
        guards late one night, you ascended the city<br>
        walls, and began your trek to freedom. The journey to
        Frostdale was not without peril, however.<br>
        You almost died on several occasions, and were forced to
        take up a job as a caravan guard in<br>
        Cairnwotlin for the Dwarves. The pay was good, but those
        Dwarves never left you alone for a second.<br>
        It was like they were picking on you. But how could you
        blame them, what with all the tension between<br>
        the races of Athesia. 3 months after your escape from
        Akrain, you arrived from the Crystal Caverns to<br>
        the sight of the Frostdale Tower of Mystecism looming in
        your vision. The smell of wood fires was faint<br>
        in the gentle, but cold winds as snow whipped across your
        face. &quot;What a barren place&quot; you thought to
        yourself,<br>
        but the dismal weather did not hide the sounds of
        merrymaking that wafted from the Inn past the Tower. <br>
        Opening the door, you fought with the wind to prevent the
        door from being blown off it's hinges. You turned<br>
        around, and traversed the rose carpet leading to the
        stairs up to the bar. Who else was the innkeeper<br>
        and bartender of the Frostdale Pub &amp; Inn but your
        very own Uncle Garek! <br>
        <br>
        &quot;Garek! I can't believe it! I haven't seen you in a
        long time old man, how are you?&quot; you exclaimed.<br>
        <br>
        &quot;Wha...who are you? ... wait a minute, OF COURSE!
        How are ye doin youngin? You've grown!<br>
        Here, take a seat by the fire and I'll get you a cup of
        mulled wine to warm your blood! Tessie!<br>
        Tessie, you won't believe who's here!&quot; Bellowed your
        Uncle Garek<br>
        <br>
        The sounds and smells of the Inn were warm and
        comfortable, washing away the hardships of your<br>
        long journey. All thoughts of your former life in Akrain
        slowly faded away. At last, you could find some peace in
        the turmoil that plagues the land as of late.<br>
        <br>
        Two years pass by, your Uncle Garek being a rather
        wealthy man in Frostdale, gives you your own<br>
        house beside the Inn. It's small, but it's yours and you
        love it more than anything. Working the<br>
        bar late nights, keeping the fire going and cooking meals
        for patrons, and maintaining the suites upstairs, you
        manage to not <br>
        only earn your keep, but extra money on the side. The
        local blacksmith has taken a liking to you,<br>
        and hopes to teach you the secrets of metalwork. <br>
        <br>
        But peace can only stay for so long. Reports of invasion
        have begun to surface from the Southern reaches<br>
        of Akrain and the towns to the East and West . Legions of
        Undead are stalking the lands, laying <br>
        waste to towns and farms, killing the innocent in what
        looks like coordinated attacks, planned by the <br>
        force controlling the undead hordes. Nobody knows for
        sure, but the local Magus has reason to believe it is the
        <br>
        work of Necromancers.<br>
        <br>
        Dark Elven Necromancers. <br>
        <br>
        Not only that, but the usually peacefull Krug have taken
        alliance with the Undead Legions, and swarm<br>
        from Blight Bog and the ruined city of Har Ganeth,
        looting and pillaging caravans and secluded<br>
        homes. The Captain of the Town Guard of Frostdale has
        issued a lockdown, preventing anyone <br>
        entering or leaving Frostdale without his explicit
        permission. <br>
        <br>
        Feeling helpless in the middle of all this, you seek the
        advise of your Uncle Garek, who through<br>
        the days past has come to rely upon you as his most
        trusted of Kin. </font></p>
        <p align="center"><font color="#FFFFFF">&quot;What should
        I do, Uncle? I feel as though I must do something, not
        stand idly by and watch as<br>
        the world goes to the Abyss! I don't know who or what is
        responsable, but if anyone can find out, <br>
        somehow I just KNOW it's me! I know it sounds crazy, but
        I must!&quot; you exclaim.<br>
        <br>
        &quot;I understand, oh how I understand. You are growing,
        and so you crave adventure and a purpose.<br>
        I was like that too, when I was your age. I travelled to
        far lands in search of fame and fortune, but after<br>
        what seemed an eternity my travels were for naught. And
        so I came to find myself here, a lone merchant<br>
        with barely the shirt on his back, a mule, and a rickety
        old wagon. I stayed here and worked the Inn,<br>
        and it was passed to me when the last owner died of
        pneumonia. Oh, he was a great man, kind and<br>
        honorable. I still feel like I didn't accomplish
        something in my journeys though. So perhaps, it is YOU<br>
        who must.&quot; said Garek.<br>
        <br>
        And so, you prepare for the long journey to the ruins of
        Tenesia and beyond, hoping you won't die and knowing<br>
        that at the end of all this, you will have accomplished
        something great. Any and all you meet will<br>
        know that you are the one to change the course of history
        on Athesia. These are indeed dark times,<br>
        and you are the light that shines through it.</font></p>
