<P>There was a time when the races of man were near extinction.
Freeport was a small independent city threatened from all sides
by the Orcish Horde. During this age the Orcs held the barbarian
people in check. The Orcs had constructed massive cities and built
towering temples in the name of Rallos Zek. The elder races had
been forced back, the Dwarves hid in Kaladim while the Elves retreated
to their cities using magic to obscure them from the Orcish armies.
Emperor Crush I ruled over the continents of Antonica and Faydwer
with an iron grip. His legions numbered in the hundreds of thousands
and included the Trolls and Ogres. The world was on the verge
of endless damnation.</P>

<P>Far north through High Hold Pass and beyond the twisty maze
of BlackBurrow laid Everfrost and the frozen ground where Halas
would one day stand. The inhabitants, a savage race, were under
the yoke of the Orcish juggernaut. Snow Orcs had built their towering
cities in Everfrost off the back of the Barbarians. For hours
each day barbarians would break their backs not in battle but
in hauling stone for use in the construction of blasphemous temples.
It is said that at this time a small group of slaves escaped into
the icy mountains. This small group would be the catalyst for
a change that would rock all of Norrath.</P>

<P>The escaped slaves were a hardy sort; they were more than capable
of surviving the frigid surroundings. They had one thought on
their mind, freeing their brothers and sisters. In the weeks to
come after their escape they built homes of rough wood. A great
forge was constructed of stone and named &quot;Ur Fusha&quot;,
First Forge. Ancient knowledge of metalsmithing was put to use
creating the weapons of iron. The barbarians hunted bear and snow
leopards using the skins to make armor and the meat to survive.
After a year they were ready. It was time for the first assault.
The forces were broken into clans. One of these clans was Clan
Blackwatch.</P>

<P>It was a cool morning in the snowy canyons of Everfrost when
the Clans tasted their first bite of vengeance. A squad of Orcish
troopers was marching a group of slaves through the looming canyons.
A roar echoed through the icy corridors. Bear-skinned Barbarian
warriors jumped from the sides of the canyons. The Orcs were stunned
as sharp swords and heavy axes hewed them from all sides. The
slaves seeing these fearsome raiders used their chains to throttle
their Orcish captors. Within seconds all the troopers were lying
in the snow, green blood leaking out and raising steam where it
ran.</P>

<P>The raids continued and many warriors were freed. The news
slowly trickled back to Emperor Crush. Furious, he sent an entire
division to Everfrost to put an end to the uprising. Due to the
raids the barbarians had grown in number greatly. There were two
thousand strong but were not ready to face a division of Crush's
elite troops. The problem was, at this time, they were foolish
enough to try.</P>

<P>In a whirl of steel a thousand screaming Clansmen and women
met their deaths that day. The Orcs training, fine steel weapons
and the magic of Tier 'Dal casters were impossible to overcome.
Even though the battle was lost the event sent ripples out over
Norrath. In a far away land others took notice.</P>

<P>On the continent of Odus lay the city of Erduin. They had removed
themselves from Antonica to pursue their studies into the arts
of magic. Most considered themselves above association with the
other races. But there were some who did not agree with the isolationist
attitudes of the Council of Erudin. One such individual was a
young magician. She had read of Antonica and sought to study it
more directly. When the news of the barbarian uprising reached
Erudin she was determined to go and study these warriors. Packing
a few books and scrolls, donning a pure blue robe, she slipped
out of Erudin in the dead of night. Traveling in a small boat
she sailed north landing on the shores of Antonica.</P>

<P>Using a map that dated back to the combine age she made her
way into the mountains avoiding Orcish outposts and other dangers
along the way. After weeks of travel she came to Everfrost. Shortly
after her entrance into the snowy wastes barbarian scouts discovered
her. As she trudged through the snow she looked up to find herself
surrounded by gigantic warriors. She thought better of using her
powers knowing there were too many and instead returned with them
to their camp. The clans weren't sure what to do, she clearly
wasn't an Orc but wasn't a barbarian either. The women laughed
at her because she appeared frail and couldn't wield a sword,
while the men were cautious of any being that wasn't a barbarian.
It was determined that a gathering of the Clans was needed to
determine the dusky skinned outlander's fate.</P>

<P>Five Clans sat at the gathering that day. They formed a circle
surrounding the small Erudite mage. She shivered as the snow fell
around her. She had been in the barbarians' camp for nearly an
entire month and had learned much of their language. One thing
she had discovered was that there was gentleness to these fierce
warriors as well as their more obvious fierce side. She also realized
that the fierce side could destroy her without regret. As she
learned of their struggle she determined to help them. Unlike
the others in Erudin she knew that if the Orcs took hold of Antonica
it would only be a matter of time before their boots marched through
the marble halls or Erudin. She stood looking at the grim faces
around her both afraid and committed to helping them win their
freedom.</P>
