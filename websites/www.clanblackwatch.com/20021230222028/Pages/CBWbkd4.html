								<p><font color="#0000cc">As the battle raged it was clear that despite initial success the Northerners were being pushed back. Their fury couldn't overcome the sheer size of the Orcish Horde. Emperor Crush, seated on his great war mammoth, laughed as he watched the combined forces of his enemies fall before him. His divisions of Ogres and Trolls were wreaking havoc among the Gnome and Halfling forces. The Tier 'Dal used their arcane arts to send great green clouds of disease into the and raise the bodies of the fallen to fight the Northerners His spellcasters were greater in number and experience than the Erudites and the Northern Tier 'Dal. Soon these reckless warriors would be dead or under his rule again.</font></p>
								<p><font color="#0000cc">The leader of Clan Blackwatch with the Erudite girl, the shamans and a group of elite warriors tried to hold the wall of Orcs at bay. A spear point wounded the Erudite sending her to the ground. The leader and his guards bled from a hundred wounds. The shamans were spent and could heal no more. A great mass of Orcs charged the Northern Armies core. The leader prepared to swing his axe one last time against the darkness.</font></p>
								<p><font color="#0000cc">Suddenly the air was filled with arrows. Orcish bodies toppled by the hundreds. The Northerners turned to see wood elves by the hundreds gathered across the plains firing arrows. The Tier 'Dal found themselves hard pressed when blue lighting arced vaporizing them where they stood. High Elf wizards stood their elegant robes flowing in the wind. They had come to face their dark brothers to settle old scores from ages past. Half-Elven rangers rode in on fleet footed horses skewering horrified Orcs. The tide had turned this time in the favor of good.</font></p>

								<p><font color="#0000cc">The Northerners raged against the panicked Orcs. The horde was in a state of disarray Orcs, Goblins, Trolls and ogres ran every which way. The Tier 'Dal having met their match began to gate away from the field to avoid the wrath of their ancestral enemies.</font></p>
								<p><font color="#0000cc">The leader of Blackwatch pushed his small group forward until he reached the great mammoth that Emperor Crush rode upon. Here they met Crush's elite Imperial guards and the Orcish Shaman. With unmatched fury the northern shaman engaged the Orcs and the warriors took on the imperial guard. The leader rushed forward matching his might against the Emperor. Axe met Axe in a clash. The battle lasted minutes as the two swung and parried. The Emperor struck first cutting the arm of the leader and knocking the horned helm from his head. The leader slammed Crush with a rib-shattering kick. The mighty Orc stumbled back. The two faced one another wounded. The leader felt the bolt of lightning surge through his body. He fell to his knees. Glancing up he saw the shape of a Tier 'Dal wizard lighting stretching from his fingers tips. Crush approached the fallen warrior gloating. He raised his axe up preparing to strike the deathblow. The sound of rushing flame signaled the end of the lightning that coursed through the Leader's body. The leader came to his senses and heaved his axe upward. The blow was of such strength it split Crush from crotch to crown. The Leader stood and looked around to find the Tier 'Dal a blackened husk. Searching the battlefield he saw the Erudite Girl propped up on one arm.</font></p>
								<p><font color="#0000cc">For the first time since they had met she saw a smile cross his face. She stood to see the Orcs fleeing by the hundreds. Weapons were dropped carelessly as the Orcs retreated. The death of the Emperor was too much for them. Demoralized, their will broken they left the field leaving a field of weapons and bodies behind. The Northerners and their allies had won. Freedom was theirs.</font></p>

								<p><font color="#0000cc">After the battle had been cleared the Clans buried their dead and the dead of the other races that had fallen. The shamans and clerics present gave last rites Once the duties to the dead were fulfilled the celebration commenced. High Elf celebrated with Dwarf, Halfling with Gnome, Human with Half Elf, Erudite with barbarian. The newly united races rejoiced in their victory and the festivities lasted for an entire week.</font></p>
								<p><font color="#0000cc">In the months to come the Northern army grew in strength. The fortresses and temples of the Orcs were brought down. The Orcs met defeat time after time, though there were many close battles, hundreds of stories recant those tales. The city of Halas was built on the site of the camp of the first freed Barbarians. The exploits of Clan Blackwatch during these days were far ranging. The Warrior Leader, the Erud Girl, the Three Shaman, and the leader of the Gnomes were said to have traveled far in the battle to rid Norrath from the grip of Evil.</font></p>
