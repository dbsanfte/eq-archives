								<p><font color="#0000cc">Rejuvenated the Clansmen stood tall and were again prepared to enact a heavy price from the invaders. The mage summoned creatures of fire, earth, wind and water to her aid sending them into the dark army. Spiked vines grew from the ground entangling the enemy, draining the life out of them. Swords clashed and spells burned as the empowered Clansmen forced back the army one step at a time. Pushed them from their home, pushed them back into the black places from whence they came, back to the dark holes of their creation.</font></p>
								<p><font color="#0000cc">As the weary companions drove the invaders into the howling wind they heard a sound.</font></p>
								<p><font color="#0000cc">THUMP!</font></p>
								<p><font color="#0000cc">The ground quaked. The remainder of the horde parted. From their midst lumbered an immense figure coated in cruel barbed armor made of thick iron. Its blackened helm revealed it had no face.</font></p>
								<p><font color="#0000cc">An Imperator of Zek.</font></p>
								<p><font color="#0000cc">The God of War had allied with Terris-Thule against them. He had sent his champion.</font></p>
								<p><font color="#0000cc">The paladins charged.</font></p>
								<p><font color="#0000cc">With a sweep of his mighty sword he sent them flying back slamming against the wall of the great hall. The furious blasts of the mage and wizard bounced off like cheap gnomish fireworks. </font></p>
								<p><font color="#0000cc">A deep laugh echoed from within the black helm of the Imperator. Swinging his sword he sliced through the Clansmen forcing them into the great hall. One after the other they were battered and smashed. Their previous fight against the army had reduced their power to a fraction of what its normal greatness. </font></p>
								<p><font color="#0000cc">The mage and enchantress stood side by the, they were the last standing. The mage summoned a great shield but even it could not withstand the might of the Imperator. In one stroke it shattered the shield. Defenseless, all their magic spent, they waited.</font></p>
								<p><font color="#0000cc">The Imperator raised his thick, bloodied sword.</font></p>
								<p><font color="#0000cc">&#x201C;Hold!&#x201D; sounded an icy voice from the back of the great hall.</font></p>
								<p><font color="#0000cc">Frozen the Imperator of Zek searched for this new challenger.</font></p>
								<p><font color="#0000cc">A figure stood silhouetted in the back door, a solitary barbarian warrior, his muscled form radiating Northern fury. The unforgiving winds of Everfrost swirled around him howling like angry demons. The warrior hefted his great axe. Its rune encrusted blade told tales of slain dragons and had felled the most powerful beings the mortal world had to offer.</font></p>
								<p><font color="#0000cc">The Imperator readied his sword. His black helm focused on the warrior.</font></p>
								<p><font color="#0000cc">With a roar the warrior charged, with a single leap he landed on the top of the Clan feast table which stretched from one end of the long hall to the other. He rushed forward his axe raised. With a mighty jump he soared plunging his axe downward. </font></p>
								<p><font color="#0000cc">The Imperator raised its great sword. As the two blades met a thunderous noise erupted. An irresistible force met an immovable object. For a moment it seemed as if time froze the warrior and the giant Imperator of Zek locked in combat. </font></p>
