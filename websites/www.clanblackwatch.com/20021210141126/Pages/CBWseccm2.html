								<p><font color="#0000cc">&quot;So what are we waiting for?&#x201D; questioned the ranger with a nod. </font></p>
								<p><font color="#0000cc">Before they could turn to face the hobgoblins another voice came from the back of the hall.</font></p>
								<p><font color="#0000cc">&#x201C;You certainly can&#x2019;t get started without me.&#x201D; said a tall High-Elf stepping forward, his wizardly robes flowing around him.</font></p>
								<p><font color="#0000cc">&#x201C;Nor us.&#x201D; said a small army of Dwarves. One brandished a massive glowing sword taller than himself, another held out a strong mace forged deep in Kaladim and blessed with the power of Brell, while yet a third in dark armor gripped twin daggers. </font></p>
								<p><font color="#0000cc">&#x201C;I see there are souls in need of damning.&#x201D; echoed a dark figure forming from the very shadows his skeletal follower by his side.</font></p>
								<p><font color="#0000cc">&#x201C;And nobody is starting any trouble without me!&#x201D; said a tiny Gnome with a single wisp of hair perched on his head.</font></p>
								<p><font color="#0000cc">Even in these dark times, with an army stretched out before them, the group had a quick laugh.</font></p>
								<p><font color="#0000cc">They turned as one to face the horde before them. Defiant they stared into the merciless eyes. </font></p>
								<p><font color="#0000cc">And so the battle began. </font></p>
								<p><font color="#0000cc">Yelling in rage the hobgoblins surged forward. They were met with an icy blast from the wizard that crippled them in their very steps. The gnome danced wildly running madly in circles around them slinging spells this way and that. The ranger sliced into the hobgoblins meeting them blade to blade. Summoning up her strength the enchantress lashed out with hell bent fury wiping the hateful minds of dozens of hobgoblins sending them gibbering out into the snow. The great shaman swung his spear skewering inhuman beasts with one arm while sending a blizzard of artic death with his other. The dark one ripped the souls from the bodies of the horde feeding them to the blackened void. Not to be left out the Dwarves rampaged straight at the enemies pushing the massive army back.</font></p>
								<p><font color="#0000cc">And so the battle raged.</font></p>
								<p><font color="#0000cc">For hours the small band fought until they were drenched in sweat and near to collapse. Unmentionable terrors stood in piles around them but there were always more to replace the fallen. </font></p>
								<p><font color="#0000cc">This army could not be stopped. </font></p>
								<p><font color="#0000cc">The companions knew but fought on, refusing to fall out of sheer stubbornness. The group fell back exhausted, bleeding from dozens of wounds. The dark army closed for the kill. They could smell victory in their grasp.</font></p>
								<p><font color="#0000cc">An unearthly wave of fire blasted the encroaching terrors reducing their flesh to bones and their bones to dust which blew away on the cold winds of Everfrost. </font></p>
								<p><font color="#0000cc">The weary members of Blackwatch turned to see the Erudite mage wreathed in a halo of mighty light. </font></p>
								<p><font color="#0000cc">&#x201C;Sorry I&#x2019;m late.&#x201D; said the Erudite with a smile.</font></p>
								<p><font color="#0000cc">With her stood an army. A duo of noble Half-Elf paladins their armor gleaming in the light. A trio of druids one a white haired Wood-Elf woman her angelic features gleaming, another a human holding a gnarled staff, flanked by a half-elf holding a sparkling scimitar. Two High-Elf clerics, a noble blooded man and pure of heart woman, cast their healing magics closing the wounds and warming the spirits of the embattled members of Clan Blackwatch. Two Barbarian shamans, a husband and wife and a pair of Dark Elves, one in the embossed robes of a wizard, the other in clerical armor, and a battle worn human warrior rounded out the group.</font></p>
