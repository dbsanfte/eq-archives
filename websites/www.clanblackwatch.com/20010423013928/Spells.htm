<P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">An&nbsp;often misunderstood group
of Druid spells, often considered worthless.&nbsp; Most certainly
they are not worthless.&nbsp; Now the initial spell in this line
is not quite what I had hoped.&nbsp; You see, I tried to charm
a Griffin sometime around Level 5.&nbsp; I wasn't that amazed
that it didn't work, but I was amazed how fast Griffins can kill
you when you are level 5.&nbsp; Honestly I didn't use these spells
much until around my late teen levels.&nbsp; Recently I have been
playing some other druids lately (Abigaile of Brell, and Crescente
of Vallon, levels 6 &amp; 7), so I will let you know if I find
use for these spells at earlier levels.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Overrated.&nbsp; I don't think
I have ever casted this, and I am level 41.&nbsp; Maybe it becomes
more useful later.&nbsp; Some people swear by it, but as some
wise &amp; crazy wizard in our clan mentioned, when you need it
you're out of mana anyway.&nbsp; Sure you can save enough to cast
it, just hope something doesn't decide to hit you and interrupt
you at that last second.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">This spell will save your life.
Don't believe me? It has saved me several times. It casts VERY
fast, and is not resisted often. It is THE most reliable way to
get Grimfeather away from you long enough to snare him or zone.
He is faster than sow, so you won't make it by just running.&nbsp;&nbsp;
This of course depends on your level, so don't expect to scare
Grimfeather (level 37) when you are level 14 or something.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">It is of general use in <A HREF="Strategy.htm#Snare">snare/fear</A>

<P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">This is a great spell, and will
allow you to pull single monsters out of a camp. It is equally
useful grouping or soloing. It cannot be cast indoors. Its duration
is about 60 seconds. Range is good, though you cannot confirm
its effect except at close range. This does NOT mean it didn't
work, only that you don't know if it worked. At close range, you
will see some lights around the monsters on which it works. I
recommend casting it more than once if there is any doubt, or
you are not sure that all monsters were within the area of effect.
Of course, don't expect it to work on things many levels above
you. (i.e. don't use it to pull the goblin and not the wizard
when you are L6)</FONT></P>

<P><STRONG><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial"></FONT></STRONG><A NAME="Snare"></A><STRONG><FONT
 SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Snare</FONT></STRONG><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial"></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">A great spell, invaluable for
keeping yourself and party members alive. Even this level 1 version
can be cast on monsters several levels higher than you, but you
will get some resists. Duration is 60 seconds, but you will be
given a message when it wears off. If you are snaring DO NOT let
anyone root (this includes mage pets). Root will cancel snare,
so that when root breaks, the monster will be full speed (and
usually running right at you). Snare will not break from damage,
only duration. So pay attention and don't wait for the message
to tell you that you needed to cast it again 5 seconds ago. Don't
plan to use it much before about level 5. It is resisted a lot
and doesn't seem to last long. At 5 it becomes a great way to
stop fleeing monsters.</FONT></P>

<P><STRONG><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Ensnare</FONT></STRONG><FONT
 SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial"></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">The level 29 version of snare,
and a very misunderstood spell. There was a time when this spell
was worthless. Apparently its duration and effect, plus a possibly
increased chance of resist, made it not worthwhile to use. That
is no longer the case. This spell lasts a LONG time (close to
10 min around level 30, and I believe it increases, level-dependent).
Also, it has a greater slowing effect. The downside is it MAY
be resisted more, especially soon after acquiring it. Trust me,
when you decide to solo that first Hill Giant, you do NOT want
it returning to full speed every 60 seconds, and you will need
all of your mana + some more without worrying about re-snaring.
If you will be using this spell, again tell others not to root
AND rangers not to snare. Yours will not overwrite theirs. Have
them do backup snare in case you are getting resists.</FONT></P>

 SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial"></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Well of course you get Spirit
of Wolf at 14, and this is quite nice.&nbsp; Not only can you
travel more efficiently, but your life expectancy increases quite
a bit also.&nbsp; If you like, you can make money by taking donations
for casting this spell. Personally, I find that it is more fun
to just cast it when someone needs and you have mana, and make
your money adventuring instead.</FONT></P>

<P><STRONG><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Spirit of Cheetah</FONT></STRONG></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">At level 24, you get Spirit of
Cheetah.&nbsp; This was a better spell before it was nerfed (umm,
I mean fixed without telling anyone).&nbsp; Ok enough complaining.&nbsp;
It makes you VERY fast, but only for about 30 sec max (maybe 18
sec).&nbsp; It used to refresh when you zoned, making it great
for travel across small zones, but now it only refreshes every
15 min.&nbsp; It can be useful as an emergency escape for yourself
or a party member, but it is not used that often any more.</FONT></P>

<P><STRONG><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Scale of Wolf</FONT></STRONG><FONT
 SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial"></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">The level 29 travel upgrade.&nbsp;
Available in Kunark from Vie vendor.&nbsp; A nice spell, in the
right place.&nbsp; If you cast or attack, it will disappear.&nbsp;
Also, if you are attacked by a spell or ranged attack, it will
disappear (it no longer disappears from melee attack).&nbsp; It
can also only be cast on group members.&nbsp; It is nice for running
across relatively safe zones, but if you use it, ALWAYS have SoW
and snare (ensnare) memmed also.&nbsp; You will need these to
get away if something drops your Scale of Wolf.&nbsp; At levels
where you will be using this spell, standing and slowly melee-fighting
will not be practical.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">A great spell for use on non-animals.&nbsp;
Outdoors only short-term blind/stun spell.&nbsp; Fairly fast casting,
though seems slow intially.&nbsp; Do not cast when monster is
right next to you or you will blind yourself.</FONT></P>

 SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial"></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">This spell turns you into a wolf.&nbsp;
It is true that it is not usable in as many zones as before, but
it is still a nice spell.&nbsp; It lasts longer than SoW, and
gives you a nice attack buff.&nbsp; At 39, you get Greater Wolf
Form and Pack Form.&nbsp; Use Greater Wolf on yourself, then cast
Pack Form on any others that want it (you cannot cast Greater
Wolf on others yet).&nbsp; At 44, you get Form of the Great Wolf,
which gives you ultravision, like having a coldstone (I am looking
forward to this). Pack Wolf Forms are available to turn your group
into wolves of one grade lower than you can turn into yourself
(i.e. at 39 you can Greater Wolf yourself, but Wolf a group, etc).&nbsp;
Pack forms also have a shorter duration (around 1/2 I think).</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">DO NOT Wolf Form in Firiona Vie
(or probably any other city zone).&nbsp; There are many powerful
wandering creatures that will attack you.&nbsp; I have wolfed
safely in North Karana after the faction changes, and was not
regarded any differently.&nbsp; Gypsies do not mind you either.&nbsp;
Some guards may be less tolerant, so check from a difference (and
NOT while invis).&nbsp; In most zones, monsters will hate you
whether you are a wolf or not, so be one if you want.&nbsp; Unrest
is a wonderful exception, where wolves are treated as indifferent
always.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Treeform is a great spell, but
not used very often now that you cannot run around as a tree (there
used to be a bug that allowed you to move while in treeform, now
you can only rotate).&nbsp; This spell will give you indifferent
faction with many monsters, and provide you with some nice regeneration.&nbsp;
You cannot use it in areas where trees would not normally grow.&nbsp;
It stacks with your regular regeneration line.</FONT></P>
