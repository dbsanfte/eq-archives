<P>BLACK WATCH</P>

<P>Raised by Royal Warrant, the Black Watch was the first Highland<BR>
Regimentto be formed and, dating from 1739, is Scotland's senior<BR>
Highland Regiment. Established from independant companies, made
up from<BR>
clans reckoned to be loyal, they guarded the Highland areas from<BR>
raiders, maraders, and clan fueding. The Officers and soldiers
were the<BR>
only British subjects allowed to were the Highland garb between
1748 and<BR>
1757 without risk of transportation, after the Jacobite Rising
od 1745.<BR>
                           Based in Perth, the original 1,000
men<BR>
mustered in a field near Aberfeldy under command of John, 20th
Earl of<BR>
Crawford ( a lowlander to avoid showing favoritism amongst the
clans ).<BR>
The Black Watch, known initially as the 43rd Regiment, was to
become and<BR>
remain the 42nd Regiment. Over the centuries, it has a long and<BR>
distinguishing history in worldwide actions, with extensive battle<BR>
honours won on fields as far apart as the Americas, the Middle
and Far<BR>
East, as well as in the European Wars. The troops are renowned
for their<BR>
spirit, discipline and bearing.<BR>
                           The tartan adopted by the regiment
is a &quot;<BR>
hunting set &quot; based on the Royal tartan. Known in the 18th
century at<BR>
the &quot; Government Tartan &quot;, it was the natural set to
use for a Royal<BR>
Regiment, and subsequently also became known as the &quot; Universal
Tartan &quot;<BR>
. With coloured overstripes it became the basis of many clan and<BR>
regiment tartans. The pipers wear the bright red Royal Stewart
tartan.<BR>
Of all the Highland Regiments, the Black watch alone has the privilege<BR>
of wearing a red hackel, or plume, in its bonnets.</P>

<P>SGIAN DUBH</P>

<P>The Sgian Dubh is the small ornamental knife traditionally
worn in the top of the stocking by the Highlander. The flat edge
is normally worn in the right stocking by right handed people.
The name GAELIC- the word SGIAN means Knife or Dagger and Dubh
means Black, referring to the colour of the handle, which was
made from black hardwood. Various spellings of the word are recorded
in different books, including Skean, Skian and Skein. The word
Dubh can also be spelt DHU.</P>

<P>Originally the Highlander wore a dirk at hisside, and the Sgian
Dubh seems to only date back to the later part of the Eighteenth
Century. It may be associated with a small knife which the Highlander
carried under his armpit, concealed by his sleeve. This is referred
to in some of the histtory books as Skeen- ochles- possibly from
the word oxter- meaning armpit.</P>
