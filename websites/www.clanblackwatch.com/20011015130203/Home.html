July 7, 2001</FONT></B></CENTER></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#ff0000">After three previous battles and one
false start the mighty Faydedar finally fell. There was not one
death as a result of the battle. It was a perfectly executed dragonslaying.
The forces fo Praxium, Holy Fire, Servants of Mystery, Path of
Valor and Clan Blackwatch assembled on the beach. After a quick
and decisive fight Faydedar crashed to the ground dead and broken.
The victory was a triumph to teamwork and organization - yes it
does work and yes victory is a result. We fought, we lost, we
learned and the reward was victory.</FONT></P>
