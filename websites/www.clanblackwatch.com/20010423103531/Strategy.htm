<P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">I'm not going to say much about
this except that if you are still relying on this as your main
tactic after around level 18, then <STRONG>STOP IT!</STRONG>&nbsp;
I took a while to learn this, though Glenfinen tried to tell me
time and again.&nbsp; Sometimes it is a harsh lesson, but sooner
or later you will realize that you made a caster, not a warrior.&nbsp;
I think I was level 18 for about 3 months as I kept refusing to
accept this...</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Now this is not to say that you
can't step in and bash something.&nbsp; Just realize it is not
your primary means of dealing with an opponent.&nbsp; Sure you
can use your damage shield, just make sure you used DoT, snare,
and maybe a DD first.&nbsp; And if you are getting beaten (or
clawed, gouged, mauled, etc) to death, back off and cast a spell!&nbsp;
If you are in a group, don't stand there and melee, you can do
much better to heal, shield and snare (and sometimes other things
too).</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">This is where I sometimes think
that maybe I should have been a mage.&nbsp; For one thing, it
would be nice to have pets that don't try to eat you all the time.&nbsp;
Ah well, the life of druid is not bad at all, so I cannot complain.&nbsp;
I do not know many druids who use pets often, and in fact I also
used to consider druid pets to be of limited use.&nbsp; The problem
is the unpredictable nature of druid charm spells.&nbsp;&nbsp;Actually
this is needed in&nbsp;order to maintain balance, though a guaranteed&nbsp;five
minute charm would be quite nice indeed...&nbsp;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">What?&nbsp; Only&nbsp;five minutes?&nbsp;
You mean it does not usually last that long?&nbsp; And for the
high mana cost?&nbsp; That is correct.&nbsp; But, have you seen
the amount of damage a griffon can inflict in five minutes unopposed?&nbsp;
I know of no other pet of similar level that can come close to
this.&nbsp; And yes, sometimes it lasts longer, sometimes only
five seconds.&nbsp; Here are some strategies to maximize the effectiveness
of your pets.&nbsp; As I have only recently become proficient
at pet control, I am writing it from a late 30's to early 40's
level perspective.&nbsp; I believe these strategies would have
been quite effective in the late teen levels in east (or north)
karana also.</FONT></P>

<P><EM><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Pet Against Stationary Opponent(s)
(Griffoning*):</FONT></EM><STRONG><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">&nbsp;</FONT></STRONG><FONT
 SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">When you send your pet against a stationary
monster, it will begin attacking your pet.&nbsp; Often your pet
is the weaker side of the struggle, so you need to help it, but
you also need to protect yourself.&nbsp; In short, damage shield
your pet, then snare the monster (order can be reversed depending
on health of pet and relative danger of monster).&nbsp; If your
pet is almost dead, just snare the monster and prepare to get
away or switch to another strategy.&nbsp; You can find a new pet
if mana is available, <EM>after</EM><STRONG> </STRONG>the monster
is snared (Pet Kiting).&nbsp;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">If mana is low, forego the pet's
damage shield.&nbsp; If pet is doing well in the battle, sit and
med while it fights.&nbsp; You will receive message of when spells
wear off, so don't worry too much.&nbsp; At 35 and up this is
much better, as you can see what is going on.&nbsp; Do not worry
about damage shielding a powerful pet (like a griffon).&nbsp;
As long as you do not melee it, the damage shield will not hurt
you.&nbsp; It also has normal duration, and does not reset when
your charm breaks.&nbsp; Trust me, you will not have the luxury
of melee, you will need to fear and med in order to live (see
Snare/Fear section).</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">If your pet is fighting two or
more monsters, snare them ALL.&nbsp; Some may break off and attack
you.&nbsp; When and if your pet dies, they will all come after
you.&nbsp; If one breaks for you early, use your speed advantage
to keep them separated.&nbsp; Your pet will still be fighting
the other(s) so DON'T go near it, at least not for long.&nbsp;
The single monster will stay on you, and it is snared, so YOU
control where it goes.&nbsp; This will allow you to at least get
one (and usually two) monster kills, rather than the pitiful &quot;zoning
with no mana and getting no exp&quot; alternative.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">This technique is great against
the corrupt guards in WC, who just stand there at their post.&nbsp;
Also, you will look really neat sitting there with a griffin hovering
over your head.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">*Griffoning: The equivalent to
the RL hunting technique of Falconing, though using a Griffon
instead of the smaller RL bird.</FONT></P>

<P><EM><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Unsnared Pet Against Snared
Monster(s): </FONT></EM><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">This technique
also works against multiple opponents, but is most effective at
level 29 or later, though could work at lower levels.&nbsp; For
this to work, you need to make something MAD at you before your
pet attacks.&nbsp; In fact, it is great for hunting hill giants
in North Karana, though it useful in other places as well.&nbsp;
This is&nbsp;a very useful technique when your pet is much weaker
than the monster that your are fighting (ex: griffenne against
hill giant).&nbsp; One final point: it is often best NOT to have
a pet when you start this technique, but instead to pick one up
after the fight starts.&nbsp;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">To start, locate a suitable adversary
(don't get crazy, just find something that you might normally
hunt, but that would be very difficult).&nbsp; I will use the
Hill Giant as my example.&nbsp; Snare the HG, and throw your DoTs
at it.&nbsp; Do not nuke it more than about once (if even that).&nbsp;
Now it snared and you are SoW'd, so find an appropriate pet (use
tracking).&nbsp; Don't go too far away, because you need to keep
tabs on the HG, and you don't want others to think it is available.&nbsp;
If DoTs wear off, rethrow them.&nbsp; I will find a griffon if
possible, but settle for a griffenne (which can be a little easier
to control).&nbsp; Once you have your pet, track the HG again
and run back (do NOT snare your pet or this technique is worthless).&nbsp;
DoTs will wear off again, so rethrow, and have your pet attack
the snared HG.&nbsp; Basically this turns the griff into a HUGE
DoT, as the HG will be so mad at you that it will ignore the griff.&nbsp;
If the thing turns on your pet, either make it mad again (sit
or stand in front of it, be prepared to take some damage), or
let the pet fight it (switching to stationary pet technique).&nbsp;
This is not good for your pet's life expectancy, but will eliminate
the &quot;hmm now what do I do with this griff&quot; problem.&nbsp;
Personally I like to keep my pets if possible.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">You may be amazed how fast a griffon
can take out an HG, when the griffon is not being hit.</FONT></P>

<P><EM><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Snared Pet Against Snared
Monster: </FONT></EM><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">This is not
so much a technique, as a way to salvage an otherwise big waste
of mana.&nbsp; The problem is that most snared pets do not catch
most other snared monsters, meaning that if a monster is not stationary
(i.e. it's chasing you) then your pet won't do much good, and
will turn on you before it can do much for you.&nbsp; This situation
normally happens when you are low on mana (and snared your pet
in order to get away from it), making it doubly bad for you.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">My usual technique is to run through
the monster and pet, putting the pet between you and the monster.
This will allow your pet to get in a few attacks, even if it is
snared.&nbsp; It has some risk, as YOU can be the target of many
attacks if charm breaks while you are in the middle.&nbsp; Do
not attack while you are doing this, as you are trying to get
the monster to aggro on your pet, so you can use stationary technique.&nbsp;
Sit and med whenever you can, you will need the mana.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Sometimes you can stand there
and take some hits while your pet attacks.&nbsp; This may be impractical,
as some monsters can kill you before they will aggro on your pet.&nbsp;
Another option may be to use (yuck) root.&nbsp; It will break
way too often, but you may be able to stick the monster long enough
to make it mad at your pet.&nbsp; I haven't tried this, but&nbsp;it
might work (let me know if anyone tries it).&nbsp;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">If charm breaks in this situation,
just fear your pet and fight the monster.&nbsp; Keep doing this
(fear is very low mana cost) and basically just ignore your pet.&nbsp;
You may be able to fear and med when the battle is done, and pick
the pet back up.&nbsp; Sometimes it is better to just zone (if
you can).</FONT></P>

<P><EM><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Pet Against Animal: </FONT></EM><FONT
 SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">In some zones (ex: The Overthere) it is
easy to find animal targets for your pets.&nbsp; Now I am not
talking about nice little wolves, bears, or bunnies, I am talking
about rhinos and sabretooth tigers who would just as soon eat
a druid as they would anyone else.&nbsp; This can be very effective,
and allow you to take on multiple opponents at high levels (though
I have also died doing this at level 40).</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">With one opponent, this one is
simple.&nbsp; Just snare something (so it follows you slowly).&nbsp;
Find a pet if you don't already have one, fear the monster and
send your pet after it.&nbsp; Of course don't snare your pet (see
above).&nbsp; If charm breaks, fear your pet.&nbsp; It is best
if you can recharm your pet, though you will often have to snare
it to do so.&nbsp; Another strategy for re-charming is to run
way in front of your feared pet, then charm it at maximum range.&nbsp;
It will have passed you by the time the casting is complete, but
it is the only way I have found for re-charming without snaring.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">This can quickly turn into multiple
opponents, as the feared ex-pets can become difficult to find
again.&nbsp; Often I just charm a new pet at this point, and send
it at the original monster.&nbsp; When the old ex-pet comes back,
fear it and snare if you like.&nbsp; If the new pet behaves, you
can take out both opponents (monster and the ex-pet).</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">When this technique goes well,
you can relax a bit and med, forage, etc.&nbsp; Usually you will
need to because much of your time is chaos when hunting this way
(but you get lots of exp).</FONT></P>

<P><EM><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Pet Experience (<STRONG>Important)</STRONG>:
</FONT></EM><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Make sure that if your
pet does more than half of the damage to a monster, it is either
charmed or dead when the monster falls.&nbsp; If not (i.e. if
charm broke and it is out there running around) you will get NO
experience for killing the monster.&nbsp; This is most discouraging
when you have spent 10 minutes and nearly died multiple times
hunting a &quot;big one&quot;.</FONT></P>

<P><STRONG><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial"></FONT></STRONG><A NAME="Snare"></A><STRONG><FONT
 SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Snare/Fear</FONT></STRONG><FONT SIZE="-1"
 FACE="Arial"></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">The combination of snare and fear
is incredibly powerful.&nbsp; It can make impossible battles seem
almost easy.&nbsp; As a druid, you can only use your fear spells
on animals.&nbsp; However, you can easily group with someone else
who provides the fear component (Enchanters &amp; Necromancers
are good).&nbsp; For &quot;normal&quot; snare/fear hunting, just
make sure you use the snare first, or things can get out of hand
quickly.&nbsp; You can easily solo griffins (and griffons) with
this technique by mid 30's (near 40 you can start with almost
no mana and still make it).&nbsp;Just snare, fear and DoT.&nbsp;
You can practice your melee by beating on the beast, if you're
not so low on mana that you just need to med when possible.&nbsp;
Snare/fear is also useful to keep something off of you while you
regain mana.&nbsp;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Snare is also a valuable tactic
for splitting up two monsters.&nbsp; Just snare one, then run
far away.&nbsp; The non-snared one will stick fairly close to
you, while the other will drop back a ways.&nbsp; When you have
achieved the desired separation, snare the one close to you and
fight.&nbsp; Keep moving though, re-splitting them is a pain.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">I have used this technique to
solo Grimfeather at level 40.&nbsp; He has also killed me twice.&nbsp;
Be careful.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">This is really just a special
application of snare/fear, but it comes up a lot when fighting
with pets.&nbsp; It also helps when that annoying level 8 lion
is keeping your group from meditating.&nbsp; Just fear the thing,
it will run away for a long time (usually).&nbsp; Sometimes it
will just keep showing back up and you will have to kill it, but
it gets it away from you long enough to do something else.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">The same idea applies to multiple
animal opponents in zones like The Overthere or The Emerald Jungle.&nbsp;
Get the things away from you, then prepare to fight or zone.&nbsp;
Either way, it gives you that much needed time, even a few seconds
can make a big difference.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">This is also useful to keep something
off of you while you regain mana.&nbsp; Just make sure nearby
do-gooders know that you are not in need of help in killing the
thing.&nbsp; You may have to explain several times, but I have
never had anyone kill me &quot;pet&quot; this way.</FONT></P>

 SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Summoned Fighting</FONT></STRONG><FONT
 SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial"></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">This refers to fighting summoned
monsters, on which your &quot;Banish Summoned&quot; line of spells
will work.&nbsp; Personally I have never had great luck with this
(though I have been almost killed by Shadowed Men).&nbsp; For
a complete list of summoned monsters, click <A HREF="http://www.eqdruids.com/summoned.htm">here</A>

<P><STRONG><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial"></FONT></STRONG><A NAME="Kiting"></A><STRONG><FONT
 SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Kiting</FONT></STRONG><FONT SIZE="-1"
 FACE="Arial"></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Here I wanted to put down a few
thoughts about the much discussed topic of Kiting.&nbsp; It is
hard to even read a message board without seeing the term &quot;Kiting
Druid&quot; these days.&nbsp; But what is it, and why is it such
a big deal?&nbsp;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">In its purest and least accepted
form, &quot;kiting&quot; is the practice of targeting a monster
(usually one that is yellow or even 1-level red /con), casting
your damage over time and snare spells on it, then running away.&nbsp;
Repeat until you or the monster are dead.&nbsp; Personally, I
have never been able to solo a yellow /con monster, much less
a red one.&nbsp; It may be possible at some levels, with some
monsters, if you have LOTS of mana.&nbsp; It may have been more
possible back in the old days, before DoT damage was reduced by
1/3 when monsters are moving (the infamous &quot;kiting nerf&quot;,
which is still not mentioned in some circles).</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">It its more general term, kiting
seems nowadays to be interpreted as fighting without meleeing
(i.e. run and blast, run and dot, run and shoot with bow, run
and let pet hit, etc).&nbsp; Given this definition, you will be
kiting most of your life (almost always when solo, and many times
in small groups).&nbsp; Why?&nbsp; Well, to test this do the following:&nbsp;
cast your damage shield, then walk up to a nice Hill Giant or
Griffon (or Griffawn, Griffenne, Sarnak, Drolvorg, etc&nbsp;as
applicable), and start fighting it with your mighty 5/28 or 9/35
or whatever weapon.&nbsp; Make sure you have a good SoW, so you
can run away in 10 seconds when this doesn't work (if you are
unstunned long enough to run).</FONT></P>
