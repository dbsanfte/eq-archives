Welcomes Clan Blackwatch</FONT></B></CENTER></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#0000ff">Clan Blackwatch was formed on the Morgan
Le Fay server in the Midgard realm on the second day of public
release. We welcomed many old friends and some new ones into the
fold. I look forward to having many adventures with the Clan in
the lands of DAOC.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#0000ff">The current member list is as complete
as I currently have it. It is very likely there are mistakes in
both the races and classes and even a few members missing. If
you have corrections please send them to me and I will update
it shortly.</FONT></P>

Emblem Created</FONT></B></CENTER></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#0000ff">Many thanks to all who helped fund the
emblem creation. To my knowledge we were the third in the Midgard
realm to have an emblem. Special thanks goes to Rezkin, Grunk,
Krayvin and Arvoreen who contributed particularly vast amounts
of funds.</FONT></P>
