								<p><font color="#0000cc">Hello everyone and wlecome to the new site. This place is both intended as a resource for our active members in Everquest and for the Clan Blackwatch community as a whole.</font></p>
								<p><font color="#0000cc">Among the resources here you'll find new sections opening soon with ways to contact those tough to find older members. New games that current members are playing and links to some of the up and coming cool places where CBW members might end up hanging out. </font></p>
								<p><font color="#0000cc">We've been around for over four years now and I look forward to many more. The friends I've made over the course of Blackwatch's history are great people. For those that are new I hope you experience the good times that I have over the years.</font></p>
								<p><font color="#0000cc">The good thing about CBW, the thing that makes it lasting I think is that it was a guild formed by friends, not to get loot or kill dragons. It was made with the goal of furthering the enjoyment of its players by offering friendship and companionship, as a place for like minds to thrive. In my travels I've never seen another guild like it, we are by no means without our flaws...but there is something special at the core, something that cannot be duplicated.</font></p>
								<p><font color="#0000cc">There is something more lasting about it, I've seen it ressurect itself in a number of places; whether it be the current rebirth in EQ or the band of intrepid adventurers playing Shroudworld in NWN.</font></p>
								<p><font color="#0000cc">Our major accomplishment is the creation of a memorable place. Many previous and current members have fond memories and good times which are unique to the CBW community. </font></p>
								<p><font color="#0000cc">As we move into the future I can hardly think of an online game I've played where at least one or two CBW members weren't present. I feel fortunate to have the pleasure of the continued friendship of so many people.</font></p>
								<p><font color="#0000cc">So, have some grand adventures and tell some outlandish tales. For those in Everquest, Clan Blackwatch has returned I'll be thrilled to hear your many tales. For those wandering outside I encourage you to come to the message boards and rekindle your links to friends. For those journeying in other worlds let us know where you are and you might find a few old friends joining you. Wherever you are, most importantly...</font></p>
								<p><font color="#0000cc">Have Fun!</font></p>
