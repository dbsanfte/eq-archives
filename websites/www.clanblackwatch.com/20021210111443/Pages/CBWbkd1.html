								<p><font color="#0000cc">There was a time when the races of man were near extinction. Freeport was a small independent city threatened from all sides by the Orcish Horde. During this age the Orcs held the barbarian people in check. The Orcs had constructed massive cities and built towering temples in the name of Rallos Zek. The elder races had been forced back, the Dwarves hid in Kaladim while the Elves retreated to their cities using magic to obscure them from the Orcish armies. Emperor Crush I ruled over the continents of Antonica and Faydwer with an iron grip. His legions numbered in the hundreds of thousands and included the Trolls and Ogres. The world was on the verge of endless damnation.</font></p>

								<p><font color="#0000cc">Far north through High Hold Pass and beyond the twisty maze of BlackBurrow laid Everfrost and the frozen ground where Halas would one day stand. The inhabitants, a savage race, were under the yoke of the Orcish juggernaut. Snow Orcs had built their towering cities in Everfrost off the back of the Barbarians. For hours each day barbarians would break their backs not in battle but in hauling stone for use in the construction of blasphemous temples. It is said that at this time a small group of slaves escaped into the icy mountains. This small group would be the catalyst for a change that would rock all of Norrath.</font></p>
								<p><font color="#0000cc">The escaped slaves were a hardy sort; they were more than capable of surviving the frigid surroundings. They had one thought on their mind, freeing their brothers and sisters. In the weeks to come after their escape they built homes of rough wood. A great forge was constructed of stone and named &quot;Ur Fusha&quot;, First Forge. Ancient knowledge of metalsmithing was put to use creating the weapons of iron. The barbarians hunted bear and snow leopards using the skins to make armor and the meat to survive. After a year they were ready. It was time for the first assault. The forces were broken into clans. One of these clans was Clan Blackwatch.</font></p>
								<p><font color="#0000cc">It was a cool morning in the snowy canyons of Everfrost when the Clans tasted their first bite of vengeance. A squad of Orcish troopers was marching a group of slaves through the looming canyons. A roar echoed through the icy corridors. Bear-skinned Barbarian warriors jumped from the sides of the canyons. The Orcs were stunned as sharp swords and heavy axes hewed them from all sides. The slaves seeing these fearsome raiders used their chains to throttle their Orcish captors. Within seconds all the troopers were lying in the snow, green blood leaking out and raising steam where it ran.</font></p>
								<p><font color="#0000cc">The raids continued and many warriors were freed. The news slowly trickled back to Emperor Crush. Furious, he sent an entire division to Everfrost to put an end to the uprising. Due to the raids the barbarians had grown in number greatly. There were two thousand strong but were not ready to face a division of Crush's elite troops. The problem was, at this time, they were foolish enough to try.</font></p>
								<p><font color="#0000cc">In a whirl of steel a thousand screaming Clansmen and women met their deaths that day. The Orcs training, fine steel weapons and the magic of Tier 'Dal casters were impossible to overcome. Even though the battle was lost the event sent ripples out over Norrath. In a far away land others took notice.</font></p>
								<p><font color="#0000cc">On the continent of Odus lay the city of Erduin. They had removed themselves from Antonica to pursue their studies into the arts of magic. Most considered themselves above association with the other races. But there were some who did not agree with the isolationist attitudes of the Council of Erudin. One such individual was a young magician. She had read of Antonica and sought to study it more directly. When the news of the barbarian uprising reached Erudin she was determined to go and study these warriors. Packing a few books and scrolls, donning a pure blue robe, she slipped out of Erudin in the dead of night. Traveling in a small boat she sailed north landing on the shores of Antonica.</font></p>
								<p><font color="#0000cc">Using a map that dated back to the combine age she made her way into the mountains avoiding Orcish outposts and other dangers along the way. After weeks of travel she came to Everfrost. Shortly after her entrance into the snowy wastes barbarian scouts discovered her. As she trudged through the snow she looked up to find herself surrounded by gigantic warriors. She thought better of using her powers knowing there were too many and instead returned with them to their camp. The clans weren't sure what to do, she clearly wasn't an Orc but wasn't a barbarian either. The women laughed at her because she appeared frail and couldn't wield a sword, while the men were cautious of any being that wasn't a barbarian. It was determined that a gathering of the Clans was needed to determine the dusky skinned outlander's fate.</font></p>
								<p><font color="#0000cc">Five Clans sat at the gathering that day. They formed a circle surrounding the small Erudite mage. She shivered as the snow fell around her. She had been in the barbarians' camp for nearly an entire month and had learned much of their language. One thing she had discovered was that there was gentleness to these fierce warriors as well as their more obvious fierce side. She also realized that the fierce side could destroy her without regret. As she learned of their struggle she determined to help them. Unlike the others in Erudin she knew that if the Orcs took hold of Antonica it would only be a matter of time before their boots marched through the marble halls or Erudin. She stood looking at the grim faces around her both afraid and committed to helping them win their freedom.</font></p>
