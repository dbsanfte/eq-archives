  To set up a Clan sponsored camping event send a request to a

<P><FONT SIZE="+2">New Membership Policies</FONT></P>

<P>Clan Blackwatch has lifted the moratorium on guild recruiting,
but there are a few simple rules we'd like to have observed for
any future recruiting.</P>

<P>Also, from this point on, any player wishing to be in Clan
Blackwatch will require sponsorship into the guild.</P>

<P>Sponsored Applicants: Anyone who hunts with us on a regular
basis can speak to us in game and arrange a sponsorship.</P>

<P>Unsponsored Applicants: For those who want to join but Don't
have a sponsor (we have a few guidelines).&nbsp; Since most of
our guild members are level 20 or higher, we feel that new members
level 20 to 50 will receive regular exposure to other guild members.&nbsp;
Thus, we will likely invite characters of this level range unless
specific objections are raised by current members in Guild Chat,
by Email, or on the Message Boards.&nbsp; If you are a member
of allied or clan friendly guild you can&nbsp; use them as a reference.&nbsp;
If&nbsp; you want to join us regardless of your Level or Guild
status please Fill out our <A HREF="http://users.bignet.net/~clayton/EQmage/Memberapp.html">Membership
Form</A> and group with our members and we will talk to you about
joining.</P>

members into Clan Blackwatch:</P>

  <LI>You must get a portrait/screenshot of the new member.
