<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>In order to achieve a title in Clan Blackwatch you must participate
in a Quest which might involve retrieving items or facing a dangerous
opponent in combat. If an item is retrieved it must be brought
to a Clan officer or the Clan leader to gain the elevation in
title. If defeating an opponent is the objective then a screenshot
of your heroic battle or a Clan officer as witness to the event
is a requirement. Each title must be completed in succession,
no title can be skipped. Higher level members who have completed
quests before the title system was in place are awarded titles
based on their previous deeds.</P>

<P>In the future special distinctions and medals of honor will
be introduced to acknowledge certain special quests, actions above
and beyond the call and for those who have been proven to have
special knowledge (a Clan master jewelsmith would be a good example
of special knowledge)</P>

<P><B><FONT SIZE="+1">Clan Initiate</FONT></B></P>

<P>Every Clan member begins as a Clan initiate. The initiate title
is &quot;free&quot; and requires no special objectives. It represents
the basic Clan member.</P>

<P><B><FONT SIZE="+1">Clan Hunter</FONT></B></P>

<P>Clan Hunter is proof of a Clansman's ability to stand against
danger. To receive the title of Hunter one must defeat the Gnoll
Commander in Blackburrow.</P>

<P><B><FONT SIZE="+1">Clan Defender</FONT></B></P>

<P>A Clan Hunter must prove their expertise by retrieving Dvinn's
Heart from Crushbone. They must engage in combat with members
of like level , slay Dvinn and gain the heart.</P>

<P><B><FONT SIZE="+1">Clan Crusader</FONT></B></P>

<P>The Clan Crusader must brave the dangers of Castle Mistmoore
and return with the fabled Mistmoore Shield. The quest is not
for the faint of heart as all the cursed legions of Mistmoore
will be pitted against the strength of the would be defender.
Return with the shield and others will know of your courage.</P>

<P><B><FONT SIZE="+1">Clan Hero</FONT></B></P>

<P>Evil is always present in the lands of Norrath. In the bowels
of Cazic Thule lies the Avatar, a creature so foul that it must
hide for fear of detection by the forces of light. From below
the soil of Norrath it seeks to pervert all that is pure to decay
and filth. It requires a hero to defeat this incarnation of the
god Cazic Thule and banish it back to its domain. Defeat the Avatar
of Fear and the title of Clan Hero will be yours.</P>

<P><B><FONT SIZE="+1">Clan Veteran Hero</FONT></B></P>

<P>To be announced at a later date......</P>

<P><B><FONT SIZE="+1">Clan Legend</FONT></B></P>

<P>Only the most dedicated and heroic Clan members will be able
to achieve the title of Clan Legend. To become a legend one must
face the most fearsome terrors of Norrath. Victory over the dragons
Vox and Nagafen or the slaying of Cazic Thule or Innoruk qualify
a member for legend status. A Legend's tale of valor, strength
and perseverance against the forces of darkness will ring throughout
the history of Clan Blackwatch.</P>
