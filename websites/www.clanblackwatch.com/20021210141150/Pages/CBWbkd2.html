								<p><font color="#0000cc">The Clan leaders began to argue. Most felt that she should be killed outright while the remainder felt she should be sent away. One Clan did not feel either of these ways. The leader of Clan Blackwatch was a warrior, one of the few survivors of the battle against the Orcs. In the midst of all the bickering he stepped forward leaving his chair of logs and walked down to stand in front of the Erudite girl. He pulled back her hood roughly and looked into her eyes. What he saw there none can say but what happened after was well recorded. He turned and looked at his brothers and sisters and said &quot;Any who harm her answer to me. Any who send her away will face my steel.&quot; The other Clan leaders ceased arguing and silence fell. The lone warrior fixed each clan leader with a cold stare. Only one Clan leader was foolish enough to draw a sword and step forward. One swing and the would be contender found the leader of Clan Blackwatch's axe buried in his chest. Fresh blood dripping from his axe blade he stood looking for any others who disagreed. Grumbling the other Clans accepted Blackwatch's will.</font></p>
								<p><font color="#0000cc">In the time that followed the Erudite became fluent in barbarian. From this new knowledge she was able to translate words from ancient tomes she had brought with her. None before her had the knowledge to understand what the writing hid. It revealed an ancient series of caves located in Everfrost. The caves were said to be the home of the ancestors of the barbarians. No clansman of woman had ever heard of any caves before. The caves were said to hold the power of the gods. The barbarians believed fervently in the gods but had never been able to draw on their power. The map showed the location of these caves. A small scouting group left with the Erudite guiding them to the cave. After a few close encounters with Orcish patrols they reached the mountainous permafrost area.</font></p>

								<p><font color="#0000cc">&nbsp;</font></p>
								<p><font color="#0000cc">They found the location of the cave sealed with an ice wall. The barbarians chipped at the wall with little luck. It was frozen rock hard and their iron weapons broke against its surface. The Erudite girl moved them aside. She put down her pack and faced the wall. Closing her eyes she focused drawing in her power. A fiery stream shot from her hands blasting the ice wall. The barbarians jumped back. This was the first they had seen of her power. She had kept it hidden for fear of the possible reaction. The flame splashed against the ice. Beads of sweat on the girl's forehead as she intensified the flame. The brightness caused the warriors to hide their eyes. With a loud crack the ice was torn asunder. A large, dark hole lay in the whitish blue cliff side. The Erudite collapsed to the ground, her energy spent. Helping her to her feet the warriors of Clan Blackwatch entered the void.</font></p>
								<p><font color="#0000cc">Flickering torches illuminated the walls of the cave. The small group of warriors felt a trickle of fear, an unknown emotion amongst the barbarians, this made them uneasy. They were a people accustomed to the openness of the outdoors. Deep into the cave they found the first clues of what the tome had described. The walls were painted with the pictures of the beasts of the north, wolves, bears, cats and others looked out from the stone. Below each was ancient writing. It was in similar to the tongue of the Clans but not similar enough to make any sense. The Erudite scribed down the writing in her journal. As she was writing three of the warriors approached the wall, two men and one woman.</font></p>
								<p><font color="#0000cc">Each began to mumble. The mumbling increased to a wild shout. The other warriors jumped back raising their steel. The Erudite dropped her journal and retreated back to where the other warriors stood. The shouting from the three near the wall increased and they began to take on a slight glow. The light emanating from them rose to a blinding glare. Within the shouts the sounds of animal could be made out. The roar of the bear, the howl of the wolf and the growl of the snow leopard. A sudden burst of light precluded an absolute darkness. The warriors and the Erudite looked to see glowing eyes in the darkness. A small light grew from near the eyes lighting the cave. The three warriors had cast away their weapons. They spoke to their brothers and sisters calming them. Thus the first shamans to walk Everfrost in millennia were born.</font></p>
								<p><font color="#0000cc">The shaman found others who were deemed ready and taught them. From the cave they translated the power that would allow them to harness the very forces that had created the world. Theirs was the power over nature and her creatures. With this discovery came equally ominous tidings. Emperor Crush himself was coming to Everfrost. With him he as bringing the Orcish Horde, an army of a size that none could stand against. While they rejoiced the Clans couldn't help but ponder the encroaching doom.</font></p>
