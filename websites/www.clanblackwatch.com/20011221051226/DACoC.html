<P>The code of Blackwatch is a set of rules set to strengthen
the bond between members of Clan Blackwatch. It also details how
new members are brought into the Clan. Most the items within rotate
around treating members and non-members with honor.</P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+2">New Membership Policies</FONT></P>

<P>Clan Blackwatch has lifted the moratorium on guild recruiting,
but there are a few simple rules we'd like to have observed for
any future recruiting.</P>

<P>Any player wishing to be in Clan Blackwatch will require sponsorship
into the guild.</P>

<P>Sponsored Applicants: Anyone who hunts with us on a regular
basis can speak to us in game and arrange a sponsorship.</P>

<P>Unsponsored Applicants: For those who want to join but Don't
have a sponsor (we have a few guidelines).&nbsp; Since most of
our guild members are level 20 or higher, we feel that new members
level 20 to 50 will receive regular exposure to other guild members.&nbsp;
Thus, we will likely invite characters of this level range unless
specific objections are raised by current members in Guild Chat,
by Email, or on the Message Boards.&nbsp; If you are a member
of allied or clan friendly guild you can&nbsp; use them as a reference.&nbsp;
If&nbsp; you want to join us regardless of your Level or Guild
status please Fill out our <A HREF="DAmemfor.html">Membership
Form</A> and group with our members and we will talk to you about
joining.</P>

<P>There are a few additional rules involved when inviting new
members into Clan Blackwatch:</P>

<OL>
  <LI>All new members must agree to the Code of Blackwatch.
  <LI>You must get an email address from the new member.
  <LI>You must fill out our <A HREF="DAmemfor.html">Membership
  Form</A>
  <LI>Any player not providing this Information will not be invited
</OL>

<P>Any member breaking the Code of Blackwatch will be disciplined
or removed from Clan Blackwatch</P>

<P>Following these rules is a requirement of being an Officer.
Any officer who repeatedly invites members without getting this
information will lose their Officer status.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;**The rules and regulations of the Clan can be
modified without notice or notification.**
