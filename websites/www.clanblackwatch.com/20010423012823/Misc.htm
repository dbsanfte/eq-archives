<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>Here is some miscellaneous &amp; personal opinion 
stuff that I just wanted to write down.&nbsp; </FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2><STRONG>Finding Directions</STRONG></FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>Many people think that we druids always know our 
way.&nbsp; Now, as someone who has travelled most of Norrath, and has almost 200 
skill in sense heading, I can tell you that is not the case.&nbsp; As someone 
recently mentioned, possibly I can get a gps soon, because I still can't tell 
east from west, or find my way directly from the Misty Thicket druid circle to 
Rivervale...</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2><STRONG>Buffing &amp; Teleporting</STRONG></FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>As a druid, you will often be asked for buffs 
(especially SoW) and teleports.&nbsp; How you choose to react is up to you, but 
as usual, I would recommend being nice.&nbsp; It is easy to forget how difficult 
it can be to get around Norrath.&nbsp; In fact some druids remember this well, 
and make a decent living teleporting for money.&nbsp; I guess I am not a great 
salesperson, because I usually don't make much, but often just "throw around" 
some buffs and&nbsp;teleports here and there.&nbsp; Some people can be quite 
obnoxious, but most are nice.&nbsp; Just ignore the annoying ones.</P></FONT>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>My usual policy is to take money for teleports when 
it is inconvenient (going somewhere I don't really want to go, and I was doing 
something else, and I have decided to actually port somewhere).&nbsp; Often I 
port for free, just depends.&nbsp; These days there are lots of high level 
players around, so the obnoxious spamming types usually find their ports pretty 
fast from someone wanting money.&nbsp; A suggestion: if you have been hunting in 
a good group, and the group is breaking up, take your group members where they 
need to go.&nbsp; This is usually much appreciated and really not much 
inconvenience for you, especially if you are logging soon anyway.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>As for buffs, if you have some extra mana, SoW the 
people nearby.&nbsp; If someone sits down next to you mostly dead, cast regen on 
them if you can.&nbsp; If somebody is running from a terrible monster and seems 
to be in trouble, snare (or fear) it for them.&nbsp; Obviously, there are some 
limits to this.&nbsp; Don't try to snare a griffon if you are level 10 or 
something.&nbsp; </FONT></P>
