								<p><font color="#0000cc">BLACK WATCH</font></p>
								<p><font color="#0000cc">Raised by Royal Warrant, the Black Watch was the first Highland Regimentto be formed and, dating from 1739, is Scotland's senior Highland Regiment. Established from independant companies, made up from clans reckoned to be loyal, they guarded the Highland areas from raiders, maraders, and clan fueding. The Officers and soldiers were the only British subjects allowed to wear the Highland garb between 1748 and 1757 without risk of transportation, after the Jacobite Rising of 1745. Based in Perth, the original 1,000 men mustered in a field near Aberfeldy under command of John, 20th Earl of Crawford ( a lowlander to avoid showing favoritism amongst the clans ).</font></p>
								<p><font color="#0000cc">The Black Watch, known initially as the 43rd Regiment, was to become and remain the 42nd Regiment. Over the centuries, it has a long and distinguishing history in worldwide actions, with extensive battle honours won on fields as far apart as the Americas, the Middle and Far East, as well as in the European Wars. The troops are renowned for their spirit, discipline and bearing.</font></p>
								<p><font color="#0000cc">The tartan adopted by the regiment is a &quot;hunting set &quot; based on the Royal tartan. Known in the 18th century as the &quot; Government Tartan &quot;, it was the natural set to use for a Royal Regiment, and subsequently also became known as the &quot; Universal Tartan &quot;. With coloured overstripes it became the basis of many clan and regiment tartans. The pipers wear the bright red Royal Stewart tartan. Of all the Highland Regiments, the Black watch alone has the privilege of wearing a red hackel, or plume, in its bonnets.</font></p>

								<p><font color="#0000cc">SGIAN DUBH</font></p>
								<p><font color="#0000cc">The Sgian Dubh is the small ornamental knife traditionally worn in the top of the stocking by the Highlander. The flat edge is normally worn in the right stocking by right handed people. The name GAELIC- the word SGIAN means Knife or Dagger and Dubh means Black, referring to the colour of the handle, which was made from black hardwood. Various spellings of the word are recorded in different books, including Skean, Skian and Skein. The word Dubh can also be spelt DHU.</font></p>
								<p><font color="#0000cc">Originally the Highlander wore a dirk at hisside, and the Sgian Dubh seems to only date back to the later part of the Eighteenth Century. It may be associated with a small knife which the Highlander carried under his armpit, concealed by his sleeve. This is referred to in some of the histtory books as Skeen- ochles- possibly from the word oxter- meaning armpit.</font></p>
