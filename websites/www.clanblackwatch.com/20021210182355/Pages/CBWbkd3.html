								<p><font color="#0000cc">The leader of Blackwatch turned to the Erudite for help. Her bond with the Northerners had grown. What she had first come to study she was now a part of. She told them to help she must return to Erudin. There she could try to find allies if they would listen to her. She left the Clans to return to her people. The Clans prepared for the coming battle alone. The return of the shaman helped keep the northern spirits strong.</font></p>
								<p><font color="#0000cc">The day for the battle grew near. In lees than two weeks the Orcish horde would be upon them. There had been no word from the Erudite. The leader of Blackwatch paced the camp, troubled. If they did not get help they were dead. There was no place to fall back to and though death in battle was a reward to a Clansman defeat of his people was not. There was nothing to do but wait.</font></p>
								<p><font color="#0000cc">A commotion in the depth of night near the camp border wakened the leader. With the three shamans at his side he went to the edge of the camp. A group of warriors stood, weapons drawn pointing towards a group of trees. Storming into the discussion the leader demanded to know what was causing the uproar. The warrior told him he had seen a tree move. The others said he had drunken too much mead and imagined it. The leader hefted his axe and advanced on the trees. He was surprised to see them advance towards him. The other warriors stopped their bickering and formed up behind the leader. A simple phrase brought confusion to the barbarians. A large tree in front said, &quot;We come in peace.&quot;</font></p>
								<p><font color="#0000cc">The leader watched as the trees disappeared replaced by diminutive white haired people. And there was a huge mass of them. Many were giggling and pushing each other around. Trees, rocks even animal transformed into hundreds of smiling, big nosed, robed people. The first tree, now person, introduced himself as the leader of a contingent of Gnomes. They had gotten a message from the faraway city of Ak'Anon and had come to help in the fight. With them they brought numerous mechanical devices, some that worked, others that did not. The Clansmen welcomed their unusual allies. The Gnomes had also come with magical jewelry; rings and necklaces that increased the abilities of both the warriors and the shaman.</font></p>
								<p><font color="#0000cc">The arrival of the Gnomes was only the first of many interesting visitors. The days that followed were filled with new guests. An army of Dwarves arrived brining magical weapons and steel armor forged in the bowels of Kaladim. From Freeport cam a division of paladins, astride powerful chargers, who had heard of the oncoming conflict. A brotherhood of monks had sent their most skilled strategists to aid the Northerners. Furry-footed Halflings came from Rivervale bringing their knowledge of stealth and the druidic arts. Despite all these new arrivals there was no sign of the Erudite girl.</font></p>

								<p><font color="#0000cc">The night before the battle Clan Blackwatch gathered with the others to review the final strategy. A warrior burst into the tent hardly able to speak coherently. The Erudite had returned and she had brought something with her. The leader walked into the crowd of warriors. In the center of a rough circle was the Erudite, with her were a dozen robed figures, she was flanked by a few blue skinned Tier 'Dal. Hostility was brimming in the eyes of the other races. They glared at the Tier 'Dal hardly able to stop from killing them on the spot. The leader approached the Erudite and listened to her explanation. She informed him that those in the robes were fellow mages and wizards from Erudin while the Tier 'Dal were not from Neriak but instead from an isolated town. They, unlike their brothers did not follow the dark ways of Innoruuk. The leader was the first to grasp the hand of the Tier ' Dal commander in friendship. The leader stayed up late into the night with the Erudite girl revealing the battle plan. They had a large army but the head of Clan Blackwatch knew the battle would not be an easy one.</font></p>

								<p><font color="#0000cc">The following morning the assembled Northern army crested the hill to the plains of Everfrost. They were thousands strong, a rag-tag legion. What greeted them was staggering. Orcs as far as the eye could see. They carpeted the snow, a moving sea of green and purple blacking the white ground. Orges and trolls bellowed their tall forms sticking out from the mass of the Horde. Goblins made up the front ranks scurrying about. Tier 'Dal dark mages and priests were guarded by a mass of shaodowknights who rode black beasts. Blaring trumpets and pounding drums matched the steady stride of the oncoming Orcs. The banners of the Empire of King Crush fluttered in the wind. The Northerners were outmatched at least five to one. Hope seemed a distant island, uncharted, impossible to reach. Raising his sword high the leader of Clan Blackwatch signaled the charge.</font></p>
								<p><font color="#0000cc">The Northern legions surged forward. The ring of steel was deafening as the two forces met. The warriors sliced into the front ranks of the goblins decimating them in minutes. Great claymores cut Orcs in half while shaman increased the fury of the berserk barbarians. The Erudite spellcasters sent hurling balls of fire that rained down into the Orcish Horde. Dwarves jumped in and fought with so much fury that they drove back their old enemies the ogres and trolls. Siege engines built by the Gnomes brought ruin among the enemy ranks. The Gnome enchanters used illusions to frighten and confuse the enemy. The Northern Tier 'Dal helped counter the dark magics of their brothers. Charging forward the gleaming paladins met the shadowknights in a clash of arms. Swinging blades felled both man and Orc.</font></p>
