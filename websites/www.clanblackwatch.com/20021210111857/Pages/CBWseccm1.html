								<p><font color="#0000cc">BOOM! </font></p>
								<p><font color="#0000cc">The massive wooden doors of the great hall shuddered. </font></p>
								<p><font color="#0000cc">BOOM!</font></p>
								<p><font color="#0000cc">Snow fell from the ceiling sprinkling down into her hair. Tracing a symbol with her hands she used all her ability to fuse a seal for the door. A glowing symbol formed in the air, bits of energy snapping and crackling off it. With a slight forward motion of her hand she pushed it towards the door.</font></p>
								<p><font color="#0000cc">BOOM!</font></p>
								<p><font color="#0000cc">The entire hall groaned under the impact. As the radiant symbol touched the doors it bled into the heavy wooden beams. Exhausted the enchantress slipped to one knee. It would buy them a little time...but not much.</font></p>
								<p><font color="#0000cc">A hand on her shoulder caused her to look up. Standing next to her was a bearded shaman. Her husband. They were still together having weathered so many battles and fought endless wars. It was time to face this final challenge and they would do so together, determined.</font></p>
								<p><font color="#0000cc">The enchantress waited so many long years hoping the others would return. Now it was too late. Never before had an enemy set foot in the great hall of Clan Blackwatch. Never before had they been in such danger. Never before had they been so alone. </font></p>
								<p><font color="#0000cc">BOOM!</font></p>
								<p><font color="#0000cc">It was not mortal armies or brimstone breathed dragons which sought to destroy them - these were the armies of wrathful gods. She watched as her carefully constructed magic unweaved in front of her. The doors would not hold much longer. Determined she rose to her feet, preparing to fight one final battle. Next to her the shaman grasped his razor sharp war spear leveling its head at the door.</font></p>
								<p><font color="#0000cc">CRASH!</font></p>
								<p><font color="#0000cc">Splinters of wood flew apart cutting into the enchantress and shaman lacing their skin with a thousand tiny cuts. From the broken hole entered frenzied hobgoblins, the ghastly troops of Terris-Thule. Their curved blades glinted in the firelight. The enchantress could see they had not come alone. Behind the hobgoblins was an army of unspeakable terrors.</font></p>
								<p><font color="#0000cc">The foul creatures snarled, enjoying the moment. Now they would have vengeance. </font></p>
								<p><font color="#0000cc">The enchantress knew they could not withstand such an army. However, they would not fall easily. A great warcry erupted from the shaman and the enchantress yelled daring the invaders to attack.</font></p>
								<p><font color="#0000cc">The lead hobgoblin lunged. The shaman set his spear preparing to impale it.</font></p>
								<p><font color="#0000cc">In mid air a single arrow struck the hobgoblin sending it crashing to the ground.</font></p>
								<p><font color="#0000cc">Stunned the hobgoblins paused, growling.</font></p>
								<p><font color="#0000cc">Turning the enchantress saw a figure step from the shadows. A ranger, an old friend. Dropping her bow the ranger drew two swords lightning crackled along their blades. She looked at the enchantress and the shaman. </font></p>
