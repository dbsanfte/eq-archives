							<td width="610" height="1579" colspan="4" align="left" xpos="16" content valign="top" csheight="1564"><font color="#0000cc">A split second later the Imperator staggered back, the impact of the strike too much for it to take. The warrior landed on his feet shouting a terrifying warcry. He pressed the attack raining a dozen powerful blows down on the Imperator. Flecks of the great armor chipped off after each hit, the chunks dropping heavily to the ground.</font>
								<p><font color="#0000cc">The Imperator was not to be beaten so easily. Raising his sword he struck back. The two blades clanged off each other as the god champion and the warrior engaged in a frenzied round of blows. The warrior struggled to keep on his feet each swing rocking him back and forth.</font></p>
								<p><font color="#0000cc">It was on the mightiest of swings that it happened. </font></p>
								<p><font color="#0000cc">The two blades met one final time. </font></p>
								<p><font color="#0000cc">Perhaps it was because of the great wear from so many previous battles. Perhaps it was Rallos Zek himself reaching out to punish those who sought to bring peace. </font></p>
								<p><font color="#0000cc">The axe shattered.</font></p>
								<p><font color="#0000cc">The great sword of the Imperator carried through burying itself deep into the body of the Northern warrior. A deep laugh resonated through the blackened helm as the Imperator lifted his foot and pushed the warrior off the blade sending him to the ground. </font></p>
								<p><font color="#0000cc">The warrior felt his lifeblood flowing away. Through blurry eyes he saw his companions lying around him, broken, near death. Coughing up blood he tried to rise but his strength failed him and his muscles would not obey. </font></p>
								<p><font color="#0000cc">The Imperator reveled in his victory. </font></p>
								<p><font color="#0000cc">As the Champion of Zek towered over the fallen warrior the cleric of Brell reached out his hand and touched the warrior, using his last bit of power he sent his healing force into the warrior. So it was that the two High-Elf clerics spent the last of their energy and even the noble paladin gave a gift of strength and healing that only the noblest of knights could summon. </font></p>
								<p><font color="#0000cc">In that instant the warrior felt all his strength return. His limbs filled with might. </font></p>
								<p><font color="#0000cc">The enchantress and the nimble Gnome had a few tricks of their own left. Each sent out a spiral of energy directly at the opening in the blackened helm of the Imperator. The huge iron figure stumbled, unable to see. </font></p>
								<p><font color="#0000cc">A dual blast of fire and ice struck the sword arm of the Imperator and the iron hand lost its grasp. </font></p>
								<p><font color="#0000cc">The great blade fell, rushing towards the ground. Mid flight the hands of the warrior intercepted it as he rose. One precisely timed swing, with all the strength of his Northern ancestors, struck the head of the Imperator of Zek. </font></p>
								<p><font color="#0000cc">The iron figure staggered backwards. It hovered wobbly on its feet. The blackened helm slid off, sundered by the mighty swing of the warrior. It clanked as it hit the ground, bouncing and finally rolling to land at the feet of the dark army.</font></p>
								<p><font color="#0000cc">Raising the Imperator&#x2019;s Sword the warrior faced the army of the gods. </font></p>
								<p><font color="#0000cc">Their champion defeated the army fled, running back into the night their wails lamenting their failure and the punishment which they would receive from the gods they cowered before. In moments the field of battle cleared. The efforts of all had preserved the great hall of Clan Blackwatch.</font></p>
								<p><font color="#0000cc">All around the companions rose. Cleaning their wounds and helping their friends regain their feet the haggard members of Clan Blackwatch congratulated each other on a battle well fought. As they greeted each other and shared many stories. As they recanted their tales to one another the warrior stood speechless.</font></p>
								<p><font color="#0000cc">In time the reunion quieted and conversations came to an end. The assembled companions looked to the warrior.</font></p>
								<p><font color="#0000cc">It was the enchantress who approached.</font></p>
								<p><font color="#0000cc">&#x201C;What now?&#x201D;</font></p>
								<p><font color="#0000cc">The warrior stood and looked over the faces of the assembled companions, each a true friend, each ready to sacrifice all for one another.</font></p>
								<p><font color="#0000cc">&#x201C;So the gods have come calling. It seems we still have enemies left. It seems our work is not done.&#x201D; said the warrior raising the great blade of Zek before him.</font></p>
								<p><font color="#0000cc">&#x201C;The forces of light are needed once again. Sharpen your swords, ready your bows, focus your magics. It&#x2019;s time to return the favor. If the gods want a fight, then by the thunder and fury of the North we will give them one.&#x201D;</font></p>
								<p><font color="#0000cc">And with that the warrior turned and walked through the broken doors of the great hall and into the cold plains of Everfrost. Behind him the companions followed one by one heading off to a battle none were certain they could win.</font></p>
								<p><font color="#0000cc">And so did the companions of Clan Blackwatch ascend to the heavens. And so did they fight in many epic battles that would change the face of Norrath forever.</font></p>
								<p></p>
								<p><font color="#0000cc">But those are other tales&#x2026;</font></p>
								<p><font color="#0000cc">As Recorded and Catalogued by the Librarian of Erudin</font></p>
