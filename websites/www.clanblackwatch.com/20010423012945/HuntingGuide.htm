to hunt and some strategies to use.&nbsp; I am planning to provide
a table to summarize the information, but I have not had time
yet.&nbsp; The picture is of sunrise in the Frontier Mountains,

<P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Before I forget, here is my disclaimer:
<EM>EverQuest, much like real life, can be enjoyed in many different
ways.&nbsp; I do not &quot;play it safe&quot;, nor have I any
desire to do so.&nbsp; Some of my strategies and suggestions significant
risk, but with the greater risk comes greater reward.&nbsp; Also,
I think it is more fun :)</EM></FONT></P>

<P><STRONG><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Starting Out (1-4)</FONT></STRONG></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">I don't want to say too much here,
as there are many &quot;starting out&quot; guides already available.
I will try to point out a few things that I have found useful,
and maybe provide a few suggestions different from the usual.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">You will enter the world with
very little. Regardless of where you start, there are a couple
of things that you need to do (after memorizing your initial spells
and finding your guild, of course). Get your Burst of Flame and
Flamelick spells as soon as you can. Flamelick requires a fire
beetle eye, so if there are no fire beetles&nbsp;in your zone,
see if anyone has an extra one. Snare will become a very useful
spell, but don't worry about it right now. After a level or maybe
two, it can be helpful to leave your starting zone, but don't
go too far.&nbsp; Many starting or near-starting zones will provide
you with some minimal armor (courtesy of orcs, goblins, gnolls,
etc).&nbsp; Not only will you increase your faction, but even
this&nbsp;cloth armor is much better than none.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">If you are a halfling, have no
worries. You start in a great place. Misty Thicket is not only
well guarded, but provides excellent hunting up to at least level
9 or 10. Stay right where you are, and enjoy your nice home. Just
don't go past the wall until you are around level 5.&nbsp;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">If you are in Faydark, I recommend
leaving for the Butcherblock Mountains as soon as you can (level
2). Many people wait a bit, but there are some reasons not to
do this. First, I have found the Greater Faydark is one of the
only places where people will frequently steal your level one
monsters. I find this annoying. Butcherblock provides a wondrous
and unpopular creature for you to hunt -- the large skunk. Now
you will not smell very pretty after fighting these creatures,
but neither will you be level 2 for very long. Also, they occasionally
drop scent glands, which are worth a few gold.&nbsp; As you progress,
you can hunt large spiders, large snakes, dwarf skeletons, goblins
(5-10), giant bats. Just stay away from those basilisks. They
will not hurt you unless you mess with them, in which case they
will kill you.</FONT></P>

<UL>
  <LI><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Don't forget to train channeling
  at Level 4</FONT>
</UL>

<P><STRONG><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Next Steps (5-8)</FONT></STRONG></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Now you get some new spells, but
probably you don't want to wander too far just yet. It's still
a long run back with no SoW if you die (which seemed to happen
to me&nbsp;frequently). Keep your burst of fire and your new burst
of flame both memmed. You can be interrupted very easily, so sometimes
you will need the faster casting of the level 1 spell. You get
a root spell, but it will usually be resisted, so use snare instead.
Keep using your flame lick. The AC debuff helps your fairly weak
combat skills a bit.&nbsp; Try your wind spell when you have extra
mana.&nbsp; It will do more damage than anything you have, but
it is expensive and will be resisted a lot.&nbsp; You can gate
home, but you can't cast it fast enough for use as an escape yet.
Don't forget the wondrous harmony.</FONT></P>

<UL>
  <LI><DIV><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">If you don't have the ability,
  you can learn to forage at level 5.</FONT></DIV>
  <LI><DIV><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">You get meditate at level
  8.&nbsp; This makes your life much better.&nbsp; Don't forget
  to go train it.</FONT></DIV>
</UL>

<P><STRONG><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Thorns &amp; Being a Tree
(9-13)</FONT></STRONG></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">At level 9, some wondrous things
happen to you.&nbsp; First, you get a damage shield.&nbsp; This
easily underestimated spell is a HUGE increase in your offensive
power.&nbsp; Now at first it is a bit expensive and won't last
long, but do not be without it when soloing.&nbsp; If grouped,
do not let your main tank be without it.&nbsp; You also get a
new DD and a new heal, both huge improvements on your old ones.&nbsp;
Treeform is nice if you have the money. Water breathing is useful
later, but don't worry about it right now.&nbsp; These spells
get expensive, so you may have to pick and choose.&nbsp; Unless
you are human, don't worry about the light spell.</FONT></P>

<P><EM><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Solo Hunting Suggestions:</FONT></EM><FONT
 SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial"> Butcherblock (higher goblins, drakes,
basilisks (!)),&nbsp;Crushbone entrance area, EC (spiders, scarabs,
lions, orcs), WC (orcs, spiders, some undead), Befallen, Misty
(Giant Wasp, Scarab, Goblins), Runnyeye (stay near entrance),
NRo, Oasis, West Karana, Blackburrow (ick)</FONT></P>

<P><EM><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Group Hunting Suggestions:</FONT></EM><FONT
 SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Crushbone, WC Dervs, N Ro Dervs, some
Oasis Orcs (watch out for annoying &quot;helpful&quot; people
who tell you to go back to NRo)</FONT></P>

<P><STRONG><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Can I Get a SoW Please?
(14-18)</FONT></STRONG></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Well, now you can finally SoW.&nbsp;
Equally important, you can bind and avoid that eight zone run
to your corpse.&nbsp;&nbsp;Some of us still remember the joys
of running from freeport to North Karana all too well...&nbsp;
If you like, you can stand around shouting something like &quot;Sowing
for donations at &lt;wherever&gt;&quot;.&nbsp; Or you can be really
stingy and never cast SoW on anyone.&nbsp; Personally, I think
it is better to be nice, just don't let people take advantage
of you.&nbsp; That SoW that barely moves your mana bar at level
40 is pretty expensive at level 14.</FONT></P>

<P><EM><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Solo Hunting Suggestions:</FONT></EM><FONT
 SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">&nbsp;You will have mostly outgrown Misty,
though Mooto (goblin) and some scarabs will give some exp initially,

It? (19-23)</FONT></STRONG></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Now many people say that 14 is
the greatest level for druids (since you get SoW) but I think
I was happier at 19.&nbsp; Things not going your way in your zone?&nbsp;
Do what any good druid would do and teleport yourself somewhere
else.&nbsp; If you hunt near one of your porting zones, you can
use your bind point as a 5th location (you get four teleports
at 19).&nbsp; Want to be able to check out Unrest anytime?&nbsp;
Bind outside the door, then hunt in NK or WC whenever the mood
strikes you.&nbsp; You get some other very nice spells at 19,
be sure to check out the EQ Druids link at the beginning of this
section.</FONT></P>

<P><EM>Solo Hunting Suggestions: </EM>North Karana (Scythe Beetles),
East Karana, Oasis.&nbsp; Many possibilities.</P>

  <LI><DIV><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Tracking is a great skill,
  and will also save your life frequently (early warning system

<P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">These are nice levels for druids,
though I had some troubles at level 28.&nbsp; Expect to see some
more notes for these and later levels soon.</FONT></P>

<P><EM>Solo&nbsp;Hunting Suggestions: </EM>Go pay Broon back for
that time he smushed you.&nbsp; The gnoll clan in EK provides
some great exp too, though I cannot remember their exact level.&nbsp;
Use harmony, you do't want them all.&nbsp; SK is good if uncrowded.</P>

<P><EM>Group Hunting Suggestions: </EM>Unrest is great (Hand,
Night, Magi, even TR at 27 and up), SK, MM (near zone and watch
for trains).&nbsp; Some Kunark zones should be good (Lake of Ill
Omen).&nbsp; You can also function effectively as a healer in
higher level groups (Spectres, Sand Giants).</P>

<P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Well, I just managed to finally
achieve level 41 (June 14th, 2000).&nbsp; Hopefully I will continue
to make progress, and can come back with information on the higher
levels.&nbsp; Until then, maybe you can ask the Lady Deeyana for
suggestions, as she has much more experience than I.&nbsp; I do
know that you can expect some <STRONG>very</STRONG> nice spells
as you continue to develop your skills.</FONT></P>
