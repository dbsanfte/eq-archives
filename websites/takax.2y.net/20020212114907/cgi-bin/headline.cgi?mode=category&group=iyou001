It states that this only works with beneficial spells. In most cases it is clear cut what is a beneficial spell, and what is not, however, in the case of the necromancer, there is some ambiguity I think. So my question is, are the various tap spells that benefit the caster but harm the target considered beneficial or not? Also, are the new group taps considered beneficial? Are some considered beneficial and some not? If so, which ones? I think this question is quite pertinent for any necromancer to have answered, since the value of this ability greatly depends on what spells are considered beneficial.<br>Best,<br>Lambik<br><br>p.s.

Greetings, good people of Norrath!
<P>
I am very excited to announce AHAA (A Horse of Alv and Ally) and STABWOLF (Save the A Black Wolf of Lesser Faydark (even though there aren't any)) foundations' first ever, and only, festival!
<P>
Lead by Alrune Silvermyst and Alverina Dragonborn, plus a few others.
<P>
What: A festival "celebrating Valentine's Day."<br>
Where: Toxxulia Forest, right around the wiz spires (loc is: -1512, -885) on the Vazaelle server.<br>
Why: To take a break from hunting and have fun!<br>
When: Saturday, Feb. 16, 4PM Pacific time.
<P>
There will be a horserace, a footrace, a scavenger hunt, "Alrune Says", and a muffin-eating contest.  Prizes will be given out, and drinks and snacks will be sold very cheap!  There willbe an area designated for duels, so you can kill your friends and enemies, or just watch!
<P>
Everyone is welcome to come!  If you need a port to Tox, please gather at any wizard spires before it starts and wait for Vaellar.
<P>
The best part is that it's FREE!
<P>
Hope to see you all,
<P>

<li>Fires of Heaven, with 125 votes, got 28% of the vote to come out number one.

<li>Afterlife was close behind with 98 votes, giving them 23% and second place.

<li>Mystical Order came in third, with 68 or 15% of the votes.

<li>Relentless was fourth with 58 votes or 13% of the total vote count.</li><p>Every guild on the list got a vote, but the top four were clearly the most popular guilds.<p>What makes an uberguild?  Now that's a question only our readers can answer.  The bar raises all the time.  Taking down Lord Nagafen or Lady Vox was considered pretty tough in the old days, but now Veeshan's Peak is the place to be for those elite guild members to hunt, at least on my server.  Will taking down the Sleeper be the ultimate uber-test?</span><br><br>
