<p><font color="#FFFFFF" face="Arial"><b>The Planned Invasion of
Qeynos</b></font><br>
<font color="#C0C0C0" size="2" face="Arial">An article by Beeverz</font>
</p>

<p><font face="arial">It has come to my attention that the next
Event in the Straylight Saga will be an Invasion of Qeynos by
masses of Ogres, Trolls, and Darkelves.</font></p>

<p><font face="arial">No date has been set but I suspect in the
next 2-3 weeks. For those of you un-familliar with Straylight
Saga goto the Rallos Zek Chronicles - www.ralloszek.com I
beleive. Its a roleplaying board who also organizes rp events and
storylines. The first race war - was against Freeport whom many
of you have read EBP's retelling of that tale. Ofcourse the
wedding scandal, the slave auction, and other stories are part of
this grand plotline of the stray light saga.</font></p>

<p><font face="arial">The BushTamers will be actively involved in
the protection of our precious animal sactuary - particularly
Surefell Glade and Queynos Hills. Since KGB&quot;s timely arrival
- this is a perfect opportunity to show EQ what organized Good is
all about. Furthermore, to showcase KGB's goals and ideals of the
knight and the pursuit of truth and justice. This event will be
highly publicized.</font></p>

<p><font face="arial">I participated in the original racewar as a
DE and know a little of how it works. We will be given a
timeframe of roughly 3 hours of when they will arrive but
hostilities will occur all day up until the main event.</font></p>

<p><font face="arial">This is a unique opportunity for the
BushTamers as well as KGB to shape and play a major role in
Server wide events. For one thing - both of us have a large and
lengthy experince in tactics and battle. Another boon - problem -
is that there is no organized resistance on this side of the
continent. We seldom see evil races, and I fear that turnout may
be small and that we may face PKS who will side with the Dark
Forces against there own.</font></p>

begins to visualize the mission of KGB in Norrath</b></font><br>

Left: </font><font color="#FFFFFF" face="arial"><em>After gaining
initial experience in Qeynos and Qeynos Hills, GuildMaster
JetStar sets off to the Plains of Karana to hone his skills and
to discover the ways of Magic</em></font></p>

<p><font face="arial">It is rumored that parallel worlds of
Norrath exist. Our is called Rallos Zek. This world is very
different from the others. The gods do not allow battles among
the intelligent races unless one has declared himself ready to
take part is such conflicts. Here is Rallos Zek, you have no such
choice. For it is here that my men and I have been called to
inhabit. For it is here that murderers and evils run unchecked
across the land, killing the innocent and laughing at justice and
the laws of the light.</font></p>

<p><font face="arial">My first experience was disturbing to say
the least. When I arrived here on Rallos Zek I quickly realized
my new incarnation did not have the combat and magical skills I
had possessed in Sosaria. These skills would have to be
re-learned, and this is a lengthy process to say the least. I had
been given this knowledge from many of our former members that
have broken away from KGB to form The Elders and The Arcane Order
guides on other parallel incarnations of Norrath. Lord of the
Guild Ramirez (known as Lexus here on Rallos Zek) arrived a few
weeks before me and was more experienced. Together with former
KGB friend Existence by Proxy (known as Nietz here on Rallos Zek)
help me with advice as I quickly sharpened my skills. </font></p>

<p><font face="arial">I spent my first few days near the walls of
Qeynos hunting small animals and gnolls. I moved into the hills
of Qeynos and started to hunt animals, skinning them and selling
the skins for much needed gold and platinum. As my experience
grew I knew times would get more difficult. I could hear the
shouts of Murderers and their prey in echoing in the distance. I
knew it was just a matter of time before I would have to once
again face a murderer face to face. I also knew that unlike the
situation I was used to in Sosaria, I was not surrounded by
scores of talented KGB Knights. I thought of the members of KGB
that helped us to success in Sosaria. They had served their time
and now pursue their own futures and callings under different
disciplines. I had once again been called on a new mission, with
a handful of the most dedicated KGB Knights. This time I would
have to face the Murderers alone, and most likely would feel the
pain of death once again, with little chance of defending myself.</font></p>

<p><font face="arial">It amazes me to see that with a huge threat
of Dark Elves, Ogres, and Trolls, the forces of light still
manage to prey upon each other with unmatched greed and lack of
compassion and humility. It is a sickening sight to watch brother
kill brother for a gold coin or a sword of bronze. This would be
our first challenge.</font></p>

<p><font face="arial">After a night of adventuring with my new
found friends Weeda, Lewboski, Kalani, Sapling and Bemuse, I
decided to venture out on my own since most of the land had made
camp and gone to sleep. It was my intention to improve my skills
as much as I could that night. I hunted close to the Guard Tower
called T2 by hunters on the plains of Karana. I continued to pass
the only other hunter in the area. His name was Xrastlin. I just
finished fighting a Giant Beetle and used my new 2 handed bronze
sword to carve out the beetles eyes, which I found to be worth
something at the local hunting lodge (Fire beetle and Giant
Beetles eyes glow even after the death of the animal, and are
used by many hunters as replacements to lanterns). I was hurt
badly and was just sitting down to rest and heal. With dagger in
hand, Xrastlin approached me. I thought nothing of it, and many
of the hunters here heal each other when needed. I was stunned to
find out that instead of healing me, he thrust his dagger into my
already wounded chest. I quickly turned and began to run, still
in disbelief that this man could be so cruel. He cast a spell
that caused the land under my feet to break open, and large roots
grabbed my feet. I could no longer move. As Xrastlin began to
cast another spell, I pleaded with him for my life. Without
hesitation he finished his spell and I screamed in pain as I was
engulfed in flames. Xrastlin then took the bronze sword I had
spent days and days saving for. He quickly gated to Qeynos.</font></p>

<p align="center"><font face="arial"><img src="x1.jpg"
width="347" height="57"></font></p>

<p align="left"><font face="arial">Realizing Xrastlin was nothing
but a greedy murderer, I shouted as loud as I could to the other
people of Qeynos to watch out for him. He denied my claims
stating that he tried to heal me and that the well known murderer
duo Pheer and Faldor had killed me and he tried to heal. He then
sent me a message saying, &quot;Noone will even believe you, I am
a well known Anti&quot;. I continued my accusations and Xrastlin
became more and more upset. He then sent me this message:</font></p>

<p align="center"><font face="arial"><img src="x2.jpg"
width="469" height="64"><br>
</font><font color="#FFFFFF" face="arial"><em>Xrastlin tells you,
Hehehe im going to kill you again now. maybe until you lose
levels I haven't decided</em></font></p>

<p align="left"><font face="arial">I look forward to the day when
my men and I meet up with XRastlin again. This is the kind of
scum that I swear to clean up. My mission continues.......</font></p>

good recruitment opportunities, and the recruiting process will
begin some time this weekend. JetStar has plans to negotiate with
the TAO and The Elders splinters of the KGB. These two Guild
splinters have settled on the Mythaniel Marr server and some of
the members may want to seek duel membership in the KGB once
again to get involved in the original mission of the Guild. This
land is in dire need of an organization like KGB to place the
murderers in check. Unlike Sosaria, none of the politics or red
tape exist here. Murders are constantly reported and innocents
cry for help 24/7. Its time for us to get busy.</font></p>
