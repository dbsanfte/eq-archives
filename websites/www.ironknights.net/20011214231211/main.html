As of late, several members of IRN have expressed an intrest in <a href="http://www.dayofdefeatmod.com">Day of Defeat</a>, a mod for Half Life. It has been proposed by several members that there be a switch in the server recently purchased for Counter Strike. It has also been advised by certain other members that while DoD may be a good game, it is still in its beta form, 1.3 to be exact with 2.0 due soon, thus the conversion of said server would be unwise because changes to the game are inevidable and some changes may turn out poor. With such a difference in opinion, I am going to hold a meeting in our IRC, Friday the 31st at 10:00pm ET. Any who can attend please do, as such topics that I would like to covor would be server status, official division status, and recruitment status.

Atomic Freaks were a no show Sunday night. I have not submitted a dispute to OGL as of yet. One of their members has agreed to play the match tonight at 9 pm EST on our server. We will take whatever players we can get. But I'd like to keep Sundays original lineup. In other news Mystikal will be back on active CS duty tomorrow, he comes back from HK. Hopefully we will finally get our starting lineup. Also I will try to clean up the ironknights site a little, as Alvin has requested. Hopefully Ill be able to distinguish the difference to whats important and whats not..ehehhe. Thats it for now.

BL thank you and thank your sister for me.  This is exactly what I was envisioning.  The news has always been a problem area for us.  Either we didn't have time or patience to update it, or we flat out didn't have any news.  With CS going as it is, I think BL will always have updates on wins, losses and upcoming matches.  I will do my best to give input on the status of the clan and things we are striving for.  I don't expect this to become our message board because, it's not.  I do expect people to keep an eye on it though.  I realize most people just link to the board and don't even look at the page lately.  Well, it's time to start looking at the page!  Hopefully we'll add more things, maybe integrating the board into the page, or making this the gaming mecca that we always had hoped for (well Crom, myself and others did).  IRN4LIFE
