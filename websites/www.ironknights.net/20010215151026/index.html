First of all I have been suggesting getting together an IRN RS division for OGL again, that would be l33t seeing that we have some mad good RS players. Also our OGL open team has a match against the rank 37th clan this Sunday/Saturday. Cru and Jedi have been challenged on 2 on 2. Yoda is going to join up with Myst on 2 on 2 and Quenepa and DK have started a 2 on 2 ladder together. ALSO important news! We are going to have IRN UK*cough* limey division! Theyre going to have their own private board seperate (which is a good idea) so that they may be able to discuss clan matters in peace(without our constant bickering) Go <a href="http://boards.gamers.com/messages/overview.asp?name=UKnightsofIron">here</a> to check them out. I have been told they have about 5 or 6 good members as of now. This is a very cool thing guys. Plz post your congratulations, and congratulate Rishy for the idea! =)

Silversmoke has started playing CS, and Asskicker has informed me that he too will start to playing. Clan PC still has not responded to our challenge to play for rank 30, they have less than 30 hours to respond or we will soon be ranked 30 =) Our 2 on 2 teams are doing alright as well. Myst and g3n were suppose to have a 2 on 2 game yesterday but they completely forgot. Coming soon in CS: IRN Asian division? Allard and Mist are willing to play CS and start us up with an asian division. That would be so sweet.

			and actually have a match, we were denied that pleasure by ISP problems on clan @'s end.  This would have been our first non forefit win in 2 matches, but I guess this 
			one was just destined to be our third.  Regardless, having corresponded with Hired Gun from clan @ after the forefit, these guys are the coolest, nicest CS players 
			I've ever met.  Most people that have just accepted a forefit loss due to something that was totally out of their control would be ranting and raving, (and in many 
			prior incedents, swearing like crazy at us).  Not these guys though.  He even apologized for making us wait for them to show up!  Anyway, if you ever run into someone 
			named @HiredGun or something like that in a game, check to see if it's the same guy.  And if so, treat him like an IRNer, cause he win's Darkjedi's cool CS player of the year award =).

			and we will be facing off against them this Saturday night at 11:00.  Please come out to support us.  (Oh wait, this ISN'T a school sporting event...).  Anyway, We will 
			be playing de_dust and de_prodigy, and I predict wins on both maps.
			<br>
			<br>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In other news, I have recently had the pleasure of maptesting a bunch of version 1.1 maps, namely one called de_vertigo.  You can check out the SS of the playerlist <a href="http://www.geocities.com/darkjedi1282/swoon.jpg">here</a> 
			and I will be posting other SS's of the map as I play it later on.  If you note the list of players, you will note that N@rby, creator of the new Inferno map for version 1.1 
			was also playing with us.  Good god that was such a fun game.  With that in mind, I may be missing some of our weekend practices in favor of attending more maptesting sessions with the CS Dev team (they invited me back). 
			<br><br>
			Ok, enough gloating.
			<br><br>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The only other real news of the day is that the DH/IRN joint effort on OGL is progressing..... slowly..... but it's coming.  Akri and I played with one of the guys from DH 
			and he was pretty good.  I think that if this merger succeeds, it will work out great for both parties. 
			Also, once again, if you want anything added to the files section, <b>ICQ OR EMAIL ME!</b> (except for the new 1.1 maps such as vertigo, which I'll get kicked off the testing team if I post it.)

Welcome to our newest member to CS, Genetix. There was a meeting yesterday at 6pm EST. For details contact RazorHK or anyone else that was in attendance. 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In other news one of our own homegrown members, DarkJedi has made it into the most prestigeous school in the United States when it comes to Computer Science, MIT. Congratulations DarkJedi, you've certainly earned it. It seems that Cromwell has recently been preaching the good word of God. Has he truly seen the light and been saved? It seems MacArthur is still on a binge of being depressed. Cheer up man, you've got a whole life ahead of you. RickFish has finally achieved a goal that I hope to achieve one day. He has a computer that plays games other than Jedi Knight! Welcome to the ranks of the hardcore players once again sexy Rishy.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In CS news, those of you who have yet to sign up for the ladder, GO DO IT NOW!! <a href  "http://www.ogl.org">http://www.ogl.org/</a>. Do it, do it now, do it all night long =). DarkJedi and DarcYoda, you guys need to sign up for the 2 v 2 CS ladder if you haven't yet. There is a match that is supposed to happen today or tomorrow sometime between 3pm and 6pm, but don't forget that there is a CS scrimmage between us and the GX clan today at 6pm EST if that was ever worked out.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In Tribes news, thanks to an update from Genetix, it seems that I was misinformed with my previous post. We have many many months before the release of Tribes 2. We need to start getting some practices outlined, and clarify who all is interested in playing Tribes for us so that we can get all of the mechanics straightened out.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Your beloved reporter, yes me, will be gone in a couple days to the beautiful mountains of Tennessee for some good old R&R. The trip is going to last until next year basically so I won't be around to update for a bit. I just found out about this update yesterday while at the home of our friends. Christmas in the mountains. Oh joy.</p>							<P>---IRN-Aristotle---<BR>---Resident News Bitch/Passionate Asshole--- </P><P></P></FONT>						</TD>					</TR>				</TABLE>		<TABLE WIDTH=700 BORDER=0 CELLPADDING=0 CELLSPACING=0>					<TR HEIGHT="35" >						<TD BACKGROUND="images/newsbar3.jpg" ALIGN="RIGHT" HEIGHT="35" >							<FONT COLOR="#ffffff" SIZE=+1 face=verdana>Thursday, December 14th</FONT>						</TD>					</TR>					<TR>						<TD>							<p><BR><FONT COLOR="#ffffff" SIZE=-1face=verdana>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You want news? You got it. The GX CS clan has chalenged us to a scrimmage which is looking like it'll be held on Saturday sometime between 3 - 6pm EST according to everyone's avalibility. DemonKnight has been doing well coordinating the match so far. On to other things. There is a 2 v 2 OGL match comming up for us as well. This will be beginning at 6pm EST this upcomming Saturday or this upcomming Sunday. Those of you who still wish to sign up for the 2 v 2 CS Open should contact RazorHK or Crusader IMMEDIATELY.</font></p><FONT COLOR="#ffffff" SIZE=-1face=verdana>
<p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On another note, Slade has been working to try and gather a new Tribes(1) division for us in preperation for the release of Tribes 2 at the end of January. WE NEED MOTIVATION FOR THIS!!!!!!!!!!!!!! It's important for us to fine tune our skills so that we can be a top tribe from beginning to end, so let's get to working on this people! Don't forget to remind Bloodlust about any member information that needs to be included on the members potion of the site.</p>							<P>---IRN-Aristotle---<BR>---Resident News Bitch/Passionate Asshole--- </P><P></P></FONT>						</TD>					</TR>				</TABLE>			    		<TABLE WIDTH=700 BORDER=0 CELLPADDING=0 CELLSPACING=0>					<TR HEIGHT="35" >						<TD BACKGROUND="images/newsbar4.jpg" ALIGN="RIGHT" HEIGHT="35" >							<FONT COLOR="#ffffff" SIZE=+1 face=verdana>Friday, December 1st</FONT>						</TD>					</TR>					<TR>						<TD>							<BR><FONT COLOR="#ffffff" SIZE=-1face=verdana>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ok being home on a Friday really sucks, so I couldnt think of anything better to do than update the news and the site. Lets see..oh Tribes 2...hmm...interesting...we got Ravnos, Slade, AssKicker, Allard, Matrox, and Alvin_Maker showing interest. This could lead to something more...Also welcome our new CS member Crusader =) After a month we couldn't stand his whining and moaning anymore, so we just let him in hehehe j/k Cru We lub ya!. I briefly discussed with Darkjedi and asked him to provide us with more IRN CS practice time for our US division. He also agreed to finding a good US CS ladder. I talked to StuLove about our current server situation...our server is back up and he has installed the mods again. So I will be once again be collecting your ingame names and providing you with files, etc..etc..Also if I dont have your phone number yet, plz remind me to get it from you...we need it for the members portion of this website. Thats it for now, back to updating the site.. 							<P>---IRN_Blood_Lust---<BR>---Resident BiTcH/info collector guy---</P><P></P></FONT>						</TD>					</TR>				</TABLE>								<TABLE WIDTH=700 BORDER=0 CELLPADDING=0 CELLSPACING=0>					<TR HEIGHT="35" >						<TD BACKGROUND="images/newsbar3.jpg" ALIGN="RIGHT" HEIGHT="35" >							<FONT COLOR="#ffffff" SIZE=+1 face=verdana>Wednesday, November 29th</FONT>						</TD>					</TR>					<TR>						<TD>							<BR><FONT COLOR="#ffffff" SIZE=-1face=verdana>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First of all I would like to say that Sunday's practice was a definate success. We had about 7-8 people show up for the CS Practice. In other news we lost our first CS match to the highly skilled team, Snajpa. We only had two of our European members show up and so our American guys had to fill in for them. Despite getting ping whored and lack of experience, our American guys played pretty well...GJ guys! Darkstalker and Pest_Control played that match. Also we have a few more members joining our CS division..SilverSmoke..RickFish and the great Nefarious =p. They will all make great additions to our team. Last thing, if you want your profile updated/changed/deleted icq me Contact: 70533019							<P>---IRN_Blood_Lust---<BR>---Resident BiTcH/info collector guy---</P><P></P></FONT>						</TD>					</TR>				</TABLE>				<TABLE WIDTH=700 BORDER=0 CELLPADDING=0 CELLSPACING=0>					<TR HEIGHT="35" >						<TD BACKGROUND="images/newsbar1.jpg" ALIGN="RIGHT" HEIGHT="35" >							<FONT COLOR="#ffffff" SIZE=+1 face=verdana>Thursday, November 9th</FONT>						</TD>					</TR>					<TR>						<TD>							<BR><FONT COLOR="#ffffff" SIZE=-1face=verdana>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ok all, what I have done is linked all the member links on the right to their respective member profile, profiles which IRN_Blood_Lust has spent quite a bit of time making. Props go to him for this. Also, if you have any change in info, send to him. I think his profile will be up quite soon so the contact information will be there. Also, any questions regarding profile management should likewise be directed towards him. 							<P>---IRN_DarcYoda---<BR>---Resident Evil Green Guy With A Badass Stick---</P><P></P></FONT>						</TD>					</TR>				</TABLE>				<TABLE WIDTH=700 BORDER=0 CELLPADDING=0 CELLSPACING=0>					<TR HEIGHT="35" >						<TD BACKGROUND="images/newsbar2.jpg" ALIGN="RIGHT" HEIGHT="35" >							<FONT COLOR="#ffffff" SIZE=+1 face=verdana>Sunday, October 29th</FONT>						</TD>					</TR>					<TR>						<TD>							<BR><FONT COLOR="#ffffff" SIZE=-1face=verdana>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here is what I have so far for the new site layout.
