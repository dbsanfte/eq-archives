By that point in the game, the melees have insane magic resistance, which means that our spells can barely touch them.  And warriors just have too many hit points for us to kill them.  Our DD's just aren't mana efficient enough.<P>I was 51st once and fought a warrior friend of mine that was 10 or 11 levels lower than me just for the heck of it.  I killed him with root, blind, DD.  Now, here's the kicker.  He resisted my spells pretty well, even with the level diff.  And when I finally killed him, I was OOM.  So me being 51st, BARELY killed a 40-41 warrior.  I wouldn't stand a chance against a 50+ warrior.  I've dueled some recently during downtime and didn't stand a chance in any of them.  We're just not set up for it.  Until they start making heals do damage in PvP, we're just outmatched.   <IMG SRC="http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/tongue.gif"></FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#f7f7f7"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Meddik</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Isn't that kinda like Mike Tyson going and beating up a cardiologist or something?<P>I just say no thanks.<P>------------------<BR>Meddik Sawbones<BR>Member of <A HREF="http://www.suvangi.com/drunkenbandits/" TARGET=_blank>Drunken Bandits</A><BR>(Bristlebane Server)</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#dedfdf"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Kaelem</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">I duel a lot, and have yet to beat Warrior. <P>2 major problems with Warriors:<P>1) They have too many hp, very hard to really nuke them down.<P>2) They have high MR naturally, plus any smart person dueling a cleric will have high MR.<P>The second problem is less of a problem than the first =)<P>First off, The best place to duel is Arena.  I like it because it's safe to die there, and it's pretty decent size for running around in.<P>Anyhow, with a warrior, the first problem to get through is the MR. Get a Journeymans Walking Stick and go to work, dancing around to try and avoid their melee, backing off to heal if need be. It procs a weak tash, but it's better than nothing (roughly -20 to MR).<P>Watch their weapons, often they'll have an array of proccing weapons with some nasty procs. Keep your resists high to try and resist them, the snare whip is a favorite.<P>Dispell them if they use sow potions or long casting item buffs. Have jboots to at least match their speed if they have them. They may try and pumice stone you to remove your buffs.<P>Next, you just gotta try and wear down the HP with nukes :\ This is hard and will require medding as you won't have enough mana to kill them with 1 bar. Of course, while you med they will be bandaging, or possibly even using items, etc to heal.<P>Warriors are generally a no win fight, unless the warrior you are dueling is a complete idiot.<P>Clerics are very good duelers against casters, and the lower hp melee. Only casters I have problems with are enchanters, and only because of those damn mana seive spells.<P>Edit : Read some of the other posts after I posted, and had some comments. It is generally a bad idea to try and use roots, stuns, etc in duels. They are easily resisted with even low MR. Our nukes, however, are rarely outright resisted, even with high mr, you will just get a partial resist. I was landing full on a level 60 warrior with 80 MR(after tash =b). Also be aware your nuke will NOT do full damage anyway in PVP (unless they are feared =D).<P>Kaelem Vel`oloth<BR>Level 56 Cleric<BR>The Nameless<p>[This message has been edited by Kaelem (edited 04-04-2001).]</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#f7f7f7"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Aean</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">I constantly challenge GMs to fisticuffs but so far no takers.

Dumb warriors will not go too long without fighting something & taking some damage. If they have a cleric in their group, try explaining to the cleric what is going on & to let him get low enough without dieing to the mob so you can take him.

Then dispell him to get rid of sow, etc.  Stun him, then just apply fear and watch him run out in the middle of nowhere.  Most likely he'll get killed by any roaming mobs he just happens to pass by, but I can promise you that he will never think to ask you to duel again, hehe.<P>Fear kiting a tank around is destroys them bad.  Myself, I wouldn't use dispel, I want them running for a long time, but then I'm mean that way, hehe.  If a mob kills him, too bad, just res him.

In a few molments you will see that fear has wore off and they will be comming for you, pissed 2 times at you.<P>At this time, its time to go be friends with any guard you may see.  The guards in FV are exelent for this.  <P>Wait till they run by you to drop invis.  Then /wave them and bolt for the nearest guard.  Hastily they will have probably forgotten to hit "A" again and they will clobber you.  Too bad the guards dont like this, the guards become your best friends and will beat them into the next life.<P>Make sure you <BR>/bye<BR>Them right before the deathblow.<P>How to kill a paladin.  Let them hit you once, then bolt for as many guards as you can find.  Root the paladin repeaditly.  LoH will only work once.  Blast blast blast<P>Cinen<BR>Brell Server</FONT></TD></TR></TABLE>
