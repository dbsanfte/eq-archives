<TEXTAREA NAME="ReplyMessage" ROWS=10 COLS=45 WRAP="VIRTUAL">[QUOTE]Originally posted by daku inochi:
[B]Karnor's has been my hangout spot for the last 3 levels. I love this zone. I love the mobs, I love the drops, I love the entire dungeon. Easy to get to and from town and just a hop, skip and a jump away from both Skyfire and a port to Sebilis. I just love it. <grin> 

Last week I had the great opportunity to be in a couple of basement groups. With an aggressive puller and an enchanter and bard, a group could live down there for months and never come up for air. I did three blue bubs in as many hours at level 55 - no small accomplishment and a testiment to a good group.

<fast forward to last night>

I log in and hit Karnor's entrance. More than a dozen people at the zone, milling about. Camp check - basement is taken. I ask the basement group leader "Any room down there for a cleric?".

"Nah.. we have a shaman." Heh-heh. Shammies are good. Great even. But not as primary healers in the upper level zones and DEFINITELY not in the basement where the pulls are constant. Superior Healing notwithstanding, a shammie is NOT going to keep a group alive for very long. I silently shake my head and make them aware that I'll be around for a bit - "Can I get on the list then? I just logged on and would love to join you!"

No response. I wait a bit and repeat. Nada. Okay, no biggie - they must be in battle and he lost it in the spam. I wait a bit and swap buffs with a nearby enchanter. I see a ranger dueling a sentry and I use my Donal's arms on him repeatedly, healing him up and keeping him alive without dumping a ton of mana on him. He thanks me and gets the kill. See? I'm a nice guy. Everyone's alive and we're all happy. About three minutes pass and I resend the message to the basement guy.

His response - "I don't know".

Okay. I can deal with that. Lemme go see if I can be productive. So I run into the castle (I'm level 55 and rarely aggro the stuff in the hallways) and see if there are any undead blues I can solo. Dang. Nothing. I check the zone - 48 peeps there. Holy Population Explosion, Batman! No wonder there aren't things to hunt. I find a few people huddled in the closet and offer to group Hero them as I see that their cleric is level 48. They are very happy with the results and I leave them to their fun. I go back to the zone and sit and med a bit. 

Then I spot possibly one of the BIGGEST trains I've ever seen in this place. At least 8 skeletons, a half a dozen mutts and a Hand come POURING over the bridge and towards the zone. Within 2 seconds they are on top of me, smacking me like a spoiled child. They were so thick and concentrated that I couldn't see through them. No train warning, no shout. Just tons of bad guys. Zoiks. This can't be good...

I quickly check around me for any enchanters who can AE mezz the bunch. None. Time to get out of Dodge. I zone out with about 200 hit points left. I started with 2410.

Now, I'm on a 56k dialup, so my zoning isn't the fastest. As a matter of fact, I've seen abusively fat people squeeze into Lamborghinis MUCH faster than *I* can zone. I get to the other side and get TRAMPLED by requests for rezzes inside Karnors. Purple text flows up my screen. I'm the only un-anon cleric in the zone. (Shocker!) I respond to a few of the folks I know and tell them I'll help them as soon as the zone clears. They are pissed about the nasty train but seem relieved that I can help them. A few others get the afk message "I'm getting pummelled with requests for rezzes. I don't have a rez stick - please check for other clerics near you to help as I don't have THAT much mana."

I zone in to rez my buddies and whose corpse do I see at the zone? - the basement group leader. He was unlucky. I get a tell from him. "Can you rez me?"

He gets my /afk message and repeats himself once. I fix up the folks who got caught in that @#%$-storm train and med up more, getting a cool breeze from a nice enchanter who saw me helping others. ("Thanks, Mmog!") Then I get another tell from the basement leader.

"Can you rez three of us?"

Never a "please". Normally, if I have the time and mana, I'll rez someone. I like helping. But this guy was somehow rubbing me the wrong way. I'm not sure why, but he was. So I ignore his request and continue helping the folks who got railroaded. (Mental footnote to folks asking for someone to dump 700 mana on you - try "please" and "thank you". All I've *ever* asked from other folks is a little bit of courtesy for your fellow man/woman/ogre. <grin>)

Theeeeeen... the full story comes out from the basement group leader. That train was theirs - the shaman got aggroed from debuffing and then healing and went down fast. The shaman helped the puller live, but not before the heal aggro pulled about six mobs into the basement. Their enchanter mezzed a bunch before he ate it and the remaining four bolted, bringing all of them and their wide aggro range headlong into the only exit. The puller (the group leader) got caught and went down 40 feet from the zone. End of the sad story.

After going OOM twice while doing rezzes at the zone (there were NINE innocents at the zone who went down) I give the leader a tell.

"Got room for a cleric yet? <wink>" Now, mind you.. I don't want to join a group that pulls THAT kind of a train to the zone without so much as a warning. I was just curious if he was going to invite me or not.

"No, can you rez my group?"

"I guess that shaman can't help you much? <wink>" I let him chew on that for a moment, just to see if he's gonna go WFW on my sarcastic ass. Then I follow up his request.

"Sure.. I'll rez you. I see your body here. Give me a few moments to med."

I go to cast rez on him and he says "Wait. Don't rez me yet. I'm looking for a 56 rez." 

What a little turd!! Okay.. let's see how long he's going to wait for a 6 percent increase in gained XPs. Experience which, if you are in the KC basement, can be regained in about 10 min. His dead shaman is bound at entrance to Sebilis. And the group leader is bound in Thurgadin. Ouchies.

I sit around medding for a bit.. and get invited to a group with some friends who just logged on. We take the left courtyard with a full and balanced group. We start pulling and the fights are short but fun. Constant killing and LOTS of bone chips. Sweet!! /random 100 <Grin>

I get a tell from that basement group leader more than 30 minutes later. "Hey can you rez me?"

Holy shiite. These brain-locked experience hounds have been mulling about for about forty-five minutes looking for a TINY increase in regained experience when they COULD have already been rezzed and hunting! I cannot believe the short-sightedness of these people!! I give him my standard reply hotkey "/R I'm sorry friend, I'm in a group now and cannot help you."

He pleaded and begged for about 10 min, and even had someone drag his corpse to the back courtyard and deposit it at my feet - which, by the way, is a bit uncool if you've already been declined a rez. The dragger then emoted "/points to corpse" and other niceties to grab my attention while I'm in battle and LOM. I don't have a chanter nearby and there are no bard tunes are available to help with downtime. I tell him "Drag to the zone and I'll rez you when I'm done here". He goes off in a huff and I never hear from them again.


Moral to the story, Folks? Take the rez when it's offered 'cause you might not get that offer again.

Your Friendly Neighborhood Cleric,
