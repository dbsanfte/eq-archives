          <hr>
          <p>I will try to lay out Cazic Thule dungeon for you as best as I can.
          I have spent the last 17 levels there (since level 20), and have found
          no place better for both exp or loot (Yesterday, in 14 hours of
          hunting, I made 130 plat and was with a full group the entire time).
          However, one word of caution: it is very dangerous primarily due to
          mobs and trains, so if you are one of these folks that goes AFK a lot,
          you won't live very long. That having been said, let me see if I can
          give you a decent description of what to expect from Cazic. If I
          forget anything or screw something up, my apologies, and feel free to
          jump in with your own experiences or corrections in any errors I have
          made.</p>
          <p><strong>1. Monsters</strong>.</p>
          <blockquote>
            <p><strong>A. Lizards</strong>. Almost all the monsters in here are
            lizards, with the exception of a few, and they carry everything from
            1 copper up to 4 plat plus and rusty, bronze and fs (fine steel)
            weapons, as well as the most coveted items of all, the rubicite
            armor, which I will discuss separately. Obviously, the higher level
            lizzies carry the best loot, but not always. It varies, although you
            won't find the fs weapons on the lower level lizzies. However, with
            a full party of level 20s you can take on the lizzies right away
            that carry the fs weapons. The lizzies in order of difficulty are as
            follows, from the easiest to the most difficult: broodling, warrior
            and guard (bout the same), defender (this is the one that starts
            carrying the fs weapons), sentinel, proselytyte, disciple, page,
            herald, protector, fanatic, zealot, justicar, and judicator. There
            are three other &quot;special&quot; lizzies that carry the rubicite
            (red) armor, but I'll discuss them later. Prosletytes, disciples,
            heralds, pages, justicars and judicators are casters, and by that I
            mean they vary in having the same great spells the clerics do (after
            all this IS a temple) such as wrath (oh yeah, they'll hit ya for 400
            pts. with one wrath if you are low level) and then the buff/heal
            spells, bravery and greater heal (heals 300 hps) which they use not
            ONLY on themselves prior to and at the beginning of battle, but
            during battle as well AND on any other lizzies that you are fighting
            as well as them. This is one of the things that makes it so
            difficult....you rarely ever can pull just one lizzie, and
            hopefully, if you pull more than two or more, one isn't a caster. If
            it is, don't panic, just take the caster lizzie out first and fast.
            This is where wizzes come in REAL handy cause they can pop them for
            big dmg with their spells. At higher levels (29+), clerics should
            switch to the &quot;wiz&quot; mode if a big caster lizzie comes, and
            take it down FAST after stunning it with Force to stop its casting,
            then using wrath on it. Believe me, it will cost you less mana to
            take it out fast than it will cost you in healing all your tanks
            after the lizzie heals itself 4 or 5 times and the tanks have no hps
            left. The higher level lizzies are still sometimes hitting me for 64
            dmg, even tho I am now level 37 with good armor.</p>
          </blockquote>
          <blockquote>
            <p><strong>B. Alligators</strong> The gators in here are little
            gators, about 1/10 the size of the caimens and crocodiles in oasis,
            but you ain't never been bitten by a gator til one of these takes a
            bite out of your arse. They are little but bite like lockjaw in
            oasis when you were in your teens. Don't even try to take these on
            til you are in your high 20s, because you can never pull just one
            from the tanks and sometimes one of the high level lizzies comes
            along. And they will attack anything that is near it, regardless of
            whether your group pulled it.</p>
          </blockquote>
          <blockquote>
            <p><strong>C. Golems</strong> So far, three golems have been found:
            clay, stone and steel. Golems, along with three other special
            lizards and one other monster, are what carry the rubicite armor.
            They are pretty tough critters in and of themselves, but the problem
            is, they are guarded by several other high level lizzies, including
            casters, and they ALWAYS come with it when you pull it. And the
            developers have located these golems in areas that aren't close to
            the zone, so you either have a far distance to run or have to swim
            out of a tank then run uptairs to the courtyard and THEN head for
            the zone. That's when you will be glad you are a cleric with GATE,
            or have a shaman/druid in your group that keeps everyone SOWd.</p>
          </blockquote>
          <blockquote>
            <p><strong>D. Gorillas</strong> (or Rillas, as they are
            affectionately called, or Magillas) These hairy guys are big, and
            guard the throne downstairs on the first level of the Throne Room.
            They are big, mean and tough and hit hard if you are under level 30.</p>
          </blockquote>
          <p><strong>2. Rubicite Armor</strong><br>
          This is some of the most coveted armor AND most difficult to acquire
          in the game. It is red and the equivalent of plate, but is magical
          (although it doesn't add anything to stats) and very light. Not to
          mention how incredibly COOL it looks (LOL). The following monsters and
          their locations are what carry the rubicite armor. The problem is,
          these monsters spawn very infrequently (some take 3 - 4 hours between
          spawns), do not carry the rubi everytime (maybe one out of 4 or 5
          times it spawns, and more), and are ALWAYS camped with a long list of
          people waiting to get to that area to get into the group and get in
          line for the rubi.</p>
          <blockquote>
            <p><strong>A. Greaves (leggins)</strong> The Taew Eew Templar lizzie
            carries the rubi leggins. It spawns (infrequently) on the Throne in
            the downstairs, or first level, of what is known as the Throne Room.
            It also drops the lizardscale cloak (AC8, +5 Dex).</p>
            <p><strong>B. Gloves</strong> The steel golem carries the rubi
            gloves, and the spawn rate and frequency of having the gloves is
            same as above for the leggins. The steel golem lives downstairs
            through one of the tanks you must swim down and through and then up
            a ladder in an area off of what is known as the gator tunnel. This
            used to be a relatively safe area until they made the gators aggro,
            so now, even mid-30s to level 40 players have to be careful because
            you can get mobbed by gators even if you don't pull the golem, and
            if you can't evac with a wiz or have gate, you are in a world of
            hurt trying to zone out.</p>
          </blockquote>
          <blockquote>
            <p><strong>C. Helmet</strong> The rubi helmet is carried by the
            stone golem, who spawns on a throne upstairs in the Throne Room,
            known as the Second Floor Throne Room. Spawn rate for golem and
            frequency of having the helmet is same. This is a tough area, and
            only groups of mid-35s should attempt it. It's tough because of the
            spawn that comes from downstairs, in the room itself, from a room to
            the left, and upstairs on third floor where the golem spawns. This
            room and its surrounds, with the exception of the downstairs, has
            all the high level lizzies, such as the zealots, heralds, prots,
            justicars and judicators.</p>
          </blockquote>
          <blockquote>
            <p><strong>D. Boots</strong> The Cazic Cenobite lizzie carries
            these, with same spawn rate and frequency. It spawns inside a little
            dip below the huge green bubble downstairs that you swim down to to
            get to an area to base to hunt from. It's not too tough, but it is a
            caster. Again, this is a spot for levels 35+, and has same high
            level lizzies and gators thrown in just to make it interesting.</p>
            <p><strong>E. Breastplate</strong> The toughest monster found so far
            in Cazic carries this, with same spawn and frequency. It spawns in
            same spot inside the big green bubble downstairs where the Cenobite
            lizzie spawns. It is known as the Avatar of Fear, and believe me, it
            is the biggest, ugliest thing in all Cazic, and will take you out in
            a heartbeat. If it is alone (infrequently), a group of full 35+ can
            do it ...the problem comes when a judicator or two shows up or
            spawns right after, and then stands there and buffs and heals the
            damn avatar while the group is trying to kill it, and at the same
            time starts whaling on YOU, the cleric, when you're trying to heal
            your tanks who are getting the crap kicked out of em by the avatar.
            A very dangerous monster, my friends. Beware.</p>
            <p><strong>F. Bracers</strong> The Taew Eew Diviner carries these,
            with same frequency and spawn rate. It spawns on the downstairs
            throne where the Templar with the greaves spawns. About the same
            difficulty, except for one difference: this little lizzie will CHARM
            and charm REAL good. Our group has almost been killed by our tank
            who pulled and then got charmed and started beating the crap outta
            all of us.&nbsp; His secondary drop is the Lizardscale Mantle, +3
            Int and +3 wisdom.</p>
            <p><strong>G. Rubicite Vambraces (Arms)</strong> The Tae Ew Archon (archaron?)
            drops these.&nbsp; His common drop is the Lizardscale Belt, AC2, HP
            +10, Mana +10, All/All.&nbsp; He is located at the top of the
            pyramid like temple which is on the other side of the maze.&nbsp;
            Directions through the maze (ed. send in corrections, if any,
            please) are:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Enter the maze through the door in the courtyard</li>
              <li>Turn left at the first crossroads</li>
              <li>Follow the passage and take the right turn where you can see a
                room with four pillars ahead of you (2nd right turn?).</li>
              <li>Go straight across this room and take the 2nd left turn.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
              <li>This is a long tunnel to some steps which lead into the temple
                area.</li>
              <li>This is a very dangerous area with a lot of high level lizards
                (fanatics, zealots, justicars, and judicators).</li>
              <li>At the top ring of the temple is a room inside.&nbsp; This is
                where the Tae Ew Archon drops the arms.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
          </blockquote>
          <p><strong>3. Hunting Areas and Levels</strong><br>
          The Cazic temple is HUGE with lots of hunting areas upstairs,
          downstairs, and throughout. I will try to tell you in general where
          they are, with appropriate levels to hunt at, but the best thing is to
          just go yourself and get with someone who is familiar with the
          dungeon.</p>
          <blockquote>
            <p><strong>Levels 20 - 30</strong>: You should stay either in the
            zone area (corridor) or the courtyard (cy) outside the double doors
            of the zone area. Broodlings, warriors and guards usually travel or
            guard this zone corridor and will attack you if you are medding. The
            danger with hunting in the corridor zone area is the huge number of
            trains that come by from folks that are zoning. You are better off
            to base around the perimeter of the cy to avoid these constant
            trains, and so your casters can med in relative safety. You should
            pull defenders and sentinels from what is known as the maze (named
            this for a good reason). The maze is through a door to the right
            when you enter the cy. Be careful pulling if you don't know the
            maze...there are many many lizzies in there who will attack you, and
            you will get lost easily in the corridors and die very fast. Don't
            go in very deep until you learn the maze.</p>
          </blockquote>
          <blockquote>
            <p><strong>Levels 30 - 35</strong>: You can now advance to the
            downstairs throne room (has med - high level lizzies with the rillas)
            which is through the door on the left side of the cy, or head
            downstairs to the gator tunnel, or pull gators to the courtyard from
            one of the tanks that are located up the ladder on one side of the
            courtyard, or up the ladder on the other side then downstairs. There
            is also an area known as the Arena, which is through a door and down
            several corridors on the opposite side of the throne room. There are
            the higher level lizzies here, such as the heralds, prots, zealots,
            fanatics, justicars and judicators, with some medium ones such as
            sentinels thrown in. You will have to fight your way down the
            corridors through sents and defenders to get to the arena. Another
            good area less frequented is known as the Upstairs Temple. You get
            to this by going through the maze. It is a square area, with higher
            level lizzies that spawn on the four corners, and some that are
            &quot;wanderers&quot;. There are stairs up here that also lead to
            like 4 more levels and at the top level, a tank. You will have to
            fight your way through the maze to upstairs, unless you get a wiz
            who can inviso everyone (I highly recommend this...I do not travel
            the maze unless I am inviso) Once upstairs, clear the corner to the
            left, then move around clearing the next corner, and base in center
            of next hallway and pull as the corners respawn, or go up the stairs
            and pull from there.</p>
          </blockquote>
          <blockquote>
            <p><strong>Levels 35 +</strong>: You're big, bad and tough now, and
            with a full group the same levels, can take on anything else in
            cazic. But don't get cocky, because as I said, these lizzies and
            gators, not to mention the avatar, seldom come without their buds,
            so be prepared for fighting up to 4 at a time if you are in the

          <p><strong>4. Tips on Hunting Cazic</strong></p>
          <blockquote>
            <p><strong>A. Grouping</strong>. Always hunt with full group if you
            can. This is dangerous place. And have a well-rounded group, which
            is safest. Two clerics I've found in a group are great, along with
            someone who can SOW, two good tanks and a wiz who can nuke the
            bejeebers out of em. A monk or ranger with good range skills (bow)
            are TERRIFIC, since they have the ability to pull just one at a
            time. I've lived a lot longer with a good puller...a bad puller will
            get you killed LOTS and you'll spend all your time zoning with
            trains on you, that tend to make you VERY unpopular with the others
            hunting there.</p>
          </blockquote>
          <blockquote>
            <p><strong>B. Trains</strong>. Oh yeah, they are big, bad and
            frequent. Primarily because of the difficulty in pulling just one or
            two monsters. Most folks are good about yelling train tho...it's a
            close knit community inside Cazic and woe to the person who
            constantly trains without warning others and gets other groups
            killed. It isn't long before that person can't find anyone to hunt
            with. If a party zones with a train on them, the lizzies will return
            to the cy or stay in the corridor zone area and jump on anyone else
            who is around. This hurts big time when your group is itself engaged
            in a fight with 2 or 3 lizzies, and 3 more jump in.</p>
          </blockquote>
          <blockquote>
            <p><strong>C. Outside the zone</strong>. In all their great wisdom,
            the developers have placed Bouncers (big bad, very very fast and
            hard hitting ogres) who patrol outside and around the temple ramp
            where you need to enter, and have now started coming into the
            &quot;safe&quot; zone area (corridor) where everyone zones out to
            from the temple. One of these ogres can take me out in about 4
            seconds flat, but they usually come into the &quot;safe&quot;
            corridor area in twosies, and with both whaling on you, have taken
            out over half my hps in like 1 or 2 seconds before I managed to zone
            back into cazic. They kill many people who have zoned out with low
            hps, only to be met by one of these nasty ogres. One of my friends
            died 4 times in that corridor in about 3 minutes...he was bound
            right there and got killed, and everytime he reappeared the ogres
            killed him again. He was NOT happy.</p>
          </blockquote>
          <blockquote>
            <p><strong>D. Healing</strong>. By now you have learned that when
            you are fighting a mob, the first heal you cast is gonna draw the
            mobs onto you big time. Nowhere is that more true than in Cazic.
            Lizzies HATE healers more than any other monster I've found, and
            they won't let you med during a fight, and will beat on you with a
            vengeance soon as you heal. Make damn sure you are in group that
            some can taunt or pull off you, and make sure they know that if you
            get hit, you will not be able to cast to keep the party alive. It is
            imperative that the group protect you, because you will die very
            quickly in a mob after you cast that first heal. Keep Root or
            Enstill memmed so you can at least root them until one of the tanks
            can pull them off you. I've also found Wave of Fear to be useful to
            make the whole mob run long enough for the group to zone and me to
            gate. ALWAYS keep gate and your invulnerable spell memmed and always
            SOW on you...it can mean the difference quite frequently in whether
            you make it out or not.</p>

          <p><strong>4. Conclusion</strong><br>
          I hope I've given you sort of a thumbnail of Cazic. I know I've
          forgotten lots of things, so if you have any questions, post them on
          the board and I'll try to answer them for everyone. I have hunted
          Cazic almost exclusively since I was level 20 (I am level 37 now) and
          have found no other place that can beat it for exp and loot or making
          really good friends. This is where all the high level players on The
          Rathe levelled. I have been very fortunate in that I have been able to
          acquire rubi boots, gloves, bracer, greaves and helmet. BTW, the
          location of Cazic Thule is through the Innothule swamps. You have to
          swim across a short river and then follow the edge of the temple on
          your left around to the ramp that takes you up to the corridor that
          leads into the zone. The bad thing is, that with so many people in
          Cazic now, the PL and lag can be deadly, not to mention the constant
          trains. But once you get high enough and can go into those out of the
          way areas, the only trains you have to worry about are YOURS. Good
          luck to you all, and may the light of Mithaniel Marr forever keep you
          safe and guide you in your journeys.</p>
