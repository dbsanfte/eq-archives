Your 3 parties zone into Fear, get annihilated. You manage to camp invis in the corner.

You log back in and the only other living guy, the ranger who invised you to camp suddenly loses invis, aggroing multiple Clerics of Innoruk!  After the finish beating him down you suddenly realize they see you too!

You didn't have either DA memmed.

You have gate memmed!

You begin to cast Gate.
<insert cleric being pummelled for 4 bubbles of health here>
You regain your concentration and continue casting!
<LOADING PLEASE WAIT> (You begine laughing in insane hysterical relief)
You have entered Nagafen's Lair.
DOH!
Helloooo there Mr Fire Giant Wizard!

I had forgotten I had bound myself right outside Nagafen's room for a dragon hunt the night before...Never have you seen happiness turn to horror so quickly![/B][/QUOTE]

Not only do more and more deaths occur each day, but these are being accomplished in an extremely shoddy and amateurish fashion.<P>After over a year of effort, constantly polishing my style, I have come up with a point system that I believe may help improve the quality of deaths in Norrath. The point system is primarily based on style, with higher scores indicating better performance. It is my aim to edify the general populace and perhaps point out a few style enhancements that may prove worthwhile.<P>The point system starts out with a base of Zero (being the basic newbie death) and extends upwards. It is not a fixed system, so particularly noteworthy style issues may be allotted extra points. Remember to add or subtract all point scores that apply.<P>General (Any class)<BR>Inches from zone line: +20<BR>Massive train: +10<BR>You were helping someone when massive train occurs behind you: +10<BR>Trying to solo something completely impossible and (almost) succeeding: +30<BR>Causing a massive train, which kills you along with others: -10/person<BR>Causing massive train, but dying before the train gets anywhere (thus only YOU die) +10<BR>Having your "Train to Zone! message interrupted by death: +10 points.<BR>Having your second "Train to Zone! message interrupted, but getting first one out: +20<BR>Getting lost while trying to zone: +5<BR>Getting lost spectacularly (IE going in the opposite direction from zone): +15<BR>Losing camo or invisibility while in an area populated by more than 3 mobs over 3 levels higher than you: +30<BR>Smacking into a door that has just closed in front of you in a cartoonish fashion on the way to the zone: +40<BR>Falling into Lava: +20<BR>Falling into Lava while trying to retrieve the corpse you lost in the lava: +30<BR>Falling into Lava while trying to retrieve another person's corpse lost in lava: +50<BR>Falling into Lava because you didn't noticed the levitation Icon was blinking: +20<BR>Bonus for original witty remark on the way down (Hot time in the old town tonight and other cliches do NOT count, while "Wheeeee!" may, depending on review of death): +40<BR>Actually zoning, but dying immediately on the other side: +100<BR>Any witty remark ("It's only a flesh wound!" may result in a penalty) just before death: +20<BR>Everyone else in your area went LD when the BIG SPAWN occurs: +40<BR>...if you make a witty remark anyway, an additional: +10<BR>...if anyone in your party gets back in time to hear it: +50<BR>A heal gets off just as the LOADING, PLEASE WAIT message appears: +20<P>Healer Types:<BR>You were tanking: -30<BR>You weren't planning to tank: +20<BR>You manage to get a heal off on yourself before dying: +10<BR>You manage to get a heal off on someone else before dying: +30<BR>The heal you got off is what caused you to die: +10<BR>Everyone else survived: +10<BR>Got bored and decided to pull: -40<BR>(Druids only) Evaccing party and healing the member who's hitpoints suddenly plummet, not reaizing the druids and treeants around are responsible: +50<BR>...if rest of party survives: +60<P>Caster types:<BR>DoT'd self accidentally: -30<BR>...if you manage to get an original witty remark off before you die: +10<BR>...if the DoT kills you after you zone or the partie's safety is ensured: +30<BR>Nuked Self: -20<BR>...if you manage to get an original witty remark off before you die ("Oops!" or "D'oh!" may result in a penalty): +10<BR>Repeated death due to binding badly: +20 per death<BR>Lost level due to binding badly: +5 per level<BR>Managing an original witty remark before dying: +30 per successful remark<BR>...if each makes sense in relation to the others (ie Ack!

Of course, discovering all the nuances involved in the art of dying will be the work of many years and may not be attainable at all, yet I have undertaken to make it my life's work. Many do not understand this subtle art yet and seem to see each death as a bad thing, not the opportunity for improvement and character development that it really is. My personal best score on this scale so far is 185.<P>So, print this list out, all, and start working on your form!
