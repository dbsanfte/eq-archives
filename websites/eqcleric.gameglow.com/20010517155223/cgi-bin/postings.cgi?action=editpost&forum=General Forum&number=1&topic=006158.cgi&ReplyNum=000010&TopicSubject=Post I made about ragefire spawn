<TEXTAREA NAME="EditedMessage" ROWS=10 COLS=45 WRAP="VIRTUAL">I'm going to dodge the whole "who deserves to get an epic" issue since it's obviously something that Verant determines.  However, I see two major issues with the epics in general and ours specifically:

1) The difficulty of the epics for the various classes is incredibly disparate and frankly that is just not fair.

2) Our epic is too damned easy to get to the last step, and if it wouldn't be for the incredible amount of Clerics waiting to complete the entire quest would be a breeze.

Comments on #1:
Some classes have a very easy (relatively speaking) epic to complete compared to others.  I think most can agree that Rogues and Shamans go to the top of the ease list with Wizards and Mages at the bottom.  I don't understand how Verant can create quests where a Mage has to get to Isle 7 in Sky to get a final item whereas a Rogue merely has to kill a mob in Kithicor, but what's new right?  The Shaman quest's final mob can be duo'd by a Mage and a Cleric (I know because we did it).  Wizards not only have to be in a good guild to kill VS, but in addition have to be online when the servers come up since the half-life on Venril Sathir is around 15 minutes from spawn, so tough crap if you have a normal job on the West coast.  My problem with the quests in general is VS is just full of it when they say the quests are meant to be "epic."  There should be absolute parity and currently there is nothing near it.

Comments on #2:
I think we need to be honest and admit except for the final bottleneck the Cleric quest is damned easy.  It's boring, it takes time, but it's easy.  Bergurgle, Shmendrick and the Lava Elemental can be easily duo'd, the Plasmatic Priest is a cinch to do with a Trio (Shaman/Cleric/melee) and the Overking is easy for two good 55+ groups (he is, really).  Ixiblat can be tough, no question about it, but he's still doable and many many Clerics get there sceptres during an "Ixi Party."

So with the quest being too easy what happens is we get an incredible number of Clerics getting to the Ragefire point.  Since we have so many Clerics reaching this point, and only 2-3 per server per week getting completed (that's when there aren't server downs) we have an increasingly growing number of frustrated Clerics.  It definitely sucks to be at the final stage of a quest along with 50+ other people on your server.  And to make matters worse the problem is increasing since I'd bet that more Clerics are getting to the bottleneck each week than Clerics completing the quest.

I wrote Absor a few weeks ago (I'm sure he just deleted, he never responded) outlining some problems (KSing, conflict, bottleneck, etc) along with some suggested solutions:

1) Make Plasmatic Priest much harder.  For example, level 60 and totally MR would be a start.

2) Make Overking harder.

3) Make Ixiblat harder.

4) Make epic effect only work at 56+.  Since I've heard that effects can only be set at 50, then make it so the quest givers only talk to 55+ Clerics.  Sorry for all you lower level Clerics, but my feeling is you should be able to cast the spell before you can use the effect.  Go level up a bit.

5) Leave Ragefire where he is, but add a triggerable mob (ala Feydedar) that is low 60s and requires 4-5 good groups to kill.  This allows the weaker guilds a chance to get an easy Ragefire while the stronger guilds can go after the triggered mob.  Put the trigger mob on a 12/24 hour timer.

Frankly I'd love to see Verant really retune all of the quests to achieve parity, but I have little hope they will do it.
