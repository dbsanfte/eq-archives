<TEXTAREA NAME="ReplyMessage" ROWS=10 COLS=45 WRAP="VIRTUAL">[QUOTE]Originally posted by Ambul Ants:
[B]Verants has the majority of people running around like chickens without their heads over focus items, and changes/nerfs to them.

I think this was just a diversion to keep us occupied while the real change came in the huge increase in DMG/Sec in casting Mobs.

I think this is going to reduce the number of 2 and 3 person groups and favor the 4-6 person groups.  I think it is also going to increase the need for healing power.  I saw a couple of examples in Seb last night, and guild chat had lots of "that worm just cast ice commit on me", and other such stuff.

We may have got more in this patch than we thought, it just may take a couple of days for additional deaths to increase the demand for clerics in exp groups.  

I'm not realing suggesting Verant is smart enought to plan this, there are to many examples to the contrary, but may be they have put some of there aa pts into INT...

Part of the tactics in engaging mobs was to burn down caster mobs fast so they couldn't burn down one of your groupmates.<P>Post-Kunark caster mobs became a joke.  Hell, whenever a caster mob is casting, you're actually glad because it's not trying to melee you.  Does that seem right?</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#dedfdf"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Viscera</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">I'm glad they finally increased the mob AI. The game HAS been getting too easy. How many n00bs have you seen recently that are upper 50s plus and still don't know how to do basic things?<P>That being said, if Verant wants caster mobs to be in line with PCs more, they should now nerf the melee damage these caster mobs do. They are already casting spells that were balanced on PCs vs NPCs, not the other way around. Having them also hit for 200+ really puts a crimp on it.<P>------------------<BR><A HREF="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=191031" TARGET=_blank>Viscera Galen</A><BR>L60 High Priest of Brell<BR><A HREF="http://www.darktemplarsguild.co.uk" TARGET=_blank>Dark Templars</A><BR>Xegony</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#f7f7f7"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Electro</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">There are a few things I would point out about the "difference" between NPC and PC mobs that this change makes manifestly important.<P>First off, casting NPCs cheat like the dickens when it comes to things like channelling. Watching gnolls in Splitpaw channel every spell over and over for three hours with two hasted melees (Monk and Warrior) hit them was disturbing.<P>Second, they don't have to worry about mana conservation. They can use their entire mana pool in 60 seconds and not think about having to rest. PC Casters have to worry about that, a lot.<P>Third, they have far more hps even than player warriors. Hit like warriors when not casting (though the casting AI is now CLEARLY attempting to choose to cast the best nuke possible far more than it will try to choose melee attacks) and generally have the abilities of super PCs with super casting abilities. Every single mob.<P>NPC casters don't have the same range limitations players do (if they start to cast while you are in range you could be ten miles away and they will still hit you.)<P>Now, while I can agree to an extent that caster mobs were underpowered to an extent in the high end game, they are now fearsome. Woe is the puller trying to get 2 casters to camp. We had a warrior (level 54 with Aegolism) die trying to pull 2 casters in Akheva. He died in about 12 seconds as they both chain nuked Ice Comet on him. No healer can ever keep up with this sort of damage rate, it was basically like he got death touched.<P>Make of any of this what you will. But for now, my claim is that all caster mobs are now substantially overpowered compared to non caster mobs and players alike.<P>Electro</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#dedfdf"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Boanerges</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">On the upside, Verant is apparently doing away with the Abashi view of old that "We let our NPCs cheat as a feature to keep the game challenging".<P>The downside is, as usual, that this unbalances the game. I've heard LGuk wizards are nuking for 600. That is a serious dent to a 40-50 character.<P>------------------<BR>Boanerges Thundercry<BR>High Priest of Prexus<BR><A HREF="http://www.cohort.cc" TARGET=_blank>Cohort Chalybeius</A><BR>Cazic Thule Server</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#f7f7f7"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Aean</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">I'm just curious as to how rediculous nuking counts as AI? Did these mobs have these nukes before and were just not programmed well enough to use them?</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#dedfdf"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">varthdadur</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Are you kidding?  This is standard Verant behavior.  Give the players something good so they don't complain too much about a nerf they are making.  There are countless examples but i'll just name one very obvious one:<P>Remember when sewing kits and other trade skill containers only had a weight of 0.1?  They increased this to 3.0 so that players would not be using them as back packs.  To offset this, they made it so if you hit the combine button on these containers you don't lose everything if it isn't a valid recipe.  In this case, I think the positive WAY out weighed the negative.<P>Now with the new focus items going in they snuck in caster AI enhancements.  I think the AI changes will make clerics more desirable but my concern is now you have to have all these focus items to counter/offset the increase in caster mob power.  This does not seem like caster balancing to me but just upping the stakes.<P>My overall verdict:  AI changes are good.  It makes the game more challenging.  However, I've found that I have to crap buff my tank for normal xp grinds or he'll get good buffs dispelled!  <IMG SRC="http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/frown.gif"><P>------------------<BR>Baron Varth L60 High Priest<BR>Mogwa L51 Monk</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#f7f7f7"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Belkram_BB</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Electro -- Of course the game is rigged but you cant win if you dont play. <P>The mobs are SUPPOSED to be tougher than the players thats why you can form a party of 6 people and outnumber them 2 or 3 to one on an average pull. Verant is upping the difficulty bar in the average dungeon due to gear inflation. Its long overdue. Maybe, just MAYBE healers will be needed again. And yes, I know of places where melee dont need a healer of ANY type to get solo exp at 60. <P><BR>Belkram</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#dedfdf"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Dikmer</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Aeann,<P>Basically, yes. A wizard MOB that /conned at level 49 would mostly use level 30ish nukes (sometimes even lower). It's kind of a joke when a 49+ wizard MOB was nuking you for 6 points of damage. Now, a wizard MOB of level 49 or higher WILL use level 49 spells like Ice Comet. ALOT.<P>I agree with previous posters. When those 49+ casters were using 30- spells but hitting like they were 60+ warriors, that was just wrong. Now that the caster MOBs actually CAST what they should, their melee should be nudged down.</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#f7f7f7"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Lynet</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">As I read today's comments on the eq message boards, I suspect that the caster mobs will be retuned once we have had a few weeks of commercial beta on the new mob ai.<P>I am glad that caster tuning included the mob casters.  As others have said, this change makes the game more interesting while making it more difficult.  It also changes the requirements for casters and for what the casters are to be doing.<P>I know I will be loading more stuns, the wizards will be loading more stuns, and the short warriors will once again be carrying shields in a convenient box for swapping and bashing.<P>I also expect that long pulls just became much more dangerous and that successful groups might spend more time running a circuit rather than sitting in one place and bringing things to them.  <P>That and we will see things like "next pull is two casters, from X room" "cleric coming ... casting celestial NOW" "incoming a_rude_wizard_07" and then the puller and the cleric both go jogging back towards camp.<P>It works when pulling multiple HT mobs, it should work on casters.  <P>It reminds me of the days of pulling Unrest in the low 20s, before Kunark came out.  When you HAD to buff your puller's resists otherwise the ghoul would root them, the TT would throw them in the air, and the festering hags would shoot lightning bolts at the flying ranger as if they were shooting skeet.<P>Lynet Beaumains, The Damosel Savage</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#dedfdf"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Ambul Ants</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">I watched a 56 shammy and a War get owned in seb last night, and I must admit that I grined  <IMG SRC="http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/smile.gif">.

PCs have FAR greater advantages than a higher con. I dare say that a GOOD L50 PC rouge can kill a L55 PC warrior. This is because human beings can be smart or dumb in a wide range.

Will be funny if they start casting AE mez tho LOL.<P>------------------<BR><A HREF="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=20365" TARGET=_blank>Citra Dangermouse-60 ENC</A><BR><A HREF="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=20357" TARGET=_blank>Venerable Pilsburry Dangermouse-60 CLR</A><BR>Celestial Tomb<BR>VEESHAN</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#dedfdf"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Aean</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">well can't really argue with that then. If they should have been casting those spells all along ......<P>It's also nice to shake things up a bit every now and again, makes things not so boring. Thats one of the cool things about this kinda game, things change.<P>The only things i would like to see would be to make casting mobs do caster melee damage. If they're gonna chain nuke like that they shouldn't pack a wallop in their punhes too. And also, if they are gonna make mobs harder and they kep pushing this risk vs reward BS in our faces, then up the exp we get from them.</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#f7f7f7"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">varthdadur</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial"> <BLOCKQUOTE><font size="1" face="Verdana, Arial">quote:</font><HR>Originally posted by Gryfalia:<BR><B>Sorry, but making the tradeskill combine buttons not nuke incorrect combines is SO MUCH MORE IMPORTANT than making their weight 3.0, it's painful to even see it mentioned together.<P>Yes, I realize you have a monk, so do I.

Focus items for summonning, affliction, and reanimation seem to be very common while the ones that might benefit clerics - preservation, range, and healing - are extremely rare, even more so with the nerf patch.<P>Is there some big pro-cleric change in the works that this is softening other casters up for? I sure hope so.<P>As far as NPC casters are concerned, all this will do is drive people out of areas with casters and into areas without them. Watch OS become a ghost town now.</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#dedfdf"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Kaysha Soulsinger</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">I think NPCs will now also be limited to range, much like PC casters are now.<P>Yesterday my druid was at the docks in ButcherBlock, when up to twice in short succession an Aqua Goblin Wizard came out of the water who agroed on me and started to cast. The first one was red to me, so I backed out, wondering if it had indeed agroed on me.<P>I didn't get hit, but it kept moving in my direction and casting again, after which I backed out again, not getting a spell up my behind. Eventually it came too close to the guards and got killed.<P>The second one was an even con, and the same thing happened. I don't know if I could have taken it on, probably could, but I wanted to see if I indeed could avoid the nukes by moving out of range. This was the case.<P>So I can only conclude that with these changes, NPC casters are now also limited to range - move out of it, and they will NOT hit you.<P>------------------<BR>- Kaysha Soulsinger<BR>Templar in the 55th Circle of Erollisi Marr on Lanys T'Vyl<BR><I>The road to Heaven is paved with stones from Hell</I></FONT></TD></TR></TABLE>
