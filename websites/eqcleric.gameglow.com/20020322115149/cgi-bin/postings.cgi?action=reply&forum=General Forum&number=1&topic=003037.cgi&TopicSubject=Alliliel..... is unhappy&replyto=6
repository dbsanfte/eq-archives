[B]The fashion doesn't even play into this at all.

My only point is that I think I should be wearing all my EM for some reason, even though they are not the optimal items. Now once anyone has a full suit, it's fine to wear it all, but when you only have a few parts, it's hard to make these choices.

Oh, and even if your wis is over 200 and AC over 800, it's still not all about fashion, IMO. I want the highest AC I can get, with the most resistances I can get, with as close to 200 wisdom as I can get. Personally, I would not wear a suit of 200 wis/800 ac that looked better than 200 wis/840 ac.

Hell I had two pairs for awhile.  Never wore them.  Simply could not give up the 9 wis on the efreeti boots.  Had a prismatic shield for awhile too.  Didn't use that hardly at all.  Got a bracer that hung around for a bit.  Didn't wear that either.  I got real lucky one night in Hate and got arms AND legs ... well, the legs took care of the 9 wis problem on the efreeti boots, so I switched to purple legs, feet and arms ... didn't want to lose the 5 wis on a bracer though, so still didn't wear the 1 bracer I had.  Got another bracer ... didn't wear it.  Ahh, got my BP, well that takes care of the 10 wis from the bracers so, off came the reverents.  All I need are gloves which I will wear regardless of AC loss ... I need the dex lol.  And I look just silly with gold hands and purple the rest of me.<P>/shrug<P>Don't worry about wearing the EM for now until you want to.  When I didn't enter a random, people just asked why I didn't and I said I already had.  No one gave me any trouble over it, so I wouldn't worry.  People will remember your name more than your armor.<P>Oh, and about only saying you want in on the legs/bp etc.  On Tunare, BP is seniority usually - at least on most raids - or its last two items are automatically granted.  If more than one person needs an item as last two, they roll for it.  If seniority cannot be established, then all who need roll for it.<P>Elessara Ard'Hielle<BR>Cleric of Tunare<BR>Tunare server<p>[This message has been edited by Elessara (edited 05-30-2000).]</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#f7f7f7"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Alliliel</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Elessara said-<P>"On Tunare, BP is seniority usually - at least on most raids - or its last two items are automatically granted.
