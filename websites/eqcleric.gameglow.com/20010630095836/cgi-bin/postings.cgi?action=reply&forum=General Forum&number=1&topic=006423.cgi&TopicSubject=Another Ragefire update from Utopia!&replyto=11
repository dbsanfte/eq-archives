[B]On the pearl thing, read a few posts down in that thread I linked above, it's all explained there, and this will not be an issue at all in a few weeks.

Anyway who knows, perhaps people are correct. Maybe FCFS is inevitable, though I do not think so. OR, at least that day is a long, long way coming. There are basically four "uber-guilds" on Luclin who would each individually be able to ruin the list easily. All four have clerics on the list spread pretty evenly up and down the list. 

The most encouraging sign though, even though I mentioned there was a "strong showing" from two of these guilds to help for RF recently, *all four* of these guilds did have some members among the 54 in solb who massively overkilled Rage for a cleric that belonged to none of them. ; )

Figured some may be interested in an update from Luclin. As many may know, some servers are completely FFA on Ragefire, others have some form of nice arrangements, but the Luclin server is the only server in Everquest with a 100% respected Ragefire Rotation List. Our list has now turned about four months old, and the original creator of the list has retired from that task, which has now fallen to me. : )<P>Link: <A HREF="http://pub6.ezboard.com/fluclin71335dragonsandtheplanes.showMessage?topicID=791.topic" TARGET=_blank>http://pub6.ezboard.com/fluclin71335dragonsandtheplanes.showMessage?topicID=791.topic</A> <P>Tonight another Ragefire popped, and another cleric from a smaller guild, who would normally be sol on other servers, got her epic. : ) It truely was a neat little sight to see. This particular cleric was pretty well-known and well-liked. Her Ragefire popped, but it was kinda late at night. No biggie, we had a horde of over 54 people descend upon solb within a half hour or so for one simple pure motive, to help out the cleric on top. In attendance was a pretty strong showing from 2 of Luclin's four "uber-guilds", none of which the cleric on top belonged to. (Including mine, which had just finished off Trak for the 2nd time in two nights.)<P>It's gotten pretty nice now, where on other servers Ragefire has become a point of intense conflict, on Luclin, when Ragefire spawns, it is a social event, an opportunity to see lots of friends from other guilds, and meet others you may have barely heard about. All gathering from camps all around, maybe sick of LFG in seb to chat and joke around for a half hour, untill enough people show up all across guild lines for a massive overkill on Ragefire. In four months, we have had no KSing, no cheating, and no Ragefires lost. (well, except for one time when naggy killed Rage off :P)<p>[This message has been edited by Cayleu (edited 06-01-2001).]</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#f7f7f7"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Corynthia</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">This is beautiful to hear  <IMG SRC="http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/smile.gif"><BR>wish that all the other servers would do that also.<BR>oh my...<BR>well its nice to have a dream<P>------------------<BR>Corynthia-Dominion of Unity<BR>53rd Level Dwarven Vicar<BR>Bristlebane</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#dedfdf"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Auelan</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">I'm glad to hear things are still going well there.

Any time you bring up KSing, or training, or such, they come back with that.<P>Then I read the best story ever.<P>Apparently a light and dark guild showed up for Ragefire.  The dark guild was first, but didn't have the force to take it.  The light guild wanted to go, and a petition went in.  The GM told the lights to let the darks go first, then they could take it when they failed.<P>So the darks assault it and fail.  They regroup and rez while the lights buff and charge.  When they have Ragefire almost dead, they get reports of the darks attacking them from the rear.  Fighting on both fronts, the lights fall, and with virtually all of them dead, the darks have their cleric loot Ragefire and they leave.<P>In all honesty, it sounds like a great adventure, but I can see how everyone involved didn't take it as the epic tale it sounds like.</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#f7f7f7"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Cyricc S</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Wow, I had no idea our system was viewed this way.
