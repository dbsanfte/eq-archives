<TEXTAREA NAME="ReplyMessage" ROWS=10 COLS=45 WRAP="VIRTUAL">[QUOTE]Originally posted by Rayne:
[B]Hey Skrim,

Congrats on your Epic =).

Again, my goal in my front page post was to hopefully inject some reality into this spawn and hopefully avoid some hurt feelings for Clerics.  You know, the posts by Cleric01 who complains that "their Ragefire" was stolen.

The most consistent ruling on this issue by Verant seems to be that the person who turns in the pearl gets the spawn.  Killing the FGs is beyond trivial, the spawn is not tied to them, and is really pretty irrelevant to Ragefire, other than being in the way.  Furthermore, by attempting to tie the clearing of FGs to the Ragefire spawn you're (well, many others feel this way also) trying to create ownership that is just not enforceable.  Verant has repeatedly shown in the past that they do not care who has cleared the FGs.  They do care who turns in the pearl first as that is basically "engagement" for this particular spawn.

So by suggesting that the only valid method of camping is to have the forces on hand at that time I have attempted to eliminated numerous problems over the spawn.  So what if uber-guild We Roxx0r U is mobilizing?  You're already fighting.  So what if there was a FD Monk?  You're ready immediately.  Any other method of handling it becomes a negotiation where there really isn't much available to negotiate over.  One just basically has to hope that the latecomer is feeling generous.

Some people have called my post a "might makes right" scenario.  Nah, that's not it.  Instead, I prefer to call it a "might makes it safe" scenario.  If I have the might there, I am safe from all would be kill stealers (yes, I'm ignoring two or more strong groups sitting there, do a /random or something).  I won't have to depend upon the kindness of other people who want the item as badly as myself.  In game terms they are certainly just as deserving.

Furthermore, I'm not suggesting that there be a mad rush to mobilize for Ragefire when he spawns.  I'm suggesting being totally ready to avoid the mad rush.  Yes, I certainly understand that having a group of people sitting there is boring for all.  Ok, so don't have them sit there.  Just don't piss and moan that someone else came and "stole your mob."  It wasn't your mob because you didn't engage.

You suggest that 5 minutes is too short, 4 hours too long, and 20-30 minutes is "just right."  I guarantee you that if 30 minutes becomes the rule, some Clerics will go for 40 when the moment of truth arrives. Others will get screwed because someone else decided 15 minutes was plenty and they were ready now.  It's not enforceable at all, so why even bring it into the equation?

Are you familiar with the Lodizal spawn?  He's on a roughly 24 hour timer (it's variable, not sure how variable).  He drops the shells necessary for the shield and also a map part for one of the best face pieces in the game.  The "rule" on him is first engaged owns the spawn until one or the other is dead.  People sit out there looking for him, but if they don't engage quickly (within seconds) are they entitled to the spawn?  Of course not, he who engages first gets it.  How is this spawn different?  Because it's for the Cleric epic and not the Eyepatch of Plunder or the Lodizal Shell Shield?  Bah, I just don't buy that.

Skrim, I'm pretty damned familiar with how things worked on Karana.  I'm also familiar with how it works on A-Ro, a definite FFA server.  Any arrangements that can be worked out on a server wide basis are great.  I'd far prefer some kind of rotation or list for dealing with these mobs.  It makes life a lot smoother.  But lists are mostly to the benefit of the little guy, not the big guy.  And since they aren't enforceable, I don't see a lot of point in suggesting them.  As I see reality it's first there with the force, so I strongly suggest people have the force.  Because if they did, there would be a lot less strife over this spawn.

Rayne

PS.  I wanted to add that everyone is naturally free to handle this situation however they see fit.  My opinions mean nothing.  I do think I am correct though in stating what the baseline for this camp is.  Anything less becomes a gamble.
