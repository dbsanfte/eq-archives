<TEXTAREA NAME="EditedMessage" ROWS=10 COLS=45 WRAP="VIRTUAL">No, I don't think Abashi should be fired.  The problem isn't Abashi, it is VI and their views on CS as a whole and also testing as a whole.  I'll speak from three perspectives here:  programmer (my job), Test server resident (play), and as a former guide.  Abashi is only the tip of the iceberg of VI problems.  

The guide program functions EXACTLY the same way as the "whineplay" boards.  Guides that do not toe the party line and post negative comments on guide boards are severly censored or even fired.  I left the program after feeling the frustration of this as one member after another on my guide server quit or were fired.  A server that had no Senior guide for over 3 months.  Abashi was a part of that culture and helped create it.  Guides brought up many legitimate concerns last summer.  After being told to be quiet or things were working as intended, the program was eventually revamped.

Fast forward to the future and the entry of Abashi to the "whineplay" boards.  The same mentality is there.  We are told it works as intented, there isn't a problem, etc.  Then months later, changes are made.

All these things are simply the cultural view of life from the VI mountaintop.  Phrases like "The Vision" and "Your in our world now" says a LOT about how VI views itself and its customers.  It automatically creates and "Us" versus "Them" mentality for both parties.  This permeates all the way down to the coding and testing level, I would argue.  On a place like Test server, very few people are actually "testing" as you would normally test things wrt software.  Maybe a dozen or two tops.  The rest of the population is largely ignored or penalized by VI's record keeping and shoddy testing methods and shoddy backup methods (hence the i-wipe at the end of the Kunark beta and probably another i-wipe at the end of Velious testing).  I can tell you this, every single bug or anomoly that I have encountered and reported over a year of playing there has went live.  Every last single one.  Not a single exception.

A lot of this has to do with growth, I really believe.  A lot of companies that are not mature go through this.  VI is a GREAT company for putting out a game and one of the worst for supporting it.  You have VI, 989 studios, Sony, the semi-independent guide program all located in different locations, multiple chains of command and multiple visions about what is important for successful gaming.  All of this leads to the problems that we now have.

The bottom line, for me, isn't Abashi, it is VI in general and their attitudes.  Yes, Abashi could take a lesson in customer service and how to interact with people better.  But replacing will not change one single thing about how VI itself operates.  Therein is the problem.</TEXTAREA>
