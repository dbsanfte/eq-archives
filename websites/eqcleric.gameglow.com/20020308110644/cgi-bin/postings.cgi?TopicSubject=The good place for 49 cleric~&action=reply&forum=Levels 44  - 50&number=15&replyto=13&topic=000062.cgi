It was really good exp for us compared to everything else that's available.  The reason why 49 sucks for exp in groups is because the puller who pulls may be a lower level and pulls light blues.  So just make sure that you have a higher level puller or you can always just partner up with somebody.  The magician's level 49 pet can rip through a lot of the mobs in that zone apart. <BR> <BR>If I had the opportunity, I would love to level in dungeons.  But now it seems like everytime I go to a dungeon with pick up groups I don't find one or it's extremely crowded.  It's probably because now with the AA exp all the level 60s are starting to come back to dungeons that they left a long time ago.  I tried Velks it was almost impossible to find a group so me and my mage husband started duoing there but we either didn't find any mob to pull at all or get trained by some people pulling through us.  That zone was packed with people.  I also tried SolB, all the beetles, bats, and LDCs were constantly camped.<P>Depending on how crowded places are on your server, it may be better for you to still level in the DL but just find the right people to group with.        <P>[This message has been edited by Rosieana (edited 01-18-2002).]<p>[This message has been edited by Rosieana (edited 01-18-2002).]</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#f7f7f7"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Azngurl2002</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Lguk could still be really good experience at your level, depending on the camp you're in.

You're also getting into lvl range for OS and Chardok, which are a lot of fun. SF or CS with a partner is good too, exp and spell drops. A 58 necro in my guild has taken bunches of high 40's and low 50's to fear kite the entrance of Akheva, though without him it might have been much harder, the mobs all conned at least blue to me at 51 and seeing yellows wasn't as uncommon as it is in most places. Grieg's end is also a lot of fun, but again, might be a bit over your head unless you have a few higher friends. I love the vampire fort in Tenebrous mts too, just make sure you have a tank, a chanter, a good puller, and you're willing to use peridots, the tank will need all the hp he can get with vamps proccing a 200hp dd.<BR></FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#dedfdf"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">NightGod</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Tanking is about the worst thing you can do against Vamps.
