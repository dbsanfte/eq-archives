It might be true for you, your guild and your raids but it isn't true for everyone.<P>I am a relativly successful cleric on Quellious, I am level 60, I have 17 alt points, full ToV, epic, etc etc. But I am not in a raiding guild.  I get to help out on a lot of big raids including AoW and the Creator (granted, loot free) but I also get to have a lot of fun adventuring with friends.<P>This means I get to expand what I do quite a bit.  With a bunch of casters in the Grey I nuke / fear / dot.  With a bunch of crazy casters doing AE, I group heal and AE blast.  I find myself using a wide variety of spells for different adventures.  While CH, Aego and Res are our best spells, I feel that post Luclin, my roles have expanded.  <P>There is a whole lot of utility to the cleric class now.<P>Last nigth I went to hunt Juggernaughts in Sebilis with my three day old focus items (getting embarassing being killed in G Fay all the time).  I was casting more Divine Lights, Celestial Elixirs and Judgements than Chs or Remedies.  The focus items effected these spells giving me faster casting times for everything but remedy and CH, possible reagent saving on group aego (though I didn't see it =( ), and increased blast damage up to 1100.  For once, my actions decided whether or not our group got experience.<P>All in all, I think the focus items are a big bonus without being too overpowering.  I look forward to seeing them on fixed items soon.</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#dedfdf"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Tarf02</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">So Gorian.... you know full well it isn't true?

Until focus items, mages summons have been a joke - "ah, pardon me mr. mage, I just can't live without one of your no rent swords with the crappy stats pls".
