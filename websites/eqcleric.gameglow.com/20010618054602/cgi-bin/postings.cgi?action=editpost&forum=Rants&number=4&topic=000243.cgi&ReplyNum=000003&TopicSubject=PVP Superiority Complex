<TEXTAREA NAME="EditedMessage" ROWS=10 COLS=45 WRAP="VIRTUAL">"Just because you can "survive against intelligent opponents" doesnt make you any better."

Yes it does.  You will have to explain how that doesn't make someone a better EQ player.

I'm the best chess player in the world.  I've never faced a human opponent, but I beat my computer chess game every time.

It's really not a different world.  It's the same world, except we can and do kill each other.  To survive and prosper in such worlds means these players are indeed "better" at PvP than you.

No, they are not better than you, and I don't think that they try to come across as such.  However, they are better at PvP than you, and that shows in their personalities somewhat.

It really does make you a better EQ player if you can do all the things that anyone on a blue server can do, and you are excellent at PvP.  How can that not be the case?

The question then becomes... "Who cares?"  And that... IS a valid question.

To the guy who said, "You get ignored because no one cares if your awesome on Rallos."
Obviously not, or this post wouldn't exist, and your followup rant wouldn't either.

You do care.  In fact, you are disgusted.  Yet those PvPrs will continue to look at you from above because in general it is true that they are better at the game than you are.

In the same way that we used to look down on players who chose Necros and Druids (when they were extremely overpowered), because those people took the easy way to level 50, some of the most honorable and peaceful people on the PvP servers look down upon those players on the blue servers.

It's not a conscious effort or decision some have made to be proud of their accomplishments in a tougher world.  It's just a feeling that you get after having some success there.  You begin to believe that anything less is the easy way out.

Don't think for a second that we don't have fun on the Zeks.  Most of us would have quit EQ a long time ago, had the Zeks not been an option.  I would quit tomorrow if it were no longer fun.

I don't need to try to kill uber fungi monk.  That's not fun for me so I don't try.  And fungi monk is NOT going to ruin my day, like he will to someone who is unskilled/unwise.  After a few strafes, fungi monk knows he can't kill me.  And I know I can't kill him.  Mutual respect is formed, we bow and go our separate ways.

Such are the ways of the uber skilled PKr extraordinaire.
