<TEXTAREA NAME="ReplyMessage" ROWS=10 COLS=45 WRAP="VIRTUAL">[QUOTE]Originally posted by Lalu:
[B]As a Raid Cleric, you have to be aware of alot of game mechanics not just who do i heal in my group. Also who do you heal first vs who can wait for a heal. Also a side note for the first poster, IF you are just entering NTOV be aware of low health aggro. Once any Player gets to below about 30% health, not matter how much aggro your tank has it will turn on that person. 

Biggest piece a raid cleric can learn, especially when you do raids with less then one cleric per group is Assist Heal. Assist healing will help all your clerics sustain there mana better and speed up the raid in general.

In my opinion, there is a BIG difference between the two. <P>What would you all say are the biggest differences between the two roles?  Is it just about knowing how to do CH rotations?  I’m quite used to the XP group thing, but what differences should one expect when doing NToV for the first time for example?<BR></FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#f7f7f7"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">kendal THE cleric</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">in raid u have to CH in time for the rotation but not only.<BR>u also have to use "double assist" to find who got aggro and maybe save his ass.<BR>u also have to buff all the party,drag and rez many friends when **** happens.<P>i also make jokes about sexual orientation with pallys.</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#dedfdf"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Qwenya</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">I would say it can be summed up in two words:<P>Be aware.<P>In exp groups in Seb it is pretty boring, mindless run of the mill cleric stuff. <P>On a BGH, you have to be aware of where you are, where the melee box is, where is the edge of rampage, what is the debuff team doing, who is before and after you in chain and what are they doing, where do people needed to be clicked in safely, what buffs will fade when, who is dead, who has agro, what is the tank order, what kind of mob is being pulled (i.e., does it flurry, ae, etc), when is it best to cast GCH and when is it suicide, what cures do you need to have up and what can be cured by what and what needs to be dispelled and what just needs to wear off, what heal is the best one to use in any given situation, where are the pullers and have they FD successfully so you will not get pounded, who else is casting a heal and should you duck or them, when is Bestow DA best used, does the MT have solid agro, what is the DPS output of the mob being tanked to gauge heals, who lags a lot, where are key spells and how can I most efficiently swap them out, when should i hit DA/DB and when should I cast a Ch on a DA'd colleague, where are the rods and how best to time their use, what is your mana and hp bar saying, when camp is called what is the safe spot to try to camp, what curses and traps have to be negotiated and prepared for, what buffers are buffing what buffs and when are ae buffs done, and the list goes on.  A lot of little things that can make or break a raid.<P>The thing I find is the exp group cleric is used to being the only cleric and pretty much used to being in control of the camp as to directing things.  On a raid, there are a group of clerics with different personalities, play styles, temperaments, skills, opinions, etc.  The key is to know individual strengths and weaknesses to blend the healing team into a kick booty healing machine.<P>Qwenya<P>------------------<BR> <A HREF="http://www.clubfu.com/view_player.php?uid=44" TARGET=_blank>http://www.clubfu.com/view_player.php?uid=44</A></FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#f7f7f7"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Kero</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Qwenya, OMG!  <P>/panic<P>/em looks at her level, and decides it's perfectly nice here at 43.  <P>Nope, don't need to level, nevermind about raids, don't wanna do them.. nope.  <P> <IMG SRC="http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/biggrin.gif"></FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#dedfdf"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Seethur</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">If you are using ch rotations on mobs in ntov that is not the guild for you.

On all mobs that can kill a tank in less than 10 seconds, a CH rotation is more or less necessary.

I think being in a CH rotation takes as much situational awareness as anything else.  <P>I also think it is a good idea to practice CH rotations on easier mobs so everyone can get in the groove of doing this and you can build a strong corps of CH rotation clerics by seeing who is strong here and who is not.<P>I know some have been insulted when I started assigning specific healing duties.  But it was the most efficient way to make sure every base was covered and no time wasted on double efforts or the ball dropped on something, especially in the heat of the battle.<P>That old story comes to mind about Someone thought Anyone could do the job and it was true Everyone had the ability to do it but in end NoOne did.<P>Qwenya<P>------------------<BR> <A HREF="http://www.clubfu.com/view_player.php?uid=44" TARGET=_blank>http://www.clubfu.com/view_player.php?uid=44</A></FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#dedfdf"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">SleepyBhr</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">kendal THE cleric said "i also make jokes about sexual orientation with pallys."<P>Uh... any examples?  :)  Usually I get the brunt of them, but it just adds amusement for me in the more boring XP grining situations.<P>Sorry, having never been on a raid and being rather low level for them (39 now, who-ho!  complete heal!), I have little else to contribute.</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#f7f7f7"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Lalu</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">As a Raid Cleric, you have to be aware of alot of game mechanics not just who do i heal in my group.

In the event of cleric in one of the group dead (assuming 1 cleric per group), the job of healing the members of said group would somewhat fall on the other clerics when they are able to.<P>Normal exp group clerics would normally watch only people within their own group.
