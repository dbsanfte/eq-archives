My Druid and Cleric are all for balancing Risk vs Reward. Accordingly (/Sarcasm on), to keep with the intent of the original poster, we should remove the following spells.
All Rez type spells including Revive. This would eliminate the ability to instantly return to your corpse and also remove any chance to regain lost xp. (3 classes affected: cleric, paladin, necro)

All group gate spells, including Evacs. After all group gate spells would allow someone to return to their corpse quicker or with evacs avoid death thus eliminating the risk. (2 classes affected: Druid/Wizard)

All Summon corpse spells. If you die deep in a dungeon too bad, thats part of the risk. CRs should not be risk free. (2 classes affected: Necro/SK)

Also please remove all items that have these effects on them as they would now totally unbalance the game.

Please please make the game more balanced in this way. Then possibly my Cleric and Druid can play for 5 minutes without being asked to gate or rez someone.

Road_Kill,
Also why are you so concerned with changing the the game in a way that effects the level 50+ game? Considering you dont have the level to defeat a level 34-37 ranger type creature (Snow Griffin) states that you don't know the 50+ game. Which, to give you the reason they outrun your SOW is because when verant gives a class an ability (i.e. SOW for rangers at 39), all ranger based mobs at level 30+ will now have the ability to SOW themselves. To compound that, you've cancelled your EQ account already.

What are you possibly gaining here by making posts about something that 1. You know nothing about, and 2. Will not effect you in any way?

Uber_cleric01 - hey great post. I agree totally with what you're saying.
FYI Bards get slow-mob songs from level 21 and get more and better ones as time goes on - this is sometimes coupled with snare-type songs and is not noticable unless you're looking for it. Some of them are AE slows.

I'm just going to add the fact that although total mana (size of the mana pool) may not have changed significantly, mana regen rate (which is more important in most cases than max mana) HAS gone up considerably - although you need a bard (Canata) or an enchanter (CII) to fully take this into account. And when I say more important I'm talking about xp camps as opposed to raids. In the raid situation max mana becomes very important.

Uber_cleric01 said:------------
I'm very content on paying a fellow player wages for using his teleport services. What you are doing is justifying giving rez out because you didnt have to "Lose that stupid experence all the time", at the same time, waiting to give porting out so you dont have to "Take that stupid boat all the time". At least, thats what I'm gathering here. I feel the day clerics get to port / sow, or the like, I feel EQ will have hit the rock bottom. Same thing if a 4th class gets to rez... then a 5th.
-----------------------

About taking the boat - I play on test server - we don't charge for rezzes, ports or buffs for the vast majority of cases. I tend to give clerics stacks of peridots because plat is only good for buying tink bags and buying jewlery components(I know people with 6 or more tink bags on test). People are very generous with their time on test, and I thank them for it every day. However, that also means that there are times when there are no porters available, and I have to take the boat. Nothing is worse (more boring) than wasting 45 minutes to sit on the boat from bucher to freeport. What a waste of time. What bad game design. 

I guess I AM saying that I think that the death penalty is too severe without res, and that there's not enough ressers to go around. Same with porting. It puts a lot of power into the hands of few people, and makes them essential. I think the game would be better is no-one were essential, and there were more options available.

I'm not "blaming" clerics or anyone for that matter. It's not about blame - it's about balance. I'd like to see a more balanced game. I'd like to see EQ2 come out balanced instead of the massively unbalanced system that we now have. I seriously doubt that EQ as we know it now is going to be seriously revamped by the removal of CH and the distribution/removal of rez and the associated reduction in the death penalty. I just feel that it's something that should be pointed out and discussed.

You want to see proof of risk vs reward? Take all the groups in all the 50+ dungeons. What percentage of those groups have no cleric? Speaking from my own experience from 50 to 59 as a warrior, it is less than 5%. What percent have no shaman? Roughly 80%. What percent have no druid? More than half, I'd guess about 70%. 
There's a reason people refuse to do anything without clerics at higher levels yet make do very consistently without druids and shamans. It's because even the world's most incompetent cleric can manage risk and reward for their groups better than the world's most skillful druid or shaman at higher levels. 

With enchanters, it's a little different, many more exceptions and special cases but essentially the same. Groups without enchanters in the 50+ world are far more rare than groups without any other int caster, again because their ability to mitigate damage input and magnify damage output leaves the other classes far, far behind.

You want to move past the level of reward of foreman's tunics and gauntlets of the black and play a support caster? Fine, you better play a cleric or an enchanter. But don't just take my word for it. Take the word of all the groups out there shouting to the zone or guildchat that they need a cleric or enchanter to finish their group.

a_yew_tree00,
Please describe in the basis of your last post, what you propose be done to solve this problem. If you say remove CH and tune down mobs, you know, and I know, and everyone else knows thats not going to happen. Mobs in velious would need to be reduced to over 80 percent of their power. Summoning would need to stop. Rampages/Going Enraged would need to end. Now, look at me in the eye and tell me with a straight face "Verant will do that.". Last time people such as yourself proposed that, they buffed the planes, and they buffed the ubermobs.

Road kill. Maybe your the type of person that grovels to anyone for anything, but thats not my problem... I don't make anyone grovel for rezzes. I freely give rezzes out. Not everytime any person asks me, I'll not leave my group in Seb to rez someone in GD. But if its at all convienient for me to do it I will, yes even going slightly out of my way (even greatly out of my way if I'm just hanging around) to help someone out. 
The fault for this is soley on Verants shoulders for making the death penalty so severe, don't blame the players, that just makes you look like a moron. Without exp restoring rez the high level game would simply be unbearable. I would be willing to bet a lot of money that you have absolutely no clue how bad it is. I die 4 or 5 times a night sometimes in raids. I would be rapidly de-leveling at that rate without the 56 rez. And those are successful raids, raids that we (my guild) succeed at our goal of taking down uber_mob_01. Things happen and people die. You take away the exp rez and the entire high level game WILL come to a grinding halt. Verant is already massively despised, they follow your advice they would become the laughing stock of the industry. I'm sure you don't believe me, I'm equally sure you don't have a clue though so thats ok.

hehe Good point Uber_Cleric. Hmmm, case in point. 
"we know that several encounters were designed with the Donals Breastplate effect in mind, therefore when we reduce the effectivenss of Donals, we will evaluate and reduce the power of these 5 or so encounters accordingly."
Fast forward to a few months after the Donals BP nerf... Whats happened? Dain was buffed, Yelniak was buffed, Velketor was buffed, the planes are all buffed. Yea. You go right ahead and trust Verant to nerf the clerics power again and then follow up with lowering the power of their precious mobs.
I tell you what, you want to get rid of the power of rez? Get Verant to remove the death penalty. Then Rez will be nothing more than a summon to corpse spell and all that power *laf* will be gone. And most clerics would be happy with that, because we suffer from that same death penalty. Of course people like Evil_chu and Road kill still won't be happy, because there will always be something else they can find to complain about. These two just enjoy poking the stick in the ant hill.

I have never posted here before, but after reading the entire thread I felt I ought to. I play a mid 50's Cleric and I love the class. Sure, increased heal aggro and donal's nerfs were frustrating, but I got over it. I rarely have trouble finding a group, because of my buffing/healing abilities. Rezzes are indeed a bonus, but when in a post hell lvl, dying even with lvl 49 Rez still leaves a chunk of xp lost that you have to regain. 
To be told that clerics are overpowered is absurd. I don't think, after all the raids and groups I've been in, that any one class was the most important. Rezzes/heals are a clerics forte', so-to-speak, similar to warrior tanking, necro dot'ing, shaman slowing/buffing, chanter mezzing, wizzie DDing, etc. On plane raids etc., every class is represented, every class is treated equally and every class tries to have fun. Not having Rez would indeed make plane raids impossible. I watch lvl 60 characters die within 5 seconds of entry to a plane. When that character is bound in fironia vie and the meeting place is sro, guess what, rez is indeed needed. 

Whoever posted that clerics are not overpowered because 2 other classes get rez, but just at later levels, deserves candy.  Every class has a defining trait, and though maybe my server is different from others, but the groups I'm in rarely turn down one class for another. 

Roadkill, there is much you need to learn. The only times I ever turn down a rez to someone is because I am either logging off, going AFK, or in the middle of doing a rez. I have many times left my group to go rez someone out of kindness. I don't expect a reward. When ppl try to give me reward, I hit 'cancel' in the trade window, /hug them, and run back to the group. If you are upset that your class does not have rez, then make a cleric, because Rez and heals are what we do. If I did not want to heal/rez, I would play another class. If I were upset that I did not have backstab, then I'd make a rogue. 

All I can really say is.. ***.  If you have rez removed, you no longer have a balanced game. The risk would be so high that there'd be no reason to play. I am sorry you are unhappy with the class you are playing at the moment, but to try to ruin a class by trolling this board in order to make yours better is unreasonable. Play a different class if you want the benefits of their abilities. 

PS: Never have I ever seen any cleric (and I speak to alot of them, trust me) boycott rezzes or create a list for 'do not rez' as you've suggested. I still rez ppl that have really angered me, b/c you never know when I will need a favor returned one day. It's nice to know that I can offer someone assistance, and perhaps call on them one day when I need a port, a lev ring, help with a camp that I cannot maintain, etc.

After 2 large nerfs and 90% death rate for my character increasing, it is nice to know that I still have some qualities to my class that makes it unique from others. To call it overpowered is simply rediculous though. We cannot defend ourselves one bit. Melee stops at lvl 25+ or so, and nukes are laughable, but that's because we are NOT a damage dealing group  So... I rely on heals/rez, and company of friends. 

Get used to these facts Evilchu and Roadkill. 3 classes share Rezzes just like multiple classes share other abilities. Just because your specific class does not have one of our abilities does not make us better or overpowered. All it seems to have done is make you upset, and therefore try to ruin it for others  Let us know when you hit 51 +, then you may have valid arguments. Until then, you are simply jealous fools trying to troll the board  And yes, if you were on my server, and you asked for a rez, you'd get one, for free, anytime. You could ask a pally or necro too though... oh well. buhbye

What really bugs people is that the post 50 game is designed with the expectation that every player has made friends with a character that can resurrect, so the death penalty is huge, and the chance of dying is huge. If there was no resurrection, they would not have made such a huge death penalty, and would not have made the chance of dying so huge. At least that is the impression I get from those trying to make the point that the problem is with the spell, not the rest of the game.
However, I suspect that verant wanted the death penalty to be huge, and the chance of dying as well, and therefore created resurrection as a potential balance to the increase in risk. I believe that it is really the game that was designed to make resurrection necessary, not the spell that made the risks great.

That said, resurrection is huge compared to other spells. A handy teleport can save you a few hours played getting from Sebilis to the Hole. A handy resurrection can save you a few days played of lost exp. It is a huge boon compared to anything else in the game, and it is concentrated into a tiny set of hands. It is definitely out of balance.

There is probably no way to fix it.

Your point also follows summon corpse exactly, except the fact it can only be done by 2 classes, not 3 like rez.

How do you propose getting 40 corpses from innoruuks feet back to safety?

Don't bother Cleric. After these guys are happy getting rid of rez they would eagerly set into summon corpse next. 
I figure these guys are probably druids, they want their class to be the most uber in the game, and to ensure that they need to get rid of every ability that they don't have.
Want to really piss them off? Point out that so much of what they say about rezzes applies to ports as well. Oh wait, you've already done that and the get pissed and come up with excuses why thats not true. NM then.

Keldain,
Best I can tell:

Road_Kill was a druid, but has since cancelled his account since a snow griffon popped on him and attacked and "ran as fast as my sow" (A snow griffin is a 30+ ranger mob).

I will never understand why clerics are perceived too powerful based on our ability to get into a group. We have no way to defend ourselves really (except root (maybe atone) and run). We suck for traveling - We have no invis to protect us except to undead, which in traveling zones is not too common, we can't port, we can't sow, we pretty much just have to run at standard speed from point A to point B and hope we dont get agroed. Our nukes are sickly mana inefficient, but I never use them anyway. I can solo a barely blue or exp green, but only if I am full mana, and provided none of my spells fizzle or get resisted. Sometimes, clarity is a requirement. At level 55 and with exile undead, I still cannot solo a wraithbone champion. I can't use any slashing weapons at all, not even 1HS - I just get this little blunting weapon to use, and if I'm lucky, I'll hit for 1 maybe 2 dmg. But, ignoring all that - because I happen to be one of the best group-friendly classes, I'm too powerful.

Thats not right.

No one is going to be satisfied until the cleric basically becomes a lousy fighter with a +11 ac buff. What is frightening is that Absor takes all these seriously and believes inherently in them. 
Of course, you can't really be surprised at this from the guy that claims its fun to be a victim.

Complete heal is broken, when you consider that no other class has a spell as relatively powerful. No other class even comes close.
The rez line is vastly over powering. Lets face it at level 54 a rez is the difference between losing 70 hours or not losing 70 hours of played time, that is vastly over powered. 
Those are facts. 
Dont worry Clerics Verant has so little understanding of the power of the Cleric that they will continue to focus on Necromancers and PUNISH them because of they are over powered. That thought tickles me. 

I wonder what the game would have turned out like if Gordon had played a Cleric to 50, rather than a Necromancer? It would have been much different, would it not?

Uber-C: FYI Road_kill is a fairly high-level enchanter, and one of the best I have seen play at that level. He has also spent a great deal of time designing multiplayer games, both the paper and electronic variety. Because he enjoys flaming people he loses some credibility but you might want to ignore the stupidity and focus on his main points.
Corpse recovery via summon corpse - yes it can be an incredible time saver and sometimes the only way to do things. It's not nearly so common as ressing. And frankly, if you had to you couldget your corpses back the hard way. Get your secondary gear out of the bank, and kill Inny. Or maybe have some people fight him naked and train him away from the corpses while others run in and batch drag them. Or get another uber-guild involved to help you out. Your corpses will be there for many days, I'm sure you can sacrifice the experience lost to get your gear back. 

Oh wait - maybe you don't want to wait that long because you'll lose your rez.

Complete heal is not broken. The mobs are. For mobs that can quad 500, 600, or like velketor 850-900 per round of attack, or the sleeper that can quad for 1250, I would like you, or anyone else (I've asked this question about 3 times) to tell me what we are supposted to do. How's complete heal broken when you have mobs like this?

---------------------------------

It is also a fact that at level 54, you would rather take the exp loss, rather than forever losing your corpse, or am I incorrect here? I have over 50 days of play time at the moment getting to where I am with my equipment. I play on Thlouxe Paells, which started as a non-twink server. I started at 10:15 PM on September 28th 2000, the evening the server opened. When I logged on, the highest (non-anon) person on the whole server was level 6. I have busted my tail to level 55, I have some very nice equipment (Donals Helm/Arms/Boots, Belt of Cenobyte, Medicine Totem, Paw of Opalla, etc). The time it would take to recover all of this would be staggering. The Paw of Opalla took me over 30 hours in and of itself. If I lost my corpse, I would forever leave EQ, its that simple. I have invested so much time getting my equipment to the point of what it is today, it would be the game ender for me.

Which scenerio would you take? Which one has a bigger impact on Risk vs. Reward? I'd rather lost 2-3 days than my entire EQ life, thanks.

Ok. I have a solution for you people, and I want you to take this seriously. From now on, never, ever ever accept a rez again. Never ask for one, click decline each time some ******* cleric tries to rez you. Now, go play the high end game, get up to lvl 55 at least (hehe, good luck without a rez, but it can be done.) Go with a big guild to Velketors, Kael, Dragon Nec. Go on these raids daily like I do. Watch in HORROR as you go from 55, to 54, to 53. Remember how long it took you to get from 53 to 55? You just lost all that. Congratulations on being stupid and envious.

uber_cleric01,
Excellent points. 
1) Give a spell that heals almost as well ( compared to complete heal)to Shaman and Druids. I know that hurts, but Clerics are too damn required.

2) Give Paladins the rez line nine levels later than Clerics. I know that hurts, but Clerics are too damn required. 

I dont want these things taken away from Clerics I want more classes to be balanced relatively to Clerics.

If you say remove CH and tune down mobs, you know, and I know, and everyone else knows thats not going to happen. Mobs in velious would need to be reduced to over 80 percent of their power. Summoning would need to stop. Rampages/Going Enraged would need to end. Now, look at me in the eye and tell me with a straight face "Verant will do that.". Last time people such as yourself proposed that, they buffed the planes, and they buffed the ubermobs."
Okay, we're going to be talking about three different things.

1) What I propose:

I would have to spend a lot of time thinking about a good solution, and I'm not going to think through every little possibility and ramification since Verant isn't consulting my opinion anyhow, however one very obvious solution comes to mind. Reduce the current death penalty by 96%, remove the entire ressurection line except for revive. Ressurection will function more like an variation of COTH and still have powerful value in risk vs reward, but without quite the degree of insanity that it is now. 

Regarding CH, there are several possible solutions. The solution that makes the most sense is to extend the normal healing line for all healers, improving the mana ratio appropriately. The efficiency of power of all direct heals except CH hasn't kept up with the inflation of mob damage output. However, CH used to be a very special situation heal, or an after battle heal (the original intent), now at the higher levels the only mana efficient way to deal with large amounts of incoming damage is to channel it all onto a mega-hp tank and CH the whole pool. Risk is infinitely greater with a druid or shaman healing because the heals are comparitively small, certainly mana inefficient, and if they draw aggro, they probably won't survive the beating without the divine aura series anyway, which is another can of worms entirely.

2) What Verant will actually do

Verant has a checkered history with regards to their actions. Sometimes they do exactly what the playerbase asks for. Sometimes they ignore the playerbase. Sometimes they address our concerns in weird ways that don't make sense. As I do not have a real two-way communication with Verant, I don't concern myself too much with their decision making process. Verant is Verant, they'll do whatever they do, and we simply accept it or find another game to play. They must be doing rather well, there's over 300,000 of us still here.

3) What I actually want to see

Personally, I'm selfish. Let's keep the status quo. The system is horribly unbalanced, but as a warrior, the current overdependency on clerics and enchanters works in my favor most of the time. I've geared my gameplay to account for that overdependency, and any change would probably work against me. However, having said that and looking at the big picture, I know that it's not right to have things so unbalanced, and EvilChu is essentially correct that Clerics (and I'm adding enchanters) are unbalanced by Aradune's own definition, so long as you are willing to accept the fact the ability to reduce risk or increase reward is the metric of power.

Uber-C: FYI Road_kill is a fairly high-level enchanter, and one of the best I have seen play at that level.
---------------------
Then I assume he plays on the test server? Well unless he was lying, hes since cancelled his account, and him posting here does nothing for him, or us, or this game at all.

---------------------
He has also spent a great deal of time designing multiplayer games, both the paper and electronic variety.
---------------------

Given the complete lack of any reasonable thinking in his posts (I'm still waiting on him to explain to me how we can heal someone when a mob quading for 600dmg engraging, summoning, and rampaging without complete heal), and the continuation of any "adult" debate in his posts (boo hoo, little boy, etc do little to give his posts credit, and more like hes 13 years old), I have a hard time believing hes a game designer.

---------------------
Because he enjoys flaming people he loses some credibility but you might want to ignore the stupidity and focus on his main points.
---------------------

Posts from anyone that are full of flames and don't allow any subjective responses to his posts don't deserve my, or anyone elses time. For example, there is *NOTHING* me, you, or anyone else out there can say that would make Road_Kill say "You know, thats a good point, I see now why CH and Rez are in the game". Therefore - why bother?

------------------
Corpse recovery via summon corpse - yes it can be an incredible time saver and sometimes the only way to do things.
------------------

The key words are "the only way to do things." A resurrection is NEVER the only way to do things. Its always a convient way.

------------------
It's not nearly so common as ressing. And frankly, if you had to you could get your corpses back the hard way.

Get your secondary gear out of the bank, and kill Inny. Or maybe have some people fight him naked and train him away from the corpses while others run in and batch drag them. Or get another uber-guild involved to help you out. Your corpses will be there for many days, I'm sure you can sacrifice the experience lost to get your gear back. 
------------------

Ports are more common than ressing. And no, you cannot get your corpses back the hard way. Explain to me how you propose to break back into hate with "secondary equipment" which about 80-90 percent of the people prolly have none of are going to go back and rebreak hate with no more deaths (remember, you can't resurrect) By the time you have *POSSIBLY* recovered your corpse, you will have taken at least 6-7 hours, lost at least one full level, spent thousands of pp on soulstones, bugged many wizards to port you up, and in the end of things you've had an experence that is not worth the original trip, and pretty much, hate will be forever empty. I would like for you to send a tell to an uber guild and ask them can you come clear hate for you, we need our corpses outta there. Their response: "Sorry, we're actually doing that exact thing in fear right now..." -- "Sorry, we're actually going to kill Trakanon so we can help these others out" -- "Sorry, if you can't handle that yourself, you shouldnt have gone into hate in the first place". Considering that so many people perceive the number 1 reason thats NOT fun in EQ is losing experence, I think that people wont sacrifice the exp to go there - they just won't go into hate in the first place.

-----------------------------
Oh wait - maybe you don't want to wait that long because you'll lose your rez.
-----------------------------

Think a minute. First off, my point was more about summon corpse, not "my precious rez" as you seem to want to imply. Second off, I'll CERTAINLY take how many deaths it takes to get my corpse back. But going into hate at level 54, and getting corpse and leaving being level 48, I seriously doubt this is a good alternative that will appeal to many people. If that happened to me, I would sell my account with gear as a level 48 cleric - I certainly will not spend days and days getting back to level 54.

My god Mcloud why don't you just play a GD cleric? If your so set on seeing every single ability the cleric has stripped, why not play one and see what it is like to be a cleric? Sure, give Shaman and Druids equivilant heals, you know what you get? No Cleric ever being invited into a raid group ever again because they can't contribute anything at all.
This is all just pure BS trash class envy. According to the TOS of this board this is against the rules. Of course Verant won't do the proper thing and pull the plug on this kind of trash though. Especially when its aimed at clerics. Make a thread about a druid ability though and watch it get yanked in under 20 minutes.

Keldain,
Woe! What I propose would not destroy Clerics. 
I didnt say equivalent, I said relative. 
Im not stripping Clerics I want to remove their strangle hold on the game, risk/reward and improving game play. 

This isnt about envy its about balance in an RPG. That means if you have a group that includes a healer, a melee character and a caster regardless of the specific classes involved, the same goals can be achieved. Sure the tactics may be different and the strategy maybe more difficult but the goal should be obtainable. 

The way it is now, why have all those classes, when everyone knows EQ ends up being about Clerics, Warriors and Enchanters? Facts are facts and the other healing classes need to be balanced relatively to Clerics.

------------------------------

After you have done the above, why would any group want a cleric? Protection of the glades is a more desired buff, resurrections are now a mute point, and the healing is not spread across multiple classes.

This is no different than me saying (for example) to remove Snare spells, dot spells, port spells, and SOW from druids. Why would anyone want them in their group?

The difference is a druid for example has many abilities that he can provide NOW to a group to suit them. Hes an Evacer, which is a wonderful R.v.R. saver. He can cast damage shields, and he can SOW. He can harmony without the fear of failure agroing the whole group, and hes a better battle healer than I am (His best battle heal is 68 more HP than my battle heal with a HP/Mana ratio difference of 0.1). Hes in a lot of ways a better buffer, because hes got self buffs and buffs for others that provide mana and HP regen, as well as many extra hitpoints. They don't even cost a component. He has a strength buff, and his dots are very mana efficient. His nukes, while not on-par with a wizard are very very nice. Califaction does a lot of damage for only a 2.5 second cast time! Thats very nice, even if its got a 45 second recast. I sure would like a 500 HP heal that casted in 2.5 seconds, even if it had a 45 second recast. He can effectively shrink ogres, since he can pretty much do these in wolf form, and some some dungeons are treated as outdoor zones (Karnors, City of Mist, etc), all these spells work just fine.

What can a cleric do? Heal, Resurrect (Which we hope we never even need to use), Buff (Which depending on the group is usually not wanted, since PotG is a much more asked for buff).

Please rethink your position. I'm not telling you you are flat out wrong, but if you do what you propose, I assure you that there will be VERY few clerics left.

I don't think that rez is the problem. Rather, it's the insane amount of xp required to level past 50. The post-50 game would virtually disappear if it wasn't for the availablity of an exp rez. I can't imagine anyone would bother leveling past 50 knowing that days or weeks of work could be wiped out in seconds. At best, people would hunt low blues indefinately and never participate in raid or boss encounters (which at the very least provide some relief from the increasingly tedious task of leveling). There just isn't enough going for the post 50 game to make leveling past 50 at all worthwhile without an exp rez available. Some might say that it's barely worthwhile as it stands. If they nerfed exp rez my character I would lay my 51 character to rest permanently, without question.

Ok. I have a solution for you people, and I want you to take this seriously. From now on, never, ever ever accept a rez again. Never ask for one, click decline each time some ******* cleric tries to rez you. Now, go play the high end game, get up to lvl 55 at least (hehe, good luck without a rez, but it can be done.) Go with a big guild to Velketors, Kael, Dragon Nec. Go on these raids daily like I do. Watch in HORROR as you go from 55, to 54, to 53. Remember how long it took you to get from 53 to 55? You just lost all that. Congratulations on being stupid and envious.
-----------------------
Are you even paying attention to what people are saying here? The anti-rez crowd are saying that rez is unbalanced BECAUSE it is SO USEFUL. If you wanted to eliminate it YOU WOULD REDUCE THE DEATH PENALTY. You would not JUST eliminate it - you would ALSO REDUCE THE DEATH PENALTY. Is that clear now?

--------------------------
Road_Kill and I both understand WHY CH and Rez are in the game, and why it's more-or-less necessary to keep them in the game as it stands now. The point is that the game would be (a) more fun and (b) more balanced if the dynamic engendered by both CH and Rez was removed from the game. Since I realize that there is no way Verant is going to re-scale all the SoV mobs, my solution is to give rez to more people - Road_Kill is taking a harder line.

and Uber-C said again:

Metrech: Corpse recovery via summon corpse - yes it can be an incredible time saver and sometimes the only way to do things.
------------------
The key words are "the only way to do things." A resurrection is NEVER the only way to do things. Its always a convient way.
------------------

The only thing I can think of where corpse summoning is the "only way to do things" is in the plane of sky when you want to get more than 24 people onto an island and there's only 24 keys.

And one more time:
----------------------
Ports are more common than ressing. And no, you cannot get your corpses back the hard way. Explain to me how you propose to break back into hate with "secondary equipment" which about 80-90 percent of the people prolly have none of are going to go back and rebreak hate with no more deaths (remember, you can't resurrect) 
----------------------
The hardliners would let revive stay in the game - just remove the XP res.

Continued:
By the time you have *POSSIBLY* recovered your corpse, you will have taken at least 6-7 hours, lost at least one full level, spent thousands of pp on soulstones, bugged many wizards to port you up, and in the end of things you've had an experence that is not worth the original trip, and pretty much, hate will be forever empty.

Considering that so many people perceive the number 1 reason thats NOT fun in EQ is losing experence, I think that people wont sacrifice the exp to go there - they just won't go into hate in the first place.
------------------------------
Of course, you're also assuming that there would be no reduction in the death penalty. We're arguing about apples and oranges here - assume you have revive and a low death penalty (say 4% of what it is now). Then make this same argument.

I was trying to counter your argument about losing all your gear - if necessary you can wait a day or two (or a week!) and play alternates until some other guild or raid goes to hate or wherever to get your corpse back. 

finally:
First off, my point was more about summon corpse, not "my precious rez" as you seem to want to imply. Second off, I'll CERTAINLY take how many deaths it takes to get my corpse back. But going into hate at level 54, and getting corpse and leaving being level 48, I seriously doubt this is a good alternative that will appeal to many people. If that happened to me, I would sell my account with gear as a level 48 cleric - I certainly will not spend days and days getting back to level 54.
------------------------------
See the point I made above about revive and low-xp-loss deaths. You wouldn't lose all those levels - just maybe a few days where you couldn't play your main character.

I think you and I don't disagree on much, Uber_C - I just think we're looking at this from different viewpoints. I'm trying to imagine a "perfect" or "ideal" game where rez (and CH) do not NEED to exist because the game is set up in such a way (lower hp/lower damage mobs say, low xp deaths) that they are not necessary. You appear to me to be arguing that CH and Rez are necesary as the game currently exists. Of course, you are right on that point. As the game now stands, you need CH and you need rez. 

Wouldn't it be nice if that weren't the case, and clerics weren't essential to any high-level group.

If paladins were to get the rez line nine levels later, rather than as it stands now, would that be that unbalancing for Clerics?
If Shaman and Druids got a 1200hp heal for 650 mana with a 5 second recast and cast time, would that be unbalancing for Clerics?

...In short, I think they should keep rez the way it is and make the xp required for leveling post-50 less. Paladins get Revive at 49 which makes them an alternative to Clerics for those situations where dungeon break-in is the issue. Dungeon break-in, in my experience, is more of an issue in the post-50 game than the pre-50 game anyway.

Metrech,
Of course it would be wonderful is Rez and CH were not needed, and the exp penalty was 4%, or even non existant.

It would also be wonderful if their were no boats, and that everyone ran as fast as SOW anyway. It would be cool if for the price of a standard druid port (20pp on TP) I could go to a vendor and buy a gate to BB, etc type potion. It would be really cool if pathing actually worked. It would be fantastic if kiting was made impossible. It would be sweet if Velketor only hit for 150 a shot, 1 MAYBE 2 rounds per attack with no special attacks.

Sounds to me (at least how your explaining this) is this is just a big "What If" thread. Nothing can be accomplished here for anyone.

------------------------------------
1. I cannot logoff without my corpse back. Its a mental thing .

2. I shouldn't have to depend on a "uber guild" to go raid something so I can tag along with 30 other people so I can get back my lost corpse. I shouldnt have to read their raiding schedule. Thats their business - not mine. If this was how hate was done, I would never go. The RvR is in the same area, but the opposite end of the spectrum than summon corpse is in the other end.

3. Have you ever lost your corpse on the last leg of Veeshans peak? What about falling from icewellkeep top and being pummeled from Frostycube and others to death, and not knowing where your corpse is? Do you think you are going to be able to get an uber guild to go into icewell, and go rooting around for your corpse cuz they are "nice guys"? What about being wiped out in Kael past the giants that see through invis? A amible faction person can't drag your corpse - because Kael is a zone where corpse dragging will cause them to agro on you.

Summon corpse is MUCH more of a RvR unbalancer, but no one is asking for that to be changed - I'm sure not. Given game dynamics, it SHOULD be there. Same with Rez. Verants not going to remove the death penalty, because 4 percent is such a minimal loss of experence, that there is so little risk for MOST encounters, that the reward is imbalanced with the risk. At that point, you'll be getting fine steel off level 57-60 mobs, and rusty weapons will drop from level 40s. The only good weapons will drop off balanced mobs based on their spawn time. So next time you want that ghoulbane, the shin lord may pop once a month - if your lucky.

-----------------------------------
Well, they get revive 20 levels after, and resurrection 10 levels after we do. Considering most of their spells are in line like this (i.e. Shield of words at 60, we get at 49), and some even greater (Superior Heal at 57, we get at 34), yes, I think this would be unbalancing. Also for the same reason other classes get their spells in relation to their parent class. Shadow Knights for example, tend to get a lot of their spells 10 to 20+ levels after necros do.

--------------------
If Shaman and Druids got a 1200hp heal for 650 mana with a 5 second recast and cast time, would that be unbalancing for Clerics?
--------------------
If clerics did not get a battle heal to compensate, yes. Complete heal is not a battle heal, and our best one, Divine Light (910 HP 350 Mana 2.6 HP per 1 Mana) is already beaten by a Druid's Natures Touch (978 HP 400 Mana 2.45 HP per 1 Mana).
