<TEXTAREA NAME="ReplyMessage" ROWS=10 COLS=45 WRAP="VIRTUAL">[QUOTE]Originally posted by Dikmer:
[B]Well, I bound myself next to the forge in Freeport, bought molds, ran to HK, bought the ore, made armor til I ran out of molds, then made MQ Sheet metal till I was full and gated back to where the molds could be bought.

So you really only have to run one way.

My problem now, is I am broke, and have 2 full sets of FP armor and cant seem to sell it. Had someone in GFay today who kinda pissed me off. I was asking 1500pp for a full (visual) set of BP, Helm, Arms, Gloves, Legs, Boots and 2 Bracers. I felt that was fair. 

She started complaining that she could buy dyed for 1500pp, so I dropped to 1250 (I need the cash to make more armor). THEN she startd asking where the "rest of the full set" is. I.E. she expected a visor, pauldron, cloak and belt to be included.

Quick math. 7.5pp per brick of MQ ore, 3 to make a MQ folded sheet. 22.5pp per sheet. Takes 25 sheets to make a "FULL" set. 562.5pp assuming NO fails. Molds average 15pp each (some higher, some lower), 12 molds total. 180pp. So, not counting pads, 750pp per set with ZERO fails. I have been getting 50-60% success, so my COST is 1300pp. And she expected me to sell at a loss. Her reasoning? "Thats the cost of being a smith". 

Why the heck would anyone become a smith if everyone expects you to sell at a loss.

I am half considering just selling FSPlate to vendors and hunting Hill Giants in Rathe Mountains to fund it.[/B][/QUOTE]

Or even better, Enchanted Imbued Dwarven Plate armor? It's the best thing right up to (and in some cases, better) Ethereal Mist from Hate. Got a couple thousand platinum and some time to invest? Well, here's how I did it:<P>Total cost to me was 900pp and I didn't sell a thing to another player. I have 190wis, 69int, 120str, 80ishcha.<P>First thing I did was went to Kaladim (North Freeport will also work). Now, admittedly, with 4 Tinkerer Bags, I could carry alot more than the average person, so I am sure it went faster for me than most people.<P>Went to the mine (next to bank) and filled my 4 bags with Small Bricks of Ore. 40 bricks. Ran up the hall towards the Cleric guild and stopped at the female dwarf at the end of the tunnel. Bought 2 stacks of water. Then ran the to the forge outside of Everhot Forge (notice, this is all in the same zone).<P>1 Small Brick of Ore + 1 water + file = Steel Bonings. <P>Did that to 41 skill. Using the SAME materials, I started making Sheet Metal.<P>1 Small Brick of Ore + 1 Small Brick of Ore + 1 water = Sheet Metal.<P>This trivials at 56. Now, the kicker. Since the bank is right next to the mine, grab yourself a few backpacks and toss the sheet metal into the bank. You'll use it later anyway.<P>Now, once I hit 56, I went to Freeport. East Freeport. Took my bags of Sheet Metal with me, and bought a bunch of Banded Gorget molds.<P>1 Sheet of Metal + 1 Banded Gorget mold + 1 water = a Banded Gorget.<P>This will get you all the way to 102. If you run out of Sheet Metal, well the vendor that sells the molds also sells the Sheet Metal. Total time for me was 3 hours, total cost about 250pp.<P>I then did Banded Boots. 1 sheet, 1 mold, 1 water. <BR>At 123 I switched to Belts. 2 sheets, 1 mold, 1 water. <P>At 135 I went to Mantles and Helms. 2 sheets, 1 mold, 1 water. <P>At 168 it is Cloaks all the way to 175. 2 sheets, 1 mold, 1 water.<P>Now, if you sell to players as you go, you make more of your money back, but I was in it to get to 175 asap. I did not want to invade the other lower level smiths market, so I sold my stuff to the vendor. I only actually lost money on the fails, as after gorgets, it seemed to me the items were selling for a silver or so more than the cost of the sheet metal + mold + water.<P>After 175 it got expensive and tedious. I'll write another guide on 175+ when I get around 200 skill. I blew about 2k making a bunch of Fine Steel (11 Bracers, 4 BP's and 3 Vambraces), and only gained 2 skill (to 177). The hardest part was killing spiderlings and animals to make the Leather Padding.

I had been working on smithing off and on prior to the patch.  The day the patch came out, I printed off all the information I could find and started working on fine plate armor.<P>I managed to get to 187 skill and spent quite a lot of PP and lot of time and effort getting the leather paddings.  On top of that, the only place you can get the HQ metal is in HHK (near freeport that is).  But the drawback of this they don't sell smithing molds in HHK.<P>So basically you have to run to HHK buy the ore, run outside to make it into the sheet metal, store it in the bank.  Then run back to FP to buy the molds and combine the items.<P>Just got to be too much of a pain.  Unless you are the kind of person that collects absolutely nothing and only has armor for what you are currently working, this might work.  If you are like me, I like to keep a few things that I don't wear anymore to give to guildmates or such so I don't have much room in my bank box.<P>It's pretty impratical to run to HHK to make 10 to 15 sheet of metal and then run back to FP and then back to HHK and back to FP and so forth.<P>The overall idea behind the smithing was a fun one, but it's typical Verant stupidity that makes it no fun.<BR><P>------------------<BR>Dalur Stouthealer<BR>59th Dwarven Templar<BR>Veeshan Server</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#dedfdf"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Wisecleric</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">You can purchase the MQ ore needed for fine steel plate in Steamfont at the windmills. HOWEVER, you can not purchase "blocks" only "large bricks". That means you have to add the extra step of combining "large bricks" to "blocks". This makes it more of a pain, but an option. Bind a Everhot's forge in Kaladim, run to Steamfont, buy all the ore you can, gate to forge, make sheets, get molds from Everhots has needed, sell back successes to your dwarven vendors for good prices. <P>If you have a second account, mules are the way to go. Various ways to use a mule to speed up the process of smithing lots of fine steel for skill gain. Seems the best way is to fill up a mule and his bank with 120 molds and some water and park him next to HH forge. If you can, get him some 10-slot storage devices for 140 or so molds. If possible, powerlevel the mule (has to be caster of course) so he can gate (and bind is helpful) to make fetching water and more molds quicker. <BR> </FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#f7f7f7"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Dalur - Veeshan</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Only if you have a 2nd account will that work.<P>Once again if you do the Kaladim/Steamfont route, there is a lot of running involved.<P>That is what I was saying is a major pain in the butt.<P>I guess I fail to see why they didn't put the HQ metal available in every city.<BR><P>------------------<BR>Dalur Stouthealer<BR>59th Dwarven Templar<BR>Veeshan Server</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#dedfdf"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Wisecleric</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">HQ metal is used for cultural armor (humans i think) and is mob-drop only. <P>MQ is used for making fine steel plate.<P>I assume its Verants way of controlling the influx of fine steel armor into Norrath (why on earth they would want to ebb the flow of that i have no clue) or to control the rate of skill gain above 175 (as if collecting padding isnt enough). If the second is their intent then i have to say its "working as intended". Its take lots of work and dedication to become a grand master smith. Too much work?

I mean, like if you have a 0% chance to make it if you are under 190smithing and a 5% at 191.<P></FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#f7f7f7"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Snorfen</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">hiyas,<P>yes the stuff is sweet, the enchanted only is even sweeter, i made some of it  <IMG SRC="http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/wink.gif"><P>but <P>the original post sounds a bit as if its easy to get the smithing skill up to a point where it is likely to make this armor, which is not true.<P>my smithing skill is 229 (could be i am the mentioned smith up there by wisecleric since i posted the stats on another board.) <P>my success rate is around 35-40%<P>Honestly I think everything that can be made at a skill of less than 200 will be because of pure luck.<P>The tempers do not grow on trees people, that stuff comes "rare" off level 45+ mobs or ultra rare of some lower level mobs.<P>every wasted temper hurts bad.

My skill is 176 and I haven't touched my smithy hammer in a LONG time. I made my imbued BP and thats what I had wanted to do initially. I tried making the greaves but failed and as a cleric of mith marr i need diamonds so that was a 1400 plat failure <IMG SRC="http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/frown.gif"> the worst part is even if you could buy everything you need to make this stuff from vendors you still couldn't make money off of this. There is no way I can sell that BP that I made for anywhere near enough to justify the time and money i put into it. <P>The problem with the smithed armours is they cost toooooo much for the level they are meant to fill in for. The FS armour is supposed to fill in the gap between bronze armour and quest armours. Imbued or enchatned armours are a bit better than quest armours but would cost incredible amounts for people to make any profit on it at all.</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#f7f7f7"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Dikmer</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Ahhhh, but the beauty of Xegony, is people are buying FS for the LOOK  <IMG SRC="http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/smile.gif"> and sometimes to twink out a newbie character. I have sold a few sets, almost all were the visible pieces only.<P>I made back my initial investment (2750pp) and now have 4500pp banked. I also still have 2 sets made in the bank.<P>I am now in the process of collecting Leather pads. I have 60. When I have 100-120, I am gonna do a power smithing session and make nothing but FSPlate bracers. I hope to trivial them, but doubt that I will. I figure I will have to do this 3 or 4 times to trivial FS armor. (Bracers are hardest and trivial at 208)<P>Once I do that, I plan to make my 16th level Paladin a full set of Imbued  <IMG SRC="http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/wink.gif"> Then I have 3 people in my guild who also want a set, and are willing to pay cost, including failures. Hopefully, that will pick me up a couple more points.<P>This isn'tmainly about the money, it's about the skill. I have played EQ for ages, and never made anything.
