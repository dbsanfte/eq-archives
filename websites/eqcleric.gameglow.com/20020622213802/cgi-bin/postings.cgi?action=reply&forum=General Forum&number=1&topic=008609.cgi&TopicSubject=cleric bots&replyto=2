[B]In terms of EQ when people say "Bot" or "Dual boxing" they mean they are running 2 characters on 2 machines at once. (Or more!)

While I highly recommend playing the cleric in groups without the monk, to learn HOW to be a good cleric, here are some hints that may help.

Helpful social keys to make a cleric a 2nd box are:

The Follow Key:
/target Monk
/follow

The Heal Key:
/target Monk
/sit off
/cast 1 (or whatever number the heal is)
/pause 20
/sit on


While I am NO MEANS an expert, I did a bit of 2boxing recently and found it MUCH easier to play the melee and only use the cleric hotkeys as needed.  With a horse and an outdoor zone, you dont ever need to /sit off so its a good thing.

Good luck.

Personally I don't like them, it kind of degrades our class, when in actuality, playing a cleric in the high level game is probably one of the toughest challenges on the server. Being a cleric is NOT just sit stand heal contrary to popular belief. The easiest way to play a cleric is to duo with a melee type, in your case this is a monk. In that case, you don't have much to do, but beware once you add 2,3,4 more people to your group, your responsibilities widen and no only do you have to heal yourself, you must buff, heal, cure, everyone else in the group let alone spells you may cast on the mob itself. <P>If you must bot either of them I understand why you would want to bot the cleric, as it is the defensive class, and not the one who would pull. <P>If you must (I say this clenching my fists) bot the cleric, hotbuttons can make the job a lot more efficient. Find slots to keep your healing spells, I usually keep three types of healing spells in my first three spell slots. I have hotbuttons for the ones I use most often, Quick heal, Cel Heal and Complete Heal. (or whatever heals you might have at whatever level the cleric is.)<P>Target your monk and set up the hotkey like this<P>/stand<BR>/cast (whatever spell number that spell is, 1-8 starting from the top and going down)<BR>/pause 40<BR>/sit<P>This one button will save time, the pause is determinate on how long it takes you to cast.<P>I do however encourage you to sometimes lay one or the other character aside and have fun playing them for the class they are without having to worry about botting one. I play a monk as well and I very much enjoy that class, though my cleric reflects more of who I am. <P><P>------------------<BR>---&gt; Magada Caduceus &lt;---<BR>  57 Templar of Drinal</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#dedfdf"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Twinskey Bab0linskey</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">May I recomend UO or AC?

I play this cleric as how it is supposed to be played, and I have come to have a ton of respect for the cleric, and enjoy theyre playing style within a few short days.  Perhaps it is now one of my favorite classes, and I'm someone that has only played melee type classes before.  Duel wielding the accounts does not necessarily make one of these toons a "bot" but it does require me to work on my speed and accuracy skills to switch from one computer to the other so I can actually play both simultaneously.

I just wanted to have the option.  That night Fattima was born on my wife's account (the intention being that my wife would actually sometimes play the character, hahahahahaha....)<P>My main is a 57 Ranger.  When I made Fattima he was high 40s or low 50s, he PL'd her a little and twinked her a little but for the most part she was on her own by level 14 and didn't get any decent gear until 25.  <P>Well around 30 I found that I wasn't enjoying the pickup group scene anymore.  My first career being melee I often found myself annoyed at watching them make the mistakes I'd made at the same levels.  I needed something new, like a regular group.  Well I started to hang with some guildies on our designated "twink night" but it wasn't enough.  I had some serious burnout as a Ranger and needed a real break.  <P>I had this Iksar Necro who was 25ish at the time, and I'd been playing him more and more lately as I'd been feeling a bit anti-social.  I decided to give 2 boxing a try with him one night.  I started out doing nothing but using Fattima to buff the necro and his pet, and heal them between fights.  (This was as much to avoid some faction hits as it was to keep things simple.)<P>Along the way I got better at it.  I moved on to more challenging camps.  I took time at every level, in some cases for multiple levels at a time, to go play each of my characters in a "normal" setting - grouping with my cleric and soloing AND grouping with my necro.  Occasionally people started sniffing around, wanting to hang out with me.<P>Eventually Fattima caught up enough to group with my Ranger.  I tried it a few nights but her heals were just not enough to keep things rolling at 37.  She went back to grouping with the necro until she hit 42.  Most of that time was spent 2 boxing in what had become a regular group.<P>Well now I group Fattima with my Ranger all the time, but I also let her tag along and soak XP off my necro.  I have become fairly practiced at 2 boxing and I do not hide what I am doing from anyone.  I tend to be pretty controling about how my groups work, but I have developed a /friends list full of people who are fine with that and trust my ability to play two characters well.  They know that if I need to be focusing on healing and being a cleric that that is what I will do.  <P>I can count on one hand the number of times I have let someone other than myself die while I was 2 boxing, with either the necro or ranger.  Each any of my characters died it was because I had been pushing the limits of what my duo or group could handle, and ultimately had very very few deaths.<P>Playing two characters at a time can be stressful, but it is a lot of fun too.  Personally I like a cleric as a second box character because you can just hang out and duo (solo really) or you can form a group and do something interesting.  If it comes right down to it the other char can stay home and you can just be the healer that night.  Let's face it there's one other thing:  it's tough to beat having a rez available every time you die.<P>------------------<BR><A HREF="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=22247"" TARGET=_blank>Fattima Faithhealer</A> <BR>Level 49 Cleric in the service of Brell<BR>Spirit of the Moon<BR>Innoruuk Server</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#dedfdf"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Aaric</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Multi-boxing can be a curse or a boon, depending on how much time you spend doing it.<P>For instance, the single most important thing is to set up properly.  Get all your spells hotkeyed, and make sure your group listings are the same on both computers.  (so F2 will target your other toon, and F3-F6 target the same people on both machines)  Another good idea is to have your important spells in the bottom 4 slots hotkeyed 1-4, and use Alt-1 to alt-4 for the other spells.  That way, you can cast any of your 8 spells using one hand on the left side of the keyboard.  The physical setup of your computers needs optimized so you can see the other monitor(s) and the KB/mouse are easily accessable.<P>I played my cleric solo to 60 and had about 150 days on him.  When they added macros, my cleric playing experience was incredibly boring.  Granted clericing isn't all about sitting and healing, but in most situations, that's all that is required.  So much about being a cleric is knowing whats going on and whats going to happen...and I find multi-boxing actually gives me a better view of the entire situation.  Additionally, playing cleric/chanter in the same group lets you manage mana by slowing/rooting very efficiently.<P>I leveled my rogue to 60 on another account, and am currently bringing my enchanter (2 yellows to 60 - whee!) up on a 3rd box.  I routinely raid with my rogue/cleric (NToV, Deep, Ssra, etc) and routinely 3 box for xp.  I ended up 3 boxing at a raid recently spot healing/runing the MT, and doing crowd control of adds.<P>Granted, I will drop to a single box if its a new area, or I am having to coordinate a heal rotation, run groups, or am not up to the attention required.<P>For instance, last night I was in the hole<BR>with my 'partner' who was running a 54 druid and a 56 monk, and we managed to derail a 10 mob 'pull' which included 7 golems.  Most pickup groups you would see would get pummeled by a pull half that size.<P>Calling all multi-boxers bad, is like saying all druids are soling farmers.</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#f7f7f7"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Band Aid</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Ahh ok thanks, i've been away from EQ for about a year now so i wasnt sure.

Its too hard to actually PLAY a cleric right and do anything else at the same time. Even CH rotations require you to pay some attention, and a 3 second slip can mean Raid failure. You don't take that kind of responsibility lightly. But in general, 2 boxing with other classes can also teach you the strengths and weaknesses of the other class and help you learn to support them better.</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#f7f7f7"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">electrae</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">That's a shame, there's some excellent players out there with bots.  Playing a healer in most situations is one of the easier bots to run.  In fact, I often play a cleric and druid together and the combination of choloroblast and DL/Cheal has often saved us from a bad situation whereas two seperate people couldn't have done it.  The right hand knowing exactly what the left hand is doing is awesome.<P>When you're the puller and the cleric, you know exactly when to heal.  <P>Botting not only makes the game more fun and interesting to play, but it sometimes leads to a synergy where you can do a lot better with fewer individual players.<P>In fact, last night we went clear down to the bridge before Trak's lair, Juggs, Shrooms (think we had 5-6 in camp at one point), reets, and I was playing rogue, cleric and druid.  Hardest part is not losing a bot with auto-follow!<P>Some of the best healers I know are also playing a meleer.  I have a friend that bots 5 and he can do HoT all by himself.

Moving them all is a REAL pain in places where autofollow isn't an option.</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#f7f7f7"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Radahr_Manasponge</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">I personally four box cleric, ranger, warrior, rogue daily. In a pinch my buddie's account has a 51 war and a 43 enchie for emergencies. I log in solo, spend a bit talking to the guild, etc. If nothing cool is scheduled, and group situation doesn't look too promising...BAM, instant group of my own. LOL Although the first time you try keeping everything from Safe Hall to the Lord clear every spawn cycle for a couple hours.....talk about strss!</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#dedfdf"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Treiz</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">LOL Electrae. I've seen the Gomo-train in action before. His sk with four other bots in tow is pretty crazy to see in action. I didn't believe he could do it until I saw it first hand.<P>On the actual practice of botting I'm indifferent. There are some players out there that are really damn good at it. While there are others that give 2-boxer's bad names. So, for me, I say if you're good at it, more power to you. If you suck at it, for god sakes don't play more than one character in a group where you can potentially kill some of your groupmates.<P>------------------<BR><A HREF="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=41117" TARGET=_blank>Treiz Khushrenada</A><BR>60 High Priest<BR>Crimson Twilight<BR>Drinal</FONT></TD></TR></TABLE>
