<TEXTAREA NAME="EditedMessage" ROWS=10 COLS=45 WRAP="VIRTUAL">People, this has to stop.

I have a 50th enchanter alt, Sneer D`Logos(which I play more often of late) and I'm really discouraged by what I'm seeing comming up from the cleric community.

The skills just aren't there and the reason as I see it is celestial heal. It has to be the most abused spell in the game.

I see clerics who cast this spell and only this spell for hours on end. They are grouped with tanks who have around 2500 plus hit points and not one complete heal is ever cast. Consequently they are constantly saying they are lom at 20 or 40 or my favorite 'can't get mana to buff'. Sure Cel heal has a great ratio but its nothing compared to complete on a 50ish tank.

My cleric is level 52. All of the people that I have grouped with and have come to know over the past year and a bit as my cleric will tell you I know what I am doing, I am a VERY good cleric. I know what heal to use, when to use it and who to use it on. I manage my mana when I'm healing as well as is humanly possible. No one is ever without the buffs that they should have and they never have to ask for them, everything is timed. If I'm LOM and pulls need to be held for a minute, we just finished a long fight.

Sound concieted? Good. Now you have an idea of how confident I am in my abilities as a cleric; 90% of which, if not more, have been tuned by this site and the posts of the community here. So maybe my ill feelings towards this misuse of abilities is in part a case of the 'doctor making the worst patient' but I'm certain it's much more than that.

As a cleric I never really got to see what skills were possesed by the rest of our population. Now, as I play my enchanter more and more I can see how many clerics are playing. What I see is sad. I've had pulls which would zone chanterless groups instantly become controlled, which I'm sure is the norm for groups with a dealer. The problem is how the clerics I have been seeing react on such pulls. The pull is not, as far as I'm concerned, controlled until the enchanter has used a single target mez to ice all but the current kill target. Area mez doesn't count, that's not control, that's a temporary freeze. The time that it takes for the enchanter to control the fight is when the cleric needs to do the most work. A lot of people will be getting hit and you need to be very alert and give your enchanter those extra seconds he/she may need to control the pull.

The two people in the most danger during this time are the cleric and the enchanter. They are each responsible for the other. The enchanter CANNOT let his/her cleric get hit, that's death to the group as no heals can be past out; the enchanter's job is to protect the cleric at all costs. Often that means using area mez when you would rather take a bit of time to single them out, therefore, the pull is not controlled. The cleric CANNOT let his/her enchanter hit the floor. If class X and your enchanter are both going down, who do you heal first? No brainer.

Now back to celestial heal. You have this pull which is not controlled (maybe some mobs are held by area mez) and your enchanter is getting beat on by a couple of others who resisted, and his health is falling; it's your job to keep him/her alive. If you even THINK about casting celestial heal, I'm sorry, but you're a fool. You may as well run to the zone now and mem rez when you're out, it's the same thing.

Celestial heal is USELESS on enchanters with one exception that I've seen; cast on him/her BEFORE their health starts to drop when they are getting attention. But even then, be prepared to throw a remedy or whatever fast casting heal you have memmed soon thereafter. They do not have the hit points nor the AC to make it even remotely useful as a 'saving' heal; cast something else when the red starts to fall, please. I've had 4 mobs wailing on me, chew through rune4 and have me down to 2 or 3 bubbles of health before the cleric even STARTED casting. And what did they cast on me? Celestial heal. Stupid.

a_tank_00 tells the group 'damn'
group_member_02 shouts 'TRAIN TO ZONE'
silly_cleric_73 tells you 'Ready for res?'

This has happened over and over during the past few weeks that I have been playing my enchanter, not once or twice. I've been lucky with my stuns, many times one resist here or there on area stun and the next area mez would have been another death. And I'm sad to say it was no thanks to the cleric, no thanks to celestial heal.

Please, please, please, see celestial heal for what it is. Learn when to use it to its potential, but more importantly, learn when NOT to use it. I had initially hoped that such behaviour from my healer was just a bad apple, but it has continuted for too long and I believe that it is much more common than I had hoped. I'm going to start making hotkeys to explain how bad the spell can be if this doesn't stop. It's like trying to teach people the value of assisting all over again. I don't think I have it in me.

I believe that most of you here, if not all, reading this didn't need to. But maybe there was one . . .
