<TEXTAREA NAME="EditedMessage" ROWS=10 COLS=45 WRAP="VIRTUAL">Alan's reference to making the cleric class more rounded brings up the very core of the problem with giving druids more effective heals:  A druid with a viable raid-level heal is the "uberclass" for exp groups, capable of casting just about all the important spells in the game, and is now an effective healer as well.  (Not to forget, of course, druids have a comparable heal to Divine Light, but that's not the subject, (it's viable raid heals), and the Divine Light casting time vs. hitpoint ratio is usually insufficient for a single healer to keep a caster alive on a raid anyway.  I enjoy the challenge presented by assist healing being "necessary", but I have noticed that druids on raids would rather nuke, vying for the exp and/ or killing shot, rather than healing).

If druids are given a healing spell which is anywhere near a complete heal, (and I mean even 2,000 HP healing spell is near enough), there will be very little reason to have a cleric in an exp group -- (shaman are better than clerics in a growing amount of circumstances -- a druid raid-level heal will take another portion of that quickly shrinking pie, especially as tanks get tougher via AA skills and more uber armor entering the game every day).  Clerics have very little to offer a group in terms of killing power and utility spells, so the degree to which VI improves druid heals will exponentially reduce the desireability of clerics for exp situations.  Meaning, the "penalty" for having a cleric in your group, (over another healer), is that your kill time is slowed considerably.  That penalty needs to be considered against the druid's downtime penalty caused by less efficient heals.  But first, take into consideration how quickly VI is raising the mana regen rate.  I don't think it 's possible to control the relative power of a druid raid - level heal here, it's too variable given the super mana regen coming into the game lately.  As a well equipped L60 raiding guild cleric I can pull, heal and fight with a group without medding in a LOT of circumstances (given a half decent tank) -- the tradeoff is I can't SOW, invis, evac, lev, etc., etc.  Sounds like level 23 all over again, where shaman and druids are much preferred over clerics.  Indeed, all you need to do is look at the shaman healing spell "Torpor" in order to see what Verant saw as the balance issues in relation to a super - utility class getting an "almost CH" -- the torpor spell is a heal over time, and the player who has torpor on is snared, and has a lowered attack rating, not to mention the spell is almost as rare as they come in this game, and castable only at level 60.

Sub - 60 clerics, start exping as hard as you can.  Verant has screwed up before, (manaless CH, ROFL, my dog could have seen how overpowering that was).  I think it's fair to assume they don't realize the depth of problems they can create here.  As temporary as it was, the recent change to NPC caster "Line - Of - Sight" rules makes we wonder if they really think things out, or just change something for the sake of changing something.  I have no background in games, but it took me exactly zero seconds to see how bad an NPC "line - of - sight" change would be.  Perhaps the game balance crew took a vacation and forgot to return.

Indeed, they will "improve" clerics in small degrees, changing our role and mucking things up as they go, but should a druid "almost CH" heal go live before we're (yeesh) "rounded"...

Level fast.
