Druid friend is the way to go.  I was sitting in the Freeport bank when a high level Cleric offered to by all the quest armor I had on for a lot of Plat.  I was low on cash and went for it.  It was worth it, but NOT worth selling the BP.  =(  Well the servers went down the very next day for a patch and my druid friend and I were some of the first people on during the weekday afternoon (didn't have to work that day).  Got all my quest items back and then some.  Got my full set in 3 days.  Dwigus was trouble for me.  In fact, I had an easier time finding Regis twice in the time it took me to finally get Dwingus once.  With the money I made I had enough to buy all the plat for my full quest suit and some left over.  Don't ever sell the BP.  bad bad bad.<P>Getting all the stuff back in the time it took me would NOT have bene possible without the Druid to Teleport, camo, sow, and invis me.

Druid snares, and my only job is to keep it feared.  Maybe a nuke here and there.  I went nuts on nuking before and that turned out bad.  When fear breaks, the hit really hard and I didn't have the mana for a heal (We had three rogues that joined in the group).<P>Nice thing was that by not nuking and letting the rogues do their job, I was able to turn a bad three spectre pull into success.

Right around the time I hit level 48, I ran out of steam in leveling... so I spent three to four weeks doing nothing but quests from sun up to sun down. Overall, I've equipped at least six (posibly more) clerics in full sets of armor. I've set my alarm clock for 3:45 AM to catch Regis and his timely spawn. My in game husband (bless his patient soul) often comments how mechanical and deadly efficient I have become... so if you're on Saryrn and have some enchanted platinum... give me a tell.  <IMG SRC="http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/wink.gif"><P>Druids.
