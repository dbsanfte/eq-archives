<TEXTAREA NAME="EditedMessage" ROWS=10 COLS=45 WRAP="VIRTUAL"> [QUOTE]Originally posted by Seliris:
2. Do they have a dedicated Dev team/SWAT team/customer response team? or is it all a BASE code team?  

Reason: If there is only a BASE team, then chances are they are tasked with Velious and other advances more often than bug fixes... (read: Money.. it's all about money guys)


[/QUOTE]

I personally have been saying this is the core of the problem for quite some time.  Verant was a smallish company before EQ came out, and most likely only had a Devo Engineering team, and not a Sustaining Engineering team.  Coding new stuff makes money.  Fixing code in old stuff does not.  I have been in Abashi's place, actually, for a MUCH less popular product.  We suffered the same problems.  There were major, crippling bugs that did not get fixed for some 14 months.  The reason for this was that we did not have a separate sustaining engineering team, and the programmers(and their managers) had to choose between coding something new, exciting, ground breaking, and money making, or 2 year old code that in many cases, they did not write.  I see a LOT of the same behavior in Verant, so I assume that their sustaining team is either A)lacking in talent, B)lacking in staff, or both.  Abashi could be going to the programmers/higher ups with the problems that he sees as legitimate, they might just not be getting done. 

That being said, I don't think that Abashi is doing that good of a job being the spokesperson for the players.  One of the BIG tips to being a successful CR person is to sympathize with the customer, and make it known to them that you understand their plight, and that you will do whatever you can to address their issue.  Another big tip is to honestly answer the questions, even if it is not what the people want to hear or it makes you look bad.  I would much rather hear "What you reported is a bug, but we don't know how to fix it" than "It is working as intended", when everyone seems to agree that it is indeed NOT working as it should, or has in the past.  

Abashi really should start trying to get the customers on his side, by any means possible.  This will cut down on the threats, cut down on the sniping from the players, and I think will gain a better sense of communication between Verant and the customers, which I think was reason he was brought on board.  

I do feel bad sometimes for the guy, I wouldn't like thousands of people to curse my name.
