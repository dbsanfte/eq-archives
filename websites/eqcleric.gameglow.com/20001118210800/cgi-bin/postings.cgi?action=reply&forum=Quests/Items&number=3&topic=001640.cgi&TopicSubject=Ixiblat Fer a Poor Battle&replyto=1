Ixiblat Fer reigned supreme tonight over 42 brave souls. After the patch was complete we brave souls gathered to the Skyfire Zone Hill in BW and prepared for the Battle vs Ixiblat. A solid mix of Enchanters,Magicians, Necros, and Tanks, all with our Faith and spirits High. Mind you the avg levels of the enitire Raid was about lvl 52, we felt we still had a fair shot at Ixiblat. All went well,the Shell was turned into Naxton and she was controlled by our enchanter. and Ixiblat was pulled to Skyfire zone with little trouble or damage. This is when things went very wrong. Pets were sent in and the tanks behind. I watched as every Tank was dropped within 15 seconds of the encounter. <BR>One very important point was omited from previous posts or perhaps was added this patch. Ixiblat Fer will only target one person and stay on them until they are dead. Couldnt be taunted off, nor feared or snared.<BR>I watched both my lvl 56 tanks drop from full 4000 hp health to dead in a second with no warning or chance to heal!<BR>We ressed and rebuffed and attempted him again but with the same poor result. I'm not ashamed of our failure and was quite proud of the attempt. I cannot confirm that the patch made Ixiblat any Tuffer and wont use it as an excuse. But please let me know if he is harder than before todays patch or perhaps we were but to low in levels to try such a difficult encounter. It is sad to see him still wandering the zone of burningwoods, flaunting his great Victory!<BR>I will return to the Temple of Marr and pray for a better understanding of this disheartening Battle.  <P>Brother in Arms<BR>Caddar Tevya  54th Level<BR>Humble Servant of Mithaniel Marr<P>[This message has been edited by Caddar (edited 10-04-2000).]<p>[This message has been edited by Caddar (edited 10-04-2000).]</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#f7f7f7"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Sulfer</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">This is really bad news, I intended to battle him this Thursday, I might hold off depending on what other ppl have to say on the topic...</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#dedfdf"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Caer</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">My heart goes out to you Cad..we've known each other quite a while on the shores of Tarew Marr, and I hate to hear of your defeat. I wish I would have known you were attempting this freakazoid Elemental..I would have offered to help with what we learned from our success this past weekend when I and Toric both rallied forces to kill him twice. If I can help ya in any way just shoot me a tell.<P>Ixiblat Fer is no pushover folks...<P>This past Sunday I decided to have a go at him. First time I spawned him I had 4 full groups...good mix of all classes  avg levels 55+...and Ixiblat ran over us like a mack truck. We all died in less than 20 seconds..he quad hits up to 575 a pop and his AoE, though toned down is a nusiance and does whiddle away at your tanks.  We got owned the first attempt..and I was sweating it thinking I was going to be back underwater camping that god awful Burgurgle again. We did, btw...pull him to the Skyfire zoneline. That open area is a great battle area for Ixiblat..no roamers or local fauna to deal with.<P>Frantic call went out, 3 more groups joined us and we ressed and rallied for a second attempt before he despawned. We took his fiery ass down like a rock, zero deaths that second time and I pulled the sceptre off his smouldering carcass. Loot: Sceptre of Ixiblat Fer and Belt of Fire<P>We spawn him again for Brother Toric (we kept Naxot busy so she wouldn't suicide) , and again we are dropping him fast...UNTIL the bastard went Enraged and tanks started dropping like flies. 7 deaths, but we won again, thanks to some heavy nukking at the end from our casters. Toric now had the second Sceptre on Tarew Marr in his possession. Loot:Sceptre of Ixiblat Fer and Crown of Flames<P>Suggested tip: Pull Naxot to the skyfire zone..a simple stun will bring her running behind you. When you get her to the Skyfire zone either root and atone her, or have a chanter mes and mem blur. Naxot is now in your camp for when you wish to turn in the shell to spawn Ixiblat. You will need to keep hailing her until you do so, or she will wander away back to her original spot.  Second tip..have a puller at Ixiblat's spawn loc and warn the zone before you pop it. If you fail on the first attempt..again warn the zone. Ixiblat Fer will go back to his original spawn location and will kill anyone he agros on in his path back.<P><BR>The Overking is no joke either...word to the wise...DO NOT fight the overking in his chamber..his Gflux WILL agro the spawns on the floor above him. Last night we had  managed to clear all but the King and 1 guard and rushed him in his chamber. Got him down to the "e" in overking when he got a gflux off and 9 guards promptly came in from the entrance of the chamber and decimated us from behind. We had just cleared the Prince and the Herbalist areas, so the area was clean. Once the guards started on us..the King Ch'd and it was all over. Though those that stood fighting valiantly took the king down to 50% again before the last man was killed. Time to rally another "Kill the King" raid...<P><BR>BTW..this is pure speclation..but my guess is that we will be sent to deal with Zordak Ragefire next (Makes sense since he is the self proclaimed leader of the Plasmatic Priesthood we have been fighting). Its also my conjecture that Zordak will "repop" as a Dragon (probabably a badass one at that) since his text make reference of "mortals" killing such a proud beast such as Nagafen of which it is plain he does not consider himself mortal. In addition..why put a seemingly "human" NPC in such a large cavernous room? Dragon...pure specualation.. I for one will be bringing a large ass army when I hand in that pice to Zordak. Suggest you all do the same...let yas know how it goes this weekend when I get the note    <IMG SRC="http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/wink.gif"><P><BR>Caer<BR>56th Dark Templar of Marr<BR>Tarew Marr <P>[This message has been edited by Caer (edited 10-04-2000).]<p>[This message has been edited by Caer (edited 10-04-2000).]</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#f7f7f7"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Eachann</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Hail Caer,<P>Caddar and I together battled Ixblot last night.
