<TEXTAREA NAME="EditedMessage" ROWS=10 COLS=45 WRAP="VIRTUAL">Pretty good ideas, Isafel but there's one major thing you forget...

Experience.

When I zone into OS and /shout for a group I'm not looking for loot, I'm looking for exp. Why do you think people camp the pool room of SolB, where no loot drops? It's fast exp. TONS of blue mobs that can be gotten there easily in controlled pulls.

Verant's exp system is horribly out of whack. It takes you as long to go through the final 10 levels as it did to go through the first 50. Now, it's easy to say "It's because Verant wants you to play the game longer" which may or may not be true. But the simple fact is that 51-60 was added as an "overflow valve".

It's pretty obvious Verant never planned for ANY expansions in the original stages. Some of the things they did were so short sighted it was pathetic. 

There were only 3 places to go for post-40 exp: SolB, LGuk and Kedge. Kedge was nice, but you HAD to have an EBer and worse, the ideal spell for the zone, DMF, couldn't be cast in there (FYI, it still can't, as per The Vision<SUP><FONT SIZE="-1">TM</FONT></SUP>) So, for practical reasons everyone crammed into SolB and LGuk. They were the only places to get a pickup group. Kunark helped solve that (be careful what you wish for... zones filled with level 40 yard trash is a BAD thing). Despite the new zones, the best places to get exp are still those few places where you can pull a steady stream of blues and those happen to be Sebilis and Karnor's. Everywhere else you can do this is either too far out of the way (Splitpaw, CoM) or too hard to reach (Velketor's Labyrinth, Dragon Necropolis) or has a hard to get key (Howling Stones).

Skills use only one byte. One byte is 8 bits and a bit is a 0 or a 1. If we let the resulting string represent base 2, we can represent all the numbers from 0 (00000000) to 255 (11111111). That's why none of your stats (except HP, mana and AC) can exceed 255 and none of your skills can exceed 252. This model worked just fine in the pre-50 world but in the post-50 it fell apart. Meditate caps at 252 (level 51) so casters without mana regen (read: clerics) suffer as their mana pools go up but their ability to regain that mana stays the same. Monks were better at melee but now they are equal to warriors and must use weapons to outdamage them. The list goes on... The point is they should have gone to a 2 byte stat on everything when Kunark opened but now it's too late. Switching would require a MASSIVE revamp of the entire game structure, something Verant won't do given how much work they've put into other, more minor problems in the past.

Flow control via spawn rate. Better known as the "rare spawn" or "the PH cycle". For certain things, this works quite well. The AC in OOT is a good example of PHed mobs not grinding people into the ground with boredom. But for the rest it's just plain awful. I think we all know the reason why...

So no, EQ isn't perfect. I'm not sure it'll be fixed. And a new GUI in SoL isn't gonna fix it...
