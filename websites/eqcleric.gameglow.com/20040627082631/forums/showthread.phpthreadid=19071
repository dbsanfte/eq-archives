	<p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial">Gonna pop outisde the box of cleric ideas once again...<br />
<br />
<br />
  Take what we have and put it in a twist of sorts...<br />
<br />
<br />
 1- Reoccurring stuns- ie STUN DOTS... Not a mez, resistable, but last for several ticks...talk about mitigation...soloing tool big time, allows you to step back heal, nuke, or melee unhindered - if it's not resisted. Excellent interupt tool.<br />
<br />
    Suggestion- <b> Censure of Thought I II III IV V VI VII VIII VIIII X </b> First one at lvl 12 then every 6 levels thereafter a new one is available. X is availble at 65/66.<br />
    Censure of Thought 1 - Stun 2 sec every 6 seconds (tic) for 3 ticks. Magic type- Magic. Resist -10. Knockback 0. Damage 0. Effect XXXX's Reels momentarily as their thoughts are Censured. Range 1000. Fizzle yes. Cast time 3 sec upto 5 sec at lvl X version. Recast timer 30 seconds to 1 minute at lvl X.<br />
<br />
   ODD Versions Increase Number of Ticks by 1. Even Versions Increase Duration of Stun by 1 sec.<br />
   So lvl X version would stun for 7 seconds for seven ticks.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
    2- <b>Fizzlebain's Jumping Shield</b>- Summons a Shield that will intercept a hit randomly during combat for the cleric. If there are group members in a group with the cleric it may jump to another group member. Every other turn if more than one in a group it returns to the cleric that cast it.  No more than one shield can protect a person at one time. There can be more than one such shield in a group at a time, if there is more than one cleric with the spell active in group.<br />
   Shield has 200 hitpoints regens 20 a turn, generates no agro. Has effective AC of the cleric who cast it for mitigation purposes. <br />
 Pairs well with the cleric hammer.<br />
 Higher versions of the shield increase in base hitpoint pool and regenability of itself.<br />
 If shield dies, it deflates and makes a horridly pitiful sound as it does, and flops around for a few seconds before fading (one full tick).<br />
 This is basically a mobile barrier spell that can be used in a group...who knows if it will be on the cleric when he gets hit unless he's solo or duoing with another cleric.<br />
 It can take one hit per turn- even if it's over the max hitpoints it can take. It is meant to take ONE blow for the cleric and disappear, if it takes less than it's max damage it can regen slowly the damage back.<br />
 Duration is equal to minutes as to spell level. Clerics get this concurrently with their summoned hammer spells as they level.<br />
 <br />
 Basically Mob attacks cleric, shield spell checks to see if it is guarding that person. Shield makes a roll to intercept and take the blow. If it intercepts it takes that blow. Cleric or protected target in group, does not. Damage is applied to shield as if it were the cleric (AC/Mitigation). If damage is more than hitpoint reserve of the shield- It dies- spetacularily and well in a silly manner (kinda a cross between a baloon deflating and a fish on land making pitiful sounds). If not it begins to regen damage at its normal listed rate.<br />
 All shields have a base 20% chance to intercept that rises with level and is modified by the level of the mob being fought- even level mobs means even level chance ie- 0% mod to hit or miss. The chance to intercept rises with level version of spell. Cleric can choose to use higher versions or use a lower version if he wants too.<br />
 Shield uses mana to be summoned and then takes some mana to maintain (minimal) to stay up. Unlike summoned hammer pets, this shield stays up regardless of whether or not Cleric is underattack or just moving about. It generates zero agro.<br />
 It stays with in 100' of cleric at all times...if someone moves out of its patrol radius it won't hop to them it will find another target to do so nearer if one exists in a group. Or stays with cleric.<br />
 It is immune to CC spells, aoe's , rampage (cant' stop that either) damage, riposet damage can be stopped-and will likely destroy the shield if it is able to stop it.<br />
<br />
 Highest version of shield would have 2000 hitpoints and regen 200 tick.  Other versions inbetween that. Mana to summon would be 10% of it's hitpoints duration about same as a major buff of a cleric spell that level. Cast time 5 sec. Recast time (yes there will be times that this is needed to be recast over and over and over) is 3 seconds. <br />
<br />
 What these offer is a different solution to CC- this makes a cleric hand for CC somewhat when a shaman isn't available for a slow(nor a chanter).<br />
<br />
 Offers a version of damage mitigations (with humor) that may work or not. May live or not. But can stop a hit if it does, keeping that person from being hit at all. This means Cleric can cast vs heal in some situations. This is a variable mitigation solution and can help.<br />
<br />

	<p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial">PART II of thinking outside box II-<br />
<br />
 Clerics want more dps and want to achieve at least 80% exp capeability of a druid or shaman soloing as the other priests are asking for the same ability for their healing.<br />
 Healing for other seer classes will be upgraded, this is a sure thing based on how the game has developed over the five years.<br />
 But , clerics never have had their soloability and viability in other than groups assisted benificially - SO FAR...<br />
 There is hope that when this healing balance comes through that clerics receive a benifit in both melee and spells that will allow them to have more solo utility, and ability to level better.<br />
 They pay heavily through out their careers for lack of utility, extreme costs in buffs that require components for casting.<br />
 They are faced with decreased needs in groups outside of end raids where healing isn't as much of a factor and end up being Buff whores, or struggling hours for experience and AA's that their replacements can achieve in matters of minutes sometimes.<br />
<br />
 THIS must be carried throughout the career from lvl 1 to 65 in game currently- and initially be balanced on base classes spells and with out AA consideration. Later past lvl 55 or even 60- they may be used in the balance as that's the point they become a required option in the career of a cleric and also harder to achieve for said cleric.<br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
  DPS in one way or another must increase- it is in how it is increased that disparity even among clerics is argued.<br />
 But the problem remains there, even with out concurrence on a solution.<br />
 Take the triad of the priests and their abilities.<br />
<br />
   Cleric- 100% Heal 30% CC (stun/root) 20% Utility 30% melee 65% casting.<br />
               Best in Groups. Subaverage Soloer. High Downtime.<br />
  Shaman- 60% Heal  90% CC (slows/root/off pet tanking) 75% Utility 65% melee (pet n spear) 90% Casting. <br />
                 Good Soloer. Good In groups. Minimal Downtime.<br />
   Druid-   75% Heal. 75% CC (snare Roots)  100% utility 65% melee (pet/charmed pets/DS etc) 100% Casting.<br />
                Great soloer. Good in groups. Minimal Downtime.<br />
<br />
<br />
  Now look at what's being proposed as possible upgrades to healing for groups and as a side effect their soloing abilities thereafter.<br />
     Cleric  100% heal  100% Burst Heal- No changes to rest.<br />
     Druids 80% Heal   80% Burst Heal 80% Regen-  About 100% increase in soloability. 50% increase in group healing viability.<br />
     Shaman 75% heal 75% Burst Heal 100% regen- About 90% increase in soloability. 60% increase in group healing viability.<br />
<br />
   X gets to stay stagnant and can't level as good as Y or Z out of groups.<br />
 Yet Y and Z get better at healing too, and therefor soloing, so they achive AA's and levels faster, increase in power faster, and replace the cleric more often in non-raid situations as others achive higher AA's.<br />
 This means X's viability for soloing decreases over time as they level. Their need outside raid groups decreases more over time as they level and increase in power. And it becomes that much harder for them to achieve levels and AA's to compete soloing or in non raid groups.<br />
<br />
 This is not based on just healing, but the rest of the packages as indicated in the first chart above.<br />
<br />
 What must be done is to consider viability across the board.<br />
<br />
 Shaman and Druids both need the minimum of 80% versions of heals of a cleric in raid situations and higher end content.<br />
 FINE.<br />
<br />
 Extrapolate this across the board. But remember, this doesn't just mean increase BURST DPS and increase mana accordingly on all spells...as that doesn't address the downtime issue and that along with surviveability is a major issue for a cleric who solo's as nearly 65% of his time soloing is spent actively meditating for mana vs actively killing things.<br />
 So the solution of taking a spell and making it hit 50% harder and costing 50% more mana doesn't work over the career of the cleric, as his mana pool is finite and limited in regen more so than the other priests.<br />
<br />
 Would a 20% increase across the board on damage in spells, while retaining mana costs work? <br />
  Not likely.<br />
 Would a 20% increase in melee dps work? <br />
  Not alone it wouldn't.<br />
 Would other solutions be met with derision and screams from melee types- yep. Does it really matter or belong in this discussion? Not at all. It is a seperate issue entirely from the priest issues presented here.<br />
 The only part that should be entered into the discussion is that of the paladin. As they are melee-cleric hybrids. And they are the stop gap between priests and other melee classes and hybrids.<br />
<br />
  A Cleric needs 80% of the utility of his subclass and sister classes. Needs 80% of the soloability of the same. And needs 75% to 80% of the melee ability of the paladin to BE FAIRLY balanced if proposed and previous healing changes are considered, and this must be carried back down the chain all the way to level one of the Cleric's career.<br />
<br />
 Melee is both Mitigation, Swinging a weapon, blocking, parry, and avoidance. This must be balanced across to achieve the full 80% of the Paladin's ability to melee- this includes their ability to deal with undead.<br />
<br />
 Full armor mitigation by type worn would increase this a bit.<br />
 Increasing Melee abilities to 80% of a paladin's skill caps would work more so towards that end too.<br />
 Increasing defensive abilities more than the melee abilities would be more in line with the clerics and enhance soloability by minimizing their down time and mana needed for self healing.<br />
 At top end this mitigation would be near neglible change over all, but in soloing it would stretch the cleric's melee/defensive abilities alot more.<br />
<br />
  BURST melee changes in Yaulp lines are one way that was attempted. But they alone are not enough.  In combination, they might work as a package.<br />
<br />
  SPELLS changes As noted above are the type of solution that might extend soloability and non raid groupability.<br />
<br />
 Spells need utility and variety. The Cleric needs the same.<br />
<br />
 Whether or not a player "WANTS" a melee increase or not, or prefers spell casting over melee isn't the balance issue- the balance needs themselves are.<br />
 As is the mission of the cleric in groups, and then solo.<br />
 SOLO is a major part of the game, and when a cleric struggles here to do something to level, quest, experience, farm and spend time in a positive manner in EQ. <br />
 They are faced with the wall of reality that they, cannot do even 50% of what others do in this area of EQ.<br />
 This leads to a feeling of servitude towards guilds and raid mindset, and therefor stagnation, boredom and cancellations.<br />
 POOR CS by EQ, poor communications, constant nerfs, repeated promises that never are followed through or are given and removed from the cleric's hands, out right lies, deceptions, and delay tatics pushed aside for the next big expansion and shiny new objects means that the cleric is unhappy.<br />
 This means more and more clerics retire, increasing the need for more and more new clerics and other priests to fill in the raiding healing needs of guilds and groups in EQ.<br />
 <br />
 As you can see CLERICS are the backbone of the game along with enchanters.<br />
 As I said before- How can EQ survive if Atlas Shrugged?<br />
<br />
 We carry the burden of the high end game, and the fun of our compatriots online on our shoulders alone. Yet we cannot achieve fairness in soloing, nor outside of raids alone without derision or a wall of silence.<br />
<br />
 Time to step outside the box, forget EQ2 - and try and save the clerics before you adjust healing.<br />
<br />
 YOU CANNOT FIX HEALING IMBALANCE IN GAME WITHOUT CONSIDERING IMPLICATIONS ON CLERICS OUTSIDE RAIDS.<br />
<br />
 The problems are NOTED-<br />
<br />
 WHat are you going to do about it?<br />
 FOR us the customer it is very very very simple- "CANCEL" if we're not happy. BOYCOTT- any further products.<br />
 And for any cleric unhappy with their lively hood and fun in EQ- You can forget any other SOE product hitting the market in the future too. <br />
 Five years is five too many of pushing aside the pleas of a class, of you "paying" customer base.<br />
<br />
 Are you looking?<br />
 Do you hear us?<br />
 Are you listening?<br />
<br />
 What is next is upto you and your company, EQ/SOE.<br />
 Platitudes are not sufficient.<br />
 You must have a plan, a timetable- AND SOON, and DELIVER.<br />
 Or EQ will die as more and more cleric's leave, makeing the game untenable for the rest of its player base.</font></p>

Secondly, none of the discussions consider any classes beyond the priest classes (plus paladins sometimes). The most common theme seems to be giving better heals to druids and shamans, while giving better offensive power to clerics. But where does this leave the other classes? If mages and druids are currently balanced by mages having a pet for more DPS while druids have some healing, if druid healing gets upgraded this leaves them overpowered compared to mages. And so all classes would need to be upgraded to compensate. <br />
If the classes are balanced as they are currently, then in order for druids and shamans to be better at healing, then need to receive downgrades in other areas. In effect, robbing Peter to pay Paul, to use the words of another. <hr></blockquote><br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Frankly any other class than shaman, druids or paladins does not belong anywhere near a discussion in fixing clerics and balancing healing for priests. <br />
Ever. <br />
<br />
ONCE priests are balanced amongst the triad, once clerics receive some upgrades as suggested or promised for so long, once all of this is IN, and only then. <br />
<br />
That's when you can then compare PRIEST classes with other class groups----for overall balance of the game. <br />
<br />
You can not balance clerics against other classes. <br />
You do not have to rob peter to pay paul. <br />
That's shortsightedness caused by reflex fixes and poor coding. <br />
<br />
YOU simply must balance the priest classes amongst themselves FIRST. <br />
<br />
Once a happy medium is achieved and tested and refined (THAT IS WHAT THE TEST SERVER IS FOR). <br />
THEN you take the Three priests as ONE set of architypes and then do a balance for content and effectiveness of the game. <br />
<br />
This way no one looses out, no one is truly outside their niche. <br />
<br />
WHAT this does require is that we define the class sets. <br />
<br />
HYBRIDS <br />
PRIESTS <br />
MELEE <br />
STEALTH <br />
CASTERS <br />
<br />
Five basic class Sets- You balance the groups by considering one of each and a floater slot. WHO cares which class is in that slot. As each class set contains a group of balanced classes. Well supposedly. <br />
<br />
So a group could have one of each of the above and the last slot saved for what's needed for an encounter- (NON raid situation). <br />
<br />
Need more healing or require it by encounter set up. Add another Priest class to the Six slot. <br />
<br />
Need more DPS and Mitigation Add another Melee. <br />
<br />
Need more special abilities? Add a Hybrid. <br />
<br />
Need Faster Burst DPS? Add a Caster... <br />
<br />
four set ups...four types of encountes- more easily balanced in theoretical encounters and capeabilities. <br />
<br />
You don't balance an encounter on one lvl 39 class ability...you balance it on a group or multiple group set ups. <br />
<br />
Abilities are considered a conglomerate under the aegis of said CLASS SETS. Not by individual classes. <br />
You can refine encounters there after for soloing or random encounters based on this package and make the game more fun. <br />
This way certain set ups of groups could do the encounter better or faster or slower but less casualties...none would be the only way, but one of the four ways...of course minmaxers and power guilds will find the optimum way for each encounter and build accordingly, but this means other guilds and groups can do the encounter too with the subpar group set ups as long as they cover most of the required class sets balanced into that encounter. <br />
<br />
This is MACRO balancing. It means that individual skill and gear spikes are a non-factor for balancing. <br />
No longer would one class be nerfed. But it'd be adjusted with in its own aegis. <br />
Encounters could then focus on groups and raid formats. <br />
The game would progress easier. <br />
<br />
Less focus on individual classes once the CLASS SETS are balanced inside their groups. <br />
<br />
WHERE OVERLAPS in POWERS occur ie paladin/cleric, , ranger/druid, sk/necro etc... balance is teamed limited to 80% of parents main power set. <br />
Ie paladins should never exceed 80% of priest healing. Not just Cleric healing. Nor should their casting or rez ability. <br />
80% means either 80% as effective...or 20% later in levels and with slightly higher mana costs etc... <br />
<br />
This is a design issue- seperate MACRO and MICRO issues... <br />
<br />
MACRO is between CLASS SETS. <br />
MICRO is between the classes with in each class set. <br />
<br />
Two seperate issues. <br />
<br />
ONE SHOULD NOT AFFECT THE OTHER except where all powers are shared within a class set or universally amongst all classes regardless of class set they belong to. <br />
<br />
That's how simple it is folks. <br />
DESIGN 101- Step away from the MUD INFLATIONISM HANDBOOK PLEASE!</font></p>

<br />
So what, for example, does a hybrid bring to a group that another class set cannot?  If they are to be almost a requirement in a successful group then a hybrid must bring something useful to the table?<br />
And what of the casters?  There are currently 4 casters in the game, and they bring very different abilities to a group.  What skills will they be bringing to the group that cannot be replaced by another class?  Wizards for example provide DPS as their main group role, and they cannot be replaced by enchanters (in the absence of charmable pets).  Likewise enchanters cannot be replaced by a wizard.<br />
<br />
With the way the priest classes are currently set up in the game, it would not be too inconceivable to stuff them all into the same healing role in a group, with minor tweaks to provide class distinctions.  But certainly all casters could not be pushed into a DPS role without massive changes to the enchanter class (at least).<br />
<br />
In your words, hybrids provide "special abilities".  I find myself wondering what these will be, because currently hybrids provide almost nothing that can't be replicated by another class to a large degree.</font></p>

	<p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial">True, but we're looking at it in a macro way vs micro.<br />
<br />
 What each individual class brings to an encounter as that type of individual  is on a micro scale...<br />
<br />
 CC is a micro issue- it's cross class set and each type of CC is different, and useable in different situations. <br />
<br />
 Charm- Necro/druid/chanter...all have charms- others may too, of lesser sorts.<br />
<br />
 Again micro- <br />
 You can balance the individual abilities across class sets once each class set is balanced with in itself.<br />
<br />
 Micro is fine tuning...macro is game balancing issues for gameplay overall built on the 6 man team model.<br />
<br />
  5 reps, one from each class set, the sixth filled in as needed by encounter...<br />
 The situations you named, is exactly why that sixth slot is unamed.<br />
  That is a test set, that assumes the  macro-sets of each of the 5 Class sets are balanced. Not Cross balanced.<br />
<br />
 You fine tune encounters based on 5+1 groups.<br />
 The six man encounters.<br />
 Yes some group set ups would tear through an encounter another 5+1 group might not.<br />
 But that's due to min maxing.<br />
 Balance is achieved when the average 5+1 group set is able to achieve the encounter at a average rate of success.<br />
 It is that simple.<br />
 Class identity is once again a MICRO issue.<br />
 The Macro is for balance.<br />
 The Micro for cross ability sharing testing, and individual uniqueness.<br />
<br />
 The bluring that exists right now, is due mainly in part to AA's (ie optional content), and mudflation.<br />
 Runaway design shortcuts that was created by focusing on the top end of the spectrum vs the encounters.<br />
<br />
 THIS elliminated the average and sub average players from the equation by default, made some classes superfluous in any encounter and forced to solo for experience. Or forced to join a guild so they could share in the wealth of high end gear and mudinflated toys.<br />
<br />
 They need to bring the focus back to the middle.<br />
 If an average group of 5+1 can do an encounter successfully in 10 minutes, a top end focus designed group (ie Power players) should be able to do it in 5. <br />
 But also a subpar group should be able to do it successfully some of the time in 15 minutes.<br />
 All should have a chance of success and failure.<br />
<br />
 Reread my points and my follow ups. It is that easy of a solution.<br />
 What is hard is accepting the class sets at 5 alone.<br />
 And balancing with in that set up.<br />
 Then going back and balancing cross skills on the macro.<br />
<br />
 IE- what is primary mission of that class set. Then later what is primary mission with in that class set and where is that ability shared? How well should they do this? Are they the primary version of this shared ability? If so, do the others have 90% 80% 75% of that ability's primary function? Or is it limited in another way to make it different and therefor situationally useful?<br />
<br />
 Case in point as poster above mentioned- Charm spells.<br />
 Chanters have the best overall...necros do well with undead charms, and druids with animals...<br />
<br />
 pets- Lots of pet classes- Some summon some charm- what do each bring to table? Which is situational? Which is an anytime? Which is part of the class balance design? (Ie mages having to have an elemental pet up as part of the equation for their balance vs a druid who has the option of a pet or not, and the pet enhances their abilities).<br />
<br />
<br />
 Class set then the 5+1 Group model balancing then the micro balance of cross shared and unique abilities.<br />
<br />
 REZ at one time was our unique ability and not shared.<br />
 This is no longer true. balance wasn't restored.<br />
 Good heals were our unique ability, this too was infringed upon while others retained their uniqueness and shared powers. Clerics once again remained stagnant.<br />
 Healing is being further eroded as a focus unique to Clerics and once again we're faced with the imbalance with in our class set in a majority of non raid encounters and soloability.<br />
<br />
 This is where the above model is designed to force these issues to be addressed primarily, before cross contamination is even an issue to be looked upon.<br />
<br />
 So while we attempt to address healing inequality with in the PRIEST set- we must also address the rest of the issues and disparity in power not associated with healing.<br />
 Utility, soloability, spells, movement, etc.<br />

<b>So lvl X version would stun for 7 seconds for seven ticks.</b><hr></blockquote>A tick is 6 seconds, so a 7 second stun would be silly except for an extra second after the last tick. Also, this would keep the mob <b>permanently stunned</b> for 42 seconds. Really doesn't take much more than an imagination to see how this would be overpowered, even in exp group situations. Once a debuff of any sort lands, each tick cannot be seperately resisted.<br />
<br />
The idea is a good one but a better approach is even levels decrease initial resist check an additional 5 (start at -10, end at -35), and odd levels increase duration by 1 tick. 2 ticks at level 1, 6 ticks at level 9/10. Set the stun itself as a 1.0/70 stun.<br />
<br />
Starts at:<br />
2 ticks, 1.0/70 stun, -10 resist.<br />
<br />
Ends at:<br />
6 ticks, 1.0/70 stun, -35 resist.<br />
<br />
Being stunned 16% of the time for half a minute is already incredibly powerful. This should be more of a ch/gate stopper / solo tool than a serious damage reduction mechanism. Considering cleric heals are the best, one could easily argue they already reduce damage the best.</font></p>

	<p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial">The more I think about it, the more I wish every class was as specialized as warriors, clerics, rogues, and enchanters.<br />
<br />
Original EQ design required interdependence between classes to defeat higher-end mobs.  Any encounter that required a group of more than 4 party members required a representative of each class to successfully defeat.<br />
<br />
Now we are at a point where we have classes asking for the utility of other classes in order to make the game more fun or interesting for players and that is causing a lot of heated debate.<br />
<br />
I admit I'm on the side of clerics who want changes/improvements to their existing set of abilities, but I guess I've been reading these boards far too often as I'm starting to disillusion myself as to what these changes are really going to accomplish in the long run.<br />
<br />
Maybe we are approaching this wrong.  What do players complain most about?  Classes that solo stuff they cannot?<br />
<br />
If this is true, I would want some technology to be developed that tunes encounters to the individual class involved.  That way, if a mob is "soloable", any class can handle it.  Of course, this would have to mean that not everything can be solo'd so a whole new can of worms would have to be opened, but that's how the game started out anyways.<br />

	<p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial">For all your talk of macro and micro, you still havent explained what it is that the hybrid classes would bring to the group.  Or indeed the stealth classes.<br />
Your priests presumably bring healing and melees presumably bring tanking.  That is fine if no other class type can duplicate these abilities.  Casters bring dps according to you (radical change for enchanters) which is a bit of a stretch to imagine that this will guarantee them a group spot, because presumably the melees and other classes will be providing some form of DPS, albeit a lesser version.<br />
Im not sure what is left for the hybrid classes (which are these btw  would paladins be melees or hybrids) or the stealth classes.<br />
<br />
You would be better off redefining your macro classes along the lines of healer, tank, dps and crowd control making up 4 required parts of a group, with the other 2 being filled according to the requirements of a particular encounter (although probably dps would be the ones chosen for the vast majority of encounters).</font></p>

What does my ability to heal have to do with damage reduction?<br />
<br />
Look up the durations on both sound of might and tarnation. Those are the only two stuns we have that affect 55+ mobs, both take a respectable amount of time to refresh and both generate fair amounts of aggro. Those two stuns do not allow us to mitigate damage as well as a shaman who slows (10% slow is > our two pitiful stuns, especially since in the high end xp groups our stuns don't land at all).<br />

<br />
Daanya, have you ever seen the frenzied initiate in tactics while charmed, hasted, and wearing mage pet gear? Or a pooka that's charmed, hasted, and wearing mage pet gear? There's a reason charm xp got nerfed. A necro charming in CoD could pound out an AA in about 20 minutes if they were good. Enchanters could solo in tactics easily...When your pet gets low hp just click invis to animal boots, mez, mem blur, and watch pet regen to full in around four ticks. By comparison, I run a 65 wizard that's elementally geared (cleric is my main though) and kite tables in fire sometimes. It takes me considerably more than 20 minutes to do an AA there and he's got the manapool and regen to quad there if I really wanted to do it.</font></p>
