If said bard continued to yell at you and cuss t you, then tell the group that either he goes or you go.

If the other 4 people feel the bard was right, then you are better off leaving them. If the other 4 people feel the bard was wrong, you will have more fun with someone else in that 6th spot.

I think in your case, you did what you could and the rest of your group would probably come down on your side. In which case, you could do...

Proper use of this is crucial tho.  Let them vent for a moment then say, "Finished?", followed by, "OK, I did screw up(if you did)/I did what was right(if ya didn't)".  Then, "At any rate, you shouldn't go snagging the Archon, he would have fried us all.  Besides, bards aren't tanks, you have what 5hp?  Why aren't you twisting clarity song?  Don't forget to twist your haste song.  and One last thing, you should have used your resist song if you WERE going to pull the archon."

I'm still kinda new to this and don't enjoy encountering the odd *censored* who thinks I am a bad cleric. I do my best... What more can they ask for?<P>BTW I play a 54 War and consider myself a reasonable puller (anyone who has pulled in Karnors a lot becomes a good one....Either that or you are despised) Personally I have eaten MANY deaths similar to that so the party doesnt wipe.

And here I got laughed at when my second career choice was Cleric.   <IMG SRC="http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/smile.gif">  <P>I have learned to do the best I can healing.  Sounds like you did your best in a bad situation.  Most times in dungeons you need to expect pulls to go wrong.  Should the puller not realize this let them die.  Sometimes you will find great pullers that will either zone or die a bad pull rather then kill the group.  My personal pulling philosophy was "Baby Steps".  Just start out small and once you know what your doing can take big chances.<P>As I try very hard to stay in dungeons I see a lot of death.  Death for the puller, party and myself.  The main thing the group with me knows, is that the Enchanter lives and the Tank (read warrior) lives.  I am going to let the rangers, rogues, bards, etc die should the going get ugly.  We have done some amazing things.  We have all died horribly too.

HOWEVER!  My lord Bristlebane gave me several skills for avoiding heal-death... some you have, and some you do not have... Divine Aura and Barrier come to mind right away.  High HP (from your buffs - you get a big boost at 34 with the new Armor of Protection spell).<P>Anyhow, point is, look at each situation... dying for nothing is worth nothing.  Just don't be afraid to heal and take a chance sometimes, otherwise you won't make it later when every heal has a chance of getting your arse whooped.</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#dedfdf"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Tarf</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">I have a very good monk friend who taught me how to heal pulling monks.  Her rule is not to heal her until she says it is ok.  Or she brings it into camp.  If she is dying 10 feet away from camp, then my job is to watch her.  She knows which pulls she wants to bring in, and which pulls she wants to eat.  She is a joy to hunt with.<P>I hunted with another monk in Droga one day.  He pulled a number of mobs, tried to feign 15 feet away and died.  I stood there and watched.  Next thing I knew he was giving me a really hard time.  A very fine cleric in his guild took care of the situation.  I told him that if he wanted a pull, to bring it into camp, if he wanted to eat the death then he needed to stay out of camp.  Still, I am very grateful to the cleric in his guild who explained the situation to him so I didn't have to.<P>Before I met the best pulling monk in the world, I had no idea what pullers were supposed to do.  Now when I pull with my alts, I know that sometimes the puller simply has to eat the death and go on.  It is part of the job.  Some people of all ages are immature.  Do not feel guilty because someone else doesn't know how to play intelligently.<P>The best way to handle that situation is to have someone else in your group step up and tell the bard to get over it.  The bard wanted to fight with you.  Let someone else tell the bard he is an idiot.  It will diffuse the situation much more.  Or, follow some of the very helpful suggestions on this thread   <IMG SRC="http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/smile.gif"><P>Tarf</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#f7f7f7"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Nige Willowleaf</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">when he is finished.....<P>"wow man, I am SOOOO sorry you died.
