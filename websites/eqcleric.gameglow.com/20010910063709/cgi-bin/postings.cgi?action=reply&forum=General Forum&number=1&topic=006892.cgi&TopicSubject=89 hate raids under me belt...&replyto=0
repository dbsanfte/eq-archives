[B]And I can FINALLY say I have nearly everything from Hate I could ever want. 

Yesterday, I got a 2nd bracer (bagged, for the +9 cha), a Truesight Hammer (bagged, unless I go to the Hole, I guess. Procs Banish Summoned.), and the EM LEGS. Of course, each and every one of these items were DEFAULTED to me, so I STILL to this day have yet to win a lotto on EM. However, I aint complaining. 

And we are going back today, and if a BP drops, that is defaulted to me as well. Last item, and the other 3 clerics on this 3 day raid have BP's.

They were both awarded to me but it is also important to note that I had been on 18 previous raid without any loot awards at all. Waiting and not calling "aye" on every piece of cleric equipment that dropped payed off for me. I have passed on several other pieces of EM because I either had better, had comparable, didn't want, or wanted to make sure somebody else got. I got a Prismatic shield on our last Hate raid because we had like 4 drop and everybody else had one (I still prefer my SBS). I passed on a Helm because I had a Guardian Helm (fairly comparable, and I like the stats better) and because another cleric up there had been on several Hate raids and had never gotten anything (not a cleric from our guild, and had never attended a PoH raid with us.. but had gone with us before on other raids).<P>Perhaps I have missed something, but I don't remember the stats of most of the EM pieces as particularly giving me a "must have" kinda feeling. I am probably missing something tho.<P>I do want to congratulate you Dikmer! I remember previous discussions on EM where you had lamented the fact that you had poor luck on obtaining those elusive items. Congratulations! Those legs are quite nice indeed  <IMG SRC="http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/smile.gif"> WOOT !  Here is hoping you get the BP tonight *crosses his fingers for Dikmer and knocks on Spawrhawk...ooops, i mean wood*<P> <IMG SRC="http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/smile.gif"><P><P>------------------<BR>Panteroo Mcgillakudy<BR>Patriarch of the Patron Saints<BR>Fennin Ro</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#dedfdf"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Islington</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial"> <BLOCKQUOTE><font size="1" face="Verdana, Arial">quote:</font><HR>Are you guys wanting the EM just for the looks or do you want the stats off the *other* pieces? <HR></BLOCKQUOTE><P>I only take pieces that are upgrades for myself.  On our last Hate raid, we had the following drop: Breastplate (which I was defaulted), 2 Bracers, Boots, Greaves.  The Boots dropped first and as soon as they were announced and to send the Loot master a tell, I immediately shouted "Congrats Cleric_02"  3 Clerics on the raid and only 1 needed them.  Greaves and one of the Bracers were the same way, the Greaves were not an upgrade and a Bracer only a marginal one so one Cleric got Greaves, Boots, and a Bracer.<P>As for the Bracers, I like the +20 mana on them.  I am at 200 WIS exactly so extra WIS is useless but extra mana is good.  Getting the Breastplate was a huge thing for me.  28 AC, 25 mana, and 15 WIS allowed me to really play with my equipment and go for more AC/HP/Mana/Resist items.<P>The only other piece I have is the Arms which I like for the STR and the SV Magic.  Up until very recently, I was fighting encumberance issues non-stop and those Vambs really helped in that area.<P>------------------<BR>Quistil Angelwatch<BR>Vicar of 53 Seasons in the service to the Great Mother Tunare<BR>Islington Angelwatch (Retired)<BR>Cavalier of 53 Seasons in the glorious service to Erollisi Marr<BR>Phoenix Crusaders</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#f7f7f7"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Xodd</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">89 raids!

I'm sure there are other uses but I have a bag in the bank that is all CHA to help me when I'm buying and selling in town. Sure helps when you buy peridots at 10.5pp instead of 11+ pp. Not to mention, they also have mana on them... whacka whacka. Can always use those!<P>As far as all the other pieces of EM /shrug. Good for resist gear. I wouldn't mind the helm simply for the disease resist (my hardest resist to get up unbuffed). With the ever increasing high end raids, everyone's key phrase lately it seems is "resist gear, resist gear". <P>Personally, I think the only MUST HAVE (read: Oh my gawd, it's 5 in the morning and I'm still on this raid! Give me something that I can actually use for DAILY use!) that would be the breastplate and legs.

I get to Hate about once every 2 to 3 months.  And thats fine.  I really am not a raid type person.

Yes it does not stack up against many newer items in the game now.  But for me its an achievable goal and any piece I am fortunate to get is a major item to me.
