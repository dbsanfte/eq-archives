This ability does not lessen the chance of scoring a critical hit with<br>                             Alternate Experience abilities that grant criticals <br><br>                        Client/Interface<br><br>                             Added /dopropertinting command. This command allows you to turn on and off the<br>                             "DoProperTinting" option in the eqclient.ini file. Activating this command should correct<br>                             most tinting issues (such as armor tint also tinting the character's skin). But if it<br>                             causes issues you can toggle it off by using /dopropertinting off <br>                             Added /chat commands, that allow players to create their own chat channels. Please<br>                             read the eqmanual_supplement.doc in your EverQuest directory for more information <br>                             Added /hitsmode command. This command allows you to more finely control how you<br>                             see hits, including seeing them in a window other than your chat window. Please see<br>                             the eqmanual_supplement.doc for more details <br>                             Added /clearhits to clear the current hits in the M2-M5 modes of the /hitsmode<br>                             command. Again, please see the eqmanual_supplement for more information <br>                             Added /showgrass command. This toggles the radial flora (Luclin only) on and off <br>                             Added options in the Options screen (under Chat Filter) for filtering out Melee and Spell<br>                             criticals. Options are All/Me/Off. These can also be activated using the /filter<br>                             command, and will affect critical hit, critical blast, exceptional heal, and crippling blow<br>                             messages <br>                             Changed /filter to allow you to toggle the various chat filter settings (still also lets you<br>                             toggle the badwords filter) <br>                             Changed /channel to allow you to set your default chat channel.

"Can not use Mend for x seconds" can still appear,<br>                             but you now should be able to use mend at the appropriate time <br>                             Fixed bug in the client that caused a "You are out of Ammo message" even when you<br>                             still had ammo <br>                             Messages should no longer be lost while you are zoning <br>                             Corpses that are made to appear at the "safe spot" of a zone for any reason can now<br>                             be moved using /corpse as long as the person using the command has /consent for<br>                             that corpse <br>                             Added "AllLuclinPcModelsOff" line to the eqclient.ini file which, if set to TRUE, will skip<br>                             the loading of all of the Luclin PC models (except the Vah Shir, which always gets<br>                             loaded no matter what this is set to). This should allow players to set the loading of<br>                             each race and sex individually for their normal game play, but then quickly turn all<br>                             models off for a raid or other such circumstances <br>                             Added /rtarget function (can be used as /rt). This function targets the last character<br>                             to send you a /tell. It follows all of the rules for /target <br>                             Messages sent to you while you are zoning should be saved and sent to you when you<br>                             reach the other side of the zone.

<blockquote>

Pets will now, when close to you, STOP.<br>- Many higher level NPCs now have a random delay before they initially spawn. This means that they will appear at a more random time interval after servers or zones are brought up. This is designed to provide a fairer distribution of these NPCs across all time zones<br>- If you right click to auto-inventory an item that you are looting and it will not fit into your inventory, the item will simply appear on your cursor as if you had left clicked on it<br><br><br>** Gameplay Related **<br><br>- NPC and PC corpses can now be /considered to find out how long until they decay, and PC corpses additionally tell you how long you have to resurrect them<br>- The timer for corpses is now seven days for any corpse over level five, whether the player is on-line or off-line or any combination of the two<br>- Characters below level eight will no longer see light blue cons<br>- Spires will no longer try to teleport you to Luclin if you do not own the expansion, and therefore will no longer move you to the 'safe point' in the zone when it can't take you to the Nexus<br>- Pets can now be targeted by typing their full name after the /target command (or at least enough of it to distinguish it from the owner)<br>- Knockback now works correctly when on a horse<br>- Summoning a horse in Plane of Sky will no longer allow you to levitate<br>- Gating when in the same zone that you are bound no longer causes problems<br>- Horses will no longer disappear when a character is moved to the 'safe point'<br><br><br>** Trade Skill Related **<br><br>- Added several trade skill items to Grobb; including a brewing supply vendor, a brew barrel, a baking vendor, a standard forge, a pottery cooking mold vendor, a kiln, a pottery wheel, and a sketch vendor.<br>- Added water flasks to two merchants in the Bazaar<br>- Added high quality ore vendors to Bazaar, Kaladim, and Qeynos that sell a limited supply of HQ Ore<br>- Fixed an inconsistency with the armor class of Enchanted Imbued Dwarven Plate compared to the armor class of other Dwarven-smithed plate armor<br>- Batwing Pie, Bug Bites and Deadly Medley now exist<br>- Repaired the recipe for Superior Gnomish Spirits\Gnomish Cleaning Substance<br>- Increased the drop rates of cultural armor temper components<br>- Added hilt mold vendors to more cities<br><br><br>** Quest Related **<br><br>- Made adjustments to the Whistling Fists quest<br>- Reduced the spawn time of the Zordak Ragefire in SoldungB.

It is not immune to spells though, just extremely resistant.<br>- Warcry should now work properly<br>- Life Burn now considers hit points from items and should no longer be interrupted<br>- Area Taunt should be no longer affect creatures on heights or floors above and below the warrior<br><br><br>** Discipline Related **<br><br>- Added the following /disciplines for Beastlords: <br>Level 51: The Discipline of Resistant<br>Level 54: The Discipline of Fearless<br>Level 55: The Discipline of Protective Spirit<br>Level 60: The Discipline of Bestial Rage<br><br><br>** Item Related **<br><br>- Expendable items no longer use mana when 'casting' a spell<br>- Extra damage from either elemental or bane damage should now work for special attacks like backstab<br>- Shield of Auras can now be used by Necromancers<br>- All pieces of Black Pantherskin Armor are now Beastlord useable<br>- Steelsilk Helm should now be visible when using the new models<br>- Windspeeder's haste is now a permanent effect<br>- Shield of Mental Fortitude is now actually a shield and also has a different graphic<br>- Drape of the Deep Thinker now has a robe texture when equipped<br>- Orb of Lost Souls can no longer be "Held"<br>- Dark Cloak of the Sky from 'worn to activate' to 'Race/Class to activate'. The previous change that made it 'worn to activate' was an error. <br>- Items that add bonuses to the Lock Pick skill should function properly now<br><br><br>** Firiona Vie **<br><br>- The Trivial Loot Code present on the Roleplaying server will no longer affect items that are marked solely with the No-Drop flag. No-Drop items that are also Magic or Lore will continue to behave as they did prior to this patch.<br><br>- The EverQuest Team<br><br><br>** Tales **<br><br>Grand Master Glox sat silently staring into the black waters of the Cabilis aqueducts, his thoughts tracing and retracing the recent visions that had upset his nights. The Lord Cazic was trying to tell him something, but he could not yet decipher what it was. The hand on his shoulder startled him and he turned quickly, striking the intruder with a quick blow to the chest. The figure crumpled to the cold ground.<br><br>Glox stood over him with a look of horror, it was one of his own pupils he had struck. He lay bloodied and bruised at Glox's feet breathing heavily with much effort, he was obviously dying. The pupil reached up toward Glox with something in his hand. Glox took the items from his hand and peered at them intently. There were two items, one was a glistening serpentine scale, the other an ancient stone symbol. Glox recognized the symbol almost immediately with horror. It was the symbol of the Soriz, the ancient Iksar tribe that had been the slaves of the Shissar empire. Glox looked down at his pupil again. "Where did you get this?" The dying Iksar used his last ounce of energy to point up toward the night sky and the moon of Luclin. "sSs... Ssraeshza... has... returned..."<br><br><br>** A Call to Arms! **<br><br>Have you long dreamed of aiding your fellow adventurer? Do you enjoy travelling the world and meeting new and interesting people? Are you over the age of 18 with an EverQuest account in good standing and some free time? If so, then the EverQuest Guide Program may be for you! If you feel compelled to join our ranks, point your web browser to <a href="https://guide.everquest.com/guideapp/">https://guide.everquest.com/guideapp/</a> and fill out an application!<br><br>February 4th<br>------------------------------<br><br>** Changes to the EverQuest patcher **<br><br><br>A little while ago we combined our Test patcher with our Live patcher. The intent was to remove the confusion that having two patchers can cause and to encourage more people to play on the Test server.<br><br>Well, we're going back to the old way. We are going to split the Test patcher and the Live patcher back into two separate programs.<br><br>This means that in order to access the Test Server you will need to run TestEverQuest.exe, which you will find in your EverQuest directory. To play on the Live Servers just start EverQuest as you always have.<br><br>There are a few advantages to separating the two patchers. Splitting them up makes it a little easier, as a player, to be sure that you are headed to the right server when you double click the icon. It's also a little more intuitive for those that want to run the game in two directories.<br><br>Using two directories for EverQuest does use up a lot of hard drive space. However, for those with enough space that play regularly on both Test and on Live servers, this is a safer and faster way to work. Using the same directory means that each time you change servers (Live to Test or Test to Live) you will have to patch. The data on the Test Server is very rarely the same as that on Live servers.<br><br>And for us internally it makes it easier to test new patchers. It gives us one more step for testing. Now we can push a patcher to the Test Server and try it out there after internal testing and before it goes to the Live servers.<br><br>In any case, we've decided to move back to the old way. Starting on Monday, February 4th, 2002 you will need to run TestEverQuest.exe to patch and play on the Test server, and Everquest.exe to patch and play on the Live servers.<br><br>* Patch Message Addendum *<br><br>The command line argument "/test" should no longer be used to play on the Test Server. Anyone using this should remove this argument from their shortcut. Please manually select "TestServer" from the Advanced Options window to use the Test Server. On Monday, February 4th, TestEverQuest.exe will once again be used to patch and play on the Test Server.<br><br><br>- The EverQuest Team<br></blockquote></p>

Please see the Developer's Corner on our web site for more details<br>- Added Quest NPCs to Thurgadin, Kael and Skyshrine for Beastlord quest armor<br>- Gravel leaf tea will now fit in the combine container for the associated quest<br>- Grimling Blood should now be dropping<br>- Idia in the bard guild in Kelethin was telling you to turn in a quest item to the incorrect NPC.

Many of the items had AC that was inconsistent with the armor types of the classes.  The AC has been reduced on some pieces and raised on others.  In all instances where the AC was dropped a different statistic was raised.  Several items received a significant upgrade while others were downgraded<br>- Also in regards to Umbral Plains armor, Ranger has been removed from the plate class armor that was dropping and have been added to the usable classes on the chain equivalent.  Bards have been added to the plate equipment list.  This might mean that some Rangers will have armor that they can't use.  Our Customer Service personnel will trade out that armor for the chain equivalent<br>- Ghoulbane is now No-Drop<br>- SoulFire charges can only be used by Paladins (though they can be used from inventory)<br>- Raised the armor value on many Beastlord specific armor pieces<br>- Added effects to a few of the Wild Lord's armor pieces<br>- Added Vah Shir to Imbrued Plate Mail useable races<br>- Rhino Hide armor is now Druid and Monk usable<br>- The Crustacean Shell Shield is now magic<br>- Scroll of Knowledge can now be equipped in the primary, secondary, and range slots<br>- Scroll of Enlightenment can now be equipped in the primary, secondary, and range slots<br>- Thought Horror Fangs can now be thrown<br>- Iron Scroll of War must now be worn to activate<br>- Cloak of Thorns right click effect should work now<br>- Runed Bone Fork is now equippable primary, secondary and ranged.  The "range" value has been removed to prevent people from accidentally throwing them<br>- Spider Fur Collar has been given weight 0.0 to be consistent with other pieces<br>- Dark Cloak of the Sky must now be worn to activate<br>- Sage's Crown is now No-Drop to match every other Velious quest armor<br>- Icicle Circlet is now No-Drop to match every other Velious quest armor<br>- Bone Collar of the Possessed should no longer cause players to crash when inventory is opened<br>- Idol of Rallos Zek can now be used by ShadowKnights<br>- Helm of Grim Blessings can now be used by Wood Elves<br>- Flayed Skin Bracer is no longer a Lore item<br>- Greaves of Avoidance can now be used by all races<br>- Steel Threaded Wrist Wraps are no longer lore<br>- Bravado's Breastplate now grants a larger Hit Point bonus<br>- Guise of the Hunter can now also be worn by human bards and rogues <br>- Primal Cudgel now has the proper effect<br>- Added "Recommended Level" equal to the current item use level for the several items.  All of these items require the player to be level 51+ to equip them and/or use their effects.  Setting the "Recommended Level" field like this just lets the player know what level they need to be to use the item.  The actual utility of the item was not affected in any way, this change is purely informational<br>- Several items have been changed to be not useable by Iksar.  They had been erroneously set as Iksar useable in the last item patch.  These were primarily items that were usable by Beastlords (and were therefore changed to allow all Beastlord races to use them), but that had been specifically restricted from use by Iksar due to their inherent armor value<br><br><br>** Zones **<br><br>- Shades in Umbral, Maiden's Eye and Vex Thall are now considered undead<br>- Placed portals to and from Great Divide and Nexus<br>- Added many new items to better round out the rewards for high-level Luclin encounters<br><br><br>** Horses **<br><br>- Implemented horse trade in quests.

                          Normally this isn't something I'd do. But, well, I'm going to outline the changes we're making to this quest in rather<br>                          close detail. But first, let me try to explain the concern that players had with this quest.<br><br>                          With arguably the most popular Epic Quest item, the Cleric trying to gain his Epic item usually finds plenty of people<br>                          to help in the process. Clerics are commonly the first in line with guilds to help with their epic quests. So Clerics<br>                          tend to get further in their epic quest faster than many others. This has lead to a very nasty 'bottleneck' for<br>                          Clerics trying to complete the quest. The Ragefire portion of the quest has been creating a lot of static among<br>                          players.<br><br>                          So we have decided to make a change to the end portion of this quest. To reduce confusion and to help people<br>                          understand why we're making this change, I'm going to give out a few specific details. These changes will go Live<br>                          with the patch tonight.<br><br>                          For those that are not interested in quest details, consider the rest of this post SPOILER INFORMATION:<br><br><br>                          First, the 'merchant' version of Zordak will now appear at a different location in SoldungB. He will appear once each<br>                          day (except after a server comes down, then he will spawn in one to three days). The appearance of this NPC will<br>                          no longer require the absence of Lord Nagafen.<br><br>                          The cleric still turns in his Shimmering Pearl to Zordak. But now the merchant Zordak will return a Swirling Pearl to<br>                          the Cleric and disappear.<br><br>                          At that point the Cleric will need to head out and look for him. A killable version of Zordak will appear independent<br>                          of the pearl turn-in every few days (except after a server goes down, then he will appear a little faster). Killing<br>                          Zordak will transform him into dragon form, and the Cleric (with help&#8230;) must kill him immediately.<br><br>                          The new dragon Zordak will drop a heart that is a container that requires the Swirling Pearl to be combined in it to<br>                          create the Heart that is turned in to Omat.<br><br>                          The rest of the quest remains the same.<br><br><br>                          The goal of these changes is to reduce the problems with the bottleneck that existed before. They will not remove<br>                          that bottleneck, but hopefully will remove the nasty competition for a single spawn with so many people willing to<br>                          be&#8230; rude to each other.<br><br>Alan<br><br><br><br><br>*Very interesting in my opinion.  I don't know how many times we have complained about this and asked that this be changed and lo and behold, we now have a different ending.  Way to go Verant.<br>                          </blockquote></p>

First, due to the many generous donations received, this site is in no danger of disappearing any time soon.  EQCleric is currently funded through February, 2002.  I'll re-evaluate the available options in March.<br><br>Second, let's look at the available options.<br><ol><li>Cheap hosting: I'm (well you =P) currently paying $50/month for space and bandwidth.  While our storage needs are negligble, our bandwidth requirements are not.  Many people have written me about $10/month hosting sites with unlimited bandwidth.  Those sites offering unlimited bandwidth are generally lying.  If one looks hard those sites always have a disclaimer about a bandwidth cap at which point they start charging.  In all of the cases I looked at this site would have bandwidth overruns and have cost me (us) considerably more than $50/month.  So we're getting this site for a very reasonable fee.</li><br><li>Free hosting: Several people have written me offering completely free hosting including one individual who wishes to take over the site.  My inclination is come March, 2002 to take of one of them up on their offer.  I'll post more about it next year.</li></ol><br><br>So, thanks again for your support in keeping this site alive and enjoy your adventures in Norrath.<br><br>Signing out from Camelot,<br>Rayne</blockquote></p>
