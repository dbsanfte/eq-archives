Just don't equip it when you're around level 56+ clerics without one.  I remember having to Atone myself cause I wanted to strangle the lil runt cleric with a clicker (no offense)   :)

58 Templar without Grudges, Sol Ro[/b][/QUOTE]

"First off Fuz, I understand the intent behind your post...this isn't directed towards you, but towards anyone who might be feeling the way you're jokingly acting. Plus it gives me another chance to show thanks for the people who helped me."

In my own defense, I would probably *be* level 56+, possibly 60, if it wasn't for all the quests, raids, tradeskills, corpse runs (as in, for people other than my group), etc, etc that are as much fun for me (sometimes more) than exp camps-I get bored easy, so I tend to find the time to do things like log on my buddy's druid while he's home for Thanksgiving and go sit in Ubugs for 40+ hours while checking track-no exp for me, but he was DAMN happy with that gold I got him in 57 =P I think he's upset that I got my epic...less free exp for him-heheh. 

I've gotten a few "what are you doing camping Rage/with your epic at level 51" tells already, but since they tend to come from the twink-number-four-since-my-guild-can't-hold-on-to-clerics-and-my-other-twinks-are-level-60-already crowd, I just smile and tell them "I did the same quest everyone else has to for it-you exp, I quest-seems like we're both doing what we love". Anyone 50+ can get their epic-I started mine at level 45 and soloed Shmendrik and Lord G before I dinged 50-did them solo so my friends wouldn't have to sit bored outta their skulls in a camp getting no exp (camp took me 30 hours, BTW). I camped for an EB earring for about 5 days before I realized I could just make the f00king money to buy it faster by soloing in ToFS. Spent 15 hours over two days in the depths of Lake Rathe with whatever druid who needed their epic or kind ranger I could find to come harmony pull for me-again to spare my friends and guildies the painful monotony of this camp. I was ready for Ixi when my guild hit him because of this. I was fortunate enough to be the second cleric in the combination seniority/epic-progression list for the singed scroll who showed up when we hit Chardok after I spent 5 days gaining three blue of exp, a bit of loot, and giving up hunting in one of the better exp/loot zones in the game to gain faction so we would have a non-KOS cleric to scout and CR if needed. And I left Higar at 1.5 blue to ding 52 for a week while I camped Rage as a druid tracking so I didn't have to bug my guild every 7 hours to come clear FGs, knowing full-well that another cleric could show up 5 minutes before Zord spawned to take the camp and I wouldn't have been able (or wanted) to do anything but wish him luck-gave the camp up once to a FD monk of one of those "I'm on my 4th or 5th twink now" types, cause I knew his guild would probably be able to mobilize faster than mine if he spawned and I couldn't very well say "your invalid camp is less valid than my invalid camp".

So, in my mind at least, and in the minds of my guildmates and friends who stood with me and cheered for me, I have NO doubt that I *earned my epic*, no matter what my level may be. I wouldn't have been able to do this without having friends and guildies who believe in me, even if I had been level 60-this epic may boost my stats, but they're the true winners and it belongs as much or more to them as it does me. Clerics (warriors, druids, mages, chanters, necros, wizards, rogues, rangers, paladins, shadow knights, shaman (well, OK-shaman can get theirs without alot of outside help-eheh) don't get epics, guilds and close friends do. The benefits to a person's guild almost always outweigh the benefits to an individual by far. Someone else said it best:

"An epic is an expression of the friendship and love a guild holds for its members, not the accomplishment of an individual."

Ok, got much more serious that I intended there-its an emotional time-I'm still getting a bit choked up when I think about all the people who helped me out-for a much more light-hearted view on all of this, go check out [URL=http://pub41.ezboard.com/funitedguildsofdrinalfrm1.showMessage?topicID=616.topic]this post[/URL]. Hope it makes ya smile =)
