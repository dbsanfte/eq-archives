[B] [QUOTE]I'm thinking no newbies are goning to head to a Legends server; only people in the higher level game who are hardcore, and have more disposable income.[/QUOTE]
Actually, I doubt that "hardcore" correlates with "have more disposable income."  Hardcore players tend to have very high play time, which means they're less likely to have a full-time job.  Also, as Varya noted, hardcore players are very dependent on their guilds, so it's hard for them to move unless their entire guild is willing to pay the premium price.  My guess is that the premium server's population will be older and more casual than the others.

Personally, I don't have a problem with the "pay more, get more" concept, but I don't see anything about the "Legends" program that justifies a quadrupling of the price.[/B][/QUOTE]

Of the 8000 people that do move there, how many will be L1 - 30 newbs?  Probably not many, most will have L50+ char's already.  I'm curious how much contention there will be for NToV, ST, and such.  Maybe entire guilds will try to transfer over maybe not, would be interesting to see if the guilds that are on servers dominated by Afterlife, FOH, etc try to make a mass switch.<P>What about the cap of 8000 limited players base?  No problem, as long as you dont mind not being able to play with RL friends that start playing after you transfer or dont make the cut over with you, or else you get to pay the $50 move fee and go naked, or better yet, start over naked and L1.<P><BR>Oh and for the record, there would be plenty of money to hire enough Developers for the Live team to fix all the bugs, test future patches, and do the dynamic content they've promised all along if Sony would stop using EQ profits to fund non EQ projects.<P>/rude Soveirgn<BR>/rude SWG<BR>/rude Planetside<P><BR>When does SB come out?<P>------------------<BR><A HREF="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=18964" TARGET=_blank>Grumbles</A></FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#f7f7f7"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Thotam</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Well for $40 a month is must be good, that is like buying a new game everymonth, a bit much but shure it sounds nice enough, but if this means that the old server will see less gm's and less events(if possible) it sucks mayor dino butt.<P>And as many have been pointing out there are lot of things to fix before adding this server.<P>I do like that the server keep tracks on your items, having trouble today keeping my magelo/allakhazam char info updated..<P>Also the dynamic maps looks like a nice feature(if it will work) <P>And i did like the "for just $39.95 per month" part, $40 bucks per month is a rather big sum, i can't afford that, or maybe i can but there is no way i can justify that for playing a game(not even to myself)<P><BR>------------------<BR>/Thotam lvl 5 DE cleric Antonius Bayle<P>[This message has been edited by Thotam (edited 02-02-2002).]<p>[This message has been edited by Thotam (edited 02-02-2002).]</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#dedfdf"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Twinskey Bab0linskey</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Their goal of 2,400 or so avg online seems real crowded to me.
