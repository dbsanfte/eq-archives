<TEXTAREA NAME="EditedMessage" ROWS=10 COLS=45 WRAP="VIRTUAL">Dikmer,

Welcome back to the EQ boards. Since the demise of Whineplay, people seem to be venting here and on other boards.

You wanted an opinion and you got it. I don't see why you're so upset. Some people agreed with you, others thought you were greedy. It's par for the course, really.

I've been trying for 2 months to get Verant to change our epic quest. EVERY time I make a public post somewhere I hear

"The cleric epic is the most common epic in the game"
"The cleric epic is too easy"
"That's why they call this an EPIC quest"
"We shouldn't ask for a fix because there are other classes who need fixes more than us"

Every time I read one I want to scream and pull my hair out. They are either ill considered or incorrect. I wanna just throw up my hands and shout "OK! YOU WIN! I'LL JUST SIT HERE QUIETLY AND TAKE COMFORT IN THE FACT THAT MY EPIC QUEST IS TOO EASY DESPITE THE FACT THAT I MAY NEVER FINISH IT"

I know frustration well...

But then I remember why I post. I remember that random tell from out of the blue thanking me for my posts here. Ultimately, inevitably, someone learns something from all this. And it makes it all worth it.

Your post about NBG was enlightening, not only because of your posts but other peoples' as well. We got to look at the various ways to view NBG and how it's supposed to work in theory. We found that some agreed and some disagreed with you. It's what these boards are for.

You left the game and came back. You used the extra boots to repay kindness and fortunately got a second pair. You weren't familiar with NBG. And apparently your group had 0 problem with you getting a second pair. Yeah, some people have problems with that. Yeah, it was technically an abuse of NBG. But you learned. People have learned harder lessons on these boards. Just ask Rayne...

If you want to stop posting because you're tired then fine. But don't say you're going to stop because people didn't agree with you. Yes, you got publically burned by some but think about how many people who just lurk or couldn't even muster the courage to post learned right along with you.

This is THE only place to truly discuss cleirc issues and ONLY cleric issues. Everywhere else you must yell over 13 other classes. And soon, it may be gone forever, yet another victim of the Great Internet Crash of 2001.

You are very respected here, Dikmer. People listen to you. They like your posts. They like to hear how you're doing. It's a community (in the loosest sense of the word).

Don't go, Dikmer...
