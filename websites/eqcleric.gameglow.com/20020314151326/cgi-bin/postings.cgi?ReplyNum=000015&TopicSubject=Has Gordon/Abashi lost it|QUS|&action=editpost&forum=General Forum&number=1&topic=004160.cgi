<TEXTAREA NAME="EditedMessage" ROWS=10 COLS=45 WRAP="VIRTUAL">A)I think people overestimate Abashi's influence greatly. Seems obvious to me no important balance and gameplay decisions are made without careful discussion amongst a team of people, a team of which Abashi wasn't even a part of until months after release. This the reason why it took so long for Rangers to be fixed. Sure Abashi might dismiss things out of hand, but from what I've seen its usually only when the answer that the EQ team would return is clear and/or well known (IE hybrid exp, melee binding). There's no point in going back to the team on certain issues when you know what they are going to say. Whether or not you agree with Verant's stance on these issues, I don't think Abashi has enough influence to change Verant's mind on certain things no matter how much he tried.

B)He's been getting constantly flamed and ridiculed for a long time. I think its perfectly within his right to say "I will not even respond to you if you insult me or my coworkers." This is the only thing that I've noticed lately that is significantly different from what he used to do. If it were me, my only response would be "*(#@ off"

C)He communicates completely in text. Think about this. So much is lost when the only medium you can communicate in is with tiny little symbol. What is lost is replaced in the reader's own mind. If you have developed a mental image of Abashi as a condescending prick, everything he says will re-inforce that perception you have. It doesn't matter if Abashi's job started being handled by Mother Theresa, you'd still interpret his replies as rude and arrogant.

Slightly off topic: I often hear people criticize Verant saying they don't communicate with the players. Name one decent size company, anywhere, ever, in this industry or any other industry on the planet that has that communicates with its consumer base as much as Verant does. Have you ever had a discussion with McDonald's top brass about the recipe for their Big Mac? How many times has some top exec from Chevy ever gone to a message board and started a thread on ideas to improve their product? Only thing I can think of is maybe some other companies developing MMORPG's, of course its easy to do this when all you have to talk about is promises and potential without substance.

One more thing I'd like to ad:
"The guy is human after all, and I have never read a post of his I couldnt at least see the point in, if not totally agree."

Damn straight Seliris.
