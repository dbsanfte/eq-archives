<TEXTAREA NAME="EditedMessage" ROWS=10 COLS=45 WRAP="VIRTUAL">Sorry Naz, but druids are also complaining about their AA. Even paladins are complaining about their AA (that they got both Arch and therefor would be penilized to have to get more to be equal. Their current weekly argument).

I agree, cleric AA blow goats in the forest. Only reason I will get any is to get the new title. Same for mage (MGB and 1 group spell, DS) and necro (one group spell, Dead MEN floating, rare drop in Chardok, 49 spell). So saying clerics got bad AA aint exactly true, most non hybrids do.

You did not read my reply in another thread, I love to give druids CH. Why? because that would remove alot of preassure and burn out. There is a reason why EVERY uberguild is constantly looking for more clerics over any other class. Give them CH, I love to see them cry how boring it is in the CH chain. But if they get it so do I expect that clerics recive a huge buff in soloing/grouping that we lack now. And that is something I love, to stop having to have the CH hang infront of me everytime there is talk about balance and told you are to powerfull, you are to powerfull bend over for nerfbat. I love to be able just for once be able to bring my alt ranger to a raid instead of beeing told to log on my cleric because we are low on cleric this night and every other night.

Some clerics see the give away CH and see red screaming it is ours, it is ours go away. Well we lost everything else step by step, we where the only one to be able to exp ress, not anymore. We where the only once with group heals, not anymore. We still are superior to hp buff but that is a one cleric job at most with MGB and we got to sit in a CH chain on raids. I love to trade some of that need on raids for more soloing/grouping power that we lost. I love to be able to log on knowing that if there is a raid going to start so will there not be a DEMAND that I come to play...

Critical heal is the same as critical nuke or critical hit. Eyecandy. Sure it is nice for druids if they land it but they can in no way count on it. And it got some use but you never depend on it, nor do druids.

As for the druid class AA:
Quick Evac, last time I evaced was something like 1 year ago.
Quick damage, get bracer + ring. They cant do damage as they are usually healing due to lack of clerics so very limited use.
Enchanted root, umm they quadd if they do exp not root and nuke. It only affects the druids nukes as well so very limited use.
Dire Charm OF ANIMALS. How often do you find high level animals that is 46 but not higher and down? Kael, maybe WW if lucky, Chardok about the only times and that is assuming you want to deal with the pet pathing and they cant buff it...
Innate invis, we get the vs undead and they get vs regular. We had other invis before so I dont see the big deal with it. Got some uses but how often do a druid run invis? I as cleric without snare/sow dont even use invis except the rare occasions I am running through Kael.
Exodus, how often do you hear in a raid in Ssra EVAC EVAC!!! Most raids prefer everyone to die at the spot for ress in because it is faster...

So I say what I said before, give CH to druids, give clerics some real soloing power and not the earlier jokes. It would also stop the pointing of fingers that clerics got CH and is therefor balanced and should shut up, let the druids have to deal with everyone demanding them to come, let them deal with taking rampage damage in the CH chain (=.
