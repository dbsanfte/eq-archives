I get a tell from someone saying something like &quot;Hey I died in Chardok, think you could come rez me?&quot;  I have to say no, as I am getting ready to raid Hate.  This person comes back with all kinds of nonsense..&quot;I can pay you.. I am right at the zoneout..C'mon it'll take you 5 minutes..&quot;  On and on.  <br />
Another time, 12 of us are running through WK on the way to Perma for some warrior epic pieces.  I get a tell &quot;Can you come rez me and friend in SK?&quot;  Tell them no. Explain why.  They say, but I can pay you 50pp for both, and give you SOW! (Ooohh)  I say, Sorry, but I am not going to hold up 11 other people while I run out of my to help you.  Get called names..told &quot;But I lost 52 (or whatever).  My reaction to that is..WTF are you doing in SK in your 50's that caused you to die and lose your level?  /ignore.<br />

I am never anonymous and very rarely get asked for resses.  I am usually pretty busy so I will end up telling them if they can drag the corpse to me I can res it.  That prolly keeps most of em from saying anything else.  At least the ones that don't send any replies back.  I did have one bad experience though.  Was fighting in the Captain room in Karnor's and had just been there for a short time.  Things were going great and I was near full mana.  Got a tell from a monk asking if I could res.  I said sure and he dragged the corpse to me.  (I got no donation and not even a thank you) Was not his corpse either.  About 15 minutes later he shows up with another corpse at my feet.  Nother monk.  And tells me to res it.  At that point it had become very hectic and I was barely able to keep up with all the pops that had been happening and was never able to get over 40 mana.  I told the monk I would not be able to res because group needed mana.  I suggested he try at the zone and would have better luck.....He kept saying just to res the corpse, It was only mana....I got fed up then said it would be a 100pp in advance if I did.  He got all snippity and said he was a monk and couldn't carry that much.....I never did res and he finally got the hint and left after awhile.  <br />

Yeah I know its a druid due to the quad kiting statement and yes it could have been a wizard but they tend to have more class than this.<br />

My standard (hotkey #4) reply: I'm sorry I don't res anyone who's Anonymous. Have a nice day.  http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/smile.gif<br />

The different replies I get to this are fairly hilarious.<br />

On 3 to 4 occasions where people have been really rude to me I've made the effort to get to their body and then cast revive on them. Thanks please drive thru.  http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/smile.gif<br />

BTW, what ever happened to the good old days when the annoying twinks would never bother any high level people? In the last 6 months it seems like I get tells from every gimp who  is level 16+ asking for res's'.<br />

<br />
I have a level 30 cleric and am curious about why you guys check to see if someone is anon?  I have a 30 druid and usually go anon when I'm in town simply because of the magnitude of the sow me, port me, buff me, heal me, bind me, requests.  My druid is not a DrOOd.  I know they have a bad name so I strive to achieve a level of quality and maturity for mine.  I know what it's like to be both and I'm just wondering why annonymity is a consideration?<br />
<br />
Secondly, I do have a similiar rant.  I had just turned 29th level, waiting for a port to go buy my spells including revive.  I had been waiting 45 minutes to get a port out of Kunark (I have a high elf cleric who even when SoWd, runs very slowly and has little to no chance of outrunning the spiders).  After finally getting a port, I receive the following tell just seconds before LOADING, PLEASE WAIT...<br />
<br />
Whatshisname:  Can I get a rez plz<br />
Gabriarra:  I'm sorry I just got a port out and didn't see your /tell until immediately before zoning.<br />
Whatshisname:  I don't know why you play a cleric, you suck.<br />
Gahbriarra:  WTF?  I don't even have the spell yet I just hit 29!!  What is your problem?<br />
Whatshisname:  Whatever<br />
Gabriarra:  Well I never thought I'd say this but you're the first one on my NO RES list, have a nice day!<br />
/ignore whatshisname<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dahktur</div><div class="date">11-25-2001, 06:33 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Answered your own question, sort of Gabrianna  http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/smile.gif  The same people that do /w all cleric 50 60 to start the process of annoying clerics for rez requests, should have the courtesty to turn off anon so I can see their class/ level and even guild.<br />
<br />
It is ok to go anon, to avoid requests for services you can provide as druid, but a cleric not anon, shouldnt expect the same from a person requesting his services?  http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/smile.gif</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gabrianna</div><div class="date">11-26-2001, 03:17 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Oh I see what you mean.  I guess if I were going through the trouble to cast an exp res (regular revive is a mana guzzler so I know the next two must be bad) you want to know who you're giving it to.  Still, I would tell the person to please take anon off.  I wouldn't want to blow my mana on an exp res for someone under level 25 at least.  That just doesn't make sense.</div></div><hr />

<br />
As to checking anons, if I am in a higher level zone, I usually don't worry about it.  And if I am in a &quot;newbie&quot; zone, I usually go /roleplay myself, just to avoid the beggars..</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gryfalia</div><div class="date">11-26-2001, 09:43 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I think the point of not-rezzing anon players is this:<br />
<br />
I, the cleric in question, am risking being bugged by people (in this case you, the dead person) by not being anon, nor, indeed, even roleplay.  I am opening myself to the possibility that people may request aid from me.  I am doing this, KNOWING that I may get requests I cannot do and have to turn people down.  KNOWING that people are sometimes going to get angry that I cannot rez them.<br />
<br />
Yet you (the dead person) think that you should be above getting bothered.  You don't want to deal with people asking you for things, things which you might often give free of charge, but sometimes will have to say no and disappoint people.<br />
<br />
So, indeed, one reaps what one sows (or, in this case, SoWs…bwahahaha).<br />
<br />
Plus, of course, there are some guilds I won't help, period.  Unless I know the person directly, the guild has managed to acquire a black mark that I don't feel like giving them a second chance about.  Indeed, one was once THE uber guild on the server, and I wouldn't help anyone from that guild.  It broke up two times, the second fatally, and a random group of whoevers decided to reform a guild with the same name.  I won't even rez THEM because they think having the name of such a collection of social rejects is something to be desired.<br />
<br />
And that's all I have to say about that.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Velisaris</div><div class="date">11-26-2001, 06:15 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">About the anonymous thing...<br />
<br />
Unless it's someone I know, I will always ask the person to go un-anon before agreeing to help them.  Why?<br />
<br />
1) Yes, I do have a no-rez list, and this does include entire guilds.  My philosophy: The sins of the few are paid for by the many.  Invite too many goobers into your guild and eventually your guild gets a bad reputation.  I've had people who know I won't rez certain guilds go anon to try and hide it.<br />
<br />
2) I like to know what class I'm dealing with.  My rez fee is based on the following:<br />
Other clerics and pallys -- free rez, even if they want to pay.<br />
Druids -- 150pp flat out, more if I have to travel a bit.<br />
Everyone else -- Whatever they want to donate.  Unless the rez involves me traveling across the world, I never ask for money.  If I have to go from, say, OOT to somewhere in Velious I'll ask for some sort of compensation.  I leave it up to them to decide what it is.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Quotison</div><div class="date">11-27-2001, 09:13 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I don't think its fair to charge 150pp for druids (or any other class) when you charge other classes differently.<br />
<br />
As irritating as some druids are, there are lots of great druids out there. Four of the best friends I have made in game play druids.<br />
<br />
And I've met plenty of rude clerics and pallys (and lots of nice ones too)<br />
<br />
Anyways.. my worst request was from someone asking me for a revive while at the bank in Freeport. I'm just about ready to ask where the corpse is until I walk outside. There's the person that just asked me for a revive.<br />
<br />
So basically, he wants me to run out to Oasis and revive him, effectively doing his corpse run for him, even though we are both equal distance away from the corpse.<br />
<br />
He was quite persistant, even offering me an entire 5pp at once. I finally told him that I was an tired and he stopped bugging me as I camped  http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/smile.gif<br />

I don;t even remember if I was in crystal caverns to start with or not.  But anyways I ress this chump level 30ish war.  I buffed him a bit.  All fine and dandy, while there I decide to kill a few things.  About 5 minutes later he dies again.  So I ress and buff, slightly annoyed.  5 minutes later ANOTHER tell, he died again!!!! I ignored him and left the zone.  A real idiot or a kindergartener.  <br />
<br />
Most of my resses are free.  I do however accept money from druids and people i don;t like.  <br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Altheia</div><div class="date">12-06-2001, 11:08 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">My worst rez experience was in Crystal Caverns.  My party (myself and 2 SKs) were on our way down toward the dwarf town, fighting our way through the orc side, when I get a tell asking me if I could rez someone.  I tell them I'm busy, but they keep begging and insisting.  Finally I ask my friends if they mind, they say they don't, so I agree to meet them at the dwarf town.  On our way down I get tells from various people in the dead person's group telling me to hurry and they get quite indignant when I say I am in the middle of a fight, I'll get there when I can, as the orcs still aggroed my party every time we passed them.  Finally I get there and rez the person, and they ask how much.  I'm not really a greedy person, but since the person who asked and kept being insistent is many levels higher than myself and quite demanding I am kind of expecting something substantial. I told them &quot;whatever it is worth to you,&quot; which is what I tell everyone who asks, since I know usually my 50% rez is not in high demand.  I get handed 10pp, for all that aggravation. <br />
<br />
Still, since I didn't set a fee I don't really say much other than a polite thanks even though I am quite disappointed, and my group and I go on.<br />
<br />
Not more than 10 minutes later, that same group trains six spiders on my group, which is already struggling with 3.  My tanks ordered me to gate, as it was a lost cause, and they wound up feigning to survive.<br />
<br />
Then, that group has the absolute gall to send me a tell in Thurgadin begging for a rez!<br />
<br />
I tell him no, your group trained me and my group, forget it.  He starts crying it was the warrior's fault and he was innocent and he lost his level.  He NEEDS me to come to CC (with no help, mind you) and rez him.  I tell him no and to find another cleric.  He wound up spamming me so much I logged in aggravation (fortunately the rest of my group are close friends and didn't need me at that point anyhow).<br />
<br />
Apparently even after I logged, that jerk started harassing my friends demanding to know where I was hiding and how they had better tell him because I &quot;had&quot; to rez him.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Needry</div><div class="date">12-06-2001, 02:43 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I think the rez request that have galled me the most were ones in LGuk.  A couple or three friends and I one time were camping down at the AM/Hand/Lord camp, when this character comes in and starts informing the zone that he's all bad and stuff, and going to steal the ass/sup camp, and generally being ignorant.  This went on for about 10-15 minutes, while my group and I were rolling our eyes at each other.<br />
<br />
Anyway, you can probably guess what happened about an hour or so later.  Only it wasn't for him, it was for his guildmates that he had been PL'ing.  I turned that one down, told him I didn't rez while grouped (real reason- ignorant comments before).  &quot;Name your price.  What'll it be?  5k? 10k? 20k?&quot;  Yeah, right.  I told him it wasn't about the money, that I was in a group.  &quot;Wow, turning down 20k.&quot;  <br />
<br />
Number one, who has that kind of cash on them; number two, it was probably some item that I would have had to spend hours/days trying to sell; number three, you take your own risks PL'ing people in a dangerous place. <br />
<br />
Lesson to people- rude and ignorant comments to other people said in shout and ooc can be seen by other people in the zone... and remembered.  :P<br />
<br />
Other annoying rez requests in LGuk- bard and rogue twinks trying to get their Mask of Deception.  I get out of that one by insisting they bring me their corpse to the AM safe hall...  http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/smile.gif<br />
