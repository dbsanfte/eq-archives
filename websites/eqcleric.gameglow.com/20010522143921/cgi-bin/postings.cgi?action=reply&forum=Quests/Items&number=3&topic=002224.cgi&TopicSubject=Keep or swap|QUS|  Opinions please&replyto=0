<TEXTAREA NAME="ReplyMessage" ROWS=10 COLS=45 WRAP="VIRTUAL">[QUOTE]Originally posted by Ozymandia:
[B]I have a str of 86 and a wisdom in the 150 range, AC about 340.  Here's what I have that's valuable (all cleric quest armor is gold):

Head: Skull Shaped Barbute
Ear1: +3 wis earring
Ear2: +3 wis earring
Finger1: Jagged Band
Finger2: Jagged Band
Neck: Goblin Soul Caller
Face: Banded mask (heh, I know)
Arms: Cleric quest vambraces
Hands: Cleric quest gauntlets
Legs: Cleric quest legs
Chest: Cleric quest chestplate
Feet: Cleric quest boots
Back: Splinted bronze cloak
Weapon: Black Enamelled Mace
Secondary: Charred Guardian Shield

Don't remember offhand what's on shoulders and wrists.  My questions are: (1) Should I sell the Goblin Soul Caller and purchase something more AC/mana worthy?  Or keep it?  and (2) I have a Brigandine Tunic in the bank - should I wear that instead of the cleric chestplate, because even though it's 3 less AC, it's +7 to strength.

Any opinions would be appreciated,
Thanks much
~Ozy~

It's got +5 wis, nice AC and some bonus stats as well.<P>You need to make friends with a jeweler, btw.  <IMG SRC="http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/wink.gif"> Plat Ruby Veil for the face (str 7 wis 7), and the +6 wis rings for the hands. I'd say until you max out your wis you should pay a bit more attention to it, since 80% of our time is spent on our petards medding anyways. =)<P>Cheap back upgrade is a kunzar cloak for +2 wis and some fire resist, if you can't get a mammoth cloak. <P>Chest--either a tossup as to whether you want AC or if you want wis. If you want wis, get a bloodstained tunic. They're cheap, they're handy, and they give +4 wis. If you want AC, get an enamelled black breastplate (25 ac) or a Dusty bp (22 ac, but small races only).<BR></FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#dedfdf"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Ozymandia</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">OK, I'm kinda confused now  <IMG SRC="http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/smile.gif">  I had a lot of +wis gear on, brought my list to this message board, and was told toss most of it in favor of AC .. now I need to get rid of the AC and get +wis instead?

Given the equipment you already have listed, I'm going to assume that you either have some plat or have friends helping you get equipped.  What I'm listing won't be the best equipment, but it should be serviceable.<P>At level 18, you're probably past the point where you need to concentrate on AC.  Instead, you should be looking at picking up mana and Wisdom gear about now.<P>I can't give you specific advice about costs, as I'm not good at that sort of thing, but here's some general suggestions:<P>- Fingers: I'd switch to some wisdom rings... silver (+2) should be pretty cheap if you can't afford platinum (+6).  If you're really concerned about Strength, you could instead get electrum or gold ruby rings (electrum - +4 Str/+2 Wis, gold - +2 Str/+4 Wis).<P>- Face: see about getting a silver or platinum ruby veil. (silver - Str+4/Wis+4, platinum - Str+7/Gold+7)<P>- Hands: If you need the agility to stay at least 75, wear these.  If not, Split Paw gloves will give you +2 Wis. (even if you get Split Paw gloves, I'd keep these for when you need the extra AC)<P>- Wrists: You don't mention what you have here.  If you have the quest bracers, you're set.  If not, you may want to look into some Polished Bone Bracers (+3 Wis), Chipped Bone bracers (+5 Wis), or Gold Jade Bracelets (mana and hp 15, but you'll outgrow these quickly).<P>- Shoulders: If you don't have Adamantine Epolets, see about getting some.<P>- Back: Get rid of the bronze cloak.  Now.  See, didn't your encumbrance get a WHOLE lot better? <g>  If you can't get a Kunzar or Mammoth cloak (mentioned above), I'd still prefer even a leather or reinforced cloak (tailor-made) over bronze if I was worried about strength.<P>- Inventory: unless you need all the spaces in those sewing kits, I'd dump at least one and try to get some tailored large bags... only 6 slots instead of 10, but they weigh a lot less.  I think you can get rid of the Lightstone as well (not that it weighs much) - your shield is a light source.<P>Finally, the best suggestion I have about keeping your strength up... group with Shamans, Druids, or Enchanters.  (did I miss anyone with Strength buffs at that level?)</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#dedfdf"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Boanerges</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial"> <BLOCKQUOTE><font size="1" face="Verdana, Arial">quote:</font><HR>Originally posted by Ozymandia:<BR><B>OK, I'm kinda confused now   <IMG SRC="http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/smile.gif">  I had a lot of +wis gear on, brought my list to this message board, and was told toss most of it in favor of AC .. now I need to get rid of the AC and get +wis instead?

Being 18 makes a difference for sure.<P>This is a debate as old as the game. AC or wis? The answer is both, really. It used to be that you had to choose but given the explosion in +wis items that are high in AC, it's not uncommon for high end clerics to have 1000-1100AC and 200 wis.<P>Coming back down... balance is the key regardless of level. I wouldn't kill yourself for 200 wis at 18. 1 point of wis at your level is about 3 mana. I use the approximation method of (level * wis /5). As you go along, you'll have more and more +wis options available to you and trade them out as you can.<P>What I would do is keep your quest armor on. It's low in +wis but good AC. If you have a rich friend (and you aren't an Erudite or Gnome) you might consider some imbued armor. Then fill your other slots with +wis items. This is how I worked my way through to where I am now. Even better, you have options I never did. Platinum Jasper rings were almost unheard of back then and I sure as heck didn't have the money.
