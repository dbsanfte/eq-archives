Once he gets to the zone, zone out and have you groupmates "Hail" him or spam "What plasmatic priest" until you return. Zone in, hand in the statue and proceed to mop the floor with him. <BR>Is this a viable tatic, or should I attempt it some other way.

I went with a lvl 60 monk and the two of us killed him where he stood in the upstairs room.  We didn't have any aggro from any other mobs there, although if you were to use any kind of AoE you would get the others mad at you.

The enchanter runed me and I went up to the plasmatic priest. Once I was sure I had agro, I gated to the zone in. This brought the priest with no adds and we killed him quite easily. Just make sure you announce to the zone that you are doing this; we didn't and the priest stopped to kill someone else along the way to the zone. oops.</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#f7f7f7"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Nazrin</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">The Preist is actually very easy to do I did it with 4 players and he didn't last long.<P>The way I found to do it was to actually have a monk (level 60) tag him and pull him to zone then I rooted him, then cast atone on him while rooted.<P>I then gave him the statue and it took all of about 3 minutes if that.  The other players I had was a level 60 Ranger (snare) and a level 53 bard for resist song just handy.

I'd say here are the main options, listed in order of safe to more potentially 'dangerous' (imo).<P>1. Have an FD-capable player tag the priest, baby him to the zone and then let puller FD. Hail the priest, make sure he's lost aggro and FD worked (or have puller zone), hand-in, and kill.<P>2. Have any kind of player pull him to zone, then depending on what class they are, memblur, zone, or whatever it takes to clear the priests' aggro. Hail him, check to make sure he's lost aggro, hand in, kill.<P>3. Go up to his room, hail him, hand in, kill. The only pesky bit here is *if* he AoEs. I've done this where he didn't AoE at all. He is stunnable (if you have levels, tash, etc) so you can stop him casting that way.<P>Personally, when I did this fight he was pulled to the zone (first time the myself and the group of folks helping me had done it) - you never know if he might just get off that one AoE at a critical moment and you might lose the kill to a temple resident.<P>One thing to note is that if your team is lower in level, or perhaps relatively low damage output, he *will* cast a lot more during the fight (obviously). The times where I've not seen him *not* cast his AoE is when a group of 55+, mostly 60s killed him, so he was trying to heal himself rather than damage us.<P>Good luck!<P>Caelym<BR>High Priest of Tunare<BR>Zhaaz<BR>Disciple of Cazic Thule</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#f7f7f7"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Mordesca V</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">How I did my plasmatic priest...<P>only had 1 group:<P>Enchanter, Necro, Paladin, Warrior, cleric (me) and the monk...<P>we waited at zone while paladin pulled the "seeker" and it was beating the crap out of him .. so he LOH'd in time and zoned to lose aggro .. enc charmed seeker, so handed in my item, he turned into the plasmatic priest then the rest of us got on the priest and killed him ..

Handing in the statue and waiting a second is more than enough to agro him. Run the route from his room to zone a couple times-note that you can jump off the bridge near the big open room, but he won't. Gives you a few extra moments to get ready for him at the entrance. Also, have someone keep that first big door open for you-its a pain to open and you don't want to be fumbling for the door with plassy smacking ya in the back.<P>------------------<BR>Higar Mettlebender<BR>Vicar of the 53rd Prayer and Luclin Loot Ho<BR>Weilder of the Water Sprinkler of Nem`Ankh<BR>Guardians of the Keep<BR><A HREF="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=20669" TARGET=_blank>Higar's Profile</A><BR>Master Drinker (200) <BR>Master Jeweler (188)Master Fletcher (185)Master Brewer (175) Master Smith (175) Master Potter (168) Master Baker (162) (Anyone got any dragon meat lying around??)
