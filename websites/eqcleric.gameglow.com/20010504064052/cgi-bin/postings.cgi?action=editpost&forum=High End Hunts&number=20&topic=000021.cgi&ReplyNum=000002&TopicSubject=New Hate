<TEXTAREA NAME="EditedMessage" ROWS=10 COLS=45 WRAP="VIRTUAL">
    Spent yesterday in Hate as well, and figured I'd add some things here.  First thing to mention is that being high on the walls is no longer "safe".  You'll get HT'd, attacked and everything else.  Run down to the floor and camp out and you'll be fine.

    We were headed to pull Maestro and see if he had any new drops or anything.  Well, we started out the way I've always seen it done before:  Clear mobs back to SWC, move everyone to the throne room, clear Maestro's area, pull Maestro.  Well, we got to throne room, got everything cleared and started buffing for Mae, when all the sudden Maestro shows up with a couple of Spites.  Whole raid wiped out.  We figured someone must have wandered and didn't notice and that we'd pay closer attention next time.
    
    One of our clerics camped out, I got rezzed back in and started right clicking.  Just as the last person was popping back in from Rez, Maestro showed up _AGAIN_ and started ripping us into ribbons.  A cleric managed to run back to SWC and camp out.  Our monk pulled all the bodies back there and I started rezzing folks back in.  Again, after about half the folks were rezzed Maestro shows up in SWC and proceeds to kill everyone.

    We never did figure out what was happening, but we've got some theories.  After the first time, we kept an eye on folks and there wasn't anyone roaming.  No one was climbing the walls or anything of the sort.  There was a bard playing a song the first two times, but not the third time over at SWC.  In all three cases it was a cleric to die first (ie first aggro).

    There was another raid fighting upstairs at the same time, so my thoughts is that perhaps some of the mobs were chainging aggro down to Mae and then the rest was just bad pathing for Mae into our raid group.  Perhaps aggro is linked now on the beginning mobs upstairs to make you "do things in order"?  Anyway, there were also 2 GM's in the zone, so we did consider the idea that they were doing it "on purpose" just to make things difficult, but we all were very much hoping that was not the case.   :)

    Anyone else see anything along these lines?

    Oh, btw, we did finally manage to drop Maestro and he had standard loot, the hand that spawned after was green as mentioned above but he had a LOT of hit points.  Being green he ran at half health--and apparently 5 rangers, 3 druids, 2 SK's and a Necro weren't enough folks for someone to snare before he ran.  *sigh*   :)
