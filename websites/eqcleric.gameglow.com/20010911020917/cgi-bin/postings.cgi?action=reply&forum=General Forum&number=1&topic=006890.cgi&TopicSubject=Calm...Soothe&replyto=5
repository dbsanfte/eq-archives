<TEXTAREA NAME="ReplyMessage" ROWS=10 COLS=45 WRAP="VIRTUAL">[QUOTE]Originally posted by kelson13:
[B]Actually, this spell reminds me a LOT of a low level Bard song.  There's a song where you target a mob and sing at it, then quickly target another mob and sing at it, etc.  You can only do it 2 or 3 times before the first song's duration runs out, so I wouldn't sing at more than 2 or 3 mobs before I pulled the remaining mob(s).

This spell seems to work the same way, but here's the kicker....if it's like the song, it's CHA based, and many Clerics simply don't have the CHA Bards and Enchanters do (My Bard used this song very well with 160 CHA).

So all you Dwarves who thought there wasn't really a downside to your race, this is it.  ;)  Nothing to lose sleep over, though.  I don't see why a Cleric would be the best puller your group can find anyway.  :P

It's a nifty spell, but if you don't have the CHA, it's useless.  My Cleric is Human and his CHA is 85.  Not that great, but I'd be willing to bet my success would be more than a Dwarven Cleric with this spell.

Are they comparible to druid Harmony spells?<P>I tried to use these to pull singles from camps.   After getting everthing Soothed, sometimes 2, 3 or even the whole camp would come anyway.<P>Any advice on these spells any are willing to bestow here?   (Where and when can you use it, how effective, etc.)<P>ALl I know now is that it is SUPPOSED to reduce aggro range, and you should hit up all the lower /connning type critters first in order to avoid a fail and possible train.<P>Oh, and finally, I have noticed that a failure of this spell does not always pull the mobs...this seems like a 50-50 chance on failure you will aggro the mob, is this correct?<P>Thanks!<P>-- Font</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#f7f7f7"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Dalur - Veeshan</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Check out this thread - it was previously discussed a bit.<BR> <A HREF="http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/Forum1/HTML/006750.html" TARGET=_blank>http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/Forum1/HTML/006750.html</A> <P>------------------<BR>Dalur Stouthealer<BR>60th Dwarven High Priest<BR>Veeshan Server</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#dedfdf"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Burrwin</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">That other thread covers it pretty well, and my personal experience (admittedly levels < 15) has been good results.  I was splitting the skeletons at the dragon skeleton in Steamfont regularily with it (blue and white cons), and a bit earlier was splitting goblins at the camps in Butcherblock.<P>I did find that you needed to be reasonably close to see the success message ("so and so looks less agressive"), and the short duration means you gotta work quickly.<P>Just a repeat of the warning: have an out to the situation if you get a failure, or you're dead (or DA'd and running like a bastard).  If you're pulling something that continually needs to be split (not just needing to be split perhaps a few times to get the spawn staggered), you should probably team up with a chanter or a monk.  <IMG SRC="http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/smile.gif"></FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#f7f7f7"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Eachann</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Put the spell in teh back of your spellbook and forget you have it.  It's useless.<P>It can SOMETIMES work if you only have 2 or 3 to split.. but if you have 3 mobs to split your are almost always going to get at least 2 of them using lull, and there is a pretty good chance you'll get all 3.   You have to cast it on each mob that needs it (it's not AE) and on each cast it can work or be resisted... if it is resisted there is a chance of it causing aggro and if it does that, usually the whole camp will come even if it's not the first one you've lulled.<P><P>------------------<BR>Eachann Bronzeleaf<BR>Templar of Tunare, <BR>Tarew Marr</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#dedfdf"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Font</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Thanks Dalur.<P>That was a semi-dissappointing thread.  Still, I suppose these spells are better then nothing to help break a camp, especially low to mid levels.<P>You would think a Cleric of Quellious should have a big bonus using these Lull type spells (RP sense).<P>/em shrug<P>I have used it, but it only sometimes seems to work, as said in the thread.   Perhaps it will be better used in low blue type camps.<P>I guess the upgrades give cause the aggro range and the duration to be both smaller and longer, respectively?<P>I'd still like to hear from some one that is an expert user of these spells.  I think they could be very useful in the small groups I always seem to be in small 2 or 3 person groups...me, a monk, and a Paladin for example.   I have to do crowd control as well as healing and buffing, and occasional nukes!
