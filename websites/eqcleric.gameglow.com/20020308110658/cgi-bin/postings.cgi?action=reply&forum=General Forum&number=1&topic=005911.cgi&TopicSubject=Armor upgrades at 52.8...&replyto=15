Clerics *miss* so much, that I think a much higher proc, is better than a better dmg/dly and minor proc in this case.

The fact that Dark Ember has useful stat bonuses... that's to be debatted depending on what your stats currently are... if you have high stats... you may want to shout YKESHA!

Like I said in another post you can get Jarsanth Legs AC15 wis5 and something else, it only weighs 0.8 and often it rots cause it drops in Karnors and "most" people that hunt there will have better stuff anyway. It's NoDrop so you can get it for free more than likely. If your feeling really frisky you can try for some Sebilite Scale leggings to match your BP <IMG SRC="http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/smile.gif"> AC16 wis/str/cha 4 and some saves.<P>For you ears try for an Ivandyr's Hoop, AC6 wis6 and some other stuff<P>In your neck slot the most coveted of clerical items, the Abalone Gorget drops in Kedge Keep AC8 wis9 <P>I'd keep the boots. Being able to nuke for free plus amasing AC is worth far more than anyone can offer. You always hear people telling you not to nuke and save your mana for heals which is very true,  well those puppies are gonna let you have some fun too <IMG SRC="http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/smile.gif"><P>If you're gonna do the above suggestion with your shield I would say to try for a sarnak shield if you can but the clay guardian shield is very good as well. but keep the charred shield in a bag just in case you dont have that enchanter with you.</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#dedfdf"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Boanerges</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Actually, try for a Walrusbone Shield. Drops in the upper part of the maze in Skyshrine.<P>+5 wis, str, sv magic and only weighs 3.0 for a net gain of 9 carrying capacity.<P>Why ditch wis for str? Simple...<P>Velious armor is HEAVY. EM has +14 str. Stability only has +4. And Stability weighs 1-2 more per piece. Donal's is non-stat too.<P>If you can, ditch the EM bracer for Donal's. Not easy to find, tho. Drops in Disco2 camp of Sebilis.<P>As to the boots... tough call there. Donal's boots are RARE as heck but if Verant ever listens to us and ups the drop rate the price will fall. IMO, Donal's are not the best thing for clerics anymore, especially given Stability and Thurgadin quest stuff being easier to get for the stats.<P>What you really need to do is get in on a PoG raid (admit it, you never liked Tunare anyways  <IMG SRC="http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/tongue.gif">). It's a new standard in armor and you can pick up some major +wis and AC and even +mana.<P>Some other things...<P>Neck: go for a Goblin Soul Caller (+5 wis +10 MR) easy to get. Abalone Gorget is nice but good luck finding someone selling one. Saw one being auctioned off in trade for a VS stone the other day.<P>Face: Sebilite Scale Mask is good AC but you'll lose +str and some wis. Polished Mithril Mask is good AC and wis but no +str.<P>Melee: Obviously work on your epic but don't hold out much hope on finishing unless they change the quest.

Luckily, the cone drops at the same camp as the cloak, so if you put in some time in sebilis crypt, you could probably pick up both.<P>I don't know if Dorfs can use them, but sebilite scale leggings are the best non-Velious, non-Donal's legs a cleric can get. They sell fairly cheap on my server.<P>The sebilite scale mask and neckguard are both upgrades to what you've got now, both drop in disco where, coincidentally, Donal's Bracer, Helm and Arms drop. The helm is terrible, but the bracer is nice, and you'll almost certainly get the mask and neckguard if you spend a bit of time in disco.<P>You'll want a sarnak shield eventually, but they're increasingly rare and the charred guardian shield is good enough until you can get one.<P>Aiien.</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#dedfdf"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Bamedil</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">my suggestions:<BR>get a paw for weapon and carry weapon if you want to melee, which for me is not often<BR>shield - clay or sarnak battle I use dreadforged shield (human/erudite)<BR>I keep chrysoberyl talisman over the goblin soul caller no ac on the goblin soul caller.
