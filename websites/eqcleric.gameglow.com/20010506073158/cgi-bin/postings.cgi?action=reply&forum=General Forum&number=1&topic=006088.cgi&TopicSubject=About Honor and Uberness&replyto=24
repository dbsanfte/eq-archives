<TEXTAREA NAME="ReplyMessage" ROWS=10 COLS=45 WRAP="VIRTUAL">[QUOTE]Originally posted by Nuelaan doAevum:
[B]I think the real 'problem', for lack of a better term, with EQ lately (aside from development and game balance issues which are in VI's hands only) is that a lot of the hardcore casual players have clocked enough hours xping to finally start showing up in the 50+ and 55+ range in large large numbers.  Now it's a culture clash; all the hardcore uber players are now surrounded by equally leveled hardcore casual players.

Not surprisingly, both groups find very little in common with one another.  Casual players seem to stake a huge amount of pride in their ability to "not care; it's just a game" method of calmly and meanderingly strolling through Everquest.  These casual players, as many of them now have characters in the cutthroat 50+ range, are finding that the way a lot of people who've been in that 50+ range longer do things differently.

Who do I think is 'better' or 'right'?  Not really a 'right' answer, but I identify far more with the hardcore ubers than I do with the hardcore casuals.  To me, the fun of EQ is seeing what one can get away with.  Not "get away with" in the criminal or mean sense, but in the sense of "can we do that?"

Example?  How many people do we need to kill someone?  My guild on TZ has been killing Phinny for someone's epic (Necro and Wiz I think) lately, we're having a blast with it, treating it like a challenge.  Our current 'record' is ten people less than ninety minutes from the first "/gu hey time to kill Phinny again, everyone who's going chime in".  We're convinced we can clear to and kill Phinny with a single group, but it'll have to be the right group with the right people.

That's fun.  A casual player might look at the above and go "gaaah" with a lip curled in disgust, but I'm a hardcore gamer.  I play games for the thrill of victory, the agony of defeat (as the old ABC sports guy used to say).

Without the challenge, without what I view as the *game*, EQ is just a fancy chat program with some rather interesting animated emotes.  That's all.

I don't chat, even with ICQ or whatever.  I log in to play, I come home ready to log in hoping to dive into an interesting problem to be solved.  Can we break Fear and clear it?  Can we kill Reavers in COM all night without any deaths?  Can we break through to the Royals in Chardok and clear them for some epic drops?

Finding out the answers to those kinds of questions is loads of fun, even when it doesn't work.  Sure it's way irritating when it *doesn't work* and it's for a stupid reason (like someone wasn't paying attention to instructions, or didn't understand the instructions and didn't ask for more help, or someone was afk without warning, or three key people went LD right as the fight started, etc...); but the feeling when you make something work, *especially* if 'they' said it was hard/impossible ... man.  Hard to describe, but anyone who's ever hit a home run or scored a touchdown or won a skill contest knows the feeling I'm talking about.

Nothing's wrong with 'just being a casual player'.  If your idea of fun in EQ is to log in and chat with your buds while selling stuff in the ECTunnel or in GFay for a few hours .. hey man, that rocks.  But not everyone will want to do just that.

So, where am I going with this?  Basically, I don't "get" why casual players have to look down on ubers for the ubers' desire to 'go further faster'.  I don't "get" why ubers have to look down on casuals because the casuals 'never do anything'.  It's unfortunate there are only a finite number of mobs and encounters in the world, but that's also a good thing.

I haven't played AC, but the 'dynamic content' thing doesn't sound very interesting to me.  When I log into TZ and hear "guild_001 just dropped Woushi", that means something to me that hearing "guild_001 dropped a dragon in their dynamicly generated sub-dungeon" doesn't.  Knowing all the mobs and their interrelations makes it fun.  Knowing the world is finite and thus limited because of it makes everything more real.  If there was an infinite supply of game encounters ... that's like Quake or Counterstrike.  I play CS, but to satisfy a different type of gaming urge than I'm trying to sate when I play EQ.

That also means there will, not too infrequently either, be situations where two or more groups are gunning for the same encounter/mob(s) a the same time.  This means there will have to be some way to sort out who does it now and who does something else.

Which goes to the blue vs red thing some of you are moving the thread into.  Blue vs red is a really stupid thing to debate, imo, because the typical blue player isn't interested in any arguments a red player might make for the red way.  Likewise, the typical red player isn't much interested by any position a blue player might offer for the blue method.

Pointing out there are more blue vs red doesn't really prove anything.  To illustrate what I mean by that, the difference between the two basically goes to how 'who gets what mob' arguments are settled.  On a blue server, you yell and scream at the person/people in question, you tell your guild and friends they're mean bastards who should be shunned, and you petition guides and gms seeking their arbitration.  On a red server, two sides disagree, they fight, one walks away, one stays.  And *then* they yell and scream, tell their guild and friends the guy's a mean bastard who should be shunned, and even occasionally petition guides and gms to eventually come around to look at something.
 :)

Is one way 'better' than the other?  Well, we all know there's no way everyone will agree on the 'right' way to settle these kinds of issues.  So you chose the one you like.

So when you smugly point out there are more blue servers than red, all that says to me is more EQ players prefer to petition to have problems settled than to settle them on their own.  Since I don't like to have others settle those kinds of things if I can help it (mostly because I'm usually impatient to be getting on with whatever it is we having going that night), I vastly prefer the red method to the blue.

Red means I don't always win, but that's ok.  Not winning makes winning more fun when it happens; of course, always not winning pretty much just blows.  So hopefully you only sometimes not win, and win the rest of the time.

That way you have just enough whine to appreciate your cheese all the more.  ;)[/B][/QUOTE]
