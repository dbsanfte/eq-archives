What a pleasant experience it is to see what is happening instead of just reading about it.  I feel like I just went from Radio to TV...it seems that this level may just be the point where things really change for me as a "Drunken Dwarven Battlecleric".  I see that my spells are getting stronger, but so are my foes.<P>What are your thoughts regarding the path to level 39?  Right now, I'm raiding 1-2 times per week, grouping in guild another 1-2 times, and hunting solo or pickups another 1-2 nights per week.  I have done this to get the experience of all the different styles of play, both outdoors and underground.<P>Now for the rant, how many of you brother Clerics get upset by Warriors telling you not to meele, even though you are at FM?  I hate this, as I have an offensive skill at 173, defensive skill at 152 and dodge at 169, along with 1HB maxed out for level already (175).  Heck, I even have my swimming over 160!<P>I have spent a lot of effort maintaining my meele skills, I am after all, a Battlecleric.  What's the point of Plate Mail if you sit in the dew-covered grass, letting it gather rust?  I have had to explain to the tanks many times that it does our group no good if I sit there at full mana, waiting to heal them, but not doing anything else.  I can do 25-33 damage with my Dark Ember (even though it doesn't proc for me yet), or 18-22 with the smoldering brand (which does proc Burn for 14dd about every 8-10 swings).  I switch back and forth, using the SB when I want to do many blows (i.e. following a runner) and + strength, or the DE for + stats and a steady-heavy damage without building too much aggro.  These guys (MT/MA) also seem to forget that I can self buff to 1,250+ hp, so I can take alot of meele damage (for this level of MOB).  <P>I know, we are healers, but why must we be forced into becoming a bunch of one-trick ponies when we really are a pretty well rounded class.<P>Piikaa Fishweed<BR>35th Drunken Dwarven Battlecleric of Brell<BR>Bertoxxulous Server<BR>Proud member of Twilight Order<p>[This message has been edited by piikaa (edited 02-05-2002).]</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#f7f7f7"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Feias</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">In the slim chance that it isn't a typo but a lack of knowledge on my part I have to ask for clarification.<P>Doesn't Dodge cap out at 75?<P>Also can you actually self buff to 1250+ at 35?

At least while you can, and let the people you group with know this.  You may want to team up with some other clerics and take on undead - that would be great!  And I suppose as long as people stay buffed/healed, who cares?<P>At some point, though, you will become useless in melee and will find yourself doing the heal/buff/crowd control duties.  I'm, not much of a tank, but once in a while I like to mix it up.  My skills aren't bad, and I wield a Dark Ember (decent enough 1HB), but for the last couple levels I barely dent a mob (You hit for 1!).<P>So, enjoy it while you can....<P>Durok<BR>52nd Cleric</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#f7f7f7"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Javara</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">I like to get up and swing a weapon once in a while also, however as I have seen it pointed out various times in other threads it is probably more efficient to throw a nuke or to stun the mob and then med that mana back than it is to melee for the same amount of time. Many times when you join pick up groups people are there for the exp as quick and efficiently as they can get it, so in those instances I try and be as efficient myself.<P>However when grouped with friends and guildies they know I am a "good" cleric and don't mind if I use my pathetic meelee skill some, given it isnt endangering the goup of course, as we are there to have fun mostly and get loot/exp second.

Do I tell you when to taunt?  No, you do your job well, and I respect that.  I do my job well too, can't you respect me?"<P>The only exceptions to this would be if you were gaining aggro, and not able to cast a heal spell when needed.<P>My general response to meat shields that offer advice is: "Thank you."<P>I then think about it, and if I think their idea has a chance to speed the flow of exp or loot, then I try it a couple times.<P>I can say this.  You are approaching the point where the amount of melee damage you can do is being outweighted by the amount of spell damage you can do.

Even keeping everyone fully buffed (though I let symbol lapse on all but Scrapy and Daphyne) I was sitting at full mana often enough that I started dotting the current mob and bopping them with my mace, and the enchanter started nuking for the kill too.  <P>Just about the point I decided to keep the warrior at 2 bubbles whenever possible (cause everything was blue & he likes being beserk) he brought back a crowd.  Scrapy lived and so did everyone else, but we were rather low mana at the end of the fight.

Other bards play a wide variety of songs.<BR>Sometimes people don't do things... I've had druids not snare... tanks who I think don't taunt... enchanters who don't stun casters.

When they join your group as say "do you want my songs or my sword?" tell them "Honestly-it's totally up to you. You know your class better than I ever could-do what you need to do. If I need mana or something desperately, I'll mention it."<P>I have a couple bards who still throw a tell just to say "hi" every so often that I said that to. This really applies in the 20s and 30s more than anything-by the mid-40s+, most people understand its best to stand back and let the bard do their thing, and only ask for specifics if you need something right away. Of course, if you get in a group that doesn't, feel free to jump in on the bard's behalf. Bard telling someone to back off doesn't carry near the weight of the bard + the cleric.  <IMG SRC="http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/wink.gif"><P>------------------<BR>Higar Mettlebender<BR>Vicar of the 53rd Prayer and Luclin Loot Ho<BR>Weilder of the Water Sprinkler of Nem`Ankh<BR>Guardians of the Keep<BR><A HREF="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=20669" TARGET=_blank>Higar's Profile</A><BR>Master Drinker (200) <BR>Master Jeweler (188)Master Fletcher (185)Master Brewer (175) Master Smith (175) Master Potter (168) Master Baker (162) (Anyone got any dragon meat lying around??)
