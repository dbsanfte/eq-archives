Aradune said,

"In a nutshell, our vision and hope is that they would all be relatively balanced. And when I say balanced, I mean useful in the game, such that a player chooses which class he wants to play from a subjective standpoint (i.e. Paladins are cool!), rather than feeling compelled to choose a particular class because that class is measurably more powerful in most in-game situations.
The vision also includes a desire for interdependence and situational aptitudes. In other words, in most cases, classes should need other classes (and, therefore, other people) to be successful in the game. Also, some classes should be more successful in some situations and less so in others.

Now, this is the 'vision' -- our idealistic desire. We've fallen short, of course, but we continue to strive to do better. But, all in all, given our personal experiences, the feedback we receive, and looking at the data (how many people play which classes, etc.), I think we've done a pretty good job.

Aradune said,

"To answer your question, the 'vision' is that in most high level situations a tank, a caster, and a healer should be present. In other words, core class functionality. So, ideally, just about any tank, or caster, or healer should be useful. Beyond that, depending on the more specific situation, some classes might be better than others at this core functionality. 

Again, that's the ideal. And some of the changes -- 'nerfs' and enhancements -- as of late are an attempt to get us closer to that ideal.

-Brad"

We already know that experience loss has been established as the penalty for too much risk.

How is giving a single class almost complete control over risk vs. reward (EXP Res's) balanced?

How does giving a class the ability to radically bend the rules of Risk vs. Reward fit into the 'vision' of making no one class always more desirable than another?

Let's see... risk is balanced with reward... and risk is measured in experience loss. That's it, right? I mean, except for tricky corpse recoveries...
A 96% rez means that you take 4% of the experience penalty that you would have otherwise. That's 1/25 as much experience loss. In other words, any encounter is 25 times more risky if you don't have a chance to get a rez, and you get 25 times more reward for the same risk if you have a cleric around.

If all the clerics went on strike and refused to provide their services, EQ would become 25 times as risky. I don't think any single other class has that kind of power.

You are, of course, 100% correct. Rez TOTALLY messes up the high level game. It places HUGE power in the hands of one class (two if you count paladins, but there are much fewer paladins, and they only get the power at high mucher level). 
In fact, one need only go to the cleric message board: 
 [URL=http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/cgi-bin/forumdisplay.cgi?action=topics&forum=General+Forum&number=1&DaysPrune=10&LastLogin=]http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/cgi-bin/forumdisplay.cgi?action=topics&forum=General+Forum&number=1&DaysPrune=10&LastLogin=[/URL] 

Simply listen to when a nerf is proposed, what do they do (almost to a man)? Say that they will boycott REZ, and then ask the other players: "how do you like that?"

Clerics are, IMO, the bane of EQ. They were given two spells that were CLEARLY out of WACK: Complete Heal, and the REZ line. If these two spells were removed from the game (other than the 29 rez, that one makes sense) EQ would be a much better place. 

Also the Heal Over Time spells are out of wack. But that is something that should be addressed in another post.

The power of the two spells mentioned above made clerics almost 100% required in any group past 45. After 50+ they become even more important. I know that Verant can't do much about this within EQ, as those whiny people who play clerics will have a hissy fit. However, you can be assured that within EQ2 there will be NO XP rez, and there will be NO CH.

Bank on it.

PS - Road_Kill you are foolish, if you think your changes will make EQ a better place. Talk about cutting off your nose to spite your face.
Let's take away exp resses, but leave the 29 res. Guess what that means? Necros and paladins won't get it, so that means only clerics have the ability to res someone back to their corpse, a must in some of the high lvl raids. That means you are actually strengthening this 'monopoly,' however making it worse on OTHERS by removing the exp given back.

Really stupid suggestion. As we've said many times, resses aren't for clerics. I've ressed myself maybe 5 times ever. They are for OTHERS. If you want to hurt yourself and others by taking out the exp returned, so be it. No problem by me, it just solidifies our spot in high lvl groups. Only thing it does it makes the EQ community as a whole much more disgruntled when they realize there is no way to get lost exp back.

Good job genius.

Post level 50, most marginally social people know someone(s) who will give them a razz. That may not be a rez right at that moment, maybe not even in the 3-hour limit, but they know someone(s) who will help them out when they can. The rez power of the cleric is awesome but is minimally balanced by them not being required in the group. Only required when things go wrong. If you are not able to get a rez within the 3-hour limit, you can always log off for an hour or two or however long it would be before one could be obtained. This is very roughly similar to the Necro summon corpse ability. Necros dont feel that they are needed on raids even though this ability is sometimes absolutely necessary when things get ugly. They are often called in afterwards to clean up instead of being there for the actual big event.
While I agree this is an awesome power, I dont think it should be spread around. It is the hallmark of the cleric and, as I said, does not necessarily make them required for groups as long as you are friendly with one who will help you if things go wrong.

Jaxxson,
Please read my post again, whiny little child:

EQ will not be fixed, wrt. XP Rezes. Whinny little children like yourself will insure that the status quoue will remain the same. 

Rez totally mucks up the risk vs. reward at higher levels. The 49 Rez was a mistake (90 percent XP), and it backed verant into a corner wrt. higher levels. Due to the existance of 90+% XP rezes, verant HAD to inflate the death penalty. 

Don't worry little boy, your cleric will still be uber. People will still govel in front of you for XP rezes. You little ego will remain intact. 

However, in EQ2 it is unlikely that XP rezes will exist. Also there will be no CH (which is the other reason why people want you in groups so badly). 

Enjoy EQ. Milk it for all it is worth little boy.

No little child. They are for you, in that YOU have the power to decide who you wish to give them to and who you do not wish to give them to. 

It's all about you lording over other, which helps stimulate your little ego.

Exp res is an important part of the game. I can't even imagine having it removed, or put into the hands of a greater number of classes. I also am somewhat taken back by the tone of some of the replys to this simple question. EvilChu was just making a simple point. He considers the only risk Exp loss, and sees that Clerics are the only way to lessen this risk. 
He has forgotten that equipment loss is a MUCH greater threat, and that there are the exact same number of classes who can summon corpses as Res. Indeed this risk is fairly well balanced, considering.

The intent of the game is to make it such that each player MUST depend on another to excell. It is possible to solo, but to truly conquer the greater challenges of the game you MUST work with others. No one class, and certainly no single player can do what a well rounded group or series of groups can do.

I see this post as a poorly hidden class envy post. Someone out there has whined and gotten superior heal, they have whined more and gotten complete heal made much less important; now if they can get it so that res. will be nerfed they have succeeded in what ever agenda that they have. It will not make for a better game, it will only make one person happy at the expense of many others.

I love these kind of statements. What are you going to give me if you are wrong? Why do you have and credibility to make this statement?

"There are more classes that can res that classes that can group port. Nerf dr00ds thx, so monopoly~"

Rezers: Cleric, Paladin
Porters: Druid, Wizard
Other: Necro
I don't think you can lump the Necro rez with the others. Someone HAS to loose the EXP for them to be able to use their rez. This quality is not shared in any fashion with the Cleric/Paladin rez.

OMG,
Shut your mouths, anyone who says tha EQ would be better off w/o Rezz or CH, is obviously under 50th level.

Remove Rezz & Complete Heal, guess what? There will be NO EQ for people 50+ ... you may as well eliminate Kunark & SoV off your computer because people would become SO frustrated with trying to accomplish ANYTHING in the new expansions that they would quit the game. The game would turn into 90% CR/Downtime, 10% playtime. Then the only thing that people could complain about is ports! 

Rezz & CH is the only thing a cleric has that keeps them from being able to walk away from the monitor altogether in boredom. Even with them, try playing a Cleric to 57th level.

Take away those two things from a cleric and you will have a Paladin that can't melee or LoH.

Then you say, "NO CLASS should have that much influence in the game" WAAAAAA!!!!! sniff sniff WAAAAAA!!! DEAL WITH IT! remove Rezz & CH, EQ turns into a glorified game of Might & Magic

Wrong again Road_Kill. The only person who is whining, making up ridiculous suggestions is yourself. Outside of just associating myself with a cleric (my first char ever), if a change was made it really wouldn't affect me much. Know why? Because as much as others like yourself would like everyone to believe, clerics aren't as great as they are cracked up to be. I rarely play my cleric now for many reasons. I'm not going to go into all of them here, but the main is that being accepted into groups, even going as far as being 'needed' in groups don't mean a damn thing unless you are having fun.
If exp loss remains as terrible as it is in EQ2, it too will have ways to return exp (read=res). I wouldn't be surprised if it didn't have CHeal, but I don't think that's a bad thing. I've said many times CHeal can actually be a hinderance to a cleric. Whenever a cleric asks for something, people (including Verant) bring up CHeal. I actually would prefer to be more diversified and receive a greater set heals rather than CHeal. As it stands everything, including a cleric's spell line (meaning other heals) is based around that spell. That's one of the main reasons HoT spells had to be given to clerics, because there weren't many more set heal spells you can squeeze in between Divine Light and CHeal.

As for resses, I could care less about stimulating my ego. This is a game. I didn't play a cleric for power, when I first started I thought lvl 9 was an accomplishment in itself. Don't lump me with people like yourself who try to purposely ruin the GAME. I don't play a character for power, I play them for fun. I would never start a character just because they were 'needed.'

This isn't a job, I don't get paid, I play to have fun. You should try to do the same, you're obviously getting worked up over a GAME.

Clerics are the only class that can do anything to remedy the damage done by linkdeaths. If you're kiting at 51 and go linkdead and die, you don't need a corpse summoned. You need your bloody experience back. 
Why is rezzing better than corpse summoning? Because you always lose your experience when you die. You usually don't have an unrecoverable corpse.

In a game that bases risk on experience loss, it's a mistake to give the power to avoid 96% of that risk to one class. The game is balanced to assume that people are getting exp rezzes. The entire risk and reward of the game is balanced based on an ability of one class that takes no skill to use.

It's not like EQ would be impossible without experience rezzes. They would just have to reduce the death penalty a lot to compensate. (Like 1/10 of previous experience lost at death)

Many classes can help with CR's through the use of invisibility, sneak, faction boosting spells, temporary invulnerability, and increasing their movement rate...to name a few. Aside from this two classes are eventually equally able to summon a corpse, albeit SK's at a higher component cost.

But that's not the issue. The issue is experience loss, which has long been established as the penalty for too much risk.

"WAAAAAA!!!!! sniff sniff WAAAAAA!!!"
Oops, darn, someone invoked the perfect argument on this thread. I guess all posting is pointless now.

Let's draw a parallel to keep you people on your toes.

--------------------------------------------------

One upon a time, enchanters had a buff that let people hit 25 times faster. Some other classes had haste spells, and one even let you hit 50% faster. But the epic encounters were tuned to be the appropriate level of risk for people with the 25x haste on them.

2 years into the game, verant suddenly realized that this put too much power in the hands of enchanters. "Hey, maybe it's a bad idea to balance the entire game based on the abilities of one class", they said.

Someone suggested that enchanters should not have this ability because it was too much power for one class. Everyone called that person stupid. "YOU MORON! WHAAAA sniff sniff WHAAA enchanters are too overpowered!"

Enchanters threatened to stop hasting people if anyone proposed nerfs to their class.

Overall, it was a nasty situation that would have been better if the 2500% haste wasn't there in the first place.

--------------------------------------------------

Guess what? Exp rezzes are a design mistake. A cleric can save someone a week's work with a spell that takes 5 minutes to med and cast. People are willing to pay an arm and a leg to avoid wasting that much real life time.

I agree when someone says that the game would have been better off without them. Kind of in the same way I'm glad my enchanter doesn't have that 2500% haste, even though I play one.

sheesh once again these boards are home to the ignorant and dumb.
Sarcasm on....

Why not just remove the cleric class all together.

Good now that is complete wait a minute.

Druids are now overpowered. Please eliminate their class or get rid of their sow and porting ability. Oh yeah that snare and kite method simply to powerful reduce their ability to snare , root and dot by 95 percent.

Ahh good now that we have balanced the Druids .. oops lookie that Shamans are now way over powered. Remove their slow and reduce their dots effectiveness. Simply can't have kiting going on at all. Perhaps we should just take out sow all together.

Ahh good now that we have removed clerics, balanced druids and shamans. Wizzies shucks they still have porting capability... well they suck anyways they can keep porting or maybe we should just remove porting all together. Definitely debalances the game yeppers.

hmmm Necros and fear kiting perhaps we should address this as well ?

hmmm Mage's pets. well wait a minute their pets have already been nerfed to nothingness.

sarcasm off.

So then if we do what Evilchu and his cronie followers want and remove the res and complete heal line what good are clerics ? Why would you want a cleric in your group if a druid and Shaman can do the exact same thing and add some extra punch to the group ? Why even have a cleric on a raid ? 

Sorry but spells like Celestial line , Divine light and our buffs would not save the clerics from death nor make us any more useful in raids and groups.

Noodle heads please realize what you are saying. Any massive changes to the Cleric class that does not involve REMOVING IT will cause a further downgrade to druids and Shamans.

There is only way to balance the classes to the liking of ignorant like Evil chu. Simply remove all classes and go to the UO system. Return of the tank mages hoooyahhh !!!!

I don't usually post to threads on any of these message boards. I just read for info's sake. However, in this particular instance I'm so amazed and just saddened by what I see that I think it's necessary to try and educate the sheer ignorance I see being perpetuated on this thread.
"If all the clerics went on strike and refused to provide their services, EQ would become 25 times as risky. I don't think any single other class has that kind of power."

First of all, clerics are clerics because they want to help people. If you've ever played a cleric up to a higher level you know that we can't really solo. We're not at all self sufficient. We are a strictly group oriented class. It's not a particularly glamorous job we've set ourselves up with. And yes I do mean job. I love my cleric more than any other class I've played. I could no more refuse to heal someone or res someone in game than I could walk away from an accident on the side of the road in real life without trying to help in some way. There is no ego boost to being a cleric. The only satisfaction derived is from being needed and having the ability to help people. That's the whole point. Anyone that says otherwise is lying, or just plain doesn't know.

"You are, of course, 100% correct. Rez TOTALLY messes up the high level game. It places HUGE power in the hands of one class (two if you count paladins, but there are much fewer paladins, and they only get the power at high mucher level)."

Reses don't "mess up" anything in the high level game. Reses keep the high level game running. It's one of the biggest conveniences and time savers imaginable. I am proud to be able to offer even a revive to my guild members let alone a res that gives them back some of their hard won experience. Killing the high end game mobs would be near on to impossible without the convenience and privledge of reses. Imagine having to do CR without the benefit of this service that we clerics, and the higher level paladins can offer. Say your guild gets wiped out at Dain and no one has the ability to res. Your tanks are bound in Gfay, Seb, Freeport, wherever. It would take hours to get them all back. It's not a necessary feature by any means, it's a convenience. Maybe the reason some people are bitter about Clerics having the ability to res is because they don't get the resses they want? I have no idea. I run across far too many people in the game that will turn down a lower level res for a higher level one even though they need to wait. It's people like that who think Clerics have too much power and lord it over people. If they realized that ressing is not a right that they are entitled to they might understand better how useful a tool it is. You might as well say that the abilities of porters is over powering. Anyone that has to walk from 20 zones away to get somewhere would disagree. I've done this. I'm grateful to every porter in the game that is willing to do this. I've eaten the exp loss on countless deaths losing a month's worth of work and been happy about it because someone was there to revive me and save me the walk back to my body allowing me to get on with getting my exp back that much faster. 

The language used in some of these posts only drives home the point that the poster is speaking out of spite and/or ignorance. Clerics are certainly not the only class that gets nerfed ( hello necros ) nor are they the only grouped oriented class ( thank god for bards! ). The ability to res ( with or without exp ) is an ability given to our class to aid in our group usefulness. That's our job. That's the whole point of our existence. If you truly think that EQ would be better without clerics, think of what you would be losing if you hijacked shamans and druids to replace us. You'd lose the excellent dotting capabilities of both classes as well as the buffs from both classes ( all of which are extremely useful at all levels and not just higher levels ) not to mention the other unique services both classes can offer. Why? Because they wouldn't have the mana to divert to these other things because they would have to concentrate on healing. The whole point of a cleric is to heal, buff, and yes res. 
I can't believe anyone would be so selfish and ignorant as to suggest that clerics are overpowered. We are constantly having our usefulness reduced because people whine about some misperceived wrong just like this. It's a ridiculous show of immaturity and lack of understanding of a group dynamic. Everyone has a niche to fill. We have ours as well. Leave it be. If you don't like clerics, refuse our services. But can you honestly say that you've never been ressed? You've never been healed by a cleric? Buffed? You've never been helped by a cleric in anyway? Give me a break. By and large the people that become clerics are self sacrificing individuals. We don't get anything out of helping you but the satisfaction of helping. Very rarely do we even receive a thank you. And ressing isn't any kind of picnic for us. It uses ungodly amounts of mana that could be better used in keeping our group alive and well. And our group's health is our first priority. Yet I've seen numerous clerics aid those not in their groups just because they need help. I myself have many times gone out of my way if I have the time (read- I'm not immediately needed by my guild somewhere) to res people that don't know me at all but see that I'm not anon ( because I want to be available to help people ) and have asked me to come and help them get their body back.
So before you go spouting off about a subject you obviously know too little about I recommend you do some real research into the subject rather than just trying to score points with someone or serve your own selfish ends. You will only hurt yourself and others you group with by lobbying to have clerics reduced to utter uselessness. And I pity anyone that actually believes that we're overpowered and need to be further nerfed. I as a cleric could never refuse help even to someone I don't like, because that's the purpose of my whole existence in the game. It's what I like to do. If I wanted glory, I'd be a rogue.

If you could spend 1000pp for a magic potion that gave you the benefits of a rezz of the same level as your character there wouldnt be a problem with it. The cleric is still desired - just not neccessary. 
A simuliar thing would also help if there were clarity potions around the normal potion price range and bark potions were upgraded to be like chloroplast.

Players would still desire each other's abilities. They just wouldnt need them to remain competative. Just as now players still look to shamen/druids/rangers for SoW. The SoW potion is one of the best examples of something done right.

You would also create money sinks that rival the SoW potion which is probably the best one currently in the game.

First of all, personal attacks in any agrument denote a loss. If you can't put forward a better logic than that, don't waste our time please.
Exp rezzes might be overpowered for a game like EQ. After all, it lessens the consequence of death and, in theory, gives clerics the power to boycott the rest of the EQ citizens.

First, from a political science point of view, a boycott is only effective if you can convince a vast majority of people to do it as well. I do not think that clerics as a whole will ever boycott resurecting people. If they did, people would be forced to learn how to get along without it, and this would weaken the cleric position. Not to mention, we're not political power-gamers, we are video power-gamers, and while we like to feel strong, in general, we also like to have fun. Not playing a game you enjoy is not a way to increase fun. And if you don't enjoy the game, then you shouldn't play because it's wasting your time.

Second, yes exp rezzes are powerful. However, Verant realized this as began constructing encounters that required more power to just be succesful, thus balancing the power. This is not necessarily bad. Many people enjoy big encounters with lots of flashing lights, particularly the people devoted enough to get to these epic stages of gaming. Therefor, the power to resurect allows this powerful game play to occur.

Third, in no way does some one else's new or big toy make yours smaller. It may feel that way, but in fact, you can in fact still be powerful and useful with the skills you had before. And if not, learn new skills.

EQ will survive with or without exp rezzes, but their presence in no way hurts those who choose not to accept them, and allows others enhanced game play in the way they like.

Evilchu,
Your argument is flawed simply because you claim Exp. Res. reduces the risk and that this is the main factor influencing it,which is wrong.
The Risk is the chance of dying,and resses have no effect upon this.A ress just reduces the penalty.

The risk(chance of dying),as any player would know increases exponentially with a linear increase of mobs eg
1 mob= 0% chance of groupwipeout
2 mob= 20%
3 mob= 80%
4 mob= certanity
(exact percentages depend on mob lvl vs char lvl)

Thus any method/spell which permits players to avoid this or to reduce the mob numbers faced is inherently more powerfull than resurections.


/sarcasm on

Hence let us all join Evilchu's crusade to redress Risk vs Reward and ask for the following to be removed from the game:-

Evacuation spells
Harmony
Lull type spells
charm spells
Root spells
Feign Death
Mesmerise
etc.
/sarcasm off

An experience res will never ever reduce a 100% chance of dying to anything less than 100%,but any and all of the above can change it drastically.

I think you're wrong, the Risk is not the chance of dying, the Risk is the chance of losing XP, i.e. Hours of Gameplay.
I don't mind dying if we have a Cleric, in fact the best encounters usually end up with a death or two.

I do mind dying if the result is that I lose my whole sessions XP.

The original poster was fundamentally correct. Verant have stated that the main investment in EQ is time, having a Rez available maximises the return on that investment and minimises the 'risk'

Even if you use loss of XP as the definition for risk,a resurrection will nor can not change that chance.
With or without a res the chance of losing XP is the same.A res only changes the amount and thus a player may,due to resses,accept a higher level of risk.There are many factors/abilities/spells which can and do drastically effect the risk and at the end it is better to not die than to die but get ressed.

A good part of the problem with giving a single class the ability to drastically alter the rules of 'risk vs. reward' is this:
Imagine that the ability to resurrect was removed from the cleric and given to warriors (another class that already dominates their function in a group). Do you think Shadowknights would ever find a group again?

I suppose a group might take in a shadowknight to tank for them... it's possible... but only after every warrior on the continent already replied that they were busy. And even then a group would definitely just wait until a warrior was available before doing anything even remotely risky.


Experience return after death needs to be shared ability among all classes of a certain core functionality. In other words... all healers, all casters, or all tanks. Failure to do this has a drastic negative impact on all the other classes that have to share their role with the class that can break the rules of 'risk vs. reward' for their party.

Evilchu, please think.
Risk vs. Reward is balanced around the fact that you will get a res from a cleric. Verant stated this a little while ago if I can remember, correct me if Im wrong.

Removing the rez spells would mean a rebalancing of every encounter in game to make them -easier- and less fun imo.

On large scale raids in Velious, players can end up dieing over 5 times. Without rez, that would mean losing all your exp into lvl 60. 

If you lose all your exp into lvl 60 from every encounter, each person will need to spend hours upon hours during the week gaining exp for every encounter.

Notice I didnt mention sub-60s, the penalty would be even worse as they spend time re-gaining lost exp and rarely gaining anything more.

Now, 3 classes offer rezzes, cleric (priest), paladin (melee), necro (caster). Let me tell you, from your arguments it appears your not even taking into account the high level game, but are talking about exp groups.

A cleric is grouped due to the most efficient healing, rezzes are a bonus. I play a druid, and have been in numerous groups without a cleric. Trust me, the rez spell is not taking away from my desirability to get in a group. 

I dont see paladins replacing warriors in groups, warriors are grouped for their most efficient dmg output and high level of hitpoints.

Necros, obviously their rez is not viable in most situations outside of the high level game. But for casters as a whole, in today's game, they are all being left out of groups and becoming replaced by rogues, monks, and warriors - the greatest damage dealers.

So when talking about risk vs. reward centered around 1 class (the cleric), your obviously forgetting a couple other classes here. 

Rez does not make clerics necassary for grouping, in fact, I hope you wouldnt need to rez, which is unlikely sometimes. But there are always clerics willing to come rez you anyways.

When you get to the high level game, come back and talk about risk vs reward. Experience groups is work and very little fun in this game, the fun doesnt begin till later.

Lol! Evilchu at it again.... Too bad you have never played a cleric and have no clue what you are talking about. Res does not get you in a group. Ask any cleric 49+ who usually waits on a group only to have them rejected for experiencing but asked to come res then when they die. And all you need is ONE cleric for an entire area for they can handle the resess for most zones. Can a group use more than one tank? Ya. Can a group use more than one caster? Ya. Does a group or zone even need more that one cleric for res? Nope, if you know him or if he is willing to give you a res. I didnt res anyone in my party last night but ressed 8 other people who I didnt even know. Take away res from clerics and what can they offer anyone? CH? A one spell class?
I know this is a ploy to give druids Res. You where a main poster about the "monopoly" on heals for clerics. Well, you won and got druids nearly as good of heals as clerics. You said CH was overpowered so they upped the healing agro. Now you say res is too powerful in hopes that VI will give druids res as well.
Go away little boy, I'm sick of your lame reasoning but since VI has no clue they may even listen to this rambling...

Make fun of Evilchu all you want, but his core point is completely valid, particularly in context of Aradune's quotes.
The game is all about risk vs reward. Yet, if you're thinking about playing a support class, you're compelled to play a cleric or a chanter because those classes are far superior at managing risk and increasing reward in most in-game situations. A cleric will have 200% to 400% more mana efficiency than the alternatives, and will cut your risk of experience loss by at least 90% (speaking of the 50+ game). Likewise, an expert enchanter can mez about 3x as many mobs as an expert bard, plus keep haste and clarity on the group at the same time, and maybe even drop a powerful slow spell on the mobs as well. 

The reality of clerics and enchanters is that people feel compelled to play them because they are measurably more powerful, by quite a large margin in fact, at managing risk and increasing reward in most in game situations than any comparable class. That is the very heart of being unbalanced by Aradune's own definition.

ah, risk = reward.
So a 54 lvl cleric cant kill a lvl 35 mob in SS cause its so magic resistant. A reward for killing it is a couple plat maybe? Is this a good risk vs reward situation? 
All the "there should be no healing or resses" poster are OBVIOUSLY not clerics or even support classes! They are jealous soloing classes that solo as high as they can then want a group cause they are bored of soloing now. 
Can a 50+ warrior play without a group? No
Can a 50+ cleric play without a group? No
Put these classes together and they rock.
Can a 50+ druid/necro/bard/shaman/wiz/mage play without a group? Yep

"you're compelled to play a cleric or a chanter because those classes are far superior at managing risk and increasing reward in most in-game situations"
Increasing reward? Nope, I cant farm lvl 35 mobs at lvl 54. I must run through low lvl zones in fear cause I have no invis and no offense. Clerics are a catalyst for a group, without one they are VERY weak.

"A cleric will have 200% to 400% more mana efficiency than the alternatives, and will cut your risk of experience loss by at least 90% (speaking of the 50+ game)"
Bzzt, druids and shaman have very efficient heals (called regens). A cleric's best res is all of 6% better than the paladin's.

Bzzt. They are support classes. The help the group emmensely. Can the group function without them? Yes, but not as well. Can the cleric function without the group? No way.
Unbalanced? Yep, I as a cleric cannont even play my character without a group.

>Clerics are, IMO, the bane of EQ.<
If it weren't for clerics, you'd probably still be level 1. 

Personally, from reading your responses and attacking those offering up contradictions to your very obtuse opinion, I have come to the conclusion that you are not a level 50+ player in a guild, which raids often. Without clerics and resurrections, guild raids would never function. People would have to rebreak the planes naked... run several zones to rejoin a raiding party which took three hours to reach (plane of mischief anyone???). 

I could go on and on about how this spell isn't unbalancing in the least. I believe that you're angry because you cursed out a cleric and wouldn't get a resurrection. If you would stop and think for a minute about how resurrections are necessary, then you wouldn't have so many people throwing you into a corner and tossing stones at you.

Personally, if they do anything to nerf resurrections or even remove them, I'm out... and I'm pretty darn sure every other cleric in the game is out... where does that leave you fancy boy??? Ah yes, it leaves you begging rogues and necros to bring your corpse to a safe place for you so you can loot it and spend the next 40 hours regaining the blue pixel of experience you lost at level 57. 

Let's think before we post next time ok? And if you call me a "whiny little child" it will only prove my point further.

A play on what happens in UO might work - A player dies and his sprit has to walk back to get reborn. How about player rez as is stands now with the addition of NPC rez quests. You can get a soul gem from an NPC and recover your body and then do a quest to return that gem with other items to a NPC cleric that will restore the EXP. Make this cost a lot but it breaks the hold clerics have on the players they might not like.
Ok - now my name has been added to the "do not rez" list - wow big deal - I dont play for EXP but fun - remember that - It's a game.

few things...
I'd probably quit the game if there were no resses. Exp loss sucks, especially post-50, kthxbye. 

I do think putting ress (primarily) in one class's bands is unbalanced, BUT I would worry about the balance of clerics if it was extended to other classes. Of all 7 caster classes, clerics are the most dependent on groups, and as such need to be a little "more balanced" in that regard. But without ress, clerics are just another flavor of healer. You could get a shaman and have slows...you could get a druid and have evac, snare, and lots of other things...or you could get a cleric and have better healing, and better buffs. I'd still think an optimal group would include a cleric, but it'd be iffy.

Ideally, I think, ress would be available (in different forms of course) with all priest classes, but clerics would need to have a better niche.

Yup I agree. Boy, I'm sure glad that they gave that ability to one class. The game revolves around risk/reward, yet only one class in the game (two above 55) has the ability around which it is balanced. Sounds pretty reasonable. Chuckle. 

"Removing the rez spells would mean a rebalancing of every encounter"

Oy! Are you trying to tell me that there is a spell around which encounters must be balanced, because it is so powerful? Jeeze. That sounds pretty uber important. I hope that we give that to a lot of classes. 

Georgia_Everlore:

"If it weren't for clerics, you'd probably still be level 1."

While obviously an exaggeration, I do see Georgia's point. Without ONE class, and their ability to Rez, I would be MUCH lower level. Can I say this about any other spell series in the game, perhaps SoW, but at least Verant has given that to 2.5 classes (rangers count for half, since they are a hybrid and not as common, and because it comes at 30), AND they have added AFORDIABLE SoW potions, AND they have added JBoots. 

"Without clerics and resurrections, guild raids would never function."

Again, are you saying that one spell series, which is basically owned by one class, is the spell which enables high level play! Wow. That just sounds wrong. Doesn't it!

Indeed all of these spells, basically, have the same purpose; they reduce the number of active MOBs in a given encounter. However, let us look at how many classes have been given this general class of abilities: lull/harmony (druid, ranger, cleric, enchanter, bard), root (all casting classes except for mage), feign death (monk, necro, Shadow Knight), Mez (enchanter, bard, necro), charm (enchanter, bard, to a lesser degree, druid and shaman). As we can see the meta-ability of reducing the number of active MOBs has been spread across ALL of thr casting classes because it is a very important risk/reward balancing mechanism. However, Rez was only given to clerics, and to a much lesser extent paladins, and to a MUCH MUCH lesser extent necromancers.

LOL Road Kill, I was about to post and you beat me to it and better.
The truth is Complete Heal and Rez are degenerate and break the game. A great deal of the game is designed around these abilities of one class.

Can it be fixed? Probably not.

Note to whingeing Wizards (of which I have one and sympathize) most likely the reason VI does nothing to address Wizard uselessness (the bane spells are just silly at best and an insult at worst) late in the game is because they haven't yet decided if they want to try to tackle the real issue, or conntinue inflation. If they do something about the real issues, complete heal, and rez then they don't need to do anything about Wizards or anyone else, but the WILL have to do something about a lot of mobs and that's a ton of work.

Most likely they will inflate the other classes to be something like useful, because that is easier.

I have a problem with their vision anyway. I don't think any group make up should be drastically better in the majority of situations. Six int casters should be able to make up for the lack of melee and healing ability with increased firepower, and six clerics should be able to make up for lack of firepower with healing ability, and six tanks should be able to overwhelm the enemy with brute force. The tactics should change, but the gradient between suboptimal heterogenous class group efficiency and optimal class balanced group efficiency should be LINEAR and not EXPONENTIAL.

Thanks you for bringing this imbalance to my attention. I will be sure to quote you when my group asks me why I refuse to res them. I am sure they will understand that it is in the name of balance and, thus, for the good of the game. 
If only I could remove the spell from my book, then I could feel equal to the rest of the classes. I had no idea how much I was hurting my fellow players by using such a dangerously unbalanced spell. Shame on me for trying to help others.

I am wondering if you would be so good as to post your character(s) names and server(s) so I could come and offer you a more personal thank you? Whats that...?

I still see the ignorant still post on this issue.
I have yet to see one logical arguement as to how both CH and Res debalance the game. Not one well thought out response has been seen thus far.

CH= My cleric uses it maybe once ot twice a week now for regular grouping. I use it a couple times on uber raids. Even after the heal agro adjustment it still marks me for a quick and fast death. Complete heal has been adjusted with the heal agro it is no longer an issue and no longer debalances the game according to anti ch peoples arguements. I now have to use smaller heals so that the monsters dont noticed me right off the bat. Still though in a multi mob pull my hate eventually leads up to the point where I can't back off and med anymore. Thats fine I needed my cleric's life to be spruced up a bit. Once again healing and yes res is all my cleric offers to the high level group period.

Res line : exactly how does this debalance the game ? and should every class have it ? If you play with half a brain and play with the same type of people you will rarely die after level 35. Still though when you do die its nice to know that you have a shot at getting some of that exp back.

Take away the Clerics res line a cleric becomes redundant on a high level raid. Yep you bet I said it the only reason a cleric is able to go on a high level raid is for their res. Any Drood or shaman can easily match my clerics healing ability with recent improvements and well if you cant your a moron. I have seen it done and I have done it with my 53 shaman as well. I have spent alot of time acquiring the items I need to make sure my Shaman has the mana nescessary to heal effectively.

People who claim that CH and Res debalance the game are not thinking straight and have NOT A CLUE to the game mechanics and true balance. Verant has given the res line to two classes in the post 50 game. More than adequate. 

btw My cleric has had bodies res rot in PoF and many other such high level places. So I have suffered from my share of exp loss as well. 

So then oh mighty smart ones how would you address the claimed res issue ? remove it from clerics ? and have verant totally retool the game ? Give it to all classes therefore making all the clerics hit the delete button on their clerics ?

I see complaining and whining and MAINLY Class envy Im not happy with my quad kiting ability replies. But none that mention how to really address this Claimed issue.

I'll tell you why rez and CH are unbalanced - it's simple math. I'm not sure how applicable this is now with the new hate modifiers, but let's take the situation pre-hate changes.
CH has a very large mana-efficiency, ESPECIALLY when you have a very high hitpoint tank (read fatty warrior). The higher the hitpoints of the tank, the more mana-efficient the spell becomes. At high levels, therefore, there is a HUGE incentive to have your tank be a fattie warrior and have a cleric do the healing. You can simply kill more monsters with less mana than any other way.

This is unbalancing because Verant has had to take into consideration this efficient situation and has lifted the HP cap in SoV and made mobs VERY hard to kill, because of their huge HPs and fast attacks. If the CH/Fattie Tank syndrome did not exist, and super heal etc. were the healing methods of choice, you could have almost any tank take the beating, and high AC would matter, instead of high HP. (this is because the mana efficiency of super heal and divine light etc. would no longer depend on the HP of the tank because the spells would heal only a fixed amount of HP for a fixed amount of mana).

Verant could then rebalance the game and have easier mobs because they would no longer have to balance the game against the uber-efficient CH/Fattie tank combo.

If Verant can't rebalance the mobs without nerfing CH because it would become too easy.

If you get rid of CH as a combat spell (which the new hate modifiers may have done) you then make all the other tanks (especially SKs and Pallies) more useful and warriors less so. You don't make up for the increase in damage/time done by the warrior of course, but it's at least a step in the right directions.

Oh and the reason rez is unbalanced is because if you have a res you lose far more xp than if you don't have one - which works out to lots of playing time. Because few classes get the good xp resses, it puts a very large amount of power in their hands. Luckily most people are willing to rez folks, but what if there was a strike or a vendetta against someone? That person, assuming he wasn't a cleric, would have far more risk than someone who had a cleric buddy.
Too much power in too few hands is unbalancing.

The answer to the "rez is unbalancing" argument is to either give the good xp rezes to more people (e.g. paladins and necros and bards) OR to reduce the death penalty so that all rez would do is teleport you back to your corpse to reduce CR time. 

I hope this seems more well-thought out than Roadkill's posts. Flamebait.
