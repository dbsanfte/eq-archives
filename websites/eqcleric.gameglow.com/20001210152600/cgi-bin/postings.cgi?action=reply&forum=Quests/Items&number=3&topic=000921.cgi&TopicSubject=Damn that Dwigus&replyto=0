<TEXTAREA NAME="ReplyMessage" ROWS=10 COLS=45 WRAP="VIRTUAL">[QUOTE]Originally posted by Kelric:
[B]Yesterday started off pretty well for me.  I ran to Runneye, stumbled around the dungeon for a while and ran right into Sludge.  Few wraths, woohoo, half of the bp quest done.  As I leave the Gorge, I run into a druid getting pounded on by Broon.  I quickly root/fear and wrathed Broon.  Turns out the druid had tried to kite him and had run out of mana.  Very nice druid and very thankful for saving his butt.  He offers to do me a favor.  Woohoo I get a port Butcherblock and a quicked sowed run to Dagnors Cauldron.

This is where things went bad.  I zone in, and ask /ooc Has seen anyone seen Dwigus?  Get a tell from another nice druid (go figure  ;) ) that he had killed him a couple hours earlier, without knowing who he was.  Turns out the piece rotted on the ground.  Doh!! So I wander round and round that bathtub for the next couple hours.  Buff and heal a few people along the way.  I asked every 15-20 if anyone has seen him.  No answer.  Swimming around I run right into Dwigus.  Follow him up the shore, my buffs still in place, full mana, I root and wrath.  Then proceeded to get a butt whooping.  I got a few more stuns and wraths off, but no roots.  Got him to maybe half health before I died.  Came back, searched desperatly for him, no one will tell me if he's on track or even around.  Finally I gave up and looted my corpse.

All in all a very pathetic end to a day.  So, here are my questions.  What level do you need to be to solo Dwigus?  I'm 37th.  Seems he's a roamer, what's the best way to find him, without the ability to track?  Is he a 4 hour spawn, or did I get lucky on the timing?

I thought I might try again tonight.  Maybe I'll get lucky and run into a stranger willing to lend a poor cleric hand.

A level 40 Cleric can not even solo him.<P>You just need to bring along a tank that you heal, while the tank pounds on Dwigus.<P>It's the same concept for when you have to fight Lord Grimrot for the Aegis of Life quest.<P>I did it at level 38 with a 35 level magician. Dwige went through two magician pets. He's pretty tough.</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#dedfdf"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Illyna</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">I would think you may want to be 44 with retro to solo this guy.<P>Get a warrior friend which gets a yellow con at worse from Dwiggy and the two of you can do it easy. Hire a tracker too. Worth the coin. Can be a 20th ranger and you'll make their day. If you really don't want to hire a tracker I'd suggest running between the Unrest tunnel and the Gob camp staying close to the water. Pretty boring way for two people to spend 4 hours. Been there.<P>Not positive but 4 hours with a random has been my conclusion.<P>Good luck.</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#f7f7f7"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Manini</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">He was almost exactly 4 hours when I last timed him.  Like clockwork.<P>Get your Ranger at least at lvl 22 so they can cast water breathing.  Then they (or you) can dive down deep and pull Dwigus up to shore.<P>Sit the tracker on the top of the island and they will pick up Dwigus as soon as he spawns.  <P>If you get a lvl 35ish or higher Ranger and yourself.. then you have everything you need.  Ranger to track, water breath and tank.. you to heal, root and wrath.<P>Also, what did he con to you at 37?

I play a dark elf, and all my friends are dark elves, trolls, or ogres.  Ack!! The idea of having to hire a ranger never occured to me.  I guess this trip is going to be a waste, as I don't bring enough money to "hire" a ranger for 4 hour, and get home.  Hmmmmm  Anyway Dwigus conned blue to me at 37th, and proceeded to hand me my arse.  Wasn't much of a fight really.  Perhaps I'll be able to beg a guildmate or two to lend a hand.  <P>As a side note, kinda sucks that this armor isn't very good when you can go get it yourself.  To get it earlier you have to drag someone else along on a boring camp.

At level 34 I was able to take him down with myself and a wiz though used all our mana and I had to  use a super heal to keepmyself alive, too bad that stupid hero hit once for 30 as the last hit.  When i finaly got him I belive it was myself and 2 tanks and it was not too bad.

"No problem" I thought.<P>Boy did I get a spanking. If it wasn't for Jboots I would have had to trot back from GFay in my undies.<P>Maybe I was just unlucky but my roots were of short duration and his ballistic punching made it very hard to get spells off. I got him down about a third but I probably spent as much mana healing myself as in blasting him.
