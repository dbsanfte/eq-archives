<TEXTAREA NAME="ReplyMessage" ROWS=10 COLS=45 WRAP="VIRTUAL">[QUOTE]Originally posted by ejkas:
[B]As a cleric you have 3 main lines of spells
1) First is the Courage line of spells. This is an hp/ac buff, and our most widely used buff. You cannot stack one hp/ac buff with another. In other words you cannot cast daring on someone with valor. In situations where you do attempt to cast a spell from this line on someone with an hp/ac buff 2 things can happen. If your spell is a higher level spell or is the same spell being cast from a higher level, your spell will overwrite the old hp/ac buff. If your spell (as in your situation with drive by buffs) is lower level than that on your target, you will get a message that your spell would not take hold. Don't worry about this... be grateful you don't lose mana anymore when this happens.
Druids have a line of buffs that are also hp/ac, they are the ones that start Skin like _____ (wood, stone, steel, etc). Because of the nature of their buffs, this line of spells will not stack with the cleric courage line. If a higher level druid gives your friend Skin like Nature, you will be unable to cast bravery on him/her.
Our spells in this line are: (lvl)
Courage (1)
Center (9)
Daring (19)
Bravery (24)
Valor (34)
Resolution (44)
Heroism (52)
Fortitude (55)
Aegolism (60)

2) The second line of buffs we receive is a line of Armor class buffs. This is the line starting with Holy Armor. As with hp/ac buffs, ac buffs will not stack with other ac buffs. You cannot cast Spirit armor on a person with Shield of Words. You won't find too much conflict with other classes on this. Rangers are the only class I can think of that might interfere with this. Other buffs, shaman ones in particular, can buff stats that cause an increase in ac; these stack. Your main conflict will come from higher level clerics buffing higher level spells.
Spells in this line: (lvl)
Holy Armor (5)
Spirit Armor (19)
Guard (29)
Armor of Faith (39)
Shield of Words (49)
Bulwark of Faith (57)
Aegis (57)
Aegolism (60)

3) Finally we have our symbol spells. These spells provide an increase in hit points. Symbol spells all require reagents (gems). As with ac buffs, the only conflict you should find is with a higher level cleric buffing your friend.
The symbol spells are: (gem)(lvl)
Symbol of Transal (Cats Eye Agate)(14)
Symbol of Ryltan (Bloodstone)(24)
Symbol of Pinzarn (Jasper)(34)
Symbol of Naltron (Peridot)(44)
Symbol of Marzin (Peridot)(54)
Aegolism (Peridot)(60)

You'll notice I listed Aegolism under all three types of buffs. Aegolism includes the effects of each line of buffs. No hp/ac, ac, or hp spells will stack with Aegolism. Again, the shaman riotous health spells buff stamina causing increased hp, and will stack.

As far as what you can do about it, you have your options. With higher level buffs your tank, and therefore your team, is stronger. I would just start healing earlier if you are worried about the time it take you to heal. You are healing her just as efficiently as before, your spells arent changed. I realize that before you were able to heal 25% of your friends hp in a heal and now only heal 18-19%. This is less than a bubble of health and so seems ineffective. Keep healing or do something else. Your tank can survive longer without your help now, so maybe you have mana to throw in a nuke. If you can kill the mob faster than before, using the same amount of mana as before from healing, then your group has been improved.

If the other buffs really bother you, ask the person not to buff. If they already have, you can ask your friend to click them off (left clicking a beneficial buff removes it) and then cast your own. I don't recommend doing this. Save your mana, kill more, get exp, and then you'll eventually get those buffs that are causing you trouble.


Good Luck,
Ejkas[/B][/QUOTE]

My tanks love it since trying to heal a warrior with 750 to 900 hps using "Healing" was kind of rough on me. Now I can wait till they are at 75% before I start healing.<P> I normally team up with my friend Pippypie Fearless Gnome Warrior and were a good duo and really have alot of fun. We have been primarily in Pauldral Caverns getting insane XP.<P> Here is my situation. Much higher level players like to come along and drive by buff. This really makes Pippypie happy (+1200 HPs with the buff) but now I cannot heal her as efficiently as before. The only time it becomes a problem is when theres a bad pull and we have many adds. <BR> <BR> I also cannot buff her. My cleric buffs won't stick? I guess this is a stacking issue?<P>1: Ok so how do I deal with players Drive-By-Buffing my tank(s)? (I don't mind just need advice)<P>2: Where can I learn about buffs that do and don't stack?<P> Thank you for any and all replies.<P>Grneyes<BR>26 Healer of Brell<BR>Zeb server</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#f7f7f7"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Corish-MT</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Actually it doesn't matter how many HP your melee has, if you can't heal faster then they take damage.  There's zero difference in down-time between trying to heal a 1000 HP warrior, and a 2000 HP warrior (assuming you don't have complete heal).  If both are taking 500 HP of damage per minute, you need to heal 500 HP of damage per minute.  With either melee, you're going to run out of mana at the same time, at which point you have to stop and rest.<P>More HP on a melee just means you can fight for longer in a single fight before you have to start casting heals.  They still take the same amount of damage during that fight, you just have a larger "safety margin" before they fall over dead.  Since melees fight just as well at 40% health as at 100% health, more HP is just safety margin.<P>er, hopefully all that makes sense.<P>Now, where you may have an issue is when you are using the Courage-Bravery-Valor-etc as a heal (it's very efficient at around 2 HP per mana, and also a low-taunt heal).  None of the spells in that "Valor" line will stack, and you can't overwrite an upper level buff in that spell line with a lower level buff from the same spell line.<P>Hmm, mid-20s, you'll get Superior Healing soon, plus you have Celestial Remedy, and your "Valor" line is a very viable heal now.<P>Pop on over to: <A HREF="http://eq.castersrealm.com/spells/spells.asp?Class=Cleric" TARGET=_blank>http://eq.castersrealm.com/spells/spells.asp?Class=Cleric</A> <P>Basically we have (2) lines of HP and HP/AC buff spells:<P>Valor: courage-bravery-valor-resolution-etc.<BR>Symbols: pizarn, naltron, etcc.<P>You can't stack two spells from the same "line" on a single person.  Higher level spells from the same line will over-write lower-level spells, and lower-level spells won't stick if the higher level buff is already on that person.  Also, our valor line, conflicts with the druids "skin like" line.  You'll need to discuss it over with any druids from your mid-20s on as to whether you'll use the "valor" line, or their "skin like" line of spells on your groupmates.<P>------------------<BR>Corish, 46 Cleric of Morell-Thule</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#dedfdf"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Corish-MT</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Hmmm, a few more things (you've got me thinking)...<P>Not sure if this is possible in your mid-20s, but ideally, a single-mob fight should only take 20% of your mana pool (maybe 30%).  I've found this to be true starting somewhere in my mid-30s, while the druids and wizards are constantly saying 20m, 30m after a fight, I'm saying 80m and the puller runs off and pulls another one.  My reason for saying a fight should leave you at 80% (which you can usually med back up before the next fight)?  60-70% of your mana bar is for emergency use only (picture 4 mobs suddenly showing up at camp, you're going to burn a lot of mana on crowd-control, healing people who got aggro until things get locked down and you can start medding again).  All of a sudden, you'll be looked at as "smart" for saving your mana for an emergency rather than nuking to speed up fights.<P>Maybe not possible in the late 20s, unless you have a solid main tank, and people are keeping aggro on the tank and not ping-ponging the mob.  It was just something that I thought of as I wondered if, since I was always at 80m, if I should start nuking.<P>-------<P>I also wanted to revisit my numbers on whether more HP means less efficient healing...<P>1000 HP tank<BR>500 dmg per fight from a mob<BR>1 minute per mob fight<BR>I regain 25% of my mana each minute<BR>I can heal 2000 HP if I'm at full mana.<P>In that scenario, I will never run out of mana because I med back 500 HP worth of healing power each minute (25% of 2000 HP) which I then heal the tank with because they took 500 HP worth of damage during that minute.<P>However, if the mobs suddenly start dealing 600 dmg per fight, and the pull rate is still once per minute.  I'm going to run out of mana after about 20 fights (I start with 2000 HP of healing power, but only have 1900 HP of healing power after the first minute because healing the melee took 30% of my mana, and I only med back 25% of my mana pool per minute, meaning that I'm losing 5% mana per minute fought).<P>Once I run dry (around 20 minutes), we have to stop and meditate for 4 minutes for me to med back to full.  And the only reason is that the mobs did more damage per minute then my meditating could keep up with.<P>------------------<BR>Corish, 46 Cleric of Morell-Thule</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#f7f7f7"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">ejkas</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">As a cleric you have 3 main lines of spells<BR>1) First is the Courage line of spells.

I  guess I really showed my ignorance.<BR> <BR> Am I correct in thinking that I could just repeatedly cast Bravery on my tank which would be low aggro and also sort of a heal at the same time? Casting Bravery twice would restore 280 hps and 140 manna where as GH heals for 300 hps and costs me 150 manna? WOW I certainly wished I had known or figured this out sooner (if I am correct). <BR> <BR> Many times I would cast Celestial Remedy on Pippy when she brought adds just so that she would get the benefit of the spell and I wouldn't get knocked around. Eventually I would cast GH to keep her going but that normally meant that I was trying to root park one of the adds now so interested in me.<BR> <BR> I cannot wait to tell her what I learned. She tends to over protect me since she found without me around she doesn't last long.<BR> <BR> I have nearly broken Pippy of the habit of leaving her mob to come assist me. I think its easier just for her to concentrate on what she is doing and let me deal with whatever has taken an interest in me. Sometimes when root will work I park it. If she is close to finishing her MOB but I am taking massive damage (Bandits in PC can hit for up to 100) I will DA and hope 18 seconds is enough.

Also if its skin like nature(sln) or higher, i believe they all have a small regen component to them(1 extra hp regen per tick i think it is).

I cant see any buff that over writes yours being any worse for you. I think whats happening is your feeling inferior when your tank now has alot more hp due to a high level buff and visualy, your heal makes less of an impact. in reality how every our not healing any less hp then you did before.<P>second, useing buffs as heals. what most everyone seems to forget, and this actually only makes a difference after level 30, is you SAVE mana when you specialize in alteration. so when you get pretty high in your specialize, you use less mana than the spell calls for. (High levels can see this happen often when you have just whiped out and your medding up resurections.. you click JUST as you have enough mana to cast yet when your done casting, you still have a sliver of mana left.) this is also why buffing seems like it whipes your mana out faster.<P>------------------<BR>---<P><A HREF="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=32524" TARGET=_blank>Magelo Profile</A></FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#f7f7f7"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">JanSorensen</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">At level 24 it will be something like this (note that spells dont do the full benifit at first you get them - and that we as clerics heal 5% more than listed for heals but not buffs)<P>Healing - 99 hp / 60 mana / 3.0 sec (1.65)<BR>CelRem - 295 hp / 190 mana / 28.0 sec (1.55)<BR>Bravery - 114 hp / 70 mana / 2.75 sec (1.63)<BR>GH - 302 hp / 150 mana / 3.75 sec (2.01)<P>Using Bravary as a heal has the added value that you never have to rebuff it  <IMG SRC="http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/smile.gif"> I still remember having to teach druids in MM *not* to Skin people as I was using Bravery + GH as my heal spells.<P>------------------<BR><A HREF="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=4264" TARGET=_blank>Mikar of the Nexus</A><BR>High Priest of Brell<BR><A HREF="http://companions.windsofstorm.net/" TARGET=_blank>The Companions</A><BR>The Tribunal</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#dedfdf"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Corish-MT</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Hmm, the numbers you gave for Bravery seem a bit off (maybe you gave the minimum amount of HP gained when you first get the spell at level 24?).  At full effect, Bravery is more like 140 hp (giving you a 2.00 ratio).<P>Healing - 99 hp / 60 mana / 3.0 sec (1.65)<BR>CelRem - 295 hp / 190 mana / 28.0 sec (1.55)<BR>Bravery - 140 hp / 70 mana / 2.75 sec (2.00)<BR>GH - 302 hp / 150 mana / 3.75 sec (2.01)<P>and to continue the trend, at level 34 you get:<P>Superior - 583 hp / 250 mana / 4.5 sec (2.332)<BR>Valor - 200 hp / 90 mana / 3.0 sec (2.22)<P>/em nods at Luminar<P>Specialization is really starting to kick in for me in my mid-late 40s.  That extra 15% you save (approximately, when it kicks in) usually means an extra heal somewhere in that full bar of mana.  Even so, I still use Resolution as a touch-up heal when I'm either looking to avoid aggro on a caster who's over-nuked (and isn't still getting beat on) because it's a fast cast or when I only need to heal about 250 hp.<P>/em waves at Grneyes<P>Yes, you can chain-cast bravery (it refreshes instantly, unlike a stun with a few second recast time).  Sooner or later you will gain aggro from it (or event CelRmdy) as it is only a low-taunt heal.  <P>If you want to go to "aggro-management boot camp" go get yourself into the High Keep Warrior Room group at level 26.  Just show up early in the prime time, and you'll be more likely either to help start the WR group or get on the list soon enough that you don't have to wait all day.  Nothing like 2-3 unmezzed goblins running around while you're trying to keep everyone alive and avoid aggro.  (My worst day in there was 5-6 deaths, and 3 were me dying.)  You'll learn the value of channeling, and healing with your back to a corner to avoid getting interrupted while casting.<P>Also a good place to play zergling healer (die after running out of mana, memorize your heal spells quick, jump back in naked with a full bar of mana).  You'll only have maybe 2/3 the mana that you have fully-geared, but it's 2/3 more mana then you had when you died.  Granted, playing zergling healer is not always popular with your groupmates and does a good bit of damage to your experience bar.  But in a pinch, it can keep deaths to a minimum when you get overrun.<P>------------------<BR>Corish, 46 Cleric of Morell-Thule</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#f7f7f7"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Tundar</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">I like to do drive by buffing.<BR>If you buff someone with "just" a 26 cleric the best thing you can do is casting an AC buff.
