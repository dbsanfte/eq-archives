Eventually, I was in with myself, and another cleric level 52. The other 4 group members were variable and constantly changing. <P>Anyway, the other cleric did Heroism (since I don't have it yet) and I did SoWords and Symbols. I was freely looting most every kill for the cash-flow/FS weapons and such. Group also gave me the 2 mith amulets that dropped.<P>I was primary healer allowing other cleric to nuke (higher level = fewer resists).<P>By the time the day was over, I was down over 40 peridots and 20 jaspers. I went to FV, sold and restocked my peridots/jaspers, and had 3pp left. Thats right, I broke even for 7 hours of playtime. And the only reason I did that was I did 2 resses for 100pp at the bank right after gating out.<P>I did pick up 3 1/2 blue bubs of 51 exp, and got one of the Warlords supple wrist things (ac3, +5wis, +5int, +25mana, +10vs fire.) by default (lost first 2 rolls). <P>The other cleric got a supple wrist thing, a pair of Druid gloves off a hand (group lotto, no druid in group) AND beat me on the only pair of Donal's Gaunt's I saw drop all day.<P>Sometimes it pays to be stingy. Sometimes, it doesn't. The other 4 group members present at the time ALL told me in /tell that in the future they would take me over the other cleric cause I am more honorable, nicer and am not stingy on my symbol casting at all. (I naltron all tanks and chanters, pinzarn anyone else who ask for it.)<P>So, do your own thing. Be stingy about cash for your peridots if you have too. Be greedy when it comes to looting those corpses for Plat and FS. You can get away with it if you are also freely casting those symbols when they drop. If you're not, and still looting and such, people take notice. And that's the rep you DON'T want.</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#f7f7f7"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">JaigeTZ</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Hmmm, how wacky... from a night or two of exping (about 4.5 blues in a night) I had like 1k in cashloots, and only had to buy 24 more peridots and refill my stacks of jaspers. <P>*shrug*<P>------------------<BR><B>Jaige</B><BR>51 Regent of Innoruuk<BR><A HREF="http://pub19.ezboard.com/bedarkie" TARGET=_blank>Eternal Darkness</A><BR>Tallon Zek</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#dedfdf"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Dikmer</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial"> <BLOCKQUOTE><font size="1" face="Verdana, Arial">quote:</font><HR>Originally posted by JaigeTZ:<BR><B>Hmmm, how wacky... from a night or two of exping (about 4.5 blues in a night) I had like 1k in cashloots, and only had to buy 24 more peridots and refill my stacks of jaspers. <P>*shrug*<BR></B><HR></BLOCKQUOTE><P>Part of the problem is I am apprehensive in FV and pay 14.5pp a pop for peridots. And, with 3 tanks and a chanter most of the time, I was doing 4 naltrons an hour, plus when 1 person left and another came in, I was hitting them with one too. Adds up fairly quick. I may not have had all my stacks full, but I do know I bought 41 peridots to top off my normal stock of 4 stacks.<P>Of course, I kinda feel you missed the point of the post. It's not about how much I spent or how many gems I had to buy, but about rep, and how other people look at us "stingy" clerics who usually have to foot the bill for the groups symbol welfare.</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#f7f7f7"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Viscera</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Well, in my opinion, if I'm down cash-wise from raiding, and certain exp camps with friends, I hit Sebilis. Cash drops there are phenomenal, and I get 'em all.  <IMG SRC="http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/smile.gif"> Well, now that I'm casting group symbol, I try occasionally to share the cash items. Last Saturday, was in the crypt for about 12 hours (yeah, bite me  <IMG SRC="http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/smile.gif">), and walked out with more than 3k in cash drops, not to mention about 4-5 other loot items.<P>Karnors sucks for cash drops, so I don't mind taking a loss there. Sebilis is where I go to replenish my bank account. Velk's Lab kobold area is pretty good too, with the common cash drops there (10-20pp each or so).<P>Lastly, when you are going to sell your cash items, and buy some peridots, get a CHA buff from a chanter or shaman. It helps a ton. I've never had a problem having either the person in my group buff me before the group disbands, or offer to trade buffs with someone in FV itself.<P>Good luck.<P>------------------<BR>Viscera Galen<BR>L60 High Priest of Brell<BR><A HREF="http://members.home.net/wire23" TARGET=_blank>Black Tower</A><BR>Xegony</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#dedfdf"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Darianne</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><BR>I carry a "Cha in a bag kit" from my local enchanter... sure its a pain switching up 8 items to buy stuff... but I'm a halfling with base 50 CHA... and I manage to hit 113 with my kit... and peri's cost me 10.5 in FV.<BR></FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#f7f7f7"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Aquinas</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><B>I naltron all tanks and chanters, pinzarn anyone else who ask for it</B><P>Well, I guess I'm stingy in comparison to you.  Personally, I think that symbols are over-used and over-demanded buffs.  Since they're pure HP buffs, they don't increase your group's efficiency except insofar as they're used on a tank that you're healing with CH.<P>The only other function of additional hit points is to provide an additional margin of safety if people are routinely being beaten down to low health.  I find that most of my day-to-day hunting simply doesn't occur under those circumstances.  To the contrary, I usually try to seek out situations where we're getting controlled pulls that are challenging but not constantly life-threatenting.<P>My only "standard" symbol is the enchanter if we have one, and that may be either Pinzarn or Marzin depending on where we're hunting.  If I have a heavy tank that I'm CH'ing a lot, I will usually (though not always) symbol him as well.  And if the puller is getting beat up a lot on his way back to the group, I'll symbol him as well, so he's not stumbling back with 30% health all the time.  That's it, really; everything else is situational, and for the most part other people (including myself) can do without.<P>Of course, there are situations were efficiency is not your primary concern, like raids, breaking a tough spawn, or perhaps venturing into a dungeon where your group is in a little over its head.  But for everyday hunting in reasonably controlled circumstances, I think the "symbol everyone" approach is wasteful.  If you can keep everyone healed safely with a given buff setup, adding more symbols to the mix just burns up mana and money without any return.<BR><p>[This message has been edited by Aquinas (edited 03-14-2001).]</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#dedfdf"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Dalur - Veeshan</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Epic helps a lot with this.<P>I too have a bad with +cha gear.

My experience is you're just going to encounter them from time to time.  <P>Had a guild mate, a tank, complaining about greedy clerics looting all the gems.  A couple of guild clerics tried to explain about the incredible costs we have, but he just wasn't interested in hearing the message.  <P>So, I just don't think there's a lot you can do.  Figure that some people are going to be greedy and not wish to hear your side of it. Just be stubborn and stick to your guns. </FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#dedfdf"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Jubal</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">If you get CHA to 105 you will get the best possible price (for your faction). Above that has no effect. I carry a few CHA items (some jewelcraft-made ring, white gold necklace, EM bracer) in a bag for buying peridot, it's definitely worth the small hassle. Of course I'm not an ugly dorf either but hey, we can't all be perfect missionaries of Tunare. But I digress...<P>Dikmer, if cash is a problem for you, head to Old Sebilis, do not pass Go, do not collect $200. Even in the easiest camps any halfway decent group will make hundreds of plat per hour, much of it on gem drops, and also obtain spells, the occasional rare gem, and valuable items. The most valuable things will always be distributed by NBG (need before greed) but still you will make out like a bandit. Personally I ask for pp for peridots at the end of the night to be taken off the top of the group take before split, unless it's obvious we'd been working at an operating loss for the session - which happens often in KC but never in OS.<P>Tonight at the chef camp (not the most lucrative camp in OS, but decent) after the 145pp compensation for peridot each member of the group received 283pp 110gp, then we rolled to distribute the 7 things we got that were not assigned by NBG. I got the second pick and walked away with a mrylokars helm (rog kunark armor). We also got the mrylo arms, a couple of sebilite scale items (each worth 800p or more, conservatively speaking), and a few 51-54 spells. This is about an average night for a good group in Sebilis.<BR></FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#f7f7f7"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Lydia</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Honestly I dont understand why people dont carry their own symbol components. In 42 levels of playing a cleric I have met one warrior who carried his own stones. I dont mind paying to symbol the chanter but with all the strength a warrior has I don't understand why this didnt just become a cultural habit.<P>Maybe it will change at the higher levels but so far every group seems to do ffa loot rules ...... and from what I've seen ffa = melees loot when it hits the ground and casters who are scrambling for enough mana never get to loot.<P>So at 42 I am still always far too broke to freely apply symbol everywhere I go.<P>Oh and then there's the group member who begs for symbol and you no sooner finish casting it and they announce " ok gotta go guys, see ya" .......don't EVEN get me started on that  <IMG SRC="http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/tongue.gif"><BR> </FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#dedfdf"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">SeaOfHoles</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Part of the problem is people want Symbols, even when the situation doesnt require them.

I didn't symbol someone a long time ago and they died.  Don't know if hte symbol would have made a difference or not, neither does my friend.  But, of course, being human, one wonders.
