I'm not comfortable with the "best way" to respond to some of the more intense group situations, so I'm hoping the experts in this forum can advise me in terms of the below encounter in particular and in terms of general group strategies. <P>The Encounter<BR>Our group consisted of..<BR>1 Ogre Warrior 11<BR>1 Drow Enchanter 11<BR>1 Drow Magician 11<BR>1 Dwarf Cleric 11 (Me)<P>We were working one ofthe Derv Camps in north ro. We'd just finished a fight with a dervish warrior and a madman who jumped the enchanter.  I told the group I was meding and had 2 bubbles of mana left.  <P>The ogre said to med through the next fight.  I moved up one of the hills a little bit, so any pulls wouldn't jump me for meding.  <P>Now this next piece is based on what I was told after the encounter.. since I was meding and not pulling  <IMG SRC="http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/smile.gif"><P>Apparently they soothed a derv caster and pulled a derv warrior.  The warrior ran right past the derv caster and the caster followed the warrior.  <P>I did not receive and group messages or tells about the above.. my first clue was the enchanter health bubble moving reaching half..  Now I was watching his bubble... he tends to pull and sometimes will drop as low as 3 bubbs before the Ogre taunts the mob away... So as I stand up to heal the enchanter.. (and the now slightly injured ogre) I start receiving the group messges asking for healing.<P>I stand shoot a light healing at the enchanter who is running to zone.  The magician pulls the derv caster off the enchanter and has his skeleton fighting and seems to be running to zone.  The ogre is fighting the derv warrior and is now at 2.5 or so bubbles.  <P>I start light healing the ogre.. eventually letting him no when I'm at 2 and then 0 mana.  He kills the derv warrior but the caster (who has killed the magician) is back as soon as the warrior falls.  I'm meding.  I see the Ogre die.. stand a divine aura.  But the aura runs out before i can zone.<P>After we all retrieve our corpses, the magician is mad that I didn't heal him.  I explained that my 30 hp heal with a 6 or so second delay.. Won't do much against dervs hitting for 28 every 4 seconds.<P>I didn't tell him this... but it seems  I had a choice of saving (attempting to save really) him or the ogre. <P>What could I have done different?  I had stun, root, and soothe mem'd.  I was told not to fear since it could bring back more trouble.  <P>Thanks in advance for your input,<P>Atvorn<BR>Dwarven Cleric 11<BR>Luclin Server<BR></FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#f7f7f7"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Dalur - Veeshan</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">First off at level 11, I would be soloing - much more effective at your level than grouping.<P>But since you were grouping, it sounds like you were doing what you were supposed to be doing.<P>People get angry when they die and naturally they will blame you for it.  You just have to learn to be a little thick skinned at times and do your best that you know how.<P>In your situation since you were running for the zone, it probably wouldn't have hurt to fear whatever it was you were fighting.  That would give you and everybody else still alive in your group a few extra seconds to get away.<BR><P>------------------<BR>Dalur Stouthealer<BR>60th Dwarven High Priest<BR>Veeshan Server</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#dedfdf"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Josiefuz</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Sounds to me like you did the right thing.  Remember that tactics will change as you go up in level.  Here's some things you could keep in mind, but none of them are sure-fire ways to survive an overpull like that.<P>1.  Know when to zone.  If you're not going to win, then zone the mobs.  Especially in an outdoor zone, dying should be rare.  This skill takes time to develop, but the cleric is usually the first one to know and call the retreat because you monitor the healing power (your mana) and the rate at which your group is being hurt.<P>2.  Rooting mobs away from the party is a good idea, but one of your mobs was a caster.  To root the caster you'd have to take him (and yourself) far away from the group to root him so that he can't cast on the group.  Most likely someone would have died while you were away.  However, if everyone had switched to killing the caster, you could have parked the warrior mob just out of melee range and taken one mob out of the fight temporarily.  This will buy you some time, but may or may not save you.  Keep in mind that at level 11 most players aren't skilled enough to switch mobs together.  This is a skill that develops later, so chance of this working in NRo is slight.<P>3. Stuns don't help much at your level.  You only have one, and it alone isn't effective to stop a mob.  You can use it to gain aggro though, and then root a mob where you want him.  You can also use it to interrupt spellcasting. <P>4.  Chosing who lives or dies.  This is a judgement call, and you normally have about half a second to make it.  It varies depending on where you're fighting too.  If a caster is oom, then they can't help -- sacrifice them before a tank.  An enchanter is usually the exception, but sometimes a tank can do more good for the party than a chanter especially if the chanter is oom.  Now in your situation it was a mage.  The only way that mage got aggro was by overnuking, so it's possible that healing them would only delay his death rather than prevent it, since the tank has to overcome all that aggro.  Meanwhile you'd dump all your mana into him and everyone dies.  In my opinion, you made the right call.<P>If you're here reading here at level 11 and grouping in game, you'll make an excellent cleric someday.  Keep learning, and keep asking questions.  I learn stuff here all the time.<P>-Fuz<BR>59 Templar, Sol Ro<P></FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#f7f7f7"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Dallimarr</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">I have a problem with your question...<P>WHY did a mage have a skeleton as a pet at level 11?

They should not be hit by it if they move the fight. I always have root up no matter what.  If you don't get to your chanter in time and they die, that mob is coming after you.<P>Med up...  Too many times I am low mana and instead of complete heals I am having to cast "fast heals" as the health is low or the zone freaking laggy (karnors).<P>/hugs<BR>Torriana<BR>Cleric<BR>Brell</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#f7f7f7"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Kair</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Hi there!  Let's keep in mind all the posters here, your root you have at level 11 does next to nothing as far as root/parking goes.  root only lasts about 3 seconds or so.  (or for sure it feels like only 3 seconds  <IMG SRC="http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/smile.gif"> )<P>I think once it started to becoming evident that things were going bad, fearing and running for the zone would be the best corse of action.  If you zone, you will clear the agro that the mobs have on you, so the mob gathering others isn't a problem then.<P>Remember to have the tanks concentrate on taking down casters first because they are gonna be easier with less hitpoints and those nukes can really hurt you.<P>Also, people get upset when they die, as a previvious poster stated...learn to shrug off the comments, they'll be happy to know you and be on your good side when you can rez them.  Even revive will be a blessing at 29.<P>Get in the habit of at least trying to root park though, but don't expect it to last long at your level.<P>Hope that helps a bit,<BR>Kair<BR>Bristlebane Server</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#dedfdf"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Twinskey Bab0linskey</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">The only thing I woulda done differntly is after casting DA, sit, un-mem somthing and mem gate.

You have to Gate before you get aggroed or you won't make it.<P>Honestly, if you were far enough away to not be aggroed I would have considered doing nothing and letting the other three die rather than trying to help while almost OOM.  Not very heroic, but think of it as practice for when you are high enough to res, and your groupmates will be grateful for a cleric who knows how to survive a bad pull  <IMG SRC="http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/smile.gif">. <P>People will always get angry when they die, and they look for someone to blame, and that is usually the cleric.  Don't believe those clerics who boast that no one dies in their groups.  If you take on challenges then people die sometimes.  I commend you for fighting dervs with that group, it is a good challenge and it will make you a better player.<P>Some people's motto is "Live and Learn".  In EQ I prefer "Die and Learn".  <IMG SRC="http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/smile.gif">  </FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#dedfdf"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Josiefuz</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial"> <BLOCKQUOTE><font size="1" face="Verdana, Arial">quote:</font><HR>Originally posted by Dallimarr:<BR><B>So, I guess nobody liked me pointing out that the "Mage" in the posters question was a necro huh?<P>Shame.<P></B><HR></BLOCKQUOTE><P>At level 11 there's precious little difference between a necro and a mage.

Judging by your post, this was the main cause of your problems.  Grouping is a learned skill.  It will take time, patience and communication to perfect it.<P>The warrior needs to priortize his targets.  When selecting or switching targets during a fight, he should announce it to the group.  A couple hotkeys would work well here (i.e. /gsay Attacking %T  and /gsay Switching target to %T.)<P>The enchanter also needs to announce to the group which mobs have been mezzed.  As the enchanter is also the one most likely to determine if a pull is unworkable, he also needs to set up a hotkey for when it is time to cut and run.<P>The magician/necromance needs to be sure that he is casting spells on the right mob.  Mez plus nuke/dot/pet do not mix.  A necromance should also be using a combination of darkness and fear on the mob that the warrior is fighting.  Really cuts down on the amount of healing needed.  A magician would want to have his air pet up whenever a casting NPC is involved (stuns are especially effective against casters).<P>You as a cleric need to communicate as well.  Keep the group informed of your mana status as you were.  Announce your heals.  I had hot keys with "/gsay Casting X Heal on [ %T ]" where X was the name of the heal.  Also inform the group of your healing priorities, i.e. Enchanter #1, Main Tank #2, everyone else #3.<P>Keep working on it.  There's nothing better than being in a fine tuned group in EQ.  It just takes time and practice.  And don't forget rule #1 - Have Fun!   <IMG SRC="http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/biggrin.gif"><P>Vidar Vonvidi<BR>Cleric (50) semi-retired<BR>Titans of Luclin</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#dedfdf"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Wastral Utterblight</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Soothe is crap, never use it. I have used it a few times when I was younger and it failed many more times than it worked, and when it fails theres usually a lot of death afterwards (not of the Dervs). If you cant pull the camp without soothe, or you have no other means of crowd control, then either go to a camp with less spawns (or with lower level spawns up, so you can break easier) or go kill roamers.<P>The tank potentially pulling 2+ mobs while the Cleric is at 2m isnt very intelligent either. How did you get down to 2m in the first place? Probably because your group is  pulling too much, too high of mobs and too fast. And not caring about your mana reports IE: Dumb group. If they're not your friends I would suggest finding some other group.<P>And lastly, why are those cowards running for the zone? You may have a chance to win with a full group but with half your party running away your odds are reduced drastically. You dont get to be a better player by running away every time something starts to attack you. And if theyre running with mobs hitting them out of range from your heals how can you heal them?<P>I think you did what you could. It would have been a better idea if everyone had either stayed and fought as a group or ran away as a group rather than the total chaos it was. When it comes down to picking who to let live and who to let die I think that you should always keep the Tank alive, because if the tank does you're all dead anyways. If youre getting ready to run then just try to keep everyone alive untill they can zone.</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#f7f7f7"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Aquinas</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">A few comments in no particular order:<P>1.  I don’t think you did anything wrong.  They knew you were low on mana and pulled anyway, so they shouldn’t complain if they couldn’t handle the pull.<P>2.  You did the right thing healing the warrior.  In that situation I consider a mage/necro a low-priority healing target.  Heals do the most good on a sturdy tank who won’t just lose the health again in a couple hits, or possibly on the enchanter if he’s keeping a bunch of mobs under control (though it sounds like there was just one mob left here).  It’s part of a caster’s job to avoid aggro, especially when the cleric is LOM.<P>3.  Having the enchanter pull is generally a bad idea.  You’d rather not let the chanter get hit at all, and having him pull just starts out on the wrong foot.  It may not matter too much at level 11, but it’s a bad habit to get into.<P>4.  Don’t sweat the incident.  I couldn’t even begin to count the number of half-assed groups and fights I was in from levels 1-20.  But it really doesn’t matter much, because at level 11 the death penalty is tiny compared to what you’ll see later.<BR></FONT></TD></TR></TABLE>
