<TEXTAREA NAME="EditedMessage" ROWS=10 COLS=45 WRAP="VIRTUAL">This morning I sent this email to Verant in the hopes that it would get to Rich.  I'll repost it here and ask for observations from the community.


Dear Mr. Waters,

	I'd like to submit my observations regarding your upcoming priest rebalancing.  I am a dedicated Everquest player with over 175 days played across two characters on seperate accounts.  I play in a NTOV/AOW-capable guild as a level 60 cleric on the Rathe Server.  My roommate plays a level 60 shaman and my live-in girlfriend plays a level 54 druid.  Given my experience and observations with all three priest classes, I feel that I can provide intelligent, if not completely unbiased feedback.

	I was heartened to see your comments on the castersrealm webpage regarding priest rebalancing, though I admit that I have some trepidation from the perspective of a cleric.  It is the impression of many clerics that we are often considered to be the benchmark priest class that the other classes are 'balanced up' to.  Druids in particular often complain about their lack of function in raid environments, and will cite the fact that raids are 'dependant' upon clerics as an argument for their own rebalancing.

	You have the information and observations of thousands of players, so I won't bore you with a tedious list or series of class comparisons.  Instead I wish to submit one simple analogy that I hope you will consider.  

	Druids argue that they are not useful on raids and are therefore restricted from an important aspect of the game.  That same argument can be turned around and used from the cleric perspective.  Nobody ever cancelled a raid for lack of druids, but when was the last time you saw a cleric quad-kiting in the Cobalt Scar?  Druids are not the only class that has been restricted from an important aspect of the game.  I hope that in your rebalancing of the priest classes, you can make just as serious an inroad toward allowing Clerics 'out of the box' as you will with allowing druids more versatility in healing.  Let us solo.  Let us be efficient in small groups again.


	That's really all I want to say, and I thank you for taking the time to read this.  The only thing I could add is that I've lived with all three classes on raids, and frankly I -know- that druids and shamans are effective for most healing in raid groups.  It is my impression that the very versatility of these classes is what hurts them in the healing category.  As a cleric, I heal because I have no options otherwise.  All of my attention and resources are devoted to healing.  As a druid or shaman, I have other options, and it's only when a druid or shaman doesn't devote themselves 100% to healing that they are ineffective on a raid.  Much of the healing on a raid does -not- involve casting Complete Heal on a tank, and giving druids more healing versaitility will not improve their position on a raid unless the players take on the 'healer' mindset.  It is my observation that most druids consider raid-healing to be a degrading role.

	Thank you for your time and consideration.  I would welcome any questions or dialogue from you.  I may be reached via email at <Deleted>.

Sincerely,

Steve Dikerson
