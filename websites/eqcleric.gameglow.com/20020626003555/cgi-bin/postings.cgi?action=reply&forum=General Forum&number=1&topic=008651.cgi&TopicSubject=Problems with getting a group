I'd thought I'd make a topic like this to give some tips on how to get them better.<BR>1. Talk to your guild leadership: The leadership should know of the troubles that your having getting groups. Tell them that Clerics need exp too and that your having trouble getting it. If your in a guild that loot is given at leaderships dicrestion then have them note that people who help clerics will be looked on with good favor when loot comes around.<P>2. Make friends. Make friends with melee, esp. melee who solo in FG, heres a tip, soloing is B O R I N G, so try to find and make some melee friends, and dou with them. It'll be boring for you, but exp is exp so get your nukes out and bring topics of converstation.<P>3. AE groups, make them! Rallos Zek has a channel called aejunkies, just for finding AE groups, make one like this on your server.<P>4. chardok/ssra form groups to exp in this zone. CT is some of the greatest exp in the game.<P>Douing in FG is just as good exp as AE, and CT is better. Do I have numbers no, but this is my experiance.<P>I'm so in love with my guild cause I ralry have troubles finding groups, and their so awesome about it cause I know I'm slowing their exp down, but they don't complain  <IMG SRC="http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/smile.gif"> < HUG ><P>Anyone else have any tips? hopefully this will help some.<P>Cland Carbuncle<BR>Lvl 60 High Priest, Rallos Zek<BR>-Wudan-<BR></FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#f7f7f7"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Hogi</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Getting groups seems to depend just as much on personality / rep as on class. I do know shadow knights who never find groups / warriors who never find groups, but aswell people of the same classes who have no problem at all to find groups. And both are from my guild, having about the same equippement.<BR>I myself am _never_ invited to any regular exp group, but alot to AoE groups, simply because that's where my reputation is ( AoE > anything for exp anyway.. ).<BR>'I can't find a group cuz I'm a cleric' is just a weak excuse imho. <BR>Socialize and have fun.. and you shouldn't have problems to get into groups.<P>Hogi<BR></FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#dedfdf"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Balator2</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Forgive my ignorance, I've been away for a while.

What exactly are guild leaders going to do about this? You can't raid without clerics and when half the clerics quit out of frustration you don't have any option but to accept twink clerics or else you don't raid. Period.<P>Of course, the more twink clerics show up and get loot, the more primary clerics leave and thus you need even more twink clerics to fill the gap. In all honesty, I am beginning to doubt that clerics are a viable primary class post 50 and Verant handing out free accounts to facilitate the creation of new twink clerics isn't helping that.<P>Nice Catch 22...<P>2. Most of the tanks I used to group with now 2-box a cleric. Those that don't often group with a tank who has a 2-boxed cleric. What's left is maybe 1-2 groups if I'm lucky and when you have 2 groups and 6 primary clerics LFG... well, you see the problem.<P>3. I expect Verant will nerf the few remaining AE-able camps since AE groups tend to be the source of much conflict. I was in a knock down, drag out fight with an AE group in FG a few months ago because this AE group felt we had enough other camps to go play in that we should leave the southern half of FG to them.  No, I am not kidding. They were claiming half a zone. Most notably the easier half where the most mushrooms could be found.<P>Haven't been in an AE group since. Besides which, it's not like AE groups grow on trees. Finding 3 wizards, a chanter and a puller with sufficient HP willing to do this isn't easy.<P>4. See #2. Same exact problem. Hard to exp anywhere without a group. And trying anything in CT without a 60 chanter is suicide.<P>After the next patch I'll most likely be spending my time probably using my fixed Hammer of the Sun to solo in The Grey.<P>------------------<BR>Boanerges Thundercry<BR>High Priest of Prexus<BR><A HREF="http://www.cohort.cc" TARGET=_blank>Cohort Chalybeius</A><BR>Cazic Thule Server</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#f7f7f7"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Zzule</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Hey Cland, I have aejunkies on autojoin.  <IMG SRC="http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/wink.gif"><BR>So far my favorite ae group is: <P>3 enc<BR>2 wiz<BR>1 clr<P>Consider the 3rd chanter insurance.

Sebilis is a cash cow, and clerics know it. So at any given time, there are no less than 5 clerics LFG in Sebilis. Sometimes as many as 20.<P>Velk's Lab has the other problem, Soloing Melee classes. At any given time, there are 5-8 Monks, 3-4 Warriors and even a couple Paladins and Shadow Knights SOLOING in Velk's Lab. About the only GROUPS in Velk's anymore are Upper and Lower dogs and Upper Spiders (Frenzy, whatever your server calls it). If you aren't in one of those 3 groups, good luck finding something to kill.<P>Now, as for other EXP zones...<P>Chardock is mostly light blue at 60, so you gotta go towards the Royal's area to get good exp. And Chardock is usually full of soloing shamans and AoE groups.<P>Fungus Grove is not a good place to go either, if there ARE any clerics there, they are 2-boxed. A group would rether have a shaman or druids here than a cleric.<P>Maiden's Eye has it's own issues. Most notably, it's BORING. <P>I haven't yet gone to the revamped Cazic Thule, but from what I hear, my server's top 5-6 guilds monopolize that zone and getting a group in CT is impossible if you aren't in one of those guilds.<P>My advice, is do what I do. Get together a group of guildmates or friends, and go to Umbral Plains or Ssra Temple. UP is usually a good choice since there is never more than 2 groups there, and there are ALOT of MOBs. Either Ganthru's pull to the zone in, or go to that "safe" valley past the castle and pull Elysian Remains. EXP simply flows there.</FONT></TD></TR></TABLE>
