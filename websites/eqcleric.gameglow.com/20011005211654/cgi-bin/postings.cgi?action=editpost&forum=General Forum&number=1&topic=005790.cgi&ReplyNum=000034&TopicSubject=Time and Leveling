<TEXTAREA NAME="EditedMessage" ROWS=10 COLS=45 WRAP="VIRTUAL">Last I checked, I think I had over 40 days on Sonard at level 52. Created March 6, 2000. (Sad to think how much time I spent in this game).  If my memory is right, I think I hit 30 with about 20 days played.  I made a monk, got him to 23 in 5 days, and still did all my shackle quests, and did it totally solo (now working on fixing faction, so exp really slowing down, /rude HK guards).

Reason's my monk is leveling so much faster:
Think back to your first 10 levels playing your first charactor.  You didn't know much, got lost all the time, spent a lot of time looking for that corpse when you got jumped in a new zone, endless hours hailing NPC's trying to figure out what the quest was, and who gave out quests, waiting for boats, looking for that elusive merchant that sold an item you needed (I think I spent a whole 4 hours hungry and thirsty trying to find out where to buy food in Kelethin when I got level 4 and did not get newbie food when I died), hours apon hours running around exploring new zones, sitting at a zone line looking for a group, working on trade skills, ect ect ect.  Take all this out (never did any of this with monk) and you cut down ALOT of time.  Don't have to be powerleveled to level quickly.  You just know the game, where to hunt, and how to play effectively (what you can kill for fast exp).  Other factors include little things like I am sure when you make an alt, you have a lot more idea of what stats to put points in (was totally clueless when I made Sonard), you know what equipment to put on (and can afford it), and know where to find info about your class to make the most of your playing time (learning curve a lot less).

BTW, I did not 'uber twink' my monk.  I did get a pair of fighting batons from a guild member as a trade for an advisor robe, and got him 2 peices of cresent armor from Dalnir's when he was 14, and gave him +str jewelry and an exe hood (total value of equip at level 23: 1.8k approx.  If it was my first char, I am sure I could have gotten him same equip alone except for cresent for another 7 levels).

Other bonuses that make alt's level faster is you never need a pickup group (twinks tend to hunt with twinks of friends), and you will probably never need to take a boat, as by this time you probably know enough druids/wizards that you can get a port for your twink when you need it.  You also tend not to spend time on trade skills on alts.

Respective twinks will take less and less time as far as I have seen.  And if you are making a twink because you are level 60 and your guild needs a certain key class,  you can level this char at a phenominal rate.

I personally know of a level 60 necro in a large guild on my server who made a chanter.  At level 4 he was constantly begged for clarity since he had the equipment better than most level 50 chanters.  He also had a pet druid/chanter to Powerlevel him all the way to 60.  I think he did got level 50 in something like 10 days played, but it was a while ago so I can't remember exactly what it was, but that is pretty close.  I know it was insane.

Tactic to PL lowbies insanely fast:  Go to newbie dungeon like runneye that is pretty much deserted, Rune and 8 pt DS and run around and agro reds till you get 10 beating on ya and sit back and rake in exp.  Go to next dungeon and repeat till they start to yellow out on ya.  Of course you have to stop every few levels and get skills back up so you don't hit level 50 with alteration at 10 since you never cast many spells.  But skills like offence, defence, block ect go up if you are hitting mobs while being attacked.  Especially defence.

So, while it's not impossible to get to high levels extremely fast, you wouldn't do it with your main char. Even if I was into powerleveling, I would never powerlevel a genuine n00b like that since he would be for all intents and purposes, an Ebay char.  But if you got a char or 2 to level 50, and am not taking away mobs from real newbies (IE, fighting in deserted places), I don't see the harm.
