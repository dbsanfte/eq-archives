I can't stress it enough  :) you'll never level if you join a guild and raid. Trust me. I'm in an "uber" guild now and we raid a TON. It's great fun, but you hardly ever have time to advance... though we do have exp groups from time to time  :)

You won't advance as quickly as you would like, but, if you remain guildless, you could EASILY get through the 50+ levels. They aren't as hard as people make them out to be... I could get from 56 to 60 in a month if I were guildless... hands down.[/B][/QUOTE]

But shortly after we join, most of our 50+ leave to join others.  but we decide to hang on because we had lot of people at lvl 25-40.  so time goes on and me and me friends come to planar lvl(46+) but most of the others are still in their thirties  <IMG SRC="http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/frown.gif"><BR>hmm.<BR>Me friends and I are all friends in real live and meet regulary at lunch, parties and such.<BR>and I cant say that we are casual players in that sense, since we play alot  <IMG SRC="http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/smile.gif"><P>ok, after waiting for the other people in the guild to lvl up, we give up. 2 friends of mine join another guild with only lvl 50+ people.  they go on lot of raids and me is with them most of time also.  But other people in me guild seem to leave after goin up to lvl 46, since they have problems gettin on raids and stuff.  Also me has been workin on Thurgadin and COV faction at the same time and most of me guild isnt even thinkin about it, just hunt there and here.  and since me is the cleric which is most online me got drowned in rez/buff/pl tells from me guildies when me got online.  well me had enough and left.<P>Since leavin me has gotten several invites from other guilds, but my dilema is this;<BR>all of them are on Kael faction and me has no interest in ruin me dorf faction(me is ally) and me dragon faction(still dubious though)<BR>but those invites are all from people me has hunted with(planar raids, kunark raids and general xp huntin) and know me ability as a cleric.<BR>me friends have no trouble with being in seperate guilds, because we are always together huntin, helpin with quests and other stuff.  but of course few of them are on Kael faction so that has complicated things for Velious huntin.<P>atm me is concentrating on gettin me arse up to lvl 55+ and me is not hurryin to join another guild.<P>one of the guilds me was invited to is very powerful and has lots of 55+ people, but the others are small but capable of doin guild only raids.<P>so what shall me do? wait for dragon friendly guild to invite me? join one of the other guilds regardless of faction? or just go freelance  <IMG SRC="http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/smile.gif"><P>any opinion would be really apreciated.<P>------------------<BR>Corynthia-Dominion of Unity<BR>53rd Level Dwarven Vicar<BR>Bristlebane</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#f7f7f7"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Georgia Gaelicmyst</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><b>STAY GUILDLESS</b><P>I can't stress it enough  <IMG SRC="http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/smile.gif"> you'll never level if you join a guild and raid.

I am sure any guild would be happy to snatch ye up into their ranks.<P>I would highly recommend checking many guilds before ye commit yourself to one.  Tis sort of an ongoing interview mayhap.  Ye should romp with them for experience and loot and even attend a few large hunts and perchance a dull camp with guildmembers ye are checking out.  Do nae be afraid to ask questions.  Get the answers ye want.  Get the home ye deserve.<P>To me a guild is much more then a group of people that go kill Ubermob01.  But more like a large extended family, complete with those annoying younger siblings, black sheeps and generous grand parents.  For me, I must feel comfortable, respected, equal and appriciated.  Twould nae stay in a family that treated me otherwise (continually).  <P>Also, tis all about your values.  Make sure the guilds ye look at are up to par with ye ideals an morals.  Twould be nothing more embarassing then to join a guild then hear them /shout rude or degrading things.<P>As to faction, if ye are dead set on keeping the dragons on your good list then make sure ye find people that support your decision!<P>Good luck to ye!

A good guild is a great thing, a poor guild is a pain in the butt.<P>Don't join a raiding guild (one that focuses primarily on large scale raids) until you are happy with your current level, because you will stay that level for a long, long time.<P>Best bet is to tag along on other guilds raids to get a feel for how you like raiding and how you like the people in the guild. When the time is right to join one, the choice should be obvious.<P>On Velious factions, people are far more important than faction.

Kael gives the overall best armor, and most everyone defaults to that.<P>However, I know quite a few guilds do both.  Their melees go with Kael, but the casters keep their dragon faction up for the stat armor.  It's a lot of work and killing greens, but you can certainly kill anything for a day and repair you faction in another day or two.</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#f7f7f7"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Walbort</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Corynthia-<P>Give me a tell sometime and let's talk. The guild I am in sounds very similar to yours, and we are allied with several other guilds on BB to get the numbers needed to conduct higher level raids. There may be a way for you to keep your small guild of friends and realize many of the advantages of large guild membership as well.<P>If you look at larger guilds to join, you should take a long look at the guild Arturo is in, Succoring Winds. Lots of great dragon-allied people and they have always been known as an honorable bunch.
