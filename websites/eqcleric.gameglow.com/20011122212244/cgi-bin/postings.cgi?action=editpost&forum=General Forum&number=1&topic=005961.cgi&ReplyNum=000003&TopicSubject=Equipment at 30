<TEXTAREA NAME="EditedMessage" ROWS=10 COLS=45 WRAP="VIRTUAL">I'm not an old school cleric but I am an old school player.  Your gear is a lot better than what most of us had when we first started out, but you do have room for improvement.  Depending on what server you play on and the condition of it's economy, upgrades could be rather easy.  You didn't say what you were wearing for your neck and face, but if they're on par with the rest of your gear there are several affordable items at your level.

Head is fine: there's not alot of great wisdom items for the head that also yield a nice ac, best piece to my knowledge is a sebilite scale helm, which is out of your reach for right now.

Arms: These are good as well, but I would start looking at the vambraces of the fervant quest.  They give some decent stat bonuses and have a little better ac.  Shouldn't be too hard to get them with a little help from friends.

Wrist2: While the 10 extra mana is nice, it is only equivelent to 1 wisdom for you.  The cleric quest bracers are really nice, but hard to get, I opted for runed mithril bracers myself.  A lot easier to get and they give me + str, which I sorely need as a dark elf.  These aren't cheap always though and I wouldn't recommend rushing out to buy a pair unless you have 2k plat to spare.

Hands: These are fine for now.  The next upgrade for your hands should be Gauntlets of the black.  Can usually get a pair of these for about 1.5k, depending on the server.

Chest: Not a bad bp, upgrades would be a fs bp, chestplate of the constant.  If you really wouldn't mind losing a few ac from the cg bp I'd say get a bloodstained tunic for the extra wis.

Legs: Not a bad choice.  Logical upgrade would be greaves of the pentinent, slightly better ac with some stat bonuses.  You can wear gator scale leggings, but the ac on them isn't very good IMO.

Feet: Good boots for you, still wear mine.  I refuse to wear gebs as a cleric, I want ac.

Offhand: Charred guardian shield.  I forget if the testament can go in primary hand, but if it can I'd put it there and get a cgs.  Extra ac plus 9 more wis.

Jewelry: Your jewelry isn't bad, but as before, depending on your cash reserves there are much better available.  Plat jasper rings and golden jasper earrings.  Not sure on price of these but I'm sure several high level players would have this stuff laying around when they upgraded to velium jewelry.

Face: Plat ruby veil.  It's not cheap, but if you lack in str as well as wis then it's perfect and well worth the cost.

Neck: Blackened iron medallion is pretty nice at your level.  If you are a dark elf cleric then I highly recommend doing the regent symbol of Innoruuk quest in neriak.  The reward for this quest is great IMO.  If you're not a de, then if you can spare the plat get a chrysoberyl talisman.  Most likely though the blackend iron medallion will be much cheaper.

Shoulders: Adamantite epolets.  These are a common drop off the ghoul cavalier in lower guk.  You can usually find these for sale rather cheap almost anywhere.  

Back: Again, depending on race, you could get a kunzar cloak.  Not alot of ac on it, but it does give wisdom.  Molten cloak, Mammoth hide cloak, or Aegis of life.  Molten cloak would be a difficult camp, but you can get a cgs at the same time.  Mammoth hide cloak would be a tough camp as well but can be done with a good group.  Aegis is incredibly difficult to get and you would need alot of help and alot of stamina for the camp.  If you can get the help and have the patience to do it, then the aegis of life is by far the best back piece you'll find for a long long time.


Some stuff I listed is stuff you can get at your level and some stuff is for future reference.  To get a good idea of what people your level and class are wearing you might want to check out the player profiles on castersrealm.  I'm no expert on clerics and gear, but just by looking there and talking to clerics in game I learned enough to get started.  Some say focus on wis while others say focus on ac.  Almost every high level cleric I've talked to has said focus on ac though to give you an idea.

Hope that helps ya some.
