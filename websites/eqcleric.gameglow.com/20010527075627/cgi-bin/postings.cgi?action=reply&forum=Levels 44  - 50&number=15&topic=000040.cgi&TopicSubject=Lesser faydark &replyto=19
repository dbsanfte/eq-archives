She hits pretty hard, and can interrupt your spells easily.<P>When going into the first fight I always buff with MR, FR, symbol, reso and AoF.  She casts both fire spells and magic spells.

I can break the camp easy without the symbol though using only 3 spells nuke, stun, fear.  I kept count and it takes 80 kills to get through lv 44 and 190 kills to get through lv 45 as i have counted the number of kills per bub.  That is ~20 hours to get through lv 45 killing her and ~9 hours for lv 44.  If you dont rez ppl and sit with your anon on you should not have to worry about people in lfay bothering you.  i do help lower lv people killing cog though while i am there.  I find the camp enjoyable because this is the first time i have soloed since lv 8.   Plus i can do other things while i time the spawn at 6mins.

The pet will come at you.  Cast fear on the pet to make it run off.  Happ will most likely throw a nuke of some kind and then run up to do her dual 70s on you (pretty good punching for a mage).  Root her, back up, then throw a nuke to drop her.  The pet will suicide when fear wears off.  (Feared pets always suicide when fear wears off if their master is dead.)<P>From then on just pay attention and nuke Happ before she gets her pet up.
