[B]First thing I would do would have been to make sure that the monk was FD'd, and had /q out to clear all aggro, BEFORE I log back in. The first person I rez is a bard (who usually tries to camp as well), then enchanter, at least one more cleric/secondary healer, then damage dealers, then the rest :)  My very first time in Hate, we had a total wipe out, and I was the only cleric that managed to camp..talk about nervous!!

Who do I rez first?</B><HR></BLOCKQUOTE><P>I would recommend depending on where you were (i.e. if you were in a area where agro was a good possibility I would rez a cleric and then have them camp out).  If you had just cleared the area and are confident (as well with the monk) that there would be no agro, I would rez the following in order:<P>1 - Bard<BR>2 - Enchanter<BR>3 - Warrior<BR>4 - Necro<BR>5 - Clerics<BR>6 - Other Tanks<BR>7 - Rest<P>Reason is the bard can play mana song obviously, as well as mez without mana use, so he doesnt get hurt by rez effects.  Enchanter can make sure you do not lose clarity (Rez a 54+ chanter first).  They can also Mez if something starts to happen, giving you enough time to camp out again if needed.  Warrior will give you initial tank support, and the necro can regen mana fast and feed it to you.  If no necros, a mage works well for mod rods, but they will need to med for them, obviously.  At this point other clerics should be ressed up to start medding and assist you.<P>Had you ressed a tank first, you would not have had the mana to heal him it sounds like, nor would be have the right HP to be able to be healed enough to be able to tank the lich.  Had you ressed a bard first, he would have been able to keep that lich mezzed long enough for you to med up and rez others, at the same time playing mana song for you.<P>Just my opinions though   <IMG SRC="http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/smile.gif"><P><B>EDIT: If there was another cleric on the raid with a rez stick, I would certainly rez him first - that supercedes everyone else -- forgot to mention that.</B><P>Aladain<p>[This message has been edited by Aladain (edited 12-11-2001).]</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#dedfdf"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Zardnok</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Depending on whether or not it was a total wipe out, assuming it was, I would have ressed in the highest level enchanter first.  This way you can get a clarity buff to help with your mana regen and someone to mez any adds long enough for you to get camped out.<P>Since you had a monk up top already, you really didn't need the "tank".  The monk should be capable of gaining aggro from the bad guy and leading him far enough away before he FD to give you the required 30 seconds to camp.<P>After the enchanter was ressed, I would try to res another cleric and then find a bard for mana song.  If there aren't any bards available, go for necro or mage next, anyone that can feed mana to the cleric.<P>Some folks like to camp out the second cleric immediately upon his arrival in Hate just in case there is another wipe situation.  I have been in situations that I wished I had camped a cleric out immediately after he was ressed, and I have been in situations I was glad I had the help with resses.  This is more of a preference and should be gauged by how well the raid is proceeding.  If worse comes to worse, remember a paladin is your best friend.  They can revive, heal, tank, and Lay Hands.  Many a raid has been saved by a paladin reviving me back into hate.<P>Good luck,<P>Zardnok Anansi<BR>56th Templar of Tunare<BR>Officer of Evening Reign<BR>Druzzil Ro</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#f7f7f7"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">ShelseaDruid</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">It was a total wipeout.

They can help wiht your mana, while keeping you invis as well. If no bard available, then a enchanter is next best. Once you have a bard (or enchanter), the next 2 should be clerics, followed by and enchanter (unless you already have one). <P>Also, I agree that if you have an epic cleric, they should be first.
