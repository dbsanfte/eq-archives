The best way I've found to manage an overzealous nuker is to not heal them after fights. If battle begins and they are at 75% they exercise a little more restraint. If it gets them killed it was a lesson they needed to learn.

This angers me as it uses up my mana on him, when it belongs to the tank....bottom line, if it comes down to it, the tank is what will keep the group alive, not the wizard so I have stopped healing him when he throws out those nukes and gets aggroed. I simply tell him to wait until the end of the fight to nuke, but he refuses. Personally, I would rather he just sticks on root duty to let myself and the chanter meditate as much as possible, and let the tank do and take all the damage.<P>Does this not make sense? I mean, I'm only lvl 26, but I've played the game since its beeen out just about and I don't think I'm being unreasonable here.</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#f7f7f7"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Jubal</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Sounds perfectly reasonable. If he's got a death wish let him learn his lesson.

Instead of trying to come at it from the mana stand point.<BR>Try coming at it from the stand point that if he over nukes and agros the mob on him the tank has a harder time doing his job. <BR>If an int caster agros the mob the warrior has to turn and adjust to keep on the mob this takes time away from the tank doing what he is suppose to be doing. Also if the int caster happens to be one that runs around when he does this the tank has an even harder time cause the mob is constantly moving out of range. As for not healing the wizard while it might feel good to do this I would not neccesarly let him die but let him get real low and use your lower heals. <BR><P>------------------<BR>Trilvan Lostheart<BR>46th Cleric of Love Peace and Happiness</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#f7f7f7"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Tarf</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">I had a series of discussions with a very good friend of mine on this very issue.<P>Ultimately, in Droga, I told him that he could do whatever he wanted.

I then told him the order I was healing in:<P>Chanter<BR>Tank<BR>Self<BR>Druid/evaccer<BR>anyone else that was there<BR>Wizard/overaggroingnuker<P>He stopped that day.  He manages aggro wonderfully now.  It is very difficult when it is a good friend.  You might also try not buffing the wiz.  Those int casters get their hp doubled or more by our buffs.  Makes em feel like they can tank.<P>Good luck, you are being reasonable, doesn't mean he will agree with you.<P>Tarf</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#dedfdf"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Kannayyan</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">thanks, all good responses that I expected pretty much...He is a friend and plays the game well, but is new to the wiz class and I think a little over zealous with his nukes...mainly he just gets bored I think because our monk and tank do so much damage. I've always known the wizard to finish up the fight by dropping a big DD, which can be hard to guestimate the HP of the mob and which nuke to use...</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#f7f7f7"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Kovina</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">The most wonderful Wizards I've played with are those that drop their DD at the point that will cause the mob to turn and run. No aggro is generated and it save party damage in that last bit of the battle where mobs tend to start getting bonuses to their 'to hit' and 'to damage'.<P>However, if regulated to only dropping nukes at that time I can see how this might get boring. Guess the big thing is that they nuke in suce a way as to not get aggro, how that is accomplished is up to them.  <IMG SRC="http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/smile.gif"><P>Kovina Bloodfang<BR>54 Cleric</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#dedfdf"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">KamuelaTZ</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">In an ideal world all my mana would belong to the warrior.
