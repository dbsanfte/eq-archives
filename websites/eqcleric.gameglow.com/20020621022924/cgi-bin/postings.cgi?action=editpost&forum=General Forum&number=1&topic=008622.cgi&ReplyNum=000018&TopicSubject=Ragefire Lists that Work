<TEXTAREA NAME="EditedMessage" ROWS=10 COLS=45 WRAP="VIRTUAL">Greetings! I run the most successful Ragefire list in the history of Everquest.
 [URL=http://pub106.ezboard.com/fluclin71335dragonsandtheplanes.showMessageRange?topicID=791.topic&start=1&stop=20]http://pub106.ezboard.com/fluclin71335dragonsandtheplanes.showMess      ageRange?topicID=791.topic&start=1&stop=20[/URL] 

After 14 solid months, I suppose you could say our list works for us. Your luck with it could vary. I'm pretty sure a Luclin-style list may not be accepted in most server communities. Our list is universally-accepted, and has gotten to the point where practically everyone in the entire server 50+ level knows about the list. Guild politics mostly gets set aside for Rage, there are countless stories in Luclin where many bored members of "uber-guilds" come together to assist a small-guild cleric who happened to be at the top, with open Ragefire raids swelling to rediculous numbers, represented at times by 5 or 6 guilds. (Of course when an uber-guild cleric reaches the top, their raids tend to be small, quick, efficient, and in-house)

Anyway, over the last year or so, I've come up with several opinions on Rage lists, and what makes ours work. Take these however you will. ; )

1) Start Simple

Complexity kills. Rage lists that start out being super-complex books tend to die, as guilds who originally were open to the list are slow to understand how the blasted thing works, and finally gives it up. The Luclin list has grown complex with rules now, but we are very familiar with our complexities. We started with extremely simple rules and adapted over time as needed.

2) Start Early

For some older servers a Rage list is simply not a realistic option at all. Few things in the game are a flashpoint for guild hatred as much as Rage races and KS'ing. Once your server has had a long, long taste of FFA, you are already starting at a huge disadvantage, essentially having to convince many, many parties to bury the hatchet. This would probably be most applicable to the Bayles.

3) Get UNIVERSAL Consent

This is, by far, the most important thing. By universal, I am mostly speaking of each and every "uber-guild" signing on to it, without too many little bitty guilds opposed. Whatever it takes to get universal consent, you may have to be pragmatic. If one powerful guild tells you all to buzz off, that they will never respect the list, you may as well give it up and save everyone the heartache of losing what they had "earned" through the list.

4) The first order must be fair

The Rage list graveyard is littered with the corpses of lists that began with a single guild starting the list for the rest of the server, of course loading it with their own clerics. Whatever you need to do to figure out a first order that everyone agrees to, before additions are begun, is fine, but many list attempts tend to die due to a perceived unfairness on how it was originally set up. On Luclin, when the list began a long, long, long time ago, the quest was still new, and only a few people, which everyone knew each other, were doing the quest. So those 6 or 7 people set the order based on who had been camping Rage in solb the longest.

5) Communication, communication, communication.

If your server has a huge one-stop community that is widely used, as the Luclin server is fortunate to have with [URL=http://www.eqluclin.com]www.eqluclin.com[/URL]  and their boards, then you have an advantage. Rage lists dont tend to live very well at all, when they are based on a guild's web site, or recorded only on a scrap of paper on some person's computer desk. Being easy to reach, and a central site would be helpful.

6) Committees Suck

Of all the Rage lists that fail almost right away vs those that live at least a little while before finally dying out, often a difference is at the top. If you are trying to have some council head this up, or worse yet, have the cleric on top "in charge" of the list he is participating in, passing the duty down to the next cleric, then new clerics that come by wondering what the list is for the first time, often will not see it as "real". "Who do I talk to to get on this 'list'." "Errm, I dunno, it changes... or, there's this group that decides things among themselves." This will have problems. A Rage list needs to be headed by one person with a Kindergarten-teacher's patience, a reputation for fairness, being willing to rule against their own guild if need be for issues, and preferrably already having the epic or not participating in the list themself if possible.

7) Keep the floodgates shut tight

Luclin very, very quickly adopted a requirement that you absolutely must have the whole quest done up to Rage once our list began. If I one day on a whim decided to announce that I would list any cleric who wants on above level 50, our large-yet-still-doable list would swell grotesquely, untill it became so large that new clerics would no longer be willing to wait on a 1-year+ list.

8) Individual based vs Guild based

These are the two basic approaches. Luclin's list is individual-based. Nearly every other list out there is guild-based.

An individual-based list is more difficult to start, because guilds, used to the idea of proposing guild rotations for critters, will be pushing for a guild rotation, before they would sign off on it. However, in the long run, I believe an individual-based list is more fair, and has a better chance to survive over time.

A guild-based list is much easier to start, and get universal acceptance... for a time. Guild-based lists suffer from a fatal flaw. They are not fair to the uber-guilds. The quickest way to destroy ANY agreement in this game is to make the uber-guilds mad. Just because an uber-guild happens to be larger than most, their #4 cleric has to wait a LOT longer than  their fellow clerics in small guilds. This also has encouraged "guild-hopping" in the past, with a cleric joining a small guild, convincing them to assign that cleric the role of being that guild's Ragefire rep, getting their epic, then leaving for the large guild they wanted to join all along.

These are just my opinions, of course I could be wrong. ; )
