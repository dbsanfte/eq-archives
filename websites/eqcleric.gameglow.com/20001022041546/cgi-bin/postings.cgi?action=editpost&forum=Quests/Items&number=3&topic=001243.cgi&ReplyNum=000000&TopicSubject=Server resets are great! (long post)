You were probably all aware of the casting bug on Monday night, so the servers had to be reset....  Well......--

I was currently in West Commonlsnads just having fun running around since my spells didn't work, and right after Poeaga (Xegony lead-GM) broadcasted that the servers would be coming down, I FREAKING RAN LIKE HELL Kithicor Forest.

I was walking around Kithicor and I couldn't see any Cleric peices   :( - So, I camped my arse down at the burned down cabin, and waited for the servers to go down.

Since Tuesday morning (yes, morning.  I work graveyards) was my day off at work, I decided I'd stick around until the servers got back up.  I think I was the first one on the server, because when I did a /who all count - It said only 1 person was on the server.  (Me!   :D)

I grabbed the diary, and then immediately ran to -90, 3300.  What really made me run as fast as I could, is that I did a /who in the zone, and 3 other Clerics were in there...  (All great minds think alike).

I got to the stump, and someone was there!  It was a Halfling Cleric, trying to jump off the fallen stump.  Me, being a Dark Elf (medium, small size), I ran right up that tree, jumped, and grabbed the ingot of the reliant, and activated my gate spell.

As soon as I got back to Rathe Mountains, (where I was bound), I got several tells from that halfling saying that I was stealing his item!  Told him, sorry.  (Nothing he could do about it anyway.  Shouldn't have chosen to play a Halfling :P)

Went to Turgen, and got me an Icon of the Reliant!  Wooohoo!

Then on Tuesday, my friend Benelorn was online, and I was at the temple of life with my mule and working on PoL faction.  I was sending tells to Benelorn about Regis (since I did a /who and he was in North Karana).

Benelorn then said, "Regis is up."   - I was excited, I said, "How long can I wait?  I'm almost done!" - Benelorn then sent me a tell 5 minutes later, "Uh oh.  Regis had a Clerical accident!" - I was confused, really.  Then he explained it to me...  He would trade me a bracer of the reverant for 2 enchanted platinum bars, and I took the deal.

He killed Regis and got the ingot and got the flute from him.  Took it to Rathe and git the icon of the reverent.  - he had all the quest peices, but he already had two bracers, so, he helped me get a bracer   :)

(Benelorn, you're the awesomest guy.  I hope you read these boards)

Benelorn, myself, and a Druid friend named Maykail (I think), teleported to Lavastorm and went to Solusek Ro.

I got (1) Bracer of the Reverent, and (1) Boots of the Reliant!  I AM SO SO happy with my new Cleric peices!

(I had banded boots and a PBB previously)

*********

Wednesday I decided to go into Upper Guk and camp the item at the scryer spawn (Thanks Lianna).  I waited ~3 hours until it popped.

Grabbed it, and I went to proceed to kill heart spiders, for lots and lots of spider silk.  (Tailoring)

MY LONG LOST FRIEND Vandin was there!  He's a 46 Necromancer and was just wandering around Guk.  I asked him what he was doing, and he said, "Nothing.  I'm bored."

You say, 'hmmmmm.'
Jaldarith grins evilly.
You say, 'In that case...!"

He reacted immediately and asked what I had planned.  I asked if he would like to accompany me to Kerra Ridge and kill Maugrim.

His guildmate Milo (Thanks to Milo too), then proceeded to teleport us to Tox forest.  It took Vandin and myself about 35 minutes to find the Kerra Ridge zone...  We thought we were zoning into Erudin, but then I whipped out my trusty woven EQ map, and looked at the directions.

We entered Kerra Ridge, and the zone was deserted. (I'm assuming it always is).

Took us ~2 hours to clear EVERYTHING that was in our way, and get to Mitty and Maugrim. -- We killed Maugrim 2 times (Vandin has a Cleric(She's a 30 minute spawn)), and killed Mitty once.  Too bad Mitty didn't drop the ring for the paw quest.  I wouldn't have minded to get one of those later on in EQ life   :)

Anyway---  We got into some trouble while killing Mitty, and had to gate out as soon as we could.  I gated to North Freeport (where I bound myself that early morning), and I had 30 HPs left.

THANKS TO VANDIN!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

I now have Leggings of the Penitent! (sp?)
