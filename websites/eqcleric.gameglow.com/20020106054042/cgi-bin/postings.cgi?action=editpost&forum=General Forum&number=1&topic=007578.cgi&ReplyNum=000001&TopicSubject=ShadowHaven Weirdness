Quest Name: Trade Registration
Quest Giver: Trade Commissioner Henry
Quest Zone: Shadowhaven
Quest Level: Unknown

Quest Information / Dialogue:

[Tue Dec 04 18:24:34 2001] You say, 'Hail, Trade Commissioner Henry'

[Tue Dec 04 18:24:34 2001] Trade Commissioner Henry says 'Hello there, traveler. I don't believe that I have seen you around these parts before- then again, I could have and simply forgotten since there have been so many new faces around here. However, if you are a newcomer to Shadowhaven, please make sure that you [register for trading] in the Haven. Registering with the Traders of the Haven will legitimize you in the eyes of local merchants and customers. 

[Tue Dec 04 18:24:42 2001] Trade Commissioner Henry says 'Hello there, traveler. I don't believe that I have seen you around these parts before- then again, I could have and simply forgotten since there have been so many new faces around here. However, if you are a newcomer to Shadowhaven, please make sure that you [register for trading] in the Haven. Registering with the Traders of the Haven will legitimize you in the eyes of local merchants and customers. 

[Tue Dec 04 18:24:46 2001] You say, 'How to I register for trading?'

[Tue Dec 04 18:24:46 2001] Trade Commissioner Henry says 'It's great that you are interested Vespid, you will surely be glad you did. I have some simple deliveries that I need completed if you wish to be a registered trader in Shadowhaven. 

[Tue Dec 04 18:24:54 2001] You say, 'What deliveries?'

[Tue Dec 04 18:24:54 2001] Trade Commissioner Henry says 'The deliveries are simple enough, I just need you to bring some letters to some merchants of the Haven that are currently working in other locations. Will you [deliver these letters]? 

[Tue Dec 04 18:25:04 2001] You say, 'I will deliver these letters'

[Tue Dec 04 18:25:04 2001] Trade Commissioner Henry says 'I surely do appreciate the help, Vespid- clearly you understand the value of solid relations with the locals. First, I will need you to take this newsletter to Sateal. He is currently on assignment in the Bazaar and has been out of the loop on the happenings of Shadowhaven because of his heavy workload. Bring this to him and then return to me with his sales report. I look forward to seeing you soon. 

Sateal can be found on the outside wall of the bazaar

[Tue Dec 04 18:28:53 2001] Sateal Deirosap says 'Ah great, I have been meaning to go and pick one of these up from the Trade Commissioner but I have been very busy with my work. Im sure Henry has been waiting for my sales report so here it is. Please return it to him for me if you could and thanks again! 

[Tue Dec 04 18:28:53 2001] You gain experience!!

Back to Henry

[Tue Dec 04 18:31:39 2001] Trade Commissioner Henry says 'Great to see you back so soon Vespid, you looked like a dependable person from the start. The next thing I need you to do is a bit more dangerous, but by the looks of you I doubt it will be a problem. Go to the Shadowhaven outpost in Fungusgrove and give Thar this book. Thar is a great merchant but I have seen his sales steadily declining, so I figured this book full of selling tips will help him regain his confidence and help him produce the kinds of numbers I know he is capable of. If his economy report is ready please, bring that back to me when you return. 

[Tue Dec 04 18:31:39 2001] You gain experience!!

Now travel to Fungus Grove, which can be reached by going through the Echo Caverns. Hand the book to NPC Thar (loc needed)

[Tue Dec 04 23:34:25 2001] Thar Anton says 'I see you have brought a book from the Commissioner. Well I'm not much for reading but I will surely try anything that may increase my sales. Anyways I'm sure you arent that interested in how bad my sales are and would like to be on your way so here you go. 

[Tue Dec 04 23:34:25 2001] Your faction standing with Traders of the Haven got better.
[Tue Dec 04 23:34:25 2001] Your faction standing with House of Fordel got better.
[Tue Dec 04 23:34:25 2001] Your faction standing with House of Midst got better.
[Tue Dec 04 23:34:25 2001] Your faction standing with House of Stout got better.
[Tue Dec 04 23:34:25 2001] You gain party experience!!

Now go BACK to Shadow Haven and turn in the Report to Henry. (NOTE: You cannot bind in Fungus Grove.)

[Tue Dec 04 23:43:50 2001] Trade Commissioner Henry says 'Excellent work Vespid, I knew that you were someone that I could trust to get the job done. The trader's union of Shadowhaven will hear of your solid work ethic. Perhaps a courier job is in your future, I couldn't have expected anyone to make these deliveries as fast as you did! Please take this amulet as a symbol of your dedication to Shadowhaven's booming economy. While wearing this you are sure to get all the greatest deals from the merchants of the Haven both here and in the bazaar. It was a pleasure meeting, you and thanks for all of your help. 
[Tue Dec 04 23:43:50 2001] Your faction standing with Traders of the Haven got better.
[Tue Dec 04 23:43:50 2001] Your faction standing with House of Fordel got better.
[Tue Dec 04 23:43:51 2001] Your faction standing with House of Midst got better.
[Tue Dec 04 23:43:51 2001] Your faction standing with House of Stout got better.
[Tue Dec 04 23:43:51 2001] You gain party experience!!
[Tue Dec 04 23:43:55 2001] Vespid saved.

The item you recieve give you sufficient faction to buy/sell in Shadow Haven when worn.</TEXTAREA>
