I would prefer kill him in room though. You can pull his room until 2 guards left with him with a good pulling tactice(monk + rogue + Call of hero). Then rush in and let encs mez his guards. Don't let him get close to the doorway. His AE didn't aggro other sarnaks while we killing him.<P>He casts fire AE and hits for about 280(not too sure). Also casts AE dispell often. His AE only cut 2% of my hp when I have 147 FR at lv 57. So don't need to worry about it. His MR is very high. Don't try to stun or slow him until Tashan and Malosi on. Tell all your tanks take our their shield and bash him. You would prefer to nuke him with DD more than try to stun. Prolly all will get resisted.<P>Last note, don't try take queen after you kill king even the tanks push you to do it. One of the trip that I was in killed king with only 3 deaths. But all got wiped out when we pulled queen. She was alone in the room too. Only dropped her to 40% hp.

If he casts gravity flux (he cast it twice when I fought him) and you are in his room, life can get ugly.  This is why I suggest NOT fighting in his room since he can cast this very early in the fight.<P>Gate and complete heal will not be attempted until late in the fight and can be avoided entirely with enchanters.  Suck his mana dry is my suggestion.  I had three enchanters with me draining him and he stopped casting spells when he was around 40% life.  No complete heal and no gate.<P>We managed to pull him along with one guard to us at the ramp in the hall, and I think this may be the best method.

If you bring 4-5 enchanters that can chain sieve you might be ok.

(Had what, 4 chanters sieving him I think?)<P>I was the cleric in the pull group, and other then the first monk eating a death a few times, and the random chanter getting resists on AE mez, things went good.  Only heal I had to cast during the King fight we Word of Vigor toward the end, and even that wasn't really nessessary.<P>Some other tips...  If you plan on leaving after the Overking dies, move into the King pit and get out fast - you'll at best have 5 minutes before respawns of roamers or the King room, and if you wait too long, you'll find yourself fighting with half your team in, and half out.<P>Also, as you rush the Overking room, do NOT pause outside the Queen's door.  Hehehe...  Learned that the hard way.  Stick to the right side, and just rush the king, don't wait for everyone to move down first.  I got SUCH a sick feeling in my stomach as we rushed the solo King and started combat, then suddenly 4 sarnaks come through the queen door and proceed to wipe us out.   <IMG SRC="http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/frown.gif"></FONT></TD></TR></TABLE>
