I love it! Ok.. so I still can't tank but in a group situation this is going to be awesome. No more sitting on my can. I can cast yaulp and my mana still goes up. I was duoing with a ranger and we were doing great. We got two mobs and split. I would cast the new elixir mid fight and we had no problems. Just rooted the mob and stepped back a sec. I like the melee thing. Very fun! <br />
<br />
Now to all of you nay sayers... Give it a try folks... it is a fun new way to play the game.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Magada</div><div class="date">09-04-2002, 02:39 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">As it has been said before, I shall repeat although I might be considered a &quot;crybaby&quot; a &quot;whiner&quot; or any other name I have heard the cleric class in general called in the last couple of weeks.<br />
<br />
If I wanted to solo I would have played a druid wizard, shaman, etc etc.<br />
<br />
I will give it a fair test trial however. Might be fun while looking for a group.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Pirmin</div><div class="date">09-04-2002, 03:11 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">It IS fun!!!<br />
<br />
It might not be as powerful as the arsenal that druids and shammies got but for the moment I don't care! I'm meleeing again and somehow that old smile, that I (probably) had when I started out as a wee halfling, is back on my lips.<br />
<br />
I'm guna enjoy this to the fullest and if there comes a day when someone has parsed the hell outta this and comes to the conclusion that it's pretty worthless and just a &quot;bone thrown to us to shut us up&quot;...<br />
<br />
Well... I can always post a new message on the rant board again, can't I? ;)<br />
<br />
Hope You'll enjoy this as much as I do, brothers and sisters!</div></div><hr />

Some of us would like to be able to solo seeing that group oppertunities are not alway availible</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Caalin</div><div class="date">09-05-2002, 12:04 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">This is why i started  cleric to begin with.  EVERY other comp/paper games i've played, clerics have always been able to melee and heal. Imagine my  shock when i started EQ and found i needed to make my ass flat by sitting on it constantly. This is the way clerics should have been from the start. Excellent healers, and can fight too.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Windfire</div><div class="date">09-05-2002, 12:13 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok this is the problem. Its clerics like the poster that killed groups in sebilis today. That hammer IS NOT for when your grouped. Groups were whipping out by the dozens today because clerics want to play with there new toy instead of healing. <br />
<br />
Park your arss when your grouped because you are the healer. Ruine that and its your doom as a class.<br />
<br />
That hammer is a toy, its something new. Trust me in weeks to come you will see the old epics in hand and the clerics sitting down again. Because groups will not accept a melee cleric, they will pick the druid or shaman that WILL sit and heal.<br />
<br />
Im not here to bust on your new abilties, just use them with some brains.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hefflig Kelrik</div><div class="date">09-05-2002, 02:22 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">umm... the new Yaulp thing makes mana regen... would that stack with the medding regen? or is it just to offset the loss clerics get when we stand?... <br />
<br />
what the point of this question is would we be able to stand cast the yaulp and get more mana? or would that not work or be inificient? that's it i guess... always trying to find a new way to get more mana so one more person doesn't die... i almost feel like a humane society... (esp. with the Vah Shir...)<br />

So you mean what ive been doing the last 6 months or so when exping with friends/guildies the wrong way?<br />
<br />
I find this funny a druid telling clerics how to play Im just glad we are more mature then the people over at Druids Grove because I know the hell hole I would create if I went and told them how they should be playing.<br />
<br />
I meele all the time before the patch why, superior DPS, mudflation and grouping with friends/guildess (and before you say anything I DONT do pickup groups ever infact if I cant get a group with close friends/guildlies I log to a twink) means insteed of sitting on my ass like the above druid so elegantly put it I dont need to.<br />
<br />
<br />
Infact /gasp /shock ... I EVEN SOMETIMES PULL FOR MY GROUPS now dont go having a fit now about that little one and this just isnt in velks and other gimp zones infact the last PoF/pog one group exp farms with friends I pulled, meeled and also managed to keep our group alive /gasp /shock /choak<br />
<br />
<br />
And guess what the people I group with dont mind me doing so nor complain nor do we wipe out because Im not sitting on my ass they know Im very talented and skilled at doing what I do in exp groups.<br />

LOL this is plain ignorance.<br />
I have been meleeing since i got my first weapon at lvl 3 or 4,  this hammer is great for GROUPS, and makes soloing little bit easier.<br />
<br />
As a dwarven cleric its my duty to bonk few heads when doing XP and no way in hell im stand and listen to someone else tell ME how play a cleric(not even a fellow cleric can tell me how to play, and im sure not gonna tell them how to play it, unless they ask for advice)<br />
<br />
We all have different playing styles and nothing wrong with that, what fits some people dont fit others.<br />
<br />
So im gonna play my way, like i always have.<br />
<br />
And this about groups wiping out,  ye should have seen the clerics in my guild last night in NTOV..we were all meleeing and fooling around.  Did we wipe out? no, we even had ikiatar coming to us by surprise and we didnt loose anyone in that fight. (riposte from him hurts :(  )  so we played with our new toy, and we healed like we have before.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Vertigo</div><div class="date">09-05-2002, 05:54 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I also got to try this hammer out we were raiding in Kael and I helped clear some mobs a little I was pretty frightened to melee at all since I am so used to sitting and when I get agroed at all usually getting the snot kicked out of me I must say it was a blast I didn't see a huge damage output but was a blast :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Rubee</div><div class="date">09-05-2002, 06:57 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">My husband and I always play together. He is a warrior and he hates the hammer! He hates cause he thinks I should be sitting down meding. What he doesn't get is that the fight goes much faster when I help now and usually don't have to heal to the end. If I need to heal mid fight I just change my target and heal. I then go back to Meleeing. I did find that the ae Elixir was very nice in those situations since you don't have to change your target. I am sure he will get use to it!  I do swear that my mana regens just as fast or faster with yaulp. I suppose I will have to prove it to him. :D</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kegwell</div><div class="date">09-05-2002, 07:17 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">LOL<br />
 spent a couple hours in CT at Throne room, I didn't med untill the last 10 mins or so, meleed, casted pet,nuked, tossed in Ethereal lights and increased our DPS.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sherazade</div><div class="date">09-05-2002, 07:41 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I love this hammer - and now it maybe allows us to invite a second cleric into our groups - or when ever druids get their CH they can take over healing :b</div></div><hr />

They why didn't you sit and heal? Or were you too busy clicking all your nifty gadgets to even notice someone was getting spanked?<br />
<br />
And if I'm not accepted into groups just because I like to take a few swings with my Dawnfire I'll save them the troubles of disbanding me.<br />
<br />
<br />
Im not here to bust on your new abilties[/B]<br />
Yes you are.<br />
<br />
Windfire, if you are just here to stir the pot, do it in a smarter manner - your post shows alot of ignorance.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Barahir Ironaxe</div><div class="date">09-05-2002, 08:28 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">remember the times where there were five or six clerics in Sebilis at the zone yelling for groups, or, rather when getting trained by a gimp ass light blue mob, yelling for help?<br />
<br />
Those times are over now. I really like to see 5 cleric 1 shm/ench groups just for the fun of it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gryfalia</div><div class="date">09-05-2002, 09:19 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Actually, in Sebilis, especially the Crypt, I usually do the pulling.  Partially because MoR is a great pull spell, but more importantly..it's fun, and I like running around.  My mana starts to get low around the third cycle around, so the fourth one I will tell the pally to pull or something.<br />
<br />
Of course, I don't bring a druid along on my crypt groups.  Shaman, sure.  What would I want a druid for?  DS isn't really necessary, regen certainly isn't.  Gimme 2 mages any day.  Indeed, I love this make-up: Me (cleric), Shaman, 2 mages, pally, rogue.  It's insane.  Switch out a mage for another melee if you want, and the shaman isn't really necessary, but it's nice.  But if I bring a druid along I just get out-PLooted more..<br />
<br />
Yes, some of this is tongue in cheek, you figure out what parts..<br />
