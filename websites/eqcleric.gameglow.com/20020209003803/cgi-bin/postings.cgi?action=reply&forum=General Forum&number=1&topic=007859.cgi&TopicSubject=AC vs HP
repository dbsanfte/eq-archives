Barring getting a DA/DB off, no ammount of AC is gonna save ms if I draw aggro from alot of higher level MOBs.<P>This guy is level 39. He wont be 39 forever, so in 10-11 short levels when he starts joining raids and such, he's not gonna want to swap out his armor all over again.

I functioned just fine.  Gear doesn;t make up for skill, so just do what works for you.  I try to balance them all.  <P>Unlike many of the posters here, I own no Ntov/sleeper/VP loot and very litte velious quest armor.

Eg. Sv Poison. With high resists you can be killing every asp in EC at level 6 because no one else will touch them. Then later you can do the spiders in UGuk and have the whole camp to yourself.<P>Can you imagine being one of those soloing monk twinks and getting diseased?<P></FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#f7f7f7"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Nanilya Silverwind</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">At this level, your AC isn't something you should realy care about, considering that it isn't something very easily quantifiable in terms of utility.  The mobs which you will be fighting will become increasingly more powerful as you level, so if you do place a high value on AC, then you will have to constantly upgrade.<P>HP and Mana on the other hand are something that you can easily quantify in terms of utility, and something which is more or less constant.  With AC, it might help, it might not, who knows.  You might get hit, you might not get hit once an entire night, there really is no way of determining just how much your AC will actually help you since you are a cleric and you're not supposed to get hit.  Mana can be directly translated into a certain amount of buffing/healing and so forth, so you get a more definite and quantifiable result of adding more wis/mana gear.<P>Resists are somewhat something entirely different.  Some spells are simply harder to resist than others, and resists work in such a broken way that you can't "really" say how useful resists are in everyday grouping.  However, I doubt that you're going to be hit with a significant amount of spells in your average grouping, and if you are fighting heavy caster mobs, then just put on some resist gear if you find that it does help.<P>But in all honesty, you're probably going to go through quite a bit of gear between now and level 60, and once you get 46 and start to hit Hate, and possibly do some of the Velioius armor quests, then you won't have to worry so much about what to use.  Of course, this is just my opinion, and everybody has different experiences.  Just try a little of everything until you find what you feel works best.<p>[This message has been edited by Nanilya Silverwind (edited 01-31-2002).]</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#dedfdf"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Adon</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">*edited out my Dikmer flames, I'm sorry Dik!*<P>You posted<BR>  <BLOCKQUOTE><font size="1" face="Verdana, Arial">quote:</font><HR>Actually, he's 39, and 39 is high enough to join Naggy raids<HR></BLOCKQUOTE><P>To which I responded that no matter what his resists are, at his level, he's going to get hit for full and feared 99% of the time.<P>I am astounded that anyone who plays as much as you have would think that resist gear is more important than hp/ac/mana at level 39.<P>So my advice to this cleric is start saving  for a resist gear set which you ONLY put on during dragon raids.  And don't go on any Naggy/Vox raids until you are level 45 if you want to be a meaningful contributor.<P>For normal exp grouping, get your wis to 200, then go for ac/hp/mana gear (all of equal importance). You really are going to be doing a complete gear swap in the next 10 levels (Thurg plate and hate armor), so don't go nuts.<P><p>[This message has been edited by Adon (edited 02-01-2002).]</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#f7f7f7"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Feias</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Ditmer was pointing out that whatever level he was, looking toward the future, resists may be more important than either AC or HP.  At 39 your right he will get nailed my Vox or Naggy for max or near max even with 999 resist.  But, quote Ditmer, "in 10-11 short levels" resists will be more important.  And this is the key point.  Unless he is going to be 39 for a long time resists will soon be more important.<P>Replying to your post I think AC is better then HP though HP is more easily quantified.<P>Overall I think mana and resists are more important than either AC or HP.<P>The only time you ought to be getting hit is in bad situations, or by AOE.  Bad situations are not going to be something you can really plan for and most likely no matter what your AC or HP is you will die.  With AOE (maybe not at 39) you can avoid much damage by having decent resists.<p>[This message has been edited by Feias (edited 01-31-2002).]</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#dedfdf"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Dikmer</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Well, I was only trying to help the guy save some future heartache and trouble.<P>I remember thinking at 39 that AC/HP was the way to go (and it is, really). So I spent ALOT of time questing and camping for good, high AC items. Or I spent alot of hard earned PP on stuff I couldn't get on my own. Then by 45/46, I was ALREADY looking at switching most of that stuff out. And then at 51/52, I was switching out AGAIN. <P>Unfortunatly, the stuff I paid 3k for at 39 wasn't worth 500 by the time I got to 50. 2500pp loss on an item I only wore for 11 levels. If I had it all to do over again, at 39/40, I would already have been looking at some of the easier to get high level gear, and skip the mid-level stuff altogether.<P>If this guy is anything like I was, he's gonna wanna save as much cash as he can and by skipping some stages of the armor advancement, he can avoid some of the "costly" purchases I made.</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#f7f7f7"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Kornaena</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">I agree with you there Dikmer.  However I can also I never bought any of my gear.  I totally skipped most midlevel gear unless I got it myself.  I wore gator legs into my mid 50's with abolutely no problems whatso ever(wore penitent greaves that i quested for a while also before they make them easier).  <P>I am not a proponent sacrificing wis/hp/mana for  AC.  Matter of fact, I ignore AC for the most part.  I do however try to get gear that combines all positive attributes.  Shandel bandit ring comes to mind, BS earrings, cleansing, purity earrings.  High AC good cleric Items will come with time and as you level/raid.  Trying to go out and buy yourself into a state of uberness seems like a waste of pp.  <P>Day to day use, more mana will be more useful than having a super high ac.

I think i am going to look to the future and purchase resist gear. forgot about the lovely casting mobs out there  <IMG SRC="http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/wink.gif"><P>Amoritay</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#dedfdf"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Dikmer</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Well, FWIW, I do wear some "resist" gear full time, but they have other stats as well.<P>Platinum Diamond Wedding Band has +5 to a couple resists, but also has 5 wis and some AC/mana.<P>2 X Electrum Blue Diamond Earrings. Yeah, I could wear forrest loops, but these also have +35 mana.<P>Sarnak Battle shield has no wis, but nice AC and good MR/FR/CR.<P>The only "resist gear" I swap out, is a Velium Diamond ring that I put where my Golem Tear ring is, and a Golden Diamond Mask that I put where my Mask of War is. This drops me to 190 wis  <IMG SRC="http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/frown.gif"> but I STILL maintain 1024 AC self buffed and around 90 in all resists.</FONT></TD></TR></TABLE>
