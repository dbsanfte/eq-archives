          <strong>Aguth, Rallos Zek (<a href="#Comments from Dallben" style="color: #0000FF">comments
          </a>by Dallben, Tarew Marr)</strong></p>
          <hr>
          <p><strong>1st</strong> some important information.&nbsp;&nbsp; If you
          are going to meditate in here make sure all the greens around you are
          dead. Things that normally would ignore you will attck if you are in
          range and meditate.&nbsp;</p>
          <p><strong>2nd</strong> there is no completely safe place in
          befallen.&nbsp;&nbsp; Outside the dungeon there are a couple of NPC's
          that spawn that are level 18+, if you rest by the zone you can usually
          zone before they kill you.&nbsp; If you rest right inside the zone
          sometimes a dry bone skeleton or ghoul appears on the top level and
          they are for levels 17 or so.&nbsp; Also there is a named mummy that
          walks the dungeon from time to time, he yells a lot about coming to
          kill everyone so you ussually can zone to avoid him.</p>
          <p><strong>3rd</strong> Locked doors, there is a locked door leading
          to each new level, you need to kill a shadowknight to get the key to
          unlock the door.&nbsp;&nbsp; The shadowknights are usually a good
          indication, if you can't kill the shadowknight don't go to the next
          level.&nbsp; They key to 3rd level is a no rent item!&nbsp; Do not
          camp on the third level!</p>
          <p><strong>4th</strong> Traps- there is a well on first level that
          leads to a nasty point in the 3rd level&nbsp;&nbsp; Don't go look down
          the well because you'll probablyfall in.&nbsp; In one of the
          shadowknight rooms in the 2nd level there is a pit leading to the 3rd
          level.&nbsp; If you fall in this you'll be in a safe room, so<br>
          either gate out or give a shout and ask if anyone can come help you
          get out.&nbsp; If you have the key to 3rd level and want to<br>
          make a run for it, open the door to the room and hang a left, follow
          the wall to the left until you enter a small circular area with a
          door, thats the door back to second level.</p>
          <p><br>
          <strong>Level 1</strong> - This area is solo all the way.&nbsp; Every
          cleric should go here from level 7-9 IMO.</p>
          <blockquote>
            <p><strong>Skeletons - lvl 6-9</strong>.&nbsp; These are your basic
            run of the mill skeletons I wouldn't advise hunting them until level
            7 since sometimes they are linked.<br>
            <strong>Decaying Skeletons, Wimpy Skeletons&nbsp; </strong>lvl 3-5&nbsp;&nbsp;
            These are just cannon fodder.&nbsp; Most likely if you can hunt in
            here they won't give experience, I usually kill them just so a
            skeleton can replace them and I can get the loot.<br>
            <strong>Rats</strong> - lvl 4-8 there are some various types of rats
            in here they are generally pretty easy but the plague rats can
            disease you.&nbsp; I kill them just to avoid the meditation
            problems.<br>
            <strong>Skeleton Lordd</strong> - lvl 13-16&nbsp; This is the
            toughest thing you'll find on this level, he might even give
            experience at 17th level I'm not sure.&nbsp; He doesn't usually have
            any loot but he's some easy experience if you can take him.<br>
            <strong>Shadowknight</strong> - not sure what level this guy is, I'd
            say around 7-10.&nbsp;&nbsp; He has a pet so he can be tough since
            you are basically fighting 2 creatures in one.<br>
            <strong>Necro Initiate</strong> - not sure what level, just be
            warned that necros are always tougher than they con.&nbsp; If he's
            blue to you your going to have your hands full going solo.</p>
          </blockquote>
          <p><strong>Level 2</strong> - lvl 12-16.&nbsp; You can find some
          things to hunt at lower levels but I wouldn't advise it.&nbsp; A group
          of 3 15th level people is perfect down here IMO.</p>
          <blockquote>
            <p><strong>Zombie</strong> - lvl&nbsp; 8-11&nbsp; These are pretty
            easy, and give little experience.<br>
            <strong>Lesser mummy</strong> - lvl 13-16&nbsp; These can hit pretty
            hard.&nbsp; They also give rabies so have a cure disease ready.&nbsp;
            They sometimes carry bronze weapons (joy).<br>
            <strong>Large Skeleton</strong> - lvl 8-11&nbsp; These are just
            harder skeletons.<br>
            <strong>Greater Skeleton</strong> lvl 12-15&nbsp; These hit very
            hard, they con easier than mummies but are just as hard.&nbsp; They
            also sometimes carry bronze weapons or raw-hide armor.<br>
            <strong>Woman Shadowknight</strong> lvl ? - Only fought her with a
            15th level ranger, she was green and pretty easy.&nbsp; The pt to
            3rd level is in her room.<br>
            <strong>Ogre Shadowknight</strong> lvl 13-16&nbsp; This guy can be
            pretty hard. He likes to run away a lot and he moves pretty fast for
            a big old fat ogre.&nbsp; To get to him you need to get a key from
            the woman shadowkngiht.&nbsp; He also occasionally drops the barbed
            arms.<br>
            <strong>Necro Acolyte</strong> lvl 13-16&nbsp; again these guys will
            con easier than they are.&nbsp; There DOT spells are nasty and they
            will heal nearby undead that you are fighting.<br>
            <strong>Willowisp</strong> - lvl 12-15&nbsp; These are pretty easy
            for fighters with magic weapons.&nbsp; This variety of wisp tends to
            resist spells a lot more than any other I've found.</p>
          </blockquote>
          <p><br>
          <strong>Level 3</strong> - lvl 17-22, I've hunted down here in a group
          of 16th level people and we died just a bit too often, did pretty well
          and didnt' have a cleric.</p>
          <blockquote>
            <p><br>
            <strong>Elf Skeleton</strong> -&nbsp; This guy hits hard, I dont'
            think you need magic to hit him though, I've only fought him one
            time so I'm not sure.<br>
            <strong>Ice Boned Skeleton</strong> - These are pretty easy IMO,
            Biggest problem with them is they are magic only, they cast frost
            spells as well.<br>
            <strong>Necro Theurugist</strong> -&nbsp; These guys cast nasty DD,
            they con green at level 16 but don't be fooled, they are tougher
            than they look.&nbsp; There is a Eurudite Necro that drops the
            Gossamer Robe.<br>
            <strong>Ogre ShadowKnight</strong> - This guy is nasty. He drops the
            bone bladed claymore.<br>
            <b>Dark Elven ShadowKnight</b> - Approximately level 17, she
            sometimes drops the Barbed Legs.<br>
            <strong>Ghoul</strong> -&nbsp; These are magic only and they carry a
            lot of punch. They hit for up to 40 damage a hit.</p>
          </blockquote>
          <p><br>
          Well thats all I know about befallen, its a good dungeon for a group
          of 2 or 3 of the proper level but its small.&nbsp; If you do a /who
          and see 40+ people I'd suggest hunting elsewhere.<br>

          <p><strong><a name="Comments from Dallben">Comments from Dallben</a></strong></p>
          <p>Here are a few additions, notes and 1 correction.</p>
          <p>Just a note for bronze weapons:&nbsp; I only got 3 bronze weapon in
          the 2 weeks I was there and I only got them from ghouls.&nbsp; I
          killed TONS of mummies and greater skeles, but no bronze.&nbsp; Maybe
          I was unlucky, but just thought I would throw that out.</p>
          <p>As for necros, you are correct in saying they are tougher than they
          appear. In all the groups I fought with, we ALWAYS killed the necro
          first, NO MATTER WHAT ELSE WAS ATTACKING US.&nbsp; That should tell
          you how tough they can be.</p>
          <p>One correction I saw was that you mentioned a dry bone skeleton
          appearing on the first level.&nbsp; I have never seen a dry bone skele
          in Befallen, but I do know that ice bone skeles spawn right next to
          the zone on the first level. I am assuming that is what you meant.</p>
          <p>As for the gossamer robes, there is a Theurogist, kinda like the
          head necro, that drops the robes.&nbsp; He does NOT have necro before
          his name.&nbsp; As for the BBC, the troll sk on level 3 drops the bbc.</p>
          <p>No, the elf skele does not require magical weapons to hit.</p>
          <p>There is also a lvl 20+ zombie named Commander Windstream which is
          part of a quest.&nbsp; If anyone shouts that he is loose, ZONE
          IMMEDIATELY if you are below lvl 18-20.&nbsp; He is quite like Dvinn
          from Crushbone from the few encounters I had with him.&nbsp; He hits
          hard and fast.</p>
