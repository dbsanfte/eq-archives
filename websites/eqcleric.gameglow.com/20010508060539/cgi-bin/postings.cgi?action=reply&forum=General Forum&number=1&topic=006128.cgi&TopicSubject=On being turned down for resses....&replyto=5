It looked like the Goons had been through the area again, and several corpses were lying about the valley.  So while I was waiting, I offered resurrections to the clothed bodies.  <P>"Would you like a Res?"<P>Dead guy answers, "ummmmmmm, exp res?"<P>Erz replies, "ummmmmm, rude way to respond to a favor."<P>The guy got really upset, called me a name, and I snapped back something about not bothering to try next time and threw him on ignore.<P>Now here's my question.  I'm a very nice person, really, but that entire conversation got out of hand, and all I would have had to do to prevent it is say yes, 49th res.  But, I'm 51st level, I'm not anon or roleplay, and a simple /who would have answered  his question.  He didn't even ask it nicely.  <P>To top it off, this was a level 40 druid.  40!  Not like he was 59th level.  Not like 49 clerics run through Overthere every 30 seconds.  Anyway, he may have had another account with a cleric or a friend at his beck and call, but he no longer has me.<P>Guess I should be less sensitive, but the way he asked was so irritating.  And the way he whipped back at my comment was completely unnecessary.<P>Erz</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#f7f7f7"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">JaigeTZ</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">"Dead guy answers, "ummmmmmm, exp res?""<P>I think some people take that question a bit to seriously...<P>------------------<BR><B>Jaige</B><BR>52 Cleric of Innoruuk<BR><A HREF="http://pub19.ezboard.com/bedarkie" TARGET=_blank>Eternal Darkness</A><BR>Tallon Zek</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#dedfdf"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Daach Holliday</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">If I happen to be rolling thru and zone and see a corspe and ask that same question and get a response of "what level ar you" or "well let me check on a higher rez and I will get back to you". I immediatley move on. I am always non-anon and do rezzes for most I see. Its a slap in the face to me when I ask someone that I am doing a favor for to be responded to like that. The total of 6% percent exp is basically a few kills in most zones. Folks need to learn that 6% percent is not going to make that big of a diff. At 55 I rez level 60s all the time. Those folks understand that the little exp you wont get back is not worth the time looking around for a better rez, now only if the others would understand this.<P>------------------<BR><B>Daach Holliday</B><BR>55th Level Gnomish Cleric<P>[This message has been edited by Daach Holliday (edited 04-29-2001).]<p>[This message has been edited by Daach Holliday (edited 04-29-2001).]</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#f7f7f7"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">kitsinu</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">At 40, he was asking if it was the 29 Revive or the 39 Resuscitate.  If he was nearby, he might not have wanted to lose his mana.  Perhaps he was arranging a 39 Cleric to help out.  This is the point when it is probably a good time to take a vacation from EQ or from playing a Cleric.  There are a lot of high stress problems with playing a Cleric at any level.  49+ can be the real breaking point.  You become a slave to Resurrections and your help isn't always wanted.</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#dedfdf"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Zygote</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">you mean some druid was being an asshole? The heck you say!<P>Get use to it. For some reason druids tend to attract asshole players. I think its the lure of soloing that atrracts people with poor social skills.<P>At anyrate, I occasionally come across someone who is rude about wanting a res. I offered this one guy a res in BW once, and he said he only wanted one from a Cleric Rez Stick because it gave him back more xp than level 56 spell version. The moral is some people are just so stupid, there is no hope for them.<P>Now I dont begrudge anyone the right to take a res from whoever they want, afterall I hold the right to not res whoever I want. But I'm at least not rude when I tell someone I am busy.

But I let them know I am moving and it is last call.<P>When I was 48, I got that question a lot more.  And the res is a big difference from 39 to 49.  I don't consider it an insult.  It is a request for information.  I also walk around /role most of the time now.  It is a lot more fun to me to not be interrupted constantly for res requests and raid requests.  Most of the resses I do now are drive by and OOC.  They can't do /w on me because I am /role, so it doesn't bother me a bit.  A druid might very well think you are /role anyway as a cleric, since they get pestered for ports far more then clerics get pestered for resses.
