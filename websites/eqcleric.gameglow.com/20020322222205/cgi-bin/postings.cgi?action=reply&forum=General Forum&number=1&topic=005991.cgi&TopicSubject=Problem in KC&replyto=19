[B]My 2¢ worth on this one.

This whole NBG thing puzzles me somewhat.  Growing up my cleric, I have not experienced this mode of thinking until after hitting level 50.  I'm all in favor of getting a piece of equipment by default but would be just as thrilled if it was rolled for by everyone.  EVEN if I loose.
Everyone can and does benifit from every non-no drop item in the game.  Just because I can't weild a lammy does not mean I cannot benefit from the SALE of it.  
Regeants cost us clerics a fortune and any monies I can recoup via the sale of an item benefit me more than the warrior getting it by default.  AND I believe that same goes for the warrior that cannot use the Donal's pieces that drop but CAN benefit from the sale/trade of that item.
I'm always playing the pickup groups I'm with by ear nowadays.  If they want to default items to a specific class then that's ok, if they want to FFA then that's fine with me as well.  As long as the group agrees as a whole everyone has fun and gets something good.
Guess to me NBG or FFA makes no difference to me.  Either will eventually get me what I want one way or another.

First pull after me joining was the Capt he dropped Cobalt guants. I didnt roll cause I just joined and they warrior only. Everyone rolled chanter won. They said this is an "everyone rolls group". That is rare for KC but I accepted it. An hour later a warrior joins us, and within 15min the Capt spawns and drops the guants again. We all rolled and a monk won. The warrior proceeded to throw a tantrum, he rolled to but lost, called us all names and left the group. He then started giving us all tells, me included. I told him "this is a FFA group". He then started to threaten and harass me. He said he was gonna put my name on all the boards claiming I am a loot whore. I got mad and told him "You can do what you want, but if I won the guants they be in my bag now". <BR>  During the argument I said nothing. I was torn between the sides. He was only warrior in group and should get guants. Group rule is everyone rolls. I have already noticed this warrior posting on diff sites about the conflict.<BR>  This warrior was and is acting very immature. The monk that won the guants posted that he would give him the guants just to clear up this prob. I give alot of respect to the monk for that. After all the threats and harassment I would never, EVER give him those guants. <BR>  If I won the roll I would have given him the guants right there. After the way the warrior is acting I am sooo glad I lost.<BR>  I checked the board again and found someone who said this warrior has won cobalt guants before and sold them. If that is true then he is using the NBG rule to be a loot whore himself.<BR>  Anyway, that is what happened. Any comment on a diff way I should have handled it would be appreciated.<P>Jake level 51 Vicar</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#f7f7f7"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Aladain</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">This is another example of reason why you MUST explain the loot rules EVERY TIME **ESPECIALLY** when a class comes to a camp that drops his goodies. (i.e. Warrior to capt group).<P>I'd be pissed too, but I wouldn't throw that kind of fit like he did.  I *ALWAYS* ask when camping hands, etc "If donals gaunts drop, are we rolling, or are they NBG?".  If they roll, I say they can find another cleric and move on.  I've never had a problem with this.<P>Aladain</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#dedfdf"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Myc</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">You really are in a no-win situation.  Yes, as the other poster said, always explain loot rules.  However no one will ever be satisfied.<P>I was in the same situation as you.  The Cobalt gauntlets dropped.  A warrior was in the group.  It was NBG, however the main person was a little shy.  So I insisted that the warrior take them since she could use.  The enchanter promptly disbanded, and we later found out because it was NBG.<P>So you will find greedy people everywhere.  I'm not sure what the solution is.  If it is NBG, people will get mad.  If everyone rolls, people will get mad.  I personally prefer NBG in KC, mainly because if something drops I could use, I would hate for a monk or someone to win the roll and loot it.  Normally if you stay long enough you can get SOMETHING in KC.  Whether it be some Kunark armor, a Sarnak Hide Mask, etc.<P>Just don't worry too much about it.  And keep track of the childish people, so that if something drops that only they can use, you can remind them of what they thought of NBG before.

You end up with a cleric winning a pally item with a pally in the group winning a cleric item, but the cleric item might be worth 12k and the pally item might be worth only 4k, so they wont swap.<P>I dunno bout yall (and following Raynes advice, I'm not going to advocate this topic go to a NBG discussion) but I've NEVER had a problem with NBG.  The only time its a problem is if someone with NBG sells the item and expects it NBG next time.  I personally dont see a problem with that - VERY FEW people sell items received over NBG, and VERY MANY people get upset (reasonably, not a temper tantrum like that warrior) that their roll wasnt the winning one.  You hurt a lot more folks IMO.<P>Nuff of that  <IMG SRC="http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/smile.gif"><P>Aladain</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#dedfdf"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Wisecleric</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">"VERY FEW people sell items received over NBG,"<P>Thats really not very likely. Almost EVERY item someone gets is eventually sold, traded, or given away at some point. Usually its sold/trade to acquire better items. So in the end, the item is, pretty much, always used to acquire better items. In NBG, only certain members of a group are allowed to benifit from the item. In a /random group, everyone gets that opportunity. Which is more fair? Seem pretty obvious to me. <P>"and VERY MANY people get upset." <P>Its been my experience that the only people that get upset are the ones that are primarily thinking only of themselves. They REFUSE to see that that item can also benifit someone else. Why can't people be happy that another member of their group (who is risking the SAME as you) is granted the ability to improve their character? Its all me! me! me!. Bleh!  <P>If someone wins a piece of Donal's in my /random group, im happy for them. I hope they can use it to acquire a decent item they can use. I hope that it brings them some extra enjoyment from this game. Even if they sell it for plat and blow it all on tradeskills, im happy for them. Why is this type of attitude considered so "greedy"? Where does greed play ANY part in such mentality? Tell me, i would like to know. <P><BR></FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#f7f7f7"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Aladain</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Wisecleric,<P>I've gotten several things on NBG and still have.  You bet I'll sell or trade in the future, but they will get used quite a bit before that point - Quite a difference from a warrior winning a cleric item, and 5 seconds later, /auctioning the zone.<P>NBG has nothing to do with greed, it ensures that the item WILL get at least some use by someone who can use it and would use it before it gets traded, and passed on to someone else.   If you NBG *everything* on this premis, its in balance, because there are X cleric items that X clerics will win, and those X items will get used by the person that won it before they are passed on.  Under /random rules, its VERY likely for a_warrior01 to win a cleric item (or whatever other class item), and group breaks up, and next day a_warrior01 (same person) wins THE SAME item again.  Different group - but same cleric, and same warrior.  THATS greed.  Warrior 2, Cleric 0.  Meanwhile, a_cleric01 has to spend hours upon hours for what?  To hope that a group doesnt change, or that he gets lucky on a roll, or he ends up in a NBG group that he would get the item.  Maybe its only because I play on Thlouxe Paells, and for those that also play on this server - You know that NBG is everywhere, and its done RIGHT.  No one complains, and if someone even suggests a random on a item that someone else in the group that use, they are seen as being greedy.<P>As for the topic of being upset, and with what I said above - lets say you were camping hands in karnors for 5 levels, and a total of 5 donals gauntlets dropped, and THE SAME PERSON won that item each time, and subsequently sold it, I'd like to know how you'd feel, and if on the 5th time the warrior won that item, if the cleric asked him "Can I please have those, you've already won 4" would you consider that greed?<P>Sure, I'm happy when someone wins something, but at the same time, in karnors/seb/whatever, when cobalt drops, it goes to the warrior.  When donals drops, it goes to the cleric.  If cobalt drops, and warrior wants, I refuse to random it, or will openly say that I will give to the warrior if I win because he deserves it anyway.  He fought for it.  This crap about a mage getting it because he got lucky with dice is absolutely absurd.  When the mage item drops, he gets it.  Thats how it should work IMO.<P>Tell me, when you go to a newbie zone (I dont know if you've ever done this), and have a item, like a Blackened iron medallion, or other such lower-level item, and you /ooc "Find me and poke me for a free BIM", why are you doing this?  I do it all the time to help my fellow casters out on equipment.  I also say that only casters can participate because the LAST thing I want is a rogue for instance winning that to 5 seconds later /auction it off.  If that were the case, thats no different than me giving 100pp to someone in west freeport begging for money.<P>I'm not going to reply on this anymore, only cuz I dont wanna piss off Rayne, he seems to not like these NBG discussions, but I felt that playing on thlouxe paells, and the near-perfection of NBG looting, it needed to be said.  In fact, in all my 55 levels (I got 55 back today!!), I have never been in a group that wasn't NBG.<P>Aladain<BR>55th Season Templar of Tunare</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#dedfdf"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Veraphie</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Personally, I like NBG not because I think it's fair but because most people on Vazaelle won't whine if loot were distributed NBG.<P>Do I think it's fair? Nope, not really. You can't always get a group to camp you cleric items. Yes they tried to fix that with random drops in some dungeons, but there are just SO MANY more melee things, pure caster things that drop. As long as it's tradable, it's prefectly true that everyone should get a chance to random it. The only problem I have with randoming things is that I don't think spells should be randomed. Personally though, on Vazaelle, there's just too many people who have NBG embedded into them for me to want to try to convince them otherwise. <P>I'm fine with either policy, but I think wisecleric is right. And if you play enough, you'll eventually get nice gear. So who really cares?

And I'm not bashing and I dont think Wisecleric is either - I'm just expressing frustration how its somehow reguarded fair that when a group breaks up, it "resets" the random rules, thus allowing the same people to win the same item multiple times, at times, in front of the same people they won that item in the first place.  Warrior01 wins Item01 that Cleric01 can use.  Group breaks up, 5 hours later, group reforms again with same Warrior01 and Cleric01, but rest in group are different.  Same item drops.  Warrior01 randoms because he sold the first item and can loot it again. He wins roll and gets item.  Fair?  No.<P>Random would totally work - provided the group never broke up until 6 people got the same items.<P>I agree with you about the spells, but how's that different from items?  They are both needed, and in fact, I swing more to randoming for spells than I do for items, though I still think both should be given to the class that can benefit from it most.<P>Aladain<BR>55th Season Templar of Tunare</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#dedfdf"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">kaharz</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">I've only been in one FFA group in KC.  A jade mace dropped just before I left.  Everyone rolled, but luckily one of the warriors won (I know it isn't warr only but, the only people in the group who actually needed it were both warriors)<P>A friend from a old guild was standing behind me and about to join the group.  He is a warrior too and when he saw everyone roll he sent me a tell saying "FFA?  WTF?" and left to join a group in well room instead.  Can't blame him.  All my other groups there have been NBG, but the only other decent drop I've seen there is ES vambs since I've never even been as far as hand room except to loot a supple scale wristband that no one in hand wanted (guild leader was in the group).<P>I will join an FFA group, but only because I'm desperately trying to catch up to my friends somewhat and start going to the planes, and at 45ht and 46th it isn't always easy to find a group inside KC.  The only time I get pissed off by need before greed is when someone gets the drop they wanted and split immediately for another group because they want to get other drops and probably won't get anymore in the current group.  I haven't seen that in KC yet, but I've only one seen one decent drop in their as stated before.  I have seen it in Lguk with FFA groups.  PlayerX wins the RC, "oh gee my spot just opened in FG, I'm going to go there."  PlayerX wins FBSS, "I promised magi I would help them" (I don't think they got an SMR)<BR>Outside that rare and small abuse I perfer NBG in most situations where there is loot for almost everyone.  Had a guy go off in guk before about it being FFA.  Told him that there was absolutely no reason for me to stay there then.  This guy was also a 55th lvl mage who was trying to lay claim to camping right to ass, exe, cav, and sav.  And twice came walked past into sage room while we were sitting there and killed the scribe PH, so his arguement didn't hold much water.<P>Kaharz Stronginthearm <BR>46th lvl cleric of Brell<BR>Rodcet Nife<BR>Flames of Faradhim<BR></FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#f7f7f7"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Brambodius</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Sure fire way to stay cool with your group.<P>1) When you are in an area that drops your equip make sure that either the classes that aren't up for uber NBG drops are getting priority on other junk (bonus to rolls or whatever).  This is especially important to chanters who IMHO work their asses off and get screwed big time by NBG.<P>2) When you are in an area that doesn't drop your junk, promote NBG.  Its hard for people to argue with a non-dropping class that is promoting NBG and its the better loot policy anyways.  Consider suggesting some way to handle the non-class loot if you can to get some equalization going.<P>You may spend some time chatting about loot in the group while you are breaking in but a good group won't mind the discussion if it keeps the group togethor and everyone happy.<P>Brambodius - Temple of Bristlebane<BR>Quellious</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#dedfdf"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Badaf</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Aladain: "I'm just expressing frustration how its somehow reguarded fair that when a group breaks up, it "resets" the random rules, thus allowing the same people to win the same item multiple times, at times, in front of the same people they won that item in the first place. Warrior01 wins Item01 that Cleric01 can use. Group breaks up, 5 hours later, group reforms again with same Warrior01 and Cleric01, but rest in group are different. Same item drops. Warrior01 randoms because he sold the first item and can loot it again. He wins roll and gets item. Fair? No" <P>Yes its perfectly, 100% fair in my opinion. Every person in both groups had an equal opportunity to improve their character through item acquistion. I guess this is the basic reason behind our disagreement on this matter and theres probably nothing either of us can say to changes our mines.<P>"NBG has nothing to do with greed, it ensures that the item WILL get at least some use by someone who can use it and would use it before it gets traded, and passed on to someone else. If you NBG *everything* on this premis, its in balance, because there are X cleric items that X clerics will win, and those X items will get used by the person that won it before they are passed on."<P>This really makes littles sense to me. This time frame of an item being gained and then used is really irrelevant to this discussion from my point of view. Why does it matter so much that an item "will get used" for X amount of time before it gets sold/traded? I look at loot items as a way to improve a character. Sometimes its an instant improvement, sometimes its not instant. But when you boil it down its STILL improvement.<P>"This crap about a mage getting it (cobalt) because he got lucky with dice is absolutely absurd. When the mage item drops, he gets it. Thats how it should work IMO."<P>The flaw in this mentality is that where pick-up groups are the norm there are practically NO caster drops. Casters, therefore, are regulated to bottom-feeding as the other classes rake in the loot. Its not like when something drops that no one in the group can use that only those classes that do not have loot drops get to roll for it. That was an awkward sentence so ill clarify. Lets in a group with no SK is in Seb and a piece of Bloodember armor drops. Does everyone roll? You bet they do. If someone wins, then later a piece of class specific armor they can use drops, that player has to cough up to blood ember right? So players that have no drops there have to compete for the non-usuable items with the same people that automatically get items. See how this is unfair to the classes that do not have any drops in that area? NBG would be more fair (although not as fair as randoming in my opinion) IF characters that do not have drops at that location were the ONLY ones allowed to roll on items that no one in the group could use. <P>"I've gotten several things on NBG and still have. You bet I'll sell or trade in the future, but they will get used quite a bit before that point"<P>Again whats the big deal about using an item before its traded/sold? Still this just does not make sense to me. The bottom line is that item can benifit any person in the group."<P>"Quite a difference from a warrior winning a cleric item, and 5 seconds later, /auctioning the zone."<P>So 10 seconds later he trades the item for a Lamination blade to a cleric that just won one over in the necro/guard camp. <P>15 seconds have elapsed. WOW, i can't believe that item got unused for 15 WHOLE seconds. See how this whole speel on "time used" really is irrelevent to this matter? </FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#f7f7f7"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">greywolffe</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">My 2¢ worth on this one.<P>This whole NBG thing puzzles me somewhat.  Growing up my cleric, I have not experienced this mode of thinking until after hitting level 50.  I'm all in favor of getting a piece of equipment by default but would be just as thrilled if it was rolled for by everyone.  EVEN if I loose.<BR>Everyone can and does benifit from every non-no drop item in the game.  Just because I can't weild a lammy does not mean I cannot benefit from the SALE of it.  <BR>Regeants cost us clerics a fortune and any monies I can recoup via the sale of an item benefit me more than the warrior getting it by default.  AND I believe that same goes for the warrior that cannot use the Donal's pieces that drop but CAN benefit from the sale/trade of that item.<BR>I'm always playing the pickup groups I'm with by ear nowadays.  If they want to default items to a specific class then that's ok, if they want to FFA then that's fine with me as well.  As long as the group agrees as a whole everyone has fun and gets something good.<BR>Guess to me NBG or FFA makes no difference to me.  Either will eventually get me what I want one way or another.<P>------------------<BR>Greywolffe Silverstarr<BR>52nd Cleric of Tunare<BR>E'Marr<p>[This message has been edited by greywolffe (edited 04-16-2001).]</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#dedfdf"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Corynthia</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">there is one place in Norrath that me avoids, and that is LGUK, that is breeding place for greedy people, at me server atleast.<BR>me has only had good experience groupin with people in Karnor, the loot has been terrible for me there hehehe  the /random commands hates me  <IMG SRC="http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/smile.gif"> but me dont care really.<BR>and about sebilis, well me only go there with people me know and trust, had one very bad xp there about greed and that almost cost me corpse.  we were campin 4 doors, and also takin blood.  then the ranger in our group says that emperor is up, and our rogue says that we can take him out easily(average lvl was 54 on groupmates) so we go and pull the 4 guards, but the enchanter cant mezz them and we are wiped out.  oh well, me learned from that hehe.<P>------------------<BR>Corynthia-Dominion of Unity<BR>50 proof dwarven cleric<BR>Bristlebane</FONT></TD></TR></TABLE>
