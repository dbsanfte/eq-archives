Same as Chardock, and to get the really good exp spots, you really kinda need 2 groups.<P>Kael and Thurgadin are out, I want the factions that I have.</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#f7f7f7"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">KamuelaTZ</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">The Hole, see Chardok/Velks/SS<P>HS is very good as well, see Chardok etc.<P>Chardok is far more convenient then people think, so you could hang around KC and build a group to hop over to Chardok.<P>There just aren't many places you can hang around LFG at 55+ other then Lguk of Kunark.<P>DN is another option with the same problems. IMO the best thing to do that no one ever seems to get off their butt for is to schedule xp groups. One guilds raid is anothers xp camp. Use a message board and schedule xp groups at different locations for a week and rotate. Example: Get a cleric, melee class, and slower scheduled to log in at 6pm PST for xp in DN for a week. Once people get used to it and know you are there it gets a lot easier.<P>------------------<BR>Teir' Dal Vicar<BR>Tallon Zek</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#dedfdf"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Nige Willowleaf</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">I believe that you can get rocking experience in D1 or D2 in Seb, Chardok Chardok Chardok<P>and HS is great too. HS nice because it's undead so you can take a sort of different type group if needed. Necroes rule there.<P>But for my money Chardok can be constant pulls and good experience ratio - pretty easy to zone out even from upper tunnel where I like to take a group, and decent cash loots. Occasional item   <IMG SRC="http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/smile.gif"><P>Oh I forgot VL in the pit - pull dogs non-stop. It's pretty fast and easy to get to.

Accept it.<P>The best xp I have seen is in HS and Velk's, but both require a very good group (58+ to do good in Velk's), and you will never get a pickup group in either.  And I mean never.<P>Otherwise, your choices are KC, Seb, Velk's, DN, WW, PoG, SolB, Fear, Hate, and the Hole.  Did I miss any?</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#dedfdf"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Jubal</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Heh on my server Seb is also BYOG. I can't imagine what OS must be like with lguk-style mix-n-match groups. Though I guess if it's camped to the brim it isn't too tough to run down to a camp when there are no mobs there.<P>Chardok is probably at its best at 55. It really sucks at lower 50s because the mobs are too tough and you can't kill them fast enough. It's not too great at 58+ because you can do other things that are much better xp. But it's solid and rarely crowded.<P>If you have a really good group you can go deep in the Hole and try that, there are some excellent xp camps there and then ZEM is the best in the game.<P>Velk's Lab, kobold village or the pit with a very strong (avg. 57+) group will be terrific xp but it's not for the weak of heart (or for weak groups).<P>If your group is uber you can do DN, very interesting and fun zone, but you and everyone else had better play your best. Good place to try out Upheaval too =)<P>HS, south wing, is of course the best of all the options but only one group can do that place at a time.<P>If you don't mind the old world, the EL camp is good experience at your level and very easy, plus the GEB drops are nice loot to have. King area in Lguk should be all or mostly blue to you as well, was farming crowns with a 54 necro there and he got good xp in a group of 3 (60 cleric, 57 sk, 54 nec) with pretty much zero risk (I was meleeing).<P>One nice little secret xp spot that I'll share with ya that you'll never ever find camped - the bear pits in Permafrost keep. Clear out the giants for the xp then drop down into the bear pits. Bears, giant spiders, 'giant' wolves, all have zero MR and all will be low-mid blues to you with a nice spawn rate and plenty extra to fetch if you can handle it. Enchanter got literally zero mez resists, without tash. It's fun and different too, and good xp, though the loot is nothing great. And if your group is all 53+ you have an easy exit walking into Vox's lair and getting banished out of zone =)<P>BYOG is definitely the order of the day though. On Torv the highest level pickup dungeon is KC and sensible players avoid it like the plague. It's easy to create a group if you can find a good enchanter or bard, just search the lfg lists for players of appropriate class and level if you can't find enough in your guild and on your friends list.</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#f7f7f7"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Mirriana_00</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Seb was incredibly nice on Fennin about six months ago.  It had enough of a barrier of entry (Keys and out of the way) that only good people got into it and stayed there.  Anyone who was a gimp quickly get a black mark and didn't stay long.<P>Not it's a little different.  60+ is about standard a night from what I have seen.  Been there a few times where there are 86 people in the zone, with at least 10 sitting LFG without an enchanter, not that any camps were empty.  There are just so many high level players now, with not many places to LFG.  Most of those nights there were three clerics LFG when I zoned in.  Apparently they were the PL class of the month for a while.</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#dedfdf"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Dikmer</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Last time I went to Sebilis (about a month ago), I zoned in, saw 93 people in the zone, with EIGHT clerics LFG. I /ooc "good god, am I in LGuk??", then left. I ran back to FV, got a port to Velious and lived there for awhile, doing quests and working factions. <P>That was the last EXP grind I did for a whole month. I managed to ding 55 from exp from quests, exp from raids (yes, sometimes you get some  <IMG SRC="http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/smile.gif"> ), and exp from screwing around in GD killing high green and low blue shardwurms.<P>I am hoping my guild likes Chardock (raiding it tomorrow) enough to start doing it on a regular basis. Otherwise, I will start looking for people willing to do Velks Lab or Skyshrine regularly.</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#f7f7f7"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">electrae</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Because so many good dungeons make pickup groups impossible this is where a big network of good friends is indispensible.  Or this is where getting together with a group for a weekly exp night grind is great.  I have a group of 6 that we meet every Thursday night at a particular time for an exp group.  We even exchanged email addresss so we could coordinate our group outside the game.<P>Plus, during the rest of the week I usually have a few friends I can count on to round up on fairly short notice to go to HS, Sebilis, Hole or somewhere else for exp.<P>For convienence, you can't beat the Hole.  It's close to a teleport location.  But you do have to byog.  Granted the decore is a little dreary, but the exp is great!</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#dedfdf"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Panteroo</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">FYI Dikmer...<P>Skyshrine is very easy to break into with one group of 50+ people...<P>2 tanks<BR>1 cleric<BR>1 druid<BR>1 ench<BR>1 *filler* class (i prefer necro/mag or another tank)<P>very easy to get past first 2 rooms with harmony pulling... fight your way up to "the bridge" and camp there.

Just make sure to get singles unless your chanter likes to charm - mine got so bored he pulled another for charm quite often.<P>Kobold Village in Velk - superb exp and very easy. Must have a chanter or shaman though. Last time I was here with a 55 war, 55 rogue, 55 ranger, 58 ranger and 60 chanter and I will pulling with MoK to keep the 4 melee in constant supply. Getting there using invis is trivial so you dont need evac - you do, however, need slow and a 55+ warrior is much preferable.<P>Both SS and VL Village are definitely much easier than DN and the VL exp in particular is great and the loot in terms of quest gems and twink gear isnt that bad either.<P>Mikar<BR>High Priest of Brell<BR>The Companions<BR>The Tribunal</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#dedfdf"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">JanSorensen</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">double post, sigh.<p>[This message has been edited by JanSorensen (edited 06-11-2001).]</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#f7f7f7"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Cosmos7777</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Hand room in Karnor's is still pretty good experience at level 55, and a so-so chance at a pickup group there.  Also, the Cappy room in KC will have a high percentage of blues at 55, and the xp pace is quite good in both locations with a middle-50s group.  <P>Volume is everything.  You will need like 1200 blues to get out of 55, so a fast pulling place like Cappy is what you need.  (Howling Stones can be good experience and constant pulls, but the monsters are much more dangerous there, and you will probably blow a lot of cash symboling the party.  Wipeouts can happen in HS, and there's simply no zone line. Cappy can be done easily without Marzin, and the zone is pretty close by in the unlikely event that things get out of hand.)<P>You can use Exile Undead to knock down blues in Burning Woods on your own -- tattering apes and the skeletons that wander near the Skyfire zone -- but it will take most of your mana and there will be lots of downtime, unless you can bum clarity off of a nearby party.  I tried it and wrote it off as boring and slow.  I did notice that each blue gave me perhaps a half-percent xp gain, which is wildly out of control for 55. If you can get a couple of wizard friends and an enchanter to powerlevel you for a few days with extra nuking/snare/clarity, you can atone the mobs to take the kills and get through 55 more efficiently.</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#dedfdf"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Dalur - Veeshan</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Or better yet get a ranger and a warrior to come group with you in BW.<P>Most of the hornets will be blue as well as most of the skelies.<P>75% of the wurms will be blue and aren't too tough to kill.<P>The "ancient" giants will be blue as will the named one - gorgal? poc something.<P>A few sarnaks will be blue also.<P>I was grouped with a ranger and a warrior while we were waiting to pull Ixiblat and we killed a few skelies and a couple wurms and a clouple sarnaks that were blue at 59.<P>If you want to do a little soloing, the hornets are pretty easy to solo.
