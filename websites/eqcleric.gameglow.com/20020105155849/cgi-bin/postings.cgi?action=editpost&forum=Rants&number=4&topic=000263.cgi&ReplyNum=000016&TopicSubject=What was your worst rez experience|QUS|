<TEXTAREA NAME="EditedMessage" ROWS=10 COLS=45 WRAP="VIRTUAL">My worst and also my best res experience was in hate.

I dont know why but I always make my break in, I have never once in all my 53 levels failed to make it to SS. Anyway my guild did its first solo hate raid way back in the mists of time, and I did break in and got to SS. However bar one feigned monk I was the only player to actually make it to SS. Shortly after the monk died too. So it was me alone, and being a poor guild back then we had very few hate stones. So I decided to do some CR myself  :)After dragging several corpses to SS and preparing to res, someone logged from another guild logged in and trained me and my recently res'ed bard.

Splat. Dead, so now its naked break in to hate, nothing but a summoned hammer and 10copper on me, *zoop* last hate stone gone, tension is very very high ;D Once more I was the only one to make it and began the task of recovering more corpses and ressing. I got trained again but luckily I had ressed enough to handle it and we made it. The ressing some 25 corpses really sucked, but the buzz of doing the intitial lone CR in a fully stacked hate, with no FD or even invis was intense.

Another bad one was someone who asked me to run from WC to CT to res him. Now I find it hard to say no to ppl, and after 5 minutes of me saying I couldnt really do it, I buckled to the harrassment and my cleric nature took over. I almost never charge for ressing. However I like ppl to offer (so I can say no anyway). If however I run many zones I will never turn down a donation.

So Im offered 100pp which I feel is more a token payment as I say its not the money its the principal of the thing.

I run to CT, no sow or jboots, took me about 20 or 30 mins if I remember right and when I arrive it turns out they need a CR too. So I CR their corpses from the underground part solo, place with all the walk ways, and res not 1 but 3 of them, by now my time is getting well over an hour wasted. They all say how great I am etc, but once ressed they just went silent and all 3 of them logged, not even 1cp offered. I was quite peturbed that someone could be so dishonest and abuse someones kind nature like that, promising donations but making non. 

However I wasnt that kind, they conned the wrong guy, being a guildleader I could ensure they never got a res from my guild ever again  ;)and a few of our alliances heard about them too  ;) What goes around comes around......

Muahahaha
