[B]MoR is great if no one is slowing the mob.


MoK as a casted spell is generaly useless because its not worth the mana, especialy if resisted. How ever when casted from the BP, its nice. it gives a slightly noticeable heal effect and anything that gives me a second or more to land that CH is fine with me. ive pulled alot of heals down to the last HP and can pretty much say if I didnt have MoK on the mob, the tank would be dead.

In a similar way to any regeneration spell.  It has similar disadvantages to regen spells, as in it will heal regardless of whether or not they need healing.<P>It however does not heal everyone in the party, only melee members, and it can also be resisted.  It also has to be cast on every mob, which takes up valuable time.<P>So lets look at the figures compared to the two popular group regen spells in the end game.  It is slightly lower level but I think relatively comparable.  Note that for clerics and druids, both are provided on velious bp so comparison purposes ill use the cost in mana of the spell.<P>Regrowth of the grove heals 15hps a tick for 15 mins for a total of 2250 hps.  It applies this to all party members for a total of 13500 hps healed every quarter of an hour.  It does this for 600 mana for a 22.5:1 hp to mana ratio.<P>Mark of Karn costs 125 mana so on that ratio, it would heal a total of 2812.5 hps.<P>Now I will confess to not knowing the exact break down of how mark of karn heals, whether or not the delay of the weapon is taken unslowed or slowed, but lets for the sake of arguement assign a reasonable figure of 6 hps healed ever 2 seconds, per main hand hit.<P>With this taken into account, using 2 mainhand swings per round (above average), it would heal 360 hps per minute per attacker.  Given the total duration of mok is 3.5 mins, you would have to have 2.2 tanks attacking the mob for its entire duration in order for it to rival the healing power of regrowth of the grove.<P>If this was a situation (and forgetting damage distribution - this affects regen spells just as much), it would be useful to cast it, since frankly put 22:1 healing ratio, even incredibly slowly is absolutely amazing.<P>This is not the situation however.  As you get higher the damage capabilities of players goes up, and whilst hps of mobs go up, they don't to this extent.<P>Warrior lizards for example in CT have around 15k hps. With just one high quality warrior only attacking, its quiet possible that it would die within 3.5 minutes.  And warriors have much more hps than the average critter.  Raptors for example last less than a minute, absolutely destroying the spell.<P>And this is a zone where everything is mean and difficult.<P>Translate it into a zone where its much easier and mobs easily last less than a minute and it becomes practically worthless, other than for a secondary ability to dispell damage shields, something that the spell dispell can do much better.<P>In order for it to be effective, either the healing rate of the spell has to raise considerable, scaling to the damage the critter is recieving, not the delay of the weapons, or it becomes a buff cast upon players.  If it was cast on the player and not on the mob, efficency would be much less of an issue, resists wouldn't be a problem, and it would take less of the clerics time.<P>Lets look at mor.  I'll be the first to say that mor is not nearly as bad as mok in usefulness, in solo tanking situations it is very useful, but in groups it is practically worthless.  Calculation of damage put it that in order for it to stack against judgement, the critter must hit someone 21.5 times.  <P>Firstly, resist rates of mor are relatively high.  Judgement rarely ever gets resisted, its a shock if it happens, i am used to seeing it always hit for 925 (unfocused, and lets not even get into focus items affecting effecency).  Secondly agro.  In order for mor to be efficent, I have to throw it early, otherwise it makes it even less useful.  This either causes agro, and potencial healing, or the inability to sit for a few ticks which reduces efficency even more.  Judgement however can be cast anytime after the tank has established agro and you can sit immediately after.<P>The mob also has to hit the tank.  Again the life span of said mob is in question, the quicker it is killed, the less it will hit the tank.  Combine slow, quick kill rate and a good tank who rarely gets hit and it has been shown even in small 3 man groups, not to be efficent.<P>What to do?<P>Personelly, I think a vast majority of the clerics lack of damage adding capability can be solved with fixing this single simple spell.  Rather than fix it so that it was in line with our nukes, it should be made much more powerful (but not too powerful), so that when in a group where healing is less useful, it is the spell to cast.<P>What would be good, is rather than giving a reverse damage shield, is if it caused a damage amplify on the said mob.<P>If it amplified damage by a mere 10%, lets look at some numbers.  On a mob with 10k hps it would have the effect of hitting for 910 damage.  For 115 mana, thats insanely efficent.<P>On a lower level mob with say 5k hps, it would do around 450 ish, less useful but still efficent.  So when you got the spell it would be useful, and it would grow as you gained levels and attacked harder things.<P>In order to curb the usefulness of the spell, it shouldn't be able to land on any mob with more than 32k hps.<P>Also it is not like a dot, it can only be cast once, and then you have to use other spells to get the benifit, so you would only get the 9:1 ratio once per mob, limiting its exploitability.<P>I'm trying to think about it, and see how unbalanced this would be, and I think it would really help up the damage groups can do with a cleric, without actually improving clerics damage dealing capabilities substancially.<P>What do people think? <BR><p>[This message has been edited by Aldur (edited 05-02-2002).]</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#f7f7f7"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Kessina</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">I think it is a matter of perspective.  You are right that MoK is pretty useless as a regen.  But I tend see MoK as a DS counter instead and it works wonderfully.  If I use MoK is DS situations, its efficiency goes up much higher since the tank is taking much less damage, I have to heal less, and I can med uninterrupted.<P>I look at MoR in similar manner.  It is fairly useless against blue mobs but for blood red boss mobs that hit fast and often, especially if they rampage, MoR is another layer that improve the fight.<P>I think MoK and MoR were intended to be used in specific situations, not as a general purpose regen or ds.  That's why they can't compete with those from other classes.  But when used correctly, no other class can do the equivalent.<P>Just my 2 cents.<P>------------------<BR>Kessina Terok - 56 Templar of Tunare - The Hand - Xev Server</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#dedfdf"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">menleniel2</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">I've never found aggro from mor to be problem, seem rare that it get aggro.

On stuff where you really do need to strip it, like certain drakes in tov, you can't land it regardless of debuffs.<P>At level 56, how many red mobs are you fighting for exp?  Even non uber raid mobs don't really benifit from mok, other than stripping the damage shield simply because damage is never distributed evenly, a few tanks will get hit and that is it, and it is almost guaranteed to give less hps back than regrowth of the grove, yet that has no resistance, and guaranteed results.<P>menleniel2 I think what you are mentioning is the effects of slow, not mok.  You slow a mob in akheva and you don't need to heal period.  <P>Mok is a placebo effect, you think it is doing something useful but its not.  And the same is true for mok on a reasonable amount of mobs.  Remember in many situations cleric spell slots are limited, having mor available for the odd critter is applicable for is far less useful than simply hitting them with judgement for more damage.<P>mor can have applicable situations at present, but they dwindle considerably as you gain in levels.  I still have not found a useful non ds stripping encounter where mok can be noticed it being on or off.<P>Look at it this way, I can either take 9 seconds of my time casting mok for limited effect (forgetting resists), or 12 seconds of my time for a guaranteed 105 group heal.  I think there is no dispute which is more useful.</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#dedfdf"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">JanSorensen</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">MoK and MoR just scale badly as people get better gear.<P>Judgement - without or without focus items - is almost always a better choice than MoR for a number of reasons.<BR>- You dont have to cast it early in the fight (if you cast MoR way early you wont be sitting down right away).<BR>- You can "stack" several nukes on the same mob (while you cannot MoR the mob twice)<BR>- It simply does more dmg/time standing.<P>MoR has its uses, yes, but they are few and far between except for unslowable raid level mobs.<P>MoK I never mem - but sometimes I click my BP when bored if I cannot sit due to aggro anyway.

Even with full debuffs, you will never, even partially land a magic based spell on them.<P>MOK:  MOK is used where fights will go long, and to help the other melees heal a bit since your concentrating on the MT.  Examples of this are ToV raids, Larger mobs in Keal, and other rare spawns that are serious undercons for thier level. Its also good to pop ONLY damage shields, as dispell takes off all buffs (including debuffs) while trying to get damage shields.<P>MOR: MOR is pretty awesome, when you can land it.  Obviously its not for EXP groups, as you should be sluaghtering the lowest level solid blue you can find, so as to get your kills per minute very high. <P>the value, and difficulty of both of these spells is simple.. we are NOT classes that do damage shields.  that we have them in any form is sort of a anomily.  I would rather see mages and druids getting these veriants than us.  But, since we do have them, they come with a price.  That price is quite high:  bad mana to effect ratio, difficulty landing the spell, and single target use. <P>The upsides are simple awesome:  they stack with all other forms of shielding, including each other!  Mobs that rampage and flurry, make MOR a breeze to pay for itself, even when the mob is extremely low on health, and MOK is a breeze any time you have more than two tanks attacking.  At level 56, i dont have judgement, so these spells pay for themselves much faster.  At 125 mana, and then im back to medding, MOK slows damage enough in my normal group (war, rog, mage pet) that i typicly only have to heal the tank, and even then im down to just CHing. (my rog and tank both have 18 delay primary hand items, and have haste items and haste on them)<P>These are both situational only spells. Properly used though, they are extremely powerful.  TOV-HOT is the perfect place, I have had MOR hit more than 60 times, and MOK over a raid that is getting AOEed is awesome.  assuming haste and everything else reduces the healing to only 3 per swing, thats an average of +8 healing per tick times the 20 melees present, you have 160 PER TICK regen coming off a 125 mana spell.<P>add to this that it makes us fairly good self contained powerlevelers, and they are really nice spells.</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#f7f7f7"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Kessina</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Sorry for the late reply Aldur, haven't been reading much lately.<P>I'll have to disagree with this:<P>"...if you wanted to strip the damage shield component, any caster can do that just as well..."<P>With all the tash, malo, or what not landed, no other class can strip DS and only DS, that's where MoK shines.

Defensive doesn't slow the attacker, so he's hitting as often, taking less damage and getting a small amount of healing while doing so.<P><p>[This message has been edited by Belhaven (edited 05-10-2002).]</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#f7f7f7"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Cilene</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">MoK is a spell primarely used for pwrlvling, but always cast it on mobs, ive had a group in seb, with no war n no shaman, in group was bard ench cleric wiz n rogue with mor running i healed twice in the 2 hours i was in that group, n no we werent stunning  <IMG SRC="http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/smile.gif"> yeah i know seb frogs are week.<P>MoR is the best raid spell we get, other then ch and aego. with rampaging n flurrying mobss, that dam it gives fast goes up to alot in the end, like a AoW fight, think our last atempt toke 10min, was our first atempt, just think how many times AoW hits in 10mins, *15 = alot of dam</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#dedfdf"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Luminar</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">MoR is great if no one is slowing the mob.<P><BR>MoK as a casted spell is generaly useless because its not worth the mana, especialy if resisted. How ever when casted from the BP, its nice. it gives a slightly noticeable heal effect and anything that gives me a second or more to land that CH is fine with me. ive pulled alot of heals down to the last HP and can pretty much say if I didnt have MoK on the mob, the tank would be dead.<BR><P>------------------<BR>---<P><A HREF="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=32524" TARGET=_blank>Magelo Profile</A></FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#f7f7f7"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Aldur</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Lum, you are saying that the 15 hps regened via mok made a difference in your CH?<P>Remembering that Mok from the bp takes 9 seconds if it lands on the first try.  If you had just clicked your legs instead of moking, the critter would have to survive for 80 seconds before mok would heal that much.<P>And remeber its been worked out - clicking the legs is less efficent than sitting on your backside if you heal less than 3 people with it. So unless you get the equivalent of healing 200 hps overall, efficency wise - mok is less efficent than sitting down and using a heal spell - and this is the version which costs zero mana to cast.<P></FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#dedfdf"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Anika Tinyhealer</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial"> <BLOCKQUOTE><font size="1" face="Verdana, Arial">quote:</font><HR>it would heal 360 hps per minute per attacker<HR></BLOCKQUOTE><BR>So using your numbers, on a typical raid encounter, let's say I cast MoK.

Dang useful in that enviroment though, it's great on long fights and with flurrys.<P></FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#f7f7f7"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">garon</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">I think you overlook Variety.  <IMG SRC="http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/smile.gif"> I team with a Mage, Bard, Warrior, Rogue, and Wizard.. almost every time.  Bard+Mage+Cleric DS all stack. its nifty to see mobs beat themselves to death. <P>As a cleric i cast it because its low mana. Esp on giants where i need the faction. My dmg added is nil, but I am one of those odd clerics who believes in saving mana for heals..(deaths are bad for exp/hour .. *grin*) and leave dmg up to those who are better at it. <P>I am looking forward to MoK - with 3 melee'rs, all with fast weapons, and bard epic rocking us up to 90+ haste on avarage.. they hit alot.. i expect it to help the healing  <IMG SRC="http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/smile.gif"></FONT></TD></TR></TABLE>
