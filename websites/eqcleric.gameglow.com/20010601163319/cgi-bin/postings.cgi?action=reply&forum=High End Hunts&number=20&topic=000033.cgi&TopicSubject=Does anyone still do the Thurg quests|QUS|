Anyway, was wondering if someone knew much about hunting in Kael Drak for quest armor.<P>This weekend we spent a fair amount of time in there.  Friday night we went into the Arena and pulled mobs in there and the three protectors.  Got a few idols for the wussy Clerics (read High Elven) and some of the giant armor (the mid teens stuff, not the crap).  We got three blanks that night, but all were from mobs outside the arena that we killed on the way in.  Forget which, but not greaves or BP.<P>Saturday we stayed outside the arena and kept the floor clear, got more idols (only need one more to complete a quest), and three more drops.  Again, nothing decent (gaunts, silk gloves, silk boots).<P>Sunday we went towards Tormax's area, killed some of the bigger mobs (dude that dropped the maelstrom cloak, he was 62), some 66 sentinels, but when someone tagged a mob a bit deeper instead of the expected single got 4 or 5.  Called it a night after CR.  Got a chain helm tonight.<P>What I'm wondering is where in the hell does the better stuff drop?  Or are we basically in the right spot and everything is just rare?  I'm hoping that there's maybe an area to hunt with higher density of drops because those areas are rapidly getting boring (clearing the area around the arena for hours at a time is not much fun).<P>Any info would be greatly appreciate.<P>Rayne<P>** Corrected late night spelling **<p>[This message has been edited by Rayne (edited 03-26-2001).]</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#f7f7f7"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Khaidu Ilkhanate</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">If its like ToV all the good pieces are just really really rare  <IMG SRC="http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/frown.gif"><P><P>------------------<BR>Khaidu Ilkhanate<BR>Templar of Talisman<BR>www.norrath.org</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#dedfdf"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Skrimgeour Kuchenhyrst</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Rayne,<P>The Haven of Karana (and the AoVB) hit Kael a lot for the Thurgardin armor. Basicaly, your best bet for it to drop is killing Veterans. (Was a poor drop rate the last time - saw few vets, but one had plate legs - won by a bard - and leather wrist).<P>Head to the arena, and bear left - we usually set up our first camp by Kallis and go from there.<P>Skrimgeour</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#f7f7f7"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Norin Grimsbane</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">When a Vet drops armor, I've never seen it drop less than 2 pieces (once even 3).<P>Course, usually they just don't drop armor.<P>We got the following clearing outside the arena with about 12 people for 4-5 hours (including a wipeout due to the server burp that happened last night -- Sunday March 25th around 9-10pm est).  This was from the area up the ramp near Kallis/Zeks.  Half the loot came from Vets alone:<P>2 Silk Boots<BR>2 Silk Wristbands<BR>1 Silk Gloves<BR>1 Leather Gloves<BR>1 Leather Boots<BR>1 Chain Bracer<BR>1 Plate Arms<P>We did get a Chain BP from this same spot last weekend, however.   We've done fighting outside arena with one group (never took anything higher than Vets, ie no Kallis or Zeks).  Just to confirm Rayne, I really think the BP and Legs are just freaking rare.<P>------------------<BR><B>Norin Grimsbane</B><BR>lv 57 Dwarf Templar<BR>Officer of <B>Shining Path</B></FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#dedfdf"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Islington</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">When my Guild goes to Kael, we head up several ramps that lead to the arena.  We set up camp against the back wall.  Looking straight ahead the Arena will be to your right and further back and to the left is a large Temple looking building.  From this spot you should be able to see the Protectors of Zek on your left and kind of in front of the Temple looking structure.<P>From this spot you can pull a steady stream of giants fairly easily.  Just have the tanks surround the giant so they don't push the Giant towards another one.<P>I've seen Corroded drop off of Adjutants and up with the most common drops being off of Veterans (though it's still rare as heck).  On our last run through Kael we picked up:<P>1 Plate Boots (which I won and now my Paladin has some sweet new Boots).<BR>1 Plate BP (One of our Clerics won this)<BR>2 Chain Bracers<BR>1 Silk Gloves<P>A few other pieces dropped as well but I can't remember what.  We seem to average 3 or 4 pieces of armor in an hour but our Monk is a pulling machine and doesn't give us a chance to let up  <IMG SRC="http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/smile.gif"><P>This seems to be the best spot to me since it's clean of roamers and very easy to hold.  CR is a pain though as you need to go through several giants that See Invis so a Monk helping with CR is great.<P>One last thing, Adjutants are Clerics and LOVE to Complete Heal.  Bring a few Enchanters along to Sieve them or you will have a long and drawn out fight since they cannot be mezzed or stunned.</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#f7f7f7"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Siren</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">All pieces (including BP and Leg) drop off the giants in and right outside Tormax lair.<P></FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#dedfdf"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Dalain</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">I got my legs off the giants in the arena area.

This included killing Vealok the Angry and (mumble) the Cold, who drop the gladiator armour.  (Which so far seems excellent for druids & rogues, and pretty good for clerics who have enough WIS already - Gladiator Leggings have replaced my EM greaves).<P>Not being a wussy high elf (grin), I haven't looked into the PoG bracer quest - so I'm not sure which giants need to be killed for that.<P>We didn't see any corroded/eroded/etc. drops in the Arena itself - as people have pointed out, Veterans/Troopers/Adjutants appear to be the best source.  Not consistent though - one night we had 3 or 4 drops in an hours, another night we saw nothing at all.<P>I've heard rumours that the arena spectators can drop corroded etc. but I haven't seen anything drop from them yet - anyone confirm or deny this rumour?<P><BR>------------------<BR>Morrun Catspaw<BR>55th level Templar of Bristlebane<BR>Albion - Death Before Dishonour!<BR>Cazic-Thule Server<p>[This message has been edited by Morrun (edited 03-27-2001).]</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#f7f7f7"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">JanSorensen</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">There seems to be some confusion as to what constitutes the arena in Kael.<P>There is a small pvp area with Arena Spectators - and a larger plateau with Kallis, Vets, etc.<P>Either place can be done with a single good group - drops from the Arena Spectators/Vkjor is limited to the Bracelet of the Swirling Smoke (9ac 2wis 20mana 25hp 5fr nodrop) a great druid item as far as I can tell while the Vets and others can drop corroded.</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#dedfdf"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Caleal</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Saturday my guild cleared out the entire arena area and all around Vindicator, including his guards. We failed 2 attempts on Vindicator, but thats a different story. We got many many drops of torn silk, corroded chain and the leather pieces, including silk and leather chests, 0 plate drops though.<P>After getting bord with the area, we moved to clear Tormax's area. Pulling the nameds around Tormax is fun, one of them is a shamen that buffs and SoWs everything. It was a hard day on monk pullers, generally things from around Tormax liked to come in 3s, had SoW, some even flurry and rampage. One pull we had a MOB that hit for 490, flurried and rampaged, another that hit for over 300 and flurried and rampaged, and another that just hit for 235 and rampaged. After a fairly long fight with moderate deaths, me included, we took them out though, heh. <BR>I cast a DL on a group member and started a CH on another, giant came over and executed 2 flurries on me while casting, some of the hits were for 490, mostly misses though. I regained concentration and landed the CH, then got kicked for 49 damage and died.  =)<P>By the time we were done, we had cleared all the named MOBs from around Tormax, killed a lot of respawn, split Tormax's guards off him and had him standing alone in his area ready to die. To bad we were not ready to kill him. =/<P>Drops from around Tormax's area were a lot of torn silk, corroded chain, 2 corroded plate gauntlets and one plate boots. We got several bows of the huntsman for our rangers, a nice 12/22 1hs +7 ac axe with a decent procc and some other minor items. The guy that drops the orb of infinate void was already killed by one of the +giant faction guilds on the server, bastards. =/<P>In a full day of killing everything but Vindicator and Tormax, we had around 60 quest armor drops, only 3 of them were plate, and they were minor pieces at that. I'm currently of the opinion that its a waste of gems to do the thurgaden armor quests, and a waste of effort to get the quest armor blanks. With the same raiding force and time spent, we could have been clearing out the testing halls in ToV for the good stuff.<P>------------------<BR>Caleal P`Terak<BR>BATTLE CLERIC of Innoruuk<BR>Cazic-Thule server<BR>Officer, Shadowed Soul</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#f7f7f7"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Finnien</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Okay, there are a few decent drops in the arena, but they're rare.  One is a rare sword off the protectors of zek (you can see them wielding it) called a Defiance.  9/19, str +6 dex +8 ac 10.  The 10 ac on a 1hs is nice.<BR>The circlet of tallon/vallon is a sweet monk head piece that drops off the prophets occasionally.<BR>The rare idol (from our experience, and that's quite a bit) is the Idol of Decay.  Get that one, and it's easy to get the cleric bracer.<BR>And Kalis Stormcaller and his two buddies drop 3 of the 4 pieces for the ranger Tunare quest helm.<BR>As for Stormslayer, the guy who drops the Cloak of the Maelstrom, his rare drop is Frostbringer (12/22, AC 7, effect: Frostbite (small DD with 15 ac reduction of target)).  He is also the placeholder for a mob that drops the Mask of War, which is a great cleric/pally mask.<BR>One of the mobs next to Tormax drops Coldain Skin Gloves.  We don't know yet if he has a rare drop, the Gloves are either his only or his common drop.<BR>If you pull his guards, you can squeeze by Tormax on the right and get back to clear the questgivers.  First, they were green to most of my guild.  Second, they both gave positive Yelinak and Dain faction hits.  There are also several named back there, and we got an ultravision monk mask slightly better than a mempo, but nothing extraordinary.  However, we were only back there for 2 hours, so it wasn't long enough to really say what can drop back there.

My guild is mostly low-50's, and we usually hunt in a building that's kind of to the right and behind the arena, from the bridge leading in to the area.<P>Last night we got a very nice hybrid belt, AC 10, +5 wis, some stamina, and a haste effect.  I can't remember the name now.<P>Note that worshippers of Rallos Zek are non-KOS in Kael, even in the arena area.
