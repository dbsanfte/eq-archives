<TEXTAREA NAME="ReplyMessage" ROWS=10 COLS=45 WRAP="VIRTUAL">[QUOTE]Originally posted by ShelseaDruid:
[B]Word of Redemption Rocks  I have used it since I bought (ouch 25K) in all kinds of situations.  HoT, NToV, the Castle in Velks for Xp.  Anywhere, I have a really heavy tank group.  

The other night in the castle, I had a monk, paladin, and warrior taking massive damage.  They were all getting low - if I chealed one the other would most definitely bite it.  So I cast WoR - everyone is full up (though I had a necro feeding me - I was at 10m at the end of the fight).

I trust my tanks to keep the aggro.  I have only had to DA once when I used this spell.  Root is always up and even with chanter down (which he died and took a lot of my mana with him) we made it through that fight.

Where do you use Word of Redemption?  And how do you deal with the resulting aggro?<P>Let me expand a little.  Word of Redemption costs 1100 mana to CH the entire group.  As such, one can cast almost 3 complete heals, for 4 celestial elixirs, for the same mana cost.<P>In most situations I can think of, and have faced, the 4 celestial elixirs is a much better idea.  Despite the fact that, on the face, they don't seem to be better (longer time to cast, more mana, less potential healing, healing takes much longer, etc), I've found that in many fights, CE handles AoE or well spread-out damage better, and generates significantly less aggro.<P>As an example, I stand in the halls of testing in ToV, and have a group of tanks.  We're fighting some random level 62 aoe mob, and I don't have the main tank in my group (i.e. I'm not having to keep up with melee damage in my group).  I've tried both of the following tactics:<P>Cel Elixir people as they drop to about half life, or wait till the group is at roughly 50% health all around and WoRedemption.<P>In the second case, I am without exception summoned, and take at least one or two swipes.  I'm never summoned with CE.  Which amounts to I have to spend mana healing myself, and so I don't even gain significant mana savings from WoR.<P>I had a similar experience fighting Terror in Fear, and The Spiroc Lord in PoA(PoS).<P>The only way I've found to effectively deal with the aggro is to immediately DA or DB after casting Word of Redemption.  And well...<P>Your spell has been interrupted!<BR>The Spiroc Lord shouts, '' (Damn buggy death touches)<BR>You have taken 20000 points of damage!<BR>You have been slain by The Spiroc Lord.<P>------------------<BR>Suuloti<BR>Cleric of Innoruuk; High Priest of Hatred<BR>Fennin Ro<p>[This message has been edited by Suuloti (edited 04-20-2002).]</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#f7f7f7"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Aldur</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">I find that I am rarely if ever summoned when I use this spell, there are exceptions but it is almost entirely down to the mob type, zlandicar for example will crunch you for a normal CH so ya might as well make use of the only spell ya might get off and make it a big one.<P>In Halls of testing redemption is simply put amazing.  However the trick to using it effectively is understanding that steady damage from for example lure ae damage (keeper, dozer) is much easier to judge than the resistable but much more random ae of the normal mob.  Ae heals typically have a ratio of less than one, hence why the big upset about the ratio on the paladin group heal, but forgetting that its safe to say in order for redemption to be as effecient as other group heal spells you need to heal 1.1k hps.  If you looked at the figures its actually less than 1k but 1.1k is close enough.<P>Now your general plate tank doing hot will have at least 5k hps, with support melee (rangers rogues monks) will have at least 4k hps.  This is the bare minimum these classes should have at this level with the buffs provided.  Cleric HP's are not so important because you can sit behind a wall an avoid the ae, but even so a cleric should have between 3.5 and 5k hps at this level so in terms of balanced hps we certainly hold our own.<P>So the typical player will need 20-30% hps healed in order for redemption to be as efficent as other group heals.  Compare the ratio of a 1:1 group heal is infact the same as 6:1 single target - hence already 50% more efficent than a non spell casting reinforcement cleric casting the spell. CH is a funny spell, because it heals so much people believe you have to push it to the limit, but really you don't.  20-30% hps and the spell is guaranteed to be the most efficent in the game.  <P>Tricks to remember is not to push it too far.  If one or more people drop below 40% hps, there is a risk (its not a guaranteed thing if they have not agro'd) of summon, so you should be looking at starting the group CH at around 50-60%, and its practically guaranteed to give mind boggling efficent results.  Healing 2.5k of 6 people is 15k healing for 1.1k mana, or in other words 13.6:1 healing ratio.  Which is the same as a 5440 hp CH on everyone in the entire group. It's alot easier getting that type of healing ratio with redemption and keeping it safe whereas a 5.5k heal on a tank is probably 1 melee round from death for all but the most uber 6.5k+ tanks around.<P>One thing to be aware of, word of redemption due to its efficency constraint on the player rather than on the spell, is not best used for MT on a HoT raid, because the increased damage on the MT will cause either less efficency with redemption or a possible conflict of interest between keeping the MT alive and making sure the rest of the group is above the critical 40% marker.  It can be done, but its stressful ill give you that, and its still more efficent than using other group heals or using CE.<P>Make sure to announce your redemption cast.  And make it players responsibilities to understand what it means.  Pick a player and tell the group you will be healing near them.  If people don't get in range with 12 seconds warning, don't heal them.  Harsh but its a lesson people need to learn.<P>Also the spiroc lord is not a good mob to mention, he is a cleric killer, primarily because making sure people are buffed = waste of time.  Farming the spiroc lord is all about doing it quickly, and in general at least one cleric will buy the farm with him, and if they are lucky they will tank long enough to die via the DT and not via melee.  Because tanks invariably don't have buffs, they need to be healed earlier and boom you get agro.  You could buff your tanks so that you didn't get agro but that takes longer than just doing it the easier but messier way.  At the end of the day, speed is more important than style.<P>So back to the original 2 questions.<BR>1.  Where do you use word of redemption.<BR>A. Anywhere that there is predicatable ae damage where there is no diconcernable difference in agro between single and groupd heals.<BR>2. How do you deal with the resulting aggro<BR>A. Well funnily enough I never realised it until that monk thread a while back, but it seems that the first thing you do puts you on the hatelist, but until then you are not on it (assuming the monk doesn't FD and put the entire raid on the hatelist).  So if you don't have a fd puller, then the first redemption is for free, and wont get you agro, and by the time you have to group heal again, you should have sufficent agro on the primary tank built up.</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#dedfdf"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Barahir Ironaxe</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Word of Redemption is THE best and most useful spell for a cleric in the highend game. Period.<P>With mobs that agro on you even if you just cast a Remedy, using a WoR, healing each single party member and sacrificing yourself in order to keep the fighting guild on the winning side is of most importance. If you are not fast enough to activate DA, that is.<P>With all other mobs, you will rarely to never agro even if you use WoR until youre oom. And consider this: In my guild, the common warrior has about 6500 HP, with rogues and rangers reaching up to 5500 HP with buffs. Imagine you will have to heal all of these with CE or CH, you wont have a chance to heal each one fully. So WoR comes in very handy, and the melees will love you for it.</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#f7f7f7"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">kegwell</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Try it with a group of 5 warriors or rogues while doing Trak.

Its only worth wenn you have two or three (or more) tanks to heal. Apparently Trak and Gore hate this spell more than some ToV mobs or Wuoshi. So I made 2 hotkeys:<P>1. /cast Word of Redemption<BR>/g Casting Complete Group heal - Watch your cleric please  <IMG SRC="http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/smile.gif"><P><BR>2. /cast Word of Redemption<BR>/g Casting Complete Group heal and DA - you have 18 sec to regain aggro.<BR>/pause 123 (still experimenting with this)<BR>/cast Divine Aura<P></FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#f7f7f7"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Aldur</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">The reason why trak and gore hate group heals is because strangely enough they often have much higher damage capabilities than velious and luclin mobs.  This of course was to balance the very limited hps that these critters had.  This means that agro control for these mobs is practically non existant because you have to heal earlier and more often and the huge agro that group heals creates is a killer.  <P>In HoT however its a brilliant spell because agro can be controlled.<P></FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#dedfdf"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Aerillea</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">This spell is great for the ae'ing lizards in CT.

You are creating a known situation - that your party will be a full health in 12 seconds from when you cast the spell.<P>In area damage situations, this makes easy keeping people alive. Personally I think it was created for Trakanon fights... just walk in cast WoR, DA, wait 6 seconds, click off DA, cast again, use DB, cast again if you need to... all the healing you need to do for a melee group for the whole fight, very easily managed compared to trying to mitigate damage on each member of the group individually.</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#f7f7f7"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">netorbesnom</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Group cheal is about my fave spell you want funn land it on your group of 5 top end melle it alll 5k+ hp with the wars wall over 6k with then all below 2bubs includign my self, cuppel of then at half a bub, thats liek 30k healed adn i rarly if ever get arg, and if you do that what DA DBA DB are for right =).<P><P>------------------<BR>Venerable Netorbesnom Spellbinder,<BR>High Priest of the Companions, The Tribunal.<BR> <A HREF="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=12138" TARGET=_blank>http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=12138</A> </FONT></TD></TR></TABLE>
