<TEXTAREA NAME="EditedMessage" ROWS=10 COLS=45 WRAP="VIRTUAL">A cleric's soloability is related to two things, and two things only:

1.  The quality of the guild he is in.
2.  The equipment he wears.

I proved this on The Seventh Hammer when I played Rathen and was soloing LDCs in Sol B, as a cleric, using Mark of Karn, Mark of Retribution, and a Poison Wind Censer.  A cleric solos effectively by having superior equipment and weaponry.  Period.  If you are attempting to solo in a druid fashion, by using root + DD, or root & DOT undead mobs, you are doing yourself a disservice.

Even at level 60, fully buffed, Rathen bordered around 1175 ac, more than enough to handle a wimpy LDC.  Had I had 34 to 41% haste to go with my PWC, to increase my chances of procing the AE poison spell, I could have soloed even faster.  I merely Celestial Elixir'ed myself to recover lost hit points from the Boiling Blood and the melee damage.  Poison resistance was buffed with my gear and Resist Poison to negate the effects of the AE poison rain.

Clerics... think... outside... the... box.  Its how you solo; its the only way to solo.

Now reconsider this... if I could add a Ring of Dain Frostweaver to my collection of items, I would have a 10 pt dmg shield stacking with my 15 pt dmg shield, for 25 pts.  I also get 10 pts regen per tick from this as well.  Let's add a fungi tunic to the equation.  Again, regeneration per tick is increased.  Let's add another damage shield by acquiring a Regal Band of Bathezid, not a difficult item to acquire at all, only time consuming.  Now you have a possibly 50 pt damage shield and 25 hp per tick regen.  This is how a cleric solos... I repeat unto you.  We solo through our equipment and our abilities.  The highest level clerics in the EQ game now have access to a right-click root ring from Vex Thal, 2.0 second casting time.  All we need now is a right-click item with Retribution or Reckoning, and you'll see clerics soloing as time passes.  "Why should I group with you and your group of melees when I can solo using my equipment and get better experience?"  Expect to see that after Planes of Power is out.  I bet you any amount of money you want to bet; it will happen.

  [QUOTE]Now, as a cleric, the most realistic way of handling this, is to group with the said druid or a wizard, to get proper escort to ToV, including invis and levitation.
[/QUOTE]

Negative.  Again, you aren't thinking outside of the box.  Acquire a ranger friend and go to South Karana and camp Quillmane.  Kill him until he drops a Pegasus Feather Cloak.  Rathen has one, so will Mananut, and so should you.

 [QUOTE]The extreme lack of utility spells for clerics is my major peeve with the class.
[/QUOTE]

Utility can be somewhat supplimented via AAXP abilities.  Run Speed 3.  Acquire it.  Love it.  Cherish it.  Don't want to waste the AAXP points?  Buy a horse, they're only 110,000 pp (and that's the only one worth wasting your money on).  Its self only, but really that's what you're saying.  You want regen and you want SOW.  Those come through items or abilities.

 [QUOTE]I can't understand why *warriors* should have several available invis items to choose from, when clerics get none.[/QUOTE]

Gnomish Vanishing Device.  Camp the items, find a Tinkerer, have him make it.  Or buy it for 15,000 to 20,000 pp.  Its worth the investment.  Buy 4 stacks of Class 5 Mana Batteries and keep a Toolbox on you at all times to recharge it.  This item is invaluable and will save your life.  Unlike poor quality spell invisiblity, GVD invis lasts for 20 minutes, solid fixed duration.

  [QUOTE]If druids become better healers, then clerics should be given improved versatility to remove the "portable bandaid" part of the class, when almost everything in the game including basic travel requires the help of others.
[/QUOTE]

This is a good point, but you fail to address how you'd like to deal with it.  The pottery idols were a step in the right direction, but I think Verant should now add more idols to port everyone.  Allow the to port to various druid or wizard teleportation places.  Make the items have recommended levels of 55 to 60.  Ideally I'd vote 60.  That way no druid can reasonably complain. Make the components expensive, but not rare.  Rarity just pisses people off.  If people realize they're going to be paying 2000 pp per component for a combine and the combine requires two to five of these components, and there is a chance of failure, that alone will deter all but the wealthiest players from pursuing such items.

This is how you function as a cleric at level 60 if you want to solo... you have to acquire, in whatever way and through whatever capacity is available to you, items that will allow you to solo effectively.  Hammer of the Sun, if its casting range is increased to a good bit, could be the solo tool we clerics have been aching for.  That combined with the right-click Immobilize with the 2.0 second cast time and you have an unstoppable undead soloing machine.

The Age of Cleric Soloing is coming people... its just a difficult pinnacle to obtain and will be an uphill battle the entire way.
