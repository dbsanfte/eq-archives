I think that the best I've done him with was with about 14 people.  In all honesty, a CH rotation isn't needed here because his damage is pathetic when he's slow.  However, he's a very good test Mob.  If you want to work on a CH Rotation and get your Clerics some practice, do it with him since the fight is long and it will give you an idea of what to expect with other encounters.<P>I have no idea about how powerful your Guild is but Lord Bob is also a good fight to practice Main Tanking and CH Rotations on.  He Flurries so you can get an idea of some large output.<P>After that, go for Vindi.  Odds are you will not win your first, second or even third try but Vindi is an EXCELLENT mob to really see what high end Velious/Luclin mobs can do.  Just make sure you have plenty of Clerics, and fill the rest of the raid force out and go for it.  He takes practice but once you get the tactics down, it will make future raids much easier since you have an idea of the mentality behind such fights.<P>------------------<BR><A HREF="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=6975" TARGET=_blank>Quistil Angelwatch</A><BR>High Priest in the service to the Great Mother Tunare<P>Islington Angelwatch <BR>Cavalier of 53 Seasons in the glorious service to Erollisi Marr</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#f7f7f7"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Seethur</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Why oh why does everyone insist on a heal rotation and the dumbing down of the cleric class =(</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#dedfdf"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">JanSorensen</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">The log parser I use: <A HREF="http://home.inreach.com/kai/EQCompanion/" TARGET=_blank>http://home.inreach.com/kai/EQCompanion/</A> <P>The reason a long fight vs a low dmg mob is easier than a short hectic fight is simply that the only risk is falling asleep or running out of mana - compare to a fight where the tank can actually die and you have to scramble to heal the next tank while he has to try to get aggro before the mob tears up too many of your damage dealers. <P>The margin of error is just alot larger on a long fight vs a low dmg mob than a short(er) fight vs a high damage mob. Combine high dmg and long fight for the truly rough times  <IMG SRC="http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/smile.gif"> Just consider that if the mob cannot kill someone in less than 12 sec you can actually react to them taking aggro and start a CH - but if they kill in 6 sec you have to start healing before they get hit.<P><BR>Seethur<P>It seems you are on a personal crusade against CH rotations.

I agree it sucks, but its the system that is broken, not (all) of the people using it.<P>We've done Lord Bob already, everyone agreed he was pretty much a joke. Hell, not too long ago a single group did Bob, and they were far from uber...there might have been two pieces of NToV gear amongst them and one primal, with a healthy smattering of SS armor. Took um a couple tries to get him, but they eventually did it.<P>So, if I'm understanding, Vindi will basically be the exact opposite of the VaDyn fight? Low HP/high damage as opposed to high HP/low damage?<P>Should be intersting....we're planning on trying him this week sometime if we can find him up on one of our raid days. I'm assuming on a 1400AC/5000HPish MA we should be going for about a 2-3 second cycle?<P>------------------<BR>Higar Mettlebender<BR>Templar of the 55th Prayer and Luclin Loot Ho<BR>Weilder of the Water Sprinkler of Nem`Ankh<BR>Guardians of the Keep<BR><A HREF="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=20669" TARGET=_blank>Higar's Profile</A><BR>Master Drinker (200) <BR>Master Jeweler (188)Master Fletcher (185)Master Smith (183) Master Brewer (175) Master Potter (168) Master Tailor (163)Master Baker (162) (Anyone got any dragon meat lying around??) <BR>Proud wearer of the 7th prayer shawl.<BR>Coldfyre <BR>Warrior of the 14th Blade<BR>Grandmaster Mule (255) Grandmaster Trader (255) <P>Drinal Server <BR>"These balls are making me testy!"</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#dedfdf"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">JanSorensen</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">If your MT only has 5k hp buffed - then 3 sec is probably about right. <P>For the first fight its better to lose because you go oom than because you healed to slowly and the tank died - so by all means heal fast to get some data to work with.<P>Another difference is that Vindi rampages - so be prepared for that. Rampage is definitely worse than flurry - /rude quad Creator/IV.<BR><P>------------------<BR><A HREF="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=4264" TARGET=_blank>Mikar of the Nexus</A><BR>High Priest of Brell<BR><A HREF="http://companions.windsofstorm.net/" TARGET=_blank>The Companions</A><BR>The Tribunal</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#f7f7f7"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Aldur</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Don't know mikar, rampage if you deal with it, makes the damage output alot steadier on the MT.<P>From the limited experence in ST, a tank can recieve anywhere between 20 and 80% hp loss in 10seconds pre slowed simply because of flurries.<P>Rampage however is more of a worry about cleric safety rather than MT safety.  Its a trade off really.<P>Anyhow I would put vindi as much more difficult than the statue overall.  Out of the 3 easy chain mobs, of velks vindi and statue, vindi is the most tricky (of course quad statue is harder pre slow but that don't happen for long).  Velks can get tough near the end if you take too long, he spends most of the first bit of the fight trying to nuke, and when he forgets to nuke his dps really increases.<P>Vindi is a good test mob purely because he is always up, so you can have alot of practice at it.</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#dedfdf"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Corynthia</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">i have done vadynn with 12 people (that included;  2 clerics lvl 60, shaman 60, rogue 58, warrior 60, ranger 60, 2 wizard 59 & 60, enchanter 60, pally 60, monk 60) with vadynn, slowed me and the other cleric swapped the healing between us and while one of us was healing the other was medding. we even got one add in the fight and no deaths.<P>and we even tried letting pally(60) tank him(well we didnt have any warriors online at the time) and we got him down with 14 peeps and no deaths, but of course that required more healing, had 2 clerics and one druid.<P>So IMO Vadynn is very easy if the people are awake and know what they are doing.

The Warrior used /disc Defensive, Shaman Slowed, the Enchanter kept spawns mezzed while I completely healed the Warrior.  The fight lasted a good 20 minutes, it was long enough for defensive to be reactived about halfway through the fight to give you an indication.  It took FOREVER and I, honestly, never want to do it again.  Yeah we did it with a skeleton crew but the battle took so long it kind of sucked.
