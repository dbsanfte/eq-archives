I know his processor and ram are the same, and if he doesn't have the exact same Vcard it's a close one... I know it's an AGP Geforce2 64mg<P>He's been having a hell of a lot of problems since SoL and not just with EQ anymore.  Certain other games (Empire Earth is one) will just suddenly start "skipping" (can't think of any other way to describe it) and lock.  Sometimes he can't load pics posted on webpages properly etc.<P>When he freezes in EQ it's usually at character selection though before he actually hits enter world.  In game he doesn't often lock, but occasionally he will just freeze up for a second or two.  It's doesn't appear to be lag or ISP since he's on a cable a modem with 4 other comps hubbed adn people on the same server, in the same zone one of the other comps will have no problems.<P>Originally I thought the problem was with his CD-rom since I first noticed it when he was trying to play Empire Earth (most other games work fine).  It doesn't seem to be that though.  So I'm guessing it's his Vcard.  3 or the other 4 comps have the exact same processor, ram and mb (they were all completely upgraded cept for the disk drives, hard floppy and CD/DVD/RW roms at the same time)  The only difference between his machine and the other 3 excepting the drives is the Vcard.  <P>I don't know what to do currently.  The drivers are updated, there are no conflicts, and no useless background programs running.  Someone with more knowledge then me is supposed to look at this week.  If that fails I swap his Vcard with one from another comp (He just bought two new Geforce3s to replace some old Voodoos).<P>If anyone can think of anything else for me to try let me know please.<P>Kaharz Stronginthearm<BR>53rd lvl Vicar of Brell<BR>Rodcet Nife<BR>Forsaken<BR></FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#dedfdf"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Dalur - Veeshan</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Malore - I had a friend help me flash the BIOS so it should be fairly updated (at least I would hope it would).

I ran mine and got a score of around 500, after doing massive setting changes just to get it to finish running.  Installed the ViA drivers, and I jumped to 5800+ score and it ran on the default test settings.<P>I was also getting lockups trying to run any 3D program, constant crashing.<P>If you get solid marks, you can generaly be safe in saying your system (vid drivers, directx, board drivers, etc) is in working order.<P>------------------<BR>Sollwin Lifestar<BR>58th Halfling Templar of Bristlebane<BR><A HREF="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=41743" TARGET=_blank>Inspect Me!</A></FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#f7f7f7"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Quantas</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">my puter is almost the same as yours and i do have the same problem. after the patch screen <BR>when u have to select i accept when i move my mouse either it freezes my system or makes the screen go crazy. i have to try to log in about 10 times  before i get lucky and it goes, trying to us the tab key as much as possible hehe. i have called a few tech supports and they have  no clue.<P><BR>what mother board do u have?</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#dedfdf"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Dalur - Veeshan</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Hehe<P>You guys are asking too many tough questions.<P>The only thing I know is it's a AMD K7 1.3 Ghz (Athalon) thunderbird socket a /200 .<P>I was able to run other 3d games (although a friend at work says DAOC doesn't run off of the same directx8 platform as EQ does).
