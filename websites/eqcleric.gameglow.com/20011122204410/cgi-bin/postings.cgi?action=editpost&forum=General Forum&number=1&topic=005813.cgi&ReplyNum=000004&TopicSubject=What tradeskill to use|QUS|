<TEXTAREA NAME="EditedMessage" ROWS=10 COLS=45 WRAP="VIRTUAL">My advice on tradeskills is that if your not doing it for a reason (i.e. being your guilds blacksmith for example) you will find that they are not profitable.. not only in terms of money spent, but also time invested.

Here is a little rundown of how i see things:

[b]Blacksmithing[/b]: Sounds really cool, infact i have a blacksmithing skill of 177... And you can get to the level of creating FS Plate armor for about 700-1000pp. However, unless your on a newer server, the market for FS is horribly low. High Elf cultural armor looks really cool ! unfortunately, you need uber-blue diamonds to enchant the ore (sell for 2.5kpp on Fennin Ro) AND 2 Essense of Moonlight (very rare drop off vampires in MM and dread wolves in Kithacor) AND Vial of Swirling Mists (very rare drop off of steam/mist elementals).. to even attempt a bracer... if you want to make an Enchanted and Imbued Mithril Plate BreastPlate, your looking at 10 blue diamonds, 20 essense of moonlight, and 10 vials of swirling mist (not to mention hiring druids/rangers to forage Morning Dew for you).. and that is per attempt... However, it can be cool to make a visible suit of FS dyed plate... i made myself one that is light blue and get nice comments and price inquiries on it whenever i wear it ...

[b]Tailoring[/b]: Cost wise it is very "cheap".. time wise it is a real pain. Hunting and/or auctioning for pelts, silks, etc.. is a tedious task at best. There are some very nice new tailoring items that are part of the velious expansion... unfortunately, they trivial to high, and there is nothing to bridge the skill gap between 115 (trivial for quivers i believe) and 200+ which seems to be where the velious tailoring items start to trivial. If your gonna do it, expect to spend DAYS or WEEKS once you get a skill of 115 just to make an attempt at one of the velious tailored items.

[b]Baking[/b]: Only reason to raise your baking skill is to complete the Shawl & Seal quest in Thurgadin... can spend 40pp to get your skill from 1-135 to safely complete the quest.... /auction Anybody want a stack of Fish Biscuits??? PLEASE !!

[b]Pottery[/b]: you can spend about 100pp to get your skill up high enough to make small wisdom dieties (+2wis ranged or melee slot) which sell for about 200-300pp on Fennin Ro... could make you some money if you have the patience to auction them off all day long

[b]Fletching[/b]: dunno, never tried it... at best it would be a limited market for resale. Most people that use bow's will take up this skill far enough to use it for their own devices

[b]Jewelcrafting[/b]: the mother of all tradeskills... and the only one you can become easily profitable, providing you have the funds to get your skill up to begin with. Expect to spend 8kpp to get up to a skill of 180+ . Good side: you will see everybody from level 1 to level 60 wearing enchanted jewelry of some sort (usually). Bad side: your a high elf cleric and if you want the make money, you have to make enchanted jewelry.. but you have to pay enchanters to enchant the metals for you (and generally speaking, they don't like to enchant metals for competitors without a nice little price associated with it), not to mention is costs so much money before you will start to even thinking about a return on your investment.

[b]Alchemy[/b]: SoW potions and Shrink potions.. only things that seem to sell.. that and the fact that it is a shaman only skill... /shrug

[b]Poison Making[/b]: rogue only, don't know anything about it other than they are often happy when i ask to hire them to make dye extracts for me.


couple all this with the fact that there are so many unbalances and non-working recipe's for every skill, AND Verant does not seem to really have much interest in improving the skills to make them a viable option.. and you get a very unique and potentially enjoyable portion of the game that is almost entirely devoid of any value in pursuing...

that is not to say that you wouldn't have fun with them... I do occasionally experience brief moments of joy when smithing... often mixed in the tedious click click click click click click click required to experience that moment of euphoria

/whine off

IMHO, if you get into tradeskill to make piles-o-platinum.. you will most likely be disappointed. If you get into tradeskills for the personal gratification (and occasional gratification of a customer) of creating an item then you may find them rewarding... it all depends on how you approach it
