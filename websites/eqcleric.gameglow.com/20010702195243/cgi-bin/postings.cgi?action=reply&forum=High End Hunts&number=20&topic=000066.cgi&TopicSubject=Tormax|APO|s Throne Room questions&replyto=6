<TEXTAREA NAME="ReplyMessage" ROWS=10 COLS=45 WRAP="VIRTUAL">[QUOTE]Originally posted by Arkand Eagleseeker:
[B]Hi, Rayne. Long time no see.

As a guildmate of Skrim's, I've been working on this one too. I think I've got a plan that will work, but it will take a 13th person.

All the MOB's named above have a quest. That means that when hail'ed by a non-KoS, tehy should stop and chat. So, all you need to do is this:

Pull the three to the end of the Ice bridge using normal FP techniques.
Have the non-KoS person hail the NPC.
Wait for the other NPC's to return to spawn points.
Pull the single.

Now, a MOB doesn't need to have a quest for this to work. Many SS MOB's without quests will respond to hails with a single chatty line. That's all you need for them to stop.

They might not stop if you aren't indiff or better. I kinda remember something about that in the back of my head. I know Yelinak (dubious) won't turn to face me when hailed, so I don't think the put-off comments will stop the NPC. But every other NPC in SS with a chatty response will turn to me, and that means they would stop.

I don't know when we'll get to try this out ourselves. Hopefully, we'll go next week.

We don't have the strength to kill Tormax in guild, but do have the strength to kill the other mobs, er, provided we get them single.  We could probably do a duo (have done a few), but the Sentinels are rather painful with two groups.<P>So, we split the first two Sents easily (Monk aggros, I aggro the 2nd Sentinel with the SK, we both feign after the original Sentinel has been handed off).  The next three are then single puills.<P>That leaves us with Kyenka and his two pets on the left, and Ytarr and his two pets on the right.  One time we managed to get just Ytarr and one Sentinel (the Monk then promptly dumped them on Rayne's head -- fun fight with the Cleric dead), but out of obstinancy have been concentrating on splitting Kyenka and his two guards.<P>Here's what we've tried and failed at:<P>-> Dispelling Kyenka after pulling past the bridge.  Ideally Kyenka would stop to rebuff while his guards went home.  What actually happens is Kyenka's guards stay put while he rebuffs.  So scratch that.<P>-> Snaring Kyenka and then feining.  Same deal.  They sit tight with Kyenka until the darkness wears off.  Just a note: the easy way to feign split Velious mobs is have an SK cast Dooming Darkness (the lower level snares don't seem to work) and then feign.  The other mobs return while the feign mob just stands there.  Regardless, doesn't work on Kyenka.<P>-> Having a tank hold up the guards in the TR while we pull Kyenka.  Could work, but the 57 Warrior aggro'd Tormax.  Was ugly.<P>-> Variations on picking a mob out of the pack.<P>Now the only thing we haven't really tried is snaring a guard and feigning (got late).  I'm hoping that the guard will stick and Kyenka isn't so loyal.  But I have my doubts.<P>We're considering some fancy tricks to Root/Snare his guards and kite them a little bit while we kill Kyenka (is what was suggested by people who kill Vindicator), but not sure how we'll it'll work.<P>Any suggestions beyond the brute force technique?  I'm sure we could gather a force big enough to deal with three at once, but that doesn't seem like fun.<P>Rayne</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#f7f7f7"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Remfin</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Kyenka and his 2 guards use pet AI - you have to deal with them at the same time, or take them out of the equation<P>(not to be confused with the sentinel standing next to him, he's his own mob - the 2 guards are up behind tormax's area when kyenka has not been aggroed since server up)</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#dedfdf"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Rayne</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">So you doubt that I could split a guard (pet) off Kyenka?<P>In that case I suspect we could "kite" the guards using snares and feign.<P>Rayne</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#f7f7f7"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Skrimgeour Kuchenhyrst</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Bah Rayne, we were in the exact same area last night as a guild and encountered the same challege.<P>Our monk puller plans to try gobs of gooey goo next time.<P>Skrimgeour Kuchenhyrst<BR>The Haven</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#dedfdf"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Rayne</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Very magic resistant, but might work.  Dartanian went in and Malo'd Kyenka (died -- too slow on Evac), Malosini'd (died -- too slow on Evac), and I was able to snare him fine.  Just didn't do crap.<P>Personally, I'm now leaning toward dispelling the crap out of Kyenka's guards and kiting them (aggro insanely, feign, wait, stand up, feign, wait, repeat for 3 minutes =P) while we kill Kyenka.  Or dispelling the crap out of Kyenka and a guard and kite them while killing a guard.<P>One way or another we WILL split that damned room.  <P>Twelve people is the way to do stuff if you ask me.<P>Rayne</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#f7f7f7"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Caleal</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Heh, we basicly gave up attempting to split them.
