On Erollisi Marr, North ToV was left alone for a solid month as the two highest guilds ignored it as they focused on Seru and Ssra.  My Guild, Affliction, decided to go for it.  After being demolished by Aary the first time, we went back and killed him flawlessly.  We then enjoyed a solid month "lock" on NToV as other guilds tried to get past Aary but failed.  Today, there are 5 Guilds and 1 Alliance that have killed Aary.  Of these, only 3 guilds and that 1 Alliance have a continued interest in the zone (well as long as Vulak isn't spawning properly).

Anyway though, in my opinion, Aaryonar is the lock.  If you cannot kill Aary, you have no business entering into the hub area of NToV.  It's very obvious that Aary is one of the hardest dragons here and he is a good "test" for Guilds to prove that they're ready.  Once after Aary, most of the fights are pretty easy.  The only two notable exceptions are Lady Nev who I despise with a fiery passion that would extinguish the light of a thousand suns, and Lordy Vyemm whom I'm relatively indifferent to.  Even a guild that "thinks" they can kill Aary still needs to do it simply to prove that they can.  That way there is no doubt in anyone's mind that you have "earned" your way into the zone.

A lot of Guilds consider it VERY bad form to ride on another guild's coattails and enter NToV  while Aary is down and other dragons are up in the guild who killed Aary intends to return in a timely manner (obviously killing Aary on Monday and not planning on coming back until Sunday is a bit much).  Aary is one of the most intense fights in the game and ANY guild can still have problems with him if things go wrong.  He's a HUGE drain of time and resources and by skipping past him, that invalidates a lot of other peoples work.

Anyway, learning NToV is a LOT of fun.  The first couple of times everyone had the "OH NEAT!" attitude and we were VERY cautios about things.  I have personally sat in the hall near PoM for a solid 3 or 4 hours twiddling my thumbs waiting as the Monks worked out strats to pull the Trips.  That part sucked but it had to be done.  The only way to really learn the zone is to just do it.  Spoilers will only take you so far in this zone.  And to address your problem with getting Zlexak on the pull instead of Cekenar, our guild has a simple strat.  The Monks pull and HOPE to get Cek or Sev but we all EXPECT Zlexak.  We prepare for Zlexak and if we get one of the others, we adjust accordingly.  Zlex can single handidly wipe out a raid force in less than 2 minutes if given the chance.  I know...  I was the only Cleric to camp out on one particular Zlex wipe.

Well there you go, that's my thoughts and experiences with NToV.
