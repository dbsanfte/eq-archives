But any suggestions on how to start getting in on the Ragefire rotation?  I'm worried because I hear two of our Uber Guilds are out to prevent each other from doing Rage as some kind of point of contention between the two... /sighs  Do I just go to skyfire and start talking to every cleric I see in the zone?<P>Any suggestions would be helpfull. /smiles</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#f7f7f7"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Boanerges</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">The only real option anymore is to keep a raid ready at all times.

Then, the cleric at the top of the list takes out Ragefire and the next cleric moves up and waits his/her turn.  So, if you are playing on Luclin (which, of course I dont know whether you are or not), my suggestion would be to visit Luclin.com and check out the Ragefire Rotation post.  If you are not playing on Luclin, visit your server message board and inquire if there is a Ragerfire Rotation for your server.<P>Good Luck!</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#f7f7f7"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Suuloti</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">&lt;FLAME&gt;<BR>Luclin server ... how many times have I heard/read about Luclin Server's Ragefire list...<P>That list is great for those on Luclin.  But make no mistake; that phenominon is exclusive to Luclin server.<P>In fact, when I read Absor's post on the matter which said little more than "you'll just have to get along," the first thing I thought about was Luclin's list.  Is it possible (likely?) that VI sees that list as an excuse to do nothing to effectively deal with contention over the cleric epic?  "See, they're getting along on Luclin.  You just have to get along like them..."<P>Maybe I need to get a group of friends together, all move to Luclin, and crash the list, so VI couldn't point the finger there!

Suppose each guild supporting the list gave a group of characters (for a week, say) to the Policing of the List, and those folks were ALWAYS there and ready to kill him. (arranging folks so that you're not on 24 hours but that you always have coverage) Then when he pops they KILL him for the next cleric on the list.  Assuming they avoid a KS (and if they're READY they probably will) what can the other folks do but complain, or attempt to KS or Ninja the loot?  If they KS or Ninja the loot, then /petition and get the GMs to clean out those who offend. <P>Sure, they'll occasionally get one. But if you keep at it where they can't just walk over you, you'll be happier with the epic's you've gotten and perhaps, just perhaps , they'll have joined the rotation to avoid the hassles.<P>(Unfortunately, a lot of these types of players see this as a competition between you and them that they *must* win...expect it to take quite a while to wear them down)<p>[This message has been edited by Belhaven (edited 03-29-2002).]</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#f7f7f7"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Jubal</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">You will have to make a choice: is it more important to you to have the epic, or is it more important that nobody feel you've stepped on their toes or jumped their camp?

The list as far as I see is rubbish though. Why? Because clerics know that if they were to go by that list they wouldnt be getting their epic this year as well as the fact that the list also seems to be biased towards certain guilds. Some uber guilds arent gonna support it cos they know that ppl put lvl 5 clerics on that list and even if its full of 51+ clerics why is an uber guild gonna be pushed around by some noob guild who's gonna need the help of another guild. For this reason a few of the uber guilds dont go by it and I'm sick of hearing whining clerics in SF about blablabla i was next on the list because frankly I hate the idea of the list because I would like my cleric to have an epic sometime this decade. The way I'll be doin it is by sitting and waiting behind someone with my party, waiting till theyre done and then taking up camp. As far as i know in the past GM's have taken the side of the party waiting in line etc, not 1 person sitting there saying that "Im on a list" which GMs frankly cant give a damn about.</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#f7f7f7"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Reptilia</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Oh trust me, there is definately no etiquette when it comes to ragefire. Also, I am quite suprised people would say to constanly keep a raid in the zone... I mean, that WOULD be an awesome way to ensure Rage is yours, but who the hell could keep close to 4 groups in SF for hours upon hours? I mean, average spawn time is close to 6 days! Best way is to make a list of friends or people you can ask for help (inform them ahead of time that they will have to get to SF ASAP), and sit yourself in SF to wait... then pray people get there quickly. Also, dont underestimate Rage. He has toughened up a lot.<P><P>------------------<BR></FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#dedfdf"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Ellystra</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Simple as this - some servers have been able to maintain and respect a list. I stress - SOME SERVERS.<P>For instance - on Bertoxx - it's a damn free for all... uber guilds have like 9 billion level 60's logged nearby - and go play twinks. Then the minute someone gets word that Rage is up - they all log in and form into predefined groups which were already buffed before logging. It makes it impossible to complete it.<P>And woe to those able to get their forces there in time to actually engage Ragefire - they have it kill stolen right from under their noses thanks to Verant's wonderful "DD crits" for Wizzes (and other such classes) who stand there and nuke the crap out of RF (for 3K + dmg per spellcast). I know - it happened to a close friend of mine. Verant's response you ask? Tough sh*t because you didn't have enough folks there to keep him from being KS'd.<P>In retrospect.... I've been waiting 11 months to get Ragefire to finish off the epic... in light of the recent changes and KS fests and fighting that's been created - I highly doubt I'll ever finish off the quest.<P>*sigh* If you're out there watching this thread Verant - you royally f*cked up and need re-evaluate and change this quest again - because all you did was make a bad situation intolerable.<P>------------------<BR>Teir'Dal Revenant of the 57th Rank<BR>Ellystra Pureheal - Human Templar of the 59th Order<BR>Wood-elf Rogue of the 21st Blade<BR>Iksar Monk of the 21st Fist<BR>Erudite Necromancer of the 11th Unholy Sanctum<BR>Vah Shir Warrior of the 15th Sword<BR>Teir'Dal Enchanter of the 2nd Rank<BR>Bertoxxulous</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#f7f7f7"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Camien</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">/sigh.<P>Due to problems like these, I made a post in the "lowbie's view" thread.<P> <IMG SRC="http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/frown.gif"><P>------------------<BR><A HREF="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=103941" TARGET=_blank>Camien Ta`Mire</A> 51st Vicar<BR><A HREF="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=74341" TARGET=_blank>Milander Truewield</A> 51st Cavalier<BR><A HREF="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=155213" TARGET=_blank>Ganyon</A> 17th Warrior<BR>Erollisi Marr</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#dedfdf"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Mierrie</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">On Tarew Marr, the newest incarnation of this 'List' attempt is nothing but a blatant joke, and as such, will NEVER be respected.<BR>The List is allegedly "held" and 'overseen' by 3 guilds...one of whom makes it a deliberate point to state loudly and clearly that they do NOT support -any- reservation system whatsoever....and yet we are to expect -them- to honour and uphold a Ragefire list?? Oh puhLEASE. Doesn't help matters that when you actually DO get a reading of the list, you find out that ALL 3 of those guilds have the 9 top spots on The List held by THIER Clerics. Gods forbid you should make the mistake of asking those same 3 guilds what happened to the other Clerics from the other guilds who had been at the top of the LAST list!!!<P>Currently, we are helping to hold this camp for another guild whose cleric was once a member of our's. And once he has his Ragefire, we take over the camp for our Cleric. And trust me, we have already had a noticable presence in SkyFire for the past week with 3 groups hunting for exp and spell drops around-the-clock, with the rest on phone-call standby.<P>Yes Ragefire Camp sucks...but in the  good news dept, we've managed to secure SEVERAL lvl 60 spells for guildmates and friends.
