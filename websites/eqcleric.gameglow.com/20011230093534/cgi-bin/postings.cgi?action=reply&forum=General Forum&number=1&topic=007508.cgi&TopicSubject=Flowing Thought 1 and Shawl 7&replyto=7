[B]I have it, and can't imagine myself taking it off unless it is for resist gear...day to day I just don't see any gear with the stats to make up for the time I put into and the pride wearing it brings me. Course, it surely helps that the only tradeskill I had to start from scratch on with this shawl was jewelrycraft..another 60 points in my fletching and I was all but ready for the quest the day it started. FT1? Nice, not really noticable, but hey, it doubles my standing regen, right? Heh. I'll do 8-10 when they show up, even if it's just minor upgrades along the way. I was most likely the youngest on my server to finish this (at level 50), though I wouldn't be suprised if someone else has or will finish it sooner sometime soon-but they'll most likely be a twink, so its all good. (If ya haven't noticed, I like doing things before other people...I was non KOS CoV at level 34, 7th shawl at 50, epic at 51). The day I finished my shawl, I asked some people I knew level 60ish in semi to fully uber guilds if they knew of anyone on the server who had one...out of about 10 people asked, I made number 5 out of all them combined that they knew who made the shawl. So no, I'll never take that thing off-stats be damned, I have another 15 or so slots to make up stats with.

For those of you that have, do you wear the Shawl full time?  Is the Flowing Thought Effect and stats enough to make it full time gear?<P>The reason that I ask this is that I JUST completed the 7th Shawl.  I, personally, intend to wear mine full time.  I spent a LOT of time working on these quests and it's a very sweet reward.  So it comes down to a matter of pride that I finally finished this.  Before this I was wearing an Obulous Death Shroud so it's not a huge upgrade (but not really a downgrade either).<P>Anyway, just curious.    <IMG SRC="http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/smile.gif"><P><BR>------------------<BR>Quistil Angelwatch<BR>Templar of 58 Seasons in the service to the Great Mother Tunare<P>Islington Angelwatch <BR>Cavalier of 53 Seasons in the glorious service to Erollisi Marr<p>[This message has been edited by Islington (edited 11-29-2001).]</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#f7f7f7"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Dalur - Veeshan</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Haven't done it and probably won't<BR><P>------------------<BR>Dalur Stouthealer<BR>60th Dwarven High Priest<BR>Veeshan Server</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#dedfdf"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Cayleu</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">I have it, and wear it proudly</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#f7f7f7"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Dikmer</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Haven't done it either.<P>Probably wont.<P>Fishing is a required skill to do the quests. I myself have over 150 fishing, due to the pious (read: BROKE) nature of lower level clerics who couldn't afford ports. I fished while waiting for the boat(s).<P>Pottery is another required skill for the shawls. Well, I can see ANYONE wanting to learn pottery simply for the Thurgadin Gate Potions. Not to mention, you gotta be able to make a mug to hold yer beer  <IMG SRC="http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/wink.gif"><P>Baking? Well, who in Norrath can't use a little skill in cooking? Can't live off bread and water forever, can you? (well, you CAN, but would you want to?)<P>I see every reason for a cleric to be a smith (especially a dwarf cleric). We wear plate armor, we have the affinity to metals, etc etc. I am a smith (188 skill). Unfortunatly, smithing is the one tradeskill not required to do the shawls.<P>I see no reason, roleplaying or otherwise, why a cleric should have to be a high level tailor. Sure, we learn tailoring to make ourselves the newbie patchwork armor (at least, I did). And sure, we could have some tailoring to make leather paddings for smithing and bags. But not high skilled tailors. It doesn't fit the class. (My tailoring is 82.)<P>I see no reason, roleplaying or otherwise, why a cleric should learn Fletching. We can't use bows. Our religeus affiliation prohibits weapons of any kind that break or pierce the skin. It's not a viable trade skill, since no one actually BUYS arrows anymore, they just use summoned.<P>I see no reason, roleplaying or otherwise, why a cleric should be a jewelery crafter. We can not enchant the items we make. Therefore, it's not a viable trade skill since no one will buy unenchanted jewelery.<P>I am not going to dump thousands of PP into learning JC, Fletching and high level tailoring. It's just not worth it.</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#dedfdf"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Dystopya</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Ive been wearing this shortly after the quest arrived....

The FT effect is supposed to stack with all other forms of mana regen though.<P>I can't verify if this is true or not, but it makes sense knowing how VI opperates.
