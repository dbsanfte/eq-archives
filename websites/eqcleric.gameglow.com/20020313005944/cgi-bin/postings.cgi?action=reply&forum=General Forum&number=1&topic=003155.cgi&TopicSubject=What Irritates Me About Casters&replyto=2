[B]Heh, lately that's my pet peeve also. Fairly balanced group, couple tanks, necro n mage, druid and me.

End of the fight, vs solo mobs in kunark somewhere.

Monk: mana?
Me: 80m
Druid: 70
Necro: 50
Mage: 20

And I'm thinking 'wtf is he doing down at 20m vs a single mob?' Wish they would just let the tanks do their job more.  :)

I decided to post our number one reason here hoping that someone out there who plays like this will notice and become a better group member.  I do not notice this happening with Clerics very often, it is usually wizards and mages, but I grouped with a 45th Cleric last night who had this problem.<P>People who use all of their mana and cast again as soon as they get enough for one spell irritate me.  I don’t understand why someone always has to be at zero mana all of the time.  What if there is an emergency?  I chose 70% as my cutoff.  When I get to 70% mana, unless it is a dire emergency, I do not waste mana on DD or stuns.  I always have mana if the group gets in trouble.  There is no difference between the time it takes to med back one spell from zero and the time it takes from 70%.<P>Going into why this is more of a problem with wizards and mages than clerics is a whole different thread.<P>What irritates all of you other Clerics?  Maybe I am doing something that I don’t realize is annoying and you can enlighten me.  Probably just being in my group is annoying enough for most people.<P>Jasteele<BR>49th Cleric<BR>Rallos Zek<BR></FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#f7f7f7"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Gully Oathkeeper</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">If I feel comfortable where I am fighting I will often nuke down to 80% mana, then the rest of the time i am medding and healing. If its an easy area i'll go down to 60% mana with nukes. But, as far as what aggravates me...there aren't too many high level players that do--by that time they usually know what they are doing. Oh wait I do have one pet peeve...Necros who stay in lich form ALL THE TIME, dot too early (while they are liching and have 50% health), frenzy the mob, and then chain life tap in a desperate attempt to stay alive, further aggroing the mob and making it damn near impossible to pull off them. Whew. Yeah, thats my one major pet peeve. I could also be jealous that I don't have self clarity, grrr. <BR>Anyway, Jasteele, how do you know they are going OOM? Did they say so?

I love when I get two tanks in my group and 1 mage/wizard and the caster calls oom almost instantly after the first fight.  I mean sure they're not doing anything else so they're expected (at least the wizard) to cast spells, but don't cast until you're oom!<P>Something else that's odd to me is the situation that happened in the Frontier Mountains a few weeks ago.  I was grouped with some people and we had a wizard in the group.  After like the second fight she called oom and starts medding while everyone else beats on the giants.  She didn't get up until like four fights later because she had 200 int (mind you... she was level 31) and it took her a long time to med.  Now I don't know about you, but it seems to me that if you HAVE 200 int, that you're going to have a lot of mana, so you shouldn't call oom as often.  She ended up wasting all her mana like four more times during the course of grouping with her.  You'd think she'd learn that if it takes you so long to med, then you should take measures to ensure that you'll still have enough mana to fight after like two fights. grrr<P>On a related note, I've grouped with other clerics and one of my pet peeves is healing a group member when they are at 95% health.  I KNOW it's not full, but I'm not wasting my mana just so the bar looks full.  When the druids or other clerics see that and jump on it, I 'bout slap them upside the head.</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#dedfdf"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">kitsinu</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">My major pet peave is that I like to add hit points to the casters as I have the mana (Full mana?  Are we doing a raid or something?).  This gives the casters a bit more of a cushion against death and many decide it is time to work on their Defense skill.  Casters really suck down the mana when agro, and are still hard to keep alive.  I don't buff the casters to have them die on me, I buff them to keep them alive.<P>I will heal people that are at 95% health myself.  When I am at full mana, full buffs, and we aren't fighting anything, I just burn off the full mana.  Remember, refreshing a hit point buff will heal someone if they already have the buff and are injured.  I think of buffs as precombat healing.  Valor is 90 mana and about 200 hit points.  That is better than Greater Healing efficiency.</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#f7f7f7"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Badaf</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">THese types described are in generally not group players. Group players always keep TOTAL party mana efficency in mind. And in most cases they adjust their mana usage per fight to closely mirror the cleric's mana. Us cleric's mana is what determines that next pull. Most group players know this. If the cleric is low on mana after a standard fight while a caster is still high, the caster knows to nuke more (but not TOO much) so the cleric will not waste as much mana. <P>On necro's. I must agree that a non-group oriented necro is EXTREMELY frustrating. Perhaps its due to all those levels of soloing the same spawn. Perhaps it has to do that they level so quickly (or used to since last patch). I had a necro doing what Gully descibed. And to top that off he was running all over like a chicken with his head cut off yelling for me to complete heal him. Ha! I told him to feign. </FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#dedfdf"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Chikung</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Hmm. Can someone please explain this healing with buffs? I had heard people talk about doing it with Reso and figured you do this on first fight, wait for some health to drop and dish out a Reso.<P>You mean that all along, you can keep refreshing Valor/Reso line and add the hitpoints back?<BR>So that means that if a tank has 1500 hps and Valor adds 200 hps, their total is 1700. <BR>Enter a mob. The first hp he takes away is from the Valor/Reso pool?<BR>I have been under the (erroneous?) assumption that the Valor/Reso line adds the initial hp's and increases the maximum capacity- not hp's anytime.<BR>So to summarize, if my tank has valor buff on, and he gets whacked down to 10 hps. Despite the fact that Valor is on, I can cast Valor again, and he will now have 210 hps?  And this will work again and again?<BR>(note: exagerated for example purposes.

If you notice some caster armor buffs that add to max HP but don't do the heal bit, it looks they lose HP (an optical illusion)  <IMG SRC="http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/smile.gif"><P>So if someone already has the buff and you recast it, their AC doesn't change, their max HP doesn't change, but the spell does a "heal" for the buff amount.  And of course the buff timer is reset.<P>It's a very nice advantage so you don't have to cast heals after armor buffing.  And the side effect is some armor buffs are more efficient (mana and/or speed) than some heals.<BR></FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#dedfdf"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Boanerges</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial"> <BLOCKQUOTE><font size="1" face="Verdana, Arial">quote:</font><HR>Originally posted by Chikung:<BR><B>Hmm.
