<TEXTAREA NAME="EditedMessage" ROWS=10 COLS=45 WRAP="VIRTUAL">Names in EQ.. one of my favorite topics
/rant on

on rodcet there is/was a Divine Froggies.  I'm not sure if they are still around but they were around for a long time.  Can't think of any other odd names on RN though.

But I know what you mean.

My last name since about oh september 99 was Stronginthearm.

Well one PoG raid, probably a little less then a year ago, the whole server crashed and the server GM came out to do resses and removed my name for being a phrase.  I would have argued on the spot, but a friend was playing my character at the time as I had to run out for a few.

So I petition, argueing that as the rules state my name was in violation, but it should be covered by the grandfather policy.  I'm told by the guide that the server GM has final say on what gets grandfathered and since she is the one who removed my name I'm basically SoL.

About a month later VI changes the policy to ENCOURAGE descriptive last names that can be phrases.

So I petition to have it restored.  I am told that I can not have "Stronginthearm" back, some explanation was given that I still don't understand.  Instead we settle on "Strongarm"  Which actually still is in violation of VI policy since it is the last name of an NPC but oh well.

VI has long pissed me off with names.  My names gets stripped when I daily see names like "Iseepanties", "Cutefatfat", or "Lovetaeatcornbread" wtf?  I'm not don't have anything against these players (except maybe Iseepanties) but my name gets stripped and theirs got by?

There used to be a rogue on RN named Aiken T'steal.  (say it slowly.. aching to steal).  He got sick of the name cause it made him even less desirable in a group (this was a bit after Kunark release when very few people liked rogues in their group) and he petitioned his own name.
Four times.  Finally after argueing with the 4th guide that his name was in fact in violation of naming policy the guide removed his last name.  The previous three had refused to do it saying it wasn't a voilation and they weren't supposed to remove a name that wasn't in violation.

One night last summer a friend and I decided to see what names we could get through for new characters.
Names that were accepted:
Benitomousillini
Chairmanmao
Maotsetsung
Josephstalin
Hermangoering
(none of these characters were ever actually played of course)

Names that were not accepted:
Mayormccheese
Hamburgler

We got bored after that.  Now supposedly all names are checked against various filters, if they pass they are approved by a live person (although I have a feeling it's rare that someone is approving new names)  But if someone was, they new who Mayor McCheese was but none of those others?

anyway I think I'm done
