<TEXTAREA NAME="EditedMessage" ROWS=10 COLS=45 WRAP="VIRTUAL">I find that I am rarely if ever summoned when I use this spell, there are exceptions but it is almost entirely down to the mob type, zlandicar for example will crunch you for a normal CH so ya might as well make use of the only spell ya might get off and make it a big one.

In Halls of testing redemption is simply put amazing.  However the trick to using it effectively is understanding that steady damage from for example lure ae damage (keeper, dozer) is much easier to judge than the resistable but much more random ae of the normal mob.  Ae heals typically have a ratio of less than one, hence why the big upset about the ratio on the paladin group heal, but forgetting that its safe to say in order for redemption to be as effecient as other group heal spells you need to heal 1.1k hps.  If you looked at the figures its actually less than 1k but 1.1k is close enough.

Now your general plate tank doing hot will have at least 5k hps, with support melee (rangers rogues monks) will have at least 4k hps.  This is the bare minimum these classes should have at this level with the buffs provided.  Cleric HP's are not so important because you can sit behind a wall an avoid the ae, but even so a cleric should have between 3.5 and 5k hps at this level so in terms of balanced hps we certainly hold our own.

So the typical player will need 20-30% hps healed in order for redemption to be as efficent as other group heals.  Compare the ratio of a 1:1 group heal is infact the same as 6:1 single target - hence already 50% more efficent than a non spell casting reinforcement cleric casting the spell. CH is a funny spell, because it heals so much people believe you have to push it to the limit, but really you don't.  20-30% hps and the spell is guaranteed to be the most efficent in the game.  

Tricks to remember is not to push it too far.  If one or more people drop below 40% hps, there is a risk (its not a guaranteed thing if they have not agro'd) of summon, so you should be looking at starting the group CH at around 50-60%, and its practically guaranteed to give mind boggling efficent results.  Healing 2.5k of 6 people is 15k healing for 1.1k mana, or in other words 13.6:1 healing ratio.  Which is the same as a 5440 hp CH on everyone in the entire group. It's alot easier getting that type of healing ratio with redemption and keeping it safe whereas a 5.5k heal on a tank is probably 1 melee round from death for all but the most uber 6.5k+ tanks around.

One thing to be aware of, word of redemption due to its efficency constraint on the player rather than on the spell, is not best used for MT on a HoT raid, because the increased damage on the MT will cause either less efficency with redemption or a possible conflict of interest between keeping the MT alive and making sure the rest of the group is above the critical 40% marker.  It can be done, but its stressful ill give you that, and its still more efficent than using other group heals or using CE.

Make sure to announce your redemption cast.  And make it players responsibilities to understand what it means.  Pick a player and tell the group you will be healing near them.  If people don't get in range with 12 seconds warning, don't heal them.  Harsh but its a lesson people need to learn.

Also the spiroc lord is not a good mob to mention, he is a cleric killer, primarily because making sure people are buffed = waste of time.  Farming the spiroc lord is all about doing it quickly, and in general at least one cleric will buy the farm with him, and if they are lucky they will tank long enough to die via the DT and not via melee.  Because tanks invariably don't have buffs, they need to be healed earlier and boom you get agro.  You could buff your tanks so that you didn't get agro but that takes longer than just doing it the easier but messier way.  At the end of the day, speed is more important than style.

So back to the original 2 questions.
1.  Where do you use word of redemption.
A. Anywhere that there is predicatable ae damage where there is no diconcernable difference in agro between single and groupd heals.
2. How do you deal with the resulting aggro
A. Well funnily enough I never realised it until that monk thread a while back, but it seems that the first thing you do puts you on the hatelist, but until then you are not on it (assuming the monk doesn't FD and put the entire raid on the hatelist).  So if you don't have a fd puller, then the first redemption is for free, and wont get you agro, and by the time you have to group heal again, you should have sufficent agro on the primary tank built up.</TEXTAREA>
