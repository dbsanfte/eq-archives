<TEXTAREA NAME="ReplyMessage" ROWS=10 COLS=45 WRAP="VIRTUAL">[QUOTE]Originally posted by Talura cwn'Zeylon:
[B]I wouldn't know about Kerra Ridge. The only time I've been there was to kill off Maugrim. Pretty much everything was green then (pre-update, about 30-32 level). But most Erudites never hang around Odus that long...as I said, they turn in their newbie note, get their robe/shirt, and pound pavement headed to the boat and greener pastures. Would this be the case if the island were equally as developed as Faydwer? Probably not, IMO. It would probably draw some more people to the area if they added in an Odus version of Solusek's Eye or Runnyeye and Splitpaw or Nagafen's Lair.

As to the number of dungeons, there are quite a few that still go unused. Mistmoore, on Drinal, has been pretty much a ghost town when I've been (on Tunare, pre-move, it was a pretty busy place). Sol A, Najena, Splitpaw, Permafrost...rarely see more than 6 people in them, most are L50+ item campers. Why? I have no idea. People go where the safety is, and just hit dungeons for items. 
Maybe in a few months they'll "upgrade" warrens like they did to Splitpaw. I hope not, hope they make it go deeper and get tougher.

It sounds like your dislike is based more on them adding more acreage and not enough content. So far as I know, they don't need to do any updates to client-side to add quests (unless they add mobs for it). They may have changed some npc's in town around. Regardless, you should organize the (small) legion of Erudite clerics and paladins and go to whineplay to ask for more quest content for Erudin, that's how your voice will be heard.[/B][/QUOTE]

At one point I had over 30 gnolls trained on me and managed to live <IMG SRC="http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/smile.gif"> hahah<P>loot wise it seems pretty good. Loot drops very regularly and is pretty good money wise. Wicker armour, Bamboo reinforced armour, Dusty cloth, Cold Iron, bronze weapons GALLORE and so much booze it's rediculous. everyone was joking on calling it the wine cellar instead of the warrens.<BR>ok gotta go be back later to tell more <IMG SRC="http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/smile.gif"></FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#f7f7f7"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Cenge</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">what level is this zone?

My character I was on is level 18 and i was getting decent experience. Mostly things conned blue or green to me with the occasional rare red spawn. The King and his Shaman were both super red to me. <P>I would quess the dungeon is around 5-25. I didn't explore the entire dungeon, i fell into this one pit and this Mishevious Batling which conned blue to me kicked me and my rouges ARSE!!! it was chain casting like madness it was crazy. So I would think there are probably higher level mobs down below but i'm not positive.<P>There is also this one odd spawn called a Mugwump or something like that, it's a gigantic tadpole <IMG SRC="http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/smile.gif"> it was red to me as well so i didn't go after it. It was pretty safe for me to walk around in and nothing would agro on me unless it was something that I could gain experience from so very few greens and blues would always agro on me.<P>For someone around 10-15 this area would be heaven, there are SOOOOO many gnolls it's insane. It's pretty easy to get used to the dungeon after a while. <P>The loot drops frequently and most of it is worth a few plat to vendors. Wicker armour isn't very good stat wise the BP is ac 8 but weight is 5.3 so it's useless for monks. it looks like leather but a dark green. bamboo armour looks like chain but is a very dark brown almost black. dusty cloth is extremely light but very poor ac, i found a pair of bracers and they were 0.3 ac1, i'm not up on my mink equipment but that might be good for starting out monks, casters could wear that too. Cold Iron i didn't see any of but from what people told me it's just like bronze.<P>Bronze weapons drop off of so many mobs and they are all japanese style weapons. haha most of the graphics are wrong too, a kusari gama is a handheld scythe about as long as a persons forearm and it was as big as any normal scythe a necro uses:P the coolest weapon though is the bronze katana which looks exactly like a katana <IMG SRC="http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/smile.gif"><P>some rare drops were happening too, a cape off of the Prince and a sceptre off of the King. I forget most of the stats, the sceptre was like 8/40 but had 10 charges of clinging darkness on it. <BR></FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#f7f7f7"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Boanerges</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Verant never ceases to amaze me... they do all kinds of good stuff and then pull this crap. <P>Basically, The Warrens is the Kobold castle. Think SolB for kids. Tons of Kobolds just roaming around. I took my level 19 mage down there. Shoulda just taken my 55 cleric instead. 99% of the stuff there conned green. My roommate brought his level 14 mage and even then 80% was blue. What little did con blue was, of course, being camped. Factions were -(some new Kobold faction) +Heretic +HighCouncilofErudin (we really hate kobolds like them  ) BEWARE the new NPC in the newbie yard of Paineel. Some Necro that conned red and fear kited me (I kid you not). Paineel vets said they'd never seen him before. <P>EVERYTHING gave me a message that said "*mob name* was trivial for your party" which meant I got coin and some straw armor (everyone but pure casters. Low AC, no stats). Apparently, "trivial" means green. <P>First off, Verant was adamant about no new lowbie zones so I have no clue why they put this in with Tox and Kerra already in place and 10x better. It's not like Tox or Kerra are brimming with people already. Moreover, there is a need for mid range content (the 20-40 range) so this doesn't alleviate things. <P>Second, this zone is THE worst designed in the game. It makes Runnyeye look fun by compare. There are whole rooms filled with mobs and if you pull one, they all come. I died twice from green waves that pecked me to death. Most people preferred the hallways on the jail side where pulling singles was easier. Chain agro is a nightmare and if it happens deep inside, you're dead. You can't run back out past all those Kobolds. And if I was getting smacked down at 19 I shudder to think what someone in the "ideal" range would go through. And to top it all off there are sentries that see invis in some areas making CR a nightmare. <P>Bottom line: this was very disappointing. Verant has been making some good strides but this was a step in the wrong direction. Moreover, it goes to show they haven't learned anything from their past mistakes (Runnyeye is still broken as a mid level dungeon for the same reasons). The only reasons to go there are if you have an Erudite newbie or you need a good source for Paineel and Erudin faction (I think that was added to balance out Fear).<P><P>------------------<BR>Boanerges Thundercry<BR>Erudite Templar of Prexus<BR>Cohort Chalybeius<BR>Cazic Thule Server</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#dedfdf"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Lynet</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">I had a very different experience than Boanarges had.  I saw many of the good parts of both crushbone and blackburrow.  There are some named mobs, there are healers and melee mobs, there are runners and trains.  I like this.<P>I make a brief trip through there with a twinked level 20 dwarven warrior and my friend a level 20 troll shadowknight.<P>The greenies did not seem to aggro on their own, but they would join in another fight.  Either tank could solo two blues.<P>Kobolds DO run.  They run early, they run fast, and they bring friends.  We figured that fairly quickly, and started bashing them as they ran and making sure we had darkness on them.  <P>There are some large caves with a mess o' kobolds in them.  I suspect that at lower levels these might get a wee bit exciting without better crowd control than most real newbies can manage.  At level 20 the place was blue-green to green.<P>The batlings are casters.  They were indifferent to my dwarf, but they were mean.  They are also higher level than most of the kobolds.  Next week we will be taking our level 20 Wednesday night group in to play with the batlings.<P>We only fought one named Kobold.  It was yellow at 21 and had a moderate amount of hit points.<P>I did not see a single "trivial encounter" message, perhaps because I ignored the greenies unless they attacked me or healed the mob we were fighting.  I did see a number of dr00ds complaining about seeing that message.  <P>I intend to take my lizard necro here and see what it is like for lower levels.  There appears to be a very nice experience multiplier in here.  In addition melee types can be bound right outside the zone entrance.  At lower levels where the main cost of death is the run back to the corpse, well, this is a HUGE advantage.<P>I think that this is a good addition to Odus, and is a nice way to take some newbie pressure off of Kelethin and Crushbone.  Those zones are over crowded, even on the mature servers.<P>Lynet Beaumains, The Damosel Savage</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#f7f7f7"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Tyron</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">That new Necro hade me busy rezin twinks fer people last night,  He's green at 51 but took 2 Solid Retorbutions and 2 Solid 90 point stuns to drop...

The "This encounter was too trivial" message does indeed mean that the mob was too low level for you...you'll get it if nobody in the group would get exp from the kill (whether everyone is too high level or the level gap is too extreme), and all special drops on the mob will change to a note that says "Naughty naughty, go camp something useful. This is a newbie zone." (Well, something like that anyway.) Mobs do tend to pop quickly, about 10 or 15 minute spawn I'd guess, so it will keep any legitimate groups on their toes to keep areas split and cleared. Very good training for future places like bugs in sol-b or just about anything undead-side of guk.<BR>Overall, though, I like the new zone and the new loot rules. I also disagree with Bonarges, I believe that VI <I>is</I> making noteworthy progress with this, both by giving Erudite newbies a reason to stick around past turning in their training note and by looking for solutions for item campers. <BR>Why did they add a low/mid dungeon? Dunno, but this area definately needed it; I think Odus was the only starting area in the game that lacked an immediate place to go for anyone leaving the newbie zones. Now they no longer have to go to Blackburrow to compete with scores of half elves, humans and barbarians.<BR>As far as the loot goes, I killed a few things (some of it was just for giggles, some of it mobbed my friend I was helping) and saw typical newbie loot (I think biggest pot I got was 5 gold and change, off a large kobold), a small amount of weapons, and a piece or three of armor. None of the items were spectacular, considering what I have now or could get, but for a true newbie I'm sure any of it would be nice. Did not get a chance to take down any named mobs, so no idea about what sort of "special" loot there might be.<P>Final thoughts. IMO, this was a very good add to the area. I hope VI follows up sometime soon with some more stuff aimed to take Erudites (and everyone else who comes to the no-mans-land out there) from low 20s to high 30s or low 40s; it would be an ideal place for a Splitpaw-for-kobolds.<P>------------------<BR>Talura cwn'Zeylon, Regent of Hate<BR>Legion Draconum  Drinal Server</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#f7f7f7"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Boanerges</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial"> <BLOCKQUOTE><font size="1" face="Verdana, Arial">quote:</font><HR>Why did they add a low/mid dungeon?

In fact, I'm sure if starting in Paineel were an option for all Erudites then Erudin would be a ghost town, save for those needing to use the port. Put some more quests in. Tell those of us who started there that our own town really matters. As it stands now, Erudites who worship Prexus or Quellious get nothing. DE clerics complained and got some nice quests added. Why can't we get some too?<P>2. Give us some deity specific ARMOR, not robes.<P>I'd say 90% of the clerics that are Erudite start in Paineel. Why? Paineel quest armor PLUS humans can forge Imbued armor that is wearable by CT worshippers. Once again, paladins and clerics of Prexus and Quellious have nothing to show for their faith. Make some quests, make it smithable by someone else.

Sol A, Najena, Splitpaw, Permafrost...rarely see more than 6 people in them, most are L50+ item campers. Why? I have no idea. People go where the safety is, and just hit dungeons for items. <BR>Maybe in a few months they'll "upgrade" warrens like they did to Splitpaw. I hope not, hope they make it go deeper and get tougher.<P>It sounds like your dislike is based more on them adding more acreage and not enough content. So far as I know, they don't need to do any updates to client-side to add quests (unless they add mobs for it). They may have changed some npc's in town around. Regardless, you should organize the (small) legion of Erudite clerics and paladins and go to whineplay to ask for more quest content for Erudin, that's how your voice will be heard.</FONT></TD></TR></TABLE>
