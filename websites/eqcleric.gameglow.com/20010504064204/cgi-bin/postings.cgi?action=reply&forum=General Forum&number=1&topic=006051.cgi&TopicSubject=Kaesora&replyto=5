<TEXTAREA NAME="ReplyMessage" ROWS=10 COLS=45 WRAP="VIRTUAL">[QUOTE]Originally posted by Aerie:
[B]The library area (where spirit tome drops) is particularly nasty. Roamers outside the library are clerics, and will heal like clerics. :P

If I remember correctly (and it's been a while since I went there) there is a sharp demarcation line between undead and spider sections of the dungeon. Once you get to the last spider room (it's the second to last room on the map from the ramp down to the library) kill those mobs, and cast invis vs. undead. Go down the ramp to the start of the library and pull roamers, then pull statics. At least that's the way I did it - but your mileage may vary, as I was playing an enchanter.

As you go up the step of the library, there is a porch that wraps all the way around the building. There are two roamers there, both cleric mobs. (maybe three? it's been a while.) They will agro on you if you are fighting inside, and they most certainly will heal the mobs inside even if they aren't agro. It's really annoying when the mob running gets healed and start bolting at a full gallop.

The library is probably the second hardest part of the zone. (only second to the church) I would try doing spiders first to get a hold of the dungeon, and get acquainted with the exit. Oh, and your melee friends can get bound in Kaesora, so CR should be a breeze should something go wrong.[/B][/QUOTE]

I think this is a great dungeon, I loved the design. If you want a spirit tome, you'll need a full group. I raided there awhile ago and we got 3 tomes, 4 weight reducing bags and a sk only spear. was really hoping to get a straithbone shield, but apparently it's a super rare drop. my friend tried to get it for about a month and it never dropped. <P>just don't let tanks try and leave on their own, I had people trying to do that all night and every time the rest of the group would have to move up and drag their corpse out. I don't know why they didn't just wait the extra minute for the entire group to get them out of there. <P>Stun was always memmed when fighting the skels, had to keep the undead healers from helping their friends</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#dedfdf"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Kayleigh</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Clarification:<P>There is one undead roamer who goes by the entrance area.  You just got bad luck in hitting him.<P>You can zone out through the same physical area you zoned in at. What I meant earlier was that in order to go anywhere at all in the dungeon, you have to drop off one of two ledges. Once you drop, you cannot get back up of course. (It's not a long drop but big enough.) Once you drop off, you have to fight your way around, or gate.<P>And to add on another post, there is a sharp line between spider areas and undead areas.</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#f7f7f7"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">greywolffe</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial"> <BLOCKQUOTE><font size="1" face="Verdana, Arial">quote:</font><HR>Originally posted by ragnarok1979:<BR><B>as long as you're fighting undead, you don't have to worry about runners. </B><HR></BLOCKQUOTE><P>Sorry but incorrect.  I've been down there alot recently getting my fang.  The undead down there just love to take off when they get down on hp AND it always happens they run by a healer type (especially around the library).<P>Definately bring your own group.  If you happen to see people there it's because they are campin Xalgoz for the fang to finish out the Howling Stones key quest.  Most won't come to your aid if you get into trouble.  <P>Also, on the zoning thing.  When you enter you have to go down a ramp.  At the end of the ramp you have a room with 4 entrances.  The one in front of you is a pit fall that drops you into a spider room.  You'll also take some moderate damage.  The one to the right you cannot go down as this is a oneway drop down to your present location.  The entrance on the left take you to the frenzy room with a bunch of spiders.<P>The xp modifier in here is something like 23% or so (don't kill me I'm not sure).  All I know is off of the blues I was gaining a third of a blue bubble per kill.  The only bad thing is there was only one blue there and that was Xalgoz.   <IMG SRC="http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/biggrin.gif"><P>If I ever decide to level up another character you can guarentee I'll be spending much time in Kaesora.<P><P>------------------<BR>Greywolffe Silverstarr<BR>52nd Cleric of Tunare<BR>E'Marr</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#dedfdf"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Disturbed</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">My first night rap up..

There are 3 spawns on the wall to your left as you enter, and two (3?) more inside the door right there. You can pull skeletons through a secret wall in that 2nd room, as well as having a few more spiders you can pull from the hallways around.<BR> <A HREF="http://eqatlas.com/kunark/kaesora1map.html" TARGET=_blank>http://eqatlas.com/kunark/kaesora1map.html</A>  .. this one, the map is upside down (IMO) from where you zone in. Also, it's one-dimensional so may be difficult to follow if you think in terms of level drops, et cetera. <A HREF="http://eqmaps.com/m2/kaesora2.gif" TARGET=_blank>http://eqmaps.com/m2/kaesora2.gif</A>  ..

To your right is where you come when you zone out.  Straight ahead is two drops.  If you lev down to level 2 there is only one mob there.  If you fall all the way down you will be surrounded by about 5 spiders.  One possible named spider.  My suggestion is to make a left and fall one level.  When you hit bottom do not open any doors.  You will be standing in a doorway one mob and pit to your left and the frenzy room to your right and a door straight ahead.<P>Pull the one on your left (watch out for the pit) and then pull the three from the frenzy room.  After those 4 are done move into the frenzy room.  There will be one closed door and one door way.  There will be one you can pull from past the doorway and two that are behind the door.<P>Kill the two from behind the door and move into that room.  In there will be a false wall that leads to the library.  Past the wall is all undead.  At the bottom of the first ramp will be three undead mobs.  Head past the other ramp and there will be another three mobs.  Turn the corner and down the hall is the library.  Avoid camping in the library itself.  Three good spots to camp is 1. Right at end of hall where only one mobs pops, 2. Pull to the fountain area in front of the library, 3. After you clear library head through the library to the back stairs behind it.<P>Try and bring an evacer to get out.  If you need to work way out then go back up to the frenzy room and go through the one doorway with the one mob.  Make a left and you will see a huge open pit.  Drop down to find 2-3 more mobs.  If you continue straight, that will be the way out.  If you turn around, then you are headed towards the church.<P>Most green at 44.  Shield most likely drops in Frenzy room.  Undead mobs with loot will run.  Good luck.<BR><p>[This message has been edited by Chaldaea (edited 04-20-2001).]</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#dedfdf"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Valya</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">For you DEs, Kaesora has nasty faction hits on your Outpost faction.
