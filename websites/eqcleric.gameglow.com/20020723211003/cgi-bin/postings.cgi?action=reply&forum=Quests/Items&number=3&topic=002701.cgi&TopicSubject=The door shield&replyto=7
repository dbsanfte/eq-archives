<TEXTAREA NAME="ReplyMessage" ROWS=10 COLS=45 WRAP="VIRTUAL">[QUOTE]Originally posted by Skrimgeour Kuchenhyrst:
[B]Well, I said you would have to be very, very good. We typically don't do it unless we have 10 people. For the room always seems to repop just before the high priest pops (grin).

To MOBs for this always spawn in the same place. Right across from the ledge and then they walk directly to the ledge to try to push you off.

What we do is:
a) Park a warior on their spawn point
b) park two casters (cleric, shaman) sitting at the bottom of the ledge, in the mobs path. If the MOBs get that far, they aggro (usually) on the sitting people.

If a mob does get past (i.e. you are dealing with respawn), We call on the casters to nuke it down hard, so the melee don't all go charging up and get themselves rooted....

You want a safety net on the person that is rooted. Have em start clicking on the shackle from as far away as possible, that way you can eat a few pushes and still be on the ledge.

As for camping and coming back to reset...it isn't a perfect solution. We tried that, and it seemed to work fine, until suddenly in the early part of the third wave I was summoned down (we got someone else up there, so it wasn't a big deal), but I had camped, got a drink and came back....

They look the same.)<P>Doable with one solid group, easy with two groups.  Skrimgeour and his guild took hours to figure this out some time ago when it was buggy (I think they had three high priests at one point hehe), he may be able to explain finer points.<P>Zone into acrylia, invis up, turn right, take the second left, open gate, run across to the far side with steps to your left up into the "castle" with a lava moat inside.  Inside to the far right is a door over small steps.  Most possessed corpses don't see invis but you may need to fight through ones that do.<P>Up the small steps, through the door and to the left is an untargetable grimling high priest.  Also 4-5 possessed corpses in the room.  On the far side of the room to the left are steps out onto a ledge overlooking the lava with shackles on the edge.  When ready, have one person run out onto the ledge and remain there at the shackles.  Every couple seconds they'll be rooted.  The grimling will shout that they've been invaded and summons three waves of possessed corpses to try and knock the person on the ledge into the lava.  If that person is knocked off or somehow leaves the ledge the cycle stops.  If you're taking one group and somehow get overwhelmed, you can dispel the shackle root and have them run off the ledge to stop the spawns.<P>Each wave takes about 15 minutes each, with slightly harder (and more) skeletons each wave.  They are undead, SK's and clerics mostly.  Harm touches aren't bad (400-600), melee output is slight (120-160).  What will be a danger is the cleric skeletons that are unstunnable/unmezzable due to level.  Banishment of shadows is pretty useful for the CH'ing skeletons, especially if you've got a couple or one up with the fighting high priest.<P>After the three waves, the high priest says he'll take care of the foes himself and begins to fight.  Not sure on his melee output, but if you can get through the waves you can beat him easy, especially if he's slowed.  (Always done this with a L60 shaman there, not sure how tough it'd be without)<P>Either a high priest of the same name as the untargetable one will spawn, or a named will spawn, High Priest Gakkernog.  Gakkernog can drop the shield, the sacred grimling mace, and some decent but not amazing caster hat.  The no-named one drops the junk versions of the shield, mace and mask.<P>Rarely, he can drop L60 spells, including Blessing of Aegolism.  Haven't seen him drop an int-caster spell out of a half dozen spell drops.<P>The norent key he also drops is part of a very long quest on the order of the coldain rings. (except the grimling war is 10x more mobs than the coldain war)<p>[This message has been edited by Gello (edited 03-04-2002).]</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#dedfdf"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Ketocon</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">he likes to drop beast crap!</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#f7f7f7"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Skrimgeour Kuchenhyrst</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Gello pretty much hits the high points.<P>We actually found this the first day of Luclin when we had no idea what we were doing. <P>What we did *not* know is the high priest had been bugged, so there were three of him up. So when our mage accidentally triggered the shackle, we were getting waves of 3 at a time (for our 6 person group). Which was a little too much to handle.<P>He only seems to drop WIS caster spells.<P>There is alos a bug/feature which makes it hard for you to repeat it right away. If you just did it, and go back to trigger the shackle again, the priest will occasionally summon you down. What you need to do is have someone else be shackle-bait, and have 2 people ready to rush up there in case that person is summoned down.<P>The script checks occasionally to see if someone (it doesn't matter who) is snared in the shackle. If not, the script ends.<P>I heartily recommend it be a cleric that gets snared. At the end we get summoned anyway, and our spells work without LoS. The wizards, mages, etc,., we have had snared, are rendered ineffective.<P>A great group of 6 could do. But I recommend 10-12.</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#dedfdf"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Aldur</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">I find that camping out and coming back resets it so that you can start the quest again.<P>One thing I do query is that 6 people need to be very very good in order to do this and not get behind the spawns.<P>The spawns are about one every 55 seconds for a period of 13 minutes for the first two waves and then about 10 minutes for the final wave whereby you get the final priest to fight.<P>None of the mobs are particularly difficult but the sheer damage output that is required is easy to over look.  A single group can easily keep up with the single spawn, even in round 3.  However the problems we faced are when the room itself repops.  There are about 4 blue con mobs in the room which seem to pop every 10 or so minutes.  The entire spawn takes around 36 minutes to perform, during which you get around 48 odd mobs to kill.<P>With a single group (with one member practically reduced to doing very little), this could be a difficult spawn.  The damage output of all the mobs baring harm touches is fairly insignficant (although the high priest and named is a bit of a bitch), but it means that you only have 5 people capable of dealing damage.<P>If you are looking to farm, take 2 groups, at least until you know what to expect.</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#f7f7f7"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Darianne</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><BR>First of all, thank you very much for sharing this information.   I took a group out to try this tonight... it was a 'test' group, to see what to expect, etc... <P>I have a few questions...   First of all, do you have to fight the mobs out on the ledge, or is in the room okay?   The mobs SEEMED to spawn from different places, but we could have been getting room repops mixed in.   People followed me onto the ledge and became rooted as well.<P>Second, I was knocked off the bridge (ending the quest) by a cleric mob, casting a knockback spell.   It wasn't much of a knockback, but after a few .. I was gone into the water.   How do you deal with that... is the solution basically to have people simply pickup agro asap?   I imagine high MR would also help.<P>Once you've fallen in the water, is there any way to get out?  I tried jumping on those spikes in the wall, and swimming around, and didn't see an easy way.<P>I loved this quest...

Bards are amazingly effective in this cycle. Mana free mez's, ae mana, mana free charms, stacking haste... Unless your VERY good your likely going to fall behind during some point in the 3rd wave between the double spawns and room repops, and bards help alot with keeping multiples mezzed/charmed.

I like having a druid shackled because I can assist heal, nuke, and provide a damage shield and never have to press more than 2 hotkeys to do it. The high priest, named or not, isn't that difficult but he has alot of hitpoints and we invariably make it tougher by always seeming to get a CH'ing room respawn at the wrong time.<P>I imagine that a single group could do it if they were very well equipped and very coordinated... but that is far beyond my guilds capabilities... if your gimp and you know it clap your hands *clap* *clap*  <IMG SRC="http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/smile.gif"><P><P>------------------<BR><A HREF="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=12024" TARGET=_blank>Panteroo Mcgillakudy</A><BR>High Priest of Fennin Ro</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#f7f7f7"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">chrisstauf</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">*clap* *clap*<P>I'll be doing this with 2+ groups.
