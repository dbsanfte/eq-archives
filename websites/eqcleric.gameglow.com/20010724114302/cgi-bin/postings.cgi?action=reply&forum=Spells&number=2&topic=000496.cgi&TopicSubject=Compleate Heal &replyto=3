Something that in my mind that good clerics look at with regard to when to cast what isn't just how many HP someone has, but the Rate of Damage.  If someone is losing HP very rapidly, you drop either a Remedy or a Divine Light on them.  If it's a slow progression, you do a CHeal, and you an mop up or stabilize with Celestial.<P>For instance, we have a monk pulling on a raid.  She's FD'd after a pull and at 2 bubbles of health, and stable.  I could Celestial her, bring her up to 4 bubbles and say good enough, or I can hit her with a Remedy to top her off as you should on pullers.  However, since she was stable, why not cast a complete heal?  You aren't in danger of having her die, and she can be up and ready to pull in 10 seconds, as opposed to 4.5+24+3+ decision and thinking time.<P>Alternatively, if I have a SK and a ranger in my group, and they are slowly losing HP in a fight, and I feel that the fight is well controlled and the risks mitigated, then you bet I'm going to wait to CHeal them.  On the other hand, it they are mezzed mobs or casters, or the possibility of adds, I'll toss a Celestial at them a lot earlier, knowing that things could get bad with little warning.<P>Obviously though, they are set rules as well.  Chanters get a Remedy at the first HP loss.  Chanters can lose SO many HP in 3.5 seconds it's sick - sometimes if I have the mana and the chanter is AOE mezzing, I'll hit them with a celestial just as the pull comes in, even though they are at full health.  On the flip side, if things are controlled, I may let my tank get down to under a bubble before I even start a CHeal, particually if I'm low on mana.  <P>Being a good cleric is a lot more than 'cheal the tank at 2 bubbles, remedy casters, celestial everyone else'.  It's a combination of mana control, knowing and estimating rate of damage, analysis of the potential danger in your current combat, awareness of what might be roaming toward you from around the corner, and in case of really good clerics, proactively helping chanters with stuns and nukes to boot.<P>A robo-cleric can get very boring, and you can slip by to high levels just by watching those red bars.  A well-played cleric on the other hand as every bit the situation awareness of an enchanter, and is almost as busy.</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#f7f7f7"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">electrae</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Can't quite imagine using cheal on a chanter...  I've never had a chanter last 10 seconds when they were getting beaten on.  But perhaps when I'm level 60 that will be different.<P>Selinar state it very well.  It is all situational.  Sometimes it can be very risky even chealing a tank... just depends on what the rest of the group is doing, how under control the fight is and many, many other things.<P>But sure, I complete heal all kinds of tanks all the time at my level.  When folks start getting 2500-3000+ hit points it makes sense and you often have plenty of time to cast it.<P>And rangers just loooove to be completely healed, makes them feel like BIG tanks.</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#dedfdf"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Marrs</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Just to chuck in my 2cp. When I am fighting in groups, I always have CHeal, Celest Heal and Remedy memmed. CHeal for Wars, Pallys, SKs and usually Rangers. Celest for Bards, and sometimes Rangers depending on the buffs. Remedy on Casters and sometimes Bards, again dependsing on the buffs. I just find when it comes to CHeal that its still really hard to time on anyone with low HP. It just takes ages to get the spell off so has to be timed with great precision, where it is a great deal easier on Wars, Pallys, SKs and Rangers. I can however agree that if my casters have more then 3K worth of HP then it would be much more mana efficient to use CHeal instead, but I have never been in that situation. As I said timing is everything with healing of any type and you just have to get used to it, and yes PLed clerics have a disadvantage where that is concerned as they have not had the opportunity to get group exp. This is just MHO so take as you wish.

Divine light is a nice heal, but a terrible spell, it still fizzles too much and it's frighteningly inefficient. Celestial is nice during downtime and to heal someone who isn't aggro'd and doesn't merit a cheal, but it's too slow to be a good combat heal most of the time.<P>Generally, the only heal spells I use are cheal and heroic bond. I'll also use remedy when I don't have time for a cheal, but people I group with are pretty good at managing aggro, most of the time. I keep celestial memmed for those annoying situations where you really want to cheal two different party members, but only have time to cheal one safely.<P>Aiien.</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#f7f7f7"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Dolfar</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">WOW! all i got to say is that if you let your Chanter go down nuff to where you got to C heal them, you got problems and should prolly invest your time in another class. Even a Chanter with 3k hp its not worth C healing cuz he dont have the ac he might as well have 1k hp. I'm sorry I never have and can say I will most likely never C heal a caster.

I've been put into mostly enchanter groups at raids for months.  They don't die in my group, I make sure of that.  They never panic either, some even request me for their group.  The enchanters I work with are top class.  Each of us are confident in the others' ability so we work well as a unit.  If they spend a fraction of their attention on their own hp, then I feel I've failed.<P>That's not to say I always use ch when healing an enchanter.  I was giving an extreme case that some of us don't always use any spell in by-rote situations.  Maybe 2-3 times I've done it out of thousands of heals on enchanters. :P  The situations called for it.<P>I can do a world of healing with "10% gtg", I think my time invested as a cleric wasn't wasted.  <IMG SRC="http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/wink.gif"></FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#f7f7f7"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Aerie</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Speaking from my cleric-who-plays-enchanter point of view:<P>-Say I am getting a CHeal from a cleric in a pick up group. Then I'd be <B>mortified.</B> It's a fairly good bet I would live through, provided I am not tanking some uber Velious mobs.

I would still question the use of CHeal - because it's not something I normally would have done as a cleric.<P>-In the same situation, I am getting a CHeal from a cleric who I have known for long time to be an excellent cleric and generally has a good grasp of the situation. You can bet I would never question her choice of heal, even if her gamble doesn't pay off. Why? Because I think if I were in her shoes, I probably would have thought CHeal was the best spell to cast too.<P>Oh, and the key is to cast CHeal when they just start getting beat up, not when they are three bubbles down.  <IMG SRC="http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/tongue.gif"></FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#dedfdf"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Caleal</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">I use CH on enchanters a lot.

At least this is true in ToV. <BR>So, if I have an enchanter thats buffed up to 3500-4000 hp and he gets smacked around for 2-3k damage in the couple of combat round he has agro, he better go stand around a corner out of the AE because I'm gona use CH on him. =)<P>------------------<BR>Caleal P`Terak<BR>BATTLE CLERIC of Innoruuk<BR>Cazic-Thule server<BR>Officer, Shadowed Soul</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#f7f7f7"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Dolfar</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">But the time you waste on C healing a chanter, could mean another persons death.
