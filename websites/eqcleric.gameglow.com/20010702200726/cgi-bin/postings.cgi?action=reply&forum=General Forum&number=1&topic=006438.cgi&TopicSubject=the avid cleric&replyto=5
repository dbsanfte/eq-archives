[B]Sorry bud, but ignoring the rare case (a Cleric with Dawnfire), your melee days really should be ending around level 14.  Oh, feel free to keep the skill up (never know when you might need it), but in a group your bread and butter is healing, stuns, and nukes.

And FWIW, until they raise Cleric caps to 200 and give us Double Attack it's pretty silly to melee.  It can be fun, but it's not efficient or productive.  Fun can be good though.

At level 11 you will do just as good as any other level 11 out there in melee.  Just be aware that at 13 warriors get dual weild, then double attack at 15 and that should seperate the melee from the priests.<P>I personally put my weapon in the bank at 50.  Nice springwood club, still sitting there too.  Should I have the time, mana and desire to melee, I summon a handydandy hammer and plink away.  I hit a suit in WL for a whooping 9 yesterday!

What do you all think?</B><HR></BLOCKQUOTE><P>Better than paladins at the same level? *snicker* Maybe at level 1, when we a cleric can outdamage a warrior based solely on the fact we get Smite and they don't.<P>We get capped at 175 in 1hB. Paladins can go to 225 I think. It effects the frequency drastically. Moreover, they spend their lives building melee skills. I'm level 57 and I still haven't maxed melee skills (tho my new Dawnfire is helping out there).<P>What makes us inferior is that we don't get any extra melee skills. Stuff like bash, parry, riposite, double attack and even the mostly useless disarm. We have 3 combat skills as opposed to the paladin's 6 (remember to add 2h piercing in).<P>But I digress... we're not useless meleers. We're just not useful either. My Dawnfire makes me useful in melee but how many clerics have a Dawnfire? Maybe 1% on every server? I still miss about 30-50% of the time and when I do hit it's seldom for full. And without those extras I get clobbered. Our role is healing, which requires mana and I seldom am at full mana these days (it takes a LONG time to get back around 3k mana, even with C2) so most people see a meleeing cleric as not knowing their role and thus often react with anger and insults (ie "You're a bad cleric!") because if they die, they will often assume it was because you were meleeing instead of medding.<P>The bottom line is this... if Verant gives us some improvements (more defense, higher 1hB and dodge cap, bash, etc) then and only then could you even begin to make a case that our meleeing makes a difference. But until then, my wiffing with an occasional hit isn't a good tradeoff for being OOM.<P>------------------<BR>Boanerges Thundercry<BR>Erudite Templar of Prexus<BR>Cohort Chalybeius<BR>Cazic Thule Server</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#dedfdf"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Mirriana_00</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">At level 11 there also isn't a huge difference between medding and just standing around.  When you hit 55, it takes 15+ minutes to med back from full.  I've never timed it, but I'd guess it would be 45+ minutes without medding.<P>I know if I ran OOM because I was ineffectually fighting and not medding and someone died, I'd feel horrible.<P>As has been said in every thread like this before, enjoy it while it lasts.<P>I even meleed up to 33.  I'd just channel out a DD while the mob was beating on me.  It added some damage.

I don't know if it's my level or because I have read a lot about Clerics/seen a lot of them in action and took pointers, but I am usually Full Mana in my groups.  Unless of course we get an overpull and I switch into stunning/rootparking mode.  When I am FM I go into melee (138 offense/111 1hb skill) and can actually put out a bit of damage.  Against mobs around level 30, 11pts of damage here and there can make a difference.  It's also helping me keep my skills up to a fairly reasonable level.  It seems my nukes are pretty mana inefficient, and my groups seem to care less if I melee than if I nuke  <IMG SRC="http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/smile.gif"></FONT></TD></TR></TABLE>
