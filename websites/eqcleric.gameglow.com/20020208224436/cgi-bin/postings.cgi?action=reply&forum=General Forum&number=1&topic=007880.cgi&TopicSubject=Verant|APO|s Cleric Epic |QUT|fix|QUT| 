This camp time did not include the camp time you had to spend with cleric before you in line. Prexus was honoring the camp as long as you were in zone and in line.<P>After the patch the Wednesday before last, they moved Zordak in Sol B to an easier location but didn't really change spawn time as they had stated in patch message. It took the cleric before me a little over 3 days and it took me 79 hours and 30 minutes. The Sol B Zordak was just Human merchant that trades old pearl (was old trigger piece) for a new swirling pearl. Zordak poofs as he gives you pearl and says he will return from Skyfire to kill blah blah blah...So then off to Skyfire where the new aggro version of 55 Zordak merchant spawns...He aggros on anyone that gets too close and has kinda large aggro range from reports. Once killed he spawns into Ragefire (fire dragon like Naggy with same loot). Kill Rage and get Naggy random loots plus new last piece for epic...Zordak's heart container that is just no drop. You must then place swirling pearl into container and combine for Zordak Heart which must then be turned in to Omat in TD. Omat give cleric final orb...3 orbs then make clicky stick...56 rezzer.<P>The ugliness has already started...Only three clerics had swirling pearl on Prexus when I wrote this message...Glorund, Dourgas and me.   Dourgas managed to stay on camp after he completed Sol B part...Early Friday morning around 3am...Dourgas killed and got container...combined into heart...yeah Dourgas! Glorund and I weren't bothering to camp yet. Glorund had posted on Prexus that he was planning to camp this weekend and I was planning to be away this weekend so no prob there. Problem is another cleric  decided since no cleric was there to claim camp,  she would camp SF for Zordak even though she has no pearl ready to combine. Some might say well she is just gathering parts for her epic well let me put it this way...Anyone can loot this container in SF as is now. A level 1 cleric from an uber guild could plop is ass down and camp...call uber guild in for strike and loot container...as cleric is just collecting pieces for epic. This cleric told me she was camping because Verant's poor programming has allowed her to do this. What a weak minded answer...That really got me pissed after having spent 79+ hours to be told so sorry Verant's error allows me to do this...<P>This is so wrong to clerics who are doing raid in order and have spent countless hours in Sol B already. Verant has now made the one old hell camp into 2 hell camps with a FCFS setup in the making. This container must be made NO RENT as a start...Another better change would be to make Zordak triggerable like druids Fay... ie Give the swirling pearl to human Zordak in SF...he gives back and Ragefire spawns to try and eat you...like Fay. Lastly and least preferable would be to also remove all dragon loot except NO RENT container. <P>There is nothing wrong with having to camp in line with epic ready clerics on last piece. A no rent container would almost assure this to be the case. Please tell your friends and ask them to let thier guilds know we must stop this FCFS mentality before it makes for more chaos and hate in the game. Have them flood /feedback channels with demands that Verant make changes....Petition and ask GMs why they aren't fixing this problem before it really gets ugly. <P>Thanks for your time and I hope I didn't rant too much but yes Baggy is upset by this...<P>Bagst Spiritmaker<BR>Sword of Fate member<BR>Prexus</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#f7f7f7"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Ketocon</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">this has been said quite a few times<P>VI made the 2 zordaks so if someone fked you over you didnt have to start all over<P>im pissed that they did this .. i was next in line to camp ragefire<P>------------------<BR><A HREF="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=22924" TARGET=_blank>Ketocon</A><BR>56 Templar of &lt;The Haven&gt;<BR>Karana Server</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#dedfdf"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">JanSorensen</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">I am sorry - but I cannot really see why you should need the pearl before the container. You dont go around saying people need to camp Bergurgle before they get a note from the Overking either.<P>I think its fine that you guys have a list - but the way you put it none of the 2 next on that list were willing to camp when their turn was up - so someone else started the camp. Do you suggest that Ragefire just be left up until the next one was ready to camp effectively delaying everyone in getting their epic? Thats not quite clear to me I admit. If anything I assume the 3rd person on your list should have stepped up immediately and gotten the camp as you and the first person on the list were unable to start.<P>I understand your frustration - but not fully your logic I fear.<P>------------------<BR><A HREF="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=4264" TARGET=_blank>Mikar of the Nexus</A><BR>High Priest of Brell<BR><A HREF="http://companions.windsofstorm.net/" TARGET=_blank>The Companions</A><BR>The Tribunal</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#f7f7f7"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Tarf02</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Here is my New Ragefire experience.  Cleared a few Fire Giants, logged by RF's spawn spot.  Logged in a few hours later and turned in.  Wen to sleep the other night, got a phone call that rage was up, logged in.  No one I knew online.  Shaman sends tell to a friend, offers their guild dragon loot if we get heart.  Sure, they come over and we kill him.  When I got to Skyfire, there was me, 2 guildmates and one other person soloing in SF that didn't know RF popped there till much later on.  Now, while we were buffing others came, including another cleric, but we were in force by then.<P>so, really, for me it worked out pretty well.  I camped rage for under 5 minutes.<P>However, I am pretty sure of a few things.<P>1).  Ragefire will not be done in order.  He will be killed first, since it is the worst bottleneck.  As many others have said, this is fair to those who haven't started their epics yet, unfair to those who are almost done.<P>2).  Rage will be farmed for dragon loot.  he is still extremely easy to kill.  Easiest dragon by far.<P>3).  You can camp Naggy's room.  You can't camp Skyfire.  People don't respect camps, and get in big disagreements about the named cycle there.  Are there going to be 'epic' fights over spawn in Skyfire?  You bet.<P>In any event, I agree with Bagst.<P>I would like to see:<P>1)  a trigger like Faydedar.<P>2)  Removal of dragon loot like Faydedar<P>3)  A no rent heart<P>Those three things would eliminate a bunch of problems necessarily associated with the current set up.  Obviously, if you don't think the quest should have to be done linearly, then you will disagree.<P>good luck all<P>Tarf</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#dedfdf"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Valya</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">For the paladin epic there are several stages, the main "bottleneck" is the dragon books which are combined as part of the Fiery Avenger.  You need a Fiery Avenger to move forward on the quest, but it is not the "last" step, there are 3 other drops to get. One of these drops is rather rare & difficult to get (a sword from the Keeper of the Tombs, a 7-10 day spawn in the Tower in the Hole).  There has been for years annoyance with those paladins who kill the Keeper of the Tombs before they surmount the "bottleneck" of getting their Fiery Avenger because it "wastes" an epic piece.  Yet I don't know a paladin who would turn it down if no other paladin who needed it was on a raid where the Keeper happened to be up. That's how I got mine, which is currently "wasted" in my bank while I try to get a nag book, my last bottleneck...<P>The complaining has died down now that the quest has been in place a while and the bottleneck has worked itself out a bit through time, hopefully that will be the case here too.</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#f7f7f7"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Twinskey Bab0linskey</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Why the comparison of cleric epic to FA is wrong;<P>1) Cleric epic > FA<BR>2) Cleric > Paladin<BR>3) There's gotta be atleast 10 other weapons better then the FA for paly's.<BR>4) There's atleast double the number of cleric's to paladins in the high level game.
