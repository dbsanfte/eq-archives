<TEXTAREA NAME="EditedMessage" ROWS=10 COLS=45 WRAP="VIRTUAL">Wow, this thread is really old. But I suppose it's been "rekindled" and I have a few cp to contribute.  :)

It seems that I'm only one in a handful of clerics out there who actually enjoy having more than one cleric or healer type in the group when i hunt, particularly the more risky areas.

Example: I remember being something like lvl 22 or 23 or so and not having greater healing yet. My group (most were a couple lvls higher than me) decided that cazic would be fun. The number of mobs we had to take and the healing required would've been WAY too much for me. I was so thankful I had another cleric who had ghealing in the group to heal and let me serve as backup and buffer. That was the first time I ever grouped with another cleric. It worked reasonably well because neither were oom at the end of the mass mob massacre, and we were able to kill a steady stream of mobs without having to wait on either of us to med. Also, having hotkeyed emotes for who you are healing and with what healing spell makes it a lot better too. That way there's no confusion who you are healing and very little duplication. 

On a side note, this would be nice for druids to make too. Druids also have to calm down and let the clerics do their job. I have been in so many situations where it's not efficient for me to gheal but the druid feels it is their duty to gheal instead of letting me sheal. So the druid jumps the gun and i sit there at fm telling the druid to not worry about it cos i've got it covered n' that if i need help, i'll ask for it... and yet the druid goes again and heals.  :p 

In terms of meleeing post-30, I've gotta tell ya. I really stopped meleeing between 20 and about 35, I believe. Then I hit HG's in Rathe Mtn and lemme just say, I gained 50+ 1hb points meleeing there and now my 1hb is maxed. Fear kiting rules with a druid/ranger in the group. I have even dubbed my melee as "Naladot" because I am just that -- a dot. I don't do much damage in any one swing (have the Velium Etched Stone Mace that initially hit for 15 and now for up to 20 a pop) but over time, I can do a great amount. Plus, it's better than me sitting on my butt medding the entire fight while at fm or wasting my mana on dd spells that can be majorly resisted (imo, you never know when you will need mana to heal, root, atone, whatever). Another perk has been that I am always next to my tanks and don't get the stupid "your target is out of range" and can always recast inspire fear on the giants when it wears off. 

When I am the only cleric in the group, I'll tend to sit down n' med while the tanks have a go at the mob. I'll heal, buff, etc. If, however, I'm fm and sitting there doing nothing n' their health bar isn't decreasing too much, I'll join in on the fun. I think they realize by then that I have made sure the situation isn't risky, I don't need to med all the time, and they can trust my abilities and judgement (heck, i've had a warrior friend tell me once that he hasn't looked at his health bar in ages because he trusts me THAT much). I did this just yesterday in solb and got no complaints from my group.

Another point (and this is only imo), even though i'm now lvl 43 and have CH, I still prefer to gheal and sup heal. I have not been in a situation requiring CH despite us going after all sorts of higher mobs than I would otherwise not take (my guild groups quite a bit so our groups usually range from lvl 42-51 and the mobs are usually chosen so all can benefit with exp and/or drops) and I have not grouped with another cleric for help with healing in a while. Sure, CH is more efficient, but if you time it wrong, you end up healing your tanks' corpse and rez'n yourself and your group. CH is a great spell... I personally just haven't come across the situation where it is better for me to use CH than gheal/supheal.

That's it for me. I feel like I wrote the great american novel (god, this is long), but these are my opinions about grouping and healing with and without other clerics.
