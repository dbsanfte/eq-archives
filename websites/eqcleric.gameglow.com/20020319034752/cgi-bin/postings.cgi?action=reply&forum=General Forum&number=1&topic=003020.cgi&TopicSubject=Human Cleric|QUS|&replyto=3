Small armor is far easier to come by, weighs less, and High Elves have their choice between small and medium.  They also have Infravision.  They have a far easier time having enough mana due to their high wisdom.  It is far easier to add 5 Strength than it is to add 3 Wisdom.<P>Humans are a bit blind.  As a Human I have run from a small tree at night thinking it was a cyclops and run into a cyclops thinking it was a small tree.  No night vision is truly painful when you have to hunt undead at night.  Humans have a maximum of 110 base Wisdom.  Humans can only wear Medium armor.  The exception to the armor is the quest armor which is the same weight as small plate.  For the rest, I don't think the extra 5 or 10 Strength is worth the extra weight you end up carrying as a Human.  I play a Human Cleric, but have a lower level High Elf that I tried out.  The High Elf was far superior.  The main thing was that the High Elf had the mana to finish the fights, not just get most of the way through them before running dry.  Unless you can twink hard, I would say go High Elf or Dwarf.  Since you don't want a Dwarf, then I would say High Elf.  Dark Elves are nice, but the Clerics have a lot of extra work to do on faction.  Halflings are nice also, but the armor for females is often off.  The feet of the Halflings can be a bit embarassing.  To me, the naked feet are a bit of an added pain when you die.  It might be untroubling to some, but death is annoying enough without that to me.  <IMG SRC="http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/smile.gif"><P>Gnomes are both weak and the lowest base wisdom that you can get.  The Ultra vision might be nice though.<P>Primarily, skill will help, but stats will limit you.  Dwarf Clerics should have all their points put into Wisdom, and the other 5 put into Agility or Strength.  All other races should put all point into Wisdom, and the other 5 left over put into Strength.  Some people will disagree with me, but that is my very strong opinion.<P>It seems to me many Clerics get discouraged at about 20 and 30.  I will tell you some things to help you get through.<P>Clerics have a very hard time from about 19 to 23 and 29 to 33 due to having no greater spells than Druids or Shamans, and not having Spirit of the Wolf.  Once you hit 34 though, you have Superior Healing.  600 hit points for 250 mana as opposed to the 300 hit points for 150 mana of Greater Healing.  That is 1800 hit points healing for the price of 1500.  When you hit 39, you get Complete Healing.  400 mana for however much damage someone has taken.  So if you do a 1,000 point heal, you are about even with a Superior Healing.  Any damage over 1 k is all cake.  A level 45 Warrior has so many hit points, and are so hard to hit that they can live a long time getting pummeled.  Better, they get harder to kill below 35% health, where others get easier to kill below 35%.  This will let a group with a 39+ Cleric and a 40 ish Warrior kill often even if the Cleric doesn't have Clarity.  Some Clerics here have posted about healing their Warrior after multiple pulls rather than healing them and then regaing the mana for the next pull like everyone else has to.  I have done this and had more mana at the end of a fight than I started with.  Complete Healing is the thing that sets us apart from any other Class.  Not Resurrections, not four stuns, not our armor (it doesn't help that much really) and not any bonus to our Healing abilities.</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#f7f7f7"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Yelien</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">I made a high elf cleric.

Personally I chose the character that looked the most Noble, apart from that tarty appearance in Banded or Chain (Bleh!)<P>Human clerics are perfectly feasable. I've made it to 178 Wisdom, AC 806 Self-Buffed, +95 mana. Strength is a bit low still, at 92. (Only strength item is the mask). I consider myself somewhat underequipped for my level, but I am very happy with my belongings.<P>I still need some Efreeti boots, a Girdle, Ivanders hoop and maybe a range slot item and I'll be kicking into the magical 200 and still enjoying that high necked solid metal look that typifies us humans.  (running around in the gold with black breastplate at the moment - looks very nice and formal, but I haven't set foot in the planes yet)<P>Night vision is mainly a problem in the Karanas when it starts raining. There is that Serpent Sight band from the High Shaman in Sol B, but that needs about 3 or 4 30's to do safely. You will need to lose a +6 wis ring, though, any time you use it, so you swap it on and off as required. I camped him on Sunday Night (3 people in Sol A - 49, 45 and 51st) for about 3 hours until he popped and dropped it. I understand they are about 500 plat.<P>For the previous levels, I've been using a Lightstone, a Screaming mace and a Charred Guardian shield which are all light emitters (but the effects don't multiply together)<P>I've found human clerics tend to be a bit of a Armour over wisdom cleric, party due to the extra strength and partly from necessity.<P>If I had to start again, I would still be a human (110 wis / 85 str), but I'd also be tempted to go Gnome or Erudite(!), just to be different from most other people out there.<P>Oh, and I have *never* had a group complain about my setup, although about 14 levels ago a Snooty High Elf said that with all that armour I shouldn't hit my 'Cleric under attack' button, and just soak up the attention of the Cavalier and his wizard friend.<P>Jimette<BR>49th Human Cleric and Splitter of Frenzied Ghouls<BR>Bertox<BR></FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#dedfdf"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Hinanar</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><BR>There's nowt wrong wi' a human cleric - apart from they're so big it's a wonder they kin walk at all wi'out tripping up.<P>If you are not that bothered with stats, try a gnome cleric.

Living a long and healthy life to 50, I realised that 125 base wisdom was lill´ high (lotsa wis-items out there). <BR>The fraction was nice (more areas where you can move freely, than if you would choose an evil race/diety)<BR>Lots of stat points on high-elves are "wasted" into high charsima and int. Would be nice to move those points to the physical stats.<P>So on my second char i chose a halfling:<BR>Better base strenght (you can carry more ph@t l3wt :P  ), better base stamina (woohoo, more hitpoints - YOU need em!), and better base agility (ya ya... just a few more AC, but everything helps).<BR>On the other hand I lost 10 base wisdom (only at 115 with the halfling), and I lost a heck of a lot int (below 75 base), and a #Q¤%¤&¤%# load of charisma (hey - every cleric should have an enchanter friend or 10 anyways).<BR>Halflings got infravision too.<BR>Halflings got pretty good fraction (not WOWWOW, not BOOHOO).<BR>Halflings can only use small armour (not that big a deal, since the market is floated with that sutff on all servers).<BR>Halfling can use Ivandyrs hoop(High elves cannot).<BR>Halflings start in the best newbie-zone in the game... and they can move directly to wisphunting after lvl 10.<BR>Halflings got warm feet - even in premafrost : )<P>I would sincerely reccomend a halfling for your cleric.

I think Erudites, Gnomes and Humans can be "good" or "evil". Dark Elves are evil, the others are good.<BR>Then halflings can hide and sneak, dark elves can hide, gnomes can tinker, these are important abilites. Hide is cool if you need to rest invis, cause we cannot invis. Sneak is great to deal with NPCs (buy/sell) and can also be used to actually sneak (hehe, hard but possible). Tinkering can be fun if you like trades and toys. Few of the things you'll make will be useful too.<BR>Then comes the look. High elves and dwarves look awful, must be to counter their awesome stats. The other races look cool to very cool in plate (erudites have a very unique look).<BR>Items and quest wise I think humans are the best for now.<BR>I'm human, and if I had to reroll my char, I'm not sure if I'd go for human again, I like gnomes and halflings (gnomes are cooler but halflings have better stats/abilities). Then dark elves / erudites are nice also.

The biggest advantage you'll have as a human is the increased strength. However some people always seem to think that not having night vision is a horrible detrement. Let me tell you it's not that bad. And you have a spell to summon a light source should you need one.<P>Erudites are more common thanks to Paineel and it also gives you the option of being good or evil. Erudites are pretty much on par with High Elves with stats (except int, which is a bit higher for Erudites). The biggest problem is str, which makes watching what you wear important.<P>The final argument for humans or Erudites is that you have no exp penalty.<P>The bottom line is that humans and Erudites are quite viable as clerics and not having night vision isn't as bad as some make it out to be.<P>Just my 2cp..<P>------------------<BR>Boanerges Thundercry<BR>Erudite Cleric of Prexus<BR>Proud member of The Steel Wind<BR>Cazic Thule Server<BR><p>[This message has been edited by Boanerges (edited 05-30-2000).]</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#dedfdf"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Yelien</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">If i had to do it again I'd choose an erudite(sp?) cleric and dump all bonuses into strength.<P>Yelien 10th High Elf cleric on Xegony</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#f7f7f7"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Luthian</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Hey, what's the problem here with High Elvies?  I picked one because of a combination of high wisdom, infravision, and looks.  Personally I like the looks of the High Elf and enjoy playing one.  I mean the tall, slender, graceful looks of the HE add to the mystical, etheral, almost angelic  look that really suits the cleric to me. And I like being other than paladins the only HE around wearing armour.  The one big drawback is clad in leather everyone used to beg me for SoW!<BR>When I created my character I put 10 points into strength.

IMHO HE clerics look awesome in the golden armour.<P>Luthian<P>23rd level Priestess of Tunare<BR>BristleBane Server<P>'Faith manages...' </FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#dedfdf"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Yalla</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">High Elf = Stats<BR>Dorf = Ugly<BR>Human = ok stats with badass items<BR>Erudite = same as Human<BR>Dark Elf = ok stats, ok armor, mainly for looks and roleplaying<BR>Basically, it's your choice.<BR>I dont see that many human/erud's on my server, mainly just dorfs, which pisses me off.

I only put 3 points into it. The rest of my points went into STR and STA. The only time I really ever had a encumberance problem was when I was in full bronze, which is not really necessary anyway.<P>Personally, I woudl recommend one of the lesser-used cleric races. Halflings I think get superior racial abilities and have nice skills.<P>Another fun choice would be a gnomie. I like the Erudites too. (Well, only the good ones.)<P>------------------<BR>Alliliel Archfalcon<BR>Cleric of Tunare<BR>Consul of Initiates<BR>The Sisters of Virtue<BR>Tunare Server</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#dedfdf"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Halstrom</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Having a 41st level human cleric, I would say I have some experience.<P>The Vision Thing: Get Lightstone or a GSL or a magical item that acts as a GSL.  The first few levels are gonna suck, but you will get over it.  Glowing Band is a nice item (Serpent Sight) which I use. At 14th, you can cast Halo of Light.   One thing not mentioned here is simply ask a magician for a heat or coldstone. I still do this at 41st so I dont have to change out a Jasper Ring.  Hunt in  dungeons since most of these are light up nicely and XP is better anyways.<P>Wisdom:  Max it out (110) and dump last 10 points in strength.  This way you can actually wear armor (unlike a wimpy high elf at low levels). Yes it will be harder to get your wisdom to 200, but you can do it and frankly you should wear AC armor as well. I can get mine to 195, but keep it at 191 so I can wear a high AC breatplate (Blood Stained Tunic collecting dust).  One insight spell by a 39+ Enchanter and poof!  201 Wisdom. Going by the eqcastersrealm's mana calculator, the difference in mana at 50th level between 200 and 180 (a good goal for human clerics) wisdom isnt even a Superior Healing. So dont obsess over wisdom like most people do.<P>Religion.  I would suggest Rodcet Nife due to the Aegis of Life quest.  But now the quest is so nerfed this isnt a big deal. I picked Mithaniel Marr and was regretting it but after I saw the Defense of Marr shield on EQ'Lizer I am VERY glad with my choice.<P><BR>I love playing my human cleric and unlike others wouldnt go back and make a dwarf or high elf cleric. This game is not just about stats but also role-playing what you like, style and uniqueness.  With enough hard work, any race can make a good cleric (even a gnome).<P><BR>Haldraeger Holychampion, Cleric of Mithaniel Marr, Saryrn Server.<P></FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#f7f7f7"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Lynet</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">I would wander over to the fashion table on allakhazam's web page and look at what banded, bronze, the clerical quest armor, and ethereal mist armor look like on the various races.  <BR> <A HREF="http://everquest.allakhazam.com/" TARGET=_blank>http://everquest.allakhazam.com/</A> <P>From there the choice should be obvious, and you will become a high elf.<P>Lynet on E'ci</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#dedfdf"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Urijah27</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Something that hasn't been mentioned yet is the equipment flexibility you get at later levels when you start with a high wis.<P>I chose high elf, and I am at a point now where much of my wis gear has been traded out for AC, hps, and mana.  Other races do not have this advantage since they must work fairly hard just to max their wis.<P>I have traded out my earrings with black sapphire, my CGS with Clay guardian shield, wis rings with plat fire opal, etc.  <P>When you start with a high base wis, you will give yourself much more flexibility at later levels with equipment.  <P>And remember... a cleric is only a caster in platemail  <IMG SRC="http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/smile.gif">.. dont worry too much about str, dex..and not even agi or sta too much.  Agi only marginally helps AC after you pass the magic 75 barrier..and dex really doesn't help a cleric at all.  Sta is ok, but again not worth spending alot of points on.  <P>I would recommend a race with high base wis so that you can wear gear at higher levels that will help you more with AC, hps, and mana.<BR><P>------------------<BR>Urijah<BR>54 Vicar<BR>Lanys</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#f7f7f7"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Seolta</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Humans are the most balanced of the Clerical Races.
