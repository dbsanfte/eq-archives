<TEXTAREA NAME="ReplyMessage" ROWS=10 COLS=45 WRAP="VIRTUAL">[QUOTE]Originally posted by Boanerges:
[B]1. I don't see this as whining. At least not done properly. I read threads on Whineplay that were whiny but I don't see any real whining here. These are legitimate problems. If other classes were complaining about these same thing I don't think people would call it whining.

It never ceases to amaze me how when we ask for even the most trivial things it's always "stop whining". Some issues people seem to think we whined about...

Cleric Quest armor (too hard and too low in AC)
DA/DB still allowing us to be stunned
MoK (nerfed to useless)
any expansion cleric BP nerf
any mana regen requests (ie standing med)

There are people who seem to think we're just fine as-is and that "rocking the boat" would get us nerfed. Well, we didn't rock the boat and we got nerfed anyways. Other people rocked it for us. Now people are saying that if we keep pushing it we'll get the stick nerfed too.

But when exactly do you propose we ask for something to be fixed? This goes beyond the epic to the core of our class. I mean, we're not the only ones in fear of the nerf stick. Are we to allow ourselves to be Verant's doormat? The simple fact is the squeaky wheel gets the grease or replaced. The silent wheels just grind along, never mentioning anything until they totally fail. Rayne has always stood for cleric issues because we are the silent class for the most part. I, for one, will not sit by and watch us get brushed off.

2. The bulk of the fighting over Ragefire is NOT cleric vs cleric. In fact, I had some rather pleasant exchanges with fellow clerics while proceeding along the quest myself. The problem is, it's guild vs guild. While some guilds feel it's required, it most certainly is NOT and saying so to Verant WILL get it nerfed. Look at the track record here, people. Manastones, MoK... whether or not people were requiring them was irrelevant. Verant throught they were and that's all that was needed.

The problem is it's desirable period. It's the best cleric weapon in the game and one of the best stat items you can get. Regardless of how common it is, it's a status symbol. EM is common as crap now but it's also a rite of passage. Wearing the Holy Armor of Barney(tm) shows you have gone to a rough place and toughed it out to some extent because you HAVE to have a raid to get it. EM is still wanted by half the clerics on the server because it's good armor. All this despite Donal's and Velious offering better. The epic is no different. Heck, it could proc True North and there would still be fights over it. It looks unique and it has excellent stats. Why do you think guilds go after lesser epics with such fervor? 

I mean, I don't see shamen using theirs a whole lot but we spent time getting them theirs. I can't say I want mine any more than a shaman wanted his/hers. Theirs looks good too and offers exceptional stats. Who cares about the effect? We got them just the same.

Getting back to my original point... CLERICS generally don't fight over Ragefire. Cleric's GUILDS fight over them. I've actually been in tells with other clerics while fights raged around us. We were all shaking our collective heads at the mess. Because it wasn't JUST the cleric that lost, it was the GUILD.

Ragefire is no different than, say, the Dain, Cazic Thule, Yelinak, Trakanon, VS or any other uber spawns that often are contested. If CT ONLY dropped the cleric helm, would it meant that fights over Cazic would be caused by clerics too? Would it be a "cleric issue"? Would it be on OUR shoulders to fix? Of course not. Likewise, it's absurd to imply Ragefire fighting is caused and/or solved by clerics. 99% of the time it isn't. I seriously doubt most clerics out there have that kind of control. Apply your "you should be calm and rational and not fight" sentiments to Burgurgle and Gimblox. Those are places where the clerics are in total control. And yet, most of the time there is peaceful resolution there...

So yes, it's not Verant's fault. But seldom is it ours either. Verant's attitude is fitting, really. It's the same attitude they've had towards in-fighting all along.

3. Lists are a house of cards. All you need is a pearl, a willing guild and the attitude of "I need this more than they do" and it all comes crashing down. I'm glad newer servers don't seem to have this problem but I fear it is only a matter of time...
