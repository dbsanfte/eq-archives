<TEXTAREA NAME="ReplyMessage" ROWS=10 COLS=45 WRAP="VIRTUAL">[QUOTE]Originally posted by Chaocle-Saryrn Server:
[B]Recently I saw a post on a EQ site quoting some very wrong or misguided statements from Alan.  I would like to correct a few and ask for a nother look by the dev team.  First a bit about me.  I have a 56 cleric, I have nothing but Rage left to do for over 5 months.  I have spent a total of 436 hours camping Ragefire.  Twice to help others, and twice he was stolen after he spawned and another guild beat mine to the room.
"The only competition over Ragefire is by clerics. The issues that we were addressing were where two, three or more classes wanted to kill an epic NPC. The problem here is completely different. "

This is incorrect.  The last time I cleared FG there was a necro and a monk FD in the room AFK.  They were not even responding to camp checks and we had to spend about 2 hours clearing FG to find out it was camped by another class from uber guilds with a few extra computers.  Of course I know what you mean, you mean that no one else woudl kill Rage but a cleric not what I just mentioned, that is also not really accurate.  First, you must kill Nag to get Rage.  A dragon to get a dragon.  On our server Nag is not a priority.  Other classes will kill Rage to get their twink the heart.  The fact is that because you dont' have bottle necks early in the quest, this one is over camped.  Also, because of the other dragon loot he has, many uber guilds DO in fact kill him just for the cloak and armor.  So either way you are wrong.

"The Ragefire portion of this quest is not much different than other bottlenecks in other epic quests."
Wrong.  It is different.  What other bottleneck only spawns after you kill another dragon?  What other bottle neck is 72 hours per spawn?  What other bottleneck requires you to kill 12 fire giants to just see if the spawn is up?  What other bottleneck has monks and necros FD at the spot claiming it?  What other bottleneck drops armor and other items like Rage?  What other bottleneck doesn't have prior bottlenecks sufficient to keep the flow controlled up to it, and not a floodgate that ends with one spawn?  What other bottleneck can a FDer camp without risk?  What other bottleneck is a race by guilds?  
None.  Sure many bottlenecks share some of these attributes, but I submit that no others share them all.  Also, because of the server downtime, it is even worse.  Three times now YOU took the servers down without notice after I spent 48 hours on the camp.  What other bottle neck requires this kind of time, that is then ruined regularly by server downs?  And finally, Solb is without a doubt the buggiest zone in the game, no other epic bottleneck exists in a zone this buggy, from vid cards freezing or slowing, to corpse warping, to getting warped to the GM room.

"I have read all of the comments made about this issue. While I can see that this is a concern, the solution is that people need to get along. We can't control the fact that so many people feel that they need to get this item and are willing to screw with other people to get it. The two solutions to that are to just give one to every cleric over 50th level, or to remove (or nerf) the item. "

Wrong.  You have NOT read 'all the comments'.  That is unreasonable.  I suppose you may have read some or maybe most.  But from your lack of understanding, and the fact that every person I know has an opposing view, I doubt you read all of them.  The solution is that people need to get along, this statement is wrong.  That is not a viable solution at all, you can't only suggest people get along.  Even Verant has play nice policys, what you suggest here is get along, but we aren't gonna make you get along with reasonable guidelines.  You CAN control the fact that people are screwing people to get the item, you just don't want to.  The 2 solutions you offer are not viable solutions and you know it.  You then proceed to make non-excuses for not implementing viable ones later in the post.

"1. No. Nagafen isn't going to just kill himself. He is one of THE epic encounters for those that haven't purchased expansions, and he's not going to just off himself so a cleric can have an epic weapon. "
OK good don't let a dragon kill itself.  How about NOT weaving together 2 epic encounters in the same exact spot, where one can not even be killed by the same people that go after the other?  I can't even fight Nag at 56, yet I have to see him killed before I can kill the second epic encounter in the same exact spot.  And if Nag doesn't kill himself for Rage then why does Rage kill himself for Nag?  How is it different?  I should get screwed because some newbie twink needs CoF?  How is it different?

"It IS a timed spawn… Very similar to what you suggest."  No, it is not on a regular timer like many others, and it doesn't starting counting till a dragon dies (one that a 53 plus can't fight) and it isn't on 24 hour, or even a predicatble 72, and it doesn't start when servers come up like all other spawns.

"3. He is also triggered, just as you suggest. "  That just isn't fair, you know the trigger is what we are talking about, not the actual spawn.  The trigger is the problem.  You could make it double triggered.  I give him a pearl, he gives me another item, then Rage only spawns when he gets that item back.  If servers go out then that item will spawn him at anytime.  This would ensure the cleric really can own the spawn if the cleric really camps it.  If the servers poof or some other weird thing happens, then the only competition will be between one or 2 clerics not 50.

"4. This might be something that we could do. But you're slightly wrong, he is intimately linked with Nagafen, and moving him and changing this quest would require a rewrite, and might completely invalidate the existing quest."  Wrong.  Come on man we are not stupid.  You completely invalidatet he druid and ranger quest?  Or the warrior now that the dagger drop is less rare, is it totally invalid?  Did you break the game?  Of course not.  To say a change at this stage would be this strong is false and obviously false.  It might be a little work, but hey its an epic quest, it deserves to be done well and right.  You redid several epic quests in the past.

"1. Well, the fact that it could be considered the best available is, primarily, the cause of all of this conflict. You mentioned earlier (in part of your comment that I cut out), that you thought there might be 20-25 clerics waiting for this part of their epic on your server. There probably aren't that many of any other class working on their epic at all, in any stage, on your server. This indicates to me that the problem lies in the perceived value of the item, not in the quest itself. "  I don't consider it the best available myself.  I would rate the mage way above it, and several others.  The cleric item like all cleric power, is in the fact that is useful to a group not to the cleric individual.  That is also the source of much of the problem.  You miss one problem here, there are not enough bottle necks earlier in the quest.  The king should be on a 12 hour timer.  Or you should alter the trigger as I mentioned.  The reason the perceived value is high, is that it benefits others not the cleric.  If a mage get an epic the mage is uber not the warrior or a monk, this is not true for the cleric epic, if I get it, I benefit every other class, even if I don't benefit myself greatly.  The same is true somewhat with the enchanter epic.  

"But I think I agree that the final battle isn't nearly hard enough. However, increasing the power of this final NPC would not solve the issue at hand. "  Not fair at all.  No other epic fight is any harder, to threaten us with you got it too wasy now retoric is unfair.  What was offered was a trade off, make ours so much harder than the rest, but increase the spawn, its a tradeoff that should indicate how much the change is desired, instead you make it sound like you need to make it harder.  Not nice.

"2. Nagafen doesn't live long on many servers. But I can see the inconsistency in this issue, if nothing else. However, many clerics overcome this problem by offering to aid people to destroy Nagafen, and in a way this promotes the kind of thing we like to see in game. "  OK really confused, you want to see a 56 help to kill something that you changed the code on so he can't help to kill the thing he is helping to kill??  That is what Verant wants to encourage?  Sure I can buff and res people (I do this), but you really should not entwine 2 epic encounters that are otherwise totally unrelated.

"First, we can't be changing epic quests all the time to make them fit the current game. Just like any other content, these quests will get easier as time passes and players get higher level, better items and all that. "  You already have done changes to other epics, you have even supposedly fixxed bugs and things on Rage specifically.  We are not asking you change them all the time, just again.  Same as war, druid, ranger, necro, mage, etc.  How many times have I seen you come the the boards and say the opposite of this statement?  That you must change the game as the game changes?  A hundred? Two?  Isn't part of the vision that the game does change?

"The only solution to that would be to nerf the item, make it less desirable so that fewer people will be insisting that Clerics have this item. We've decided not to do that. "  That is not true.  You can solve the problem by adding a double trigger that would at least ensure a cleric only camps the item.  You can increase the spawn rate, you can undbind the rate with the nag spawn, you can allow both to live at the same time, or at least make Rage not die if Nag does, you can add a different trigger, you can make the FG kill those FDer campers, you can remove the dragon loot and make him like Faydedar and triggered, you can add an alternate method of completion, you can do a million other things besides nerf or remove.  That is not the only solution to any problem, you know that.

I was very bothered by your post overall.  It was untrue in several parts and showed a lack of effort.  I am not sure what else to say.  I have spent 5 months trying to get this item, I am in a guild capable of getting the item, but because of poor design and lack of thought, I would probably sell my account and quit tomorrow if it was legal.  I find the high end game for my class to be pitiful.  I find the desire to begin another class undesireable, because of the problems with the high end game on this one.  Oh well you have several thousand others so whats a few hundred unhappy players that alphaed, betaed, guided and bought your game?  Right?[/B][/QUOTE]
