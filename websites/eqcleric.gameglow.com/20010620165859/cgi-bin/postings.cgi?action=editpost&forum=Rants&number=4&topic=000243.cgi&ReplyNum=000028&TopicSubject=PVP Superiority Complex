<TEXTAREA NAME="EditedMessage" ROWS=10 COLS=45 WRAP="VIRTUAL">Kimbera, you show great courage to agree, but I wasn't pitching a new idea.  I said the same thing all along.  In my first response on this thread I stated,

"It really does make you a better EQ player if you can do all the things that anyone on a blue server can do, and you are excellent at PvP. How can that not be the case?"

That was long before I spelled out the postulate.  I was saying the same thing over and over and over, and finally one person came to agree with what I was saying from the beginning.  (After I had to spell out this mind numblingly simple notion that 1 skill + 1 skill = 2 skills.)

If I can do everything you can do AS WELL AS YOU, AND one more thing that you cannot do, then I must be a more skilled player.

Why we had to go back and forth arguing about that is beyond me.  Some of you still can't agree with it because it hurts your ego to give credit to someone you perceieve as cocky.

It's impossible for you guys to believe that someone can be a very social, likeable, skilled roleplayer, AND be a confident skilled player killer.  You have never seen it before, so it confuses you.

Kimbera, I agree with you about the superiority complex lowering the social skills of an EQ player (but only if the player is exhibiting such behavior IN GAME.)

If the superiority complex is ONLY found outside of the game context (like on messageboards), then it has NO bearing, on the social skill level of the individual IN GAME.  Do you think I would still be playing this game after 26 months if this was my in-game persona?

Snaggletooth bragging about how awesome he is in EQ (on a messageboard), and putting you down because you suck so bad at EQ, does NOT lower Snaggletooth's social skills IN GAME at all.  In fact, I have no characters named Snaggletooth, and I will not mention any names of any of my characters because those characters will not be punished for what I say on a public messageboard.

I never argued one way or the other about whether the superiority complex is moral or immoral behavior.  Obviously, it's not nice to act like that.  Do you really think I care if I come across as rude on an anonymous messageboard?  I don't feel a need to be accepted by a bunch of strangers.

My superiority complex regarding EQ comes from my belief that I am one of the best players ever to play the game.  Why wouldn't I be?  I've been playing since the game came out.  I have lots of characters on ALL types of servers.  I excel on non PvP and PvP servers.  I assume anyone can excel on non PvP servers since it's so easy.

At least in my case, the superiority complex is justified.  I AM superior to most players, expecially if you can't even PvP (arguably the most difficult EQ skill to master.)

It's completely absurd to believe that NOT having a certain skill somehow makes you a better player.  And that's exactly what you  are doing if you disagree with Snaggle's Postulate.  If you agree with Snaggle's Postulate, you reinforce my personal belief that I am better at EQ than all of you who suck at PvP.  Catch 22.</TEXTAREA>
