          <p><strong>DIRECTIONS</strong>:</p>
          <blockquote>
            <p>Head to Cazic Thule Dungeon in the Feerott.&nbsp; When you get to
            the ramp, instead of going up it, keep on going and follow the
            dungeon wall around (keep dungeon wall to you LEFT).&nbsp; Keep
            heading straight after the dungeon wall ends until you come to river
            (I believe this is south/sw).&nbsp; Swim across.&nbsp; When you get
            across, take a left and a very short distance is the zone wall. Keep
            zone wall on your left and follow it down a ways til you see a tree
            right there on the zone wall on your left.&nbsp; THAT is the fake
            wall and the entrance to the spectre cave.&nbsp; Just walk on
            through.&nbsp; The cave is pretty easy to follow.&nbsp; When you
            enter, as you walk up, there is sort of a circular area where to
            your right 1 or 2 spectres spawn.&nbsp; This is very very easy spot
            to pull from.&nbsp; If there are none there, follow the corridor in.&nbsp;
            It's very very easy, and not like the maze in cazic.&nbsp; The best
            thing is, when you see one, if you cast Fear on it, all you gotta do
            it is just get behind it and it will lead you out of the dungeon!!!&nbsp;
            No getting lost!!</p>

          <p><strong>HOW TO HUNT SPECTRES</strong>:</p>
          <blockquote>
            <p>Now, there is a BIG key to hunting these things safely.&nbsp;
            Just fyi, I soloed them yesterday morning for GREAT exps.&nbsp;&nbsp;
            Only high level casters can do this...tanks can't.&nbsp; It's your
            basic root and shoot&nbsp; routine.&nbsp; But the first thing you
            MUST do to get them out of the cave so their buds don't come running
            is cast FEAR on them, or Spook the Dead (whatever your lowest mana
            cost spell is). This makes them run outta the cave.&nbsp; As they
            exit the cave, ROOT them.&nbsp; Run a distance from them and turn
            and blast away with your highest undead spell.&nbsp; When they run
            towards you after root wears off, run away and turn and root again,
            then blast again.&nbsp; These things have about 1800 - 2200 hps.&nbsp;
            It takes me 2 - 3 Banish Undeads (585 dmg a pop) and a 2 - 4 Wraths
            (218 dmg a pop) to take them down.&nbsp; I do not recommend soloing
            them until you are level 44 with Banish Undead and Resist Magic and
            Resolution buffs.<br>
            <br>
            IMPORTANT THINGS&nbsp; TO KNOW TO HUNT SPECTRES:</p>
          </blockquote>
          <ol>
            <li>You must have SOW on at all times, otherwise you are gonna be
              one dead cleric.&nbsp; If you don't have jboots or someone that
              can SOW, you gonna be a hurtin.</li>
            <li>There is a relatively safe spot to med in between kills, or a
              &quot;camp&quot; spot to pull to if you keep going after you pass
              up the cave entrance on your left.&nbsp; It is a very very short
              distance down, and the zone wall ends there and forms a sort of 90
              degree corner, with the zone wall continuing. This corner is where
              everyone meds and camps.</li>
            <li>If you MUST run to safety, the zone to the Rathe Mountains is
              straight down the zone wall from that corner where you med (just
              keep zone wall on your left at all times and you'll come to the
              zone entrance).</li>
            <li>VERY IMPT:&nbsp; These spectres are sneaky.&nbsp; BEFORE you go
              into the cave to pull, to the left and up a tad from the safe
              corner med spot are some trees. Spectres, sometimes 3 at a time,
              will spawn here. (They KNOW we are sitting there in the corner
              medding..heh).&nbsp; Do NOT pull from the cave until you check
              this spawn spot, otherwise, you are gonna be in a world of hurt
              when you bring a spectre back from the cave and a couple of his
              buds behind those trees decide to come help him out.</li>
            <li>AVOID MELEE.&nbsp; You don't want these dang things within
              striking distance of you, or you're gonna go down.&nbsp; You
              simply can't tank them because of their spell that drains your
              life force and their hard hitting and stunning. This is why you
              must have SOW on, or jboots to be able to run from far enough from
              them so you can keep them rooted while you blast away.</li>
            <li>Keep yourself highly buffed at ALL times, especially with Resist
              Magic. I keep Symbol of Pinzarn, Armor of Faith, Resolution and
              Resist Magic on me at ALL times when hunting these things.</li>
            <li>If you have a tank with you, they can taunt and keep the spectre
              occupied (root doesn't become so impt then) while you stand at a
              distance and blast away.</li>
          </ol>
          <blockquote>
            <p>Hope this helps you guys out.&nbsp; As I said, I wouldn't attempt
            to solo these bad boys until I was level 44 with those good spells.&nbsp;
            They are perfect for what you need to hunt spectres.</p>
