At 39 I was doing the OT's after Dalnir, and right before I went to Sol B at 40.  When I was leveling Sol B and cetrain LG camps had people. When I have all day to play, I love to make the group.  Do a "/who all LFG 38 42" or so and "/ all friends" see if you  can't make a CoM, LG or CC group.  Once you have the chanter/bard (assuming your the cleric), the rest usually falls into place.[/B][/QUOTE]

I was hunting in Lguk, however, my method of playing doesn't work there.  I usually like to play once a week for a large block of time( like from 2:45 est when I get home till 11) and then just 2 or 3 hours a couple other days.  I find I can't get a group there at 2:45, so I went to DL.  Dreadlands is pretty good experience, but GOD does it get monotonous.  Not to mention the fact that I did LOIO and OT and am sick of  that type of hunting.  I'm wondering where else to hunt, I've heard Sol would be a good choice, or soloing specters in Feerot(boring as hell).  Any advice on this would be much appreciated<P>Also, when I hunt in the new Kunark and Velious zones, I kinda feel like I'm cheating, like I couldn't cut it in EQ "back in the day" even though I began playing before Kunark came out(a pally which I quit at level 19. I couldn't get used to the exp grind which starts to set it around 19.)  My question is, is for some reason, like underpopulation, it is now more difficult to exp in the old zones.  Again, thanks for any help here.<P><BR>Beldinn Mcfeldinn<BR>39 Cleric<BR>Inny server{yeah, it's hard to spell}<BR>Thanks again.   </FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#f7f7f7"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Kornaena</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Yes it is harder to exp in old world zones.  Cazic is only PL and farmers on my server.  Lguk has very few camps.  The area where the BE stuff drops is never camped.  That used to be one of best exp camps in the game on my server.  <P>What to do?  I soloed specs from level 36 to 44 on and off.  Is a single spec by a tree outside fear and 2 rigth inside the hidden wall to fear.  Also is oasis, but pulling singles is hard when full popped.  Sol b is also as option, can go all the way to level 60 there</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#dedfdf"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Naldar</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Sol B entrace area should be good. Try getting a group to City of Mist great exp there. The Orc fort in Eastern Wastes gives great experience also. Try Giants in the Great Divide. </FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#f7f7f7"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Jessamyn</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">I fought in SolB from about 37 to 46.  It's a great place to develop dungeon skills and it is usually pretty easy to get a group.  KPC or the window room are great camps for your level.  There are actually camps to get you well into the 50s.  (I went back at 49 to ding 50) and one of my guildies was getting exp still at 57.  Probably not much, but still... hehe<P></FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#dedfdf"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Xthor</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">I spent the late 30's and early 40's in Crystal Caverns in Velious.  It was a great zone, and you'd have an advantage in that you can deal with the Dwarven merchants.  I think in the late 30's, you'd want to be below the town, with Geos, Spiders, or Terrors.  Only problem might be getting groups, as I usually went with my normal group...not sure how many people you'll find in the zone to group up with.<P>Toward the end of our hunting there, we started seeing higher level people hanging out there camping geos for gem loot, and spiders for silk.  You might have some farmers hanging out there these days...I haven't been in in a while.<P>Xthor Mednheal<BR>53 Vicar<BR>Solace Keep<BR>Druzzil Ro<BR></FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#f7f7f7"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Allono</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Greetings,<P>You could also find a tank type friend to partner with and hunt in EW.  The Ulthorks are great xp.  The walruses will still be blue too.  I would avoid the Orc Fort there.  I died there soooo many times it wasn't funny.  All was well until an Orc Elite came out.  The only way that camp can be done is if you have a 45+ tank.  Several of them would be good.  Too many things go wrong.  Other than that.  The other suggestions have been good.  The spec in Feerrott is quite boring, but very good xp.  Also pretty good loot after you sell the scythes.  I did the camp with a Druid friend.  That way we could collect up a bunch of weapons and then they would go sell em.  Also, It is fun watching people assemble for a Fear raid there.  Can be annoying too when they ksteal your spec.  Heh ......Good luck.<P>Allono</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#dedfdf"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Andav</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><BR>You might try the entry area in the Frozen Tower of Iceclad. There are 2 Shades on the far side of the pit area. Stand just inside the entry area and root one of the shades. The other will come to you. If you drop all the way back to the room with the mirror the one you rooted will not come to you when root breaks. You can also fear them and they will run to the mirror. This makes them too easy to kill. I soloed here a lot from 40 to 43.<P>If you have neglected your Defense, let them beat on you a bit before fearing them. They do not hit hard and the extra AC is wonderful. I upped my Defence to 181 over the last few levels.<P>If you run to the left (hug the walls because the pit has 4 skellies in it and is very hard to get out of) there are other skellies to kill.<P>Stay away from the Shadow Beasts on the right side. They hit hard and have too many hit points.<P>Loot is also very nice. The Scythes sell to the gnomes for 11pp. Because I am a weakling High Elf, I destroyed all but the Regular Scythes. The Bronze only sell for 3pp. Not worth hauling to the gnomes.  <IMG SRC="http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/smile.gif"><P>While pickup groups are few, they will almost always love to have you come along either for your heals or your nukes.<P>It does beat the heck out of DL.<P>Andav<BR>Cleric of 43 Seasons<BR>Proud Officer Madcap Elite<BR>Tunare Server</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#f7f7f7"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Twinskey Bab0linskey</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">I gonna take the "Can't cut it" if you don't do old world dungons.

Find a partner (any class works) or do it alone.  The wolves have between 1k to 1500 hps.  Respawn rate is pretty quick.  It should move you along in levels nicely.  It'll also raise both your faction with Coldain and Claws of Veeshan.<P></FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#f7f7f7"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Josiefuz</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">I loved Guk from 37 (Paw greened out) to 50 (LGuk starts greening).  I took breaks from LGuk and did some Dreadlands from 40-47 and some KC from 45-52.  The important thing I believe is skills.  You won't learn any skills in Dreadlands, you will learn them in LGuk.  So mix it up a little, there are plenty of places to hunt in your 40's.<P>-Fuz<BR>58 Templar, Sol Ro</FONT></TD></TR></TABLE>
