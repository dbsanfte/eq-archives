[B]Kinda different fights... dain you obviously can't main tank.. CT you can, but hard, and Zland you can very easily.

350 dain is beyond wuss, so is Zland. Velk you can mess up all over the place and still win np. I would say kill those 3 first, then attempt CT once you've got the hang of healing.

350 dain/Zland/Velk while different fights, I would compare them all closely in difficulty. CT being a step up after that.

Oh, and Velk is by far the best mob to practice healing, aggro control and tank switching imo.[/B][/QUOTE]

We attempted the Dain a while ago and got him to about 30% (before we had figured out a main tank CHeal strategy). We can easily kill most Kunark mobs (all the outdoor dragons, Trak, VS, etc...yeah I know they're all old news which is why we are trying to figure out how to go about it now).<P>What would you guys suggest as a good uber-mob to try next, or a good progression to work on? We are thinking about attempting the Dain again, our necros are clamoring for us to try Zlandicar, others say we need to get more ToV armor first. Personally I want the halo off CT  <IMG SRC="http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/biggrin.gif"> Is Dain -> Zlandicar -> CT a reasonable/possible progression or am I completely underestimating one or more of them? If so are there any suggestions as to what we should concentrate on for now and what we can make an attempt on in the near future?<P>Thanks a lot  <IMG SRC="http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/smile.gif"> </FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#f7f7f7"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">JanSorensen</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Velketor<P>------------------<BR><A HREF="http://eq.castersrealm.com/players/view_profile.asp?Id=9406" TARGET=_blank>Mikar Vicarious</A><BR>High Priest of Brell<BR><A HREF="http://companions.windsofstorm.net/" TARGET=_blank>The Companions</A><BR>The Tribunal</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#dedfdf"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Caleal</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Velketor is great for learning agro control and main tank healing strategies. He hits hard and has a lot of hp, but is slowable. You can make tons of mistakes in the fight and correct them on the fly.<P>If you do PoG much, you can try fighting a trifling focuser. They don't hit very hard or fast, but they have >1 million HP, so its a very long fight. Goal should be to keep agro on 1 person the entire fight. <BR>You can also practice transfering agro from one tank to the next. Goal is to have it go from hitting one tank to the tank you want to pass agro too without hitting anyone else.<P>I recommended this to my guild some months ago, but they ignored me, so we learned agro control on Dozekar the Cursed and Vindicator...<P>If you want ST keys and decent loot, you can do Lendiniara the Keeper in ToV west. Its a very easy fight if you have good agro control and work out the healing on the MT. Its a total raid wipeout if you don't have good agro control or can't deal with the 300pt unresistable AE and dispell of top buff. =)<P>Different MOBs are different kinds of fights though. There are guilds that destroy Dain, but wipe out on Zlandicar and Velketor, or Destroy Yelinak, but level Dain and CT up repeatedly. My guilds current nemesis is Klandicar2. We are a +CoV guild but pharm Lendiniara the Keeper and Sontalak for ST keys.

Dain is still spanked fast on RN for his head, even though pretty much everything else is rotting. Velketor is pretty much 0 competition thing. Zlandicar is probably pretty popular as the easiest source of ST keys and CT drops good stuff for those who haven't farmed the hell out of him already (on RN atleast we've grown tired of PoF already so it's not too rare for CT to live for more than 24h).<P>-- Delheru Tanreall<BR><A HREF="http://www.ascentguild.com" TARGET=_blank>Ascent</A>, Rodcet Nife</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#dedfdf"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Haxx</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Kinda different fights... dain you obviously can't main tank..

And yeah the numbers are quite low, but atleast on RN situation is very different now than it was when we were killing stuff for the first time. First 425 Dain was a real bitch and I'm not even sure if ToV armor had been upgraded by then. Had like 45 people and had to res rush to a degree. Now even unguilded people have near full warlords for example and there's so many exquisite weapons and willsappers around that it's hard to believe.<P>Also I think posting the low numbers used is better for the raid morale. I used to check out how many FoH or whatever used and then aim for that, and if we had like double the numbers there was just NO reason to fail. In effect if I posted the double numbers I bet many people would be quitting after the first failure thinking 'uh they needed 40 people and we have 44 and they have much better gear, maybe it just won't happen', whereas if I post 24 there's very little excuse to give up with 44 =P<P>Oh and Innoruuk is so easy he doesn't count.<P>Also trying the 425 on your first attempt isn't necessarily wise if you don't have experience with Velious ubers.<P>-- Delheru Tanreall<BR><A HREF="http://www.ascentguild.com" TARGET=_blank>Ascent</A>, Rodcet Nife<p>[This message has been edited by Delheru (edited 09-20-2001).]</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#dedfdf"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Haxx</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">425 dain is *quite* a bit harder than 350.

I dont think anyone does on Saryrn.<BR>Time Sink > Loot Reward, so he is never even an option.<P>For us, Yelinak is the uber MOB.  Although we haved killed him albiet infrequently, he gets our goat a lot. Any advice be kind. His knockback sometimes causes both the main tank and cleric(s) to be hit, causing the main tank to go out of range (OOR). <P>ToV dragons not all that hard. Just main tank em, position close to the corner of a wall so casters can nuke em/hide from AE and clerics can heal tanks and be behind wall.  Not rocket science.<P>Cazic Thule is a blast to kill imo.  Main tanking is somewhat a challenge and alleviates the usual boredom of ToV because of his knockback and being in a open area.  Dain 425 is difficult but a wild and fun fight.  My analogy is Dain is like Sir Lancelot in Monty Python's Holy Grail going around slaughtering the villagers. <P></FONT></TD></TR></TABLE>
