<TEXTAREA NAME="EditedMessage" ROWS=10 COLS=45 WRAP="VIRTUAL">Actually The day after the epic quests hit I wrote that it was found and posted the quest on a board to a friends guild.  Now that I see this post here about it I will share my silliness with you all.  We all know the ups and down's of being a cleric.. (no pun intended, stand, cast, sit..) so I hope you enjoy it and if not no worries =).

Here yah go....

1) Go to the Cabilis and swim under the little dock area where the channel boat comes. As you swim you will go through a series of turns and then you can pop up for air in the middle of a tunnel. Swim back down and carry on to the next area like it. You will see a stone platform under the water.

2) Once you are there you need to sit on the platform. A fishbone earring or rebreather is needed for this as you cant get out of the water here and you will be sitting underwater most of the time. Eventually a Worn Tailbone Skeleton will swim by and you need to hail him to make him stop. He will speak about the Worn Tailbone Clerics and tell you that the Greater Worn Tailbone who passed on all of his knowledge to many. The GWT has been relieved of his duties and has been granted retirement. The GWT, although very happy with this, cannot rest. The WTB tells you that many wounded swim through these tunnels and asks you to replenish the health of all who pass. 

3) Next you need to sit there and be alert to all that swims by. You MUST target everything and heal it if it has the slightest bit of health loss. If you miss one or dont heal it to full before it goes out of range it gets upset and tells everyone else including the guards that you are a poor cleric. The guards of Cabilis will then be summoned to your spot and you will die almost instantly. They hit for mid 300's and are magic resistant.

4) Each time you heal an NPC it will pause and tell you thanks and go on thier way. They will usually spell thanks wrong as well. Occasionally you will heal an NPC and they will stop and bow and give you an Item. You need to gather the following items.

(1) Splintered Wooden Needle
(5) Thread of Pulled Hair (stackable)
(2) Washed Burynai Hide Pelts
(8) Griffon Feathers

Each time you get an item it triggers the next one to spawn. You will get them in that order. In addition all items are No Rent. Sometimes you are lucky and you will get 3 NPC's within a few minutes but some are up 3 hours. There does not seem to be any pattern in this as well. 

5) After you get the last Griffon Feathers the NPC will begin to drown. Let him die and cast the lvl 49 spell Ressurection on the corpse. At that time a Worn Tailbone Tailor will spawn. Give the Tailor the items you just got in this order 4 at a time..

--------------------------------------------
(1) Splintered Wooden Needle
(1) Thread of Pulled Hair 
(2) Washed Burynai Hide Pelts
--------------------------------------------
(4) Thread of Pulled Hair 
--------------------------------------------
(4) Griffon Feathers
--------------------------------------------
(4) Griffon Feathers
--------------------------------------------

Once you have done this The tailor will award you with a Pillow of Piety and tell you to seek the Greater Worn Tailbone and give him this pillow to help him rest.

6) Head ot the Temple of Solusek Ro zone in. Upon zoning in you must cast the Symbol of Naltron on every NPC in the Temple to get the GWT to spawn. You should have 38 periodots for this and maybe a couple extra incase you buff one twice. If you miss one don't worry, they will complain like crazy soon enough. The GWT will spawn on the rocks at the south end of the main temple room. Go hail him and he will tell you that h eis too exhausted and uncomfortable to speak any longer. It hurts greatly to sit any longer and he is unable to stand since he did not develop those muscles very well in his last 50+ levels. All throughout his life he was forced to sit and his legs became too weak and his tailbone has worn thin. At this point give him the Pillow of Piety. The GWT will stand up and sit back down and will smile. He will tell you how thankful he is of the gift you have brought him and he may now rest easy. To show his thanks he gives you your epic quest weapon and explains that this should help you from ever becoming like him.
