<TEXTAREA NAME="EditedMessage" ROWS=10 COLS=45 WRAP="VIRTUAL">woohoo this weekend I decided to take a trip to high keep. A friend of mine used to level in there when i was on prexus and i used to make fun of him cause he was inside this little room the entire time, well man do i feel silly  :) I was bored little level 22 in freeport and was wondering where to go to level so I decided to try it out. I get a group in the warrior room imediately cause they need a cleric bad. So i'm in there trying to keep up with 29th level warriors who are also pulling the raider room when things are slow, with heal:P i had good ole symbol of transnal to back me up too  :) But i also had this amazing enchanter and two mages with earth pets. I have never had so much fun in my life in EQ, constant mayhem, goblins all the time and random pops right in the middle of combat. After the first night there I leveled to 24 and had already bought all my spells, OMG Gheal is amazing!!! no more clickin heal 3 times to heal 2bubbles of my tanks health. 

So day two comes along and my big tank has to leave and i am left with this lower level tank who can't seem to pull things off the casters and me and we ask him what his taunt it at..... 40  :( so while the rest of the casters are laying into this guy with insults I calmly explain to him why he needs taunt and we proceed to make this little woodelf warrior a master taunter. I told him by the end of the time he groups with us he must have his taunt to 110 and i wanted constant updates and in between battles he was taunting the mages pets for fun. Needless to say by the end of the night his skill was a whoping 140 out of 145 and he is now a very competent warrior and on my friends list  :) 
There was this annoying mage and his little 6th level warrior brother who is killing prisoners for exp but is causing SO much trouble. He's basically getting babysat by the entire zone and when he's in trouble he runs down to us for help, bringing a nice long train of prisoners who in turn agro all the goblins onto us, then they start tell spamming me because I won't heal his little brother, meanwhile i'm trying to save my groups life from this little prick's train and almost dying myself.

buy the end of it all, which was last night at about 3 am I had gone from level 22 to level 27. More and more of everything you guys say on here is coming clearer everyday. I always had my buffs on the enchanter who then said I was the best cleric he'd ever grouped with, next to his wife of course  ;) I have lots of new friends who now know me as the resident cleric of high keep and in their words one of the best damn clerics they've ever had  :) I know have alot of High Quality ore which the groups let me have because i sit out on the fine steel weapons and have a bag full of blocks of high quality ore which I need to make human cultural armours and more importantly imbued armours.

all in all it was a good weekend  :)
