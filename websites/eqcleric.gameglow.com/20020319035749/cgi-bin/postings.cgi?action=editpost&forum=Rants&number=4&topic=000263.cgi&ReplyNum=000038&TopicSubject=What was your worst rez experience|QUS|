<TEXTAREA NAME="EditedMessage" ROWS=10 COLS=45 WRAP="VIRTUAL">My worst res experience happened saturday night.  And worse still, the culprit was a guildie and former rl friend.  

I was grouped with my usual partners, 55 chanter and 54 wizzie.  We were killing the vamps in the castle in TM on the balcony.  Due to assorted bad luck (like the mob grav fluxing us and aggroing the floor below) we had a large train and it took us a long time to deal with it. (about half an hour..well within the res timer) 

During the Big Train Wreck, I got a tell from a guildie who wanted a res in [b]Akanon[/b].  Now, I was really busy keeping the chanter alive and helping root mobs so he could mez them.  I did not have time for a lot of explaination.  So I told him I was fighting atm, and would get back to him.  

I am sure i missed some of his tells, since the battle spam was fast and furious.  I kept trying to update him 'still fighting...' 'hold on..' etc.  I know, not too articulate, but you would think he would realize I was busy.  

So as the fight is winding down, I am thinking ok, I can arrange for him to pick me up now, I get a really nasty tell from him that 'some cleric i dont even know came to res me.'

To top this off he has the gall to be angry at me for not leaving my group (also guildies) to die to the train so i could go res him immediately. Here is a lovely quote from his resulting post:  [QUOTE]I think it is a little inconsiderate to look at it from the point of "well I have 3 hours", [/QUOTE]
So let me get this straight, you think its [i][b]not[/b][/i] rude to put yourself before everyone else in norrath, including myself and my group?  Who also happen to be your guildies?  

This guy left the guild over the issue.  At first I was upset, then my guildies made me realize it is his problem and not mine.  He is the one who thinks it is my duty to res him within 5 min of his death.  He is the one who was inconsiderate. I would have been happy to help him, once I was assured the battle was won and my group was safe. Now, he will always have to look for another cleric.  I sure do not intend to help him.
