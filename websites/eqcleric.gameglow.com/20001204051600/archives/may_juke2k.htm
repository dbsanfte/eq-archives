            <BLOCKQUOTE>First the good:
              <UL>
                <LI>The time limit on resurrections is being increased from 2 
                hours to 3 hours. This is outstanding 
              news.<BR></LI></UL><BR><BR>Now the bad:
              <UL>
                <LI>Abashi finally responded to the nerfing of Donal's 
                Vambraces, commenting that it was unbalancing, yada yada yada. 
                Is it just me or are the effects mostly worthless? What level 
                52+ cleric (a reasonable level to obtain the arms) is going to 
                buff people with Valor unless given a compelling reason to do 
                so? They need to re-examine the effects on 
              Donal's.</LI></UL><BR><BR>Finally, the ugly:
              <UL>
                <LI>See the following thread: <A

                Yes, it's a whine, but the poster makes a good point: where are 
                the toys for the Int casters? Isn't it always nice to have nifty 
                items to look forward to obtaining? I think this post strikes 
                home with a lot of Int casters, and Abashi's answer was 
                extremely disappointing.</LI></UL><BR></BLOCKQUOTE>

            <BLOCKQUOTE>I want to express my extreme disappointment concerning 
              recent events that happened to a long time poster and moderator 
              here, the Traveling Poet. For various reasons, valid or not, his 
              main character, a level 51 cleric named Dikmer became unpopular on 
              the Xegony server in certain circles. These things happen and are 
              part of the game. However, someone decided that wasn't enough and 
              hacked into Poet's account, cleaning out all of Dikmer's equipment 
              and cash in the process. For Poet's own account of this see <A 
              href="http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/Forum1/HTML/003195.html">http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/Forum1/HTML/003195.html</A><BR><BR>Now 
              in my opinion this is about as low as a person can go in a virtual 
              reality. Stealing a person's "virtual property" over a 
              disagreement? You are kidding me right? Does not the perpetrator 
              realize what a true, real life scumbag this makes him/her? Does 
              not the perpetrator realize that this crime is magnitudes worse a 
              crime than the perceived injustice over the disposition of a 
              semi-rare item? Obviously not, but they should. <BR><BR>If the 
              perpetrator should somehow read this I have a little message for 
              him/her:<BR>
              <BLOCKQUOTE>Please delete your account and seek medical help. 
                You have obviously completely lost perspective and are taking 
                this game way too seriously. Quit surfing EQ sites and seek 
                medical attention. </BLOCKQUOTE>I am truly sad to read what

            <BLOCKQUOTE>I recently made a post to the Gameplay forum 
              requesting a change to the resurrection engine. Specifically, I 
              asked that the game mechanics be changed so that a player received 
              more than one shot at getting a resurrection. This thread has 
              since grown to over 200 responses, yet has still received no 
              attention from Verant. To add your support the link to the URL is

              intentions are to let this particular thread grow at least a few 
              hundred more before complaining about it on other sites. He's 
              already stated that the current way Res's work is not a bug. We're 
              asking them to change it. My personal guess is Abashi has seen it, 
              and frankly doesn't have a real good answer. So let's keep the 
              pressure up, but not get nasty about it.<BR><BR>Rayne</BLOCKQUOTE>

                <LI>Chestplate of the Darkflame War,Pal,Shd &lt;--I think this 
                one is missing Clr. i have heard some lame rumors that we cant 
                wear because its evil well #1 Pal can wear and #2 there is such 
                a thing as an evil Clr.<BR>
                <LI>As a side note we can wear some things with the same name as 
                some of the above such as Mithril Breastplate,but we cant wear 
                #1 or 2 above. We can wear Silver plated Greaves but not #4 
                above</LI></OL><BR><BR><B>Being a plate-wearing class isn't 
              supposed to mean that you can wear every piece of plate armor out 
              there. There are still items that are restricted to the melee 
              classes (and yes I'm including the bard in this description, 
              though they're really in a class all their own). You'll notice 
              that even though Shamans can wear chain, they aren't able to wear 
              every piece of chain that rangers or rogues can 
              wear.<BR><BR>-Gordon</B><BR><BR></BLOCKQUOTE>

            <BLOCKQUOTE>I found this when roaming through one of the message 
              boards.<BR><BR>-Recently, Kerra Isle was revamped, and all sites 
              still mentioned an island when they said where to find Maugrim. 
              Well, the reining Kerran took Maugrim as prisoner during the 
              take-over and Maugrim is now being held captive in a passageway 
              hidden behind Mitty's throne. Just look for a 
              castle-looking-building in one of the open areas of Kerra Isle in 
              a corner, go inside, and go behind Mitty's throne. Maugrim is in 
              the left room down the corridor.- <BR><BR>Thanks to everyone who 
              emailed me confirming that this change has happened =) Happy

            Question</STRONG></FONT><SMALL><BR>Posted by <A

            <BLOCKQUOTE>-Abashi responded to my question about hotkeys on the 
              gamemplay forum recently-<BR><BR>&gt;&gt;&gt;As any seasoned 
              healer will tell you, the F1-F8 keys are a neccessity. Targeting 
              your players with these keys are a must. Since we can heal pets i 
              was wondering if it were possible for clerics to hit the Fkeys 
              twice to target a mage's(or any pet class)pet. I also play a 
              magician and i am able to target myself with F1 and then press F1 
              again and it targets my pet. I dont think this is to unreasonable 
              a request. It would just make it alot easier to monitor the health 
              of a pet in a group situation. =) <BR><BR><B>It's a good idea, and 
              I'll mention it, but I imagine that this might be a bit difficult 
              to implement at this time. What the F-keys do is client-side, and 
              the client really doesn't know who's pet is who's. 
              <BR><BR>-Gordon</B><BR><BR>I hope this can be implemented as it 
              will make life alot easier for clerics in Norrath!
