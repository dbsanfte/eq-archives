Spell goes off, nothing happens. Cleric/paladin wander off.<P> 3- you log back in contact approriate friends and await your rez...<BR>  a- Corpse cannot be resurected...<BR>  b- Corpse is resurected, but no experience is returned. (flag already set to rezzed)<BR>  c- nothing happens.<P>All of these I have seen occur. Myself being the recipient of a guildmates rez while I was offline or someone telling me "Ohh So and So said he tried to rez you this morning, but you weren;t on"<P> All results are unacceptible.<P> The resurections already suffer heavy penalties<BR> -ie the sickness, the 2hour limit and so forth.<P><BR> Making the resurection GROUP ONLY in no way will fix this problem and will make large dungeon and planar runs a moot point. A cleric can't be in everyone's party in these large events. So this as a solution is negative to everyone in the game.<P> The Coding to the resurections needs to be reviewed and reprogrammed as a high priority issue. The man hours involved might be tremendous, but Cleric's need this to be a solid addition to the gameplay of others in the game.<BR> No other class is needed as much as a cleric in the higher level areas to keep their party alive and therefore allow the parties a chance to have fun.<BR> Fun is becoming more and more of a chore in Everquest and more and more of my friends are becoming disenfranchised with EQ-Verant's Vision. Even though the game is highly addictive and offers an alternative reality for many to play and  have fun. That seems to be sliding to the wayside.<BR> When equipment becomes more meaningful than tactics for success in any environment, people will not go there anymore no matter the rewards. Unless of course to them it is a Business. (EBAYERS)<BR> When failure by any reason leads to drudgery of a CR (corpse recovery) that can last for over a day without a possibility of getting any of your exps back. You become angry and depressed and may walk away from the game entirely.<BR> The "RISK" often if rife with pitfalls and bad programming, due more to lack of FORESIGHT than any "Vision" (tm).<BR> THe "ADJUSTMENT" of a zone to make it more challenging to the newly born higher levels once again is detrimental to all the others in the game  who haven't achieved that status yet and were looking forward to the dungeons "adjusted". <BR> Verant needs to re-asses it's vision both as a business and as a entertainment provider. <P> I have a solution for the TIME-LIMIT for clerics that may or may not be desired or liked by the general populace but would make the 10-14 hour corpse recoveries a bit more palatable for players.<P> After the 2 hour timelimit, allow a resurection for exps with a item/component for each hour thereafter.<BR> If said corpse is 3 hours active past the 2 hour point, then perhaps 3 gems could be used to refresh said corpse. IE reset the corpse timer and resurection flag.<BR> This is possible as when a character dies a save is immediately done as the character returns to their bind points and the "timer" is started.<BR> Suggestions would depend on the levels of said characters and time deceased.<BR> 1- A Topaz per hour past the 2 hour limit would be required as a reagent for the resurection.<BR> or<BR> 2- A topaz per hour past the 2 hour limit for the  SPELL REFRESH CORPSE (Lvl 39+) MANA same as a REZ (39) This not only would be cast targeted on the corpse itself, it would reset the "Death Clock" to zero and reset the CORPSE TIMER to Zero too. This would allow a corpse with gear in danger of decaying to have it's 24 hours online or week offline. IF using 50 topazes is a bit much, perhaps make the gem a peridot(one most clerics that level already carry) a Pearl, or a Ruby.<BR> This is one suggestion... there are many others...<P>Brodder FoamyMugs<BR>near Saint of Brell(49)<BR>on the Bertoxxulous Server<BR>and a Champion of Brell <A HREF="http://members.home.net/brell" TARGET=_blank>http://members.home.net/brell</A> </FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#dedfdf"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">kitsinu</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">I bumped it, damn straight.<P>I am additionally calling for a Cleric protest.  To join in, you need to be able to Revive, Resuscitate or Resurrect.  Go to an zone where your spell is rare, and then do it at the zone line for NO CHARGE.

I would like to propose a new spell, Reverse Decay, that would reset the elapsed time a corpse has been in existance and allow another attempt at a res.  I leave it to the PTB (Powers That Be) to decide who should get this spell, its level, and components, if any.  This seems to be a relatively easy solution, but I'm sure there are programming issues.  In any case, the action of a player hitting the "YES" button must become the final trigger to render a corpse completely useless for the purposes of resurrection.<P>The other thing that can be done in the meantime is education.  We must spread the word about this "feature" of resurrection and use peer pressure on those that misuse the spell to deprive others of RL hours of effort.</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#f7f7f7"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Longleaf Falling</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">I'm all for clerics being able to res longer, but can we please come up with a solution that doesn't litter<BR>the zones with corpses like before?<P>People seemed to be using duel created corpses as handy gate points before the 2 hour "fix."<BR></FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#dedfdf"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Deo</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Bumped<P>*Wonders how Gordon will find a way to call this "class evny" or "Working according to the Vision(tm)*"<P>And post that no fix is necessary</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#f7f7f7"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Xthor</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">I bumped, too...but it looks like it's already sinking down the list...  </FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#dedfdf"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Kelric</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Bumped on the Station...  here's hoping that they take a closer look at the issues involved.</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#f7f7f7"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">kitsinu</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Just bumping it here.</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#dedfdf"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Cabbus</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">I think this major problem needs to be fixed also.<P>I also think it would be nice if this cleric web page could put up a little fact sheet on what all needs to be done, or not done for a exp rez to have the best chance of working.<P>I think I remember someone saying once that you can't zone.
