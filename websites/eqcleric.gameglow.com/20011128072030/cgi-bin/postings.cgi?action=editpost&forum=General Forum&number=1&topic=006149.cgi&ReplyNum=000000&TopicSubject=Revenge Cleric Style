<TEXTAREA NAME="EditedMessage" ROWS=10 COLS=45 WRAP="VIRTUAL">Ok I was thinking about this last night as I saw a friend of mine pop up beside me naked 6 times. He was a 35th level cleric and his group just kept getting him killed, they wouldn't listen to him and he was the one suffering for their mistakes. He was really mad so I jokingly said "Ya know, DA works wonders in a bad pull.*wink* *wink*" and he started laughing cause he got my meaning. 

A few nights before I had been killin things in City of Mist with my 41 monk friend and everything was going peachy until all these high levels show up and sit on the bridge right were we are pulling and they woulnd't move and they kept killing everything. So the monk is freaking out cause she is really hot tempered and I was the voice of reason the entire night as she suggested to petition 15 basillion times. 

So after the high levels leave to go do some epic quest in the city some high level, 53 i think, Enchanter is siting by the entrance with us and he runs off, only to pull his gigantic train right over top of us. Those of you who know CoM know that there are 2 zones right beside one another and he saw where we were and he didn't even have the decency to yell train nor to do it in the other direction, even though he had just been sitting right by us and knew we were there. so we zone and then come back in and i'm down HPs huge. So the monk asks him not to do that again, quite nicely i might add :) and then he start being a complete ass about it and talkin all this **** to us. so this is the point where the dark cleric in me is let free so i med up to full and buff both of us, then I tell her to go run around the city for a bit and pick up all the undead she can and run back here. So she comes back with about 5 undead on her tail and she feign deaths and I had invis to undead on myself. the chanter keeps running by me in an attempt to train them on me so I run around like I don't wanna get hit, but these things can't even see me :) in the end he had to zone at about 1 bubble of health left and never came back :)


So now after rambling I get to the point of this post. What I wanna know is, Have any of you ever just had enough of someone or some group and let the bad cleric just come out and pull some nasty nasty stuff? :) Or have any of you had any ideas that you think might have worked in a case like this but never been tempted enough to use it? So don't hold back and be all nicey nice on me and tell me how it's wrong to do this stuff, let the dark cleric out for once cause ya know you've all been tempted at least once ;)</TEXTAREA>
