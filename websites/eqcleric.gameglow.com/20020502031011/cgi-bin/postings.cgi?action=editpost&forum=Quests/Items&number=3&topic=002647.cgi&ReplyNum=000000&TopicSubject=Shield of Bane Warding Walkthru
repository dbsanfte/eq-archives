I completed my SoBW quest this past monday night and I thought I would put together a small quest walkthru with my experiences. There are other walkthru's, most notably a large user collaboration one on the Safehouse boards... I am just writing my own here because it is an awesome item and not every cleric visits the Safehouse on a regular basis.

Quest starts in Katta by talking to Rowena Rhorer inside the castle (building inside the gardened courtyard near the Tenebrous Mountain zone line). Hailing her will start the quest dialog. If you ask her about the "Tormented Vah Shir" she will hand you an 8 slot container and tell you to put in the skulls of 8 Tormented Vah Shir.

The Tormented Vah Shir spawn in Tenebrous Mountains. There are 3 confirmed spawn points/location:

Location 1: NE corner of TM between the Coterie Fort and a 3 building Coterie outpost.

Location 2: SE corner virtually due East of the Grimling forest zone line.

Location 3: SW corner on top of a hill with a tree due south of the Katta entrance where the Katta wall ends.

The Tormented Vah Shir are a random spawn and, atleast in the SW corner spawn, on a 6.5 minute timer with several other mobs. I have seen it take several hours to get one to spawn and I have had 2 spawn within 20 minutes of eachother. The SW corner spawn table includes aliens and bats. They spawn between the tree and the wall.. kill them immediately. Otherwise I would highly recommend having a tracking capable friend to help you.

Once you get the 8 skulls, put them into the 8 slot container Rhorer gave you and hit combine. Take the combined container back to Rhorer and hand it in.... NOTE... this starts a battle sequence that can be very tough if you don't have friends to help you... most notably an enchanter or kite capable class. Handing in the combined box causes a courier to spawn and run to Rhorer. Once the courier talks to Rhorer he begins to run away... At this point Rhorer tells you he has been possessed and that you need to kill him and return the box and skull to her.

DO NOT kill the courier inside the castle or you risk having the reanimated tormented vah shir skeletons spawn inside the castle walls... fight the courier in the courtyard or near the TM zone. 

Kill the courier and 8 reanimated vah shir skeletons spawn. They are about level 35 and don't hit too hard, but you either need to mez the extra's or kite some around. I did this part of the quest with a 55war, 55shm, and 58 cleric(me)... it was extremely close and the shaman died. We did it twice (one for me and other for the shaman).. the second time we stayed far away from the warrior (who was using a DS potion) when the 8 skellies spawned and we were able to drop them all the 2nd time much easier.

Once you have killed all 8 skeletons combine the heads they drop into the container that the courier drops and return it to Rhorer in the castle.

At this time Rhorer gives you back the box and a note. Take these to Spiritist Roleko in the Vah Shir outpost in the Grimling Forest. Handing in the note and the box will cause your second turn in fight to start. Once you hand in your items a Possessed Grimling and 3 undead Grimlings spawn inside the fort. Kill all 4 and return their skulls/heads to Roleko. NOTE: the Possessed Grimling cannot be rooted or snared so be sure to engage him first.. the pathing in here is horrible so be weary of that especially if you have pet classes helping you.

Once you kill the Possessed Grimling and the 3 undead Grimlings, turn in their heads/skulls to Roleko. Roleko will give you a note to take to Spiritist Cholsa in Shar Vahl (cat city). Go to cat city and look for SCRIBE Cholsa (not spiritist) who is in the basement of the palace. Hand her the note and she will give you back a note of instructions to kill the Rakhasa. She then tells you to gather some required ingredients and return the ingredients with the instructions to Roleko back in Grimling Forest.

Required ingredients:

Black Flame Charcoal - drops off Umbrous Toilers in Maidens Eye near the lake

Thought Leech Brain - drops off of Thought Leeches in Mons Letalis (cave of them there)

Amulet of Sun Rays - drops off "the Burning Priest" who spawns in Scarlett Desert up on the plateau behind the revenant ruins. He is a single spawn near 2 rocks between the revenant ruins and the tro jeg aliens temple thingy.

All three ingredients are fairly uncommon and will take you some time to obtain.

Once you have all 3 ingredients take them, with the note Cholsa gave you, back to Spiritist Roleko in Grimling Forest. Hand them in and Rakhasa *somethingorother* spawns.. kill the Rakhasa and return the head he drops to Spiritis Roleko.

Turning in the Rakhasa head to Roleko will get you your reward... which btw, is tradeable (not NO-DROP).


Have fun and get yourself a rather nice shield.... 

BTW, the shield looks like one of the large silver round Lion's head shields that the Vah Shir royal guards wear in cat city.... sexy ~
