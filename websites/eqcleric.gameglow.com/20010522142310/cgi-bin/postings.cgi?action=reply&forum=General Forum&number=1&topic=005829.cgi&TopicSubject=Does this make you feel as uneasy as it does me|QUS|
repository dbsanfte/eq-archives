But I have battle spam turned off because I'm so focussed on health bars, I frequently miss what people are saying. Sure, it means I don't see "Ranger00 is hit for 240 pts. of damage", but I can see that by watching health bars and I now have a more reasonable chance of seeing "Druid00 tells you, 'Can you heal Ranger01?'" (Druid00 being the only healer in Ranger01's group - this actually happened a few times last night, at my request, since Greater Heal on a level 58 ranger isn't going to go far.) <P>If I have to turn battle spam on in order to see frequent health up-dates, I'm likely to miss tells like that, since I'm not very good at multi-tasking. And when Ranger00 is being hit for 240 pts. of damage, I don't like letting my attention wander from health bars for too long.  <P>Oh, and I'm not just monitoring my group's health, but I'm trying to monitor the health of folks in other groups as well.<P>Oh, well, hopefully it'll work out for the best.<P>------------------<BR>Tommara, Level 53 Vicar<BR>Tommar, Level 40 Ranger<BR>Povar</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#f7f7f7"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Nasren</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">This does have me a little worried since past history has proven that they don't always think things through.<P>I have battle spam turned off because I need to hear what raid leaders are saying as well as shouts for heals from other groups that may have lost their Cleric or has gone OOM. <P>If they tie in battlespam with health updates then I see little improvement in lag issues for Clerics and ultimately for everyone. I am glad they are looking into this but it may only lead to more deaths and in the long term in 6 seconds against The Ubermobs you could lose people without ever knowing they were taking damage or healing to late from not knowing they were getting some Lovin.<P>I can not see anyone not wanting to have their hitpoints as accurate as possible. I see the implementation of this first wave of server side filtering as nearly useless. I just hope they really think about all the classes and how this change will effect the entire game.

When you're at a raid, you may view "Vox hits Joebob for 142" as annoying spam, but it's also the way your client knows that Joebob's health has just gone down by 142.<P>This may be an example of how you should be careful what you wish for.  Players have been saying, "stop sending us so much data during raids."  And Verant is saying, ok, we can do that, but there may be some consequences you haven't thought of.  Specifically, reducing the data flow dramatically may mean that you're left without some information that you want.<P><B>Hmm yeah, they better test this on huge raids.</B><P>I suspect that it's going to be hard for "them" to do that kind of testing.  It's not like you can test this by logging in to a test environment at Verant and whacking a mob for a while.  The only real test is to have large groups of players (i.e., people playing over the internet, not at Verant HQ) go on a bunch of raids, and see how it works.  I don't know where you can do that other than the production servers themselves.</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#f7f7f7"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Talura cwn'Zeylon</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Hmm, although I'm not sure exactly how the data is transmitted it seems the most logical way to send battle damage would be to tag it (damager)(damaged)(damage), possibly even simplifying it down to assigning each individual an aliased number (ie, Bob the Ranger gets the ID of 82, Vox the Dragon is 22...Vox rips Bob in half, doing around 200 dmg...so the message sent comes out as 22,82,200.) Just a thought.<BR>I think if they would put server-side filters on non-essential to refresh items like bardsongspam and possibly damage shields it would help a lot...just my 2 cents.</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#dedfdf"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Jubal</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Really the only essential items they have to worry about are character HP and cast-begin messages. All other updates (mob HP, object positions, damage to mob, etc) can be filtered out server-side.<P>Even if it takes you six seconds to get the message that a mob is dead, it's still dead. Having a six second delay on seeing that a mob has moved or a player is out of spell range will be annoying, but definitely won't be worse than mass LD.<P>You need character HP updates ASAP to keep people alive of course, and cast message updates because cast timing is very important, but I don't see anything else that can be filtered that will be essential.</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#f7f7f7"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Meddik</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">This scares the crap outta me.

If they leave the client side filters that are there and add an option to turn on server side filters for the implemented items then I would like this greatly. <P>This would allow me to leave server side updates for xx takes damage but turn off the client side update for it as it is now. I hope this is how they implement the filters not just make the filters that are there allready server side. <P>------------------<BR>Trilvan Lostheart<BR>46th Cleric of Love Peace and Happiness</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#f7f7f7"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Kregar</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Talura, that is already similar to how the data is sent to the client now. There is no message from the server that actually says "RangerX is hit for 200 damage." It is sent from the server as a numerical sequence. The client just interprets the sequence and displays the message, but it primarily uses the data in the sequence to change RangerX's hitpoints. All that happens when you turn off "others hits" the client skips displaying the message, but the client still recieves the data from the server for reduction in RangerX's hitpoints.<P>So what they are going to do is only send hitpoint data every 3 or 6 seconds. Thus, there will be a dramatic jump in hitpoints on raids. This worries me also, this has the potential to really mess up complete heal timings and think how hard catching that enchanter is going to be.<P>But I also believe something needs to be done for raids. I guess we all have a love/hate situation here.<P>------------------<BR>Kregar, 51 Priest of Innoruuk<BR>Allied Giants - Ayonae Ro</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#dedfdf"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Nornric</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Bad side of this, from reading the article If you were to turn on all the filtering we currently use on most raid situations the NPC's health and all PC's Health will not be updated for 6 seconds. In most HEAVY raid situations a caster and depending on the mob can be dead in under 6 seconds. So you would see our poor little enchanter go from full health to dead before you would see it move. Or, you can go from seing a tank be at full health to almost dead and not have time to cast that complete heal.<P>So I beleive as a cleric or and other healing class we are going to have to turn our filters back on. I really hope that this server side filtering will be as highly configurable as the current system and that is will be seperate from the text filtering. If that is the case and we can still leave off our text messages and turn on our hits to others server messages we should be okay. (Unless you are working on a 28. <P>Either way I could see this becomming a issue. Hey Cleric do you have your filters turned off if you do I want another cleric. I sure hope not but there are many other things stupid players have said that I wouild not expect them to say.<P>Personally if it comes about the only server side filtering I would want to turn off is the dammage shield messeages, and turn off all misses. Most the time they are small amounts of dammage that wouldn't kill someone over a 6 second period.<P><BR>Nornric<P></FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#f7f7f7"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Lomilar</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Split this in half...<P>I do want Mob hits player for way too much<P>I do not want Player hits mob for not enough<P>Heck, if they could split battlespam in half like that, I would turn back on the player damage ones. Nice to know who is getting spanked around.</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#dedfdf"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Dalain</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Yeah, who cares how much health the mob has...if it got updated every 6 seconds thats fine, but if they send the mob hits X stuff like normal I think that would still vastly reduce the amount of data sent.  The vague part of this would be damage shields, and those if not dispell would still cause huge amounts of data to be sent.  *shrug*  I think it's great that they are atleast trying since I've suffered from the, oh wait, I haven't disconnected yet, but I'm 30 seconds behind the real fight. *sigh*  I am optimistic of the work and hope to see it in action.<P>Dalain</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#f7f7f7"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Tommara</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Whew!

I've got information straight from the programmers that I think I understand. Here it is.<P>First and foremost, none of this filtering will affect hit point updates. All of that sort of updating is done separately and the updates for that will remain as they are.<P>So the only real changes that you will see when using these filters will be text messages. The one exception might be that you miss a few animations and sounds here and there.<P>This information makes most of my previous message sound rather silly. <P>Alan<P> <P>------------------<BR>Tommara, Level 53 Vicar<BR>Tommar, Level 40 Ranger<BR>Povar</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#dedfdf"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Alle</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">The issue now is that with client-side filters, you get the info whether or not you use it.  If you filter out graphics, the data comes anyway, it just isn't displayed.  If you filter out damage shield messages, guess what? - the data is sent anyway you just don't display it.  With server side filters, the server won't send the data in the first place.  <P>For people who have problems going LD during a raid due to poor connections (read more data arriving than their ISP link can handle), this will be a tremendous improvement.  For those of us lucky enough to rarely go LD, things will remain exactly as they are since we won't be filtering.</FONT></TD></TR></TABLE>
