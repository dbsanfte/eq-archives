<TEXTAREA NAME="EditedMessage" ROWS=10 COLS=45 WRAP="VIRTUAL">[b]Lind- you may have played a 60 druid on a raid, but have you played a druid to 60?[/b]
 
  Yes.
 
  Honestly pre 60 isn't very important unless you're on the new no split server.  Talking pre 60 is talking no Aego, no Torpor, no Malo, no Ice Spear, i.e. no point.  Okay, sure 50 to 59 is pretty screwed up balance wise and needs to be fixed too.
 
[b]You mention that clerics are as versatile as a druid.

Umm, NO!![/b]
 
  I think you're confusing versatility and effectiveness.  Line up the different things each priest/caster class can do and they all come out pretty much the same, but no one is going to ask a wizard for a damage shield because while they have it and are thus versatile, it isn't really all that effective.
 
[b]My cleric is NOWHERE near able to solo like my druid can.[/b]
 
  My cleric can solo just fine, but will not get as good an XP/hour as my druid, who will not get as good an XP/hour as the better equipped meleers or pet classes in my guild, who will get simply blown away by people two boxing.
 
[b]She flew through the levels- with her ability to quad,  "ROT" (root/dot), easy travel to the solo zone, port to a zone to get a clarity then back to your solo zone, tracking to find those blue mobs. Shaiel doesnt need a rez spell, because she doesnt die.  The list of advantages a druid has for soloing is a long one.  There is no comparison.[/b]
 
  Soloing xp isn't as good as leeching xp off meleers anyway.  My cleric though meleed most of her way to 50 mostly solo in a few days played while getting faction.  Twinking aside, pre 60 isn't what I'm talking about.
 
[b]In experience groups, druids are fabulous healers.[/b]
 
  In my experience we'd have to not pull things because I'd be OOM with my druid healing until we got a shaman to slow and suddenly I'd never heal again and be nuking and we'd never be not fighting.  Level 60 Nature's Touch is 2.2 hp/mana, Cleric level 34 Superior Heal is 2.45 hp/mana.  Do the math, if a druid makes a fantastic healer than a cleric makes a fantastic nuker/meleer because the healing part of the job ain't taking them anything in the way of mana by 60.
 
[b]And please dont give me the argument about how we are talking Raid healing here- because unless you make that new healing spell to be only active in TOV, then its gonna come out in Seb, Velks, Chardok, HS, etc.  "Druids needing healing upgrade for raids" is an old saw- read the old posts for the pros and cons.  They do FINE in xp groups.[/b]
 
  Sebilis isn't Ssra or CT.  150 hitting froggies are not 400 hitting snakes and lizards.  It's not my fault they've screwed over their game good and hard (and on top of that they're SLOWABLE so a shaman makes that a 100 hitting snake or lizard!)
 
  When leveling in Sebilis there was no way in hell I could keep up with healing with my druid.  Sure I can NOW because everyone in the place is 60 and a 60 meleer just takes practically no damage compared to a 53, but when everyone is 53 there was just NO WAY without a slower.  But Sebilis, HS and stuff is where meleers go to solo now, it's Ssra and CT I care about.
 
[b]I am not upset with that- because I applaud versatility in group- makeup.  But improving druid healing will finish off clerics in xp groups.[/b]
 
  I don't care.  Clerics finished themselves off by there being so damn many because the game has forced it that way.  But clerics have the option of being in an AE group, druids don't.  With PoP making porting FINALLY more of a minor convience than a frustrating barrier to playing the game, hooking up groups will be easier and soloing will be less of a clear winner for getting xp.
 
  To be honest, slow needs HEAVY HEAVY HEAVY nerfing and all the priests need upgraded heals.  But if druids get nothing in the way of more heals, instead getting freed from having to ever cast another insanely mana innefficient heal so they can deal some damage with nukes that would be fine too.  Necromancers are the masters of life and death, they already outheal druids, druids can nuke a lot like wizards, druids should probably get wizard upgrades and just forget the fact they could ever cast a heal in the first place and necros get complete heal.  =P
 
[b]I think everyone wants some "magic bullet" fix that will make them snapped up for xp groups and raids.  With 3 types of priest classes, and all the advances in gear- the playing field has been levelled.  We are all going to have to live with sitting LFG for a while and perhaps being a bit pro-active to get a group.[/b]
 
  Clerics nuke much better than druids heal, but druids are still pumping all their mana through very poor heal spells.  Most are frustrated as hell because for most of the first 59 levels they thought they were healers (and for the first 40 they actually were,) but they get 60 and they find out they're oh so wrong, bit by bit.  Just look at the manaregen of a shaman compared to a druid and ignoring torpor except on themselves a shaman can sustain three times the healing a druid can through chloroblast even before slapping 75% slow on mobs turning those 400 hitters into 100 hitters.  To give you some idea how poor a druid is for healing 3 times as much sustained healing is the difference between the cleric nuke and the druid quad nuke for sustained damage...  And thats just compared to shaman's chloroblast.
