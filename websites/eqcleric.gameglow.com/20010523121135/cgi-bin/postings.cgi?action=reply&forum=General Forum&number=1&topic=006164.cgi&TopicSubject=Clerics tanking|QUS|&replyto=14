In case you didn't know, a 16th level warrior can't take many mobs without someone to heal him...
Casters tend to solo better than them...

And as a 16th cleric you think you meleed a 32nd warrior to 1 bubble and he wasn't going very easy on you?

My first char is a 51 WARRIOR.  My cleric now 50, is my favorite, but I do know a thing or two about how it works.<P>I never once said meleeing is wrong, just that your idea of "Tanking" is looking from a different view.<P>To "TANK" is to taunt the mob(s) into hitting you, absorb the damage, deal what damage you can and keep the others safe from harm.  Tanks are often termed "Meat Sheild" because that is what they are, your sheild between the mob and group.<P>NOTE: This does NOT MEAN you will deal the most damage.  As a warrior I regularly stand there and watch rangers, rogues and monks dish out MUCH more damage than I.  But as long as the mob is munching my big barbarian rear, thats all that matters.  <P>If you love to melee (hitting the mob), by all means, do so.  Just be aware of the impact on your group.<P>Personally we have been romping in Chardok and I spend all my free time meditating, stunning gaters and HEALING.  <BR>Though when I spent 2 weeks in the City of Mist, I did one night of pulling. (We got bored and swapped rolls, shaman was pet caster, druid meleeing, cleric pulling, warrior bandaging, was pretty interesting to say the least.  <IMG SRC="http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/biggrin.gif">)<P>At a 'low level' meaning 20 or less, you will be able to deal melee damage well enough to contribute effectively.  So enjoy it now.<P>While one form of me is a 'pansy' elf, another is a big mean barbarian.

I am now level 30 and I am going up against monsters that in one round take me down a full bubble of health. Yes clerics can tank and yes we can hit, BUT by the time you get into your 20s you will be doing it less and less. Do not look at EQ clerics as being true clerics cause we're not. True clerics sit in the front lines with the warriors and heal when needed and lay down vengful wrath in between healing. EQ cleric should have been called Priests cause thats what we are.<P>This doesn't mean you can't do it, because sometimes the need does arise. Sometimes the Enchanter or some caster is getting munched and the warrior has his hands full so that leaves you. When you get into your 20s go to highkeep and get into groups there, you will learn how to be an EQ cleric real fast. <P>You have to understand this, EQ clerics control the pace of the game. Pullers do not pull until the cleric tells them they have enough mana, the good ones anyway:P The ENTIRE party counts on you to stay alive so when you get into the upper levels it is your mana bar that is going to determine wether or not you are tanking. At low levels like you are at monsters don't hit for very much, but soon you will notice a BIG difference in MOB strength and in order to keep your group alive you need to sit med and heal. IF it is a good group you might find mana plentiful and you will DD monsters and go and tank a few for fun, but I will tell you this now; If you want to attack things and if you want to do the damage to monsters do not be a cleric. EQClerics are not designed for it. Be a paladin, it will give you a nice mix of warrior and cleric. And do not confuse soloing tactics with grouping tactics. I can still take out yellows and blues, and very very rarely a red but those are two different ball games. Clerics are very group dependant, the same as warriors, we need each other and we make each other better, and you are going to get more out of being a cleric if you concentrate on keeping everyone alive. At the level you are at now things are SO different, at higher levels it's only seconds between decisions that will either keep the group alive or kill everyone and if you are conentrating on tanking you make it that much harder to do your job cause it's not tanking, thats what the warriors are for.</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#f7f7f7"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Fistandantylys</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">i understand what yall are saying. i have a 59 cleric as well, a high elf i might add, im just saying that at the moment i am living proof that us clerics arent all weak and useless without alot of mana. oh and i was mainly talking about while soloing<P>------------------<BR>i am fistandantylys disciple of mithaniel marr himself i am hated by my hometown freeport but i think they just dont understand the mighty power of us clerics since most everywhere else ive been the people have enjoyed my company</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#dedfdf"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Mirriana_00</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">"well, im glad yall agree but i mean i can solo an entire camp of blue even yellow mix just as good as any warrior."<P>In case you didn't know, a 16th level warrior can't take many mobs without someone to heal him...<BR>Casters tend to solo better than them...<P>And as a 16th cleric you think you meleed a 32nd warrior to 1 bubble and he wasn't going very easy on you?<BR>/whatever.<BR></FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#f7f7f7"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Jimette</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Hey, at 55th level I was a tank vs Blues in Karnors!
