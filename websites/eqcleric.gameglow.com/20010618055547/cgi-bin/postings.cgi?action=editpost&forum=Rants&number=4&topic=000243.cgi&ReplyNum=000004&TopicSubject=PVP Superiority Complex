To the guy who said, "You get ignored because no one cares if your awesome on Rallos."
[/b][/QUOTE]

Again, PVP defensiveness comes through. That is not what was written. If you are the absolute best player on Rallos, good for you. Now stop acting like a dick, because that doesn't justify it.

I have never seen a "blue" server player tell a PVP player "they don't have a clue" about how to play the game because of the server they play on. Blue server players are in general quite aware that doing any given thing is going to be more difficult with PVP involved. But just because you decided to suffer through that does not make "bluebies" lesser players.

You remind me of the people that argue that Brand X Lite Beer is better than Brand Y, or that Sport X is somehow better than Sport Y. Only REAL men play hockey, those football guys are just pansies. He doesn't smoke my brand of cigarettes, I'm obviously entitled to belittle his parentage. Did you see what she was wearing? That shirt must have only cost $20, she's obviously entirely inferior to me. I used to be a total game dominator at "Axis and Allies," worship at my feet, peon.

Whatever.


  [QUOTE][b]
You do care.  In fact, you are disgusted.  Yet those PvPrs will continue to look at you from above because in general it is true that they are better at the game than you are.
[/QUOTE][/b]

No, I'm disgusted because they are a bunch of arrogant jerks that are too pathetic to admit they are just arrogant jerks and have to hide behind some totally arbitrary distinction (1), and that's why I posted a rant to a rant forum. 

You are not better than me because you play a game with different rules, and if you think that being "red" magically makes you better, I invite you to open the windows and let the fumes disperse.

No one cares that you play PVP. If you have fun doing it, then go right ahead, and we wish you well. But you get zero real respect for it, you get zero kudos for it, your penis grows zero millimeters longer because of it.

For most players, EQ PVP is not fun, it's just stupid and annoying. And that's why they don't do it, and don't care that you do.

So many PVP players are so blindly defensive that they'll even misread a generic rant about jerks from PVP servers to be a directed attack on their ego.

  [QUOTE][b]
In the same way that we used to look down on players who chose Necros and Druids (when they were extremely overpowered), because those people took the easy way to level 50, some of the most honorable and peaceful people on the PvP servers look down upon those players on the blue servers.
[/QUOTE][/b]

Oh my, let's bring classism into this, too. Wah wah, necros can solo to 50. Wah wah, druids get ports and I don't, whine whine whine.

Getting an enchanter or cleric or rogue to 50 is no more an accomplishment than a necro or a druid. It is purely a function of time investment provided you have the nescesary skill not to drool on yourself instead of hitting the same keys over and over.

You are not a better player than a necro because you are a cleric. You are not a better player than a druid because you are a warrior. 

You are not a better player because you play on PVP.

God, I so pity anyone who comes into EQ hoping to play for fun, instead of specializing to the point of mindless repetition just so they can flaunt their ego over those poor sods who picked their persona on the basis of "Hey, it sounded fun." 


  [QUOTE][b]
I don't need to try to kill uber fungi monk.  That's not fun for me so I don't try.  And fungi monk is NOT going to ruin my day, like he will to someone who is unskilled/unwise.  After a few strafes, fungi monk knows he can't kill me.  And I know I can't kill him.  Mutual respect is formed, we bow and go our separate ways.
[/QUOTE][/b]

Now who is clueless as to what EQ PVP is actually like? Anyone who feels like making your play experience worse as part of their effort to pretend they have self-esteem can do so just as easily on PVP, and they do. 

Mutual respect with a grief player. Now that is comedy.

  [QUOTE][b]
/bows (from above you)

/snickers (noting how thin the air is up there)


Footnote (1) I'm an arrogant jerk, but I am not at all ashamed of it ;->
