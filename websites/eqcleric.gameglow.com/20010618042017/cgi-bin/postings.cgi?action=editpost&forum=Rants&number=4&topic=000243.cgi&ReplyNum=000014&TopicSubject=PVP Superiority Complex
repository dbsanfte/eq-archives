<TEXTAREA NAME="EditedMessage" ROWS=10 COLS=45 WRAP="VIRTUAL">Well put everyone.  I was concerned that our little rant here was degenerating into a personal flame fest, in which I would have been the major instigator.  I have no ill will towards anyone here.

Kimbera - Of course the point is to have fun.  As with any sport, game, or activity that is played for fun, we can still be rated on skill level.  There are things we can measure to determine who is the best at the game.  (Not who is most successful - that's different, because the criteria for judging success is different for each player.)  Who is having the most fun is impossible to measure.

If you don't want to discuss this, that's perfectly acceptable, but I took this thread in that direction because I was trying to explain where the PvP superiority complex comes from.

The superiority complex comes from the PvP players who have played and mastered both environments.  They feel like they are better EQ players as a result of this mastery.  It's not polite that they look down on others for not having certain in-game skills.  But I'm telling you, they do it because they truly believe themselves to be better at the game than you.

It's fine that many don't agree that they are better players than you.  That issue can be disputed.

Everyone agrees that the PvP game is horribly broken and skewed.  That's not the issue.  We can say the same thing about the 50+ game, high level encounters that require certain classes but not others, high level encounters that require 40+ people yet only 6 can be in a group.  There are a ton of examples to bring up that would suggest that EQ as a whole is flawed.

I can also say that professional tennis is also broken and skewed because it caters to tall people who can hit the ball 90 miles an hour so you can't return their serve.

The best enchanter on the server, you can pretty much guarantee, uses the game mechanics (flaws and features) in her favor.  When people use flaws and features to PK, they are considered dispicable cheaters.  That is a double standard.  These are skills.  This is game knowledge.


"But even if you beat me, that does not implicitly make you a better player. "

True, but remember the hypothetical scenario?  We are equal in ALL other aspects of the game.  That's the assumption.  THEN, you introduce PvP, and since I have quite a bit more experience than you in this aspect of the game, I am probably going to beat you most of the time.  It's true that one duel won't tell us much, but I think 100 or so duels, using different classes would tell the story.  PvP is much more than duels, but to measure this skill dueling is the easiest method.

Some of you are actually disputing the assumption that my scenario requires for the theory to hold true.  You are saying that because I'm PvP minded, I am somewhat distracted, and therefore am not as good as someone who totally thinks in terms of "us vs the monsters."

This idea has merit, and probably holds true in A LOT of cases - but there is no evidence of this in the scenarios I have laid out.  We have evidence that suggests most of you are not very skilled in PvP combat - you guys came out and said it!  I told you that I am indeed a master of both environments, and you cannot dispute that since you don't know me.

The theory is simple...
****

Snaggle's Postulate states...

Player A = (master blue server player)
Player B = (master red server and blue server player)
Overall EQ skill = PvE skill + PvP skill

PvE skill = ALL skills in EQ that are not considered PvP.  (Examples would include roleplaying, trade skills, diplomacy, ability to make friends, spelling, grammar, punctuation, knowledge of hunting grounds, knowledge of mob stats, knowledge of dungeon experience modifiers, etc.)


Given that Player A's PvE skill = Player B's PvE skill, the following will hold true:

((Player A's PvE skill) + (Player A's PvP skill)) < ((Player B's PvE skill) + (Player B's PvP skill))

So, looking at it objectively, we can see where the PvP superiority complex comes from.  If the theory is true, then Player B is better at EQ than Player A.  Thus, Player B is superior to Player A, when it comes to overall EQ prowess.

****
When someone says "you don't have a clue because I play on Ego Zek and blah blah...", they are indeed being rude.  But isn't it possible that the person does actually know a lot more about EQ than you do?  Isn't it possible that he has a greater skill base than you?  Maybe, compared to his wealth of knowledge and skill, you really don't have a clue.

Most of you were claiming that the superiority complex is mostly ego, and there is not enough skill and knowledge to back it up.  I am saying that that is not always the case.  I know this for a fact.

I will never think of someone as a great EQ player, unless they have some reasonable skill level in PvP combat.  There are many who feel as I do.

You can kill all the epic mobs in the game, but you can't kill me?  Now THAT is some funny sh*t!
