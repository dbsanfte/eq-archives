<TEXTAREA NAME="EditedMessage" ROWS=10 COLS=45 WRAP="VIRTUAL">a couple of notes...

Clerics have a line of AC buffs, and a line of AC/HP buffs, plus symbol. the druids have their "skin" line (plus a self-only line)... there are times during the progression through levels that the druid's buffs will overwrite one of the cleric's buffs, usually at a point when druid has just earned and upgrade -- at this point the spells are pretty close to being equal (of course, the cleric can stack his/her other line on and thus end up with a much superior total enhancement. (I have a 49 cleric and a 47 druid).

I think the reason for both the spells given to the druid and the spells withheld from the cleric are primarily the desire of Verant to build interdependence.  If the druid truly got the best of all spells, wouldn't you think they would be very sought after in the high end game? in fact, they tend to have some trouble getting into guilds/groups/etc at the higher levels if they haven't built up a strong reputation/circle of friends...because they have the tools to do a lot of jobs pretty well, but there is usually someone who has the tools to do it better or more efficiently, and the difference becomes more and more important in the higher levels.

My cleric was my first character, and as someone who had very erratic playing times, I would make friends but was not able to plan on regular groups or arrange to meet people (I was not in a guild at the time), so I often found myself venturing out to explore on my own ... and grew quite frustrated at my lack of "travelling" tools:

no ports, no speed enhancements, no invisibility, no levitate...not a strong enough tanking ability to rely on that... 

(I'm not griping about this at all, I'm just saying that it was such a blanket shortfall that I stopped thinking it was coincidence). I think that a decision was specifically made that clerics would not be very "mobile".  Verant has made no bones about the fact that they WANT classes to need each other, so they take a class that is highly needed, and in some cases desperately needed in a specific spot without much notice, and they make that class mobility-impaired.... certainly that has got to create some interdependence.

Keep in mind that druid doesn't get the low-aggro heal spells (although they do get the regen/chloro line); the druid has great mobility, but can't punt the player who needs to leave your group, or call in his replacement. he can heal, but he can't wear the armor to take the abuse when he gets aggro for that heal. (and doesn't get the lower-aggro heal spells, tho does get regen/chloro)

they can't nuke as well as a wizard or dot as well as a necro... not that they should. Just realize that when a specific job is called for, the class people are going to be looking for is usually some class other than a druid.

I enjoy playing both classes, as well as my current "main" (54 enchanter). druids can be a lot of fun to play, and really hit their strides about level 14... when I hit that level on my first druid I felt godlike.  :) And if I'm bored and just want to wander on my own and explore a bit, nothing beats my druid. I don't enjoy soloing for experience much (i get bored way too easily), though, and the supply/demand ratio for higher level druids in groups is not in your favor...

fun to play? sure
lot of nice spells? sure
overpowered? ...I don't really think so, at least not if you want to do anything but grind out solo experience, and I don't really see that as a huge advantage.
