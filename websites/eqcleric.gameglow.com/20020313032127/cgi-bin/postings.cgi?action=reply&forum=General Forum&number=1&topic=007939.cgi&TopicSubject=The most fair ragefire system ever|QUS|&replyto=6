[B]The problem with the tholuxe reservation system, imo, is that everything is hand tailored to the 8 guilds that are currently on it.

You have to kill ragefire guild only TWICE with absolutely no help from another guild using a free slot, which there are 2 per rotation.  Once you've done this your guild is on the rotation.  Once your on the rotation you dont have to kill rage guild only anymore, in fact once there was a situation where only 6 people from their own guild showed up, and they got help from about 12 others.

The other thing that is junk about our rotation is the only people that are allowed to make any changes to the rules are the guilds on the rotation and the person that over-sees it, whom is in one of the guilds on the rotation.  Thankfully, the rage rotation "moderator" is pretty fair, but in general, this has started to make other guilds upset about having to conform to a rotation that they have absolutely no say so in.

Its really sad actually, I hope they work something different.  I wouldnt mind my guild being FFA on rage, but then I will be looked at as being FFA on everything and I dont want to do that, so I kinda have to conform to the powerful 8 for the time being.

Some of the issues seem to be Guild need vs. cleric need, administration, efficiency.<P>Guilds need an epic cleric.  Some of the higher end content really flows much better if there is a cleric with a rez stick on hand.  Makes the recovery of a wipe out a trivial task, vs. a hours worth of rezing and medding.  However, clerics want their epic too.  Its a fantastic 1hb, giving tons of wisdom, is a status symbol, etc.  So, guilds without an epic get stressed, and want precedence in an rotation.  At the same time, the clerics in guilds with epics don't see why they should have to wait through a rotation.<P>Someone has to administer the system.  Some one will have to keep track of who is next, who came off the list, who should go on the list, and when rage pops, that the cleric on top gets their fair chance.<P>Rage must be taken down as soon as possible.  Its a bottle neck, and must be taken out, hopefully, within hours of its popping so that the next one can pop as soon as possible.  Thus more clerics can get their epics.  Unlike the way Ragefire used to be, there is no prior requirement before killing him.  He can be done as the first step towards getting your epic.<P>A solution that would seem to meet the needs listed above, and maintain player interdependance, is to run a rotation list.  To enter into the rotation list, you must assist another with the taking of ragefire.  That is, you must be there for the final battle, you must contribute to the effort (buffs, healing, or even just rezzing after.)<P>The cleric that loots rage's heart then would enter you onto the rotation list.<P>Now, how is the rotation list to be used.  My idea for that is that someone will spot the fact that ragefire is up.  Probably a cleric on this list who is anxious to get their epic or a cleric that would like to be entered on to the list.  They will consult the list, and attempt to contact each person on the list in order, until they find someone that can mobilize the forces to take down ragefire within 30 minutes.<P>Problems?  Ideas?  Suggestions for other fair systems?  As you can see, I didn't address guild vs. cleric need in my suggestion.  Perhaps there is a way to order the list, so that the guilds that have clerics that most need the epic will tend to be towards the top of the list?<P>-Jhonno Urso, Templar of the 57th Truth, Torvonnilus server</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#f7f7f7"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Aladain</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">This is just my personal opinion, but a guild based rotation is perhaps the most unfair rotation possible, in fact, FFA is probably more fair.  Tholuxe has a rotation, which I'm happy for, but it is a rotation that is so sickly tailored to the guilds that are on it, its pathetic.  Its painstaking and hard as HELL to get on the rotation (though the current guilds on it didnt have to go through what they are advocating everyone else has to do), and then once you're on it, no matter what you do, short of just not even acknowledging rage is up or asking to be kicked off it, you cant get kicked off of the rotation!<P>So in essense, you have a few guilds on our server that are majority 50+ members that have to wait 15 ragefires or so until they get their FIRST cleric epic, while the guilds in the rotation will get 2-3 in that time, bringing their totals to 15+ cleric epics.<P>Cleric based rotation, and not guild based, is the way to go IMO.<P>Aladain</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#dedfdf"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Dalur - Veeshan</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Agreed<P>Also you will always have some guild that will decide they aren't going to follow the rules and will KS out of line.<P>There is no way you could manage a rotation unless there was some way to enforce a penalty if you didn't follow the rules.<BR><P>------------------<BR>Dalur Stouthealer<BR>60th Dwarven High Priest<BR>Veeshan Server</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#f7f7f7"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">jhonno torv</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Seems like the only punishment is that the guild that a cleric is from that ganked a rage out of rotation has all remaining clerics moved to the bottom of the list for a month.<P>Thus, every other cleric on the server will get notification when rage is up, but the naughty guild won't.<P>Its not enough for such a foul act, but its all I can think to do.</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#dedfdf"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">jhonno torv</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">This is going to sound wierd...<P>Move every cleric on this list from that guild to the TOP of the list.

They get epics for their remain clerics.<P>They then have to add any new cleric to the BOTTOM of the list (just like anyone else, really) with the exception that if a cleric moves into their guild, they go to the bottom of the list, they don't maintain their standing.<P>Effect of this is that no cleric will want to join the KSing creeps.<P>Nahhh, skip it.  If they have 10 clerics in house, who would want to wait 40 days extra to get their epics.<P>I guess the only solution is to flame the heck out of them as publicly as possible.</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#f7f7f7"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Dalur - Veeshan</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">flaming doesn't work either.
