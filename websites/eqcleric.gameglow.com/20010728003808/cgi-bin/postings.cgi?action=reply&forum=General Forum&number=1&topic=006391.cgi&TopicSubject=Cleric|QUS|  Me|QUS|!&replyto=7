I gave my account to a friend when I did. Since she largly funded me through MANY trade skills, as well as equipment I thought she deserved it.  Thanks again, Zetta.  I know you used to come here, anyway :)<P>Anyway, on with the story.  I've decided I'm 'going back to the darkside' now.  A different friend has said she's simultaniously leaving the game, and will gladly give me her account.<P>Which is a level 51 cleric.<P>....cleric?<P>I'm an Enchanter.  Proudly.  Skillfully.  Voratiously.<P>I fully intend to play an enchanter on that account, but the simple fact is - the existance of a level 51 character at my fingertips is a good temptation for play too.  Having played an Ench to a reasonable level previously, and vociferously reserached my class at every turn, I always worked in close quarters with many good clerics.  The one who is giving me her account being probably the best.<P>But, simply put, I dont want to get people killed and I've never played a cleric past level 5.<P>I fully intend to go to a 'begginer' type dungeon my first few days of true hunting (After playing with the spells to get 'the hang' of mana costs and so forth) such as Guk on a crowded day.  I equally fully intend to inform the group they're with an experienced player but inexperienced cleric.<P>What I'm here for is to humbly ask you all, in your experience with the class and it's various rolls, is - What makes a good cleric from BEHIND the cleric's eyes?<P>As an Ench, I know what I love clerics for.  Good use of root and stuns, when not healing.  Never meleeing, never DDing, etc.  But what is it that an observer might not pick up that you advise?<P>Which spells maybe don't work as good 'as advertised' by their listing?  Which have great tricks that may not be apparent from their descriptions?<P>Any advice, tips, et cetera will be GREATLY appreciated.<P>------------------<BR>Arykus Delark<BR>Enchahealer</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#f7f7f7"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Hinanar</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><BR>You may find that some Meleeing and DD'ing may be fun.  Just do it when the risk is low.<P>As an enchanter, you will have superb tactical awareness which could be beyond that of some clerics.<P>There are a couple of things that I can advise you on.<P>Deathpact is not as good a spell as it could have been - it is rarely effective.<P>Atone is the best memblur available.  It is cheaper to cast and more effective than the best enchanter memblurs, as long as your CHA is good enough.<P>Other than that, I feel that it is mostly through personal experience that you will find works best.<BR></FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#dedfdf"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Eachann</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">I beg to differ about atone... it is NOT better than the enchanter memblurs, the enchanter memblur spells are far superior to atone.  Atone has it's uses, but all things considered i rarely use it.   On any mob over level 35, it rarely works at all.   <BR>I've seen cleric complaints posted about this before and Verant's response was that the cleric atone was never intended to be as good as the memblur that enchanters can cast.<P><P>------------------<BR>Eachann Bronzeleaf<BR>Templar of Tunare, <BR>Tarew Marr</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#f7f7f7"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Aean</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Arykus as a cleric THE single most important thing is mana conservation. You have already said you like doing research into things so that is your first stop, go look at all your spells at casters realm or some place and take a look at numbers, speed of casting, mana use, HPs healed or whatever else the effect of the spell does. Knowing how many HPs you will heal and how fast it works is a very big leg up. <P>As for clerics not DDing or meleeing sometimes it works. not often though but if you can cast a DD spell on something to kill it right away it might be worth the mana spent as opposed to 3 heals you'd have to cast after the battle (just as an example). It's not often you will use this type of thing but don't limit yourself. Also we can tank, not as good as warriors but we can hold our own, you will use this in emergiencies. when the enchanter gets agroed and there is nothing else to do you agro the monster onto yourself cause you will last longer then the enchanter and that gives the warriors more time to get the mob agroed onto themselves.<P>Stat wise Wis and AC are just as important. You will take less damage, be able to channel through more hits and last longer by having a high ac than you would if you traded it off for more wis. I don't know the gear the cleric you now own has but i'd asume it is very good. Also look into your skills, defence should be maxed at 200 at your level, if it isn't then work on it. There was a thread yesterday where people would duel pet classes and have the pet whack on them to raise it up, this way the person controlling the creature can call it off when you get low in HPs. just make sure the pet is blue to you.<P>Communication is probably the next most important thing. Constantly updating the party as to your mana situation is very important. Making hot-keys for your heals is also important:<BR>/cast 3<BR>/g S-Heal on %t<BR>Learn to use the proper heal in the right situation and let the group know which one is coming and on whom. I keep my messages short so in the middle of battle spam they can read it quickly. <P>Also learn to lie..... I mean embellish the truth about your mana situation <IMG SRC="http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/wink.gif"> sometimes you get into pickup groups that are pull happy and almost get you killed. It doesn't hurt to tell them you're at 30m when you're actually at 50. and vice versa, sometimes you will get into groups that aren't pulling enough and you'll want to say you have more mana. not meaning to sound all high on ourselves but it is true, clerics control the pace of the game and when you get more experienced you'll know when to go faster or slower and it's up to you to control your group. You are responsible for their lives and their fun and the more knowledge you have about your class and spells the more fun everyone will have.<P>Also watch out for complete heal, it is very tricky to work. your are useless for 10 seconds. This is a situational spell where you have to judge wether your party will be safe enough for 10 seconds while you heal up the tank. You of all people will know how fast an enchanter goes down and 10 seconds is plenty of time. </FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#dedfdf"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Beckett</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">The best clerics have a good understanding of how monsters think (i.e. how their hate list works) and can generally predict what will happen in the next 5 seconds of a fight.  For example, a Froglok Krup Knight suddenly turns from the paladin he's smacking and begins mauling the group necro.  The cleric has a split second to judge whether the froggy is going to stay fixated on the necro--in which case a heal is needed--or just teach him a 100 HP lesson and then go back to hitting the paladin--in which case the cleric should hold on to his/her mana.<P>Some clerics refer to this as understanding the "flow" of a fight.  It grows with experience, and it depends on being in a group that knows what they are doing.  If you get in a pick-up group and are constantly suprised by who is getting hit, it's probably not a good group.</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#f7f7f7"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Boanerges</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">The first thing about a good cleric is that you don't panic when you're agro. Running around is a good way to get killed. That's why clerics wear AC and have DA/DB. Good tanks will taunt off you in short order. Also, you'd be amazed what you can live through if everyone keeps calm.<P>Secondly, everything is secondary to healing, but not to its exclusion. Meleeing and casting DD spells doesn't hurt when you're in a low risk situation. Stunning isn't overly important most of the time but it doesn't hurt to get in the groove of doing it.<P>Third, buff up tanks and enchanters. The shoe is on the other foot and you will find keeping enchanters alive to be a major challenge.<P>Hope that helps.<P>------------------<BR>Boanerges Thundercry<BR>Erudite Templar of Prexus<BR>Cohort Chalybeius<BR>Cazic Thule Server</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#dedfdf"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Sobchak</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">You're right; Guk will be a great place to go learn.  That or the Sol's.  The mobs hit like old people there.  Stay out of Kunark and Velious until you feel comfie in your new role. And don't sweat it too much.  The fact that you have 90% res at your fingertips will go a long way toward making things right with your group if you screw up!<P>I love casting messages; clears up so much confusion and keeps the "Heal! Heal! Heal MEEEE!'s" to a minimum (Whiney tanks make me a cranky cleric).  Rather than /g saying our heals, my guild has taken to emoting them.  That way people (clerics) in multi-group encounters know what's up too.<BR>Mine look like:<BR>/sit off<BR>/cast 1<BR>:is casting Remedy on %T<BR>(you see me stand up and wave my arms.  You also see "Sobchak is casting Remedy on Wormhammer." in whatever your emote color is.)<BR>For myself I also put a /g warning on Cheal so the tank gets a double notice just cause it takes so damn long.<P>As a cleric, I don't worry about all that Main Assist/ Second Assist ballyhoo.  I just use plain ol' regular /assist to bounce between the mob and it's target(s).<P><BR>Oh, and keep on eye on that 'chanter.   <IMG SRC="http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/wink.gif">  (I knew you'd forget if I didn't remind ya.<P>Sobchak Billdozer<BR>Grumpy Dorf Cleric on Bert<BR>(and finally with Heroic Bond at my command!)<P>edited because I'm a Left brain Word fetishist.<p>[This message has been edited by Sobchak (edited 05-30-2001).]</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#f7f7f7"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Archizek</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Remedy will no doubt be your best friend when learning to play a Cleric.

I know it's 10-12pp per cast but there are many stingy clerics out there that quickly develop a bad reputation for themselves.  Especially if you are hunting in Old Sebilis -- cash loot drops like candy there. <P>2) Heal order : Always keep your enchanter at full HP regardless of what is going on.  Some tanks or other members might die but the enchanter is the most important.  (You should already know this hehe).  <P>3) Definately make a hotkey for Complete Heal.  It's a ten second cast time which can cause a little panic on the tank.  I usually start casting it when the main tank (only works for buffed warriors) is at 2 bubbles.  This way he can get off some nice crippling blows and then gets to receive all of his health back.  <P>4) When casting larger heals do NOT immediately sit back down.  You will almost certainly get smacked or summoned.  Stay standed for a couple seconds and then have a seat.  <P>5) Like the above poster mentioned : do not panic when you DO get hit.  You should have around 2100 HP fully buffed.  You can take a few hits easily.<P>6) Keep Divine Aura up at all times and do not be reluctant to use it.  I personally keep that and Divine Barrier up at all times when dungeon crawling.  It has saved my butt numerous times.  When the puller is bringing a nasty train to the group I will usually heal him on the way in.  This will cause a lot of ticked off frogs to start jumping on me.  I then fire Divine Aura and watch the monsters wail at me in futility while the Enchanter mezzes them one by one.  This also worked rather well in the Planes.  <P>7) Be very careful about healing monks when they pull out of your sight.  If you heal them when they are not feigned then you will cause a nasty train.  I learned this the hard way in Chardok.<P>8) Have fun with the class.  You will be in a lot of demand just like your enchanter.  Make the game fun.<P>Sullah<BR>53 Vicar<BR>The Seventh Hammer<BR> <A HREF="http://www.foreverquest.com" TARGET=_blank>http://www.foreverquest.com</A> <P></FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#f7f7f7"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Benezetta PiaAdiuvo</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">I'm just happy that my friend, the player behind the original enchanter Arykus, is back **big hugs and cheek kisses to mun**.<P>Now, for your 'new' cleric.  You've already had the enchanter's viewpoint of hunting consistently with clerics, that much I know  <IMG SRC="http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/smile.gif">  I daresay you know as much about cleric strategy as I do.  But if you want a little fine tuning, come and hunt with me - I'd be happy to try to answer any questions you have.<P>Also, take the time to read the older posts on this board.

Also learn the cast time for the spells.  This will take a bit, but after a while you can learn to do tricks (like having a Complete Heal go off just after a mob dies).<P>An Enchanter should have an excellent knowledge of how to keep an Enchanter alive as a Cleric.  Stuns, Atone (not very useful to no charisma dwarves) and Roots are the Cleric's tools to help provide backup crowd control.  An Enchanter won't have much of an idea how to use Root parking.  I suggest learning in Sol B, it is much more forgiving.<P>An Enchanter should also know that there is no potentially greater AE Taunt in the game than Complete Healing<P>I would advise learning your skills in Sol B with some friends to help you (i.e. who expect to die and help with your corpse retreival).</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#f7f7f7"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Shohanna Curesurtales</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Good cleric vs.. bad cleric..<P>hmm.. I have been told on numerous occations that I was a good cleric.. (not sure why)  and I tell you why..<P>1. I am a Bard.  'nuff said..<BR>2. Heal vs. mana? hhe What's that?<BR>You know what I do??<P>I ASK that Tank01 = how much HP you got there?  he tells me.. From what he tells me I KNOW if I need Sup heal and / Gheal memed..<BR>or Complete heal and Cel heal memed..<P>3. Bards die as much as chanters..<BR>SYMBOL ALL THE BARDS AND CHANTERS.. nuff said.<P>4. Root is your friend.. Use it rather then heal and you don't have to worry about someone's CR.<P>5. AC vs. Mana..   THIS one everyone has their own opinion.. How ever, I am starting to get to the levels where I understand this delima comes from.  Lower levels, you need mana.. period..<P>Higher levels tho?  Yeah you need AC.  But I refuse to sacrafice my 200 Wis for 10 pts. of AC.  my DA/DB covers me, and I have that extra 30m to throw 5 Gheal on whom ever is about to die. (have seen it and saved them)<P>6. KNOW when you can't handle it and Call ZONE.  <P>I think what makes a good cleric is more then just wis / ac.. and your Heal vs. Mana. Bah! you NEED to know your area.. Where your Hunting and what to expect.  You can predict the WHOLE fight if you know what's happening in the zone, and what trains are where, and if a surprize jumps out... You will know not to "buff" out that extra 20 mana you got cause a train is coming..<P>I think that is the biggest problem of some clerics I have grouped with..  they are so focused on the "health bars" that they don't watch when a train is coming to zone and where you are in respect to that train. If you just happen to be in an area of "train" ville.. then you HAVE to be ready for a train at all times..<P>Staggering buffs (learned that hear, made me more efficient and I thank you all for that)<BR>Roots and stuns  (learned some tricks here) <BR>and Man don't worry OVER much what the exact heal heals.. Worry whether that tank needs a CH, CelH, Sup heal or Gheal.. (higher level remedy covers most situations)<P>ALWAYS have Group heal up.. I love that spell the mana is efficient enough to cast it more then once and save that chanter, Gheal doesn't cast as fast as group heal.<P>does this actually mean I have learned my heal spells?? (GAH runs screaming)<P>Well maybe I have, I can't tell you in Numbers how much that heals.. I can tell you in terms of "bubs" VS. the tank Level. <P>50+ tanks Complete heal.. I am not high enough for remedy.. so i have to use the most effiecient heal I have. <P>tanks under 50? Cel heal and G/heal up.. Sup heal uses more mana for less heal then Cel, and casts slower. I hardly ever mem Sup heal.<P>I dont know if I am a GOOD cleric.. What I do know Is my chanters love me..  <IMG SRC="http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/smile.gif"><P>Good luck and hope this helped<P>Shohanna<P>------------------<BR>Shohanna Curesurtales<BR>45th Circle Cleric<BR>House De'Vir<BR>Bristlebane Server</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#dedfdf"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">kitsinu</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Shohanna Curesurtales has a good point about group heals.  But not for the reasons she gives (IMHO).  One advantage is that group heals are one of the biggest guaranteed taunts.  When things are getting nasty and you NEED things off you casters, a group heal can taunt things on you where you can make use of your Divine type spells.  There is no tank superior to a Cleric for 18-36 seconds that the divines can give you.  I tanked Ixiblat Fer 15 seconds without healing with Divine Aura.  There isn't a tank in the game that could have done the same with legitimate buffs.  Clerics have different techniques based on stats and experiences.  We use different tactics, but the job is the same.  A good Cleric is nearly always hard to play, people push you harder when you are good, so the stress never lets up.</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#f7f7f7"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Galavant</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">I started my cleric as an alt of one of my too-many characters...he's since grown to be my main character. I'll advise you to learn your cleric the same way I learned mine...<P>BY PLAYING THE CLERIC LIKE YOU ALWAYS WISH IT WAS PLAYED.<P>Think back to all the times you've been grouped with a cleric. Think about what you saw them doing good, and emulate it. Think about what you saw that was bad, and try to improve on it. Reading these boards helps too, but a look at the class from the outside is absolutely invaluable IMHO, and you're lucky to have had it.<P>Since you've been an enchanter before, I think you'r going to find the pace of life as a cleric to be somewhat similar, if a bit different in approach. <P>1. You'll be very active in a group, but you'll be healing instead of messing. You'll have one eye on everyone's HP bars and the other eye on your mana. You can sit in one place most of the time, as opposed to jumping around trying to target monsters.<P>2. Mana conservation is something that ANY caster worth the title learns...enchanters and clerics learn it moreso than others. <P>3. A BIG difference you'll notice is that while you still generate aggro, you don't have to get as uptight about it. That robe you used to wear has been traded in for armor, and you'll have twice (or more) HP that your enchanter used to have. <P>4. You'll also find yourself playing traffic cop as a cleric too, a role you're already familiar with. Except this time you're the one saving the enchanter instead of being saved. You'll be using Stun, Root and Fear instead of messing. And if you liked Mem Blur, then Atone is your friend.<P>5. Unlike enchanters, clerics actually get respectable nuking ability, especially against undead. There's times that blasting down that extra mob may be better than all the healing you can throw. When to turn on the burn is a judgement situation that you kinda have to learn on the go. But don't think that just because you're a cleric that you're all defense.<P>6. Speaking of defense...DIVINE AURA. Keep it memmed and hotkeyed for immediate use. It will save your butt. If things are hectic, you may want to have Divine Barrier up too. Then again, if you're in situations where you need invulnerability every other fight, you might want to consider the quality of your group...<P>Oh well, just my two coppers.
