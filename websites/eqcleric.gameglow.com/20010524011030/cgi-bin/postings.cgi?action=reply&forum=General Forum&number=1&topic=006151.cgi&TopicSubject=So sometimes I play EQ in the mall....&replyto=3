No not really.

(Although now that I think of it, it might be nice to pick up a trade skill that way, as going LD every so often wouldn’t be too much of a disaster.)<P>So then I discovered Wizards of the Coast. (http://www.wizards.com) <P>They are in a lot of shopping malls all over the US. And in many of their stores, they have in-store computer gaming. They usually have 10-15 PC’s, high-end ones, with a fast Internet connection. You can rent on one to play for a few bucks an hour. (I’ve seen prices go from $4-$7 an hour.) Only downside is that you will have to set up your hotkeys again.<P>First off, if you usually play on 56K dialup or worse, you would really enjoy the fast connection. And the big screens are nice to play on too! You don’t have speakers, but they have a headset if you must have sound.<P>What I have noticed is that almost always when I go in these places, at least half of the players are teens usually. Most of the time half the machines are playing EQ and the other half are playing CounterStrike.<P>Having spent a few hours playing in lots of Wizard’s stores, I can tell you that it’s really an education listening to a lot of the other players talk to one another. (As an aside, when they don’t know you, and they see you playing EQ, they always ask what server you are on. When they find out I have a level 57 cleric, they are in wonder! I have to almost always spend 5 minutes showing my character off before I can start playing! Makes me kind of proud!  <IMG SRC="http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/smile.gif">  )<P>Oftentimes, I see players make assumptions about other servers that may or may not be true.<P>I was sitting next to some kid who was playing a Ranger in the Commonlands. He was arranging a trade (which he proudly explained to me, was completely one-sided in his favor… I asked him why he thought the other player was engaging in such a foolish trade, he just shrugged and he said “Must be ebayed, I guess!”) He then proceeded to burst out laughing because he told the other player to meet at “One Torch” and the other player didn’t know what that was. My neighbor then went on to call anyone “stupid” who didn’t know what “One Torch” was, until I let him know that in 57 levels of EQ, I had never heard of that either. (Apparently, it’s a hot trading spot in the tunnel in EC. On my server, all the trading is in Greater Faymart.)<P>So it does have it downsides, but it does rather make up for itself, when these other players (mostly kids) get to see stuff they have never seen before. (I never would have guessed in a million years that they would find an ordinary Dain slaying something worth watching, but when they asked what my guild was up to and I told them, they all quit playing and watched our entire raid! LOL!) You see, most of the people in the stores seem to have had real-low level character. (Less than level 20 I would say.) Although I did meet a guy who had a 44th level Cleric on Rallos Zek. We traded some war stories and I told him he should read eqclerics every day! (Shameless plug!)<P>Oh, and the best thing about playing in the mall? <P>Alliliel tells the group "No, I *really* have to go right now! The mall is closing!" LOL!<P>So if you ever need some EQ on the road, try Wizards of the Coast, it's definitly an education, hehe.<P>------------------<BR><B>Alliliel Archfalcon</B><BR>Cleric of Tunare<BR><A HREF="http://www.kriegeronline.com" TARGET=_blank>Krieger</A><BR>Tunare Server is my uber-guild</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#f7f7f7"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Llumis</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Heh, it works both ways, though.  I hadn't ever heard of Faydark being used as a market, but the Tunnel in EC is often home to 80-100 people doing trades on the Rathe.  I dont think anyone hunts in that zone any more, or if they do, they must turn auctions off.  I know I do whenever I go into that zone.  <P>Interesting story, though, EQ must be a very expensive habit for you!  <IMG SRC="http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/smile.gif"><P>------------------<BR>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<BR>Llumis Atreideis<BR>True Elf Cleric of Tunare<BR>42nd Blessing, The Rathe</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#dedfdf"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Kraphalis</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">LOL<P>That's a good story.

"One Torch" or "First Torch" is the first torch in the tunnel as you enter from EC...the torches are commonly used as meeting points for trades. I personally use the empty tent in the back of tunnel by the Erudite spell vendor...I consider it my own little shop.  <IMG SRC="http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/smile.gif"><P>Lesser market zones on the Rathe include Greater Faydark and Lake of Ill Omen. No real market zone has evolved on Velious yet that I know of.<P>But yeah, back to the original subject, I've played on six different servers...Cazic-Thule, Quellious, Test, Rallos Zek, Tallon Zek and the Rathe. You very definitely can't make any assumptions regarding the economy or traditions or player environment between servers. This is really apparent on the PVP servers, which have evolved their own set of social rules completely apart from the rest of EQ. As for the others, Cazic-Thule was dominated by merchants as of when I left. Quellious was a powergaming server. Test is, to me, a quiet, lonely place filled with a sense of foreboding...you never know when Verant will make some change that sends everything into chaos. The Rathe has been the best of all the servers I've played on by far, especially now that the uberguilds have split off and taken their bickering with them. <P>------------------<BR>Galavant Greenlabel<BR>M&M Brewing Company<BR>http://www.geocities.com/mirthandmayhem<BR>Rathe Server<P>"Judge not by size, but rather by spirit."</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#f7f7f7"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Pzar</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Little idea for you here.<P>Carry the .opt files for your char on a disk and load those in the EQ dir on the computers in the malls (if that is possible) and 1-2-3 you have all your hotkeys and socials setup (remember to remove them after the game).<P>Pzar.</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#dedfdf"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Alliliel</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">No, you don't actually get to load anything on the machines, even your own .opt files.<P>In fact, you can't even see the PC itself, it's behind a metal enclosure... much less insert floppy disks.<P>------------------<BR><B>Alliliel Archfalcon</B><BR>Cleric of Tunare<BR><A HREF="http://www.kriegeronline.com" TARGET=_blank>Krieger</A><BR>57 Seasons of Loyal Service to Tunare</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#f7f7f7"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Thalanar</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">I would recommend being careful with this.  I don't know that I would play anywhere outside of my home, let alone in a public place.  My concern would be people attemping to steal my username/password.  Watching over your shoulder ... keystroke capture programs ... there are lots of ways to get your username/password from you without you knowing it.<P>Maybe I'm a little paranoid, hehe.  For those that travel a lot, it is a good idea (and so is bringing your opt files along on a disk    <IMG SRC="http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/smile.gif"> ).  I would just advise taking as many precautions as possible.  Most people aren't "out to get you", but there's always a select few that will try and ruin everyone else's fun.<P>EDIT: I just saw your post stating the computers are locked up behind metal boxes.  This is more secure then, although it still is wise to use with caution.  I was thinking it was set up more like internet cafes, where they just have terminals sitting out in the open, etc.  I've heard of people using those places and having their accounts hacked.  I'm sure Wizards take as many precautions as possible, but just remember that you are taking a risk  <IMG SRC="http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/wink.gif"><P>------------------<BR>Thalanar Solal<BR>Cleric of Tunare<BR>Brell Serilis Server<BR>Leader of Shadow <A HREF="http://www.silver-shadows.com/" TARGET=_blank>http://www.silver-shadows.com/</A> <P>[This message has been edited by Thalanar (edited 05-01-2001).]<p>[This message has been edited by Thalanar (edited 05-01-2001).]</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#dedfdf"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Caleal</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">LOL, after reading this I drove over to the a mall close by and checked it out, there were about 5 people there playing EQ.
