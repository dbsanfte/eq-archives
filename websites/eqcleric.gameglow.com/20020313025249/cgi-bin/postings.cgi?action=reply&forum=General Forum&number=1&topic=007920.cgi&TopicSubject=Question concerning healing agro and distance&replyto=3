<TEXTAREA NAME="ReplyMessage" ROWS=10 COLS=45 WRAP="VIRTUAL">[QUOTE]Originally posted by Aiyre:
[B]First cleric in CH order will always have HUGE aggro.   Some of the times the mob will try to kill you after the ch lands, some of the time not.  If the mob you are fighting starts to run towards you throw on a divine if you can.  Some mobs, however, will promptly summon you and kill you before you even have time to start casting divine aura.  Its just how it works.  If you have an enchanter there, have them cast the aggro spell on the MT and the deaggro spell on you.  Also make sure that the MT has at least one if not two proccing weapons as that will help him gain aggro faster.  
Where other clerics will probably be able to sit and med, you should remain standing for a good amount of time as well.  The other clerics should become aware of the first cleric's possible death and prepared.

We have the highest warrior be maintank to build up agro before anyone else starts attacking.  I'm the cleric in his group, so it is decided I will be first in the CH chain.<P>The pull occurs, the MT draws the agro, and I start my CH.  CH hits him just as he frenzies, and the Maestro makes a beeline to me and sends me home to my bind spot.<P>Everything else goes off without a hitch and I'm the only death.  The other clerics never even got any agro.<P>After getting rezed back, I ask the coordinating cleric if this is how it was supposed to work.  He said that perhaps I should have been at the limit of my spell range.<P>Now, I wasn't standing with the tank, but I also wasn't standing with the casters.  I was maybe midway between the two.<P>This was my first attempt at an encounter like this, so I figured I'd ask to see what others with more knowledge have to say about it.<P>Bindol Stonehealer<BR>Vicar of Blackwing (Sol Ro)</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#f7f7f7"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Cland</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Hmmm, Bein the first Cleric in the Cheal chain usally isn't a gret thing, you have to be very careful.  <P>Usally Cheal chains start off with a lotta small heals so the first cleric can duck off the first Cheal.<P>I'm no expert I'm just learnin about them so I could be tottally off on this.<P>Also what leel was the tank?  And was he well equiped, a warior in full crafter + what ever he looted on hi first hate raid is gonna need more helas, and more time to get agro that a warrior using defensive discipline in full Keal and primal weapons.<P>My adive to you in that situation is to have both divines up, and tell the tank ahead of time he may ping pong to you.<P>Cland Carbuncle<BR>Lvl 56 Templar, Rallos Zek<P>P.S.

There's 2 other ways you can try to do that, you can try to heal from Max range (or at least farther out) or you can get in close, just next to the tank or right behind the mob.<P>Now MT should be mashing the Taunt button, you cheal, Maestro turns for you, if your right next to Maestro he doesnt walk off and make the MT come find him again.  You pop off Divine Aura and let the tank re-establish agro.  If you were behind Maestro when you chealed MT you can then run just past him and stop right behind MT.  Maestro should see the warrior and start beating on him again.<P>Level is a big factor in pulling agro off of a tank too.  If your 51 or 52 Maestro is a lot more likely to try and kill you mid fight for healing a tank than if your 59 or 60.<P>I always preferred to stay close to boss mobs until I got higher level, that way the tank was still building agro even though I was getting pounded on if they switched.  You should also warn any backup healers to watch the clerics until MT has agro firmly locked in place.<P>Grats on killing Maestro!<P>------------------<BR><A HREF="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=18964" TARGET=_blank>Grumbles</A></FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#f7f7f7"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Aiyre</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">First cleric in CH order will always have HUGE aggro.

All the clerics just kept MA targeted and threw a sup/remedy/divine light every so often and watched for enrage/AoE damage (I was in MA group, so I just moved up and used HB to keep damage under control). Think I ended the fight at 60m and the tank at 80h or so with zero deaths.

It looks like my main mistake was not hitting DA as soon as I saw Maestro turn to me.  I sorta thought that might be the case, but wanted some verification from those with more experience then me.<P>Answering the questions in order that they appear.<P>If I remember right, the tank was 55 or 56.  I'm not sure about his equipment, but I do know that one of our lower level tanks (GFay junky) had a better AC.  I think he also said he had already used his defensive and it was not available.<P>I'm 52, so yeah my level probably had something to do with increasing my agro.<P>As to why the CH rotation, I don't know.  The Hate raid was being run by another guild that my guild does alot of joint raids with.  When they run the raid, we let them call the shots.  So far it has worked out well, since their raid leaders do spend alot time researching things.  <P>I think this was the first time anyone on the raid had gone after Maestro though, so I think he was largely an unknown.  <P>I'm not gonna second guess the decision to use a CH rotation, since we won the battle with only one death (mine).
