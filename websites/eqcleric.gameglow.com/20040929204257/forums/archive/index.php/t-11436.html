<br />
Clerics claim they cant solo but yet you can - cant you? I have seen clerics in sebilis solo all the time. Infact, a cleric just today was soloing though a whole level of AA.<br />
<br />
I could be wrong but this is what i would do.<br />
<br />
The none undead method: <br />
<br />
Root target, Nuke target for 1k, then stun for 6 seconds, reroot, Nuke target for 1k, and so on. Sounds pretty simple to me? I dont always snare my targets. I usually just nuke them to death, unless its a mob with uber hitpoints.<br />
<br />
Also clerics that worship Innoruuk (or is it cazic thule) have a necro dot necklace that snares your mob.  Its not the most amazing snare, but it works. That necklace would be top priority for me if i was that diety cleric.<br />
<br />
You guys do have a ton more hitpoints then most soloers and alot more AC. I think what it is, is the fear factor. For those that never soloed they dont really know the tricks and pulling methods. But if I had a level 60 cleric I would solo.  Specialy if I had my epic and could rez myself anytime i wanted. Do it for a while and you get the hang of it. <br />
<br />
Mind you, i know its not as easy for a cleric but it seems like it can be done .<br />
<br />
Also, the grey was made for clerics almost.. 99% of the mobs are undead. Its like a hot knife through butter there. I see clerics soloing there all the time too.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Aorion</div><div class="date">08-30-2002, 07:04 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Not 60  but solo'd in Tenebrous today.<br />
<br />
Cleric root sucks.  Nicest way I can put it.  They might as well put them all at a 10 second max cause that's as long as they last for me.  And no I'm not casting DD's<br />
<br />
More hps/ and AC maybe, but being on  our own table for AC/def I get hit for max damage a good 90% of the time.<br />
<br />
I have 0 mana regen.  Wolf form I would love (not a cry to give me wolf form, just simple spell envy)<br />
<br />
That why I don't solo</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Quotison</div><div class="date">08-30-2002, 07:11 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Soloing is okay. I soloed 49-50 in DL by the skeletons. Wasn't too fast, but was probably faster then grouping in DL since most other mobs near KC were light blue (plus I couldn't get a group in KC until 51.. too low level maybe).<br />
<br />
The grey was made for clerics? One zone where we can solo is not good. Other classes can solo in a multitude of zones. <br />
<br />
Like someone said before, clerics also don't  have much in the way of mana regen. I've said this before, but I think small amounts of mana regen should be put on our hp buffs (maybe 3 on Resolution, 4 on Heroism/HB and 5 on Aego or something like that)</div></div><hr />

Well then why did Varent give you a 1k DD? Use it. <br />
<br />
I have 0 mana regen. Wolf form I would love (not a cry to give me wolf form, just simple spell envy)  <br />
<br />
There is only 1 spell that gives druid mana regen in wolf form. Thats form of the howler. Its gay, never use it. Any druid that is high end will use Mask of Hunter/Stalker. These are just buffs, dont turn you into a wolf.  I do think Clerics should get there own Manaregen spell. I think thats what that hammer is going to do.<br />
<br />
The grey was made for clerics? One zone where we can solo is not good. Other classes can solo in a multitude of zones.  <br />
<br />
Other classes have a multitude of rolls friend. Clerics basicly have one or two. Thats it. So zones are made accordingly.  Why would varent make a ton zones cleric friendly to solo in, when they know you own the group market.  If more clerics soloed then there would be less groups with clerics.</div></div><hr />

It breaks without casting DD's  Our DD is loooong cast.  Can't get it off when you being knocked around.  Druid root is better at holding than ours.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
At least one of them had to do with solo to be spefic soloing old seb zone in.<br />
<br />
<br />
Yes I can solo old seb zone in as long as I have c3 and even then compared to &quot;soloing class's&quot; its painfully slow dont get me started on trying to do without c3 :)<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
And yes I usually pull with snare necklace, hit it around with Jman stick for tash proc, root it with manaless root from click root helm, snare it with innoruuk follower necklace again stun/nuke/stun/manaless root/stun/nuke/'stun.<br />
<br />
<br />
Im not uberly equipped I only have MC1/ft3 and with c3 it usually takes me 3/3and half bubbles of mana to kill one mob and overtime the exp sucks compared to if I was to get a monk friend come to old seb and duo zone in.<br />
<br />
<br />
I see it more of a question of not &quot;cant you solo&quot;  but &quot;can you solo so its even worthwhile doing so&quot;.  <br />
<br />
That been said I wished I had 1hb sprinkler from VP with click stun/small dd to add to my tash stick,manaless root item, manaless snare item so far the most impressive kills in old seb have been managing to solo the named beetle at the guardian camp (drops css/some monk 1b), Sebelite Golem and managing to clear down to guardian camp without getting any respawns on top of me.  ( of course been Dark elf the ability to /hide is priceless)<br />

The problem comes in soloing *effectively*.  Wizards / druids can notch up easily 3 times the number of kills that I can pull off in a given time frame.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Vidar</div><div class="date">08-30-2002, 11:28 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Couple exagerations there.<br />
<br />
Judgement:  925 damage for 325 mana.  6.5 cast time.  &amp;.0 recast time.<br />
<br />
If you concider the Power of a DD spell to be a function of efficiency and damage per second (EFF x DPS), Judgement has 41% of the power of Moonfire or 51% of Wildfire.  Just to give you a perspective.  Our Undead nukes are better (same as druid anti summoned spells).  Brings us up to 63% of the power of Moonfire.<br />
<br />
Stun: Level 5 spell has a duration of 4.0 seconds, not 6 seconds.  It is highly resisted like all pure magic spells, but this one has a decent chance of getting through.  The other stuns are much more resisted due to their damage component.  Personally, I wouldn't bother with a stun soloing.  Just root and nuke.<br />
<br />
<br />
Can I solo?  Sure.  Worth the bother.  Nope.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Abyssak</div><div class="date">08-30-2002, 11:51 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I think it must be more of a preference for people.  I solo all the time.  Sometimes I won't group b/c the exp is coming faster solo.  <br />
<br />
I think a lot of people choose clerics primarily for the grouping desirability, and these people, I would assume, have a distinct preference for grouping. <br />
<br />
I chose to be a cleric b/c I liked the idea of role-playing a religious priestess/fanatic in Norrath.  :D   (And, of course, I enjoy all the things that clerics can do.)  So, I don't really have a preference for grouping or soloing.  Either is fine.<br />
<br />
Just my 2cp.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Quotison</div><div class="date">08-31-2002, 11:03 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">&lt;&lt; Other classes have a multitude of rolls friend.

<br />
Clerics don't own the market on groups. Granted, its not like we're the least desired class but by level 50 the days of always getting four tells for a group are gone.<br />
<br />
By improving their heals, they are bringing shamans/druids more in line with the cleric's grouping and raiding ability. Therefore, we need to be improved in soloing ability. I don't want to be able to kill dragons or quad kite, but I want to be able to solo mobs live and undead for an amount of experience that won't make me feel like I've wasted my time. <br />
<br />
Making more areas where clerics can solo (or improving our damage abilities) will not make all clerics never group again. In an time when clerics can be replaced in exp groups easier (which is fine, I don't think clerics should ever be necessary for a group), we need more soloing alternatives.</div></div><hr />

No KEI and little in the way of FT somewhat slows you down, currently making soloing for clerics without uber gear a laborious process.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">-=Mireth=-</div><div class="date">08-31-2002, 11:38 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Oh yes i can solo, and i prefer it over grouping a lot lately because i can do stuff on the 2nd pc and don't have to be concentrated every minute because people might die otherwise. It's not *that* ineffective as well, however, gear is a part of the success as is a clickable dot/nuke and always having KEI, but i come nowhere near the exp rate (only talking about aa exp at Lvl 60 here) of a wizard, monk or even druid that know what they're doing.<br />
<br />
But i disagree, having epic has nothing to do with how good you can solo. Also, i hate the grey, just don't understand how people can effectively solo there as non-invis-non-fd class, there must be a spot i don't know about ;).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">~Areina~</div><div class="date">09-01-2002, 12:41 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm not too sure where Windfire got his idea of VI making a ton of zones for us clerics but I only can recall off hand a few zones with undeads where we can try to solo.<br />
On his point of VI giving us nukes, the dmg of our highest nuke doesn't reach 1K unless you have AAP in SCF/Focus items. Plus its really not very efficient. If VI wanted us clerics to solo with our DD, they would have made it more efficient.<br />
That being said, we can solo but even with our dots, we're not killing all that efficiently. Our dots don't match up with any of the dots available to druids/shaman/necro, not that I think ours should but dot kiting just don't work for us all that much. Don't take weapons with free dots and the necklace for Innoruuk worshipping clerics into cosideration, not everyone gets those. If you want to discuss about cleric's ability to solo, use the general cleric's template instead of specific cleric types.<br />
Our epic don't really work into the equation for soloing. Its does not affect our ability to solo. We do have the spell at 56 and it only comes into the equation for our xp only if we get killed.<br />
<br />
To sum it all up, clerics can solo. But to solo efficiently is altogether another matter.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lith Ahntalon</div><div class="date">09-01-2002, 05:58 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well something a lot of folks forget. Clerics try and make up for thier lack of utility in the form of gear and potions and quite frankly what is available is still stunningly underwheming  for clerics unless the cleric either is in an uber guild and has the gear rolling in or drops an bunch of cash on items that have limited effect and still cost the cleric money after the purchase. Oh, did I mention we go through peridots at an alarming rate. Even if I consistantly had 100k plat in the bank and never ran out (dreams), well if I am soloing and die, most if not all of the zones I am even able to solo in with ANY degree of efficency REQUIRE utilites that we do not have as spells to either get to or move around in, thus if I die soloing CR IS A BITCH because all my utility is, you guessed it, ON MY CORPSE.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">sequence7</div><div class="date">09-01-2002, 11:46 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks for your advice, Windfire (funny thing a druid try to teach clerics, how to solo hehe).<br />
<br />
Can you imagine, there are several high priests out there with highlevel druids as alts? They have them JUST FOR FUN, for gate mules or to track Mr. Ragefire or mobs, particular for thier guilds...<br />
<br />
I, for example, did level 45 with my druid (femal halfling) in a time, when 45 was a really hell level, in a saturday afternoon and a sunday in FV near swamp zone at the giants. Harmony, snare, dot, root, meding while mob was rooted. Best equipment pieces: golden efreeti boots, shroud of nature and a sharkbone hammer. Guess, what a cleric would „kill&quot; at this spot in this level with better equipent, Windfire. - Nothing and without sow he will die before he is able to zone into swamp of no hope!<br />
<br />
It was my druid in the mid thrities and early fourties, hunting in frontier mountains for all the stuff comming from the named there and sold it to wiscasters. In Level 50 I killed the commander of the giant fort just in front of gd entrance  s o l o  with no better stuff than in FV.<br />
<br />
I checked out the spawnplaces of several epic mobs for paladins, magicans or wizards .... with my druid. And so on ...<br />
<br />
Druid roots are unique. Druids can track. Druids can snare and sow/greater wolfform. Druids have a cool dmg ./. mana ratio with thier dds and lots of instant casting dd things. If a druid will be hit by the mob, the druid does not really know, how to play a druid. Would you think, a cleric can do so?<br />
<br />
Give clerics items with judgement and exile undead by klick effects with NO casting time from spring to autmn and I think, clerics will be able to solo a bit. <br />
<br />
Don’t try to tell the people, what clerics can do solo, I really think, you dont have any idea about it.<br />
<br />
<br />
Thanks!</div></div><hr />

<br />
I can solo. I can solo undeads pretty easy. Well I bought a KEI, a few invis potions and port to GF and went to Acrylia - to the lava pool.<br />
<br />
Pull skelli - root (I wish I had a better root or at least an AA like enhanced root), dot (I wish my DoTs would last longer)  - and eventually finish it with a nuke. Because I bought KEI I could hold 3-4 spawns.<br />
<br />
30 min later: Necro showed up, asked me if I could clear the room (8 spawns) I said no, I have 4 and would like to keep them. He is like: LOL how can you think 4 skellies is good exp?<br />
<br />
ok, 20 min later I got  asked to rez him, but thats another story.<br />
<br />
Necro left, I got room on my own again. Palli enters the show. Asks me: can you hold the room? I said no, he laughed, and then I thought  I should be nice and asked him if he would like to group. He said ok, invited me and started whacking the skellies in a way, i could hardly melee the skellies in Freeport down.  He barely ever needed a heal and I could only cast a nuke or two before he finished them down, (800-1600 dmg) while his weapon was procing for 4000.(must be his AA skill)  So infact I was useless and it was really nice of him to let me join him.<br />
<br />
My conclusions: Cleric can solo, but many classes can solo much more efficient than us. Probably only Rogues and Warriors are as bad soloers as us.<br />
But then again, I've seen warriors clearing patch after patch in FG.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Deawellyn</div><div class="date">09-02-2002, 04:12 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok here goes my input as well.<br />
<br />
Can't we solo? Ofcourse we can - we can solo quite a lot of zones. But unefficient. There is 1 single class that is worse soloer than cleric - rogue. On a side note, ofcourse rogue as dmg dealer finds group much easier than cleric and the fact that groups can support up to 3 rogues makes it really uncomparable to cleric when speaking of &quot;chances for getting exp&quot;.<br />
<br />
Nice answer to main question would be:<br />
<br />
Yes, we can solo, but we cannot exp while doing it.<br />
<br />
For those wanting to hear numbers, we can get approximatelly 1.5 blue / hour soloing. Other classes get 1+ yellow / hour. Simple as it is.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Feckl</div><div class="date">09-02-2002, 04:26 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm lvl 26 right now and soloing at this level is virtually impossible and a waste of time since you will most likely die. Take into consideration that the best DD (excluding undead) we have until lvl 29 is Smite, which hits for 94 (I think.) If you are trying to kill even a blue con, it still has hundreds of hit points and basically, I never trust root for more than 2 DDs. So basically, when soloing, I go root/smite/smite/holy might/root/smite/root breaks/greater healing/greater healing/rez. Take note that after all that mana, I have hit the mob for roughly 400hp and I end up dead half the time. That's about 3/4 of the mobs hp. At some point, I'll run oom. If I'm lucky, no mobs will aggro me but it is very rare. I usually find myself running for the zone.<br />
Now, with that said, I'm sure many of you are thinking &quot;Why don't you go kill some undead?&quot; Yes, I do have Dismiss Undead, which hits for about 140hp, I think, but what zone is there to solo undead in at lvl 26? Don't say Unrest, because a cleric soloing in Unrest at lvl 26 has to pull from probably the 2nd floor and aggros are ridiculous in that zone. Any other zone that I can think of that has undead has yellow and red undead cons, rarely a white or blue. Even if I did find a white, I would probably get owned by it.<br />
So really, a soloing cleric isn't much good. First of all, we're forced to kill blue mobs with a bit of difficulty. With a good group, you could easily take out yellow or even sometimes red cons. I go to Dawnshroud with a group, pull red cons and get great exp. I solo, I die, but if I live, the experience is horrible since I'm stuck to killing blue cons.<br />
I'd rather have a slight chance of death with great exp than a huge chance of death with ok exp. I'm not saying that clerics should have the ability to solo easier, but then again, we wouldn't always have to run through zones shouting &quot;cleric LFG.&quot;</div></div><hr />

I don't have the 1k nuke yet, not old enough.  God, I would kill for a 1k nuke.  Heard from a guildie SK that he was soloing Revenents at the zone line in SD at 52.  Ok, fine.  I head myself on over there.  No C3.  No C2.  No mana regen whatsoever.  Pull Rev right at zone.  Dot, root, med.  1percent of exp for 4 bubs mana and 3 bubs health.  Ok, so that didn't work, let me try chain nuking after medding back up to full.  Marginally better, same 1percent of exp for... 3.5 bubs mana and 2 bubs health.  *sigh* <br />

<br />
seriously forget The Grey. Temple has the nice golems that pop when they shouldn't and it's usually camped by some druid or wizard quadding. If not then there's a group clearing it. Solo near zones? Forget it. rockfiend aggro is too large for effective pulling. Zone with 95% undead? Forget it, maybe 50% of the mobs are undead. Kurn has more undead than that.<br />
<br />
Well I might consider soloing in The Grey if I could get &quot;Undead Comet&quot;, 1020DD against undead for 300ish mana. but nop, I got an undead nuke that's weaker than my best regular nuke...why bother with undead when I can nuke everything for better dmg than undead with my undead nuke?<br />
<br />
Oh so I get a 750pt undead DoT. Nice, except of an innate high fizzle rate of about 15%. I wonder why people use it at all and mind me, my DEX is over 100 unbuffed.<br />

<br />
After 52 it just wasn't an option anymore with mudflation being what it is. My spells just didn't scale up with the hp's/resists of the mobs after that.<br />
<br />
I can still solo an exp mob (singular), but I have to wait 10 minutes to do the next one. Heck, even my warrior can do that, cept he can bind wounds and be ready to go again before me.</div></div><hr />

I remember when I first started trying to solo HGs and SGs at about 46-47.  I didn't have that much money to buy really nice gear so my wisdom was only about 145 or so.  I had to use almost every bit of mana I had to take down a giant.  If I fizzled a couple of times or got a resist it was gate or die.  If I did get the kill then I had to med all of my mana back.  Kinda sucks not being able to kill more than 2 of a MOB 10 levels lower than you.  Anyway, I soloed the spectres in Oasis from 48-51 and could take about 2 before having to med (maybe three if I got lucky... but that's cutting it close).  Now most of those MOBs are light blue and there are very few blues that have few enough HPs for my mana pool to last.  I don't think I could solo any MOB that is less that 7 or 8 levels lower than me.  Kinda sucks.  Maybe I'm not the norm in not having 200+ wisdom.</div></div><hr />

 From level 20 to 50 I was also able to somewhat effectively solo pre-expansion era, BUT  this was mainly due to me having a manastone. Without that item, which is slowly being totally phased out as they revamp old world zones even soloing then would have been a headache and probably half the servers never have never had access to manastones. <br />
<br />
When Kunark came out I was lvl 47, I soloed some in OT (evil cleric) but it was tedious and basically I killed a tiger, waited ten minutes to med to full again, then killed another tiger. Not very efficient, but I was able to get a lot of stuff done at home. <br />
From lvl 50 to roughly lvl 54 you can solo decently in BW and CoM. BW is by far the easier zone due to the number of mobs and the large spaces. As long as you stay away from killing wurms (WAY to many hp for thier lvl) you can kill a mob without much danger to yourself, but the experience sucks and there is still a ton of downtime waiting for mana to return.<br />
<br />
 After lvl 54, soloing is a joke, and each expansion comes out with creatures that have higher and higher hp/ac/abilities. I have yet to see any undead only zones, they always throw in a bunch of live creatures, or my favorite, undead mobs that can see through IU.</div></div><hr />

I soloed to 40, then went half and half to 51. Unless it's quad kiting or you have your epic, druid root/dot soloing isn't all that much better... tons and tons of downtime for few kills either way. Quadding itself isn't practical for everybody either... a LD while quadding is pretty much a guarantees a death, and most zones that you can quad well in without raising the ire of other players are hard to get rezzes in... meaning your connection had better be rock solid if you don't want to take two steps forward, one step back.</div></div><hr />

Oh, ok, so bind in the Nexus and buy potions, then run ALL the way back to the zone?  Not very efficient.<br />
<br />
I have very nice gear (1030 AC, buffed) and a Blackstar.  I tried to solo a dark blue Rockhopper yesterday by only meleeing (with MOK and MOR cast on it) ... forget it.  It took WAY too long AND I missed WAY too much AND the beast nearly killed me, requiring me to back off and root, heal myself, rinse and repeat.  Second time, I aggroed a green Rockhopper, which also nearly killed me.<br />
<br />
Soloing is just NOT worth our time.  So, I logged and worked on leveling up my 22 druid.<br />

My guild has nicknamed my spot in Maiden's Eye &quot;Rolist Hill&quot; since I'm there pretty much all the time when not raiding. I don't have much time to look for exp groups, since my guild raids every night, and I have little luck finding groups anyway lately. <br />
<br />
I solo any undead mob I can pull in ME with very little, if any downtime (I have maxed FT and a Hammer of the Sun, which is the only reason I can do it efficiently though). It's actually a fun challenge to clear a Coterie camp and defeat a Xi Xaui Cleric at his own game.  I must have gotten my last 15+ AAs strictly soloing...it's not AE or Cazic-Thule experience, but it's not bad...</div></div><hr />
