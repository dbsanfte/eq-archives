</FONT><HR>First, I am a regular follower of these message boards but rarely post.  I am a level 58 cleric on the Terris Thule server.  I enjoy the game a good deal and have been playing it fairly regularly since April 1999.<P>Now, I kinda wanted to get the sentiment of other 50+ clerics out there on guilds and raiding.  I was in a fairly large and powerful guild on my server until about 2 weeks ago.  The guild's expectations were that if you are online, you are expected to attend all of the raids.  However, I did not follow that tenant to the letter and only attended 2-3 raids a week, since that was about all I could stand to do.  We had a parting of the ways, and I have been guildless in recent weeks.<P>I have spent the last 2 weeks sorting out my feelings on guilds and raiding and I am still not sure where I stand, and wanted to hear other cleric's thoughts.  Since being guildless, I have done a couple of raids with other guilds, and I still get rather bored with the whole thing.<P>Typically for me, a raid consists of begging some poor druid for a port which usually takes a good bit of time, then making my way to the location in question, then waiting a good deal more for everyone else to show up.  Next, we buff everyone up, then make our way to the target mob, then we wait a bit, and then buff again.  Then several hours after all this started, the raid leader call the attack.  Everyone assaults the mob, I throw a heal out, get summoned and die fairly quickly.  Then I wait a bit more for a resurrection and if the raid was successful, loots are awarded to the people or put in a guild bank.  Now, if the raid was not successful, then it's corpse recovery time, and a couple more hours of buffing and waiting.<P>I am sure my attitude and my description of raiding seems kinda gloom and doom.  Just for whatever reason, the raid feels more like a job and less like an adventuresome game.  A raid is a fun diversion from exp groups when not done on a daily basis, but once I start attending them daily, I get that second job feeling overcoming me.  I am not sure if what I am missing is a connection to the people on the raid.  In my old guild, I always felt the people did not really care too much for me, and I do not really think I honestly cared that much for them either.  So maybe I am not overcome with joy when people reap the rewards of raids, because I do not have a real connection with them.<P>On a lighter note, I did have fun on a mini-raid of sorts the other night.  I have a very good friend named Darkpurse on my server.  She is a rogue that needed help with her rogue epic.  She needed help killing the guy in steamfont the other night and the general in kithicor this coming Saturday.  I really did enjoy helping her and felt good seeing here progress.<P>So, I guess what I would like to ask at this point is, how does one find joy in raids?  Am I looking at things in the wrong perspective, or is it just certain classes do not enjoy raids as other classes would?<P>Rhed Kross<BR>Erudite Priestess of Quellious</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#f7f7f7">

</FONT><HR>I think this feeling is the product of having been in a guild where the guild objective was power and loot... I'm in a smaller guild where there is very much a "family" feeling and friendship and having fun is the main goal of the guild.   The downside of this is that we don't have the power to do a lot of high power raids... (as is evident by how after several months I still haven't got the singed note from Chardok for my epic).   The upside of this is that when you do raids you are happy to try to help your friends and you get a lot of Joy out of seeing them succeed, as they get Joy out of seeing you succeed.   I can guarentee that when I finally do get my note from chardok it'll be a party in my guild, and when I have the water sprinkler... well it'll be even more so!   <P>I don't like constantly doing raids either, but when you are with good friends it makes it a lot more enjoyable  <IMG SRC="http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/smile.gif"><P>-Eachann Bronzeleaf<BR>-Vicar of Tunare, Tarew Marr</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#f7f7f7">

</FONT><HR>Raids can definitely lead to burnout. I'm by no means a veteran, but here are a couple of thoughts, for what they're worth.<P>First, do raids in moderation.  Since you've done so many for so long, you could even take a break entirely for a while.  I try to spend no more than 25 or 30 percent of my time doing raids, with the rest for normal grouping or whatnot.<P>Second, find a guild where you genuinely like the people you're with.  In my opinion, this is more important than uber-ness.  When you're with friends, seeing them get loot is almost as satisfying as getting loot yourself.  This makes raiding a lot more fun, since you'll often walk away with nothing for yourself.<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#f7f7f7">

</FONT><HR>I think that you will find you playtime more enjoyable without the burden of being dragged everywhere against your will by The Guild. I've been involved with a few, and when I feel that I've become "just another cleric" it's time for me to move on. If you're a halfway decent cleric, it is The Guild that needs you, not you who is needing The Guild; you can find more personable groups of people that bring enjoyment back to the game easily.<BR>Just relax, enjoy yourself, and get to meet new people. If anyone asks why you're not guilded, tell them you had a falling out with your former guild over the difference in opinion of what your time was worth.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#dedfdf">

</FONT><HR>I share your feelings on raiding for 50+ clerics!  Those raids are all so huge by necessity, that it goes about like you described.  In addition to what you mentioned, there is the expense of having enough peridots for all who think it is *essential* they have Symbol.  Sure, some raid groups attempt to compensate -- but many simply do not think of this "cost" to the cleric.<P>I am leader of a mid-sized guild on Erollsi Marr <Vanguard of the Iron Crown>.  We are similar to what Eachann said for his/her guild.  There is never, nor will there ever be so long as I'm leader, a mandate for members to attend raids.  Sure, this limits what we can do -- but we are there to have fun, enjoy friends, and relax.  <P>Having done both the mega raids <as a guest of some "uber" guild> and what our small guild can do, I find that I much prefer the smaller adventures.  There is more for a cleric to do with one group than when there are a half dozen groups all attempting to take out some dragon.  We are more needed and have more joy in being able to make a difference.  Yeah, I know, in the "big" raids, there is some group whose cleric gets this - but it is as likely to be in the group that never does require its cleric to do anything unless the whole thing goes sour.<P>Personally, what is slowly eroding my enjoyment of EQ is the way it is structured for the 50+ levels.  The number of 50+ players who are leaving seems to be saying this is true for a LOT of us.  I hope that Verant wakes up <if it cares> and starts putting in something for those of us who are not power players but just want to enjoy the game with friends.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#f7f7f7">

</FONT><HR>You have to figure out why you're playing.<P>I'm playing to raid.  XPing is a necessary diversion to get up to raid level; I've leveled my cleric extremely rapidly because I'm so BTDT (been there done that) with regular xp grouping in this damn game.  Nothing new, just the occasional new zone I haven't done it in yet.<P>Raiding is interesting for me, so that's what I'm after.  I want to go kill the big mobs, collect the big loots.<P>As a core class, Clerics are in an interesting quandry (if you're *not* a raider type player); guilds and most other players expect core class players to be in on guild events.  After all, these other players reason; why would one play a core class if you didn't want to be involved in guild events?<P>While it's not selfish or anything to take your ENC or CLR and say "nope, not raiding tonight", it *is* extremely disappointing to the other guild members when they can't raid because the two clerics and one enchanter online aren't interested in doing 'anything'.  Because we all know how this game works; didn't bring the cleric, didn't bring the enchanter, go xp.<P>Except even XPing in the 50s takes a cleric and probably an enchanter.  <IMG SRC="http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/smile.gif"><P>Funny problem; unless you're the five person group spinning their wheels waiting for a clr/enc, or unless you're the clr/enc who just wants to hang out and chill with your online friends.<P>Basically, if you play CLR/ENC, expect to get invited on pretty much anything going on at the time.  Especially if you've demonstrated that you're competent.  Doubly so if you're known to people.<P>I'd honestly recommend the 'just hang out and chill' folks go play druids; much better suited class for that kind of lollygagging.  <IMG SRC="http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/smile.gif"><BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#dedfdf">

</FONT><HR>Fact of the game is that if you are a 57+ cleric there's nothing left in the game besides raids. I too share your concerns about the utter absence of other options and am considering whether or not this is something I want to pursue. I have the same feelings about raids as well - it's not like it used to be, with places like PoH/PoF where a raid would kill lots of mobs and get a good deal of goodies - nowadays it's kill one big mob and get two or three things. All the prep and organization time really makes the kill itself somewhat anticlimactic and I wonder myself where the fun is supposed to be.<P>I do like all these level 55ish mobs that people have to kill for their epics, I think those are great. Low prep time, only need 6-12 people, has theme and story behind it, benefits are not up to the lords of random chance. Too bad there are no encounters like this other than on these epic quests.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#f7f7f7">

</FONT><HR>I'm the opposite...I've done soooo many exp camps in the past that I was sick to death of it.  I thought if I spent another day in Sebilis I'd die.  Then we became a raiding guild.<P>It was funny...we added about 20 people to the guild over the course of a month and a half, and *all* of the people who had stopped playing or only played occasionally came back in force.  Everyone loved it.<P>We've been doing it for three months now and there are only a few people who seem burned out.  <P>So what do I love about raiding?  The challenge!  Using strategy and skill to beat something that has never been beaten.  We just keep getting better at what we do every day.  There's still things we haven't done...going to Sleeper's Tomb for the first time, Yelinak, Tormax, Sontalak, etc.  We just killed Derakor the Vindicator for the first time last night and got The Statue of Rallos Zek to the T in The before we got wiped out.  Omg we all died about 3 times each but we had a ball!  And we're all excited about trying again soon.<P>Oh yeah, and there's nifty loot too heh.  There isn't anything I need that can be gotten with one group.

</FONT><HR> <BLOCKQUOTE><font size="1" face="Verdana, Arial">quote:</font><HR>Originally posted by RhedKross:<BR><B>The guild's expectations were that if you are online, you are expected to attend all of the raids.</B><HR></BLOCKQUOTE><P>You were absolutly right to part ways with this guild. For several reasons...<P>#1, a guild of that size raids just about every day. When can you level or make cash to restock your gem bag? They expect you to stay level 58 forever?<P>#2, Some people have RL issues that prevent them from spending the 3-5 hours minimum for almost any raid. This should not prevent them from logging in for an hour or so to level or make cash. Your guild had unrealistic expectations. Had the policy been, if you are online, they would LIKE to see you come, but not REQUIRE, that is different.<P>#3, No one (REPEAT: NO ONE) can spend all their time on raids. Take a look at the other threads I have seen here where other people complain that they spend 99.9% of their online time on raids. It is a quick and easy way to get frustrated with the game and with your guild. Which would your guild have prefered, you staying with them and raiding a couple times a week, or quiting the guild and not going at all?<P>#4, this is a GAME, and as such, it is for YOUR fun and ammusment. If something in the game doesn't make you happy, quit. Obviously the guild was making it not fun, and you left. Kudos to you.<P>I have gone on a couple raids, but for the most part, I am still in the EXP crowd. Once I break 56, that may change for me. But 2+ yellow bubs into 53, I find I would rather level than try to raid Skyshrine (or where ever). With the possible exception of Hate, as I still hold out slim hopes of someday getting EM legs or BP.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#f7f7f7">

</FONT><HR>I like Alendora's response.  Raids can be very exciting because of the challenge they represent.  There's the feeling of banding together to accomplish a major objective, of being a part of a team, of achieving mastery in a new area of the game.  However, I would not feel these things if I didn't like the people I was adventuring with, and appreciate their quirks.  <P>A guild that behaves like a place of work, an office or corporation, is too cold, too impersonal. Gangs of co-workers combining their efforts on a project...I would feel like I was along to operate the photocopier. Quelle drag. No wonder the original poster burned out, there was nothing to keep him focused on the positive.  <P>I'm only a 55 cleric in a moderate-sized guild, so we don't do Veeshan's Peak, but the tedium of the cleric's duties on the raids we do go on is minimized by the lively chatter, and that we all know each other's personalities from two years of play.<P>But the cleric's job during raids is tiring.  There's a lot to keep track of, and the need to be constantly alert is draining. I wouldn't want to do more than one or two raids a week, if I could find the time, in any case.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#dedfdf">

</FONT><HR>My guild is a casual raiding guild.  We typically do 2 or 3 raids a week.  Sometimes we do more and sometimes we do less.  We can’t do things like Veeshan’s Peak or Temple of Veeshan yet, but we are capable of doing higher end zones/encounters.  My guild is made up of a bunch of great people and I wouldn’t be in any other guild right now.  Many of us are raid oriented in that we want to do raids, but we also don’t hold it against someone if they can’t/won’t come to a raid.  We might tease them a bit and badger them a little, but if they choose not to come we let them be and don’t hold anything against them.  My guild is fairly odd since we’re made up of players in the age range of 14 – 50.  Our average age is probably about 28 and most of us have jobs, families, and/or obligations outside of the game.  If you’re curious, I’m 24 and I work 50 hours a week in Accounting.<P>I could NEVER be in a guild that I was expected to raid with every hour of my online time.  I play this game for fun and there are many times when raiding isn’t practical for real life reasons.  There are times when I get on just wanted to eek out another blue bubble of experience or two.  Then there are times when I get on wanting to go lay waste to Giants in Kael or bust heads in Hate.<P>As a guild we have discovered that we get burned out REAL quick if we raid all the time.  There are days that we just log in and get some experience camps going, chat with friends, or do whatever.  As for our Level 56 plus members, I’d say that 90% of them have lower level twinks to play for fun.  Most of them don’t agree that the only thing left to do at level 60 is raid.  One of our level 60 Monks enjoys going out and camping stupid things or helping guildmates get experience.  One day he broke the Warlord room for 6 of us and stuck around the entire time we were there just because he wanted to.<P>I guess the point is that my guild plays this game for fun.  Sometimes it’s fun to raid and sometimes it’s more fun to experience grind (some of my best times in game has been in a 6 person guild group experience camping).  We don’t force anyone to do anything.  If that person doesn’t feel it’s going to be fun raiding that day, we don’t hold it against them.  They’re paying to play this game and they should be allowed to have fun on their own if that’s what they want.<BR><P>------------------<BR>Quistil Angelwatch<BR>Cleric of 29 Seasons in the service to the Great Mother Tunare<BR>Islington Angelwatch (Semi Retired)<BR>Paladin of 52 Seasons in the glorious service to Erollisi Marr<BR>Phoenix Crusaders</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#dedfdf">

</FONT><HR>I'm a guild leader of a guild over on Thlouxe Paells, and I have a strict rule that guild raids are *OPTIONAL*.  Sure, its nice to see people show up en masse, but I do not expect it.<P>Any guild that tells anyone else how to play isn't a respectful guild in my opinion.  I totally agree about the whole vision that its all about the power gameing and loot.  I dont like it, but I know thats the reason behind it.<P>As another poster mentioned, we too are a family guild, concentrating more on the actual people than on power gaming, and getting phat lewtz.  Fortunately, on Thlouxe Paells, we have a large group of these kind of guilds, and we all work together to get to go to plane raids, etc, and for the most part, everything works out.  Sure, we get some pissed off people (Last fear raid we had a bad break, and CR took 10 hours, and a lot of people ate a few deaths), but for the most part, everyone is learning a lot, and doing a good job.  We are able to take down boss mobs in hate, and boss mobs in fear, and go on other such raids for the betterment of all the people that dont WANT to be in a raiding guild, but still want the opportunity to do it from time to time.<P>I wish EQ wasn't all about the loot to the majority  <IMG SRC="http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/frown.gif"><P>Aladain</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#f7f7f7">

</FONT><HR>ROFL Rayne<P>That is perhaps the funniest and diplomatic request to change someone's behavior I have ever seen.  Is that really you  :P<P>I also agree completely with Jassie.  Druids rock.  Clerics rock.  I detest most raids.  Because I detest sitting around waiting for people to come, waiting to buff, waiting for CR, etc.  <P>I love small group or 2 or 3 group events.  They are a blast.  So, that is what I do.  If a friend of mine says they need me for a larger raid, and I have time, and I feel like it, then I go.  If my guild wants to raid something, and I feel like it, I go.  I am not the only cleric on our server.  My guild has friends that are clerics in other guilds.  It is no big deal at all.<P>Find a guild that is oriented to people, not loot or levels.  That is the way that suits me anyways.<P>I play Tarf because I like playing Tarf.  Not to suit anyone else or to assist in someone elses raids.<P>Tarf Crackleberry<BR>51st Cleric and Devotee of Bristlebane<BR>Halfling<BR>Quellious Server</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#dedfdf">

</FONT><HR>Yeah, got a kick out of Rayne making that point.  We communicate, to um, communicate.  Hard enough as it is without that " U R" crap.<P>But I too completely agree with Jassie.  My cleric was born April 7, 1999.  I have two clerics born that month.  I had no idea then, a time when a last name caused everybody to ooh and aah, that we'd end up how we did.<P>To now have someone breeze in here with their twink, and tell us we should play druids if we are tired of raids and helping everyone get phat lewt, well, it pisses me off royally.<P>A real cleric enjoys being able to help people.  But I don't enjoy helping people who think it's <i>my job</i> to help them.  It's not my job to help them get the phat lewt they want and it's not my job to help them when they screw up and do something stupid.<P>And it pisses me off that when this twink was mouthing off about how we should play druids if we didn't want to raid, I (along with a druid friend) was helping a level 30  recover his bodies from Meldrath.  Level 31 after we got his bodies out and ressed them.  I felt like Jassie did, he insulted us both.  Ressed two more people that night, while trying to help another friend get an item he wanted (unsuccessfully due to spawning quirks <IMG SRC="http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/frown.gif">) and agreed to help with resses for another group, should they fail in their objective.<P>And then to read the next the day that I should be playing a druid if I don't wanna raid for phat lewt?  Bleh, this person has not a clue what being a cleric is about.<P><BR><P>------------------<BR>Tommara, Level 54 Vicar<BR>Tommar, Level 42 Ranger<BR>Povar</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#dedfdf">

</FONT><HR>Excuse me very much.<P>I did *not* breeze in here with a twink and tell you to not play your charcter.<P>Read. What. I. Wrote.<P>--quote--<BR>After all, these other players reason; why would one play a core class if you didn't want to be involved in guild events?<BR>--endquote--<P>Some of you have clerics started 'back in the day'.  That's fine.  Lots of people have characters they kicked up in the first half of '99, back when Kunark wasn't even a rumor.<P>That aside, clerics and enchanters are *CORE* character classes.  Verant has designed the *entire* game to hinge on their presence.  Anything except the occasional overland areas requires the presence of *at least* a cleric, and usually the enchanter too.<P>When a guildmember does a survey or whatever of who's online, they turn up so many tanks, so many casters, yadda yadda; then they realise only two clerics and one enc are online.  Or one clr and two encs.  Or some other number that basically results in "not enough to go around".  They're excited, thinking they can go do game stuff with the guild cleric/enc.<P>So to those other guild people, it's disappointing.  It's not your fault you're not helping them, and it's not their fault they need your class to get anything done.  Verant has designed the game thus and shows no signs of changing it.  Unless and until xp_group_oo1 or raid_group_003 get that cleric, they = nada.<P>So it strikes me as extremely odd that a core class player would be offended that people desire their character to be present.<P>I mean, yeah you didn't know the entire world of Norrath revolved around you when you started, but surely you've figured that out in the 2+ years the game's been out?  So, this isn't a new thing; people asking you if you're available for a group/raid.  It should be a regular occurance.  It is for my cleric, I get contacted regularly to find out what I'm doing; many of the tanks I've played with are always interested to get back into a group with me.<P>But as I said, do whatever you like.  But I stand by my other original statement as well.  If you simply want to log into the game and run around hanging out and talking and such, I strongly recommend a druid.  They have all the travel spells, have speed spells, buff good, and can even heal and nuke/dot.  In short, they're the perfect self-contained class to port to GFay and sell some stuff, then port to West Commons to sell some more, then port down to Ferrott to pick up a guildie left by the last raid, etc...  Druids are the perfect 'hanging' class, because you can hang and not be tied to the one zone (like you are as a walking class, esp tanks).  So you can hang out wherever you like, including with your friends when they turn up; insta port plus maybe a run for a zone or two sometimes, and you can hang out with whoever it is, easily.<P>Just so some of you touchy "people" know, the above is not a slam on either clerics or druids, or even on old school vs other school players, or 'powergamerz/hardcore players' vs 'casual' either.<P>It's just the way the game is.  Clerics = uber needed.  Druids = way useful for doing solo stuff.  Don't yell at me, yell at Verant.<P>Of course, the 'needed' part applied to standard nice people; if you think I'm talking about helping out the losers who send you tells out of the blue that go like "d00d I died, kin u rz me" or people that walk up and say "buff plz", think again.<p>[This message has been edited by Dalur - Veeshan (edited 04-13-2001).]</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#dedfdf">

</FONT><HR>BTW Nuelaan doAevum<P>This world doesn't revolve around any 1 particular class anymore.<P>I was in a group in HS a few weeks ago.  Another group from our guild was there and their cleric went LD.<P>They had a enchanter, shaman and ranger and 2 other classes in the group.  They went for an hour and a half without the cleric.  The ranger had to heal a bit as did the shaman in the absence of the cleric, but they were able to keep up with the pulls.<P>So as far as being a "core" class, that's not always true.<P>------------------<BR>Dalur Stouthealer<BR>59th Dwarven Templar<BR>Veeshan Server</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#f7f7f7">

</FONT><HR>Yeah, Dalur, now that you mention it, when I recounted my tale of one night's events, the reason the other group asked me if I would res them if they failed was because they had no cleric in their group.

</FONT><HR>For starters I think alot of you ppl need to mature to the lvl of a good argument. With that being said I don't think this topic is an argument but I do honestly believe alot of ppl have no real clue about some things, or for the most part either side of this issue.<P>For starters here's my Flame:<BR>Anyone thinking this is a "Loot" thing needs a "boot to tha head" end of story on that clueless PoV.<P>"But I feel that no guild should say you have to be here if your online, or else. Thats not what a guild is about."<BR>If a guild lists this as part of their core principals then by God you better follow it. If you don't follow this principal then it's obvious you either haven't joined this guild or you don't really know what you want out of the game. -End<P>What everyone in this thread has to realize is there are different reasons for each one of us playing this game. And we need to respect both sides of the fence(which some of you are having trouble doing, who are you to decide who's a real cleric and who isn't? you're nobody, live with it) No one side is more right or more wrong than the other. So get over yourself.<P>My guild? We are a raid guild formed from the ground up with that in mind. We raid for the majority of the week whether it's scheduled or not which is funny. We're into Overkill and it's not the Phat L3wt that drives ppl it's the comradery amongst the guild. We all like seeing ppl get new things. We all like seeing new places, doing harder things, and there's nothing like pulling off the near impossible and making it look easy. It's one of the best feelings you'll ever have in this game whether there's 3 ppl in your group or 300 it's still the same feeling.<P>Belittling both sides of this argument is pointless, cause they're both right and they're both wrong. If you want to sit in Oasis and buff newbies and Res the less fortunate, hey, more power to ya. If someone gets their thrills out of slaying some Velious baddie, hey, more power to ya. Neither of which is a crime. And if you think that all those in raid guilds are nothing but lootwhores and such then you're quite clueless. When my guild goes to Fear it's funny how we'll have more ppl there than you would think and hey! more clerics than you can shake a stick at, yeah...we're there for the loot allright  <IMG SRC="http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/wink.gif"><P>So wisen up, lighten up and accept the fact that there's different ways to play, none of which are inherently wrong(no stupid KS, PK arguments either).<P><BR>Sini</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#f7f7f7">
