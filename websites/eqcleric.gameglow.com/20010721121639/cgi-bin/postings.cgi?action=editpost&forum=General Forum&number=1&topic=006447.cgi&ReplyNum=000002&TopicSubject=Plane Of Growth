<TEXTAREA NAME="EditedMessage" ROWS=10 COLS=45 WRAP="VIRTUAL">You need to have a cleric and someone who can invis both bind at the mushroom.

When you initially rush in you go in invis.  The critters at the portal do not see invis (well i think theres a low chance that one of em can spawn with the capability but I never had it happen to me yet).

Run south immediately (ie straight forward) upon zoning til ya hit the zone wall.  Then head east (ie left) along the zone wall until you get to a platform ish place and a building behind it with a sentinel suit guy (red, quest person).

Here is camp 1.  Its the best place to fight as you will in general not get any roamers (names like to annoy ya a bit).

Pog is different to the other planes (baring mischief), in that the initial break is very simple, but you are penalised for mistakes.

As soon as someone drops invis mobs called "protectors of growth" (also known as pog's) will run towards you.  They have zonewide agro.  Any spells you cast even with them the other side of the map can cause you to go higher on the agro list.

There can either be one or 2 of these critters.  They are unmezzable but they can occasionally be charmed (trying to think if it required dictate - don't think it did always but sometimes it couldn't be charmed).  They can not be mezzed though, neither can alot of stuff in pog.

If you get 1 spawn then you are sorted as thats easy.  If you get two then make damn certain that the second one is off tanked.  You can not kite pogs particularly well since the first CH that a cleric does on a non engaged pog will cause the second pog to stick to that person like glue (can be abused by CH ping pong :>).

Most of the first half of the zone is pathetically easy.

Critters to watch out for

1.  Named trees (level 60).  Easy when you have a few levels (baring rumbleroot grrrrrr), but if you are going in at 47 then im imagining your guild isn't terribly high on average.  they hit hard and fast and you will be cr'ing before you know it - at least the first time.

2.  Treants.  Pathetic melee output, can't hit through a paper bag.  But the buggers have a habit of gating back to tunares tree and summoning everyone in the raid, one by one to their deaths.  Result in camp out and tricky cr.  Best to get all the tanks on one side and move it as much as possible, nuke at end as well.  Nuking from a clerics point of view is more important than healing.  It can absolutely not be allowed to gate.

3.  Phase pumas.  Just when ya think ya got em undercontrol the shaman has a few resists and promptly gets eaten.  Phase pumas have alot of hps are level 60 ish and are very very very difficult to taunt.  Expect to use da with these critters.  As long as they come in single they aint too hard, more than one and ya in a real problem as they simply take an age to destroy.

4.  Water sprite.  Only one of these and admittly not that dangerous.  It lives in the lake.  You pull it fight the critter, do everything ya supposed to and she gates back into the lake and summons people to potentically their deaths (although as soon as she gates ya high tail it to her spawn point).  Been on dozens of pog raids, know exactly what to expect, do everything we are supposed to do and she still manages to gate.

Extremely annoying critter.

Won't go into thiefingling camp as they can be difficult to break with kos people (we don't use any of that ponsey use non kos druids/rangers to harmony them).

The key to pog is simple - pulling.  Enchanters are there primarily for buffs at least in the later half.  The pullers are what designate how many you get, good taggers can train 15 level 60 mobs around and pull them off one at a time.

Most of the critters will try and root you (magic based) and will try and hit you with cold based nukes.  Having your puller have those two buffed is essential.

Bards make the best pullers of pog.  They can run around fast enough so that if they accidentally agro a boss mob (happens a fair amount) they can get out of agro radius and camp if need be (having magician in pull group helps with speed of pulling though) , they can run faster than the mobs (most of which have sow or cheetah on) whilst buffing their resistances so they don't get hit by spells.  They can also use their lull spells (theirs actually work) to help break up large camps of critters.

Btw the faction in pog is of no use to a dwarf cleric.  If you have a problem with kill the wildlife from a roleplaying perspective (although dwarves naturally like cutting trees down with their big axes - when not mining) thats one thing, but ya helping out the pog killers by buffing and rezzing so that can't be it :>

Pog faction for the different guilds (ie paladin, ranger, cleric and druid) wraps round so that anyone kos can become alley again after a few more kills in pog.  The protectors of growth faction however will not wrap round.

Also another thing, if you are gearing up to tackle a big beasty that there is a very real threat of wipeout, or whatever, then time the pull so that you have just wiped out the pogs.  There is nothing worse than fighting a tree with 150k hps and have 2 other mobs come and wollop ya mid fight.

The pogs are on a 25 minute timer it seems, however growth is so large that it can take a couple of mins for them to run from tunares tree to where you are.

Oh and another thing, as you clear out the first part of the zone (called the zoo) move round west back to the portal and then north to the ne corner to the next camp and pull more.  You will know roughly when to move when pulls take a long time to occur.  </TEXTAREA>
