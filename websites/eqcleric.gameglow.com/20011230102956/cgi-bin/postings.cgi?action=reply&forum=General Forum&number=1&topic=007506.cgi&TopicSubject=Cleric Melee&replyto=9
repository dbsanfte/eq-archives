I was working on my 2hb (which sucks) and got haste from the chanter and just started wailing on them.  Unfortunately a Water Sprinkler of the Forgiven (the only 2hb I carry) weighs a ton, so with haste I go oos in about 60 seconds.  Still got a couple of skill raises tho.  Unfortuneatly I let a monk borrow my FBSS (yes, I have one and yes I use it -- don't look so shocked) so I couldn't open any whoop-ass.<P>On a more serious note, I usually wade into melee when the chanter is being beaten.  The tank is responsible for keeping the main mob occupied and keeping his target so we can assist.  Therefore it's my job to keep the chanter alive.  So when mez breaks or adds come, I chain-stun to get aggro then go toe-to-toe with him until he's mezzed.  No mob can resist a meleeing cleric.  I can't deal damage for crap (and attack is off anyway when I'm just tanking waiting for mez) but I can take hits a *lot* better than any sissy robe-wearing caster.  <IMG SRC="http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/wink.gif"><P>-Fuz<BR>58 Clear Rick, Sol Ro<BR></FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#dedfdf"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">daku inochi</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Ykesha Club + Hangman's Noose + Shaman Buffs = Major Mob Aggro.<P>Maybe not as good as a tank near my level, but when I mix in Stun with a good proc or two, I get its attention!!<P>/fends off others telling him to sit and med.<P>"Bite me..
