<TEXTAREA NAME="EditedMessage" ROWS=10 COLS=45 WRAP="VIRTUAL">Well, for any of you who were upset at the way I voiced my opinions and that I should realize that people play differently and want to do different things so don't go knocking uberguilds blah blah blah... Well Duh. Of course I was being harsh. this is a friggin RANT. heheheh

Well, that out of the way... I was looking at some of the folks that turned me down in favor of the bigger guilds, and though they have gotten some armor and weapon upgrades, I hear more about their grumbles than their graces.

They went from being main tank to 6th string damage dealer, or that every piece of super-sweet TOVN armor goes to someone who's been in the guild for 3 years and is already far more superiorly equipped than them. Again I say, "Well,DUH". The folks I'm disgruntled over are the ones who think they'll join the server's biggest guild and be their new superhero. 

In my guild a level 60 warrior would be a godsend, in another guild, they're just the 10th level 60 warrior whos the most poorly equipped and least experienced. Same goes for a 55+ mage or a 60 epic rogue. I'd love to have these guys... Uberguilds have enough of em already.

Recently one of the larger guilds on CT offered me an invite on some of their higher level raids as they are short on clerics and could use the help. I told them I'd love to, and we started going over raid procedure and so on until they got to telling me how I'd need to temp tag in their guild for the raid. End of story. 

As you can tell from my sig I am a guild leader. I offerred the option to my guild, if they wanted me to go, and learn so that I could bring the info back to them, and they responded as I hoped they would with a resounding unanimous No. This means I won't be seeing ToVN, or Sraa temple for a while. but I'll always have a group of guys who would follow me to the ends of the earth (or moon) for some fun and adventure.

Last night we did some WW dragons for the first time. The loot was sparse. The death toll was high. But not a single person who went wasn't cheering and exstatic when we left. We had a 60 warrior from the server's most powerful guild join us to guide us and show us the ropes, and by the end of the night, he was asking us about our future raids and when the next time he could join us would be.

There is fun in this game. And its not exclusive to uberguilds.
