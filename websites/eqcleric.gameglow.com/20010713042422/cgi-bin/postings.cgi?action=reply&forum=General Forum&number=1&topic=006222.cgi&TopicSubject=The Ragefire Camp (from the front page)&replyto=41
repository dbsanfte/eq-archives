<TEXTAREA NAME="ReplyMessage" ROWS=10 COLS=45 WRAP="VIRTUAL">[QUOTE]Originally posted by Boanerges:
[B]I had a good night (Cazic Halo AND a friend helped me finish my VP key) so I am a bit more rational today...

Our problem here is that we have 3 major problems rolled into one giant bottleneck.
1. Zordak is an extremely rare spawn with an average window of 24-96 hours. You cannot "camp" him in the normal sense unless you have a dragon raid sitting or camped in the lair, ready to go at a moment's notice.
2. The quest prior to Zordak is much too easy and has lead to this backlog.
3. You must kill Lord Nagafen, a level capped dragon, in order to allow Zordak to spawn.

I will address these separately.

1. Killing mobs in EQ has always been touchy. To put it simply, the biggest and best organized guilds will always get the best spawns first. As the game grows to meet them, their former triumphs trivialize and the rewards no longer meet their needs.

But there is a NEED for things as time goes on. I call it "New Toy Syndrome": the need for something new and/or better. So those who want take what they want when they want it. There are no real consequences in EQ. But it leaves the smaller and less organized by the side of the road when the uberguild semi tears past them, leaving only their wake of wind and dust and an implied laugh of superiority.

I agree with you, Rayne, on many of your points. One person cannot camp Ragefire. And unless you park people down there, it's a race to get it. It IS harsh. It IS reality.

But it neglects one major thing... respect. It's one thing when cleric_00 who has spent days down there cries over not having time to organize a raid before uberguild_01 runs past. It is quite another when cleric_00 has a raid clearing FGs or buffing up and uberguild_01 runs past and takes Ragefire. THAT is where the bulk of the frustration lies. People will ALWAYS whine about not being able to kill ubermob X but what do you do when uberguild_01 lets small_group_02 do all the work to get there and then rushes past to take it. Clearing FGs to get to Ragefire leaves anyone who wants to a clean path right to him AND allows them to blow right past the clearers who are still recovering.

Verant's response is about as laughable and pathetic as Rodney King's to the LA riots: "Can we all just get along?"

Absor... in a word, NO. This is a CONSEQUENCELESS ENVIRONMENT. There is no incentive whatsoever to keep someone from running through  raid and handing their pearl in over those who have worked hard to get there. This too is reality. Verant's reality. AKA The Vision(tm). People can, and do, run each over to get what they want. It's the equivalent of telling a packed stadium there's a bomb in there and then telling the people to remain calm and assuming nobody will be trampled to death.

2. Absor did not listen to anyone serious (except Rayne). All the ideas he responded to were ill considered or downright absurd.

In a nutshell, we were told we're not worth Verant's time and effort to even attempt fixing the quest.

There ARE options here. Make the Overking drop less notes. Make the Iksar you hand the shell to in BW despawn upon hand-in and end "Ixblat nights" (if Absor wants something that makes sense story-wise this actually solves a major gap whereby the Iksar never actually dies). Both would create bottlenecks and solve the sheer number of clerics racing through. Already, major guilds have stopped giving notes out but the smaller guilds have moved up enough that they can kill the Overking on their own.

They COULD fix this and solve the racing through but, again, we're not worth Verant's time.

3.
 THIS is what drove me to anger. The rest was just a cop-out.It boggles my mind how two-faced Verant is here. A few cases in point:

Paladins depended on the dragons for books. After the cap, Verant didn't pat them on the heads and tell them "go organize twink raids". They put in 3 BRAND NEW DRAGONS to help them along: Gorenaire, Talendor and Faydedar.

Druids needed Faydedar to finish. But Faydedar depops after 1-2 hours. Verant gave them a triggered version that was HARDER.

Rogues had a Zordak-esque step involving a guy named Eldrith (ironically placed in the tower directly above Lord Burgurgle's cave) who was about a 60 hour spawn. Verant vowed to make the Rogue epic harder... what did they do? Eldrith now spawns about ever 12 hours and the house with the General is now up 24/7. And ours is EASIER then this?

It astounds me that I AM THE ONLY ONE WHO NOTICES THIS PART IS FLAWED. We are, in essence, being told that we must organize twink or pickup raids to kill Nagafen because that is part of The Vision(tm). I am glad that from Absor's cubicle that this is what he wants but have you ever been on a raid like that? They are awful. Twinks are often powerleveled and sometimes do not know their roles well. Pickup people are often people you don't know and every time you have a pickup raid it's like Russion roulette with a dragon.

Does nobody realize that had they not added the new dragons, paladins would be in the same boat? They too would have had no choice but to form twink/pickup raids to get their books. Paladins would still have gotten their FAs and FDs.. it just would have been a LOT harder.

The final insult here is that Verant, in essence, used their own delays to justify not changing the quest. I mean, after all, we're already killing Nagafen on most servers so nothing is broken... right? It's like saying that people in poorer areas of the world who drink dirty water every day are ok because they've lived this long drinking it, so why clean it up for them?

I don't think Verant hates us as a class. I think they are apathetic... and in this game, apathy towards you is the worst thing that can happen to you. And Absor is incredibly naive to think things don't need fixing.
