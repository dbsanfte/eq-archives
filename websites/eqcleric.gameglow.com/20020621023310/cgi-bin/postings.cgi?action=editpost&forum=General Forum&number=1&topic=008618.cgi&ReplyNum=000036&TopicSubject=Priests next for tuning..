<TEXTAREA NAME="EditedMessage" ROWS=10 COLS=45 WRAP="VIRTUAL">[b]Druids
1. A better heal perhaps a spell for a 2k heal @ 350mana 10sec cast. (2200 with adept 3). Level 60. Could crit for 4k, and crit with adept for 4400 pt heal.
I think after that they are pretty well balanced.[/b]
 
  Druids have basically become wizards at 60.  A bigger heal like this is pretty much needed though with mobs hitting for crazy amounts of damage.  NT/DL is really just joke damage and too inefficient.
 
  This would still leave druids not really able to keep up with, or even come close to clerics as healers and at a raid you'd still be better ditching them for you cleric alt.  But again, they are pretty much wizards.  What wizards, druids and clerics (the 3 non pet classes) need is higher manaregen to power nukes and heals.  In an xp group the necro's pet will easily deal far more damage than the wizard/druid will when the night is over!
 
[b]Clerics
1. Clerics would get group CE.
2. Clerics would get a class ability to improve heaing gift even further, such as wizards do with casting fury.
3. Clerics would get defense to 220, dodge to 120, parry to 100. weapon skills to 200, and bash. Also the ability the get some more HP via perhaps an AA or just natural. Clerics were supossed to be the most melee intensive priest. I'm not saying you will see us melee in a gorup, but I damn well better be able to melee down a level 35 mob at level 60, I don't have freaking invis, damnit.
4. Clerics will get a LOH ability in AA skills, perhaps to replace the utterly useless rez AA.
5. We would get the improved root that wizards and druids get.
6. celestial regeneration AA should either last longer, or heal more per tick. Frankly 2k heal evey couple hours over time for 5 or 6 aa is just...the suck. I want something I can use on a MT before the pull, something vastly better then CE.
7. Bestow DA should grant a small heal, I can't use it on the tank because he loses all agro and it prevents others from healign him, and if I use it on a caster they are still low health agro. 500pt heal would be decent.
8. Reduce periodot costs further. Perhaps make a peridot free Aegolism similar to emerald free avatar, rare drop spell in ST. Components are suck. Unless you want to penalize ALL classes on an hourly basis financially, then you need to ease up a bit. I know my enchanter doesn't use rune as much, mage CoH requires half as much and is used less oftem, necros, wizards..rarely use reagents. Tanks? BAH they don't use any reagents and they get all the loot that drops...they sell the old junk and keep the money!!![/b]
 
  Generally good ideas.  3 really should be applied to all non melee classes who take horrific damage compared to meleers even with the same AC.  5... which do you want, the utterly useless druid one or the highly useful but only once per 72 minutes wizard one?  The druid one would be better for clerics than it is for druids, druids want the wizard on!  Really druids and clerics got screwed for AA.

[b]ALL PREISTS
1. Healing adept should give more of a bonus. 2, 5, 10 is worthless. Try 3, 8, 15.

ALL CASTERS
1. ALL casters should get more for mental clarity points. 1 for level 1, 2 MORE for level 2, and 3 MORE for level 3. 6 points total...not 3.
2. ALL casters need focus items relavent to thier skill set dating back to velious. Give them minor nuke focus items on the highest end velious armor gloves. And maybe speed casting on the arms. I'd say equiv to mage summoned or about that. Perhaps half the effect on the thurgadin and PoG armor.[/b]
 
  There should be a meditation AA for cleric/druid/wizard that gives +10/+30/+70 for mana regen or more.  I'm not kidding.  Hey if shamans are balanced...
 
"Clerics/enchanters have no obtainable dmg dealing devices such as wizard rend robe/lure stick, mages chardok stick, velk noot boots. Druids kunark arms, velious bracer, epic. Shaman epic or jaundice bracer. Necro velk bracer, epic. They each have one WEAK item in VP, clerics have another item on an uber in ssra that is also weak. Not even obtainable by most, not anywhere near as powerful. These types of items are the staples of soloing. We need a new item added to the game for both classes. Prehaps via a quest."
 
  Cleric VP clicky is better than the DOT arms for druids, which while nice leveling aren't amazing later on and nothing compared to a JBB.  There is a druid rend robe now... in Vex Thal, LOL.  The Ssra undead clicky is, well, undead only, but the Ssra druid clicky is basically their epic again which is nice soloing but sufferes the problem all DOTs do, useless for groups and raids. =(
 

[b]Casters got a 10% increase in mana efficency. That's all they got that mattered to them.

The mobs casters fight were upgraded to handle the new melee output. Approx 100% more HP.[/b]
 
  Yeah, the game so heavily favours melee it's sorta silly.  Focus items and ancient spells were sorta meant to make casters uber at the high end like meleers are with the high end weapons but they're 10% more damage or 10% more whatever and, well, everyone has focus items.  =)
