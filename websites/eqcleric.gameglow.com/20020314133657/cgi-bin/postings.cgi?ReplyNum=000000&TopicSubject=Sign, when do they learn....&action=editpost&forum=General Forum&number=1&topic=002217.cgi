<TEXTAREA NAME="EditedMessage" ROWS=10 COLS=45 WRAP="VIRTUAL">Hello everyone.

Last night, I had a rough time with another cleric, and I just wanted everyone to hear what happened. His name is Fur** and his fellow member in his guild told me to write his guild leader a letter and tell him what our situation was...Please read it and tell me if I should of sent it: Please be patient with my rambling 

This is what i wrote him
<<Greetings Amar**** and other leaders of Kindred Spirits!

	First off, I would like to say, I really like your web page. Well designed.
	
	Back to topic, I spoke with Amar**** on this subject, but I would like to go in further detail. First I would like to introduce myself as Ellana from Preservers of Utopia. I'm a level 19 cleric.  Tonight I was playing with one of your group members, Fur** (level 19 Cleric).  Through the whole time he was playing with us. I had constant tells that consisted of "What's up with this guy?" "What type of cleric is he?" Etc. He constantly whined of not wanting to die and if he lost even a bubble of HP, he lost all senses and did not help anyone, constantly begged for help, and did not help the members who were in danger (run-on sentence I know =P).  I know this part of the complaint may not have much merit to you, but coming from a cleric who rather die then see her members injured, Fur** was a poor example. He healed himself before healing a member that was more badly injured, thus causing more chaos. He tanked instead of watching his fellow group members health. I admit, I was there helping and healing, but one's mana can only go so far.  Continuing on, tonight there was bug in the penthouse and centaurs were able to reach us.....I tried to escape it, thinking one of our members was down there killing it. You're other guild member Cand*** was healing and helping me, while I was getting mauled by 40-60 hits. I kept asking for heals, and I and Cand*** saw Fur** fighting with our tank (not getting attacked), and I died. When I returned. I said "Fur**, maybe I'm just mad right now, but do you even know how to HEAL?" <-----yes it could have been put better, but I had no intention to be mean. As a cleric I had to learn the hard way, I was hoping that I would be his lesson. He claimed that he was trying to heal me and that he healed me 3 times, which all the members agree, that did not happen. Our members names are rek**, ayabro**, and another witness was Ra**. Anyway, As I was going back to my body, there was another centaur on the top aviak city and I asked for help and ran to the group. Fur** did not help either. Cand*** tried her hardest to keep me alive, but unfortunately with no armor on; I had no chance.  When I returned again, I said that I was going to petition, and all the members agreed, except Fur**, he said that he wouldn't. I am sorry, but if he can't take constructive criticism about his cleric from not one, not two, but a full group of people...there is a problem.  He left the group and we all rested and tried to regain any fighting time we had left. That is when I began to speak with Amar****. during this time, I received a tell from someone name Drak***(who is Fur**'s other character) He said "why do you blame Fur** for your death? I said I blame the centaur for my death, I said he could have changed the outcome.  He kept saying that he healed me blah blah, etc. And everyone in the group said that he wasn't, and he wasn't getting hit either, so he could have casted. I told him he needs to improve himself as a cleric.  He kept saying that I was blaming him cause I was angry that I died. Which I was, but I don't blame in vain. I die a lot being a cleric, but not once has been because of the negligence of another.  The conversation continued and I said he was acting like a 14 year old whining to me and he told me to get over my death because I play eq all day and have no life. When in actuality, I play eq 1-3 times a week. I have college and work, so I hold my EQ time  as precious.
This case may not sound like much, but to a group of people in that penthouse in aviak village, this was a terrible night.  Cand*** said it best to the group, when she said Please don't let Fur**'s actions represent my guild.  I am saddened to think that guild that can have someone to admiral as Cand*** can have someone has negligent and selfish as Fur**. I don't know what I want out of this e-mail, or why I even bothered to say anything. I've never said anything like this before. I usually let it be. but this situation disturbed me.

I hope that this person learns his lesson and will hopefully learn to help his group. And hopefully someday he will bring pride apon your guild again, because if it wasn't for admiral Cand***, i would never look at the Kindred Spirit the same again.

Are you sure you need someone like this in your guild?

I'm sorry for the trouble and the lenghty e-mail. I hope this doesn't cause you an trouble, I am just a fellow player that felt wronged as well as one of your own members.>>

Lengthy huh?  :)

I don't know what I should have done. I was upset at his actions and how he handled his cleric. We were happy when I got him to leave. And with my luck. He is reading this post. But my main point of all this, is that some clerics need to learn to put their members ahead of themselves....There are techniques....Root the creature, continue healing members, ect. As a proud cleric. I feel that the group living is the main priority. what do you guys think?

Oh well, i think I just needed to see what other clerics would think..
Thanks!
