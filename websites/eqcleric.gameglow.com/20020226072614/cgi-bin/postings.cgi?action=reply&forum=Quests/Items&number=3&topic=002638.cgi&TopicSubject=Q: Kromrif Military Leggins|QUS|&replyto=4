<TEXTAREA NAME="ReplyMessage" ROWS=10 COLS=45 WRAP="VIRTUAL">[QUOTE]Originally posted by Lynet:
[B]You have more than enough folks for this.

You can get the sceptre, or you can also hand the dwarf i
n Thurg a bottle of Karsin acid.  Well, actually you pour it into his glass and he drops the needed gem as he dashes outside to lose his lunch.  The karsin acid drops from the orcs in the front part of Crystal Caverns, and is no drop.

Folks already explained how to get the wolf harness.  Again, a ranger with snare and panic animal should be able to solo this part.  If you hang out to heal and buff it will go faster.

For the final fight, remember the following sequence:
turn in harness to broodmom
two giants walk out of the fort
Brood mom walks up to the fort
fergul despawns and respawns after broodmom gets there
Broodmom kills the other giant, Fergul runs to the zone
you kill fergul and loot pants from him.  Anyone can loot the pants, although they are nodrop.
Broodmom walks back to the cave entrance and then despawns.

Do not aggro Fergul and the other giant until after broodmom shows up and they despawn/respawn.  I suspect that many of the bugs may have been related to folks aggroing Fergul too early.

I killed Fergul with cleric 35, warrior 54, druid 53.  We got him easily and also took care of a frost giant elite who got too close to us, although the elite was a mite nervous-making.

It is highly likely that one or two giants will join the fight regardless of where you choose to engage Fergul.  I have always fought him on the other corner of the fort - if he walks out and stands front right we kill him outside the front left.  Giants always show up at the most inconvenient time, I can see why Tunare is cranky with them.

And finally, broodmom is currently bugged and has been replaced with a placeholder. 

They are good pants, and I love my Velious leather look.  It makes me look so innocent and harmless.  Of course the Luclin leather look is not so innocent and not so harmless, and that is also fun.  <grin>

I have completely researched the quest with what possible data there is to obtain out there.  I can nearly recite all the steps without looking at every guide I've printed out.  However, I've failed to come up with a good list of exactly what it takes to get this gear.<P>I know some of you out there have this equipment, and I'm anxious to know if you can recall how you got it.  What I mean is, how many did it take to work the mobs over.. What ages was everyone?  Was it a full group?  Who was in attendance? What tactics did you use that worked for you?<P>The bottom line.. I have the following people in my guild that can help.  Do we have what it takes to get it done?<P>46 Paladin<BR>49 Ranger<BR>46 Warrior<BR>47 Druid<BR>46 Shaman<BR>44 Cleric<P>------------------<BR><A HREF="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=57051" TARGET=_blank>Skwar Rewt</A><BR>Proud Cleric & Officer of Clan Chaos<BR>44th Half-Pint Medic of Xev</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#f7f7f7"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Twinskey Bab0linskey</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">I think you'll be alright.... you can do most of the quest with one or two people if you want.<P>First there's the acid or sceptre from Crystal Caverns; I'd opt to take a group down to the queen spawn and get the sceptre.  It should be fun and there are other loots&XP.  If you can only get one or two melee, then go for the acid; it's a rare drop off orc miners.<P>The next kill is the Blood Wolf for the harness in GD.  These can be bought; real cheap too as alot of people think they're just sucky magic belts.  What we did was train packs of dire wolves onto the dorf guards who killed them; waiting on a bloodwolf to spawn.  The ranger should be sufficent for this part, I duo'ed it with a druid.<P>Finally there's the giant.. forget his name.  We fear kited him; you should be able to straight out fight him with the group you describe.  <P>The hard part when I did it was getting the broodmother up to trigger the giant sequence... I think she's on a 12 hour spawn.</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#dedfdf"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Shaadhi</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Just an FYI...<P>The Broodmother now appears as a human with the "!" designation before her name, which I am told means that she is not functional while the quest gets fixed...<P>It has been an extremely buggy one, from all reports, with the BM becoming the pet of anything or everything and not behaving at all... not to mention that folks were able to trigger the quest and then have multiple giants spawn and farming 6 or 7 pairs of leggings with one BM...<P>My Harness of Control waits in the bank until she returns  <IMG SRC="http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/smile.gif"><P>Shaadhi</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#f7f7f7"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Kessina</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">With your group, the most problem you'd have is the first part: getting the ancient sceptre from crystal cavern.  Your levels are fine but without crowd control and FD puller, breaking the Queen room (6-7 mobs if you are not careful) might be messy.<P>Everything after that should be easy.<P>In the last fight, I was with a 53 druid and a 52 shaman for the last fight.  I was 49 I think and didn't do anything useful other than the turn in.<P>The druid went into the cave with me camoed.  I did the turn in, broodmother head towards fort.  We re-camo. Got out.  I went to the camp spot and wait with the shaman.  Druid "escorted" her to the fort.<P>While many will tell you to pull the giant to EW zone, it is way easier to pull him towards the river.  The druid snared him, and pulled him pass the river (in the area NW of the wurm cave entrance.  When he arrived, we rooted him and DoT him to death.  That was it.<P>Good Luck.  <IMG SRC="http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/smile.gif"><P>------------------<BR>Kessina Terok - 56 Templar of Tunare - The Hand - Xev Server</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#dedfdf"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Lynet</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">You have more than enough folks for this.<P>You can get the sceptre, or you can also hand the dwarf i<BR>n Thurg a bottle of Karsin acid.
