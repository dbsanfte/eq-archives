<TEXTAREA NAME="EditedMessage" ROWS=10 COLS=45 WRAP="VIRTUAL">You may say that most of the time during a CH chain the ch doesn't hit for anythign close to max hp, but you have to use CH on the thing anyway.

There are mobs that do 700ish dps against defensive warriors.  Assuming they double hit half the time, and quad 20% of time or slightly less max damage in a 2 second interval would be roughly 2800 .... not counting flurries which could add another 2k or so easy.  Even if most CH's don't hit for full and only land healing maybe 1400-2000 hit points you can't rely on that because once every 5 or 6 rounds he will take 4500-5k damage.  If you've ever fought stuff like this you'll know how much dps you lose when getting the chain pointed at a new tank and the new tank getting aggro while the mob ping pongs a bit and kills a couple more people (futher lowering dps).  You have to have enough healing land each round of combat to heal the max possible damage output of the critter in question.  

Second piece of the puzzle...how much mana does this take and how long before people go oom (as well as time in the chain to modrod/etc.)  I'm talking 2second ch rotations with 6 people not 4-8 second stuff.  Takes 6 people minimum with recast time on icons to hold a 2 second rotation.  For a pile of druids to step into one spot in this rotation and be able to heal the worst case damage it would take 6 druids all casting simultaneous Nature's touches to replace one cleric.  That's a change in efficiency mana wise of 400 mana from one cleric vs 2400mana from 6 druids (400 each.)  

Now to replenish that mana in a fight to keep it up they're also going to hit 6x as many modrods as a single cleric would doing the same thing as well.

The other piece of the problem is this the best non complete heal spells a cleric has (both instant and over time) avg roughly 3:1 hp/mana in the case of divine light, or 5:1 hp/mana in the case of celestial elixir.  Neither can compare to the potentially 17:1 or so possible via complete heal.  

People won't use new heals unless their efficiency is at least better or the casting time is faster.  Personally I'd use a 5 second casting CH for 550 mana sometimes.  But not during these kinds of encounters, for the sole reason that it's less efficient.  

Do you really think they can fix this now?  The only way to "fix" it would be to either remove the spell or drastically alter it's efficiency both of which would require an ungodly ammount of retuning of the existing high end game.  Also both of which would just end up net effect probably requiring even more clerics for raids, while making them even less desireable in grind groups.

I personally think they should add a lvl 58 or so upgrade to divine light.  2000hp heal (1800hp base in spdat is fine) for 300mana with a casting time of 4sec.  Yes that's better than divine light in every way.  Why is it that nukes dmg/mana ratios get better while heals don't improve that much.  

We basically use 3 or 4 healing spells in our lineup (not counting group heals which are situational) that's Complete Heal, Divine Light, Celestial Elixir, and Remedy (situational and just because of the range.)

Remedy hp/mana ratio is almost identical to Divine Light the only difference is how fast we can drop hp into a target 3sec cast vs 4.5 second cast.  So same mana for same hp healed just can do DL is roughly 222hp/sec while remedy is 166hp/sec.  Complete Heal with a 6500hp heal is 650hp/sec.  

Anyway, I've already gone on to long, maybe I'll add some more later....
