<TEXTAREA NAME="ReplyMessage" ROWS=10 COLS=45 WRAP="VIRTUAL">[QUOTE]Originally posted by Wyndal:
[B]I have a 16 HIE Cleric that I play once a week with 5 friends.  Our group consists of cleric (me), enchanter, warrior, ranger, and bard.  Sometimes, we pickup a sixth player.  We play these characters only once a week because of one friend's RL commitments.  The rest of us play other characters during the week.  This is my first cleric and I must say that I enjoy playing him more than my bard or druid.  I'm having some problems with heals and I need some sage advise.

My spell lineup during combat consists of yaulp, root, stun, smite, expulse undead, light heal, heal, divine aura.  I use one of the slots to swapout buff spell.  My normal technique is to watch the battle and heal as necessary.  I stun/root stray mobs on the enchanter and keep a very watchful eye on the bard's health bar.  When fighting just one mob, I melee some and nuke a little just to do something different.  But meleeing and nuking is an exception and not the way I normally play.

My problem is that our bard and enchanter are dying too much (in my opinion), and this is happening when I have plenty of mana.  During the start of the fight, I have been healing the bard when he drops 1 to 1.5 bubbles.  He drops so fast and my heal spell cycles so slow (to me) that I try to keep him from dropping below 50 percent.  Typically on a multi-mob pull, things go good until the enchanter gets resisted.  Then I start getting attacked and althought I have AC and HP to absorb the blows, I can't get a heal off.  In the time it takes me to stun/root park the mob, then fire a heal at the bard or enchanter, one or both are dead.  I feel real bad when one of them dies; I actually take it personal.  Here I am with most of my health, most of my mana, and I have 1 or 2 dead friends on the ground.

My enchanter friend and I were talking this morning about when to heal.  We agreed that the early healing on my part probably moved me to the top of the agrro list.  Example: 3 mobs; group fights 1 mob; enchanter mezzes 2 mobs; cleric heals bard for couple 100 HPs; mezz breaks and enchanter gets resisted on first try; both mobs pay visit to cleric.  Now bard is below 50 percent and dropping fast.  Cleric's heal spell keeps getting interrupted because he's getting beat on and someone dies.

I hope my post is not too confusing to read; I really need some help on technique.  I want to be a good cleric.  Please help me!!

The tanks need to taunt more if a few simple heals are making the mobs aggro on you.  The other option is to stay a bit farther back from combat in multi-mob pulls, so that the mobs will have to go farther to get to you, and it will a)give you more time to root one, b)give the tanks more time to taunt it off of you, and c)sometimes the mobs wont come to you if you are farther away.  <BR><P>------------------<BR>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<BR>Llumis Atreideis<BR>True Elf Cleric of Tunare<BR>43rd Blessing, The Rathe<BR>Secret Tribe of the Phoenix</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#f7f7f7"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Tundar</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Yup, the bard is creating MUCH aggro singing.<BR>The tanks (especially the warrior) should use taunt ALL THE TIME!<BR>I'm not that familiar with bards, but if he sings a damage song (or heal song), then your are royally screwed. No one can taunt anything off him in that way.<P>Try having him sing a battle song instead.<BR>Also tanks with a 2-handed weapon doesnt create as much aggro as one with 2 weapons.<P>You shouldn't be healing the bard at all if you can control aggro, but the tanks.</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#dedfdf"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Tarf</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">There are several aspects to your situation that I find interesting.<P>First, part of the problem you are having is Unrest as Brazzo said.  Unrest is a very difficult dungeon with abominable pathing and a well deserved reputation for nasty trains. If you are going to be successful in Unrest your group needs to work together, more so then in other zones.  But I like Unrest, your group needs to get the hang of it.<P>Second, I had a bard friend that played like that once.  She died a lot. I tried explaining some things to her, but she didn't want to hear it.  She was also a friend of mine, so I kept playing with her.  She kept dying a lot.<P>Third, Controlling aggro is one of the most important things to playing every class in EQ.  Some classes want to have aggro, some want it some of the time and some never want it.  Your warrior needs to get the aggro in this situation.  Your ranger can pull mobs out of the group for you to root and the chanter to mez.  Makes crowd control supereasy to do it that way.  Pull 5 mobs, Warrior tanks 4, ranger pulls one out of the pack, you root it, chanter mezzes it, ranger has already pulled another one out, you root, chanter mezzes, ranger pulls a third one out, you heal warrior, ranger tanks a bit, warrior kills first mob and warrior reacquires aggro on second mob.  Fun stuff.  However, it is dependent on the enchanter and the bard not developing aggro.<P>It is not your fault.  Clerics are not goddesses.  They have a few crowd control spells, some nice buffs and a number of heal spells.  They also have some pretty decent DDs.  Bards and Rangers who try to tank will drain your mana into the ground, unless they are very very good.  When people in your group die, it may be because they are not playing their class correctly.  If they play their class badly, it forces you to play your class badly (I.E. Dumping your mana to save a bard's life because he won't manage aggro properly).<P>Tarf</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#f7f7f7"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Kerith Tellorn</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Well, being primarily a bard player I can give a few tips for your bard friend.<P>1) Don't sing songs during the pull.  Wait until the baddies are in, let the warriors smack a few hits + taunt, then fire up the songs.<P>2) Don't start swinging right away (if they're a weapon bard).  See #1<P>3) Get a little distance (same for the 'chanter).  Back up as much as possible and still have song range.  Take some practice and group coordination, but helps quite a bit.<P>4) Watch the AE songs (largo's, damage songs, Lullaby, etc).  If the tanks aren't taunting ALL monster and smacking them a few times, then the ones not getting hit will quickly find targets in your group.<P>I know not cleric tips, but some some points:<P>Lull.  Maybe let the bard pull.  Between Selos + Lull you shouldn't get more than single or double pulls 9 times out of 10.  The bard doesn't have the dreaded mana song so no reason to keep him sitting on the group.<P>Selos kiting.  I see people whine about this all the time.  But if a bard draws 2-3 aggro, fire up Selo's pull them slightly aside and kite them in a tight circle.  Let the rest of the group finish off a badie, then root one from the bard's kite.  Bard then moves kite off a bit and let group kill off second...keep repeating.  Only works out doors.<P>Unfortunately, it won't be until the mid-late 20's the bard really comes into his or her own with cc spells such as fear, consonant chain, pixie strike and charm.  But when they do a bard/chanter combo can really pin down trains.<P>Hope that helps a bit.<P>K</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#dedfdf"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Balator</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">During my unrest days, I had a bard friend that used to die 7 to 8 times a night.  This would usually leave me feeling awful about all his death.  Then I started noticing that he would die that much even with 2 clerics in the group trying to keep him alive.  It was not until he learned some of the tricks that people are mentioning in this thread that he started to die a lot less and become much less of a mana sponge to me.  Your in for a bunch of tough levels until you hit level 24.  The simple fact of the matter is, the level 14 heal is not powerful enough to keep up with the damage that 2 or 3 mobs can dish out at the same time.  Good luck, if you make it into the 30's you will find that clerics are one of the best classes in the game.</FONT></TD></TR></TABLE>
