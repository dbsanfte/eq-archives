The other day we had a low level (level 25-32) ae group going in cazic.  3 wizards, enchanter, nec, bard.  We were easily clearing every mob from the archon temple to the courtyard.  Only death was the nec puller until we got brave and decided to pull the entire archon temple and the enchanter was interrupted too often by the higher level mobs.

Since ae damage spells are balanced with regard to hitting about 3 mobs, if you hit 6 mobs you are being insanely efficent.  Imagine what the efficency is like if you hit 26 mobs with a single ae!<P>Ok as dalur has stated in another thread, these really are not your simple pick the first person to come into the zone type of group.  You need to hand pick classes, and knowing people who know what they are doing is always an added bonus (but thats true for all groups).<P>Note this, AE groups whilst making a mockery of downtime are balanced with regard to risk.  It is unlikely unless you ae for months continuously (like our group did :>) that you will be able to pull 20 mobs continuously and for it to be safe.  Deaths are expected, but if people die, the biggest hit (assuming you dont gate out) will be the exp lost because you were not around for all of the kills.<P>This guide is meant to be for high level people, 53-59 players.<P>So who do we need?<P>1.  Enchanter - Simply put you can not do an ae group without one.<P>After enchanter there are a number of classes that stand head and shoulders above others<P>2.  Cleric - required level of buffs, without marzin and heroism enchanter gets taken down quickly by mobs that resist.  Incredible healing power and surprisingly a good area of ae damage spells.<P>3.  Wizards - Anyone who has grouped with a level 56 wizard in an ae group will know how godly powerful they are.  A single wizard is worth 2 of any other class in the damage giving role.  They are capable of chain casting their post 50 very efficient ae spells at 56 and whilst going dry of mana quickly will flatten mobs before you can spin round.<P>4.  Bards - Surprisingly they are excellent for ae groups.  They get a number of songs that increase casters mana regenaration (ae groups are all casters except for bard), do a bit of damage, reduce mob damage, and reduce resist rate of spells.<P><BR>Class two classes are<P>5.  Magician - whilst not as good as wizards, they are the next caster you would use if you couldn't get 2 wizards.  Good damage output.<P>6.  Druid - Surprisingly beaten in every catagory by clerics except they can act as a backup evac.  Druids only get one line of ae spells (I think - not terribly certain of this), no ability to buff if grouped with a cleric, poorer healing skills.<P>7.  Shaman - not terribly good really.  They have a few ae damage spells but not alot.  They can provide healing backup though.<P>My common group was<P>Enchanter, cleric, wizard, open (powerleveled class - wizard or magician), bard, druid.<P>I'll explain the spells used for all classes and the rough tactics.<P>What spells do I use?<P>Clerics<P>Full Buffs (AC buffs only with free buffs)= before combat<P>Remedy = healing pullers, topping up.<P>Divine light = main heal spell.  Anyone gets much attention you cast this regardless of efficiency.<P>Heroic bond/group heal = Use when enchanter gets a number of resists or gets summoned.  Damage is often spread and spamming group heal will help alot.<P>Celestial heal/elixa = use on chanter/puller, before you engage mobs, attempt to maintain on enchanter at all times if able.  Use for topping up over remedy if heal is not required that very second.<P>Stun command = useful for stunning extras to be mezzed for the main pull, helps occasionally when enchanter has resists, but 4 critter limit, reduces its ability to help save the situation.<P>Upheaval/word divine = if ya got free mana and situation is under control then go for it.  remember that upheaval is AE round target and word divine is ae round yourself (much smaller radius getting all will be an act of god).<P>Enchanter<P>Buffs you want = clarity 2, shish or augmentation, enlightenment, group magic resist, bedlam (if situation demands it - like ya trying to beat ya ae record heh).<P>Ae stun = chanter spams this in battle, stunning everything nearby.  Core spell that makes ae possible.<P>Ae tash = use this between stuns to help with stunning at a later date.  It seems to have a limite to the number it will target (under 10) so if you are fighting more than 10 then it might be an idea to ae tash as you go along.<P>Mez = occasionally you will get resistant critters that you can not kill at the end of combat because all the damage dealers are oom.  These need mezing.  Likewise sometimes you go too quick and wollop 90% of the critters and get the other 10% respawn on ya after.<P><BR>Wizards/magicians<P>AE damage spells = very important that they use the correct ones.  If they get mixed up and use quad kiting spells then you will be in trouble.  This happens more often than you would think.  So make damn sure before combat they know the correct ones to cast<P>Druids/shaman = backup heal to cleric and additional ae nuke power (do shaman get any ae nukes?)<P>Bards<P>Catana = use this all the time.  mana regen helps chanter not lose much mana ae stunning (ya can sit there ae stunning 10 mobs continuously waiting for another pull of 10 mobs to get there), nuff said - amazing song.<P>AE slow = very important song to sing.  If 10 mobs break stun and all hit people they can do alot of damage very very quickly.  slowed mobs reduce this affect greatly.  Also very useful for pulling as it annoys the mob (without damage - hence no chance of summon) whilst reducing how much damage it can do to ya whilst ya pull it.  It is good at the end of a fight to switch from the good melee slow, to a higher level of snare (level 20 ish song) for the later part of the fight so that runners do not occur much.  Runners are not generally much of a problem with you clearing out every single spawn within running distance, but they are still annoying.<BR>AE dot/magic resistance reduce song = at 59 bards get a nice ae dot (with dd component) that also reduces the resists on the target.  This is great as not only does it damage them, everyone else can damage/stun them with greater efficiency.<P>Thats the main lot of spells at least.<P>AEing and the stack!<P>Ok heres where we go over what is involved with aeing.  There is one rule, watch the enchanters hps like a hawk, don't let them drop at all unless you are running low on mana and you want to make your last heal count.  Its really rather simple in concept but the particulars can get tricky.  Basically it goes like this<P>1.  Everyone buffs up with cleric and enchanter buffs (leaving room for celestial healing and a few bard buffs if grouped with bard).<BR>2.  Everyone gets to fom.<BR>3.  Enchanter runs off to just outside of agro range of the first set.<BR>4.  Cleric celestial heals chanter.<BR>5.  Chanter rushes off, everyone else sticks to chanters side like glue.  After you have collected a number of mobs you should stop and stun for a bit, checking resistance on the mobs and collecting them together.  Having the entire group get separated, and then having 10 critters all hit you at the same time is nasty.<BR>6.  Get to a position that you can ae safely.<BR>7.  Chanter checks resist rate.  If its going good then you can continue to stun whilst you get more.  Celestial heal the bard, and then he/she can run off and collect twice as many as you have at the moment.<BR>8.  Any doors that require opening for bards return journey are opened by damage dealers.  Remedy is used continously on bard when returning, assuming you can take your attention away from the enchanter.<BR>9.  When bard returns the assigned watcher (wizard normally) checks out the targets, all the while the enchanter is ae stunning.  You are checking to see if the stack (group of mobs) has been formed so ae casting can commence.  It is very important at this stage that summoners (krups in seb) are not damaged whilst outside the stunning radius as they can summon the enchanter and that can cause alot of pain if it leaves most of the existing mobs outside the stun radius for the next lot of stuns.  tank mobs are not too hard to stack.  Casters can be a pain as they stop out of range and start nuking you.  Either they will run out of mana and come join the fun or you can break line of sight and they will run at ya.<BR>10.  When the stack has been formed the damage dealers give it for all its worth.  Backup damage dealers (clerics druids etc) help out when mana and healing allows.<P>Sit back watch as lots of enemys croak and laugh.<P>Having a master looter is a good idea as well (bard as they dont need to meditate).  Then you sit down for 5 mins regain all of your mana and do the same again.<P>And thats basically it.<P>My 2 favourite spawns for this is discos and chef lot in seb.<P>Only with an ae group can you take so many mobs in such a short time.  Only in an ae group can it take 3 odd minutes just to loot all the critters you have killed in one go.  Only in an ae group can you start to relax because its safe - and theres 20 mobs left to kill.  Only in an ae group do people continue chatting and looting with a critter beating on them continuously because a single critter is not a threat to consider.<P>Have fun.  The best pull i managed of exp giving critters in seb was 26 with 4 additional (30 total but only 26 killed) mezed after combat due to late respawns and high resists.  I have heard of 35 in karnors but sentries can be killed if you sneeze on them so I don't count them :><P>Go forth and AE my breathren.  When you have been biten by the bug, tank groups of just chopping at the mob will never seem the same again.<BR></FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#f7f7f7"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Gello</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Don't forget shamans have an ae slow (Tigir's Insects) for the enormous ae pulls, if no bards are handy.<P>Charasis is also an excellent place to ae, due to the relatively low hp's and high cons of the mobs.
