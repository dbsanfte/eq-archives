<TEXTAREA NAME="ReplyMessage" ROWS=10 COLS=45 WRAP="VIRTUAL">[QUOTE]Originally posted by Morrun:
[B]Well, Sebilis and Karnor's are all well and good - the upside is that they're always full so it's easy to get a group, the downside is that they're always full...

Want to get away from it all?  Try Howling Stones! If you've got 6-12 friends you can take with you, you'll do just great here: it's very much a Bring Your Own Group dungeon, but it's almost never camped, and even if there's another group here, the separation of the four wings means you can just choose a wing they're not in.

The place is scary to start with and CR when things go wrong (and they will go wrong!) is not trivial.  Because of this, the place has one of the best XP modifiers in the game.  Loot is also pretty nice - although more oriented to melee than clerics, there is a nice +6 wis belt to be had in the North wing.  51-54 spell drops are very common, and 55+ spells drop less commonly in the East wing (which is the toughest part of the dungeon).

One tip: bring a rogue with you.  They rock in this place, not just because they can pick locks, but their sneak/hide ability makes both pulling and CR much much easier.  Oh, and make sure you have a wizard and/or druid for evac: the only way out of the zone other than gating/porting is deep in the south wing.
