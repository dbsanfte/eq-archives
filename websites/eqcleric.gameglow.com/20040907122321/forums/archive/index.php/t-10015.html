<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Rayne</div><div class="date">05-31-2002, 09:25 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Let me bitch about another issue: guild names.<br />
<br />
A LONG time ago I (along with a few RL friends) was invited to join a guild of very nice people: The Transcendents.  They were a mix of younger and older people, casual and harcode, but all nice people.  Things were fine for a year and a half, but when we migrated from EQ to AO some differences of opinion came up, and a subset of us (mainly those of us who played using Battlefield Commander, more commonly known as BCom) decided to split off and form our own guild.<br />
<br />
So, in AO and DAoC we have our own guild, named B Company.  B Company was a name coined when someone in the guild was bitching about play styles, namely the play style of those of us using BCom versus those not.  According to him, we seemed a little more coordinated (not having to type in the heat of battle helps a bit imo, but we also played together a lot and that made a difference).  So the guild thereafter referred to the subset of us that used BCom 24x7 as B Company when they were talking (or bitching) about us.  So naturally when we split.....<br />
<br />
Why the long preamble?  I'll tell you: on a server that has guilds named Deathrow, Kill, and The Powers That Be some $#*($# at Verant decided B Company &quot;doesn't fit the theme of Norrath.&quot;  WHAT!?!?!  Deathrow is acceptable but B Company isn't?!?!?  What a shmuck.  I have to run around the #$($#)$ server looking at Brittani Spears (high level player mind you, ran into &quot;her&quot; in Cazic), but I can't have a B Company tag over my head.<br />
<br />
Eventually I'll get to talk to a GM about this and possibly convince him to accept it, but this really hacks me off.  Sure, we &quot;could&quot; come up with another name, but we don't want to.  And I'll be damned if I'm going to worry about thinking up a more &quot;appropriate&quot; name when I'm on a server with Deathrow, Kill, Britanni Spears, and Lillinae HasPoopInMyPants (I may have the first name wrong, but I ran into THAT player for months around SolB).<br />
<br />
Give us our name damnit!<br />

On our sever we have The Lost Boys...hmmm can't think of any other ones with strange names. Sec let me look at my server web page.....<br />
<br />
Division Thirteen<br />
Elite Infantry<br />
Immortalis Secta<br />
Tower Of Hate<br />
Violation<br />
<br />
Those are Just some that I found intresting and as far as I know all are guilds on our sever.<br />
<br />
Also at one time...a long long time ago on Berttox there was a guild named something like Vicious Lemmings. <br />
<br />
So as you see I think your gm is on crack!<br />

She was on Bristlebane.  I know I saw some odd guildnames there, but the only one I remember was Ill Tempered Sea Bass.  Now, I get the reference, and it is mildly amusing, but I dont see how this is closer to the 'vision' than B Company.  Thats just silly. Hopefully your server gm was just having a bad day and will let you have your name. <br />

/rant on<br />
<br />
on rodcet there is/was a Divine Froggies.  I'm not sure if they are still around but they were around for a long time.  Can't think of any other odd names on RN though.<br />
<br />
But I know what you mean.<br />
<br />
My last name since about oh september 99 was Stronginthearm.<br />
<br />
Well one PoG raid, probably a little less then a year ago, the whole server crashed and the server GM came out to do resses and removed my name for being a phrase.  I would have argued on the spot, but a friend was playing my character at the time as I had to run out for a few.<br />
<br />
So I petition, argueing that as the rules state my name was in violation, but it should be covered by the grandfather policy.  I'm told by the guide that the server GM has final say on what gets grandfathered and since she is the one who removed my name I'm basically SoL.<br />
<br />
About a month later VI changes the policy to ENCOURAGE descriptive last names that can be phrases.<br />
<br />
So I petition to have it restored.  I am told that I can not have &quot;Stronginthearm&quot; back, some explanation was given that I still don't understand.  Instead we settle on &quot;Strongarm&quot;  Which actually still is in violation of VI policy since it is the last name of an NPC but oh well.<br />
<br />
VI has long pissed me off with names.  My names gets stripped when I daily see names like &quot;Iseepanties&quot;, &quot;Cutefatfat&quot;, or &quot;Lovetaeatcornbread&quot; wtf?  I'm not don't have anything against these players (except maybe Iseepanties) but my name gets stripped and theirs got by?<br />
<br />
There used to be a rogue on RN named Aiken T'steal.  (say it slowly.. aching to steal).  He got sick of the name cause it made him even less desirable in a group (this was a bit after Kunark release when very few people liked rogues in their group) and he petitioned his own name.<br />
Four times.  Finally after argueing with the 4th guide that his name was in fact in violation of naming policy the guide removed his last name.  The previous three had refused to do it saying it wasn't a voilation and they weren't supposed to remove a name that wasn't in violation.<br />
<br />
One night last summer a friend and I decided to see what names we could get through for new characters.<br />
Names that were accepted:<br />
Benitomousillini<br />
Chairmanmao<br />
Maotsetsung<br />
Josephstalin<br />
Hermangoering<br />
(none of these characters were ever actually played of course)<br />
<br />
Names that were not accepted:<br />
Mayormccheese<br />
Hamburgler<br />
<br />
We got bored after that.  Now supposedly all names are checked against various filters, if they pass they are approved by a live person (although I have a feeling it's rare that someone is approving new names)  But if someone was, they new who Mayor McCheese was but none of those others?<br />
<br />
anyway I think I'm done<br />

My wife had a orge warrior named Dorfeater. Her SK is Jeezlueez.<br />
<br />
My mage is called Yirrin Beegtrouble. My SK is Taggim Andbaggim.<br />
<br />
On our server, there is a guild called &quot;Enlightened Mystical Crusaders&quot; (yes, the people with a 3 mile long tag over their heads). Also a guild called Counter Earth, which is so far away from Norrath, it's not funny, but the name got by.<br />
<br />
On AB there is a guild called &quot;The Cast and Slay Company&quot;.<br />
<br />
The point to all this, is Verrant has not cut and dry policy for names, they make it up as they go. It all depends on what GM you get. Over 160+ days played, Dikmer Orless has been petitioned countless times. My defense...<br />
<br />
&quot;Your name generator gave me Dikmer. And I am a Dik, more or less. If you come up with a more fitting surname, then do it.&quot; <br />
<br />
So far, every GM has just laughed and left. But one day, I'm sure I'll get one with a bug in his ear that will change it.</div></div><hr />

So as you see I think your gm is on crack!<br />
<br />
<br />
Unless there's been a recent change here, server GM's don't approve guild names.  That's done by a centralized guild CS group.  So, even if you're lucky enough to be able to talk to a GM about it, the answer will probably just be email eqguilds@soe.sony.com (think that's the address).  That said, I can't see any reason B Company isn't an acceptable name.  Sounds like a mercenary company, so I'd think it was actually very in keeping with a middle ages/fantasy world.<br />
<br />
As for player names, these ARE controlled at the server level.  Basically, you will get any name you choose unless: A) There is a guide/GM online and they reject it -OR- B) The name is in the filter (because somebody has already used it and had it taken away).  If you see a name that bothers you, petition it.  It's possible that the guides on your server are idiots and didn't know that Imdapimpdaddy violated the naming policy they're supposed to enforce, but more than likely he got to level 58 with that name because nobody ever petitioned it.  Maybe I've just been lucky.  In 3 years of playing I've only petitioned 4 times and got the help/answer I was looking for on all but 1 (a request to remove my surname).<br />

One other slight rant ... I was Thortak Ironhelm long before Kunark ever came out, so when Velious was released the surname was mine first. When I returned to Norrath and restarted Thortak I was dismayed to have Ironhelm blocked by the surname command. The reason? Verant put in a NPC in Thurgadin with the surname of Ironhelm. <br />
<br />
/bonk Verant<br />
<br />
The server GM for Xegony was nice though, and allowed me to get Ironhelm back despite the NPC. I guess I have a cousin in Thurg now, although he is a ruthless businessman - no price breaks for family!<br />

<br />
Back when my Guild was to be created, our proposed name was &quot;Controled Chaos&quot; which got shot down by a GM... why did that piss us off?  What the hell was the difference between an existing Guild &quot;United Chaos&quot; and our proposed name?  &quot;Not original&quot; the GM says.. Not original because United Chaos beat us to it, or not original because you don't even know the Guildnames of your own server... /sigh<br />
<br />
Some of my favorites include:<br />
Gnomish Liberation Army (no longer)<br />
Gargles Traveling Circus (bunch o funny folk in here)<br />
<br />
Of course, names slip through the cracks all the time.  At one time I created a Ranger by the name of &quot;Tetra.&quot;  At the time, I was drawing a blank for names.. so I came up with Tetra.  Why not?  I keep bookoos of fish and tetras are favorites of mine.  Well, just to &quot;fight the man&quot;, I made his last name Hydrocannibinol.  I was well into my 30s before a GM yanked it.  But he was very impressed.. he said he had been trying to track me down for 12days just to catch me online.. I was so proud.   http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/smile.gif<br />
<br />
Tetra-Hydrocannibinol... everyone needs a good shot of THC no? heh<br />

You said you'll talk to the GM to let him accept your guildname?  Well well well, they will just go and delete all the other guild names you mentioned, and you won't get yours.  Thats how it works, tried and true ;p<br />

Most people I know have 5 - 8 characters on our server, VI anounced a year ago that the average server has 9000 active account.

My beloved cleric was named Crimsong King, for a prog rock band named King Crimson. Well, after 1 year playing regulary on the server with 100 played days or so at that moment, this slutty GM nerfed my surname. <br />
<br />
Her explanation was: the word &quot;King&quot; is a tittle, therefore you are not allowed to use it...<br />

I am past the age to watch children's cartoons willingly.  I like many of the cartoons out now like Fist of the North Star and even the Powerpuff Girls (I have a 3yr old daughter).  However, I have NEVER WATCHED POKEMON!  I picked my name after about 40 unsuccessful tries, basing it on the name of my college Fraternity - Pi Kappa Alpha.  <br />
<br />
I can't tell you how many times I've seen D@@D_01 /shout &quot;Piikaachu!!!!!&quot; It's very frustrating at times, but I've developed a thick skin.  Additionally, since I can summon BBStout, I just slam a stack and start spamming them back in Drunkenees.  I would like to change my name, but I have a good reputation and a number of friends that may not get the message...plus I've build up a lot of good will as a cleric up to this point.<br />
<br />
Additionally, I've built my mules around the name: Piikaarmor, Piikaamoose &amp; Piikaastuff, so changing the name now is a little pointless.  <br />
<br />
/rant off<br />

Good luck getting &quot;B Company&quot;, I can't see why they don't let you have it.  It doesn't go against anything I see and should be a good tag to have, very distinctive.<br />

I don't think Veeshan has had many guild named removed though, and certaintly not something as harmless as &quot;B company&quot; Maybe the guide was just afraid of mispelling it since it was a word longer then 4 letters.<br />

<br />
My friend was in Gfay waaaaay back (sometime in 99).  There is a wood elf female newbie toon in shouting &quot;stripping for plat at bank&quot;  He happens to be standing there and sure enough there are a bunch of horny kids handing the toon plat.  My friend looks at the toon's name and starts laughing hysterically and waving me a few others that were there over to his comp.  He shows us the shout, the crowd of onlookers, and then the name.  &quot;Imaman&quot;  He sends Imaman a tell, &quot;You're a guy right?&quot;  He gets a response something like &quot;Yup, it's bad enough these idiots are giving me plat, even worse that they haven't noticed my name spells &quot;I'm a man.&quot;<br />
<br />
Knew a guy that made it to level 8 as Holy****e despite that he was spamming Gfay with shouts most the time.  The GM that finally came asked him to choose a new name.  He suggested &quot;Holycrap&quot; the guide then informed him that his name had actually been petitioned for the &quot;holy&quot; part, not the &quot;****e&quot; part.  Go figure.</div></div><hr />

<br />
This issue recently developed on my server the Saryrn server over my guild. We disbanded to reform and had choosen a good name we thought would surely pass the GM protocol.We wanted to be more 2002ish in name and context. We went as far as creating our own web domain and going ahead and naming it with the name we had chosen. The name was to be Seraphim Council. When we entered the chat the name was instantly approved and all things were a go. Our charter was reviewed and we were told to change up this and that and your guild would be ready for tagging. WE WERE SO HAPPY! Until...The head GM decided we could not have that name. It was not &quot;eq-ish related&quot; enough for the game. /boggle<br />
On the Saryrn server guilds are named...<br />
Heaven and Earth &lt; hello? &gt;<br />
Dragonchow<br />
Prima VI &lt; not a clue what that name means &gt;<br />
Teds Club &lt; who the heck is Ted and why can he have his own club anyway? &gt;<br />
Little People's Revolution<br />
Beef Council &lt; lol &gt;<br />
<br />
Those are some just to name a few we have set up for approval on our server. We went as far as emailing Sony with a discrimation complaint and we were basically told what happened in the past is the past we no longer approve names with religious or god-like intention. /sigh We were astounded at not having our choosen name approved in the end. We chose the name Council of Veeshan and we wear the tag proudly.<br />
 As far as names go omg, are some GM's just not able to read?<br />
<br />
Skaleyarse Needzlotion <br />
Copin Afeel<br />
Xumter Gud<br />
Kottn Panteez<br />
Neverquest Patchalot &lt; similiar &gt;<br />
Holdin Yerstuff<br />
Imamule<br />
Meeza Muleto<br />
<br />
Many more just cant think of them atm. The same seems to go on all servers concerning names some get past the generator and others dont. Seems it just depends on the day or what GM you get. <br />

Luckily the GM decided to &quot;forget about it&quot; but warned me another GM might not.<br />
<br />
I have since read the naming policy several times. I cannot for the life of me see where it says I cannot have a phrase. It forbids phrases &quot;which produce an offensive result&quot;. It forbids &quot;names and phrases .. not found in the time and setting&quot; (that seems to say that phrases which would be found are ok).<br />
<br />
If I get another GM who objects I will ask exactly which rule my name is breaking, but I have a sinking feeling it will be like arguing with a traffic cop.<br />
<br />
It also says: Fantasy-oriented names that are easily recognized from popular existing media (e.g. Merlin, Gandalf, Belgarath, Drizzt, Tanis).<br />
<br />
Well I passed Bellgarath in GFay yesterday. I have lost count (not that I tried) of the &quot;Blibbo&quot;, &quot;Biblo&quot;, &quot;Bilbow&quot; etc I have seen. I have seen Minsc (and asked after his hampster Boo), and Hell Tanner.<br />
<br />
It seems that enforcement is slightly uneven<br />

The original naming policy stated no phrases, there was a recent update to the policies, and that one got either left out or cut out on purpose.<br />

As the mother of a halfling druid named Zarchoomi who has met many a gm on BB who think it is funny, I have seen many out there names.<br />
<br />
Dannnon Yoggurt (an Ogre)<br />
<br />
But the best one was Hyster Ectomy and RL regestered nurse who just couldn't pass up the chance to try it.<br />
<br />
And there was a guy who had a female wood elf named Goodbootie and he had a few variations to the name also and a dwarf named ribsticker ( a rogue of course.)<br />
<br />
So I also would think that B company would be fine. some ideas from here are Bravo Company or Bravado Company. If the company was what got ya bumped maybe batalion would work, after all in our military a company has approx 300 and a battalion would be about 4 compnaies. How about legion because that is closer to the &quot;era&quot; talk.<br />

His first name? Spacce. A minute or so after he dinged 20, he tells the group &quot;NO! They rejected 'Hamster' as a surname!&quot;<br />
<br />
So after having a good laugh over it, we all started giving him other suggestions. &quot;Ballz&quot; was rejected, &quot;Invaders&quot; was rejected... <br />
<br />
He ended up with the surame of &quot;Rat.&quot;<br />
<br />
Reject &quot;Spacce Hamster&quot; but accept &quot;Spacce Rat?&quot; Way to go, Verant!<br />

While we are on the subject of Ayonae Ro, let's not forget Vallis Scortor. That's latin for &quot;sluts of the vale&quot;. Of course, Vale is in this case reffering to the city of Rivervale. My female haldfling druid was a member of that guild for a long time  http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/smile.gif<br />
<br />
As for silly names, I would REALLY like to see a gnome only uberguild named Awakened Future Kaos. All members should be &quot;/anon&quot; and &quot;/afk&quot; all the time, and never answer tells - only kill one ubermob and quietly move on to the next.</div></div><hr />
