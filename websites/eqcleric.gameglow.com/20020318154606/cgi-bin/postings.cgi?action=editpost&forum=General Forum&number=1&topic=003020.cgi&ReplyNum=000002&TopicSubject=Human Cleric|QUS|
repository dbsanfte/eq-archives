<TEXTAREA NAME="EditedMessage" ROWS=10 COLS=45 WRAP="VIRTUAL">I would say High Elf with 130 Wisdom and the other 5 points put into Strength.  Small armor is far easier to come by, weighs less, and High Elves have their choice between small and medium.  They also have Infravision.  They have a far easier time having enough mana due to their high wisdom.  It is far easier to add 5 Strength than it is to add 3 Wisdom.

Humans are a bit blind.  As a Human I have run from a small tree at night thinking it was a cyclops and run into a cyclops thinking it was a small tree.  No night vision is truly painful when you have to hunt undead at night.  Humans have a maximum of 110 base Wisdom.  Humans can only wear Medium armor.  The exception to the armor is the quest armor which is the same weight as small plate.  For the rest, I don't think the extra 5 or 10 Strength is worth the extra weight you end up carrying as a Human.  I play a Human Cleric, but have a lower level High Elf that I tried out.  The High Elf was far superior.  The main thing was that the High Elf had the mana to finish the fights, not just get most of the way through them before running dry.  Unless you can twink hard, I would say go High Elf or Dwarf.  Since you don't want a Dwarf, then I would say High Elf.  Dark Elves are nice, but the Clerics have a lot of extra work to do on faction.  Halflings are nice also, but the armor for females is often off.  The feet of the Halflings can be a bit embarassing.  To me, the naked feet are a bit of an added pain when you die.  It might be untroubling to some, but death is annoying enough without that to me.  :)

Gnomes are both weak and the lowest base wisdom that you can get.  The Ultra vision might be nice though.

Primarily, skill will help, but stats will limit you.  Dwarf Clerics should have all their points put into Wisdom, and the other 5 put into Agility or Strength.  All other races should put all point into Wisdom, and the other 5 left over put into Strength.  Some people will disagree with me, but that is my very strong opinion.

It seems to me many Clerics get discouraged at about 20 and 30.  I will tell you some things to help you get through.

Clerics have a very hard time from about 19 to 23 and 29 to 33 due to having no greater spells than Druids or Shamans, and not having Spirit of the Wolf.  Once you hit 34 though, you have Superior Healing.  600 hit points for 250 mana as opposed to the 300 hit points for 150 mana of Greater Healing.  That is 1800 hit points healing for the price of 1500.  When you hit 39, you get Complete Healing.  400 mana for however much damage someone has taken.  So if you do a 1,000 point heal, you are about even with a Superior Healing.  Any damage over 1 k is all cake.  A level 45 Warrior has so many hit points, and are so hard to hit that they can live a long time getting pummeled.  Better, they get harder to kill below 35% health, where others get easier to kill below 35%.  This will let a group with a 39+ Cleric and a 40 ish Warrior kill often even if the Cleric doesn't have Clarity.  Some Clerics here have posted about healing their Warrior after multiple pulls rather than healing them and then regaing the mana for the next pull like everyone else has to.  I have done this and had more mana at the end of a fight than I started with.  Complete Healing is the thing that sets us apart from any other Class.  Not Resurrections, not four stuns, not our armor (it doesn't help that much really) and not any bonus to our Healing abilities.</TEXTAREA>
