Take away their means to give feedback, suggestions or oppinions.<P>This shows that they don't care about what the customers think.

Changing the boards to the same set-up doesn't really help any of us.  Now we don't know what is just randomly thrown away, as opposed to what is being concidered, or even brought to their attention.<P>  Either way, both methods are examples of poor customer service.<P>Just my .02<BR>Khalim Richelieu<BR>The Pantheon</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#f7f7f7"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Aquinas</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">I'm kind of sad to see them go.  I rarely read them, but I regularly read the excerpts of official posts at everlore, and I feel that the flow of information from Verant will probably be slower now.<P>That said, I can't say that I'm surprised, or that I wouldn't do the same thing in their shoes.  The official boards had become a cesspool, and frankly I can't think of any other business that would fund a forum where people (most of them, anyway) publicly rant and rave about how much they hate the company's product.<P><B>the solution was more and better response</B><P>That's what a lot of the message board regulars said, but I don't think it's true.  The only response that people there viewed as "better" was the response they wanted -- i.e., yes, we'll do what you asked.  Any other response just started a new round of flaming.<BR></FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#dedfdf"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Gryfalia</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">The forums had long ago degenerated into a<BR>morass of 'he who makes the most noise will<BR>most likely get what they want'.<P>As I read the official statement on the current state of the whineplay boards I found myself unable to disagree with their assessment of the current situation.<P>More and better responses would merely have<BR>caused people to expect more and more.

There were alot of posts which after being read made someone perhaps change the class they were about to be due to something that they read. <P>Alot of stuff posted is also false or incorrect and down plays the game to the 'passer by' and the 'person looking for info on thier class before they started one'. <P>I know I gave up my bard I played when I first started due to someone's post from a high level disgruntled bard who complained so hard it made me rethink what I was about to choose. Only to find months later that person was so wrong. I could have had more fun role playing the bard perhaps. Just one example on how those boards were bad. <P>The good naturally is the same for these boards on EQ Cleric. You find information that helps you in EQ play your cleric better. Understand the role. Get new ideas on how to handle certain situtaions. FInding a place to hunt for a particular level. Skills, spells, the list goes on. And all that is positive reinforcement which we love. And love to discuss this hobby we have with our peers.<P>OH well....regardless of what Sony has in mind we should hope EQ dosen't go as well do to stupid forums on their web site.<P>Just my 2cp.

But there WAS signal there.  Now, they will only present the issues they want to deal with and, more importantly, they know how to deal with.  <P>If a hundred people report an issue, you'll not see anything about it unless and until they can come up with a solution.
