Also, How is keal divided between the two factions of giants?  Is it Dwarf ahters to the right, dragon haters to the left?  or is it more complicated.

I believe that killing dwarves will give the most amount of kromrif faction, and killing the dragons will give the most amount of kromzek faction.  I worked up my faction by farming the dwarves for their heads.  Their heads can be turned in to the recruiter for good kromzek kromrif faction.  Then turn in dwarve heads to Captain Bvellos for kromrif kromzek and tormax faction.  It is very important to get your tormax faction to at least dubious because you have to go past King Tormax's throne to get to the quest givers.  The quest givers are on kromzek faction.  And just like COV armor quest, you need to be ally to the kromzeks to be able to run the quests.  I was able to get from kos to Tormax to amiable in one Dain kill   <IMG SRC="http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/smile.gif">  So large targets would definitely help on factions.<P><BR>p.s.

Turning in Coldain Heads to Captain Bvellos in the Kael bank is the easiest way to get your King Tormax faction up. Turning in heads give + to all 3 giant factions, - CoV, and oddly, doesn't affect Coldain at all.<P>Now, if you don't want to wreck your Coldain faction, you can just kill in Skyshrine to raise Kromzek, then have a non-KOS mage CoH you into the quest giant room to do your quests. ALSO, you STILL can turn in Coldain heads to Captain Bvellos.

I would also offer to buy them from others. Of course, when I did it, you could turn in quest items while invis. Now, you can't. So you have to get to dubious with Kremzek first.

It's the kromzek faction that is important, since they are the guys that give out the armor quests. Dubious is high enough to avoid aggro.<P>Also, to my knowledge, there are no giants on Kromrif faction that can see through invis, so if you dont get out of KOS to kromrif before you hit ally with kromzek (I think I was dubious to kromrif, ally to kromzek and indifferent to Tormax), simply invis past all the kromrif giants to get to the quest guys.<p>[This message has been edited by Dikmer (edited 02-09-2002).]</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#f7f7f7"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Ketocon</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">the -coldain wont be such a big thing<P>Going to take ALOT of heads to raise your kromiff  using bevellos</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#dedfdf"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Cland</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Well I play on a Pvp server, and my "kin" have stood by while I was being attaacked sveral times (GD/Thrug = PK haven cause faction is easy to raise) So they obviously feel no specail attactment to me because of race, and the friend of my enemy is my enemy as it goes.<P>-Cland</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#f7f7f7"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Cland</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Okie, sorry to bump this back up to the top, but I'm only a few hours of factioning away from hitting ally and want to get my stuff as soon as posible.

I am ally ta Coldain.  I do NOT want ta lower me faction with Coldain, but I do want ta do some armor quests in Kael.  Therefore...<P>1.  To do th' quests, I need Kromzek faction (and ONLY Kromzek faction) at indifferent or better, aye?</B><P>No, you need Zek, and only Zek, at at least Ally to be able to do armor quests.  If you do not have Rif you may need to be CoH'd into the quest area (I am not 100% sure, was not kos to Rif when I did it)<P><B>2.  Th' trainer in Kael at th' EW zoneline accepts coldain heads an' kobold paws, but his faction hits are a) less than Capt. Bvellos' and b) have a negative Coldain hit.  The trainer is on Kromrif faction.<P>3.  Once yer non-KoS, ye can use th' "invis trick" ta turn in heads ta Trainer</B><P>The recruiter gives better Rif hits than Bvellos, you can do it as soon as you are dubious to him, you dont need the invis trick, just to be non-kos.  You are correct on your other assumptions.<P><B>3.  Capt. Bvellos gives +Kromzek +Kromrif +Tormax -CoV faction hits and his faction hits fer 'zek and 'rif are higher than Trainer.  Capt. Bvellos is on Kromzek faction.</B><P>As said before, pretty sure his Rif hits are lower than recruiter.<P><B>4.  Ye need dubious or better faction ta Kromzek ta "use" Capt. Bvellos, so ye don't need th' invis trick, jest non-KoS status with him.</B><P>Correct<P><B>5.  Skyshrine gives +Kromzek +Kromrif -CoV.</B><P>No.  Skyshrine and WW killing gets you +Kromzek -CoV -Yelinak, it doesnt *not* get you any Rif faction, for that you have to kill dwarves (Rif faction is not required for armor quests, but you may need CoH if you are KoS to them as stated before)<P><B>SO...with these facts in mind, then it is lookin' like me course o' action is ta kill dragon-types in SkyShrine an' WesternWastes till I get dubious ta Kromzek, then use 4 kobold paws at a time with Capt. Bvellos ta raise ta friendly levels.  Ta jest do th' armor quests, I kin jest kill in SS or WW, but ta raise Kromrif an' Kromzek, I need to kill kobolds.<P>Am I correct?</B><P>You will have a very hard time getting non-kos to Rif w/o killing dwarves, it will take you ~30-40 sets of paws to get ally to Zek from non-kos (or just 30-40 heads, you get one faction hit per head).  For Rif and Tormax on the other hand it will take you over 200 sets of paws, or over 200 heads to get to non-kos from max kos.<P></FONT></TD></TR></TABLE>
