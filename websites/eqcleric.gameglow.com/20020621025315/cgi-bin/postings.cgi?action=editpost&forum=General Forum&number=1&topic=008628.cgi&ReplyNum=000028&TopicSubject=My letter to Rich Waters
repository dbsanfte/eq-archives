<TEXTAREA NAME="EditedMessage" ROWS=10 COLS=45 WRAP="VIRTUAL">Cali, at no point was I 'whining' about any class.  An issue is an issue.  The use of a denigrating term to invalidate someone's argument is little more than ad hominem.

Lind, I've already looked over the 'AE availablily' post, and it does nothing to prove your point.  AE groups are not comparable to druid soloing.

Cali, any list of class abilities is going to be subjective until you get right down  to damage, how fast the damage is dealt, how well it is avoided and how efficiently it is mitigated, so any comparison such as yours (Or mine) will be entirely subjective.  You can't make a list of spells, line them up against each other and say 'this is comparable to this'.  Stun isn't comparable to snare, in my mind. I'd sacrifice every stun spell in my arsenal to have snare.  You can't compare our nukes to druid nukes, just as druids can't compare their overal healing capability to a cleric.

To address Lind's quotes directly:

[b]Snare is mostly a convience, even for kiting. Most places you can simply path a mob over terrain and have ample time to cast. This is how druids kill unsnarable mobs with their 6 second cast nukes without getting hit.[/b]

You're describing a pathing exploit, and an exception to the rule. Without snare most mobs will close the gap between the themselves and the druid before the druid can finish the cast-time.  While it may be possible to use a fast casting nuke between the time the mob gets into casting range and when it hits, you're really stretching the truth to say that snare is merely a convenience.

[b]Speed increases" I have no idea what you're talking about.[/b]

Spirit of the Wolf.  Spirit of the Eagle.  You know, those spells that, when combined with snare, allow the druid to outpace the mob and give them the seconds they need to cast a nuke on a mob before it can get into melee range.  Clerics don't get that.

[b] Regen is comperable to MoK, I haven't tested it but regen is probably worse. That leaves 6 for each class. Not that I'd really agree with the remaining list either.[/b]

Regrowth of the Grove is a constant 15 (Or 18.  I get some argument in the matter) points of regen per tick.  MoK is 15 points per main-hand attack per round of melee combat and has to be reapplied on every single mob, with the subsequent mana cost (or you can rely on a 10-second cast-time BP).  It isn't even REMOTELY comparable.

The unfortunate fact is that you're wrong on every count, Lind, but you have succeeded in doing the one thing I didn't want - you've turned the thread into another typical bitchfest between the druid and cleric classes.

The original intent of my letter was to draw attention to our class during the rebalancing -- basically to say 'While you're greasing the squeaky wheel over there, don't forget that the same argument applies to our situation'.  I don't have a problem with any class being made more capable and balanced within the game, but I don't want our own issues to be overlooked in the process.
