First off, followers of Brell Serillis are not KOS with any of the Golems, Earth Elementals, or Fiends. However if a ratman warrior or any type of ghost erudite see's you exploring around, all the previously non-kos creatures will gang up to hurt you. Also killing any of the elementals will lower your faction with the elementals fiends and golems. I believe the group you lose faction with is MinionsofTheUnderfoot. In addition several items which are seemingly for quests have been found there, with the names suggesting a relation to Brell Serillis. However, I have heard no information regarding these quests as of yet.<br />
Anyone have any information regarding these quests?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brodder</div><div class="date">06-29-2000, 05:56 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I've got some of these items so far...<br />
<br />
 Granite pebble (looks like an unstackable piece of onyx)<br />
 Living Heart of a minion of Brell (looks like an odd red heart)<br />
 Holy soil Brell of Underfoot (looks like a lil white pouch of faerie dust)<br />
<br />
 Me is thinking that there is indeed a quest to go with these items...post patch tomorrow I'll be a checking out the Temple of Underfoot closely. There is a pair of trainers that don't talk at all...usually each trainer has a message of somesort.<br />
 I'm a thinking if they do put one in look to akanon on the underfoot(Brell) side and then in Kaladim.<br />
 Heck Add Soil of Underfoot and some holy Ale and ye might have the mixings for a nice pet or a mudheartpie.<br />
 (SHRUG) time will tell and the other message boards aren't either yet.<br />

They seem to be under this delusion that we [evil races] indiscriminately killed anything and everything in our paths pre-Kunark and now we should pay for it. When, in fact, Dwarves, Gnomes and FP guards were camped by just as many (if not MORE) good races as evil ones!<br />
<br />
WHY aren't followers of Brell KOS in the Hole? Is he the God worshipped by beings in the zone, does he rule over it somehow? Following that standard and being a Dark Elf, you would think I could walk freely about Castle Mistmoore unscathed, BZZZT! You also might think that choosing Innoruuk as my Deity would have granted me a boon or partial immunity in the Plane of Hate, BZZZT! As a matter of fact, Good races were the only ones that started with positive faction in an evil-hostile zone [Upper Guk] now they have another to add to the list. Evil races also, now, have to endure the BS of stupid faction hits for the Overthere outpost.<br />
<br />
I don't even want to hazard a guess at what's next, I'm disgusted!<br />

<br />
*hrmmmm* guess that would be fitting with a DE follower of Innoruk.<br />
<br />
Sorry, couldn't resist the poke.<br />
<br />
Maybe something with the hole has to be partially due to the fact that things underground are considered to be partial to the creation of Brell - since Dwarves were created as an underground race, that could be a possible explanation as to why some of the things are non KOS to dwarves.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">bellsong</div><div class="date">06-29-2000, 04:23 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Vendrix....how about such a solution?<br />
<br />
Good races who kill good things ( the wood elf druid who camps dorfs due to lack of faction).......just tie most good races factions together.......kill a dwarf, and you piss off most shorties? kill a druid at the ring, and most elvs dislike you?<br />
<br />
<br />
or * shudder* empower a roleplay aspect and give an EXP ding to  people who play with you after you do factionbad things...ie ., as a high elf, i get a exp ding for playing with an inky, or even a woody who has killed GOOD npcs.....<br />
<br />
the other thing, and I am not disagreeing ( i think both alignments should have faction issues, not just evils......yes it should be hard for an inky to play on kunark, but it should also be harder for a good race to  do anything after killing good guards or npc's) is that mistmoore DOES NOT worship inny , he tries to become his own god.....so no one has good faction in his castle, dont feel bad</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Barnif</div><div class="date">06-29-2000, 04:25 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Vendrix,<br />
<br />
I agree with alot of your post about how people of good races are killing more then the evil races.  But, you included a bit of in accuracy when you mentioned Dark Elfs being able to run through mistmoore.<br />
<br />
Its my understanding that Mayong Mistmoore is an outcast with this own dark elf kind.  His main goal is global domination and he answers to noone other then to himself.  So knowing that you have to relize he doesn't even like his own kind (besides his followers).  There is a history in Norrath that alot of people don't read up on and relize.  I recommend you research your points and make sure they are false to begin with before posting.<br />
<br />
As for people killing their own kind or even of those of good races.  Well that will happen people take advantage of a system and run with it.  They do however become KOS with enough offenses to that NPC's race.  Now the reason I think alot of evil people don't hunt/kill those of good is because they are trying to gain goodfaction to gain access to other cities.  Again this is another way to take advantage of the system.<br />
<br />
As for the The Hole being non-KOS to all Brell followers well that could make sense.  Brell is the creator of many underworld creatures.  This includes, dwarfs, gnomes, and even goblins to name the main ones.  Now since these golems and other creatures are created by brell its really easy to understand why they don't have an instant aggression towards those that follow the same god as they do.  I have always thought of Brell as a middle man.  He is neither good nor evil.  He seems to be a very neutral god and is accepting of all races.  <br />
<br />
Now you might come back at me...well why are dark elfs KOS to innorruk (sp?).  Well he is a different kind of god.  He is naturally the god of hate and he hates all even his own creatures I am sure.  He only uses his creatures to do his bidding and he doesn't care what happens to them.  Now if you were the god of hate and found out that some of your underlings gained access to your realm without your permission would you be happy to see them?  I highly doubt it.<br />
<br />
I guess what I am trying to get at is that religion is a very real thing in Norrath.  Alot, of people don't relize it until they see things like this effecting them.  So, please before spewing off how this is unfair or that is not right think about how it fits in norrath history.<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Badina</div><div class="date">06-29-2000, 04:51 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Two comments:<br />
<br />
1: Being non-kos to certain creatures as a Brell worshiper does NOT grant free license to wander about the whole place. AND as noted if any agro occurs on you.. even those previous non-KOS creatures will attack. There for this non-KOS to *some* creatures is NOT a free-tour card. It helps ..probably really helps in corpse recoveries Id say sometimes.<br />
<br />
2: The faction issues of some dwarves for instance NOT having faction and therefore good races killing them to farm experience.. I think this is wrong, I think Verant should have fixed it. Your right.. good races should NOT be able to kill good races indiscriminately. That is exactly what faction is for.  <br />
<br />
<br />
Does either of those make up for the current backstab of Venril Sathir faction in Kunark? I dont think so. I do not see how the Evil Outpost has already an entrenched faction with some of the deepest dungeons in Kunark. This was definitely and simply unfair to evil races..<br />

You bring up some good points, but you are also relying heavily on the concept that I should be doing some extracurricular reading to be able to follow the in-game story line. I didn’t read the manual (which is why all my points went into Wisdom and not split with Strength like the manual suggests for Clerics) so I'm not familiar with the background stories of Castle Mistmoore, Solusek A or Upper Guk. You, much like Verant, are relying on information not available to influence player actions and decisions [read: The Vision(tm)].<br />
<br />
I shouldn’t have to read every EQ board on the net in order to find a reference to a GM event explaining exactly why Mayong Mistmoore is hell bent on world domination. If there is information that affects player actions, then it should be readily available in the game. I should be able to &quot;hail&quot; a Sage or Storyteller in Neriak and ask about Mistmoore. He should tell me that it's not a safe haven, but the realm of a chaotic madman and thus unsafe for me to venture within.<br />
<br />
I should also be able to &quot;hail&quot; someone, ANYONE, in the Overthere and ask them why everything under the sun wants to kill me. Yet, if I manage to survive and slay my attacker I can only look forward to a negative faction hit with the outpost. That equates to you taking a vacation to, let's say, Mexico. You hang out there for a while, chat with the locals and have a pretty good time. One day you decide to wander off the resort and into the jungle, to do some exploration. At some point you are attacked by a few men who obviously want nothing more than to kill you. You manage to slay them with your trusty Swiss Army knife just like your Boy Scout Troupe leader taught you. You arrive back at the resort to discover that, not only does everyone outside want you dead... now everyone inside does too. There's obviously something going on, but no one ever bothered to let you in on it and there's no way for you to find out. [read: The Vision(tm)]. Now you're screwed and there isn't a thing you can do about it - sorry.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Barnif</div><div class="date">06-30-2000, 12:03 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok you bring up a good argument so here is my counter argument.<br />
<br />
You bring everyday life into this discussion when you really shouldn't.  This is a game, a Role Playing game to be more precise.  In this Role Playing game you have to assume some general knowledge of the world around you to get around it safely.  This means learning to read documentation out of game before venturing forth inside it.  There is only one site you need to goto to read up on Norrath history and that is at www.everquest.com. (http://www.everquest.com.)   There you'll find all you need to know history wise about EQ.  The manual that came with the game also has some history but, not as extensive as the website.<br />
<br />
You bring an example to point with Overthere and faction with the rest of kunark.  Ok so your in your little evil town chumming it up with other evil people.  Well you feel adventurous and go out and seek something to do evil upon.  Well lo and behold something comes up and is kindof pissed at ya too.  You engage, you win!!  But, whats this...oh no!! some of your chummy friends in town like these folks.  But, you know what thats OK...you only killed that type of creature once and just get a slap on the hand.  What you fail to relize is that you don't become insta KOS to a town from one kill.  You see a message indicating faction hit/gain and from there make a decision to either continue your slaughter or to lay off these NPC's.  What it sounded like to me was that you are saying that you get a insta KOS flag for doing on kill when in EQ reality it takes a few before you get to that status.  Of course there are exception to these rules like for example if you kill lucan in Freeport your insta KOS to all the guards there.  But, thats only because he has such a high status and thus when killed is very much looked down upon by the guards there.<br />
<br />
You also bring up a point that NPC's should just stand there spewing out information conviently for you.  Like an NPC in Nek offering information about Mistmoore.  How do you know there isn't one?  Have you gone to NPC's and asked about Mayong Mistmoore?  Most would say they havn't.  I have seen for a fact NPC's giving information about others if asked correctly.  They are out there you just need to find them.  Not everything should be standing there nice and neat waiting for you right where you want it.<br />
<br />
What I am getting at here is people tend to not involve themselfs with the history of norrath at all and just go out and kill.  Nothing wrong with that but, then again they wonder why the heck I am KOS to these people or why am I not well liked to those.  Well, without doing your research you'll just think its just Verant &quot;Vision&quot;.  But, the reality is there is a true historical reason why things are the way they are in norrath.<br />

As a Dark Elf, I've currently kept my faction with the outpost OK, but I'm considering trashing it. Why? Most of my guild goes to the &quot;forbidden&quot; dungeons. They have offered to help me with supplies, ports, etc, if I do become KoS there.<br />
<br />
It's not that big of a deal though, there are plenty of place to go that are not tied to VS faction in Kunark.<br />

The deeper you get the more of a mix of mobs you seem to get. When you reach the part which seems to be a lost city (with shops, banks etc), there are plenty of ratmen and erudite ghosts to render your corpse pulling skills useless. One thing i have noticed is there seems to be some named ghosts (erudite) who don't drop anything when you kill them! Perhaps this is somehow related to quests.</div></div><hr />
