Even though I was not KoS to dragons, and everything I conned in WW was Apprehensive to me... my group started yelling at me to hold still till I got picked up, that there were some massive, KoS to all badies out there.

However, we just invised and ran it, DN was fairly close.

The hardest part was sirens grotto.  We never had a 57 WIZ/DRU  to evac us across... so we made a run for it... and that worked fine, although the warrior almost bit it.

I have to say though, for someone who can't invis at will (me!), being non-KOS to Claws of Veeshan is a blessing!  I can walk Cobalt Scar with not many worries and as I said, a lot in WW was not KoS to me.   Plus other benifits like Woushi not killing me on ports to WL.[/B][/QUOTE]

The xp was great, not much loot droped but what did droped was very nice.  What I have noticed is that the raid can be going very well and in 5 sec it can get very very bad (i.e. total wipe out) which means very long CR.  All in all i like the place, but one very small mistake can mean a very long CR.<P>Obadia<BR>56 Templar<BR>~Forbidden Prophecy~<BR>Tunare</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#dedfdf"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Boanerges</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">There are some beetle traps (if you've ever seen The Mummy it's kinda like that) where you get swarmed by lost of death beetle sized bugs that his for upwards of 75 and con blue at 58. If you have some casters with AEs, tho, you can plow right through them.<P>Phase spiders are the zone entrance enhabitants. They can shadow step you as their proc which means you could find yourself some distance away from the group. They rarely drop the coveted <A HREF="http://eq.gameznet.com/equipment/phasespidercarapace.html" TARGET=_blank>Phase Spider Carapace</A> and sometimes Phase Spider Blood (1 charge Improved Invis). The spiders give no faction.<P>Nearby are the dragon constructs. No faction here either.<P>Further in, you will find the Chelkari. They are ratmen and are, more or less, the frogloks of DN (like in Seb). They are tied to Zlandicar's faction. Gems drops are normal down here but Flawless Diamonds seem to be more common here (a guild raid last week netted 3 down here).<P>CR isn't too much of a pain really. Not too many things see invis (some Chelkari do) so unless you died really deep in, you can drag corpses out with invis or a rogue. The bulk of the problem in CR will be getting your tanks there if you have to necro out. The closest zone to bind in is Skyshrine and that's 3 zones away.<P>If you ever get the time, I highly recommend exploring this zone. It's seldom occupied and it is one of the coolest zones in EQ.

They don't shadow step - they phase whoever has aggro away from the fight - sux0rs when your CH is about done on the warrior and he gets ported out of range when the spell finaly fires.  Adds on spiders means that multiple party members will be out of range of your best heals - Remedy really gets a workout here.<P>Another thing to remember - Root and Snare say they work (a phase spider is entwined in grasping roots) but the mobs ignore the effect and continue walking at speed.<P>Bard sense/disarm traps works great on the really useless/nasty traps - beetle traps cant be disarmed, but when you know where they are - just load Upheaval and Stun Command - then blast away.  I guess that wizzie and 'chanter help out a bit too   <IMG SRC="http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/wink.gif"><P>In the middle of the bones you see scattered around are other traps.

We have been killing the Chetari - just because we know how to get to 2 camps of them, and taking faction hits with them and Zlandicar.

As someone already pointed out, the spiders will phase group members out of heal range and sometimes in to adds. If you are going to hunt the spiders in hopes of a PSC bring a paly along to chain stun so nobody gets phased. The spiders take exception to being stunned so it's better to have a paly stun than cleric or chanter. Being close to the zone also gives you a false sense of security. A "hey, if we get in trouble, we can always zone" kind of feeling. Not a good idea. First, there are several wandering WW mobs that make their way around the zone in to DN. I've zoned out several times only to be smacked around and killed by a wandering crag or drake. Also, if you set off a dragon construct trap and can't take him out for whatever reason, he stays camped at the zone in until someone kills him. These see invis btw. The biggest problem we had at the zone in was when 2 of our tanks got summoned into a tomb with 2 constructs. That was quite an interesting CR to say the least  <IMG SRC="http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/smile.gif"><P>Another thing to be aware of....Jaled' Dar very much dislikes illusions and any form of AE spell near his tomb including ae stun. He'll call out the offenders name like any boss mob and DT them instantly.<P>We usually hunt the ratmen near the tunnel entrance with 1-2 groups. I have yet to take a single group crawling through there but with the right lvl's I think it would be a blast. A large number of the ratmen are 55-57/58 so you really need a heavy duty tank that can take a good beating. These rats can enrage, they run, gate, summon etc.<P>The best part about this place are the beetle traps. Load up Upheaval, have the other casters load up their ae's and blast away.

It was kinda fun... especially when the enchanter got yonder'd away... "I dont know where I am"... doh  <IMG SRC="http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/smile.gif"><P>Then we sprung a Dragon Construct trap for kicks.  <IMG SRC="http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/smile.gif">  But the trap was bugged people tell me and we got 2 dragon constructs... and a spider add.  But the enchanter (You rock Aanthan) got the spider under control, and the amazing Somnus off tank one construct... all good.  Was a "fun" fight actually to see these two huge arse mobs tearing away at things  <IMG SRC="http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/smile.gif"><P>We then moved to the C Rats tunnel.   I gotta say... Dragon Necropolis is really high on my list of "cool" looking zones now.  Kael to me is exciting as you walk into these huge giant size buildings... but it does not compare to the building ruins in DN.... I love the atompshere.  Of course, once you get to the C Rats tunnel, you may as well be camping the Hole or something, nothing too exciting there  <IMG SRC="http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/smile.gif"><P>We didn't go deep in the C Rats tunnel... we camped in a corner where there was a beetle trap which people triggered randomly to keep things interesting  <IMG SRC="http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/smile.gif">  We pulled rats, ratmen and bats... and they werent THAT much trouble.   We had one gater which resulted in a stream of mobs for a few minutes, but we handled it.  Of 17 people for 3 hours and travel to DN... we had about 8 total deaths... and I think that's pretty fantastic given most of us had not been there before (and 3 of those deaths were the enchanter... silly boy).<P>Given we only had 3 hours because so many people were late  to start, I think we did well in the XP... each group came away +xp (we all felt, that the xp there was amazing... take an uber 6 person group there and cleanup).  The phat lewts were:<P>Translocate Group WIZ spell<BR>Shroud of Pain SK  spell<BR>Light Velium Bow (30 40 bow)<BR>Velium Axe (30 37 2HS)<BR>Flayed Parabolea (sp?) Leggings, which I got as an upgrade to my Sol Ro quest legs (The SK did not want them, and no necros, otherwise yeah, they'd get first crack at 6 int high ac legs... but its an ac increase for me... and 20 mana over my old legs)<P>Symbols is where this raid really hurt.  I have standing rules that we use Marzin on my raids now, go for maximum protection.  The spiders drop (or at least for us) nothing for cash, as well as the constructs.  The rats had good cash, and 8 million velium weapons...but the little raid came up short by about 150pp.... true true, thats not a TON, but still... wish the cash was better.  OF course if we had more time in the rats, the cash would have been fine... I think the average coin drop was about 6-7pp a kill from rats.<P>Once again, thank you for the information on DN.... thank you for sharing your experiences, I know I had a great time there and would go back in an instant.</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#dedfdf"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Mahtan Honorshield</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">If you want to get fuerther inside fast, the best way to clear stuff near Jaled`Dar is to have a necro do their skeleton nuke...the spider is turned into a skeleton and DT'ed by Jaled. :-)</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#f7f7f7"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Sanctume</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">charming spiders results in their DT also near Jaled.<P>Sanctume the Vicar <A HREF="http://www.everquester.com" TARGET=_blank>www.everquester.com</A> </FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#dedfdf"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Beckett</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">How hard is it to get to DN if you have bad faction with dragons?</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#f7f7f7"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Darianne</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><BR>Even though I was not KoS to dragons, and everything I conned in WW was Apprehensive to me... my group started yelling at me to hold still till I got picked up, that there were some massive, KoS to all badies out there.<P>However, we just invised and ran it, DN was fairly close.<P>The hardest part was sirens grotto.
