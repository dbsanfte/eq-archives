I wouldn't suggest without one of the two, I may be crazy but im not stupid :><P>Firstly buff up - although marzin aint needed.  The downhill run is pretty easy and i have managed to do it with as little as 300 damage.  Sv magic might be an idea as there are a few mobs that harm touch along the way.<P>The uphill run is alot more challenging (specially as it was my first run in that direction and theres one bit ya have to double back onyaself to get up some steps).<P>Anyhow the basic tactics are to run between every giant as far from their agro as possible, if you are of sufficient level you can avoid agro entirely on greens.<P>Jumping helps alot, once managed to run to naggys lair past 2 ldc's just by vaulting over their heads and they never agro'd.<P>Anyhow just thought id share this - as its alot of fun and must be tried :><P>It's a shame that they removed (I think) the north wall chicken run in fear - doing that solo always got the blood pumping heh</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#f7f7f7"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Darianne</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><BR>Not too long ago, I complained that clerics did not have levitate... well... that's true, we have DA/DB... need to enter Howling Stones?

I merely stepped aside and let him go, and continued my WALK through the zone. I ended up walking back to EW zone to res him, since he didn't (quite) make it.<P>Yes, I am a DWARF cleric and I am NON-KOS to giants. In fact, I am an Ally to Storm Giants (Kromzek). Those are the giants that give the Kael Templar armor quests. I am indifferent to Frost Giants (Kromriff) and Dubious to King Tormax and his court. I can walk right up to King Tormax, tip my hat (he insults me, but doesn't attack) and walk past to talk to the giants that give the armor quests.<P>And I did it WITHOUT killing my kin, or ruining my Coldain faction (Amiable to Coldain currently).<P>All it took, was about 50-60 Coldain Heads.<P>You get the heads 2 ways. Buy them (I was paying 5-10pp for them, but the price may have gone up, now that some people are figuring out what they are worth). Or go to the mines in Thurgadin and kill "a lesser tar goo". These nifty lil buggers drop Coldain Heads, Braided Coldain Beard, and other stuff that normally drops of the dwarves. <P>I would clear the mines of anything that moved, kill 3 to 6 goo's per sweep, and net 1 or 2 heads. I also saved the Crystaline Spider Silk to use to make Thurgadin Gate potions.<P>Even if you wanna have good Thurgadin faction, you don't have to be KOS in Kael. I did it, so can you. </FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#f7f7f7"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Phys</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Dikmer,<P>Thanks - a most interesting post.  I have always planned to remain friends with the Coldain - I like the roleplay aspect and I am Dwarven - so killing Coldain goes against the grain but being able to make my way through the Kael Gauntlet would be nice as a stroll ....<P>Maybe I am missing something here - exactly how do you hand in the Coldain Heads if (as I am a dwarven cleric) I am KOS to the giants to begin with.  I haven't spent much time in Velious - lvl 49 at present - and done most of my last 10 or so levels in Kunark.<P>Thanks<BR>your info will be much appreciated  <IMG SRC="http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/smile.gif"><P>Phys Ician<BR>Stumpy Healer of Bristlebane.</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#dedfdf"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Dikmer</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">What I did was use an invis potion (you DO carry invis potions, don't you?), go to the bank and hand in 8 or 12 heads while invis.

I got left behind on an EVAC out of Howling Stones one time with my Paladin, managed to camp out and had to be rescued (we were just leaving and people wanted to go to Emerald Jungle).  The next day I took an hour and did the Thurgadin Gate Potion Quest.<P>First step, get your Pottery skill to about 125 or so (mine is at 128).  The best place to do this is Thurgadin since you have a wheel, pottery vendor, and water source in the same city.  This will take you about an hour to do and cost less than 100pp.  To raise skill, just make things on the wheel.  Do NOT fire the stuff.  It’s too expensive to fire the stuff so just create the pottery item on the wheel and destroy it.  Just print out a list of skill caps for pottery and you can figure out what to make to advance your skill to 125.<P>After you have the skill, go to the Crystal Caverns.  You need to hunt the Ry`Gorr Miners up at the top for Bricks of Velium (non stacked) and Small Pieces of Velium (stackable).  Just find a good place to set up camp and keep clearing them.  In my experience, the stackable velium is more rare.  You need 1 Brick and 2 Pieces per Potion.  After you get all of that, drop to the very bottom of the pit (it’s about a 600 point of damage fall or so) WITH invis.  Run through the caverns and stop off at Dorf town and bank all that velium (it’s heavy).  Continue through Dorf town and start killing spiders.  It takes 3 stackable silks to make 1 potion but it’s fairly common.  The worst part about the CC part of the Gate Potions is that CC is getting farmed more and more these days for quest junk, potion junk, and tradeskill junk.  Go early on a weekend for best results.<P>Now that you have all the ingredients, go back to Thurgadin.  Place the following in the Pottery Wheel.  1 Brick of Velium, 2 Glass Shards (bought at a pottery vendor), 3 Crystalline Silks.  Do NOT stack anything on the wheel.  Hit combine and you should get an unfired vial.  Take the Vial and combine it with a High Quality Firing Sheet in the Kiln.  Now go find Frundle.  She is the shopkeeper of the potion shop across from the Paladin guild and ask her “What Velium Vapors”  She will give you a container.  Put the Fired Vial and the 2 small pieces of Velium into the container (unstacked) and hit combine.  You should now have a Thurgadin Gate Potion.  It’s 10 seconds casting time and it ports you to the bridge in Thurgadin.<P><P>------------------<BR>Quistil Angelwatch<BR>Cleric of 45 Seasons in the service to the Great Mother Tunare<BR>Islington Angelwatch (Semi Retired)<BR>Paladin of 53 Seasons in the glorious service to Erollisi Marr<BR>Phoenix Crusaders</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#dedfdf"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Dikmer</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Quick note, the Thurgadin potion is NO DROP and LORE.
