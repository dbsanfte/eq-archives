<TEXTAREA NAME="EditedMessage" ROWS=10 COLS=45 WRAP="VIRTUAL">Lind, your tone isn't very productive, and your points are incredibly weak.

I've been to the Gray.  Trust me, what you just described is cleric suicide more than half the time.

Your arguments haven't even remained consistent.  Now you're bitching because casters don't maintain the DPS of melees.  This is part of the entire rebalancing issue that very few of us argue with.

You can toss out crap like 'blindness' and our second line of AE's (A joke) all you like, but you're comparing apples to oranges, my friend.  I don't believe you've actually played a level 60 cleric with end-game gear by reading the scenarios you've described. 


[b]In other words the party required no healing what so ever.[/b]

The party required as much healing as it would have with a cleric.  As a druid, you HAVE no primary role.  That's the choice you made when you took the class, however you CAN heal effectively in groups.  You CAN nuke effectively.  You CAN solo like a mad machine.  Do you want the best of everything?

[b]Once you know how many HPs those mobs actually have and how little damage you ended up doing with your nukes compared to what the meleers were doing, well[/b]

And this is different from the rest of the classes how?  Nuking is what finishes off mobs before they can gate or heal themselves.  It's not sustained damage, it's fast damage, and yes, it's a problem that is generic to all casters, but at least druids are nearly the equal to wizards in that respect.

[b]Okay, so... are you specialized in evocation? I mean, if druids can heal then you sure as heck don't need to be specialized in alteration right, you DO outheal druids by an order of magnitude after all, so being specilized in alteration is utter and total overkill. Not specilized in evocation? Well what can I say?[/b]

Well, you could make some sense, for one, and cut out the 'wha wha' crap that has nothing productive to add to a discussion.  I am a specialist.  The game has class-interdependancy and I choose to play a class that focuses on one part of the game.  What does my choosing alteration have to do with the effectiveness of a generalist class such as a druid?  This only becomes an issue when a generalist class wants to step into the specialist role and be as productive as the specialist in that role.  When that happens, there becomes no reason for the specialist to have played the game.

[b]Look plate class whiner, get a KEI like everyone else go to The Grey grab 20 gimp mobs and upheaval them dead for 3 or 4 alt blue a shot and quit your bitchin.[/b]

Again, denigrating terms such as 'whiner' don't add anything meaningful to your argument, and simply make you look like a child.  As for the scenario you propose, it's laughable.  I challenge you to find ANY cleric who grabs up 20 mobs in the gray and winds up with anything but his own corpse to retrieve.

In short, I think you're full of crap.  I believe that most people on this board realize that you're full of crap.  So, perhaps you should stop posting your crap and go level up a specialist class, since you're so obviously dissatisfied with your druid.  Hell, that's why my alt is a necro.
