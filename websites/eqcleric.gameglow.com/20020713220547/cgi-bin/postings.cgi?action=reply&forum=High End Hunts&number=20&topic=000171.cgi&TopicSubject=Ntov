Dispite this we did get her to 50%, so are confident that given another shot we will own her.<P>Anyhow on sunday we found ourselves with nothing to do.  Given that ntov is something we wish to learn (and I don't know about you but my guild needs to try things - fail a few times so we learn what to do, what not to do).  We wanted to go into ntov and practice killing the yard trash.<P>There is a rotation for ntov on tribunal which we are not a part of, and that rotation had given ntov out to another guild (who is est/pst based and hence very worried that a euro raiding guild becomes capable of killing in ntov).  When we were preping for coh to the hatchlings area we were trained by that guild.  Long story short GM's appeared and ordered the other guild out of the zone and gave them their second official warning.<P>So my guild had free reign to enter ntov - which we took advantage of to learn its ways.<P>Anyhow after 3 wipe outs, we had learned that flurry drakes need to be respected and that dagners the destroyer likes to run up the wall if you try and position him so that his ae doesn't hit the casters (we wiped out once because of this, and killed him on the second try, it didn't really count because he seems to velks regen rate.  I am confident though with the knowledge we had gained we could do him again on first attempt).  We also killed the naggy clone on first attempt, but wiped out just before doing a lady dragon near koi because we accidentally trained koi to camp before we were ready - and the back spawns which all suddenly poped prevented a meaningful cr.<P>As you can imagine with the loss of certain mobs - the guilds in the rotation are a bit upset with my guild for having the nerve to attempt something.<P>So I was wondering what other guilds feel about going into ntov without killing aary.  I believe my guild is clearly capable of killing aary, but just not have an opportunity to prove this.  I personelly do not see why any other guilds try and tell any other guild what they can and can not do(As long as they are not in the zone with a raid before us - we will always respect a raid capable guild, though we once had 19 people claiming zlandicar, which we did ignore, they were cring at the time cos I think van wiped them out.)<P>Also how did other guilds find when they entered that part of teh zone for the first time?  We are getting called useless because we have died whilst trying to learn the zone.  For example yesterday we went after the triplets, and when we preped for the blackstar mob, we accidentally pulled the one that ae's for 1250 which we were really not prepared to take (and I can imagine we will die lots of times learning effective strategies).<P>Do other guilds typically do things on their first attempt, or are they like mine, they learn through trial and error.  Unafraid to try and die - knowing that knowledge gained is the most important part of the first attempt.</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#f7f7f7"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Islington</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">INTERESTING post.<P>On Erollisi Marr, North ToV was left alone for a solid month as the two highest guilds ignored it as they focused on Seru and Ssra.  My Guild, Affliction, decided to go for it.  After being demolished by Aary the first time, we went back and killed him flawlessly.  We then enjoyed a solid month "lock" on NToV as other guilds tried to get past Aary but failed.  Today, there are 5 Guilds and 1 Alliance that have killed Aary.  Of these, only 3 guilds and that 1 Alliance have a continued interest in the zone (well as long as Vulak isn't spawning properly).<P>Anyway though, in my opinion, Aaryonar is the lock.  If you cannot kill Aary, you have no business entering into the hub area of NToV.  It's very obvious that Aary is one of the hardest dragons here and he is a good "test" for Guilds to prove that they're ready.  Once after Aary, most of the fights are pretty easy.  The only two notable exceptions are Lady Nev who I despise with a fiery passion that would extinguish the light of a thousand suns, and Lordy Vyemm whom I'm relatively indifferent to.  Even a guild that "thinks" they can kill Aary still needs to do it simply to prove that they can.  That way there is no doubt in anyone's mind that you have "earned" your way into the zone.<P>A lot of Guilds consider it VERY bad form to ride on another guild's coattails and enter NToV  while Aary is down and other dragons are up in the guild who killed Aary intends to return in a timely manner (obviously killing Aary on Monday and not planning on coming back until Sunday is a bit much).  Aary is one of the most intense fights in the game and ANY guild can still have problems with him if things go wrong.  He's a HUGE drain of time and resources and by skipping past him, that invalidates a lot of other peoples work.<P>Anyway, learning NToV is a LOT of fun.  The first couple of times everyone had the "OH NEAT!" attitude and we were VERY cautios about things.  I have personally sat in the hall near PoM for a solid 3 or 4 hours twiddling my thumbs waiting as the Monks worked out strats to pull the Trips.  That part sucked but it had to be done.  The only way to really learn the zone is to just do it.  Spoilers will only take you so far in this zone.  And to address your problem with getting Zlexak on the pull instead of Cekenar, our guild has a simple strat.  The Monks pull and HOPE to get Cek or Sev but we all EXPECT Zlexak.  We prepare for Zlexak and if we get one of the others, we adjust accordingly.  Zlex can single handidly wipe out a raid force in less than 2 minutes if given the chance.  I know...  I was the only Cleric to camp out on one particular Zlex wipe.<P>Well there you go, that's my thoughts and experiences with NToV.<P>------------------<BR><A HREF="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=6975" TARGET=_blank>Quistil Angelwatch</A><BR>High Priest in the service to the Great Mother Tunare<P>Islington Angelwatch <BR>Cavalier of 53 Seasons in the glorious service to Erollisi Marr</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#dedfdf"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Jubal</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">You really should kill Aary before you do the rest of NToV.<P>I'm in the position of being in a guild that has been the only one interested in and capable of NToV for a month or so. We had an acknowledged agreement with one of those guilds that they must kill Aary before we ceded any claim to share the other dragons. They agreed - after all, they didn't want other guilds to enter NToV after they did kill Aary, even though they hadn't yet.<P>Another guild thought they were NToV capable but claimed they hadn't had a chance to prove it. One day, this third guild killed Feshlak after we'd cleared the rest of NToV. He hadn't popped yet when we left a few hours earlier.<P>After a very hostile argument between the two guilds, we agreed not to kill Aary for a day in order for the other guilds to prove themselves. Both failed their first try, one with what must have been a humiliating 11-hour zergfest that required at least 2 corpse summonnings for 65-80 people. The other had a second try the next morning, due to their timezone advantage (damn euros!) and won.<P>We then stayed out of NToV while they explored, adhering to our agreement. I assume some sort of rotation between the two guilds will be worked out. As for the third guild, they've not done much of anything since, so we've yet to see whether they will shape up into a class act. In the meantime, we've learned to do NToV in one sweep, leaving minimum opportunity for parasites.</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#f7f7f7"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Aldur</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">How do you learn to kill a mob if its not left up though?  If arry was left up and we couldn't get passed it then, fair enough we shouldn't be there.  But if its constantly killed so there is no opportunity to practice against it, to prove you can do it, should you be penalised for this?<P>How is it different from say a guild doing fear, dispite not being able to kill CT? Other than the simple linearity of it?  Is it because it does prevent people going into ntov (unlike CT who can be pulled around) a matter that proves you have a right to be in the zone?<P>If CT has been killed, do guilds worry about other people coming in killing things in a forum that is much easier?  What about ST?  From reports its much easier once the sleeper has been released (only have experience of it post release) - are they not riding off the back of someone else?<P>And where does it say that you have to be capable to go and try something?  My guild was the second (only just beaten) guild to kill king tormax on my server.  We tried again and again to get the tactic down.  Just because we couldn't beat him does not mean that we had no right to make the attempt?</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#dedfdf"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Gello</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">On Karana there's 6 guilds/alliances in a NToV rotation.  Aaryonar must be killed first, which makes the new random spawn times annoying.  He's harder than the rest aside from RoVulak, but from what you listed I'm sure your guild could kill him given time to work out the tactics.<P>What appears to be missing there is a way for guilds to slip into the rotation.  On Karana, you can get into the NToV rotation by killing either Cazic and Lendiniara or by killing Yelinak.  This avoids guilds colliding on patch day and generally works out.  Except that Cazic, Lendi and Yelinak are on rotation too.  So if you're a very fast growing guild it can take time to slip into the bigger rotations.  But overall it seems to work well.</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#f7f7f7"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Islington</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial"> <BLOCKQUOTE><font size="1" face="Verdana, Arial">quote:</font><HR>How do you learn to kill a mob if its not left up though?

Basically the same thing was happening, to get into NToV you had to kill Aary but was rarely up.  Basically the only thing I can suggest is to know his spawn time and plan around it.  Before they started to mess around with spawn times, Aary would spawn almost immediately after a server reset and he would respawn in 7 days, almost exactly to the minute when killed.  Essentially on EMarr, if you could kill Aary you would be added into the Rotation but you wouldn't really be given free chances at him.  It was best to just watch the spawn and move when you had a shot at him.<P> <BLOCKQUOTE><font size="1" face="Verdana, Arial">quote:</font><HR>How is it different from say a guild doing fear, dispite not being able to kill CT?

Is it because it does prevent people going into ntov (unlike CT who can be pulled around) a matter that proves you have a right to be in the zone?<HR></BLOCKQUOTE> The difference lies in the fact that Aary is the toughest dragon in NToV but is the first engaged.  Cazic Thule is the toughest creature in Fear but the last engaged. This comparison is apples and oranges, it's really not valid at all.  It's commonly accepted that Aary was designed by Verant to be so powerful to keep as many people out of NToV for as long as possible.  My Guild spent months getting ready for him.  Countless hours spent in HoT armor farming, killing every ST dragon for more Primal/Priceless, killing every Vindi/Statue/Tormax for weapons, armor and gear etc.  Aary requires that kind of work and dedication.  Fear is an old Plane.  Most people clear it for Planar Armor and Epic/Golem drops.  Only the high end guilds are concerned with Cazic for his drops and the other guilds pull around him.  The same goes for other zones you mentioned like ST, apples and oranges.  It is impossible to do that with Aary.  You can't just pull around him to get to the better dragons.<P>On EMarr what happened was this.  Magister and Midnight Fury both moved on from NToV sicne Vulak was gone and they were worried about Luclin.  My guild, Affliction, decided to take advantage of this and we killed Aary on our second attempt.  We than spent a solid month in NToV clearing it 4 times straight.  Other Guilds tried to get past Aary when he was up, but failed.  On our 4th or 5th clearing (I can't remember which) we learned the hard way to not leave dragons up if we could help it.  We left Jorlleag and Lady Nev up and another guild went in and killed them.  There was a huge argument between us and we eventually agreed to rotate NToV provided that they could kill Aaryonar.  We even gave them the opportunity to do so and they eventually got him.  Later 1 other guild managed to kill Aary along with an Alliance.  Rotation was expanded but eventually was thrown out the window.  However, it's generally accepted that if your guild is the on to kill Aary, the zone is yours until a reset.  MOST guilds won't try to go past.<P>As I said, killing Aary is completely about dedication and perfection.  He is NOT an easy fight ever.  If things go the slightest bit wrong, you're dead.  Because of the time/energy/effort it takes to kill Aary is the reason that it's considered weak to go past him if you can't kill him.  The other dragons in the zone are nothing compared to him by and large.<P>Best advice I can offer you is to just watch for Aary, learn his spawn patterns, and jump him as soon as you see him up.  On most servers that validates your claim to NToV.<P>------------------<BR><A HREF="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=6975" TARGET=_blank>Quistil Angelwatch</A><BR>High Priest in the service to the Great Mother Tunare<P>Islington Angelwatch <BR>Cavalier of 53 Seasons in the glorious service to Erollisi Marr</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#dedfdf"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Aldur</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">quistil if it was 'not your problem' that we didn't have an opportuinity to kill aary - why is there a problem if a guild fails to kill it?<P>And aary is only the lock on Ntov so to speak if he is up.  If not then the linearity of the zone is removed greatly.<P>You can't claim that having an opportunity to kill aary is our problem and then moaning when a guild takes advantage of you removing that opportunity.  <P>No guild can demand that you leave aary up for them, you are absolute right there - however if you kill aary you also relienquish any claims of stopping other guilds from doing the zone, once you leave that zone.<P>You say that it is possible to pull round CT, effectively neutrilising it.  But it is also possible with Ntov to either go in before it has spawned or go in when it is dead.  Why is pulling round something acceptable, but attempting when something is dead not?<P>Recently my guild attempted tunare for the very first time, we spent hours clearing (which is required from what we had heard) in order to make the attempt.  After 3 attempts, we took the knowledge we had learnt and left, knowing we would be back another day to retry.<P>After that another guild came in and killed tunare.  They had every right to do what they did - we had relienquished rights to the zone as soon as we had left (though they were a bit cheeky on their web page saying they cleared the plane).  Why is skiping one set of content different from skipping another?<P>We know that everything in pog is trivial (though the first time we attempted tunares guards we were in for a shock), is that what makes skipping the content different? The zone was definitely arranged (by the fact that she calls stuff to her) so that it had to be cleared first.<P>The fact that we have not done something in no way suggests that you are not capable.  My guild has never killed the dain due to faction, but I have absolute confidence that should we choose to do so, he would die.<P>The fact that we can not prove it because others will not let us, yet require that proof in order to not whinge about us attempting other things is rather conflicting at best.<P>And yes we do plan on making aary our top priority.  But the very fact that any other guild has the nerve to try and prevent my guild from doing anything in the game is what is most shocking.</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#f7f7f7"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Islington</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Aldur, I honestly don't know how to take your posts.  Basically on EMarr it works like this.  If you kill Aary, you are considered NToV capable and people respect that.  You get added to the Rotation.  If you can not or have not killed Aary, you are not factored in to things.  You do NOT get added into the Rotation until you have killed Aary.  It's as simple as that.<P>Basically when I say "it's not our problem" what I'm saying is this.  The guilds who kill Aary aren't going to give any favors to those who can't.  If you want added to the Rotation, you find Aary up and you kill him.  It's not our problem when you do this.  We will NOT train you or attempt to keep you out of NToV.  As long as you beat other Guilds to ToV FAIRLY, you will be respected there and can spend as long as you want (within reason) attempting to kill Aary.  After 3 days and 15 failures, things might be different but that hasn't come up.  On the other side though, an Aary capable guild isn't going to hold your hand with him.  We won't be giving you strats, we won't help you clear to him and we won't help you kill him.  That is YOUR job, not ours to prove that you are capable of getting into NToV.  This means it's up to you to figure out when he spawns, get to ToV first, and figure out how to kill him.<P>Aary IS the lock on ToV.  Aary spawns on a server reset almost immediately and no more than an hour afterwards.  This is to prevent people from getting past him quick.  After he is killed, he spawns almost exactly 7 days later (almost to the minute).  Basically, it's VERY rare on EMarr for people to kill Aary and NOT intend to do a full clearing in a, relatively, timely manner.  YES it does happen that on occassion a guild skips the occassional dragon (Vyemm, Jorl, Nev and the Trips are big candidates to be left up from time to time) but most guilds that start NToV by killing Aary fully intend to finish it with a complete clearing.<P>The reason people get angry when people kill other dragons and not Aary is because of how tough he is.  Using your PoG example, the plane is NOT the hard part.  Tunare is.  With NToV it's the exact opposite and that's why we're comparing apples to oranges.  Aary IS the hard part, NToV isn't.  <P>There really isn't a good way I can explain it.  It's just an ettiquette thing to not ride in on the coattails of another guild's hard work.  I really don't have any good answeres for you either.  I DO see your point and I understand you wanting more content and things to kill in a VERY crowded high end game.  NToV provides a LOT of that content since so many top end mobs and loot is concentrated in that one zone.  However, our view is that it comes down to simple courtesy.  Aary is TOUGH and he can take hours to kill severely reducing the time left for that day.  NToV for many guilds is not something that is done in a single day but done over a period of 2, 3,4 or even 5 days.  If another guild goes in on that 3rd day to kill dragons when we intend to finish up, yeah we're going to be pissed since we spent day 1 and 2 clearing Aary, named Flurries and other things for you.<P>The whole thing is VERY hard to explain and I hope that someone who is better with words than I am attempts to do so.  You're dealing with a lot of abstract and intangible things here.  You're also dealing with circumstances that change from week to week as different guilds clear NToV in different ways.  In Affliction, we start by killing Aary and we TRY and clear the zone as fast as possible now.  Basically we want to get our loot and get out.  We also do this in an effort to prevent other guilds from coming in behind us.  Other guild's do it differently and I CAN see how it is frustrating as Guild A to watch Guild B kill Aary on Tuesday and than leave the other NToV Dragons alive with the intent on coming back on Saturday to finish them off.  Personally, I find that disrespectful myself and I really can NOT blame Guild A from wanting to go in on Thursday to snag a few.<P>Anyway, that's just more of MY views on it.  Simply put, NToV is a VERY sore subject.  Personally I can't stand the politics that revolve around this single zone myself but I'm also a huge advocate of courtesy and decency.  In NToV's case, politcs and courtesy are often in direct confrontation with each other...<P>------------------<BR><A HREF="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=6975" TARGET=_blank>Quistil Angelwatch</A><BR>High Priest in the service to the Great Mother Tunare<P>Islington Angelwatch <BR>Cavalier of 53 Seasons in the glorious service to Erollisi Marr</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#dedfdf"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Cland</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">That just seems kinda...low, I mean I guess if they had been gone for several days, but from what I gather in your post they were merely breaking for the night.<P>Personally if something like this hapened to my guild it would result in a major war (I'm on RZ <shrug> yall blue server people may be calmer) cause basicly you would be looked on as stealing our raid.  <P>Maybe I'm just spoiled because RZ only has 2 maybe 3 guilds who can do Ntov, but in my opinion yall didn't earn the right to kill the mobs you did, and really don't have any sympathy for you getting trained, its just hard for me to.<P>It seems to me that your server has an accepted way of doing things, an acceptable time to steal the camp (if you could kill aary before the other guild could) but your guild couldn't do that, and couldn't get in on that rotation so you just said to hell with them.  And I don't know hardly anything about the guilds on the trib, so I'm not taking sides here, this is strictly un biased opinion.<P>BUT to actully answer your post about if your wrothless for learning the zone on your own and all that.  No, my guild has cleared NToV twice now, except for the triplets which we still can't pull, thats part of the game, learning how to do it on your own.<P>Anyway, enough from me, gonna go do something constructive.<P>Cland Carbuncle<BR>Lvl 60 High Priest, Rallos Zek<BR>-Wudan-<P>P.S. Just out of curiousity why did you post all that back story about how you took Ntov away ( ya ya to me thats what you did ) if you just wanted to know if other guilds learned the zones themselves.  I mean, if thats all you wanted to know then why go looking for flames?</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#f7f7f7"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Aldur</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Im not looking for flames cland, this is a flame free board.  Its a situation that occured, and I can't say I particularly trust members on the tribunal board to be impartial, so I wondered what people who wouldn't flame and opinions are worth listening to are.<P>Its been a long time since I have held an opinion so strongly where reasoned arguement can not change my point of view, I alway find the harder you dig yourself in, the worse off you look.  <P>It is interesting what the rest of you think, and will affect what I do in the future, even if I think its a little bit hypocritical to allow a taking of one mob, and not another purely based on difficulty.<P>islington, your theory only works for a guild trying to get into the rotation which we were not - tribunal has been ffa for a very long time, then 2 guilds became ntov capable and they decided to rotate on that only, then we are in the situation now where 7 guilds, only 5 of which are interested and only 3 of which are in a rotation - first rule of a rotation is, is everyone in it? if not then it will fail.  2 guilds on the server have already openly stated that if something is up and they want it - they will kill it, and the aussie guild of the server (as far as I know, there are rumours they may have joined the rotation) is not in the rotation and will kill anything there whenever they find it.<P>We are not looking to get into the rotation, we simply want to learn our way around the zone, that was the reason we were there in the first place (I think the reason we killed the names was that we got delibrately trained by the other guild).  <P>There is no apprioriate analagy for trying to prevent another guild from doing something but lets look at something fairly close which VI allows.<P>There are 5 different key mobs for ST.  However the difficulty of those key mobs fluctuates quite wildly I think.  Zlandicar for instance can be done with low numbers - zero tactics in 30 mins.  The keeper is fairly easy - but a pain in the arse to get to if giant aligned.  Klandicar isn't too bad, neiterh is yelinek and for me my guild has real trouble to the point of not even bothering to kill sontalek.  We have done it but its rarely worth our effort.<P>If you wanted to go to ST, you have to kill these dragons, but one guild could only kill zlandicar, whilst another could only kill sont.  The difference between effort between the two is staggering yet its something the game allows. <P>On tribunal there are 7 guilds pretty much capable of doing most stuff.  Tunare, Aow and some luclin stuff is off bounds to all but 2 of em, but on the whole competition is fierce.  Its been this way for a long time now, and people have got used to running around quickly killing things or not getting them.  The idea that stuff is up to kill in a place you can get to, but you get questioned moraly about killing it to me is unfair.  I really hope that when my guild kills aary we do not suddenly become of the opinion that you require to kill it in order to kill anything else in ntov.<P>For me its not about the loot but about having something to do in the game, and making the next natural step in the game which is rather linear in its mob progression level.<P>Thank you for your comments though, whilst I don't necessarily agree with them all, they have opened my eyes to non flame opinions, which was kinda the point of this thread :></FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#dedfdf"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Iceblink1003</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Im in Aldur's guild (trial atm) and although i wasnt there, i know (from having RL friends in some of the other guilds that are on the rotation) its a general rule of thumb that to get into NToV you have to kill Aary.  Im sure we could do it, and im sure we can do the rest of NToV also, but the fact remains, its genrally accepted that Aary is the mob to beat, and otherwise you leave the rest alone.  Similar to how if someone is camping something, you dont go steal their pulls because that just isnt nice.  Heading into ToV like that just pissed off the guilds that are in the rotation, so next time Aary is up, we go kill her and shut em up, but until then, no NToV for us.<P>------------------<BR>&lt;54 Cleric&gt; Iceblink</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#f7f7f7"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Nemean</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">If the mob's up - kill it.  Simple as that.  If guild X kills Aary, but leaves dragons up in main NToV area, best of luck to the other guilds that come in and get lewtz.<P>The whole 'You can't go to X until you kill Y' is bollocks imho.  If Verant had wanted NToV only open to guilds that can kill Aary - they would have put her on a 4 hour timer or something like that.  They haven't however, so once she's down, everyone on the server had a week to raid NToV.  And good on em - everyone loves NToV loot.<P>And re: learning the zone - everyone dies heaps when they're learning a new tough zone.  Especially one like NToV - where even the yard trash can wipe a raid if you're not paying attention.<P>So don't worry about em - go keel stuff.  </FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#dedfdf"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Litermin</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">It depends on the server I would say.. if its FFA then its FFA. If there are guilds that rotate the zone and have rules about joining their schedule, then I guess it depends on how well you want to get along with them. If you dont care then there's nothing people can do to stop you. Its not all that hard to lock a guild out of the wing tho if the rotation guilds decide they want to do that.<P>------------------<BR>Litermin LaPlace<BR>High Priest of Mischief<BR>Affliction, E.
