<TEXTAREA NAME="EditedMessage" ROWS=10 COLS=45 WRAP="VIRTUAL">Found this at Everlore...

Its interesting. Coming from a non uber, once a month( if lucky) plane running guild.. We have fun by ourselves, we dont need a 80 man guild where people know other people because they are there to help you get items. We are there for each other and have a blast playing EQ.What do you guys think about this?

I’ve played EverQuest for over two years now. I’ve beta tested. I’ve role-played. I’ve adventured. I’ve leveled, and I’ve gone for the epics. Although the game still holds me closely to it’s bosom after all of this time, I have found that perhaps players have lost a sense of morality and honor. Is this the “phat lewt” fever? Perhaps. Perhaps not. 
Players today are driven by one hope, and that is to “beat” EverQuest. Why beat it? There is no end-goal other than perhaps reaching level 60 and owning the best equipment available to one’s class and/or race. These players are so driven by their lust for “lewt” that they have become monsters to their former friends and guilds. They rush to battles one after the other… Gorenaire in the Dreadlands… Trakanon in Old Sebilis… and of course, the famed “hot spot” Ragefire in Nagafen’s Lair… all for loot. Morality stops here. Care for those who have spent hours attempting to kill a specific mob has been laid to waste by larger guilds with loot hungry minds that rush in at the last second to “steal” something that smaller guilds worked very hard to achieve. GMs? What are those? Are they creatures I create for my children’s fairy tales? They know not of the situations that occur behind their backs. 

Oh, it is true that many larger guilds are quite noble, though there are some, unnamed by me, that strive to crush those that get in their way. These guilds, once friends of many, grew, changed, but allowed their morals and honor to deteriorate as they progressed in the game. They no longer desire to be friendly and respectable of the trials and torture that smaller, lower-level guilds have to go through to make it to the top of the server food chain; they only desire their loot. 

Take the epic quests for example. They are meant to be epic in every way, shape, and form. Players unite to gather the items for these wonderful weapons, though the end always seems to trip them. Guilds fight over something as trivial as Ragefire, for example. A mob, which spawns every 0 to 90 hours (variable spawn time), is the last part needed to complete the cleric epic quest. Every 90 hours, GMs have to deal with fights between as many as four guilds over this bundle of 1’s and 0’s in a virtual world. Is this epic? Is this what Verant really wants us to go through when attempting to complete our quests? Petty arguments ensue between guilds over these items… over loot. Is there honor left in EverQuest? Maybe… I hope and dream that it remains. 

There are some, who allow themselves to be walked all over, so they don’t end up stooping to the record low of many guilds. This isn’t meant to be an attack upon those who run from uber spawn to uber spawn hoping for their lovely “phat lewtz;” rather, a question to the general public regarding honor and morality left in the game today. How do we see ourselves in the game today? How will we be tomorrow? Do we see ourselves as being the best of the best and allowed to trample over those who are not as “uber?” Or are we honorable beings? These things and more I am curious to hear about. I want to know, WHAT drives players to drop all respect, morality, and integrity, to obtain one piece of loot. Moreover, what of honor?
