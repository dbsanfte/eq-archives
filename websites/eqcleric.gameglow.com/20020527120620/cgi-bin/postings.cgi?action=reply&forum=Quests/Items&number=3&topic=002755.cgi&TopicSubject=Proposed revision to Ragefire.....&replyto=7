But, I have a very good friend that is one.  I have been helping her camp RF when I can.  Some things about the encounter have really rubbed em the wrong way.  The spawn is set up in such a way to promote player conflict.  And there is a lot of conflict.  I have been chastized for mearly being in the zone with my friend....saying I am a KSer bla bla blah.  Mind you RF wasn't even up.  <P>This quest needs to be revised.  I understand VI's point of view in that they want the epics entering the world at a certain rate and no more.  So, here is what I would propose.  Human RF is always up in SF.  A cleric would hand him the item from Sol B RF.  At this point one of two things would happen.  One, RF would hand back the item from Sol B RF with an additional item.  The additional item would be handed back to RF to spawn the final encounter.  or two, he would say something to the effect of "I am sorry you are not ready.  Come back at the next moon (30 EQ days or 36 hours) and I will tell you see if you are ready".  The quest would be a random number generated reward.  This would mean some clerics would get the first time and others not for a month or two.  But what this would do is it would resolve the conflict.  Yes, it would still be a pain but clerics could log in each day and check it before raiding or whatever.  <P>My heart goes out to all those clerics doing the currently excruciating camp.<P>Please post any feedback you have on this idea.</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#f7f7f7"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Thecklos</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Now this one is quite funny, it reminds me of going to Disneyland a couple of years ago for the first time after the speedpass thing was installed/instituted.  So we'd get our pass saying your ragefire ticket is good from x to y 5-10-30+ days from now.  Here is the problem with this.  <P>There is a ENORMOUS flood of people on all servers with pearls (even swirling pearls) who haven't gotten ragefire.  To get a valid estimate on ETA til YOUR ragefire for any given server (ie when your ticket would work.)  With the sheer number of people at this step and their insistence of entering world about 1 every 5-6 days you could get something that said Your ragefire will be up in 290 days.  Oh joy I now know I can't get my ragefire before almost a year passes anyway.  No matter what I do am willing to do how patient I am etc....<P>The sad part is no matter where you move the bottleneck to without rewriting the entire quest you will just end up with a pile of people there camping and fighting over it, and if they move the bottleneck there will be a huge flood of cleric epics for a couple of weeks or more.  <P>How much change would a server go through if all of a sudden the bottleneck was moved and that server had now another 300 epic clerics on it?<P>I think Rayne hit it on the head.  They need to make another item have effect revivscience no matter it's weight/etc.  The real reason most people want this item has more to do with its utility to a guild than with its utility to the cleric.  <P>You don't see guilds pushing their necros to finish the necro epic...but you see clerics and enchanters pushed to finish theirs (especially clerics.)  Without a cleric epic high level raids are either not doable (because of spawn times) or just plain no fun because of the length of time it takes to get a raid going again.<P>Basically having res sticks in your guild changes the raid game from unfun to fun or at least from unfun to tolerable.<P>I wouldn't mind them changing the bottleneck myself.  I personally think the flood of epics would be interesting because it won't really change high end guild raiding to much (what high end raid guild doesnt have 4+ epic clerics on any given raid already.)  What it would do is change the game immensely for those marginal guilds that can just barely raid now.<P>Thecklos<BR></FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#dedfdf"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Belhaven</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">The only problem with another item having Revivisence is - they almost certainly won't make it unlimited charges. And even if they DID make it 20-25 charges (not likely) one good wipeout in a big raid would use it up.<P>The cleric epic is simply the single best Downtime reducer in the game - it not only gets the raid GOING again, it returns the "lost" hours of play to the person that died.  Even if they stripped all the other stats off of this item and just left the rez effect on it...  you'd still have this level of competition for the item.</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#f7f7f7"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Talx</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><BR>Nothing is going to make this quest any less painful unless they decide that they are willing to let more any 1.5 clerics get their epic in any given week.<P>I believe that they're reluctance is due to the effect.  Let's get real here.  If Ragefire turned into a 2 or 3 days spawn, getting your cleric epic would be really damn easy for a Level 51 cleric.  Almost every 51+ cleric would be able to cast the 56 Rez.  If the cleric epic effect was the 49 rez, would Verant care if most clerics had an epic?  Probably not.<P>Personally, I always liked the idea of extending the quest.  Several classes have intermediate weapons, why not clerics...  Remove the Ragefire bottleneck, but make the reward for getting to that stage of the quest an intermediate weapon.  Maybe the epic with the 49 rez...<P>Then extend the quest so that you can upgrade your epic to the 56 rez.  For example, add 4 mobs each on a 3 to 4 day timer that you need to kill.  Or make the cleric collect the heart of each Kunark Dragon.  Or maybe, once you reach level 56, you can just turn in your epic for an upgraded epic.<P>Or maybe you change the quest so that the Sol Ragefire turns KOS when you hand in your pearl and requires 2 or 3 groups to kill.  Killing him results in the Heart...  Turning in the heart results in the gimped epic.  If you want to upgrade your epic, camp the Skyfire Ragefire.<P>This all begs the question though.  If your guild had a 56+ cleric who had a 49 Rez clicker, would you 56 rez the raid or 49 click the raid?   <IMG SRC="http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/smile.gif"></FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#dedfdf"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Alilinkie</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Well alas im one of them unfortunate clerics who has done all but Skyfire Rage, I am sick of checking Skyfire only to find 15 clerics already caming Rage  <IMG SRC="http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/frown.gif"><P>I am level 59 and I strongly think this BS camp should be changed, it was bad enough before when you had to camp RF in SolB, but at least you could just kill the firegiants every 7 hours just to keep you awake.<P>What they have done with this epic now is add a camp (24 hours) in SolB for Ragefire merchant and then add a BS camp in Skyfire this has made the cleric epic (for people with a RL) almost impossable, if I didnt have a family I could sit in SF for a month just waiting my turn, but I do have a family with children to think of so as far as my cleric epic goes I dont see myself getting the camp EVER  <IMG SRC="http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/frown.gif"><P>I completly agree with most in that they should change the epic, my change would be to make the SF rage not KoS hand him the Swirling pearl (he then hands it back) and the dragon form then spawns.  Perhaps put the hand in mob on a 24 to 36 hour spawn and not a 5 hour spawn like the Druid final epic mob Faydedar.  At least you can gather your forces and hopefully reduce the bottleneck.<P>Just my 2 cents<P>Alilinkie <BR>59 Templar <BR>Rodcet Nife</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#f7f7f7"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Belhaven</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">hmm - here's another idea....<P>Change the current result from the quest to be a sceptre with unlimited charges of Resurrection (49 - 90%) and ->no  other stats<- and make the quest doable once a day.  <P>Extend the quest, adding additional steps as necessary to get the original item, and set the new one on the 1 or 2 a week cycle.  <P>I wonder how many folks would get the first bit and never go on to get the REAL piece.<p>[This message has been edited by Belhaven (edited 04-05-2002).]</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#dedfdf"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Sabal</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">I completely agree with Alilinkie ... if you have to work, or a family, its impossible to get RF in Skyfire. Even if you see him pop, it will result in a race which of the 10 guilds camping it is there first. This has nothing do to anymore with fairness or skill - its plainly annoying. Everquest is a game, a game should be fun, but a daylong permacamp with a 90% chance of losing the spawn is far from any fun. <BR>In many other epics the last mob is triggered and has to be killed by 2 or 3 groups ... and there is no complaining about flooding the game with certain epics. But maybe Verant takes some perverse fun in frustrating certain player classes, and I am almost sure they wont change it anytime soon.<BR>I for my part have given up on Ragefire ...<P>Sabal Khane<BR>60 High Priestess<BR>Antonius Bayle<BR></FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#f7f7f7"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Vorath Mythrender</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Hell on Povar some of the clerics with the stick had it from 50. <BR>Easy enough to fix, make him a triggered spawn in skyfire by a 55+ cleric, have a dialogue...are you a templar, yes i am, and go from there..what youre not a templar, you cant trigger him...well go level up  <IMG SRC="http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/smile.gif"></FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#dedfdf"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Velisaris</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">In my opinion, all semblance of this actually being a "quest" has been blown to hell.  I come here and read the woes and problems other clerics have in camping Ragefire...and it makes my stomach turn.  I don't have 7 days of my life to waste, sitting online in a game 24 hours a day, hoping and praying that you can assemble a force large enough BEFORE those other dozen or so clerics camping him can assemble THEIR forces.<P>I'm only level 54 and I, like every cleric out there, would love to be able to obtain my epic at some point.  But the fact remains, that unless you build your real life around the game, and not vice versa, it's just not something obtainable.  I hate it and I think it stinks that most people won't consider you a "real" cleric unless you have your epic.  I haven't even started my epic "quest" for this reason...it's just something I'll never be able to do.<P>I'd really love to see someone at Verant level up a cleric from scratch, and attempt to complete this quest, without taking any time off from work/family/RL commitments to do it.  Maybe they might rethink a few things at that point.<P>Just my 2cp.</FONT></TD></TR></TABLE>
