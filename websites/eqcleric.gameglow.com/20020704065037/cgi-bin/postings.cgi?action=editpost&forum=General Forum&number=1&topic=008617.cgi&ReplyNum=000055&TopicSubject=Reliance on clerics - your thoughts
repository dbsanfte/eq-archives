<TEXTAREA NAME="EditedMessage" ROWS=10 COLS=45 WRAP="VIRTUAL">[b]Reliance on clerics...a very old topic once again revived because druids still seem to be trying to have it all.[/b]
 
  I'd be interested to know what you base this on.
 
[b]Clerics are required for many high end raid mobs, and so are other classes.  Clerics can't do it all alone.  But the question of reliance on clerics seems to imply that there aren't enough clerics, as if druids must step in to fill some sort of "cleric gap". In fact, guilds usually have a lot of clerics in their membership.[/b]
 
  Yes as you say and as was shown and stated several times clerics are far and away the most numerous class in end game guilds.  Some see this as a problem, others see it as an opportunity to use that second account and second computer.  But again, where do you get the notion of druids trying to step in?
 
[b]There is NO lack of clerics in guilds or in the game, so druids are not needed to step in to fill some sort of healing void.  That really should be the end of the subject, and we clerics can all relax and let the druids go steal from some other class for a change.[/b]
 
  Steal from some other class?
 
[b]Perhaps the druids are suggesting that it would be better to promote diversity in raids and such by giving druids powerful heals.  But it's another false premise.[/b]
 
  I've read druid boards for months.  Druids want a better heal than the level 34 superior heal clerics get, they want it for groups primarly, but also for raids.  Most don't want CH but some see it as a necessary evil because, for the very reason a guild/raid needs so many clerics, nothing short of CH will do.
 
  Whenever a druid who does want the class to be indespensible to raids suggests a "solution" it pretty much invariably goes, sorry clerics you aren't the center of the universe, in the directions of shamans with a big debuff and has nothing to do with clerics at all.
 
[b]Diversity in raids is very great, and druids are welcome on raids for many reasons, including powerful resist buffs and nukes.  In fact, raids generally turn no one away, because they are all about numbers.  So why do SOME druids find themselves excluded from raids? Is it because they "bring nothing to the raid" or because of their personal reputations?[/b]
 
  Our guild hasn't keyed any druids for ST.  No DB.  No CH.  No point.  All other caster classes are or are keyable because they either feed mana to the cleric/wizard, or they have powerful buffs and debuffs.  Frankly if you key a druid you either have too much time on your hands or you're nuts.  Think about it for a minute and you'll see I'm right, there is absolutly no reason to spend the time to key a druid but every other priest/caster you want at least 1 of.
 
[b]Druids who are not welcomed may assume that if they have Complete Heal or some near equivalent they MUST be allowed on raids no matter what, so they scheme to take the cleric class's defining spell away by implying that it is bad to 1) have to rely too much on clerics, and 2) that no one class should have some kind of "stranglehold" on healing, a job that most druids and shaman, by the way, do not want to be stuck with because it is too boring. [/b]
 
  Again, I've read druid boards for a while and they don't take this us vs. them attitude a few cleric board posters take.  They're not scheming to screw clerics as much as you might want to think.  If anything druids couldn't give a flying... well, you're awefully concerned about druids but druids are MUCH more interested in things like torpor (more efficient than CE) and slow.  And as for class defining spell, okay, druids DO want that too... resurection and not CH as you think.  Having to get two staves of forbidden rites is frankly a pain in the butt, and needing a cleric or paladin in every group (in addition to an enchanter to compensate for ineffiecient spells) makes it tough for druids to group.  =)
 
  Unfortunatly most druids are still deluded they're healers instead of nukers, a role often forced on them because even with as many clerics as we've seen guilds have, it's NEVER enough.  In fact most magicians are nothing more than cleric substitutes, churning out rods to power CH and powering their own rod production by eating SHAMAN mana in the form of torpor...  again putting shamans at the top of the pyramid, heh.   ;)
