Didn't I say that in my post?  Did you go back and read the support posts?  I am not sure if this is the Dikmer I come to know and love..  Sorry hun.. I think I missed the point.. But if you leave.. Aren't you Proving the Nay Sayer's right?  Don't give them the satisfaction!!!

Enjoy your "imfamouscy" Cause I would..   :)

YOU have to give permission for others to make you feel inferior..  I hope you realize what that means.. cause It took me more then 5 minutes to remember the saying. LOL

BUt it's true.. If you let them intimidate you, then it's your own fault.  And I would have to come over there and kick your butt for doing it.

My only ther charaters are all under 10 with the sole exception of a 14th level paladin. I look at things from the aspect of a cleric. I am a cleric. I always have been (in D&D, in UO, in whatever). I thought the people here were similar and would agree with me for the most part. I was wrong.<P>I don't think I am greedy. I turn down loot, I give things away, I rarely get anything in return, I quest/camp/buy my own gear, I don't trouble people with stuff I need, and I never win lottos (well, 2 times, once on a RMB, once for that god damn Bladestopper last June).<P>I did something I thought was a good thing, that helped me out emmensly, and got nailed for it. This is the second time in my EQ life this has happened, and I will not let it happen again. In the future, if anything happens that works in my favor, I will keep it to myself and not post it here. Posting it here simply opens it up for scorn, ridicule and nasty comments. I'm done. I may post a few times when people ask questions (like how to use a manastone), but anything that requires an opinion or can lead to possible debate, I will not post on.<P>It's just not worth it.</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#f7f7f7"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Aladain</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">I guess I dont know what post your referring to, but if folks here beat you down in a way to make you want to leave, thats pretty weak.<P>Aladain</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#dedfdf"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Gamer65</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Hello, I don't blame you for not wanting to post on the boards.

You then explained everything to the group when you got the second.<P>The comments I saw that were shots at you came from folks who are in one of two situations. IMHO<P>A. In an umber guild and see phat lewts every day.  I can see why they see things totaly different from a cleric who has to depend on pick up groups for the most part to get loot and xp. No kidding Umber_Cleric-001 is going to give away or refuse donals boots.  After all his guild has been farming TT or PoG for months.<P>B. Cleric has a regular high level hunting group of friends that log on every day together.  This gives them a chance to regularly go to good loot and xp camps. They see loot as helping you help the regular group not a means of individual survivial.<P><BR>I have nothing againts either, they made the choices to be in thier situation. However they can not see things from your perspective. One you win or are given a loot, its yours to do as you please.  I don't care if its awarded to you from a GM.  It's yours, use it, sell it , give it away, destroy it.....<P>That one phat lewt every now and then keeps me above water.  It put you back in gear.  There are only 6 people's opinons you should care about with the second pair of boots, yours and your groups.<P>------------------<BR>Kenobe Wan<BR>Healer of the 53rd Circle<BR>Praxium Knight<BR>Cazic-Thule<P>"And one time, at cleric camp, I...."<p>[This message has been edited by Kenobe (edited 04-09-2001).]</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#f7f7f7"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Aean</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">people can be pricks <IMG SRC="http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/frown.gif"><P>man i was so pissed last week when i read that crap. mostly i just laugh or say something stupid cause it's only a game and i find message baords entertaining (long live groller!!) but that crap hit a nerve. I don't blame ya Mr. Dikmer, but if you would take a little cleric's suggestion i learned from a great martial artist *cough bruce cough* don't waste you time with people who waste yours. Some of those people might be jerks but the rest of us have at least a small amount of compassion for those who are in need. just ignore them, they'll go away eventually, in the mean time the rest of us can have some good times <IMG SRC="http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/smile.gif"></FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#dedfdf"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Boanerges</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Dikmer,<P>Welcome back to the EQ boards. Since the demise of Whineplay, people seem to be venting here and on other boards.<P>You wanted an opinion and you got it. I don't see why you're so upset. Some people agreed with you, others thought you were greedy. It's par for the course, really.<P>I've been trying for 2 months to get Verant to change our epic quest. EVERY time I make a public post somewhere I hear<P>"The cleric epic is the most common epic in the game"<BR>"The cleric epic is too easy"<BR>"That's why they call this an EPIC quest"<BR>"We shouldn't ask for a fix because there are other classes who need fixes more than us"<P>Every time I read one I want to scream and pull my hair out. They are either ill considered or incorrect. I wanna just throw up my hands and shout "OK! YOU WIN! I'LL JUST SIT HERE QUIETLY AND TAKE COMFORT IN THE FACT THAT MY EPIC QUEST IS TOO EASY DESPITE THE FACT THAT I MAY NEVER FINISH IT"<P>I know frustration well...<P>But then I remember why I post. I remember that random tell from out of the blue thanking me for my posts here. Ultimately, inevitably, someone learns something from all this. And it makes it all worth it.<P>Your post about NBG was enlightening, not only because of your posts but other peoples' as well. We got to look at the various ways to view NBG and how it's supposed to work in theory. We found that some agreed and some disagreed with you. It's what these boards are for.<P>You left the game and came back. You used the extra boots to repay kindness and fortunately got a second pair. You weren't familiar with NBG. And apparently your group had 0 problem with you getting a second pair. Yeah, some people have problems with that. Yeah, it was technically an abuse of NBG. But you learned. People have learned harder lessons on these boards. Just ask Rayne...<P>If you want to stop posting because you're tired then fine. But don't say you're going to stop because people didn't agree with you. Yes, you got publically burned by some but think about how many people who just lurk or couldn't even muster the courage to post learned right along with you.<P>This is THE only place to truly discuss cleirc issues and ONLY cleric issues. Everywhere else you must yell over 13 other classes. And soon, it may be gone forever, yet another victim of the Great Internet Crash of 2001.<P>You are very respected here, Dikmer. People listen to you. They like your posts. They like to hear how you're doing.
