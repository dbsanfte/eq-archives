<TEXTAREA NAME="EditedMessage" ROWS=10 COLS=45 WRAP="VIRTUAL">Aldur, I honestly don't know how to take your posts.  Basically on EMarr it works like this.  If you kill Aary, you are considered NToV capable and people respect that.  You get added to the Rotation.  If you can not or have not killed Aary, you are not factored in to things.  You do NOT get added into the Rotation until you have killed Aary.  It's as simple as that.

Basically when I say "it's not our problem" what I'm saying is this.  The guilds who kill Aary aren't going to give any favors to those who can't.  If you want added to the Rotation, you find Aary up and you kill him.  It's not our problem when you do this.  We will NOT train you or attempt to keep you out of NToV.  As long as you beat other Guilds to ToV FAIRLY, you will be respected there and can spend as long as you want (within reason) attempting to kill Aary.  After 3 days and 15 failures, things might be different but that hasn't come up.  On the other side though, an Aary capable guild isn't going to hold your hand with him.  We won't be giving you strats, we won't help you clear to him and we won't help you kill him.  That is YOUR job, not ours to prove that you are capable of getting into NToV.  This means it's up to you to figure out when he spawns, get to ToV first, and figure out how to kill him.

Aary IS the lock on ToV.  Aary spawns on a server reset almost immediately and no more than an hour afterwards.  This is to prevent people from getting past him quick.  After he is killed, he spawns almost exactly 7 days later (almost to the minute).  Basically, it's VERY rare on EMarr for people to kill Aary and NOT intend to do a full clearing in a, relatively, timely manner.  YES it does happen that on occassion a guild skips the occassional dragon (Vyemm, Jorl, Nev and the Trips are big candidates to be left up from time to time) but most guilds that start NToV by killing Aary fully intend to finish it with a complete clearing.

The reason people get angry when people kill other dragons and not Aary is because of how tough he is.  Using your PoG example, the plane is NOT the hard part.  Tunare is.  With NToV it's the exact opposite and that's why we're comparing apples to oranges.  Aary IS the hard part, NToV isn't.  

There really isn't a good way I can explain it.  It's just an ettiquette thing to not ride in on the coattails of another guild's hard work.  I really don't have any good answeres for you either.  I DO see your point and I understand you wanting more content and things to kill in a VERY crowded high end game.  NToV provides a LOT of that content since so many top end mobs and loot is concentrated in that one zone.  However, our view is that it comes down to simple courtesy.  Aary is TOUGH and he can take hours to kill severely reducing the time left for that day.  NToV for many guilds is not something that is done in a single day but done over a period of 2, 3,4 or even 5 days.  If another guild goes in on that 3rd day to kill dragons when we intend to finish up, yeah we're going to be pissed since we spent day 1 and 2 clearing Aary, named Flurries and other things for you.

The whole thing is VERY hard to explain and I hope that someone who is better with words than I am attempts to do so.  You're dealing with a lot of abstract and intangible things here.  You're also dealing with circumstances that change from week to week as different guilds clear NToV in different ways.  In Affliction, we start by killing Aary and we TRY and clear the zone as fast as possible now.  Basically we want to get our loot and get out.  We also do this in an effort to prevent other guilds from coming in behind us.  Other guild's do it differently and I CAN see how it is frustrating as Guild A to watch Guild B kill Aary on Tuesday and than leave the other NToV Dragons alive with the intent on coming back on Saturday to finish them off.  Personally, I find that disrespectful myself and I really can NOT blame Guild A from wanting to go in on Thursday to snag a few.

Anyway, that's just more of MY views on it.  Simply put, NToV is a VERY sore subject.  Personally I can't stand the politics that revolve around this single zone myself but I'm also a huge advocate of courtesy and decency.  In NToV's case, politcs and courtesy are often in direct confrontation with each other...
