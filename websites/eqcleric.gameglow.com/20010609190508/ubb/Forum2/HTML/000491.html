</FONT><HR>People, this has to stop.<P>I have a 50th enchanter alt, Sneer D`Logos(which I play more often of late) and I'm really discouraged by what I'm seeing comming up from the cleric community.<P>The skills just aren't there and the reason as I see it is celestial heal. It has to be the most abused spell in the game.<P>I see clerics who cast this spell and only this spell for hours on end. They are grouped with tanks who have around 2500 plus hit points and not one complete heal is ever cast. Consequently they are constantly saying they are lom at 20 or 40 or my favorite 'can't get mana to buff'. Sure Cel heal has a great ratio but its nothing compared to complete on a 50ish tank.<P>My cleric is level 52. All of the people that I have grouped with and have come to know over the past year and a bit as my cleric will tell you I know what I am doing, I am a VERY good cleric. I know what heal to use, when to use it and who to use it on. I manage my mana when I'm healing as well as is humanly possible. No one is ever without the buffs that they should have and they never have to ask for them, everything is timed. If I'm LOM and pulls need to be held for a minute, we just finished a long fight.<P>Sound concieted? Good. Now you have an idea of how confident I am in my abilities as a cleric; 90% of which, if not more, have been tuned by this site and the posts of the community here. So maybe my ill feelings towards this misuse of abilities is in part a case of the 'doctor making the worst patient' but I'm certain it's much more than that.<P>As a cleric I never really got to see what skills were possesed by the rest of our population. Now, as I play my enchanter more and more I can see how many clerics are playing. What I see is sad. I've had pulls which would zone chanterless groups instantly become controlled, which I'm sure is the norm for groups with a dealer. The problem is how the clerics I have been seeing react on such pulls. The pull is not, as far as I'm concerned, controlled until the enchanter has used a single target mez to ice all but the current kill target. Area mez doesn't count, that's not control, that's a temporary freeze. The time that it takes for the enchanter to control the fight is when the cleric needs to do the most work. A lot of people will be getting hit and you need to be very alert and give your enchanter those extra seconds he/she may need to control the pull.<P>The two people in the most danger during this time are the cleric and the enchanter. They are each responsible for the other. The enchanter CANNOT let his/her cleric get hit, that's death to the group as no heals can be past out; the enchanter's job is to protect the cleric at all costs. Often that means using area mez when you would rather take a bit of time to single them out, therefore, the pull is not controlled. The cleric CANNOT let his/her enchanter hit the floor. If class X and your enchanter are both going down, who do you heal first? No brainer.<P>Now back to celestial heal. You have this pull which is not controlled (maybe some mobs are held by area mez) and your enchanter is getting beat on by a couple of others who resisted, and his health is falling; it's your job to keep him/her alive. If you even THINK about casting celestial heal, I'm sorry, but you're a fool. You may as well run to the zone now and mem rez when you're out, it's the same thing.<P>Celestial heal is USELESS on enchanters with one exception that I've seen; cast on him/her BEFORE their health starts to drop when they are getting attention. But even then, be prepared to throw a remedy or whatever fast casting heal you have memmed soon thereafter. They do not have the hit points nor the AC to make it even remotely useful as a 'saving' heal; cast something else when the red starts to fall, please. I've had 4 mobs wailing on me, chew through rune4 and have me down to 2 or 3 bubbles of health before the cleric even STARTED casting. And what did they cast on me? Celestial heal. Stupid.<P>a_tank_00 tells the group 'damn'<BR>group_member_02 shouts 'TRAIN TO ZONE'<BR>silly_cleric_73 tells you 'Ready for res?'<P>This has happened over and over during the past few weeks that I have been playing my enchanter, not once or twice. I've been lucky with my stuns, many times one resist here or there on area stun and the next area mez would have been another death. And I'm sad to say it was no thanks to the cleric, no thanks to celestial heal.<P>Please, please, please, see celestial heal for what it is. Learn when to use it to its potential, but more importantly, learn when NOT to use it. I had initially hoped that such behaviour from my healer was just a bad apple, but it has continuted for too long and I believe that it is much more common than I had hoped. I'm going to start making hotkeys to explain how bad the spell can be if this doesn't stop. It's like trying to teach people the value of assisting all over again. I don't think I have it in me.<P>I believe that most of you here, if not all, reading this didn't need to. But maybe there was one . . .<P>------------------<BR>Illyna Iatros<BR>Hand of Tunare - 52nd Prayer<BR>Armatus - Saryrn Server</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#f7f7f7">

</FONT><HR>Hmm....I do use Celestial heal almost exclusvely and I am almost always fm because I do use it.  Meantime the shaman, chanters, and other casters are almost always LOM or oom while I am still able and ready.  <P>So much for your argument about Celestial Heal.  But I will add that I never use Celestial heal on casters.  I generally only use remedy on them because it is fast and can be used to control an immediate attack on the caster. Later if it looks ok, might do Divine light to top the heal if they are still that damaged.<P>Tindalus <BR>56 cleric Tarew Marr<BR>45 Cleric Fenin Ro</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#dedfdf">

</FONT><HR>Actually I agree with you totally, Illyna. Celestial Healing is a good SITUATIONAL spell. On raids it really sucks. I stick to Remedy/Divine Light. Why? I'd rather be at 20 mana and have my group around me alive than be FM and watch them die because Celestial Healing doesn't bump their HP fast enough.<P>Celestial Healing is a reverse DoT.<BR>Full heals like Divine Light are a reverse nuke.<P>If I want something dead asap, I'm sure not going to cast a DoT on it (/rude Turning of the Unnatural). You need to blow the crap out of it or suffer the consequences.  <IMG SRC="http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/wink.gif"><P>But I keep Celestial Healing memmed all the time, actually. If I notice a ranger/rogue/Sk dropping on hp throughout the battle, I toss a celestial healing on them and stack a remedy on top just to be safe.<P>This is just my opinions though. Everyone plays their characters different. I play mine as a complete mana waster. 8)<P>Sure, it's a bit more downtime if I'm LoM, but it's even more downtime if I have to wait for mana to rez you, wait for you to zone in from your rez, heal you, buff you back to where you were before you died, then wait for your rez effects to wear off.  <IMG SRC="http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/wink.gif"><P>Irys Angelborn<BR>55 Templar of Tunare<BR>The Haven, Karana Server</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#f7f7f7">

</FONT><HR>I understand your point, it is dumb using celestial heal on tanks with large amounts of health, but that is only in Certain situations. But I think that if you can heal(anyway u want) and not go low on manna, except after a bad pull or such where everyone is LOM, you are doing you job as a cleric just fine. Anyway if u can heal using other heals then compleat thats good, because letting someone get really low on health befor you heal them like compleat is always risky and u are safer if you heal early with celistail or remedy if you can.<P>Juiblex Healsalot<BR>Terrew Marr<BR>53 Vicar of Brell</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#dedfdf">

</FONT><HR>Using Celetial Healing on tanks is not stupid, just situational.  If you only use CH on tanks then you are going to constantly leave them at low health until CH is worth casting.  If the tank is pulling then Celestial Healing is a good alternative  to keep their health reasonable in case of a bad pull.  Otherwise<P>stupid_cleric_01 tells you "ready for rez?"<P>If you are fighting a steady stream of mobs Celestial Healing makes sense depending on how long it takes to kill the mob and how much damage the tank takes.  If the tank is low level or has bad AC then CH might be the better bet, but for a tank with kick ass AC throw in a Celestial Healing and med.<P>For casters of course you want to use DL and Remedy.  <P>Every spell has a use, you just need to figure it out.  Just using CH because of the mana/hp ratio is not always the best idea.  <P>And not using Celestial Healing on raids is not too smart either.  If you use rememdy/DL exclusively you will run out of mana and probably kill your group.  DL should only be used for specific instances, not as a common heal.

</FONT><HR>I agree with the original post, and consider myself fortunate that I was 52ish when celestial heal came out. It seems to be such a great spell that many clerics become overly dependent on it. It's a perfect downtime heal for casters and hybrids, but when someone is being actively beat on it needs the support of a direct heal.<P>I'd suggest for clerics who view it as their primary heal to play for a week without memming it to hone their direct-healing skills, it'll be worth it in the end.<P>As far as the pre-engagement use of celestials, I am definitely all for that. I see a multi-pull of planar+ mobs come in and the first thing I do is pop a CE on the enchanter and sometimes the shaman as well. To use a celestial in this way, your spell must hit your target before the mobs start beating on him.<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#f7f7f7">

</FONT><HR>It all depends on the mob's damage output. Used in conjuction with some type of high level slow spell, celestial is extremely useful.

</FONT><HR>I'm not sure why people still knock divine light. Great spell, especially for raids. It has a better efficiency and delivers more hp/sec than remedy. Since raid mobs usually hit fairly hard, you usually don't overheal very often. And it's the only spell that will save an enchanter on a 8 mob hate pull (which we didn't have to camp for since both chanters lived and only 2 of the mobs were spites).<P>As for healing 50+ tanks, Celheal is good to top off the puller. However, if the main tank isn't the puller, I don't care what his hp are in most places.  I just CH him when he gets to about 1 and 3/4 red left.  Once I get used to the battle flow of an area, I can usually figure out when to cast the CH or mix in a cel heal to get him to finish a fight near full health so I don't have to worry about early agro on the next fight. Sticking with CH as much as possible usually saves alot of mana on tanks with 3000+ hp.  <P>All things concidered, verant gave us a very good selection of heals.  Most raids, I have CH, DL, remedy, cel heal, and a group heal up just because of the flexability it gives me in efficiency vs. hp delivered over time.  They're all useful.<P>Kandolek<BR>54 cleric on BB<BR>Seekers of Lore</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#f7f7f7">

</FONT><HR>I really think that Celestial Heal is a great spell, it's defintely not always for use on tanks, that's for certain. <P>I think that a lot of people don't really realize the low aggro that this spell generates and factors that in with some situations. <P>I was in Sebelis the other day with my druid because one of my guildmates needed a snarer, so I joined them in the Jail. There was a cleric there that did not use CH, and had 2 tanks and a rogue in group besides the enchanter and him. I join the group, immediately go into gchloro/gthorn mode, and doing the normal snaring of all mobs and dotting the ones that are engaged with the tanks with my ES vambs... <P>I'm watching the tanks health, and they hit 1 bubble, and the cleric casts CelHeal... *sigh* and sits back down...<P>I'm like "WTH are you doing man!!!" to myself as I watch in disgusted amazement the frog takes the warrior down. At this point the warrior is almost dying and I get a tell: "Heal man, this cleric's worthless, he's not using CH at all..." <P>First off... the cleric is level 51. No Div Light. Only Remedy. No problem there, but now that pretty much narrows him down to three spells, imho... Remedy, CelHeal, and CH. Now, the way I do it is I let the tank call it when he *wants* to go low, and use his Disc's for the Crits or what have you. ONLY then do I ever let a tank even get NEAR one bubble of health left. I make this perfectly clear at all times because in a place like Seb, you can get one bad pull and bring 10 frogs with you, and people will go down FAST. That is not a time for CelHeal. That's the time for Remedy/DivLight, CH, and LASTLY CelHeal. <P>CelHeal is *definitely* situational.<P>Here's how I use it:<P>Same group: 2 tanks, Rogue, Druid, my 54 Vicar, and Enchanter: <P>Spells memmed from top to bottom: Reckoning, Stun(5), Holy Might(stun), 49 Root, CH, CelHeal, DivLight, Remedy.<P>In Seb, having Divine Barrier up is a waste of my time and a valuable spell slot. I can stun, root, and sit/mem gate quickly or run to a spot where CR is easy enough if my group gets overrun somehow. <P>Now... I'm regarded as a pretty effective cleric, I rarely have a death, and if it is, it's usually either due to lag, or because I had to make a judgement call and let someone die. I keep the actual 'mistake' deaths to a minimum. Here's what I do:<P>Tank pulls 2-3 mobs, chanter mezzes, tank engages one. Pretty easy fight, usually this kind of pull goes pretty well, as long as mezz is kept, healing the tank is a snap, and I'll use CelHeal on him occasionally to keep him and others fresh, unless he says to let him get low to use disc's, then I sit and wait for the CH time. This is a fine situation to use it in, you cast and sit back down to med. No biggie, right?<P>Now imagine the same pull, but something goes horribly wrong and the chanter can't mez a couple. Tank's getting beat on, Chanter gets beat on, and I'm in the situation where the tank will die about the same time as the chanter or sooner... <P>Fire off DivLight/Remedy to save chanter, immediately turn and hit tank with remedy/divlight (depending on his health bar dropping speed) and then follow up with CelHeal, to give me a moment to assess the rest of the group's situation. By this time the chanter should have recovered and tried to mezz (hopefully successfully) again. If chanter is getting beat on by a single mob, fire off stun quickly, then root while chanter backs off, as soon as root hits, Fkey the chanter, hit 4 (cel heal) and turn attention back to tanks/rogue. Now... during this time the Druid should have been doing HIS job and watching the chanter's back for me, as well as follow up heals for him while I divert my attention to others... Notice I assume the druid *isnt'* doing his job, but I know they do most of the time, and back me up when I have that choice to make. If you're playing as a well organized team, you should be able to pick up on what the cleric's order of importance is, and cover accordingly. <P> When I'm playing my druid, the Chanter and cleric are MY responsibility to watch, I keep THEM alive while they keep the others safe. <P>The whole time I cast my heals, I have done by hotkeys, my 1 key is sit, 2 is cast first stun (/cast 2) and then 3 is CH, 4 CelLight, 5 Div Light, and 6 rememdy. I use a split keyboard, so 6 key is very easy to find, even by touch. I always make all hotkeys announce the spell being cast, and the target being cast on, in Group say, and using the :emote command. This covers me when I'm casting on a non-group member, and is a good thing too!<P>Anyway, I depend on CelHeal as a low aggro heal when time demands are not tight as to how fast a player *needs* healing, so I can fire it off, sit back down, and assess the situation. When it is a tense fight and I know I have to conserve mana, the only thing the tanks are gonna get is CH. Let em get low, start casting at 2 bubs of health, it'll hit when they're at 1 bubble, plenty of safety net, as long as they're not getting slammed super fast. If they're dropping too quick, a remedy/div light, followed by a cel heal and then maybe another div light to get em higher so I can reassess my timing for a CH, or divert attention to another party member while the CelH works on the tank and *hopefully* either keeps them at where they're at or gain health back. <P>Typically though I use Cel Heal for the following: <P>Non-critical heals where the player isn't being beat on and is a caster/rogue/bard, or need to heal not super quick to keep aggro down.<P>Keeping tank at a status quo while I med, or divert my attention, where aggro on myself needs to be kept at a minimum (i.e. can't do a CH or I'm gonna get gang banged) again, healing over time demands exactly that: TIME to heal. <P>Situations I don't use CelHeal: <P>Multiple mobs, needing mezzes, waiting to beat on chanter or tank, Mana conservation times, or when Tank's health is just dropping too darn fast to keep up with using CelHeal. When I am timing for CH, or when a tank wants to bezerk/use disc.<P>Cel Heal should be used only when you have the TIME for it to work. If you cast CelHeal on a caster while they're getting beat on, you had better hit them with a BIG heal first to top em, so that the CelHeal works like a "maintenance" heal over time, so that the tanks have time to peel the mob off them. <BR><P>------------------<BR>Kiisk Silveroak, 51 Wanderer <BR>Tenderlove Moonlight 54 Vicar<BR>Garaz D'Basher 51 Pimp Troll Warrior</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#f7f7f7">

</FONT><HR>I value the importance of all my heals.<P><B>BUT</B> you have to know <B>when</B> to use each one!<P>Situation 1: Kael raid, 3 groups, average level 50, Me 52cler, Cleric02 is 51 and Cleric03 45.  No one tank was holding agro.  Mostly my groups pally with his stuns or 02's group with his pally.  No ONE tank is getting hurt enough to warrant a Comp Heal.  So I bust out Sup heal and Cel heal and keep everyone topped off.  Soon 03 needs to go, and group 3 is left with a Shaman59 and Druid49 to heal.  Knowing the Druid and watching the shaman die a LOT due to slow resists, I start assisting the Mobs and throwing a Cel Heal on the tank of the moment.  No one died.<P>Situation 2: Sebilis group, fighting at exit, low stress, high fun.  Tank is 52, rogue 46, enc 55, druid 49(same one!), Ubershaman 57 and me 52.  Now, I would CH our tank when he got low enough, but that was only when we had to derail a few trains.  Normally a Cel or Remedy would keep everyone full up. Especially with slows!<P>I dont know if its just the people I group with, but NO ONE can seem to hold agro long enough to warrant a Comp Heal.  I have been using more and more group heals (Loving Heroic Bond! Woot!) to keep everyone healed up.  <P>As always tho, enc get ONLY remedy or sup heal.  I didnt level up 30 levels with an enc at my side to not learn that keeping them alive is the MOST important thing to do.  Cel healing a caster is signing their death certificate if they are agro'd.

</FONT><HR>I am a 55th cleric on the cazic server, and i am an avid user of the Cel heal (even on casters). The reson why is that if i get it off when a tank is down 2 bubs or caster 1 bub.I alows me to heal other members in the group (Gives me that extra time so I can get a Cheal off on a tank and not worry about people dieing in the middle of my cast) while I let it work its magic. I am sorry but at the higher levels Rem just is not enuff to save a chanter/caster, and devine light is just about worthless, unless you got a Monk/ranger as your main tank then you use that insted of cheal =Þ. Cel heal is so powerful, with just Clar if I cast Cel heal and sit down I make up the mana used and a wee bit more before it even wears off. And a tip for the clerics to help out the chanters. Keep atone memed save the chanter some spell slots and by getting rid of that nasty agro, it will save you more mana in the long run then by chain casting REm on the chanter.<P>Dolfar Harkon<BR>-55th Priest of Innoruuk-<BR>Veeshan Guard<BR>Cazic</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#f7f7f7">
