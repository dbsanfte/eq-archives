Oddly enough, my armor rating is nearly as good (or bad, depending on your perspective.)  This also works with warriors, of course, the effect is just much more dramatic in my case.<P>When we get multiple pulls, I've taken to jumping up, smacking the extras, and keeping them root parked. <P>I look like a jack-in-the-box running all over the place trying to keep bats or kobolds parked in the corners or down a hall, but I do actually get a little time to med even with 3 parked.  <P>To me, this is a far preferable method to trying to keep up with healing a ranger tanking 3 at a time.  We end up with nicely paced one-at-a-time fights, and even 4-6 roots are cheaper than heals.<P>Additional advantages:  Excellent practice on your defense, alteration and specialization.  It helps when you aggro several after healing.  Root doesn't break the mez - and keeps them off the enchanter while they cast.  Much more exciting than sitting.  <IMG SRC="http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/smile.gif">  <P>Downside:  you might want a backup healer when your roots all break at once...<P>Comments?  Do you ever end up doing something like this in the 50s?</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#f7f7f7"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Dikmer</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Hotkey #3 for me:<P>/g Root parking this %t<BR>/cast 6<P>Yes, I root park ALOT. Even with an enchanter in the group. Cause root doesn't break mez, I root to give them time to mez or root after mez is on so they don't run into the fight when mez breaks. <P>The only thing I don't like is when you have 4 MOB's rooted and mezzed and get a message "Root has worn off" or whatever it is. And you don't know which one it is. I wish it was like "Root has worn off of a %T"<P>And it doesn't really take much of your med time to do this. I think most good clerics use root alot.</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#dedfdf"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Islington</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">With my Paladin, I became very good with Root Parking or as we call it Ghetto Mezzing.  This is something I carried over to my Cleric as well and use to very good effect.  The only problem is that my Cleric is at a lower level and people don't know what I'm doing as much so I have to explain before the Warrior comes running to my "rescue."<P>With my Paladin, I toss out a stun and wack the mob a couple of times to draw aggro and then root the critter away.  If you don't have an Enchanter, this is a perfectly viable way t keep several mobs locked down while you kill one.<P>A bunch of friends and I (3 Druids and a Shadow Knight) cleared all of Nurga with ghetto mez as our sole form of crowd control.  It was probably one of the best times of my EQ experience.  We were hardly a balanced group, but we did just fine.  Ghetto mezzing was a requirement though, otherwise there would have been far too many gobbies to worry about.</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#f7f7f7"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">kitsinu</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Sadly parking mobs doesn't work as well when you get to Karnor's.

Only the hands themselves seem to break root quickly. (15 seconds or less sometimes) but the pulls of Sentry's, Skels, even bodyguards, I am able to root park quite effectivly. Works well when your chanter isn't high enough to cast that mez that also mem blurs. Chanter mezs, I root and the chanter doesn't get eaten when mez breaks.<P>Hands seem to break root quickly, but seem to mez quite easy, so that's a tossup.</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#f7f7f7"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">SeaOfHoles</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">I regularly group with a 53 Ranger.  If my main is a Warrior, I will often do CC root parking as necessary.  However, a Ranger is designed for this purpose.  I think he should be the one root parking or at least the one positioning the MOBS for you to root park.<P>Our regular group consists of 53 Ranger, 56 Rogue, 51 Enchanter, 51 Druid/51 Shaman, 51 Druid, 54 Cleric(Me).  Our current trick is for Druids/Cleric to root the live MOB.  This keeps the MOB on the Ranger, keeping the Rogue free for chain backstabs.  With the Ranger taking all the damage, I also don't need to waste buffing mana on the Rogue.<P>Since all my roots are damageless, I am responsible for enstilling mezzed MOBS, giving the Enchanter an excellent chance to re-mezz at his convenience, without taking damage.<P>------------------<BR><B>Murrachan Moorsfang</B>(54th Rank Dwarven Vicar)<BR><B>Briathrachan Moorsfang</B>(51st Rank Halfling Warrior)<BR>Mist Riders<BR>Mithaniel Marr</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#dedfdf"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">kaharz</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">When there was no chanter in the group I used to try to do what you do Llew and jump in and pull the mobs away.. never seem to work though.  I think it was always because the tanks just don't assist as much when there is no chanter and 4 of tanks.<P>I still use root park a lot though.  If anything breaks away from the tanks and agros me or another caster, I put on my valet jacket.  Even if we have a chanter I end up root parking on pulls that are 3 mobs or larger so the enchanter doesn't have to try to mem-wipe and mez two mobs at once if they don't remez before it breaks.<P>I never really run across a downside to root parking.  I guess it is a waste of mana if you only have a few mobs and a decent chanter, but outside of that it's just a good thing.<P>Kaharz Stronginthearm<BR>45th lvl cleric of Brell<BR>Rodcet Nife<BR>Flames of Faradhim<BR></FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#f7f7f7"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Sonard</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">I used to use root parking, but don't really bother anymore, either the chanter can do it, or if no enchanter, means the mobs have such a high MR that root won't stick anyway.<P>Did come up with a new tactic in EW the other day though (I HATE this zone, no place to med without getting whacked by wanderer's every 30 seconds).  Me and pally were doing the coldain ring quest, and kept argroing mobs while trying to med.  At first the pally would tank them (he was level 55 and I am level 52) but this didn't help as we would just get add after add after add, and  I would end up healing him, blowing that mana I had been building during the fights.  So I came up with a solution for adds:  fear/atone.  Cast invoke fear, when he takes off start casting atone.  By the time the spell hits, he is out of agro range and if the atone sticks, he won't come back.  If he does, it will be at least 10 seconds for him to get back to you so you can be ready for him (where if I had root parked em, they would be on me in an instant).  Added bonus was I always get a kick out of a mob getting feared, it just strikes me funny for some immature reason to see a bully suddenly get the spit scared out of him.  I know it's not entirely related to what you said, but thought it was a cool thing, and maybe someone else can put it to use.</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#dedfdf"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Fryg</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Always try to root park with my cleric, a hangover of playing an enchanter.
