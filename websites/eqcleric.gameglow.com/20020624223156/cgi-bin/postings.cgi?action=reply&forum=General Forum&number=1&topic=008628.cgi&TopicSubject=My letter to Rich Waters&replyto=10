<TEXTAREA NAME="ReplyMessage" ROWS=10 COLS=45 WRAP="VIRTUAL">[QUOTE]Originally posted by Lind:
[B][b]I was heartened to see your comments on the castersrealm webpage regarding priest rebalancing, though I admit that I have some trepidation from the perspective of a cleric.  It is the impression of many clerics that we are often considered to be the benchmark priest class that the other classes are 'balanced up' to.  Druids in particular often complain about their lack of function in raid environments, and will cite the fact that raids are 'dependant' upon clerics as an argument for their own rebalancing.[/b]
 
  It sounds more like you're whining about druids than trying to reveal a problem with clerics.
  
[b]Druids argue that they are not useful on raids and are therefore restricted from an important aspect of the game.  That same argument can be turned around and used from the cleric perspective.  Nobody ever cancelled a raid for lack of druids, but when was the last time you saw a cleric quad-kiting in the Cobalt Scar?  Druids are not the only class that has been restricted from an important aspect of the game.  I hope that in your rebalancing of the priest classes, you can make just as serious an inroad toward allowing Clerics 'out of the box' as you will with allowing druids more versatility in healing.  Let us solo.  Let us be efficient in small groups again.[/b]
 
  Clerics can't quad, druids have no place in AE groups.  Clerics can and probably should be made more fun to play and to be able to solo better, but it really has nothing to do with druids.
 
[b]That's really all I want to say, and I thank you for taking the time to read this.  The only thing I could add is that I've lived with all three classes on raids, and frankly I -know- that druids and shamans are effective for most healing in raid groups.  It is my impression that the very versatility of these classes is what hurts them in the healing category.  As a cleric, I heal because I have no options otherwise.  All of my attention and resources are devoted to healing.  As a druid or shaman, I have other options, and it's only when a druid or shaman doesn't devote themselves 100% to healing that they are ineffective on a raid.[/b]
   
  Okay, so you are whining about druids.  Honestly spending your time trying to get devs to ignore others complaints is pretty low.
 
  I've played a 60 druid, 60 cleric and a 60 shaman on raids.  No, druids can't heal unless you're raiding Crushbone.  Next raid unmem everything but Judgement and your level 34 superior heal (which is more efficient than the level 60 Nature's Touch) and you are a druid.  Enjoy.  Shaman's can't heal FAST, and they can't heal well outside their group, but most times when damage isn't coming in too fast they'll keep their party alive if not themselves.
 
  You also mention versatility being what makes the other classes less focused on healing.  The fact is though that clerics are just as versatile as the other classes.  For everything druids or shamans can do, there is something clerics can do, although fear may not be as useful as slow, or stun as useful as malo clerics are every bit as versatile.
 
[b]Much of the healing on a raid does -not- involve casting Complete Heal on a tank, and giving druids more healing versaitility will not improve their position on a raid unless the players take on the 'healer' mindset.[/b]  
 
  Most druids have a healer mindset and few do anything but heal despite how bad they are at it by 60.  Why do you think druids are ASKING for healing versatility?  Because they think they're wizards?
 
  Druids won't and shouldn't get healing versatility, that is the cleric role.  But the fact is that heals haven't really been upgraded since Kunark where your tough mobs on the way to kill that ever so threatening Trakanon are NOWHERE NEAR as threatening as your typical mob in The Deep or Ssra and CT where they hit for 400.  Druids, shamans AND clerics need upgraded healing.
 
  A 60 druid has nukes as efficient as a 60 wizard.  Their best heal is LESS efficient than a level 34 cleric heal.  DESPITE THIS many (not all) druids still have the delusion they are healers and are crying for more healing.  Maybe it has to do with getting outnuked by clerics at 56.
  
[b]It is my observation that most druids consider raid-healing to be a degrading role.[/b]
 
  Um... yeah.
