<br />
All that i have to say is that if they do this, ill be happy.  Happy you say?  Yes.  Happy.<br />
<br />
Our class is boring as hell to play right now.  If they are considering adding a CH type spell to shaman and druids, then they NECESSARILLY have to make some changes to our class.<br />
<br />
The way it stands, we are boring as hell to play, and I welcome the chance to be more diverse.<br />
<br />
I refuse to believe that Verant would even consider the spells for shaman and druids without something in store for clerics.  Hell, even look at the test accompanying the spells in the spdat.  They are talking to clerics.<br />
<br />
<br />
Good, give shaman and druids our lame ass Cheal, and give me some stuff to make the class fun to play.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Zeist</div><div class="date">08-21-2002, 01:53 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">They could have named it anything other than &quot;Druid - CH&quot;, couldn't they? <br />
<br />
I mean, that has got to be designed to incense clerics. It isn't even a complete heal, yet they chose that name. Had they chosen to call it &quot;Druid - Big Giant Heal&quot;, it would surely have angered a portion of the cleric population once they figured out what it meant, but this is ridiculous.<br />
<br />
Ridiculous.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Borick</div><div class="date">08-21-2002, 02:09 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">This kind of spell is the PERFECT upgrade for druids and shamans.  I'm impressed at the clever design.  The numbers may need to be tweaked just a bit, since 2000 points isn't 75% of the hit point pool of a fully-buffed level 60 warrior, but the design for this is perfect.<br />
<br />
Capping it at 75% of total limits it's impact on the soloing game while giving all the priest classes a more effective tool in raids.    Cap it at 4k instead of 2k, and you can effectively solve much of the druid issues.  <br />
<br />
Yes, they're likely to still bitch, since it still won't replace clerics, but still druids can hold their own at need and replace a certain percentage of clerics on a raid.  On non-vital encounters, druids could manage their own rotation.   You might see more guilds tackling Velious raid content.  Good idea, Verant.  I'm glad to see this.<br />
<br />
And less we seem reactionary, I'd caution about bitching about this one.  This spell can't replace our role.  This spell will NOT reduce the need for clerics.  This spell WILL help address druid concerns and help add a few more shamans to the raid pool.<br />
<br />
Now, let our pet live between fights and give us a limited damage mitigation spell... perhaps a better root... <br />

Mana: 400 Skill: Alteration <br />
<br />
Now add a regular Healing3 item so is that (with a 5% average increase) a 3071 heal giving a mana to hp ratio of 1:7.68. As for the spell, if it goes live so would I expects VI response to cleric whishes an needs be:<br />
<br />
1. Invis<br />
2. Undead dd bumpbed to 950 damage (1:3 mana/dmg ratio)<br />
3. Levi spell that costs a pearl to use.<br />
<br />
With that they will consider it done (of course our group value is even more killed but hey, we got the regular CH and that will make us wanted. Same way a warrior is in a exp group...). Will be even funnier to see that Canni5 shaman going now in CT and I cant wait to see druids two weeks after it goes live demand a better CH because it dont cut it for them.<br />
<br />
*edit* It did not even take them two weeks to complain it aint enough. It took them 24h. It aint fast enough and it dont heal enough. I can only feel sorry for the clerics who will try to compete with druids for a exp group if this goes live.<br />

When I first heard this I went off like a pack of firecrackers. I was really ticked that they (VI) can work this in their testing but, can't seem to find the time to toss clerics a bone for an invisibilty spell. This is a major upgrade for our fellow priests in terms of viability for both raid and exp settings should it go live. I would expect the same level of upgrading for clerics in terms of damage output and utility to balance the scales. Yea, doing this further homgonizes the priests but, at this point in the game, what does it matter? If I am going to most likely spend more time looking for groups for exp, I might as well be able to solo more effciently or at the very least bring more to the table for a group where damage output and ultility have gained the edge over the need for healing. On the raid side this upgrade makes more sense, too bad it cannot be confined there.</div></div><hr />

I can see the concern younger clerics have about being replaced even more so in exp groups.  As a raid cleric I can see the value of these heals since most clerics are in chain, a druid or shaman currently has very little to offer in the way of out of chain heals, so I can see this as a big help on raids.  it also means not just a cleric with GCh or a shaman on torpor can heal clerics.  Druids can do this as well now.  I see that as a plus.<br />
<br />
I do hope this means we will get looked at more closely as well.<br />

Maybe it's fine for raids, i'm sure it can get some pleasure back to druids especially, but considering xp groups, bye bye clerics (it is almost already the case anyway)...<br />

I don't myself need ensnare or sow or whatever, i just wanna be a cleric, i know some of us needs more, maybe a counterpart will be fine then...<br />

<br />
In that post you indicated, who is complaining? It's 4:21 am where I am, and I just read through the Druids Grove thread, and the one post that has a criticism of the spell came from a player who is also an epic-owning level 58 cleric.<br />
<br />
I'm sure there will be a few naysayers here and there, but that does not represent the entire community any more than a few dissident opinions here make all clerics this way or that. <br />
<br />
I'd say let the threads develop over time before jumping to the conclusion that druids are bitching about the change.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Saarem</div><div class="date">08-21-2002, 06:41 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">To Fox, as I emailed you before so did I stop posting on DG when the admins started with selective moderation towards all but druids. But to give you who:<br />
<br />
Fayne posts:<br />
 I think they either need to lower the cast time or up the max amount of possible heal. <br />
<br />
Talanya posts:<br />
 As for this heal, it is better than I expected, but I have some reservations about it the way it looks like it would work. I think it should either have the maximum cap raised a bit (a 5000 hp cap would make it an actual 75% heal on all but the pretty high end tanks), or they should remove the percentage part and leave it as a 3kish heal with the same stats otherwise as CH.<br />
<br />
Rainus posts:<br />
 3k cap is kinda of low imo ...<br />
<br />
<br />
You might think that 3k upgrade greater than our current 1k heal ...<br />
<br />
but 10 sec cast time ...<br />
<br />
if persay it becomes a 3k heal .. in 5 secs .. that might be more in line with our general roles as spot healers<br />
<br />
And the regular druid sucks posters have not even started posting. So no Fox, I stand at my statements.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I hope so too.  Our big &quot;balance&quot; for these spells so far looks like our *cough* pet upgrade.  Less mana and faster cast time.  <br />
<br />
Might as well have made those changes to True North instead of our pet.  Would have been the same result.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">elrin</div><div class="date">08-21-2002, 06:54 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">This subject is now raging on my guilds boards with views from lots of people in condemnation of VIs latest move to merge classes.<br />
As one of our warriors stated &quot;What next? give SKs &amp; Paladins defensive?&quot;<br />
Its a valid point...<br />
What do they give us? better melee? If i wanted to play a Paladin i would have done.<br />
better nukes? If id have wanted to play a Wizard I would have done.<br />
<br />
As my good friend Windy states, I just want to be a damn cleric man, Scott if you are reading this...enough with the class merging my friend.<br />

<br />
As for the posts you quoted, Rainus is the one who is also a cleric. Fayne and Talenya raised some good points and weren't trolling with illegitimate complaints.<br />
<br />
Nothing has been set in stone, so let's stop the metadiscussion.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Zarros</div><div class="date">08-21-2002, 07:21 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">If this is the end of priest balancing, and I hope it isn't, then the demand for clerics in xp groups is going to drop a lot.  In order to balance this, unless the intent is to get rid of clerics, clerics are going to need some comparable upgrades. <br />
<br />
The more I think about this, the more I agree that priest balancing seems to be moving us towards a single priest class, with slightly differant &quot;flavors&quot; if you will.  Personally, I don't think this is a bad thing.<br />
<br />
My personal wish list:<br />
* Faster casting time on undead-only nuke spells, or keep the casting time and increase the damage.  Giving them a lure-like effect would also be a good thing, but could make us into soloing machines against undead.<br />
<br />
* Rather than improving nukes, give us a persistent, and controllable pet.  Call it a servent of the gods or somesuch.  Something on-par with the Shaman pet that would allow us to bring more than healing/buffing to xp groups.<br />
<br />
* A self-only form of invis and self-only levitate.  Combine them and call it &quot;Divine Infusion&quot; and let it be our analog to DMF maybe (ok, maybe thats over the top ;) )<br />
<br />
* Increased cap on weapon skills and offense/defense.  On par with a paladin.  Just give me a chance to be something other than &quot;Casey at the Bat&quot; when I want to melee guys, and no, I'm not asking for dual wield, bash, double-attack, or anything even remotely like it.<br />
<br />
I say give the druids and shamans increased power to rez.  Heck, give them a series of &quot;reincarnation&quot; spells that include an &quot;illusion: zone monster&quot; side effect that cannot be clicked off.    For xp returned, have it 1 step behind paladin, or even equal to paladin (and then does this mean rangers get them too?  who knows)  The point is that rezzing is NOT that amazing an ability, its more a source of frustration for me when I get tells asking for rezzes, or people expect me to traverse zones to get to them.<br />
<br />
What I want is more flexibility, and a more interesting role.  As it stands now, I can see how &quot;botted&quot; clerics are possible - we are a very simple class to play except in the most intense of situations.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mithrull</div><div class="date">08-21-2002, 07:21 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Silly idea. Neither of these classes need this, especially Shaman. How on Earth do Shamans need a more effective way to heal than slow? Slow is just an indirect way to heal and a damn good one.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Aaeamdar</div><div class="date">08-21-2002, 07:25 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, In the same post by Rich Waters a while back, when they said they were turning their attention from pets to priests, he did specifically mention as one of the goals to make Clerics more versatile.<br />
<br />
So far, my only disapointment with &quot;caster balancing&quot; has been the pace (well, that and the manner focus effects were implemented), but most of the changes have been very nice.  I'll expect whatever they do to &quot;make Clerics more versatile&quot; will make most Clerics happy (but I will also expect that whatever they do will take to long to do it :)  ).<br />
<br />
In the end, I suspect all casters wil do quite well.  Then PoP will come out and some will get the short end again.  We won't find out whom until then, though.  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kero</div><div class="date">08-21-2002, 07:26 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">It's not the druid heal, per se that gets me a bit... worried.  <br />
<br />
It's the two changes together than concern me.  The druid/shammy heal and the pet change... That somehow Verant is equalling the two... that's what concerns me.  *sigh*  Even though I'm not of a level to use the pet yet, I don't think somehow that the pet change balances the heal they gave the druids/shammies.  As far as the druid class goes, yes, I think this is great for them.  As far as the shaman class goes, yes, I think this is great for them.  As far as the pet changes go... yes, I think that's neat.  Will the pet changes be the only balance to the heals, should everything go live as is?<br />

We'll see, won't we.</div></div><hr />

It's not a CH and it shouldn't be, it is however a decent heal and the 75% with a cap is very appropriate. <br />

With all these changes there is nothing for druids to really complain about.  I'm still waiting to see how they complete the class balancing and I do hope you guys get your invis.  Would make corpse recovery so much easier and safter for one.  <br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">JanSorensen</div><div class="date">08-21-2002, 07:41 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">As I also posted on DG - I think the druid spell will be too good if all focus items and AA skills work with it.<br />
<br />
2925 hp for 400 mana<br />
<br />
HA3: +10%, IH3: +7.5% (guessed), HG3 +10% (but I will ignore that as its hard to utilize).<br />
<br />
Spec200: -11% cost, SCM3: -10% cost, MP3: -5.5% (on average)<br />
<br />
Spell haste 3: 15% faster<br />
<br />
means: 3458 hp (+whatever HG is worth) for 294 mana with 8.5 casting time.<br />
<br />
Thats 11.8 hp/mana at 8.5 sec compared to CH for 316 mana at 10.0 sec. So, a CH at 3729 hp has the same ratio but casts slower.<br />
<br />
Imho thats too close to CH. Remove all focus but range as is the case for CH and it gets better - but still a tad good - remove HA/HG as is effectively the case for CH and it would be fine imho - but that particular solution would be stupid.<br />
<br />
Anyway - if the druid heal isnt excluded from all but the range focus then I personally think its a problem.<br />
<br />
As for what clerics need - more offensive power. Invis, while nice, doesnt really yield any power. Making MoR/MoK higher DS/Heal but shorter duration could be a solution - say half the duration, 3x the DS and 2x the healing per hit.</div></div><hr />

But really, this would go another step down the path of who needs a cleric for a regular xp group 54+.  Honestly, the number of things VI would have to give us in return to make us wanted is a long list.  THe only other option is to improve our solo abilities... and really, who here starte a cleric to solo.<br />

Please don't get me wrong... it is not class envy.  It is disheartenment that these changes would go in at the same time the joke of a pet change would go in for us.<br />

If this spell goes live clerics can forget about exp groups anywhere. Yes, we'll still be viable in raids and the preferred healing choice but outside of that our days are numbered.<br />
<br />
Wait? A better pet you say? Great, just call me a magician that can heal. Guess what, they spend half of their days soloing as well.<br />

I guess I'll play Doc to 60 and just break him out for raids. I'll stick to my monk otherwise.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lair Shaani</div><div class="date">08-21-2002, 07:52 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">It's the first time I'm gonna whine about clerics since beta3, and even though it is still a test spell, it's scary enough to react now.<br />
<br />
I've been playing a cleric since beta, i've seen our class go from somewhat versatile (good nukes, possibly the most damaging nukes when I dinged my new nuke spells before 50, lots of stuns to go vs clerics, mob parking with root, and of course the best healer no questions asked), to a bit less versatile in Kunark (byebye nukes, stuns are given to more and more classes and is getting more and more resisted as a magic spell), to even less versatile in Velious (more stun issues, nukes are almost useless unless you want to take on a greenie with the insane mob RM, mobs start to be unrootable or same with high RM)....<br />
<br />
... and now we are almost restricted to healing, Aego, and rez. Why did we pay so much for losing anything else really worth it ? Two words : Complete Healing. Our class is possibly the one which stagnated the most since Norrath and Complete Healing because we already had the most efficient heal 3 years ago. Recently they raised our nuke damage (ha ha, now I crit for 1233 .. so what ? I didn't roll a cleric for nukes, and beside this it doesn't make us able to do anything more than have a little ego boost from our poor &quot;nuke when you're FM and have nothing to heal anyway&quot;) and they removed the healing penality of druids and shamans.<br />
<br />
Some may think a CH capped at 3K is not overpowered at all. I don't know how your guild raid but when i'm parsing a fight I find most CH under 3K in a rotation, so if there is a lag spike, a flurry, a cleric goes LD, the tank is still alive.<br />
Still, I don't complain about that, more power to them. The real question is : WHAT'S IN FOR US who may be worse healers than druids and shammys except regular CH if this goes live, and have nothing else to do beside Aego/Rez on Luclin ? Did we roll a cleric to Aego/Rez and do nothing really better in our speciality (hint: that is healing :p) than classes who can actually solo well and are already welcome in most groups ?<br />
<br />
I don't nuke well and I don't want to nuke well.<br />
I don't debuff well and I don't want to debuff well.<br />
I don't solo well and I don't want to solo well.<br />
I have no means of fast traveling and I don't want them either.<br />
I rolled a cleric in 1999 to HEAL and I still want to be the best at it no questions asked, because I traded everything else for it since the beginning.<br />
<br />
If druids have a better healing spell, up our regular healing spells accordingly. A cleric is all about a single spell enough already.<br />
IMO the real problem is CH : Nerf it, remove it, then give druids a 3Khp spell and clerics a 4Khp spell, as long as my class remain the best healer from ANY point of view and not only the CH one, you can take what you want from me.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Adon</div><div class="date">08-21-2002, 07:55 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Wow...I would say that the only problem I have is that the spells should be level 59+, so they don't step on the shoes of clerics in the 50s for exp groups.  These spells are for raids and HIGH end like Cazic Thule, its not like mid and low 50s druids/shamans need a big heal for Sebilis or Velketors...<br />
<br />
Adon's list of changes to clerics that will make this change &quot;balanced&quot;.<br />
<br />
Clerics need something MAJOR for this, in my opinion. For 75% CH, how about:<br />
<br />
75% slow?<br />
<br />
75% snare?<br />
<br />
75% teleports?<br />
<br />
75% SoW?<br />
<br />
75% DoTs?<br />
<br />
75% pets?<br />
<br />
75% invis?<br />
<br />
75% Targetable AEs?<br />
<br />
75% Debuff?<br />
<br />
Here is what I propose:<br />
<br />
-You can make Slow/Snare Undead only.<br />
<br />
-We actually do have teleport to temple now with spirit stone, but how about teleport OTHER to temple?  Or make it a spell or ability instead of an item?<br />
<br />
-SoW potions/Jboots yeah yeah I can live without this<br />
<br />
-Our DoTs vs undead need MAJOR IMPROVEMENT. I want winged death equivalent for undead. I want splurt vs undead. I want a BIG ASSLOAD improvement of undead DoT damage.<br />
<br />
-Make our pet stay longer than one fight.  Make Xuzl stay too for wizards sake.<br />
<br />
-Self only invis. Give it up, you stingy jerks.<br />
<br />
-Targetable AE vs undead. 4 target max. 500dmg per target for 350 mana or something?<br />
<br />
- Undead only magic resistance debuffer. On the lines of Tashania but vs undead ONLY.<br />
<br />
- Fire based undead only nuke.  Flame Strike in D&amp;D rocked. Call it Purifying Flames.<br />
<br />
<br />
If you implement ALL of these changes, it will provide versatility for clerics (invis/temple ports/petmeleedmg) and increase our soloability (at least vs undead). This, coupled with a raise in melee ability (raise offense and weapon skill to 225 or so from 200/175) will make this change balanced in my eyes.<br />
<br />

PS The DG has terribly unfair moderation in my opinion. The druids there are by and large rude and inconsiderate of others, while the moderators take firm stances against non-druid posters, ignoring their own hostile members.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sherazade</div><div class="date">08-21-2002, 08:01 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Could the 75% mean, that it will heal the main-tank up to 75% unaffected how much HP he has left but with the 2950 cap?<br />
<br />
So if a 5000 HP tank goes down to 2000 - druid heals with his almost CH - it would heal the tank up to 3750 HP  - and if he had 500 HP left he would be healed for 2950 to a health of 3450 (maybe more with HA and focus items)?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Vumra</div><div class="date">08-21-2002, 08:01 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">SWEEET !!!<br />
<br />
 Then NEW CH chain <br />
<br />
   No clerics online (they are all playing alt;s)  <br />
<br />
      6 Druids on a 2 second &quot;CH&quot; rotation<br />
<br />
         4 Shaman (after slow) on  a  4 second &quot;CH&quot; rotation<br />
<br />
=<br />
<br />
  Enough healing to get though most fights.<br />
<br />
  Finally i can Retire my cleric  after all 90% rez from a pally is good enough ?  right :)<br />
 <br />
I really don't mind the spell it's the fact that was as a class have not got'n  1 thing that helps us.  I don't care about ANYTHING they &quot;say&quot; that's been done.  Lower mana on a useless pet AHAHAHAH, changed (not fixed) our nuke lines.  Still can't solo worth beans unless we fight UBER mobs and get UBER drops from them for melee weapons that proc once in a blue moon (unless you have a primal).  <br />
<br />
  I can tell you It will be nice for us clerics when this spell does go live.  Think about it :)  the presure to go on raids  is now GONE !!!  Druids and Shaman can take our places!!  This in and of it's  self  ROCKS.<br />
<br />
  oh if this spell goes live  do NOT expect me to rez anyone that's got a druid or shaman as there main healer.<br />
<br />
  /em wish VI would listen to someone else BESIDES druids</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Raejin</div><div class="date">08-21-2002, 08:16 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Good post Lair Shaani. I echo pretty much everything you said. Why exactly would I want more undead dots? For the whopping 2 undead mobs in the game after Unrest?<br />
<br />
I'd perhaps like to see the old versatility of a cleric returned, perhaps by making the high level spells like Enforced Reverence and The Unspoken Word unresistable (the absurd recast on both spells will make it pretty certain it won't be imbalancing, I'd just actually like to be able to use the spells we're given). I'd also like invis potions to be stackable. Aside from that I just want to be able to heal; it's my job, and I can't understand why our only class-defining ability is being given to multiple other casters (please, let's not insult everyone here and say resurrect, that spell is a curse more than a blessing) who can already do sooo much more than clerics.<br />
<br />
In order to balance it and make it so clerics are still definately the primary healers in the game, they'd need to give us heals akin to a 2000 pt heal with a 4 second cast, or a 5000 pt heal over 24 seconds and so on; ridiculously overpowering spells that would trivialise any encounter designed for complete heal and nature's recovery / torpor, meaning the next expansion is going to require even more absurd mobs to keep up with the exponential power curve of giving every class new abilities.<br />
<br />
I'll wait and see what happens, but implementing a druid / shaman pseudo-CH while at the same time giving clerics a useless pet buff doesn't bode too well.</div></div><hr />

Other than heals and buffs, we bring absolutely nothing to the table in the majority of groups.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kahlia</div><div class="date">08-21-2002, 08:34 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I think the problem here is people failing to see two very different things.<br />
<br />
*Yes, this heal was needed for raids where the clerics are all doing CH rotations and the druids are struggling to keep rampage tanks alive. The benefit of this spell is that the druid has a place in the end game again, and can contribute significantly rather than just prolong the inevitable death of any tank without a cleric behind them.<br />
<br />
*No, this heal was NOT needed for xp groups. The drawback is obviously that the cleric role in xp groups is going to suffer here. I want to see VI's changes to clerics to compensate them for the loss in xp groups.<br />
<br />
<br />
Speaking as someone who has a 60 epic druid and a 60 epic cleric and is in a VT guild, I am both pleased and displeased with the change. Raidwise, it makes perfect sense, and our clerics are still going to be the cornerstone of our raiding force. But Verant cannot let this kind of change go live without addressing some of the issues of the cleric class as well.<br />
<br />
I'd like to see clerics:<br />
*Get the ability to port to other temples. Maybe have something similar to the firepots located in each of the temples - this would still require a faithstone to get to your home temple before porting to one of the others.<br />
<br />
*Increase the range and duration on Epitath of Life. Love that it stacks with Turning of the Unnatural, but you have to practically stand in melee range to stick the stupid thing, and then recast it like 30 secs later, all while clicking your weapon to land Dawnfire every 30 secs as well.<br />
<br />
*Slow or Snare Undead type spell. 50% slow or something of that nature seems pretty appropriate, and does not infringe upon the other slowing classes anymore than the &quot;Druid CH&quot; infringes upon our CH abilities. This would especially be nice for clerics in the upper 40s/lower 50s fighting in lguk who would have to compete with the new &quot;ghetto ch&quot; druids and shamans.<br />
<br />
(Edit: Forgot to add that the level for the ghetto CH is way too early. I grew up as a druid back when SH was the uber heal and was level 53. This spells needs to be level 60, and move NT down to 58)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">PhillGreen</div><div class="date">08-21-2002, 08:38 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">What bothers me about this is that it follows on the heels of the DoT stacking, not to mention the removal of the penalty to DoTs for MOB movement.  So VI improves the ability of shaman and druids to do damage through their DoTs, and gets rid of their 10% healing penalty, fine.  But then they decide that isn't enough?<br />
<br />
Clerics are not, and never have been, as versatile as shaman and druids.  That was the price we paid for being superior healers.  A spell like the one proposed narrows the margin of cleric healing superiority to a point where, in the non-raid context, the only reason you would want a cleric is for a rez.  Shaman and druid buffs alone would actually be preferrable in a grouping context - you probably wouldn't want your tank to have too many hps, as your &quot;ch&quot; spell becomes less efficient.  <br />
<br />
So, if this change were made live, you would have to do something to make a cleric desirable in a group.  The problem is our own lack of versatility.  With Shaman and Druids, VI has just enhanced abilities that they already had.  With Clerics, VI would have to expand our toolset and make fundamental changes to our class.  I don't think one of slow, snare or DoT would balance us.  We would have to get it all, but to a lesser extent.  I like Gallenite, I used to talk to him in game before he went to work to VI, and I think he is a smart guy.  But I don't think it is a good idea to open this can of worms.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Segismundo</div><div class="date">08-21-2002, 08:40 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">@Shaani: your post is nice, but there is an issue... a better heal for clerics wouldnt be enough unless it was a really big upgrade and in that case it would be overpowered. Let me explain: a 3k heal is enough for mostly everything outside raids; given that why take a cleric (that cant provide much beyond heals) instead of a druid (whos versatility can bring many benefits to the group once healing is covered).<br />
<br />
It could be argued that with the superior hp/mana ratio of cleric ch, a cleric would have more spare mana than a druid on the main healing role thus we could offset the druid abilities by using that spare mana nuking. However, considering that most ch's are on the 3k range around both a druid and a cleric will use aproximately same mana healing and truth is a druid can do much more interesting things with his/her mana than a cleric.<br />
<br />
So improving our healing wont get us into groups if these changes go live. Allowing us to cast haste buffs and a general slow (not undead only) would do the trick but that means stepping on too many toes and blurring even more the class diferences.<br />
<br />
It's not that I am against these healing changes. It's that they are gonna create a balance problem.<br />
<br />
@Kahlia: &quot;Slow or Snare Undead type spell. 50% slow or something of that nature seems pretty appropriate, and does not infringe upon the other slowing classes anymore than the &quot;Druid CH&quot; infringes upon our CH abilities&quot; Actually not... the healing changes take effect everywhere. These healing improvements infringe upon clerics the same way a 60% general slow cleric castable would infringe over the slowing classes. Unless VI would put a zone like CT but 100% undead, more undead toys wont do the trick for xp groups.</div></div><hr />

All they are is a luxury.  They do absolutely nothing to help us where we need the help the most (exp grouping and/or solo abilities).  They'd be nice in that they let us get around easier on our own but they do nothing to solve our true problems.<br />
<br />
We need to be able to actually bring something to a group that is lacking and/or we need a way to deal damage to our enemies.  Today healing is secondary to doing damage.  I have no idea how to fix the Cleric at this point honestly...  I wish I did but I'm starting to think it's too late for us.</div></div><hr />

There are some exp areas (howling stones, the hole) that require you to have a porter of some kind to go into/leave.<br />
<br />
Adding that bit of versatility to us, allowing us to bring our friends to our temple with us, will make us able to go to these places in lieu of a druid.  Just as 75% complete heal will allow a druid to go in lieu of us to kill Vindicator.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Zarros</div><div class="date">08-21-2002, 08:59 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Its never too late to fix clerics.  :)  Right now our class is designed around healing, with ancillary abilities in buffing (ac/hp only) and anti-undead nukes/dots.  The problem is that our heals and ac/hp buffs are the best in the game, but increasingly the mudflation of gear improvement and melees with more and more AA is making the best unecessary.<br />
<br />
I've been in xp groups where the only person I healed was the modrodding mage so he could chain-nuke.  I've been in groups where once the shaman left I couldn't keep up with the healing, and before I was there, the shaman was doing fine (via slows and hastes.)  This is only at level 53 mind you, and I imagine the problem is going to get worse as I level and as this syndrome continues game-wide.<br />
<br />
The solution for cleric group desirability is increased utility, and more to do than just heal/buff.  Druids and shamans will be nearly as good at healing as us post-50, while we have none of their added utility.  This will not seriously impact our raid desirability, but may offset &quot;raid guilt&quot; when we can't go or have to leave.<br />
<br />
I kind of like the idea of adding ports to temples, but honestly I don't think its going to help us.  I don't want to be a port-taxi, although I love my faithstone (/em kisses faithstone and hugs it close) for giving me some much-needed improvement in mobility.  I stand by the idea of giving us a controllable pet, after all shamans have one, and even druids get one at 55 (I have no idea how good the druid version is, but the shaman version is decent from what I've seen.)  It would at least give me an option other than root/run/atone when I get aggroed by greenies on my way to someplace nice, or for those times when I cannot find a group.<br />
<br />
A wider range of buffs/debuffs makes some sense too.  It falls in line with priests blessing the faithful and cursing the wicked.<br />
<br />
Some form of mana regen would be nice, a weaker version of the clarity line, and self-only.  Absolutely not stackable with clarity from enchanters, and their version would overwrite ours in this case.  A novel alternative would be do lower the mana cost for our heals and buffs, allowing us to be better healers over the long term, while allowing the other priests to nearly match us for short-bursts.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Saarem</div><div class="date">08-21-2002, 09:05 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Aidon, I even emailed Fox Fire with example of how a druid  where making direct attacks on persons and clerics. The reason for that email was that I made one post saying that I would ban him from any board I moderated when he said that if he came to EQ Clerics so would he been banned for due to beeing a druid and not the bad behaviour he was showing. That was not allowed to be posted because &quot;it was a personal attack&quot;, he was allowed though to call people/clerics morons etc (and no, it was not moderated later sorry to break it to you). <br />
<br />
So no Aidon, the moderators have a pro Druid and have been doing favored moderating to keep non druids out because it dont fit their view. I dont have a problem with editing/banning trolls but it should go both ways. If a druid trolls/goes over the line then he should be taken care of, that is not the case. I am not the only one as you can see that have seen it or been affected by it. Now you can do as you done on the DG about every issue and stick your head in the sand and say anyone who disagree is wrong if you want to, I dont care anymore.

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">JimmyPopAli</div><div class="date">08-21-2002, 09:06 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, I hesitate to ask this question, but I really am curious to know what the general response will be.<br />
<br />
I see alot of posts with clerics saying something like &quot;this is the end for exp groups&quot; or things to that effect.<br />
<br />
The question is:  Why should clerics have exclusive rights to a spot in every exp group?<br />
<br />
The reason I ask is because that seems a little selfish to me.  Maybe I take it for granted, that as a druid, any number of classes can replace me in a group.  Actually, that can safely be said for every other class in EQ in 95% of exp group situations.  The warrior hold on exp grouping was broken long ago and almost any melee class can be main tank now.  Is that a bad thing?  I certianly don't think so, and neither do my hybrid friends/guildmates.<br />
<br />
I guess I just view druid healing as bringing us in line with clerics the same way knight classes were brought up to par with warriors.  It just gives everyone more options and gets groups going alot faster.  If these changes go live, no one will hold a monopoly on healing.  Is that a bad thing?<br />

It also doesnt surprise me that clerics are getting the goofy hammer 'upgrade' (if you can call it that).  I wont be surprised in the least if that is all we get.  Verant has a long track record of giving in to the demands of every class and ignoring clerics.  <br />
<br />
I got so sick of only being wanted on raids so i could have the privledge of spending all my money to buff other people so they could get phat lewt, that I made a druid.  With 5 days played she is already lvl 32.  It is such a relief to see all the rez requests getting shouted and not to feel guilty because I dont want to stop what I am doing to rez every single person who thinks it is their right and due.  <br />
<br />
Playing my cleric is becoming something I do because I feel pressured to do so, not because it is fun.  What is fun about sitting on your butt and hitting the same key every 5 min or so?  I have gotten a lot of reading done, tho.  In fact, I havent even bothered to log on much for the last couple weeks.  I get much more reading done when I dont have to hit the '3' key every 5 minutes.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I also like the posts calling for versatility, sure it would be nice to have some type of slow, haste, debuffs (especially RM *grin*), ports and so on. But it is stepping on other classes' areas, and we are supposed to be as much of specialists in healing as wizards in nuking (or enchanters in tash/cripple/ask for rez heh).<br />
<br />
I woudln't like to have clerics restricted to a single most efficient spell, only in a CH chain, and less appealing than a druid/shammy in 95% of exp groups.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Velisaris</div><div class="date">08-21-2002, 09:17 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, I'm in the &quot;I'll wait and see&quot; camp...with some strong reservations...afterall, we all know that Verant has a history of f'ing things up between the Test and Live servers.<br />
<br />
I've been a supporter of healing improvments for druids/shamans, but not at the cost of the uniqueness and specialization of clerics.  I thought that a 2k heal for a decent cast time, but with inflated mana cost/recast times, would suit the bill nicely...it would still keep druids and shamans in that secondary/back-up healer role but allow them to &quot;make-do&quot; if there wasn't a cleric around.<br />
<br />
But I CAN'T support spells like these, if the stats remain as they are now.<br />
<br />
If those numbers remain and make it to the live servers, then what it boils down to is this: any level 54+ druid/shaman &gt; any cleric in an exp group.  You think clerics in the mid-50s have a hard time now getting exp groups...just wait until something like this goes live.<br />
<br />
If they want to make this spell go live, I hope they either 1) increase the mana cost to 600, 2) move it to level 60, or 3) put a 5 second recast time on it.<br />
<br />
Call me irrational, but never in any form or fashion should a druid/shaman EQUAL the healing abilities of a cleric.  It doesn't make sense from a game mechanics standpoint, nor from a roleplaying standpoint.  These heals, in current form, make a 54+ druid/shaman superior to a cleric in an exp group...hands down.  And in a pinch, a druid CH rotation could be set up for many raids...simply because there's so many of them around to begin with.<br />
<br />
I'm telling you, if these spells make it live in their current form, you're gonna be seeing nothing but this:<br />
<br />
Lvl 55+ cleric enters zone X and in ooc says &quot;Templar looking for group&quot;. <br />
<br />
2 seconds later, a 54 shammy with this new spell enters &quot;54 shammy looking for group&quot; <br />
<br />
Annoying player X shouts &quot;WOOT! Get over here shammy&quot; <br />
<br />
30 minutes pass...&quot;Templar STILL looking for group&quot; <br />
<br />
Annoying player X tells you &quot;Hey bud, can you rez our shammy?&quot;</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Serenya</div><div class="date">08-21-2002, 09:25 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">As an under 50 cleric I have mixed emotions about these spells.   First, I think that druids over 50 NEED something like this, most particularly for raids, and yes, even for exp groups.  3k is even what I thought appropriate and likely.  But, do they really need it at 54?  My 42 cleric has already noticed that the druid in her group can replace her at least 80% of the time, with this at 54 it would go to 100%.  Now, Scooby would rather not be primary healer on a regular basis, and it won't knock Velma out of the standing group anyway, but I'm glad she's not looking for pickup groups, and I'm thinking Serenya may end up retired if her regular group dissolves.<br />
<br />
Fairweather, to answer your question.   No, clerics don't really think they should be in 100% of all experience groups.  But we'd like to be needed in, say 75%.  Bbased on what I'm hearing from those clerics over 50, getting into an experience group is already getting difficult , I'd guess we're needed only half the time.  With this spell, it will become MUCH harder, after all, a typical complete heal is only 3k anyway.  Clerics are designed for groups.  Period.  Full Stop.   If it were you, wouldn't you be freaking out a bit too?</div></div><hr />

The question is:  Why should clerics have exclusive rights to a spot in every exp group?<br />
<br />
That is a fair question Jimmy, and very simply answered. We dont' have exclusive spots in exp groups, esp once Shamen and Druids reach 60. They can heal well enough to keep folks alive and Shammies slows are usually more effective than heals. I know in velks most groups don't sweat not having a cleric as long as they have a slower and someone that can heal reasonably.<br />
<br />
The problem with this equation is not just the heal, but its also the dot stacking and other changes taking place. The only cleric bone I've seen thrown our way is taking our useless &quot;pet&quot; (almost hate to call it one) and make it only slightly less useless.<br />
<br />
Bottom line, by making druids more viable in the raid end game (shammies already had a place, imo), they have made clerics extremely less viable in the exp game. And, unless you have 50+ AA points and are 60 already, you can forget about any ease in getting exp groups when you have 3x the utility in a druid and 5x the utility in a shaman.<br />
<br />
I applaud them helping the druids but they have done so at our expense and I honestly don't see anything VI can do to repair that.</div></div><hr />

<br />
LOL anyways.. I'm not too worried about this. I'm sure I'll be able to survive....<br />
<br />
However, I don't think either class should get this spell at 54. At the very most, a fully buffed tank in my group at this level (just dinged 54) has 4000 hp. Which means your normal cleric CH will be 2500-3500 hp. 75% of this range would be about 1875-2625 hp.<br />
<br />
The fact is... clerics shouldn't be absolutuly necessary for an exp group at any point in the game... same with any class. However, based on the fact that our other exp options are, well, non existant, there should be an advantage to having a cleric in the group. I don't see much advantage when a druid could play primary healer at level 54 plus do all the other things that a druid could do.<br />
<br />
I would prefer if this spell was given to druids and shamans at maybe 58 or 59, and their superior healing spell was made more efficient to hold them over through the mid 50s.</div></div><hr />

BUT... this spell potentially makes us totally replaceable in xp groups.<br />
<br />
And what happens to a groupless cleric? A groupless druid or shaman can run off and solo. Clerics can't.<br />
<br />
Grouping is our only option for xp.<br />
<br />
This new dru/shm spell as it stands now endangers our only xp option... of course a lot of clerics are feeling threatened.</div></div><hr />

Adon, DG has a history of removing posts.  I saw one post there where Foxfyre the Righteous responded to someone's post, they asked if their friend (the one with the leather armor) had to get coldain faction to kindly for him (the druid) to get the MQ armor because his was already high enough.  Fox replied if he didnt want to get his faction (the guy that already has the armor) up to kindly then it was his loss on not getting the armor MQ and the druid should stop coddling him.  Noticing she had the parties confused and who it was that was going to be benifiting from this freebie armor MQ, and pointing this out to her got my thread removed :D</div></div><hr />

I appologize if I made it sound like a direct quote because that was not my intent.  Having the healing spot in an exp group is strongly implied in the majority of posts on this board, and that seems to be the main reason to be against these spells going live.  IE:  Druids and shaman will be picked before or even over a cleric.<br />
<br />
My point is that in EQ today, every postition from tank, healer, crowd control, evaccer, porter, ect. can be fulfilled by a variety of classes.  As a matter of fact, some groups don't require a priest class at all, depending on equipment, AA skills, ect.<br />
<br />
Bringing druids up to a point where our healing is to clerics what a bard's crowd control is to an enchanter, or a Pally is to a Warrior, or Enchater slow is to a shaman's, ect, ect, ect. seems to be much more in line with how things should be.<br />

All clerics can do really is heal (including hp/ac buffing here.)  For any other purpose we are 3rd rate (maybe 2nd rate versus undead.)   To the extent that others can do our level, or nearly our level, of healing, it hurts our ability to find groups.  <br />
<br />
Druids and shamans are capable of soloing much more easily than a cleric can.   And at least have that option when groups are unavailable.  With Zarros I can solo by root-dot-nuke versus undead in places like Traks Teeth with a lot of undead mobs.  However, without a hit of clarity from someone, the downtime is insane.  Druids can quad-kite (for more xp-to-downtime,) and shamans do not have nearly the down-time thanks to cannibalize/heal.  <br />
<br />
I don't mind druids and shamans getting this boost, more power to them I say, but its going to have to come along with comparable boosts in flexibility and group-benefit for clerics for us to remain a good choice for the healer spot compared to a shaman or druid in the higher end.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Raejin</div><div class="date">08-21-2002, 09:52 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">That would be feasible Fairweather, except that clerics can do NOTHING BUT HEAL. Of course we're supposed to be better at it than druids or shamans, since druids get thorns, regen, ports, soe, every other heal clerics have, dots, snare, huge nukes, a resist debuff to go with said nukes, the ability to quad kite blues... while shamans get heals, slows, hastes, huge dots, huge debuffs, regen, sow, the ability to solo Lodizal level mobs... whereas clerics get CH.<br />
<br />
Now druids and shamans are getting CH. Why the hell would anyone want a cleric any more? I'm just glad I'm already 60; this is not a case of wanting to monopolise the healing corner of a group (although we bloody well should be able to anyway, since we can do absolutely nothing else), it's a case of getting into a group at all.<br />
<br />
I'll personally be able to get into guild groups still of course but pretty much only out of pity, or obligation. Not because I'm actually useful. And that sucks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Segismundo</div><div class="date">08-21-2002, 09:56 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">&quot;Bringing druids up to a point where our healing is to clerics what a bard's crowd control is to an enchanter, or a Pally is to a Warrior, or Enchater slow is to a shaman's, ect, ect, ect. seems to be much more in line with how things should be&quot;<br />
<br />
Thats a fallacy. <br />
<br />
You are saying that if druid/shaman and cleric healing is equal, so will be the chances of the three classes to get in groups. Thats not true because clerics barely bring to a group anything but heals where druids/shamans bring to groups a wide variety of beneficial abilities. Thats one of the reasons shaman/druid healing was on hold so much time, because these two classes have their own gimmicks to earn group spots.<br />
<br />
(Btw, warriors now have huge issues finding groups as well because paladins not only tank almost as good as them but also bring additional bonuses to groups (DS/BMB, heals, stuns, root). <br />
<br />
Now on top of these gimmicks they also heal as a cleric. Obviously this makes now druids/shamans top choice for healer spot. And I dont think the amount of druid/shamans on your average server is so low than groups will be forced to look for clerics due to the lack of druids and shamans.<br />
<br />
&quot;Druids and shamans are capable of soloing much more easily than a cleric can. And at least have that option when groups are unavailable&quot;<br />
<br />
Thats an interesting point zarros :) , but what we are mainly discussing now is how will these larger heals impact clerics in regular xp groups. If clerics should be more desirable than druids to groups because druids can solo well its a whole different argument and I am not so sure mixing topics is a good idea.</div></div><hr />

Aren't all these available to one extent or the other in items, potions, and your own undead DoT spell line?  I know that there is a snare item available to DE clerics and snare item in FG.  You having to buy or quest them is no different than any other class that want/needs abilities beyond thier class confinements.  I buy shrink potions and clarity potions because they are ablities I do not possess.<br />
<br />
Anyway, I digress...<br />
<br />
I fully understand the cleric frustrations.  My brother is a 60 cleric and we talk alot about these issues alot.  However, we can all agree that when VI takes a serious look at a paticular class, they do a damn good job.  I feel clerics are due for some nice upgrades themselves.  But then agian, I am indeed more patient then most.<br />

<br />
I do agree that the CH type spell should be moved to around level 59-60, where the raiding druid needs it most.  <br />
<br />
If anything these spells made druids/shamans even more deseriable as bots now to my dismay.  The type of bots melee's use to garner 'solo' exp for themselves with their bot out of group.  Not that it doesn't happen already, heh.<br />
<br />
As a 60 cleric, these heal changes won't make any difference in how I get a group.  I only group with my guildies and whilst I may tag along un-needed in the group to garner them exp we have fun, I'm not worrying about damn, they should have added a shaman instead of me or other stuff.  If all you care about is efficiency your never going to have fun in this game.<br />
<br />
For the clerics between 50-59 I'm not sure what to say, your screwed!  Seriously though, I think about my levels from 50-59 and they were mostly with the same group of people that I had exp'd with.  I rarely did pickup groups.  Are 'friends' that you group with every day, really that hard to make in this stage now?<br />
<br />
I'm not saying that there are not quite a few things I'd like to see for clerics and druids to happen that would make it more fun for them, but sometimes you need to evaluate what fun is about.  I.E - If they chose to add a rogue to this group instead of me they'd be fine and get more exp rather then I'm having fun in this group with people I like and getting to socialize sort of thing.<br />
<br />
I'd love to see a WD type dot for clerics at around level 55 that has no mob type restrictions (none of the necromancer dots do) with their own undead Dot's just making them better then a druid at taking undead sort of thing.<br />
<br />
Some Sermons/Curses would be nice too.<br />
<br />
As for those already jumping ahead before any changes make it live, just wait it out, you can't do anything in one big leap, it's several steps that make it.<br />

DE's comprise one of 6 races that can be a Cleric, so a DE questable snare necklace is not even remotely in the ball park.<br />
<br />
Invis?  ROFL, sure, how many zones do you run through where ITU is actually useful?  Even in the grey where all the mobs are UNdead you use real invis.  So spending 15k or more on a GVD or getting potions as a replacement for a memmable spell is not even remotely in the ball park.<br />
<br />
DoT's on the undead?  Sure, we can now root rot low blues in the Grey.  If someone who is quadding all the golems/snakes doesnt fill the zone with Rockfiends.  Hmmm one zone.  Thanks for the equality!  We appreciate it :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lilarienne</div><div class="date">08-21-2002, 10:09 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Let's see, make a class that is entirely dependant on grouping for experience.  Don't give them any realistic ability to solo, but give them the best ability to heal in the game.  Tell them, you cannot get experience any other way, because you would be too powerful if you could hit hard, control a crowd, damage monsters over time efficiently with magic, damage monsters directly with magic, etc., and heal yourself completely and efficiently.  Tell them over and over, not all classes can solo, this is the way it is meant to be.<br />
<br />
Now give two classes who are capable of soloing very effectively the ability to heal essentially as well as the first class.  Tell the first class, why should you expect to get into a group?  Look at all the other classes who don't always get into a group?  We want them to be able to get a group, so in addition to some very nice heals that they already have that you don't we are giving them a heal that is almost as good as the only one that makes you stand out.  In fact, this upgrade to them is so incredibly good that it essentially takes away your class-defining ability, and makes them not only efficient and effective at soloing, but makes them a much better choice than you for healing in experience groups.<br />
<br />
I recently started a second account, and with no expectation of ever getting my Epic, and the likely prospect that with &quot;improvements&quot; to Druids and Shamans that I won't ever get past 55, I guess I am glad that I at least can use my &quot;Main&quot; (whom I have been playing for 20 months) to power level my second account characters.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Aosinator</div><div class="date">08-21-2002, 10:14 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I've been a cleric since Beta 3 as well, and like a previous poster, I've seen the abilities of my cleric go from being extremely versatile, to being very focused and narrowed.  As soon as I got CH at level 39, everything changed with groups desiring my character.  Even with CH, it took a confident and intelligently played cleric to get the job done.  This all changed slowly, as meleers started to have their HP's increased significantly.  I don't have a problem with that, and don't begrudge meleers for having such a large amount of hps.  It just validated the need of a cleric in any given situation.<br />
<br />
It also let just about anyone play a cleric with minimal challenge.  Have a 5k hp tank?  Just start ching at %50 percent health for 40% health, 10 seconds later, boom you have a fully healed tank.  The whole challenge of mana management, that used to exist, has been somewhat neutered now.  It has become even more prevalent in the high end game, where clerics are put onto a ch rotation, and are basically turned into healing bots.   If anyone remembers the MUD's of yore, and the various front end clients like tintin, that allowed you to setup macros and triggers... that's what we seem to be reduced to at the high end game.  Of course, there is always room for refinement and improvement.  The management of these resources still needs to be intelligently done.<br />
<br />
Perhaps I have a bit of a skewed outlook, since I also have the opportunity to play with other players in higher tier guilds, who also have access to higher tier equipment.  However, having a warrior with 6k+ hps, with a shaman closeby slowing everything, and keeping up their group regen spell, there's almost nothing for me to do.  I MoK and MoR all mobs that come in, nuke mobs when I'm fm (which is damn often), because unused mana, imo, is wasted mana.  Substitute the warrior with a monk that has 4500-5000 hps, wearing a fungi tunic, and with the shaman's regen buff, innate regenation 3 regeneration skill, and you are left in a similar state.  Substitute a paladin with their innate healing spells (I still wish we had something comparable to the healing wave of prexus, that's one gem of a healing spell), and you're killing may be a bit slower, but your need to heal is basically in the same state.  I end up using CE most of the time, because I'm fm and would rather see my mana used for healing that for nuking.  It saves me 100 mana over CH, and will heal my tank enough for the next 5-10 minutes before having to heal again.<br />
<br />
I used to use CE to blunt a large amount of damage being done to a target, so I could get in a divine light, then follow up with a complete heal.  That's not the case anymore.  Most of my time is just spent doing ce and/or ch in a given situation, usually without the lack of any urgency.<br />
<br />
This is why I feel our class has become perhaps a bit stagnant to play.  Most of the challenges that existed from our earlier levels have been removed.  In my heart, I became a cleric, because I wanted to be best at healing.  The best at taking care of my friends.  If you substitute a druid or a shaman with this spell in my place, in the normal situations I just described to you...  you'll really not see much of a difference or a loss.  If anything, you'll see a that the group will be able to dispatch mobs quicker, and thus more efficiently.<br />
<br />
I don't have a problem with other classes getting upgrades.  I don't have a problem with the higher tier game, the equipment, the raids.  I don't have a problem with VI wanting to balance the game and the classes.<br />
<br />
I do have a problem with having my identity blurred.  I'm a cleric, not a druid, not a wizard, not an enchanter, not a shaman.  I don't care about all those additional abilities that seem to be the focus of some.  Yes it would be nice to be able to snare and dot , port to other temples, slow, etc.  however, you are wanting to the same thing as VI.  You are blurring my identity, and as much as I hate to say it, I disagree with my brethren on this point, vehemently so.  You aren't adding to the cleric's identity, you are diluting it.<br />
<br />
The only caveat I would agree to on those type of requests, woudl be in the realm of the undead.  Yes, we should be able to deal with the undead, like a wizard can deal with normal mobs.  We should be able to snare undead, we should have a shaman/necro class dot to drop on undead.  However, in my mind that's where it should stop, in terms of emulating other classes.  However, lets be honest... there's not a lot of undead content on the higher tier game to deal with... that is worth the time, except for perhaps the ring of fire (which is a raid class encounter).<br />
<br />
<br />
Perhaps they can improve our buffs.  Add haste to Aegolism, similar to what paladins get, except make it stackable with everything.  There's still a haste hard haste cap, so it's not like we will be abusing the system.  While you're at it, add in truesight to Aegolism, or perhaps only to the Blessing of Aegolism spell.  I'm from the old school of DnD players, and truesight was something clerics were often granted as an ability, if not, at the very least, the spell.  Seperate the mana regen ability of the Blessed Armor of the Risen, from the druids Protection of the Glades (and everything else it currently stacks with and may stack with).  BAotR should stack with ALL mana regen abilities/spells in my opinion, because I view it as a gift bestowed upon me by my deity.  Why would someone else be able to impinge on that?<br />
<br />
We need more spells like MoK and MoR.  Those 2 spells are by far the most &quot;different&quot; spells from our magical arsenals.  Perhaps allow us to have a Mark type spell, that will make it harder for the mob to cast spells, based on some percentage.  Call it Mark of Divinity, which is basically Divine Interference on the mob, which will cost us a good deal of mana, but will basically call on our deities to interfere with the mob.  Give us Mark of Stripping, which will strip the mob of all buffs, and prevent any buffs from taking on it, while the spell is up.<br />
<br />
There are many things of this vein, that will add back in flexibility for our class, and challenge... more importantly, without the need to further dilute our identity, or anyone else's for that matter.<br />

They way I see it, as mention earlier, is that Clerics are about to become more than specialized in Healing.  This is a way to keep the other classes from bitching pretty much.  If that's so ,it's a very good change for you guys.  Clerics will never be replaced in exp groups due to the Rez Ability heh.  Velks isn't the only zone in the game you know.  I'd like to see someone take an exp group deep into Chardok, CT, Ssra, ect w/o a Cleric no matter how well Shammies, Druids heal.  Clerics have always had trouble in the small group area, hopefully this will be addressed.  Also, they really need to buff up your guys pet if you want it to be useful.  My 58 SK pet does tons more damage than the Cleric one does and that's not saying much.  You guys should have a pet in line with the final Enchanter pet, and a stun proc for good measure ;p</div></div><hr />

<br />
What if they added a peridot component to the CHs? Then it would be rarely used in exp groups (where I don't think they needed the big heal help) but *would* be used in raids where they do need a big heal?<br />
<br />
Bane spells, for instance, use peridots.<br />
<br />
Just a thought, what do you guys think?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Qhue</div><div class="date">08-21-2002, 10:35 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Complete Heal is a headache.  No possible massive upgrade to a cleric's ability to do ANYTHING is allowed right now because Complete Heal is monumentally overpowered.   That one single spell ruined the game of Everquest and if Verant is at all smart no such spell will exist in EQ2.<br />
<br />
Spreading this ability out among the three priest classes to a degree unshackles clerics from the spell that has dominated their lives for nearly 3 years!<br />
<br />
How many raiding clerics have felt miserable when they learn that thier 40+ person guild had to cancel a raid because even though they had 3 of every other class in the game in attendance they didnt have the 7-8 clerics they needed to kill some big mob?<br />
<br />
How many clerics sigh inwardly in exp groups because they'd like to pop out the Blackstar and melee it up a little but dare not stop medding for fear that they will miss a CH?<br />
<br />
How many times have clerics gone to a Fan Faire and asked for more interesting Priestly abilities only to get laughed at because CHeal exists and makes them overly powerful?<br />
<br />
<br />
Worried about a place in an exp group?  Then explore the depths of your spell book as it already exists.  Keep both Mark's memmed and ready to use.  Have that Root loaded and ready to crowd control.  Load those stuns and chain stun mobs instead of snare...it also stops the mobs from beating down the tank alot better than slow.<br />
<br />
Try soloing in a way that is suitable for a cleric, not a wizard.   Wizards root and nuke because they are fragile and have big damage nukes.   Clerics have armor, HPs, Heals.... Find mobs that a cleric (hellooo plate class!) can tank reasonably well, pull out that mace, load them stuns, pop out a hammer-pet (it casts fast now and is cheap as hell!) and beat the bastard into the ground.  Paladins solo in FG not because they do huge damage with their swords...they do so because they chain stun the shrooms so they dont get hurt as much and then heal up afterwards!<br />
<br />
Cheal should NOT be the only thing a cleric brings to the table.  Creative use of existing abilities can already open up new doors for clerics and with some decent slow-casting high efficiency heals farmed out to Druids and Shaman that opens the door for more innovation in the Cleric repertoir!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Cosmos7777</div><div class="date">08-21-2002, 10:35 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I have been a cleric since the beginning.  I've been level 60 for nearly a year.  These past three years I've watched every druid demand for better healing/nuking/whatever granted to them.  The changes ALWAYS go live from test, the disclaimer means nothing.  <br />
<br />
I've watched as Verant fiddled a bit with clerics, but by no means did they give the cleric class anything on par with what they heap upon druids.  I suppose, until now, they assumed clerics held a well defined role.  That's about to change.<br />
<br />
I am a little surprised that they haven't given druids a manaburn AA skill yet.  Probably that will come later.  Best to spread out these huge boosts to the druid class.<br />
<br />
Do I expect Verant to give the clerics anything to help preserve class balance?  No.  They might fiddle a bit with existing spells, but I seriously doubt clerics will see a major upgrade.  Make no mistake, this partial CH for druids is a major upgrade.<br />
<br />
It's about over for clerics.  I just wish they'd held off with this druid giveaway till City of Heroes came out.  I will hang around a little while longer to see if clerics get anything substantial.  If not, I will join the Great Cleric Exodus from EQ that has already left behind so many &quot;bots&quot;.<br />
<br />
Frankly, folks, if the cleric CH cannot be used in Planes of Power, and the druid partial CH can...well, do the math.</div></div><hr />

But listen for a second...<br />
<br />
Do you hear that?<br />
<br />
That is the sound of Absor not having anything to say to us. it's the sound of the devs not doing anything to help clerics. it's the sound of druids and shamen rejoicing that they can now heal as well as the &quot;greedy overpowered&quot; clerics. I don't see any druids demanding an offensive increase to clerics so we can solo. I mean, people wouldn't want druids if clerics could cast normal DoTs or nuke as well as a druid, would they? :rolleyes:<br />
<br />
VI can now delete the cleric class without any consequences. Just bug paladins for your 90% res. Maybe VI will give them the 96% res instead when people howl about that 10 minutes the lose from getting that 6% back.<br />
<br />
This is the third straight upgrade we got NOTHING. Well, I take that back. Bonkya, the suicidal pet, now costs less to summon. Same 100 HP tho. Can you say useless? I knew you could...<br />
<br />
Absor said he doesn't understand why we think VI hates us. Well, here it is, buddy boy. It's typical of everything that has happened to us since EQ opened. Everyone else gets a major upgrade and we get thrown a bone to appease us. It just so happens this renders us useless in exp groups meaning you now have 0 reason to have a cleric in your group outside a raid. It's called par for the course.<br />
<br />
Now if you'll excuse me I just about have this cricket chirping deciphered I think... wait, they're saying something... w-e-s-h-o-u-l-d-m-a-k-e-s-o-m-e-d-r-u-i-d-t-w-i-n-k-s-n-o-w<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Amris</div><div class="date">08-21-2002, 10:43 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Why should clerics have exclusive rights to a spot in every exp group? <br />
<br />
Sorry, I skipped ahead.  I just HAD to answer this, if it's been answered already, my apologies.<br />
<br />
First.  We don't want exclusive rights.  We want to be needed, TOO, and a BIT more AS A HEALER than the other two classes.  For several reasons.  First off, clerics can't solo.  If we can't get a group, WHAT ARE WE GONNA DO?  Go solo?  No.  If a druid or shaman can't find a group, they can solo, while continuing to shout that they're LFG.<br />
<br />
Secondly, take an HONEST look at clerics.  What else can we do?  Are we going to be brought in as a slower?  For our snares or DS?  Oh, I know, we can stun, of course, it's much better to have a pally for that, or better yet, tell the warrior to just bash, already.  All we offer is healing, oh, and buffs that cost us massive amounts of cash, and which will LOWER the effectiveness of these new heals.  I know, bring us in because we can evac the group if needed.  Oops, never mind.  Ooo, uber stat buffs!  Oh, no, that's not clerics.  Oh, yeah, DS!  Wait, MOK only lands once in a blue moon, and then only does 15 points.  Oh, oh, the uber new pet!  WOOOTAGE!  OMG, we have SUCH AN UBER PET NOW, flee druids and shamans, fear the mighty hammer!  Yeah, right.  There's a good reason to invite the CLERIC.<br />
<br />
However, they've always said they're not giving us anything because we have the almighty Complete Heal.  So now, they give that away (rarely does CH do more than 2kish in an exp grind group, unless you're purposely pushing to see how low you can let the tank go, at level 54). <br />
<br />
So, now that they've made druids and shamans equal to clerics in healing with these spells, tell me what they've done to make us <br />
<br />
<br />
EQUALLY VALUABLE <br />
<br />
please.<br />
<br />
Nothing.  Upgrading our pet was a meaningless gesture done in hopes that when this became public, clerics wouldn't panic.<br />
<br />
<br />
We don't want ALL the spots in exp groups.  We just don't want to be LESS VALUABLE than druids and shamans.  We want to be chosen for groups on AT LEAST an equal basis.  Because grouping is our ONLY ALTERNATIVE, by DESIGN, and deliberate intent from Verant.  &quot;you have CH, you get NOTHING ELSE, because it makes you a MUST HAVE.&quot;  Okay, now that we're no longer a MUST HAVE, we're to become a &quot;don't want&quot; that has no other options available.<br />
<br />
If you think that's fair, and you think that's okay, then you've got a problem.  We got the nerf bat constantly because of CH, now they're giving the larger part of THAT away.<br />
<br />
<br />
And, if they do decide to give us something, what will it be?  Here, be a druid with Rez!  No, become a shaman/druid hybrid with Rez and a little better heal!  YAY, that's why I played a cleric,  Thanks!  Ooo, wait, we'll make you a healing wizard, cause the poor druids are upset about you getting snare.  Ooo, just a second, the wizzies are mad, here, have a slow.  ACK, the shamans won't tolerate that, here, have a pet that's 2% more useful than before.  *pat pat on the clerics' heads*  Good cleric, run along and CH something now, we have more important matters to attend to.  Oh, nothing to CH because you're unwanted now?  Hmmm.  Didn't we just give you a WONDERFUL pet?  Now, SHUT UP AND GO AWAY.<br />
<br />
With this move, I am upset.  Prior to this, I felt clerics were fairly balanced, because we could get groups most of the time (though already, at 54, I watch many groups take shamans and druids over clerics for their diversity and sow), and druids and shamans could solo while LFG.<br />
<br />
Now, if this goes live, we have neither.  We become significantly LESS WANTED in groups, while still being unable to solo.<br />
<br />
However, I begin to wonder if that's not the point.  More bot clerics for Rez!  More accounts purchased!  Yay!  No one plays clerics as mains anymore, they're all bots.... oh, darn, that means lots of people bought extra accounts.<br />
<br />
And what sickens me is that druids still complain it doesn't heal enough. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
I don't want to be a druid or a shaman, if I did, I would BE ONE.  I want to be the best healer in the game, hands down, wanted for that.  I want to cast heals that make people say, &quot;Wow, nice heal.&quot;  If I wanted to snare or slow, I'd be another class.  When people talk about what classes can solo, cleric is ALWAYS bottom of the list.<br />
<br />
Actually, I have a great idea.  Do away with it all.  Make 3 classes.  Priests, melees, and casters.  Give priests all the heals, all the slows, all the buffs.  Give melees nothing, what do melees need, pfft, they take the hits, that's enough.  Give casters nukes, pets, and mezes.   TA DA!  All balanced, aren't we.  And make sure everyone can solo, please.  We don't like grouping, that's why we play Everquest, a massively MULTIPLAYER game.<br />
<br />
<br />
I don't WANT to solo, I don't WANT to slow, I don't WANT to have to compete with paladins, necros, and SKs for the 4 level appropriate undead in all of Everquest that we can currently ALMOST, sorta-kinda come close to soloing.  I played a GROUP ORIENTED class BY CHOICE.  Do you understand that?  Druids play a class FAMOUS for being SOLOABLE.  BY CHOICE.  Shamans play a class that's FAMOUS for slows.   BY CHOICE.  I play a class that NEEDS groups and is NEEDED BY groups.  BY CHOICE.<br />
<br />
But by god, if you're taking the one away from me, GIVE ME THE OTHER.  If you're giving away the need for clerics in groups, make me able to solo.  And watch me gouge druids for rezes, just like they ALREADY gouge me for ports.<br />
<br />
But on the bright side, since it'll be rare to see any clerics at the high end game, because we can't level without groups, at least the shamans and druids that will exist in overabundance will be able to take our place on raids.  Instead of 8 clerics, 16 druids will do.  And they'll be available, because they can group OR solo.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />

Frankly, I would be disappointed if we were to get those abilities.  I didn't make a cleric to be able to do any of that; I made a cleric to heal.  If I wanted to port, kite or solo, I would have made a druid.  <br />
<br />
Anyway, here's a sobering quote from Rich Waters a while back...<br />
<br />
http://eq.crgaming.com/viewarticle.asp?Article=4309<br />
<br />
<br />
If a particular class is lacking in some critical area, than it makes sense to do something to address that class and not all of the others. <br />
<br />
There will certainly be parts of class balancing that change the relative power of one class when compared to another. Class balancing happens because a given class is underpowered or overpowered when compared to where we feel they should be. This obviously will change relative power as we improve a weaker class and leave the others where they should be. <br />
<br />
Also, class balance isn't always dictated by comparing different classes. A large part of getting the balance right is looking at a class individually<br />
<br />
<br />
It seems like I've read a few  quotes from VI stating that Clerics and Warriors are the &quot;standard&quot; classes - we're as powerful as they want us to get but they'll adjust the other classes in comparison.  Apparently they don't think Druids and Shamans heal well enough.  I just wish they would have decided that before so many of us made clerics to fill in the gaps in exp groups and raids - and then found out we really enjoy the class.</div></div><hr />

Well, I kind of thought this might happen eventually. I knew the druids weren't satisfied with what they got last time. <br />
<br />
I read most of this thread but I did skim some of it, so I'm probably not saying anything new here. I just have to say something, because this is..  just crap. <br />
<br />
<br />
Giving clerics better nukes or utility spells just furthers the idiocy, in my opinion.  Oh joy, I have better utility spells, now I can be a crappy version of a druid. Oh boy, i have better nukes, now I can be a second rate wizard. <br />
<br />
**OH BOY, I HAVE A NEW PET, NOW I CAN BE A CRAPPY MAGE**<br />

But.. but.. I don't want a lame 2k heal !!! All I want is a group shrink spell,  spirit of the wolf for my wolf puppy and maybe some new fun potion ....<br />
<br />
As a level 60 shaman, I only see one situation I would use that spell.. Healing the MT against mob that does a lot of damage fast (ie unslowable). And usually, against those mobs I m busy using my mana to something else : <br />
torporing my group for cleric<br />
buffing the dead tank, giving him a tap on the back and sending him in the battle<br />
debuffing the mob  <br />
healing the group while the cleric is busy keeping MT alive etc..<br />
<br />
Also, I don't see why I would have a 10 sec heal memed.. 10 sec is long.<br />
If someone in my xp group need a 10 sec heal, then a 5 sec cast torpor and a couple of 3.5 chloroblast to be sure that Torpor will heal that person enough will do the same.<br />
Also, are you using CH to heal a chanter that is getting pounded ? nope, you are using a fast heal hehe.<br />
I don't have enough spell gem to keep that so situational spell up all the time.<br />
<br />
I hope you guys will get nice stuff tho. I think you really need improvement to make your class more fun to play... not that sitting and casting a CH is not fun.. but.. you know what I mean.</div></div><hr />

The information on Lucy has the spell listed with a base fizzle, if we can use that information with any reliability, that's the same as Complete Heal at 39 or the druid spell Breath of Ro at 52.  <br />
<br />
Think back on how much CH fizzled for you at 39, and remember that you were probably alteration specialized, and that you've had many more skill points in alteration gained since then.  Breath of Ro fizzles like mad all the way to level 60 for druids who aren't evoc specialized--at 52 you don't have many more evoc points or alter points to gain, so there's not much correction as you level up.  Based on the information posted, I would guess that the same will be true of this spell for druids who are not alteration specialized.  While clerics and shaman are pretty much universally alteration specialized, the same is definitely not true of druids.  <br />
<br />
Some druids will be able to use this spell to great effect.  Others will have issues.  All will be less reliable in a CH rotation than clerics, though perhaps the raid won't have to be cancelled if you're one or two clerics short.  The main raid use I see here is better mopping up of AoE and rampage damage.<br />

Clerics dont porcupine well as you seem to suggest - we lack a large DS for that really. We just dont do damage fast enough.<br />
<br />
Stuns - are practically useless. Too much mana for too little gain. We are not really worried about the tank getting hit - CH cures that for cheap compared to what little we would gain from (chain) stunning.<br />
<br />
MoK/MoR - in most exp groups mobs die too fast for these to have any value at all. Its just plain better to CE/CH and nuke in most cases.<br />
<br />
Root - is good to park. Many classes can do that though.</div></div><hr />

There have been times that we've cancelled raids because of lack of clerics.  If this change goes in, that won't happen anymore.  AND, we will probably have the resources to try new targets.  That makes me a happy cleric.  A good change for my guild is a good change for me.  :)<br />

<br />
Umm, healing aggro is capped and you heared of this spell called root / snare? Both works wonder in avoiding getting hit by that potential healing aggro. And druids are easy reaching 1k+ ac now as a sidenote with same hp as a cleric. So no, dont pull some aggro will kill them please.<br />
<br />
Heared of a bot cleric/paladin/necro for ressing? Or how about a friendly cleric/necro/paladin in your guild? Or simply cave in and buy a ress staff, they are recharable after all. Or are you the kind of person who goes around with a necro in every group because you might whipe deep down a dungeon? That idea would work for oh two nano sec or so...<br />
<br />
And you really need to be either low level or simply not noticed alot if you say it dont change anything. Druids and shamans are today healing in CT, the dungeon everyone love to point at when they say cleric healing is needed. This it today, now, with current healing spells. Add in the new onces and do the math of how much easier it would become to do the same healing AND have the extra utility they bring on top of it.</div></div><hr />

Are 'friends' that you group with every day, really that hard to make in this stage now?<br />
<br />
<br />
Yes actually it is. When you can't add to the damage output, you slow everyone down. NOBODY like to level and nobody likes to get exp for AA abilities. Sure grouping with friends and guildmates might be fun, but really it just masks the monotony of what you are doing. I was turned down by groups and even friends on may occasions because I would slow things down. I wouldn't just sit there and do nothing, I would melee and nuke when i could. I used a poison wind censor which for a cleric does a tonne of damage, and i STILL slowed things down to the point where someone soloing gained more exp without me than with me.<br />
<br />
The whole point to everyone's complaining here is that we were already nigh-useless in experience groups. Everyone will tell you to go to these really hard zones where clerics shine, but it goes right back to what i said, NOBODY likes to get exp. It is boring and monotonous and the faster and easier and more efficient you can do that the better. No one will go to those zones on a regular basis because they are too hard to get to, require too much extra work for not a whole lot of extra gain, and you risk a far more dangerous environment. So people are better off going to velks or seb or mushroom grove where it is safe and constant experience. And by giving druids and shaman this added healing ability without first giving clerics something to up their damage output, you just made exp groups for clerics non-existant aside from pity groups.<br />
<br />
I think it's awsome that druids are going to get more healing ability, it's something they've needed for awhile now. However we have been saying we needed more versatility for longer and no one has listened. Well now druids got their heals and what do we get? and don't give me this garbage about our nukes being upgraded or the pet being more useful because it's not useful enough to balance out the ability druids and shaman just got. The cleric changes should have been done first. Now everyone will be shit outa luck for the next few months waiting for the supposed changes that are coming our way and will just end up being true south or another summoned hammer.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Aladain</div><div class="date">08-21-2002, 12:30 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Since Sept 1999, here is EVERYTHING - positive or negative that has effected a cleric specifically (spell/item/abilitywise).<br />
<br />
Isn't it amazing how little &quot;positive&quot; things have gone in for clerics?<br />
<br />
<br />
LEGEND:<br />
<br />
- means it is a minor negative change<br />
+ means it is a minor positive change<br />
~ means its neutral or a bug fix<br />
(NERF!) means it is a SERIOUS change that effects Clerics more than any other class - VERY MUCH effecting us<br />
(POSITIVE!) means it is a SERIOUS change that effects Clerics more than any other class - VERY MUCH effecting us<br />
<br />
Sept 28 1999:<br />
<br />
- Corpses that are older than 3 hours can no longer be resurrected. <br />
- Corpses that are produced from a duel cannot be resurrected after 10 minutes. <br />
<br />
Sept 22 1999:<br />
<br />
+ Casting times on the higher level Ward series (Cleric, Magician, Necromancer &amp; Druid) have been slightly lowered. <br />
<br />
Oct 28 1999:<br />
<br />
+ Invoke Fear (Necromancer, Enchanter, SK, and Cleric) has both had it's casting time and mana cost reduced. <br />
<br />
Feb 17 2000:<br />
<br />
+ &quot;Yaulp&quot; and &quot;Augmentation&quot; should now stack. <br />
+ Class-Specific armor quests, especially those belonging to Clerics, Paladins, and Shadowknights, have been reduced in terms of how long it will take the average person to acquire the armor. These classes, and others that found particular pieces of their armor exceedingly difficult to obtain should find it much easier now. <br />
<br />
Mar 29 2000:<br />
<br />
~ Corrected a bug with some of the Resurrection spells that caused them to return too little experience.<br />
<br />
Jun 15 2000:<br />
<br />
+ Lord Grimrot should be seen more frequently.<br />
<br />
Jun 29 2000:<br />
<br />
~ Corrected an error in the drop rate for a couple cleric spells making them unavailable.<br />
~ Fixed the effect on the &quot;Theurgist Mace&quot;. Current owners of this item will need to trade it out with a GM in game.<br />
+ Stone Skeletons in Lake Rathe can now be affected by &quot;undead only&quot; spells. <br />
<br />
Jul 19 2000:<br />
<br />
+ The resurrection confirmation box will now report the name of the person casting the spell as well as what spell they are casting. Furthermore, experience will not be &quot;removed&quot; from your corpse until you accept the resurrection by choosing YES.<br />
<br />
Aug 9 2000:<br />
<br />
+ The spells &quot;United Resolve&quot; and &quot;Heroic Bond&quot; had their levels transposed accidentally. Rather than putting them back as intended, United Resolve has been changed to Heroic Bond, which means you might have two copies of that spell in your spellbook. Feel free to move one to the back. Clerics get a new group spell at 58 to compensate. <br />
~ Repaired a bug that kept the Unswerving Hammer of Faith and Flaming Sword of Xuzl from disappearing. <br />
<br />
Sept 19 2000:<br />
<br />
+ We are pleased to announce that we have implemented new &quot;Fiery Avenger&quot; style quests for every class in the game (including paladins). <br />
+ Celestial Elixir was failing due to multi-tick cure components that are incompatible with that configuration. We have therefore removed the cure components and increased the healing provided by this spell. <br />
(NERF!) After a great deal of consideration, we have concluded that the Mark of Karn spell is imbalanced and requires correction. This spell's current function makes melee classes without dual-wield far less desirable members of the group. As such, the spell has had its duration decreased, its recast-time increased, and its &quot;heal per hit&quot; value decreased.  <br />
<br />
Nov 15 2000:<br />
<br />
+ The Death Pact and Divine Intervention spells will now stack appropriately with other spells that have similar effects. <br />
<br />
Dec 19 2000:<br />
<br />
(NERF!) High-end items that have a activatable (right-click) healing effect have in several cases had their casting times increased. <br />
- The stamina reduction with &quot;Resurrection Effects&quot; has been replaced by a slight attack-speed debuff. <br />
<br />
Jan 17 2001:<br />
<br />
~ Last week's patch attempted to fix Celestial Elixir, Celestial Healing, and Torpor, so that they would stack another similar spell, unintentionally causing it to stop stacking with standard regeneration spells. This has been fixed. The downside to this fix is that these spells will now overwrite the 'Call of Bones' series. As the three former spells are cast to save a character's life, this solution appears to be the most beneficial for all of those involved. <br />
<br />
Feb 21 2001: (The First healing upgrade for SHM/DRU, Donals Nerf, Hate AI change)<br />
<br />
+ Casting difficulty of Superior Heal reduced (less fizzles)<br />
+ Created a new spell effect for Celestial Healing, Celestial Elixir, and Torpor. This will allow them to stack with all other spells, save spells of the same type (Heal over time). Prior to this, all heal-over-time spells followed the same rules as regeneration spells.<br />
+ Reduced the casting difficulty of Remedy. <br />
+ Naked PC corpses that have experience and are above level 30 will now last 3 hours instead of 3 minutes. <br />
~ Raised the pre and post 50 bind wounds cap for paladins, clerics, druids, and shaman. <br />
(NERF!) Donal's Breastplate can now only be used on any individual target once every 7.5 minutes. This addresses some of the balance issues that became apparent given the existence of a mana-free complete heal. <br />
- We've made a number of changes to NPC AI, specifically to the section dealing with target-selection, or what's commonly referred to as &quot;Hate&quot;. <br />
<br />
Mar 6 2001: <br />
<br />
~ Fixed a bug that disallowed casting of the Donal's Breatplate on others once casted upon yourself. <br />
(NERF!) The casting time for four cleric breastplates sporting the 'Celestial Healing' effect has been increased to one minute. We understand that this severely limits the use of that effect and we are currently discussing alternate effects to place on those items in the next patch. We did, however, need to address the 300pt per tick regen that could be placed and kept on the group tank. When we've decided on the new affect, it will be applied to those items retroactively.  <br />
+ The maximum amount of 'hate' that an NPC can add when witnessing a heal to targets above level 50 has been decreased substantially.<br />
<br />
Mar 14 2001: (Note MoK change neutral because they nerfed it and then they realized they over-nerfed and had to fix.  That isnt a positive change)<br />
<br />
~ The spell, Mark of Karn, has been enhanced to heal more per hit. <br />
- The effect on the Celestial Elixir Breastplates has been changed to the enhanced Mark of Karn. The casting time on these items has also been changed to 9 seconds. <br />
<br />
May 8 2001:<br />
<br />
(POSITIVE!) Divine Aura and spells of that type (Divine Aura - cleric, Divine Barrier - cleric, Kazumi's Note of Preservation - bard, Harmshield - necromancer, Quivering Veil of Xarn - necromancer) will now prevent the caster from being stunned when hit for their duration. <br />
<br />
June 27 2001:<br />
<br />
- NPCs are now much more aware of the vulnerability (or, more precisely, the invulnerability) of their targets. NPCs will now be very unlikely to waste their time attacking a target that they can't harm. <br />
+ Spell and Item Interruption: Ducking will now interrupt a spell instantly<br />
<br />
Oct 8 2001:<br />
<br />
+ The level-based spell resistance bonus inherent in super-high level NPCs has been reduced significantly. <br />
+ Several NPCs have had their resistances reduced.<br />
+ NPCs that were highly magic resistant in order to make them immune to certain spells can now be given specific immunity to those spells.<br />
<br />
Nov 7 2001:<br />
<br />
~ Donal's Chestplate of Mourning has unlimited charges again. You will likewise need to exchange yours should you get an 'out of charges' message when attempting to use it.<br />
+ Added /targetgroupbuff<br />
<br />
Dec 4 2001: <br />
<br />
+ Increased the amount of mana given by high Intelligence and Wisdom scores, as well as that granted by items and spells. <br />
<br />
Jan 8 2002:<br />
<br />
~ Mark of Retribution should work as intended<br />
<br />
Jan 14 2002:<br />
<br />
+ Clerics, wizards, and druids can buff their own pets/familiars again<br />
<br />
Jan 23 2002:<br />
<br />
(NERF!) Ragefire portion of the Cleric Epic quest has been changed. <br />
+ Shades in Umbral, Maiden's Eye and Vex Thall are now considered undead <br />
<br />
Feb 13 2002:<br />
<br />
+ Made some small improvements to Marzin's Mark <br />
<br />
Mar 19 2002:<br />
<br />
(POSITIVE!) New resurrection, evacuate and corpse summoning spells have been added at lower levels <br />
+ Judgement has been improved to make it a better upgrade from the previous spell in the spell line <br />
<br />
May 8 2002:<br />
<br />
~ Issues with Healing seeming to be delayed have been fixed (see Spell Filters) <br />
<br />
May 9 2002:<br />
<br />
- Tavee's shoulders effect has been changed to specifically exclude affecting the duration of the Donal's Chestplate timer effect <br />
<br />
June 5 2002:<br />
<br />
+ The effect from Hammer of the Sun (Dawncall) now has a longer range <br />
<br />
June 12 2002:<br />
<br />
~ Resurrection timers have been fixed, they count down as normal <br />
<br />
Aug 14 2002:<br />
<br />
+ Priests and intelligence casters now have the Combat Stability and Natural Durability Alternate Advancement abilities in their Archetype</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
We are only good for 3 things. 96% rez, Aego, and Cheal.<br />
<br />
I know. Im an end-game player. Thats really all I do. I tried to MoK a mob in tov last night :) heh so lame.<br />
<br />
I think I wil just retire my cleric if I ever get edged out of an xp group in favor of a drood cause of this new CH spell. use him as a rez whore and make some cash. Or just quit alltogether.<br />
<br />
clerics are gona fall by the wayside in end-game to aego and rez. I guess we can still ch-chain, but for anything else we are not needed. (this sound like a necro in end-game??) Im not gonna beat a dead horse anymore.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">MorinkhanMT</div><div class="date">08-21-2002, 12:46 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I don't think a lot of the clerics here begrudge the new spell given to dru/shms, assuming it goes live. Personally, I think it's great for them.<br />
<br />
I think the main fears expressed here are concerning the MAJOR cleric upgrades that would be needed to balance these new changes. Without significant changes, this new spell could potentially kill the cleric class in xp groups.<br />
<br />
Also to consider... traditionally, clerics have been almost obsessively overlooked by VI when it comes to class upgrades... which explains why so many here are worried.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Treage_Shadowbane</div><div class="date">08-21-2002, 12:57 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">What if they added a peridot component to the CHs? Then it would be rarely used in exp groups (where I don't think they needed the big heal help) but *would* be used in raids where they do need a big heal?  <br />
<br />
This wouldn't be a bad idea. Limiting when it is used, and letting the druids see what its like having to buy components all the time. Not having to spend plat to play is one of the things I like about playing my druid. Well, I guess you could count batwings but they are relatively cheap. He's only 52 so doesn't have SoE yet.<br />
<br />
The thing I agree with is that we all need to wait and see what happens. There is no sense getting worked up about it until after they say that balancing is over</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Amris</div><div class="date">08-21-2002, 01:02 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I think he/she meant the druid and shaman heals to require a peridot, not ours.  Not 100% positive, though... :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Vinta</div><div class="date">08-21-2002, 01:08 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I think it's too early to /panic about this just yet, although it's tempting to jump into the hysteria right now.<br />
<br />
I imagine they are trying these changes with the intention of giving druids (and shamans) a different or perhaps more valuable role in raids.  I don't think clerics will be edged out of raids with a partial Complete Heal being given to other classes! But I suspect this would change their non-raid roles as well, and that possibility that clerics won't be needed anymore in exp groups is a source of anxiety for me.<br />
<br />
I am not really a raiding cleric; at this point I play to make my exp bar go up. Due to my schedule I do a lot of pick up groups.  (And my Complete Heals are rarely over 2500 HP.)  Even now there've been occasions where I'm LFG, and the only tells I get are to rez the non-cleric-primary-healer a group chose because they wanted a healer with more utility than a cleric.  <br />
<br />
My concern is this:<br />
<br />
If someone other than a cleric could Heal 2500 HP at once, plus keep the group SoWed, snare mobs, DoT mobs, blast mobs, and whisk the group to safety in zone or out of zone . . . <br />
<br />
Why would anyone EVER want a cleric for an exp group?  <br />
<br />
Actually, why would anyone want to play a cleric if they could, as another class, Heal that well, ensuring them a place in every group and every raid, as well as solo and travel well?  <br />
<br />
I guess I would feel a lot less anxious if this partial non-cleric Complete Heal (and only the non-cleric version) required an expensive reagent, thus limiting its use in regular exp groups.  <br />
<br />
When I want to heal well, I play a cleric.<br />
When I want to solo well, I play a druid or a necromancer.<br />
When I want to take hits well, I play a warrior.<br />
<br />
I don't expect to solo well when I'm playing a cleric, nor do I expect to heal well when I'm playing a druid or necromancer, nor do I expect to 'port or summon pets when I'm playing a warrior.   <br />
<br />
When I realized that the abilities of one class I played didn't include something that I wanted, I started a character that could do what I wanted.  I didn't expect Verant to change the class just because I wanted to do something else with the character I was currently playing.  <br />
<br />
This whole thing doesn't strike me as Class Balancing.  It strikes me as Class Homogenizing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Megumi</div><div class="date">08-21-2002, 01:17 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">We need Verant to add a few new, end game undead zones.<br />

<br />
I can't imagine that this spell going live would ever lead to a replacement of clerics. No one is going to want to give up 96% rezes, and even 75% heal won't overcome the many healing tools that clerics have.<br />
<br />
As for clerics needing upgrading &lt;BOGGLE&gt;<br />
<br />
No offense to the cleric players out there, but having clerics complain about being not versatile enough is insane. I can understand that they might like a few more utility spells, like an invis that works on things other than undead, but please - when you are a member of one of the top two or three demanded classes, it just galls me to hear complaining about your abilities. <br />

Here is a hint druids, you cant have the pie and eat it.

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mameluke</div><div class="date">08-21-2002, 01:53 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I find news of this new &quot;Complete Heal&quot; very disturbing.<br />
Druids and shamans were already able to be main healer in some places since the penalty was removed.<br />
Now they get somethign that will simply kill us in xp groups.<br />
<br />
Hmm a 3K heal is good enough when combined with regen and a slow maybe on the mob for that druid or shaman to replace us in an xp grp. Replace us yes well let's see<br />
<br />
Druid<br />
<br />
-Can now heal good enough to replace us in an xp grp<br />
-Can port/evac<br />
-SOW<br />
-Thorns<br />
-Wolf form for atk bonus (not that important i don't see it done much)<br />
<br />
Shaman<br />
<br />
-Slows on mob means less healing<br />
-Massive Melle buffs<br />
-HASTE<br />
-SOW<br />
-Torpor was an amazing heal already now they get a new heal to go along with it.<br />
<br />
Great why do u NEED to have a cleric in your everyday group?<br />
oh yeah that's right 96% rez. Well pallies get 90% and it's pretty darn close the difference is not HUGE.<br />
<br />
The saddest part of all this is that i can't see what they can possibly give us that would help us. We already have complete healing, Heals over time, best hp and ac buffs in game.<br />
And no i do not need a brand new undead only nuke or stun i got enough our forte was healing so ppl were willign to overlook the sow and buffs and other stuff because of that now they do not need to i hope to brell this spell never goes live. If it does i am gonna make a shaman. As far as i am concerned they can hold a camp as main healer with no problem add aaxp to crit heal and increase amount healed and u are as good as a cleric in a grp.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sorethumb</div><div class="date">08-21-2002, 01:55 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Reading over those druid and shaman posts someone posted I am absolutely shocked to see some of them (especially druids) don't see this as an upgrade. It is a huge boon to their classes. Hooray for them.<br />
<br />
However, where does this leave us. CH is our biggest trick. It is why were are the best healers. I'm not buying the druid rhetoric that this really only heals 50% because there are tanks with 6k running around out there. MOST 50-60 tanks don't have that many HP. I don't care about uber guild tanks. MOST 50-60 xp zone tanks will effectively get a cleric CH when this lands on them at 20% like my heals do.<br />
<br />
For shamans the heal is only 2k but that doesn't really matter after slowing. It's still a very nice upgrade to a class that's already treated &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; cleric.<br />
<br />
If verant does indeed give these gifts to druid and shamans to answer their three year old pleas, we mist get some class defining skills of theirs. Otherwise the desirability of clerics is going to be knocked way down. We are already treated as a joke in many high level XP zones.<br />
<br />
Perhaps a 30% slow OR 30% haste (pious fervor) spell to balance the shamans. <br />
<br />
Perhaps invis or snare to balance the druids.<br />
<br />
This game has a large established population of clerics. Clerics that unlike these other two classes can't solo effectively. PLEASE verant don't do anything that would dissrupt the balance on a wide scale and leave lots of clerics groupless. It's not fair after all the time people have invested.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
<br />
seriously though, I have thought for a long time the CH has been a bane to our class. I say let them go live with this. Remove CH, and give this spell to clerics along with a Regen spell, and a mid range damage shield of some type (I dunno, rename Holy aura and make it an 8 point DS)<br />
<br />
Snare - nope , don't need it. <br />
<br />
What I would like (of course I play a dwarf) is the ability to melee somewhat (not on par with any melee type class, but definately better than we currently do ; I know that would not unbalance anything if they uncapped cleric melee skills/damage and upped dodge.<br />
<br />
invis, just make it so the damn invis potions can be stackable. I don't mind using a potion, I just cant stand wasting all the bag slots.<br />
<br />
ports  - who cares ; Its already easier to get around than a year ago ; With luclin, you can use the ports if you dont pay for a druid or wizzie port and get to where you need fast enough. <br />
<br />
Pet spell upgrade - bah...Give clerics a line of weapon procs like Call of sky (but clerical based ; perhaps a stun, or a debuff of some type and get rid of the pet)</div></div><hr />

<br />
My first character I ever rolled up was a druid. I soon quit him because I couldn't heal as well. It's when I found out that my true calling was a cleric (because that's what was frustrating me the most). Granted this was early on in Kunark when druids had a hard time playing back up healers at best. <br />
<br />
I love my cleric. But it does get old to play a one trick pony. Not that I mind all the time because on big raiding fights, it's fun. Yes call me sadistic shmuck. Thing is, I'm a cleric. A cleric to me is supreme healer. Hands down. I don't want that to change. <br />
<br />
What I would like to see are the following: <br />
<br />
* Invisability spell<br />
If druids and shaman (who already have this ability) are going to be more viable healers, I would like to see some give and take. We have been denied this in the past because it was said that it would prove to be unbalancing. Horseradish! If they can give Invis vs. Undead to wizards we should be able to get a fixed duration invis spell as well. <br />
<br />
* An upgrade to a cleric heal <br />
<br />
Don't know how they would work this but maybe along the lines of the healing line and keep the ratio of Divine Light but add casting time to it?<br />
<br />
We shall see.</div></div><hr />

Hp and AC and Mana regen<br />

The need for clerics has been marginalized already, this is the nail in the exp group coffin.<br />

<br />
Unless the tank's hitpoints are over 4000, druid CH is every single bit as effective as ours. Even further, how often does a CH hit when the tank is less than 20% hitpoints, honestly? Not very damn often.That means that unless tank has over 5000 hitpoints, the new druid spell and the cleric's CH are EQUAL. <br />
<br />
The more I think about this, the less I like it :(</div></div><hr />

You never start a cheal at 0, you always start it around 2 bubs of health. That is effectively a 75 percent heal.<br />

I only can remember that Clerics could need some nice updates but how verant says??? :<br />
<br />
Cleric: Why Clerics dont have self invis ? <br />
Verant: Because Cleric have CH and is overpowerd <br />
Cleric: Why Clerics dont have better nukes ? <br />
Verant: Because Cleric have CH and is overpowerd <br />
Cleric: Why Clerics Pets is useless ? <br />
Verant: Because Cleric have CH and is overpowerd <br />
Cleric: Why Clerics dont have any solo abilities ? <br />
Verant: Because Cleric have CH and is overpowerd <br />
Cleric: Why Clerics only one Epic is alowed at week ? <br />
Verant: Because Cleric have CH and Epic is overpowerd too <br />
Cleric: How should Clerics make Exp if Druid and Shamy get CH ? <br />
Verant: get over it. <br />
<br />
/rude Verant<br />
<br />
<br />
So if one Day Verant really give em a Heal that does more then 5k HP - they kill the Clerics!<br />
<br />
Looks Druids and Shaman have the best Begging Skill.<br />

<br />
On a 4k warrior, they'd have to drop to 100hp when the heal lands to reach 2925hp.  If they were healed at 1k hp, they would be healed 2250hp.  If they were healed at 2k hp, they would be healed 1500hp.<br />
<br />
If it will work with IH3/HA3, it's monstrous.  I'd kill for a heal like that with a shorter casting time or less mana.  As others said, the routine CH rotation rarely heals more than 3k.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ollamh</div><div class="date">08-21-2002, 03:13 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok, I have read almost all the threads on this topic and would like to offer a bit of a different perspective. First of all, my main is a ranger, although I have a 25ish level cleric and have many cleric friends, I dont for a second pretend to understand what life is like a the higher levels for a cleric. So my comments are coming from one someone that doesnt play a cleric as a main and how these changes could effect me...<br />
<br />
The point that I want to make is you aren't the first (nor the last) class that will &quot;share&quot; his/her class defining ability with another class. For example monks share fd with sks, rangers share tracking with bards and druids, chanters share mez/mana regen with necros and bards, etc. Clerics will always be the &quot;best&quot; healers, but they will no longer be the &quot;only show in town&quot; if this goes live. Please dont say that you can get by with a current shammy/druid as healers if you are trying to camp CT, DN or any zone that might get the blood flowing. Not everyone likes to sit in FG and kill shrooms for hours, or velks for mind numbing spiders, but with no cleric... do other classes really have a choice?! With this change, no cleric wont mean &quot;no go&quot; anymore... which is why I welcome it.<br />
<br />
So coming from someone's main that is out tanked by warriors sk and pally's... out damaged by rogues, wizards, and monks... shares his &quot;best&quot; ability with 2 other classes... you will still find groups!<br />
<br />
Now that said... i think that clerics are due for some major upgrades. The game has changed alot in the past couple of years... to the point that 3 and 4 man groups are more desirable than the standard 6 man group... and that 4 man group isn't chanter warrior cleric rog anymore. From a non-cleric perspective, upgrades that I would like to see is a version of DA that is castable on others... 20 seconds where they cant be hurt by melee attacks... with a 20 min refresh or somthing. I would also like to see a self only clarity for higher level clerics, that could stack with the chanter line. Add more mid level quest items that offer different effects like snare, slow, and maybe even a pet so it becomes an options for the clerics that want to solo. Finally, a total rehash of 5 or 6 zones to be about the level of CT with insane xp bonus's and usable high level gear. Push the game back to the 6 man group again, and get the soloers off the shrooms and spiders. The key is make it &quot;group&quot; only (all mobs summon, some cant be slowed, some cant be mezzed, some see thru FD, etc)... soloers need not apply and make the gear rare BUT &quot;nice&quot; stuff even by uber guild standards. Anyway that is my 2cp...</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'm sorry, but Druids and Shaman have ALREADY STATED they can keep up healing in CT, and DN.<br />
<br />
Its just they are not as efficient as if you had a cleric.  Thats the case with Bard vs. Enchanter, in other words, the way it should be.<br />

<br />
&quot;The point that I want to make is you aren't the first (nor the last) class that will &quot;share&quot; his/her class defining ability with another class&quot;<br />
<br />
Yeah but all these classes have something else to offer besides their definining ability. SKs can FD but monks got really nice dmg output, enchanters share mez with bards/necros but enchanter wide range of spells makes them a powerhouse for any group etc etc. Its not about ch being a shared definining skill, its about ch being mostly everything clerics bring to a group. I know there are few exceptions (like aoe groups) but for the most part thats it. Any specialist class that shines in one area gets weakened each time more diversed classes get close to them in their speciality... check warriors vs paladin/sk, rogues vs monks, clerics vs druid/shaman.<br />
<br />
Having options = good <br />
No brainers = bad<br />
<br />
Taking druids and shamans over clerics will be a no brainer (heck it is already for certains zones).<br />
<br />
Anyways everything has been said already, we just missing a much needed official word about whats in store for clerics.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Like Segismundo, I'd like to add another note to this. Those classes knew they were going to be sharing their skills 2/3 years ago. If they didn't like it, they could chose not to play the class from the start.<br />
<br />
When I created a cleric I knew all I could really ever hope to do was be a healer. I knew I was gonig to sacrifice any hope at soloing for being bound to groups forever. This was how the class was defined. I could have chosen a druid or shaman from the start if I wanted something different.<br />
<br />
After 3 years, it's too late to reduce the 14 or so classes in EQ down to 4 or 5 even if they now realize there aren't enough niches to go around.<br />
<br />
If the heals go through approved there must be some reciprocity.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">dusklar</div><div class="date">08-21-2002, 04:56 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well... once again the &quot;fix&quot; to every complaint that Verant has received is to make all of us just a bit more alike.. Long time clerics, myself included, knew that when we started our characters that we were going to be group dependent.. heck even the eq manual said clerics are one of the most important types to have in a normal group.  (not exact but I remember reading something like that three years ago).    IMO this next wave of healing upgrades for druids and shaman is good for them.. not good for clerics.. Everyone that truly started a cleric, as many of you have posted previously, understood our classes limitations, and OUR STRONG SUIT.. I knew when I formed my cleric that I would suck at soloing. .that I would be welcomed in groups, and that I would be the best at basically one thing.. healing.   NOT SOLOING, NOT NUKING, NOT MELEEING, NOT BUFFING, NOT EVACING, NOT DOTTING, NOT CROWD CONTROLLING.  It isn't that we can't do some portion of some  these things to a degree, but we aren't really even close to the experts that handle those skills.   The problem with the additional healing power to the druids and shammies isn't the fact that they won't be more valuable on the raid end, but that CLERICS  won't be as effective in the group situation, and I for one don't care about soloing.   I didnt invest three years at being an expert (if I may say so) in keeping peeps alive to all of a sudden after 60 levels and 45 AA's for Verant to make my cleric a poor mans mage or necro via a minor hammer upgrade.  <br />
<br />
Take a breath...That isn't to say that we won't get some kind of upgrade beyond the hammer thing, who knows.  I for one however am concerned that looking for a group will even become more difficult, and that clerics are slowly being &quot;boxed&quot; out of the game via these kind of enhancements.  As the game continues to go on, more and more of the classes share similar skills and abilities.. further homogenizing us all.. I have been a long time nay sayer to these kind of changes, and I do honestly believe that EQ was alot more fun back in the &quot;old&quot; days.... My first 20 levels 3 years ago presented me with some of the most challenging and fun times that I have ever had in the game.. <br />
<br />
One more comment, and I don't recall the poster, but I read that it is frustrating for raids to be cancelled due to lack of clerics.. it is even MORE frustrating to be level 60 and not able to gain experience or even play because clerics can't find a group.  Even as things are now.. with the heals that shammies and druids have available to them.. they can fill in for clerics in many of the experience grind camps.  Inversely, how many of us can go out and quad kite wyverns in Cobalt Scar, or solo effectively with a pet in fungus grove, and how many of us really want to?</div></div><hr />

Quite a difference from what you get on other boards.  The shamen, too, have a very well thought out thread on their board.   Now, to my main point.  In doing this, Verant may actually solve two problems with this.   First, it may get the druids off their backs.    Maybe.....  for a little while .....  until they start looking at the ranger melee skills.  Second, this may finally take care of the Rage bottleneck.   Think about that for a bit.   8p</div></div><hr />

Verant better give you guys some good upgrades for this.  I think it is kind of sick that the 90% loser soloing gimp druid is going to be close to clerics on healing and superior to shamans.<br />

I looked around in the XP zones ... <br />
<br />
And there were cleric bots in all of them, waiting patiently afk, or camped out completely.<br />
<br />
And there were the live clerics, and every single one of them over level 50 was LFG.<br />
<br />
The soloing zones had no druids in them, and the wizards and mages rejoiced.  Even CT, the once haven of the cleric LFG ... Had a druid and shaman pair and went on their merry way.<br />

So then I logged, took a nap.  Asked myself if I cared ... Sure, I am sad that I put so much time into this.

<br />
I can't stand raiding, it's simply too boring for me with no rewards, so I only exp for the most part.<br />
<br />
What I don't understand is, why would someone pick a cleric (hp buffs, cheal, rez, ivu) over a druid (hp buffs, cheal, dots, nukes, evacs, ports, dmg shields, sow, str buffs, mana regen with potg. invis) for an exp group?<br />
<br />
If I were a group leader, I would, in all honesty, pick a druid now.<br />
<br />
dot, nukes, evacs, ports, dmg shield, sow, str, potg, invis &gt; rez, ivu<br />

The reason this hurts as much as it does it that now druids are superior to clerics in exp groups - but clerics can't solo. Which leaves me... where, exactly? Like I mentioned before I hate raiding...<br />

The only thing that I'd recommend doing at this point is holding off before letting panic set in. <br />
<br />
*IF* these changes were to go live, please don't think that there wouldn't be a significant upgrade for Clerics going right alongside them. <br />
<br />
Something that would enhance their desirability in exp groups, give them a little diversity, and maybe even something that would make people value the idea of more than one Cleric in an exp group. <br />
<br />
He's not much for patting himself on the back, but as a guy who used to play a Cleric quite a bit, I'd be pretty thrilled to get some of the changes Jahaar and others have been considering. <br />
<br />
Please have a little patience and hold off on passing judgment. <br />

We asked the same thing of the Necros while working on DoT stacking and other issues, and it may be a stretch to try to ask the same here when emotions are obviously running high. <br />

Please have a little patience and hold off on passing judgment.<br />

We asked the same thing of the Necros while working on DoT stacking and other issues, and it may be a stretch to try to ask the same here when emotions are obviously running high.<br />

But, if you could: Please, do try to have a little faith. <br />

To VI:<br />
<br />
I can see your viewpoint, but cmon - don't announce a change that has such a huge impact on a class, then leave that class hanging in the wind with zero information about what's going to happen.<br />
<br />
Not saying what you have on the board for clerics only serves to foster the panic and anger that you tell us not to have.<br />

We all saw it. <br />

However, if they HAD an idea for balancing clerics, they would have tossed it out on test AT THE SAME TIME as the 75% heals. <br />
<br />
The way they did it shows that they have no clue what to do for clerics. They tossed the druid and shamen the raid heal, sat back, and said let's see how they react, if it's calm, roll it live and say &quot;you're balanced.&quot;</div></div><hr />

Shamans have Torpor.  Shamans weren't asking for the partial CH and it's not as good as what they already have (Even with Torpor's drawbacks).  The dev team was thinking of DRUIDS when they made this spell.  Shamans were just added as an ill-considered afterthought.<br />

In a group without cleric AC/HP buff , with the mobs who deal the same amount of dmg, good luck guys . You really need to have C3 now on because these 400 mana &quot;CH sham/druid&quot;  are going to be used very often.

We are pretty much the same class we were when kunark was released.  <br />
<br />
Got my donals bp,  was nerfed 2 weeks later,  I didn't really complain (it was overpowered but wouldn't be today).  Velious came out,  clerics were heavy in demand,  melee got more powerfull,  seemed all was well.  Luclin came out,  AA abilities introduced.  Melee got alot more powerfull,  most high levels not needing a cleric for exp and brag about sick exp while I sit lfg,  or gimped in some lower level group getting exp best suited for a cleric in purple planar armor in the lower to mid 50's.  Sadly I don't have a 2nd box,  so I am left to stay lfg,  or solo.<br />
<br />
Our AA abilities just suck,  spell casting mastery is nice,  but that's about it.  We have ae buff,  decreases raid downtime,  well thats nice until half my guilds clerics have it,  now I don't really need/want it.  Doesn't add to our power at all,  just decreases downtime.  Bestow divine aura is decent,  not something that really increases our power/desirability for a group though.  Healing gift/adept.  You mean I can ch for over 21k!  sick!  definitely unbalancing,  anyways...<br />
<br />
Verent vows for &quot;caster balancing&quot;.  I wait patiently losing interest in my class a little bit more every day .  Focus items introduced!  Sadly they don't effect our only spell that seperates us from the shamans/druids.  Complete Heal isn't effected by spell haste 3/ mana pres 3.  Our nukes are a little more efficient with improved damage 3,  but do I even care about that?  No.  Epitaph of life isn't effected by extended affliction 3. Group aego not effected by extended buff 3.  Where are we being balanced?  <br />
<br />
Now they are thinking of giving the other priests our lifeblood (CH),  not so much shamans as druids.  Any cleric knows you don't usually ch for more than 75%.  I usually start ch's at 40% health on warriors,  I play it safe,  my guess is druids will go the same route,  that means unless the tank type is under 25% health the spell will be a ch.  UNLESS he has over 5khp.  Thats likely to happen,  alot.  Still,  druids will be able to replace clerics in places like ssra/CT where previously they were our only real strongholds for exp left for us.  I feel really sorry for the low to mid 50 level clerics,  I don't know how they are going to make it in this post luclin era if this spell goes live.<br />
<br />
They see us in a bit of on uproar and make some quick changes on the test.   Ethereal Elixir,  group CE for 1050 mana,  this is a joke right?  lets see  group ce,  or group ch,  gee thats a toughy especially since group ch takes 50 more mana,  cause I might need that 50 mana to cast DB.  It might have a few situational uses but overall,  its trash.<br />
<br />
Ethereal Light,  1600 heal for 525 mana with a 5 second cast time.  Might be good with spell haste 3 on an enchanter with some AA's,  definitely not gonna keep it memorized,  another spell to take a spell slot.  Not gonna make us anymore powerfull or make us more tempting to someone making an exp group.<br />
<br />
Yaulp 5.  Interesting,  gain 15 mana by casting,  gonna be a goof off spell,  if it doesn't stack with BaotR its trash.  I guess its like our pet,  a little toy to play with when your not being a ch bot whore on a MA.  No more power,  doesn't offer anything to a group.  <br />
<br />
Hammer of judgement,  this thing better proc judgement,  cause I have a dawnfire and a hammer of the sun,  and about 5 other weapons I own, hoped might make my solo exp go a little faster.  (get a hammer of the sun if you can,  and learn to root/rot,  its decent exp,  but it isn't available to most clerics)<br />
<br />
These spells won't make us any more powerfull,  won't get us groups,  won't get us exp.  I don't need to be a better raider,  I need to be able to offer something to an exp group.  If verent gives druids ch,  I am seriously gonna consider selling off everything ive got,  getting a fungi and making a monk or just quitting outright.  Its sad,  because ive put over 190 days on my cleric.  To see my character being reduced to a mindless ch hotkey macro junkey makes me sick.  The thought of a druid with ch makes me sick.  The thought of empty promises and the ever frightening nerf bat makes me sick.</div></div><hr />

It is effectively a ch unless the tank has over 5k.  Please read the entire post before you respond.  Not to mention,  improved healing 3,  and healing gift/adept can make this spell on average land for 4k.   <br />

The point that I want to make is you aren't the first (nor the last) class that will &quot;share&quot; his/her class defining ability with another class. For example monks share fd with sks, rangers share tracking with bards and druids, chanters share mez/mana regen with necros and bards, etc. Clerics will always be the &quot;best&quot; healers, but they will no longer be the &quot;only show in town&quot; if this goes live. Please dont say that you can get by with a current shammy/druid as healers if you are trying to camp CT, DN or any zone that might get the blood flowing. Not everyone likes to sit in FG and kill shrooms for hours, or velks for mind numbing spiders, but with no cleric... do other classes really have a choice?! With this change, no cleric wont mean &quot;no go&quot; anymore... which is why I welcome it.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
You guys need to understand something. Clerics do not need to be told that there are things that can't be done without them. We know that. However, the focus of the Cleric class is very narrow. You can solve the problem of ever NEEDING Clerics by vastly improving the healing ability of other classes but now you've got another problem on your hands. You have a class that for years has been balanced around a single spell who's uniqueness has just taken a huge hit. If nothing else changes about the Cleric class, it's not enough that they remain the &quot;best&quot; healers. They need to remain MUCH better healers than anyone else because it's the only role they can fill.</div></div><hr />

You said you would quit in effect if this change goes live, and I responded because it seems the EQ Live team is not exactly done with improvements for clerics, so it's possible there's more to this than druids and shamans just taking away a role, isn't there? <br />
<br />
In raid situations having such a heal is good for specific groups, but it doesn't replace clerics, does it?<br />
<br />
For xp groups it does seem problematic right now, but you don't know what else there is coming that will make clerics more rounded for xp grouping. I'm curious about this development as well since I have a lower-level cleric that is stuck in a rut. Believe me, I am seeing both sides of the coin here. :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">YesIAmADruid</div><div class="date">08-21-2002, 11:33 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">It is hard to even collect my thoughts on this topic with so many varied and very loudly voiced opionions.<br />
<br />
The major problem that clerics seem to be expressing that is somewhat viable is that suddenly now they will be unwanted/unuseful in an XP group.  Now, god forbid, they will have another class that might fill their spot in a group.<br />
<br />
Reality check!  If a group wants a tank they take a warrior OR shadowknight OR paladin.  If they want damage they take a monk OR rogue OR mage OR wizard.  If they need slow they take a shaman OR an enchanter.  If they need a healer, they get a cleric.  Why, oh why, is a cleric supposed to have the righteous role of being the only class able to fill a necessary spot in a group?  Druid and shaman are supposed to be on that list too.  They are at lower levels.<br />
<br />
Also, you complain over relative power.  I checked randomly one level 54 and one level 60 warrior, how many HPs they currently had.  2500 and 3900 respectively.  75% of those is 1875 and 2925.  So basically until level 60, this doesn't heal for the efficency that complete heal does.  Neither do druids (or shamans much that I know) have the wide variety of quick casting or very efficient over time heal spells available to use when a complete heal wouldn't be the right thing.<br />
<br />
And class defining ability?  You clerics say you want something back because we got your &quot;class defining&quot; abillity?  Another reality check, no class has a defining ability, everything is shared.  (Again because no one class is supposed to totally monopolize a role.)  And hellOOOOO you just got us druid's near &quot;class defining&quot; ability of ports, or did nobody buy those faithstones?</div></div><hr />

&gt; eh, its the ABILITY to do it I was commenting on.....&lt;<br />
<br />
When was the last time you saw a cleric able to solo much at all?<br />
<br />
When a class that is so hindered in its ability to do anything alone, and who is so reliant on groups and being needed in groups has one of its 3 group roles diluted (and its most powerful group role) then it will just result in even less clerics being played. <br />
<br />
Ask yourself *why* you have to cancel raids because no clerics are on....or why those clerics are playing alts...thats a far more important question.<br />
<br />
Maybe we need to start bitching at VI as much as the druids do, so they will give in and start giving us more and more abilites we were never meant to have.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You should *read* the posts before saying a statement like that.<br />
<br />
We have that role, because it is the ONLY role we can have. <br />
<br />
We have no real ability to solo. Take away the role of group healer, and we have no role other than CH rotations on high end raids...<br />
<br />
Compare Cleric and Druid:<br />
<br />
Cleric : AC/HP Buff, CH, Rez<br />
<br />
Druid: AC Buffs, Heals, Damage Shields, Str Buffs, SoW, Invis, Snare, Root that holds, Teleports to about 20 locations.<br />
<br />
And you want to ADD better healing to druids? How selflish.<br />
<br />
I wont mention shamans because most of them dont want a better heal, and see the damage it could cause.<br />
<br />
You say we got Faithstones? What the hell good are they really? What is in Kaladim that i need? Smithing components - thats it. What else is around Kaladim I need. Nothing. OH Whoo whooo whoo what a BOON that is. <br />
<br />
Druids have TONS of things that are great abilities that clerics dont have. They should be content with what they have, not make another class pretty much reduced to 1 defning ability</div></div><hr />

I believe that would be called gating, and OMG, WOW, other classes besides druids do that.  NERF THE OTHER CLASSES, they can gate!<br />
<br />
NONE of your arguments hold water.  Clerics don't share anything with anybody except HEALING and Rezes.  And rezes are only needed if you screw up.  That's what we do, we heal.  WE DO HAVE A CLASS DEFINING ABILITY.  Even Verant admits it, yet you deny it.  I'm glad that makes you feel better, but pull the head out of the.. uh, sand, fellow.

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Corish-MT</div><div class="date">08-22-2002, 12:00 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, here's my take on it (and this is pretty much what I e-mailed to sony's feedback address).<br />
<br />
The details on the healing spells on test are level 54 (Druids, 75% or 2950 max, 10 sec, 400 mana - Shaman 75% or 1950 max, 10 sec, 400 mana).<br />
<br />
However, unless VI fixes the current experience system, the most efficient experience group is one that slows the mobs to reduce damage taken, hastes the melees to increase damage per second (again, reducing damage taken), while hunting a steady stream of low-end dark blues that probably knock no more then one bubble of health off of the MA.<br />
<br />
As a cleric, unless I resort to inefficient nuking, I bring nothing to the table in terms of increasing the damage per second of the group. The only damage I do is by keeping the melees alive (which is WAY more mana efficient then nuking). As a result, an experience grind group is better off with a shaman in order to haste/slow and adding another melee to put the mobs down fast enough that the shaman is able to keep up with healing.<br />
<br />
I've spent a lot of time in Jaggedpine darkpaw gnoll caves the last few weeks, usually grouped with a 55 shaman and 4 melee. Frankly, once we fight our way to the named cave, I may as well grab a book or take a nap because I'll be hard pressed to go below 70 percent mana unless I'm rebuffing. Between the mobs being slowed and the melees being hasted, nobody is taking anywhere near enough damage to warrant using CHeal (in fact, I will only cast my jasper symbol on the MA because the peridot symbol isn't worth using).<br />
<br />
The average tank at level 55 has about 3500-4000 HP, this means that the druid version of this healing spell easily replaces a cleric's CH, with zero downside or penalty (same mana, same time).<br />
<br />
Looking at the complete spell lineup of heals for druids, shaman, clerics (excluding CH and heal over time spells).  There are a few &quot;holes&quot; or inconsistencies that I see.  (It is my opinion that even without CH, a cleric should be able to heal 1.5x to 2x better then a shaman or druid for the same amount of mana.  Just like a rogue puts out more damage then a warrior.)  So here are some suggestions:<br />
<br />
1) Chloroblast is essentially a cleric's Remedy, and druids only get it 4 levels later for the same mana cost.  This means that clerics do not have the edge on this spell at all.  However, as a cleric, I'm happy that my druids have Chloro for a fast heal on the enchanter.  But in the name of balance, I think Remedy should have it's mana reduced for clerics down to 100-130 mana instead of 175 (this would make clerics about 50% more efficient using this spell then druids).<br />
<br />
2) Superior Healing for druids and shaman should be lowered from level 51 to level 39/44.  Also, now that the healing penalty is removed, cleric's should see their mana cost reduced on SHeal to 200m instead of 250m.<br />
<br />
3) Divine Light - 900 hp for 350 mana with a 4.5 second cast is iffy.  If mana costs on DL are reduced down to 200-250 mana, it makes clerics more efficient, leaving room to add a druid heal of 1000 hp for 350 mana around level 51.<br />
<br />
4) Reduce the proposed CH spell to 1600-2000 hp for 500-600 mana, and increase the cast time to 15 seconds.  This still gives druids/shaman a very effective heal, with great mana ratio - but with the increased cast time means that it's not as preferred as a cleric's CH.  Give it to the druids at level 53/54.<br />
<br />
5) Increase Nature's Touch to be a 1600 HP heal instead of 978 HP heal for 400 mana.  Lower the cast time to 4.5 seconds to compete with the new druid CH at level 53/54.<br />
<br />
6) Add a level 56 cleric heal that heals 1500-1800 HP for a mana cost of around 300-350 and takes 4.5 seconds to cast (an upgrade to Divine Light).<br />
<br />
Again, druids/shaman should heal 1.5-3.0 hp per mana, while clerics should heal at least 33% more hp/mana (preferably 50-75% more, min of 2.5 max of 5.0).  Keeping in mind that the faster mobs die, the less healing is required (shaman slow/haste, druid's nukes/DS/regen all help the mobs die faster requiring less healing).<br />
<br />
Needless to say, I'm extremely against the new spells as they exist on the Test Server.</div></div><hr />

<br />
For us clerics, we have been upsetted for such a long time that it is unbelievable that VI is going to give us something really useful. You druids keep saying to us that VI will do something and continue with this balancing. I do hope so and RATIONALLY/REASONABLY, one should think so. However VI haven't been RATIONAL/REASONABLE to us clerics for these years, and up to now, nothing has been done/hinted except POTENTIAL upgrade to our 1 HP pet.<br />
<br />
So beside telling us to &quot;Keep our faith up&quot;/&quot;Believe in Scott/VI&quot;, which most clerics feel impartial to, what else you guys/ladies can give us as some assurance?<br />
<br />
I do agree Druids need help in raid situation, but is there other way that won't undermined the cleric class?<br />
<br />
I think what make me and most clerics frustrated, but wasn't mentioned so far are:<br />
<br />
1. Time - I think most people having certain lvl knowledge of EQ would agree that GENERALLY lvling a Druid is faster/(arguably easier) than a cleric. Clerics have been in these past years waiting for groups while couldn't go solo; has to spend time to respond to rezzes, sometimes walking thro a few zones, must attend raids because raids would go off if clerics don't attend. I am not going to elaborate more here.<br />
<br />
Many Clerics only have time to play one main class, many people don't have time to play and level up a high level alternate. Will they regret now that they had chosen Cleric as their main back from 3 years ago? How many clerics will feel frustated because they can't gain exp faster enough to cover the loss of raid deaths? If they are given choice, how many will pick up Druid rather than Cleric now? How many will quit because of frustration?<br />
<br />
Time - how can VI compensate for the players' time they spent for the past years?<br />
<br />
2. Effect on Clerics which haven't reached 60 or potential clerics - they are the more affected players I would say. No doubt many more new players will choose to play Druid now, while the 54 - 58 clerics who do not have CE (59 lvl), who are still struggling thro their exp'ing (I am not talking about the PLers who can PL a lvl 60 within a week, I refer to the general, maybe causal players), will find their already diffcult situation aggravated. <br />
<br />
Someone raise 96 % rez as a reason that cleric will still be more preferable in groups. -  You don't need a cleric to be in group to get 56 rez, you can find LFG cleric for rez.<br />
<br />
Someone raise the point that your friends will welcome you in their group even you may slow them down. - So we now put into consideration social relation in real life into our class balancing issue in EQ? humm then lots more needs to be considered ........<br />
<br />
We can wait and see, but their is a chance that many clerics will start twinks/alternate because of the persepctive of the cleric class in the future.<br />

<br />
Druids really do need something to make them more needed/wanted on raids/endgame.  That is a fact I don't think anyone would dispute.  I just hope Verant thinks of something that doesn't make me completely useless at the same time.  <br />
<br />
I won't start an alt.  I play a cleric because I want to be a healer.  I can't think of any other class I really want to play.  I don't want pity groups.

<br />
As a guild leader and a raid leader, of course I'd cheer to see this. Getting enough clerics to do raids is an obstacle that every guild faces often.<br />
<br />
In every other context however, this looks like a disaster in the making. If this goes through the only way a cleric will be able to get xp is through AE groups... and you can only fit one good AE group into OS (the only really good place to AE) at a time.<br />
<br />
Making this into a cleric-druid issue is totally missing the point. If this goes through, the cleric is now obsolete - not because of the druid, but because of the shaman. 75% slow + a half CH = 2x as efficient as CH alone. Add that to the wide variety of offensive and utility abilities of the shaman, compared to absolutely nothing for the cleric, the player that enjoys the cleric class to play and not simply to bot for raids is left high and dry.<br />
<br />
As things stand now, clerics are already in very low demand for groups outside of the new CT. Shamans are already the favored priest for every other xp situation, especially among the highest level players. Clerics are the only class that cannot solo for AA - even warriors and rogues can solo for AA if they have fungi tunics or invigorate BPs. There's no item out there than can change the equation for a cleric.<br />
<br />
Now that I've got a few thoughts down, it occurs to me that as a guild and raid leader, this isn't looking like such a good change after all. Where am I going to get the extra clerics I need if no one can level up a cleric anymore?<br />
<br />
Would I object to a druid getting a near-CH spell? Yes, I would, since the CH spell is a reward for being utterly helpless is almost every other respect. But if the shaman gets even a 1/4 CH spell, we all might as well retire.<br />
<br />
Were I the business owner at Verant, I would fire the person who thought this up on the grounds that they were endangering the franchise.</div></div><hr />

Well, here's my take on it (and this is pretty much what I e-mailed to sony's feedback address).<br />
<br />
The details on the healing spells on test are level 54 (Druids, 75% or 2950 max, 10 sec, 400 mana - Shaman 75% or 1950 max, <br />
<br />
4) Reduce the proposed CH spell to 1600-2000 hp for 500-600 mana, and increase the cast time to 15 seconds.  This still gives druids/shaman a very effective heal, with great mana ratio - but with the increased cast time means that it's not as preferred as a cleric's CH.  Give it to the druids at level 53/54.<br />
<br />
5) Increase Nature's Touch to be a 1600 HP heal instead of 978 HP heal for 400 mana.  Lower the cast time to 4.5 seconds to compete with the new druid CH at level 53/54.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
I'm not sure why you present this solution... a CH for 1600-2k in 15 seconds for around 500 mana or 3k in 10 seconds (assuming I cast your version of NT 2x) for  a total 800 mana and a savings of 5 seconds.  I'd never cast a 15 second heal.  As it is with how they are currently worked I will need to decide which to cast, more hp (if I've judged the hp of the person well) in 10 seconds or a sure 1k heal in 5 seconds.</div></div><hr />

I figured you of all people would be familiar with Verant's platitudes. As many times as we've been lied to by Verant as a class I would have a hard time believing them if they said the sky was blue. You'll note they threw us a bone on test to shut us up. While group CE is something we've asked for I'm baffled by the other 3. A new Yaulp that gives you a net gain of 15 mana and 25% haste, a new heal that's as pathetically efficient as CE (hint: wizards, masters of DD, nuke at 4:1 so why are the masters of healing limited to 3:1 unless we use CH?), and the wonder of wonders... a NEW SUMMONED HAMMER. &quot;Hey, let's get that second cleric because he can summon that 56 hammer!&quot; :rolleyes:<br />
<br />
This is, what, a 300% increase for druids in healing? And your CH works with focus! The stuff on test is nothing new for clerics and just goes to show Verant, once again, has no clue about our plight. Here's a hint for Scott: roll up a level 60 cleric and go play on CT. Bind in the Nexus and see how easy it is for you to get an exp group. Now repeat this for a week. Not very easy, is it? Now get an EB item and try to solo. It's like watching paint dry... No fair cheating and using a Hammer of the Sun either. THIS is what the future of the cleric class is. it's too late to save our raiding abilities (and CH will be turned off in PoP so we'll have nothing to do on raids but res) but you CAN save our exp time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Torelorm</div><div class="date">08-22-2002, 12:43 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Sorry for not reading all 11 pages, but I wanted to drop by from the Crucible and give my 2 cents.<br />
<br />
First, anyone that thinks a shaman is a good healer is 1) under 34 or 2) thinks all shammys are 60 with Torpor.<br />
<br />
To be honest, I really don't want this spell.  I would be much happier with a mini version of Torpor (with the current restrictions) rather than a gimp version of CH that is going to make someone think : cool, the shammy can add healing to the buff, debuff, slow duties that he is already tasked with.<br />
<br />
Slow + the malo line = enough aggro for me.  If this has heal aggro along with it then I would just rather drop a DoT and at least do damage.<br />
<br />
Would I like a better heal?  Sure.  It would be nice to heal a raid buffed tank for more than almost a bubble.<br />
<br />
Do I want stuck in a ghetto CH rotation just because I am now &quot;CH capable&quot;?  Hell no.<br />
<br />
Sure, we shamans want some more stuff added to our class, but we are pretty reasonable for the most part.  Rather than a crippled CH, just do one (or more - even better) of the following:<br />
<br />
-- Check our spell drop rates<br />
<br />
-- Check our self-only buff stacking issues<br />
<br />
-- A better nuke would be nice, but still a toy<br />
<br />
-- A better heal would be nice, but we will survive.  Oh, you will not, but we will :)<br />
<br />
-- Check our resists on DoTs.  Maybe lower them just a bit.<br />
<br />
We are not the ones asking for CH and Manaburn and whatever else the Grove wants these days.  Clerics heal and rez (well, nice HP buffs too), so you do your job and I will do mine.<br />
<br />
We are an easy to get along with group of players.  We ask for our fair share, but we don't want to infringe on other classes.  You keep CH and we will keep slow.<br />
<br />
Anyway, just in case anyone is rabid about this issue I just wanted to stop by and say: we'll take it, but we don't really want it.  We have other issues we need resolved and CH does zippo for us.<br />
<br />
Here's to my cleric pals!  Cheers and good luck on getting a damn invis spell.</div></div><hr />

Remember, if the end-goal is a healthy party its the same effect if they are never hurt as if they get hurt and are healed.<br />
<br />
Shaman slows and hastes, along with other buffs/debuffs, reduce the DPS of mobs, increase the DPS of groups, to the point where even the shaman 2k heal is more than enough on the MT.  Combined with Canni-dancing, and you have endless healing, when it is needed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Wyte</div><div class="date">08-22-2002, 02:21 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Correct me if I'm wrong, but it looks to me like the majority of Clerics are okay with the new spells in the context of raid level encounters.<br />
<br />
The percentage heal idea was posed at the Druids Grove in response to the complete lack of scaling heals in a &quot;Priest&quot; class.  It looks like Verant is willing to entertain the idea at least.  Why not come up with ideas (and I think many have) that would fit well into the Cleric grouping context?<br />
<br />
I am personally saddened by Clerics saying &quot;Healing is boring as hell&quot; coupled with &quot;I don't want to be more versatile, I just want to heal&quot;.  Cripes, why play a game where you want to keep a monopoly on what makes you bored sick?  Please understand, I'm not saying this is the opinion of the majority of Clerics, but I do see it.<br />
<br />
Whether or not these spells go live, I would love to see upgrades to the Cleric arsenal in the grouping/soloing department.  To me, this game is supposed to be about fun.  I can see valid points being made;  namely sitting LFG with NO options is not fun.<br />
<br />
Interestingly, I have a Cleric bot.  I don't think I would want Druidly skills for him to increase the fun level.  In my opinion, the following would be in line:<br />
- For the &quot;updated&quot; cleric pet:  New buffs that would allow it to do uber bane damage.  High mana cost, relatively low duration.  It would be situational, point being it would add value to solo/grouping when heals are largely factored out.<br />
- A mob debuff that prevents it from AE'ing for x amount of ticks (although this would fit more into raids).<br />
- New take on MoK:  Large heal component/very high mana cost, divided into number of melee PC's attacking.  For instance, starts out at 100 HP (nice round figure).  1st melee attacks; that person's ID is added to the count.  He/She is healed 100 HP per hit.  2nd melee attacks, ID is added to the count.  100 divided by 2 Id's = 50 HP.  Now both melee will gain 50 HP per hit.  3 melee would gain 33 HP per hit, and so on.  Therefore, this would be much more useful in groups with few melees and some casters than on a raid.<br />
<br />
In summary,  I would like to see Clerics happy for Druids and Shamans; and I would like to see Clerics happy for Clerics when this balancing act has been played out.</div></div><hr />

Shaman slow &gt; all Druid abilities.  Period.  <br />
<br />
Shaman slow &gt; all Cleric abilities, save CH.  Period.<br />
<br />
In my opinion, slow is the single most damaging thing to cleric viability in xp groupings.  At least the Druid can fall back on some decent nuking.  What can a cleric do?  Send in the hammer?<br />
<br />
Don't get me wrong, I LOVE being grouped with a Shaman in xp groups.  They are an amazing class usually played by very skillful EQers, in my experience.  But you HAVE to admit that Slow + Improved Melee DPS makes healing a mere annoyance in most zones.<br />

From this thread (http://forums.interealms.com/shaman/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=4620) <br />
<br />
So it is confirmed from Test we could use this spell like a real CH to full health, if applied soon enough. I think the following is interesting--how far you can let your party member drop in HP and still use this spell as a CH: <br />
<br />
Target / Spell / % of Full Health <br />
Max / Max / at which to land <br />
HP / Heal / for CH effect <br />
<br />
1500 1125 25% (375HP left) <br />
2000 1500 25% (500HP left) <br />
2600 1950 25% (650HP left) <br />
3000 1950 35% (1050HP left) <br />
4000 1950 51% (2050HP left) <br />
6000 1950 68% (4050HP left) <br />
 <br />
<br />
Just for the record, I'm another shaman against this spell going live.  You guys sacrificed too much for a lousy healing role.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Additionally, we've already posted on our GUILD message board a notice to the effect that clerics will now be bidding on/expecting to get a shot at the following: <br />
<br />
HP/AC Gear <br />
PRIMAL 1hb from Sleeper's Tomb <br />
Haste Items <br />

After all, how high does our wisdom have to be to whack away at a mob? It doesn't take much mana to root a mob either. <br />

Time to whip out my 56 Pally and level her up to 60.... no wait... pally's are gimp too. Given the choice of a Pally or an SK in a group that has a Druid healer (with the new spells), most exp groups would pick an SK any day of the week /sigh. <br />
<br />
Ok, guess, then I'll be leveling up my 22 druid or my level 5 monk, or my level 5 rogue. <br />
<br />
This really just sucks IMO. I hope that Verant comes to their senses. I don't begrudge druids/shammy's becoming more powerful, but darn-it, make the clerics more powerful as well. <br />

Ok. I duel box a Cleric and warrior.  Both are halfway through 57. <br />
<br />
I Killed in CS for all of level 53 for both.  The entire time i was there, In the time i killed 4 mobs (and was OOM and had to med up), i chatted with druids and wizards who would kill 6-8-16 mobs in the same time frame depending on level....Quading.  Even counting downtime.  One druid would gate around and find a chanter to Clarity, or better KEI him every time it wore off.   I was splitting exp on less mobs. *sigh*<br />
<br />
I solo'd my cleric on Light Blues in Burning woods all through 51. <br />
Light Blue Undead. One at a time. Get two? run for zone.  Get three? Run from bind point back to corpse. <br />
<br />
I loved my cleric up till 52.  Then it became obvious that without a melee - i couldn't do anything.  Without a group, i was sittin on my buttocks.  Thus the warrior (should have gone SK).<br />

<br />
Shammys don't need it.<br />
Druids ... ARE NOT A HEALING CLASS.<br />
<br />
Yes. DRUIDS ARE NOT HEALERS.  Druids admit it. They say - i can't keep up on groups as a healer.   Why can't everyone admit they are not a healer?  I NEVER look for a druid for healing alone. WHO does is beyond me? Perhaps if you already have a shammy... <br />
<br />
- Druids already are better DD casters than Mages.  Just ask the mages.<br />
- Druids already have some of the best mobility in the game - less port types than wizards, but ask a druid and wizard to race... um.. SOW anyone?<br />
- Druids Can also DOT, Fear, Charm, Illusions, Buff, Mana Regen on other casters, evac to zone-in, regen hp, DS the party for extra dmg, Snare (in someplaces, not snaring will get you killed!!)...<br />
<br />
With all that the druid can do, they are a GREAT class to have in a team.  And alot of places i don't go without one - like Hole, SS Temple, Grey, WW! - because i don't like that long run home at the end of the night.  I never ask one because of heals.  I get them because they Add DMG to the group and can spot heal the cleric if needed.  Or themselves if they overagro :)  Kinda like Pallys. <br />
<br />
Druids are NOT a healer.  Sooner everyone realizes this, and accepts druids for what they are - 2nd best nuker, spot healer, and load of utilities, including get out of death free card - evac....<br />
<br />
All will be better. <br />
<br />
But WAIT! No! lets make them 2nd best healer too! And wait! good enough for 99% of the time your in the game unless your in end-game guild who raids all the time :)<br />
<br />
<br />
Shammys don't need the spell.<br />
Druids don't need that spell. <br />
<br />
Give druids a LURE type DD  instead to make them more useful on raids. Let them continue that role of Damage Dealer - not make them into a healer. <br />

These spells will go into LIVE.  Of this i have no doubt. <br />
<br />
So since my cleric won't be needed for healing in Groups with Druid or shammy (not needed now in groups with good shammy). <br />
<br />
I ask for the following in return for giving away one of our cornerstone spells for our class.<br />
<br />
Invis  This can be outdoor, and indoor versions at 1 spell level after druids.  Or it can be just normal old invis.  Not self only either.  <br />
<br />
Slow . Yep....<br />
(Sorry shammys i don't want to interfear with your duties, i really don't - what i really want none of this and Druids to go away and not be healers)<br />
... If we arn't best healers, then we need a slow.  Divine Hinderance.  It should be same as enchanter, and thus less than shammys. Using the chanter ones would make it simple to add to the game. <br />
<br />
Group Evac to Zoneline .  This is a get out of jail free card. This is a form of saving the group and much better than rezing.  Clerics know when to evac.  We'll take it at level 29 for lesser, 59 for greater. This still gives other classes an edge.  And its not a true port - just a lifesaver - which is a cleric THING.<br />
<br />
Flame Strike . Massive Target AoE spell with low Agro and Fire based.   I only ask because its what DnD clerics always had...<br />
<br />
Snare .  I am ok with Undead only - but lets push for all mobs. <br />
<br />
Improve and expand the Mark Spells . <br />
<br />
New spell, Mark of Reckoning, at 14, 5 point DS<br />
New Spell, Mark of Fhael, at 24, 2 point healing shield.<br />
<br />
Move Mark of Retribution to 39.  <br />
Move Mark of Karn to 44.<br />
<br />
New Spell, Mark of Judgment, at 54 - 25 DS. <br />
New Spell, Mark of Garon,  at 57 - 12 point Healing Shield<br />
New Spell, Mark of the Gods, At 60 - 25 DS and 12 Heal. <br />

&quot;Decrease the cleric's mandatory dependancy on grouping for any reasonable gain &quot; <br />

I post in EQdruids under brum15, or should I say I did.   I play both a cleric and druid and let me say the clerics are being much more polite.  Dalur is basically saying everyone keep it calm or get kicked out.   Your moderator's say hey clerics keep it down or get kicked out but we are going to let our druids and long time posters slide.  <br />
<br />
If a cleric went to eqdruids and posted something like yesiamadruid here he would have been flamed and your moderators have already told us they would do nothing to them.<br />
<br />
Moderators should be fair, not giving preference to their class unless maybe you think it would be fair for us to call you all kinds of names here and get away with it yet when you reply for dalur to kick you off.    your moderators could learn a lot from dalur.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kingwhip</div><div class="date">08-25-2002, 02:08 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Just a shaman popping in to lend my support. I don't think that shaman need this spell, but I am one of the lucky ones that have Torpor. Having done a substantial amount of raiding, I do think that druids (and the raids) would benefit greatly from a new and better heal. This current CH is not it however. It does too much harm to clerics ability to get groups. <br />
<br />
I think a group heal, something along the lines of Healing Wave of Prexus would be an ideal spell for druids to get. They complain about not being efficient healers on raids, then this would give them a nice compliment to go with NT. If the MA needs spot heals while CH lands, NT works well. Maybe reduce the cast time on it a tiny bit so it can be chain cast more effectively. If additional healing is not needed on the MA, then the new group heal would be great at countering the effects of AE, if not so much Rampage damage.<br />
<br />
Bottom line, I don't think that VI should ruin an entire class, just because one other class is unhappy with their role. If VI can not be creative enough to come up with a solution that satisfies druids, without affecting another class in an adverse way, then they should tell druids tough luck. Clerics have been and should always be the main healers and most needed class for groups and raids. It is what you all signed up for (why, I have no idea /shrug). <br />
<br />
I think that a lot of you have seen that while shaman will gladly accept the spell if it does go live (see the drop rate on Torpor), that the shaman community overall doesn't want the spell. We would be much happier with other changes to our class (once again see the drop rate on Torpor), or just keeping the status quo. <br />
<br />
For those clerics who see shaman as a bigger threat than druids, we probably are, but not by our design. Like I said we aren't going after other classes abilities like the druids seem to. We have remained almost as unchanged as clerics have. The biggest reason why shaman have gotten so powerful is that:<br />
<br />
 a) people LOVE their shaman and don't bother as much with alts as other classes do, thus giving a very large population of level 60 shaman, most with many AA points and quite a lot with full spellbooks <br />
<br />
b) VI has made it so the average melee can take an incredible amount of damage due to gear/abilities. This added with slow makes it much more viable for a shaman to be a healer. Nothing changed about the shaman slow or heals, VI just added much better gear/abilities so that melee bring their own damage mitigation to group that is much better than it ever was. When Kunark was released, there is no way a shaman could have been the main healer in an OS group, even with slow. Now with a MA in full NToV gear, or now VT gear, a shaman can do it no sweat a lot of the time, even without Torpor.<br />
<br />
Anyway, thought I would come over and lend my support. I am hoping that the spells don't go live, and if they do, they better at least make them 600mana. Until then, don't get too crazy about it.<br />

<br />
I could see a slightly better heal for them, but 2900??? <br />
<br />
Also, peeps talk about us still being needed in the highend game. How long will it take clerics to get there, if they are not sought after in the low/middle/high-middle game? Splain me that, Lucy.<br />

And to those that say &quot;let's wait and see if these things survive Test and do go live&quot;, I say 'IT'S TOO LATE THEN...YOU FOOLS....TOO LATE....TOO LATE.....TOO LATE'</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Greycloak</div><div class="date">08-25-2002, 04:25 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Listen... it's really very simple.<br />
<br />
Verant blows on and on and on about &quot;balance&quot;.<br />
<br />
From the time we're n00bs wackin' bats in Freeport till we're ready for our first Dragon encounters the word &quot;balance&quot; is stuffed down our throats.<br />
<br />
Things are given/taken from a class/archetype to insure that no one class dominates too overpoweringly. <br />
<br />
Necro's have been beaten to DEATH with that freakin' nerf bat because they are assumed to be such powerful soloers. &quot;Balance&quot; don't you know. And the humilations that Wizards must endure in the name of &quot;balance&quot; well... let's not even START that discussion here.<br />
<br />
Hybrids are alway condemed to be laughingstocks in the name of &quot;balance&quot;. They get at level 30 what other &quot;pure&quot; classes got at level 14. Or under. To give a Ranger REAL AC/HP would make them just toooo out of &quot;balance&quot;. To give an SK the HIGH end Necro spells/pets would do the same. No &quot;balance&quot; you see. Just ask a Pally how HE feels about &quot;balance&quot;.<br />
<br />
Sooo... let me put the question to you:<br />
<br />
In the name of &quot;balance&quot; shouldn't a class that's perfectly capable of soloing/quadding their way from 1 to 60 with 20+ AA points be NECESSARILY NERFED to insure they ARENT necessary in raid level encounters?<br />
<br />
Since when does it balance the game to be able to solo at will, quad down ENTIRE zones. AND be the preferred healer in a &quot;raid level encounter&quot;?<br />
<br />
Dedicated clerics realize at low levels that they are giving up the ability to be soloing gods and melee powerhouses in EXCHANGE for desirability in a group, and a sure ticket to high end encounters in the end game.<br />
<br />
It never occured to clerics to scream at the top of their collective lungs until Verant grants us the ability to quad the entire Grey/TD/SD/CS zone. We bought into the whole concept of &quot;balance&quot; you see.<br />
<br />
Perhaps that should change now. <br />
<br />
If druids get CH - I want SoW, DoT/Snare and effective AE. Ports too. Until I can monopolize every mob in certain zones in the game I won't really feel like I've achieved &quot;BALANCE&quot;. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Polyneices</div><div class="date">08-25-2002, 09:37 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">My thoughts as a player-<br />
<br />
Druids are priests they are healers. Nearly every role in this game has 2 class who can fulfill a certain role ( Mez/Charm Enc Bard, Slow Enc Shammy, Pulling Monks Sk's, Tanking Warrior Pally SK's, etc etc). Some do abilities better then others but there is always at least 2 classes to fulfill a specific need except for healing. For your larger raids with bigger mobs you can only rely on a cleric to provide the type of healing support to have a successful raid. As I see it this spell or something of the sorts is just what the game needs, whether its the druid class or not I dont really care. I have seen far too many raids cancelled due to lack of clerics, or seen groups break up because a cleric replacment cannot be found. Eq has just gotten to dependent on clerics to do anything.<br />
<br />
My thoughts from a druid point of view-<br />
<br />
I do not want to be a main healer. If I wanted the duties of being a main healer I would have made a cleric. While an upgrade on our heals of this magnitude could do a lot for the game im not sure its the role for me. My druid is lvl 60 and I try an get away from healing at every opportunity  that I can, back up healing I can do, but being a main healer sucks ( no offense clerics ). I have mixed feelings about this heal coming live. I do not have the hp's nor the AC to take hits like clerics do with the aggro they get from CH.<br />
<br />
More thoughts -<br />
<br />
Not all druids are dr00ds. There are a lot of twinked alts, Pl'ers, and port biatches out there that have given the druid class a bad name. Its not fair to flame the entire druid community for others mistakes. As far as our petition goes, it was merely an attempt to improve our class in the higher end of the game. You dont have to agree with it but supporting your fellow gamers seems like a more noble thing to do then to flaming them *shrug*. Some people, I agree ask for too much but thats always going to happen. There are good druids out there who just want to have a better role in later levels then soloing because quite honestly that gets sooo boring after 60 lvls of doing it =/ <br />
<br />
Final thought - If this does go live I am interested to see the effect it has on the game itself as a player im excited that the game may just be a little less dependent on clerics, as a druids im scared as hell about what kind of agro this spell is gonna get  me =P<br />
I support any changes that are for the better of all EQ players, making the game less dependent on clerics only for healing i think is great I just dont think im ready for it to be me =(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ludashanus</div><div class="date">08-27-2002, 12:48 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">If the Complete Heal Spell allows Druids and Shaman's to replace Clerics, doesn't that mean that they become clerics? They won't have the mana to cast their own spells, let alone the healing spells that a cleric would normally cast......hmmmm<br />
<br />
Does this also mean that all a cleric is good for is healing? I had thought we offer a great deal more then just casting Cheal, but maybe I have been missing something.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hakken</div><div class="date">08-27-2002, 01:05 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">In a group that requires constant healing they would not have mana to do other things.   However few exp groups require constant heals.    I know if I was a tank in a fight where I only needed a heal every other mob, I would rather have a healer who could SOW, snare, slow, ds, str buff, dex buff, sta buff, regen etc.  Sure we as clerics have buffs but the only one we have that is significanlty better cost a dot to cast.    at least in the pre 55 game.  Overall in any but the most healing intense group shammy&gt;druid&gt;cleric.   Now when the s&amp;^% hits the fan and the healing becomes intense then cleric &gt; all.  The problem lies with clerics being able to group in the less healing intense situations so that they can level up to partake in the the expletive fan raids.<br />
<br />
Best suggestion I have seen so far is aura suggestion, whereas just by us being in group atk, ac and stats improve.</div></div><hr />
