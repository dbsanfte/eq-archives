Pets basically treat mesmerized<br>                             NPCs as if they were dead <br>                             Pets are neutral to NPCs. Monsters will not attack pets first unless the pet is<br>                             being aggressive to something <br>                             Pets take 75% of the experience from a creature if no player does damage to<br>                             that creature <br>                             Pets take ZERO experience from a creature unless no player does damage to<br>                             that creature <br>                             The exception to the above rule is Dire Charmed pets, which will take a share<br>                             of the experience scaled by the amount of damage they do. In most situations<br>                             (with an active party, for example) the Dire Charmed pet will not take<br>                             experience. Like all pets, they will take 75% of the experience if no PC does<br>                             damage to the target. As long as a player does damage to a creature, a Dire<br>                             Charmed pet will never take more experience than it used to. <br>                             Charmed NPCs will now respond to the /pet report health command <br>                             /pet sit down command should now work on charmed NPCs <br>                             Fixed a bug that was preventing reclaim energy from working on Magician Epic<br>                             pets. <br><br>                        Miscellaneous<br><br>                             Fixed a bug that was causing a person that logs out with "damage shields:<br>                             OFF" to be unable to see damage shield even when they turned them back on <br>                             Fixed a problem that was causing crashes when /following someone on a horse<br>                             if they went out of range <br>                             Fixed a bug that prevented targeting an invisible NPC from horseback, even<br>                             with See Invisible <br><br><br><br><br>Information found at <a href="http://eq.castersrealm.com/">http://eq.castersrealm.com/</a><br></blockquote></p>

While I've mostly enjoyed (greatly enjoyed) my return to EQ, there's <a href="http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/Forum4/HTML/000316.html">an issue</a> that really gets my blood boiling.  No, it doesn't have diddly to do with Clerics, but you might find it mildly entertaining.<br></blockquote></p>

Players<br>                          with such items will need to petition and ask a GM to swap the item out with a new one<br>                          - Focus items using the "Naki's Pernicity" effects should now be working as intended<br>                          - Focus items that affect a spell's duration should now work for clickable items<br>                          - It should be impossible to equip an item that will reduce your hit points by more than your maximum hit points.<br>                          Also, hit point reduction items should not lower hit points below 1<br>                          - Tinkered Compass now adds the appropriate bonus to the sense heading skill<br>                          - Hit point bonuses on food items should be working<br><br><br>                          ** Spells **<br><br>                          - Higher level familiars should once again survive when their masters go invisible, Abscond or Evac<br>                          - Fixed a bug that was preventing the Lesser Familiar mana regeneration component from working<br>                          - Familiars no longer cause damage to their master upon death<br>                          - Familiar buff remains after the caster uses the /pet get lost command to remove the visual representation<br>                          - Torrent of Fatigue should be working properly now<br>                          - Allure of the Wild has had its level cap raised to make it a useful upgrade <br>                          - Umbra has been improved to give a slightly higher AC benefit <br>                          - A character can no longer trade with an NPC when invisible.

The problem was with filters that allowed players to<br>                          ignore spells that were hitting them. The following changes were needed to fix this issue<br>                          - Player characters will now always see spells that hit them and spells they cast<br>                          - Players with the Group option set for PC spells will see the start spell casting messages for people in their group<br>                          and they will also see when member of their group are hit with spells<br>                          - Players with the ALL option will still see all PC spells and spell hits<br><br><br>                          ** Spell Stacking **<br><br>                          General stacking changes: Some buffs were not being allowed to stack which now will stack, and other buffs were<br>                          being allowed to stack which should not have. <br><br>                          For example, many stacking problems with spells that have a See Invisible or Levitate component are now gone<br>                          (e.g. Dead Man Floating), while a number of stacking exploits that granted too much regeneration, too much<br>                          offense (ATK), too large of a damage shield, or too many hit points have been fixed. Here are some of the details:<br><br>                          - Vision abilities (natural or spell-granted) should no longer cause spells to fail to take hold<br>                          - Bard songs should in general overwrite fewer spells<br><br>                          - Harness of Spirit no longer stacks with spells that grant Strength or Dexterity boosts. It was never intended to<br>                          do so<br>                          - Harness of Spirit and Avatar should now stack properly<br>                          - Call of the Predator and Warder's Protection should no longer stack<br>                          - Arch Lich should no longer overwrite innate racial vision abilities<br>                          - Levitate and Dead Man Floating should no longer conflict<br>                          - Dead Man Floating should no longer conflict with any vision abilities (natural or spell granted)<br>                          - Spirit of Eagle should no longer cancel Levitation/Levitate spells<br>                          - Fixed a stacking exploit with Armor of Protection and Armor of the Risen<br>                          - Focus of Spirit should no longer overwrite Visions of Grandeur<br>                          - Focus of Spirit should now stack with the Whistling Fists effect<br>                          - "Circle of" Druid spells should no longer stack with their Resist counterparts. <br>                          - Shroud of Spirits and the Cloak of the Akheva should stack properly now<br>                          - Cantata of Soothing should no longer overwrite Clarity spells<br>                          - Cantata and Chorus of Replenishment should no longer overwrite Acumen<br>                          - Bladecoat no longer overwrites Clarity II<br>                          - Lower level druid group buffs should now be less likely to overwrite higher level buffs<br>                          - Avatar and Force of Nature will no longer stack<br>                          - Ancient Feral Avatar should now stack properly<br><br><br>                          ** Alternate Advancement **<br><br>                          - Improved Familiar should now be better than Greater Familiar<br>                          - Fixed a bug with Permanent Illusion that was causing the caster to see his illusions drop when zoning, even if<br>                          others continued to see the illusion<br>                          - Trolls and Iksar no longer receive double regeneration ability from AA abilities<br>                          - The Archetype skill Casting Deftness will no longer supercede the Class specific Quick Buff casting time reducing<br>                          skill. Note that at this time there is a maximum benefit to casting time bonuses of a 50% reduction<br>                          - Casting deftness was changed to reflect the increases presented by the in-game help (5, 15 and 25%)<br>                          - Turn Summoned should now work on all summoned creatures, not just pets. The text should correctly say that<br>                          there is only one level for this ability<br>                          - Improved Reclaim Energy now works with the epic pet<br>                          - Fixed a crash bug caused by Call Corpse<br>                          - Alternate Advancement abilities that affect a spell's duration should now work for clickable items<br>                          - Quick Summon should now work for Call of the Hero and Manifest Elements<br>                          - Quick Summon also changed to match the benefits presented by the in-game help<br><br><br>                          ** Skills **<br><br>                          - Increased the velocity tolerance for the Hide skill. This may slightly improve the functionality of the Evade skill<br>                          - Poison should no longer be interrupted<br>                          - Sneak only breaks when a character is hit, not when he hits someone<br>                          - Fixed a bug that was causing a problem when Pick Pockets was used before Beg had refreshed. Beg and Pick<br>                          Pocket use the same timer, so now using Beg or Pick Pocket will cause both buttons to gray out<br>                          - A message is now displayed and skills are properly reset when a rogue breaks sneak and/or hide because he is<br>                          looting a corpse<br>                          - Beastlords should function like other hybrids when casting in melee<br><br><br>                          ** Zones **<br><br>                          - The Hole now uses Kunark-level Mez/Charm/Taunt rules<br>                          - Petrified humerus should now be available<br>                          - Zones where mounts cannot be summoned will now remove mounts when they enter the zone<br>                          - High level NPCs can now be taunted in Cazic Thule<br>                          - Random frame lag in Guktop and Oasis should be fixed<br>                          - Fixed a pathing problem in Tenebrous Mountains<br>                          - Fixed a pathing bug in Paludal Caverns<br>                          - Fixed pathing exploits in Chardok<br>                          - Fixed a pathing exploit in Cazic Thule<br>                          - Fixed a pathing exploit in Acrylia<br>                          - Fixed a pathing bug in the Tower of Frozen Shadow<br>                          - Fixed a pathing bug in Fungus Grove<br>                          - Fixed a spot where characters could get stuck in Twilight Sea<br>                          - Moved the Permafrost 'safe point' closer to the zone line<br>                          - Addressed an issue with an aggressive NPC that appeared outside of the Arx Building in Sanctus Seru<br>                          -Modified the Vyzh`dra the Cursed spawn trigger to make the various incarnations more accessible<br>                          -Modified several NPCs in the temple of Ssraeshza to address the disparity between melee and caster effectiveness<br>                          in the zone<br><br><br>                          ** Quests **<br><br>                          - Adjustments have been made to the 8th Coldain Prayer Shawl quest<br>                          - High Priestess Alexandriana should be working properly now<br><br><br>                          ** Tradeskills **<br><br>                          - Added over 1,000 new tradeskill recipes for all levels of skill, along with many recipe books. A few of the vendors<br>                          of Norrath might be able to get you started on your way <br>                          - Added Mortar and Pestle to a Thurgadin merchant<br>                          - Rubbing Alcohol is now available from a vendor in Thurgadin<br><br><br>                          ** Guilds **<br><br>                          - Fixed many bugs with the guild system, for example: GMs can now rename guilds without the need to destroy and<br>                          recreate them, guilds can have names that share the first 15 characters with another guild (they couldn't before)<br>                          and people should no longer experience random guild kickouts when a guild on their server is deleted/reformed.<br><br><br>                          ** Pets **<br><br>                          - A character may now have a horse, a pet and an Eye of Zomm at the same time<br>                          - /pet attack range has been limited to prevent its use as a targeting tool.

These characters,<br>                          however, must be on the same team<br><br><br>                          ** Firiona Vie Rules Changes **<br><br>                          Since the launch of Firiona Vie we have had tremendous support for this special server from players who want a<br>                          very roleplaying immersive environment. Players have made numerous suggestions to tweak the ruleset a little<br>                          more. We have taken many of those suggestions and made changes accordingly. <br><br>                          We will be keeping the following rules intact: <br><br>                          * /ooc will remain unavailable to remind people that acting in character is strongly recommended. <br>                          * The Common language will remain out, to help maintain the feeling of race-based community and to allow people<br>                          to continue to roleplay someone with a native tongue. <br>                          * The Trivial Loot Code and all of the special rules for no-drop items will remain. This has worked out nicely for the<br>                          sense of community on the server. <br>                          * The one character per account restriction will remain.<br><br>                          However, we will be removing the following restrictions:<br><br>                          * Anonymous/roleplay flags will no longer be required. They will remain available, but forcing anonymity on<br>                          characters was causing undue problems finding groups and other such things that are essential to enjoyable<br>                          gameplay. <br>                          * The language learning limit/speed restrictions will be removed. While the idea of limited languages seemed like a<br>                          good idea, this is another item that was just making it too hard to actually play the game. Roleplayers that don't<br>                          want their characters to be overly literate always have the option to play their characters that way. <br>                          * /shout and /auction have returned to unrestricted use to allow easier grouping and selling. People are welcome<br>                          to filter those channels if they prefer not to see them, but the benefits of having them availabe is just too great.<br>                          /ooc will remain disabled on this server. Obviously, acting in character on any channel is strongly recommended. <br>                          * Alignment restrictions has been removed. Forced restrictions for grouping make playing the game too much of a<br>                          chore. Characters, however, may always decide who they wish to group with based on any factors the character<br>                          perceives. If your Dark Elf won't group with a paladin, he doesn't have to (and shouldn't). If your cleric of Quellious<br>                          wants to heal a necromancer because healing people is the right thing to do for him, then you should be able to do<br>                          so. But not allowing these things is a restriction on your ability to play that character 'in-character', and a real<br>                          hindrance to general gameplay.<br><br>                          Again, it's important to understand that this is still a roleplaying preferred server. The rules that we are changing<br>                          were often as much of a restriction to one's ability to roleplay as they were a help. And the artificial barriers to<br>                          grouping, especially the trouble created in just finding a group, needed to be removed to allow people to actually<br>                          play the game. </blockquote></p>

This ability does not lessen the chance of scoring a critical hit with<br>                             Alternate Experience abilities that grant criticals <br><br>                        Client/Interface<br><br>                             Added /dopropertinting command. This command allows you to turn on and off the<br>                             "DoProperTinting" option in the eqclient.ini file. Activating this command should correct<br>                             most tinting issues (such as armor tint also tinting the character's skin). But if it<br>                             causes issues you can toggle it off by using /dopropertinting off <br>                             Added /chat commands, that allow players to create their own chat channels. Please<br>                             read the eqmanual_supplement.doc in your EverQuest directory for more information <br>                             Added /hitsmode command. This command allows you to more finely control how you<br>                             see hits, including seeing them in a window other than your chat window. Please see<br>                             the eqmanual_supplement.doc for more details <br>                             Added /clearhits to clear the current hits in the M2-M5 modes of the /hitsmode<br>                             command. Again, please see the eqmanual_supplement for more information <br>                             Added /showgrass command. This toggles the radial flora (Luclin only) on and off <br>                             Added options in the Options screen (under Chat Filter) for filtering out Melee and Spell<br>                             criticals. Options are All/Me/Off. These can also be activated using the /filter<br>                             command, and will affect critical hit, critical blast, exceptional heal, and crippling blow<br>                             messages <br>                             Changed /filter to allow you to toggle the various chat filter settings (still also lets you<br>                             toggle the badwords filter) <br>                             Changed /channel to allow you to set your default chat channel. It also now saves this<br>                             setting in the INI file <br>                             Changed the /targetgroupbuff command to be 'persistent'. The state of the switch will<br>                             be stored in the eqclient.ini file and will be remembered when you log out or zone <br>                             Fixed the double messages received when "Soandso's song ends" <br>                             Mend should be working properly. "Can not use Mend for x seconds" can still appear,<br>                             but you now should be able to use mend at the appropriate time <br>                             Fixed bug in the client that caused a "You are out of Ammo message" even when you<br>                             still had ammo <br>                             Messages should no longer be lost while you are zoning <br>                             Corpses that are made to appear at the "safe spot" of a zone for any reason can now<br>                             be moved using /corpse as long as the person using the command has /consent for<br>                             that corpse <br>                             Added "AllLuclinPcModelsOff" line to the eqclient.ini file which, if set to TRUE, will skip<br>                             the loading of all of the Luclin PC models (except the Vah Shir, which always gets<br>                             loaded no matter what this is set to). This should allow players to set the loading of<br>                             each race and sex individually for their normal game play, but then quickly turn all<br>                             models off for a raid or other such circumstances <br>                             Added /rtarget function (can be used as /rt). This function targets the last character<br>                             to send you a /tell. It follows all of the rules for /target <br>                             Messages sent to you while you are zoning should be saved and sent to you when you<br>                             reach the other side of the zone. Messages should no longer be lost while zoning<br>                             (unless zoning takes more than about 10 minutes for any reason) <br>                             You should be able to keep typing whatever you were in the middle of typing when you<br>                             zoned... but it might not be processed till you're in the new zone <br>                             If someone is on your ignore list and they do a /random, you shouldn't see it anymore <br><br>                        Pathing<br><br>                             Corrected some pathing in Ak'Anon that was preventing some NPCs from reaching<br>                             certain areas <br>                             Corrected some pathing issues in Acrylia Caverns <br>                             Corrected a problem with the entrance from Hollowshade Moor into Paludal Caverns<br>                             that was preventing Beastlord Warders from entering the zone <br><br>                        Miscellaneous<br><br>                             Many cases where characters would stab themselves with their weapons when sitting<br>                             should have been eliminated <br>                             Player characters no longer broadcast their location when they are stationary. This<br>                             should reduce the resources used and improve gameplay <br>                             Fixed a problem that was causing some users to see blocky, unblended terrain where<br>                             terrain types meet <br>                             Critical hit messages from spells now take into account PvP damage calculations.

February 13th, 3:00 am<br>------------------------------<br><br>** General **<br><br>- Improved sound for many users. Should eliminate a lot of the "choppy" sound issues<br>- Fixed one of the link-death-while-zoning bugs<br>- Characters who disconnect while zoning shouldn't be 'stuck' for an inordinate amount of time<br>- Renamed all will-o-wisps and will o' wisps to Fred. <br>- Reconsidered and changed Fred to willowisp.<br>- Pets no longer pace.

The Lord Cazic was trying to tell him something, but he could not yet decipher what it was. The hand on his shoulder startled him and he turned quickly, striking the intruder with a quick blow to the chest. The figure crumpled to the cold ground.<br><br>Glox stood over him with a look of horror, it was one of his own pupils he had struck. He lay bloodied and bruised at Glox's feet breathing heavily with much effort, he was obviously dying. The pupil reached up toward Glox with something in his hand. Glox took the items from his hand and peered at them intently. There were two items, one was a glistening serpentine scale, the other an ancient stone symbol. Glox recognized the symbol almost immediately with horror. It was the symbol of the Soriz, the ancient Iksar tribe that had been the slaves of the Shissar empire. Glox looked down at his pupil again. "Where did you get this?" The dying Iksar used his last ounce of energy to point up toward the night sky and the moon of Luclin. "sSs... Ssraeshza... has... returned..."<br><br><br>** A Call to Arms! **<br><br>Have you long dreamed of aiding your fellow adventurer?

The intent was to remove the confusion that having two patchers can cause and to encourage more people to play on the Test server.<br><br>Well, we're going back to the old way. We are going to split the Test patcher and the Live patcher back into two separate programs.<br><br>This means that in order to access the Test Server you will need to run TestEverQuest.exe, which you will find in your EverQuest directory. To play on the Live Servers just start EverQuest as you always have.<br><br>There are a few advantages to separating the two patchers. Splitting them up makes it a little easier, as a player, to be sure that you are headed to the right server when you double click the icon. It's also a little more intuitive for those that want to run the game in two directories.<br><br>Using two directories for EverQuest does use up a lot of hard drive space. However, for those with enough space that play regularly on both Test and on Live servers, this is a safer and faster way to work. Using the same directory means that each time you change servers (Live to Test or Test to Live) you will have to patch. The data on the Test Server is very rarely the same as that on Live servers.<br><br>And for us internally it makes it easier to test new patchers. It gives us one more step for testing. Now we can push a patcher to the Test Server and try it out there after internal testing and before it goes to the Live servers.<br><br>In any case, we've decided to move back to the old way. Starting on Monday, February 4th, 2002 you will need to run TestEverQuest.exe to patch and play on the Test server, and Everquest.exe to patch and play on the Live servers.<br><br>* Patch Message Addendum *<br><br>The command line argument "/test" should no longer be used to play on the Test Server. Anyone using this should remove this argument from their shortcut. Please manually select "TestServer" from the Advanced Options window to use the Test Server. On Monday, February 4th, TestEverQuest.exe will once again be used to patch and play on the Test Server.<br><br><br>- The EverQuest Team<br></blockquote></p>

Please see the Developer's Corner on our web site for more details<br>- Added Quest NPCs to Thurgadin, Kael and Skyshrine for Beastlord quest armor<br>- Gravel leaf tea will now fit in the combine container for the associated quest<br>- Grimling Blood should now be dropping<br>- Idia in the bard guild in Kelethin was telling you to turn in a quest item to the incorrect NPC.

Many of the items had AC that was inconsistent with the armor types of the classes.  The AC has been reduced on some pieces and raised on others.  In all instances where the AC was dropped a different statistic was raised.  Several items received a significant upgrade while others were downgraded<br>- Also in regards to Umbral Plains armor, Ranger has been removed from the plate class armor that was dropping and have been added to the usable classes on the chain equivalent.  Bards have been added to the plate equipment list.  This might mean that some Rangers will have armor that they can't use.  Our Customer Service personnel will trade out that armor for the chain equivalent<br>- Ghoulbane is now No-Drop<br>- SoulFire charges can only be used by Paladins (though they can be used from inventory)<br>- Raised the armor value on many Beastlord specific armor pieces<br>- Added effects to a few of the Wild Lord's armor pieces<br>- Added Vah Shir to Imbrued Plate Mail useable races<br>- Rhino Hide armor is now Druid and Monk usable<br>- The Crustacean Shell Shield is now magic<br>- Scroll of Knowledge can now be equipped in the primary, secondary, and range slots<br>- Scroll of Enlightenment can now be equipped in the primary, secondary, and range slots<br>- Thought Horror Fangs can now be thrown<br>- Iron Scroll of War must now be worn to activate<br>- Cloak of Thorns right click effect should work now<br>- Runed Bone Fork is now equippable primary, secondary and ranged.

All of these items require the player to be level 51+ to equip them and/or use their effects.  Setting the "Recommended Level" field like this just lets the player know what level they need to be to use the item.  The actual utility of the item was not affected in any way, this change is purely informational<br>- Several items have been changed to be not useable by Iksar.  They had been erroneously set as Iksar useable in the last item patch.  These were primarily items that were usable by Beastlords (and were therefore changed to allow all Beastlord races to use them), but that had been specifically restricted from use by Iksar due to their inherent armor value<br><br><br>** Zones **<br><br>- Shades in Umbral, Maiden's Eye and Vex Thall are now considered undead<br>- Placed portals to and from Great Divide and Nexus<br>- Added many new items to better round out the rewards for high-level Luclin encounters<br><br><br>** Horses **<br><br>- Implemented horse trade in quests.

Not stopping them when stunned was causing warping and other bad things<br>- Knockback spells, and spells that throw you into the air, now affect people on horses properly<br>- Horses now levitate when their rider should.<br>- Fixed a bug that was causing the client to crash when attempting to follow someone while on a horse. /follow should also now work when the person you are following is on a horse<br><br><br>** Spells **<br><br>- Wizard Familiar spell scrolls will now increase in purchase cost with the spell level<br>- Several spells will no longer be interrupted, spells such as the 'proc' generated by Instrument of Nife<br>- Several spells that were not functioning in the planes have been fixed and now work in the planes <br>- Bards should now gain singing skill when singing and should no longer gain skill in an instrument when they are not using one.<br>- Characters are no longer damaged by damage shields when using throwing weapons<br>- Atol's Spectral Shackles has had its casting difficulty reduced<br>- Made some changes to Nature's Recovery to make it more stackable<br><br><br>** Visual Issues **<br><br>- Wolves and warders should no longer appear to be very small<br>- Characters no longer lose their hair or beard when their illusions wear off<br>- Weapons should now appear properly (sometimes they wouldn't show up at all) when a player zoned in<br>- Characters in wolf or bear form (or other races that aren't player races) should no longer have parts of them tinted based on the armor the player was wearing<br>- Bear form should now look correct to people that zoned in after the spell was cast on them<br>- May have fixed the problem with extra mouse cursor showing in game<br>- Fixed a problem with NPCs, PCs and some objects not being visible in some zones (Wakening Lands, Plane of Growth, Emerald Jungle and Swamp of No Hope)<br><br><br>** Performance Issues **<br><br>- More work on reducing zone times for Luclin city zones<br>- "Hitch" created when player characters enter a zone should be gone now<br>- Fixed a bug that could cause the client to crash in some cases where a character tried to purchase an item from a vendor but didn't have enough money<br>- Characters with pets that zone (horses, familiars and warders) should now be able to zone from North Qeynos to Qeynos Hills<br><br><br>** New Features **<br><br>- Holding shift while clicking the resolution in the options in game will reduce the resolution.

                          Normally this isn't something I'd do. But, well, I'm going to outline the changes we're making to this quest in rather<br>                          close detail. But first, let me try to explain the concern that players had with this quest.<br><br>                          With arguably the most popular Epic Quest item, the Cleric trying to gain his Epic item usually finds plenty of people<br>                          to help in the process. Clerics are commonly the first in line with guilds to help with their epic quests. So Clerics<br>                          tend to get further in their epic quest faster than many others. This has lead to a very nasty 'bottleneck' for<br>                          Clerics trying to complete the quest. The Ragefire portion of the quest has been creating a lot of static among<br>                          players.<br><br>                          So we have decided to make a change to the end portion of this quest. To reduce confusion and to help people<br>                          understand why we're making this change, I'm going to give out a few specific details. These changes will go Live<br>                          with the patch tonight.<br><br>                          For those that are not interested in quest details, consider the rest of this post SPOILER INFORMATION:<br><br><br>                          First, the 'merchant' version of Zordak will now appear at a different location in SoldungB. He will appear once each<br>                          day (except after a server comes down, then he will spawn in one to three days). The appearance of this NPC will<br>                          no longer require the absence of Lord Nagafen.<br><br>                          The cleric still turns in his Shimmering Pearl to Zordak. But now the merchant Zordak will return a Swirling Pearl to<br>                          the Cleric and disappear.<br><br>                          At that point the Cleric will need to head out and look for him. A killable version of Zordak will appear independent<br>                          of the pearl turn-in every few days (except after a server goes down, then he will appear a little faster). Killing<br>                          Zordak will transform him into dragon form, and the Cleric (with help&#8230;) must kill him immediately.<br><br>                          The new dragon Zordak will drop a heart that is a container that requires the Swirling Pearl to be combined in it to<br>                          create the Heart that is turned in to Omat.<br><br>                          The rest of the quest remains the same.<br><br><br>                          The goal of these changes is to reduce the problems with the bottleneck that existed before. They will not remove<br>                          that bottleneck, but hopefully will remove the nasty competition for a single spawn with so many people willing to<br>                          be&#8230; rude to each other.<br><br>Alan<br><br><br><br><br>*Very interesting in my opinion.  I don't know how many times we have complained about this and asked that this be changed and lo and behold, we now have a different ending.  Way to go Verant.<br>                          </blockquote></p>

<blockquote>
First, due to the many generous donations received, this site is in no danger of disappearing any time soon.  EQCleric is currently funded through February, 2002.  I'll re-evaluate the available options in March.<br><br>Second, let's look at the available options.<br><ol><li>Cheap hosting: I'm (well you =P) currently paying $50/month for space and bandwidth.  While our storage needs are negligble, our bandwidth requirements are not.  Many people have written me about $10/month hosting sites with unlimited bandwidth.  Those sites offering unlimited bandwidth are generally lying.  If one looks hard those sites always have a disclaimer about a bandwidth cap at which point they start charging.  In all of the cases I looked at this site would have bandwidth overruns and have cost me (us) considerably more than $50/month.  So we're getting this site for a very reasonable fee.</li><br><li>Free hosting: Several people have written me offering completely free hosting including one individual who wishes to take over the site.  My inclination is come March, 2002 to take of one of them up on their offer.  I'll post more about it next year.</li></ol><br><br>So, thanks again for your support in keeping this site alive and enjoy your adventures in Norrath.<br><br>Signing out from Camelot,<br>Rayne</blockquote></p>
