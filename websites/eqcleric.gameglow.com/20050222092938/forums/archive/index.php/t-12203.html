<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">electrae</div><div class="date">09-28-2002, 02:17 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The following is meant to be humourous and tongue in cheek. <br />
<br />
<br />
Clerics, Druids, and other assorted priests,<br />
<br />
I think it's time for the cleric community to come clean with you. <br />
<br />
*Iron bars slam down on the windows.  The troll guards bar the doors.*<br />
<br />
As you know, clerics have lead dull, sheltered lives up until now.  We've often been slaves to a thing called the Cheal Chain.  It's a task we dread and dislike more than anything.  Like changing diapers, it stunk but someone had to do it.<br />
<br />
But one amongst us, Belladon Evilploy, had a dirty little idea.  He came up with a most evil plan to free us of this slavery.  Let's pawn this off onto the druids!  He talked to a few friends, they talked to their friends and soon we were all in agreement.  <br />
<br />
But we knew if we tried to force this off onto someone else they would balk, and rightfully so!  No one would willingly ask to be put into the most boring yet stressful position ever devised by gamekind.  So, we recruited a &quot;mole&quot; to pose as a druid and plant the seeds of desire.  This &quot;druid&quot; said that druids needed a better heal and a way to be useful on raids.  And of course, the other druids began to echo this sentiment until all the druid voices, except a very few wiley druids who somehow saw through our clever ruse, chanted this in &quot;harmony&quot;.<br />
<br />
And to lend credibility the clerics all complained that this heal would end their careers and make them unwanted in Norrath.  In reality they were all planning long, extended AFK's in Erud's Crossing drinking Tumpy Tonics. <br />
<br />
The gods could not long ignore the ruckus down below so they granted druids their, by now, heartfelt wish.<br />
<br />
*Sound of clicking as a ball and chain is fastened to skinny druid  ankles*<br />
<br />
Now you may have envisioned that you'd be patch healers, or rampage healers, skillfully dodging around and finding the weak and wounded and restoring them to vitality, while delivering blasts of natural energy to the nether regions of the enemy.  But no!  You see, we're all packed, ready for our AFK and we leave our raids in your capable hands.<br />
<br />
We have written up some very nice guides on how to run a cheal chain, there's lots of different ways.  I'm sure you'll find your own ways that suit your style.   Take good care of the tanks and if you have any problems be sure to pray to Tunare or Karana and we'll check for messages and get back to you.<br />
<br />
Have fun!  Toodles!<br />
<br />
*Puts on a gaudy, flowered Caftan, Raybans, flip-flops, trades in the res stick for a Tumpy Tonic served in a hollow coconut with a paper umbrella.  Tells the porter to bring the drum of sunscreen (high-elf, burns easily)*<br />

Honestly, I always worried about having to be useless unless I was in a chain heal gang, but now I know I won't have to.  I can hang out and work on my alcohol tolerance with good looking dwarves, all while having pleasant (if at that point hard to understand) conversations, and group nuking any mobs who decide to spoil the party.<br />

My heart feels lighter now.  I'm free.<br />

I still want holy water, but I'll settle for something blue that will go nicely on a sugar cube for the raid party... I'm sorry, I can't rez you, there is too much going on with my hand right now... damn, but my wisdom is up through the roof, though...</div></div><hr />

<br />
Dear Diary,<br />
<br />
Today I arrived in Erud's Crossing for my lengthy AFK with my fellow clerics.   It isn't quite what I had pictured.<br />
<br />
I look down the beach and all I see are these stumpy looking little men with white pasty chests, missing eyes and the ocassional missing ear, food stained beards, balding, doughy middles... Every last one of them strutting around in a speedo thinking he's Brell's gift to womankind.<br />
<br />
The cat-calls are horrendous, oh wait... those are the Kerrans, and I'm terrified to take off my Caftan.  It has FT3 and procs Stun, I might need it.   Well, I'll probably burn to a crisp in 30 seconds so I think I'd better stay covered up.<br />
<br />
I finally found the High Elven hang out.  They don't venture far from the shelter of the palm trees.  I didn't think it was possible for anyone to look worse in a speedo than a dwarf, but I think I'm ready to re-evaluate that opinion.  Too many of these guys must be living on summoned bread and water.  Either that or else I accidently wandered into an anorexia treatment clinic.  <br />
<br />
Oh, and of course, that strumpet Magdalena didn't lose any time taking off her coverup.  Of course, she's got a Sacred Bikini of Tunare so she was probably just dying to show it off.  Can you believe it, she's actually left the tags on it so people can see the stats?  And good Tunare, look at her chest.  That simply can't be natural.  I wonder if she made a trip to Ak'Anon for implants.<br />
<br />
Well, there's no way now I'm taking off this Caftan.  I've only got a Etheral Mist tank suit.  I could just die of embarassment.<br />
<br />
Goddess, I need a drink!</div></div><hr />

Ugh... Just look at those High Elves! Their Felwithe Tan is going to make some poor soul go blind. I see the dwarves and the erudites, but where are my Dark Elven brethren?<br />
<br />
Scanning the beaches, covered in pasty dwarf flesh like so many beached whales, I realize this is going to be a very long day...</div></div><hr />

I'm much better looking when I'm standing behind a bar with my apron on and mixer in hand. Our special of the day is a new drink of my own devising, the Telly Port. It's a heady blend of Elven Wine and Gypsy Wine, perfect for a day of lounging in the shade with the ocean breeze. Care for a taste? :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Well, things are a little better.  It's evening now and so I don't have to worry about taking off the Caftan.  Did I mention I hate Magdelena?  She's wearing a little number that barely covers up her Thong of Veeshan.  I hope she gets sand where it hurts most and fizzles.<br />
<br />
The dwarfs are actually pretty funny.  They're making drinks and calling them names like &quot;Telly Ports&quot; and &quot;Invisibility&quot;.  This one called me over and said it was time for a cleric like me to finally get &quot;Invisibility&quot; and he poured this frothy conconction into a coconut shell.  I drank about two sips of it and nearly passed out. Somehow I knew just then my alchohol tolerance increased to 2. <br />
<br />
I decided I wasn't going to hang out with the high elves.  They were just way to snooty for even me, and I are one.  It looks like the dwarves know how to have a good time. Only problem is they're having a limbo contest and I think I don't have a chance. <br />
<br />
Ha!  Wouldn't you know it.  A couple of unguilded druids tried to crash our party.  They claimed they could because they specialized in alteration. We got the troll guards to clamp them into the leg irons and shipped them off to a pick-up raid. <br />
<br />
I wondered why I hadn't seen the Dark Elves all day.  But I should've known they keep out of the sunlight pretty much.  They all dressed up in really weird costumes, drank EB potions and came pouring out of the ocean up the beach after dark acting like creatures from the black lagoon.  They started to punt the half dozen or so gnome clerics and were headed after the halflings, but a contingent of dwarves and high elves rousted them out.  <br />
<br />
Once we figured out it was just the dark elves feeling frisky and not actual monsters we all had a good laugh and a impromptu game of Gnomeball really broke the ice.  Broke the poor Gnome too, but there were plenty of res-sticks on hand to put him back almost as good as before.<br />
<br />
[Much, much later that night]<br />
<br />
Wal, here is my room and htis must be my bed.  No, thas the floor, over here this mus be the bed.   I don know why they spin these rooms around, i don like it.  That dworfkin kept telling me I was visable and kept saying I needed another invisibility potion.  I don remember why I had to be invisible all night long.  I think I need to send for the Resort's shaman, I feel sick.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Happy birthday to me. I need a drink. In other news, we started the party today. The dark elves stayed underwater all day, hiding from the sun, and the high elves hid under the trees, to keep from blinding anyone, but the rest of us were having a blast.<br />
<br />
Suprisingly, the humans and erudites were managing to hold their liquor quite well, almost as well as us dwarves. The gnomes weren't doing that great, but that was due to the halflings spiking their ale with water.<br />
<br />
Got a mixing contest started, we really came up with some outlandish concotions. I dunno what Brodder slipped into that mix of his, but it sure did go down smooth, one you got past the 4 foot flames shooting outta it. my &quot;invisibility&quot; sure seemed to be a hit, especially with that high elf in the corner. Wonder if she noticed that her dress kept fading out of view? [note to self, work on formula a bit... effects are supposed to last longer than a minute.]<br />
<br />
the luau and barbeque went fairly well, came in second place in limbo contest. unfortunately, also came in second place against a tree when I tried to mix that stuff of Brodder's with some double stout.... woke up three hours later tied to palm tree, and painted to look like a coconut.</div></div><hr />

Next to the pot is an unfortunate Darkelf still dressed up in his undersea seashell  monster costume and Brodder's favorite club.

=================<br />
<br />
Well I have to admit it was fun for a while hearing all the stories about druids and their newly found complete heal aggro :) But with most of the other clerics at the resort the rezz tells were getting a little much.<br />
<br />
So I decided I needed a break and got a wizard to port me to the resort.<br />
<br />
I've never seen so many clerics in one place. Dwarves, High Elves, even Humans and Gnomes. No Dark Elves which is a little unusual.<br />
<br />
As I made my way to my hut I feel really overdressed. It's been a long time since I walked around without armour, so walking around in it surrounded by almost naked bodies is a little weird.<br />
Luckily there's are a few shops around, so I grab myself a modest outfit and change out of my armour.<br />
<br />
Stroll down to the beach with a blanket and something to eat and drink. The dwarves are going mad across the beach, running around with flasks of booze. Having sampled a few of their concoctions in my time I steer clear. One dwarf offers me a drink and seems quite upset when I decline, but when I kneel in front of him and give him a playful kiss on the cheek I swear his beard goes red and runs off with an insanely huge grin on his face.<br />
<br />
Watch the dwarves practising for a limbo contest, I didn't realise they were so flexible. Mind you they aren't shy about mentioning all their abilities to any female that goes past. I'm guessing some of them must have put alternate xp into dexterity and agility going by some of their claims.<br />
<br />
Some of the women here are wearing some stunning outfits, I didn't realise bikini sets dropped in high level zones. Guess that's something a pickup group cleric at 55 misses out on. The High Elves look stunning, but they stick to themselves so I don't feel so bad after that.<br />
But I must look around the bazaar sometime for a really good outfit. After avoiding amourous dwarves all day I make a mental note to concentrate on AC for my outfit.<br />
<br />
Late afternoon rolls by and the dwarves hold the limbo contest. I have to be impressed how the dwarves can drink so much and still move. Not in straight lines granted, but it's impressive never the less.<br />
<br />
As darkness falls a number of fires are lit, gnomes start pulling out weird contraptions called bar-b-ques to cook a variety of fish on. Some of the clerics there are obviously expert cooks, there are a variety of excellent fish dishes to choose from.<br />
<br />
As I'm resting from the food a cry goes up from the beach ! Rising from the water are a number of weird mobs, surrounded by glowing lights and moaning in high pitched voices. Damn I wish I was wearing my armour !<br />
As I try to remember my hammer spells the mobs start chasing after the smaller races. It's then I realise that some of the mobs are rather large in the chest area. Suddenly a dwarf yells &quot;It's the Dark Elves, get 'em !&quot; and runs past me swinging a glowing hammer. I then realise the Dark Elves have dressed up and are having an invasion.<br />
<br />
In the ensuing chaos the &quot;invasion&quot; is defeated by a force led by the Dwarves and High Elves. They might not get along but they fight well together. I even managed to get a few increases in melee skills myself.<br />
After the healing and rezzing was finished I was feeling a little tired so I headed back to my hut. On the way back I ran into a Dark Elf who seemed a little drunk but was kind of cute in small, dark and handsome way. We talked for about half an hour, he seemed quite nice and even gave me his room number before heading off to the beach after hearing there was a game of Gnomeball going on.<br />
<br />
I might contact him in the morning. Well I am on holiday ;)<br />

What could be better?  Well, maybe if they had a bank on this island, but a few leasurly heals to people dying cyclops bashing should keep the drinks going.  And I brought my spit to keep roasting stuff.<br />
<br />
Maybe with enough sun, some heals to counter burning, and enough of these wonderful (if heavy) pastries the halflings brought, I'll finally loose my pasty white thiness.

9:00<br />
Luclin style breakfast featuring  Centi omlettes with Owlbear eggs in a Mons Lentil sauce.  Prepared Hotel Style: i.e. cooked into an unrecognizable mush and served at room temperature with a distictive taste of stern-o.<br />
<br />
10:00<br />
Are Clerics Obsolete?<br />
Meeting Begins with a Panel Discussion of the changes to priest healing.   Panel includes Brodder Foamymugs, if we can sober him up in time, Scirroco -- Guest druid, on temporary leave from the cheal gang, Smashrite Marshtrotter -- a warlord who has survived a druid cheal chain, Pompus John the Third -- a Paladin, we're not sure why he's here.  This is likely to be a lively debate.  We request that you turn your Celestial pagers off, or put them on silent-mode, and that you refrain from summoning hammers, pets and food (for hurling).  Anyone being excessively disruptive will be removed from the meeting by Rayne.<br />
<br />
11:30-12:00<br />
Break.  Now's the time to check in with your *Gods for any messages from the druids.  Conduct impromptu purification rituals, blood sacrifices and hold mini-masses.  We've set aside facilities for all religions and a quiet, non-denominational, contemplation room for those of you experiencing spiritual doubts.<br />
<br />
We ask that you DO NOT write messages in blood on the walls, and leave no flaming words or symbols burning anywhere unattended.  The Hotel will bill us for cleaning charges and damages.<br />
<br />
12:00-1:00<br />
Lunch:  Misty Thicket box lunches will be provided.<br />
<br />
1:15-4:00<br />
Mass Beseechment for Restoration of Clerics<br />
We will use this time to pray, chant and otherwise hound the *Gods, to restore us to favor in the eyes of our peer groups.  It worked for the druids, perhaps we can learn from them.  <br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jenoe</div><div class="date">09-30-2002, 02:55 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well its nice to know you clerics are enjoying your &quot;vacation&quot;, but for others (namely us druids) this little vanishing act of yours have turned norrath into the pit of doom. <br />
<br />
There was suddenly a healing gap that needed filling so apparently all the other classes had a emergency meeting to decide what to do, well when I say &quot;all&quot; that isnt really true. The warriors still hadnt figured out the door opens out and not in, the rogues where to busy stealing everything and the kitchen sink, the rangers where teasing the monks about archery damage, the bards claim their entire class was &quot;broke&quot; and couldnt come and the mages and the necros where having on of those &quot;I'm more bitter than you&quot; whine sessions.<br />
<br />
So basicly, the wizards decided what do do (well some of them, the rest where busy trying to get pointy hats and shouting that they wherent balance until they had them). We now know that the cleric class was behind the whole plot against the druid class but thats not really important, what is important is the fact that after the meeting the wizards got all the other classes fall in (manaburn makes alot of people see things your way).<br />
<br />
Anyway enough about that, my story starts in wee hours of the morning in western wastes. I had just finished of tantor and was feeling pretty good about myself and because of that I wasnt paying as much attention to track as perhaps I should have. Suddenly someone dispells me and starts to smack me around, i tried to get away but alas there was no way I could outrun my assailent without soe. Everything goes dark as my health fades and the next thing I remember is that I'm being carried somewhere, my feet and hands bound with some bowstring.<br />
<br />
After perhaps half an hour we enter some kind of camp and my captor stops to speak with someone he refers to as &quot;boss&quot;. This &quot;boss&quot; person calls for someone else and the last thing I hear before I drift away into the darkness is &quot;take him to the bazaar and drop him off, we have filled our quota now&quot;.<br />
<br />
I wake up in the bazaar while my captor and some enchanter is haggling for a price for something. I catch small bits and pieces of their conversation <br />
<br />
&quot;dont want anymore of those asslings, soloers every last one of them...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, pickings are getting scares, but the wee ones are of hardier stock than the woodelves or the humans, can take alot of punishment before they go down&quot;<br />
<br />
They seem to come to some kinda agreement and the enchanter hands over a heavy purse and motions to one of the troll guards to pick me up. I find myself dangling in the air while the enchanter pokes me with his little snake stick.<br />
<br />
&quot;hmmm good ac, maxed defense I wager, very well get him in irons and put him with the rest, there will be a buyer coming by in a few minutes&quot;<br />
<br />
Wearing chains im placed with some other halflings behind a sign that says &quot;never have so much healing been found in such a small package, get your halfing druids today&quot;, the enchanter comes by and waves his hand and my whole body freezes and I hear him say &quot;My customers prefer the vacent look on my merchandise, nothing personal&quot;<br />
<br />
He walks away but return after a short few minutes while im still trying to fight the effects of the mez (and failing miserably at it). With him are some other persons decked out in truly uber gear, they must be the buyers but I cant for the life of me understand why they would want us, we cant heal, heck i havent healed anything since my thirties. The mez is starting to slip and they are getting closer, as they walk by I lunge for the hand of one of them and try to bite but the enchanter is too fast and reapply the mez before I can inflict any damage.<br />
<br />
&quot;haha, spirited little things they are, some of the best ones so far imho&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;A little to spirited perhaps, we cant raid with a healing force that will fight us at every turn&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Dont worry about that, one whif of the rods and they will be nice and calm&quot;<br />
<br />
One of the ubers pokes me some and stares at me for the longest time, almost feels like he is looking at every piece of gear i have.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hmmm so how is his wis, any ft or aa I should know about?&quot;<br />
<br />
The junior uber suddenly looks up from his clipboard and asks<br />
<br />
&quot;whats his spec?&quot;<br />
<br />
I try to shout &quot;evocation, I cant heal, I like to burn things, quadding makes me warm and fuzzy inside&quot; but the words that are coming outta my mouth says &quot;alteration kind sirs, I love to heal, only thing I have ever done&quot;. The enchanter smiles smugly or that might just be how he looks normally, him being high elf and all.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well that settles that then, I'll take the lot&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Very good sir, how would you like to pay, cash or items? And will you be taking them now, otherwise we do make deliveries to all of the known world&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I think we better take them right now, late for a kael raid and all that&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Excellent choice for a initial raid if i may say so sir, it might take alittle time for them to adjust fully&quot;<br />
<br />
We are taken to the velious teleporter and soon we are in great divide, I find myself shackled with some grizzled old halfling druids.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey new kid, welcome to hell&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What are you talking about, where are we going?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Raiding, kael i think it was, Hey Turig what are we gonna hit?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Vindi and perhaps tormax I think, nothing major&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So there you have it kid, just keep your head down and do what you are told and you will get outta this alive or atleast get a rez, the ones that mess up dont&quot;<br />
<br />
From the back of the column there are shouts of &quot;R3l34s3 m3, j00 guys sux00rs&quot;. The old halfling just shakes his head &quot;another of those l33t d00ds, he wont make it far&quot;<br />
<br />
So we start marching towards kael and the only sound is the sound of our footsteps in the snow and the shouts of &quot;ph34r m3, ph34r m3&quot; from the back of the column...</div></div><hr />

<br />
I've been busy taking turns on the BT (Bar Tending) rotation with some of the other dwarfs...we have a drink-mixing contest going on, and I don't foresee a winner anytime soon. You see, we've been judging it by sampling each other's wares between turns behind the bar. The last drink I tried was Brodder's...I can't tell you exactly what it was or what it tasted like, but I woke up this morning on the floor, under a pile of empty steins. It must have been pretty good for me to make repeat orders. I still had my clothes on though, so I can only give it an 8.5.<br />
<br />
Today Gniss had the bar for a while, no doubt he's been slipping more &quot;Invisibilities&quot; to the ladies. The high elves and Erudites get all embarassed when they notice the effect, but the dark elves don't seem to mind. It's a shame that folk so beautiful have to be so...tall.<br />
<br />
I figured I'd go off and do something different today. Sun on the beach and all that gets tiring if one does too much of it. My search for a diversion ended when I found some of the halfling lads dealing a hand of King's Court. The dealer was rather odd...he looked like any other halfling, but he was always grinning, and for some reason the halflings were treating him more respectfully than they do most people. I never did catch his name, &quot;Fizz&quot; something or other. Nothing like a friendly game to pass the afternoon, right? So I dealt myself in, and it's a good thing I had left my armor elsewhere or I probably would have lost that too. So much for all my tips from the bar. Solusek's eyes, I swear that dealer could cheat the tail off an Iksar! I'll have to see if I can get my money back in a drinking contest with him later on...</div></div><hr />

<br />
Today is day 3 and my Caftan really needs a wash, I knew I should've looted another one rather than let it rot.  I have a pair of Fetid Gorilla Hide Bermuda Shorts and a Halter Top of Celestial Seasonings, but I haven't worn them since I was level 12.  I'll just end up looking like an escapee from a Annette Funicelli movie.  <br />
<br />
I'm gloating a little today.  Magdalena is so horribly sunburned she's in the infirmary wrapped in gooey bandages.  The Shaman is treating her and you know how messy witch doctors can be.  It'll be days before she's back to the AFK.  I assisted the Shaman a little while he was mixing up the salve for Magda's burns.  He forgot to put in the extract of spicy peppers, so while he was out looking for bandages I corrected his oversight. <br />
<br />
Poor Magda's burns must be horrible, her screams are deafening.<br />
<br />
The program yesterday was pretty good.  I really didn't anticipate the riot during the first session.  The poor druid and paladin were duct-taped to the ceiling and someone pushed an enormous vat of guacamole under them... so when the tape finally gives they're going to do a belly flop into the avocado dip. <br />
<br />
Despite the warning against it someone thought it'd be really funny to have a disembodied hand write stuff on the walls.  Even worse, they did it in the non-denominational room.   It wrote, in flaming letters:  Mene, Mene, Tekel, Upharsin, which we think means: It has been counted and counted, weighed and divided.  I'm not sure but I think that's some sort of reference to &quot;class balancing&quot;.<br />
<br />
The dinner and magicians were very good.  I stayed away from the invisibility potions tonight.  And those darned mage pets kept blowing up everyone's skirts.  And a few of the dwarves are running around without a stitch on.  The air pets had a good old time with them.   Frankly, I think people should dress for dinner!</div></div><hr />

One of the bards saved the day by choreographing a line dance, teaching each druid to cast at the proper time, in turn.  Thank goodness for KEI.<br />

Things were going fine after that.  Until one of the druids cast the wrong spell and ported out the entire Cheal team...</div></div><hr />

Things had been going fine, although people were getting edgy from the constant repetition of &quot;boomshakalaka-boomshakalaka-boomshakalaka-BOOM&quot; (the BOOM was a clever idea of the bard.  Druids like BOOM)<br />
<br />
So the silence was deafening when the CHeal team ported out.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Several hours later, the line dance was back in full swing.  Then, at odd times, for no apparent reason, one of the chain gang would get out of step.  This occurred at random intervals to all of them at some time or another.<br />
<br />
One of the rangers gazed at them thoughtfully, then strode over to the raid leader and whispered something in his ear.<br />
<br />
The raid leader immediately ordered that the &quot;forage&quot; hotkey be removed from all druids.<br />
<br />
One of the druids hissed &quot;Traitor!&quot; at the ranger.  The ranger shrugged, walking away, nocking another arrow in his bow...</div></div><hr />

Dear Diary,<br />
<br />
It's Day 4 of the AFK and we had a tragic loss today.  Magdalena passed away from her sunburn getting infected.   Many think it is odd that someone could get an infected sunburn.  They also find it odd that her corpse is no where to be found so she can be ressurrected.  We pray they find her corpse before it is too late to restore her to life!<br />
<br />
*throws a shovel into the ocean*<br />
<br />
In happier news we finally convinced Brodder to wear a belt and tuck his beard into the belt in the back.  So now he has something of a loin cloth, or g-string, albeit made of his beard.<br />
<br />
I had several visions from Tunare.  She's not entirely happy with me at the moment.  She blames me for Magdalena's problems.  She also wants me to teach the druids to count.  Really!  I am beginning to have some spiritual doubts.  I wonder if Karana is a more reasonable God to work for?  Or perhaps a God that doesn't hold truck with druids at all, like Rodicet.  Roddy seems quite reasonable.<br />
<br />
Oddly this morning when I woke up I realized my caftan was missing and there was a pile of ash in the middle of my floor.  I never heard of clothing spontaneously combusting before.  Granted it hasn't been washed in quite some time now.  Either that or another cleric took offense to the state of my caftan.  Or...  could this be a message from Tunare?  Today the clothes, tomorrow me?  <br />
<br />
Well, I guess I'm going to be wearing the bermudas and halter top now.  I might as well put my hair into pig-tails for all that I'm going to look level 12 again.  /sigh</div></div><hr />

Good thing I turn out delectable pies and delicious picnics.  My holy cake is quite a big hit as well as the chocolate chip cookies.  <br />
<br />
Sitting next to the oven in this heat is not my idea of a great time, but the drinks are cold and plentiful.  I have noticed that its best to steer clear of the dwarven brews, they appear to either be to strong for my delicate palatte or prone to cause side effects.<br />
<br />
I decided to wear my Onyx Chain Bikini over a flowing caftan due to the heat.  Hopefully no one will shun my fashion for being an expansion old.  Thankfully its modest style hides my tatoo's.  For I fear I would be in grave trouble if those were spotted.  The right hip says &quot;Oracle Lover&quot; the left hip says &quot;Chain Leader&quot;.  I am not to sure how those would be received, thus if I dont move over much and wrap this lovely Imbued Tunarian Sarong around me, it should be covered.<br />
<br />
I have watched the late night romps with the &quot;invading&quot; inkys.  As well as the scantily clad dwarfs.  I find this all rather fun and relaxing, but the ceaseless partying has no appeal to me.  Instead I retire to my modest cabin at an early hour.

Staggering to his bare feet he glances about at the collection of Clerics sunbathing, drinking and generally having a great time.<br />
<br />
Raising a bloody hand he barely mouths the words: &quot;Is there a Cleric here....&quot; before passing out to exhaustion.<br />
<br />
With a mad rush and much spilling of drink and suntan oil the assembled healers of Norrath make an instinctual lemming rush to help the obviously wounded man.<br />
<br />
The resulting Tsunami of heals, elixers, and remedies, along with the 'Dwarven Solution' (to bathe the poor man in various libations while trying to get as much down his throat as possible) results in a healthy, albeit nearly naked Monk (much to the entertainment of those females with a peaked libido and a thing for 'Grandmasters') who offers heartfelt thanks.<br />
<br />
&quot;I banked nearly everything except food, water, and some bandages. Killed some sharks and ate them. By Quellious this place is hard to find. Oh by the way. there's a whole slew of Dark Elves back there.&quot; He jerks a thumb over his shoulder indicating the SCUBA diving minions of Innorruuk.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well lad - out with it! What brings ye here?&quot; One crusty, very drunk, and very sunburnt Dwarf manages to spit the question as heads nod in agreement.<br />

&quot;It's not working out,&quot; the Monk begins getting to his feet and testing his arms. &quot;Tunare bless their tree-humping hearts, they just don't get it.&quot;<br />

&quot;The druids you mean?&quot; Asks one High Elf female who hasn't raised her gaze above his waist until she poses this question.<br />
<br />
&quot;Erm yes,&quot; slightly embarrased, the Monk continues. &quot;They nuke when they should heal, they Dot when they should snare, they...&quot;<br />
<br />
Here he pauses...<br />
<br />
&quot;Well!?&quot; The Dwarf again. Patience was never a virtue of the stumpy ones.<br />
<br />
&quot;They just don't...'get it' &quot; he finally admits in a humble tone.<br />

&quot;By the Tranquil no!&quot; The Monk counters.<br />

Clad in my Vah Shir thong and jacket, my long high elven legs beginning to form a tan, I stroll along the beach rather enjoying the wonderful vacation here. Silly druids, they got what they asked for...didnt they. *a smirk crawls across my face and i giggle softly* Clerics couldnt have asked for a more wonderful &quot;upgrade&quot;, at least now we get the time off we soooo deserved!  I wonder how those druids are enjoying those chains and chants so much now...*stares off dreamily at the white buffy clouds passing by*</div></div><hr />

I've been looking for a picture of someone in a caftan, not having any luck.  And also a pair of those sun glasses, you know, the ones with guady jewels around the frames and turned up at the corner?</div></div><hr />

Well, we druids finally got our wishes, we got a CHeal spell.  I thought I would be elated to see it go into effect, even though it's not truly a CHeal, but it works for the most part.  I've begun grouping again and I find myself the center of attention from all the new mobs in the dungeons who have rarely seen a druid fighting there.  I'm trying to make Old Sebilis my home away from home.  My SoE is useless here and I'm currently sitting in a damp dingy corner that smells of dwarven ale and elven starch for some strange reason.  I thought I would love it, I really did...I figured, hey, I can group again, I haven't done this on a regular basis since I was level 35.  What I truly didn't realize was how exceedingly BORING it is to be the one healing everyone.<br />
<br />
I've got new battle wounds to add to the scars that tell of my failed quad attempts.  Using a new heal to top off the snare that I just popped on that froglok really makes them mad.  To put it bluntly, they ripped me a new one.  And I can't rez myself...but yet, there are no clerics to be found.  Tunare only knows where those clerics have run off to...<br />
<br />
I wind up crying myself to sleep most nights and think of going back to the way things were, when I sat my tree-hugging butt down in Cobalt Scar and quadded those otters for all they were worth.  Hell, I didn't specialize in alteration...I'm a nuking druid, for crying out loud!  I only toss in the occasional spot heal when the cleric is getting beat on.  Now I'm the one getting beat on with noone to spot heal me except the paltry paladin sitting over there with this smug look on his face.  I just want to see wildfire coursing over his skin to wipe that smirk off his face.  He knows I'm scared, he knows I don't want to be here, he knows...<br />
<br />
Where did I go wrong?  What did I do to deserve this burden atop my shoulders?  Tunare help me...</div></div><hr />

==============<br />
<br />
Life is good. I was a little worried yesterday when I started going brown and none of my cure spells helped, but apparently this happens when you're outside without armour on for any length of time. Who knew ?<br />
<br />
I've been meeting some of the other clerics on the island recently. I bumped into the famous Electrae on the beach yesterday. She was skipping along the beach, spade in hand. I didn't realise making sand castles was so much fun, I must try it.<br />
<br />
And I've seen Brodder, what a fine figure of a dwarf he is. I even shared a beer with him. My alcohol tolerance is improving, I think I was only out for about 20 minutes. I'll chat to him more, but he was very busy playing with some gnolls the last time I saw him.<br />
<br />
We had a little excitement yesterday when a man arrived on the beach. He staggered up the beach and collapsed while asking for our help. There were that many casting messages I thought the island zone would crash at one point.<br />
I later learnt that he's a monk who wants to join us here. He's been made the &quot;Official Masseuse to the Female Clerics&quot;. From what I've heard he's rather good, so that'll be an interesting few hours <br />
<br />
/em looks at her numbered ticket and grins<br />
<br />
I'm looking forward to tonights party. The Dark Elf I met on the first night has asked to accompany me to the festivities. We spent hours swopping stories and sipping cocktails last night, I've not felt so comfortable around somebody for a long time.<br />
I did ask him about if he thought his god would approve , he just said &quot;He hates it&quot; and winked at me.<br />
<br />
Weird, but I like him *dreamy smile*<br />
<br />
/em Looks at the piles of clothes scattered around the room<br />
<br />
Hmm , what should I wear tonight ...<br />

Thick and heavy, that should make me safe from the shackels.<br />

Goes into my hut and prepare a big batch of the barbarian special of &quot;Icy Sun Lotion&quot; - Be red, be brown, be burned but stay cool.<br />
<br />
/puts on shades <br />
<br />
Calls on a wizard cab, seems there are no druids left for ports anymore. Wizard charges a rediculus amount of money but I pay up since I think it will be worth it<br />
<br />
I end up on a beach with the great ocean before me.<br />
Wizard mumbels that somewhere out there is the Cleric Haven and disapperas in a cloud of fire. <br />
<br />
Now how did he do that?<br />
<br />
/Shrug<br />
<br />
Well I pull out my pet and and gets my breathing corrected for water. Thank The Tribunal for all the swimming lessons I took in the Halas pond when I was younger. This shouldnt take too long<br />
<br />
After some time swiming I come up on a group of dark elfs but they seems to be busy with a burnt High Elf body, doing some gross things. I take a detour so I dont attract attention to me<br />
<br />
Soon after I can see the beach, full of dwarfs kicking a gnome around in some insane game. Lucky for the gnome there alot of healers there.<br />
<br />
As I come up on the beach a ruddy dwarf apporches me with a big smile.<br />
<br />
-Ahhh a witchy doctores, you need too try this wonderful healing potion I have made, its for free, a welcome gift. <br />
<br />
As I drink it my head begins to spin in directions I never thought existed. My vision blurs and I can feel a strange smile stealing over my stone face. <br />
<br />
Powerful drink, i think too myself, thought my alcoholic tolerance were at maximum. <br />
<br />
As I look around I see alot of female Human and High Elf clerics stare at my waist line with big eyes. I look down and see that I some how have turned naked.<br />
<br />
The dwarfs roll on the beach laughing as my face turn red. <br />
<br />
I am a barbarian and I am proud of my bodys strength and big build, but its private! I promptly sit down and puts my backpack over the more privat parts.<br />
<br />
Soon after my cloth returns and the dwarf with the strange drink apporches again.<br />
- no hard feelings my big booned friend? and laughes out load. This place is for relaxsation and fun, try not to take life to seriusly.<br />
<br />
I smile at him<br />
- no sir, Im here with some lotion to help with sunburns.<br />
<br />
-Bless Brell, that will come in handy, come with my my friend, I ill introuduce you to the rest.<br />

<br />
She thinks she has a tan! With the sun behind her you can nearly see through that transparent skin.<br />
<br />
Ah well, the night life is nearly beginning. After the Tie'dal SCUBA lessons led by the gnomes culminated in a beautiful float along the reef, I hop out of the water in my skin tight wetsuit to see high elves -- yup, getting all high and mighty.<br />
<br />
Nothing ever changes.<br />
<br />
Me and several other dark elves shuck off our wetsuits and make our way, laughing, to the bonfire circle. Some of the clerics have taken to spear fishing and clam collecting, so the nightly faire will begin with our steamed dinner straight from the ocean.<br />
<br />
We began this bonfire in the hopes we could enjoy our stay away from the harsh sun and also the attitudes of those who do not understand the Dark Elf persuasion. However word of our festivals has gotten around and soon clerics of all persuasions begin to arrive.<br />
<br />
WHOOSH!<br />
<br />
Ah Calae, the rare evocation cleric, has started the bonfire. Some of the more colorful folk have joined in the fun, and soon the entire cleric community is here, laughing drinking and having a good time.<br />
<br />
I step up to the speaking stone, and clear my throat. The audience falls silent and turns toward me.<br />
<br />
&quot;Dark elves for eons have been shunned by the cleric community, and innuendo has always been made in our presence. Yet tonight, we feel close with the family of clerics. I would like to thank you all for coming and making us feel welcome.&quot;<br />
<br />
The audience claps and cheers. &quot;You put on a good party!&quot; shouted one dwarf, and a round of laughter agreed with him.<br />
<br />
I motion for the audience to quiet down, and silence falls once again.<br />
<br />
&quot;I feel grateful, so I must do a favor in return. While we were diving we came upon a dead high elf. We were going to dissect her and feed her entrails to the fire, however I am feeling rather generous tonight, and in the spirit of friendship, the Dark Elven clerics will ressurect this mysterious person.&quot;<br />
<br />
Five robed dark elves appear with a body, draped in a white sheet, and place it upon the speaking stone. The light between the five glows blue, and the body rises slightly from the ground. The air hums with magic, and soon the body convulses, and the mystery woman goans and coughs up seawater.<br />
<br />
On wobbling hands and knees she takes her first breath.<br />
<br />
&quot;Who are you dear? What is your name?&quot;<br />
<br />
She looks up at me in fear, then out at the assembled crowd.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ma.... Magda... *cough* Magdalena.&quot;</div></div><hr />

&quot;Would you please take me to Nektolous before going over there?&quot;<br />
&quot;Sure madame, that makes 100 pp extra tho&quot;<br />
&quot;It's ok I'll pay for that...&quot;<br />

You tell Innoruuk: &quot;If things keep going this way I'll get one year vacation by the time I can lay myself on the beach~&quot;<br />
Innoruuk tells you: &quot;lol&quot;<br />
<br />
From my hometown forest, I reach my house and open the sekret door under the rugs... &quot;Come outside, I need you for a while, my hated slave, I hate you so much, you gonna pay for everything you did&quot;<br />
&quot;But I did nothing oh Great One!&quot;<br />
&quot;Shut up, I hate you anyway&quot;<br />
<br />
Innoruuk tells you: &quot;oh, come on!&quot;<br />
<br />
I drag my slave outside my house and proceed to examine his spellbook: &quot;Mmmm ok, cancel this... this... this.... you can keep this and that&quot;<br />
*Slave sighs<br />
&quot;Ok Mr. Cab, bring us to the sea now!&quot;<br />
&quot;Another people coming madame? this will influence the price.... 1000 pp for both&quot;<br />
&quot;I hate you, but ok...*sighs&quot;<br />
<br />
You tell Innoruuk: &quot;I hate too many people today&quot;<br />

&quot;Enjoy your vacation madame, for every travel need, be sure to contact the our taxi service&quot;<br />
&quot;$&amp;*@!!&quot;<br />
Wizzy fades away<br />
<br />
After this long travel, I finally reach the AFK club, I see things I didn't expect, except some silly dwarf that tries to &quot;inspect&quot; my bikini. A soft slap make him fall down to the ground... and he happily smiles and drink something he just found in his pocket. Ahh I love these dwarfs, always so &quot;friendly&quot; with me...<br />
<br />
As I approach the beach, all those high elves chicks begins to turn green with envy... <br />
/thinks hehe, they are all burned by the sun, they just want to look like me<br />
<br />
*sticks her tongue to high elves chicks<br />
<br />
30 minutes after I lay down my sexy butt on the sand... it begins to rain!<br />
People start to whine, when suddendly I say them: &quot;I may have a solutions, don't go away !&quot; Note: some dwarfs didn't even noticed it was raining, what did they drink?<br />
<br />
&quot;Why do you think I let you come down here silly wood elf?&quot;<br />
&quot;No clue really milady&quot;<br />
*sigh<br />
&quot;Remember the spell I left in your book?&quot;<br />
&quot;Yes milady&quot;<br />
&quot;Wanna use it? would be nice...&quot;<br />
&quot;But we can't force the nature's behaviour, the trees need water from time to time&quot;<br />
*gently pats the Horrifying Whip of Woodelf Slaying in her backpack.<br />
&quot;Err....Sure milady, just a sec.... memming&quot;<br />
Woodelf slave begins to cast a spell<br />
It stops raining<br />
High elves start looking at me... raising an eyebrow!<br />
<br />
/whispers: &quot;Never go on holyday with your personal druid along, just be sure to cancel some ports here and there from their spellbook ;) &quot;<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Cali</div><div class="date">10-04-2002, 10:33 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">ah morning!  <br />
<br />
The sun sitting softly upon the horizon, hovering over the sea, coating the beach in a light pink glow.  I slowly make my way from my hut to the oven, happy to have gotten the much needed rest.   While the party lasted late into the night, I had planned ahead and acquired some amazing earplugs from the local gnome.  Stepping carefully over the prone bodies of the late night party goers who just couldnt seem to find their beds I smiled softly.  Ah what fun clerics can have when freed from the chains that bind them.<br />
<br />
Settling down at the oven I get to work with my latest supplies, delivered by bard this morning.  Poor thing is still asleep in my hut, she ran all night long just to deliver my foodstuffs.<br />
<br />
Several busy minutes later I now have four different types of omelette slowly bubbling in my prized non stick fry pans.  Griffon, bear, lion and snake should please quite a few people but what to make for those really picky eaters?  Scrambled wurm eggs and dragon steak should serve well to those hungry humans and dwarves.  Fruit pie and Emerald Orange Juice shall go well for the picky high elves.  Hot Cross Buns for the erudites, chocolate muffins for the gnomes, jum jum cake for halflings and hot &amp; spicy toelings for the few dark elves that may be hungry.<br />
<br />
As the smells begin to permeate the air the sun climbs higher and higher.  I sit down with a bite of fruit and sip of tea while the rest of the camp begins to awaken.   As the table before the oven fills with food, clerics begin stumbling slowly to find the source of the smells that awoke them.  Putting that monk to work, who tried to sneak in for a pinch of dragon steak early, now he passes out plates to everyone.  <br />
<br />
Thankfull that this batch should hold everyone till the noon meal I slip back next to the oven and open my book.  Finding a mostly blank page, I compose my letter.<br />
<br />
My dearest LB,<br />
<br />
Thank you for encouraging me to visit Club Meditation.  (Club Med to the regulars.)  This has been quite a relaxing trip and I am feeling quite refreshed.  I do miss our trips to Chardok with our friends, as well as our quiet journeys alone in Seru.  Perhaps I can return early and we can visit that little room in the Katta church that we liked so much?  <br />
<br />
I hope everyone is doing well, I know the guild has enough druids to be just fine on the upcoming raids.  I hope they assign one to you while your on slow duty.  <br />
<br />
Its quite amazing here.  There are dark elves playing shark in the lagoon.  Halflings running about and hiding in shrubs, Humans playing catch with a spare pie tin in the sand, Erudites surfing on the crystal blue waters, Gnomes getting punted by mostly naked dwarves and haughty high elves trying not to get to sunburned.  None of them have commented on my expansion old fashion, thankfully!  <br />
<br />
We did have a bit of a scuffle with some gobblins but it was swiftly handled by a sharp dwarf.   Also last night a high elf got resurrected during the dark elf ceremony, I heard all about it over the breakfast chatter.  She is some trollop named Magdalena I guess.  I think one of the other high elf women snapped.  Glad I keep to myself at times. <br />
<br />
Tonight is the Gnome Ceremony.  I think I shall stay up and watch the fireworks that are sure to be wonderful.   I shall write all about it too you tomorrow!  Wish you could be here darling, though I know how you hate fetching foodstuffs for me, I do need a dishwasher as always.  Be safe my dear and please dont get hurt to badly by the druids.  I shall be sending this back with the bard and I hope to hear from you soon.<br />
<br />
All my love,<br />
~Cali<br />
Club Med Chef <br />
<br />
My letter done, I rip the page from my book, spells and all.  I slip through the crowd of happily fed clerics and into my hut.  I rouse the sleeping bard in grey armor and hand her a picnic basket.  &quot;For your journey dear.  Please deliver the letter to my love post haste.&quot;  Thanking her for the supplies and blessing her journey I send the bard off.  <br />
<br />
Ah, now with the morning chores done, what shall I do for the rest of the day?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tommara</div><div class="date">10-04-2002, 12:08 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I awoke from my long sleep and found the world a vastly different place.  Again.<br />
<br />
I shook my blonde ponytail - no wait.  That's gone.  It disappeared the last time I went to sleep.  Never did find out what happened to it.  Need to be more careful where I fall asleep.<br />
<br />
Some things never change though.  I ran into an old friend, Macabe, in the Nexus.  I snuck up behind him and said &quot;Boo!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ack!&quot;  he said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ack?&quot;  I said.<br />
<br />
&quot;A ghost!&quot; he said.<br />
<br />
Oh, he's so silly.  We've known each other for a very long time.  People often confuse him with a dark elf, but he's actually a smurf.  I notice that he still isn't feeding his pet very well, it's still all skin and bones.  Well, maybe just bones.  So I summon him some food and hand it to him, which he accepts gravely. <br />
<br />
He starts to tell me about some of the changes in the world, which is all very confusing.  Taking pity on me, he shows me where I can buy a shiny new toy.  I like new toys.  Alas, it's a hammer.  I don't really know what to with it. But it's quite pretty, so I carry it. <br />
<br />
Out of the corner of my eye, I could see that the ranger is still following me.  She doesn't like me very much, claims I stunted her growth or something, but she follows me around a lot anyway.  She *is* very short, but I don't know why she thinks I had anything to do with it.<br />
<br />
I didn't realize the full extent of the changes until I got a tell from someone wanting me to join them for an exp group - in Hate.  In Hate?  An exp group?  And why can't they find any clerics to go to Hate?<br />
<br />
I started asking around and finally found out.<br />
<br />
Woot!  I packed my bags and ditched the ranger - although that would only last until her brother druid shows up.  Those two can track me down anywhere.  Oh, wait, maybe he won't be showing up this time, bwahahaha!<br />
<br />
I arrive at Club Med, looking forward to peaceful meditation and communion with Tunare.  Um, no, scratch the meditation part, don't wanna do that anymore.<br />
<br />
What an incredibly beautiful place!  So fitting a place to contemplate, in one of Tunare's most beautiful creations.<br />
<br />
I change out of my armor into a nice, freshly starched robe, pinning the heavily starched veil in place, sighing in contentment.  I grab up my beads and my Spirit Tome and head down to join my fellow clerics.<br />
<br />
And find the most disgraceful display of debauchery that I have ever witnessed.<br />
<br />
&quot;ACK!&quot;  I screech.  &quot;WHERE'S MY RULER!!!&quot;  After first checking to make sure that Sirmodi wasn't there.  He's very high strung like so many other paladins, and has an odd fixation on rulers, poor dear.  The minute he sees my ruler he starts chanting excitedly &quot;RULAH!  RULAH!  RULAH!&quot;<br />
<br />
I jump up on the table, and rip off the duct tape pinning two unfortunates to the ceiling.<br />
<br />
Note to self:  Before releasing things from the ceiling, check beneath it.  If there's a bowl of green goo, don't do it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
There were several strange situations occuring in Norrath simultaneously.  They had to be related, but how?  I knew there had to be a connection somewhere, but I just hadn't had the time to think what with all the porting I had been doing lately.  Yes, it all had to tie together.<br />
<br />
And it was important.  Very important.  Maybe important enough to set aside the hunt for that nimwit Al'Kabor....maybe even important enough to put a hold to Project Pointy Hat (why IS it so difficult to design a pointy hat that doesnt fall in your face every time you cast a spell?).<br />
<br />
So I decided to get away from it all.  Find some peace and quiet.  What better place than home?  Besides, it had been ages since I had seen my great aunt Maureen.  Dutifully pulling back my hood and polishing my forhead before entering the palace, I was once again struck by how my home seemed so abandoned.  Where were the youths?  Come to think of it, I had not seen one body in the woods outside of the city.  Was this related?  The concern for my homeland and the echoes of the fountains in the palace were distracting.  I decided to relive my youth and take the boat to Qeynos.  I had always found the salt air, the sway of the sea and the slapping of the rigging to be relaxing.  Maybe I could figure it out from there.<br />
<br />
As the sun set I climbed from the ferry onto the deck and cleared thoughts of the additional challenges involved in designing a pointy hood for my people.  I had to look at the facts at hand and find the solution buried within.  The mainsail filled and I ran through the facts in my mind:  Warriors had been edgier than normal for several days now.  Simple raids were falling apart at the seams.  Halflings seem to have disappeared entirely.  Smithies in all the cities seemed to be making an inordinately large number of manacles.  The increased amount of porting I had been doing in recent days itself had to be tied in there somewhere....And to top it off, I had not had any of those annoying puppydogs interfering with my hunts.  If I had a god, I would have prayed for an answer.  As it was I just got a headache.<br />
<br />
I saw sparkling blue lights on the island that was just breaking the horizon and thought to myself that the silly Kerrans must be experimenting again with some way to invade Odus again, but as the ship pulled to the docks I was astounded by what I saw:  Gnomes flying through the air in all directions; two of those haughty high-elf ladies pulling each other's hair out in public.  Another one walking on the beach with a dark elf of all things - I wanted to read their lips, but my eyes were too poor to see that clearly with only the moon for illumination; perhaps strangest and most disturbing of all were the hordes of naked dwarfs staggering all over the island...And - a lead!  For here on this island were halflings where no halflings should be...routinely burning their hands while trying to cook fish on grills that were taller than their heads.<br />
<br />
This definately needed to be looked into....</div></div><hr />

Well, Magdalena is back.  Drat those Dark Elves!  Leave it to them to have a charitable moment at the worst possible time.  Why couldn't they just leave her to rot? If only some necros had gotten to her first.  <br />
<br />
I feel as if everyone's eyes follow me accussing me of things best left unmentioned.  At least she's in no condition now to wear that foolishness she was wearing.  I have an extra set of Bermuda shorts, perhaps I'll offer them to her.  *slightly insane giggle*<br />
<br />
I think the Monk needs a break.  I hear parts of him are feigning death, if you know what I mean.  They're resorting to using Invigor which I understand is a particularly short duration spell.  So you end up casting it and recasting it and it breaks up the mood.  Not that I would know!  I am still true to my clerical vows of chastity. Well if you don't count what happened the other night which, I think, technically really wouldn't count.  The rules aren't terribly specific. Mother Superior won't find out anyway. <br />
<br />
I had an idea for a mixed drink last night:  True North.  When you pass out your head always points to the North.  I tried it out on the gnomes and sure enough, when I went down to the beach this morning, there were quite a few gnomes sleeping it off with their heads pointing to the north.  It seems to make your head a little magnetic.  Some of them had their maces stuck to their foreheads this morning.   I suppose I should leave the drink mixing to the dwarves.   <br />
<br />
Someone took the druid and paladin down.  Fortunately they left the avocado dip in place to cushion their fall.   They ran off screaming as a hoard of clerics armed with tortilla chips chased them into the ocean.  Last I saw of Scirocco was he was dog-paddling to Odus, Pompus John unfortunately sunk like a rock.  Such a waste of good dip.</div></div><hr />

Hmmm, you'd think after 500 years, I'd come up with a better title for my journal. Ah well.<br />
<br />
Rolled outta my bed this morning, and walked into chaos. All the other clerics were flying to the beach, towards what looked like a half dead monk. Since everything seemed to be in hand, I wandered over to the bar to mix up breakfast.<br />
<br />
<br />
After visiting the local shaman for a potion to get the last of that coconut paint outta my beard, I picked up a tray of invisibles some halfling had been making from my notes, and headed for the beach. Suprisingly, a barbarian was staggering outta the surf, muttering about wizards. I slipped him a drink, just to see how the elves nearby would react. I think his reaction was funnier though, most can't wait to flip up their kilt to show some passing lady, By Brell, i think this one is actually modest!<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Note to self: cure spell not fixing that odd sensation in brain. fells sorta like a presence, near one of the patchs of trees. Hmm... I swear that patch wasn't there two days ago.... maybe I should go take a look tommorrow. Last time I felt something like this, I'd been hit on the head with a table leg in a bar fight, right before........... Nah, couldn't be him..............Could it?<br />
<br />
Note to self, bring own bag of spices to dark elf bonfire tonight. I've tasted their cooking before....... I never knew you could cook a fish just by passing it over a jug of Innoruuk's kiss of Death! And I thought that drink was to weak for a party, amazing. Fish was good, but the spice about ripped my tonsils out.</div></div><hr />

Day 98: Well, it seems I've found the place that all my Marr-worshiping bretheren have gone.  It's warm, it's sandy, and there are lots of elves.  In short, it sucks.  But hey, this is what you get when you worship the Goddess of Love, right?  I mean, you have to wear pink armor and all the high elven guys like to try and take moonlit walks on the beach with you.  Goddess help me.  My dad always said &quot;Now son, when you grow up and become a man make sure you worship Marr.&quot;  I'm thinking now he meant the OTHER Marr.  I tried to petition the temple for a change, but all the Paladins laughed at me and told me no way they were letting some fruit in pink armor join their gang.  Damn you smiths!<br />
<br />
Some of the less pious among us seem to have found the beer keg.  You'd think as a worshiper of Love I'd get invited to all sorts of sex parties and such, but nooooooo.  We have to worship &quot;pure&quot; love.  Yeah, right.  I've got some pure love for ya right here in my... pink pants.  *sigh*  Well, at least there's no freaking... ok, who let the halflings in?  I mean, come on.  We all know they are really just druid infiltraitors and not true clerics.  I can tell this place is going to Hate in a Handbasket.  Ah well.

They had consumed the breakfast around 10am and had proceded to waddle to the shoreline.  Hopefully to wash, though I doubt it.<br />
<br />
I walked about for a while, collecting sea shells on the beach.  I even spotted the new construction happening near the dwarven area.  Lots of gnomes about must account for the numerous explosions.<br />
<br />
As the sun passed by overhead I wandered back to the oven.  For lunch I decided to offer a wide array of sandwiches, salad, fruits and veggies.  Once I gathered my supplies and baked the bread, onto the table went the stash.  Bear, lion, snake, wolf, mammoth, griffon, and even wurm.  Jum jum salad, fresh veggies and fruits n berries were heaped in bowls on the table.  Drats more dishes. I really need a dishwasher!<br />
<br />
Once the goodies where set out, I checked the sun.  Sure enough about 10 minutes later the hordes of clerics clambered back up the beach to the table.  Thankfully no plates were needed so I just backed away slowly, not wishing to be trampled, and let them pig out.  Nothing like a lovely late lunch at 2 pm.  They should be good till the festivities.  I heard murmers earlier about Brell and Broder.  I didnt quite understand it all though.  Perhaps more shall be revealed tonight.  <br />
<br />
Sighing I look at the pile of dirty bowls and crumbs.  Just where can one hire help on this island? I signed up for relaxation, NOT dishes.  Wrinkling my nose in disgust I leave the mess and head to a shaded hammock.  I take great pains to make sure my sarong is quite modest and reveals nothing after I lay down.  Perhaps just a little nap before the evening fun.<br />
<br />
Ah this is the life.  No more chains to lead and people to whip into shape!  A girl could get used to this, now if only I could find a someone else to wash the dishes...</div></div><hr />

He turns to look at his large furry companion &quot;I think we've found it big guy, try not to eat everything in sight&quot;<br />
<br />
*Smakz, covered from head to toe, in 2 tons of metal plating looks to his dark skinned friend. &quot;Its ok mate, i brought my own food&quot;.  Hefting 3 gigantic bags stuffed full of Dragon steaks, and fish rolls.  &quot;It should last me at least 2 days&quot;<br />
<br />
*The pair walks down the beach from where the wizard appeared with his friend, amidst startled shocks from many nakid dwarven men.  Passin a huge what has to be gnomish contraption, they wander back into the woods to seek a secluded spot to &quot;set up camp&quot; as the Vah Shir calls it.<br />
<br />
*Just then the pair is noticed by Nakid dwarf, with 4 mugs in one hand ... not serving, he appears to be drinking all of them.  &quot;What brings ye here&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Im fed up with it ... Druids can go back to quadding, but im not getting beat on anymore so they can complain about never getting the good stuff.&quot; Rumbles the oversized warrior, tail wagging mindlessly behind him, his only unarmored apendage. &quot;My wizard friend heard about this place from a few of your &quot;breathren&quot; and thought hed bring me here, when he saw me nearly loose my life in the hands of a druid healer, thank the gods Xith's good at his job&quot;<br />
<br />
*Xith, at this point, sitting on the ground, trying to figure out a way to light a fire without incinerating the entire island, looks up and mutters &quot;Cant have the meat shield laying dead after every fight because the Druid tries to play one of my mastery, so i thought to bring him here.  Least he knows he'll be safe, and maybe you can teach him how to take off that armor.  It needs a good cleaning anyway.&quot; as he points to bloodstains streaking across his breastplate, reminiscent of a once living froglok.<br />
<br />
&quot;Enough talk, wheres the food&quot;  Smakz exclaims, as his stomach rumbles loudly, &quot;I heard you got a good cook&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;well, i guess ye kin stay, we got a monk tried to kill himself, massagin them hi elfs now, guess ye kin be put ta work, I need a good arm to lift me barrels when they need switchin behind da bar&quot; ... &quot;But yer friend, he may need ta stay outta eye till night, when his people come out, none of us here see too many of the dark skinned ones in the day&quot;<br />

&quot;we wont bother anyone just, i need to get away from those druids, one of em tried to dot me once instead of a heal&quot; Mutters Smakz as he shoves a 3rd fish roll into his mouth, &quot;wheres the mess hall, i havent eaten in hours&quot; ... stalking off into the woods after his arcane friend, mindlessly following, muttering to himself about tactical advantages, and fortification, still shoveling food into his mouth.<br />
<br />
*Muttering to himself, &quot;that be an odd pair&quot;, the dwarf watches the Red and blue robed Dark elf, and the Mail covered Vah Shir fade into the trees, &quot;Just hope the big one dont eat all da food&quot; .. as he turns away, stumbling back to his bar, more likely to refil his own drink, than anyone elses.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">electrae</div><div class="date">10-05-2002, 07:11 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Dear Diary,<br />
<br />
I woke up this morning to see Magdalena peering down at me with an insane grin on her face.  The resort shaman was at the doorway with his arms folded frowning at me.   Magdalena said,  &quot;Electrae, thank you so much for helping to look after me while I was ill.  I must think of a way to repay you for your...&quot;<br />
<br />
There was a long pause.  She lost the smile and her eyes closed to a slit.  I could swear I saw fangs as her expression turned into a snarl.<br />
<br />
&quot;... kindness&quot;.<br />
<br />
Then her crazy grin came back and her eyes seemed to sparkle with happiness.<br />
<br />
&quot;But then again, perhaps I already did&quot;.<br />
<br />
She began laughing and laughed until tears streamed down her face.  Then she gated away.  <br />
<br />
I just lay there in my bed too stunned to move, as if I had been struck with enforced reverence.  Finally the horror of the moment wore off and I was able to extract myself from my bed, wondering what her cryptic message meant. <br />
<br />
I felt a cool breeze waft gently through the hut.  It ruffled my night gown, the curtins billowed, it blew its chilly breath across my head, and my hair tossed gently... that's when I realized my hair was not on my head but was lying on my pillow still.  My beautiful crimson tresses had somehow been detached from my scalp and were still napping on my pillow.<br />
<br />
I felt a slimey substance on my purely bald head.  That shaman had conspired with her to play a horrible trick on me!  I felt a scream of pure rage bubbling up but I clamped down on it.  It wouldn't do to bring hoards of curious clerics running to witness my humiliation.  <br />
<br />
I pulled myself together emotionally.  My mind was awhirl with thoughts of how to reattach my hair.  Perhaps I could root it.   I tried root, but it kept wearing off.  I tried enstill, same problem.  Nothing would hold it in place!  <br />
<br />
Finally I gave up.  I looked at myself closely in the mirror.  You know, it really sets off my features not having that enormous mass of red hair to compete with.  Really, it was kind of chic and quirky looking.  I put on my sun-glasses with the upturned corners and sparkly gems on the frames.  Wow!   But the bermuda shorts would really have to go.  I dumped the suitcase out on the bed.... ugh.  Nothing to wear.  Akkirus, a few pieces of Etheral Mist... nothing suitable for AFK Islands though, except the Etheral Mist tank suit.  Nice purple color, pretty really, but rather plain.<br />
<br />
The breeze whipped up again and my eye was drawn to the curtains.  They were Island print with parrots and loud colors and would look absolutely fantastic with my tank suit.   I ripped down a curtain and fashioned it into a sort of sarong skirt type of thing.  I hoped no one would notice I was wearing a curtain.  I tied it with the gold rope tie-back with a huge tassel. <br />
<br />
I was nervous.  I was about to walk into public wearing less than I've ever worn before. Not only that, but making a fashion statement that would raise eyebrows if not singe them right off.  I needed a drink.  Fortunately I had a bottle of Halas Fire Tonic in my belongings, for medicinal purposes of course.  I took a few sips to steady my nerves. <br />
<br />
I plastered a smile on my face, slipped into my sandals and strutted onto the beach doing my very best to look confident, happy and completely nonplussed by my lack of hair. <br />
<br />
It had an effect.  The clerics that had assembled for breakfast went absolutely silent and stared at me.  I was cool though.  I didn't let it shake me.   <br />
<br />
Then something completely unexpected happened.  A cheer went up from the Erudite clerics.   They lifted me on their shoulders and proudly proclaimed that I had gone &quot;native&quot;.   One of them painted some little red square dots on my cheek.  They were so absolutely down with my new look!  <br />
<br />
I snuck a quick look for Magdalena.  I saw her, dressed conservatively for once and covered from head to toe in a plain cover-up, still suffering from res effects.  She was absolutely glowering at me, ready to attack, for sure!  I could see the rest of the assembled clerics were conferring over my new look.  Some looked at me with a new respect, others had furrowed brows.  But merely seeing Magdalena about ready to self-immolate from fury was worth every moment.<br />
<br />
Even though I have been at the AFK for days now, I finally feel like I had just arrived.<br />

  I finally snuck out of the giant fan that blows breezes in the Cleric resort.  My fellow lazy enchanters began to cackle as we charmed the local gnomes to run in tiny motor wheels.  So far this entire illusion has been a success.  <br />
   Many of the enchanters have taken shifts casting gender illusions on our well paid troll female and male workers.  I believe that those weeks teaching trolls how to speak properly worked very well.  We also were successful in giving the trolls pickup lines to convince all of the clerics.  *note to self*  Have to buy larger bikinis as they keep fading and ripping when those dwarves give my workers that invisbility concoction.<br />
   All the clerics have no idea they've been with trolls.  Soon, we will have enough money from those cleric's coin purses to buy our freedom from buffing.  All in good time.<br />

<br />
I have had many people compliment my cooking but still no volunteers to do the dishes.  I fear I may end up all wrinkly without even setting foot in the ocean.<br />
<br />
Yesterday over brunch Electrae gave everyone quite a shock.  She appears to have &quot;gone native&quot; by shaving her hair off and adopting the somewhat outlandish dress of the locals.  But speaking of locals, its quite odd as I dont notice them being bald except when imbibing the dwarves &quot;invisibility&quot; potions.  Truth be told they scare me just a bit and I avoid them.  Guess thats just the way of the High Elf.<br />
<br />
I fear my poor bard friend is running herself ragged with my daily deliveries and letters.  Perhaps I should find a wizard to assist instead, though I hear they charge an outrageous amount now adays.<br />
<br />
Ah well, no time today to write to my love.  I am making pies for the late lunch scheduled before the Halflings entertainment for the evening.  Fruit, veggie, rat and Halas should make a lovely repast for all.   Now if only I could find someone else to wash these dishes....</div></div><hr />

That magician duo didnt stay around long enough for me to convince them to do my dishes.  Now my fingers are all pruney and I cant find anyone to help!  Thats ok, I will be taking a day off of cooking soon and you all can survive on bracerbread, that native fair of sand encrusted fish rolls or the burned halfling attempts at baking that normally end up with hair it them.<br />
<br />
I love my pony tail, it flips about at the monsters when I am nuking them for a little extra damage.  Plus my shaman likes to tug on it.  *giggle* *big grin*  *cough*<br />
<br />
I did notice that warrior and wizard pair.  They cant FD like that blasted monk can so I could rope them into it.  Wonder what their MR is and if root would stick on em?<br />
<br />
*wanders off pondering how to convice a kitty to get his paws wet on her dishes*</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Galavant</div><div class="date">10-07-2002, 03:56 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">So I decided to go take a walk up the volcano, and get away from the crowd for a bit of meditation. Followers of Brell, attuned to the earth as we are, can still feel the power that created this island resonating within it. After a bit of a climb (and nuking a few pesky buzzing light balls...you know, wisps) I arrived at the now silent crater. Where, to my surprise, I found that I was not alone.<br />
<br />
Sitting silently on the crater rim, looking out over the sea and into the distance, making neither motion nor sound, was an Iksar. By his wiry build, light armor, and the staff resting across his lap, I judged him to be a monk. I've encountered his like before in other parts of Norrath...guess it shouldn't be a surprise to see one of his kind here as well, out meditating on the elements as they often do. I decided not to disturb him...after all, he was only doing what I had come here to do myself. So I quietly took a seat next to him, and together we thought away the afternoon. And then suddenly, as the sun faded away over  the horizon, he began to speak. He never moved or looked at me, he just kept staring off into the distance, his green reptilian eyes seeming to glow in the light of the rising moon as the words came forth of their own volition.<br />
<br />
&quot;The ultimate motive of life is survival,&quot; he said. &quot;From the time of the first life upon Norrath, that has never changed. The first purpose of any living being is to survive. And to aid that survival, nature has given us Pain and Fear. To the strong, Pain teaches endurance in times of trouble, while Fear inspires necessary actions. Thus do the strong survive, while the weak buckle beneath the burdens of life.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Below us now, on this island, there are many who are faced with a great trial. They do not consciously know this, for Pain and Fear are subtle in their ways. The ones here only know that they seek to escape...escape what? The lives that they chose. It is ironic...they have left behind, they seek to escape, the very places that they complain to have lost. They seek to blame others, the same others that they have left to take their places. It is all one gigantic act of denial and weakness. They are afraid of losing their places, and also afraid of what they must endure to keep their places. Pain and Fear combine, and they do nothing. And their places, their precious chosen lives, are lost to them, for they are the ones who have left their places behind.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What would the strong do, faced with such a situation? The answer is so simple that it escapes them. They must reclaim their place. But to do that, they must be willing to face Fear, and endure Pain. They must shout until the gods hear them. They must wait, grit their teeth, carry on, against all odds and in the face of all adversity. They must lead, not follow. They must fight with all their being, as beasts have done since Veeshan's claws first tore across the globe. If they will do these things, they will survive. And to the strong, survival is the same as victory.&quot;<br />
<br />
The Iksar fell silent after that. I thought long and hard on what he said, and after a bit, I looked at him and firmly said, &quot;Thank you.&quot; I then rose from my place, and strode back down the mountain. That monk never moved nor answered me as I left...in fact, he never directly acknowledged my presence at all. But that doesn't matter. And I'll bet good money that he isn't up there on that hill if others go looking. The gods work in mysterious ways...their messengers even more so.<br />
<br />
My arrival back in the resort didn't make much of a stir, but my repappearance after a short trip to the hut I was using as a crash pad certainly did. All the others looked at me funny when I walked out in my armor, hammer in hand, buffed and ready to go. And I'll bet there was some talk when I didn't bother waiting for the next boat out, but instead I just donned my Fishbone Earring and started swimming for the mainland. But that doesn't matter now. I've never had a subtle way of doing things, and am long past caring what a bunch of pointy-eared pansies think of me. I am a dwarf, I am a cleric, and I have a mission.<br />

&quot;nothing!&quot;<br />
<br />
They never seemed to believe me, instead appearing beside me, asking me where I wanted to go and not leaving me alone until I let them take me some place.  As soon as they were out of sight, I'd sneak back down to dock, snickering the whole way. http://apolyton.net/forums/images/smilies/evil2.gif <br />
<br />
I was 54 before I learned to ride the boat from  Firona Vie to Butcherblock.  I rode around in circles awhile before I figured out that I had to change boats.  A few more circles before I figured out which boat...<br />
<br />
It was a shock to realize how long I'd been at the dock and no druid had arrived to kidnap me. :(</div></div><hr />

She quickly thumbed through her Iksar/Elven dictionary to help with the translation.  <br />
<br />
&quot;pain&quot;, &quot;fear&quot;, &quot;escape?&quot;, Electrae mused on a few words that she picked up.  &quot;Reclaim their place?&quot;  Suddenly the meaning became clear.  The Iksar was an escapee and intended to gather his brothers and inflict pain and fear on the clerics.  They clearly intended to conquer Odus and perhaps Antonica!  <br />
<br />
Why look!  A cleric is running down the hill side seeking to escape already!  The coward.   <br />
<br />
Electrae suddenly felt like Fironia Vie facing the evil Iksar, minus the long hair, of course.  She had a quick daydream of an outpost with a huge statue of an elf with no hair holding an eternally burning flame...  Electraeville sounded nice.<br />
<br />
She ran down to the beach and began to gather the clerics.<br />
<br />
&quot;Brothers and sisters, I have overheard a dastardly plot of the Iksar to conquer this very island and perhaps even Odus and Antonica and enslave us all!  Even now one of their spies is lurking on this island.  I have overheard their invasion plan.  We must waste no time in preparing for the invasion.<br />
<br />
Are you with me?!?!&quot;<br />

He watches as the Cleric disappears into one of the huts, emerging shortly later in full armor and their skin radiating of Aegolism.  He squats down, his Goo-Covered Knights Blade brushing the ground as his Dark Runed Armor settles and blends him into the dark underbrush.  He then opens a scroll with a mystic seal on it, a symbol of Neriak.)<br />
<br />
King,<br />
<br />
I have found where the Clerics have escaped too.  It appears as if their taking some kind of revelry in the lands of Odus.  Their are Clerics of all races here, from the despised Dwarves to the utmost hated &quot;High&quot; Elves.  My hand glows with an unholy fury as I imagine reaching for their throats.<br />
<br />
The curse of having to rely on Druids will hopefully be over soon.  As I write this I gaze upon the festivities, Gnomish fireworks blazing in the distance and Dwarves giving females beverages that appear to make their very clothing disappear.<br />
<br />
I just witnessed a Cleric dress in their armor and appear to have gone AWOL on his kinsman.  Perhaps the calling to their hearts had returned to them.  Innoruuk be praised!  I fear if I have to slay any more Druids for their ineptness we shall soon run out of devine magic alltogether!<br />

<br />
(Watches as a female high-elf, stumbling under the influence of alcohol, is trailed by a dwarf.  The dwarf hands her another drink as she sheepishly accepts and downs the beverage, giggling.  Watches intrigued as the elf's clothes begin to disappear)<br />
<br />
On second thought, what could a vacation hurt?  It's not like I dont deserve it...why, being all hateful at times just gets plain...rude.  I may just see if I can't find a purpose here.  Their ARE alot of dishes stacked up next to that hut, and I'm sure Goner wouldnt mind it himself.  Looks like I've worked him to death!<br />

She slurred her speech slightly, drinking from a bottle containing a liquid perhaps identified by the dwarvish runes scribed into its's side.<br />
<br />
&quot;I don't mean HERE obviously. Here is , you know , great&quot;. She turned towards the open doorway where the light and noise from the regular nightly barbecue spilled in.<br />
<br />
&quot;It's just, you know ... not the same anymore. I mean I love the life of the cleric. Healing the injured, rezzing the dead. But after a while it just doesn't seem worth it anymore. It's just the same thing day after day. It's so ...&quot;<br />
<br />
The cleric looks confused for a moment, and takes another swig of her drink.<br />
<br />
&quot;... monotonononus. Yeh that's it, boring. One zone is like the other; one mob is like the other. All the same.&quot;<br />
<br />
The cleric sighs and takes another sip.<br />
<br />
&quot;Before I came here I died you know. Big fight in the courtyard, both clerics overwhelmed, enchanter couldn't handle them. I used both divines and we ran, but when I stopped to cast a heal I was killed. Then half the group runs off leaving me to get my body and the enchanters. Bastards !&quot;<br />
<br />
Anger creases the clerics face. She stands unsteadily, her right hand grabbing for a weapon no longer there. Anger turns to pain and she sits down heavily again. Her eyes go red and she sniffs, knocking back another gulp of dwarvish brew.<br />
<br />
&quot;Maybe I could have saved us. If I'd have called the zone earlier, healed a bit quicker, rooted more, something...<br />
<br />
Her head is bowed now, her voice is no more than a whisper, drowned out by the noise outside.<br />
<br />
&quot;Maybe I need another rest. Some time away. That helped before. I hear rumours of new lands, maybe that'll help.&quot; The cleric looks thoughtful for a moment.<br />
<br />
&quot;No , not really. I went to Velious and Luclin and that didn't help. To much time travelling, dodging mobs, looking for people to group with. I'm tired now, too tired.&quot;<br />
<br />
The cleric raises the bottle, but nothing flows out. She concentrates briefly, trying to remember the name of the drink.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ah bugger it !&quot;. She throws the bottle into the sand, rising unsteadily to her feet again.<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm going to get another drink, do you want ... of course you don't. Sorry.&quot;<br />
<br />
A brief smile plays across her lips. She shakes her head, and moves unsteadily towards the door.<br />
<br />
&quot;Thanks. You know, for listening. Be safe.&quot;<br />
<br />
The cleric staggers out into the noise and light.<br />
<br />
Another clean plate is added to the pile. A hand grabs a dirty plate and drops it into the scalding hot water without flinching. Hardly surprising when there's no flesh to burn.<br />
A skull turns from the direction of the doorway back to the task at hand.<br />
<br />
The party continues outside.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Cali</div><div class="date">10-08-2002, 09:47 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The morning sun played peekaboo on my face with the shade from the garish-print curtains in my small hut.  Mumbling &quot;just a few more minutes&quot;, I rolled over and pulled the covers up over my head.  <br />
<br />
Soon a soft knock roused me.  Pulling my hair over my ears I pretended I didnt hear it.  Soon the knocking became more insistant, but still rather quiet.  <br />
<br />
&quot;If ye dont git up soon Im gonna eat all yer brownie parts!&quot; came the angry little voice.<br />
<br />
Brownie Parts! That got me jumping out of bed and reaching for my Soft Wicker Robe in a hurry.  I opened the door and peered out.  Looking franticly up and down the beach hoping to see the voice before they got their mits on my chocolate.  A tug on my robe prompted me to look down.  Ah a gnome.  Well a very short, angry and dishevelled gnome.   The lass had fire in her eyes and a very large bag weighing her down.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ah so the bard sent you today Calimyrn?&quot; I asked her.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well hallo an good morn to you too Ms High an Mighty. Not even goin to invite me in for a mornin cup of tea are ye?  Well never you mind, wouldnt sip tea with ye anyways, snooty.  Here be yer supplies an dont ya think this will be a regular service.  Ye got one week left ya hear? Den yer vacation be over.  So dont go pawnin dat Akkirus just yet, pastey.&quot;  The gnome stated this all very quickly and shoved the bag into my arms.  Before I could utter a word she chanted a few things and made a rude gesture at me before disappearing in a poof.<br />
<br />
&quot;Manners manners manners! That chit better be on her best behaviour if she ever wants an aego again.&quot; I harumphed as I pulled the door closed.  Gently laying the bag on the small table, I dug around in the dresser for clothing.  Finding a clean outfit was rather hard.  The laundry service was nonexistant on AFK Island and with the Dark Elves camping the lagoon a girl could hardly wash her unmentionables there.  Finally I found a very old pair of Bamboo Splint miniskirt and tank top.  &quot;Well not the latest in fashion but just going to get covered in dishwater anyways.&quot; I sighed.<br />
<br />
Gathering up the bag of supplies I strode out of my hut and up the hill to the kitchen.  I noticed that it was later then usual for me to be up and about.  That late night must have set me back a few hours.  Ah, but fresh lizard on a stick was good.  I tried not to think of the mound of dishes left from the fun last night.<br />
<br />
I started digging in the bag as I walked into the kitchen.  Not paying much attention to my surroundings obviously.  I set out all of my stash and contemplated what I had time to make.  Lets see, brownie parts, fresh fruit, wurm eggs, mature cheese, bixie parts, spices and sauce. BIXIE PARTS? Oh please, just what kind of breakfast includes bixie parts.  My shoulders slump as I weigh my options.<br />
<br />
Ok, chocolate muffins, pound cake and fruit, Omlette du fromage and bixie crunchies should be ok, though not very nutritious.  Perhaps I can make some healthy veggie pies for lunch though to help round it out.<br />
<br />
Working swiftly I assemble the meal.  Thankful that I keep my pots and pans clean.  Once the table is full of food, I step back and lick the chocolate off my fingers.  Pleased with the offering I turn to the sink, not looking forward to washing all those dishes before people come looking for breakfast.<br />
<br />
Much to my surprize the dishes are all clean.  Eyes wide I look around as I grab a dish to inspect it for cleanliness.  The dish looks so clean I can see myself quite clearly, down to the beauty mark on my cheek.  Then, I see something that is more shocking then a spotlessly clean dish that was obviously scrubbed in boiling water.  <br />
<br />
A skeletal hand in a corner, clutching a sponge.<br />
<br />
I scream and the dish falls to the floor with a shattering crash...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bruknor Battleforge</div><div class="date">10-08-2002, 12:29 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Many months ago, he sat on his rump in the Temple Of Veeshan, head face down in his hands. The waves of depression and feelings of hopelessness washing over him. Even the wonderful smells of the many pies he carried sealed in his backpack failed to rouse him from his stupor.<br />
<br />
 &quot;I'm so tired anymore. All I ever do is sit on the floor, stand up, cast a heal and sit back down. Where's the sense of adventure?&quot;. &quot;Well, no sense on prolonging the inevitable I suppose&quot;. <br />
<br />
He then cast a spell that was never meant to be cast. A spell that would scatter his very being across time and space, vanishing from Norrath for all time.<br />
<br />
<br />
....But fate has a way of making things right again.<br />
<br />
 A group of friends from the local adventuring guild had made all the preparations. The pies were placed outside the temple in Kaladim. A sexy, half clad Wood Elf lass began to dance while a Bard played a lively tune. The chants were begun and soon a mist appeared.<br />
<br />
 When they cleared, there he sat with a smile on his bearded face. &quot;Couldn't live without me, eh?&quot;. Grabbing the nearest pie, he began to munch absent-mindedly while listening to a strange tale indeed.<br />
<br />
 It seems all the clerics have disappeared, Druids from all over have been captured and put in chains to be hauled away to heal raids.<br />
<br />
 &quot;Heal raids? Are they mad?!!&quot;. &quot;There's no Druid that can keep up with a cleric.&quot;.<br />
<br />
  His friends then told him of the new magiks that the Druids have aquired. &quot;Ah, that would explain the chains then, but what of the clerics??&quot;. &quot;Where have they gone?&quot;.<br />
<br />
 They had no answer for him so he set off from Kaladim to look for his brothers and sisters in the art. Before long, he was met by a gnome messenger.<br />
<br />
 &quot;Excuse me, but are you a cleric?&quot; he asked.<br />
<br />
 &quot;Why yes, I am. How can I help you?&quot;<br />
<br />
 &quot;I have these for you.&quot; The gnome holding out a small parcel. Handing them over the gnome turned and ran back towards Ak'anon. <br />
<br />
  The dwarf opened the package and was amazed to find only a ticket for a boat to Timorous Deep and a pair of shorts with a note that read....<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">electrae</div><div class="date">10-08-2002, 03:17 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Electrae raised her coconut to toast the cook.  &quot;Cali, you out did yourself!&quot;.  There's nothing like meal prepared over open flame, especially when the meal is one you caught yourself.   She thoughtfully munched the last bit of lizkabob.  <br />
<br />
She chuckled at the mental picture she had of herself and a dozen clerics quietly creeping up the volcano side to capture the Iksar infiltrator.   It was odd how he had taken so few precautions to hide himself.  Bah!  The Iksar must have arrogantly believed himself unconquerable and his hubris was his downfall.   It was a simple matter to stun him, root him, and nuke him to unconsciousness.  <br />
<br />
Well, enough.  But this was only a spy.  The hoards of Iksar were  enroute.  If they enslaved all the clerics on AFK Islands and forced us to work for them, they'd surely be unstoppable.  Iksar don't have clerics, they don't have druids, they have other assorted priests, but not the priests that could keep their warriors fighting and fit in the worst battles.<br />
<br />
Electrae pondered her grave responsibility.  Could she rouse these drunken hedonists out of their apethetic stupor to defend themselves?  Could they fashion any reasonable defense out of the bamboo growing in the forest?  Maybe load some powerful magics into empty coconuts and hurl them long distances using a gnomish contraption.  <br />
<br />
She began to rise from her lounge, but a tsunami of apathy induced by the hot sun, the cool breeze, the nice-looking human in pink armor,  a few too many coconut drinks, rose up and engulfed her.  <br />
<br />
&quot;Does it matter who we work for?&quot;, she asked a parrot preening his feathers on a perch nearby.<br />
<br />
The parrot croaked loudly and flapped his wings.  &quot;No.  Not really&quot;, he replied.  &quot;One tank is pretty much the same as another.  Besides, there are many ways to resist.  If you're enslaved in the chain gang again you could find it difficult to count...  seems to be working for the druids&quot;.<br />
<br />
Electrae eyed the parrot suspiciously.  &quot;Quite a vocabulary you have&quot;.<br />
<br />
The parrot chuckled.  &quot;What did you expect me to say, Pretty Bird?  Look sis, your problem isn't the Iksar.  It's the world.  You might think you're doing some sort of civil disobedience thing here, but how long do you suppose the Warlords and Warlocks are going to allow this to go on?&quot;  <br />
<br />
Electrae's brow furrowed, the damn parrot was right.  In fact, there were some here now.  Why were they here?  Were they really escaping the grind like the clerics, or were they here to end the AFK?  Electrae felt at a loss for a course of action.  This parrot seemed pretty knowledgable.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, pretty bird, what should we do?&quot;, she asked.<br />
<br />
The parrot screeched noisily, &quot;Don't call me that, my name is Bill Beak&quot;.<br />
<br />
Electrae rolled her eyes.  &quot;Sorry, er, Bill.  What should we clerics do?&quot;.<br />
<br />
Bill paused a moment and scratched his cheek with a foot, pensively.  &quot;Well, near as I can tell you don't have a lot of choice.  You can stay here until you're forced back, if indeed they need to have you back.  If it were me I'd probably just drink a lot of that fermented fruit juice you folks seem to like and look for opportunities to mate and eat until I can't fly.  Then if they took me away from my Island I'd make it a point to stop talking, make a huge mess in my cage and squak a lot and hang upside down from my perch with one foot and play dead&quot;.<br />
<br />
Electrae pondered the bird's words and nodded in agreement.<br />
<br />
But perhaps there were means to prolong their idyllic retreat.  Could they make this island fly?  Perhaps make it randomly teleport or conceal it somehow?  Perhaps Brodder could ask one of the Big B's to perform a major miracle.</div></div><hr />

She starts missing those she grew up with, her friends, her best friend, wishing they could enjoy the wonderful island with her, full of clerics of all races being together and having fun.  She glances up to the afternoon sun for a fleeting moment, then turns and giggles at the dwarves running around in their loincloth beards.  <br />
<br />
Thinking to herself she remember the wonderful lunch she had of fruit pies, and vegtables.  At least the magnificet cook got the dishwasher she had been dreaming of, even if it did scare the daylights outta her!<br />
<br />
She wanders down the beach to a rather secluded area of palm trees and ferns. Carefully she climbs to a branch, her quill, ink and papers placed within reach, and in the safety of not falling and being spilt or ruined, and composes her letter to her best friend.<br />
<br />
*My dearest Shanar...<br />
<br />
These Islands are simply beautiful.  The sun setting over the ocean, the white sand, the lagoon with all the Dark Elves gathered around it, the lunch tent with Cali cooking such wonderful meals for us all, all of it, stunningly beautiful.  *<br />
<br />
From the braches of the tree, she looks up from her writings to spot the gnomes on the other end of the beach, completely involved in whatever it is they are hiding in their tent down there.<br />
<br />
*So much has happened here, it is almost astounding that for being a vacation, there is still so much action. There have been parties almost every night, with drinking, fun, and whatnot. There have also been a few rather unusual things going on. Namely one rather beautiful High Elf &quot;went native&quot; and is now without her beautiful crimson tresses of hair!  One night even the Dark Elves decided to be nice and res'ed a cleric that had been found floating about in the ocean.  A monk has washed up on shore, rather a handsome specimine, with good hands. He has become the massage therapist around here and has managed to actually work those knots out of my shoulders finally!<br />
<br />
My thoughts keep turning, however, to the people back home. I miss having my old friends around, my brothers and sisters of the priesthood here are good company, but I miss the chatter in the guild hall of our family. I miss Mene's endless songs about whatever he could make up, Hadore's talk of endless battles won and bravery, Glitch's speils of plants and animal life (never knew one could give biology lessons at a dinner table like he could!), and your laughter at me when we would joke around.  Soon enough though we will be all together again, I believe.  Soon your rogueish charms and wit will be heard beside me, joining me on adventures. I figure if I am not in the CH chains as much, we can go exploring more often again, like the old days.  Maybe, someday, we can come here together, to the AFK Islands...maybe. I doubt they would really allow a rogue to join us here, not many can be trusted like the way I trust you. <br />
<br />
Anyways, send my love to the guildmates and let them know I will be seeing them soon!<br />
<br />
Mianya*<br />
<br />
Mia slowly climbs out of the tree, a small smile on her face. She heads over to Cali to ask a rather large favor of her. She needs her help in sending this letter to its rightful place, Shanar's hands.  Giggling soflty to herself, she envisions the druids, chained to ToV floors with their CH chains now, the bards dancing along to help them out.  Goodness, I needed this vacation...but that is just it, it is a vacation. She starts to ponder just how long this vacation will last, and how it will end.</div></div><hr />

Hmmmm, this sure has been a boring vacation, I thought there was suppose to be a bunch of clerics here I seem to be the only one. Damn druid didn't even hang around to get me out of here. I am sure this is the directions Azlana gave me to get to the AFK island.<br />
<br />
Thank BRELL I bought plenty of Ale, and if that runs out I can always summon some of Brells own mix with that necklace I got a ways back.<br />
<br />
Hmmm worked on my Jewelcraft  to make this nice jewel encrusted stein for my ale.<br />
<br />
Pottery is getting near max as well.<br />
<br />
Fletching to shoot at those birds circling above me if I could just figure out how to use a bow.<br />
<br />
Brewing of course to make more ale.....<br />
<br />
Still got to work on that tailoring so I can make my very own bathing suits.<br />
<br />
Well may be a boring vacation but at least I got a lot done. Maybe I will go get that Shawl thing from our frozen brothers in Thurgadin after I am done with tailoring.<br />

He almost felt sorry for the poor Iksar-illusioned enchanter they had killed. But then, he remembered, the enchanters were here manipulating the clerics for their own purposes, so the lout probably had it coming.<br />
<br />
The monk snuck carefully around the edge of the clerics' camp, watching carefully. He did not see the dwarf whom he had spoken to on the mountain. So at least one cleric had indeed understood his message, and had left to reclaim his place in the world from the usurping druids and shamans. Good. Or evil. It's all the same in the end... <br />
<br />
The monk sat and silently looked down at the shackles upon his wrists, one of rock, the other of stone. They had been with him for some time, and now as he looked at them he felt a sense of restlessness. Yes, he thought. His job was done here, and it was time for him to go and claim a new place for himself, to climb another rung on the ladder.<br />
<br />
And without a word or a look back, the monk snuck down to the beach. He slipped into the water, and with graceful strokes of his powerful tail, he swam away into the night.</div></div><hr />

<br />
 &quot;Ohh Yeah bristlebutt! Well me clerics can stand der ground n give as good as dey take...no matter what dat Shield of Vision allows...Umm Give me two cards&quot;<br />
<br />
 *A slightly higher pitched voice -aparently a halfling's- *<br />

 A voice timbred with sounds of Rain and thunder speaks up...<br />
<br />
 &quot;Look I've told my Rangers that they'll have to make due themselves, but my Druids just can't handle the pressure, I mean you've trained your Clerics gave them all the powers of healing why can't I win some clerics too? I mean I could sit at the big table then ...&quot;<br />
<br />
 * in unison several Godly voices speak out*<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh shut up Karana...go confiscate some forage keys and then bring us some more snacks and ale&quot;<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Arafys</div><div class="date">10-08-2002, 08:46 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Late at night, the sounds of lightning are heard deep inside Kael Drakkel. <br />
   &quot;That's it Purrelu, I'm tired of dying. We're going to do something about this... you and I&quot;, Arafys says to her halfling druid partner. &quot;We just can't keep raiding like this without clerics.&quot;<br />
   &quot;I agree with you Milady, but where are they?&quot; <br />
   &quot;I heard a rumor from an Iksar that they were somewhere in Timorous Deep.&quot;<br />
   &quot;Very well&quot;, Purrelu said as he sat down and opened up his spellbook. &quot;Karana, bless us with travel to the desert of Southern Ro!&quot;<br />
   Seconds later the pair was gone.<br />
<br />
   Arriving in South Ro, the duo set off towards the Oasis of Marr, running quietly and quickly to the docks, their camouflage spells providing cover. Sitting at the end of the docks, they waited patiently for the barge. Purrelu sat down to mem the spells he needed for the mission. An enchanter was surprised to hear a voice next to him say, &quot;A hundred platinum for Koadic's Enchantment.&quot; <br />
  &quot;Huh? Where are you?&quot; <br />
   &quot;Right next to you good sir. We are on a noble mission, and will need the power you can provide to succeed.&quot;<br />
   A small bag of coins appeared on the ground, and the enchanter picked it up. Casting a spell that would allow him to see invisible, he saw the ranger and her partner. &quot;Very well&quot;, he said and began to cast. &quot;Safe Journey to you.&quot;<br />
   With that, the barge arrived, and they were off again.<br />
<br />
   Travelling to Timorous Deep was as boring as anything else, when they were safely inside the region, Arafys made sure her Lodizal shield was securely strapped to her back. Purrelu jumped off the barge and began to cast the traveling spell that the Iksar had told her would take her within a day's travel of &quot;Club Med&quot; They dropped onto a stretch of brilliantly sandy beach. Quickly darting into the foliage, Arafys stretched out her senses, and picked up the scent of unwashed Dwarf and sunburnt High Elf. Refreshing their travel spells, they set off for their prey. <br />
<br />
   While they waited for night to fall, they set up surveillance of the area. It sickened Arafys to see the clerice neglecting their duties. Didn't they know people were dying, didn't they know that evil was raging unchecked throughout Norrath? The very nerve of them, cavorting about under the sun here while honest people that spent their blood, sweat, and tears toiled deep in the ground, fighting things that would overwhelm them but for the power of their heals. Did they not understand that the druids would never be able to comprehend their new tasks? It was nothing personal, the jobs needed to be done, and the clerice were best suited to doing them. The druids had failed. Shamans? They had other, more important tasks. Strengthening people, making them more agile, protecting them from poisons and disease, focusing their combat abilities, that's what shamans do. The task fell to the druids, and for the most part they tried, but those that couldn't get their 2+2=A QUAD! thinking minds out of that paradigm... well... Night began to fall, and Arafys said to Purrelu, &quot;Be ready friend, tonight we move.&quot;  Purrelu nodded and cast magics that would bind his essence to the area.<br />
<br />
   Two clerics walked hand in hand along the beach, talking drunkenly to each other, they never stood a chance in Underfoot of hearing the stealthy ranger. They were quickly snared, rooted, and in the confusion, the druid ran in and ported them out of the paradise. Minutes later, the Halfling returned with good news. &quot;Milady, they 2 clerics are safe in Kael with the raid leader. they can continue now.&quot;<br />
   &quot;Very well my friend, shall we continue?&quot; <br />
   &quot;Yes Milady, I am at your service.&quot; <br />
Arafys then continued the task of capturing and returning the clerics to raid groups around the globe. Her work was far from over though as thousands of clerics from multiple parallel dimensions had come here. This was only the beginning. She would need help.</div></div><hr />

Slipping on a pair of Journeyman's Sandles, I quickly put Goner to work on the dishes.  Amazing the speed he works at once I buff him, and he doesnt even have to worry about scalding!<br />
<br />
With a /pet do dishes here, I was off to find my fellow Tier'Dal.<br />
<br />
Spammed with &quot;Taunting a Saucepan, Master.  Taunting a Fork, Master.  Taunting a Dish, Master.&quot; I continued to make my way to the lagoon.<br />
<br />
It had gotten rather dark that night as I approaced the Dark Elf lagoon, my keen eyes showing me every vivid detail.  They were apparently hard at work on something, something very large and strung between two palm trees.  Upon further inspect, I realised what it was.  A sling.  A sling large enough to fire Gnomes and pointed at the High Elf camp...<br />
<br />
I heard a rustling behind me and, grabbing my circlet, had to remember not to use it as I didnt want a ton of dishes to suddenly collapse across the lagoon.  I spun on my heels to see a rather attractive Tier'Dal female watching me behind some other trees.<br />
<br />
&quot;You dont look like a Cleric to me...&quot; she snickered at my Bermudas.  I looked her up and down, she was dressed in a one-piece Ethereal Mist bathingsuit and that was it.<br />
<br />
Grinning, I calmly stated &quot;Aye, but I am.  Im a healer...&quot;<br />
<br />
She approaced me seductively, placing her hand upon my face and stating flatly &quot;Prove it...&quot;<br />
<br />
(Trevelain begins to cast a spell...<br />
Trevelain groans and looks abit weaker...<br />
Random_Drow_Chick_A has been healed for 30 points)<br />
<br />
That right there was a dead giveaway as she chuckled at the size of my Heal.  She continued laughing as she snorted &quot;Is that all you got?&quot;<br />
<br />
I suppose my face turned alil red right then, but not nearly as red as when she pushed my onto my back.  Grinning, I thought &quot;Here's my lucky chance!&quot;  Then I felt the strap on my back.  To my horror, I realized what was about to happen JUST as...<br />
<br />
I woke up and quickly pried my head from the wall of some High Elves' sleeping quarters, oddly enough, hair was still on her pillow.  I never quite understood those high-elves.  As I gathered my bearings I heard a scream come from towards the kitchen and the sound of a dish breaking.  &quot;Ah...&quot; I thought to myself, &quot;They must have met Goner...&quot;<br />
<br />
I now find myself striding towards the kitchen, still in my Darkforge Shorts, as a rush of Clerics in random assorted dress begin to make their way towards the sound of the scream. This is NOT going to be good...</div></div><hr />

<br />
When Clerics go bad...<br />
<br />
A few clerics get together to reveal the truth... and the truth has set them free! :p<br />
<br />
This is probably the finest, funniest thread I've read in a LONG time! :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">MerlinTKD</div><div class="date">10-09-2002, 04:54 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">/ooc ...may just jump in here, if no one minds... <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
/ic<br />
<br />
Ahhh, he thought... this is the LIFE!<br />
<br />
Darjon grinned as a gnoll priest got overly excited and rooted the shield he was chasing, then promptly ran smack into it. Even the high-pitched yelps couldn't tense him up, not here. Another sip... ahhhh, yes, that hit the spot... that Brodder knew how to brew! Thank the Lady, this wasn't the Invisibility potion, though... he'd gotten caught with that his first day, just like eveyone else, but that was fine... once the ladies had seen the length of his 'fishing pole', they'd laughed differently... and he couldnt' recall so many invitations to see how deep he could cast! Ah, the advantages of worshipping the Goddess of Love!<br />
<br />
Another long pull on his drink... ahhhh! He'd always had problems with alcohol before... in fact, he knew only the Lady's Love had saved him from a miserable life and pathetic early death. Here though... it was different. He could drink as much or as little as he chose, it never awakened the Thirst, like before. He didn't know why... and frankly, couldn't care. One thing he'd learned was to welcome the Lady's blessings when She gave them.<br />
<br />
He watched a fellow Marr priest walk down the beach, arm in arm with an attractive blonde, still wearing that pink cabana-boy outfit bright enough to make those nearby wince. What was with him, anyway? Younger than Darjon, but more advanced in the Preisthood... he hoped dress like that wasnt' a requirement of the upper heirarchy! Well, either way, it was good to see him enjoying the attentions of a female for a change... not that the Lady made a difference about who was in Love, as long as it was Love... but this youngster obviously was getting the kind of attention he wasnt' comfortable with. Seemed happier now, though... the girl was a bit odd, a little stockier and taller than he'd first thought, and was that a green tinge to her skin? Wouldn't think a body *could* get sick, not around here! Ah well, not his worry anymore...<br />
<br />
Taking another swallow, he thought about the rumors of druids in chains.. he wasn't so high in the Priesthood he'd ever encountered the 'healing chain' he'd heard of... and hated to think of anyone else tied down like that. Just wasn't the Lady's way, not at all. Ah, was probably just a rumor anyway... stuff like that couldnt' really happen.<br />
<br />
Behind him, he could hear the elf the cooked so well talking... &quot;now, you're doing a wonderful job with the dishes, you really are, I couldn't ask for better, but you just HAVE to stop taunting the gnomes as they bring the dishes in! It's not the tears so much as the fact that they drop everything on the floor when they run out...&quot;<br />
<br />
The 'rezzed one' stalked by soon after... everyone had taken to calling her that, after the whole bonfire incident... probably wasnt' too nice, but it had kinda stuck... plus, she wasnt' making herself any too friendly, what with stomping around and obsessing over the bald elf girl... unrequited love was just a sad, sad thing. Maybe he'd see if she wanted to go 'fishing', later...<br />
<br />
Ah, yes, he thought... this IS the life!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">electrae</div><div class="date">10-09-2002, 02:30 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Bill, the Parrot, sat on the back of Electrae's lounge chair, stealing furtive sips from her unattended fruit drink.<br />
<br />
&quot;Elfie wanna cracker?&quot;, Bill slurred almost unintelligibly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Lay off the sauce, Bill.  There's something funny happening on the island.  How about doing a recon and giving me a report on what's going on?&quot;  Electrae draped her hand over her drink, which Bill promptly nipped. <br />
<br />
&quot;For some mango?&quot;, Bill cocked his head.<br />
<br />
&quot;Fine, fine, for mango&quot;.<br />
<br />
Bill clacked his beak happily and flew off.  Electrae watched the drunken parrot zig zag across the sky and narrowly miss colliding with several trees.  She wondered  how reliable her informat would be.  She also wondered if parrots talked to anyone else like this.  Was she going mad, or was this another gift from Tunare?  Like the time the werebat wing talked to her.   Or did parrots simply talk to people here?<br />
<br />
The sun was hot, fortunately the breeze was nice and cool.  The lapping of waves against the shore, the buzzing of insects all were working their soporific effect and soon, Electrae was napping in her lounge chair.<br />
<br />
Meanwhile, back on the mainland...<br />
<br />
The warmongerers were getting mad and desperate.   They finally had had enough of this clerical nonsense.   The fleet of ships set sail for the AFK Islands.  However, the navigator, pilot and captain were all arguing over it's location.  Some claimed they were in Ocean of Tears, others claimed AFK Island was in Timorous Deep.   The navigator brough out an ancient mariner's map of the Old World and pointed out that there was a very nice little island in Erud's Crossing, halfway between Qeynos and Erudin.  <br />
<br />
The meaty hands of Garth Ironblade, Warlord, decided once and for all that AFK Island was most definitely in Timorous Deep when they clenched the throats of the two dissenters.  So the fleet of disgruntled warmongers set off to comb the vast expanse of Timourous Deep to find the missing clerics.<br />
<br />
The druids, since they were already in chains, were set to the oars.  A bard was given a drum to beat out the rhythm, but get insisted on an entire drumset and his complicated rhythms kept confusing the druids.<br />
<br />
It looked like this would be a long voyage.  <br />
<br />
Back on the Island<br />
<br />
Electrae screamed in terror as something feathery and taloned crashed into her chest waking her from a pleasant, if somewhat naughty, dream.  <br />
<br />
Bill, looking stunned by the impact, just laid where he fell on her lap, feet up, making soft, unhappy noises.<br />
<br />
&quot;Holy Tunare you almost scared me to death.  What did you see?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Mango.  Must have mango.&quot;  Bill croaked feebly, pretending to be perishing from hunger.<br />
<br />
Electrae slipped a tasty slice of mango to the bird.  It did seem to revive him a bit.  He nibbled it, still upside-down on Electrae's lap, getting mango juice everywhere.<br />
<br />
&quot;Therf peoplef diffapearing off the island&quot;, Bill tried to talk around his beakful of mango.  &quot;There is a dark-elf man in your hut, sleeping.  A skeleton doing huge piles of dishes.  And there's this new parrot babe, wow!  What a gorgeous bird.  Anyway, she just flew in from Ocean of Tears and saw a huge fleet of ships sailing around and stopping at all little islands looking around and then sailing on again.  Mango!  Beak!  Now!&quot;.<br />
<br />
Electrae slipped the inebriated bird another piece of mango and mused over the news.  She decided that at dinner tonight she'd advise the other clerics as to what she learned.   Meanwhile, she went back to her hut to check on who was sleeping in there.<br />
<br />
She walked back to her hut, drunken parrot in the crook of her arm.  Bill had passed out.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
By Brell, I still can't tell what day it is, I ask around and get a different answer from everyone!<br />
<br />
Some random gnome wants me to help him look for his creation, a mechanical parrot that looks like a real one, but with a foul mouth and a physical need for mangos. How he powered the thing off mangos, I don't know.... and frankly, I'm afraid to ask. <br />
<br />
Spent some time on the beach today, tossing a shield for those gnoll clerics. Had a couple offers of companionship, but the Everhot siststers would never understand. Never annoy a lady that works in a forge, let alone two of them! Wonder what they'll think of my new tan?<br />
<br />
After my mid-morning nap, I heard a scream from the kitchen, and found a skelleton doing the dishes, to the obvious dismay of Cali, who had broken a couple of dishes in shock. Wondering what the problem was, I point out that with that thing around, she didn't have to scrub pots, and she could even get it to pull hot trays out of the ovens for her, so she didn't risk burns. While she was thinking about that, I snag a couple of the berry pies off the window sill and wander off to see if I could come up with a new form of invisible, since nobody else seems to be drinking them anymore. Hmmm... maybe a bit more Stout, a bit less boot beer, a hint of bog juice......</div></div><hr />

The General was in a deep thought on his campaign against the giant kind, but the word 'clerics' snapped him out quickly.<br />
'My Lord, Purrelu just delivered two clerics to us, we are saved.'<br />
'Where did he found them? ' inquired the General.<br />
'I believe Purrelu mentioned Timorous Deep before he teleported out, General'<br />
A loud chuckle was heard and the General turn around and look at his Dark Elven advisor<br />
'You know something about this Zylle?'<br />
As Zylle tried to reply, a loud discordance out side the camp interrupted her words.<br />
Ten foot soldiers in all their might dragged in 2 sedated ogres in heavy plate mail. The squad leader then salute and report 'The clerics, my Lord'<br />
'What kind of a joke is this?' the General is clearly annoyed. With a wave of his hand, he signaled the foot soldiers to remove the ogres.<br />
The foot soldiers are not at all happy that they have to drag the ogres out again; ones can clearly hear a low grunt as they approach to two meat hills.<br />
Since they are not clerics and we dont need them, cut them in pieces so you can carry them out easier.<br />
Zylle can no longer hold off her chuckle and burst into laughter.<br />
Care to enlighten us Zylle. The Generals face turns dark as the bottom of a frying pan.<br />
Sire, the recent disappearance of clerics has spark some interest in the empire, one of the scouts that was sent out to search for their where about has report he discover a large group of clerics on an deserted island.<br />
Zylle stopped at this point with a smirk, enjoying the anticipating look on the Generals face.<br />
Where is this island, we need to find them before our competition do.  I am so close in kicking Tormaxs butt, I am not going to get leapfrogged now barked the General.<br />
Waiting till the last limb of the two unfortunate ogres got remove and the last foot soldier has left the camp, Zylle turn towards and General.<br />
Relax my Lord, Zylle said slowly, enjoying the torture on the Generals frustration. I have spread rumor that the clerics are somewhere in Timorous Deep, I can see it is working out fine.  Everyone will be so busy getting lost there.<br />
Again Zylle let off another evil laughter.<br />
So, where is this island, answer me now!<br />
Zylle finished her laugh ignoring the Generals command.  Slowly she turned around and walked towards the door.<br />
Stopped at the door way briefly, she said Erud's Crossing. Then she continues on and left the Generals camp.</div></div><hr />

The luncheon was finished and that skeleton Goner is in doing the huge mountain of dishes left by the grilled cheese sandwiches.  I do hope he doesnt damage my prized Non-Stick Fry Pans with that scalding water.  They are Ace Wondermatic by Geelok and very valuable.<br />
<br />
This was a wonderful time of day on the island.  The sun was slowly slipping into the sea and the island was quiet with people either asleep from the noon meal or getting ready for the evening festivities.  I watched the waves lap the shore as parots fluttered about.  One flapped rather drunkenly and I wondered who had left thier drink unattended.  Smiling I lay back and watch Luclin rise into the sky.  Such a beautiful sight.<br />
<br />
When the sun turns the sea red I arise from my sandy seat and wander back to my hut to retire for the eve.  Im enjoying this vacation and its early nights quite a bit.  Without removing my gem-encrusted sun glasses, a gift from Electrae, I open the door to my hut, step inside and shut the door.  Once I spark the light the gasp in surprize sounds quite loud in the still room.  Sitting around my table is the unlikeliest group I have ever seen...</div></div><hr />

Finally after over a week of chugging along the Wonderoussubmersableislandsinkingdrill was nearing it's destination, AFK island the home of Club Med the cleric retreat.<br />
<br />
Quickly he ran to the engine room through the inch deep standing water that filled the control room.  The stench of oil, and smelly gym shorts hit hit like a cleric summoned hammer. The engine room was full of gnomes wearing rebreathers banging away at the huge infurnal machine that comprised the Wonderoussubmersableislandsinkingdrill's main engine. &quot;Any luck yet, we need the main drive running to power the drill!&quot;, Sprinket belowed into the dine of banging metal.  &quot;Not yet sir&quot; came several muffled voices.<br />
<br />
Sprinket waded to the 2ndary engine room, where the stench was most foul. He grabbed a rebreather off it's wall maount as he entered the room.  The stench from the room was so foul he was fearful even a stout worshipper of Bertox the unclean would have forshaken his vows.  In the room next to a large pile of discarded heavy armor, was a treadmill.  A very large, very smelly ogre warrior panted as he ran on the rickty gnome device.  &quot;How you holdin up Bertog?&quot; &quot;Mees doin goods, but mees been finkin.&quot; Sprinket cringed at the amount of horsepower that had been lost while the ogre wasted effort thinking.  &quot;How is wees gonna make dem clerics comes home and fix Bertog's boo boos&quot; quized the large sweaty orge. <br />
<br />
Sprinket adjusted his rebreather, and began the explanation. &quot;Ok, remember all those nice wizards that gave us all that plat to build this boat, all the nice warriors and the farming druids?&quot; Bertog nodded his head furiously beads of sweat flying all over, Sprinket was sure he heard a rattling sound. &quot;Well we built this boat to remove this AFK island from the face of Norrath once and for all.&quot; Bertog still looked puzzled &quot;Uhh Sprinkles hows wees gonna do dat, mees still too confuseded.&quot; &quot;Ok&quot;, Sprinket spoke with a measured tone, &quot;This ship will drill into the underside of the island, causeing the island to collapse into the sea forcing the clerics to gate out! Now don't you worry that big useless mellon of yours, just keep running!&quot;<br />
<br />
As Sprinket sloshed to the bridge, he noticed the water was now up to he knees. With a rumble, a shutter and a loan groan the main engine of the Wonderoussubmersableislandsinkingdrill sprang to life.  &quot;I want full power to the drill! All ahead full!  Prepare for impact!&quot; AS the Wonderoussubmersableislandsinkingdrill's drill bit into the soft tropical island bedrock, Sprinket could not help but think, &quot;I wonder if there will be earthquakes?&quot;</div></div><hr />

   &quot;Yes, I see it. But what does it mean?&quot; Purrelu asked.<br />
   Suddenly the pair was aware of a disturbance in the air behind them. Arafys tapped her Bracer of the Hidden, and saw her friend Iliadar standing behind her off about 30 feet or so. <br />
   &quot;Hah, I knew I couldn'ta be sneakin up on such as yerself.&quot; <br />
   &quot;What are you doing here Ili? Last I heard, you were in Kael with the raid.&quot; <br />
   &quot;Aye, I was, but those two 'clerics' yer halflin here brought in were imposters. Ogres, bedeviled by enchanter magics. I saw it wear off.&quot;<br />
   &quot;Damn that Iksar!&quot; Arafys was furious, and when she turned to look at the beachfront, it shimmered a bit. She looked harder, willing herself to not believe. And suddenly, as real as it had seemed, it was gone. &quot;Son of the Howler! It was all an illusion! Where Ili... Where are the blasted clerics?&quot;<br />
   &quot;I overheard that one Zylle talking about that island in Erud's Crossing. He said this was a setup to keep people away from the real prize.&quot; Iliadar shrugged. Be careful my friend, he's a wily one. <br />
   &quot;Damn and Blast! Purrelu, make with the travelin. We're goin to Odus.&quot;<br />
<br />
   Landing in the sickly yellow tinged forest, the trio ran quickly through the forest. Coming to the marble city of Erudin, Arafys wasted no time in getting to the docks. There was a miserable little gnome sitting there, chained to the end of the dock. <br />
   &quot;You want to go to Erud's Crossing?&quot; It asked pathetically.<br />
   &quot;Yes, we do. Why are you chained to the dock little one?&quot;<br />
   &quot;The boats that travel this route have been sunk by 'bandits'&quot; he said, making the fingerwiggling motions in the air.<br />
   &quot;I see. Would these bandits look like elves and dwarves and whatnot, wearing plate and carrying water sprinklers?&quot;<br />
   &quot;Aye, you know them? Ah, never mind, Off you go.&quot;<br />
   Arafys was barely able to get the three of them invisible before being sent to Club Med.<br />
<br />
   Dropping in neatly next to a few lobster-red high elves, Arafys knew she had the right place. Iliadar tossed off an area-effect snare, and whisked the unsuspecting 3 back to The Wakening Lands. Arafys and Purrelu dashed for cover as she knew the camo spells wouldn't last much longer. &quot;Now we watch and wait Purr.&quot; She said with an evil grin.<br />
<br />
  Back at the raid...<br />
   Iliadar popped in to The Wakening Lands and prepared. he had sent magical word ahead to the raid. When the 3 horribly sunburned clerics fell into the portal, they were stunned, and bodily moved to the entrance of Kael Drakkel where 3 evil, grinning necromancers waited with glee. The 3 paladins walking behind them, tapping their Deepwater Bracers to keep the clerics stunned, marched forward grimly, not wanting to do this, but having no choice. The clerics were dropped in front of the necromancers who immediately began binding them to the area. A shaman was on hand, to tend to their burns and revitalize them. The General came forward. <br />
  &quot;Ahh, my wayward friends, I see you have returned to the raid. Well, we have missed you. Take your places. We have a giant king to kill. Be good, and there may be less punishment for you.&quot;<br />
   The 3 elves clutched each other and began to sob. They knew that the vacation was over for them. Barring a miracle, they were stuck.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Galavant</div><div class="date">10-09-2002, 09:48 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The sounds of thunder and battle echoed through Kael Drakkal, coming closer and closer to Tormax's castle. The raiders looked up from their interrogation of the captured clerics to see a fleeing giant, surrounded by spinning skulls of fear, chased by an Unswerving Hammer. Then the ground shook in a mighty Upheaval, and the giant fell.<br />
<br />
The group of warriors, rangers, shackled druids, and other assorted misfits watched warily as an armored dwarf, a mighty summoned Hammer shining in his hand, stepped through the clearing smoke. For a moment, he surveyed the situation, and they heard him draw a slow, angry breath. His armor creaked as his grip flexed around the haft of his divine weapon.<br />
<br />
&quot;ALL RIGHT,&quot; the dwarf bellowed. &quot;WHO'S IN BLOODY CHARGE HERE!?&quot;<br />
<br />
The raiders all looked at each other and shuffled uncomfortably. Finally one, a heavily-armored dark elf with Innoruuk's Curse in his hands, stepped forward. &quot;I am. I suppose you're here about the captured clerics?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Aye, that I am,&quot; the dwarf answered. &quot;I know ye miss our aid now, but ye sure didn't before, except for your precious raids and power-levels. Let's get something clear. We're willin' ta help ye, but that means ye have to help us too. That means respect. That means not treatin' us like we're obligated to help ye, because we're NOT. We dinna got to drop everything to rush across the world to whatever idea ye got in yer fool heads. We dinna choose to be clerics in order to be servants. Let those three go now, and maybe, just maybe, I'll stick around to teach yer druids a thing or two about healing.&quot;<br />
<br />
The inky drew hinself up to his full five-foot height, glowering down at the dwarf. &quot;And if we refuse?&quot;<br />
<br />
The dwarf merely hefted his hammer and grinned broadly as he emphasized his words. &quot;N0 R3$ 4 J00!!!&quot;<br />
<br />
The crowd gasped aloud, and stepped back in fear. The dark elf, strained to maintain his composure, glared at the grinning dwarf. &quot;You wouldn't dare...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I've dared a lot of things, lad,&quot; the dwarf calmly replied. He glanced back at the dead giant behind him, pulled a flask from his belt and took a drink, sighed, and turned to smile almost pityingly at the shadowknight. &quot;Don't test me.&quot;<br />
<br />
The raid leader stared silently at the dwarf for several long moments, his jaw quivering beneath his skull- faced helm. Finally, he gestured to the clerics, and in a strained voice, he said, &quot;Release them.&quot;<br />
<br />
As the clerics were freed from their chains, the dwarf laughed aloud and began to cast a spell. Bottles of beer appeared in his hands, and he began to pass them around. &quot;Right then, lads! I knew we could work this out!&quot; He pointed to the line of wolf-formed druids, who had discovered that by counting their legs, they could remember to count to four. &quot;Come over here and gather round, pups, and let me teach ye what we call rotation math! See now, all ye got to do is follow my lead, and we can work this out together...oh wait, one more thing.&quot;<br />
<br />
The dwarf turned back to the shadowknight, who was fairly trembling with fury. His face was deadly serious.<br />
<br />
&quot;By the way,&quot; the dwarf said casually, &quot;If I hear one more thing about clerics being clapped in irons, made to do things they don't want to do, I've got something FAR worse than no resses for ye.&quot;<br />
<br />
The dwarf paused.<br />
<br />
Troubled by the silence, the inky blurted out, &quot;And what is that?&quot;<br />
<br />
The dwarf gave a grin so psychotic that it made even the evil dark elf step back. And he spoke in a low, menacing whisper as he intoned the terrible words. &quot;BRELL'S CURSE OF WATERY BEER.&quot;<br />
<br />
And the dwarf roared with laughter, as the entire raid keeled over in a dead faint.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Cali</div><div class="date">10-09-2002, 11:03 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">As I looked at the unlikely pair in my hut, I rolled my eyes and promised to be more perceptive from now on.  First a skeleton and now this!  I must be slipping.<br />
<br />
&quot;Evening ladies, how can I help you?&quot; I say to the pair.<br />
<br />
The gangly barbarian lass pouts as she tries to sit on the elven sized chair.  Her knees are almost to her chin which puts the spear in her hand at an akward position, not to mention the kilt.  &quot;Why you go away? Mes not big nough yet fer ya to go tooo!&quot; she whined.<br />
<br />
The small gnome bouncing on the bed giggled and looked smug.  &quot;Ha! I told ye yer time was limited.  Now ye must return!&quot;<br />
<br />
I scowl at the wizard and make a move to punt her.  That at least got her off the bed.  &quot;I thought you two were big girls and didnt need me babysitting you?&quot;<br />
<br />
Calbrazan sighs heavily and rests her head on her hands, white blond pigtails falling into her face.  &quot;But we be lonly now.&quot; <br />
<br />
I feared not only for the spear in her hands but the chain tunic seemed a bit precariously made on such a large frame.  Trying my most soothing smile I say &quot;Honey, hasn't your Daddy been watching out for you?&quot;  Nodding encouragingly at her I mention, &quot;I have been sending him letters daily.&quot;<br />
<br />
Great tears begin falling down the young shaman's face. &quot;Daddy campd cus he got tird o solon an ya wernt der!&quot;<br />
<br />
Giggling and dancing upon the table the gnome taunts me more. &quot;Ha hA!  I told ye yer time was up! Now ye must git home an take up yer healing again.  Wouldnt want that great big lout to die or nothing now would ye?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hush now Calimyrn, cant you see you are distressing Calbrazan?&quot; I admonish the blasted gnome as the poor barbarian sobs harder.  Sighing heavily I flop onto the bed.  First a skeleton in my kitchen and now this.  Must Tunare always test my patience?<br />
<br />
&quot;Now now girls, how about we bed down for the night and see what we can decide in the morning?&quot; I say as I pray for strength or a remote cabin in the wilds of Jagged Pine.   &quot;I promise things will look better in the morning.&quot;<br />
<br />
With much rusttling and digging in bags the two bed down on aviak feather stuffed bags with soft woven mandrake blankets.  The gnome under the table and the barbarian taking up pretty much all of the floor.  Brushing the remaining sand off my feet I slip into bed hoping that I can reclaim some portion of my freedom in the morning.<br />
<br />
My last thoughts before sleep claimed me were what was I going to fix for breakfast as my supply gnome pretty much captive of the large shaman sprawled between her and the door...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Xorena</div><div class="date">10-10-2002, 12:08 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Wonderoussubmersableislandsinkingdrill's drill bit bored through the soft tropical bedrock, and continued boring... and boring... Suddenly the boat lurched forward, and Sprinket fell off his perch on the main deck.<br />
<br />
Sprinket slowly withdrew the drill and peered into the Wonderoussubmersableislandsinkingdrill viewer.<br />
<br />
Bertog heard a loud thump above and felt the ship shudder and grow still. The last movement had thrown him nearly off his treadmill.<br />
<br />
&quot;Boss?&quot; shouted Bertog above the din. &quot;BOSS! Yoos dere?&quot;<br />
<br />
No answer.<br />
<br />
He listened intently, and he stopped running on the treadmill. No sound. He lurched up the stairs to the main deck, and shielded his eyes from the hot sun.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sprinket? Boss? Where yoos...&quot;<br />
<br />
Bertog stared in rapt attention as a large white tentacle appeared over the edge of the boat and snaked around as if it were sniffing for a meal. It scooted along the edge of the deck, but when it found the edge of Sprinket's leg, the tentacle whipped through the air and around the gnome.<br />
<br />
&quot;NOOOOOOOOOOOOO!! Yoos cannot have Sprinket!&quot;<br />
<br />
Bertog grabbed the only weapon available, the spear-shaped guiding rod for the Wonderoussubmersableislandsinkingdrill, and raced to the edge of the boat. Sprinket hung limp in the grasp of the tentacle, but he could not reach him.<br />
<br />
Bertog leaned over the edge of the boat, his massive weight nearly tipping it over, and heaved the spear into the depths toward where the tentacle joined the massive albino body.<br />
<br />
Sprinket fell into the water with a loud splash, and the creature retreated into the depths, leaving a blue trail of blood behind it. Bertog, furious with fear, yelled after the retreating creature.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yoos come back! Me show yoo what Bertog is made of! Yoos leave gnomes alone! Dey not food!&quot;<br />
<br />
Coughing and sputtering overboard reminded him that he had better things to do than taunting, so he dipped Sprinket from the water and uncerimoniously dumped him back on the deck.<br />
<br />
Bruises ringed his legs from the suckers on the tentacle, and he was somehow missing his pants. No worse for the wear, he thought, and he raised his hand to his face, which hurt quite a lot.<br />
<br />
A large bruise ringed his eye, where he viewed the Wonderoussubmersableislandsinkingdrill through the viewer. He didn't quite remember what he saw through the viewer. The vision was still hazy and to be quite honest he was glad.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sprinket, yoos okay? Bertog worried.&quot;<br />
<br />
Sprinket studied the ogre for a minute. &quot;Yes, thanks to you apparently. Now, let's see if we can get some help from the clerics. I bet they would fix us up. Hop back on the treadmill and we can head to shore.&quot;<br />
<br />
Sprinket took his spot back on the helm as the boat lurched to life once again. Details were coming back to him now. That awful white tentacle. What on earth was it? Getting scooped from the ocean and a reverberating message went through his mind:<br />
<br />
&quot;Yoos leave gnomes alone! Dey not food!&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Arafys</div><div class="date">10-10-2002, 12:35 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Day breaks to find Arafys and Purrelu standing vigil over the encampment of clerics. &quot;There's so many of them Purr, I don't know how on Tunare's green land I'm supposed to get them all out of here.&quot; <br />
  &quot;Nor do I,&quot; Purrelu yawned as he dislodged some sand from his leggings. &quot;We have to do something though, my magical message receiver was buzzin in my ear all night.&quot; <br />
   &quot;Mine too. I wonder if,&quot; Arafys' thought was broken by a sharp jolt that seemed to reverberate through the island. Casting a quick camouflage on herself and Purr, they ran to see the source of the disturbance. <br />
   &quot;There,&quot; she said softly so only the druid's ears could hear, &quot; There's a boat.&quot; <br />
   &quot;You know your eyes are better than mine Milady, I can't see half the things you can.&quot;<br />
   &quot;Nevertheless, there's a boat, and it appears to be heading this way.&quot;<br />
   Arafys and Purrelu watched in silent contemplation as the gnomish vessel ran up on the island, almost making it out of the water before falling over on its side. After a minute or so, an Ogre and a Gnome crawled out of the wreckage. They both looked injured. <br />
   &quot;May I go to them Lady? They appear hurt.&quot;<br />
   &quot;Yes, be cautious though, I will be behind you in case they are hostile.&quot;<br />
   <br />
  She heard Purr open his spell book, no doubt to memorize an evacuation spell, and spells of healing. Purr was always a cautious druid due to being mostly brought up by a ranger. <br />
   &quot;Hail fellows, do you be friend or foe?&quot; the halfling asked from seemingly nowhere.<br />
   &quot;Huh? Who dere? You show yourself or Me bash good!&quot;<br />
   <br />
   At this Purr dropped the camo, and began casting a healing spell on the ogre. He wasn't hurt too badly, and the magic mended his wounds fully. Purr was thankful he had reached the rank of Wanderer in his guild. The ogre scratched his butt as ogres are wont to do when they think, and sat down on the sand. <br />
   &quot;Can you fix Sprinket? He hurt too. Big sea monster try make snack out of him.&quot;<br />
   Purr cast another heal, and the welts on Sprinket's body faded. <br />
   &quot;Why are you here Sir Gnome?&quot;<br />
   &quot;I'm here to destroy this island&quot;<br />
    &quot;That is unacceptable,&quot; Arafys said from her position behind Purrelu, &quot; There is indigenous life here, and destroying the island would have adverse affects on the region.&quot;<br />
   &quot;Who...&quot; The gnome began as Arafys came into view. He looked at the swords cascading with lightning strapped to her back, and thought for a moment. &quot;Well, how else would ye get the clerics back. Bertog and those like him can't deal with the druids... They're difficult...&quot;<br />
   Purrelu bristled at this until Arafys said, &quot; You're different Purr, I raised you to not be like them. He doesn't mean you.&quot;<br />
   &quot;Bertog like Purr-loo, he gived me heelin&quot;<br />
   The gnome looked thoughtful for a moment. &quot;Why don't we go to the source... I heard her name was Electrae.&quot;<br />
   &quot;Yes, perhaps she might be able to talk some sense into the priests.&quot; Arafys said. &quot;Let's go.&quot;<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Trevelain</div><div class="date">10-10-2002, 01:37 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The ground beneath my feet began to shake as I heard a rumbling coming from the reef.  I steadied myself and gazed out upon the light blue waters to see a contraption I must say I had never laid eyes upon before.  It appeared to be DRILLING into the side of the island!<br />
<br />
As I stood and watched, a grand white tentacle slithered out from the reef.  I must admit, it was quite a surprise as I had bathed their not less than 1/2 an hour ago.<br />
<br />
I grabbed the hilt of my sword at my side, pulling the blade out slowly when to my shock the tentacle retreated holding a Gnome.  As I stood laughing at the Gnome's plight, I witnessed an OGRE, a veritable OGRE charge forth from beneath decks to rescue the Gnome.  I retreated once more into the woods as the two came ashore and strolled off into the forest...<br />
<br />
Once they had left, I made up my mind to track down that beast and find out what was happening.  It was easy to follow the blue blood through the thin tide, one would not need a Ranger to do such an easy task.<br />
<br />
I continued sloshing through the surf until I finally rounded a bend along a rock formation and peered out upon the Dark Elf lagoon again.  Remembering the events of the previous night, I decided it best to retreat, lest the Cleric see me again, and as I turned my back what should I feel but a clammy tentacle wrap around my waist.<br />
<br />
I laughed inwardly to myself, as this creature had no idea just WHAT he was messing with.  Then, as it drug me underwater I came to the realization I didnt have my armor on (Thankfully?), and Innoruuk knows a Dark Forged Bahamashorts AC isn't too huge.<br />
<br />
The tentacle began to squeeze as I tried to draw the sword at my side...so hard that I gave up all hope of un-sheathing the blade.  As I began to slip into unconciousness, cursing myself for leaving my Fishbone Earring behind, a sudden thought came to mind.  It was &quot;kind&quot; enough to touch me, I should return the favor...<br />
<br />
I placed my right hand upon the head of the beast dragging my body to it's beaklike mouth and, with due rage and hatred, channeled the energy of my very being into the creature in a flash of an Unholy Aura.<br />
<br />
The tentacle weakened and I swam heartily towards the surface.  Just as I was about to pass out I broke the surface of the water and heaved great breathes of air, and to quite a welcoming message.<br />
<br />
(Taunting A_Frying_Pan_101 Master)<br />
<br />
I summoned my strength on the shore and then went back DOWN their for the beast.  After cutting it into several pieces, I began to drag it back to the food hut with quite a few eyes on me (You'd think Cleric's had never seen a dead creature before /shrug).<br />
<br />
After about two hours the beast was piled nicely within the cookhouse, ready for the evening feast or what have you.  I gave Goner another buff or two...the poor guys' been working his whole vacation away...and decided it was near-time I find a purpose for myself here.<br />
<br />
In a drunken stupor did I overhear dwarves speaking of a place called &quot;Brodder's&quot;  Gambling, Drinking, and such frivalries supposedly ran amoke there.  Sounded like my kind of place...<br />
<br />
I know stroll off to see if he could use a body-guard, bouncer, or all-around hired thug.  Hey, it's just not fun if ALL you do is sit AFK, now is it?<br />
<br />
(Takes a swig of Brell's Blessed Stout)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Smakz the Tank</div><div class="date">10-10-2002, 01:43 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Sitting on the edge of his bed sharpening his axe, Smakz looks through the window, sniffs the air and perks up his ears.  Looking over to his friend, still asleep in the early morning air, smakz rumbles &quot;Xith, Wake up, I smell battle&quot;.<br />
<br />
With a fury unknown to those untrained in combat, he was adorned in his armor before the groggy dark elf sat up in bed.<br />
<br />
5 minutes later, the Dark elf, adorned in all his most arcane garments, and the battle hardend Vah Shir, holding a giant stone bladed axe in his hand, a battle hammer, and a formidable axe hanging from his belt, marched out of there secluded hut to find Electrae.<br />
<br />
Wandering out to the beech to see a massive gnomish sailing vessel on shore, Smakz suddenly feels a little warmer than usual, peering at his friend, Xith smiles and points at his feet.  Smakz never was too comfortable with all the weird magical cantations Xith had worked into his clothing.<br />
<br />
as they approach a scene unfolding on the shore, Xith with his enhanced elven hearing hears something muttered ... &quot;&quot;I'm here to destroy this island&quot;''.  Then mummbles arcane words to himself, and suddenly appears right in front of a party of 4, ranger with swords drawn, a gnome, an ogre, and a druid.<br />
<br />
&quot;You best get back on your boat and leave this place, they will come when they want to.&quot; Smakz, puffing, half out of breath runs up behind his friend, and stands defensively in front of the more frail wizard.  Hefting his axe from side to side, he drops it, and draws his axe in one hand, hammer in another, all in one smooth motion.<br />
<br />
&quot;You be more than we, but i gaurantee, ill take one of you out, Xith will finish the rest with ease.&quot;  Xith, opening a bulging bag, with dials and funny writing all over it, seeming of gnomish design, empties its contents on the ground. &quot;the mages came in handy before they left&quot;, as 20 or so mod rods tumble down in front of him. Pointing his staff, blessed by Solusek Ro himself at the ranger, mutters &quot;your first&quot;, closes his eyes, and begins to concentrate.<br />
<br />
&quot;when me friend has a target, id dont live long, So you best second guess your original intentions, and head back to the mainland&quot;, Eyeing the ogre from head to toe, but focues last on the druid, the second threat.&quot;  When all of a sudden, a green aura envelops the party of 4, seeing Xith out of the corner of his eye, he knew what had happend. &quot;and you wont be running too far, my companion has seen to that, should you try to resist&quot;<br />
<br />
Screaming in a voice fit to lead armies, smakz rumbles as loud as he can &quot;They've come to destroy the Island&quot;, raises his weapons in a salute to glory, shouts his well worn battle cry, and charges the quartet.  Just as the warrior covers half the ground between him and the party, the ranger is knocked back by an immense blast of energy, leaving nothing but her boots left where she was.  Turning back, the wizard already tossing spent mod rods over his shoulder, already ready to finish the next target.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">yshva</div><div class="date">10-10-2002, 01:54 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">a moment of lucidity returns.  I realize I've been deep within these caves for quite some time...<br />
<br />
I take stock of my person: My trusty Hammer of Divinity is at my side; my Aegolistic blessing from Tunare still glows fiercely around me; and my Unswerving Hammer of Faith is my trusted companion.<br />
<br />
I turn the corner and find another one of those crawlers slipping out of the lava ducts and waving its mandibles at me.  The rage takes over, and I charge after the beast...<br />
<br />
...some time later, I am able to look around again... one of the beasts legs twitches once, then lies still.  These spiders drop a fair amount of silk, I'll have to make something nice from that.<br />
<br />
I notice several burn marks and that thing had the audacity to gash up my leg! the nerve, ok... a quick CH and back to new.<br />
<br />
(/ooc reminiscent of those Orbit Gum commercials... &quot;But does your mouth feel clean?!&quot; **CH'CHING** &quot;Fabulous!&quot;)<br />
<br />
The smell of sulfur is nearly overwhelming, but I pull out a silk hanky and make my way down the hallway towards a room covered in cobwebs... I see a couple bodies that look somewhat petrified and wrapped in cobwebs... My hammer still in hand, I look around for any sort of beast that might have done this.<br />
<br />
My light shines off some obsidian gems set in the wall of the back.  The gems turn their gaze to look back at me... those aren't obsidians! That's a stone spider!! I start a deluge of prayers to Tunare to help me out... ROOT! nothing. STUN! nothing. JUDGEMENT! nothing. MOK! nothing. MOR! nothing.  I backed away, and the spider kept advancing slowly, its steady gait promouncing its victory.<br />
<br />
I grab my hammer and start swinging, letting the rage take me over, while staving off that beast so I can keep casting spot heals on myself.<br />
<br />
Time seems to drag on, but my hammer is able to affect the spider where I could not.  with a final bit of strength, I grab my hammer in both hands and slam it down on the spider and it shatters - bits and pieces of it breaking off.  One of its eyes roll out, and I pick it up to look into it... it's actually a perfect crystal in which I can seem to see distant places... I see up the ramp and around the corner and there are a couple fire giants dozing in chairs.  I see past them and down a hall to a river of lava.  I see the lava leads to a tower with more giants up top, but *GASP* there is a form huddled at its base... could this be? I must get up there, but I'll never be able to sneak past those giants in full platemail...<br />
<br />
But wait, there was that lava river... perhaps... I send my vision back down the river to see if it could just possibly be a way around the lava.  Lo and behold, the river drops to a bit to a pool of lava right where I fought that last crawler... <br />
<br />
Ok, the time for action... I put all my gear away, seal it all up, and cast my fire resist spell... the lava is really hot, but my armor is able to deflect most of the damage... ow ow ow ow.  I pull myself up onto the rocky shores on the other side of those snoozing guards, and quietly cast another CH. I'm far enough away from them now that if I don't make too incredible a noise, I should be able to sneak up on my prey mostly unannounced...<br />
<br />
As I creep past, I find a ledge where a half-dozen monks are just sleeping... looks like they got tired of feigning death, and passed out... the smell of sulfur in this place tends to do that to people.  I continue on...<br />
<br />
&quot;Would you like to see some Oil of Fennin Ro I just got... YOU!!!&quot;<br />
I pull out my shimmering pearl and shove it into Zordak Ragefire's hands.  He shrieks like a girl and vanishes, leaving my pearl on the ground in front of me.  I pick it up, and wander back over to some of the monks, who wok up with his shriek.<br />
<br />
&quot;What are you all doing here? can I get you anything while I'm here? I can summon some food and water for you, or cure any burns or other maladies&quot; (Well, I *am* a cleric after all).<br />
<br />
&quot;We here are the Keepers of the List - those clerics allowed to speak with Zordak in a specific order.  However, all the clerics seemed to have wandered off, mentioning something about a 'Club Med'... and we've been stranded here since, duty bound to just watch and wait for a worthy cleric to come along and completey screw up our schedule.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, I'm sorry, I didn't see anyone else here, so I assumed you all were here for some other reason...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, when all the clerics heard the siren song, they seemed to simply vanish off the face of Norrath, and we simply don't have the healing capacity to sneak out of here with our lives.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, let me free you from your prison... Gather around, and I shall fill you with Tunare's Blessing of Aegolism.&quot;  I get all the monks together, cast my spell, and discuss tactics for escaping here... The problem appears to be those 2 fire giant guards at the door.<br />
<br />
&quot;Those wimps? They're big and dumb and slow. Here, we'll show you!&quot;  They proceeded to do what monks do best, and we killed those 2 guards at the entrance in short order.  <br />
<br />
Like a team of acrobatic circus performers, they strutted their way through the fire giants in the castle... killing warriors and wizards alike, felling them like saplings in a tornado.  Even King Tranix and Warlord Skarlon were no match for these guys...<br />
<br />
My hammer grows heavy, and the monks were starting to tire.  I tell them, &quot;Thank you for the kind display, but it's time to leave this place.  My lungs are burning up from breathing all this ash.  Good luck finding your friends...&quot;<br />
<br />
The lead monk looks nervously at me and says, &quot;When you see our cleric friends, tell them we miss them...&quot;<br />
<br />
Not knowing precisely what he means, I make my way out to the sun rising over the mountain peaks.  Despite the desolate landscape of smoke and rock and lava, I hear a faint jingle on the air coming from far away to the west...<br />
<br />
and a strange odor... of mangoes and coconut oil??<br />
I think I need a vacation...<br />

<br />
&quot;Bill, wake up damn you.  I need some advice.&quot;  She shook the bird gently.   <br />
<br />
He cracked open an eye and remarked dryly, &quot;Just wing it.&quot;  Then he passed out again.<br />
<br />
&quot;Very funny.  Stupid bird.&quot;<br />
<br />
Electrae took off running down the beach towards the commotion.<br />
A number of other clerics were too.<br />
<br />
A wizard was blowing smoke off his finger, an ogre warrior, fully armored and armed was charging some odd looking people and a pair of ranger boots were smouldering on the beach.  It looked like another class balance argument had broken out.  <br />
<br />
Electrae really wasn't in a mood for violence.  She wasn't dressed for it, was half-tipsy, half-hung-over, but what's a girl going to do?  She hoped she could remember how, it'd been so long since she done this.<br />
<br />
She cleared her throat and yelled, &quot;14 NAKED AND VERY LONELY VESTAL VIRGINS IN THE HOT TUB!&quot;. <br />
<br />
It worked.  They were all momentarily stunned.  She knew she had just seconds to work.  That stun command was really useful, but you had to really know how to use it.  <br />
<br />
&quot;Root 'em.  Keep the casters stunned until  you have them bound and gagged.   Take away their weapons.  Get that pair of boots, maybe we can ressurrect whatever used to wear them.&quot;  She barked orders to the rest of the assembled clerics, at least the ones that didn't run off to look for the lonely vestal virgins.<br />
<br />
The big ogre took a lot of vines to tie up, but eventually the clerics managed to subdue the big lug.  Once everyone was sufficiently neutralized she pointed at the boots.  &quot;Let's get this one back, then we can start asking some questions&quot;.   Someone with fewer spiritual doubts than herself managed a supplication and a female ranger lay gasping and ill next to the boots.  <br />
<br />
&quot;Ok, tie her up and lets get some questions answered&quot;.  <br />
<br />
Electrae paced back and forth.  Bill wheezed gently.  She tried to think back to that continuing education class she audited, &quot;Beginning Interrogation Techniques&quot;.  She had dropped out because it just didn't seem like her thing.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ok, I'm going to ask questions and I want answers.  I want good answers.  If I don't like the answers I hear, if I think you're lying... I'm going to... &quot;,  Electrae tried to think of something, &quot;I'm going to... be very, very... vexed.  And trust me, if there's one thing you don't want, it's me being vexed.&quot;  Electrae tried to scowl dangerously.<br />
<br />
In a moment of lucidity she remembered her long-time rogue associate, Panamah Malfleur, threatening to use burning bamboo to give her a manicure. <br />
<br />
&quot;I need a couple of volunteers to cut down a few bamboo canes slice them into thin strips, and another volunteer to start a fire.  We might need to perform a manicure or two on our uninvited guests.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Staring with the smelly gnome in unwashed gym shorts, I want this question answered:  What the hell do you think you're doing?   No wait, tell me why you're here and what this disturbance is all about.&quot;<br />
<br />
Electrae tapped her foot impatiently.  &quot;And if any of you tries anything funny, I'll be performing manicures on you with these bits of flaming bamboo and I warn you!  I'm not a licensed aesthetician, it might not go well!&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Balanar</div><div class="date">10-10-2002, 02:49 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">After hearing Electrae's shout I took off with 4~5 other Clerics for the Hot Tub.<br />
<br />
We all came to a screeching Halt as the only person in the Hot Tub was a Lady Troll Shaman by the name of &quot;Aphrodiety Luvgawddess&quot;. She started to get out of the pool in a very thin bathing suit that looked like it was made out of Neteled Kelp. She told us in what was ment to be a seductive voice &quot;Com'ere Big Boys. LEt the Luv Godess show yous a good time.&quot;<br />
<br />
The only sound for 5 secs was a quiet &quot;Eeep&quot; from one of the Clerics behind me. We were all to stunned from the sight to move or do anything else.<br />
<br />
Once we regained control over our bodies we all ran off screaming with bad mental pictures that were going to haunt our nightmares for the rest of our lives.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Arafys</div><div class="date">10-10-2002, 05:00 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Arafys came to consciousness and was immediately bound hand and foot, an extremely angry cleric in front of her shouting about manicures. She looked over to see Purrelu bound as well. For some reason he was also gagged, then she realized she was being gagged as well. The cleric turned her attention to the gnome. Perfect, Arafys thought. Purrelu flashed a hand signal to Arafys, indicating he had an evac up and ready to go. Arafys signaled back, &quot;How?&quot;<br />
&quot;I am nothing if not resourceful Milady. You taught me that. Be ready to move.&quot;<br />
<br />
Arafys smiled around the gag as she knew it would come in handy to learn the hand language. <br />
<br />
&quot;Taunting a Dish Master&quot; Arafys heard as the skeletal servant dropped a silver serving tray. The rolling crash heard masked Purrelu's casting as he tapped his Elder Spiritist Bracer. In seconds, he and Arafys were in wolf form. The clerics were confused as to what was happening, it seemed too many days of sun and dwarven brew had addled their minds, just enough for the brave halfling's plan to work. The bindings no longer fitting, they dashed away to the north. Arafys quickly regained her gear as she knew the confused clerics would be giving chase. Purrelu began casting. As the clerics appeared over the ridge, they were too late, Purr and Ara discorporated in a portal of wind. <br />
<br />
Dropping into the Emerald Jungle, the duo quickly set about buffing themselves up. Not to be taken unawares again. <br />
&quot;Let's go home Purr, we don't have the power to take them.&quot; Arafys hated to admit defeat, but she was right this time. They ported back to the raid, and hoped they weren't too late to smack some giants around.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lenara</div><div class="date">10-10-2002, 05:20 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Far off in the frozen tundra of the Eastern Wastes, Lenara sat in quiet meditation. Her pale, skinny high elven butt protected from the cold by several high quality walrus hides.<br />
<br />
Avianna, her long time partner, stood over the fallen corpse of an Ulthork man-o-war and tucked yet another bloody tusk into her back pack.  Avi glanced back at her cleric.<br />
<br />
&quot;How's mana?&quot; she asked her eyes already searching for a new foe to slay.<br />
<br />
&quot;Another moment please.&quot; <br />
<br />
Avianna nodded and moved closer standing watch over Lenara.  Off in the distance she could see two hulking beasts moving toward them.<br />
<br />
&quot;Two incomming..&quot; she whispered.<br />
<br />
&quot;Good to go.&quot; Lenara said and beamed a smile at the warrior.<br />
<br />
Avianna moved forward and prepared herself for battle. As the beasts moved closer Avi discovered they were not the ulthorks they had been hunting but a pair of Ogre warriors dragging something behind them. It appeared to be the body of a halfling.<br />
moving back to the cleric side she relayed the information to Lenara.<br />
<br />
&quot;Just a couple Ogres dragging a body. Looks like you have to do another ressurection.&quot;<br />
<br />
Lenara sighed, this was one reason they came out to this place, to get away from the constant requests, and to hunt in peace.<br />
<br />
Ever watchful of her cleric, Avianna moved to intercept the pair.  THe ogres stopped in front of Avi looking past her at the cleric.<br />
<br />
&quot;We're busy here state your business!&quot;<br />
<br />
The ogres looked at Avianna then the cleric.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yooz gotem un elfie?&quot; one said rubbing his head trying hard to think.<br />
<br />
Avianna nodded and watched them closely.<br />
<br />
&quot;Can da elfie fix dis?&quot; the other asked dropping the halfling at Avianna's feet.<br />
<br />
&quot;She can..&quot; Avi told them positioing herself between them and her cleric.<br />
<br />
The larger of the two thrust a bag of platinum into Avianna's hands.<br />
<br />
&quot;You make da elfie fix!&quot;<br />
<br />
Avianna smirked and nodded to the cleric who then stood and whispered a prayer to Tunare and cast restoration on the halfling. A moment later the ogre's drew thier weapons and looked menacingly at Avianna.<br />
<br />
&quot;We am takin da elfie and yooz can keep da halfthing!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Over my dead body..&quot;<br />
<br />
Avianna stepped back and drew both her swords glancing back at Lenara who nodded signaling she was ready for battle.  The poor halfling sensing danger skuttled behind the cleric and began to meditate in earnest.<br />
<br />
&quot;We am tew big ogrum and you am one little humee gurlie. We iz gunna barsh yooz now!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I just dont think so.&quot; they heard the cleric say before she whipsered a scared word stunning both of them.<br />
<br />
Lenara feared and then rooted the larger one while Avianna worked on the smaller. From behind her Lenara could hear the halfling whispering prayers to Karana and giggeling maniacly.<br />
<br />
Root broke on the larger ogre and he began to move in on Avianna. The halfling leaped over the cleric sitting in front of him and yelled.<br />
<br />
&quot;Weeeeeeee KITE!!&quot;<br />
<br />
The druid snarred and cast his dots on his former captor and his hairy little feet began to fly across the snow covered ground. Ogers not being the brightest of beings gave chase.  Lenara kept watch on her warrior casting a heal or two when necessary.  Meanwhile the druid ran in circle  around them giddy to be casting offensive spells again.<br />
<br />
Finally the two ogres lay dead.  The little halfling ran over to the two women and hugged them both about the knees thanking them profusely.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ohhhh please let me stay here with you.. it was horrible, I had no idea!  I can cook! and SoW and and I'll port you anywhere you wanna go.. just please please dont send me back to the healing chain.&quot;  the druid fell to his knees and looked up at them.<br />
<br />
&quot;Just a moment..&quot; Avi said and pulled Lenara out of his hearing distance.<br />
<br />
&quot;What the heck is he babbbling about?&quot; the cleric asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Beats me.. but it would be nice not to have to run everywhere.. and you did want to go see the City of Mist.&quot;<br />
<br />
Avianna grinned and began to plot their next adventure.  She had been warned by a friendly Enchanter they knew to keep Lenara as far as possible from &quot;Club Med&quot;.</div></div><hr />

<br />
With a startled oath as a second tremor knocked him out of the tree, Gniss declared, &quot;Ah bugger it, I'll fix this journal after my vacation!&quot;<br />
<br />
Slipping off the grass and over to a rock, he placed his hands on the rock, and prayed to brell for the soil of the island to tell him what was going on.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hmmm, the dishwasher's master is killing an octopus that wrecked a ???? an underwater boat????........Boat was trying to sink the island..... Not smart to try to drill into the side of a volcanic island, glad they stopped before they found a magma tube.....&quot;<br />
<br />
Silence for a few minutes as he scans the island.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hmmm.... Divine barrier starting to fall a bit, Who was supposed to keep an eye on it and pray every once in a while to refresh it?................. Oops..... I forgot to assign shifts for that....&quot;<br />
<br />
More silence....<br />
<br />
&quot;Must be Cali's turn with that monk massuesse, why else would he be in her cabin? Hmm... wonder if I can see any better....&quot;<br />
<br />
Gniss pulls one hand off the rock and smacks himself.<br />
<br />
&quot;Focus Gniss, focus. Let's see..... Servents are actually trolls? Hmmm, a few drinks, some rafts, shouldn't be too hard to ditch them. I'm sure that mage that's landing on the other side of the island wouldn't mind conjuring a few elementals to serve everyone, especially since she looks like she could use a vacation herself. Hmm... She's got a bard with her.... nightly entertainment sounds good...&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
Perfectly willing to let the others sort out the gnome and his ship, Gniss saunters over to the bar and whips up a platter of drinks for the new arrivals on the island, and places it in the open on the bar. whipping up a second platter, he starts off to go convine the mage and bard that they really would prefer to stay for a few weeks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Smakz the Tank</div><div class="date">10-10-2002, 07:52 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Taking a big bite out of a gigantic sandwich smakz turns to his friend and asks &quot;2 days untill you can do that again, jeez, some spell it was, anyway, got any other bright ideas run em by me first&quot;, even though it was Smakz who charged first, he always blamed his mistakes on the wizard.<br />
<br />
Turning to Electrae, Smakz exclaims in a raised voice, loud enough for the prisoners to hear &quot;The bamboo thing is overdone, if you want anwers, get me a stuffed chicken, a bucket of cold olive oil, a toothpick, and a mug&quot; ... &quot;Oh, and some mustard for my sandwich&quot;. Grinning evily, he mutters &quot;they can never resist the oil for long&quot;<br />
<br />
Turning back to the ogre, he realizes, the ivy vines wont hold his bulk much longer, and has a troll &quot;Servant&quot; run and find a blacksmith, to make some chains.<br />
<br />
&quot;They were invading mistress, Smakz was just quicker than the rest&quot; The dark arcane figure explains to Electrae, while standing in a corner. &quot;We came upon them on the beach, and had to do something, he shouted for help, but none came, so we had to do what we thought was right, and i am sorry about the ranger lass, just, when you are outnumberd 2 to 1, you tend to make hasty decisions, i shouldnt have 'burned her, but it was her or me&quot;.  Looking at Smakz with an inquisitive eye, he adds, &quot;Maybe you should let him fortify this place as he wanted to, could save you the trouble later, i can always bring in some of my &quot;apprentices&quot; to keep a watch on the shore, they wont bother anyone, but give word of an invasion before they get here, and all it would take is a few simple watchtowers&quot;.<br />
<br />
&quot;bout time he listend to me, bloody fingerwaggler&quot;, Smakz mutters under his breath, as he beems an innocent smile at Electrae.  &quot;wheres that mustard i wanted, sandwich is kinda bland&quot; as he stuffs the last of it into his mouth, already looking for another snack. &quot;Anyway, i was just doin me job, cant have your lovely resort disrupted by &quot;unwanted types&quot;.&quot;<br />
<br />
Pulling out a few dried herbs he was saving for the local shaman, a mixing bowl, a small sword, and an icepick, Smakz asks for the items he wanted, looks at the prisoners, and asks in the most maniacal voice he can muster, &quot;Shall we begin&quot;.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">yshva</div><div class="date">10-11-2002, 02:17 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Since being in the presence of my Goddess for afternoon tea that time so long ago, I have been able to feel her presence off to the South... I could always figure out what direction I needed to wander, in relation to Tunare's presence.  However, since leaving the smoke filled corridors of Solusek's Eye, I have felt the pull coming from Westward.  What in the world would draw my goddess away from her natural retreat?<br />
<br />
And why am I craving mangoes, grilled iksar kabobs, and fizzy drinks with paper umbrellas? wow - I *REALLY* must have been down in the lava too long.<br />
<br />
Well, I wander around Lavastorm looking for a druid to port me... no one... that's strange. no big loss, those kids can't even count to 4.<br />
<br />
I brazenly meander through Nektulos Forest on my way through to Freeport and the commonlands, nuking every guard I come across.  I probably shouldn't do that to my inkie brethren... they are just doing their jobs.  but its so fun, and they never even see me coming...<br />
<br />
Ok, I kick a couple orcs around and finally make my way to the commonlands where I know the druids tend to hang out... still, no druids to be found anywhere... this is VERY strange.  I hail a passing wizard, and ask him if I can get a teleport from him.  If I can't get a port to Surefall Glade, I'll head to Odus instead and see where I need to go from there.<br />
<br />
The wizard looks me up and down and says, &quot;Hmmph... you're one of those... clerics.  It'll cost you 500pp to go to Odus.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That's an outrage! That's extortioin! I won't pay it!&quot;.<br />
<br />
&quot;Suit yourself. goodbye.&quot; and he wanders off.<br />
<br />
The next 2 wizards I hailed gave me a very similar response... what has gone on here? since when has a cleric of Tunare become more reviled than a necromancer of... well, any necromancer, actually.<br />
<br />
Looks like I need a disguise... unsummon the Hammer of Divinity, put away the platemail, and pull out the sewing kit.  Good thing I had so much silk left over from killing those LDC's... I really didn't imagine I'd need it like this. ok - a nice silk robe.  ok, clean up a little, don the robe, and time to search the area for a wizard who will port a &quot;newbie enchantress&quot;.<br />
<br />
No one in the commonlands will port me, since they know I'm the same cleric that was looking before... damn them.  ok, let's see if  I can fool an inkie into porting me.  not all inkies are bad, just 98.5% percent of them.<br />
<br />
I sneak back into Nektulos forest and make my way to the pyramid where all the wizards hang out.  I come across a dark elf deep in meditation.  <br />
<br />
&quot;Excuse me, sir, might I buy a teleport from you? I'm just a lowly enchantress who needs to get to Erudin to buy my new spells.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;200pp for a high elf like you.&quot; <br />
<br />
?!?! I can't believe that this is so expensive!! &quot;Bbbbut, I'm not really a high elf.  I just have this illusion on so these Arcane people around the pyramid won't attack me!&quot;<br />
<br />
He glowers down at me and says, &quot;ok, that'll be 100pp then&quot;.  This is by far the best deal I've seen so far, so I pull out a small changepurse and hand the wizard the money.  The wizard glowers at me again, trying to figure out why a &quot;newbie&quot; would carry 100pp on herself.  I just smile innocently and he casts the spell that sends me hurtling across Norrath to land next to the Erudite Norrath Scion.<br />
<br />
Not so strangely, the pull from Tunare is coming from the East.  She's probably playing a friendly game of Ashtekashte with Karana.  I wander through Erudin still in my &quot;Enchantress&quot; garb, just in case the prejudice toward clerics extends even this far.  As I approach the end of the dock, I see a very tired gnome in a tattered blue oracle robe chained to the dock.  He looks up into my eyes with a very pleading look and asks, &quot;Would you like to go to [Erud's Crossing]?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Umm, sure..&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Off you go!&quot; VWOOM!<br />
<br />
*GOOSH*<br />
<br />
I appear to have been translocated into a... no... umm... for all but the sheer insanity of it all, I seem to have landed in a vat of guacamole. Apparently this is the custom now, because I see a whole line of scantily clad dwarves and gnomes wielding potato chips and dancing around the vat singing and dancing.<br />
<br />
Some random dwarf walks up to me and shoves some vial of liquid into my hands. &quot;Drink up, miss! It'll make all my troubles just... disappear!&quot;<br />
<br />
I have no idea what he means by this, but I see all the chanting has stopped and all the dwarves and gnomes are looking at me expectantly.  Apparently, this is the new custom... dip your guests in guacamole and serve them liquor.  ok, I down the drink and all the men start cheering.. whatever for I... oh no... oh come now... oh tunare where in the world did that robe dishappeer to? &lt;hic&gt;<br />
<br />
&quot;That'sh good shtuff!&quot; I saw to the dwarf grinning from ear to ear, as he runs off, presumably to get more.... boy, that was potent.. leave it up to a dwarf to brew up a concoction that makes one's clothing disappear... Hmmm... that gives me an idea... once I get all this guacamole cleaned off and get myself situated, I'll have to search for my stacks of crystalline silk...<br />

<br />
&quot;Why is there a cloud of steam over the ocean there... by that big boat thing?  Does anyone else smell sulpher?&quot;<br />
<br />
Suddenly Bill squirmed in Electrae's arm.  She helped the Parrot to an upright position.  <br />
<br />
&quot;The Volcano is going to erupt!&quot; Bill squaked.  &quot;Quick!  We have to throw in a virgin!&quot;.<br />

Electrae gasps, turns red, and quickly looks away as though looking for someone with a big V tattoed on their forehead.<br />

Electrae pulls aside Gniss.  It really was time to check on reality.  Wouldn't do to be having those pesky hallucinations now.<br />

Piikaa had set up a small hut where he was busily making full suits of armor out of woven palm fronds and coconuts (trivial = 88 &lt; 117).  The hats were by far the best sellers, as most of the revelers on AFK Island had decided that they wanted to &quot;work on their tans&quot;...  He had never known such tranquility since his first days in Kaladim.<br />
<br />
Brodder had become even more famous, as he is not only brewing and writing, but gratiously teaching the patrons in his bar the joys of brewing.  Piikaa mused, &quot;I have learned so much from him already, I wonder if GM'ing brewing would be better than getting those last few points in Smithing.&quot;  <br />
<br />
It had come to this, after years of traveling and battling, healing all who stood and delivered, he was enjoying his rest.  No longer concerned with money, armor or weapons, he focused on puttering around the island and groping those beautiful ladies that seemed to be &quot;growing on trees&quot;.  Brell had truely listned to him and the answer to his prayers, though vastly different from what he expected, is something to truely be gratefull.<br />
<br />
How long will this last, he wondered?  What was happening in the rest of the world?  He was curious and being bound in the Nexus, took a chance and cast gate.<br />
<br />
Arriving in the Nexus, he realized that things had indeed changed.  All of his /friends that had outlevelled him long ago were of lower levels now, some even lower than he.<br />
<br />
/tell Warrior Friend &quot;what happened?  I thought you were level 56?  Your showing only 50th now.&quot;<br />

/angry friend &quot;I have tried to keep exploring and fighting, but with no-one but the occational Paladin around, I can't regain my lost experience.  Where the .... have you been?  What the .... is that outfit you are wearing?  Is that a Lei around your neck?<br />

Piikaa replies that he's been to AFK Island, working on his tan and skilling up on baking &amp; brewing.<br />

Diary of Wynterfyre Soulstyce, Shaman of 37 Seasons.<br />
<br />
<br />
Day 30 (I think, I'm losing track so easily)<br />
<br />
It's odd. When I was asked to sign on as the island's shaman, I did it because I needed a break from adventuring. The jokes about the hairy bear butt being in someone's face get tiring after a while. I had heard about the disappearance of several Druids, over a period of weeks. Luckily, the ones in my guild had hidden themselves since they felt they were so useless. I presume they're safe, but I'm not about to compromise their safety by looking for them.<br />
<br />
Besides, this place is a...blast, for lack of a better term. The clerics, for all their preaching, seem to know how to party hardy. Though I will be glad to see clothed dwarves again. And, by the Tribunal, the showers here. Let's just say that there are advantages and disavatages to being nearly 7' tall.<br />
<br />
It has given me a chance to work on my alchemy skills. Sure, I'm not getting paid for the use of them, but that hasn't changed. I'm finding it odd that some of the things I need are available here. I would swear that they're being shipping in somehow. But, except for a few stragglers (bloody monk has taken away a lot of my massage business. May the Tribunal find him guilty of...something nasty), hardly anyone's here by clerics.<br />
<br />
My wolf's been working his spirit tail off. I've been having to make suncreen by the vat, and since no one here wants to give me a hand, he's been carrying it back and forth to the vendors in a little cask around his neck. Poor thing came back early on, looking like he had just been mugged. Actually, after getting the traumatized thing to talk, he HAD been mugged. It seems some dwarves had thought he was carrying drinks in that cask and were determined to relieve him of it. Well, given the set of individuals who came in the next moring, it they couldn't tell the difference between suncreen and a pina colada . I got further vengence when instead of a potion stability for their, umm, gastric condition, I gave them- purely by accident of course- a rather large sample of the bladderwrack distillation I had been working on. I'm told that several birds, unfortunately died of something near the bathrooms after that.<br />
<br />
Not that this gig has been all work. There have been side benefits for doing this. And after all this time, I thought those Stamina buffs only help for Cannibalizing. In addition, i've been working on some new drink recipes. Not all are successes, of course, but I've never lacked for volunteers for trying them out.<br />
Some of the more popular recipies are:<br />
Flash of Light: My first attempt. Pretty succesful to, though people hated having blinded dwarves and halflings running around fondling some of the female clerics.<br />
Talisman of the Beast: Actually, my most popular, at least with the males. The females, however, don't seem to like it as much.<br />
Shrink: Uhh, that one the ladies did seem to like, espeically on the dwarves.<br />
Canniblize: Well, from my understanding, several ladies have lost weight as a result of that one. But the cooks complain about having to make extra food for the halflings.<br />
Alluring Aura: That's been popular for both genders, but it never seems to make a difference to the half elves.<br />
Winter's Roar: Also, allows me to actually make use again of my cold based spells, providing ice for it.<br />
But the absolute favorite of the men has been the Feral Avatar. Dear gods, but i'm regretting coming up with that one. And of course by the time that they come off of it, the poor girl has collapsed.<br />
<br />
Well, time to go. I promise electrae I'd make a couple of potions of growth, just in case she really wants her hair back. Hated to do that to her, but even the mighty need to be put in their place sometimes.</div></div><hr />

<br />
&quot;Of course I see that blasted parrot, what have you been feeding him?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Did you say mangoes....... Is his name Bill by any chance? There's a gnome on the beach looking for him. Seems he's only got a few more hours before he malfunctions and explodes. I swear them gnomes like being deaf and singed.&quot;<br />
<br />
Gniss stops to think for a minute, and suddenly hands electrae the tray, drops to his knees, and buries his hands in the dirt, chanting. after a couple minutes, he stands back up.<br />
<br />
&quot;Nah, the volcano's asleep still. I think that gnome ship that crashed was using sulfer to cover the smell of the ogre... and the steam seems to be coming from the beach over yonder... the gnome might have caused the hotsprings to open up and start flowing again. Besides, everyone knows Volcanos don't like Virgins, they're not seasoned right. Now, a good ton of chili pepper, 100 gallons of hot sauce, and an elephant, that's good volcano chow.&quot;<br />
<br />
Leaving behind a very confused looking electrae, Gniss slipps away, and continues to the beach on the far side of tha island.</div></div><hr />

<br />
So far there has been no success in raising enough funds to get out of the buffing slavery.  Instead, we have invested in holding all of our visitors hostage and sending them to Lower Guk, to be chased around after we have put clerics in Froglok form. :D :D :D :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">electrae</div><div class="date">10-14-2002, 07:19 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The cleric's AFK was causing some real problems in Godville.  Marr, Innorruk, Brell, Bertox, and a few other less known gods, were clearly supporting the AFK'ing clerics.   Let them have free will.  They deserve a vacation!   They made funny faces at Tunare and Karana and rude gestures at the Rallos and Quellious.<br />
<br />
Tunare and Karana were feeling hounded from all sides.  They didn't like seeing their happy-go-lucky druid children being enslaved, yet they sympathized with their clerics.   But the pressure was REALLY on them from the non-cleric gods to get business back on track.<br />
<br />
&quot;Shape up those druids or get yer precious little clerics back here!&quot;, Rallos snapped at them. <br />
<br />
At a few meetings it had come to fisticuffs and food fights.  The gods never liked one another before, but now they were downright petulent with one another.  If things continued on this downward slide perhaps the Planes of Power would falter and become a new expansion.<br />
<br />
Tunare took to sending portents and visions to her clerics to gently seed thoughts of returning, while Karana decided to park a large storm over AFK Island.<br />
<br />
The few Kerrans on the island were really getting bedraggled and looking extremely unhappy.  Some were hissing under their breath at the clerics. <br />
<br />
Electrae's parrot, which a thorough inspection revealed was not mechanical at all, simply very fond of Mangos, was doomsaying and extremly gloomy.  And Electrae wasn't fairing much better.  The visions and dreams were making her edgy.<br />
<br />
&quot;Bill, last night I dreamed of battlefields and battlefields of dying and wounded people.  Whole villages struck down by terrible monsters.  I woke up with a horrible sense of guilt that I could have prevented it.   Should I go back?&quot;<br />
<br />
Bill cocking an eye outside looking at the endless rain and storm clouds was beginning to think maybe it wouldn't be such a bad idea after all.  Get these clerics off the island and the sun could come back and he could take up with that bird from OOT.   Yet she did seem to have a large supply of mango and intoxicating beverages always around.  When did being an bird get so difficult?<br />
<br />
Suddenly the wind whipped up and the thatch roof blew off her hut.  An odd swirling maelstrom had spread over the island.  Strange lights, weird noises and the screams of panicking clerics all trying to become divine was in the air.  But some magic force prevented their spells from functioning.  Electrae lost consciousness after a chair flew up and hit her on the head from the tremendous wind.  <br />
<br />
When she awoke she was found herself lying in a field.  Next to her was another cleric, in tattered Island clothing, missing sandals and sunglasses.  And next to that cleric was another... and another.  As far as her eyes could see she saw a row of cleric stretching off into the horizon.  <br />
<br />
She rubbed the water and debris off her face and tried to stand but tripped over something.  The tell-tale clinking of metal sent a cold chill down her spine and the cold metal shackle around her ankle rubbed painfully.<br />
<br />
&quot;Tunare!&quot;, Electrae raised her fist into the air and shook it at her goddess defiantly, &quot;How can you allow your devoted servants to be enslaved in this manner!&quot;  <br />
<br />
Tunare didn't answer, but a wood elf slapping his hand menacingly with a horse whip did.<br />
<br />
&quot;Miss Cleric, you and your friends are prisoners of the Druid's Front of Norrath.  We are the druid freedom fighters who will free our brothers and sisters from the cheal chain gang.&quot;<br />
<br />
He paused to let it sink in.  <br />
<br />
&quot;And you, Miss Cleric, and your bunch of drunken, hedonistic friends, are going to buy our freedom back from the Guilds so that we can resume our happy-go-lucky, nukey there, healy here, raiding ways&quot;.<br />
<br />
Later that day the guilds began arriving and negotiating for clerics.  Rumours about dark elves having bigger mana pools meant they went for a premium and were sold out right away to the most prestigious guilds.  Halflings and gnomes were popular for their portability.  Electrae was sold for slightly more than a brown rope horse to a small guild.  Everyone thought her lack of hair indicated a mental disturbance or illness.  They made her change out of her sarong and Etheral Mist tank suit for more traditional garb.   <br />
<br />
Electrae missed the AFK Islands.  She missed her crazy, talking parrot, she missed her inebriated dwarf friends and the large vats of avocado dip. Perhaps one day she could return.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">yshva</div><div class="date">10-15-2002, 03:51 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I never before thought of guacamole as a disguise, but when the tempest hit and beach furniture started flying through the air, the vat of guacamole seemed like the safest place to hide.<br />
<br />
Just then, the sky rained magic, and a several druids ported in, grabbed the remaining trolls on the island, and started herding clerics to the center, where they were chained together.  Most everyone ignored me, but a few trolls that walked by gave me winks... Ewww!<br />
<br />
But wait... maybe they think I'm a troll... if I could pretend to be an enchantress, maybe I could get away with pretending to be a troll...<br />
<br />
Trying to fit in, I wandered around the beach, looking for someone to help me out - we had to stop this from happening!  I cast a quick Yaulp and grabbed a dwarf whose head was stuck in the sand, yanked him out by his feet, and tossed him into the vat of guacamole.<br />
<br />
I was afraid that someone might've noticed the dwarf toss, but it appears that a new group appeared... all in bathrobes.<br />
<br />
There seemed to be flashes of magic - some fire and lightning and a couple ice comets came hurtling out of the sky.  The druids and trolls quickly ported out.<br />
<br />
The robed people methodically went about gathering the rest of the clerics.. apparently the gatherers were all monks, since they anyone awake they came upon, they knocked them all unconscious with their martial arts.  The wizards each carried a chain tied to a magician who was continuously summoning mod rods to keep the wizards happy,  The mages looked just as unhappy as usual.<br />
<br />
The dwarf I &quot;rescued&quot;, woke up and started clammering about what was going on.  I went down to the pot to go shush him, but apparently the ruckus was enough to get the attention of a few on the top of the hill.  One of the dark elf wizards materialized before me with a human monk and a gnome magician.  The dwarf climbed out of the vat and ran screaming at the wizzy with his summoned hammer held high in the air.<br />
<br />
The wizard reached out and grabbed all the mana around him; with a soft sucking sound, he channeled all the mana through himself and sent a violent wave of fire at the advancing dwarf obliterating everything but the summoned hammer and the hand holding it.<br />
<br />
I stood there in sheer horror.<br />
<br />
To be reduced to dust in less time than it took the poor dwarf to run 10 feet in the sand is simply not right...<br />
<br />
I glared at the wizard who was kicking the mage for more mod rods.  I glanced over at the monk who was slowly advancing, trying to tell me to just come quietly and rejoin the CHeal Chain Gang.  Quietly?!?! Like Hell!<br />
<br />
I cast my stun on the monk and quickly rooted him to the sand.  The Wizard was very low on life, and the look of fury at the gnome turned to terror when he saw me walking up to him.  My hammer held High, and surrounded by Tunare's Divine Aura, I grabbed my Warden Symbol of Tunare, and demanded her presence on that island.  <br />
<br />
It was then I noticed that she was already here, lounging under a palm tree drinking some libation from a coconut with a paper umbrella.<br />
<br />
&quot;Tunare,&quot; I begged, &quot;I demand vengeance against this poor dwarf who was only trying to defend his way of life against the intrusions of these abductors.<br />
<br />
&quot;I know that your world is about balance, with life comes death, and with love comes hatred.  As such, I accept that many things in life have a role in the greater scheme of things - such is the way of nature.<br />
<br />
&quot;However, in this, I cry foul.&quot;  I look over to the trio frozen in place.  that's when I also look around to see the wind has stopped blowing, and even the waves are frozen in their whitecaps.  I regain my composure and continue.  <br />
<br />
&quot;The monk here is not able to avoid almost any non-magical blow, but the blows that do hit him simply glance off as if he were wearing several inches of steel.<br />
<br />
&quot;The wizard who with but a glance uses all his mana to obliterate any foe in his path; he has become little more than a sniper and common thug.<br />
<br />
&quot;And finally, the poor mage who is enslaved to the wizards by constantly summoning mod rods so that others may get the glory that he himself deserves.<br />
<br />
&quot;I cry foul, Tunare... I demand a NERF!&quot;<br />
<br />
Tunare puts her drink down and gets up from her chaise.  She walks over to me and says, &quot;That is a very powerful argument, but such would require a sacrifice on your part to keep the balance.&quot;<br />
<br />
I glance around almost in panic, when in a bright flash of light, it comes to me... &quot;Tunare, I know it wasn't right that clerics should get their single class defining spell at such an early age, but since that was the only thing we could do, it only seemed fair at the time.<br />
<br />
&quot;Now that we have been blessed with this wonderful hammer, and you have bestowed upon us the knowledge to use our shields, it would only seem fair if you brought our heals back in line with where they should be.<br />
<br />
&quot;Especially since this whole escapade began with our Complete Heal, so should it end as such.  In addition to the previous nerfs, I demand that you also nerf my Complete Heal.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;A very wise choice, my faithful one, and so shall it be...&quot;<br />
<br />
Tunare fades from view and time returns to normal.<br />
<br />
&lt;TO BE CONTINUED&gt;<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Adarra</div><div class="date">10-15-2002, 09:07 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Adarra had just arrived at the island when all...heck...broke loose, and druids and wizards swooped in to grab all the clerics and drag them back home.<br />
<br />
&quot;Drat!  This isn't fair! I haven't even had one drink yet!&quot;  she muttered to herself.  As she looked around for a place to hide, she walked straight into the arms of a cackling druid, who brandished a set of chains at her.<br />
<br />
&quot;Leave that one be, she's too young for raiding - she hasn't even reached her 39th level yet,&quot; declared a high-elf wizardess.  With a quick wink to the dwarven cleric, she shouted to the now wolf-formed druid &quot;Look!  A level 56 cleric hiding in a tree! FETCH!&quot;<br />
<br />
The druid Yipped! a puppy bark and ran off after other prey.<br />
<br />
The wizard turned to Adarra.  &quot;Now then, young one, I regret having to participate in this madness today, but I was given no choice.  I'm doing what I can though, as unlike most of my brethren, Sol Ro didn't appeal to me and Mother Tunare has charged me with saving as many as I can.  So let me Invis you and you go hide under that pile of dishes.  This will soon be over.&quot;<br />
<br />
Adarra did as she was told - all those semi-insane druids running about were definitely to be avoided.  It was a bit crowded in the hut though, what with the skeleton taunting dishes, the monk with the aching hands, and the others.<br />
<br />
When the hubub died down, Adarra crawled out to a mostly deserted island.  She stood there stunned for a moment.  Then she saw the bar, with all sorts of drinks and yummy snacks just sitting there.  Shrugging to herself, she grabbed a towel, a fruity drink concoction, and some chips and dip, and settled down in the sun.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gniss Fleshmender</div><div class="date">10-16-2002, 12:28 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">After the hubbub had died down, Two human figures with identical features were spotted walking along the beach, followed by what looked like a small hill of sand.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wonder what that was, Cass?&quot; One said to the other.<br />
<br />
&quot;Not sure Ly, A raid maybe?&quot; Cassandara responded, as she hiked her robe up a bit higher. She glanced at her twin again, and asked, &quot;Aren't you hot in that armor?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Nah, couldn't be a raid, all the clerics are hiding in the Ocean of Tears, and the druids aren't helping much.&quot; Lyrana replied, then added, &quot;A bit, but I'm not about to take it off and risk us getting jumped again, that pirate captain was a little to..... forward when he was trying to tie us up.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Why are we here again?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I heard there were some special type of strings I could buy for my mandolin, that won't break.... Might be a rumor, but I go through so many strings, it's insane.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hmmm.... in that case, we might want to check the purse.&quot;<br />
<br />
With that said, Cassandara stopped and turned towards the pile of sand, which pushed a box out from inside it, a box filled with a mix of coins. &quot;Hmmm, we don't have much. Depending on what they cost, we might have to live off bread and water for a bit, plus what you can forage up.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Good afternoon ta ya, Ladies!&quot; spoke a harsh voice from behind them. Both whirled around, to see a dwarf in speedos, with a deep tan, step out from behind a tree, holding a tray with some drinks on it. He glances towards the area that the two had been wondering about, spits in the sand, and says, &quot;Looks like the others are gone, but they'll be back soon. To many of us bound here. A few raids to keep us from being bored, a couple of days to recover and relax...... As long as someone minds the place, Club Med's gonna still be here, and those raiders will be a tad bit more appreciative; What brings you here?&quot;<br />
<br />
Confused, the twins spoke simultaniously. &quot;Club Med?&quot; &quot;Raiders?&quot;<br />
<br />
Glancing between the two, and keeping a wary eye on the pile of sand, Gniss replied. &quot;Club Med. I thought everyone knew where we clerics were vacationing, it sure seems like it. And the raiders that were sick of not having enough healers around, that's who was here a minute ago. Iffn you weren't here to get a cleric, what brings you here?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Lute strings.&quot; Again, both had spoken up. &quot;Some that won't break, like mine always seem to.&quot; Lyrana clarified.<br />
<br />
&quot;Come with me. My name's Gniss, by the way.&quot; Gniss leads the two towards the bar, as he starts to think out loud. &quot;Hmm, Lute strings that don't break, where have I.... Here, have a drink...... Hmmm, maybe..... Try this one, island specialty, called an invisible.... perhaps if I had the right metal..... Careful with that one, It'll explode if you drop it... Maybe some of Brodder's liquid as a temper....&quot;<br />
<br />
Reaching the bar, Gniss installs the two on stools, hoping that neither will notice that their cloths aren't exactly covering anything as he thinks about the lute strings they mentioned. &quot;Hmmmmm. I don't think there's anyone selling anything like you want here, but if you give me a few days, I might manage to make a set, not much to do here untill some of the others return. Let me go check my supplies, A good set of metal strings, enchanted and tempered just right, might do the job just fine. Feel free to make full use of the bar, I'll snag someone to get you something from the kitchen, if Cali's still in her cabin. She locked the door behind the monk....&quot;<br />
<br />
Gniss slips down the bar and away, stopping just long enough to ask Adarra if she wants anything from the kitchen, as he's headed that way. <br />
<br />
&quot;Must be another new arrival, she's a bit pale, and she willingly grabbed an invisible from the bar. Bit young looking, not very high ranking in the church probably, but that changes fast.&quot; Gniss thought as he walked off.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Back at the bar, Lyrana and Cassandara were quickly starting to get drunk, Being so confused, they figured that it was probably their best course of action, while the pile of sand settled down and started amusing itself by rolling a coconut around in a depression it had formed in itself.</div></div><hr />

<br />
&quot;Ok who the F Buried me while I was taking a Nap?&quot;, I exclaimed as I was looking around the Beach.<br />
<br />
All that I saw was a huge mess. From the looks of it a large Hurricane or something came through. The odd part was that there was nobody around.<br />
<br />
So I started to head back to the Bar to see if anybody knew what had happened.<br />
<br />
As I was walking I spotted Gniss and a couple others standing at the bar. Before I could get there Gniss had taken off bumping into what looked like a new resident of the Island.<br />
<br />
After some polite conversation at the bar with the two ladies, who turned out to know nothing, I turned to the little lass who was dinking happily from her glass of what I assumed to be some of the &quot;Invisablilty&quot; Drink.<br />
<br />
&quot;So do you know what went on around here?&quot; I asked while fixing myself a drink of out the random liquors that were on hand.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well Kinda. Some Druids and Wizards all came and grabbed up the Clerics but they said I was to young to join them. They left me here while they chained up the others and ported off.&quot; the young Adarra siad.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hmm sounds like our little vaction spot has been found. Well they will be back and in good time. Thank you for the information.&quot;<br />
<br />
I left the little Dwarf munching on some leftover Mangos that strangly were unharmed in all the mess.<br />
<br />
I went to find some others and start the reconstruction of some of the fallen buildings and to pick up all the debris that those frisy Druids and Wizards had left behind.<br />
<br />
When the Clerics were finished with the raids they would be back and I was going to see that AFK Island looked better then it had ever been when they did.</div></div><hr />

&quot;TRAIN TO THE RIGHT !!!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What the f...&quot;<br />
<br />
She jumps to her feet automatically, realising she's not got the  usual memmed spells available. As her eyes focus she sees three drolvarg sentrys and a spectral caller running around a corner. She backs up and feels her armour pushing against the wall.<br />
<br />
&quot;What the hell is going on ?!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Just another Karnors train, you new here ?&quot; says the armoured barbarian.<br />

She sits down confused. She wasn't wearing armour the last she could remember. A quick check reveals her normal adventuring outfit but no spells memmed. That is soon fixed after a short period of meditation.<br />

<br />
Well, I was the first cleric to depart the AFK retreat, and I'm not liking what I'm seeing out here. While our backs were turned, two of our most important spells, CH and BAtoR, got nerfed. I wonder if the folks back on the island have heard about it yet, assuming that they aren't fighting like mad for their freedom.<br />
<br />
Speaking of the folks on the island, I'm starting to get tired of running all over the world knocking the irons off the clerics that the druids and wizards keep kidnapping. I wonder if it's ever occurred to the teleporters that I have always been content to travel the world under my own power, and I really have no need for them. They're just a convenience, like my resses. If more clerics had that attitude, the druids and wizards might not be so cocky about their cleric-nappings.<br />
<br />
While I was reading the Swamp News, some uppity druid tried to grab me and haul me off to a raid. So I rolled up the paper, smacked his wolfy form across the nose, and reminded him that clerics can root too. We can also chain damage-stuns until your eyes fall out. We also can bash and have big ugly hammers that proc DD like mad. I wonder if he's gotten back to his corpse yet.<br />
<br />
Back to the Swamp News, this is probably my favorite paper outside my hometown of Kaladim. The very idea of an ogre writing something is funny enough to justify the read. Poor Klob Pulp doesn't understand why his local sales are so low. I wonder if it's ever occurred to him that there are fewer ogres and trolls who can read, than there are paladins who don't whine.<br />
<br />
Oh well, I'm off, I've work to do. It seems that monks are dropping like flies now. I'll never have enough mana to res them all, so I've got to get my epic. I wonder if Gimblox is expecting visitors today...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Cali</div><div class="date">10-16-2002, 09:53 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I giggled quietly to myself, feeling very smart to have outwitted the girls. Never send 20something wizards or shaman to convince a cleric to leave her vacationing! I rummaged around my bank vault in Felwithe for a few minutes, quite sure of my safety. After finding what I wanted I strolled over to the Shop of All Holds and baked up some chocolate chip cookies.  Thankfully that monk was not here to pester me for sweets as he had been doing on the island.<br />
<br />
While mixing the dough I contemplated my escape. The gnome and barbarian had slept in my hut just a few nights before, assured that they could lure me back into the wilds and dungeons where my help was desperatly needed. In the morning they had to let me out to cook up a giant tenticle or two before they began to rot on the beach. Not sure who dumped it by my oven but I did the best with what I had. Breakfast was certainly interesting of fried tenticles steaks, sucker pie and soft boiled tenticle and toast. <br />
<br />
That skeleton Goner had been doing dishes quite well for me, but due to the nature of the meal I had just prepared I asked the girls to give him a hand. Once they got involved in scraping plates, I told them I would go pack. I took my prized fry pan, casserole dish and pie tin with me back to my hut. Looking over my shoulder I tossed everything into my backpack and quickly slipped on an old tan colored robe I had been using as padding surrounding my most prized possesions. My epic gleamed brightly in the dimmly lit hut. Stroking the handle I knew I had to return soon to the battle fields, but not today. Beside my sprinkler was a small idol with inscriptions on the base. I pulled it from the bag and took care in putting everything else back in. <br />
<br />
I had to leave several things unfortunately. My gem encrusted sunglasses fit into a side pocket but my new flip flops and collection of paper umbrellas had to stay. I slung the pack onto my back, adjusted my long fiery ponytail perched high on my head then grabbed the idol in my right hand. Chanting softly but quickly I began to invoke the strong power of the small stone statue. With a rush of wind and crackle of energy I faded from view. That is how I made it home, without my unlikely captors trailing me.   Though I do hope they made it off the island before the storm hit it.  News of the unseasonable weather has been all over Kelethin for some reason.<br />
<br />
Perhaps I should not have made these cookies in this particular location. Soon a familiar shadow cast me into darkness. Sighing I looked upwards into the face of my GuildLeader. Grinning, I offered him a fresh and pipping hot cookie. Chuckling at me he took it and sat down with me at the oven. I knew my time was up but I do know how to give in gracefully. <br />
<br />
&quot;I think its time to get back to the grind, Cali&quot; he said. <br />
<br />
&quot;Ok Res, thank you for letting me take a break. I really needed it.&quot; I said. &quot;You should have come with though. It was great fun and I got my baking skill up several points too!&quot; <br />
<br />
Laughing he stood up and pulled me to my feet. Reaching into my pack, he took the epic from its resting place and exchanged it with the faithstone. &quot;C'mon, we got a wizard waiting for us outside. Keeper is up and we need to get there quick. Still remember how to complete heal a tank?&quot; Resurrector asked with a grin. <br />
<br />
Laughing I nodded but then rummaged through my pack. &quot;You run on ahead, I need to get my notebook from the bank.&quot; I said as we walked into the sunlight. Nodding his consent, we both took off in oposite directions. <br />
<br />
Once in the bank, I acquired my notebook of Complete Heal times from the bankers safekeeping. Before stepping from the door though, I stopped at the message board. Quickly I put a note up as I glanced repeatedly over my shoulder. <br />
<br />
Smiling I walked from the bank, knowing that this was just a short break in my vacation and there would be many times that I could get away from the chain. The newly left message fluttered in the breeze as the door closed softly behind me. <br />

RE: Cabin for Sale <br />
<br />
Dear Tailor, <br />
From your message you noted the cabin is next too a stream deep in the mountains, with a high population of wildlife and low population of visitors. This sounds like the perfect thing for me. I have left money with your agent and hope to hear from you soon on when I can get the keys. I am buying this as a retreat to work upon my skills and I hope you shall honor my request for a quiet and discrete transaction. <br />
<br />
My thanks, <br />

A glance to his left shows him Brell and Bristlebane casually reclining in their overstuffed iksar leather barcoloungers and a pile of phat lewtz at their feet...occassionally they pick one up and toss it towards the ocean and chuckle as the Gnoll Priests of Brell Give chase with Mighty YIPS...*<br />
<br />
 YIPS? Brell can you explain this spell to me?<br />
<br />
*Brell sighs*<br />
<br />
 The powers of the nameless have decreed that yaulp is no longer to be fully benificial for our clerics as a near instant power increase and mana fix as yall weren't really using them in battle after all...well Bristlebane here won tha naming rights when he won the bet...and he looked at the pups and said &quot;YIP it shall be....&quot; But we think we managed to save the highest Yaulp as we decided upon it last month...was it last month? Bah matters not, but these pina Colada's are starting to get a might low in the pineapple if you know what I mean...would ye be a kind dwarf...ahh thank ye...be off and return soon...<br />
<br />
*As Brodder wandered back into his hut to dig up some more Thurgadin Rum and coconut and pineapple juices and to chip off more ice from the Timorous Deep Chunk of Iceberg that was keeping the temperature inside the hut bareable(sp) and chilling the food stuffs and liquor's he'd hoarded over the years, he stopped for a moment to consider the layouts of the piles of ashes and the sources of all that armor n weapons the two gods were casually tossing about...could they....*<br />
<br />
 Hmmmm<br />
<br />
 Oh Brell did you and umm Bristlebane make a bet on how many idjuts would mistake you two for clerics and try to Chain you into a CH Gang?<br />
<br />
*From outside came the chuckling replies*<br />
<br />
 Well I did bet just that, but they only came for me...Bristle here bet that they'd call an impromptu Raid when they Saw the Crystal Vision Device the Gnome Tinkers made and kill themselves...<br />
<br />
 &quot;Kill themselves?&quot; I asked as I came out with another tray of Pina Coladas with fancy mithril and silk umbrellas they seemed to liek so much...&quot;That thing was harmless, was one of my design specifications since you two might show up and I'd be seated real close to it...&quot;<br />
<br />
 &quot;Ahh but me ladd, ye remember Karana Zapping that Feisty Druid who curse us all with in Earshot? Well what works one way works another with a little Halfing rewiring...&quot;<br />
<br />
*Brell Continued as the Hafling God sipped heavily on his Cool Island Cocktail...&quot;<br />
<br />
 &quot;And I'm sure the sign that said 'New portal to Phat Lewtz and Dragons to Kill&quot; stuck int he sand right in front of it didn't hurt...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Maybe Alerting all of the TOV dragons didn't hurt either..for us...&quot;<br />
<br />
 &quot;Fiery Reception I must say...&quot;<br />
<br />
 &quot;Wonder if Givign the Dragons Manaburn was a wee bit too much too?&quot; CHuckled Bristlebane...<br />
<br />
 Brell Smiled as he reached for the Profered concoctions, &quot;NAh the NAmeless will nerf that maybe...maybe not...but they did make me spill my Drink...rude warriors...Glad we never invited Rallos here, he'd have ruined a perfect vacation spot you know...tournaments, blathering on about such and such weapon...&quot;* Brell tosses a glitering dagger into the ocean where it cleaves a wave in two easily..&quot; Like maybe this one Wavecutter or sumtin...wait wavecutter&gt;? Bristlebane did you mess with their gear too?&quot;<br />
<br />
 &quot;ME Never? You didn't see me spilling my drink did you? An you call youself a dwarf...like that time in Neriak when...&quot;<br />
<br />
*BRodder enters into his hut for safety and so he won't be opined upon to judge an arguement between two gods...This vacation was nice, but the staff would need to be resummoned and paid again...so he begand digging into his bags for the old old artifacts he saved for just this occassion...checking them closely for alterations since a Certain Halfing God had been staying in this hut for the last Half month or so....*<br />
<br />
 &quot;Gah I wish I had been awake and sober to watch their faces when that line up of dragons came on screen...dead in their tracks it stopped them hahahaa....and on an isle full of clerics they still died hahahah...Hmm WOnder if the Memory Crystals on tha Vision devices still work...maybe I can replay it from the dragon's PErspective ...then again...where are teh coordinates for the Tree City's Woman's Shower and bath house? That's the way to spend the day...&quot;<br />
<br />
*reaching for his Reception and listings book -which curiously looks like a wizard's adn Druid's Safe Porting Coordinates manual- his other hand reaches deep intot he meltign icewater pool around his miniiceberg in the corner of the hut and emerges with a half case of Doublebrewed  Double stout Dwarven ale. Rising he turns to the hut's door again*<br />
<br />
 &quot;HEy Brell , Bristlebane Sirs...I've an idea for some afternoon viewing and fun....you siad it's set for two way right? Do you think this line might work?....<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Wynterfyre</div><div class="date">10-17-2002, 07:48 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Wynterfyre woke up to a whining in his ears, which was countering the crashing of the waves somewhere behind him. One silver eye peered out to see his Spirit Companion looking at him with concern. Wynterfyre found it more disconcerting, given that he could see the ocean right through the wolf's body.<br />
Spitting sand from his mouth, he sat up painfully. He was bruised and sore, though that could easily be removed quickly enough. What he couldn't remove was the image of devesation that had hit the island.<br />
Actually, it was not as much devestation as depopulation. The island was seemingly deserted. All the clerics seemed to be gone.<br />
<br />
He tried to remember what had happened. He had been working on another batch of the suntanning lotion. He was striving to get a batch strong enough that it might work for the Dark Elves. Although their clerics represented a god of pure evil, looking at their ladies in their littler blood red swimsuits was worth a little corruption here and there. He had believe he had finally got the right mixture when quite literally the roof fell in on him. He never saw who or what came down, but apparently a wooden beam from the roof had struck the back of his skull. Then it was lights out. The fact that he had not been killed was why the spirit wolf was still around.<br />
The wolf sat down, looking relieved at the shaman's recovery. At least, Wynterfyre thought he looked relieved. For all he knew, the wolf was just waiting for walkies (and he had always wondered why a spirit wolf, that didn't eat, needed walkies; what confused him more was the fact that the wolf did relieve himself...at least, he must have. Thankfully, being a spirit, Wynterfyre never had to actually clean up after him).<br />
The shaman looked at the damage. His blood began to boil (which given that he came Halas and its permanent snowy wastes meant that he actually started to steam slightly, given his low body temperature). His still and all his alchemical supplies were completely detroyed. No more experimental drinks. No way to make the salve he got to rub on the ladies backs. And more importantly, no way to get a sunscreen for the Dark Elf ladies.<br />
<br />
&quot;All right, it's pay back time.&quot;</div></div><hr />

<br />
I've heard rumors of a cleric vacation spot but for the life of me I can't seem to find out where the darn thing is.  Some say its in OoT, others in Tim Deep and still others in Erud's Crossing.  The only thing everyone I've talked to agrees on is that its on a sunny beach, somewhere.  Well, nothing for it but to start looking, with any luck Tunare will help me out.<br />
<br />
Day 4 - <br />
<br />
I arrived in OoT, seemed like a logical choice.  Been searching all over but no Club Med (that's what people seem to be calling it).  Anyway, I decided to take a break and sun tan on the beach for a few hours before starting the search again, after all, it is my vacation.  Only got to lie there for about 20 min before two seafuries and a specter came over complaining about the glare so I put on my armor and gated off.<br />
<br />
Day 7 -<br />
<br />
Decided to go out on a limb and look at Twilight Sea.  Ran back and forth with no luck, then I remembered the underwater tunnel to a secret area.  Seemed like a good place so I checked it out, yet again, no luck.  However, swimming back out of the tunnel I was attacked by a large minnow who clamped its mouth on to my ankle.  I quickly got out of the water and spent about 30 min trying to get the little bugger off but he was on there tight.  Since he really couldn't hurt me through the metal of my boot, I figured I'd just leave him there until he got bored and let go.<br />
<br />
Day 11 -<br />
<br />
Made it to Timerous Deep and this #@$!% minnow still won't let go.  Took me several days to search this place, but the minnow seems to minnow seems to help me swim faster so thats a small plus.  On the last day I found an old iksar on a hill top and thought I could ask him if he's seen any other clerics around.  Mental note, don't do that again, he's... cranky.  Luckily he's also slow so I was able to get away without too much trouble.<br />
<br />
Day 18 -<br />
<br />
Tried looking in Iceclad, yeah, bit of a stretch but the boat was close.  I tried dangling my foot in the water hoping to lure the minnow back into the water but all I got was a blue foot and a fish with goosepimples (I never knew fish could get goosepimples).  That was ok, I was actually getting used to the little guy and named him Stan.  <br />
No clerics here either, thought I'd pop over into Eastern Wastes (since I was close) when I was attacked by a snow derv.  I easily rooted it and was deciding whether to kill it or just run when I got an idea.  I looked down and Stan, pointed at the derv and said &quot;Stick em boy!  Kill!&quot;.  Stan just looked at me so I decided to run.<br />
<br />
Day 23 -<br />
<br />
Checked out Erud's Crossing, this place is pretty small so I was able to figure out Club Med wasn't here either.  Decided to leave rather quickly, I didn't like the way the kerrans were looking at Stan.<br />
<br />
Day 25 -<br />
<br />
Out of ideas where to look next.  I'll have to think about it and try again.  On another note, I've seen several people, with shackles if all things, try to approach me but they take one look and Stan and start backing away.  I wonder what that's about.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">paddyo</div><div class="date">10-17-2002, 02:11 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Day 1.<br />
<br />
I arrive at the beach 10 days late.  We couldnt place the vacation package flyers on the table in the Rivervale Cleric Guild, because of the number of Human and Wood Elf Druids who would wander in by mistake looking for the new Luclin Port scrolls.  So alot of us didnt find out that the party was a go until after we showed up at the raid and got grouped up with the treehuggers.   After a quick crash course in managing all eight spell slots with buffs and heals, and pointing out how lucky they were because the 2 slots I always had saved for Divine Aura and Divine Barrier were free for them to load useful stuff like Treeform and Starshine, I was ready to head out.  <br />
<br />
Getting a port was madness though.   First of all, the raid leader told the druids they werent going anywhere.  And I, being the only cleric,  was told leaving was forbidden as well.  Thinking quick, I pointed out that since I had gotten my new summoned hammer the rez stick was in the bank, and it would be madness to start the raid without it.  Luckily, this raid leader wasnt familiar with the fact that I have never GOTTEN my rez stick, and gave me a 10 minute leave to go grab it.  After the first druid tried to port me and in the process ripped both his legs from his torso and bled to death when his body ported to misty but his legs stayed chained to the gang, I felt obligated to go back and rez him.  Finally, one of the wizards offered to TL me to Great Divide, so that I could run to the bank and Thurgadin for the rez stick.  <br />
<br />
Once in Great Divide, I of course decided to stop for a brew.  One cannot venture so close to the nightlife of Thurgadin and not partake in its frivolities.  Unfortuanetly, after a few Tumpy Tonics, my replies to the raidleader explaining I would &quot;be right back&quot; became mumbled enough that he sent a posse out to look for me.  I had to hide In a Barbarian Warrior ladyfriends cleavage to avoid detection as I snuck out of thurgadin.<br />
<br />
Anyway, I managed to find an unguilded druid soloing and got a port from them.  But they started asking too many questions.  Why would I be going to Erud's Crossing when my guild was on a raid?  Why didnt I ask one of the druids in my guild for a port?  Why had I chosen to be a halfling cleric?  Fortunately, I remembered that as a part of the conspiracy package I had My Hammer of Judgement and Yaulp V.  I proceeded to beat the pulp out of the druid and leave them dead at the ring in Tox.  Odds of another cleric passing that way and able to rez them before the body rotted was nil, since all the rest of you were already on the beach.  It was indeed the &quot;perfect&quot; crime.<br />
<br />
So a quick run to the boat, and I arrived at the beach.  The Trolls got ugly right away....I tried to convince them I was a cleric but they would have no part of it.   Soon it became a game of trying to trick the halfling.  Luckily, i was able to sneak past them from behind while pointing to the sky and saying &quot;Look, a Snow Griffon!!!&quot;  and made it to the Cabana.<br />
<br />
I saddled up at the bar next to a sweet looking High Elf lady with a very bad sunburn.  A few glasses of elven wine later, I had her talked into going back to my room while I shuffled through my bags for a scroll of &quot;abolish: sunburn&quot; that i had smuggled off of the test server and onto the black market.  Of course, there was no such scroll.  Believe me though, after a few Tumpy Tonics, she quicly forgot all about her sunburn.  Lets just say that between my natural halfling dexterity and agility and the convenient memming of &quot;invigor&quot; She was one happy Preistess in the morning.  Unfortunately, talks of commitment and little half-elves (or halfling-elves as the case would be) chilled me to the bone quicker than the mark of retribution, so while she was taking a shower I quickly cast &quot;atone&quot; on her and then feigned horror as to what on earth she was doing in my room.  This strategy worked so well, I think Ill stay out a bit longer tonight and try and lure a dark elf back to the &quot;Love-nasium&quot;<br />
<br />
Day 2<br />
<br />
Swiftly dodging the Trolls has become a nuisance.  They are certain I must be a druid since I have furry feet.  They even sent a sultry dwarf maiden over to me to ask me for a sow.  Thats ok, I was prepared.  I cast Shield of Words, and beat the rap.  The trolls are leaving me alone for now.<br />
<br />
The Kerrans freak me out.  They wander around here acting like nothings going on, but I dont trust them.  I think something is up.  Maybe its the fact that I am small and fuzzy and worry about them mistaking me for a mouse.<br />
<br />
The rez tells have become too much as well.  I have a feeling that by the time the month is over here, there will be noone left on the server high enough to group with anymore.  Glad we had the foresight to make sure some of us could tank and some of us could heal...<br />
<br />
I tried to register for some of the more exciting conferences, but all the popular ones were booked up.  I got left with &quot;Creative uses for leftover trade skill supplies&quot;  &quot;Halo of light: a dead Erudite Clerics best friend&quot; and &quot;Tunare: Goddess of nature or just a moody bitch?&quot;  Great.  This looks like its gonna be a long week.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Adarra</div><div class="date">10-17-2002, 09:36 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">It had been a restful vacation, but Adarra was feeling restless.  <br />
<br />
Being so young that she had not yet experienced the horror of the Cheal chain, she did not feel a pressing need to hide away from the rest of Norrath for very long, so after a few days she decided to go back.  Besides, she needed more experience, so that she could grow in her abilities.<br />
<br />
As luck would have it, the kind Wizardess who had saved her had come back to the Island to check on her, and offerred to port her wherever she wished.<br />
<br />
&quot;I trust you won't mind if I make a stop in Kael first?  I'll invis you so that you won't be in any danger.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Not at all&quot; Adarra replied.  She was rather excited at the prospect of seeing some Giants.<br />
<br />
&quot;well, put this warm cloak on, and hang on tight then,&quot; and with a sweeping arcane gesture, the wizard opened a portal.<br />
<br />
Invisible, they ran through a forest to the mighty fortress of Kael Drakkal, and Adarra indeed saw her first Giant.  &quot;Wow, and I thought High Elves were tall!&quot;<br />
<br />
The wizard chuckled.  &quot; Come inside with me, quietly now or the Sentinels will hear us - Invisible doesn't mean un-hearable.&quot;<br />
<br />
They entered the fortress and came upon a raid group preparing for an encounter with the Avatar of War.  Adarra stayed silent and invisible.  &quot;Who is that?&quot; she thought.   There, shackled and under guard, was a high-elf cleric maiden.  Strangely, she had no hair.  She seemed weary and somewhat bruised, unusual for a cleric.<br />
<br />
Adarra sidled over and whispered &quot;Psst - hey, what's the matter, why don't you heal yourself?&quot;<br />
<br />
The weary cleric replied &quot;I'm oom.  They've been dragging me here, there and everywhere, battling Dragons at one moment , then Shissar the next.  Now they've brought me here.  If I wasn't so tired I'd be insulted - I outgrew this place a while ago.....I must be tired, I'm talking to thin air.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;no, I'm real, I'm just invisible.  Here, take my hand.&quot; Adarra took the elf's hand in her own and squeezed it.  Still holding the elf's hand, she waved to the wizard, who by now had concluded whatever business she came for, and was ready to port out.<br />
<br />
&quot;So, youngling, I'm ready to port you, have you decided where you would like to go?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes surely, to Greater Faydark, Mistress.  Please come with me so that I may thank you properly.  We will run to my home of Kaladim together.  I am no Grandmaster Baker, but I brew a fine Elven Wine, which I am sure you'd enjoy.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, if you insist, I am feeling a mite thirsty&quot; the wizard said, and smiled.  As she cast the portal spell, Adarra wrapped her arms around the weary cleric, and derived great pleasure from the stunned looks on the faces of the raid force as their prize cleric disappeared.<br />
<br />
Upon landing at the Spires, she apologized to the wizard.  &quot;I'm sorry for deceiving you, but I couldn't leave my fellow cleric in such dire straights.&quot; Adarra wasn't too worried, the other cleric was a High Elf too, after all, but some wizards had fiery tempers...<br />
<br />
She needn't have worried.  The wizard just laughed and said &quot;I'll have to dodge that particular group for a while, but I'm not angry.  You saved me the trouble of doing it myself.  They wouldn't let me near her, you know.&quot;<br />
<br />
Relieved, Adarra turned to the other cleric, and gently lay her hands on her head.  &quot;I'm not a High Priest, but perhaps my modest healing abilities will serve, Venerable One.&quot;  Whispering a prayer to Brell, she released healing energies and watched as the lines of weariness and the bruises faded from the other's face.  <br />
<br />
&quot;Now, let's go to Felwithe, since it's close, and see about getting those chains off.  I'm a dwarf after all, no stranger to smithing.  First round's on me :) &quot;</div></div><hr />

 Thankfully the V like white, tan lines up front have faded, and the message about Dwarven clerics being combustible due to alcohol content faded too.<br />
 But semingly t-shirt portraying Brodder's backside (on back of tshirt no less) with both messages visible have become collector's items.<br />
 The front shows brodder tending bar hung with a sign...<br />
 AFK Island, where your worries fade away...like your clothes...<br />
 And a blushing elf with missing bikini attempting to cover her bountiful treasures...<br />
<br />

Now she has let it regrow, but it's short and spikey looking.  <br />
<br />
She spends her days resting in the Retired Clerics Home, sipping Geritol spiked tea, still bitter over the experience.  When she was able to buy her freedom she slipped into the obscurity of being a botted cleric and is taking a long sabbatical from raids and guilds and such. <br />
<br />
Although, she has heard rumours of new adventures that suit her far better than being enslaved in a raiding guild... she remembers her adventures with her friends in dark, dank places like Sebilis, Howling Stones and Chardok and dreams of finding adventures like those again.   Until then, she must content herself with yelling at elven children that run across her lawn.</div></div><hr />
