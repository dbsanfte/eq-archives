<TEXTAREA NAME="EditedMessage" ROWS=10 COLS=45 WRAP="VIRTUAL">Two nights ago, three guilds on the Rathe server (Mirth and Mayhem, Tempters of Fate and Opaline Eternity) staged their first allied raid. The target was Kedge Keep, right after the daily patch.

Things got off to a chaotic start as people did or didn't show up and groups got improvised from what we had...1 SK, 1 warrior, 2 monks, 4 magicians, 1 wizard, 2 necros, 2 druids, and 1 cleric (me). The highest level present was 54, lowest was 34, most people were in the 40s. For most it was their first time in Kedge Keep, for many it was their first raid. I was the only one with a FB earring...everyone else was using EB from the druids or from mage-summoned waterstones.

Things got even more chaotic inside...we had a few deaths due to drowning (KK newbs not watching their EB) and several more deaths as we ironed out our tactics...I was healer in the lead group, but the other two groups were being healed by the druids, and you could definitely tell they weren't used to grouping much.  :rolleyes: We finally got crowd control worked out by using mage earth pets to root, necros with Screaming Terror and feign pulling. We designated one person to cast Cancel Magic to take down the mermaid damage shields, and things started to look up as we moved past the second floor and into the main part of the keep. Our target: every named mob that was up.

Now the story begins.

We moved up into the safe rooms near Estrella's room...she was to be our first target as she was interfering with our pulling (we found that out when she killed our puller). After clearing the general area of mermaids, sharks and other annoyances, we went to pull the mermaids out of the area near Estrella. The puller called INCOMING and I hit him with a Superior Heal as he scooted back into the room with what appeared to be two mermaids on his tail.

Then the lights went out. One of the "mermaids" was actually Estrella herself, and she had just AE blinded everyone.  :eek:

I don't know what anyone else would have done in this situation, but I used my hotkeys. I knew I still had the puller targeted and he was still getting hit, so I hotkeyed another Superior Heal on him, then started moving through the group using the F keys and Greater Heal trying to hit everyone that I could as fast as I could.

Then the lights come back on, and the first thing I see is Estrella in front of me, a BIG nuke and LOADING, PLEASE WAIT...

I also, praise be to Brell, saw 5 full or near-full health bars on my group.  :)

When I landed out in Dagnor's Cauldron, it was to see a chaotic scroll of combat messages including the words "CLERIC DOWN" and a few seconds later "WE WON!"  :D

The wizard came out and escorted me back down to the group, where I got the dubious privilege of ressing myself for the first time, amid a sea of praise...as it turned out, I WAS THE ONLY CASUALTY!?  :confused: 

What happened was, my healing the puller had aggroed Estrella on me right before she blinded everyone. All the healing I did while blind was channeled right through the beating that Estrella was giving me. And while Estrella was focussing on me and I was healing the group, the group was able to recover from the initial onslaught and give Estrella the beatdown. Even in dying, I was hailed as a hero.  :D

She dropped two Lamentation Blades, in case you're wondering. Our tanks were quite happy.

Once everything after Estrella got settled, we started pulling again, working our way to Undertow and the Frenzied. I had high hopes, as I had dibs on the Abalone Gorget if it dropped. 

Then the server crashed.  :(
