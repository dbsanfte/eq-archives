<TEXTAREA NAME="ReplyMessage" ROWS=10 COLS=45 WRAP="VIRTUAL">[QUOTE]Originally posted by morodullin:
[B]Here's your answers:

First, Verant used a simple number progression on this spell line: each new uprade adds +6 ac and x2 mana cost. Early on, this meant an additional 6 ac for very little mana. Now, from AoF to SoW the mana cost for that 6 ac is silly. But that's how it happened, some game designer thought the mathematics is neat and predictable (and it is) without realizing the separation of the two different curves.

Second, is it worth it. No way. Let's say you used to cast AoF on the tank, the monk, and yourself. Now you think about casting SoW on the same three. That's 2x the mana, or like casting 6 AoF spells. Why didn't you cast 6 of them before? I'll tell you why, it was too much mana to put AoF on mages and necros and what not. It's still too much mana to spend the same mana and only get an extra 6 ac out of it.

Why do most clerics not bother to cast any of these spells on non-tanks? Easy one. Your AC compared to the ATK of the mob determines how often you get hit and for how much. Mob's have an ATK set at a reasonable level to hit tanks with about 1,000 AC (give or take). Adding 26 or 32 AC to these tanks makes a big difference in whether their AC is higher than the mob's ATK or not. Adding 26 or 32 AC to a mage, enchanter, etc., who has a 700 AC will not, NEVER, raise his AC enough to seriously effect the ratio of his AC to the mob's ATK. So don't waste the mana.

But here is what I find:

I can take a pickup group to dangerous camps in Sebilis (kitchen, crypt, etc.). People I don't know, people who aren't a smooth team yet. We can chain pull with ZERO downtime. I maintain Symbol of Marzin on me, the chanter, and all melees. I maintain Heroic Bond on the group and recast it if anyone gets dispelled. And I actually cast Shield of Words on me and all melees. And I keep Armor of Protection on me. I do all this and I'm never at full mana. But I never have to ask them to suspend pulling because despite using all these buffs, I always have enough mana left for heals. I even use Stun and Holy Might to disrupt spellcasting mobs.

Sure, sometimes a fight goes bad and I need to use alot of mana for heals. Sometimes buffs get dispelled and I have to recast them, sometimes often enough that I go oom because of rebuffing. In those cases, we suspend pulls for 20 or 30 seconds. 

How is this possible? Learn to stagger your buffs. Learn to get maximum use out of your meditation time. Learn the advantages of Remedy, Celestial Healing, Word of Vigor, and Complete Healing and know how to use each to it's maximum efficiency. Play the numbers, and you can manage your mana so efficently that you CAN afford to use Shield of Words instead of Armor of Faith.

And here's a final tip:

Let's say that the extra 6 AC from SoW reduces the average damage a tank receives by 3-5 HP (as suggested in an earlier post on this thread); take the average and say it reduces it by 4 HP. Let's also assume that the extra 6 AC causes one miss out of 30 attacks; this is an attack that would have hit but it msises because of the extra 6 AC.

Let's say that the mobs in Sebilis generally hit that tank for around 100 HP and they double attack. (golems and named mobs hit for more than this, weaker froggies hit for less, it averages out).

Let's say that a good group can pull 30 mobs in an hour, that's 1 kill every two minutes. I really think most of my groups pull more than this.

Each mob will hit that tank roughly 10-30 times per fight (based on my observations, depending on how tough the mob is, how many times we hit or miss, how many nukes we land, etc.) I'll take a low average of 15 times.

15 hits over 30 mobs is 450 hits on that tank in one hour.

Because 1 hit out of 30 will miss now, we can save the tank 15 hits, or 1500 HP damage. Also, the remaining 35 hits are reduced by 4 HP each, we save an extra 140 damage. Total damage reduction of the extra 6 AC is 1,640 HP. That's not much in an hour.

However, depending on circumstances, that is at least one CH and maybe in a really bad pull, that might be two or three chain-castings of Remedy to save the tank until the enchanter gets the mobs memorized. Think of how much mana that extra healing will cost over time.

Also, while you are casting the extra healing spells, you are not available to cast stuns when a mob tries to gate. Also, when you are in the middle of casting a CH and mez breaks, you can't heal your chanter until you finish casting.

Now, the number I've given are all understated. I think that extra 6 AC reduces more than 4 HP per attack (on average). I think it saves more than one hit out of every 30 attacks. I think we pull more than 30 mobs an hour. And, SoW lasts longer than one hour, so the benefits are. For all those reasons, I think the advantages are even more than my math was able to demonstrate.

Also, I have noticed my tanks get stunned less often when they get hit less often - less stun means they can kill the mobs faster and take less damage so we can pull more and heal less.

Considering all this, maybe it is worth it to get that extra 6 AC, even if you have to med 20 or 30 extra seconds before pulling, just to cut downt he cost of future healing.

Just some thoughts, your mileage may vary.
