<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">electrae</div><div class="date">07-13-2002, 01:10 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I have a small guild and we're trying to figure out how best to use our resources in battles.  I've written a program to analyze fights.  So far, it looks at the battle round by round and summarizes how much damage someone takes before they get healed. <br />
<br />
It also looks at the battle in N second intervals and tries to figure out how much damage the mob dishes out in those intervals (helping to get cheal timing right).  <br />
<br />
Any suggestions for other ways to look at the data?  It's been a really fun project.  I ran it on a Velks fight we did and you can <br />
really see how Velks doesn't do anything the first minute or so of battle, which suggests that having a defensive warrior early on might not be the best thing if the battle goes on longer than 3 minutes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">JanSorensen</div><div class="date">07-13-2002, 04:42 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Damage per N seconds is really whats its all about as you note.<br />
<br />
You might also want to analyze what the variance in time between heals is given a delay of M seconds. This should be fairly independent of mob fought - yet might not be as mobs where you have to use lots of rods could lead to a little more irregularity.<br />
<br />
The fun then is to look at the data - find an N where the risk of death is acceptable (rarely means 0) - and set M so the risk of getting a delay N or greater is acceptable.<br />
<br />
I am sure you knew all this already - just stating it anyway  http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/smile.gif<br />
<br />
Ohh, and if you want to share your problem I would love to have a copy - nomatter how user unfriendly it might be  http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/smile.gif<br />

<br />
And a stored fight (10 second interval in the 2nd table) http://nmcs.com/cgi-bin/fight.cgi?saved=The_AvatarofWar.session.1 <br />
<br />
The tables are a little ugly and I don't think I've got complete heals in there yet.<br />
<br />
The last table might be interesting.  It breaks down the mobs melee over 1-10 second intervals. <br />
<br />
I need to learn more about table formatting stuff.  <br />
<br />
Basically you provide the tool with the name of the mob, the number of second intervals for the 2nd table and then paste your log into the text area.<br />
<br />
Feed back appreciated!<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">JanSorensen</div><div class="date">07-14-2002, 06:16 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Definitely has potential  http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/smile.gif<br />
<br />
I think you should fill in all the cells in Table 3 though for it to be really usefull. <br />
<br />
Example:<br />
Table1 snip:<br />
1 23:12:34        <br />
2 23:12:35        <br />
3 23:12:38        <br />
4 23:12:39        <br />
5 23:12:40        <br />
6 23:12:41  YOU (778) <br />
7 23:12:42        <br />
8 23:12:43  YOU (1324) <br />
9 23:12:44        <br />
10 23:12:45  YOU (1048)       <br />
11 23:12:46  YOU (366) <br />
12 23:12:47  YOU (259)  <br />
<br />
Table3 snip:<br />
00:11 1048 (1) 1048 (2) 2372 (3) 2372 (4)3150 (6)           <br />
00:12 366 (1)                    <br />
00:13 259 (1) 625 (2) 3775 (7)         <br />
 <br />
For table 3 to be truly usefull it should read:<br />
00:11 1048 1048 2372 2372 3150 3150 3150 3150 3150 3150<br />
00:12 366 1414 1414 2738 2738 3516 3516 3516 3516 3516<br />
00:13 259 625 1673 1637 2997 2997 3775 3775 3775 3775 <br />
<br />
Thats - fill in all cells - rather than just cells seemingly at random.<br />
<br />
Heals I just could not get to work - but I will try a little more before I comment on that in detail.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">electrae</div><div class="date">07-14-2002, 11:02 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The reason I did table 3 with empty cells, some seconds there was no damage done in the battle.  Also, it gives you a kind of feel for the damage distribution.  For instance, this is a battle with Velketor and it really illustrates how he doesn't do much during the first minute or so of battle.  But I'll try it with all the cells filled in and we can compare it.<br />
<br />
But yeah, that table is hard to read.  I was thinking of coloring every other column.<br />
<br />
Hmmm... heals aren't showing up.  Have to fix that.<br />

<br />
I think I fixed the heals.  I was searching for &quot;is completely healed&quot; and forgot about the case where it might be &quot;are completely healed&quot;.<br />
<br />
Third table is a little more readable now with even numbered (seconds) columns in green. <br />
<br />
Also, it makes a URL now that you can use to replay a fight.<br />
<br />
Holy cow, I reran that Avatar of War fight.  There was one second there he did around 6000 damage.  What a meanie.<br />
<br />
I think the 3rd table is really cool.  If you decided you wanted to cheal when the MT has taken around 3000 damage then you can look through the columns to figure out which healing speed that would be.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">JanSorensen</div><div class="date">07-14-2002, 04:01 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Aye<br />
<br />
The 3rd table is the usefull one. If you leave blanks in it or not isnt the important thing though - but you didnt even fill in all the spots where it changed. That was my main gripe - which I admittingly didnt make clear the first time around.<br />
<br />
My former post has a clear example of that.<br />
00:13 259 (1) 625 (2) 3775 (7) <br />
where the numbers at (3) and (5) are mysteriously missing.<br />
<br />
I will test your utility some more and give more comments    http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/smile.gif<br />
<br />
Edit:<br />
Did another run with part of the AoW fight.<br />
 http://nmcs.com/cgi-bin/fight.cgi?saved=The_AvatarofWar.session.2 <br />
<br />
Something went wrong - as tables 2 and 3 didnt get generated. Then I did it again with less data and it worked  http://nmcs.com/cgi-bin/fight.cgi?saved=The_AvatarofWar.session.3 <br />
<br />
So, not quite sure what went wrong. It still suffers from the problem that not all cells in table 3 where a change takes place are filled in.<br />
<br />
Also, when it comes to healing you will be missing heals done from someone out of group unless the tank has all PC heals turns on - as you only search for &quot;have been complately healed&quot;.<br />
<br />
Instead I would search for &quot;You have been healed for xxx points of damage.&quot; as the recipient of the heal gets that message regardless.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">electrae</div><div class="date">07-15-2002, 01:19 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hmmm... maybe the way the third table works isn't clear.<br />
<br />
What it is doing is showing you in 1,2,3-10 second intervals how much damage was done.  It only shows the damage at the end of the interval what the damage total was for that duration.  If there wasn't any damage, or it isn't time to display a total, it leaves the cell blank. <br />
<br />
So the one second column should have something in it always, as long as there was damage done.  I'm not sure I like that though, a really long fight would be a hellaciously long table.<br />
<br />
The other part that is confusing is if the first damage shows up on the 8th round (or 00:07) of the fight (like it did in your 2nd AoW sample) then it'll print out damage totals for the 1, 2, 4 and 8 second.  I think you assumed it prints out new totals with each change.  <br />
<br />
Maybe what I should do is show the averages and mean damage over the entire battle for each interval instead of showing it for each second.  Plus the biggest spike in that interval.  What do you think?   <br />
<br />
The visual thing of damage distribution over time makes me happy, but the hugeness of the table doesn't.  I could try to figure out how to graphic it or plot it, but I'm beyond bad with doing anything terribly complicated like that. <br />
<br />
There's a couple of things you have to have in order to make this work right, one is that you have to be able to see complete heals land on the MT, the other is &quot;others hits on&quot;.  I typically do the logging for my guild and I'm not the MT.   I'm not making the assumption that the MT is the one providing the log. <br />
<br />
I think the next thing I'll put in there is something to show the timing of complete heals.  I suppose I could even figure out who cast the complete heal as long as I see the line &quot;Electrae begins to cast a spell.&quot; 10 seconds earlier.  Ok, well, perhaps in a later revision.<br />
<br />
I think the first table still has promise as a sort of &quot;overall&quot; picture but I need to work on it a lot.<br />
<br />
I'm not sure what happened with that 2nd Avatar fight, I'll take a closer look.<br />
<br />
Thanks for testing this and the feedback.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">JanSorensen</div><div class="date">07-15-2002, 05:59 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ahh, yes, I get it now. Makes perfect sense.<br />
<br />
To get what I want for output I will just input 1 sec resolution then  http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/smile.gif <br />
<br />
I dont mind a huge table for my personal use - I like numbers  http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/smile.gif<br />
<br />
I would probably have used &quot;forward&quot; dmg rather than &quot;backwards&quot; dmg in table 3. I know it confused me a bit first - but I realize thats probably just my personal taste - and either works just the same.<br />
<br />
Very nice little utility - my pleasure and honor to help test it a little.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">electrae</div><div class="date">07-15-2002, 06:13 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">You sort of already get 1 second resolution in the last table (FYI: The last table doesn't use that interval parameter, just the 2nd table which seriously needs revamping).<br />
<br />
Maybe I'll make an option so you get the last table rolling the numbers up on change rather than the interval end.  Is that more in line with what you wanted?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">JanSorensen</div><div class="date">07-15-2002, 08:29 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Since I can just make the interval 1 sec (in table 2) and then get every cell filled out in table 3 - I am already quite happy. <br />
<br />
I dont see table 2 as usefull anyway - only table 3 - so the interval set is of little use to me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Aldur</div><div class="date">07-16-2002, 06:41 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Interesting utility.  So basically You look at the tanks hps, at you want in a one on one fight for the largest possible heal to be tanks hps - 1.  <br />
<br />
However for example with the log at <br />
<br />
01:51 there is no damage for a 3 second chain, 5 or 6 seconds.  I guess this is because of insubstancial data, and any guess introducing inaccuracy.<br />
<br />
I you were willing to let 7k be a safe heal (assuming ya tank has more hps than that) then you could use 4 seconds for that part, however when checking all of the other columns in that row to make sure that there was none over 7k.  However if there is no valid data, the only valid thing to do baring with worst case scenario is to use the first available number to the right of that.<br />
<br />
Interesting.  Coding something so that you could enter in your maximum heal, and then it checks those figures and returns the maximum of seconds for a chain shouldn't be too hard to do.<br />
<br />
Now all you need to do is create a cleric battle analysis to work out the mean reaction times of a cleric (or ability to estimate the delay), or order to work out what the best delay is with respect to that :&gt;<br />
<br />
Just a quick question.  What precise format do you need to put in, in order for it to work?  I didn't have a log of a big fight available so I used a log of a fight I had, to see if it could tell me the dps of the mob hitting me but I couldn't get it to work.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Aldur</div><div class="date">07-16-2002, 06:48 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Also if a tank took the log, it would be useful to include spell damage, as for most mobs where it is unresistable, it does contribute to the damage on the MT.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'd agree with you for your first paragraph there except that you probably want to be conservative due to possibilities of delayed cheals.<br />
<br />
No melee damage either means that the mob missed a bunch, hit someone that wasn't included in the log (i.e. the log taker didn't have other's hits on) or else it is a natural part of their melee delay.  I've never fought AoW so I have no idea whether he is delivering damage every second or not.<br />
Hard to tell what we're seeing when you don't make the log yourself.<br />
<br />
I'd love to include spells as well in a later revision.  I might even be able to tell what spells the mob casts from resist messages and the message you get when the spell lands.<br />
<br />
I think my next modifications I'll remove Table #2 entirely.  Add an option to print Table #3 differently and provide a post battle summary. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">JanSorensen</div><div class="date">07-16-2002, 12:52 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok, maybe its some browser problem.<br />
<br />
Lets try a little test: http://nmcs.com/cgi-bin/fight.cgi?saved=TestMob.session.1 <br />
<br />
10 sec of fighting - hits every seconds - and I ran it with a 1 sec &quot;interval&quot;.<br />
<br />
So, there is no reason that the 00:08 line in table 2 only shows something under 1 sec, 3 sec and 9 sec.<br />
<br />
If you see something under 3 sec at 00:08 then it is indeed a browser problem.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">electrae</div><div class="date">07-16-2002, 01:15 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ah, good test.  I see data in Table 1 and Table 2 (I yanked out the old Table 2) starting at second 00:00 with damage of 10 going up to second 00:08 with 2 damage.  Both tables end at 00:08.  It looks like this found a small bug in that the last hit didn't make it to the table at all in Table 1 and it did something weird in Table 3.  I'll have to fix that.  Other than that it looks right to me.<br />
<br />
Ah, I think I see the confusion.  The table starts at 0.  So round 1 is actually: 00:00. So round 9 is 00:08.  9 is evenly divisible by 1, 3 and 9.  That might be confusing to people that aren't used to thinking of 0 being a starting spot.  I might change that so it's more intuitive.<br />

What you actually want given that dataset mikar?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">electrae</div><div class="date">07-16-2002, 04:23 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Currently it only shows the data at the end of each interval.  So, you'll only have a number every 2 seconds in the 2 second column that shows the last 2 second total.  Every 3 seconds in the 3 second column and so on.  It doesn't update each column everytime there's new damage, it just shows totals at the end of the interval.  It makes the table a little easier to read in my opinion.<br />
<br />
I mentioned before that I'll make it an option when I get a chance that you can have Simple Damage Table (i.e. Table 2) with intermediate updates rather than just interval totals.  But it might be a bit before I get to that.  <br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Aldur</div><div class="date">07-17-2002, 04:06 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Electrae the problem with using the current method is that it introduces rounding errors.<br />
<br />
For example say you were looking for a delay where there was 5k maximum damage.  And you look in the 2 second delay and there were 2 in a row that were 4950, then you would think it was ok.  However the damage distribution of<br />
<br />
1000<br />
3995 (4995 total per 2 second delay)<br />
3995<br />
1000 (4995 total per 2 second delay)<br />
<br />
would tell you it was fine.  By inputing those missing figures you would get<br />
<br />
1000<br />
3995 (4995 total per 2 second delay)<br />
3995 (7990 total per 2 second delay)<br />
1000 (4995 total per 2 second delay)<br />
<br />
The middle total missed off in the previous version shows that there was a burst damage above what you were looking for, but there is no indication of this in the other table.<br />
<br />
btw don't get me wrong, I think its a stonking program :&gt; just trying to create positive feedback.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Thats exactly the output I was looking for.<br />
<br />
I think thats the main - if not only - meaningful analysis when it comes to melee damage.</div></div><hr />

 http://nmcs.com/cgi-bin/fight.cgi?saved=The_AvatarofWar.session.4 <br />

By the way, did that fight really only last 3 mins?  Did you win it?</div></div><hr />

<br />
I would however put 0 in for rounds where there was no damage so that there are no gaps, since the gaps suggest missing data - rather than 0 damage which there was :&gt;<br />
<br />
141K damage over 3 minutes.  783 dps.  Doesn't sound that much except the maximum burst was 4361.  <br />
<br />
This is gonna be an exceptionally useful utility.  Top stuff.</div></div><hr />

No, the fight didnt only last 3 mins. We swap tanks as defensive runs out - so this is just the data from the one tank. <br />
<br />
Hmm, looks broken to me at the moment - I dont see any data at all. Neither in the old tests nor in the new ones.<br />

<br />
It's hard to say whether the data is missing or not.  If AoW is hitting someone else and the user doesn't log others hit we are missing data.  But I can put 0's in.<br />
<br />
I fixed the little bug that messed it up.  For some reason Emperor Ssrareahdiuoweurwue has a space at the end of his name and it was giving weird results, in the process of fixing that, I broke everything else.  Oops.<br />

Ahh, that explains why my Emperor Ssraeshza analysis did not produce anything. I'll try resubmitting the fight log.<br />

This sure beats parsing it all through spreadsheets after each fight!<br />

BTW: I deleted the first Emperor fight, but the second one is still there.  I have to figure out long I'm going to keep fights around.  Maybe I'll have a fight hall of fame for people that post excellent logs.<br />

Great, outstanding resource you have created. Our last Emp kill was about 38 minutes, so I chopped out a chunk for testing rather than attempting to paste in a rediculously large buffer.<br />
