[B] Ummmm....Who in their right mind would do that?  I think the cleric epic is a big enough pain in the arse before having to kill yourself and loot all but one item *EVERY TIME* you log off of the game. And one Linkdeath or server downage unannounced and the person would be screwdeded.

I can't see people farming the dragon for a no-rent bag unless they are really really hardcore gamers. In which case they'd have the epic already.

The sequence of events never created the bottleneck at ragefire. It was the desireability for the epic plain and simple. People will do what they have to for this.<P>The only way VI could have "fixed" this in most clerics eyes would have been to allow a quicker spawn time. The old way allowed a possible 3 epics a week (realistically), the new way seems to be about the same. The only real change is the number of clerics that can attempt the epic because now there is no camp, it is now first come first serve. On average, I see camps lasting years on and off for those unlucky/slow individuals.<P>VI has done no one in game any favors here. This move was more for them.

I think the only way that the Ragefire spawn could be fixed is to have ragefire be a triggered spawn in maybe like the druid one. That way your whole guild could be there and once ya turn in your pearl your guild could go to work. Just my personal opinion.

Cleric A is now screwed over and he petitions to get his pearl back and to have some reprecussion done to Cleric B. <P>This was a huge issue for Verent CS and they were devoting too much time to these issues. THEREFORE, they redid the epic such that these types of issues would be removed from the queue and their workload would hopefully deminish (sp?)<P>THAT is why we will probably NEVER see the epic tweaked to re-instate the handing over of your pearl to trigger Ragefire. <P>I hope that this helps shed light on this topic. <P>Good luck to you on obtaining your epics everyone!  <IMG SRC="http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/smile.gif"><P>Spawrhawk Wormwood<BR>59 Templar of Fennin Ro</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#dedfdf"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Mahtan Honorshield</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">But Spawrhawk, there's a very simple fix to that: You turn in the pearl in skyfire, and get the SAME pearl back at once, just like some of the coldain ring quests do it.<P>A turn in in Skyfire would work just fine if they did it this way, and if KSing happened, you would at least still have your pearl.</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#f7f7f7"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Dyonaisys</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial"> <BLOCKQUOTE><font size="1" face="Verdana, Arial">quote:</font><HR>Originally posted by Qwenya:<BR><B>Or they could make it like the Faydedar spawn where you give the swirling pearl to the Skyfire Zordak and he returns it to you and becomes the killable merchant.<P>Qwenya<P></B><HR></BLOCKQUOTE><P>If they did this then they would have to make him drop only the heart container.  because if they dodn't remove the loot, then you can have a cleric that already has epic to obtain a pearl just to trigger him for the loots and since the pearl isn't consumed you can repeat the process as many times you wanted when Zordak was up.

You choose to play on PvP, you choose to deal with issues like these. I don't want to hear you crying.<P>The advantage to playing on PvP is atleast you can exact some revenge. People on blue servers choose to not deal with unnecessary conflicts with other players. Usually greif players choose to play PvP, but then verant introduces quests where greif players can cause you harm even on blue servers. Those are the ones who I feel sorry for. The ones who wanted to play a game and have fun w/o grief players that get shafted due to a loop hole verant left in the game.<P>I mean you wanted conflict, they gave you conflict.
