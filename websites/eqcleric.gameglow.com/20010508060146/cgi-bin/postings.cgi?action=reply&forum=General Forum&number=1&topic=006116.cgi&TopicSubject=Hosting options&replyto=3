Only draw back is that you have to allow the popup to come up one time, then add it to the POW list so it doesn't come up again.

System overhead using POW is about 1% system resources used (my system:  550mHz, 128MB RAM).

Just FYI.    :D

That means Pay per View.<P>3) Find some other host like Mr Fixitonline.  Let me say now though that I'm very skeptical of any site that offers me free/minimal hosting charges.  I expect that situation to get a lot worse before (if) it gets better.<P>4) Move back to my personal domain and pay for the bandwidth overruns out of pocket (was averaging $100 a month when I moved).  And I can pass the hat around like Sunmoon.  **Click PayPal to give Rayne ur phat ca$h**<P>5) Admit that running this site is almost strictly a vanity issue for me, give up the ghost, find someone to take the messages and assimilate into another site (like Caster's Realm or possibly Interrealm/Sunmoon).<P>6) Really give up the ghost, say "cya" and let people find an EZ Board or start dumping on some other site and cause THEM bandwidth issues =P.<P>So, what do people think?  I have preferences, but my mind is open.  I'm just watching the clock tick and would like to save the message boards if possible.<P>Rayne</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#f7f7f7"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Brodder</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Oy Vey-<BR> Even though EZ Board's has bloody popup adds, you cna buy out of that option for $30 for 6 months I believe, unless you have a huge bandwidth site.<BR> I suggest front pages with static content hosted by you on your pesonal website. With Message boards on either EZ boards or another message board service.  This board service here has decent capabilities and compared to EZ board's the later just plain sucks.<BR> Find out from yu current hosts what the costs of remaining pop-up free would be. Them damn popups stack and stack eating up CPU processing power in amazing chunks, imagine the bandwidth and frame load from half a dozen animated and active X banners. Who's to prevent hooked banners...those are banner's who add in hooks into your processes and reoccur when you change pages even though you aren't on the source page anymore and they cache and cookie exchange your moves while active and your bowsr is up. Kinda invasive. <BR> Then there are the pop-up banners that are linked to the page itself, close the banner or pop-up add and the page's contents go BLANK...yep. Gotta keep it up to view...kinda like electronic torture and blackmail all in one.  PURE PITA (pain in the A**). Not to mention Cycle eating sumbiotches on your kernel's cycles.<BR> I've stopped going to certain websites where I've found that type of content, it's been only purgable with a full reboot. And some make my firewall go nuts.<BR> I think the pop-up adds with kel hooking capabilities are intrusive and a security risk.<P> back to the subject at hand- (it's late forgive me ehhh?)<P>  Site's with a history, and a contract you can ue as legal recourse are best.<P> I think EZ board's will still suffer as the internet restructures.<P> So home based hosted might be good- but then  you might not be able to play both your SK and Cleric same time neh?<P> I'm nearly done with EQ myself. Shadow's of Lucin is window dressing.<BR> I'm looking forward to SWOL and SB right now.<BR> And writing more. Screenwriter's strike coming up is going to kill me if it's longer than 3 months. Hopefully I can sell a few stories meanwhile and or a novel.<P> That's me 2 cents, and then some.<P>Brodder<BR></FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#dedfdf"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Aquinas</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">I believe EZBoard allows you to get rid of all pop-ups for everyone on the board for $15 per six months.  Personally, I find this suspiciously inexpensive, and question whether EZBoard's current approach is going to work.  But for $15, your risk seems minimal, even if they go belly up or come back and demand more later.<P>As for Flashlink, I'd be happy to pay the $2.50 a month or whatever they charge.  Economically, that seems them most sensible arrangement -- i.e., it seems like a system that might actually work.<P>Likewise with personal hosting: I'm happy to contribute something.  That probably means more work for you, as well as dependency on unpredictable donations.</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#f7f7f7"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">greywolffe</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Popup adds are not that big of a deal.

Like you mentioned earler, I'll bet the Static HTML pages with quests, and other information would cost $10-$15 if they were the only thing hosted by you... your major cost is the message boards.<P>Please don't just give up!  At least go with the free EZ Board route, yes we will have to start fresh with the messages, and those that don't have EZ Board logins will need to register a new name, but so what!
