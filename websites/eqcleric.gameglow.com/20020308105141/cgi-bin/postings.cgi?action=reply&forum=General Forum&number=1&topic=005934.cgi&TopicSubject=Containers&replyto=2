[B]Evil Eye Bag should be easy for you to get at your level, it's in lower guk i believe.

There is a new one in the warrens, it's only 6 slot but can contain large items and reduces weight by 10%. not much but it's free and pretty easy to get. It's no drop so you might have to get a lower level to help you, they drop off of greater shaman.

Tinker's bags are easy to get just really expensive. hehe I saw some guy in gfay on xegony the other night trying to sell one for 8k :) if he could sell that maybe i'll go into business for myself:P

Ya know the more crap like this that verrant does the more i think they really dont' want us to have fun. i mean it's not even a big issue so why are they doing it??? Don't they have more pressing matters to attend to like fixing the rest of the classes or the spawns on the epics?[/B][/QUOTE]

Near/around the church would be best xp but probably safer around library.  (btw, CR in kaesora can be a nightmare if you don't know the zone.  I wouldn't suggest someone go there for the first time and poke around solo)<P>Bag of Sewn Evil Eye (ee bag wt 3.0 70% 8 slots) in lguk of course always drops from the Evil Eye now, and is easily doable with a group around 45.<P>Archeologist Pack (wt 0.4? 25% 6 slots) is the common drop off the archeologist in permafrost.   Easily solo'able to a 45 cleric.<P>Light Burlap Sack (wt 3.0 75% 8 slots) is the common off the supplier in the assassin/supplier room in lguk. (tho supplier is kinda rare)  Great xp at 45 if I remember.<P>Momento Box (wt 2.0 70% 6 slots) is the (too) rare drop of the torturer in sol a.  But just for small items.  Easily soloable for a 45 cleric.<P>I'm sure there's plenty more, just can't think of them off the top of my head.  (And the wt/reduction may be off on a couple, just a ballpark figure)<P>If you're willing to sacrifice space to get a smaller container, there is a tailored large bag (silk chord+LQ bear skin/pelt) that's 6 slots and weighs 0.8 only.<P>You may have luck asking your monk friends what they use.  Containers are a very big deal to monks with their wt limit, and this new weight to the sewing kits will be a huge impact to them.

Or buy one for about 200-300pp. <P>Then get into the Assassin room (a.k.a. the supplier room) and get a Light Burlap Sack (Exactly the same as a EE Bag, but both are LORE so you can only have 1 of each). Or buy one for about 500-600pp.<P>Loot all the Fine Steel weapons you can, as these sell for 5pp+. Also offer to be the banker for Lower Guk. Buy FS for 2.5pp each and buy gold at 15-20gold for 1pp. This works really well if you bind at the Inn in Rate Mountains, load up on FS, gate to the inn and sell. You can make 300pp+ each trip.<P>Also, at 45, Sol B has a nifty spawn called the Guano Harvester. An invisible little gobber who is waaay green at 45 and drops 2 things. A cloak of shadow and a large soiled bag. The bag is 10 slots, 100% reduction, small-tiny items only. Makes a nice gem/potion bag.<P>But, in all seriousness, once you hit 49, weight will no longer be a problem with some time and patience. <P>Get 49, and park yourself in some out of the way place where level 30-40 people play, and a level 49 cleric is hardly ever seen, but usually wanted. Like Cazic Thule was my favorite, Rathe Mountains is also good. Park yourself in a safe place and /auc you are doing resses at this spot, if corpses are brought to you, for xxpp a head. (I usualy charged 25-50pp and made 500-1000pp an hour) Once you get 5250pp, find a gnome chanter you trust, give the money to him and ask him to go to Sol A and buy you a tinkerer bag (wt. 1.0, 10 slots, 100% reduction). One Tinkerer bag will increase your cash flow, as you can carry more loot, and soon enough you will find you have 2 or 3 or more tinkerer bags. I have 3 now, plus a EE Bag and a Large Soiled Bag. I am sorta saving up for another tinkerer bag someday.</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#f7f7f7"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Trawma Siirjen</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Great ideas guys, Thanks.<P>Some of this I can do, and some I cannot.
