<TEXTAREA NAME="EditedMessage" ROWS=10 COLS=45 WRAP="VIRTUAL">My Tanks have 3k to 4k Hps fully buffed.

Yes, I will use CH when my warrior is down low enough in health(20-30%).  Of course I use it, it is very mana-efficient.  This is usually the downtime Heal after a long and nasty pull.

But if my warrior ever gets this low, I swap CH into my line-up to heal him.  I -never- like to see my warrior get so low, it's dangerous for the entire group.  My point is during fights, keeping celest on the tank avoids potentially ugly situations where someone dies while you are casting CH (this can be the tank biting it because an extra mob poped out of nowhere and got a few good hits in right before CH lands, to losing the enchanter).  

Have you ever lost any groups members while casting CH?  My point is that for a little efficiency you could have probably prevented that.

When I play in my xp groups, I'm babied with a chanter to mez extras and a shaman to slow the mob we are fighting.  We are taking damage very slowly, with short spurts of high damage (while chanters are mezzing and shamans slowing).  If you are caught CH'ing your tank during one of these frenzy bursts, you could be fuxored.  

I can literally pull hours on end in my group dropping around 2 celest heals every 3 pulls on the tank, no other healing.  I'm nearly always FM, since other than a few stuns I'm always on my butt.  How long does it take a single slowed mob to do 3500 damage?  A looong time.  I don't like waiting for my warrior to lose hp's while I'm FM.  Sounds like worse waste to me than the extra few hundred Hp's I would get waiting for CH to become efficient, not to mention the fact that celest is nearly half the cost of CH.  I think it's a matter of the glass half full or half empty.  Has your warrior lost 1000 hp's or does he have 3000 left?  Something to ponder...  If your tank is not going to take more than 1000hps of damage over the course of the battle, than celest is the most efficient heal bar none(and the safest!).

I drop the celest when the tank hit s around 80%(usually right when the slow hits the mob).  The warrior then hums along for the next 30 seconds in guaranteed safety not taking any damage(it's being healed as it's applied).  If it's not dead in 30s, you are prolly doing something wrong.  In the mean time, my attention is on my other group members, the ones that die quickly when shiznit hits the fan, or they overnuke(common).

There are exceptions to this, times when CH is certainly called for.  Personally I will use it when the tank is taking more damage then celest can account for.  Read that line over it's an important one in my spiel.  It is also very rare which is why CH ain't on my regular spell list.

Anything with insane MR likely won't die in 30s, nor will it get slowed.  For this CH is beautiful, but the danger factor is much lower, as your casters are not pulling much agro.  Coldains for instance is a great example.  I wouldnt step foot in there without CH.  Warrior is also taking 3-8k of damage throughout the fight.  Not using CH would be suicidal.

This was not a shot at anyone at all, as I know most clerics keep CH up as a bread and butter heal, I'm just trying to figure out some of the reasons for it.  I had a couple of ugly experiences in my low 40's with CH, and have lost faith in it unless I feel very secure in the group, and celest can't keep up with the damage.
