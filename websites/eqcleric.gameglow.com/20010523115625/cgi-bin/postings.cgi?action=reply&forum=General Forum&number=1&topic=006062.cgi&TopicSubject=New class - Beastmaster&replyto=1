<TEXTAREA NAME="ReplyMessage" ROWS=10 COLS=45 WRAP="VIRTUAL">[QUOTE]Originally posted by Boanerges:
[B]Hopefully it's not based on the show because the show is awful...

Uhm... the "new" PC race is Kerran (you know, the feline people from Odus). Doesn't bode too well for Erudites like myself since we sorta don't like each other. More of a cop-out if you ask me (they took a poll a while back on this and Kerrans won and look what has come of it). Honestly, I'd prefer a brand new race (how the heck did kerrans wind up on the moon anyways?) but that's just me.

No clue about this new class, really. In fact, I'm a bit leery given that they're having massive problems with the 14 already out there and they're gonna add #15? Can you say "class balancing problems"? I knew you could. Most likely, only Kerrans will be able to be Beastmasters.

There are 2 likely possibilities here...

1. The new race is a pure pet class like mages and necros. Shamen have always been a secondary pet class. Their pets come much later in life and they aren't as effective as primary pets classes are. I imagine they would have an array of shaman and druid spells at their disposal. Perhaps they might get an array of animals to summon as well. Already wolves and bears can be summoned as pets. Think how awesome it would be to have a giant bear as your pet. It would also be likely that they would get all animal forms as well (again, bear and wolf). If Verant is smart (which they probably won't be) they would also include self only TPs.

2. A shaman-rogue hybrid. Think SKs but with shaman backing. The ability to SoW themselves (shamen get SoW before druids anyways), summon pets later on and would probably be a plate class (like the plate wearing bards who are enchanter-rogue hybrids) able to dual wield but capped well below a warrior in both HP and melee ability. They would be able to hide-sneak like a rogue but would not enjoy any other rogue privaleges (like lock picking, disarm trap or backstab). This makes sense since the Kerrans are cats after all. Rogues would not be too pleased, however.

Just my 2cp...

Some Ranger-like similarities crossed with the Enchanter's abilities to charm and mez but limit them only to animals or add in the Magician's ablities of summoning better animal pets (or at least different ones based on the terrain).  Basically make the Beastmasters the undisputed kings of calming and controlling animals and maybe animal-like monsters.  This would probably make them an outdoor class.
