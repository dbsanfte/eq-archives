[B]I don't think that any character should be able to hold the camp...I, too, have better things to do with my cleric than sit and ponder the wonders of VI's "Epic" quests, but if I'm willing to take my cleric and my time to camp the spawn, I don't feel that a non-cleric character should have the ability to claim the camp over me.  I guess the way I see it is:

Cleric v. Cleric: First in time, first in right
Cleric v. non-Cleric: Cleric
non-Cleric v. non-Cleric: see "Cleric v. Cleric," above

As I said earlier, if the player (the person, not one of many digital representations) is actually conscious and present in Skyfire but wants to play another character and can log the cleric in if asked, that seems to be fair.  (The wall to the North of the dragon statue is quite safe for clerical camping, barring someone kiting over you of course...)

If you're PK, then there's probably nothing of interest here.  We know you can kill each other and take the spawn. *grin*)<P>Having just witnessed a rather unpleasant /OOC situation (in which I was not personally involved, thankfully) in Skyfire after the killing of the server's second(?) Ragefire, I thought it might be prudent to poll the cleric community re: acceptable camping manners for this most painful stage of the quest.<P>While we still don't know for sure what the details are on the timing of the Skyfire spawn (reports so far suggest around 130 hours), we do know that there will be conflict over the spawn between clerics.  As I recall from before an EQ vacation I took, back in Sol B it was generally accepted (at least on my server) that in order to claim the camp over another epic-needy cleric, you had to have the cleric him/herself actually present and camping the spot.  This means no level 15 rangers or 59 druids could claim to be holding the camp when a cleric who needs the pearl (now box) shows up.  Personally, if the non-cleric is an alt and can log the cleric back in when other clerics want to watch for Rage, that's good by me, but if a real cleric is willing to spend the time staring at the scenery, then the party claiming to hold the spawn should be willing to do the same with his/her cleric.<P>Thoughts?  I'd much rather be informed of some major change in how this camp is handled now rather than get into an argument with a fellow cleric who just happens to be as freaked out about the quest as I am:)<P>Thanks.<P>------------------<BR>Hyrax<BR>Crusaders of Plilo<BR>Zebuxoruk</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#f7f7f7"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">derufin</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">I keep my gf's Warrior with her Invis BP up at the Ragefire spawn in SF (on her comp).

Well then there is no way Cleric B will leave RF up and wait for Cleric A to get around to kill him..<P>It will get ugly... and only way to regulate this in another way than FFA would be if there was a rotation order on the server much like the Karana Council of Guilds on Karana server wich rotate's wich guilds is next for all the big targets and plane's... Without a similar 'control' that is respected by all the guilds and players on the servers (and KCoG actually is) RF will be FFA im afraid...meaning the first guild who tag's him gets him... <P>Just my thoughts on how it will be... not saying that its the best solution...but reality...</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#f7f7f7"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Hyrax</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">I don't think that any character should be able to hold the camp...I, too, have better things to do with my cleric than sit and ponder the wonders of VI's "Epic" quests, but if I'm willing to take my cleric and my time to camp the spawn, I don't feel that a non-cleric character should have the ability to claim the camp over me.

I play on Veeshan.  It would be nice if some 3rd party would moderate and setup a queue for Ragefire, but that isn't going to happen on my server.  Basically, this spawn is "firstest with the mostest" and if the first fail, then you can be sure there will be elements of other guilds which will engage immediately and bring him down.  With reports of 120+ hours (someone at Verant needs to get a f*cking life!) respawn, I'm sure I'm not going to sit there non-stop and camp him.  So I will park a gimp there and check periodically and I'll ask my guild to do the same.  If we catch him up then we will mobilize.  If we get mobilized then we will engage.  If someone else is there then it will get nasty.  I've already been rolled once in Sol B and don't plan on letting any misplaced sense of "honor" stop me from finishing this epic.<P>I didn't design this screwy quest...put the blame where it belongs... thanks a lot Verant.<P>Good luck and good hunting.<P>-Metanis<BR>-59th Cleric<BR>-Dark Dynasty<BR>-Veeshan Server<BR></FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#f7f7f7"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">OgreAce</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Bah.. Ragefire. When I see someone with a cleric epic, I don't gasp with amazment. It's really not a sign for me of honour or even achievment. What I think when I see a cleric with an epic is "oh my gosh... there goes another looser that probably spent a couple of days staring at their computer waiting for some random number generator to come up with the right number" <P>I know... it's a bit harsh. Some clerics probably got their epics in quite reasonable ways, but still to me the epic isn't a badge of honor, it's more a big signpost that says: "Look everyone! I don't have a life!". <P>Let's face it... the Ragefire camp is evil and even the new Verant (sans Brad) with the new improved Ragefire camp isn't going to change my view. </FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#dedfdf"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Hakadek - Veeshan</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Metanis, I'm also on Veeshan, and I regret to say you are correct in explaining how it will go down.<P>With a 5 day spawn time there will just be a bunch of rangers and druids parked there to watch.<P>If you are camped there with a reasonable force then you get a head start, but if you have not engaged by the time another Rage capable force assembles then you'll lose it.<P>Far from ideal, and I do wish we had a list that people respected, but that sadly is unlikely to happen on Veeshan.<P>Ragefire is just like Lodizal, Trak and all the other Kunark dragons now.

Do this with at least 1 strong group on hand at all times.<P>He seems to pop in only 1 to 3 days after a zone or server reset.  Otherwise it's 5 or 6 days.  It's much easier to keep your friends interested over 3 days than 6.    Having a strong force on-hand at all times not only allows you to keep the trash spawns under control, but will tend to disappoint the casual cleric who just checks in once in a while. (Like me).<P>In the current spot in Skyfire, this allows your guild and friends to come and go as they please and you can get some exp and spell drops from the higher wurms, etc.<P>If you miss the "short" spawn after a zone reset, then you are basically screwed and need to be prepared to wait forever.<P>I have tried to figure out what effect the new Legends server might have.  I have heard several comments from people on Veeshan that they plan on moving to Legends.  I suspect the people willing to pay that fee to move are going to be the ones who long ago finished their epics.  That means a net decrease in the total of existing epics on Veeshan.  I would think that means more pressure on those of us who are left to get our epics.  So Legends may cause even more clerics to pursue their epic.  I wonder if Verant will pay attention to the statistics and loosen up the spawn rate if that happens?<P>LOL!  Who am I trying to kid?  Verant won't touch this again until or unless there is some major whining from the large guilds who can no longer find enough clickers to do the high-end game.<P>Sorry for my rambling, I'm waiting on a server to reboot and just expressing my disappointment with this whole cleric epic business.<P>-Metanis, 59th<BR>-Dark Dynasty<BR>-Veeshan<P>PS Hakadek, Good luck buddy!<P>PSS CrystanaRose60, you suck!
