Cleric may buff before combat, once the cleric has indicated that buffs are done, their mana is put at 100% and 3 level 55 mobs are spawned.  If the cleric survives, they are given 2 minutes, and then 2 level 60 mobs are spawned.  Again if they survive, they have another 2 minutes and one 63rd level mob is spawned.  All mobs are undead.  If the cleric dies in any of these rounds, they cannot move on to the next round.  Combat ends on the following 3 conditions:<P>1)  The Mob(s) are dead.<BR>2)  The cleric dies.<BR>3)  The rest of the clerics group is dead.<P>Each round is scored on the follow criteria:<P>1)  Number of group members standing<BR>2)  Total HP remaining in entire group, clerics hp are not counted.<BR>3)  Aggro management<BR>4)  Crowd Control<BR>5)  Damage Done by Cleric<P>I'd say thats a relatively fair weighting of cleric abilities.</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#f7f7f7"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Zygote</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><BR>they are meant to be pvp fights. it doesn't judge a clerics group skills, which would be part of a test of tactics contest.<P>Besides, its not really a test of clerics ability to have 5 GM controlled players, because a cleric good or bad doesn't determine solely how good or bad a group is. All the gears in the machine have to work.</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#dedfdf"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">kitsinu</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">The Cleric BotB is probably going to be ugly.  Very high MR will leave the Clerics meleeing and healing themselves.  The only thing making victory possible is the fact that we won't be able to use equipment effects to self heal.  Make no mistake about it, these fights are going to take forever.  <IMG SRC="http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/smile.gif"></FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#f7f7f7"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Kimbera</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Maybe it will be a true cleric BotB, then... whomever can stay awake the longest wins, which seems to be consistent with camps for cleric gear...</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#dedfdf"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Treskin</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">If it was true fighting (would be melee only as previously stated, I know i could get my MR up to 250), whoever had flowing thought 2, or probably even 1 would win.

They are paid a horrible salary to perform customer service jobs.<P>A guide might be okay, but you don't know if it's a guide who plays 5 hours a week and likes guiding, or a guide who plays 40 hours a week and knows the game.<P>I also don't really understand how I would be ranked on Crowd Control, which clerics can't do on 55+ mobs, and would therefore be rating us on the GM chanter.<P>Or aggro management, which it has recently become apparent some GMs and the president of the company have no idea about.</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#f7f7f7"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Rizena Halcyon</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><BR>For the Cleric BoTB, I'd like to see something along the lines of Boridain Glacerbane in the Coldain ring quest.  For those who aren't familiar with the quest, you have to follow a low level NPC around on his hunt for a Rabid Tundra Kodiak.  While on his journey, he gets attacked (or tries to attack) giants and orcs.  It's your job to keep him alive.  A cleric could do this by using stuns, roots, crowd control techniques, and any other trick in the book.  You'd have to use nukes and melee to "help" Boridain out with his hunt.  To me, this would more effectively use all of a clerics ablities.. more than just healing and more than just damage output.<P>Rizena Halcyon<BR>Templar of the Mithril Tower<BR>Ayonae Ro<BR></FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#dedfdf"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Ozzn</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">A big problem with your idea is that a lot of GM's haven't not fought in the high level game.  They won't know some of the tricks to keep the agro on the warrior.  This wouldn't be an issue if each cleric's "Team" was run by the same 5 folks, though.<P>Ozzn<P></FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#f7f7f7"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Fycksir</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">I think they need to let each cleric bring one ranger/SK/pally friend (random to choose).  This team mate would be spawned from scratch though, say lev 55, and all the equipment should be exaclty the same, maybe even naked except for one/two weaopons, all spells would be available too.  Then let those two person teams duke it out.<P></FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#dedfdf"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Selene_Soulbinder</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">I agree that pvp isn't showing a clerics daily skills at all.<P>the probleam with most all these ideas is that there are to many varables from match to match.  Things won't be the same for every cleric.<P>Only way to make this work that I can see is to have groups of npcs running a script and a cleric tyring to keep them alive. (like someone suggested above)  But that would give advatage to clerics compeating later as they could carfully watch the script and know what to expect during there turn.<P>If the script was changed then things whouldn't be fair becuse it wasn't the same.<P>I remember the Lady of the BoTB addressing the clerics before and saying it would NOT just be a stright out PvP fight and that it WOULD be a display of there daily role.. but she didn't not explain how.<P>Guess we will soon see.  I too do not think I'd particapte if it was just a stright out pvp battle.. as this is not what we do.</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#f7f7f7"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Aean</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">They should just set up a big chess match,<BR>after all clerics are the thinking players <IMG SRC="http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/wink.gif"></FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#dedfdf"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">daku inochi</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Selene: "I remember the Lady of the BoTB addressing the clerics before and saying it would NOT just be a stright out PvP fight and that it WOULD be a display of there daily role.. but she didn't not explain how."<P>See which cleric can sit fastest and for the longest period of time.

However, to make it fair, I think the only way this would work would be for the GM's to use brain-dead pvp tactics. The only way to set it up so that theres not many accusations of one cleric getting a "ringer" GM, would be for them to just stand in front of each other, auto-attack, and dont move. If they get pushed out of melee range, then move just enough to be back in range, etc.<P>If they did something like that, it could work, maybe. One things for sure, I cant see how in the world they can make this a pvp match like all the others, unless they want these tournaments to last 11 hours ; ) Put me and my horrible pvp ability against the best pvp cleric in the world, and I guarantee I can last at least 20 minutes after putting on my BD jewelry ; )</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#dedfdf"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Aldur</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">I wanna see what they do for the bard botb.  Knowing verant who know jack about the class it will probably be straight pvp, in which case if they do bard before cleric then we are safe from a bobt - bard one won't be complete before eq gets closed down.</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#f7f7f7"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Niccy</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial"> <BLOCKQUOTE><font size="1" face="Verdana, Arial">quote:</font><HR>Originally posted by Selene_Soulbinder:<BR>I remember the Lady of the BoTB addressing the clerics before and saying it would NOT just be a stright out PvP fight and that it WOULD be a display of there daily role.. but she didn't not explain how.<BR><HR></BLOCKQUOTE><P>She didn't explain how because they hadn't thought of anything, as I suspect they probably STILL haven't.
