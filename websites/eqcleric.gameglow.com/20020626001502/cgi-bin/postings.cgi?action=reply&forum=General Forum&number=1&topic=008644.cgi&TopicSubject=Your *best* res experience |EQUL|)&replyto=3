[B]I think I had my best rez experience on my druid, hehe.  I was 33 at the time, and I had LITERALLY lost 33 more times than I have levels on her.  Different things happened... zoned to WC, just in time to get stomped by a nightfall giant right as sow ran.  Zoned into NK right on top of grimfeather.  Ported someone to SFG, ran outside, found out I was KOS to the Qeynos guards (still dont' know why, but fixed the faction with bandits).  Had someone PULL, yes PULL an ice giant to our group in everfrost.  Speaking of Everfrost, can you say martar icebear?  Oh, and don't forget and wolf form yourself there, either.  Etc, etc.  

Anyhow, I finally got a whole yellow into 33!  Enough to cushion me, right?  Well, I then got trained, and chain killed on my bind point.  By this time, I was in tears.  I had carefully scrimped and saved 100pp, so I offered it in the next zone over where high levels hang out.  I figured no one would do it, as 100 wasn't much for the number of rezes I needed and they were all almost for sure grouped, anyhow.

Well, a paladin came out, rezed ALL those corpses, and then logged while I was trying to give him the cash.  "paladin tells you, I'm busy right now" then vanishes. It was enough to reding me.  I was at that point willing to take any rez, LOL, just so long as it dinged me, and those 50% rezes did the trick for me.  I've a lot to catch up to where i was at, but at least I still have my level!  (lame, eh?  hehe)[/B][/QUOTE]

Very entertaining read )))<P>Now... I have been lucky. Gone through 48 levels so far, and no real bad ones. A couple with no "thank you", but then I pointedly send them a tell with something like "As advice for the future, clerics are much more likely to resurrect you again if you thank them".<P>Anyway. Lately, I had two great experiences with resurrections... and where else than in "n00b" heaven: LOIO =)<P>The first time, I had been rezzing a level 60 monk in the middle of the lake. Swim, med, click, and he had to run to bank for money. 80pp, here you go. Thanks, bow, /smile.<BR>Immediately after finishing with the monk, I get a /tell from someone in FV. They had died on their way to LOIO. Bad spiders!<BR>-Where are you?<BR>-Soulbinder<BR>-And the corpse?<BR>-By the river just before the LOIO zone.<BR>-Run for 1 minute, zone into FV, see corpse. /tell x you ready?<BR>-Yes<BR>Click, rez, heal<P>And she gives me a Firiona Rose and 5pp. I wanted to click Cancel trade, I did not want her money, but the Rose was so sweet I couldn't cancel.<P>Next:<P>Yesterday, I have finished a days hunting in KC. Run to FV to bank and shop.<BR>Someone shout that they need a resurrection... Fine, I am about to go to bed anyway, a few minutes won't matter.<BR>-Heya there, I can resurrect you. 75%, is that ok?<BR>-Sure!<BR>-Where is the corpse?<BR>-I tried to find the mill, I was running by the river and some frogloks chased me and killed me.<P>Ok...confused a moment. Mill... frogloks. Ah well, she thought mill was in FV no problem.<BR>Problem: Where is that corpse??<P>Then she sends tell:<BR>-My corpse is at xxx xxx xxx (loc)<P>All newbies: I don't care if you don't know Everfrost from Great Divide, but if you have the sense to get a loc on your death spot you will make it far in this game! =)<P>I ran through FV greenies/light blues... no sow, so slightly dangerous. I am only a cleric after all. Stun/Root/Atone on 5 or 6 mobs, and eventually I get to the loc she quoted:<P>The corpse is on that exact spot.<P>(All the time, she is sending tells "be careful, it is dangerous out there"... "take care" ... "how are you doing?")<P>Ok... person wants to go to mill in LOIO. I could drag corpse to LOIO zone I guess... nah, I drag it to bridge in FV instead. Better do this properly the first time. Give her a proper spider scare, and show her that it is not really dangerous at all (it isnt! the spiders wont aggro you unless you try to ride them).<P>Drag to bridge, rez, buff the poor girl up (18 chanter), even with my last Peridot. I really want her to survive the spider run  <IMG SRC="http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/smile.gif"><P>One of us is group bugged, so she just follows me normally (which is by far the best way to teach people the way =). Shows her the way to LOIO zone, past some spiders, all went well. Got her to the mill. <P>No donation at all, but profuse thanks. She didnt stop thanking me at all as my CAMP counter went down.<P>And: The half hour it took to resurrect that girl was waay more fun than the hours I had been xp grinding in KC.</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#f7f7f7"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Tommara</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Good idea for a fun topic!  I just recently returned from EQ after having played Anarchy Online and Asheron's Call for a bit.  I had an interesting experience soon after logging on, which I e-mailed to a friend (who had been playing AO and AC with me.)  Being lazy, I cut and pasted it below (with some editing of irrelevant stuff)(Tommar is my ranger and Tommara my cleric):<BR> <BLOCKQUOTE><font size="1" face="Verdana, Arial">quote:</font><HR><BR>I played EQ for a bit last night, primarily to get Tommar and Tommara back together in OOT.  While waiting at Freeport for the boat, someone cast DMF on Tommar.  I turned around to say thanks and return the favor with SoW, and saw a naked DE =>high probability that she died on seafury isle.  Upon checking, I found out this was the case, so I told her that I had a cleric that was headed that way too.  She was very grateful, couldn't believe her "luck", and never once looked the gift horse in the mouth by asking what level my cleric was.  Then, as soon as Tommara zoned into OOT, someone sent her a tell asking if he could get a res if he brought the body to me.  I told him sure, and told him where I was heading.  Throughout the journey there, I chit-chatted with the first necro (both turned out to be necros) although a bit distracted with trying to run two characters, keeping up with two sets of "tell" conversation AND guildsay.  <P>When Tommara finally arrived and then ressed the two necros, the second one started this odd rant in OOC, about a druid he helped with locate corpse, having to travel 3 zones to do so, who then left him stranded by logging before seeing if he needed a port out.  Adding insult to injury, when he inspected her, she had a price list as a bio.  I was still somewhat distracted, trying to get the two necros healed and buffed, refusing the donation offered by the second necro, while also trying to get Tommar and Tommara grouped, but I was wondering why he was going on about that. <P>Then he said in OOC something like "It's really nice that there are people like Tommara to make up for a$$e$ like that".   He then sent me a tell saying how I really made his day, and if I ever needed help, etc.<BR><HR></BLOCKQUOTE><BR>That was really neat, and made it a nice homecoming back to EQ, especially after the lonely worlds that are AC and AO.

Well, commonly a poor Mage or Druid or Necro will die to one of these wussies and plead with anyone in zone for a rez.  Usually, Everfrost is a zone that doesn't contain any high-level Clerics.. if any at all.  So if I'm in the area (or remotely close) I'll usually get a notice from a Guildmate letting me know that there are a few poor folks with expiring rez timers.  I usually don't mind rezzing these people because they've been hunting IGs and I know they'll gladly welcome my presense.  <P>This particular time I was there to rez a fallen Guild member.  While there, an /anon Necro asked me if I could spare some time for a rez.. he would gladly pay.  Gladly pay, boy did he ever.  Just as soon as I rezzed him he dropped me dropped nearly 500pp in the trade window for a 90% rez.  I turned it down.  I told him I'd gladly welcome a donation, <B>but not that much</B>.  I settled for 100pp instead and continued to feel guilty about it.  But I buffed him and his pet well and went on my way.  More times than not.. most people never even thank you for a rez, much less offer to pay you.  Sometimes you'll get someone that wants to pay you some insane amount of money for a rez -- and I'm soft, so I always turn it down.<P>Some Halfie I turned out to be.  <IMG SRC="http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/wink.gif"><P>------------------<BR>[52 Vicar] <A HREF="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=57051" TARGET=_blank>Skwar</A> (Halfling) <A HREF="http://www.clanchaosofxev.com" TARGET=_blank>&lt;Clan Chaos&gt;</A></FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#f7f7f7"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Kist</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Sometimes travelling around the world rezzing people is more fun then playing.
