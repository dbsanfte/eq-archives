<TEXTAREA NAME="EditedMessage" ROWS=10 COLS=45 WRAP="VIRTUAL">quistil if it was 'not your problem' that we didn't have an opportuinity to kill aary - why is there a problem if a guild fails to kill it?

And aary is only the lock on Ntov so to speak if he is up.  If not then the linearity of the zone is removed greatly.

You can't claim that having an opportunity to kill aary is our problem and then moaning when a guild takes advantage of you removing that opportunity.  

No guild can demand that you leave aary up for them, you are absolute right there - however if you kill aary you also relienquish any claims of stopping other guilds from doing the zone, once you leave that zone.

You say that it is possible to pull round CT, effectively neutrilising it.  But it is also possible with Ntov to either go in before it has spawned or go in when it is dead.  Why is pulling round something acceptable, but attempting when something is dead not?

Recently my guild attempted tunare for the very first time, we spent hours clearing (which is required from what we had heard) in order to make the attempt.  After 3 attempts, we took the knowledge we had learnt and left, knowing we would be back another day to retry.

After that another guild came in and killed tunare.  They had every right to do what they did - we had relienquished rights to the zone as soon as we had left (though they were a bit cheeky on their web page saying they cleared the plane).  Why is skiping one set of content different from skipping another?

We know that everything in pog is trivial (though the first time we attempted tunares guards we were in for a shock), is that what makes skipping the content different? The zone was definitely arranged (by the fact that she calls stuff to her) so that it had to be cleared first.

The fact that we have not done something in no way suggests that you are not capable.  My guild has never killed the dain due to faction, but I have absolute confidence that should we choose to do so, he would die.

The fact that we can not prove it because others will not let us, yet require that proof in order to not whinge about us attempting other things is rather conflicting at best.

And yes we do plan on making aary our top priority.  But the very fact that any other guild has the nerve to try and prevent my guild from doing anything in the game is what is most shocking.</TEXTAREA>
