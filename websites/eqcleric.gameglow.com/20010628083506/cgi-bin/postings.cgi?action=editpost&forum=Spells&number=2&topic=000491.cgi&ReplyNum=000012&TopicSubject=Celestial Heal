<TEXTAREA NAME="EditedMessage" ROWS=10 COLS=45 WRAP="VIRTUAL">I really think that Celestial Heal is a great spell, it's defintely not always for use on tanks, that's for certain. 

I think that a lot of people don't really realize the low aggro that this spell generates and factors that in with some situations. 

I was in Sebelis the other day with my druid because one of my guildmates needed a snarer, so I joined them in the Jail. There was a cleric there that did not use CH, and had 2 tanks and a rogue in group besides the enchanter and him. I join the group, immediately go into gchloro/gthorn mode, and doing the normal snaring of all mobs and dotting the ones that are engaged with the tanks with my ES vambs... 

I'm watching the tanks health, and they hit 1 bubble, and the cleric casts CelHeal... *sigh* and sits back down...

I'm like "WTH are you doing man!!!" to myself as I watch in disgusted amazement the frog takes the warrior down. At this point the warrior is almost dying and I get a tell: "Heal man, this cleric's worthless, he's not using CH at all..." 

First off... the cleric is level 51. No Div Light. Only Remedy. No problem there, but now that pretty much narrows him down to three spells, imho... Remedy, CelHeal, and CH. Now, the way I do it is I let the tank call it when he *wants* to go low, and use his Disc's for the Crits or what have you. ONLY then do I ever let a tank even get NEAR one bubble of health left. I make this perfectly clear at all times because in a place like Seb, you can get one bad pull and bring 10 frogs with you, and people will go down FAST. That is not a time for CelHeal. That's the time for Remedy/DivLight, CH, and LASTLY CelHeal. 

CelHeal is *definitely* situational.

Here's how I use it:

Same group: 2 tanks, Rogue, Druid, my 54 Vicar, and Enchanter: 

Spells memmed from top to bottom: Reckoning, Stun(5), Holy Might(stun), 49 Root, CH, CelHeal, DivLight, Remedy.

In Seb, having Divine Barrier up is a waste of my time and a valuable spell slot. I can stun, root, and sit/mem gate quickly or run to a spot where CR is easy enough if my group gets overrun somehow. 

Now... I'm regarded as a pretty effective cleric, I rarely have a death, and if it is, it's usually either due to lag, or because I had to make a judgement call and let someone die. I keep the actual 'mistake' deaths to a minimum. Here's what I do:

Tank pulls 2-3 mobs, chanter mezzes, tank engages one. Pretty easy fight, usually this kind of pull goes pretty well, as long as mezz is kept, healing the tank is a snap, and I'll use CelHeal on him occasionally to keep him and others fresh, unless he says to let him get low to use disc's, then I sit and wait for the CH time. This is a fine situation to use it in, you cast and sit back down to med. No biggie, right?

Now imagine the same pull, but something goes horribly wrong and the chanter can't mez a couple. Tank's getting beat on, Chanter gets beat on, and I'm in the situation where the tank will die about the same time as the chanter or sooner... 

Fire off DivLight/Remedy to save chanter, immediately turn and hit tank with remedy/divlight (depending on his health bar dropping speed) and then follow up with CelHeal, to give me a moment to assess the rest of the group's situation. By this time the chanter should have recovered and tried to mezz (hopefully successfully) again. If chanter is getting beat on by a single mob, fire off stun quickly, then root while chanter backs off, as soon as root hits, Fkey the chanter, hit 4 (cel heal) and turn attention back to tanks/rogue. Now... during this time the Druid should have been doing HIS job and watching the chanter's back for me, as well as follow up heals for him while I divert my attention to others... Notice I assume the druid *isnt'* doing his job, but I know they do most of the time, and back me up when I have that choice to make. If you're playing as a well organized team, you should be able to pick up on what the cleric's order of importance is, and cover accordingly. 

 When I'm playing my druid, the Chanter and cleric are MY responsibility to watch, I keep THEM alive while they keep the others safe. 

The whole time I cast my heals, I have done by hotkeys, my 1 key is sit, 2 is cast first stun (/cast 2) and then 3 is CH, 4 CelLight, 5 Div Light, and 6 rememdy. I use a split keyboard, so 6 key is very easy to find, even by touch. I always make all hotkeys announce the spell being cast, and the target being cast on, in Group say, and using the :emote command. This covers me when I'm casting on a non-group member, and is a good thing too!

Anyway, I depend on CelHeal as a low aggro heal when time demands are not tight as to how fast a player *needs* healing, so I can fire it off, sit back down, and assess the situation. When it is a tense fight and I know I have to conserve mana, the only thing the tanks are gonna get is CH. Let em get low, start casting at 2 bubs of health, it'll hit when they're at 1 bubble, plenty of safety net, as long as they're not getting slammed super fast. If they're dropping too quick, a remedy/div light, followed by a cel heal and then maybe another div light to get em higher so I can reassess my timing for a CH, or divert attention to another party member while the CelH works on the tank and *hopefully* either keeps them at where they're at or gain health back. 

Typically though I use Cel Heal for the following: 

Non-critical heals where the player isn't being beat on and is a caster/rogue/bard, or need to heal not super quick to keep aggro down.

Keeping tank at a status quo while I med, or divert my attention, where aggro on myself needs to be kept at a minimum (i.e. can't do a CH or I'm gonna get gang banged) again, healing over time demands exactly that: TIME to heal. 

Situations I don't use CelHeal: 

Multiple mobs, needing mezzes, waiting to beat on chanter or tank, Mana conservation times, or when Tank's health is just dropping too darn fast to keep up with using CelHeal. When I am timing for CH, or when a tank wants to bezerk/use disc.

Cel Heal should be used only when you have the TIME for it to work. If you cast CelHeal on a caster while they're getting beat on, you had better hit them with a BIG heal first to top em, so that the CelHeal works like a "maintenance" heal over time, so that the tanks have time to peel the mob off them.
