<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Windfire</div><div class="date">08-27-2002, 03:33 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok.. I just found this board and I thought I should post about the upcomming heals that ARE going live on the 4th. The reason I say they are going live is because of everything Varents been saying. Basicly they are putting out fires and delayed the patch because &quot;Certain spells need more testing&quot;.  <br />
<br />
Couple of things.<br />
<br />
Everyone thinks this spell is a 2k - 3k heal. Its not. has a 75% cap which means the spell ONLY heals the person to 3 1/2 bubbles of there current life bar. If its 1 hp or 3k hp the target will only be healed to 75% with a MAX of 2-3k.<br />
<br />
That is why the 75% restriction is there. If it was a CHEAL with a max of 2-3k it wouldnt say that. The spell clearly says 2925 (75% max). If it was the way everyone thinks it is, it would say Complete Heal (2925 Max).<br />
<br />
So if a person has 1000hp and is down to 1hp this spell will only heal them 749 hps.<br />
<br />
Personaly, I think this spell is stupid and pretty much useless. The only time this spell becomes usefull is if a tank is down to 10%-20% life. Which usually doesnt happen unless you in a chain heal for raids.<br />
<br />
IF IM WRONG:<br />
==========<br />
<br />
However, if for some reason I am wrong or the spell is changed, this spell is going to change the face of grouping forever.  Gone will be the days of waiting for clerics to zone into sebilis. Druids atleast on my server are the most played class. So waiting for a cleric wont be an issue anymore.<br />
<br />
Now of course clerics will always be taken over druids and shamans for healing. You are the best at it. However Varent is basicly forcing people to group with druids. For the longest time druids have had a hard time grouping (I really never cared ill just go solo). Now with this heal, druids can easily be the main healer in a group.<br />
<br />
Alot of clerics dont think a 3k heal is alot.. It is...<br />
<br />
I can currently main heal with a slower in group in most exp groups. Figure this: <br />
<br />
Natures Touch<br />
1000hp heal<br />
400 mana<br />
5.5 cast time<br />
<br />
The new Druid Cheal (if im wrong)<br />
2925hp Heal<br />
450 mana<br />
10.0 cast time<br />
<br />
We are getting tripple the heal, for 50 mana more and only double the cast time. You do the math.<br />
<br />
There are many factors to be added:<br />
<br />
Most druids that main heal also have a free Regrowth the Grove Breastplate, Cholroplast, etc. This also cuts down on healing.<br />
We must factor in that the average cleric starts his Cheal at about 35% of the persons life. The &quot;average&quot; tank has 5k hitpoints. The druid Cheal will easily cover his hitpoints. Same mana cost and same cast time as normal Cleric Cheal. We also must factor in Healing Addept and Healing Gift. 10% to this heal spell is alot, and crit heals.. thats a 6k heal!<br />
<br />
Over all if im right, Clerics will be fine. wont change a thing. If im wrong the cleric roll will be greatly impacted. <br />
<br />
Personaly, I dont want your roll in a group. Now with Dot stacking changing and the crazy crits druids can do with nukes (3k) I want to be more offensive then utility. I for one will not want to take the place of any cleric in a group. Atleast with me your spot is secure.<br />

<br />
wrong.  It does ~3k hp... if the target only has 4k and it hits when he's at 25%, then he's at full health.<br />
<br />
If im wrong the cleric roll will be greatly impacted.<br />
<br />
<br />
Yup - and that's why all the furor.  We beleive that &quot;impact&quot; will be when given a choice between midfifties cleric, druid and shaman for that 6th spot in the group, the cleric will always lose.<br />
<br />
I for one will not want to take the place of any cleric in a group. <br />
<br />
But if your group is forming for an EXP run - they'll certainly NOT add a cleric if you're there.    However, if the group already formed and you go LFG and can't find one....<br />
(I really never cared ill just go solo).<br />
<br />
well - you always HAD that option... and you'll STILL have that option.  Clerics didn't have that option and are really skeptical that they'll be given equivalent capacity to do it that you enjoy.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Windfire</div><div class="date">08-27-2002, 04:09 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">That doesnt make sence.<br />
<br />
Why would they put in a 75% cap on a spell when it doesnt matter anyway? If its just a 3k heal why dont they just make it a 3k heal.<br />
<br />
The wording in the spell code is:<br />
<br />
Heal Target Player 2925 Hit Points (75% max)<br />
<br />
---<br />
<br />
wrong. It does ~3k hp... if the target only has 4k and it hits when he's at 25%, then he's at full health.  <br />
Then thats just a normal 3k heal. <br />
<br />
So where the hell does the 75% part come into play? Unless the spell has be written to make clerics feel better by putting in (75% max).<br />
Has anyone seen this spell in use yet on test? Any confirmation?<br />
<br />
Yup - and that's why all the furor. We beleive that &quot;impact&quot; will be when given a choice between midfifties cleric, druid and shaman for that 6th spot in the group, the cleric will always lose.  <br />
<br />
I wouldnt. I would take a Cheal cleric over a druid/shaman anyday.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Belhaven</div><div class="date">08-27-2002, 04:19 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">it's buried in one of the many threads in the General forum, and perhaps even disclosed in more than one.<br />
<br />
Why would they put in a 75% cap on a spell when it doesnt matter anyway?<br />
<br />
well - to explain why it's not a 10k heal :) (apparently, percentages are not their strong suit)<br />
<br />
In most EXP situations the druidic CH will heal the tank at LEAST to 75% and quite often to 100%.  The Shaman wont do that, but then, with Slow it's not as necessary, and they CAN'T have your heal becuase of the multiplicative effect it would give to Cannabilize.<br />
<br />
Now you see why we're, um...  complaining?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Windfire</div><div class="date">08-27-2002, 04:33 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Nope because i still dont see where the 75% max comes into effect. Since there is a cap, I would like to know a situation where the cap is actually used. The cap is there for a reason. Why would they put it in when the cap is never used.<br />
<br />
The only cap on this spell in your theory is the 2925. But Im still curious about the (75% max). There is another cap somewhere, has to be.<br />
<br />
well - to explain why it's not a 10k heal  (apparently, percentages are not their strong suit)  <br />
Cheal isnt a &quot;10k heal&quot; because no players ever have 10k hp (atleast for now) so thats why they dont call it a 10k heal.<br />
<br />
There are also no percents in the spell codeing either. <br />
<br />
-----------<br />
<br />
Druid Cheal has a 75% cap.. Its there, someone needs to come up with a situation where that cap will come into effect  before I can believe its nothing more then healing the player to 3 1/2 life bars.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Serenya</div><div class="date">08-27-2002, 04:45 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Actually, it's simpler then it sounds, and quite a common situation in an experience grind.   If my warrior has 3000 hit points, the most you will be able to heal her for is (.75 * 3000) = 2250 hit points.   So, if she is at 25% of health, you'll heal her to full.  If she's at 10%, you'll take her to 85% of health, or good enough since regen is on her, with a 2250 heal.  The hard hit point cap doesn't come into play until the warrior has enough hit points where 75% of total hitpoints is more then 2925 (in other words, more then 3900 hitpoints), AND that warrior is below 25% health.   So, take a warrior with 4000 hit points, and heal at 1 bubble, and you'll hit that hard cap, but still be close enough to full as to make no nevermind.   It doesn't really make a significant difference until you're hitting raid level hitpoints (6 or 7k), and most CH chains average a 3K heal anyway……..</div></div><hr />

<br />
You shout: &quot;22nd level cleric LFG&quot;<br />
Tallisan shouts &quot;20th level Druid LFG&quot;<br />
Colewulf Shouts &quot;Drood to FD&quot;<br />
Colewulf tells you &quot;Can you rez my friends at the FD?&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
This is what is currently happening. When attempting to get a group Clerics are usually passed over for Druids and Shaman.<br />
<br />
<br />
Now add a major heal. I know my cleric is only 22 and the druids I am competing with wont get this spell, but this is just the beginning.</div></div><hr />

I have no problem with a fix that reduces the &quot;absolute need&quot; for clerics.  There should not be a situation in day-to-day play where five other people say &quot;well, we don't have a cleric... may as well log.&quot;<br />
<br />
But clerics DO need to remain (at worst) a viable alternative to a druid or shaman in the same day-to-day play, where the &quot;75% CHeal&quot; is &quot;good enough&quot;.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Good.  We shouldn't be anymore absolutly needed than any other class.  Reduces the guilt feeling for me when I have to log off.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Windfire</div><div class="date">08-28-2002, 06:10 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Its pretty gay if you ask me that a group MUST have a cleric and a chanter to anything. IT seriously sucks waiting for a cleric and chanter to zone into sebilis. All you hear all day is &quot;Group needs cleric to move&quot;. THen when a cleric zones in, he/she is raped with tells.<br />
<br />
It shoukd say &quot;Group needs HEALER to move&quot;. And of course if its a choice of a druid/shaman or cleric.. The Cleric should be taken.<br />
<br />
Thats why they gave the bard that uber mezz song so they can keep up with chanters in groups.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Aenia</div><div class="date">08-28-2002, 11:21 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Windfire I'd also just like to add that even *if* the spell only heals the target up to 75% of full hps, that's only a bit over one bub of health from full hp which most tanks won't even bat an eye at.  I have a hard time keeping a pulling tank from running off at less than half hps to pull more.  Makes me nervous when they do that :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Baikhal</div><div class="date">08-29-2002, 02:05 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Why did you chose to play a druid ?<br />
- to be abble to heal &amp; buff your party ?<br />
- to do kickass dot/nuke damages ?<br />
- to port/travel everywhere at fast speed and safetly ?<br />
- to be abble to track things in a area ?<br />
- to be abble to solo easily ?<br />
- to be abble to group easily ?<br />
<br />
Lot of druids in game chose this class because :<br />
- advice of a friend, druid is an easy class to start and discover the game<br />
- solo ability moreover after looking at this cool dude runing fast and killing mobs 4 by 4<br />
- portslave alt<br />
<br />
If someone chose druid to be abble to heal a party, let's be serious, he mistaken.<br />
Druids can do a lot of things, but they cant make something better or as good than a class specific. Their nuke, dot, buff, heal are less powerfull than wiz nuke, necro dot, cleric buff/heal but they have all that ! In his wonderfull generosity, thinking it wasnt enought, VI gave them even track, port, and few fun and usefull things like faction/melee modifier wolffom and part of chanters abilities against animals see DC, charm, fear.<br />
<br />
I think druid class is not designed to do high level raids (even if they help greatly when they are well played), nor beeing main healer in a high level dongeon. Druid is an excellent pvp class, and a wonderfull way to discover the game, travel and solo. This class works as intended.<br />
<br />
Druids complaining how their heal sucks compared to clerics is the same a warrior complaining how their output sucks compared to rogues. You chose a class for a certain purpose, dont cry if you made a bad choice and whine to have it changed.<br />
<br />
This should helps a lot high end raiding, but totally screw up the xp grouping part. Huge heal is the main thing that make a cleric REQUIRED in xp group, rez is just a bonus.<br />
If these spells are a necessity for PoP encounters, they must be flaged and only be used on PoP like manastone only works on pre kunark areas.<br />
<br />
Giving this spell to Shaman is even worse, with AA skills raising, in most xp places, they are yet almost as good as clerics. The combo cleric/melee is history, shaman/melee beeing really more efficient.<br />
I see velk, seb, chardok, HS, mobs hit like pimps compared to equipement/aa skills. It s a cakewalk for a shaman to heal his party, druids can do the job too when they masterise their class.<br />
<br />
About the solo abilities, i have a friend shaman who solo emperor in seb for spells, dragon in WW. Druid friend quading in ME and other places, DCing wolves in WW and fear kiting animals. Sigh, i am not against making them better, i care about cleric bussiness.<br />
They can do so great things yet, but it seems they use just 30% of their class abilities and whine for more.<br />
<br />
Hi, i am a cleric, from 4 to 35, the only thing i saw in grp is chat / book / lifebars. It is definitively not fun. I spent 80% of my playtime sat meding, 18% on boats or runing across zones. Now, i reached my goal, i am a perfect healing/buffing skilled machine with great equipement, raiding big mobs for fun. I didnt chose druid nor shaman. I chose cleric, because i knew what my goal was. I sacrified a lot of playability to reach this goal within joy and pain. <br />
<br />
My solo abilities is narrowed to rare undeads spots. In the grey, while i m root/doting 3 mobs, i see a druid quading them twice faster than me. Cleric soloing is possible, but not as efficient as party xp by far. <br />
I have a 21/22 hammer (woo) miss, miss, miss, parry, miss, 2, miss, dodge, 92 (/shout CLERIC POWAH), miss riposte 170 dmg (ouch), attack off, sit down, sit up, casting judgement for 27dmg (grumble at least i didnt took agro), sit down...<br />
Dont talk to me about cleric melee, there are rare low ac mobs meleable by clerics with weapons that only 1% have, and domage output is not even as good as a right-click druid or shaman dot items. Nukes and offensive spells, beeing magic based, are almost always resisted or partially in the best cases.<br />
<br />
Please stop the twisted example, like no clerics but druids in seb, velk preventing melee to xp kill.<br />
<br />
1. more druids than clerics, because they are more attractive<br />
2. more druids than clerics, because they level fast and easily<br />
3. more druids than clerics in seb, maybe because cleric have to pay 50 to 100pp for an evac to EJ to go to seb<br />
4. a shaman or a druid can keep alive a group if he is skilled<br />
5. lot of melee use to solo too much since luclin AA<br />
<br />
If this spells goes live, they must have a counterpart like only allowed on PoP, or use a reagent like bane nuke / runes. Raid fund will cover cost of reagents and in xp group they will be rarely used.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Baikhal</div><div class="date">08-29-2002, 02:51 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Now druids are also abble to kill weak WW dragon<br />

http://pub13.ezboard.com/fthedruidsgrovegeneral.showMessage?topicID=28333.topic<br />
<br />
This is the true power of a druid who masterise his class.<br />
<br />
What druids said ?<br />
Their skills sucks, their nukes are crapy, they cant find groups ... They really need that Cheal to solo dragon with a DCed pet more easily.</div></div><hr />

Someone needs to ensure that Rich sees this.   They did after all say they were going to make us equal to druids in soloing ability.     /em licks his lips in anticipation of soling a dragon.<br />
<br />
&quot;All priests should offer a similar level of value in solo, group, and raid situations, and they won't be considered balanced until this is true.&quot; Rich Waters</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hakken</div><div class="date">08-29-2002, 10:00 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE<br />
<br />
someone get the information from the above post to Rich so he can see what level of soloing we should be at to equal things out.  We should be able to solo dragons.   Heck druids and shaman can do it.  According to his own words<br />
<br />
&quot;All priests should offer a similar level of value in solo, group, and raid situations, and they won't be considered balanced until this is true.&quot; Rich Waters<br />
<br />
therefore if they are equalling the exp groups and raids, then we should have this power.    Now just try to tell me you dont want soloing ability when you can kill dragons with it.</div></div><hr />
