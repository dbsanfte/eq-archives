I don't want to see Gordon fired as Lum does. I do respect his ability to be a PR guy. But who trusts Gordon anymore?

Take the following that directly affects us...
 [QUOTE][b]Because the classes aren't designed to be equal, but to be balanced. If they were equal they would be interchangable in many cases. As it is designed, you must often make a choice with what class you want to be near. If you are going up against something with really strong poison, you certainly want clerics around. For disease, you'll probably want to add a shaman. If you are looking for something a little more general purpose, there's the druid, with respectable DD, DOTs, healing, buffs, and ports. [/b][/QUOTE]

Ok, this exemplifies why Gordon is a poor person to deal with. The role of the cleric is to heal and cure party members. We are given tools to do this. But there isn't a good reason why we should be denied one of the best cures in the game. We're not asking for something imbalancing, we're simply being asked for a tool to do our designated job. It's not like we're anywhere near as versatile as shamen or druids. No DoTs, snares, pets, SoW... what's it gonna kill them to give it to us? I mean I don't think people are gonna go "Darn, we really need a shaman to cure this disease in one shot because those clerics suck at it". What interchangability? Shamen are unique enough as it is. They don't need to usurp our role as primary healers and curers.

Yet Gordon has shot us down again. And this is a minor issue for us (just chain counteract disease). Rangers need major work and monks need their AC raised. Yet Gordon has deemed them closed. 

And the new Whineplay doesn't help like we thought. Yes, there is very little in the way of flaming personally now but Verant knows who you are and if you say something they don't like BAM there goes your account. They can do it. It's their world.

What we need is more interaction with the people who really do work on this stuff. I love the inclusion of Rowyl. He's easy to deal with and gives straightforward answers. He is what CS Repping is about. I'd love to talk to the Live team about stuff. Yes, it will make their lives busier but if Verant really cares about their customers taking the extra time will pay off.

If you don't think that's a good idea consider the following... Sunmoon, from the EQ Rangers site, went to the most recent EQ gathering and talked to some people directly about ranger issues. They hadn't heard any of them from Gordon. It really leaves me to wonder sometimes just how many posts die in Gordon's office (like our recent issue).

The bottom line is I'm a programmer and when customers have a problem with my programs the last person they want to talk to is a PR guy. They wanna tell me what's wrong directly and know it's being fixed.

Verant needs to cut out the middle man here. Especially if they want to keep customers in the future... I know I won't buy SWOL if they have all stuff like Whineplay still routed through Gordon Wrinn.

My 2cp...
