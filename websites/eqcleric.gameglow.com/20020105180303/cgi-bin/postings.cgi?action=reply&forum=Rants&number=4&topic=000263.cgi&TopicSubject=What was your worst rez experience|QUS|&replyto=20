<TEXTAREA NAME="ReplyMessage" ROWS=10 COLS=45 WRAP="VIRTUAL">[QUOTE]Originally posted by Corynthia:
[B]Mine happened when i was at lvl 50 i was running through oasis on the way to ferrott to join a fear raid, i get tell from some druid asking for a rez in DL, I tell him i cant since i have a fear raid to join, he says he can pick me up in SRO and port me to ferrott after the rez, and donate for my time(remember this part). I say sure, that could save me time(I had been in EC but no one was available for port there so i decided to leg it hehe).

Well we port over to DL and he starts running towards tunnel, and i ask where the corpse is, he says come to KC. hmm but i run after him to KC and he zones in.. now im beginning to suspect that he didnt tell me the whole story, he asks me to zone into KC which i do and when i zone in, he promptly ports over to EJ, WTF???? then he spills the beans that he has corpse in Kaesora(the druid was lvl 52 or 53) 
well since im stuck here now, i might as well get this over with, so we run to field of bone and zone into Kaesora, there the corpse is.
well i rez him and wait for him to get mana for port and he then ports over to Ferrott.
but in ferrot he says "thx" and disbands and runs away..........I was shocked, to say the least.  at this time i decided to put him on ignore and has always refused to join groups he is in.

that is the definiton of a dr00d.

I get a tell:<P>"Hi, could you please spare a revive at the pool room?"<P>I say I'd be happy to revive, but I'm not familiar with the zone ~ if he'd drag it to me, I'd be happy to.<P>He pulls the body to me, and I take a look.  Now, I'd seen this dead person about 15 minutes before this do /ooc Sorry!!  right before a train of kobolds smashed me flat.  I'd seen an iksar monk run by right before; this corpse was an iksar monk, same name.  I said:<P>/say "Hmm this is the guy who trained me earlier."<P>Nevertheless, being the nice loving cleric that I am, I sent a tell to the dead person and said "Revive incoming," and revived him, since revive is what was asked for.  The person standing there who had brought the body said:<P>"Revive?  Can't you rez?"<P>I said:<P>"Oh, you said revive.  Ok, meming rez, one sec."<P>Sat down to mem my rez, when I hear the revived monk say "REVIVE?"<P>So for the next hour I hear in /ooc all about how I'm a crappy cleric who would only revive someone because I thought they had trained me, and that I had allegedly told the first guy that a revive was all I would give because I was trained.  I was slightly miffed.  Never mind that I had TOLD him it was a revive that was incoming, and that he had clicked "Yes" to a revive; he insisted I had maliciously cost him 2 bubs of exp at level 54.<P>However, after sending a /tell finally to the revived monk, we worked out that his guildmate had asked for the wrong spell unintentionally, and that he had misunderstood me.  I'm not sure how, but he did.  Anyway, that's my worst rez story, and I felt like crap for quite a while that night.

I responded that I wasn't able to help.  Since my roommate was already at the Feerrott druid ring, it took less than 30 seconds to pick him up and port back to Great Divide.  Upon zoning back into Great Divide, I get a tell from the same guy saying, "Well you're not in the same zone anymore."  followed immediately with "THANKS FOR THE HELP A**" (astericks weren't there in the tell).  I got another nasty tell from him which involved 4 letter words.  Out of anger I told him to piss off and then put him on /ignore.  <P>The next day I happened to be ressing one of his guild officer's group in Eastern Wastes and talked to him about the conversation I had with the guy.  The guy was either /guildremoved or left on his own, but a week later when I ran into the guy again, he was guildless.<P>My biggest pet peeve of all was being told by my group, "We don't want your res because you're only 54.  We're going to wait until a 56+ Cleric zones in"  I left the group, ressed myself and haven't returned to the zone as of yet.

I could be waiting for that person I agreed to port fifteen mintues ago to finish his banking four zones away so I can port him!  <P>FYI:  I don't charge for ports, but sometimes I do take people up on their offer if they're shouting a price to the zone.  Not sure where people come up with this idea that druids have lots of items to hand out.

I have had people begging for rez's. I have even had people telling me I was a jerk and more,because I didn't travel 6 zones to rez some total stranger. I have had totally twinked out guys with super items who don't give me a dime for the rez. And of course what I usually get is a thank you , I don't require a donation,but when your as poor as I am, it sure helps. Even a buff is good  <IMG SRC="http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/smile.gif"><P>But my worst experience was when I had just died in burning woods hunting wasps with a druid friend and , I was bound in the Dreadlands. As I was going across a guy from my guild whom I barely knew was asking for a rez. I asked him where his body was and he proceeded to argue with me that I was not high enough level to rez him the 90% rez with my level 51 cleric. <P>Ignoring that I told him I could and found out his body was some where in FV. I zoned over and ran there, not having an invis and barely having a sow , I ran near the city where he told me the body would be. I then messaged him and he told me it was along the river bank heading away from the zone to the lake of Ill omen. Not being terribly familar with the area and a little bit worried, because even the green mobs there seemed able to kick my butt, I went on the hunt for my guildies body. <P>I continued the search with the /corpse button along the area he said his body was, it took me about 30 minutes to figure out that this guy knew the zone less then I did. I was already into the quest to resurrect him so I was determined to get him. I msged the guild , no one would respond to help this person. I was shocked no one would come help the cleric, who had rezzed their arses and healed them. But I continued to search.<P>Then I was struck down by one of these green mobs and killed. I then went back to my bind point and had to make my way back to the FV zone with no items on me. I was running to the zone and I got lagged out by the trees (which often happens to me) and I was killed.<P> I had to find a friendly bard with nothing to do to point me to my body. She did and I followed her. She showed me to my body in time for me to get beat on and killed by another mob. Fortunately the kind bardess came to my rescue and brought my two bodies to me to be rezzed at the KC zone. After the rez an enchanter I am in the habit of trading spells with, you know I buff him and he gives me clarity, fixed me up with clarity and invis while his druid friend in his group gave me a sow.<P>I was now invis and sowed so I ran to the fv zone and using the /loc command which I always hit when something starts beating on me I was able to find my body. About 300 feet away in game terms I found the body of the guild mate, I dragged both bodies back to the bridge near fv where the guards were, getting my head beat in dragging it there, but being saved by the guard.<P>Both bodies were safe, so now I contacted the other person and he was afk so I rezzed myself. Then I rezed him. After I rezzed him, he msged the guild that he had gotten lvl 54 back and without out a thank you, or do you need a sow (he was a ranger), or a pretended offer for a donation, or not even a thank you for your help guild brother, he camped. <P>I was a little disgruntled, and then went to the bank in F.V. and got me a sow potion and invis potion and then had made it back to where my body was in the Burning Woods, I rezed myself and had lost some exp, because I had died once on my own ,but 3 times in helping my guild mate. It was late at night so I camped.<P>I logged out and came back on to have a message from a guildy asking me why I was a jerk and didn't rez the named person from the night before. Of course I was very confused and talked to the guildy and then found out that the named person quit because no one in the guild had helped him. He mentioned my name and the person messaging me assumed it was me who didn't help. However, it was soon realized that I was the only one who helped the person.<P>This was all for naught though because , later I went on a Vox raid, we killed vox and the gm's shortly after respawned it, and this lead to confusion that extended a rift between some persons and the guild lost most of it's higher level persons, while I just followed a friend of mine, who left and went to another guild. <P>I would have to say thats my worst rez experience, because it lead to my most deaths and the strangest reprecussions afterwards.<P>But i'm sure there are many clerics with worse rez experiences out there.<BR></FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#f7f7f7"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Taishar Malkier</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Hmmmm....as a matter of principle, unless i know them, they are in zone, or they offer a lot of bling bling i refuse rez request straight out.<P>My worst exp with ppl asking for rezes was this:<P>"Paying 5pp for 50% rez, 10pp for 90% rez, 20pp for 96% 5 zones away"<P>Leveling to 56 on a cleric, w0w its worth it so i can get a whole 20pp for a rez.  It's an insult.  Free would be better.</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#dedfdf"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Soulweaver</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">My worst and also my best res experience was in hate.<P>I dont know why but I always make my break in, I have never once in all my 53 levels failed to make it to SS. Anyway my guild did its first solo hate raid way back in the mists of time, and I did break in and got to SS. However bar one feigned monk I was the only player to actually make it to SS. Shortly after the monk died too. So it was me alone, and being a poor guild back then we had very few hate stones. So I decided to do some CR myself  <IMG SRC="http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/smile.gif">After dragging several corpses to SS and preparing to res, someone logged from another guild logged in and trained me and my recently res'ed bard.<P>Splat. Dead, so now its naked break in to hate, nothing but a summoned hammer and 10copper on me, *zoop* last hate stone gone, tension is very very high ;D Once more I was the only one to make it and began the task of recovering more corpses and ressing. I got trained again but luckily I had ressed enough to handle it and we made it. The ressing some 25 corpses really sucked, but the buzz of doing the intitial lone CR in a fully stacked hate, with no FD or even invis was intense.<P>Another bad one was someone who asked me to run from WC to CT to res him. Now I find it hard to say no to ppl, and after 5 minutes of me saying I couldnt really do it, I buckled to the harrassment and my cleric nature took over. I almost never charge for ressing. However I like ppl to offer (so I can say no anyway). If however I run many zones I will never turn down a donation.<P>So Im offered 100pp which I feel is more a token payment as I say its not the money its the principal of the thing.<P>I run to CT, no sow or jboots, took me about 20 or 30 mins if I remember right and when I arrive it turns out they need a CR too. So I CR their corpses from the underground part solo, place with all the walk ways, and res not 1 but 3 of them, by now my time is getting well over an hour wasted. They all say how great I am etc, but once ressed they just went silent and all 3 of them logged, not even 1cp offered. I was quite peturbed that someone could be so dishonest and abuse someones kind nature like that, promising donations but making non. <P>However I wasnt that kind, they conned the wrong guy, being a guildleader I could ensure they never got a res from my guild ever again  <IMG SRC="http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/wink.gif">and a few of our alliances heard about them too  <IMG SRC="http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/wink.gif"> What goes around comes around......<P>Muahahaha<P></FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#f7f7f7"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Bolgor</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Refferring to the person who said they mostly play a non-cleric and sometimes go without any res... I cannot recall a single time when I died with one of my non-cleric alts and looked for a res. With my non-cleric alts I eat xp deaths for breakfast. I know what its like to be dragged out of a group and across 3 zones to do a res, and I never want to put anyone thru that. XP can be hunted if lost. An hour of running zoning and ressing can never be returned.<P>Personally as much as i hate doing those out of the way resses, I try to do them as often as possible. Alot of cleric I know go /roleplay or /anon to avoid being botherred. Since I was 30, I have never hidden my cleric tag except by acident once or twice. I made all those levels to be able to do resses, and now that I'm 56... rezzing is what defines my class.<P>Sometimes people are ungrateful and I don't get a donation or a get the infamous, 12pp 48gp 100sp and a "Sorry, thats all I got" to which I cancel the trade and let them keep it. When people "forget" to donate I ask them if they were planning to, and if they say they didn't then I just remember not to res them next time. <P>On the other hand there are some donations I've got for doing resses I'd never want to have missed. I got a Crystalline Eye, 2 forest loops, 2 diamonds, 4 spells, and how many hundreds of plat I couldn't count. When some people profusely thank me for a res, I just answer with, "Its my job." <P>And it is... but you have to remember,<P>Its a job I expect to be paid to do.</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#dedfdf"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Numinata</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Well, my worst res experience happened a while back and hasn't been repeated since, thank Brell.<P>I have a time put aside, usually on two or three days out of a ten day playing stretch, when I do what I call "res patrol".  During those days, I usually will play for six to eight hours doing nothing but running around to zones and offering free rezzes and buffs.<P>Well, on one of those days, around 1am or so, I was running around in Warslik Woods trying to find a mouldering halfling's corpse when I recieved a tell, "Hi. Could u plz rez me in the Hole? I died and lost 57. I can port u 2 Toxx and pay u money."  I did a /who and got 56 druid.  Polite enough request, even in d00dsp33k, and he wasn't /anon, so I said sure.  The distance didn't really matter, as my whole day was being devoted to charity, anyway.  At about that time, I finally found the halfling and ressed him.  I told the druid to meet me at Skyfire and I'd be there in a little bit.<P>On the way, I ran into two ressees in OT who knew that that day was my charity day and they asked me to res.  I agreed, telling the druid I was having a bit of a hold-up.  While I was ressing the two at the ramp, druid boy starts getting impatient.  "I say Id pay u. Why u rez others when I say I pay u??"  I replied that his offer didn't make much of a difference, because I don't charge or accept donations when I'm on "res patrol".  By then, I had finished with the two resses and was back on my way to the Skyfire zone. I got several "R u coming yet?"s, but opted to ignore them.  <P>I bound at Skyfire/OT zone and proceeded to run along the wall toward the port spot. . .straight into the loving arms of a necro-led train of faeries and devourers.  All my buffs went bye-bye as I (stupidly) attempted to heal the necro.  We leapfrogged back to the SF/OT zone, with me running ahead and healing as he came slowly forward, dragging his train. The necro made it. . .I, sadly, did not.  Two devourers had Numi for lunch.<P>There I am, repopped at zone and medding for my res when I get the tell, "R u coming yet??"  I inform the druid that I was killed, myself, and am waiting to res my corpse.  He, being an entirely sympathetic person, tells me, "WTF?  How u die here?  No one I know die in SF!"  I tell him to please be patient and I'll be there shortly.  He agrees, with a polite ". . ."<P>Okay! Res is done and I'm back on track!  I run back along the wall (keeping an eye out for necros, this time) and make it to the port area with no snags. He's waiting for me and we group up for the port. While he's casting it, I get this pearl of wisdom, "Next time u run thru SF, make sure ur buffed.  Mabee then ull live."  I sigh and we port away.<P>When we arrive in Toxxulia, he tells me, "U go on. KOS in Paineel.  My corpse at is zone in Hole."  I opted not to mention that all good races are KOS in Paineel and disbanded.  I took off to the destination and arrived, unKOSed, at the Hole.<P>When I entered, did a /who and saw that I was the only one there.  I started to swim for the shore and got a res request from an old guildmate who had died in SolB. I told her I'd be there as quickly as I could, and finished my swim to the shore.  When I hopped up. . .big surprise.  No druid corpse.  I sent him a tell asking where he had died.  He tells me, "Near the big rock."  I asked him to clarify, hoping that they had added a big rock near zone-in since the last patch. Happy to oblige me, he answers, "Near the big rock in front of tower."  I begin to cry.<P>Now, let me say that I am certainly not one to turn down a challenge.  One of the reasons that I've been coddling this druid guy is that, with all of his rudeness, it's a challenge in itself.  But, running down and pulling his corpse is going to hurt.  I tell him I need a few minutes to think. He tells me, "Hurry plz, I only have a few minutes left."  I swim outside to bind and recharge JBoots, then swim back in and begin to buff.  I ask the druid to consent me.  By the time I'm finished, my buff row looks like a canary.  I med until I'm at 70%, take a deep breath and RUN my widdle legs off.<P>Amazingly, the train doesn't catch up to me until I'm at the rock itself and targeting his corpse.  But WOW, does it catch up to me.  I'm down to 3 bubs of health before I can get off my DA.  Toting my package back, I run for the zone.  In the main hall, my DA wears off and I'm down to 1 bub before I can DB.  By the time that wears off, however, I have zoned.  I tell him I have to wait for the train to return to its spawn spots and he tells me, "U not have to train! Just sneak and ur gnome so wont get hurt." I make a mental note to ask him what neat drugs he's taking, then zone back in.<P>Yaay! I've done it! Train is gone and corpse is at shore. I send him a tell asking if he's ready for a res (I always do this, afk experiences have taught me:P).  He tells me, "WTF do u think???" Brell gives me the patience not to mem revive, so I cast resurrection.  When he pops and I heal him, he stands and proceeds to open a trade window with 10pp in it.  I cancel it and tell him that I don't accept donations.  I begin to get spammed with the trade window.  He won't give up.  I finally acquiesce and take the damned 10pp. . .I can always spend it on a peridot, I think.  <P>He is now medding and I have another res to do, so I humbly ask for a port to Lavastorm, as there is another in need.<P>He tells me, "Sure, for 10pp." I take a moment to walk away from the keyboard and bash my head against a hard object.  I return and say, "Will you not just port me for free? I just went through an awful lot to help you."  He says, "Yes, but u charge me for res. I charge u for port."  I say, "Why are you being mean?"  He stands up, gives me a rude gesture, and ports away.<P>Luckily, my old guildmate had a druid who could do the port to Lava, so she wasn't in trouble.  I had plenty of time at the port circle to contemplate the idiots that roam Norrath.<P>Numi<BR>56 gnomie templarette<P>P.S.
