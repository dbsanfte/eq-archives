How elite!) in Greater Faydark at the orc hill near Kelethin.<P>I was kind enough to get some buffs from a high level druid on my brave jobaber, and I started soloing a few orc centurions.<P>Now I must admit, the low level game is a whole new bag for me, I feel like GFay might as well be outer space. I had Alli at that level, umm.. over two years ago, so it seems like forever, heh.<P>First off, I was subjected to three idiots using /shout to argue over if Tinkerer's Bag's were 8 slot or 10 slot. In shout, no less. I offered my (I thought) my rather definitive opinion as my cleric has quite a few tinks bags now, and got a nice "STFU noob" in shout back at me.<P>Oh joy.<P>Next, I had to listen to some people shouting how "Dvinn was at the CB zone, RAPING everyone." There ensued an INCREDIBLY long /shout and /ooc match, over if it was ok to use words like "rape" to describe a monster beating you up. <P>While all this was going on, some lvl 7 Ranger is constanly KS'ing my orcs. No /tells, no "Pardon me, did you have this?" He would just go to whatever mob I was alreday fighting, and begin hacking on it until he KS'ed it. He did this no less than 5 times.<P>Finally, I had had enough.<P>I had to bring Alliliel on to teach our little Ranger friend how to get along and play well with others. Needless to say, he shortly logged. It's amazing how far you can fear an orc. Did you know that they never come back?<P>Blearg! I don't think I'll ever try to level another character ever again, I just can't take it.<P>------------------<BR><B>Alliliel Archfalcon</B><BR>Cleric of Tunare<BR><A HREF="http://www.kriegeronline.com" TARGET=_blank>Krieger</A><BR>Tunare Server is my uber-guild</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#f7f7f7"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">JaigeTZ</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">I think you have a short temper, but I also think your a fewl for lvling in Gfay  <IMG SRC="http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/wink.gif"><P>------------------<BR><B>Jaige</B><BR>52 Cleric of Innoruuk<BR><A HREF="http://pub19.ezboard.com/bedarkie" TARGET=_blank>Eternal Darkness</A><BR>Tallon Zek</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#dedfdf"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Nemean</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">S'pose a cuppla things to note about your story,<P>a)  GFay has always been infested by idiots and beggars.  It seems like every 13 year old obnoxious kid wants to play an elf for some reason.  I was in GFay the other night for the first time in probably 3 RL months, and I fled after 20 minutes - it was just so annoying.  Kinda makes me want to go hunt in PoG just so I can't go back there...<P>b)  The L7 ranger may have been a real newbie, I'm pretty sure back when I was hunting orc hill (bout 2 years ago too) that KSing was common - but noone really thought anything of it coz the idea of 'owning' a mob didn't really occur to anyone.  Course, that doesn't excuse the ignoring of your tells...<P>So that an a) you aint really old and grumpy, and b) you are old and grumpy.

This isn't to say that all types of that class/race are bad, just the large majority of the ones i've met. For me there are 2 types of characters that i just can't seem to get along with, woodelf druids who use the woodelf with the blonde hair, and any gnomish caster. I don't know what it is but those people are ALWAYS pricks to me. But there are also certain class/races that I always seem to get along with and the main one is barbarians. Those people are just so cool. Maybe it's my server or maybe I just meet the cool ones but go to halas, you will love it. stay away from Faymart unless you want to buy or sell things and when camping an item ALWAYS cast see the invis cause there is some blonde woodelf just waitin to KS ya in the end  <IMG SRC="http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/mad.gif"></FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#f7f7f7"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Daynan</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">I had a similar experience in GFay this week.

Amazing how a big scary dark dungy can be fun and exciting with so few morons in it!  <P>I have recently been toying with a rogue twinky.  Now, since she is all alone in the world (I only play her when my fiance is busy), I find myself joining newbie groups.  Groups where group members say "Sit in the derv camp so I dont have to pull 20 steps out of it." or "Taunting doesnt do anything!

Or make it a point to always group with twinks.  They hopefully know the game.<P>I find I am much more liberal with the /ignore key while listening to the newbies.<BR>Oh and in Greater Shoutdark I always always always turn off /ooc and /shout.

I had to completely recycle my ignore list, and finally had to turn off both /shout and /ooc; the stupid newbie spam was just awful.<P>Once I was high enough for Kurn's Tower I fled there and stayed until 20.  I then had solo bliss (I usually owned the entire zone) until I hit level 36.  At 36 I went to the Lake of Ill Omen, otherwise known as Oasis II.  The Bloodgills were tremendous XP, but the newbie spam was worse than the Field of Bone (and that was saying something).  Had to turn off /ooc and /shout.<P>The only time I really get tempted to turn off the channels now is when I go to Sebilis.  The annoying people have caught up to me again it seems.

If you want to do ANYTHING besides auction you have to turn off pretty much everything.<P>There's a problem with GF... it's a newbie zone for not one but 2 races, both of which are quite popular. And it's no different on CT. Having started a HE and a WE character, I know it's no picnic. I remember when I was working my druid up at orc hill (next to Keletin). EVERYONE congregates there. And for some odd reason, twinks abound there. My own druid was twinked a bit but nowhere near as bad as some. I went head to head with a level 8 WE warrior in full bronze wielding a YK. I was beating an orc in front of one of the isolated tents in the valley and he came up and began to bang away. Of course, he was a fool to think a melee could KS a caster. I laid in with nukes and got the kill and I chewed him out for his blatant attempt to KS and was met with "I was here first". Whatever.<P>My suggestion to you and anyone else thinking of making a light elf twink... move somewhere else. In your case, Ali, I'd move to Tox. Most of the serious twinks go to Qeynos to level up leaving mostly true newbies. There's TONS of room, lots to kill and as an extra bonus for your mage you have the benefit of the Erudin library to buy some of the harder to find mage spells (Heatstone, weapon summons, waterstone, etc).<P>One out of level 9 stuff, head to Steamfont near the mino caves. EVERYTHING is blue and soloing is a snap and you can sail to 15 or so. Then hit Unrest a bit or Lake Omen to work up to 30 (Lake not too bad on CT since it's wide open and I find my mage can solo or group at will). Be warned that Unrest has a level gap between 17 and 20 where yard trash greens but the house is still red.<P>In short, no, Alliliel, you're not short tempered, you just found a lot of short (brained) people  <IMG SRC="http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/wink.gif"><P>------------------<BR>Boanerges Thundercry<BR>Erudite Templar of Prexus<BR>Cohort Chalybeius<BR>Cazic Thule Server</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#dedfdf"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Alliliel</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">It figures that an Erudite would pitch Toxx forest!<P>LOL<P>------------------<BR><B>Alliliel Archfalcon</B><BR>Cleric of Tunare<BR><A HREF="http://www.kriegeronline.com" TARGET=_blank>Krieger</A><BR>57 Seasons of Loyal Service to Tunare</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#f7f7f7"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">MingDeathbane-Xegony</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">"Cleric crankiness is directly and exponentially proportional to the cleric's level  It's just part of being a cleric.

When all you do is play with guildmates alot you start to become elitist. Playing around with all the twits dorks and dewds can give you some perspective.</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#f7f7f7"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Tommara</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial"> <BLOCKQUOTE><font size="1" face="Verdana, Arial">quote:</font><HR>Originally posted by Zygote:<BR><B><BR>When all you do is play with guildmates alot you start to become elitist.

I did the dungeons of the old world and we always had groups in there.  Now it is abandoned.  I also remember going to rathe mountains and waiting on lists for the Hill giants and troll guards.  Well now it is nonexistant.  There is never anyone in this zone at the troll guards and I remember they were easy good xp.  The Lake of Ill Omen and Overthere are just super crowded now.  I guess it is the loot or maybe better experience.  I really am not sure about which.  Oasis is still the same old oasis on my server and I had to get out of there with my twink sk.  But now at 22 it is getting harder to get a group except at the spires in south karana.  I never fought in lake of ill omen or overthere because most of my leveling was up to 35 before kunark came out. Most new ones I talk to tell me that places such as paw and mistmoor are just too hard.  Is everyone just scared of dieing? Another question since I have not been playing much since I hit 49, is on the new ones that reach the high levels outdoors.  Do they know their skills good like some of the old gamers that came up before kunark?  Not sure if many older players still do pickup groups so this might be hard to answer.</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#f7f7f7"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Talura cwn'Zeylon</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Ugh, gfay is still the sale spot back home huh?  <IMG SRC="http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/frown.gif"> I hated that...really was hard to get there with a dark elf cleric. It's North FP on Drinal...just as bad, amazing how many people don't know how to get to the bard or paladin guild or the bank. /sigh.<BR>As for crotchety? Nope...you want crotchety, come visit a group I'm healing for sometime. I average 2 or 3 tells an hour from friends in the group (when they are anyway) who say that I'm cranky. Stupid warriors using wurmslayer...you want stamina, stop using the damn piece of junk. Paladins in WW form, and using wurmslayer...hello? Can you say proc city? Do me a favor...pick up your WS and click on the "destroy" button. Rogues using WS! ARGH!!! (Hehe, just kidding on that one...now that one would set me off.)<BR>Have been grouping in CoM playing my rogue, and can quite easily pull agro from a paladin with 10 levels on me if I don't use evade. (He is using WS+some shield...looks like a Cracked Darkwood, dunno...and I've got a bone razor and burning needle of poo...not really uberweapons, considering how highly touted the WS is.) Does nobody understand the concept of agro management?</FONT></TD></TR></TABLE>
