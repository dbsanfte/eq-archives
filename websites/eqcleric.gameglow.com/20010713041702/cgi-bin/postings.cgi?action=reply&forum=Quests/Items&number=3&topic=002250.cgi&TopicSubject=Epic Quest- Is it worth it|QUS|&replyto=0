<TEXTAREA NAME="ReplyMessage" ROWS=10 COLS=45 WRAP="VIRTUAL">[QUOTE]Originally posted by Cali:
[B][b]I would like your opinions on weather or not trying to complete the epic quest is worth it.
[/b]

Background: I am in a small, unuber guild, involved in several alliances with similar guilds.  We do have 3 friendships with larger guilds but I hate feeling like we are tagging along.  Now no cleric in our little alliance have an epic.  In fact aside from one fellow who has retired his cleric, I am the highest level cleric in my guild.  I also end up being the ONLY cleric on guild romps.

I would want it simply to reduce down time and assist all guildmates in general.  I dont care about stats or status simply the effect.  (It could be any type of item in fact, just not a blasted ugly helm! for all I care.)

I am also personally alergic to long boring solo camps.  So I will drag people down with me, mainly my fiance (57 epic equiped shaman).

Now, all things considered, is it worth it to even try?

Thanks, I appriciate your input.

One raid I went on not too long ago in Skyshrine I had to rezz entire raid party of 24 peeps - what a pain in the ass for a cleric without a stick.

We have very very few people above 52 even, though a large group is level up from 40s now.<P>Will it be possible or will I become one of the hundreds of "Ragefire Ready" clerics with a pearl collecting dust?<P>Thanks,<BR>~Cali</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#dedfdf"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Zifnab</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">You won't even get to the pearl.<P>Ixblat and Chardok are both more difficult that Zordak.<BR></FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#f7f7f7"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Resurrector</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Ok, a couple of things you should know.<P><BR>1. The cleric epic will make a HUGE difference to you and your guild if you do multiple group raids. Being able to res people during battle for no mana has made a HUGE difference for me and my guild.<P>2. Chardok sucks, and the lag is horrible. If the highest person in your guild is 52 the odds of you getting past this part are very slim. However, what you can do is tag along on other guilds raids and help them out. Go a few times and you should be able to get the note.<P>3. Ixblat, what a wuss. This guy is EASY. We killed him 6 times in a row in about a hour. The trick to him is tash, a level 60 shaman for slow, and a main tank with multiple clerics healing him. Fight him at the zone to skyfire.<P>4. The WORST part of the entire quest is Zordak. My recomendation is that you have a FD monk/necro/shadow knight and camp him here. Don't worry if you don't get Zordak right away. Be there and help out others that WILL beat you to the spawn. Helping them out will be appreciated and they'll probably return the favor. If you do get lucky and get the spawn solo make sure you have enough people to take him down. Basically if you have fought vox you'll know what you need.<P>In closing, I really can't emphasise how much of a difference my epic made for our guild (I'm the only cleric in our guild with an epic). It's made such a huge difference.<P>Don't give up, never surrender. It may take you a while but don't sweat that.<P>The one really important thing is don't sit down in Zordak's lair for 4 months like I did.

But it has taken me since the quest was first released to get the King in Chardok... that's what 6 months or more?

The stats are fantastic and the ability to save your guild or raid after a wipeout someplace is really invaluable.    With the 25 wisdom on the epic, I can now wear pretty much full resist gear and still have 200 wisdom... and the epic itself has +10 to all resists.

I didn't have a guild that would sit there with me in the lair for days on end.  I'm a bit envious of those people that do.
