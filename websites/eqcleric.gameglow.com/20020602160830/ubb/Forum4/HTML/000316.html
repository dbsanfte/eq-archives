</FONT><HR>Let me bitch about another issue: guild names.<P>A LONG time ago I (along with a few RL friends) was invited to join a guild of very nice people: The Transcendents.  They were a mix of younger and older people, casual and harcode, but all nice people.  Things were fine for a year and a half, but when we migrated from EQ to AO some differences of opinion came up, and a subset of us (mainly those of us who played using Battlefield Commander, more commonly known as BCom) decided to split off and form our own guild.<P>So, in AO and DAoC we have our own guild, named B Company.  B Company was a name coined when someone in the guild was bitching about play styles, namely the play style of those of us using BCom versus those not.  According to him, we seemed a little more coordinated (not having to type in the heat of battle helps a bit imo, but we also played together a lot and that made a difference).  So the guild thereafter referred to the subset of us that used BCom 24x7 as B Company when they were talking (or bitching) about us.  So naturally when we split.....<P>Why the long preamble?  I'll tell you: on a server that has guilds named Deathrow, Kill, and The Powers That Be some $#*($# at Verant decided B Company "doesn't fit the theme of Norrath."  WHAT!?!?!  Deathrow is acceptable but B Company isn't?!?!?  What a shmuck.  I have to run around the #$($#)$ server looking at Brittani Spears (high level player mind you, ran into "her" in Cazic), but I can't have a B Company tag over my head.<P>Eventually I'll get to talk to a GM about this and possibly convince him to accept it, but this really hacks me off.  Sure, we "could" come up with another name, but we don't want to.  And I'll be damned if I'm going to worry about thinking up a more "appropriate" name when I'm on a server with Deathrow, Kill, Britanni Spears, and Lillinae HasPoopInMyPants (I may have the first name wrong, but I ran into THAT player for months around SolB).<P>Give us our name damnit!<P>Rayne</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#f7f7f7">

</FONT><HR>A friend convinced me to start a char on her server for a while some time ago.  She was on Bristlebane.  I know I saw some odd guildnames there, but the only one I remember was Ill Tempered Sea Bass.  Now, I get the reference, and it is mildly amusing, but I dont see how this is closer to the 'vision' than B Company.  Thats just silly. Hopefully your server gm was just having a bad day and will let you have your name. <P>------------------<BR>Zzule D`Aemon<BR>High Priestess of Innoruuk<BR><I>Disciple of Hate</I><BR>Rallos Zek</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#dedfdf">

</FONT><HR>Names in EQ.. one of my favorite topics<BR>/rant on<P>on rodcet there is/was a Divine Froggies.  I'm not sure if they are still around but they were around for a long time.  Can't think of any other odd names on RN though.<P>But I know what you mean.<P>My last name since about oh september 99 was Stronginthearm.<P>Well one PoG raid, probably a little less then a year ago, the whole server crashed and the server GM came out to do resses and removed my name for being a phrase.  I would have argued on the spot, but a friend was playing my character at the time as I had to run out for a few.<P>So I petition, argueing that as the rules state my name was in violation, but it should be covered by the grandfather policy.  I'm told by the guide that the server GM has final say on what gets grandfathered and since she is the one who removed my name I'm basically SoL.<P>About a month later VI changes the policy to ENCOURAGE descriptive last names that can be phrases.<P>So I petition to have it restored.  I am told that I can not have "Stronginthearm" back, some explanation was given that I still don't understand.  Instead we settle on "Strongarm"  Which actually still is in violation of VI policy since it is the last name of an NPC but oh well.<P>VI has long pissed me off with names.  My names gets stripped when I daily see names like "Iseepanties", "Cutefatfat", or "Lovetaeatcornbread" wtf?  I'm not don't have anything against these players (except maybe Iseepanties) but my name gets stripped and theirs got by?<P>There used to be a rogue on RN named Aiken T'steal.  (say it slowly.. aching to steal).  He got sick of the name cause it made him even less desirable in a group (this was a bit after Kunark release when very few people liked rogues in their group) and he petitioned his own name.<BR>Four times.  Finally after argueing with the 4th guide that his name was in fact in violation of naming policy the guide removed his last name.  The previous three had refused to do it saying it wasn't a voilation and they weren't supposed to remove a name that wasn't in violation.<P>One night last summer a friend and I decided to see what names we could get through for new characters.<BR>Names that were accepted:<BR>Benitomousillini<BR>Chairmanmao<BR>Maotsetsung<BR>Josephstalin<BR>Hermangoering<BR>(none of these characters were ever actually played of course)<P>Names that were not accepted:<BR>Mayormccheese<BR>Hamburgler<P>We got bored after that.  Now supposedly all names are checked against various filters, if they pass they are approved by a live person (although I have a feeling it's rare that someone is approving new names)  But if someone was, they new who Mayor McCheese was but none of those others?<P>anyway I think I'm done<P>/rant off<P>Kaharz Stronginthearm<BR>54th level cleric of Brell<BR>Rodcet Nife<BR>Forsaken<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#f7f7f7">

</FONT><HR> <BLOCKQUOTE><font size="1" face="Verdana, Arial">quote:</font><HR>Originally posted by Serina Moonprism Elay:<BR><B>So as you see I think your gm is on crack!<BR></B><HR></BLOCKQUOTE><P>Unless there's been a recent change here, server GM's don't approve guild names.  That's done by a centralized guild CS group.  So, even if you're lucky enough to be able to talk to a GM about it, the answer will probably just be email eqguilds@soe.sony.com (think that's the address).  That said, I can't see any reason B Company isn't an acceptable name.  Sounds like a mercenary company, so I'd think it was actually very in keeping with a middle ages/fantasy world.<P>As for player names, these ARE controlled at the server level.  Basically, you will get any name you choose unless: A) There is a guide/GM online and they reject it -OR- B) The name is in the filter (because somebody has already used it and had it taken away).  If you see a name that bothers you, petition it.  It's possible that the guides on your server are idiots and didn't know that Imdapimpdaddy violated the naming policy they're supposed to enforce, but more than likely he got to level 58 with that name because nobody ever petitioned it.  Maybe I've just been lucky.  In 3 years of playing I've only petitioned 4 times and got the help/answer I was looking for on all but 1 (a request to remove my surname).<P>------------------<BR><A HREF="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=125773" TARGET=_blank>Grogs</A><BR>44 Cleric<BR>Tarew Marr</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#dedfdf">

</FONT><HR>Oh, such a fun topic!<P>Back when my Guild was to be created, our proposed name was "Controled Chaos" which got shot down by a GM... why did that piss us off?  What the hell was the difference between an existing Guild "United Chaos" and our proposed name?  "Not original" the GM says.. Not original because United Chaos beat us to it, or not original because you don't even know the Guildnames of your own server... /sigh<P>Some of my favorites include:<BR>Gnomish Liberation Army (no longer)<BR>Gargles Traveling Circus (bunch o funny folk in here)<P>Of course, names slip through the cracks all the time.  At one time I created a Ranger by the name of "Tetra."  At the time, I was drawing a blank for names.. so I came up with Tetra.  Why not?  I keep bookoos of fish and tetras are favorites of mine.  Well, just to "fight the man", I made his last name Hydrocannibinol.  I was well into my 30s before a GM yanked it.  But he was very impressed.. he said he had been trying to track me down for 12days just to catch me online..

</FONT><HR>speaking of bad phrase names..<P>My friend was in Gfay waaaaay back (sometime in 99).  There is a wood elf female newbie toon in shouting "stripping for plat at bank"  He happens to be standing there and sure enough there are a bunch of horny kids handing the toon plat.  My friend looks at the toon's name and starts laughing hysterically and waving me a few others that were there over to his comp.  He shows us the shout, the crowd of onlookers, and then the name.  "Imaman"  He sends Imaman a tell, "You're a guy right?"  He gets a response something like "Yup, it's bad enough these idiots are giving me plat, even worse that they haven't noticed my name spells "I'm a man."<P>Knew a guy that made it to level 8 as Holy****e despite that he was spamming Gfay with shouts most the time.  The GM that finally came asked him to choose a new name.  He suggested "Holycrap" the guide then informed him that his name had actually been petitioned for the "holy" part, not the "****e" part.  Go figure.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#dedfdf">
