<TEXTAREA NAME="ReplyMessage" ROWS=10 COLS=45 WRAP="VIRTUAL">[QUOTE]Originally posted by Salina:
[B]I'm my guild's leader as well..

And actually, if someone sent me that email I would definitely question the person involved, and talk to the person who sent me the email online if possible.

I take that very seriously, though.  My guild has a good reputation as being a group of people who know what they're doing, so something like that would definitely get my attention.

It reminds me of a point several months ago when someone sent me a tell while I was playing my alt.  He asked me who my guild leader was, and I gave him my main character's name (didn't know what it was about at first).  I asked him what was wrong, and he told me that one of my members (and a good friend of mine) had killed him without provocation in the Arena.

After further questioning, it turned out that there had been a GM event and mass slaughter for fun in the Arena.  This guy had been there for another reason, and my friend as well as a few remaining folks who were killing each other for fun had indeed killed him.

I told my friend, who had since logged in another character to log back in and pay the kid what he had paid for the port to get back to his body.

It turned out that my friend didn't really have much to do with the "murder" of this newbie, but I made sure he was happy with being paid back for the port he had to get.

Was it my fault?  No.  Was it something I had the power to fix?  Yes.

His name is Fur** and his fellow member in his guild told me to write his guild leader a letter and tell him what our situation was...Please read it and tell me if I should of sent it: Please be patient with my rambling <P>This is what i wrote him<BR><<Greetings Amar**** and other leaders of Kindred Spirits!<P>	First off, I would like to say, I really like your web page. Well designed.<BR>	<BR>	Back to topic, I spoke with Amar**** on this subject, but I would like to go in further detail. First I would like to introduce myself as Ellana from Preservers of Utopia. I'm a level 19 cleric.  Tonight I was playing with one of your group members, Fur** (level 19 Cleric).  Through the whole time he was playing with us. I had constant tells that consisted of "What's up with this guy?" "What type of cleric is he?" Etc. He constantly whined of not wanting to die and if he lost even a bubble of HP, he lost all senses and did not help anyone, constantly begged for help, and did not help the members who were in danger (run-on sentence I know =P).  I know this part of the complaint may not have much merit to you, but coming from a cleric who rather die then see her members injured, Fur** was a poor example. He healed himself before healing a member that was more badly injured, thus causing more chaos. He tanked instead of watching his fellow group members health. I admit, I was there helping and healing, but one's mana can only go so far.  Continuing on, tonight there was bug in the penthouse and centaurs were able to reach us.....I tried to escape it, thinking one of our members was down there killing it. You're other guild member Cand*** was healing and helping me, while I was getting mauled by 40-60 hits. I kept asking for heals, and I and Cand*** saw Fur** fighting with our tank (not getting attacked), and I died. When I returned. I said "Fur**, maybe I'm just mad right now, but do you even know how to HEAL?" <-----yes it could have been put better, but I had no intention to be mean. As a cleric I had to learn the hard way, I was hoping that I would be his lesson. He claimed that he was trying to heal me and that he healed me 3 times, which all the members agree, that did not happen. Our members names are rek**, ayabro**, and another witness was Ra**. Anyway, As I was going back to my body, there was another centaur on the top aviak city and I asked for help and ran to the group. Fur** did not help either. Cand*** tried her hardest to keep me alive, but unfortunately with no armor on; I had no chance.  When I returned again, I said that I was going to petition, and all the members agreed, except Fur**, he said that he wouldn't. I am sorry, but if he can't take constructive criticism about his cleric from not one, not two, but a full group of people...there is a problem.  He left the group and we all rested and tried to regain any fighting time we had left. That is when I began to speak with Amar****. during this time, I received a tell from someone name Drak***(who is Fur**'s other character) He said "why do you blame Fur** for your death? I said I blame the centaur for my death, I said he could have changed the outcome.  He kept saying that he healed me blah blah, etc. And everyone in the group said that he wasn't, and he wasn't getting hit either, so he could have casted. I told him he needs to improve himself as a cleric.  He kept saying that I was blaming him cause I was angry that I died. Which I was, but I don't blame in vain. I die a lot being a cleric, but not once has been because of the negligence of another.  The conversation continued and I said he was acting like a 14 year old whining to me and he told me to get over my death because I play eq all day and have no life. When in actuality, I play eq 1-3 times a week. I have college and work, so I hold my EQ time  as precious.<BR>This case may not sound like much, but to a group of people in that penthouse in aviak village, this was a terrible night.  Cand*** said it best to the group, when she said Please don't let Fur**'s actions represent my guild.  I am saddened to think that guild that can have someone to admiral as Cand*** can have someone has negligent and selfish as Fur**. I don't know what I want out of this e-mail, or why I even bothered to say anything. I've never said anything like this before. I usually let it be. but this situation disturbed me.<P>I hope that this person learns his lesson and will hopefully learn to help his group. And hopefully someday he will bring pride apon your guild again, because if it wasn't for admiral Cand***, i would never look at the Kindred Spirit the same again.<P>Are you sure you need someone like this in your guild?<P>I'm sorry for the trouble and the lenghty e-mail. I hope this doesn't cause you an trouble, I am just a fellow player that felt wronged as well as one of your own members.>><P>Lengthy huh?  <IMG SRC="http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/smile.gif"><P>I don't know what I should have done. I was upset at his actions and how he handled his cleric. We were happy when I got him to leave. And with my luck. He is reading this post. But my main point of all this, is that some clerics need to learn to put their members ahead of themselves....There are techniques....Root the creature, continue healing members, ect. As a proud cleric. I feel that the group living is the main priority. what do you guys think?<P>Oh well, i think I just needed to see what other clerics would think..<BR>Thanks!<P>Ellana<BR>19th Cleric Of Tarew Marr<P></FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#f7f7f7"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Fiorence</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Ellana,<P>I think you did the right thing. Dying, although no fun, is part of EQ and accepted as such. Dying because of neglicience (sp?) is NOT part of the game as far as I'm concerned. As even a guild mate of this Fur** was ashamed about a guildmate I would guess that the GM of that guild would at least be interested in your story. After all, when all is said and don a player and a guild have only one thing in EQ: REPUTATION. Hard to earn, easy to lose.<P>As to the situation at hand: considering the fact that the group was wondering about this character, you had two courses of action: if you were the leader of the group to disband this shameful excuse for a cleric, or leave the group. Although harsh on the other players, that's probably what I would have done (easy to say from the outside though, I realize that).<P>I have been in a similar situation ,with a 24 cleric in a group in Unrest. No one died, but this cleric told me (a lvl 20 cleric) not to heal until the group was down to a bub or so, because "it is so funny to see them panic" Pardon my French, but WTF????   <IMG SRC="http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/redface.gif"><P>Needless to say I kept to my own judgement, while this character happily nuked away and was comstantly OOM (It's really frustating to try and keep up with Healing if there's someone present with GHeal). I didn't want to leave the group to this guy's devices, but everyone was happy when he left real soon after this remark. (This meant I didn't have to make a decision whether or not to leave, which I was considering)<P>Again: I think you were right in e-mailing the guild, and put him on your no group/no heal/no rez/no nothing list, and put him and his alt on /ignore.<P>I hope you won't run into this type of situation again.<P>Fiorence Knightingale<BR>21 sacraments, Rodcet Nife<p>[This message has been edited by Fiorence (edited 03-29-2000).]</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#dedfdf"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">sobe</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Great Letter,<BR>Sometimes you just get people who don't get it.

In fact, alot of times when i'm in a group i cannot even use my most useful control spells root or stun becuz it gets resisted constantly.  So, it basically reduces me down to one thing...a healing and buffing while avoiding agroing machine.  Also when something agroes on me i feel more like a mage than a fighter defensivly against blue and higher. Maybe some additional AC would help but my mana is precious to me.  Also have been using Stun and Atone successfully to protect the Ench, Wiz, Mag in our group.  I'm not going to call any names but being a cleric is not easy for the aggressive type<P>  Is seems to me that our fellow cleric needs to learn that his time is best spent passively healing, buffing, stunning, atoning so his/her group can pull more, fight longer, and gain exp faster; it will only help him level faster as well.<P>------------------<BR>Arss Rubybone<BR>L44 Dwarven Cleric<BR>Master Fishman<BR>Master Brewer</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#dedfdf"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Ellana Bravehearted</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Ok this kind of stuff happens at lower lvls,  As a lvl 51 cleric, and playing my bard lvl 22 I run into this alot between clerics and myself.

I know exactly what you are talking about here cause i ran into the same issue with my bard and a cleric in the PH.  He was doing the same thing that this cleric was doing.  SO what did i do, i let his A** die, as i got away cause he let me die 2 times, even after all the talking I did.  Right after he died he logged. As a cleric we are the back bone to any group, and people can say that this isnt true.

As I was doing CR the paladin ran off. We saw his health going down but he hadn't made it back to the group. We all sat around asking in group where he was to try and help. He didn't respond. We continued to watch his health decrease and then suddenly shoot back to full. He had LoH up and he sat on it and let me die. He killed whatever he was fighting and we all got exp (small consolation for the half bubble I'd just lost) and he returned. He then grumbled something about how he forgot he was grouped and that he wasted all the exp on us.<P>I degrouped him (after asking all the other members in tells if they didn't have a problem with that. They didn't).<P>The bottom line is that there are incompetent people out there and the only way they will ever learn is the hard way.

I don't quite know what he expected me to do - tell my guildmate "I'm ordering you to leave the zone!"?  <P>   And yes, I did ask my guildmate her side, and she said that there were 2 groups at the Highpass zone killing orcs, and splitting the spawns.  The guy who talked to me was in the other group, and no one had said a single word to her beforehand.<P>   -tailchaser vents,<BR>    feel free to ignore me  =><P><I>Edit</I>:If you do send the letter to his guildmaster, then take this bit of advise: Your message will be taken infinitely more seriously if you use paragraphs.  Conversations online are *much* easier to follow if the messages are split into sections.  Just a thought.  =><p>[This message has been edited by tailchaser (edited 10-12-2000).]</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#dedfdf"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Chikung</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">IMHO,<BR>I side with the "steer clear of this guy but don't waste the energy sending the letter" crowd.<P>It was an unfortunate night indeed. And based on the facts you presented, you should be ticked off. <P>Yes, he will either learn in time or won't. but the learning process happens when someone is open and ready to learn. It sounds like he's in the selfish tunnel vision mode and already has a chip on his shoulder.<BR>I have been in the same position as he was (waaaay back : ) ) and the same as you (hehe more often?)<BR>and I must say, that venting to group members or guild associates (and I don't mean "ranting" or Besmirching" ) felt good at the time, I believe that in the long run I made a few more enemies, or burned bridges that needn't have been burned.<P>Long after the letter issue is over, this guy will remember you as a tattler. Some of his guildmates (or ex-guildmates) too, and in 10 levels, the historical facts will be hazy and someone, somewhere might see your name as your LFG and say "Nah, don't get him/her I heard....something bad about them"<P>Soon enough his rep will be cemnted in the minds of many Norrathians. <P>I have met many along the road that were atop my No-Rez-when *someday*-I reach-rez-level, who turned out ok.</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#f7f7f7"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Salina</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">I'm my guild's leader as well..<P>And actually, if someone sent me that email I would definitely question the person involved, and talk to the person who sent me the email online if possible.<P>I take that very seriously, though.  My guild has a good reputation as being a group of people who know what they're doing, so something like that would definitely get my attention.<P>It reminds me of a point several months ago when someone sent me a tell while I was playing my alt.  He asked me who my guild leader was, and I gave him my main character's name (didn't know what it was about at first).  I asked him what was wrong, and he told me that one of my members (and a good friend of mine) had killed him without provocation in the Arena.<P>After further questioning, it turned out that there had been a GM event and mass slaughter for fun in the Arena.  This guy had been there for another reason, and my friend as well as a few remaining folks who were killing each other for fun had indeed killed him.<P>I told my friend, who had since logged in another character to log back in and pay the kid what he had paid for the port to get back to his body.<P>It turned out that my friend didn't really have much to do with the "murder" of this newbie, but I made sure he was happy with being paid back for the port he had to get.<P>Was it my fault?  No.  Was it something I had the power to fix?  Yes. <P>------------------<BR>Salina Grey<BR>Erudite Vicar, Bertoxxulous</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#dedfdf"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Llew Lifebringer</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Ellana...

Unfortunately there are many players at these lower levels that just dont understand how to play a cleric or sometimes other classes that dont understand the other benefits of the cleric. Im only level 30 but have learned early the benefits of stun, root and fear spells. <P>I was in a group a couple days ago in unrest. The group consisted of three tanks, one cleric and myself. We were going to work the hand room as everything else was taken; on our way there one of the tanks had the hand agro on him so he pulled the room to the back of the house where we all met him. When I got there two tanks and the cleric were fighting the hand, with four or five undead mobs on them. I started healing as needed at about half-life. The cleric just kept fighting as well as casting dismiss undead. At about 40% mana left I realized I was not going to be able to keep the group alive so I stared casting spook on all the undead and had them running. We then took the hand down with very little damage to the tanks and killed each of the undead mobs as they returned.<P>We then went in and cleared the rest of the hand room. Spawns were slow so the puller started pulling from the second floor. On one bad pull he had four undead and as he came thru the first room towards the balcony he picked up three carrion ghouls that had spawned. The cleric started tanking and then casting root and backing off. I started rooting everything and told the tanks to back up so the rooted mobs wouldnt be able to hit them. They didnt they just stood their ground and kept fighting taking damage that I didnt have the mana to heal. Then of course we ended up zoning. One other thing, the tanks never fought the same mob when there was more than one. Im a cleric so I dont do a lot of fighting but even I have a hotkey set for assist.<P>Sometimes its just better to solo.<BR><P>------------------<BR>Aordolar Trueheal<BR>30th Season Cleric Healer of Brell<BR>Innoruuk Server</FONT></TD></TR></TABLE>
