He wasn't in my group, but there was really nothing the cleric in the other group could do, especially being caught unawares of how hard this thing could hit.  The warrior crumpled like a paper doll.<P>Then the two tanks in my group took over, both rangers.  The warrior's quick death had scared us all.  I began chain casting Devine Light, and even that wasn't fast enough. It took the two rangers skillfully transferring aggro between them so I could have time to heal one, supplemented by a druid in my group who is a very good healer, and possibly with help from the other group's cleric as well.  Despite clarity and a necro pouring mana into me, I was OOM as the mob fell.<P>The second time we tried it went much better.  The warrior went in with Death Pact, Celestial Healing already cast before he engaged, and TWO clerics focussed on keeping him alive.  Hardly broke us out into a sweat that time.  <IMG SRC="http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/wink.gif"><P>So yeah, these situations can happen and Kovina is absolutely right.  It takes a group effort, and sometimes even help from another group.

That's definitely a high-end mob (read 60+).  Note: yes, there are some mobs that are not slowable, hit for 300 or more, and are not over 60 (eg. Kerdelb in Velketor's), but they are the exception.  Anyway, tanks fighting mobs like that are typically going to be buffed to 4k hps, maybe a lot more.  I know that between myself and the 60 Shaman we add about 1,800 hps to each tank.  So....<P>If possible I hit the tank with a Celestial Elixir before he engages and then go to Complete Heal if necessary.  Also, if the mob is really a bad ass then the tank should be using Evasive or Defensive.  If your tank can't do either, well, better kill the mob quick then because chaining CHeal is not going to happen long.<P>Rayne</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#f7f7f7"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Kallain</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Two ways that your tanks are going to be taking this kind of damage. Overpull and uber mobs.<P>On an overpull, without an enchanter you will be dead. Divine Light and the unengaged mobs will make straight for you. DA, cancel it when the next heal is needed, repeat with DB if needed. If they aren't mezzed by this point then LOADING PLEASE WAIT...<P>On uber mobs the strategy seems to vary.<P>On Dain Frostreaver, each group gets a cleric. Tanks know that when they get agro, they disengage for CH. Im usually starting CH at about 60% in this situation. If the tank gets out, CH is already inbound and he is back in the fight fast. If he keeps the agro, CH wont get off in time and he will die. Tanks know this and learn to live with it. I always apologize for my miserable failure anyway. the tank can also sometimes get disengaged early. In this case, Cel Heal and back to the fight.<P>The guild I did Velkator with put 5 clerics and a bard in a group. Picked 3 main tanks and split 3 clerics to focus on the 1st main with the two remaining concentrating on the two backup tanks. CH was started as soon as the tank started taking damage. The raid was told that only these 3 tanks would be getting the cleric heals. Any other tank that got closest to Velk' would die. I think only three people died, one beeing the 1st cleric to CH the main tank.<P>Sometimes you mess up and people die, other times there is nothing you can do to keep them alive. If you mess up, always admit it. If you don't think there was anything you could do, tell them what you did, why you did it and let them know that in the same situation, you don't think there was anything you could do to improve on the outcome.<P>Sometime though, no explaination is necessary:<BR>You tell your party "CH a Selibite Juggernaut"<BR>You tell your party "Doh"<P>Kallain Ironsoul.<BR>Templar.

How many? It depends on how organised everyone is.<P>Presuming that the damage is coming from 1 mob :<P>If a level 44 cleric is involved in a fight like that, just gate and then call for a rogue or necro for CR.<P>There is no way a level 44 would have enough mana to help a tank survive a fight like that.<P>The only time you would be able to do something is if you were a secondary or tertiary cleric.  If the group is the only group in the hunt, expect a wipeout - no questions asked.  Hit DA if necessary, but gate asap.<P>If it is from multiple mobs :<P>Heal the tank as much as possible, but give priority to the enchanter.  As soon as those other mobs start crowding you, hit DA.  The tank will now survive long enough as long as the rest of the group know what to do.<P>If the enchanter dies, the best idea would be to get ready for a CR by gating.<P>If the enchanter does manage to mez the mobs, atone all the mobs.  If you have to, use atone multiple times.  It saves the enchanter from using all his mana.<P>Essentially, if the group doesn't get the fight under control PDQ, you don't stand a chance.<P>A lot of clerics pre-res prefer to sacrifice themselves.  In higher level hunts, it is not practical.  In most situations, it would take longer to have the cleric rezzed than for the cleric to survive and res everyone after.<P><P>------------------<BR>Hinanar Goodhammer<BR>Vicar of Brell Seliris<BR>Cazic-Thule Server<BR>Guild of Albion "Death before Dishonour!"<P>'Clerics can tank...we're just no good at dealing damage'</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#dedfdf"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Nizdaar</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Do that many of you actually keep gate up?

However your idea does have merit in a multiple cleric situation. Say 3 clerics rotating the agro with comp heals and using da and db to survive the onslaught with the tank not taunting. the timing would be incredibly tricky since the tank would have to take some damage for the agro to shift between clerics healing the tank.<BR>Actualy an intresting idea but would have to be in a complete trust group with some incredible timing between clerics and tank.<P>As for the original idea lets do this. Lets say you are fighting mobs that are Quading for 300 with a thank that has 3500 hps in a group war, cleric, Echanter, wizard, backup warrior. Primary warrior is only one taunting. cleric is below level 49. I think those numbers are little closer to reality how would you handle this what heals when.<P>------------------<BR>Trilvan Lostheart<BR>46th Cleric of Love Peace and Happiness<BR>Markham Rosrac<BR>52nd Modrod handin, coldstone passin, pet a bashin, Gician</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#f7f7f7"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Shohanna Curesurtales</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">My only beef with the senario is the fact that a 44 cleric healing a 2k+ warrior is around lvl 45 or so.. And your not going to engage 1 mob for 300d/s,  Even Vox and Naggie don't hit 1 time for that much.  So the situation is impossible. <P>Unless it is multiple mobs.<P>And even if it's multiple mobs,  you will have a fairly balanced group or you wouldn't be in the area of (these mobs)..  <P>And once YOU the cleric, buff the tank.. He IS going to have more then 25k Hp.. around there anyway.. The numbers just don't match up.. <P>I am just starting to use CH, and if my tank was going down that fast, I cast SH and call evac anyway..  But you need more information to actually see the situation. I see the suggestions that were made here.  Most of them are assuming this or that.  But I would like to see the actual set up of the question..<P>1 mob 300d/s  = sebilis and your not going to be there with a 44 cleric anyway..<P>Multiple Mobs = Karnor's, your not going to be there with a 45 warrior. 'nuff said.. if you are.. your going to be Zoning fast and getting nother tank.<P>My 2 cents<P>Shohanna Curesurtales<BR>Cleric 40th Jester<BR>The Unseelie Court<P>[This message has been edited by Shohanna Curesurtales (edited 04-07-2001).]<p>[This message has been edited by Shohanna Curesurtales (edited 04-07-2001).]</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#dedfdf"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Sinisade</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">"1 mob 300d/s = sebilis and your not going to be there with a 44 cleric anyway.."<P>Maybe in candyland  <IMG SRC="http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/tongue.gif"><P>I was raised as a Cleric the hardway. One day I'm a lvl 56 Wizard who gets together with some friends and forms a guild. Naturally we have the problem that all newly formed guilds have and that's a serious lack of clerics. I'm flexible and a diehard when it comes to the guild so I take the patented leap o' faith.<P>At lvl 42-46 roughly we're doing 2 and 3 group raids in Kael in the Gleed area and if you haven't been there further back is that Bastard that swings for 500 a pop. And yup we pulled him..had no idea what he could do. And the tank in my group after 3 ppl got wasted ended up being the Main tank. I had no healing help and kept him alive.<P>But yes, the scenario is unrealistic cause even my friends warrior had well over 2k in health(buffed) at lvl's below 40. While this scenario is very unrealistic I can see where the guy was coming from that asked you the question. He didn't give you specifics so use that to your advantage. Tell him you buff the pansy with "Quality" Cleric buffs to his full potential of 3k in health and drop Celestial on him as the fight starts which gives you plenty of time to chain CH on that tank. And if that isn't good enuff tell him the damn druid in your group fizzled casting GH and that's what really got the Tank killed  <IMG SRC="http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/tongue.gif"><P><BR>Sini</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#f7f7f7"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Uulax</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Assuming the mob has a normal delay (30), 300 damage a second is equivilent to 900 damage a melee round, or about 450 damage per swing, double attacking.<P>This is <I>about</I> the damage output of something like the Sebilite Protector.  A single group with a level 44 cleric and a tank with only 2000hp can NOT expect to survive against something like that, at all.  Like others have said, make sure you survive and try to make corpse recovery as painless as possible. </FONT></TD></TR></TABLE>
