<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Serrath</div><div class="date">07-25-2002, 08:53 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm a vigerous browser of message boards. I troll forums relating to other guilds (Triton, FoH, AL), other everquest classes (safehouse, eqnecro, shadowknights) and i pop into IRC a lot. i engage in a lot of class discussions with other people, debating the damage midigation of warriors, the glaring problems of the bard power curve and the horrible uselessness of druids (no offence or anything &lt;evil grin&gt;). In all my debates, though, noone ever questions clerics... and i wondered why<br />
<br />
Browsing through some of the more popular class based forums i read how Varent has broken the necromancer class. How hybrids have been left out of the power curve, Graffe's constantly complains about how wizards have been undervalued in favor of rogues and i've heard bards called the red-headed step child that varent forgot. Other class forums are FILLED with rants and suggestions on how to fix a particular class, yet noone ever suggests anything for clerics. visiting this board for the first time, even in your rant forums, there really is no complaint about our class. we're not 'broken', we're not coded badly... we're not overjoyed with our class, but we have no reason to complain. In short, we are working as intended.<br />
<br />
and, to be honest, i seriously believe we are the only class that is so. We are unique in that we have no real reason to complain. There have been no patches that dramatically increased or descreased our power. we've never been horribly nerfed, but since beta i've never seen a patch that dramatically impacted the way i play my class. Some clerics might discuss how we can no longer be stunned while DA'd, or that our nukes now do an almost respectable amount of damage... but we've never been crippled or overpowered... we just are<br />
<br />
we started out perfectly suited to our class and we continue to be. Our rant should run along the lines of 'GOD DAMN YOU VARENT FOR DOING SUCH A GOOD JOB.' if asked to point to something that everquest has done 'right,' i wouldn't hesitate to point to clerics. <br />
<br />
does anyone else agree? does anyone else see any glaring problems, either in being under or overpowered for a specific role? i'm almost tempted to point out the effectivness of exile undead, but its power doesn't rely on mass damage, but on a 0 refresh timer and low mana so that argument doesn't hold much weight. In truth, it really feels like we have no reason to complain...<br />

<br />
When Velious cleric bp's had Celestial Elixer, that meant that any cleric as low as 46 could get access to a spell that they would otherwise not get for a long time.  In terms of usefulness, it straight out owned.  I remember my friend who had one of the first velious cleric bp's from PoG and she and a monk duo'd Icewell guards nonstop, with no downtime and pretty much skyrocketed to 59-60 with it.  When the nerf came through, she wasn't upset about it, she admited that it was overpowering.<br />
<br />
Instead of putting Mark of Karn on it, they should have put Celestial Healing on it instead.<br />
<br />
CH BP as it was originally was a bit much too, though its current form makes it pretty much useless.  If they'd make it so that you could cast it on a person once every 5 mins instead of 30, then it's usefullness would be a lot better.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Errr... right.  You apparently have forgotten the list (mostly posted above) of cleric things that got nerfed.  It's good that you think we are a great class.  But to say we have no reason to complain is to make us look at you and say, &quot;Druid spy!&quot;  http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/smile.gif.  Only joking with that one.  There are quite a number of very legitimate cleric complaints.  On that same note, there are legitimate complaints for ALL classes... well, maybe not rogues  http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/smile.gif.  <br />
<br />
This being a cleric board, we bitch about cleric things here.  And generally, we do it in this forum as opposed to the rants.  Our complaints are typically well thought out, researched, and proven with time.  We've never asked for SoW and ManaBurn for example (or at least not seriously).  So while the class complaining may be at a muted level, read the posts and you will see that it exists for good reason.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Saarem</div><div class="date">07-25-2002, 09:51 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">It takes a special kind of player to play a cleric to 60. You cant solo anything of value, you cant twink your secondaries out etc. So through it all so have it weed out alot of people who simply could not stand it. Yes, we have been nerfed, so has every other class. We had some minor upgrades, so has all other classes as well. We have never had a major nerf hit us, but alot of medium (MoK, SoV BP and effects etc) and very few upgrades but no major either (/wave 2h melee change for paladins/SKs). <br />
<br />
Lets face it, clerics stronghold in groups was and is CH. Without the need of CH so are you better of with a shaman as healer in a regular exp group (and in many cases so will a shaman do anyway). And the reason I think clerics dont rant or scream is that we kept a faith in VI because we where so group friendly so would we not get nerfed. Well the simple fact is it that mudflation has caught up now and we are in that sense nerfed. Our need in a group is greatly diminished (short of Deep on the other side of the bridge, Ssra second floor elite so is there not many places where a Torpor shaman will not do, and yes CT is doable without a cleric), our solo capabilites are very minor compared to other classes and VI will not change that because we got complete heal. And complete heal is something needed on raids and therefor so are we overpowered. Also look at all uberguilds recruitment lists, high on top are usually clerics. It is not because they somehow needed to increase their number of clerics above the 10 or so on the raid but because their clerics simply quit or created a new char so they always need replacements. Clerics dont rant and scream like little children like the druids, we dont go around bitter remembering our quadding 72 pet as necros asking what next nerf will be, we simply fade away without leaving a trace except in the lack of clerics on raids when the melee suddenly remember that we exists. Remember when it used to be the old maxim two druids/shamans should equal one cleric for healing? Now it is one druid/shaman should equal a cleric if you read the boards. And quite frankly there is no need for a cleric in a exp group anymore in 95% of the camps and the regular exp camp is most exp with least risk as fast as possible. With big pointers on least risk.<br />
<br />
As a sidenote, I been working on my ranger the last months now to replace my 250 days cleric. Not because I dislike healing, I was healer at heart but for the simple reason I dont want to have basiclly depend on good will to join a group because of who I am not as much what I bring. I want the group to actually gain more exp with me and not slow down because of me and that is simply not true in most cases anymore. At least my ranger with AM3/EQ will bring in exp for them. And no, the VI &quot;slightly more well rounded&quot; clings in my ears like, lets give druids and shamans big heal upgrades and then throw some bones to clerics to keep them quiet again. So at best so will the undead DD be upgraded to 950 damage, same dmg/mana and thats it. We will lose even more in the exp groups and be even more needed on the raids burning out even more clerics continuing down the current spiral.<br />

I actively browse this board and the shaman board as well as news sites.  <br />
<br />
I do see clerics here having complaints.<br />
<br />
Mostly its: We have CH and nothing else and wont get anything else because that one spell skews the class and game.<br />
<br />
Which in a way it is true.  There are sooo many times that all you can do is heal, buff, heal, heal, rez, heal, buff, heal and yup HEAL.  <br />
<br />
Our utility spells are minimal, our travel spells are 2 (gate &amp; fear), our soloing power is inefficient and ineffective, our group desirablity (at easy 60aa camps) is low, our normal contribution to DPS is low, and our regeant expenses high.<br />
<br />
Yes, this is an oversimplification but I see repeated complaints on these topics.  I feel these issues daily.  But the amazing thing is, rather then tear at eachother we normally just all agree on issues as we see them (on a whole) and life continues.  Every once in a while a thread will grow about it, its normally civil and educational with minimal class bashing usually.<br />
<br />
Thats just my view of the subject though.  That plus Dalur and Rayne keep us on a short leash.  http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/wink.gif (jk guys! We really do love ya!)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Amris</div><div class="date">07-25-2002, 10:48 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Things I think are a problem for the cleric class:<br />
<br />
Can't solo, even if we want to (or can't find a group).<br />
<br />
Can be played by a 2 year old, and not be totally ineffective.  AKA, bot clerics.  You can't bot cleric and be a phenomenal cleric, but you can get by.<br />
<br />
Reagent costs pit clerics against others, and others against clerics as far as 'loot whoring'.<br />
<br />
Low end and mid game is very hard to struggle through because the healing power is so close to druids and shamans, so getting a group is very hard, while nothing in those low to mid levels compensates to allow us to solo effectively.<br />
<br />
No good cleric gear quests that actually adress our needs (no or low wis on our gear????  EH?), while at the same time, costing us reagents.<br />
<br />
Until the very highest game, our buffs are not significant enough to overbalance the ability of a shaman to haste the tanks/slow the mobs.  So that doesn't make us particularly wanted, in fact, makes us less wanted.<br />
<br />
We're SO focused that if the group's going along fine (and many groups do nowdays with the current equipment available), a cleric is not only un-needed, but actually a burden, unless you get trained and want a rez.<br />
<br />
Can you say RageFire?<br />
<br />
Every other class has ways to decrease their mana downtime, except us.<br />
<br />
<br />
Do I think the cleric class is awesome?  Yes.  Do I think it's perfectly balanced?  No.  Am I going to complain and draw Verant's attention?  NO WAY.  Why not?  Everyone that gets their attention suffers for it.<br />
<br />
Clerics know this.<br />
<br />
<br />
(Yes, I'm sure I missed a few things, hehe.  Oh, and this isn't a complaint, I'm just saying that no, I don't think the cleric class is balanced properly.  More so than any other besides monk, though.  Monks are the most balanced class, IMO.)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gniss Fleshmender</div><div class="date">07-25-2002, 10:56 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">It's simple really. <br />
<br />
First: Rayne set up a board and moderators that would be polite and civil. Dalur and the moderators before him nuked any posts that got above a certain threshold of rudeness/anger. This made the original posters polite, and that trend kept going, with the newest posters taking cues from the tones of the older posters.<br />
<br />
Second: It takes a certain mindset to play a cleric well, and we have some of the best clerics here. Put simply, most trolls don't have that mindset, hence they don't visit EQCleric all that often. We tend to think our way through things, see it from as many angles as we can, and then form a decision.<br />
<br />
Third, we have a fairly static class. Clerics are the benchmark for ALL other classes. Past level 40, the game was designed around the cleric. anything major you need to do, you need clerics for.<br />
<br />
<br />
All this keeps us polite and kinda quiet. We rumble about the problems in our class, whereas other classes scream from the rooftops. Asking on each class'es websites what they would consider a decent spell, you get a lot of overpowered spell ideas. Here, most clerics would come up with a balanced, well thought out spell with penalties and bonuses.<br />
<br />
Basicly the biggest problem with our class as we see it is that we are so static. We're a one trick pony, without the utility to offset that that would make us fun. Enchanters who get bored of groups can go charm things and solo. Wizards can travel anywhere easily, and can choose how to fight. Every class but the cleric has other options open to them, and they can stack in a group for more power. 5 warriors and a mage make a powerful group using nothing but bind wounds. 5 clerics and a warrior can't kill anything worthwhile.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Niccy</div><div class="date">07-25-2002, 11:54 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">/agree with all that. To be precise:<br />
<br />
Cali&gt;&gt; We have CH and nothing else and wont get anything else because that one spell skews the class and game<br />
<br />
This can't be emphasised enough. CH is the cleric's boon and bane, all at once. And it is also the single concept that most clearly sums up high end play in EQ. So, in a sense, we have nothing to complain about, because what we do IS EverQuest. You couldn't dramatically change our class - either with enhancement or nerfage - without also dramatically changing the whole game. This is why nothing major will ever happen to the cleric class. Verant knows this. We know this - and have done for some time. And in a kind of self-fulfilling prophecy, that's why there are no major gripes. Anyone who still now has a problem with the cleric's role has been barking up the wrong tree for *years* now. No one is *that* stubborn.<br />
<br />
And in a way, this self-aware, knowing acceptance of what we do, and why it can't change (much), is also part of the whole &quot;it takes a particular kind of person to play a cleric&quot; motif that others have already mentioned. If I were going to ramble on, this is where I would stick in some sanctimonious guff about wanting to help others, be in the background making sure everything runs smoothly, not wanting to draw attention to oneself, etc etc. But you can fill that in for yourself  http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/smile.gif<br />
<br />
As the original poster said, &quot;we've never been crippled or overpowered... we just are&quot;.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Rayne</div><div class="date">07-25-2002, 01:23 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yep, we have CHeal so we are functioning &quot;as per the Vision.&quot;  However, we are NOT fine.  I don't know about the rest of you, but I find being only a Cleric boring.  Downright $#*($#( boring.  So I 'bot the Cleric and play another class on my primary machine.  Why? Because in a good group the most efficient thing Rayne can be doing is CHealing.  The places where Rayne can be doing other things aren't the most efficient places to hunt.  Of course, my gaming time doesn't revolve around the schedules of my 35 closest friends =P.<br />
<br />
I remember when it wasn't this way.  My fun days as a Cleric were pre-Kunark.  Back when CHeal was a nice spell, but hardly the only spell I cast.  Back when a level 50 Cleric had decent offensive power when related to the other classes.  Back when doing a dungeon crawl (provided you could find some available content) didn't automatically consist of the Holy Trinity of Warrior, Enchanter, and Cleric.  Back when breaking into the Efreeti was still a challenge and holding it with 2 players (both Clerics mind you) was an accomplishment.  Back before Kunark skewed the class power curve and Velious destroyed all semblance of class balance.  I loved playing Rayne up through 50, got bored during Kunark, and stopped caring (most of the time) post-Velious.<br />
<br />
No, I don't think the class is broken; I think the GAME is broken, or at least badly damaged.  I'm still having fun though, just not focusing on the Rayne character.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">electrae</div><div class="date">07-25-2002, 01:58 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Either I missed your point entirely or else you haven't been reading much of this message forum.  Clerics have plenty of complaints about their class.  Mostly it's consists of boredom with our linear and one-dimensional ability (i.e.  we heal, that's it) and our diminishing role in experience groups.  Some clerics very badly want to be able to solo efficiently.<br />
<br />
Yes, we're not always boring to play.  Some zones you are hard pressed to play without a cleric, but most zones you can get buy with someone to slow mobs and cast smaller heals.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Boanerges</div><div class="date">07-25-2002, 02:34 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">When EQ first came out this was dead on.<br />
<br />
Clerics had it rough. We had to compete with shamen and druids but, like all good things, we waitied and trudged on. By level 50 we were desired beyond compare. We were good at what we did because if you weren't, you went groupless and soloing was near impossible.<br />
<br />
Kunark made us the only healers. We could buff more and tanks now had more. Many left their druids to become clerics. The cleric population surged with freshly made clerics.<br />
<br />
Velious brough new problems. For the first time we saw the obscenity of the new mobs. They could hit faster and now had upwards of 50x the previous HPs. CH couldn't even cut it. So guilds figured out you had to have a ton of clerics casting CH over and over and the CH chain was born. More importantly, to make up the for the lack of clerics, many people rolled one up on a second account. As primary clerics would leave these twinks would replace them. It became a vicious downward cycle.<br />
<br />
SoL boosted tanks and many casters beyond compare. The need for healing in non-raid situations diminished significantly. Most importantly, level 60 characters began to seek exp. The best exp? You guessed it, grouped with their twink clerics.<br />
<br />
So here we stand today. We cast CH on raids and in many cases are left in the cold for exp groups. It's not surprising that the average cleric AA level is driven primarily by twinks. Half the clerics in my guild who can cast MGB are twinks. Even I do not have MGB yet. And whenever I complain I am given advice, not action. &quot;Find a tank to duo with&quot; &quot;Go LFG in Seb&quot; If I quit, I will be replaced without a sweat.<br />
<br />
Our problem is not that we have been nerfed, it's that the game has gone up and we have not gone up with it. I can nuke for slightly better efficiency than I could at level 50. Woohoo  http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/rolleyes.gif<br />
<br />
We are not a viable class by ourselves. Never have been. But when we have nobody to work with, what do we do? When AA is improving twinks while we sit at the zone LFG with half a dozen other clerics, what do we do?<br />
<br />
Do we complain? Yes. But we also get ignored very easily. It's easy to slam the door in the face of clerics because we have a handy one to use: CH. People point to it, scream &quot;You're already unbalanced&quot; and slam it in our faces.<br />
<br />
Nowhere is this more evident than our click items. The ones causing the most strife are...<br />
Donal's BP (CH-&gt;nerfed CH)<br />
Velious BPs (CE-&gt;MoK)<br />
Cleric Epic (56 Res, massive fighting with other PCs to obtain)<br />
<br />
Beyond that, there are no truly useful cleric click items. Worse, Verant treats us like little children.<br />
<br />
Cleric quest armor (Sol Ro) - &quot;We think the armor and questa are just fine so stop whining&quot; (weeks pass) &quot;Ok, it seems it's unbelievably rare so we're going to up the spawn rates&quot; (2 months pass) &quot;We fixed the mobs&quot; (3 more months pass) &quot;Ok, we gave it plate AC instead of the leather AC it had&quot;<br />
<br />
MoK- &quot;We're nerfing MoK because the paladins said you're screwing them out of groups&quot; (a month passes) &quot;Ok, since you've whined so much we're going to give you two options: leave it unusable like it is or gimp it down and remove the 5 min recast... gimp it down and give it a lower recast? Good choice! See? We at VI listen to you&quot; (months later, different guy) &quot;Well, we're gonna up the HPs healed by MoK a bit. Should make a bigger difference&quot;<br />
<br />
Donal's BP - &quot;Given how rare it is (and they were unbelievably rare back then) we don't think it's overpowered&quot; (6 months later) &quot;It's overpowered. We're nerfing it&quot; (2 weeks later) &quot;It's still overpowered, we're gonna gimp it further&quot;<br />
<br />
Velious BPs - &quot;We're taking off the CE effect and we're gonna consider what to give it&quot; (cleric community asks for Aegis or SHoW, weeks pass) &quot;Ok, we're gonna make it cast MoK&quot;<br />
<br />
Cleric epic - (we ask that he be moved from Nagafen's lair since Nagafen is a level 52 capped dragon and made to spawn a bit more often, got ignored for 6 months) &quot;We think the quest might have been too easy but we're not going to fix what is obviously wrong with it. Besides, the clerics are doing a good job of killing Nagafen&quot; (sat like this ANOTHER 6 months and we made do, then out of the blue...) &quot;We're tired of seeing clerics lose their pearls (read: we're tired of listening to GMs b**** about replacing pearls when other guilds KS them) so we're changing the quest. The new end involves endless hours of camping in Skyfire&quot; (the &quot;fix&quot; allowed any cleric in the game to get the item, regardless of their epic quest progress. It also cut the rate epics entered the game by half)<br />
<br />
So, do clerics have gripes? You betcha. We've just learned that Verant doesn't listen to us unless they come to us first.<br />

<br />
That, in a nutshell, is the problem.  We have gripes, just like every class out there.  The only difference is that while other classes complain left and right and eventually get thrown a bone, we clerics only hear &quot;Shut up...you're way overpowered as it is...we're not making any improvments to your class...now stop asking and go cast Complete Heal on something.&quot;<br />
<br />
And clerics have been hearing it for over 3 years.<br />
<br />
We're tired.  In fact, we're so tired we don't even care anymore when other priest classes get new spells and healing improvments...while we sit down and try desperately to wipe off that &quot;Complete Heal&quot; mark etched into our foreheads.  We're to the point that we don't really care if we even do get some sort of upgrade/improvment...all we try to do now is stay out of the reach of the nerf bat.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Necros, bards, druids, rogues wizards etc all claim that they are the class that gets hit with the &quot;nerf bat&quot; more than any other.<br />
<br />
In all reality most percieved &quot;nerfs&quot; (god I hate that term) are either bug fixes, or reasonable balance issues.<br />
<br />
Verants main problem is that they put effects and items in the game without really thinking about the issues, then when they are toned down, sometimes after just a day people cry nerf.<br />
<br />
Prime example of fanatic nerf crying is the focus items. They got rejigged in under 24 hrs and people were whining all over.<br />
<br />
As many people have said already, CH is our shining light and the chain around our ankles, and as a group we try to be as reasonable as possible (even with the crap that is Ragefire, hehe)</div></div><hr />

But I believe we have to accept that it has to be this way. The high-end game requires specialists and since clerics are healing specialists, we will always be coveted.<br />
<br />
Druids and necromances, at the other end of this spectrum, can do a lot of different things. They can function very independently. However, they would complain that their place in raids is far less significant than a cleric's during a battle. So everyone has a legitimate complaint. Everyone wants what they do not have.<br />
<br />
I think we clerics have reasons to complain, but we have far less reason to do so than any other class.<br />

<br />
I would like different types of things new ideas and the like. <br />
<br />
Verant is very set in there ways as to the types of powers, classes get and items give.  Take food for instance, way boring.  It just gives some pluses whoopie&amp;#(^.  It would have been cool to see some spell like effect like faster stamina regen or move speed, but no its stat pluses.<br />
<br />
Give me something different.  I dont want to be a 70 level cleric in POP.  the more people talk the less i feel like going on a raid.  How about instead of Boss mobs its wars with mobs you stand a fair chance against.  How about a /general and /high priest command that stop you from casting and fighting but allow you to affect entire out come of the fight in some way?</div></div><hr />

They have been neglected.  We're using the same heal we were using two and a half years ago.  We got it at level 39.  Our buffs are now a lazy man's buffs - Marzin/PoG seems to be the preferrable combination, but we're too lazy, so we AE aego.  We haven't gotten a new heal of any kind in forever.  Our aaxp is a study in marginal upgrades (4320 hour refresh time?  Kidding, right?  Purify Soul?  Next AE refreshes negative effects?  Great).  Focus items don't affect CH.  CH is the ONLY spell that mana perservation 3 does not affect.<br />
What we are is bored, disaffected, and frustrated.  On our average AoW fight, we have more non-clerics playing clerics than we have cleric mains.  That's not true of any other class.  That should tell you something...<br />
Group Celestial Elixer would be nice.  A single-target heal with a reasonable mana ratio and a good casting time that could put a dent in a 7k hp tank would be nice.  A level 60 Superior CE would be nice.  A spell version of Purify Soul, and a group version, would be nice.  Some way to combat AE.  A group Remove Curse would be nice.  An aaxp ae heal skill would be nice.  Basically, VARIETY would be nice.  But instead, we get CH.  I've actually emailed Absor about it.

<br />
Being more versatile may very well do so.<br />
<br />
What is wrong with being able to melee sufficiently to solo? Sure it means that we dont have to group to get experience but most other classes dont have to group to do that either so where is the harm or inconsistentcy? <br />
<br />
On raids we are too busy healing anyway so will not unbalance the encounter with our UBER melee powers.<br />
<br />
What is the problem with being able to convert MoBs to our cause? Clerics having charm? God forbid. Other healing classes whos forte is not melee get pets. Druids even get Dire Charm.<br />
<br />
I am unsure whether the initiating post is a troll or not but:<br />
<br />
I THINK CLERICS ARE JUST TOO COMPLACENT OR MEEK AND MILD<br />
<br />
Why spend so much time to build a character and then just walk away. People say they fear the nerf-stick. But to fear it so much you would rather walk away than forcefully point out that your class is fast becoming Botz-R-Us is self-defeating. Do not be paralyzed by fear. That is not being meek that is being cowardly.<br />
<br />
Clerics by nature dont eat raw meat. But maybe they should tear some from the grasp of the classes that can solo, that can dire charm, that can melee cleanse for massive amounts, that can do so many exciting, experience gaining things.<br />
<br />
It is not a good character trait to dabble around the edges when the problem lies at the centre.<br />
<br />
Yes clerics are AWESOME. Yes clerics are BORING. Yes clerics are the only class that CANNOT solo effectively. <br />
<br />
You want to be noticed? Well stop being your own worst enemies. Stop reading the bit about the meek inheriting Norrath. <br />
<br />
Here is a hint: The meek are too meek to collect their inheritance because they would have to push the non-meek out of the way to do so.<br />
<br />
Ok now I have that out of my system, I will go powerlevel a melee so I dont have to be pushy and ask for a group or confront Verant. Having the ability to rez my melee character means the last 150 days are not all to nought.<br />

We have very few abilities(heal, rez, buff) and we do them best of all classes.   and in VI mind thats exactly what they want us to do.<br />
Everything else they give us is just a carrot on a stick waving in front of us.<br />

But im not complaining, i love the class, i love playing cleric.  Sure normal invis would be great and also more undead destructive powers(more in the like of D&amp;D cleric)  but other then that im ok.<br />

Many community representatives are &quot;high end&quot; players that have little concerns that a level 55 of their class may have completely different problems. <br />

I don't think clerics are perfect. They lack a lot in xp groups and don't scale well. Other classes have more serious problems though. Necros and druids lack solid raid roles for example.<br />

<br />
Seeing paladins crit for 4500 with sley undead is so unfair when i have to spend 1200 mana to do that much damage.  In all accounts it takes us much more mana and time to solo anything compared to any other class. seeing paladins clearing 12-15 spawns at a time as opposed to me clearing 4 or so and being better equiped is just flat out cruel.<br />
<br />
The answer:  go get an exp group... yeah right who wants us for that half the time, everyone is off soloing.  If a group does need a cleric to heal it then it is not a very good experience group.  The group is either underpowered or fighting mobs which have a lot of HPs and hit for over 200, thus experience cannot be gotten as swiftly in such a group.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Galavant</div><div class="date">07-26-2002, 05:17 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Verant has stated in the past that if they could go back and undo it, they would NOT have put CH in the game. Or at least, they would have made CH much higher level than 39. Imagine CH as an AA ability...anyway, that is both our biggest strength and biggest downfall. We have CH. And Verant thinks that CH is overpowered, but can't do anything about it without totally wrecking the game that they have created. So as long as we have CH, Verant will always consider clerics to be overpowered and do little or nothing for us. It's a classic Catch-22.<br />
<br />
Verant has also stated in the past that they don't like pulling, lock-down crowd control, and other things that we consider to be basic staples of the game, from the lowest newb in Blackburrow all the way to 60. But again, they can't do anything about it becuase it would wreck the game.<br />
<br />
The bottom line is, Verant really didn't understand the game mechanics they were creating when they did it. And we are the ones who have to pay the price for their lack of foresight.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Aldur</div><div class="date">07-26-2002, 05:21 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The crux of the matter is AA points.  Before luclin clerics didn't need exp beyond getting to level 60, and when they did they grouped with people who were in general sub 60, who wouldn't have great equipment, and took more damage.<br />
<br />
Clerics role is balanced in this environment - where there is damage to heal.<br />
<br />
The mud flation was always there in velious, a tank in full ss or kael armour joining a group in seb simply didn't get hit, but it wasn't as common because there wasn't a need to exp for them.<br />
<br />
With luclin exp came back and all of a sudden a massive influx of players who all want exp.  Blue mobs can't hit - I have pretty low ac, but I can tank them and melee them to death, a class designed to do just that simply doesn't take any damage.<br />
<br />
I grouped with a mate monk in FG the other day - completely broken zone.  If I didn't rate monks as being overpowered and requiring a cleric exp leecher i'd of felt guilty.  He ran around pulling killing stuff, and I could basically go afk.  I didn't even bother to rebuff aego on myself - the mobs there typically hit for less than 50, this is less damage than mobs in lower guk.<br />
<br />
The exping game is broken, people just don't take any damage whatsoever, CT the big hard zone has zero for us to do other than the occasionaly large pull.  <br />
<br />
I like healing, its why I made a cleric - its challenging, unfortunately there is no challenging exp zone in the game given the current mudflation, and that bores me senseless.  More dangerously it makes our entire class a hinderance to others getting exp.  There is not one class I can name that I add value to when duo'ing with for exp.  And theres very few groups that I do as well.<br />
<br />
It's a good thing that many of the cleric aa abilities are of limited use, with the state of boredom with the exping game I can't see myself getting many more points.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Serrath</div><div class="date">07-26-2002, 07:03 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">&quot;&quot;&quot;I am unsure whether the initiating post is a troll or not but:&quot;&quot;&quot;<br />
<br />
errr sorry i didn't mean to make it look like i was lurking and didn't intend to follow up on my comments. the question just came up in a chat i was having with Baelish (moderator of casters realm) who asked me what changes i would make to the cleric class. the only changes i could come up with were<br />
<br />
1: group 'cure' spells; cure blind, poison, disease<br />
<br />
2: group celestial elixer. we have a group complete heal spell, and that isn't overpowering, i think a group ce is just as legitimate and good for 'topping off' your group in raid situations <br />
<br />
3: higher damage undead dot and nuke but at a higher mana cost and higher refresh rate. this would actually make us more situational when fighting undead because the power of our current undead nuke lies in its 0 refresh time and low mana cost. if we had the option to chain cast the lower damage version or cast the higher damage version we'd be more like... umm... wizards, actually, in respect to undead<br />
<br />
many of these suggestions were good ones and most were entertaining to read. i guess i misrepresented myself when i said we've never been nerfed, when i said that i meant that we've never had an unjustifyable nerf. the donals trick or the mana-free ce were horribly unbalancing, especially now that those items are frequently found on lower level twinks. <br />
<br />
i must digress, though, for those who complained about the solo'ing power of clerics. If solo'ing is an issue, why start a cleric? i cannot think of another class more group-reliant then a cleric, and, to be honest, i consider that a strength. we've effectivly sacraficed our solo'ing ability in favor of invaluability in groups and raids, and i think thats a fair trade-off. Necro's and druids, who are argueably two of the best solo'ing classes often find it difficult to find groups as their class seems to have made the opposite trade off.<br />
<br />
still, though, our solo'ing power did recieve a significant boost with the introduction of faith stones. If you want a trick, bind yourself in the undead section of acrylia, nuke undead until you've killed a few and are oom, use a faithstone to gfay or whatever your diety is, manastone back to fm, gate and repeat. getting a bubble of exp an hour isn't quite the benefits i reap from AE seb or fg groups, it is faster then most warriors i've met ^_^<br />
<br />
i dont know that i can agree that the cleric class is broken. i've never heard anyone over my guild say 'omg, we cant do this raid because we dont have enough shadowknights' or 'goddammit, why cant more druids log in?' people are complaining that too many classes solo and our role has been eliminated from exp groups, but that doesn't seem to hold much weight in velks when every second line is 'cleric needed in frenzy' or 'tents looking for high-lvl cleric, PST'. Try doing an AE group without a cleric and i know i have no problems finding an abundance of monks who want to duo to eliminate their downtime.<br />
<br />
otherwise, good replies  http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/smile.gif keep them coming<br />

<br />
I agree that sometimes it's one dimensional, but we've gotten a couple upgrades that are great fun. <br />
<br />
I love Mark of Retribution. I can PL now and PL well. I can Pull greens with MoR and they die.<br />
<br />
I can almost solo some blues with MoR alone. When I'm in the grey about 50 percent of my health is given in a fight to solo for this spell, it does a lot of damage.<br />
<br />
It's a small step but it's a step in the right direction. I'd like to see a bit more but I think we have a good class. Not to hijack, but I think the number one thing we need is a real DoT for undead. I would like to see better cures for disease and poison too, along with more damaging poisons. I know most warriors won't even say, I've been poisoned because the damage is so minimal. I'd like to see them heading toward death unless a cleric/shammy/druid cured them.<br />
<br />
Just my opinion, the undead DoT is the most important to me. I loved when I got my mid-level undead nuke and could nuke in ToFS. It made me feel more than one dimensional<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Saarem</div><div class="date">07-26-2002, 08:02 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Lets define something first. NEED for a cleric and someone asking for a cleric at start. I dare say short of Second floor Ssra elite (unslowable 300s hitting) and deep CT so is there no need for a cleric. Clerics are no longer NEEDED, they where not really needed before SoV but you would be crawling along at a horrible pace going deep without them, now you dont NEED a cleric. You might want one around to ress you if you die but a Paladin can do that for you and the Shaman can slow and Torpor and paladin help heal you. Is that a good thing? Well depends from what view you got. That kind of need is not because they NEED it but because they percived and might I say stupid. So many people hang up on the 6%, 6% that is equal to 15 min in a normal exp group. They dont need a cleric, they need someone to learn them about how to play more efficent (talking pick up groups).<br />
<br />
Second, you cant bind in Acrylia last I checked (not been back there a while). Anyhow, the once I saw in there using undead clicky hammer + undead dot where doing in the area of 3 blue / hour. You say you do 1 yellow. I know rangers do 1 AA / 3h in FG if they go for it. The thing is, what you are saying is that if you are to be anywhere good at soloing so are you to get a item that no longer drops. I have seen one manastone for sale the last 9 months, starting bid at 30k, when I asked 12h later so was it up at 50k bid. So by that going so should all clerics get a manastone for soloing because that big sacrifice we do by having zero soloing power compared to other classes is now reduced from beeing valued in group AND raid to only raid. So now we are reduced to raid bots and all this because we are valued on raids so are we to accept this. You took up druids and necros as example of people who are not valued on raids but can solo, well so can monks and I cant remember they having problems? Or how about shamans? Or how about paladins and just about every other frigging class in the game. And yes, I had raids where we said WTF are the Tanks. We wanted more tanks go figure, we had raids where we wanted our druids to log on so we had more GRCers and patch healing!<br />
<br />
Clerics dont need high mana high damage undead DDs, our undead DDs are atm equal to our LIVE DDs and that if anything tells you something is out of whack with it. So what I cant chain cast them, if anything so will they break a root anyway so that aint a issue to re root/run away to get range to nuke again and have it turned up. What clerics should have and always was our strength was that our live DDs where medioker at best but we had damn good undead DDs. That is no longer the case, hell, even our dot is almost same damage to mana ratio as our DDs for crying out loud. What clerics should be is undead slayers because there is no way we will ever be wanted in exp groups again as we was before because it is a waste of exp to invite us. Since we now lost one of the two things we traded in for lack of soloing power so should we get back what one of the two. Either so do clerics need to bring ALOT more to a regular group so they actually increase their exp gain and dont slow them which is very unlikly VI will ever manage to do right OR we need highly increase undead soloing power. I dont WANT live DDs, I want big undead DDs so the dead run away screaming like little children when they see me. I want to banished the undead back to the dead due to my contact with my god, I am a priest for crying out loud let me kill these unholy beasts! I dont WANT faster bigger heals because that only means VI will upgrade the mobs even more in power to compensate for better healing so the end effect is more lost.<br />
<br />
As for group cures, lol. Umm, the mobs I raid tend to have one of two effects.<br />
1. AoE going of every 24 sec or so that usually got either unresistable lure curse / fire / cold / magic dot (aka uncurable) OR easy resistable AoE that I dont give a damn about anyway if someone is so low in resists that it lands (once every time the moon turns green).<br />
<br />
2. Curse that require GRC (and look at those fun 64 counters curses in PoP...) and giving us a group GRC is a open invite for VI to put in even more curses, something I dont want...<br />
<br />
There aint alot of places where a cure outside word of restoration is needed unless we get cures for other resists and then there are the ever so fun blind and spell filter effect...<br />

I myself wasn't of level to get a mana stone before they were removed from the game.<br />
<br />
I see that many people do have mana stones, but the numbers are very small.<br />
<br />
In addition, why should anybody have to bind in 1 spot, port back to the old world to mana stone up and then gate back just to solo in a semi effective manner.<br />
<br />
To answer your question about why would anybody want to solo - think of the times when you only had an hour or 2 to play before you had to do something else.<br />
<br />
Is it truely beneficial to look for a group and then have to leave very shortly there after?<br />
<br />
Or would it be a better idea just to solo for  that short period of time.  As it is, there are only a couple of zones where we can solo.<br />

<br />
<br />
Can I ask you something?  Did you read anything of people's complaints?  We don't want to be the best soloers!  We don't want to be REALLY GOOD soloers.  We want it doable because we have to <br />
<br />
<br />
COMPETE WITH BOT CLERICS and other classes that can heal<br />
<br />
Thus making us often unable to even FIND groups anymore.   NO ONE NEEDS clerics to 'solo' anymore EXCEPT FOR CLERICS.  In other words, the ONLY class COMPLETELY, UNEQUIVACABLY unable to solo at the high end without gross downtime or extreme danger is CLERICS.<br />
<br />
<br />
Cleric = if you can't find a group, log off.<br />
Cleric = everyone has a one botted now.<br />
Cleric = redundant in an everyday exp grind.<br />
Cleric = helplessly dependent when moving around, even worse now on luclin.<br />
Cleric = excessive downtime to an exp group without a chanter or necro in it.<br />
Cleric = UNBALANCED.<br />
<br />
<br />
We're not asking to be almighty soloers.  We asking to either be needed in exp groups again, OR be soloable to make up for the fact that we're NOT NEEDED in exp grind groups.<br />
<br />
If there's a cleric in the zone, people won't invite clerics to group.  ONE cleric can satisfy the rez requirements.  Although, I will say this, it's nice to be that one cleric in the zone if you're greeedy.  &quot;100pp for a rez!&quot;  &quot;okay, fine!  200pp for a rez!&quot;  Why don't you have your own cleric?  One of two answers, either &quot;none available&quot; read: the comp I have the bot cleric on broke down yesterday, darn it; or &quot;Don't need one.&quot;  <br />
<br />
The second answer is more and more common now.<br />
<br />
<br />
Warriors have that lovely BP that heals them.  Most high end warriors have over 4K HPs, and 1200 AC.  In exp groups, two heals from a druid or shaman is all that's required through the whole fight, IF it's only the warrior and the druid/shaman.<br />
<br />
<br />
So, you're not listening to us, just like Verant.<br />
<br />
<br />
Verant and you, &quot;You're supposed to group ALL THE TIME, so SHUT UP.&quot;<br />
<br />
Us, &quot;We can't find groups anymore, we're not needed in exp groups.&quot;<br />
<br />
Verant, &quot;Stop whining, you're the class that makes or breaks raids.&quot;<br />
<br />
Us, &quot;But how are we supposed to level up to where we CAN raid?&quot;<br />
<br />
Verant, &quot;Group, DUH.&quot;<br />
<br />
Us, &quot;With WHO?  NO one needs us anymore!&quot;<br />
<br />
Verant, &quot;Um, rangers still need you.  Oops, better fix that, too.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
Clerics have NO choice but to group, and contrary to stupid people, there's NOT ALWAYS A GROUP AVAILABLE.<br />
<br />
Now do you understand?  We don't wanna infringe on other's ability to solo, we just want to still play when 3 hours of traveling to different zones leaves us STILL ungrouped.  No, that's NOT too much to ask.</div></div><hr />

&lt;snip&gt;i dont know that i can agree that the cleric class is broken. i've never heard anyone over my guild say 'omg, we cant do this raid because we dont have enough shadowknights' or 'goddammit, why cant more druids log in?' people are complaining that too many classes solo and our role has been eliminated from exp groups, but that doesn't seem to hold much weight in velks when every second line is 'cleric needed in frenzy' or 'tents looking for high-lvl cleric, PST'. &lt;snip&gt;<br />

Therein lies the problem.  As long as people feel that &quot;desired in raids&quot; == &quot;desired period&quot; the class will stay as it is.  I could put daily rants on the front page, but instead of a huge wave of support I'd be written off as a crank.  <br />
<br />
Somehow when the game came out I must have missed the part that said &quot;And although at level 60 you'll no longer be needed for groups, you WILL be needed when 75 of your CLOSEST FRIENDS need one more CHeal bitch in the chain of CHeal bitches.&quot;<br />

<br />
perhaps we hunt in different zones or perhaps there are differences between our severs. I disagree with this statement, though. it is very rare that i see a group in velks tents or seb disco's without a cleric. If a group is using another class to heal in any area with a large amount of uncontested spawns then they are fighting inefficiently. The only situation i would consider not using a cleric to heal would be one where there arn't enough spawns to require much healing. I've always held fast to the belief that if the cleric is ever at full mana then the puller isn't pulling fast enough, and i dont believe that shamans or druids could ever compare to the healing output of the cleric. in terms of mana efficiency, there is nothing more efficient then a complete heal on the main tank. a druid or shaman simply couldn't keep up with that level of healing and, if you constantly pulled so the healer never reaches full mana, a cleric is simply more efficient then any other healer in a group situation. <br />
<br />
&quot;&quot;You took up druids and necros as example of people who are not valued on raids but can solo, well so can monks and I cant remember they having problems? &quot;&quot;<br />
<br />
this isn't a fair comparison, though, because a monk's ability to solo is purely based on his or her equipment. a monk with an SoD, fungi and a healing item will solo much better then a monk with 'average' equipment for a lvl 60. druids and necro's, on the other hand, only really need their spells. equipment does help their soloing efficiency, but it does not make or break them in the same way. simularly, cleric's solo'ing efficiency is based on their equipment, and, while not everyone has a manastone, not every monk has the gear to efficiently solo either.<br />
<br />
&quot;&quot;Clerics dont need high mana high damage undead DDs, our undead DDs are atm equal to our LIVE DDs &quot;&quot;<br />
<br />
you actually have a point with this, and i'm sorry for misrepresenting. there used to be a power difference in terms of mana efficiency and i thought there still was, but judgement is 2.8 damage/pt of mana and exile undead is 3 damage/pt. upgraded damage on undead nukes have apparently gone live on test, though, so we might see a return of cleric undead domination in the near future<br />
<br />
&quot;&quot;Warriors have that lovely BP that heals them. Most high end warriors have over 4K HPs, and 1200 AC. In exp groups, two heals from a druid or shaman is all that's required through the whole fight, IF it's only the warrior and the druid/shaman.&quot;&quot;<br />
<br />
yeah but at what speed are the two heals required? natures touch is a 978 pt heal and chloroblast is a 400pt heal, both of which are at horrible efficiencies. if the 5k hp tank is taking only 1500 damage per fight then, as a cleric, you could just wait two fights and do a CH for 3k hp at only 2/3'rds the mana. if you're pulling fast enough to keep the healers below full mana, then using a shaman or druid to heal will LIMIT how much you can safely pull and thus limit the efficiency of the group. as i said above, i dont know where you hunt or perhaps my server is different from your own. or perhaps you have poor luck in finding groups... but i've found that people generally realize the efficiency of clerics healing. as far as i'm concerned, if the puller isn't pulling mobs fast enough to take advantage of the healing efficiency of the cleric, the exp is probably going too slow to make the group worthwhile in the first place.  <br />

Join the club.  http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/frown.gif<br />
It's really hard not to be these days. I just stopped fighting the system and gave in and pay for a second account now. My former roommate no longer plays so I have a warrior twink I am PLing up for those times I cannot find an exp group or I have a ton of caster friends on but no tanks (warriors are pretty sick of their class too it seems).<br />
<br />
 I THINK CLERICS ARE JUST TOO COMPLACENT OR MEEK AND MILD<br />
I'll take None of the Above. Our problem is apathy and/or fear. Everytime any class speaks of improvements some naysayer comes in and howls &quot;STOP COMPLAINING YOU IDIOTS! Remember the necros?&quot;<br />
<br />
Imagined or not, necros complained and went through the nerf grinder. I mean they didn't just get hit with the nerf stick, they got beat down with it. In all honesty I think Verant did it just to try and shut people up. The message got through: complaints = nerf.<br />
<br />
If you don't think it happens still look at Ragefire and tell us we're better off after complaining.<br />
<br />
 Lets define something first. NEED for a cleric and someone asking for a cleric at start. I dare say short of Second floor Ssra elite (unslowable 300s hitting) and deep CT so is there no need for a cleric. Clerics are no longer NEEDED, they where not really needed before SoV but you would be crawling along at a horrible pace going deep without them, now you dont NEED a cleric. You might want one around to ress you if you die but a Paladin can do that for you and the Shaman can slow and Torpor and paladin help heal you. Is that a good thing? Well depends from what view you got. That kind of need is not because they NEED it but because they percived and might I say stupid. So many people hang up on the 6%, 6% that is equal to 15 min in a normal exp group. They dont need a cleric, they need someone to learn them about how to play more efficent (talking pick up groups).<br />
<br />
I don't think I could have said it better myself.<br />
<br />
 I dont WANT live DDs, I want big undead DDs so the dead run away screaming like little children when they see me.<br />
<br />
Used to feel this way until I realized something: Verant hates specialty spells. Verant hands them out like candy and then forgets to give you mobs to use them on. Dracoliche, the big undead dragon? Nope... Xenovorash, the monk epic final guy? Not him either. How about necros and their plant nukes in PoG? Druids and anti-summoned nukes? When was the last time you used IvU? What happened to the Unrest-esque zones at the high end?<br />
<br />
I'd settle for being the master blasters of undead if I thought Verant would give us a zone where we could use them effectively. As it is, there's The Grey and... The Grey. And you have to already have an EB item OR someone to cast EB on you. Acrylia is the same way... gotta run through live areas (there's that pesky no-invis thing again) to get to the undead. Weee...<br />
<br />
If we're gonna push for soloing then we have to push for LIVE nukes. And even if we didn't want to solo, when was the last time you got a beatdown by a green mob while running through a zone? There's that no-travel-ability again...<br />
<br />
 i must digress, though, for those who complained about the solo'ing power of clerics. If solo'ing is an issue, why start a cleric? i cannot think of another class more group-reliant then a cleric, and, to be honest, i consider that a strength. we've effectivly sacraficed our solo'ing ability in favor of invaluability in groups and raids, and i think thats a fair trade-off. Necro's and druids, who are argueably two of the best solo'ing classes often find it difficult to find groups as their class seems to have made the opposite trade off.<br />
<br />
I've been playing a cleric for 3 years and some here have been playing longer than that. Care to ask me that again?<br />
<br />
The &quot;tradeoff&quot; never happened. In fact, if you look at the melee balancing you saw the same thing happen to warriors that has happened to us: as a &quot;core&quot; class everyone else is being brought up to our level while our relative power remains unchanged. Other classes are being brought up to our level in healing. While it's laudable, many think we don't need anything new in return.<br />
<br />
My final comment is this: If you need to see how bad the mudflation is, look at the epic. EVERY OTHER EPIC was made EASIER to get EXCEPT clerics. In fact, ours was NERFED. When epics came out, ours was considered the second easiest. Now, everyone doing epic stuff goes &quot;I am so glad I am not doing the cleric epic&quot;.<br />
<br />
Where's the tradeoff? When do we get some kind of reward for having stuck with this class for 3+ years? We are the class that has kept EQ going. We are the ones who dealt with the downturns and have tried our best to only deal with major issues as they arose. I don't think it's unfair at all to ask that we be given the soloability that every other class already has.<br />

At the same time that the number of clerics on your server are enough to do raids with, too.<br />
<br />
The rest of us live in the real world, where people just want to play, and they fill the group as fast as they can with &quot;a tank, a healer, and the rest, oh, a chanter if we can get REALLY lucky, too&quot;.  <br />
<br />
Where they're less worried about waiting to be maximumally efficient and more worried about getting to play AT ALL today.<br />
<br />
Where there are more bot clerics on a raid than there are real clerics, and where you can't get exp groups because of either bot clerics, or the simple fact that not every camp in EQ is frenzy or lower dogs in Velks, or guardians in Chardok, or whatever.<br />
<br />
Welcome to the real world where expedience wins over perfection, and life goes on.  Where clerics are NOT needed unless you're on a raid, or in one of what- 5? spots that druids and shamans can't keep up in an exp grind...<br />
<br />
Little taste of reality; most groups are NOT made up of 1 Cleric, 1 Enchanter, 1 Warrior, 1 Wizard/Druid/Ranger, 1 MonkRogue, and 1 Shaman.<br />
<br />
Maybe in your absolutely perfect world, they are.  But the rest of the world is stuck in reality, and as they say, there are times that reality bites.<br />
<br />
Pull the old head out of the sand, stop seeing things that are only going on in your guild or your group of friends, and look around at what other people are experiencing.  People aren't saying it just because it sounds like fun, they're saying it for a reason.<br />
<br />
I can almost always get a group, but that's because I ALWAYS create them, and drag friends from half-way around the world to come group with me.  I often group with other clerics, because they're my friend, and it sucks to see a friend frustrated and angry because they've been running around (as hard as it is for clerics to get around) for over an hour now, have checked all the 'hot spots', and still can't get a group.<br />
<br />
Wakey wakey.  Clerics aren't always able to get a group.  I said it once, I'll say it again.<br />
<br />
How are we supposed to get enough clerics for a raid?  Well, with bot clerics, of course, all our real clerics are too low.  &quot;Hey, anyone got room for a cleric?&quot;  &quot;no, sorry, got one&quot;  &quot;oh, cool, who is it?&quot;  &quot;so-and-so's bot cleric.  gotta level him up so we have enough clerics for raids, ya know.&quot;<br />
<br />
THERE's a significant reality for you, and one of the main reasons I now refuse ALL requests to guild.  You get begged for rezes, and refused groups.  You get hounded to raid/help with epics/etc.  but when it's exp grind time, the group spots are all taken by &quot;my new cleric twink&quot; bot cleric that MUST be leveled up, because we don't have enough clerics...<br />
<br />

I wholeheartedly agree on the LGuk bit (especially since I don't have to drop my FT1 necklace for the lame EB one like in The Grey). If I didn't want more variety out of EQ I could probably live down there with my Hammer of the Sun. Pick up some nice twink/sell items to boot. Exp and cash, can't beat it. Sad thing is you still need an item to really effectively solo down there. If I had a manastone I could mow stuff down left and right.<br />

I'm a casual player so I am usually only logged on for 1 to 2 hours at a time. I can not afford to waste 45 minutes LFG without getting a least a minimal amount of XP. One strategy I developed was to solo with my pally while waiting for a group to come free for my cleric. But that only works if both chars are roughly the same level, and recently my pally has fallen behind. So I have resorted to the tactic many EQ players have resorted to: I have created a bot-cleric on a second account and I am now leveling her so that I can pair her with my pally full time. I would prefer to just play on one comp, but the reality is as a cleric LFG I'm limited to a handful zones while my pally and bot-cleric are free to explore the entire world of Norrath.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">dusklar</div><div class="date">07-26-2002, 03:48 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">One of the things I have read over and over is how many MAIN clerics now play alternants.<br />
I too have an alt character, but he is only level 20ish, and even when I am playing my alt, I would rather play my cleric..He is on my same account.  I also am somewhat amazed by the amount of clerics that &quot;box&quot; themselves to twink an alt on a separate account.. To me this just sends Verant a message of &quot;we don't like what you have done to our class, but we will pay you another 12 bucks a month to tell you how unhappy we are.&quot;... See the irony.. Lets face it.. , if we as a class, want to show disatisfaction with something, buying a second account isn't gonna be the way to do it.. I sometimes think that clerics are in a sense the bane of the money making machine from Verant.. Clerics for a long, long, time were the only ones that significantly helped other classes advance at a rapid pace.. advancement = finality.. finality= end of paying customers= and end of paying customers= no more eq.. I hand it to Verant for keeping eq going as long as they have, by making the game more challenging and exciting, but at the same time, our class, has slowly suffered from it in the last year and a half. <br />
<br />
Clerics do have some serious issues, and the healing.. rezzing one is the most important.<br />
By giving other classes these abilities, even though they may not be quite as efficient, our need has diminished in groups.<br />
I remember when I started my cleric it was because of the following information somewhat paraphrased.. &quot;Clerics are great for groups.. needed for their extrordinary healing and life saving skills.&quot;  <br />
<br />
I too am a bit bitter, but I still enjoy the game as well.. but thru all the long tough times of getting to the end game, I would like to see us become that wanted and desired class for groups that we once were. <br />
<br />
I know I have wandered abit off topic, and as seen by the number of posts ahead of me I believe clerics do have legitimate issues, and we also realize that sometimes we are better off not bringing them up. : )  <br />

<br />
  A group would only require a cleric in this zone when doing mobs in the castle, and even then I would say its jsut for insurance.  <br />
<br />
  If a group needs a cleric in the spidery parts of that zone well &quot;they need a cleric,&quot;  meaning they are low 50's with horrible gear, or they have some sort of pity for the cleric.  Classes devoid of any healing ability but bandages can solo in this zone nonstop without a break.  Hell, as a cleric I can mellee solo that crap 2 at a time.... it just happens to take about 10 minutes... which is awful experience...<br />
<br />
  Now If we are talking 60's in High end gear with all their AA toys, ok one group can kill the entire zone from the Upper Spiders area down and be pulling doggies.  If people forgot thier Fungis maybe a cleric would make them feel safer...<br />
<br />
Bottom line is this is just another place where most groups do not require a cleric.  i do not know about your servers but on mine I am suprised when i see someone who isnt lvl 60 with a second AA title.  Everyone is lvl 60, and these people simply dont want need or want clerics when they can solo for twice the experience.  Who needs a leech in thier group?</div></div><hr />

I got to the point that between guild raids I would end up sitting around twiddling my fingers lfg/checking out the popular zones for groups then actually exping.<br />
<br />
Till I get fed up with that and these days if Im not raiding Im either in PoM duo/trio with other casters (I like all casters groups its a refreshing change) or I box my cleric playing my friends level 60 monk who recently quit EQ but keeps his account in order just incase he comes back.<br />

I would recommend to anyone that can afford it to get a second account I know we shouldnt have to but the game has tripled in fun now that I dont have stand around LFG anymore.<br />

<br />
&quot;<br />
 This isn't going to be news - it was when I started working on this Friday...  http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/smile.gif<br />
<br />
---<br />
<br />
I wanted to make a brief comment about caster balance. Unfortunately for those that are anxious to see the changes completed, were going to insist that this be a slow process. Introducing a lot of balance changes at one time isnt a good idea. We want to keep the number of changes at one time small so that we can judge their effect without too much overlap.<br />
<br />
So while everyone, including us, wants to see the end of this caster balancing thing, we dont want to rush to get there without careful evaluation of each change. Please be patient with the process.<br />
<br />
We certainly havent forgotten to look at the priest classes. With the next patch to Test we will be removing the 10% penalty to healing from non-clerics. Clerics will still get the 5% bonus at all levels, and will still get their heal spells many levels earlier that the other priests.<br />
<br />
We want to see how this plays out on Test, obviously, before we consider moving it Live, and before we consider other changes to the priest classes. This is the Test server, so you should neither expect the change to go Live, nor assume that it wont. Right now its there to be tested, and whether it does or does not go Live will be dependent on what we discover on Test.<br />
<br />
We are also looking at some changes to help to make clerics be a little more well-rounded, along with addressing some concerns put forth by druids and shamans. Those ideas are still in the development stage, and well talk more about them when we get done looking at the healing changes.<br />
<br />
Thanks for your patience with us on this.<br />

I have read that alot of times but so far never seen it....<br />
<br />
I realy don't care what they do to the cleric class any more..I play it when my friends and I are going to do something crazy like attack a mob that is 20 levs higher then us or something like that.<br />
but the rest of the time I just park him near LGuk and play one of my 7 alts.<br />
They might not be as fun or have the same memories of the crazy things we did when I did 100% cleric, but atleast I can choose solo what ever I want. Just logon the class I need for whatever mob that I want dead.<br />
<br />
And I am a happy cleric as long as I can find new quests and I don't have to see/talk to any verant staff. (quests that I can complete solo, I realy wouldn't want to have to ask a friend to sit and camp a rare spawn mob for hours/days)<br />
<br />
It's a game and I play it to have fun with friends.<br />
EQ doesn't give my RL anything but fun most of the times and I like to keep it that way.<br />
I still miss UO but a little bit (where you could choose what kind of char you wanted to be by just training that abillity for a while).<br />
But it all comes down to this: EQ is a game if you don't like it play another game.<br />
Computer games are made to let ppl have fun with their computers.<br />
So even if I would complain about my prim class..I don't realy think it would change anything and I realy don't care.<br />
<br />
And if I remember it correctly I started my cleric a loong time ago because I read that they could rez/heal ppl, and they where the best class to kill evil things like undead.<br />
Now other classes have the same abillity and if I was new to eq today I would never start a cleric since I can get the same things that &quot;pushed&quot; me to start a cleric from other classes. (might be a bit of topic but...)<br />

This is one reason clerics don't complain that much. Why bother? We're speaking to people with their hands over their ears saying, &quot;LaLaLaLa..I don't hear you...LaLaLaLa!&quot;<br />
<br />
It's also the reason so many clerics , myself included, are bots. With a one spell charector I just assume play something with more dimensions. Besides, what better way to get my warrior to 60   http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/wink.gif<br />

<br />
I don't understand the bit about clerics not being needed.  I group with my guild and folsk that I have met over the last couple years.  Most of the people I hang with I have known a really long time.<br />
<br />
We don't go do stuff unless their are clerics there typically.  Not raids, just out and about together.  Clerics are always necessary.  At least in the groups I am in.<br />
<br />
Of course, if a bunch of level 30's go to crushbone, then they probly could solo there and not need a cleric there either.<br />
<br />
The bottom line is, if a druid or shammy is doing all your healing, then you aren't fighting very challenging stuff.  Perhaps this is fun for them, but I don't get it.<br />
<br />
I would also have to say, that if all you do is CH and buff, then you are replaceable by a bot.  <br />
<br />
Do you root to assist the chanter, stun to assist the chanter, stun to stop healers and gaters, knockback stuns to position mobs and try to interrupt them, nuke when mana permits, decide which heal to use and who to use it on and when, discuss strategies, pull by art, DA when you get aggro, ITU to corpse drag, camp when necessary and res when things go south?<br />
<br />
I have thoroughly enjoyed being a cleric each of the 60 levels I have played him.  It helps to be in a guild that values clerics.  It helps to be a person who makes friends and likes to group.<br />
<br />
Why play EQ if you are soloing?  I never got that.  Why not just play Diablo or something?<br />
<br />
When I do get bored of Tarf, then I play my lil rogue.  He is level 53 now.  <br />
<br />
When my rogue says lets go do X, and the cleric says no, we don't go.  When my cleric says lets go do X, then we go do X.  <br />
<br />
When we are fighting a tough fight, or doing something for the first time, or doing anything challenging at all really, my guild wants the rogue left at home and the cleric to be there.  Because if you add in the rogue, you add in some DPS.  Meanwhile, if you add in the cleric, we become a killing machine.<br />

The way clerics are designed right now, we are for the most part a pure support class. In other words we don't do much for ourselves but, we excell at helping other do something. Something I think VI and other classes have forgotten is, by this virtue a change to other classes abilites IS a change to our abilites and damage mitigation is a prime example be it through slow or AA or warrior abilities. Being a support class makes us more likely to be affected by other class changes since the more classes can fend for themselves or other classes can take over our role the less and less we are needed. With little ability to fend for ourselves this is where the real liability is taking it's toll on the cleric class.</div></div><hr />

<br />
In my opinion there's no such thing as pulling fast enough to keep the healers from reaching FM anymore.  Gone are the days when groups had to stop and med; nowadays it's all continuous pulling, and if you can't keep up, the group is not efficient and a change needs to be made.<br />
<br />
And, in a continuous pull situation, how much you pull is determined by your damage output, not by your healing.  You pull just fast enough so that your current mob dies as the next one starts attacking.  Whether you use crowd control or good pulling technique to space them doesn't matter...  no one pulls 5 active mobs on them just for the sake of having the healers go OOM healing the MT.<br />
<br />
So basically I disagree with your &quot;you're not efficient if your healers are FM&quot; argument.</div></div><hr />

<br />
First of all, I love being a cleric. Yes, my cleric is an alt, but lately I've been playing her much more than my main, and loving every minute. I enjoy being incredibly good at just a couple of things (probably because my main is a bard, and can do just about everything, but only in a mediocre sort of way. Likewise, deciding which of those mediocre things is best for the situation is mighty stressful, compared to the relative calm of healing a panicked almost-dead enchanter).<br />
<br />
I have to say, I am shocked and appalled at the lack of utility clerics have. Sure, we get the best rezzes in the game. That's great. So can someone kindly tell me how a level 30 cleric, all alone, is supposed to get to the lowest level of Runnyeye and rez a guildie who has died (twice) right in front of the banker? If I could only invis myself, I could have quite safely dragged the corpse to zone and rezzed him there, instead of having to rely on the assistance of others just to do what is perceived as one of my main tasks.<br />
<br />
I can do some jolly good buffs too. So last night, I thought I'd do a couple of my low-level guildies a favour, since I was only a zone away. My young guildie was camped a short way into Paludal Caverns, just past the bandits. Of course, I always keep DA and DB memmed, and I also memmed Gate just so that it was there for when I was ready to leave. I kept my best two heals where they were, because like DA and DB, they are always memmed, then stuck my three main buffs in the other three slots. I zoned into Paludal. Knowing how fierce the GREEN con bandits are, and knowing I had no offensive spells memmed, I carefully attempted to avoid them. Doh! Two green bandits on me! I started up my melee attack. The first green recondite bandit lost about half a bubble of health before I, on less than 2 bubbles, chose to gate in an attempt not to train the group camped in the corridor to zone.<br />
<br />
Behold the uber travel (and melee) abilities of the cleric! Thank Tunare that I have rez... at least I can rez myself when I get into trouble in a zone designed for people half my level.<br />
<br />
Enough about the travel abilities... what about the rest? Well yes, I'd like to be able to solo a bit. Like many others, I am a casual player and therefore don't like to join a group when I can only stay 45 minutes. I am fortunate, because I can solo with my bard instead, but I do feel for those who would like to have a few more options with their cleric, particularly when the cleric is their main. If every other class can do it... why can't we? What makes clerics so special?<br />
<br />
Other than the above, I don't see too much of a problem with the cleric class itself. The problem I do see is with the cleric relative to other classes. As the other classes increase in power while the cleric stays stagnant, it is the same outcome as if all other classes had stayed the same and the cleric was whacked with the nerf bat. I don't think this will ever change, because the root of the problem is the design of the game, not the power of each class. To change the game would be prohibitive, and doubtless would wreck countless things, so Verant continues to fiddle with the classes and a few select mobs in a last desperate effort to keep some semblance of a challenge in the game. I don't think it can go on much longer.  http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/frown.gif</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'm sick and tired of feeling like I'm leeching xp from my friends because they could kill only slightly slower but be getting solo xp.<br />
<br />
I'm sick and tired of our job being so simplistic and 1 button that huge numbers of Clerics are bots.  Either retired and now rez bots, or bots grown to be part of a cheal chain or raid support.<br />
<br />
I'm sick and tired of hearing about how CHeal broke the game.  It did ******* not.  CH is fine, this game is about Risk Vs Reward.  Thats what every encounter/loot is supposed to be based on.  Therefore in XP terms Snare in all it's forms castable by at least 5 classes as a spell and proc'd by many others on weapon effects breaks the game.  The cheal spell was in original EQ and everything was fine, CH broke the game is a lame excuse others use get themselves made more powerful and to minimize our misgivings with class.<br />
<br />
I'm sick and tired of other classes trying to measure up to us.  If they want to be healers, than make a cleric, if they want to have some healing power and lot of other cool things to play with, make one of the other classes.<br />
<br />
I'm sick and tired of Verant doing nothing for us because they are to busy giving everyone else new toys.  There's so much variety they could do on healing.  Faster heals for more mana.  Percentage based heals, more heal's with secondary effects like Mana regen or Poison/Disease cure components.<br />
<br />
I could go on but I'm getting sick and tired of ranting about being a cleric... hence Grumbles is retired and has been for some time.  HOWEVER, my Wizard is 59 and kicks ass, was never really group friendly as a class but when I couldnt find a group I could ALWAYS find things to kill.  And getting to them is the click of a button.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">latpow</div><div class="date">07-29-2002, 09:13 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Heh, I read your posts and can't help but laugh.  In order to &quot; try &quot; to throw pity on yourselfs you resort to gross exaggerations and half truths.  Do some of you guys really even play clerics?  <br />
<br />
a) I've lvl'd in Velks alot from 52 - 60... I've seen very little solo'ing done there, at least on my Server.  Possible yes, but w/ 40 people in the zone at once, there'd be too much bickering over camps for that to happen.  <br />
<br />
b) People don't NEED you in exp group???  Plz get off your high horse right now.  NO CLASS IS NEEDED FOR EXP GROUPS.  Now, if I was going to take a camp exp camp in Chardok or CT, do I need a Cleric??? No...umm, if one was available, would I take him?? Hell Yes.  WHY???  Do I want to tank a mob w/ 3600 hp or 5k hp???  If my Chanter dies, do I want to drag his body all of the zone for a rez?  In a Zone like Chardok, if no Cleric is present and someoone dies..guess what.. It's Gate out time &amp; I have to go get a coffin to Summon the Person back at zone &amp; exp group is over.<br />
<br />
c) In Exp Groups, if you just CH your not doing your job right. Plain &amp; Simple, you have been brainwashed by idiots &amp; have been on too many raids.  Stun, Dispell, Nuke, MoR, Rez, They are all very valuable tools to bring to the group. Too many Clerics don't think about what they're doing... if you got a Shammie in your group Slowing the mobs by 70 percent why in the Hell are you wasting Mana on MoR... If all melee consist of 2h Weapons users, why are you using MoK ...  High lvl mobs Cast high lvl buffs, Damage Shields, &amp; Haste themselves you know that Dispell line can come in handy if you're not busy sitting there at FM waiting to CH. Learn to use your other spells right.<br />
<br />
d) On raids... Most Classes have One Dimensional Roles sorry to say. Not just your guys.   I'm sure Mages are having a blast Chain casting Mod Rods, Shamans Slow'ing &amp; getting beat on by mobs that resist more than twice or if not chain casting Torpor on those Mages, Druids sitting there doing nothing but casting support heals, etc.<br />
<br />
I'm not here to flame you guys, but you're not thinking &quot; outside the box &quot;.  If anything I'd like to see you guys get something that would bring a little more dps to a group.  A pet that didn't die after a fight, a Melee atk / haste buff of some kind, Something like that would help you guys much more than &quot; Solo'ing &quot; ability.  Believe me, Don't ask Verant for Solo'ing tools, heh. This isn't a Solo'ing game and you'll just end up getting nerfed for that ability. Ask any high lvl SK ;p   <br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tritorie Mendicuss</div><div class="date">07-29-2002, 09:33 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ahh well getting a new spell seems tricky, if we really wanted to be more efficient so that groups would take us and we would not be a siphon the solutions are still there.<br />
<br />
1. Make MoK and MoR slightly more powerful, maybe 10 hp per shot.  Mobs drop quicker, tank stays healthier, chain pulling commences.  It can be our version of Slow and haste that shammies have been so successful with.  The nerf on this really hurt the Cleric class.<br />
2. Let our pet stay with us or make the mana cost less.  The pet hits allright, but I never wanna buff something for one fight.  If the pet sticks around I will buff it.  If the pet poofs after one fight but costs 200 mana I would use it but not buff it.  Either fine.<br />
3. Agree that EB/Port/etc not consistent with our class, you can get or buy stuff that does that<br />
4. Invis or FD would be nice.  FD more consistent with our class.  We are kinda the reverse image of necros, Like Pallies and SK's, so why cant we have similar abilities when it comes to utility?  If necros can FD and have nice pets it makes sense we can too, its consistent.</div></div><hr />

What the heck is a manastone? Way before my time, obviously...   http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/smile.gif<br />
<br />
A manastone is an insta-click item that does 60 damage and gives you 20 mana.  It only works in the &quot;old world&quot; zones, NOT including those that have been redone (Hate, Fear, CT).  A cleric can essentially use it combined with cheal and get within 400 mana or so of full fairly quickly (time it takes to click all the way down to less than 60hp +cheal casting, rinse and repeat).  <br />
<br />
With port stones, the usefullness has expanded a bit.  You can port back to a home town, click up to near fm, then gate back to your camp.  Of course, that adds an additional 30 secs to your downtime.  All in all its not terribly effecient.  But without it, I would be medding for a LOOOOONG time between kills in Lower Guk.<br />
<br />
As for everything else... I love people who assume we are just whining or even lying.  How many clerics does it take expressing their problems with the class before some of you realize that there ARE problems with the class.  If you truly don't think there are, then you live in either a vacuum or a very lucky world where you never have to be LFG.  *shrug*.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Serrath</div><div class="date">07-29-2002, 11:29 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">more good points brought more. not to expand the debat much further, but i'm enjoying reading this<br />
<br />
just a few points<br />
<br />
&quot;&quot;&quot;EVERY OTHER EPIC was made EASIER to get EXCEPT clerics. In fact, ours was NERFED. When epics came out, ours was considered the second easiest. Now, everyone doing epic stuff goes &quot;I am so glad I am not doing the cleric epic&quot;.&quot;&quot;&quot;<br />
<br />
i have a feeling i'm going to be flamed for stating this, so i'll try to be as non-confrontational as possible when i state there. there exists a CHANCE, in the entire world of probability, that maybe the recent and very tragic bottlenecking of the cleric epic isn't due to the quest changes at all. MAYBE (and i'm not picking a side either way) it might have something to do with the age of the game and more and more clerics dinging 51-55 now then a few months ago. as the game ages so do the players and i know there is more people getting into the 50's then there was a few months ago. this trend was just starting when ragefire was in solA and i was warning about it then too, that a list which used to be more more then 2 clerics long was now becoming 3 or 4. more and more clerics need epics as they level but without an increased spawn time, the bottleneck would get worse and worse. with that in mind it is POSSIBLE that the ragefire changes may have made the cleric epic harder. but i also think it is equally likely that epics are entering our world at the SAME RATE as they were before and the bottleneck is due to the people dinging in their 50's. in that case blame the infrequency of the ragefire camp and blame varent for not having rage spawn to reflect the rising average level of the server, but it seems a crime of attribution to solely blame the ragefire changes.<br />
perhaps...<br />
this is a touchy subject to a lot of clerics<br />
<br />
&quot;&quot;&quot;Well, Serrath, I guess you live in the perfect world, where all pullers pull at 100% efficiency&quot;&quot;&quot;<br />
&quot;&quot;&quot;Um Velk exp.. =P<br />
A group would only require a cleric in this zone when doing mobs in the castle, and even then I would say its jsut for insurance. &quot;&quot;&quot;<br />
<br />
i used velks as an example but seb and chardok fit into this as well. i still hold fast to the fact that in a 'perfect' situation, in order to achieve maximum efficiency a cleric is needed. in velks (to further my example) there are 5 camps with uncontested spawns where pulling CAN reach 100% efficiency so yes, my 'perfect' scenerio can be and is often met. thus i repeat my earlier point that clerics are needed if you want to reach 100% efficiency. i cant address the problem about not being able to find these groups. TL's are easy to find and its a memorized trek for me to run to velks, seb, chardok in that order while shooting around tells to friends and guildmates looking for a group. i cannot stress enough that my situation MAY not be typical, but i rarly spend more then 20 minutes at a time looking for a group.<br />
<br />
&quot;&quot;&quot;Clerics don't really need another heal, if you ask me. CH is plenty.&quot;&quot;&quot;<br />
<br />
please forgive my ignorance (your reply seemed to suggest that this question would be ignorant) but what other heal do you think we'll need?<br />
<br />
&quot;&quot;&quot;And, in a continuous pull situation, how much you pull is determined by your damage output, not by your healing&quot;&quot;&quot;<br />
<br />
i disagree. damage input is often just as important and i see nothing wrong with pulling 5 mobs at a time to make your healer, not go oom, but not reach FM either. time spent pulling is time that could be spent killing and using CC to restrain 5 mobs, if your cleric and chanter can handle it with a reasonable amount of mana to spare, would be a lot more efficient then pulling the mobs 1 at a time. i'm not saying you dont have an argument to the contrary, but i think i'm missing it<br />
<br />
&quot;&quot;&quot;People don't NEED you in exp group??? Plz get off your high horse right now. NO CLASS IS NEEDED FOR EXP GROUPS&quot;&quot;&quot;<br />
<br />
i have to be honest... i didn't like your post (too aggressive ^_^ ) but truer words have never been spoken<br />
<br />
as for suggestions of pet changes...<br />
geez, i never really thought of it lol  http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/smile.gif i almost wet myself in excitment when i got my pet (yay pets) but that excitment rapidly diminished when i realized its limited uses and i stopped thinking about it. i do think the pet is an idea to be expanded on, though, either by lowering the manacost or increasing its effectivness, maybe by giving it the same basic rules as the enchanter pet. <br />

<br />
please forgive my ignorance (your reply seemed to suggest that this question would be ignorant) but what other heal do you think we'll need?<br />
 <br />
<br />
I think that alot of clerics would like more viable options in the healing area like an upgrade from DL, or better heal over times. Being pidgeon holed into a c-heal only tactic leads to tedium, and also lends to the lesser need for an actual person to control the charector. For Absor to so calously state that we have all we could ever need with this one spell makes me think that he hasn't listened to or participated in any of the discussions here. I also find it odd that he updates the druid and shaman forums when new things happen in the priest balancing but neglects to inform us also.<br />
<br />
That's probably because we have &quot;plenty&quot;. That was why I posted what I did, but didn't elaborate because I thought it was self explanitory. This of course if you was referring to my post  http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/smile.gif If not then I hope that adds more to what I stated earlier in this thread.<br />

<br />
Lets see, I dont stun and MoR a mob because that is counterproductive. For a MoR to be mana effective so does the mob have to land 23 hits, and that is equal to simply nuking the mob with our regular nuke damage to mana. As for stunning, why bother? My mana is better spent nuking then stunning (gaters / bad nuking wizards excluded but they are rare and people run around with 120+ in resists without blinking these days) because here is the kicker for you, my tanks dont tank any damage worth noticing usually so why stun away 100 damage when I can nuke? Perhaps you heared of such things as AA skills and gear above hate that do that? As for ressing in a exp group, are you drunk or something? I dont know how you do your regular exp groups but I dont kill my members only so I can ress them. I would say I lose at most one person / group and week at most and usually due to me pulling in six mobs or so or respawn while people are lom. As for tanking the mob, let me ask you this, what difference does it make if you got 10k hp or 5k or 3.6k if the healer keeps you constant at 40%+ and dont have a mana issue? Answer is, NONE! As long as the healer can keep you at above a reasonable level with constant pull so does your max hp not matter (until you start to meet some 2.1k nukers and have 3k hp for frenzy aggro but we are talking slightly higher then hate gear I hope...)<br />
<br />
As for c, here is the second kicker. If you got someone slowing so are they OVERWRITING their haste so why bother to dispell it? And second kicker 1.1, MoK overwrites any damage shields they got and is mana free from our Velious breastplate. Of course that would require knowledge outside your own class  and by your post so are you still living in the year 2000 of EQ. As for dispelling buff, umm yea I want to randomly dispell buffs that are in the area of 400hp on a 8k+ hp mob, great plan! That mana is really well spent esp. if you add the fact most use PROCING weapons or got dots, you have perhaps heard of them? They got things called dots and debuffs that do damage, go read up on it and you might be suprised what they can do.<br />
<br />
d) I played mage, cleric, warrior etc on highend raids and I have to say mage are among the most fun to play on it. But once again, you would actually have to know something about other classes to know that.<br />
<br />
As for the end, here is the final kicker for you, clerics dont have any real soloing power. It was always seen as the tradeoff to beeing good in a group and later on beeing good in a raid. If you even had touched the highend game so would you also know that most melee prefer to min max their exping. That dont include a cleric and that do include soloing in Velk (and now FG, Seb etc). Hell, we had melee soloing in Seb during RoK, Velk was soloing paradise for melee during SoV and FG now in SoL. If you dont see it then you should be damn happy because I saw it alot, and not only the &quot;regular&quot; like monk and warrior (You do know fungi+slow weapons been out since RoK right?) but paladin, SK, rogue, ranger etc. You see, what most clerics want is that they join a group so does the average exp gain for the group / hour at the very least stay the same and dont go down. And today so will the exp gain go down in most groups if you add a cleric, did you get it this time?<br />
<br />
To Serrath,<br />
Epic, sorry but it was increaes in spawntime. It went from 0 to 72h after Naggy then every 24h to 96h to be 0 to 24h(Still 72?) and then 1 to 7 days after. This means that before so where you getting on average 3 RFs / week and now so are you getting 2 RFs / week (And VI admitted that the trigger was set wrong and spawned to seldom but have yet to fix it). Sometimes you get more, sometimes less but on average so have the number of epics decreased. That COMBINED with more clerics coming up is causing the preassure on the cleric epic (and the concived value on it by guilds) which causes the frustration among clerics. The cleric epic is really close to the Freebringer or Monkie epic if RF was a 2h spawn. The one problem is that RF is very rare spawn that causes the backlog and current situation. VI hates the cleric epic close to as much as they hate VI, that is also why we will not see a increase or spawnable version ala Druid epic to solve it imo.<br />
<br />
Exping as you claim for 100% efficecy in Velk Seb or HS is close to impossible because there are simply to damn many people. A group consisting of six people can easy clear any area they can camp before respawn. Last time I did seb with a melee group (war, war, war, enchanter, me, rogue) so did we do Disco 1, 2, Disco hallway, exist, Iksar jail, two of the duke spawns from Crypt, bugs and only reason we could not pull more was because it was camped. And that was a lucky day with only three groups in there, no AoE group. As the day progressed so did our pull area shrink even more as people moved in to camps we previously pulled. On average so is there 20 to 40 people in Seb, how do you pull constantly if there aint any frogs to pull?<br />
<br />
For the heal so would I love to see a 2k heal for 800m with 4 sec casting time. Something to save a caster when a uber mobs goes for them but going to burn mana like hell. At the same time I dread getting it as VI will plan on me to use it all the time...<br />
<br />
Pulling, there is always going to be one pulling that miss to do damage. I usually pull for my groups because I can come in and do healing and go out again but I can pull in three or 30 if my CC can handle it that aint the issue. But compare the difference of the pulling if I got 4 warriors, enchanter and me and Warrior, rogue, ranger, enchanter, monk, me. Both cases so can I stay good on mana and in both cases so would they be better of with someone else then a cleric in Seb because damage done is a joke these days on a melee. And damage output got a important factor, because the faster a mob dies the less reason to slow them (which you should not do in Seb short of Juggs basiclly) and the less value of MoR/MoKing a mob. Stunning a mob that dies so quickly he lands 4 hits on average? So I can stun and maybe make him miss one hit, wow great plan there...<br />

Bleh, I hate long posts, to much rambeling in em.<br />

Yes my main is a cleric.  But please do not look down on me becouse I do not have 3 years playing.  I am one of those casaul players out there who feels she will NEVER see 50 or 60th, let alone see a raid.<br />
<br />
Yes its bad being a mid level Cleric.  Spend all day LFG going from zone to zone and find out your not neaded (don't even get my started on how hard it is getting to said zones).  I love being a cleric, I really do.  But I can't even Solo a light blue without having to rez myself.<br />
<br />
What I see is our problem.  As others have stated.  Botting.  Why get me into a group when you have a Cleric bot?  Its not that there are not places that clerics are not needed.  Its the fact that there are more botts out there.  So us that do PLAY a cleric get left sitting.<br />
<br />
Then if you get into ga group you feel useless.  I hate feeling useless and like an EXP Sponge.  One good thing I can think of about this is: I can go get a drink, batheroom brake, go to the store, pick my kids up and not worry about doing anything IG. I'll just have my cat hit the heal button every so often.  *wink*<br />
<br />
Oh yes things will get better when I get CH and am high enuff to get into a raid. But how is that going to happen when I can't level?  <br />
<br />
So now my cleric is sitting in the Not played pile. with all the other frustrated cleric.  Now I play a my Druid.  At least I can do something when I can't find a group and heal too.<br />
<br />
Sometimes I wish people/Verant would remember there are others out there who are not High level trying to PLAY a cleric, and raiding is not what our game life is made of.<br />
<br />
I could duo box my cleric but I wont.  That will not salve the problem.  That only makes the problem worse.  why should I pay Verant more money for messing up my favorate class?<br />
<br />
Yes we cleric do have ishues.  As stated before.  We keep our mouths shut in fear of the great nurf stick.<br />
