<TEXTAREA NAME="ReplyMessage" ROWS=10 COLS=45 WRAP="VIRTUAL">[QUOTE]Originally posted by Areia Shadowleaf:
[B]cut/paste from my original post titled "How will I ever complete my epic??"

As I am a cleric under the list of needing Ragefire to complete my epic, I'll leave a post and see what comes out of it.
First off, let me say, this post is not an intent to bash or flame anyone. Just simply stating the facts of a recent event with a couple of questions at the end.

Albion is not a huge UBER guild, but the majority of our members are well beyond the naggy/vox level requirement stage. With that said, it should now be understood that I do not speak for my guild, I speak for myself in this post. And I currently do not have any characters of this required level atm either. I am a mere level 56 cleric trying to complete a difficult quest.

This past Sunday, I wandered into solb just after lunch EST time. There were only 9 ppl in the zone at that time, none of which were of level to be keeping watch for rage or do FG's. So I sent a call out to the guild and within a matter of minutes we had forces there to begin on FG's. Some Relentless folks had entered the zone as we were making our way back and we assisted them in killing the FG's in order to get some of their camped out folks out of FG spawn areas. Once the FG's were down, Relentless thanked us nicely for the help and went on their way. Myself and others decided to hang out in the lair a bit and do some bugs, stone spider and the sort. And yes, The Relentless folks were told we were hoping to stay there for Ragefire spawn.

As the day went on, a large number of our people had camped out for various reasons. Some leaving numbers to be reached on moments notice. I sat in that lair for the entire day. We killed FG's again and I sat in there some more. Around a quarter to one AM EST time, some of the same Relentless folks that had been with us earlier in the day, came in, killed Tranix and proceeded onto the lair and found me still there. As they were leaving, BOOM! Rage spawned. Now, as many of Albion had already camped out, I had been talking during the day and evening to other friends in other guilds and asked for backup reinforcements in the case that Rage spawned. So I had ppl ready to come to my aid on a moment's notice. When rage spawned, the call went out and they all headed to solb as quickly as possible. 

Unfortunately, Relentless ended up with I'd say around four groups of people in the solb area almost instantly. The thing that bothered me so much with this is that I knew I had the forces coming. I knew I would be able to finally complete this quest that I have been ready to finish for months. I had not been able to do so because of the constant camps held by larger guilds that have people online at any given time of the day. 

But here's the kicker, then my question. I spoke with four people out of Relentless pleading with them to give my folks a chance to get to the lair. Told them several times I had forces in route. Folks that gave up other camps they were in to come and assist me. The responses I got from Relentless people I spoke with was a direct no. Followed by speak with so and so. I did. Again a flat "sorry, no deal. We're killing him."

Sunday night was the worst night I have had in ages. I felt I was completely disrespected and I vowed never to assist TR in anything again. Monday, apologies were made to folks other than myself, and offers of assistance came about to others than to myself. 

My question is, how are clerics like me suppose to be able to get ragefire after wasting an entire day sitting there for nothing when another guild comes in like this and has no thoughts about at least ASKING if that cleric has the forces coming to assist? If I had not had my friends from other guilds able to assist me, I would have stepped out of the lair long before midnight that night. As it was, I did have folks to aid me and he was snatched out from under me.

It's been two days since this happened and I am not the type of person to hold personal grudges for long. But I will tell you that after this happened, I do not ever see me completing this quest.

I wasn't there, but heard about it, and will make this as objective as possible.<P>Friend was camping in Sol B, not sure where, either at SS room, or Naggy's Lair when Ragefire spawned. It was about 6-10 people that were clearing the FG's every 6 hrs, for about two days now, so there was no question who was camping it. Ragefire spawned early in the morning, so the call for reinforcements was going to be tough. About the same time, another guild, more suited to the hour, brought in many groups to "steal" Ragefire.<P>Arguments abound as to who had the "rights" to the spawn. With many warnings as to what would happen if the bigger guild intervened (our guild would kill the merchant, yes I know, was stupid in retrospect), the other guild refused to back down. Unfortunately, no one received their epic that day, and our cleric quit the game for a few weeks, very close to forever.<P>This was back in December, and I know the situation has gone drastically downhill since then. Even when I got my epic in January, everyone respected the campers. For the most part on my server, the campers are respected, but it only takes one bunch of idiots to blow it all.<P>------------------<BR>Viscera Galen<BR>L60 High Priest of Brell<BR><A HREF="http://members.home.net/wire23" TARGET=_blank>Black Tower</A><BR>Xegony</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#dedfdf"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Georgia_TKR</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">About three weeks ago my guild, T`Kagi Ro, on Fennin Ro decided to start helping our second cleric get her epic. We had worked really hard to get her the pearl and she had held it for a month before we thought we would give Ragefire a second go. The first time we had done Ragefire without any issues. We ran up and just took him. This time, however, we had severe issues.<P>Quite a few clerics, over 100 to be exact, on Fennin Ro have been attempting to nab Ragefire for a long time. My guild had been clearing Fire Giants all week long and a few guilds whom I am friends with were very cordial and stepped out of the Ragefire scene while we tried to get our epic finished and go. <P>Ragefire spawned. We were screaming in guildchat for everyone to rush to Solusek B so we could kill him and get this epic out of the way. We had had long, hard hours put into this camp and we were ready for it to end. Alas, not 2 minutes after we said Ragefire was up did Defenders of Akanon (DoA) ran up and a few of their members said that we did not deserve the spawn because we were not an "uber" guild. They announced that they were taking the dragon because we were obviously not ready to handle him... obviously they felt that 30+ players over level 50 were not good enough to take the dragon. We were assembled and ready to go. We needed only to make our groups. They refused to wait for a GM to arrive on the scene and turned in the pearl. They killed the dragon, then one of our rogues ran up and power looted the dragon's loot and ran off with it. <P>Fighting was like nothing I had ever seen before. It turned out that the DoA cleric, Celex (a former member of my own guild who left for loot), had left an alternate character guilded in T`kagi Ro. She logged onto this character to look at our guildchat... to see when Ragefire was spawning, etc. That is how her new guild, her uber guild, knew when to rush to Solusek B and steal Ragefire from beneath our feet. <P>Our rogue was merely suspended for a week. Their cleric, well, unfortunately she was given the heart back by the GM not three days later. <P>This happens every single time Ragefire spawns. There are sometimes three to four monks or rogues camping in Nagafen's Chamber. If Nagafen is up, everything is on hold til a smaller guild can run in and kill him. Guilds have been fighting more and more over the past 2 weeks since the incident occured. People have been so hateful and spiteful towards others... I myself have lost several friends from the opposing guilds from this incident. <P>What is epic? Is having this rare spawn epic? No. Why can't he be like Ixiblat Fer? Triggerable during specific hours? Why does he have to be in Solusek A? Why can't they just put him out in Lavastorm? They fixed the bards... they fixed the druids and the rangers... they fixed the necromancers... now what about us? Why are they ignoring almost every email and comment sent to them regarding this horrible spawn? That's a question I hope they can answer if they ever read this far into this thread that you send them Rayne.<P>------------------<BR>Georgia Gaelicmyst<BR>Cleric of Tunare<BR>Everlore Staff Member<BR>http://www.everlore.com/</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#f7f7f7"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Dalur - Veeshan</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Here's my Ragefire incident:<P>I had been camping in Naggy's lair since Sunday.<P>Logged in monday night - no<BR>                         FG's and no ragefire.

The guides so note that I am on the camp. Now time for the nightmare.<BR> A true nightmare is camping Rage 72 hours and to have the servers repatched 7 times in 4 days so you have the joy of assembling sub 52 types over and over to keel Naggy, waste two, almost three back to back 30+ hrs camping Rage until they repatch Naggy back to life. Rage should spawn several times a week once Naggy dies. However common practice at Verrant for most of this year has been a weekly patch because there is always some [usually cleric] item they feel the need to nerf. They then do an emergency repatch within 48 hrs to correct the bugs their weekly nerf patch introduced. This is about 48 hrs into the typical clerics rage camp which puts him within 24 hrs of a Rage spawn. It has also happened during rage spawn several times. I think that rage spawn is actually a trigger for 'emergency patching' sometimes given the frequency of hearing... Servers coming down in 10 minutes please camp... just as rage spawns. <BR>   There is a rumor that the next patch will change rage spawn. Although it might change to a triggered spawn, given VI history of responsiveness to their clerics, I am anticipating perhaps having to clear crushbone, befallen and black burrow of all mobs simultaneously then port to lava and keel naggy before those zones respawn to trigger Ragespawn .... only to have an emergency patch 2 days later to NERF the epic perhaps have it cast minor heal or something along those lines.<BR>    Anyway, the week I was on vacation saw 6-7 patches in like 5 days so I kept having to keel Naggy over and over and never got a Rage spawn despite sitting on me arse in his lair for 4-5 days. I have not logged on since the last patch ruined my Rage camp two to three weeks back. I heard that they had to do another emergency patch within 12 hrs of the 5th emergency patch that week. Can you imagine the horror stories from all the other clerics camping rage that week? The guides were nice and suggested contacting a GM to spawn him for me since he woulda spawned naturally by then... but of course GM was not helpful there. VI has one more shot at my monthly fee before i quit, flame them on every board I can find. I have a 2 week vacation in June and if they go back to daily patching on that vacation so I can never spawn Rage I am history.<P><P>------------------<BR>KaiserSos, 57 Templar of Povar</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#f7f7f7"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Aldur</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Started camping ragefire 20 hours after the previous ragefire had been killed (by my guild).  Reports said that he would spawn 24 hours after the first was dead.  We clear the fire giants and then sit in the room.<P>One set of giants die, no ragefire, next set, no ragefire, another set, no ragefire.  Last set and then ragefire spawns.  Overall it has been a pure 24 hour camp for my guild - much less than average for clerics but still.<P>I hand in the pearl.  We begin to fight, kill merchant then fight the dragon when he poofs mid fight.  Next day tribunal server goes down.  2 days after that the tribunal server goes down again.  2 days after that we are at todays patch.<P>Still no ragefire.  My guild was lucky we managed I think to bag the only single ragefire on the tribunal since the previous patch since its been crashing pretty constantly for about 3 ish weeks now.<P>Just a pity that the lead gm who finally responded to my petition 4 days later (I petitioned after a server crash and we had like 4 senior gms on) responded with<P>"that bug no longer exists"<P>Might as well have added ...<P>"thank you for your time, please drive through!"<P>*Edit* Damn realised that my story whilst about ragefire aint about guild conflict over ragefire.

Finally, ragefire pops (amazing), we all enter the throne room and start buffing up.  Peridots out the ying yang.<P>About half way through the buff process, someone comes in, stands beside ragefire and asks us what we are doing.  He claims he has been camping ragefire for 2 days, and just logged off for supper.<P>He brings his guild in, they petition, the GM makes us roll a dice, we lose, we have to leave.<P>So, basically, the moral of this story, is if you dont REALLY want to camp ragefire, wait till he spawns, bring your guys in, and claim you have been camping him all day, and just logged out for supper.  You have a 50 50 shot of getting the spawn.<P>Norab<BR></FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#f7f7f7"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Boanerges</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">We had gotten the word Ragefire was up but a number of people were doing CR in PoG at the time so we worked a deal with the smaller guild clearing FGs. Another guild showed up and ran past us and through the remaining FGs to the corner before Naggy's lair. It was reckless and brutal and several of their members paid dearly for it. We then noticed a third guild had slowly begun to accumulate. Our GL asked in OOC for the 2 other GLs to send tells (by then we were already in the lair buffing and the second guild was moving in and buffing as well).<P>What happened next was cold and calculated. The third guild, feeling that we weren't going to give them a fair shake decided to move in and take him. 3 groups (presumably unbuffed) ran in and suddenly Zordak was agro. No warning, no nothing. Their GL simply did a /shout We handed in our pearl. Don't KS.<P>It was awful. It took a good 20 seconds to realize what had happened and some people were quite lagged due to around 60 people being in the lair. So when the dragon finally popped about 30 people got killed. Adding insult to injury was the fact that these people didn't have enough people to kill Ragefire and thus they failed. The second guild got the kill and generously resed them and let their cleric loot the heart.<P>There were words exchanged on the server boards and even to this day I do not trust any member of that guild.<P>------------------<BR>Boanerges Thundercry<BR>Erudite Templar of Prexus<BR>Cohort Chalybeius<BR>Cazic Thule Server</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#dedfdf"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">PhillGreen</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Did you see Absor's Ragefire reply?<P>The -------- separate Absor's comments from others:<P>Urky wrote:<BR>The situation with this very rare spawn and last part of the Cleric Epic quest is currently intolerable, and only going to get worse.<P>Recently other epic quest we're altered to reduce the intesnse competition and ill feeling generated by a final rare spawn, yet the cleric epic remains unaltered. Currently on every server there are multiple people camped out in Solb to pounce on Zordak Ragefire should he ever appear, and the tension generated by having so many guilds/clerics forced to compete for the right to spawn the dragon is intense.. and as more clerics get to this stage the intesity of feeling is only going to increase. Coupled with the fact that with server outages Ragefire becomes an even rarer spawn still .. it can get very unpleasant.<P>Please review the situation with the spawn.<BR>------<BR>Absor:<BR>Well, oddly enough, the Ragefire setup is the one we used as a basis for the changes to other quests.<P>The only competition over Ragefire is by clerics. The issues that we were addressing were where two, three or more classes wanted to kill an epic NPC. The problem here is completely different.<P>The 'problem' here is that this particular epic is the most desired epic item in the game. The problem is that everyone is making this their priority; clerics, guilds, groups… everyone. The problem isn't the bottleneck, it's the fact that so many people are trying to get this item.<P>The Ragefire portion of this quest is not much different than other bottlenecks in other epic quests. Sure, we could move the bottleneck (and, most likely, force you to start over, since the bottleneck is currently at the end of the quest). But it would still have to exist. We need to control how many of these items exist in the game, control their rate of entry into the system.<P>I have read all of the comments made about this issue. While I can see that this is a concern, the solution is that people need to get along. We can't control the fact that so many people feel that they need to get this item and are willing to screw with other people to get it. The two solutions to that are to just give one to every cleric over 50th level, or to remove (or nerf) the item.<P>The cleric epic is not going to enter the world any faster than it does. Because of its perceived value, there are no obstacles that we could put in the path of obtaining it that would retain its current drop rate that wouldn't be a 'bottleneck'.<P>Some folks sent in actual suggestions for change. I'd like to address some of those ideas (sorry, but I'm only posting the parts of the comments with the suggestions, so these are somewhat out of context):<BR>------<BR>Please have the team look at these problems, I personally don't think one voice can accomplish much, but this problem is only getting worse.<P>Some possible sugestions to fix this.<BR>1. please put nagafen on a timer so he kills himself after being up for a few days, or you could have ragefire spawn and kill him for us. (this would fit into the quest)<BR>2. Make ragefire a timed spawn, the problem with this is deciding how long it could take to spawn him, every 24 hours +- 7 hours would be about right.<BR>3. Make RageFire triggered, this is the most unlikly thing to happen but, its only a sugestion.<BR>4. Make RageFire spawn in different places, a lot of the cleric epic centers around the lavastorm area, which goes with the story, but there are other places you could have him spawn.<P>Thanks for listening to my ideas,<P>Rebounder Tinyheal<BR>gnome vicar<BR>Fennin Ro<BR>------<BR>Absor:<BR>1. No. Nagafen isn't going to just kill himself. He is one of THE epic encounters for those that haven't purchased expansions, and he's not going to just off himself so a cleric can have an epic weapon.<BR>2. It IS a timed spawn… Very similar to what you suggest.<BR>3. He is also triggered, just as you suggest.<BR>4. This might be something that we could do. But you're slightly wrong, he is intimately linked with Nagafen, and moving him and changing this quest would require a rewrite, and might completely invalidate the existing quest.<P>------<BR>-Fujin- wrote:<P>Bottom line, I would like to make three requests on behalf of the clerics out there. <P>1. Our weapon is arguably the most useful in the game, and is by all means epic. However, please make the last encounter a bit more difficult than killing a level 54 dragon. Perhaps upping the difficulty to around that of Ixiblat and the Overking, or perhaps a little tougher. Beating up a level 54 dragon is trivial for many guilds, and though the cleric comes away happy, the final "epic battle" is somewhat of a joke.<P>2. Do something about Nagafen. Many clerics out there are stuck because the guild cannot attack Nagafen because their levels are too high. Something needs to be done to handle the fact that the guild that killed the overking and Ixiblat is too powerful to attack Nagafen. Whether Verant realized this at the time the quest was implemented, they have made Lord Nagafen an integral part of the epic quest.<P>3. Please allow those of us on our final step a more feasable way to obtain our epic weapon, whether the spawn rate on Zordak is increased, or allow him to be a triggerred spawn like Faydedar is for the druid epic now. It's an incredible letdown to have come this far, only to realize that you have to wait in line for possibly months to get your chance.<BR>------<BR>Absor:<BR>1. Well, the fact that it could be considered the best available is, primarily, the cause of all of this conflict. You mentioned earlier (in part of your comment that I cut out), that you thought there might be 20-25 clerics waiting for this part of their epic on your server. There probably aren't that many of any other class working on their epic at all, in any stage, on your server. This indicates to me that the problem lies in the perceived value of the item, not in the quest itself.<P>But I think I agree that the final battle isn't nearly hard enough. However, increasing the power of this final NPC would not solve the issue at hand.<P>2. Nagafen doesn't live long on many servers. But I can see the inconsistency in this issue, if nothing else. However, many clerics overcome this problem by offering to aid people to destroy Nagafen, and in a way this promotes the kind of thing we like to see in game.<P>3. He IS a triggered spawn. The 'triggered' spawn is only an idea to ensure that at least one person in the group has done the previous parts of the quest before they can encounter the next. And I can't imagine that we would increase the rate that these items enter the game. There are already a large number of these supposedly rare artifact-like items in the game.<BR>------<BR>So, enough complaints. On to suggestions. <P>-> Leave Ragefire as he is and add another, triggered mob, that is MUCH tougher to complete the quest. Make said mob level 62 or so and require 4 good groups to kill (or more if you must), as opposed to Ragefire who has been done by 6 level 60s. <P>-> If possible, change the level necessary to use the epic to 56. While a nice benefit to lower level Clerics to get the 56 res, it doesn't seem unreasonable to me that those Clerics should be able to first actually cast the spell before using the effect off a piece of equipment. Very very rarely can someone use an effect of an item that casts a spell higher in level than the player is currently. While many would cry nerf, it seems like a reasonable nerf and would, temporarily at least, reduce the competition for Ragefire. <P>->Maybe make Ixiblat Fer tougher. Again, very high level players can take him down quite easily and with small numbers. For lower level players (say 55 and under) he is quite the monster, but these days it's trivial to gather the forces necessary to kill him.<P>->Make the Plasmatic Priest significantly tougher. Can do him with three players easily (probably with 2, Cleric/Monk). <P>I'm not certain that the suggestions above are worthwhile or even workable within the design vision. However, they are just my attempts at possible solutions that might allow more Epics to enter the game while balancing that somewhat with increased difficulty. Unlike many other epics, the Cleric epic is extremely easy and the only real bottlenecks are the rare spawns. I find it difficult to believe that Verant intentionally designed the Cleric epic quest to be so easy to get to the last step only to have literally dozens (if not hundreds) of Clerics stuck at the final bottleneck. Add that to the item having an effect that is in huge demand by guilds who do raids and it seems like a guaranteed formula for strife. <P>I thank you for your time and I hope to hear from you soon. <P>Kenneth Russo <BR>"Rayne" <A HREF="http://eqcleric.gameglow.com[/b]" TARGET=_blank>http://eqcleric.gameglow.com[/b]</A>  <BR>------<BR>Absor:<BR>The bottleneck at Ragefire would not be reduced by your first suggestion, unless you are proposing that we take that step out. As I said, I'm all for making this quest much harder, especially considering that this is by far the most sought after epic in the game.<P>Putting a level limit on the item is sort of contrary to the way things have been done. But I can see the value in it.<P>Ixiblat Fer, or the Plasmatic Priest, or any other NPC in this quest getting stronger works fine for me. But it won't reduce the alleged 50 clerics waiting behind the Ragefire spawn…<P>In any case, I'll bring all of this to the team. We are exceedingly reluctant to mess around with these epic quests. We could spend the rest of our days farting around with them and never make then perfect. So don't expect a change. Only know that I'll make certain the team sees your concerns.<P>------<BR>Absor again:<BR>I wrote all of that last week. Today we had a Tuning meeting that was mostly about this particular issue.<P>First, we can't be changing epic quests all the time to make them fit the current game. Just like any other content, these quests will get easier as time passes and players get higher level, better items and all that.<P>The bottleneck here is caused almost exclusively by the massive volume of Clerics and their guilds and friends and friends of friends helping them and urging (or insisting) that the get this item. The only solution to that would be to nerf the item, make it less desirable so that fewer people will be insisting that Clerics have this item. We've decided not to do that.<P>There are no other changes that we can make to this quest that would not simply be making the quest harder or more tedious. We've learned from past experience that making the quest harder would probably not reduce the bottleneck. Making more bottlenecks earlier in the quest would be considered a nerf, but is the only solution to reducing the bottleneck at Ragefire. While this is a perfectly viable solution, adjusting these quests all the time isn't something we want to do, since the difficulty of these quests will change as players and characters advance (constantly), and we're not planning on playing catchup all the time this way.<P>So, the answer is, no. We are not going to change the Cleric epic quest. The problem doesn't really lie in the quest (except perhaps that it is too easy), it lies in the desirability of the item and the vast number of people trying to get it (or help others get it).<P>Alan<P></FONT></TD></TR></TABLE>
