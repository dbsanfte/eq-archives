[B]Umm, the only reply I can think of, is ANY info on ANY quest you get off the web is use at YOUR risk. If something is inaccurate, then that's what you get for not following up. Quest change. NPC's change. Norrath changes. EVERQUEST CHANGES.

By simply TALKING to the NPC, he would have seen the quest changed to 30 gold. But instead, he probably simply walked up, handed over the stuff and got mad when it didn't work. At the time this guide was written, it was 5 gold. Now it is 30.

And misspelling the name of the other NPC? Big deal. Potato, potatoe.  ;)

If the guy is that upset about 3 platinum, I'll start a newbie char on CT and make 3pp for him.

No warning was giving that I have to deliver the potion at a certain time frame. Plus I was with a group, so I don't know if the quest failed due to the fact that I was in a group. But Lempeck nonetheless said that I delievered the potion too late and decided to kill me before he dies.

Took some friends with me to find Lempeck and nearly got my ass kicked and we beat his ass down. No knife drop or whatever was given to me and I spend the rest of my few minutes nearly making myself bald!<P>This was and is not cool.

A while back, my wizard friend was on late, alone and bored.  He decided to do a quest, and chose to try to get me the gauntlets of the ardent, which i did not yet have.  He was bound in perma, so he gated and picked up the ingot in the river. Ported to wc, babs was waiting in befallen.  Ported to neriak, picked up plat and found an enchanter.  He ran out to the temple, thrilled to be doing this favour for me...and handed all the stuff to the wrong npc.

Unfortunately, these sites (more of the general ones) have walkthroughs on most quests, info on all the spells anyone has, and info on almost every item out there.

But neither do I have the massive amount of time to figure these quests out. The only reason to be upset here is that someone chewed Rayne out for having inaccurate info up and even Rayne for his lost time.

Wouldn't blame him a bit for shutting it down (wouldn't like it tho). <P>Bottom line is if you don't want to be spoiled don't read spoiler sites but don't get upset if it's not 100% complete or inaccurate.<P>Just my 2cp...<P>------------------<BR>Boanerges Thundercry<BR>Erudite Cleric of Prexus<BR>Proud member of The Steel Wind<BR>Cazic Thule Server<BR></FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#f7f7f7"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Juul</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial"> <BLOCKQUOTE><font size="1" face="Verdana, Arial">quote:</font><HR>Originally posted by Boanerges:<BR><B>Excuse me, By-Tor, but why are you so bitter?
