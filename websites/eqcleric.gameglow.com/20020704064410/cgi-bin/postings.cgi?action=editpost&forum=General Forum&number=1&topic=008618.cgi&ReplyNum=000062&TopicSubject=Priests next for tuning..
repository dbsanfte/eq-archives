<TEXTAREA NAME="EditedMessage" ROWS=10 COLS=45 WRAP="VIRTUAL">Let me be frank here, Elasto.

I'm willing to bet you PLed a cleric twink up. No shame in that. I know many people who have done the same. But I find these people ill equipped to discuss the plight of the cleric class with any authority. This is due in no small part to the fact that PLed twinks (indeed twinks in general) are sheltered from the problems primary clerics face. Twinks have a better quality of armor and generally don't have to seek for groups.

Our problem is we're healers and that's it. That was fine when you couldn't do much of anything without at least 1 dedicated healer. But nowadays we have level 60 shamen doing exp (haste + powerful slow), AA skills, disciplines and a whole host of new spells. The need for healing is seriously depreciated. In a fair paced exp group a cleric is NOT needed. A druid could heal almost as well as a cleric in many cases (despite what druids say I know what heals I cast vs what heals they have) and shamen can haste and slow to negate damage to such a point where even SH could keep up. Clerics are only needed when you're doing fast pace pulls (ie AE groups, multiple pulls, etc) or fighting mobs that are seriously underconned (ie Elite Guards in Ssra).

As for raids, I normally cast Group Aego, then BAoR a few times because some tank was OOR for Khura's and then comes the CH chain. That's it! To play a cleric in any raid all you need is to be able to make a CH macro hotkey and to be able to push said hotkey on demand. Clerics need 0 skill to be played in a raid situation. In essence, we're trained monkeys hitting a button.

So that leaves most primary clerics without the ability to 2-box out in the cold on many occasions. Groups no longer wait for clerics to get on, they just grab a shaman or druid and go. Many tanks now 2-box their own clerics since all they need is that CH hotkey.

So what do I want? I was talking to a druid about this issue (specifically over the rumor that NR will be turned into a druid CE) and they said the following statement which I think summed it all up nicely
 [QUOTE]Well, clerics just weren't meant to be an offensive class[/QUOTE]

In other words, the cleric class is not a viable class on its own. We need at least one other player to be able to go and gain experience. We rely on others for travel (ports, invis), exp(damage dealing) and they depend on us to spam one spell over and over and over...

Why should I be forced to 2-box or roll up another class that CAN solo JUST to be able to enjoy EQ? Why is our role so narrow that you could remove all our spells but CH and res and not negatively impact the game?

I want to be able to solo! There, I have said it and now Abashi will smite me for it because EQ is a "grouping game". And yet no other class seems to agree with me. Druids especially since solo clericing would require us to gain some of their spells. They all seem content to let us be nothing more than CH/Res machines.

As to our undead nuke line? Our best undead nuke gets 2.9 efficiency as opposed to 4 or better for many wizards. More importantly, Verant is scared to death of specialty nukes. When was the last time you saw a 60 druid use Exile Summoned? When was the last time you saw a necro use Defoliate? The only zone I know of for clerics to solo reasonable blue undead would be in The Grey and as if they decided to screw clerics even more you must have EB, a spell clerics do not get, to go there. Lovely, isn't it? And even then it takes half of my 3500 mana pool to kill an undead snake. The best clerics DoT is now on the Hammer of the Sun. Something is seriously wrong here.

I want to be able to solo live critters. I do not want to be a wizard. I do not want to replace any other class in any role out there. I just want to be able to solo so I can enjoy the game when I can't find someone to tank for me. I want to have something else to do on raids besides hit the same ^#$@ button 60 times. Why is this so unreasonable to everyone else?
