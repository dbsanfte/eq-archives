<TEXTAREA NAME="ReplyMessage" ROWS=10 COLS=45 WRAP="VIRTUAL">[QUOTE]Originally posted by Ofbac:
[B]I had something very sad happen last night and I wanted to relate it you you all and ask a question.

I was arriving at lower guk and got a tell from a res friend.

You know, a res friend.  One of those folks who calls on you for resses because you ressed him once, they always exchange buffs and such and is really nice and polite but you only know them from ressing, not from ever grouping with them.  You know, a res friend.  *chuckle*

Anways, this res friend sends a tell.  He got killed at the lord room duing a big Dar pull and wanted to ask if he could get a res.  He mixed in a little complaint that he died with two cleircs in the group.  I asked about it and apparently he had two 40+ cleircs in the group and both went OOM from nuking and could not heal him while he (a chanter) got pounded into dust towards the end of the fight.

I thought this was strange and started heading down to res him.

When I arrived I find that his group has two clerics in the cleirc robes from Kunark.  So I ressed him and sat next to the group a while to med up and check on a few friends to find a group for the evening.

The two cleircs did indeed dump what appeared to be all of their mana on nuking every fight.  It was interesting to watch.  They dressed up in robes and were acting like a couple of mages.  

Anyways, I was a little suprised that anyone could die in such a controlled situation because both clerics were nuking full time with no reserve for healing.  I found it disheartening.

The reason I found it disheartening is that this type of event is exactly what gives the negative "Battle Cleirc" image to most folks.  Clerics can so a lot more than just heal, we are incredible sources of utility spells (stuns, roots, soem nukes, etc).  But it has to be targeted to always be focused on keeping the group alive.

Anyways, I was just curious, is the "Robed Cleric" the semi-official "I'm going to act like a wizard" standard now? If you see a robe, don't expect a heal?[/B][/QUOTE]

It's funny because it's all the rage on my server right now.  You can tell someone is a cleric becuase of the robe.  I wear my quest armor now to set me apart!  In fact, I get more compliments on the armor than the robe (Server is a little young though -Lanys-)  Only problem with the quest armor is that I get begged from more because "I look rich" (Real quote from a begger)<P>Anyway, on my server most Clerics wear a BS Tunic or the Gi.  If anyting sets me apart or looks good, it's the quest armor not the Gi.<P>Although, I wouldn't mind getting a robe of the seeker and equiping a parrying dagger to run through the newbie zones  <IMG SRC="http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/wink.gif"></FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#f7f7f7"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Ofbac</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">I guess I just do not understand the fashion thing.<P>When I need AC I pop on a cleric breastplate or a BEBP.  <P>When I need wisdom I pop on a runed mithril tunic.<P>The Gi is 14 ac and some +mana.<P>I see people wearing the Gi for "fashion" I guess when they have not hit 200 mana.  Just my opinion but they would be better served by getting a mixed AC/wisdom item like the BS Tunic or go for Wis or AC appropriately.  Seems weird to wear a key piece (chest slot) that is not giving you the maximum benefit from the slot.  *shrug*<P>I worry more about my effectivness than fashion.

I personally don't care to blend in and look like a caster.

For a long time, there really weren't all that many options to a cleric, who wanted to maximize their wisdom.  They had to run around with various pieces of armor that looked like leather.<P>I guess fashion isn't just about changing the tint of your your clothes (in your case your breastplate), and is more about looking "unique"?  I don't know the answer to this one, but I know that fashion isn't wearing 3 identical breastplates with different colors.  =P  It's more about going for a new look, or doing something that no one else has done before.<P>I have several distinct outfits depending on the situation and my mood.  >=)  If I want to impersonate a wizard, I wield my Staff of Forbidden Rites, put on my Efreeti boots, sebilite scale gloves (passes quite nicely for carmine gloves), and don my Robe of Seekers.  Then I walk around emoting <Starts to cast Ice Comet>, then say BOOM!  I do it in jest and in fun, to entertain myself and those around me.  Plus, it's nice to look different every now and then.<P>P.S. All of the above works for an enchanter as well except swap the Robe for a Gi, the SoFR for a primsatic shield and a mug, then cast Hammer of Unswerving Faith on something.
