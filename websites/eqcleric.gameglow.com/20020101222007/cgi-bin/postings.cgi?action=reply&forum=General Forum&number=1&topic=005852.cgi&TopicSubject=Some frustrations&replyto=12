[B] Aye, well, I spent time thinking of creative ways, but see what I said before, obvoiusly some might be "misguided" in respect to needing adjustments.

Maybe I could have saved me a lot of time by not thinking of all that, and just said:

"A balanced lineup of MANY healing spells - short cast times, high heal, bad mana efficiency // long cast times, high heal, GREAT mana efficiency, etc".

That was more the point I was trying to make.  We need more:

Short-Cast Heals
Long-Cast Mana Efficient Heals
LOTS more Healing over time spells

I realize that spell list isn't prime, and I'm not proposing it - I guess it was more to give examples of kinds of spells to add in.  Numbers/mana use would need to be changed as approporate.  :)

BAH!  Yall are clerics (therefore smart, intelligent, and wise) - you know what I meant :P

I'm planning on making a post for verant to as usual ignore on whineplay (But I have a glimpse of hope Absor might see it), and am trying to get my data correct, so I need some input from other clerics out there.  Last thing I want to do is post something false.<P>My post is going to be concentrated on cleric items being "too powerful" because of the effect, but that effect later being placed on other items for other classes to be used (Wouldn't yall have liked a way to buff the group with an AC buff of at least Shield of Words mana free?  Paladins can!).  It will have a few other things mentioned too (Like why every classes group buffs are dropped spells, except druids can all be bought from vendors).  HOW is a group AC buff (Even if its 1,000 mana) too powerful? If you all have any input, that would be great.<P>I'm trying to see if I can get through to verant that given the state of the game, there are things that are NOT too powerful (Like why can't donals helm do Yaulp IV?  Its only *1* mana, WHY Yaulp II (Or why yaulp at all?)  I'd take smite over yaulp 2, or even greater heal).  Why are we told that manastones are too powerful, but other classes not only have a form of mana regen, but also all have an ITEM in the game thats clickable HP/Mana conversion?  Why when they added new class armors in hate (Namely paladins), they gave it the power-status of velious drops, but all the existing drops (Cleric, Rogue, etc) stayed unchanged?<P>Anything other suggestions would be fantastic!  I'll post input from you guys too.<P>Thanks,<P>Aladain Spirithawke<BR>54.8 Level almost-Templar of Thlouxe Paells</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#f7f7f7"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">kitsinu</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">So far as manastones go, Complete Healing makes it incredibly powerful in the hands of a 39+ Cleric.  The mana to hit point conversion is 3 to 1, so after 1200 hit points, any extra health you have to convert is pure mana profit.  Getting up to 2100 hit points means you gain 300 mana each time you stone down and Complete Heal yourself.  This is the rate I gained mana with a borrowed mana stone that I didn't even have hit point equipment to increase the rate.  It is capped at 400 mana less than your maximum (the cost of the Complete Heal).  I had a borrowed mana stone with me for Fear as the only Cleric on a small raid, and after a wipe out I was able to cut the time on Resurrections in half just by gating out and stoning mana up and then zoning back in.<P>I do agree that Verant seems to hold Clerics to a higher standard than others when it comes to effects on gear though.  I think they are trying to make Clerics less desired as group members to help Druids and Shamans (Yes, I do understand how stupid it is to do it like that).</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#dedfdf"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Gniss Fleshmender</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">The new hate armor is the good guy version of PoG gear.

Reguardless of the class, if a 3:1 conversion is considered too powerful, then a 1:1 conversion is too.  Its just as powerful say with a wizard to have this robe, and a cleric to have him buffed to holy hell, and a shaman to tack on STA and talisman.  Thats close to 2500 mana that can be gained by this robe, which is almost a full manabar, whereas the manastone can provide to a level 60 cleric lets say, a max of about 950.<P>Gniss,<P>Not being to PoG, that makes sense now why the paladin armor is so good that drops in hate.  I didnt know they didnt get any in PoG.  Is a little frustrating, though, how they can 1. Bypass terrible faction hits that the good guy classes have to endure, and 2. Get Shield of Words as a right clickable effect on *3* of their armors, whereas the best cleric AC buff that is on an item (that I understand) is Donals Gauntlets, which have Armor of Faith.<P>Thanks for the input - hoping to get more too.  <IMG SRC="http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/smile.gif"><P>Aladain</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#dedfdf"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Segal</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">If you are going to ask for a Group AC buff, go ahead and have them fix all the AC buff spells.  The only one that is semi efficient is Holy Armor.   Shield of Words should cost about 100 mana to cast, so a group AC buff should be 300 mana (certainly not 1000 mana).</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#f7f7f7"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Aladain</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Segal,<P>I think what I was getting at with the SoW discussion is.  I know its not effective, but I also know verant wont budge on the mana cost of this.  VERY rarely has verant ever changed the mana cost of a spell.<P>I would take a group AC buff for 1,000 mana than have to cast the buff 6 times for 100 mana each.  I HATE AC buffing people - takes too damn long to cast  <IMG SRC="http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/smile.gif"></FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#dedfdf"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Kovina</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">I agree that Verant lately seems to be taking spells off our armor that are 'too powerful' and replacing them with spells that are not useful. The Shield of Words example actually came up in a discussion I was having with RL friends this weekend.<P>I personally would like to see some of these unbalancing spells replaced with a useful buff than the unneeded spells that Verant has been using.<P>Kovina Bloodfang<BR>54 Cleric</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#f7f7f7"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Tarf</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Here is my perspective of the underlying dynamics of the situation:<P>The game is designed for play at levels 1-50.  The post 50 game is broken.  They have consistently tried to make some aspects of the game harder post 50 and the end result is that they believe the warrior cleric combo is "too easy", particularly in regard to heal spells as effects.  They could nerf warriors, but they are committed to warriors being balanced relative to monks and rogues in terms of damage output and being balanced to other "tanks" in terms of defensive abilities.  So, they won't nerf warriors.  In order to keep the game from being "too easy" they nerf clerics.  They justify this by stating the obvious, clerics are very group friendly and we can res.  Clerics are essential.<P>So, they nerf MoK, and they nerf the breast plates into uselessness, and they admit it. If you compare clerics to other classes, members of those other classes will post bitter comments about how clerics should be nerfed more.  If instead you focus on the fact that we buff, res, and we heal tanks, in the high level game anyway, I think you will get more of a listen.  Keep in mind that Absor said that although he didn't know anything about it, he believes clerics are balanced.<P>Nice effects for armor:<P>Buffs, particularly armor buffs would be a mana saver.<P>A mana free nuke.<P>Clarity 2<P>invis, ring of whatever, or circle of whatever, or translocate, or any travel spell or other utility spell like spirit of the wolf or endure breath or invis or see invis.  Any spell that we don't have would be nice to have as an armor effect.<P>Rather then an effect, how about some stats.  How about +Wis/str/dex/agi/cha/whatever.  Or more hp.  The AC on those is already pretty nice.<P>How about symbol without losing a reagent.  A priestess can use her armor to buff without the need of regs with the BP.<P>Make it level appropriate, in other words, you can't use the effect until level 55 or something.<P>Snare would be a handy effect....<P>Even Bind sight would be better then MoK.  I rarely see inside dungeons because I am sitting at a camp spot medding.  I would love to see what the puller sees.<P>Anything would be better then what they have done.  At the same time, they don't want to hear any of this right now.  They want to hear what a great game it is.  And it is a great game.  But they are asking the 1-50 game engine to deal with the post 50 changes and it isn't working.  To get them to actually listen to us is difficult, particularly because most of the problems aren't problems until post 50 and probably post 55.  Most clerics are not post 55.  Many clerics give up in frustration prior to attaining that level.  Clerics of all levels need to support something like this and most of us are not at a level where we understand the issues or understand what would be most helpful.<P>Good luck!<P>Tarf Crackleberry<BR>49 Cleric<BR>Quellious Server</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#dedfdf"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Aladain</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Tarf,<P>Wonderful post!  Thanks for all the input.  I feel the reason many clerics were ignored in the past is because a large number of them posted things on the class balance thread that were unreasonable.<P>Heres what I see and why - some of these I'm going to post up, some I might not, would be very interested in everyones opinions though   <IMG SRC="http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/smile.gif"><P>Aladain.<P><BR>Reasonable Changes<BR>==================<P>---------------------------------<BR>Standard med rates while standing<BR>---------------------------------<BR>We are the only class in the game that has absolutely no form of mana regeneration faster than just medding.  Given that any caster class and priest class is very dependent on their mana ESPECIALLY in the post 50/55 game, we all should have a fair mana regenration rate.  I would think clerics, above all classes, have mastered the art of prayer and meditation, and should by level 50 or so be able to meditate and pray under nearly any situation.  Not asking for clarity, nor clarity 2, just standard med rates - anytime, running, sitting, or standing.<P>Below is format - Class: Spell/item (Extra Mana regen-Health taken) for their mana regen capabilities.  A "t" next to number means per tick.<P>Enchanters: Clarity (6t-0); Clarity II (11t-0)<BR>Mages: Mod Rods (125-250)(And the one caster class that isn't totally dependent on their mana provided a pet is up)<BR>Necro: Lich (20t-32t)<BR>Wizard: Harvest (L34: 171mana L60: 301 mana-0)<BR>Shaman: Canabalize (28-50), Canabalize II (33-67), Canabalize III (38-75)<BR>Druid: Form of the howler (2t-0), Spirit of Oak (4t-{Increases Health Regen by 2t}), Mash of the Hunter (3t-0), Protection of the Glades (6t-{Increases Health Regen by 2t}).<P>---------------------------<BR>Group Armor Class Buff (AC)<BR>---------------------------<BR>I assume the only reason Verant doesnt add this is because of stacking reasons with casters shielding line, and shaman self buffs.  I tend to agree, however, feel as though a group SoW or group BoF in replacement of the level 54 pet (the spell doesnt have to be added at 54.  57 or 58 is fine in the case of BoF) would be a much more welcome addition to clerics.  AC buffing is a killer.<P>------------------------<BR>Aegolism as a Group Buff<BR>------------------------<BR>Mana of this needs increased from 750 to 1500, and use 1 peridot as component, but a buff that would hit the whole group.  Again I assume they didnt because of the AC buff part and stacking issues, but if clerics are to be the king of buffing, and I get turned down for this spell routinely, then there is something wrong.  Mana regen might be viable as this is a buff from the gods so powerful, it warrants such a thing - although this won't happen.<P>------------<BR>Invisibility<BR>------------<BR>Gods can render us invulnerable, but they can't make us unseen?  Clerics need, and deserve Invisibility.  Especially with wizards getting invisibility to undead, clerics should get invisibility.  There is absolutely no reason for this.<P>Bard: Invis song<BR>Cleric: Undead Only<BR>Druid: Camo/Sup Camo/Improved Sup Camo<BR>Enchanter: Invis AND Invis Undead spells<BR>Magician: Invis AND Pet Invis spell<BR>Monk: Sneak<BR>Necro: Gather Shadows (Invis)<BR>Paladin: No Invis (And they shouldn't)<BR>Ranger: Camo<BR>Rogue: Sneak / Transparent Mask<BR>Shadow Knight: No Invis (And they shouldn't)<BR>Shaman: Invis<BR>Warrior: Invis on Cobalt Greaves (They shouldn't have this)<BR>Wizard: Invis AND Invis to Undead (Added with Velious)<P>---------------------<BR>New Healing Structure<BR>---------------------<P>The easiest way to eliminate complete heal as an imbalance.<P>I think this would give clerics a NICE way to make strategy.  I would love to have a structure like this to get out of the standard Remedy / Complete Heal / Divine Light combo we all have at level 53.  This would give us a lot of complexity.<P>I put some thought into the below, but some might not be perfect (some might be more efficient earlier than others), but you get the idea I'm getting at.  Pay CLOSE attention to the cast times vs. Mana cost.  I think having a level 60 spell that will drain your entire mana bar, but heal the whole party A LOT in little cast time is a groovy idea.

Would do more damage than good IMO.<P>Reagentless Symbols - While I agree the costs on some of these (Naltron for example) should be lowered, I dont think they should be removed.<P>Melee - Clerics are who we are because we put the life of hand-to-hand fighting aside.  The only damage we were meant to do was brought down from the gods above.  If you want to be a "Melee Battle Cleric", you need to find another game.<P>Faster Mana Regen - I don't think this is reasonable, however, I do believe we should be the only class that can med at all times standing, running, etc, since we don't (and shouldnt) have a form of mana regen other than medding.<p>[This message has been edited by Aladain (edited 03-26-2001).]</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#f7f7f7"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Aquinas</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><B>If you are going to ask for a Group AC buff, go ahead and have them fix all the AC buff spells. The only one that is semi efficient is Holy Armor.</B><P>I'd be curious to know how you arrived at that conclusion.  An AC buff is kind of like an indirect heal, avoiding damage rather than healing it.  As long as the damage avoided / mana ratio is equal to or better than the HP/mana ratio of the relevant heal, the AC buff is efficient.<P>In the case of tanks, who are hit many, many times over the duration of an AC buff, it seems likely to me that the buff is an efficient use of mana.  I admit that I don't know of any empirical tests on this point.  Do you have some evidence to the contrary?<BR><p>[This message has been edited by Aquinas (edited 03-26-2001).]</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#dedfdf"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Lhon</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Aladain, your proposed spell lineup change would be a substantial nerf in healing power.  <P>For example, at 55th level how do you heal that 4000hp warrior?  Use three Soothing Embraces over 1.5 minutes at a cost of 1050 mana?  Five Divine Blessings over 45 seconds for 750 mana?  Three Celestial Lights over 18 seconds, at a cost of 1275 mana?  Basically this means you can only heal a warrior to full twice before going oom.  <P>This system would be nice if it had been in place from the beginning, but now almost all 50+ encounters are balanced for Complete Heal.<P>I think the best chance you have to be listened to by Verant is to present some straight forward ideas that don't require much work on their end.  </FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#f7f7f7"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Tarf</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Just a couple comments Aladain.<P>Light heal is for clerics a level 5 spell.  Makes more sense to keep it there and put the heal over time at 9 instead of 5.<P>I really like the idea of an entire line of heal over time spells.  I also like the idea of some of your proposals which allow for extremely fast cast times on significant heals.  They are so fast, they will not be interrupted and the target will not be dead before they get hit.  Those spells will save countless lives.  (I hate healign corpses).<P>When I was looking at your spread, I think you undervalue the fast cast times.  If I had those fast casting heals at my disposal, I would never event htink about using the slower casting ones.  The amount healed and the mana is close enough that I would just use the speedier one.  In order to be considered, the slower casting ones would need to be far superior in some way.<P>Finally, I really like Complete Heal.  I would hate to see a post suggesting it be eliminated.  Complete Heal was not a problem in levels 1-50.  It only became a problem when they broke the game post 50.  Rather then eliminate it, or even proposing eliminating it, why not suggest that it not be used for certain encounters.  Or in certain zones.  There are zones where lev does not work.  Why not Western wastes, Necropolis etc.  CH is a tried and true spell all over the world.  And while we are on the subject, why change the planes.  Why not make the planes level range 46 to 50.  MAke them back the way they were.  Hard yet doable.<P>Ah well, they broke it, and so much has happened now in them trying to fix what was broken it will never be fixed now.<P>I especially liked your breakdown on all the classes and invisibility.<P>Nice posts<P>Tarf</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#dedfdf"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Aladain</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial"> <BLOCKQUOTE><font size="1" face="Verdana, Arial">quote:</font><HR>Originally posted by Lhon:<BR><B>Aladain, your proposed spell lineup change would be a substantial nerf in healing power</B><HR></BLOCKQUOTE><P>Aye, well, I spent time thinking of creative ways, but see what I said before, obvoiusly some might be "misguided" in respect to needing adjustments.<P>Maybe I could have saved me a lot of time by not thinking of all that, and just said:<P>"A balanced lineup of MANY healing spells - short cast times, high heal, bad mana efficiency // long cast times, high heal, GREAT mana efficiency, etc".<P>That was more the point I was trying to make.

I only got EM at 55th.  Kunark armor is kind of a joke to me.  The buffs are worthless, and the only piece I'd want would be the BP (shyeah).<P>I am also very tired of being saddled with gear that's bloody difficult to get one's hands on, only to find that it has an effect that is basically useless to me.<P>Arguably, a higher level buff on the armor would be worthwhile (i.e., Hero instead of Valor, SoW instead of AoF, etc.).  Unfortunately, it's not going to happen.<P>They believe any improvements whatsoever to our class will overbalance us and make us godlike (snicker).  I would truly LOVE to see more HoT spells tho, I'm so in love with CelHeal, I can't wait for Elixir.<P>I personally don't believe they should have nerfed the elixir effect from the BPs, but.. well I guess they did anyway.   <IMG SRC="http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/wink.gif"><P>I would like to see Yaulp spells removed entirely from our lineup.  Give us something else, a new HoT, ANYTHING but Yaulp.

AC buffing is a killer."<P>Don't refer to Shield of Words as SoW.

Of course, the more AC the better in all cases.  However, would you cast a spell tha adds 10 AC and costs 2000 mana to cast?  No, probably not, the mana spent is probably not worth the reward.  <P>So what about 350 mana for 38 AC, considering that a enchanter can add 23 AC for 80 mana and a druid can add 25 AC for 110 mana, 350 for 38 is out of line.  Our AC spells are one of the few spells that actually go down in efficiency as we get higher level.<P>Holy Armor   +6 AC  20 mana = 3.33 M/A<BR>Spirit Armor +14 AC 75 mana = 5.36 M/A<BR>Armor of Faith +26 AC 150 mana = 5.76 M/A<BR>Shield/Words +32 Ac 300 mana = 9.38 M/A<BR>Bulkwark +38 Ac 350 mana = 9.21 M/A<P>*M/A = Mana cost per point of Armor Class<P>If you notice, the cost benefit of casting the AC spells gets lower as the spell level gets higher.  Worse case, the cost benefit should remain level as the duration increases (making the overall spell more efficent as are 99% of all other EQ spells).<BR>In that case, Bulkwark of Faith would have a casting cost of 125 mana.<P>Dont you find it strange that I can cast Armor of Faith for 150 mana and add 26 AC, or instead use 140 mana and add 20 AC plus 400 hit points.  How many players would choose a Armor of Faith buff over a heroism buff?  Probably zero.<P>It is the unrealistic cost of the AC buffs that makes Aegolism spell such a terrible deal.   Aegolism basically equals Mazin/Hero/Bulkwark at a casting cost of 750.  However, the benefit of Bulwark is worth 125 mana, 315 for the symbol spell, and 140 for hero totals 580 mana.   Aegolism basically costs me an additional 170 mana in order to be able to cast one spells instead of three for the same benefits otherwise. </FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#f7f7f7"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Alle</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">I wish you well and hope you are successful in getting Verant's attention but I really wouldn't expect anything.
