Although I know, aswell as respect, that you are quite busy High Priests, and that a lowly Templar such as myself should not disturb your sacred duties - You are the only ones whom can help me  <IMG SRC="http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/frown.gif"><P>So here goes everything ;<P>1) I have held back levelling for quite a while now, being busy with my Epic quest. The regular group I had, aswell as most of my friends, have thus passed me by quite a few levels...<P>So I ask you for advice - Where can a 51+ Cleric gain reasonable solo experience? Most pick-up groups on my chosen server, are filled to the brim with loot hungry children, or exceptionally nimble minded individuals. I've tried Sebilis Groups, I've tried Karnor's and Charasis Groups, all to no avail  <IMG SRC="http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/frown.gif"><P>2) As of last night, I finally looted the Singed Scroll from the vile Overking Bathezid, now only Zordak Ragefire mean that remains.<P>From what I read on this knowledgable board, I understand that he is not quite the simple spawn, however. The only shred of information to be found, besides the "Just pack a few hunnerds' Ale and shmack yer arse down on the floor, then count the hours", is this snippet, from the Epic Guide located on EqClerics ; Spawn Timer: Uncertain. Kel posted an approximation for his spawn formula which may or may not be accurate: "At zone boot-up, do the following- spawn Nagafen, spawn Magus Rokyl, do not spawn Ragefire, set Ragefire-respawn to false. When Magus Rokyl dies, do the following- set Magus Rokyl respawn timer at four game-days, if Nagafen is not up and Ragefire-respawn = false then spawn Ragefire and set Ragefire-respawn to true. When Ragefire dies, do the following- set timer at 16 game-days, if Nagafen is not up at respawn time, then spawn Ragefire, otherwise do not respawn Ragefire and set Ragefire-respawn to false." Alternately, Aarich speculated "that his spawn is 0-65 hours (72 is the max I bet as one of the developers posted they can delay pops for up to 3 days) after nag dies. Then after you kill him it is 23-24 hours." <P>Now, I admit that I am not of the most intelligent of priest. I do my healing and drink my ale, thats about it!  <IMG SRC="http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/wink.gif"> Therefor, I am having a hard time deciphering this. (Bear with me, my friends, but I would not come here and ask for help if I did not need it.)<P>I pray that one of you can help me out, if such would be the case, then I would be eternally grateful.<P>I thank you also in advance, for reading this long babble  <IMG SRC="http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/smile.gif"></FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#f7f7f7"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Dalur - Veeshan</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">What exactly are you asking?<P>Are you asking where you should try to solo at 51?<P>Are you asking about the Ragefire camp for your epic?<P>Not quite sure exactly what you want.<BR><P>------------------<BR>Dalur Stouthealer<BR>59th Dwarven Templar<BR>Veeshan Server</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#dedfdf"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Sollwin</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">He's asking both  <IMG SRC="http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/smile.gif">  <P>Don't got the answer to either though, I normall tend to stay with folks I know for xp and that whole Rage spawn is something I try to not even think about, hehe.<P>------------------<BR>Sollwin Lifestar<BR>51st Halfling Vicar of Bristlebane</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#f7f7f7"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Hapt Stormheal</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Greetings Dalur,<P>Asking about both, actually. Perhaps I phrased a few things wrong, my apolegies<P>To be more specific, I am a level 54 Dwarven Cleric, with max'd wisdom. My first question were, if there actually existed a solo spawn/s, available for a Cleric of my level. I'm not a soloist by nature, I just loathe pick-up groups where people argue over loot.<P>And as for the Epic question. I am only needing the Heart of Ragefire at this time, on my server there is no rotation or calendar, its just a camp, like any other camp. Most people will respect the campée, showing consideration to the measure of time he/she has spent there.<BR>The approximative spawn formula that is posted on EQClerics was a bit off to me. I'm sure all of you think of it as quite simple and to-the-point - That isn't the case for me, though  <IMG SRC="http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/frown.gif"> And that is why I came here to ask you.<P>Note : Yes, I do know that to date there is no *certain* spawntimer, or trigger or whatever, I'm just open for suggestions, and/or info any of you might have.  <IMG SRC="http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/smile.gif"><P>Thanks again,<P>- Hapt.</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#dedfdf"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Hapt Stormheal</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Forgot to add ;<P>It isn't that I think the approx. formula wrong, its just that I don't understand it. *shrug* Too much ale, perhaps?  <IMG SRC="http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/wink.gif"><P>I'm asking for a translation of it  <IMG SRC="http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/smile.gif"><P>Thanks,<P>- Hapt.</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#f7f7f7"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Dalur - Veeshan</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">At 54, you can solo effectively outside Karnors on the Drolvarg Ragers.  Occasionally you will find some of the chickens (Petrified? or something along those lines cockatrices).  They will occasionally be blue to you.<P>Inside Karnors - the Drolvarg bodyguards? (can't remember name) will be blue, but hit pretty hard and have a lot of HP.  The Drolvarg sentries will be half blue and half high green.<P>Skelies are fairly easy to solo.  Just have to find them is the problem.  They tend to float around the moat or be in the back of the castle area.  If you have jboots or sow, and are careful of the other people, you can do some soloing in Karnors.  Just be wary of the trains.<P>Burning woods - quite a few things will be blue at 54.  Hornets - couple different varieties.  Ember, and Scarias(sp) will still be blue.  Some of the skellies will be blue.<P>Stay away from the tatterback gorillas - they are blue but can summon and they hit very hard.  Not sure if the moldering gorillas will still be blue or not.<P>If you are very lucky and have Sow or Jboots, you MIGHT be able to solo the funky looking teethy things in Skyfire mountains.  But they tend to have a lot of HP also - plus it's tough to pull them through the rest of the stuff in that area.<P>Those are just a few of the places off the top of my head that I did some soloing off of around 54.<P>As far as the Ragefire goes.  There is no set pattern that anybody has been able to decipher.<P>The ONLY given is that Naggy has to be killed before Ragefire will spawn.  Other than that, it's anybodies guess as to when he will actually spawn.<BR><P>------------------<BR>Dalur Stouthealer<BR>59th Dwarven Templar<BR>Veeshan Server</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#dedfdf"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Boanerges</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Having had to camp the  <IMG SRC="http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/mad.gif"> Pained Soul in Trak's Teeth I can tell you some of the ghosts around the Sebilis entrance are still good experience up to 56 (where none are higher than high green). Be careful, tho, as they can cast spells so not quite so easy for exp. Get your resists up.<P>If your server is half as chaotic as CT then Ragefire will be near impossible to get. There are 2 problems that make straight up camping infeasable (unless you have an entire raid camped down there)<P>1. FGs respawn in the lair. You have to have a FD capable person camp the lair or have a group capable of slaying FGs with you (FGs are doable with a solid group of high 50s)<P>2. When Ragefire spawns you must outrace everyone and their dog to get a raid down there to kill him. This is where the bulk of the problems you've heard about come into play. Most people don't care how long you've sat down there and will take him anyways so you've thrown 1-4 days of your life away.<P>------------------<BR>Boanerges Thundercry<BR>Erudite Templar of Prexus<BR>Cohort Chalybeius<BR>Cazic Thule Server</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#f7f7f7"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Tarf</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">You are 54, your regular group passed you by at most 6 levels.

Grab one ranger and you 2 can do the named in Trak pretty easy and nice loot.  The cleric though needs a group to make decent progress.  That is how we are made jsut have to live with it.<P>I am an expert on Ragefire after helping several camp him and kill, though no luck myself.  There is NO pattern.  It is pretty much a 48 to 72 hour gamble.  It is camped almost all the time on my server now.  If you want to for sure get it, get 6 people to camp him with you for 72 hours straight, thats IF verant doesn't bring the servers down as they have for me 3 times now as pop was close.  He can be up when Nag is up as well, and FG do NOT trigger him.  Its a random spawn up to 72 hours, no PH.  If you kill nag by the way he will despawn.  If you are on Saryrn, you should give up on Ragefire till I get him  <IMG SRC="http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/smile.gif"> heh, if not then good luck.  I personally recommend don't waste your time, its been 3 months of wasted time for me and I could of been 60 by now intstead of 56.
