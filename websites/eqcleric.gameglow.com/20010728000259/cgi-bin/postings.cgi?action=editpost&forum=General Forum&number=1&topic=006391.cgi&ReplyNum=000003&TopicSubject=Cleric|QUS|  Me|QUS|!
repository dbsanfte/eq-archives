<TEXTAREA NAME="EditedMessage" ROWS=10 COLS=45 WRAP="VIRTUAL">Arykus as a cleric THE single most important thing is mana conservation. You have already said you like doing research into things so that is your first stop, go look at all your spells at casters realm or some place and take a look at numbers, speed of casting, mana use, HPs healed or whatever else the effect of the spell does. Knowing how many HPs you will heal and how fast it works is a very big leg up. 

As for clerics not DDing or meleeing sometimes it works. not often though but if you can cast a DD spell on something to kill it right away it might be worth the mana spent as opposed to 3 heals you'd have to cast after the battle (just as an example). It's not often you will use this type of thing but don't limit yourself. Also we can tank, not as good as warriors but we can hold our own, you will use this in emergiencies. when the enchanter gets agroed and there is nothing else to do you agro the monster onto yourself cause you will last longer then the enchanter and that gives the warriors more time to get the mob agroed onto themselves.

Stat wise Wis and AC are just as important. You will take less damage, be able to channel through more hits and last longer by having a high ac than you would if you traded it off for more wis. I don't know the gear the cleric you now own has but i'd asume it is very good. Also look into your skills, defence should be maxed at 200 at your level, if it isn't then work on it. There was a thread yesterday where people would duel pet classes and have the pet whack on them to raise it up, this way the person controlling the creature can call it off when you get low in HPs. just make sure the pet is blue to you.

Communication is probably the next most important thing. Constantly updating the party as to your mana situation is very important. Making hot-keys for your heals is also important:
/cast 3
/g S-Heal on %t
Learn to use the proper heal in the right situation and let the group know which one is coming and on whom. I keep my messages short so in the middle of battle spam they can read it quickly. 

Also learn to lie..... I mean embellish the truth about your mana situation ;) sometimes you get into pickup groups that are pull happy and almost get you killed. It doesn't hurt to tell them you're at 30m when you're actually at 50. and vice versa, sometimes you will get into groups that aren't pulling enough and you'll want to say you have more mana. not meaning to sound all high on ourselves but it is true, clerics control the pace of the game and when you get more experienced you'll know when to go faster or slower and it's up to you to control your group. You are responsible for their lives and their fun and the more knowledge you have about your class and spells the more fun everyone will have.

Also watch out for complete heal, it is very tricky to work. your are useless for 10 seconds. This is a situational spell where you have to judge wether your party will be safe enough for 10 seconds while you heal up the tank. You of all people will know how fast an enchanter goes down and 10 seconds is plenty of time. </TEXTAREA>
