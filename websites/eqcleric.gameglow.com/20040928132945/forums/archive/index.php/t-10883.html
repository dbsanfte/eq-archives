XP isn't half bad (not like I need it at 60) and it's a very pretty zone. Something new to do for us folks who are tired of the same old crap. Plenty of quest gems for folks too and some interesting goodies around.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gello</div><div class="date">06-29-2001, 09:13 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">What's different about it now?  We haven't had a free day since the patch to check it out.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jubal</div><div class="date">06-29-2001, 11:07 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I didn't have time to check out the whole zone, but from what I saw:<br />
<br />
- The zone in now has one mob instead of three<br />
<br />
- HP, AC, and resistances of mobs have been dropped across the board. HPs are still fairly high though. Seahorses were the only mobs we found that had high magic resist but they were still mezzable. Everything was slowable.<br />
<br />
- I've been told that the zone XP modifier has been raised significantly to account for the fact it is a largely underwater zone. The people I was with, ranging from level 56 to 58, seemed satisfied with the xp that was gained there.<br />
<br />
Don't be fooled into taking this zone lightly though, it is still an area for 55+, though now you can do it with one group instead of needing two. There's also a boss mob around, red to our level 58 tracker, in the castle area to the right of zone.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Aerie</div><div class="date">06-29-2001, 01:16 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">SG works unlike most of Velious dungeons - rares actually have common mob placeholders. (you'd get regular sirens in place of named sirens just like anywhere else) It's possible they increased the spawn rate of rares though, as a lot of trackers that zone into SG last couple days are reporting &quot;new&quot; rare pops.<br />
<br />
From personal experience as enchanter, bulthars and molkors were pretty mucn unslowable with just tash. (and required GoK or rapture to mez) If their obscene MR got reduced, well, it's about time. Seahorses always had so-so MR - they were always slowable after tash, but still had higher MR than your typical 50+ mobs. And yes, XP used to be really bad in SG. (mobs had oodles of HP, so fast sustained pulling was kind of difficult) I am not sure about what changes happened to sirens, as I am unguilded and don't do multi-group raids down the well.<br />
<br />
Now, if those servant manatees, sea lions, and walruses start dropping quest gems, that'd be nice. There is nothing more discouraging than killing 220+ hitting mobs with 20k+ HP, only to find nothing on it...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">electrae</div><div class="date">07-05-2001, 01:06 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">My experience on two separate nights since the patch is that the experience is still VERY slow there.  The fights are still very long.  However, it was enjoyably fun and we did get a few armor gems and some twinkage look.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kampf</div><div class="date">07-05-2001, 02:16 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">This zone is awesome.  Before the changes I could never get anyone to go here, but after it seems a lot easier.  The exp is decent, and the quest gem drops here are pretty awesome.<br />
<br />
I was with 2 groups that headed down towards the sirens, and the gem drops were awesome of them.  Got 2 BP gems in the first 5 kills or so.  Word of warning though, don't mess with the 'servants'.  The icy servant we tried to kill conned even to a level 54, and had a 500pt ae + dispell... We pulled two of these.  They were mesable, but seemed to have huge HP.  Also, the melees were complaining about a damage shield on them, which our enchanter was unable to dispell.  This zone is a lot bigger than I thought.  Down towards the sirens it extends a long ways.  The farther you go, the more servants you see.  I'm tempted to go exploring farther, but I'd expect you'd need 4-5 groups if you wanted to even attempt to get to the 'boss mob'<br />

Basically you can kill the 3 seahorses on the way and invis past the rest.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jhihad</div><div class="date">07-06-2001, 02:23 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Heh we just run through.  The aggro range of everything is so much lower now, the 3 seahorses are really the only risk, and that is nominal.  I regularly run my lvl 55 monk through without using invis, sneak, or FD. Only thing that usually aggroes on me are those seahorses, but once you swim up and on the ledge you have nothing to worry about.  Just get sow before making the run and everything is fine.<br />

It would be more fun to take a group in, mid-50's should do nicely, and have some battles.  I've been there 3 times now and there really was very little we encountered that we couldn't handle (except for the icy guardians that came 3 at a time).  Just make sure you've got an enchanter and an evac'r and have some fun exploring.</div></div><hr />

Easy. <br />
<br />
1) Get SOW or Jboots in Cobalt Scar<br />
2) DA just near the single mob<br />
3) Dive in and swim slightly off to the left between the two Seahorses. There's another seahorse down the tunnel a bit<br />
4) When you get to the large room, swim up, and over the lip of the waterfall, down into the top area<br />
5) Jump up on land near the building that leads to the behemoth pit<br />
6) Run around the back to the zone to Sirens Grotto<br />
<br />
Worst I ever did it I zoned at half health because I got lost twice. The Sirens at the front are more of a threat, unless you mem Divine Barrier also.<br />

Swimming skill is the real key here.  At high levels with invs, you can actually swim between the two seahorses and not aggro them.<br />

This contains no maps, as I have yet to see a map of the<br />
zone that actually works, all things considered.  Going there<br />
and looking around is the best way to see it….<br />
<br />
Critters: [Note that only the Seahorses and the Servant Swordfish<br />
see invis naturally (and perhaps the neriads).]<br />
<br />
Enthralleds:<br />
Ulthorks - Easiest, drop Ulthork Tusks for quest in Cobalt Scar<br />
Bulthar - Easy, drops Bulthar Trunk for crappy version of CS quest, more MR<br />
Molkors - much harder, healer, cast all cleric spells inc Complete<br />
Heal.  Drops Molkor Hide for Prayer Shawl 7. Very High MR!<br />
All the Enthralleds Drops low level gems, common drop of quest<br />
gems/pretend quest gems, rare drops Netted Kelp armor (good Monk<br />
or int caster gear).  They have a TON of HP and hit somewhat hard.<br />
<br />
Servant Walrus/Sea Lion/Manatee:<br />
Easy to kill, a ton of HP, no drops of importance.  Non-agro until they<br />
see you fighting another resident of SG near them.<br />
<br />
Servant Swordfish: See invis, hit hard and fast.  Hard to Slow/Mez.<br />
Lots of HP and very Social.  Drop the Swordfish Bill, Fresh Fish, and<br />
the important (and no drop) Swordfish Tooth for the Prayer Shawl quest.<br />
<br />
Coldspine Seahorse:  See invis, hits VERY hard and VERY fast (no, not<br />
dragon hard or anything, but OW).  Also hard to slow and mez, very high<br />
MR.  Very social.  Have several good drops, including the ancient fishing<br />
pole for EB, Ancient Seahorse Hide Cloak, Seahorse Spine Bracelet, <br />
Scales which are just PP loot and Dragonbade Herb (which is No Drop and,<br />
I assume, for the Dragonbane spell quest).<br />
<br />
Watery/Icy Servants: The BAD BOYS of the zone.  Well, the Watery aren't<br />
bad, but the Icy will just make you hurt all over.  Icy do a huge AoE with<br />
500 or so damage, and debuff one spell.  They do it a lot.  They can also<br />
enrage.  The Watery does too, but it only debuffs its target, and not as<br />
often, but it slows too.  Add to that real CRAPPY loot and they suck.  BUT<br />
at least they are easy to mez.  But if you hunt sirens, you will have to kill<br />
them.<br />
<br />
Various Neriads - Haven't hunted them enough to know if they see invis.<br />
Don't know much about them, just recall them being Melee only.  <br />
<br />
Various Sirens - Priestesses are healers, the other two main types (Enticers<br />
and Seductresses) are enchanters.  They cast slow ALL THE TIME.  They<br />
also charm a LOT (very hard to resist) and nuke too much AND cast nice<br />
4 spell debuffs.  Luckily not a lot of HP, but they hit hard.  They WILL run<br />
at the end of battle, unlike pretty much everything else in here (The Seahorses<br />
kinda run).  They drop a HIGH percentage of quest Chest gems, as well as normal<br />
high value gems (Sapphires, Ruby, etc) and siren parts for baking.  They also have<br />
a conch shell horn which is total crap, 2 different runed sea shells (1 with Cloud<br />
and 1 with EB) which are for the Coldain ring quest and the shawl quest<br />
respectively, a Runed Shell Necklace with 5 charges of EB (don't need scales), an<br />
Ornately Runed Shell Necklace for the Sea Dragonscale Bracer quest, and<br />
Immaculate Shell Horn which is a VERY high end Bard Brass instrument (adds<br />
21% to brass IIRC) and Walrus Skin Drums (Percussion, adds about 30%, for<br />
travel spells they are BETTER than Selo's Drums - tested by a Bard friend of mine<br />
and posted by others).<br />
<br />
There are several nameds, but in all my time there I have NEVER seen one.  Weird<br />
eh?  But they Mistress and the other high end named Sirens are supposedly very<br />
much an OW situation…<br />
<br />
My personal Location Descriptions:<br />
<br />
This is what I call things, don't care what they call them on your server, but<br />
for this to make sense ya gotta read it using mine. (left and right are in reference<br />
to the direction you are facing when you look into the zone from the CS<br />
Zone area.)<br />
<br />
CS Zone - area up to and including the one Enthralled that spawns here.<br />
<br />
Front Pool - The water just past the CS Zone - kill Seahorses in here for you<br />
Seahorse Spined Bracelet and Ancient Seahorse Hide Cloaks (amazing).  <br />
<br />
Left Tunnel - The tunnel that goes DOWN to your left when you jump into <br />
the Front Pool from the CS Zone.  Probably 4-5 seahorses total by the<br />
time you get to the Tunnels.<br />
<br />
Right Tunnel - The one that heads to the right, guarded by 3 Seahorses (split<br />
in 1 group of 1 and 1 of 2) and a wandering Servant Swordfish.<br />
<br />
Ledge - if you go through the Right Tunnel and, after killing the mobs there<br />
you can jump on the Ledge (up and behind you once you go through the tunnel).<br />
Mobs in the water leave eventually when you leave the water.<br />
<br />
Waterfall Tunnel (dunno, the name works) - The tunnel just to the RIGHT of the<br />
Left Tunnel.  Guarded by 2 seahorses outside and 1 inside.  NOTE that often the<br />
inside seahorse will be bugged and trapped on one of the 2 spits of lands next<br />
to the Front Pool.<br />
<br />
Left/Right sides (using the terms just for this message, don't normally name them) -<br />
The 2 spits of land on either side of the Front Pool.  Each has 1 Enthralled and 1<br />
Servant (Manatee/Sea Lion/Walrus).<br />
<br />
Bridge - Well, uh, the bridge you see there, and both sides of it.  There are about 5-6<br />
Enthralleds up there, 1 is a roamer, the other ones are statics on the left side.  There are<br />
2 ways to get there.  One is swimming through the Right Tunnel, jumping up on the<br />
land to the back left of you, killing the one enthralled at the top of the ramp and then<br />
going up the land tunnel.  You will see the bridge once you turn left.  Pull to that spot,<br />
it is very safe.  The other way to get on the bridge is left to the more adventurous <br />
reader.  I did it this way before I learned the easy way (it’s far more fun).  The other<br />
end of the bridge drops into the first pool of water that you hit if you go down the <br />
Left tunnel.<br />
<br />
Main Waterfall - The huge one you see from the front.  Almost always a bugged<br />
Servant Swordfish trapped at the top or bottom.  There is some way that small<br />
characters can get up it, but that's boring and kinda buggy.<br />
<br />
Escher's Waterfall - Named because the water flow in the zone is impossible.<br />
This is the waterfall you jump over to leave the Waterfall Tunnel.<br />
<br />
Upper Pool - Pointless cept as a place to land when dropping off Escher's Waterfall.<br />
Note that there is 1 Enthralled and 1 Servant just to the right when you drop.  The<br />
bugged Servant Swordfish is often seen here too.  There is a small spit of water<br />
that heads into the Well too.  It has a camp of 2 Servant Swordfish.  If you are<br />
hunting the Swordfish Tooth for Shawl step 7 I STRONGLY suggest bringing<br />
a chanter and killing these 2.  Nice and easy.<br />
<br />
WW Zone - This includes all the area around the top of the well and all the little<br />
back tunnels/maze area.  Includes, lesse, 5 Servant Walrus/etc and about 8<br />
Enthralled's, and 1 more of each on the other side of the Upper Pool.  Note<br />
that you can often get trained by people doing the SoW and run method of<br />
getting through the zone.  Always killed Enthralled's before you mess with the<br />
Servants, cause they Servants are only XP, nothing more, and won't agro unless<br />
you are fighting another Grotto Resident within earshot.  One good group can<br />
easily kill all the enthralleds, and start on the servants.<br />
<br />
The Well - 2 parts, the Top well contains 2 of the Enthralleds mentioned in the<br />
WW zone above.  The Bottom of the Well is a large area filled with a HUGE<br />
amount of sirens, Icy/Watery servants, Enthralleds, and some random others.<br />
SOME people call this the Temple.  I don't because there is another area that<br />
I call the temple.  If you are hunting Sirens, this is the place for you.  More<br />
on this later.<br />
<br />
The Tower - When you go down the Right Tunnel, you hit the area with the Tower.<br />
If you go to the Bridge using the method I described and turn right instead<br />
of left when you go up the ramp, you will be IN the Tower.  If you are not<br />
invis at this point you will be DEAD.  The tower contains at least, hmm, 10<br />
Sirens and 3 Icy/Watery Servants packed in like Sardines.  There is a back<br />
exit which heads down into the Tunnels.<br />
<br />
The Temple - if you keep swimming past the Tower and down slightly to your<br />
right, you will pass into another large area.  Note that any large area of water<br />
will have Coldspine Seahorses who hit hard.  And they see invis AND ARE<br />
ALWAYS AGRO.  /conning them from the surface will get indifferent, but<br />
they more certainly are not.  Anyway, surface in this area and you will be at<br />
what I call the Temple.  Another small room packed with about 8-10 Sirens<br />
and several Icy/Watery Servants.  VERY hard to pull safely.<br />
<br />
The Tunnels - Several ways to get to them.  I suggest heading down the Left<br />
Tunnel described above and just keeping left.  You will eventually end up<br />
in a long set of both underwater AND above water tunnels.  Lots of Enthralleds<br />
and some Icy/Watery servants and sirens/neriads.  If you follow the Tunnels<br />
to their end, you will be in a watery room which, when you go up the ramp,<br />
puts you in the back area of the Tower (again, being invis will keep you alive<br />
here).  Halfway through there is a tunnel that leads to the Temple.<br />
<br />
There are more watery tunnels that I don't wanna try to describe.  Just realize<br />
that you CAN get to the water in the Well from the water around the Temple.<br />
<br />
Things to bring with you:  Some way to breathe underwater and some way<br />
of going invis would be nice.  Resist gear vs Magic and Cold are good too.<br />
<br />
NOW - if you just wanna get through…<br />
<br />
Get Invis, Sow helps.  Jump into the water and head to the 'Left Side' I mention<br />
above.  Watch out for the 2 seahorses guarding the Waterfall Tunnel entrance.<br />
If you are careful, you can jump into the water BEHIND the two seahorses<br />
and head up the Waterfall Tunnel.  They have agroed me ONCE doing this.<br />
If they do agro, just move faster.;-)  There is 1 more Seahorse in the tunnel<br />
usually, just swim as far down and to the left as you can past it.  Again, if you<br />
agro, just keep swimming fast. DA if you can clerics.  Then the tunnel<br />
will head UP and you will find yourself at the top of Escher's Waterfall.  <br />
Except on VERY rare occasions the seahorses will just leave now.<br />
Jump off the waterfall (reinvis if needed) and head left out of it, then just keep<br />
left as much as possible to get out.  The tunnel you want on your left may<br />
be partially hidden by a large rock, but once you find it the only thing<br />
you will run into are 2 servant Walrus/Sea Lion/Manatee and perhaps 1<br />
wandering Enthralled.  Keep left until you zone out.  You can be a pansy<br />
and wait for a Succor, but why?<br />
<br />
Places to hunt:<br />
<br />
CS Zone and the Front Pool.  Kill the three Enthralled spawns and the<br />
2 Servant Mammals (ah, better than typing Sea Lion/Walrus/Manatee<br />
all over).  Then kill between 5 and 10 Seahorses if you have the<br />
firepower.  Note that you CAN kill 2 at a time without mez, but it is<br />
tough.  Slow is good too.<br />
<br />
Tower - Not worth it, easier places to hunt for sirens.<br />
<br />
Bridge - Kill the ones on the bridge, then if you are VERY lucky and<br />
good you can try to get some from the Tower.<br />
<br />
Temple - again, hard to hunt.  Very packed.<br />
<br />
WW Zone - best place for Enthralleds, and therefore Crushed Gems of<br />
all varieties.  Netted Kelp a big plus as well as close zone out.  Either hunt <br />
right out in front of the well in the open area (watching for the 2 close<br />
statics at the top of the well and the wanderers) or pull to the area in<br />
the tunnel near the WW zone with rocks in the corner.  Good<br />
place, far enough away from the Servant Mammals so they don't agro.<br />
Painful on the longer pulls tho.<br />
<br />
The Well - Ah, the Well.  Getting down isn't too hard, just make sure<br />
that none of the water spawns at the bottom see invis.  If they do you<br />
can try 2 different things.  1) is swim all the way down and fight them<br />
as low as possible, avoiding agroing the Sirens.  2) is to stand on the<br />
top of the well, target one of the sirens and stun her (and run back<br />
quickly).  Note that this will create a train of between 1 and 6 critters.<br />
If you get more than 3 you best not just have a chanter, but a GOOD one.<br />
Normally only one of the 2 you can see will come up, with support.  If you<br />
survive killing those, stun the other one and kill whatever she brings with<br />
her.  THEN you can swim down and kill whatever is still in the water.<br />
THIS IS RISKY.  Don't try this method unless you have SoW, high HP<br />
and a large tolerance for risk.<br />
Anyway, then invis everyone, swim down and head out into the icy area.<br />
This means you swim to the bottom of the column of water, then swim<br />
over a little, then up.  You will be standing on ice when you surface<br />
and have lots of baddies all around.  They don't see invis tho.  Then<br />
face the large statue you see and turn right 90%.  Head to that wall, then turn 90%<br />
again.  Head to the corner.  Closest thing you see should be 2 Watery/Icy servants <br />
near you at the entrance to a small alcove.  As long as you stay away from them<br />
you will be safe, invis or not.  Then get your highest puller to start carefully<br />
pulling the sirens you can see.  I was warned that the pathing was terrible, but<br />
in reality it wasn't that bad.  There are little tricks you will learn and keep<br />
see invis up for various servants, they can be invis.  We found that you can<br />
pull the sirens on the weird stair-step thingies by merely walking to the<br />
end of them.  Also note that you NEED to snare or kill fast so they don't<br />
run and get you killed.<br />
<br />
The Tunnels - you can hunt the tunnels for a wide variety of prey, from a good<br />
amount of Enthralled, to a couple icy/watery servants, neriads, sirens and<br />
whatever else you can find.  Most everything.  Just make sure you are<br />
careful with AoE spells so you don't agro from above, and keep your head<br />
about you..;-)  Don't accidentally walk into the Temple or the Tower<br />
uninvis.  That's bad.<br />
<br />
That's about it.  Siren's Grotto is the best place, bar none, to hunt for<br />
quest gems in the game. Faster drop rate, interesting other drops and<br />
some quest drops, as well as usually being alone (or at most 1-2<br />
other groups).  The zone can hold at LEAST 6 strong groups without<br />
anyone poaching, and probably more if they have the guts.<br />
<br />
Remember that the zone strips lev off and it cannot be cast inside<br />
either.  And always be careful around the seahorses…<br />

<br />
Helena Mistweaver. Spawns in the tower, yellow at L60. Casts cleric spells, including CH. Has a lot of HP, not sure of max hit, but its below 300. Not really that difficult, if you can get slow in. Drops the Siren Hair Earring, Bowl of Watery Protection, and something else I don't know of.<br />
<br />
Shimmering Servant (or similar). Spawns in any Icy servant spot inzone (so I've heard). Not that hard from what I remember, similar to a regular Icy. Drops Wavecrasher, Drums of the Beast, and Shield of the Tsunami.<br />
<br />
Mistress Latazura. She is a badass, maxes for 360 or so, and casts cleric spells. She is red at L60. Need to stick slow, or you will have big problems. Drops Lyendlln's Lute (only killed her once).<br />
<br />
All the above mobs were killed with 1 group (including Latazura), which included, Warrior, Enchanter, Rogue, Monk, Cleric, Druid. Everyone was 60 except the monk, druid and rogue. Once we stuck slow on Latazura she was pretty easy. You DO need the chanter to mana suck the two named sirens, as they can gate at times. Second time we pulled Latazura, slow wore off mid-battle, and we then got promptly owned.<br />
<br />
(edit) - The two named sirens spawn in the tower to the right of the CS zone, the named servant also happened to spawn (for us) in that tower as well.<br />
