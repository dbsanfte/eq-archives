<TEXTAREA NAME="ReplyMessage" ROWS=10 COLS=45 WRAP="VIRTUAL">[QUOTE]Originally posted by Kenobe:
[B]Well on the topic, I was camping Regis last night when I get a tell asking for a revive.  I say sure if you can drag em to me so I don't loose my camp.  They then ask for my loc 3 times... 10 mins later another where are you again?  So I do a /who name to see who and where they both are.  The one dragging the corpse is leve 3 and the one he wants me to revive is in Qeyhills and LEVEL1!

I didn't believe it and frankly nobody else I told did either..... got a good laugh out of it   :)

So naturally I blast it twice an the hag lays down.<P>He just keeps spamming the one word LEAVE!  So the stubborn headed souther boy in me takes hold and I was overly sweet and polite and explained how I only wanted to share and would take only half.<P>He of course was a raving lunatic by this point.  I explained how there are not enough spawns in Norrath for every person to claim a whole room, the he needs to be nicer or one day he will be in lower guk and find that people remember him.<P>I stayed to kill one more greater dark bone and then wandered on my merry way while listening to his abuse.<P>So here we are a few days ago in lower guk.<P>Ofbac shouts, "50 cleirc looking for fun and excitement  There's a new verant rule that you have to have a dwarf in every group, and you don't want a dwarven wizard so get a cleirc while you can."  - one of my standard lines.<P>Abusivedruid tells you "can i get a rez pls?"<P>Ofbac chuckles.<P>Abusivedruid tells you "can i get a rez pls?  i'm almost out of time like nearly 2 hours"<P>Ofbac tells Abusivedruid "do you remember me?"<P>Abusivedruid tells you "yeah, didn't we meet in unrest once?"<P>Ofbac tells Abusivedruid "have a nice day"<P>Ofbac: /ignore abusivedruid.<P>God, sometimes there is a bright side to being a cleric.<BR></FONT></TD></TR></TABLE>
