Perhaps you can answer me?<P><BR>It is in regard to the recent cleric epic changes.<P> <BLOCKQUOTE><font size="1" face="Verdana, Arial">quote:</font><HR>You know I understand why you have done this. Malacious players.<P>What I don't understand is your resistance to letting Cleric epics into the game?<P>You say its a powerful epic?<P>Its not, the monk epic is a powerful epic, the Rogue epic is a powerful epic. These epics allow you to kill the mobs that need to be killed (pre sleepers/NToV enabled guilds, which have an abundance of epic clerics anyway and are surely not your concern?)<P>The cleric epic only cuts down on the amount of down time a raid spends after a failed attempt, and allows a cleric to rez passerbys without depleting their mana.<P>This is hardly in my mind either earth shattering or game unbalancing. Personally if you feel that 96% rezzes being given out by pre 56 level clerics is wrong, then limit the cleric epic to working only at level 55, that is well within your coding ability.<P>I would just really like to know why you feel the need to limit this epic entering the game? it gives a raid no more chance of killing a mob then they would without it. It merely cuts down the amount of time they have to spend getting back up after being knocked down.<P>Considering the amount of effort you have put into cutting down 'downtime' at the moment, Flowing Thought items, AAXP skills to increase mana regen, New and improved Clarity line, AoE Mana regen Bard songs, new spells of exactly the same merit as older spells but lasting longer, I don't understand your continued resistance to this lessening of downtime.<P>I am not saying make the cleric Epic any easier, I know and have helped several clerics from start to finish with their epic, its no easier then any other right now, but just make ragefire a spawn like some other epic mobs, once a Day EQ time, or in the case of the monk epic, every few hours.<P>Or atleast explain why you feel that this epic is worth so much more in a way I and I believe most clerics can understand.<HR></BLOCKQUOTE></FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#f7f7f7"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Napper</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">The cleric epic is not hard in any event compared to others.<P>Warriors have Sev to camp, SK's have Llranc, Wizards have Phini and VS, etc etc. Point is most epics have a timed spawn of 3 days at least.<P>The question is the same as why first brood dragons don't spawn daily.

From what i gathered from the raid i was on the other night.<P>Also from what I remember, do you not have the plasmatic priest to camp?

Even with 4 58= cleric to Ch chain and plenty of druids to help keep health up, it was ugly.

The best example is for bosses with an obscene number of hit points and a strategy often called "zerg rush".  There are many variations, but it basically involves rezzing melee during a fight over and over (with sticks) to bring down the mob.  One warrior I know died 10 times to Cazic Thule this way.   Ughh.<P>You are right, for normal expected use, the cleric epic is hardly overpowering, but when considered this way, the cleric epic *is* more powerful than any other.</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#dedfdf"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Aean</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">ahhhh yes my friends. yet one more reason I am waiting for this <A HREF="http://www.blizzard.com/wow/" TARGET=_blank>http://www.blizzard.com/wow/</A> <P>Soon I shall no longer have to deal with VI BS and enjoy long hours of carefree gaming from a company who has never let me down <IMG SRC="http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/smile.gif"><P>I just wish that one time I could be in a board room meeting at verrant just so I can hear them as they come up with these ideas, and then I would berate them in the most insideous manner. stinkin bunch of turd burglers:P</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#f7f7f7"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Aladain</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial"> <BLOCKQUOTE><font size="1" face="Verdana, Arial">quote:</font><HR>Originally posted by Saibho Wu:<BR><B>Monk epic spawns hourly.

It also allows quick rezzing of people to come back to protect me in the case of wandering mobs or repops.  Also, it allows you to rez-during-battle, which is a tactic some people use.<P>I dont disagree with you ~ the cleric epic should have had the whole ragefire BS redesigned.  BUT, while our epic has a few rare spawns, keep this in mind:<P>- Our epic items drop ALL the time off the mobs WHEN they pop.<BR>- We dont have to kill a kunark level dragon or go to a plane.<BR>- The most difficult part is Chardok Overking, which now that Chardok is on faction, can be done with no risk with a +chardok cleric and +chardok coh mage around.  Wipeout?  np, have cleric drag corpses.<P>My point is - our epic is pathetically easy, there is just a time constraint at the end.  Asking Verant to make this easier wont work - they have the time constraint and ragefire to be a PAIN in the ass in order to "offset" the easyness of our epic.<P>What if ragefire was a 24 hour spawn every time, but bergurgle, glimblox, and chardok overking dropped their epic items one in ten times.

Easy in terms of the force it takes to knock out the mobs?  Ok, I'll grant that.  <P>Easy in terms of time invested?  No.  And now a new level of horror, the additional camp added to the epic, as if camping in Lake Rathe, Sol A and Sol B weren't enough.  And the horror of adding a hugely contested mob with an even longer spawn rate.  <P>I've done two epics now.  Rogue and cleric.  Cleric just utterly sucked.  It was boring, it was frustrating.  It took me 4 months days, and weeks of camping, to complete after I got to the last stage.  Rogue epic was fun.  I got to use my rogue skills to acquire it.  The general fight was a blast.  But I did get very, very lucky on getting a Kedge robe on my first try.

The thing is, each of these raids require a full raid force to kill, but our items drop EVERY time from those mobs.  Does the green scale drop every time off serv?  Does the white scale drop every time off Gore, or vox (if the bard has decided to NOT LEVEL past 52)?  That is my point - These "3 full raid" encounters are fairly easy (minus chardok), and the pieces drop *EVERY* time.  The guild I run is not an uber guild, but we have a good number of 55+ people.  We killed ixiblat yesterday with 3 clerics (though 2 for 99% of the fight) and 18 other people in about 45 seconds with 1 death (me right at the beginning - misagroed with a CH and died fast).<P> <BLOCKQUOTE><font size="1" face="Verdana, Arial">quote:</font><HR>I can do the entire monk epic with one group, infact I did, the only part you need more then one group for is the final battle, which takes two groups just to be sure.<HR></BLOCKQUOTE><P>True, and look at the reward for the monk epic.

How much more damage will an epiced monk do vs. a monk with say an IFS with Shissar and shammy buffs?  Will they do an absorbiant amount of additional damage?  I'll give you on the rogue epic, but the rogue epic has its fair share of bottlenecks.  Phinny is a pain in the ass, contested since what, 4 class epics drop off him?

Raids fail, even the best guilds on any server will get their arse handed to them on occasions.  It happens substancially less on stuff you have killed multiple times before (although can happen if ya sloppy), but on new things that are not insignificant the chance of getting your arse handed to you is significant.<P>You can read strategy pages the web over, until you try something for yourself, you will not appreciate what you have to do until you actually get out there, and try it.<P>It lets you try something, pick yourself up after you got dead, think of what you did wrong and try again.<P>Persistance is definitely a virtue in this game and the cleric epic lets you try and try again on mobs that are not trivial to your guild.

It should involve difficult fights requiring lots of the persons friend to assist.  <BR>(Most have become trivial as more people get to level 60)<P>3.

We have to wait to buy a car or house until we have the money and financing.
