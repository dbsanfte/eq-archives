I reached level 30 2 days ago, and have been fighting giants at the fort in Frontier Mountains in groups of 4 to 6 people.  The exp is terribly slow.  I understand that 30 is a hell level, but I am wondering if there are better exp places I can try.  I figure that the loot at these giants is pretty good, so the exp is probably lower than other places.<P>Any ideas?<P>Thanks<BR></FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#f7f7f7"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Dalur - Veeshan</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Depends if you have keys and such for Vellious.<P>I had a druid friend that was working on his halfling tailering.  I was killing spiders in Crystal Caverns to collect silks for his tailering work.<P>I started the week on monday night with a half yellow bubble in 31 on my warrior.<P>By the following Thursday night, I was 1 yellow bubble into level 36.<P>Granted the xp won't move that fast with a full group, but I think the xp would be pretty good nonethe less.

You'll fly through experience, especially if you can get in on the Avatar of Fear.  A level 30 cleric is enough to handle the AoF given a decent group (I dinged to 31 on the AoF    <IMG SRC="http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/smile.gif"><P>I still think there is no better place to learn mob aggro in group combat than Cazic.  Still one of my favorite hunting zones, to this day.<P>Bring a group to Nurga and you are guarenteed to have a good time.  One of the few places that a group can crawl from top to bottom.  Not a whole lot in the way of loot, but experience is good, and it's great fun!  <P>In a few more levels you could also head to Droga.  It is quite a different world from Nurga.  You'll probably feel frustrated at times, but when you do succeed, you really feel good about yourself!<P>------------------<BR>Thalanar Solal<BR>Cleric of Tunare<BR>Brell Serilis Server<BR>Leader of Shadow <A HREF="http://www.silver-shadows.com/" TARGET=_blank>http://www.silver-shadows.com/</A> <P>[This message has been edited by Thalanar (edited 04-18-2001).]<p>[This message has been edited by Thalanar (edited 04-18-2001).]</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#dedfdf"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Tarf</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">/agree all replies</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#f7f7f7"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Aladain</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">I agree to all replies too.

I spent quite some time there.<BR>It's pretty easy to get there - Dalnir (althoug great xp) hand CC are more difficult to reach, espacially with those nasty Kunark / Velious mobs hanging around. Feerrot isn't that bad unless you get smacked by an ogre bouncer  <IMG SRC="http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/wink.gif"></FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#dedfdf"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Galavant</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Places my characters have gone through the 30s...<P>1. Cazic-Thule: The first real dungeon in the game, in the opinion of many gamers. The experiences you have here will prepare you for the challenges to come in later levels. I've played every class to at least 30, and all of them have wound up here at some point or another in their life.<P>2. Dalnir: This dungeon is one of the hidden gems of EQ. I went from 36 to 38 here in one day, and left with over 500 PP in loot. That should tell you about how good this dungeon is if you are willing to take the risks. Dalnir is a slightly higher level range than CT, starting in the high 20s and going up. Dalnir usually isn't heavily populated with players, but often you will find soloing monks here, monks who are falling-over happy to team up with a healer...if you are having trouble getting a group elsewhere in Kunark, try Dalnir. It's not disappointed me yet.<P>3. Nurga: It's in the level range, but not usually heavily populated. Getting a group could be a problem.<P>4. Frontier Mountains: Plenty of wanderers in the 30s level range, and of course there's the giant fort. I've taken characters from 28-34 at the giant fort, it just takes some patience. The risk is relatively low and the loot is good. You can often get a partner and pull wanderers to one of the zones for decent XP.<P>5. The Overthere: Low 30s is a good place to start here...it's the next logical step once you've outgrown (or gotten bored with) the Frontier Mountains. You can stay here into the low 40s...just don't expect a lot of loot. There's a tower with three sarnak spawns over by the WW zone that makes a good small-group camp.<P>6. Warslik's Woods: Speaking of WW, this zone is much like FM except it's even harder to navigate...you literally can't see the forest for the trees. Several goblin camps and a giant fort here provide really nice loot. Dalnir is located in this zone BTW.<P>7. Ocean of Tears: Several of the islands here have critters that are good into the low 30s.<P>8. Rathe Mountains: Bind youself just inside Lake Rathe, and then zone in. You are now in prime cyclops hunting territory, all you need is a melee partner. If you're more inclined to solo, giant skeletons are still blue into the low 30s. Don't forget to wander over to the undead ruins near Feerrott and pick up the ingot for the Caduceus of Sacrament.<P>9. Sol A: Good hunting into the low 40s, depending on where you go. Just watch out for the trains. Also, finding a group could be a problem these days...<P>10. Iceclad Ocean: The loot here sucks serious wind, but the XP is good. Get a partner or two and hunt snow cougars, dire wolves and snow dervishes. If you're feeling daring, venture into the lower levels of the Tower of Frozen Shadow. I don't recommend going above the second floor without a strong group though.<P>------------------<BR>Galavant Greenlabel<BR>M&M Brewing Company<BR>http://www.geocities.com/mirthandmayhem<BR>Rathe Server<P>"Judge not by size, but rather by spirit."</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#f7f7f7"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Nadeya</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">bah, these are all good replies, but you said you were hunting in FM?? Why not just take your group one zone over to the Overthere?  It is the best XP for 30-40 IMHO.  The loot sucks, but if it's XP you're after you just can't beat it.  </FONT></TD></TR></TABLE>
