<TEXTAREA NAME="EditedMessage" ROWS=10 COLS=45 WRAP="VIRTUAL">Its 3 a.m. and I am working on some tradeskills in Shadowhaven when I get a tell asking me for a rezz in Dawnshroud Peak.  I am getting pretty bored with making javelins and most of the zones between Shadowhaven and Dawnshroud are safezones or otherwise low risk.

I get to Dawnshroud Peak and see that the guy is in the zone.  I ask him to drag his corpse to the Netherbian lair zone and he asks me really nicely if I can come to the Maiden's Eye zone and rezz his corpse.  I protest at first because I have gotten hammered by mushrooms making that journey in the past but I finally relent and ride high on the wall until I get there.   The entire time I am in zone, there is someone shouting every 5-10 minutes or so asking if anyone has seen his corpse.  I get to the first guy's corpse and I see that he is a necromancer and he has looted all but one item on his corpse and has not been able to drag his corpse because he didn't want to lose his spot in a "really great group".  I am a little pissed but I rezz him.  He gives me 10PP.  10 FREAKING PP!!!  Oh well, I didn't come here with the promise of anything at all so I guess I can't complain.  

In the meantime the guy looking for his corpse asks me if I can rezz him when and if he finds his corpse.  I say "sure" and then I ask the necromancer that I just rezzed if he can summon corpse on the guy (who seemed to be at his wits end).  The necro says he is too busy and that his group needs him.  I remind him that I had just rezzed him and it would be nice if we could help some of the other needy players in the zone.  He then proceeds to remind me that he paid me for the rezz.  10 FREAKING PLAT!!!  His opinion was that my 50% rezz really isn't worth much more than that (despite the fact I was the highest level cleric on Luclin at the time).  So I offer to give him the 10 Plat back for the summon corpse.  He wants 100 Plat for it.  After all he has responsibilities to his group.  I say we can wait until he has regained his mana.  He still wants 100 Plat.  I don't know how much those coffins are but this guy seemed to be of the opinion that he was the only paying member of the EQ community.  He seemed to feel that I was only doing my job when I rezzed him but asking for a summon corpse was really putting him out.  WTF?</TEXTAREA>
