<TEXTAREA NAME="ReplyMessage" ROWS=10 COLS=45 WRAP="VIRTUAL">[QUOTE]Originally posted by Eachann:
[B]The way ragefire works right now is already a real mess... on my server i'd guess there are 25-30 clerics lined up get him (that's just a guess.. it might be more) and at any given time there are like 5 FD'd monks in Naggy's lair... but what really bothers me is that this situation as bad as it is, will only get worse as time goes on.   

It seems like every couple of days i see big groups go and kill Ixiblat for 5-6 people at a time.. which means that there are another 5-6 clerics up and coming to the Ragefire part of the quest.   The list of clerics trying for Ragefire is going to continue growing and growing.  There are more clerics leveling up into range to do the quest all the time, so I don't see this trend ever ending until Verant does something to make this spawn more manageable.

If it's this bad now, what is it going to be like when there are 50 clerics looking for Ragefire?   Or 70.. or 100?   Given enough time there will be that many if this isn't fixed.

Unless a player - CUSTOMER - happens to be part of one of the two or three "uber" guilds on each server, they can not hope to get access one or more of the necessary 'camps'.  A rare spawn, with a rare random drop of an epic item, which requires 3, 4 or more groups in order to obtain the item.  Only the "uber" guilds have the manpower to camp for days on end.  Of course, since this is what they do, it also eliminates even an *attempt* at getting "lucky".<P>  Please consider making these TRIGGERED - and possible to be triggered -- and to avoid the KSing that happens, 'soul-binding' the mob to the one who turned in the item needed to trigger the mob so that only he/she can loot for the first five or six minutes.<P>  All of your customers should have the same basic opportunity to fully develop their characters.<P>Respectfully,<BR>  Sefa Akajira<BR>  Erollsi Marr</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#f7f7f7"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Nalance</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">I was wrong,  Naggy has been up 5 times since the patch.

What bothers me is that the list of peole that needs it is growing at a crazy rate... the line is getting longer and longer and the KS'ing is getting worse and worse.   <P>Last week on my server we had a big guild come in and tell somebody in a smaller guild who was rallying her forces to kill Ragefire that if she didn't engage in one minute they were stealing it... even though she had been camping it for days and had 2-3 groups there clearing fire giants at the time and was getting people in to do the kill.   She had to rush it to get ragefire and of course they got wiped out due to rushing it and not being properly buffed and prepared... and then the bigger guild moved in and killed him nad gave the loot to an ALT.   <P>this kind of thing is crazy.  It's getting worse... the fights over who gets to kill him are going to keep escalating unchecked until Verant does something about how the spawn works.  </FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#dedfdf"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Trawma Siirjen</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Seems to me that if you don't have the power to mobilize a heavy force fast, and kill the beast quickly, then ya prolly shouldn't be wasting your time camping the spawn.<P>Course it's all up to you.
