That is gem city.  We were rolling in the loots this last Sunday.<P>After deducting the cost of my peridots, I did cash splits of about 150 pp, 400 gp - 1 fire emerald, 1 star sapphire, 1 ruby and 1 fire opal per person in the group.<P>In addition, you could Gornit (the named giant in OOT).  He usually has about 30 to 40 pp as cash and occasionally a gem.  Once you hit 54 and get reconning, you can easily hunt the sea fury cyclopses.  I used to do this quite frequently when I was bored and didn't want to group.  You can usually find 1 gem out of every 3 or 4 you kill.

If you have anon or roleplay enabled, remove it so folks shopping for rezzes can find you.  <P>You could also start doing more symbol buffs with Pinzarn(much cheaper reagent) and only use peridots on the puller and the chanter.  <P>In Old Selibis, it is customary to give the cleric the gems looted and this is one of the few dungeons where gems often exceed buff costs.<P>Additionally, be frank with those in your group.  Tell them upfront that buffing with peridots is expensive and they should allocate a portiom of the loot to cover the costs.  Make a hot key to explain it so you won't have to constantly type it every time you join a group.</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#f7f7f7"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Meddik</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">My method: At least half of all my hunting is done in Sebilis.<P>Its the only place where my income meets or exceeds my Peridot Spending.<P>So, I spend half the time there, half the time getting soaked elsewhere.<P>------------------<BR>Meddik Sawbones<BR>Master Healer of <A HREF="http://go.to/orbishonesti" TARGET=_blank>Orbis Honesti</A><BR>(Bristlebane Server)</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#dedfdf"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Aiien</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">I regularly come out 500 to 1kpp ahead hunting in sebilis.

And also the gem drops are great, as long as you let your group know you need compensation for your symbols.<P>I'd also like to offer up Howling Stones as a great place to make cash.  Rarely crowded, there are some great drops down there. (e.g. Golden Bracer 7k, Fingerbone Hoop 15k, etc.)<P>Icewell Keep is a great spot to get some good armor (no-drop), plus there are a couple of quest drops here that bring good loot, or are just good items to wear (e.g. Coldain Skin Gloves +12 ac +6 wis +6 int +9 sta +20 mana +20 hp all/all, sell for 15k or so).<P>Resses of course are a source of revenue, but I usually don't charge.  I only res non-friends when I'm free, and if I'm free you have my services gratis.<P>I go through periods of poverty and plenty so don't feel bad.

Yes I go thru peridots but I don't go thru a lot of them.  I buff only main tank (even if it's an earth pet) and the caster's I'm with.  <P>I'm not big on xp either.

It seems I'm very well taken care of and am very generous as well when it comes to "going the distance" to do rezzes or what have you.  Having fun is my primary concern when playing and it just seems that good fortune is flowing my way because of it.<P>Have fun playing and enjoy what you do.   <IMG SRC="http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/biggrin.gif"><P><P>------------------<BR>Greywolffe Silverstarr<BR>51st Cleric of Tunare<BR>E'Marr</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#f7f7f7"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Jubal</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">You're still FFA looting in Seb?

Go out to seafury island in OOT. Have the mage make an earth pet and you both toss all your buffs onto it. Mage parks pet, you sit a little bit behind it and monitor its health. Mage runs out and aggros seafuries, dragging them onto the pet. You can keep 1 or 2 seafuries constantly on the pet as long as you keep a damage shield, and if you are careful they will never aggro you or the mage. They drop gems in the range of star rubies and sapphires often enough to make a good deal of cash.</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#f7f7f7"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Dikmer</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">I'm probably the last person to ask about cash flow, but here goes.<P>I restarted with just my NO DROP gear. Borrowed everything else. So far, I have either been extremely lucky or just persistent. But at this point, I now own most of my gear, have a full bag of gems, and 1250pp in the bank.<P>The only things I am still borrowing are my wifes Gold quest arms, legs and BP, her pair of Plat Jasper rings (and I have a friend making me Velium Jasper rings soon) and her Plat Ruby Veil. Everything else I have has either been paid for or given to me by friends and guild.<P>I also got a pair of Donal's Boots of Mourning the other day, that I may try to trade off if I can get some equipment so I can return my wifes stuff. We'll see how that goes.<P>Now, how did I do it? By looting as much as I can in KC. Most nights I walk out with 1 or 2 cash items, 10+ FS weapons, and 150-200pp in gold and plat. I even keep the silver unless I am over weight. I am a cheap bastard, I keep anything. If I see someone loot and they drop an FS weapon on the group, I pick it up. <P>Some nights, I break even after restocking. Some nights I bank 100-300pp. One night I didn't get a group for an hour and banked 600pp from resses in Dreadlands.

Or more than one.  Then put all the fine<BR>steel that no one else wants in it.  Is it HUGE money, well, no, of course<BR>not, but it is money you wouldn't have otherwise?  You betcha.  10 slots,<BR>about 5PP each, a bonus 50PP for that trip.  This is ESPECIALLY good<BR>in Lower Guk.<P>Take all those gems you are getting and do the mid-level quests with<BR>them (Lambent, Crafted, etc).  THEN sell it for a reasonable price.  While<BR>this may seem weird, you would be stunned how much XP you can get<BR>doing these quests.  I did a mix of 8 mid level quests while I was level<BR>45 (3 crafted, 1 lambent, shadowbound gloves, robe of the elements,<BR>Incandescent gloves and something else).  I managed to get 2 subbubbles<BR>for doing these quests (one on the 3 crafted alone).  In a hell level that was<BR>quite nice.  You sell at a reasonable price because 1) you get rid of them <BR>faster and 2) you still make more than you would just selling the gems.<P>Farm Hill Giants - holy smokies this can make a lot of cash.  Best done<BR>with a group of guildies/friends.  We had a group of 6 (some who were<BR>still getting good XP) and went down to rathe mountains on a slow day.<BR>In less than 2 hours we had WELL over 1KPP in goods and gear (notice, the<BR>bag of the tinkerers helps here too).  AND, as an added bonus, you can<BR>take all of the annoying 'lose change' (i.e. the 10000 CP and 5000SP) and<BR>run over to the vendor and get a 'bonus' 2-3 peridots with it.  Waste not,<BR>want not..;-)<P>Become a mastersmith who can make Fine Steel armor easily.  Ok, this<BR>one isn't for the faint of heart, but I have made a TON of money with<BR>Fine Steel (and, by extension, Imbued Dwarven Plate).  Indeed, so few<BR>people have gone through all the trouble to learn higher end smithing due<BR>to the perceived lack of a point that people REALLY need this gear.  <BR>Currently I don't sell any more due to various issues, but I would<BR>pretty much double my money each time I made a set (once I got my skill<BR>near 190).  And Imbued Dwarven Plate, while HARD to make with many<BR>failures, sells for a lot of change.<P>And finally, always try to have some liquid cash reserve around for<BR>those quick 'that is WAY to cheap, I need to buy it and resell it'<BR>auctions you see.  High end Kunark armor pieces for 1K, Paws for<BR>3K, FBSS for 5K, etc.  Even if you turn around and just 'dump' it<BR>again for 1KPP more, you still make a nice chunk and feel proud<BR>of yourself.

Then simply transfer your earnings over to your cleric. <P>My 56 necro has singly twinked my 30Sk with full DF armor AT lvl 10, my 26 cleric with full cleric quest armor, and my 34 mule druid with over 200int....I do love twinking<P>whether I take out the third level floor of dalnir, rip through Droga, or solo skyfire for spell drops...Im always out to make money, but it all starts with which class you play. Stop grouping and rolling, get it all for yourself!!<P>rathe mtn hill giants will blow away almost any HG spawn you find, so find the large Hill where the HGs spawn and group with a necro and tradeoff loots....you'll make phat cash that way...Do little stupid quests like the paw of O, or the shadowbound quests, etc etc...these will bring in extra cash...<P>grouping in Seb might make your group rich, but what about you?????<BR></FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#dedfdf"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Dikmer</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial"> <BLOCKQUOTE><font size="1" face="Verdana, Arial">quote:</font><HR>And finally, always try to have some liquid cash reserve around for those quick 'that is WAY to cheap, I need to buy it and resell it' auctions you see. High end Kunark armor pieces for 1K, Paws for 3K, FBSS for 5K, etc. Even if you turn around and just 'dump' it again for 1KPP more, you still make a nice chunk and feel proud of yourself. And you don't even need to feel dirty.<HR></BLOCKQUOTE><P>Heh, I've done this a few times. Once, I remember seeing someone tying to unload a Ghoulbane in Oasis for 2k. I bought it, walked over to East Commons, auctioned it, got offered 4k for it. Fastest 2k I ever made.<P>I am always keeping my eyes open for good deals. I got Donal's Boots the other day in KC, and someone offered me 7k + a Spirit Tome for it. Now, I am still wearing alot of borrowed gear, so I jumped on it. Used the cash to buy 2 Velium Jasper rings, a Velium Ruby Viel, Donal's Arms, and banked the rest. Still trying to sell the Spirit Tome, but heck, that was just gravy anyway.</FONT></TD></TR></TABLE>
