<TEXTAREA NAME="ReplyMessage" ROWS=10 COLS=45 WRAP="VIRTUAL">[QUOTE]Originally posted by Georgia_TKR:
[B]I had a group in OS lower zone out last night that was working REALLY well, but the issue was that our enchanter kept screaming for us to zone everytime the warrior pulled two or three mobs. 

She had a high ping, but apparently didn't speak English very well so she didn't tell us this at all. Well, she finally grated my nerves, when she let a frog beat me down to one bubble of health before turning DA on and telling my group to hit th eportal and zone. Apparently she didn't catch this so I disbanded the group and reformed it without her.

It was a pleasure to see her sitting at the zone in naked, as she didn't deserve my help with anything after that display of ebayish tactics. 

She wouldn't stun, she wouldn't mezz, she wouldn't do anything but whine about two mobs and not wanting to mezz but zone :/

Some retards... I wonder how they make it post 50.

Chanter mezzs them rogue goes LD followed by the Chanter 10 secs later.  We finish them off though.  He drops a dark reaver (crap now a days).  Druid of course loots it like everything else.   He says lets roll...I pass. He wins.  Chanter comes back and ask to roll on item.

Bard pops in and we grab him and move down...<BR>Had myself, warrior, rogue, bard and 2 necros. Anyways, we get down there and begin pulls. We hadn't really spaced the guards well so while fighting they both gang up on the necro before the bard can mes or I can heal. So we're down one person but we keep on. I manage to stay ahead on heals with bard cracksong being twisted when a knight pops in the room and HTs the necro who was lifetapping the golem. Now we're down 2 but we keep plodding along. Warrior keeps the taunt on himself, rogue keeps backstabbing, bard is twisting mes and cracksong and I'm CHing the warrior. Despite 2 more wanderers into the room we manage to kill everything in one of the longest 30 mins I've ever had. <P>In fact, the night would have been perfect except that the bard LDed during a golem fight and with the number of resists on stun I was getting (Stun Command is worthless) he CHed twice and the second golem popped. Bard came back in the nick of time but got group bugged because the warrior was zoning from death (I was prepping to Gate myself which was about all the mana I had at the time) so we tried to have them run out but it didn't work. Got another rogue to drag from the door and summoned our rogue out.<P>Oh, and I scored a Hierophant's Cloak somewhere in there  <IMG SRC="http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/biggrin.gif"><P>So the bottom line, as always with groups, is A) know your role and know it well B) don't panic.
