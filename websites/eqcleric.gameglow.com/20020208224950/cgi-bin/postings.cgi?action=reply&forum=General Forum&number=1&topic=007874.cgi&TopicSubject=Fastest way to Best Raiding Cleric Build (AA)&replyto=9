[B]Havent fought any high end Luclin fights yet so, for me  this would probably be the best build i  could do  (my guild normally does HoT Inny Vind  and will probably be going on to SoV bosses + Ntov within 4 months or so).

As for people dieing on raids... what my  guild has been doing is having the 3 other 60 clerics cast single aego on those that die.

*Nod*  your right bout the Aego.  3 and 1\4 hours still is great. I may try to fiddle around with the points to see if i can  get some into the other arch type skills and still keep it under 75 points.

Get perma jboots indoors and be able to fix a screw up ya made when creating your priest.<P>Mental clarity(1)- Mental clarity is probably the quickest skill you can put AA points into and see a change. Read farther to see why only 1 skill at this point  <P>Casting Mastery(2)- So far the wizards have figured out that with 3 points of Casting mastery you can save 15% of your mana avg. Throwing 2 skill points into this skill gives you like a 10% increase on the size of your mana pool. Raiding clerics always neeeed mooore mana and less fizzles!<P>Spell casting Reinforcement(1)- reason for puting 1 point here is because the first class skill (cleric) is going to be Mass group buff and this will help keep those 40+ Aegos stuck for a longer peridot of time.<P>Channeling Focus(1)- Needed to stick 2AA points somewhere and what better place. With Luclin, it has been my EXP from grinding there that the mobs tend to interrupt me 2x more often than anywhere else. This will help stop that a bit  <P>MASS GROUP BUFF(1) - OMG YOU MADE IT HALF WAY!! Now your able to buff your whole raid for 4 dots and 2000 mana. Just as soon as you spend 20k for group aego  <P>Casting Mastery(3)- RAR 15% increase to mana pool!<P>Mental Clarity(2)- Lets increase your mana regen rate a little<P>Spell casting Reinforcement(3)- Wooot! 3 hour Aego!!<P>Spell casting Reinforcement mastery(1)- R0xx0r 4 hour aego! whole raid is now buffed for 4 hours only using 4 dots and 2000 mana. *huggles guildfund* I promise to never spend all your money again on those stupid dots.<P>Mental Clarity(3)- last skill  <P>Quickest way to being a monster raiding cleric for 61AA points!<P>The reason i didnt go for more points of Mental Clarity is because during a raid you should already be regening 40 or so per tick and wasting 10 points in a skill you will hardly notice when a bard or chanter is around isnt worth it. And lets face it... if you dont have BAoR 3 months from now something is really wrong with ya. The spell drops often and should be the first thing you buy before you upgrade any piece of gear.<P>So guys what ya think? </FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#f7f7f7"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Nimue</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Quote:  MASS GROUP BUFF(1) - OMG YOU MADE IT HALF WAY!!

Sure, all of those will help you a little but its nothing spectacular nor class defining.  I have MGB, Divine Res, Celestial Regen, Bestow DA and the -only- reason I got the last three is because I wanted the 3rd class title.  Our archetype abilities are more worthwhile than our class, and we share most of those with other casters and even hybrids.  Spell casting reinforcement is nice and saves 2 peris for every time you rebuff it, but unless every other buff class on that raid has that skill you're going to have to stop for them to rebuff/med anyways..and that's 20 AA points to raise.  <P>I agree that you picked the best lot of what is offered to us with AA points, I'm just bitter that they didn't improve us equally with hybrids and pure casters.<P>Nimue Whiterose<BR>Priestess of Tunare<BR>Brell Serilis Server<BR></FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#dedfdf"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Bezil</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Quick correction...

Most raids don't last more than 4-6 hours, so you're not really saving that much time/effort. As for MGB, yeah, it would be nice to be able to give Aego to an entire raid, but then again, why? Being a raid cleric is all about being able to heal, not buff. Buffing is secondary in a raid. I find myself rebuffing Aegolism, not from it wearing off, but to people dying. Alot can happen in 2.5 hours.<P>IMHO, for a "Raid Cleric", you want 3x Runspeed, 3x whatever, then go for Casting Mastery, Channeling Focus and Mental Clarity. These 3 skills maximizes your avalable mana and helps regain lost mana faster. Then go back and increase your stats/resists. <P>If you wish, go for the critical heals and other skills. I'm not really impressed with them. A 100% res that can only be used every week or 2? A waste of points. <P>Critical Heals? Really, I use CH and CE so much, I wouldn't even see a critical heal much at all. <P>Purify Soul? Yeah, 72 minute refresh one a skill that clears everything but fear, charm and res effects. You would forget you even had it until it's too late.</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#f7f7f7"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">ShelseaDruid</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">I heard on Prexus that the Group Mass Buff was used with Blessing of Aegolism and 5 groups were buffed.</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#dedfdf"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Dyonaisys</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Critical heal is definately worth getting.  There are mobs in luclin that cast AE curse spells that can reduce healing up to 75% (as far as I've seen so far)  so a CH would only do 2500hp instead of 10k.

It is also extremely difficult to keep the tanks all cured and to heal so I agree crit heals going off throughout on some of those fights ahve value.<P>I do like Divine Rez for the series fights with timed triggers that will despawn if not engaged.  Helps to get a mage in with mana and hp to make mod rods fast or to get a mass buffing cleric or enchanter in to buff the raid fast.  Definitely a skill worth a couple raid clerics getting.  Most of those fights are only available once a Rl week anyway so the refresh timer is not a problem.<P>I like the arch skills better than the class ones as far as in wanting them all.<P>Qwenya<P>------------------<BR> <A HREF="http://www.clubfu.com/view_player.php?uid=44" TARGET=_blank>http://www.clubfu.com/view_player.php?uid=44</A></FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#f7f7f7"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Gorian</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Havent fought any high end Luclin fights yet so, for me  this would probably be the best build i  could do  (my guild normally does HoT Inny Vind  and will probably be going on to SoV bosses + Ntov within 4 months or so).<P>As for people dieing on raids... what my  guild has been doing is having the 3 other 60 clerics cast single aego on those that die.<P>*Nod*  your right bout the Aego.  3 and 1\4 hours still is great.

Here's why: reinforcement-1 only adds 7.5 minutes to Aego, channeling focus-1 is only 5% and I'm not sure it works against a bash, mental clarity-1 is only 1 mana/tick, a raiding cleric will have c3 and AE bard song. One more mana/tick won't be as noticeable as SCM-3 will be. Then 9 on mass group buff, then go back and get mental clarity-3. After that, it doesn't matter too much.<P>For most situations, it's all about mana pool and mana regen. SCM and MC are the two abilities that affect that the most. The other abilities will be nice for some fights, but mana pool/regen is nice for every fight.<P>I think you should wait on reinforcement, it's really just a convenience. For xp groups, reinforcement is great, but you did say a raiding cleric. I usually don't rebuff Aego because it wears off during a raid.<P>The fights aren't quick and dirty like they used to be.

Did I say that was for 20 AA pts?<P>Raids? Shrug, its more often that I wished MGB was ready again so I could rebuff the lot again than I have Aego run out during a crucial time.
