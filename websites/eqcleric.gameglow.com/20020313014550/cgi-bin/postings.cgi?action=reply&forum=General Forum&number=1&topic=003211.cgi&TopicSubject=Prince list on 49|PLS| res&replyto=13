Just as your tank starts to approach 2 bubs of health left, start negotiating the price for a CH.  Make sure not to give in when negotiating.

I mean, your mana is soooo valuable, especially versus undead, I think you should get to loot the mob, plus get at least 5 plat per undead mob from each member of your party, for them getting the priveledge of you grouping with them.<P>Smikkey Giantmaster<BR>52nd Level Cleric<BR>Quellious</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#dedfdf"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Dorad</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Smikkey<P>Good call I never thought of that  <IMG SRC="http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/smile.gif"> 20pp for heriosm hmm thats really nickle/dime seems like a lot work but I will give it a try. <P>As for tax nah that just to much accounting work - bah<P>Dorad Clerics</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#f7f7f7"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Dorad</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">oops <P>Prince = pryce <BR>err pryce = price<P>Bah - I was never really good speller...

And think about it.  Try to get in a small plane raid, especially Fear, cause clerics dont like it there, say 12 people with you the only cleric.  Everyone gets ready, and you heroism the whole raid group....11 times 20, thats 220 plat (More than double the cost of a rez!!).<P>First hard pull, let a few tanks die cause they havent prepaid thier CH fee.  Then you start camping. After the tanks die, the rest of the group is doomed!!  Boddda Bing!!  11 rezzes.  Lets say the average level is 51st.  11 rezzes at 200 plat each, thats 2200 plat, plus you get to heroism everyone again!!  Now you have made 2,640 plat.  Secretly pull that off a couple of more times during the raid.<P>No because you have built up such a good rep as a cleric, you will be asked on many other raids.  Think about all of the plat you can save!!  Of course, as a high level cleric, the only thing to spend your money on is reagants, but you will just have to figure that into your buff price list.<P>Smikkey Giantmaster<BR>52nd Level Cleric<BR>Quellious</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#dedfdf"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Dorad</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Smikkey<P>Your Complete Heal line of thought - well what can I say it's brilliant.

In fact, I just re-read the post and I can almost guarantee that this isn't done.. so where are all these insults of "Charge for Fear and casting Heroism".  I can almost be 100% certain that price lists comes up when the complete stranger or that person you've only grouped with once gives you a tell asking you to run 15 zones, do a couple summersaults and recite the national anthem for a rezz.<P>Do I agree with Price lists?

All that of course *only* if I am available. Most likely multiple zone res's are going to be *no* most of the time simply because of the million factors that could mess it up including them having decayed (for res purposes) before I can get there, having found *someone else* to do it when I'm halfway there, them logging before I get there and wasting my time, and a myriad of other factors. <P>When it comes down to getting a res I am finding more and more that people have *NO* sense of integrity to the commitment they are making with you when you agree to res them.
