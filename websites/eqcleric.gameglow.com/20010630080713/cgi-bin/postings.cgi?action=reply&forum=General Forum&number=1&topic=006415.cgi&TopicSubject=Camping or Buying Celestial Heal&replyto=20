I have only been able to get in a few groups to kill wurms and we hunted the guardians. We got a few spells but no Cel Heal. I Gave up trying to camp it and went to DL and BW for some exp. Soon as I got 1.5k in bank I started to WTB Celestial Healing took a few days when a druid gave tell asking how much I was paying I said 1k and I never got a tell back <shrugs>. I figured I needed 2k and started to save more. A few more days go by and another druid gave me a tell asking how much was I paying I said just tell me what you want he said "How much you paying" I never returned his tell I'm already playing a game didnt wan't to play another. Shouted for almost another week<BR>with no Luck. I headed to GD for another shot with some guildmates but the guardians were camped. Got a tell form a rouge,Druid and Pally asking if we wanted to go to TT I said sure since wurms were camped and I have never been there. There was a lev 52 Cleric shouting wtb Cel Heal paying 1.2k and I said in group I would love to get that spell been trying for weeks. The druid said he had a copy how much was I paying ( at this point I would have paid 2k but told him 1.5k) he said Ok its in bank lets go get. yaahoo finally I was happy to pay the 1.5k. We ended up in TT an I Love this spell btw so does the druid since he was the puller(only one with tracking) and it saved his butt many times. Took me til lev 47 to get but finally I have it Love when the ouller calls INC and ya just slap it on the main tank  <IMG SRC="http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/smile.gif"><P>Falconquick<BR>47th Season</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#f7f7f7"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Tvenya</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">I read so many horror stories I decided to just buy it.

I personally gave 2 away to guildmates.  However hindsight being 20/20, I got screwed in the end.  The copies I saw drop were in the first two weeks of Velious going live when each Guardian was pretty much guaranteed to drop up to three spells.  I went back to the Wurm camp after the infamous spell drop nerf and got so frustrated that I vowed to never do it again. Also it just so happens that shortly after I gave the copies away to guildmates, I did so to better the guild and help us out.  Well in both cases the guildmates left the guild shortly after looking for raiding style guilds<P>As soon as Quistil hit 39 I sold off a lot of junk (including my coveted Ghoulbane  Sigh) and managed to raise 2.5k (said Ghoulbane just isnt worth what it once was).  I started to auction in every single zone I was in for Celestial Healing and never got a single tell for a week.  Kept checking with my guild but no joy there either.  I posted on the trades section of my servers board and finally found a seller.  I was hoping to pay 1k or less for the spell.  I was willing to blow the whole 2.5k on it.  He wanted 2k for it but I managed to talk him down to 1.5k.  So I got it for far less than I was willing to buy it for but more than I wanted to.<P>Overall Im happy though.  It sits in my backpack with my other 44 spells just waiting for the day I can scribe it  <IMG SRC="http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/smile.gif"><BR><P>------------------<BR>Quistil Angelwatch<BR>Cleric of 40 Seasons in the service to the Great Mother Tunare<BR>Islington Angelwatch (Semi Retired)<BR>Paladin of 53 Seasons in the glorious service to Erollisi Marr<BR>Phoenix Crusaders</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#f7f7f7"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Nalance</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">< is level 54 and still doesn't have the spell.

But unless you're in a raiding guild and in your high 50's, Velk's isn't a reality.  So just start auctioning WTB Celestial Healing as soon as you hit 39/40  <IMG SRC="http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/smile.gif">  I made a hotkey for it, and got super lucky...  The second time I ever hit the hotkey, I got a tell from a level 60 enchanter in one of our server's uber-guilds asking how much I was offerring, and 1k later I had it in my hands  <IMG SRC="http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/smile.gif">  It helps to auction in odd zones though.  For instance, the enchanter saw my auction while she was on a monk epic raid in LOIO.  Don't auction in someplace like Dreadlands, where there are probably four or five other clerics also looking for it.<P>And as for the spell drops--I heard Turning of the Unnatural was upped.  At least, I know it used to go for 1k on The Tribunal, but now it's only 300 (which is what I paid when I bought my copy last night.

Only takes a single group that knows what the hell they are doing (we do it with 4 people all the time) and the spells drop quite often. I hunt upper or lower kobolds just about every night trying to get 60.

Celestial Healing is a level 44 spell and by this point we want to get the spell as soon as possible so that we can have it ready when we hit 44.  The section of spell drops in Dexter's Lab is 50+ and the level 40 to 44 Cleric won't be able to get it.<P>I guess the good thing is that it DOES drop here though as it allows Clerics the chance to buy it from the higher levels.

Eh well, maybe tonight is my lucky night.  <BR>Also have a bard who swears he's gonna get it for me since I gave him the coin of the ancients that drops in kaesora.  Heh!

If you can buy the spell, I think you might be a lot happier in the end.  Camping this particular spell is extremely frustrating.<P>I bought my copy for a single reason.  I did NOT want to camp for it.  Quistil has been leveling like crazy and I'm trying to get her to 50 as soon as possible (the game is still fun but I don't have that wide eyed sense of awe the second time around.  I just want to level and be with friends again).  If I had camped for it, I would have slowed down on exp dramatically.  So I viewed the 1.5k a small price to pay for the ability to keep getting exp while still getting my spell.<P>Good luck with it. You'll get it eventually don't worry.
