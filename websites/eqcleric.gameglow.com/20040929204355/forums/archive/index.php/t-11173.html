<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jahaar</div><div class="date">08-23-2002, 04:41 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Lately, we've been working up some changes to help balance out the cleric class.  This is important to get done before Planes of Power, as it's the foundation for the growing role of priest classes in the future of EverQuest.  The goals behind these changes are to -<br />
<br />
- Provide clerics with useful group and raid roles as other priests gain raid quality healing<br />
- Decrease the cleric's mandatory dependancy on grouping for any reasonable gain<br />
- Increase the level of variety and interest involved in playing a cleric<br />
<br />
The first part of the change was to add the following spells -<br />
- Hammer of Judgement - CLR/56 (summon a hammer with a powerful and frequent proc effect)<br />
- Yaulp V - CLR/56 (self only melee and mana regen buff.  Adds haste, dexterity, mana regen, and stamina regen)<br />
<br />
These spells are useful in allowing the cleric to do a new form of combat damage.  Clerics use the new Yaulp spell to gain melee haste, standing mana regeneration, and increased Dexterity.  This helps out a great deal by allowing the cleric to use their new summoned hammer at peak efficiency.  <br />
<br />
The summoned hammer is a unique weapon in that it has a very high proc frequency, doing 75-150 damage per proc.  This allows clerics to do reasonable melee style damage by relying on the procs alone.  The cleric's pet &quot;Unswerving Hammer of Faith&quot; has had it's mana cost and casting time lowered, as well as it's effectiveness upgraded.  The hammer pet cannot be riposted or effected by spells, though it is rapidly killed if no one is tanking for it.  The hammer pet still poofs after each combat, but for the new price of 250 mana, it adds an amount of damage that's very competitive with other damage-over-time spells.<br />
<br />
Using Yaulp + the Hammer of Judgement, the cleric begins to be effective in toe-to-toe combat.  Other supporting spells available to the cleric are his low cost summoned pet, and the Mark of Retribution/Mark of Karn spells.  Using a combination of these spells, along with the clerics excellent buffs give surprisingly good results.  In testing, clerics have been effective soloing the entrance to Charasis and Chardok, grouping in a number of high end dungeons, and even making reasonable experience as a two-cleric duo in Cazic-Thule.<br />
<br />
This upgrade allows clerics a new style of relatively effective soloing, as well as some excellent options to add value in groups.  While this may not be sufficient to get clerics into groups by itself, it does add significant value and allows even multi-cleric groups to be profitable.  Fairly extensive play-testing, both by game designers and clerics on test have proven these spells to be effective, and perhaps more importantly, very entertaining to use.<br />
<br />
In addition to the added spells, we'll be trying out the Bash skill for Clerics, beginning at level 25.  While this skill will cap out lower than their melee counterparts, clerics should still get a decent amount of value out of this addition.  It adds a bit of damage as well as a free chance to stun opponents.  This also works well with the recent improvements to shields on Test, that give a meaningful boost to armor class, in addition to a chance to block incoming blows.<br />
<br />
The following heal spells were added to the cleric class -<br />
- Ethereal Elixir - CLR/60 (group version of the Celestial Elixir heal-over-time spell)<br />
- Ethereal Light - CLR/58 (upgraded version of Divine Light single target heal)<br />
- Ethereal Remedy - CLR/59 (upgraded version of Remedy single target heal)<br />
<br />
These spells are not expected to add a great deal of power to clerics, as clerical healing is already more than sufficient.  These spells are all minor but useful upgrades to existing clerical heals.  The goal with these spells is to round out a cleric's healing versatility and allow them to tailor their memmed healing line-up to whatever adventuring situation they find themselves in.  With this large selection of healing spells, clerics are able to fit various situations more efficiently than any other class.<br />
<br />
It's important that clerics maintain their role as the premier healer of the game.  Raid quality heals are being added for other priests to allow them to fulfill their role as secondary healers in most situations.  Clerics have always been a healing specialist, but the situation has escalated such that many raid level encounters may not be undertaken without disproportionally large numbers of clerics.  No other class has been able to fill in if a cleric is absent, and healing is too important of a role to allow one class to dominate it so completely.  After these changes are complete, clerics will still be the very best of healers but other priests class are able to substitute to some degree.<br />
<br />
Clerics are going to receive additional changes so that they have some abilities that makes them more sought after for grouping.  The final ability choices will be made after this first set of changes is evaluated and tested more extensively.  It's very important that clerics have an ability that makes other players say &quot;I really want to invite a cleric because they can do X, and that will be really helpful.&quot;  This is vital to the health of the class.  All priests should offer a similar level of value in solo, group, and raid situations, and they won't be considered balanced until this is true.<br />
<br />
We understand that there's a lot of trepidation at major changes, and fears that your class will become less valuable in the game.  When the changes are finished, I think most people will be pleased and will feel that their concerns have been listened to and addressed.  The health of all classes in the game is as important to the dev team as it is to the many people who've spoken up passionately about their concerns here on this board.<br />
<br />
Thanks for your patience, <br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">JanSorensen</div><div class="date">08-23-2002, 05:17 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks alot for the update Jahaar. Its extremely appreciated.<br />
<br />
I personally cannot wait to try the hammer and just how often a &quot;frequent proc effect&quot; fires :) <br />
<br />
Considering that warriors parse 2-3 procs/min with atleast some weapons - I assume we are talking about 6-10 procs per min when you say &quot;frequent&quot; - 6 with 180ish dex and 10 with 255 dex. (note, haste doesnt seem to change #procs/min). <br />
<br />
Considering that 8*141 = 1128 is 18.8 dps this seems to be whats needed too - as a bare minimum. <br />
<br />
So, you *will* be held to the promise of &quot;frequent&quot;  I can assure you if it doesnt atleast proc on average 6 times / min with 180ish dex (using Y5 obviously).<br />
<br />
As for Y5 helping us regain mana standing - if its tweaking to cosr 1 mana only as Y4 it would.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Aenia</div><div class="date">08-23-2002, 05:33 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Rich, thank you so much for giving us info on what's being worked on.  I think a few words from someone at EQ now and again when changes are going on will go a LONG ways to keep people calm.<br />
<br />
I do hope you're reading Rayne's sticky post &quot;What do we really need?&quot;.  It's getting quite lenghty and many posts are repeats of the same things, but I read through most of it this morning and saw quite a few very unique ideas that would add utility for clerics without &quot;stealing&quot; any spells from any other classes.  Definitely some great ideas coming up there, if not for now, then maybe ideas you can build on for the future.<br />
<br />
Thanks again :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lamorat</div><div class="date">08-23-2002, 05:39 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">First of all I would like to thank for your update and the live team and the testers in doing so many work in trying to balance out the cleric class. I really appreciate it.<br />
<br />
Some of my thoughts:<br />
<br />
1. At this stage so far, its seems that the balancing is more oriented to give cleric the ability to melee to cause damage. How the live team come up with this decision? Do the cleric community really like this change or they actually prefer to cause damage by nuking?<br />
<br />
2. The spells addition are nice but only 58+ cleric will benefit from it. Level 54 - 58 clerics will be the most affected group with the changes currently on test. The coming changes seems have nothing to help them to add value to groups. <br />
<br />
3. &quot;In testing, clerics have been effective soloing the entrance to Charasis and Chardok, grouping in a number of high end dungeons, and even making reasonable experience as a two-cleric duo in Cazic-Thule.&quot;<br />
Are these level 60 clerics? I hope not, otherwise the 54-58 clerics will not be benefit from the change.<br />
<br />
4. The &quot;solo&quot; hammer is a neat interesting idea. However, don't you think that the cleric class will be too dependant on a single weapon?  It will mean that I can't use my hard-earned nice 2hb when I have to go solo?<br />
<br />
I understand that changes is not yet completed. The above is only my observatiion/opinion so far about the direction of the changes<br />
<br />
Thanks for you time<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">NEExt</div><div class="date">08-23-2002, 05:45 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">WOOHOOO!!!!! I so wanted to be a melee class! THANX!<br />
<br />
My favorite part:<br />
<br />
&quot;I really want to invite a cleric because they can do X, and that will be really helpful.&quot;<br />
<br />
So what is &quot;X&quot;? Melee? Heal? Both? Are VI people stupider than I think? Clerics all over Norrath I'm sure are chomping at the bit to bag their epics and blackstars, put away thier lanterns, waste a spell gem for Yaulp 5 and melee with their NEW UBER SUMMONED WEAPON!<br />
<br />
Notice folks, that there is no mention of increased offense or 1hb skills. No mention of increased defense. No double hit. No nothing. I have over 1250AC and 3800HP with full buffs, and I still get pwned like a red headed step child in most zones that give me experience.<br />
<br />
Now, don't get me completely wrong. I don't necessarily think that clerics becoming more melee oriented is necessarily a bad thing. D&amp;D clerics of old used to do some pretty fair melee damage, and I'll be the first to admit that melee is fun on occasion (and yes I do it now).<br />
<br />
However. If they are going to go this route, they need to go FURTHER.<br />
<br />
#1. INCREASE OFFENSIVE, DEFENSIVE, 1HB, AND 2HB CAPS!!!!!<br />
#2. Make better ratio cleric weaps.<br />
#3. Up proc rate on current good procing damage cleric weaps (Dawnfire, Truesight Hammer... I don't want to use the stupid summoned weap all the time)<br />
#4. Yaulp 5 better stack with BAoTR!<br />
<br />
Personally... I think VI is stupid, If i wanted to play a gimp melee class, i would have picked -insertgimpmeleeclasshere-. If PoP is gonna be that hard that you have to give better heals to other classes. Problem easily solved. <br />
<br />
Give Druids the freaking 1600 heal for 550mana... it better fits their line anyway. Add a snare effect to the group CE spell and give it to shamans for 800mana or so. Don't give druids a near-CH quality spell.  Give a near CH-quality spell to clerics for an 8sec cast and 300mana.  I would be happy with these changes. They wouldn't FORCE ME TO BECOME A MELEE CLASS TO GET AN EXP GROUP.  VI is going about this completely the wrong way.  Dont make druids a non-melee cleric equivelent.  Make Clerics BETTER and MORE EFFICIENT, while making OTHER HEALERS BETTER AND MORE EFFICIENT!<br />
<br />
I'm just completely shocked at this. Shocked actually isnt the best word. Amazed... flabergasted...<br />

<br />
&quot;Other supporting spells available to the cleric are his low cost summoned pet, and the Mark of Retribution/Mark of Karn spells&quot;<br />
<br />
You do realize that Mark of Karn is only useful do get rid of mob damage shields?  That the amount it heals is so ultimiately trivial that it doesn't justify its cost?  And that the casting time on the Velious BPs is so long that the combat is over by the time we're done casting the spell, only to have it resisted?<br />
<br />
You cannot honestly tell me that Mark of Karn is useful in any way, other than it being a 'targeted dispel' for damage shields.<br />
<br />
&quot;Using Yaulp + the Hammer of Judgement, the cleric begins to be effective in toe-to-toe combat&quot;<br />
<br />
Um, maybe in terms of melee damage, but not in terms of damage taken.  I have one of the higher ACs/HPs (1250 AC, 4100 hps with self buffs) for clerics on our server, and mobs completely own me in toe-to-toe combat.   Even high green mobs hit for max like every other swing.<br />
<br />
Not to mention, did you bother to even ASK if clerics actually WANTED to be bad paladins?  Most clerics do not; just read this forum.<br />
<br />
I would much rather see this 'improved benefit for groups' be more along the lines of actually improving our support role, the role that I have had for the 3+ years I've played EQ.  Make clerics make the *group* better in some way.  Give new/different Mark type spells; give 'bard-like' abilities to up melee stats of your entire party, or improve mana regen somewhat.<br />
<br />
You, Verant, have defined what a cleric was for the past 3 years; those that actually still play the class (as opposed to probably half the clerics out there now days being 2-boxed) play it because they love the SUPPORTING role.  <br />
<br />
If I wanted to be a paladin, I'd have started a paladin.<br />
<br />
There are many cleric-only weapons out there; or weapons that are often given to clerics.  Instead of making a summoned hammer, which completely negates ALL WEAPONS FOR CLERICS IN THE GAME, make the 'hammer' proc instead a buff that adds a melee proc (much like Divine Might for paladins).  That would allow clerics to choose the weapon *they* want to use, and still get this added proc benefit you seem to be claiming will solve all our problems.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lala</div><div class="date">08-23-2002, 06:40 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Bravo, thank you Jahaar.   :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Windeliane</div><div class="date">08-23-2002, 07:01 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I won't say if all of this is good or bad. Our changes won't affect that much our role or utility. The changes of other classes will.<br />
<br />
So let's see what's gonna happen when all come live. I'm very pessimistic though, i don't wanna be a soloer, nor a melee...<br />
<br />
Clerics (healers more generally speaking) are less and less needed because of the increasing gap betwenn raising players abilities and the static &quot;difficulty&quot; of proposed zones. I hope PoP will solve this.<br />
<br />
Thanks for posting anyways :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Grumbles</div><div class="date">08-23-2002, 07:04 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Must be the late hours and lack of sleep that cooked up these &quot;upgrades&quot; to the Cleric class.  <br />
<br />
Where are the Def skills that are going to keep clerics alive while all this melee'ing is going on and we're getting hit for doubles and trip's of 120+   Or are the new summoned weapons going to generate ZERO agro in a group situation so we dont get our beat down from all these frequent proc's and have to take a rez from a passing Necro or Pally?  oh maybe thats why we need more than one cleric in a group now.<br />
<br />
We get to kill a Dragon in WW now?  <br />
<br />
We get to snare and quad with ranged AE spells?  blue cons?<br />
<br />
We get a Epic weapon thats practically contention free and the final mob is triggered on demand?  Ohhhh wait, we dont need that anymore, we are now Pally-Mages (WOOHOO!! the first dual class in EQ) and we're gonna SUMMON our new MELEE weapon.<br />
<br />
Clerics have been using this at zone in at Charsis and Chardok huh?  Well I am overwhelmed.   2 zone in's where you have to have Invis to get to and at least in Chardok you can DB (oh yeah, dont mem that anymore, need the slot for Yaulp V, thx~) to zone OUT when it goes bad.  Hope nobody is camping the fort or Zone out, they gonna be in big trouble when I train their butts to hell and gone. <br />
<br />
As for Charisis, just how do you suppose I'm gonna get my corpse back if/when it goes bad, mem up my new improved pet hammer?  Zone requires Invis just to get to, cant bind outside like Sebilis unless you are on good terms with Venril Sathir which your about to destroy for going inside and to top it all off, after we BUY or BEG a port to Skyfire we get to run KoS through 2 zones.  Zone into a hot landing zone where mobs HT for ~650 points, but this is okay because you have seen it work on Test Server once, and it only worked in these zones because it's the only place in the game where low blues can be single pulled that happens to allow us to mem up a couple of our truly useable offensive spells, Undead nukes and dots.<br />
<br />
GO BACK TO THE DRAWING BOARDS!  These fixes dont fix anything.  You guys are proving you know exactly jack and squat about clerics, priest classes in general and what their current capabilities are, what these changes will do, and what game balance is.  <br />
<br />
Fix healing by giving Druids a group heal that can be used often enough to mitigate AE's from boss mobs, a nice phat heal for them that is much higher than 400 mana would do also, the new Druid CH is fine at 10 seconds but bump it to 600 mana.  Why the heck should they get the same cast time, the same mana cost and the same amount of HP's healed?  go parse a clerics CH logs sometime.  Not a raiding cleric from one of the top 3 guilds on a server that makes 5% or less of the cleric population, Joe Avg Cleric, see what his CH's hit for.... SURPRISE!!!  Same amount of hitpoints.  Roughly 3k unless he is letting the tank get near dead.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Velisaris</div><div class="date">08-23-2002, 07:13 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm sorry, I don't see much good coming out of that post.<br />
<br />
Yes, I appreciate the fact that peole at VI are actually posting to the cleric board (it's like Bigfoot...quick, someone get a screenshot so we'll have proof).  But what they're doing is the equivalent of &quot;patch healing&quot; in-game.  They're throwing a few random things at us in an attempt to get us to shut up.<br />
<br />
Unless they add something to the game that just entirely blows us away, I think we should feel insulted at these changes.  The fact remains that they took one of the cleric's core abilities (complete heal) and casually gave it to the other priest classes...at a fairly decent level to boot.  Give a cheal type spell to druids/shamans at 54, yet only give clerics new spells 56+...yeah that makes sense :rolleyes: <br />
<br />
I don't WANT to be a battlecleric....I don't know of any 50+ clerics that do either.  The goobers who call themselves &quot;battleclerics&quot; are lvl 10 twinks who can still melee like a warrior.  Do I want to be able to solo decently if I can't find a group (though I'd much rather be in a group)...yes.  Do I want to melee in exp groups...no.  I LIKE being the healer...I LIKE being responsible for the health of the group.  Telling me that I shouldn't worry that I won't be doing any healing in exp groups because I can stand up and hit the mob every tenth swing, maybe get a proc every fourth hit, is a f'ing insult to me.  If I wanted to beat on things, I would have made a paladin.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Saarem</div><div class="date">08-23-2002, 07:17 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Sorry Rich but I was soloing HS zone in and Chardok zone in with regular nukes before (of course I had to spend 11pp / invis to get there as clerics dont get invis). This aint exactly going to change it except you given away the last chances for exp groups...<br />
<br />
Raid healing? Dont cut it. Ask the druids, shamans etc. This wont do nothing for them above Velk / Vindi level encounters because it aint good enough for that due to beeing so slow to cast. Shamans asked for a non group heal to help, druids wanted to be better patch healing. So why not give them that? High mana, high hp fast casting with a 10 or 20 sec recast spell (2k hp healed, 600m 2 sec casting time 20 sec recast, you get the idea). And / or a group heal spell (something asked by druids not sure on shamans).<br />
<br />
As for lets invite a cleric for X, no group is going to invite a cleric for their melee power. Rogues, rangers, monks etc do it much better. Even a druid/shaman who do all healing without using any mana for damage still got mana free dots, snares, ds, buffs etc as rightclick to give them a edge over a cleric damage wise in a exp group.</div></div><hr />

Clerics are going to receive additional changes so that they have some abilities that makes them more sought after for grouping.  The final ability choices will be made after this first set of changes is evaluated and tested more extensively.  <br />
<br />
Personally I am gonna withhold judgement until these 'additional changes' that makes us 'more sought after for grouping' are revealed. Although I must admit to a cynical belief that the second sentence above means that VI don't actually know what these additional changes ARE yet:<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh crap they're still not happy... guys what were those extra contingency measures you had lined up?&quot;<br />
&quot;We... uh... unnerf mark of karn! That'll do it!&quot;<br />
<br />
Although Rich + Scott + the new team are certainly an improvement on Abashi in terms of tone (although they could still use some work on PR: hint, if you are going to introduce changes half of which negatively impact a class and half of which positively impact a class, introduce them all at the same time), this now is their crucial test in terms of delivery.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Elasto</div><div class="date">08-23-2002, 07:22 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">It's a bit of a contradiction though.<br />
<br />
We want to be less bored in groups and on raids so they are giving us the ability to melee as well as nuke and heal, and we are complaining 'who wants to be a battle cleric?'<br />
<br />
What we'd *really* like would be to go back to the good old days when dungeon crawling was hard and adrenaline filled and a cleric had to be on top form, but those days are basically long gone. Nor does most of the population *want* to have to rely on a cleric for dungeon grouping or raids. And most clerics felt a little guilty knowing that when they told the group they were gonna log they knew the group would basically break up cos of it.<br />
<br />
We are gonna have to compromise a little here guys..</div></div><hr />

Highlighted this for Jahaar + anyone else from VI checking this post. The importance of your as-yet-unrevelaed further changes (and no, what we've seen already ISN'T enough) really cannot be overstated. There are still some of us who have faith in your creativity - please don't let us down.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Saarem</div><div class="date">08-23-2002, 07:27 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Actually Elasto there is a middle road. Add several highend dungeons that are exactly that hard and rewards you for it exp wise for going there with nasty twists like chain mobs (see exactly in the stickied post) and have middle dungeons where any healer (CT level and lower) will do and solo places like FG/Velk when you only got a hour or dont feel like grouping.<br />
<br />
That would mean you can get exp regardless of group set up and can go solo if you only got a short time. A group can also move up and down in dungeons depending on their set up and who has to go/come. Clerics wont be supreme and needed unless you want to take on that high risk high exp dungeon. Heck, you can only make it as ONE dungeon but have that multispawning dungeon function for it to force that every dungeon is done by a 6 man group only and no extra outside bots to make it easier.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Elasto</div><div class="date">08-23-2002, 07:33 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I agree. I think that we will have a big big place in PoP dungeons where you *wont* be allowed to take in more than 6 people.<br />
<br />
I actually had big hopes for Luclin in that regard, but I am confident PoP will deliver and I look forward to it a lot.<br />
<br />
I think these new CH spells wont affect clerics much *if* they raise the level limit on them to, say, 58 or 59. But I do think the other priests need a stronger heal than 600 pts in their 50s, it's pathetic; I think natures touch should be lowered in level at the very least.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kaysha Soulsinger</div><div class="date">08-23-2002, 07:40 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Personally, I am happy to see an official word on the boards (and like someone said, grab a camera, so we have proof for prosterity! :p ), so thank you for that.<br />
<br />
Also, I wish to thank you for the changes to our solo-ing capabilities. It just isn't fun to have to bail out when fighting three critters that are 20 levels below you and who simply *own* you ... shouldn't my /con to them be &quot;what would you like your tombstone to say?&quot; instead of &quot;get ready for a good laugh!&quot; ;). So thanks for this addition.<br />
<br />
I'll reserve my criticism for now, since I don't play on test, don't know how things will work out, and realising that this is just a part of something that is much needed right now, with another part upcoming yet which is not as much needed (but still needed anyway!).<br />
<br />
Thank you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">barnaby</div><div class="date">08-23-2002, 07:41 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I find it funny that now some people are saying how good these changes are just because VI posted an &quot;explanation&quot;.  This seems like a crock to me.<br />
<br />
1.)  I'm lvl 55 and if the changes go into effect I will no longer be needed in a group because NONE of the changes listed are for my lvl or below.  What kind of sick joke is that?<br />
<br />
2.) Yalup V might be useful if it didn't last all of 2 seconds and might not even stack with some of our buffs!?.<br />
<br />
3.)  Who cares about the hammer?  I think it would be utterly worthless!  Like others have pointed out, how are you going to melee if you get killed in 10 seconds?  The hammer lasts for only ONE mob, it would probably be more mana effecient to just nuke the darn things.  <br />
<br />
4.) What good is bash?  We have more than enough good stuns.<br />
<br />
5.)  Well I'm glad that a cleric duo can do Cazic because once I SOLO to lvl 60 they will be the only class who will group with me :( <br />
<br />
In short I think everyone appreciates the fact that you at least came here and let us know what is going on but frankly the proposed changes are absolutely horrible and useless.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sumeine Bertoxx</div><div class="date">08-23-2002, 07:42 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Clerics have always been a group class. With the new changes for durids and shamen you just take the last part of our initial job and throw it to the dustbin. Better melee skills will NOT make us wanted in groups. Suuure we can heal but I'd still take 2 druids over a druid and a cleric since BOTH druids can heal, buff, debuff, nuke, snare, evac, DoT, SoW etc. All a cleric can do is HP buff, heal and now melee for laughs...HAHA! Funny joke!<br />
<br />
Also our defensive skills SUCK! With dodge capped at 75 I dodge like one hit every 150 hits against no matter what mobs...and even greenies have no problem in interrupting my casting a 4 secs spell. with an AC nearing 1k buffed mobs still beat the crudding out of me and they even do it with clerics reaching 1400AC UNBUFFED. Give us bash? With a lower cap than other melee? Heck a cleric wields a MACE and a SHIELD when born! I used these 2 items when I was still wearing pampers and I used them before I could walk! In that reason clerics should definately get bash and dodge caps of 250 because these skills, along with healing, are the predicament of the class. since we use shields we should also get a block skill capped around 100. But wait...you took away our healing and our rezzing...so why give us better defense skills if you'd then have to justify them to the melees? I bet they would fear that warriors would lose their job as MA and I bet you'd soon see main tanking clerics.<br />
<br />
Take the easy choice, let the cleric class die. Please don't give us gimp changes if you wish to save the class, give us something REAL:<br />
<br />
<br />
Melee skills:<br />
-block skill capped at 100 if a shield is worn<br />
-dodge significantly raised - 200+<br />
-offense raised to 220, 1hb and 2hb raised to 220 (we are specialists of these weapons and should at least get decent ATK values through skills)<br />
-bash capped at 250 (dmg cap lower than tank classes but higher chance to stun)<br />
<br />
Magic skills:<br />
<br />
-MUCH higher channeling skills (mobs hitting once can EASILY interrupt us)<br />
-Faster nukes with lower recast<br />
-Self only melee buffs (bane dmg to &quot;evil&quot; and &quot;undead&quot; added to weapon, self GOOD haste (35% or more) etc)<br />
-New heal over time spells that heal over 10 ticks but heal a lower amount of HP per tick (50hp for the first heal in this line, 150 for the best one) - SELF only<br />
<br />
Give us something that helps us soloing if you so much want to utterly destroy our role in groups (which is amazingly enough HEALING).<br />

<br />
Being able to click yaulp 5 for better than clarity while medding on a horse seems verging on overpowered. It means clerics now have access to 13 mana/tick on top of medding(!)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kokoba</div><div class="date">08-23-2002, 07:53 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks for posting this here Ritch.<br />
<br />
Here some feedback:<br />
<br />
So the Cleric will change into a Battle Cleric?<br />
Well, Im not really suprised.<br />
At this point of EQ Im affraid there is no other solutions.<br />
<br />
I will not say that I love this change.<br />
I specifically choose the Cleric class to be able to group and heal.<br />
But I will deal with it.<br />
After 3 years+, its evident that a game like EQ have to change.<br />
<br />
But if I have to melee, I dont want to be a ghetto meleer.<br />
If I have to solo, I want to solo efficiently.<br />
<br />
<br />
I made a post about what the cleric should receive without knowing your post.<br />
I will just repeat 2 things here:<br />
<br />
<br />
1) Our solo capability must be on par with necros/quadding peoples<br />
<br />
I really dont think Yaulp+hammer will be enough.<br />
This is why I suggested a change of the melee table and increase attack/defense.<br />
I really hope you will balance this correctly.<br />
<br />
<br />
2) Summoned weapons are wrong<br />
<br />
We cant rely on a single weapon.<br />
All clerics will have to use the same weapon. Thats wrong.<br />
A casual cleric 56 will have the same power than a cleric 60 in a guild VT able.<br />
<br />
I understand its hard to balance the Cleric melee power with all the old weapons already<br />
in game but its mandatory.<br />
<br />
<br />
Well, at this point its hard to see what will really appens.<br />
Wait and See.<br />

<br />
It's got to be a tough task, considering cleric themselves cant even agree on what they need. I look forward to trying out the new changes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Loral1</div><div class="date">08-23-2002, 07:59 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">There is a much more sinister force at play.  For the last 110 years I have spent most of my adventuring career keeping blade-swingers alive and reading up on the lore of the Iksar, the Akhevans, the Claws of Veeshan and the Coldain.  It hasn't been the most physically strenuous job.<br />
<br />
Now I may become one of those weapon-swingers myself.  How am I supposed to do that with these skinny frail arms?  One time I was reaching for a discarded firebeetle eye and my back went out for three days!  I even had some gnomes build a pulley system to cart me in my heavy armor from camp to camp although I resent the &quot;heal on a stick&quot; comment they keep tossing around.  For 110 years my runners legs have grown pretty well.  I have lungs built from a thousand runs away from such horrid beasts such as pumas, small mushrooms, and cacti.  Now I must face these epic creatures in combat!<br />
<br />
Will there be some kind of battle-cleric basic training so we don't end up bashing ourselves in the head?  Will new foodstuffs be created to build these skinny arms into those of Antonius Bayle?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Balki</div><div class="date">08-23-2002, 08:03 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">First off, I think that its good they recognize there is a problem.  I just think they are going about fixing it the wrong way.  I know that I would love to put away a club with stats and a proc for a summoned hammer that just procs and no stats, not to mention that we have to waste time/mana summoning.  Ah, but added to that is Yalp V.  It lasts what 4 ticks? and adds 10mana per tick at a cost of 25 to cast.  Gee, you gain 15 points of mana over a 24 second time period.  Cast this 100-200 more times and you might be full mana again.  As far as rushing into battle to go toe-to-toe with a mob, someone is seriously deluding themselves.  If your in a group, the rest of your party members are going to have problems with you attacking when you could be getting mana back.  Again, I am glad they are thinking about us clerics, I just think they need to spend more time thinking and do the job right.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">barnaby</div><div class="date">08-23-2002, 08:04 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Read changes on Yalup V.  even if it is 100 mana a tick it lasts for what 2.5 ticks.  Yeah, I'll just get on my horse and it'll all be good:eek:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kanroc</div><div class="date">08-23-2002, 08:05 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">What really strikes me as being backward is replacing any of the tovn/ssra/vt bonkers with a summoned hammer with useless stats.  I was a little bothered bagging my epic a while back for a blackstar, seeing the effort of finishing that miserable quest being relegated to click&amp;bag.<br />
<br />
Now I get to bag net 150hp, 100+ mana, and resists for a summoned hammer?  And countless other GOOD STAT weapons on many other clerics.  Excuse me if I don't praise your insight.  Making endgame items from each expansion is NOT the way to 'balance' us, I'm sorry.<br />
<br />
Its great that clerics are being looked at, and I very much want to believe that good things will come of it, but the offerings thusfar haven't been particularly encouraging.  The only spell that gives me any pause for consideration is ethereal remedy.  The drawbacks of the others outweigh the benefit, in my opinion, and my spell lineup won't be changing.<br />
<br />
In my experience, clerics don't need more varied healing.  What we've got does the job, and 'upgrading' it with slow, costly heals does nothing measurable for viability in a group, raid, or solo.<br />
<br />
I'll hold out judgement on yaulpV, until I've had a chance to play with it if it goes to live servers.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kaysha Soulsinger</div><div class="date">08-23-2002, 08:10 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yaulp V costs 10 mana now and generates 40 over 4 ticks. This makes for a 30 mana gain over 4 ticks by casting Yaulp V, or better said an effective 7,5 mana per tick. That's better than Clarity. And even better, it seems to stack with pretty much any mana regeneration ... the only drawback is that you have to cast it every 24 seconds. This will separate the lazy from the fervous :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">A11e</div><div class="date">08-23-2002, 08:11 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">This TOTALLY misses the boat.  Clerics will not get groups because we have suddenly become &quot;battle clerics&quot; at level 56.  I don't want to be a battle cleric.  Why do I have to abruptly change my style of play RADICALLY when I reach level 56?  From levels 29- 55, I medded and healed.  Now I am supposed to jump up and start meleeing?  Umm Rich, WHAT HAVE YOU AND THE DEV TEAM BEEN SMOKING?<br />
<br />
Verant has made 3 (1 proposed) changes of late that affect cleric viability significantly:<br />
<br />
1.  AA abilities for other classes (rengen, stamina,healing, ect. - reduce need for healing)<br />
2.  10% healing boost across the board for non-clerics)<br />
3.  Proposed 75% CHeals<br />
<br />
We are losing grouping opportunities.  What we need is the ability to solo when we can't group.  These proposed changes WON'T give that to us.  Druids and shaman are among the best soloers in the game THROUGH OUT THEIR ENTIRE GAME LIFE.  <br />
<br />
Look at cleric skills:<br />
<br />
1HB cap 175<br />
Defense cap 200<br />
Dodge cap 75<br />
No parry<br />
No riposte<br />
No block<br />
No dual wield<br />
No double attack<br />
<br />
For melee to be viable for us we have to be able to actually HIT the mob.  Missing coupled with the frequency of our swings is the problem.  Most Melees have decent haste at Level 56% - look at their epics for example.  What you offer is too little way too late in our game life.<br />
<br />
You talk about adding bash at level 25.  Clerics stopped melee and devoted their full time to healing at level 29 or so.  WE WONT HAVE ANY BASH SKILLS IF WE DONT MELEE.  At lower levels we have to SIT to regain mana.<br />
<br />
Rich - you can't radically change our play style starting at level 56.  <br />
<br />
Suggestions?<br />
A real cleric hammer pet equivalent to a shaman pet AT THE SAME LEVEL that shaman receive theirs.  <br />
<br />
Some lower level spells/abilities that allow clerics to become accustomed to the proposed uber melee we are supposed to become at level 56.  <br />
<br />
Give clerics some spells that will allow us to solo a little better!  Drop the double check resist on our stuns - one for damage, the other for stun.  Better yet, TAKE OUT THE DAMAGE COMPONENT ALL TOGETHER.  Stuns get resisted far to often and the tiny addition to the damage of a group is inconsequential.<br />
<br />
How about some better undead nukes?  Clerics should be on a par with druids, magicians and wizards when it comes to killing undead.  And how about stop mixing live mobs with undead mobs all the time?  We need undead ONLY zones to be effective.</div></div><hr />

Its not all about the weapon you are wielding.<br />
I have avatar, 41 haste, and scf2, working now to scf3. this was even before the druid cheals were anounced. Will be interesting to see how it will work out.</div></div><hr />

I think it is wrong that those who have worked hard to get a blackstar (not me) are going to bag them in almost every situation but a heal chain. <br />
<br />
I do hope VI has the foresight not to make the druid/shaman changes live before  implementing the alleged &quot;additional changes so that they have some abilities that makes them more sought after for grouping&quot;.  If not, I am going to be spending a lot of time soloing.</div></div><hr />

This doesn't seem like the best idea to me. I mean we have a low cap no extra melee skills, plus many of us don't have our melee skills maxxed (not counting defense). And adding bash at lvl 30ish hmm... Well lets see I guess i finnaly found a use for all those training points I have sitting around. For those of us that are 50+ this is going to be a real B&amp;%$H to lvl up. So we get to melee for our exp now... our whole gaming experience has been not to melee, it's always been better to toss out a nuke if you're FM. All I can say is this is FUBAR. All  this does is make clerics gimp paladins. Not the reason I play a cleric. Is this really suposed to make me glad druids can now heal nearly as well as me (most of my Cheal hit for the 2.5-3kish range), and solo way better than me?</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sera</div><div class="date">08-23-2002, 08:34 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks for spending the time to come here and post, Rich...but no thanks for our &quot;enhancements&quot;<br />
<br />
**edited out rudeness - Rayne** ...Clerics are CASTERS...why are you wasting potential meaningful upgrades with melee enhancements?<br />
<br />
- Provide clerics with useful group and raid roles as other priests gain raid quality healing <br />
- Decrease the cleric's mandatory dependancy on grouping for any reasonable gain <br />
- Increase the level of variety and interest involved in playing a cleric <br />
<br />
In response to that dribble...<br />
<br />
1. We already have/had a useful group role. It was called healing. But Druids can handle that now, and do the other 6,000 abilities they have. Yes we have a mandatory raid role. So do Shaman. rogues, etc....are you powering up their rivals and giving them a bunch of crap in return? Perhaps it's time for you Devs to stop reading FoH to learn about how your high end game works.<br />
<br />
<br />
2. Decrease mandatory dependency? I probably already know the answer to this, but are any of you Dev's actually playing clerics from day to day? If you actually knew **** about the cleric class, you would realize that we are already unneeded in high level exp grinds. Unless youre talking about CT, we just aren't 'mandatory' like the newb factory likes to think when bashing clerics.<br />
<br />
3. Variety and interest? Did you guys forget that the Paladin class existed in this game? I thought they were supposed to be the &quot;battle clerics&quot;. Do you have no idea AT ALL on how to balance clerics? You see what you're doing...giving a caster class bash? Thanks, I'll bash the mob and have it beat the **** out of me! At least I can loot my epic and rez myself. I didn't choose my cleric to melee or add DPS to the group. If you want to justify this gross power up to Druids by giving me pathetic melee skills and a mana regen buff that doesn't stack with ****...well I say no thanks. <br />
<br />
That's my opinion, perhaps rather aggravated, but I stand by it. I'm sure I'll get banned from these boards for it too :)<br />
<br />
<br />
Oh wait, anyone who would probably know how to fix this problem now works at Sigil, or Blizzard or some other company with it's head OUT of its ass.<br />

A much more effective way would be to add two self buffs, one with a +dex/+dd effect for normal mobs, and a second with a higher damage +dex/+dd effect for undead.  Then, Clerics could continue to use the weapons they have earned, and benefit from some retunning.  It would also give a benefit to the clerics with the better melee weapons, which they have earned.  Heck, I think it would be interesting to add a -small- +mana effect to the proc, so that clerics actually have a reason to melee.</div></div><hr />

<br />
As a Cleric I've spent 2.5 years sitting on my butt with a nice big tank to protect me.  Now I get to tank and hit stuff ?<br />
<br />
Thats a huge adjustment for alot of Cleric's to make,  personally I'm looking forward to the change, but I certainly don't expect everyone to feel the same.<br />
<br />
If Verant walked in, totally overhauled your class, and gave you what had up to that point been the one thing you were taught through out your career to avoid, you'd be a bit confused, scared, and angry too.<br />
<br />
As Loral brought up rather amusingly -  a good proportion of us have never really melee'd.  We've tanked through healing aggro, but that usually only lasts untill someone gets it off us, or it's mezzed.<br />
<br />
We have a great deal to learn and adjust to.  Try and be a little understanding.<br />
<br />
My biggest concern, is finding where I put the &quot;melee attack&quot; key.  I haven't seen it in so long ....  <br />

At the moment, level 55+, besides heal spells, buffs, rezzes, theres nothing worth casting. <br />
<br />
IMO they are just fixing broken spell lines, like the summon hammer line that is utterly useless now they are actually making it a viable spell along with the Yaulp line which with the dex buff, haste, and small mana regen is a much better combat spell than the old ones were intended to be.</div></div><hr />

<br />
When/If bash goes live...are we going to have a spend a skill point to get it?  I have zero skill points available.  I went crazy a while back and decided to blow the 120 or so that I'd saved up over time on stuff like getting a few tradeskills to 20, learning elder dragon, and other crap that really hasn't been all that useful.  Why did I blow them?  Because they were there, and I never ever imagined that Verant would be so nice as to give us Bash.  <br />
<br />
Can I /petition for a single skill point?  Or are those of us that have zero skill points remaining just screwed.  <br />
<br />
A rather moot point since my account will be inactive by the time this change happens (not being pessimistic, I think my account expires at the end of August), and I have no real plans to reinstate it, but just wondering here what would happen to others in my situation.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I do hope since you are trying to make us melee's that you up our 1hb to at least 200 like shamans.  Why we've been stuck at 175 when Verant envisioned &quot;Battle Clerics&quot; is beyond me.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Druids whine...they get the healing penalty removed, DoTs unnerfed, DoT stacking, and a scaled down version of complete heal.<br />

Clerics complain...we get healing spells that aren't needed and crappy melee spells no self respecting cleric would have used in a group IF we could still out-heal druids and shamans.<br />

<br />
<br />
Just because you get a summon'd weapon doesn't make you a stupid battle cleric. You dont have to use it. Its for the clerics that want to actually do something besides sit on their ass. And if you still just want to sit on your ass and heal, you still are the healer type that will be picked in most situation. Giving Shm and Dru a CH doesn't do much to anything. People will still prefer clerics in most situations. <br />
<br />
Picking a Shaman over a Cleric in a hardcore group would be stupid. I dont know how much mana CH is, but shamans usually use all their mana on Slow, buffs, DoTs. <br />
<br />
Im sure groups would still love to have both a cleric and a shaman in their group, and now its even more effective.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Adon</div><div class="date">08-23-2002, 09:08 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">My biggest beef with the changes are these:<br />
<br />
1) Without increased weapon skills, increased offense, increased defense, block, parry, and a different melee table, &quot;battle clerics&quot; are just not viable, no matter what kind of uber proc rate you give this &quot;weapon&quot;.<br />
<br />
2) I can solo Chardok entrance just fine as it is.  Thats not quad kiting nor is it killing Lodizal solo.  You want to bring the priests in balance? Give us the power to do something on scale with quadding or soloing something with 32k+ hitpoints (hint : undead)<br />
<br />
3) I don't like having to bag all my hard earned weapons to be balanced. The use of a summoned hammer is insulting for those of us with Hammer of the Sun, Epic, Blackstar, Righteousness, etc.  Yaulp 5 should add a proc to our weapons that does what the hammer does (75-150dd that procs a ton).  Don't choose our weapons for us.<br />
<br />
4) Still looking for : self invis ; undead snare ; undead slow.<br />

<br />
You should go to another board, I am sure you will be banned from this one unless your attitude and posting style gets some adjustment.<br />
<br />
To your comment, I think actually that a group which chooses a cleric over a shaman to grind AAs is rather stupid before this change goes in.  Afterwards? Well, goodness they'd be really silly in all but the most difficult places to get exp, such as 4c in Cazic Thule.  In those places you would need a shaman AND a cleric though to do anything without a corpse run possibility.<br />
<br />
As for your comment on the proc rate of this hammer, did it occur to you that some of us like wielding the epic? Or weilding a blackstar? Or wielding a dawnfire? Or a righteousness? Or a hammer of the sun? Mace of Dark thoughts?<br />
<br />
These are weapons we spent DKP on, quested for, spent large sums of money on...it saddens me that we should all have to keep those beautiful weapons bagged because our fix involves a cleric-wide bandage weapon.<br />

Look for the CH thread there. Read what your fellow shamans who actually play the game says about the change. As for procing, I got a 295 fire dd procing hammer from VP but I dont pretend that I can do good damage with it. This hammer was not introduced as a toy, it was introduced as a way for clerics to up their damage in group which will not happend, it was there to say we can solo better etc which I can do now as well. Clerics are not the best healers and with Canni so can a shaman produce enough mana for healing, slowing and dots without blinking.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Even with the new Yaulp and the Summoned Hammer, melee still won't be effective because:<br />
<br />
1: We need to be move to a better melee table<br />
2: We need 1hb and 2hb caps raised <br />
3: Offense and Defense need to be upgraded as well.<br />
4: Channeling has to be upgraded/fixed in addition to AA skills.  A 1dam hit and we're interrupted sucks.<br />
5: We need the ability to imbue our EXISTING weapons with an undead proc otherwise you've invalidated EVERY cleric weapon currently in the game.<br />
<br />
and while we're at it. If you want to make things equal...<br />
<br />
1: give us MEANINGFUL right click effects on our armor like you have for EVERY other class. Summon food/water aint gonna do much for us as it stands right now.<br />
2: remove the damage potion from our stuns and make them less resistable.<br />
3: raise the softcap on AC. Right now 1100 or 1400 doesn't make a difference for a cleric.<br />
4: give us meaningful dots at least CLOSE to shamans and druids. Shamans have 2k dots while we can't even break 1k.<br />
<br />
I could make a list that goes on forever but you guys SHOULD understand all of this by now. Just a note though...<br />
<br />
All of these proposed changes make our grouping situation WORSE. Those few spells WILL NOT help us with our grouping problems.<br />
<br />
I have been 58 for months and despite my constant harassment to my guild to get exp groups, I've only gotten 1 yellow bubble during that time. It's almost impossible to exp NOW, with these changes I will be FORCED to retire. If I wanted to sit in the bazaar and chat, I'd go on IRC for free.<br />

I guess we didn't need to have faith until RIGHT NOW because those changes are going to be very blurry until we see how much groups *really* appreciate the changes compared to a CHing druid/shammy (I have little faith on this..) and how viable will those changes be for late night solos/duos when there isn't any need for a cleric nearby.</div></div><hr />

<br />
1) Some time back we were given Judgement.  925 damage for 325 mana.  Our best undead DD is 725 damage for 250 mana.  Now, crunching the numbers, if Judgement did 17 more damage, these 2 spells would be identical in efficiency.  Way back when, I used to be an undead specialist, now there is no reasen to mem expel undead.  I have literally cast Sense the Dead 10 times more than Expel undead over the past 6 months.  We need an upgrade to this spell so clerics might be persuaded to mem undead based spells again, give us 1k damage for 300 mana, or 1100 for 325.<br />
<br />
2) Cleric DoTs are not considered affliction, and therefore do not get the benefits of Extended Affliction and Affliction Efficiency focus items.  It was rather irritating getting a Bone Clapsed Girdle and seeing that root and karn were afflictions, but my afflictions were not.  Could this be fixed plz?  Thx ^_^</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kelval</div><div class="date">08-23-2002, 09:37 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well Rich, thanks for coming here and telling us ahead what will happen to our class, but I am not thrilled at all.<br />
<br />
The druid and shaman heal increase is a good idea raid wise in my opinion. However, it makes us even more useless in exp groups. How can we compete with those class when all we have to offer is more (unneeded) hps in our buffs, and better (unneeded) heals?<br />
<br />
So you offer us more heals in compensation, and the 'joy' of being a battle cleric?<br />
<br />
Let's look into those heals. <br />
-The group Cel Healing is close to useless.1025 mana for at best 6000 hps healed in 4 tics? Who are you trying to fool? It's mana/heal ratio is barely better than Words of Restoration, that will heal your group in one chunk and cure it from any slow/disease at the same time. Single target heal over time are interesting because they have a better mana ratio than normal heals, if you remove this argulent, there is close to nothing left for them.<br />
- Celestial light, 1680 for 525 mana and 5 secs of cast time. What is the improvement? It's the same mana/hps ratio, we heal more hps in the same given time, but is there a use for it? Barely. It will overheal on nearly any caster. So that can be a patch heal when I don't have time to land a CHeal... For 1/8 of my mana bar. Great!<br />
- Hammer of gimp solo, and Yaulp V. I might use the hammer when I am not near a mob that AEs, because it has 35hps on it and I am still wearing my epic. Yaulp is close to useless. I will not wear off BaotR so I can sit off every 24 secs and cast a spell gives me the equivalent of 1 more mana per tic.<br />
<br />
Who are you trying to fool with your battle cleric? <br />
First I don't want it. That's not why I chosed this class for. If I wanted to be a paladin, I would have rolled a paladin 3 years ago.<br />
Second, those changes will not make us battle clerics, they will make us dead clerics that tried to melee. We are nowhere close to any melee skill wise, and we won't be unless you make some major changes.<br />
<br />
I don't want to solo, I want to group dammit! Raising our solo abilities is clearly the worst way to deal with our problem.<br />
<br />
So now, in the end, I won't be needed for groups anymore, I won't be able to solo effectively, despite the 'super' new changes that you are giving us, my raid effectiveness will not be as much as it used to be because some other classes are starting to eat in the same plate as me??<br />
<br />
Now at least preserve our raid effectiveness please. Give us more versatility since that's what you want to. Give us some 1 sec/1500hps/350 mana with 3 minutes recast so we can finally save that chanter that tashed too early. Finally give us better buffs than that Heroic bond+ Aegis + symbol that is called Aegolism. How come I still have, in my normal setup, 4 pre Kunark spells and 4 Kunark spells up? Was there no improvement till then? How come I only use three spells post Kunark ( Mark or Retribution, Aego and group Aego) at all?<br />
<br />
I am all for more healing power to the other priest classes, but make it so we are still that 'special one'. Give us something new for once. Because we endure the Complete healing curse ( that is a curse because the game designers made it so any encounter requires a CHeal chain), we will never get any significant upgrade?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brazzo</div><div class="date">08-23-2002, 09:37 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Instead of making a summoned hammer, which completely negates ALL WEAPONS FOR CLERICS IN THE GAME, make the 'hammer' proc instead a buff that adds a melee proc (much like Divine Might for paladins). <br />
<br />
is it even remotely possible that they will add these same features to other cleric weapons?  remember when they added the first focus affects to summoned mage items so that they would enter the economy faster and get tested more thoroughly?<br />
<br />
Clerics have been using this at zone in at Charsis and Chardok huh? Well I am overwhelmed. 2 zone in's where you have to have Invis to get to and at least in Chardok you can DB (oh yeah, dont mem that anymore, need the slot for Yaulp V, thx~) to zone OUT when it goes bad. Hope nobody is camping the fort or Zone out, they gonna be in big trouble when I train their butts to hell and gone.  <br />
<br />
forgive the guy for making an example rather than enumerating all the zones in the entire game.  there's no special fix to chardok and charasis on test that makes it only possible to solo at their entrances.  if you can solo at chardok, you can solo at a lot of places.  if you can solo at a lot of places with melee, your damage will benefit a group anywhere in the game.<br />
<br />
- Decrease the cleric's mandatory dependancy on grouping for any reasonable gain<br />
<br />
2. Decrease mandatory dependency? I probably already know the answer to this, but are any of you Dev's actually playing clerics from day to day? If you actually knew shit about the cleric class, you would realize that we are already unneeded in high level exp grinds. Unless youre talking about CT, we just aren't 'mandatory' like the newb factory likes to think when bashing clerics. <br />
<br />
<br />
take note of the fact that he is saying &quot;the cleric's mandatory dependency&quot; and not &quot;the group's mandatory dependency&quot;.  he's saying he wants you to be able to solo.<br />
<br />
<br />
this board is absolutely amazing to me.  i stopped reading this board back when the balancing started and it became clear that it was being overwhelmed by a large contingency felt that we would be best balanced by changing our role to mini-paladin by increasing our melee abilities and giving us standing meditation.  it pissed me off a lot that there was such outcry to turn the class 180 degrees four years into the game just so that your sekret yearning to be a paladin could be satisfied.<br />
<br />
now they're making the exact changes you asked for!!!!  and all you have to offer up is venom that they're not doing it a certain way.<br />
<br />
i'm still not happy that our role is being changed.  however, i do understand that the purpose of the test server is for testing, and i am hoping that at the end of the testing the change that they are making will at least be useful to us.  wait and see.<br />
<br />
in the meantime, here is another thing to think about.  if cleric's are able to approach their sitting mana regen while standing, clerics will be that much better in situations where the group is crawling around the dungeon rather than sitting and pulling to one spot.  a lot of people find that situation fun to be in, and this only makes it more possible</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Amris</div><div class="date">08-23-2002, 09:39 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well.  I'm glad you adressed our concerns here.<br />
<br />
However, may I say this:<br />
<br />
What about me?  I'm level 54, I won't have the summonable hammer of uberness.  Or the spell of superpowerness.  So... what about me?  <br />
<br />
Not only that, but MOR does 15 points of damage.  A druid DS does what, 25 at my level, if I remember correctly?  Someone correct me on that if I'm wrong (you know you want to).<br />
So no one's going to invite me to exp group on the basis of my 15 point DS, especially if they've got any kind of slower in the group- say an epic ranger... or a shaman... or an enchanter.<br />
<br />
Thank you for telling us that at level 58 we can solo if we have to, but what about before that?<br />
<br />
Secondly.  I must say, it bugs me severely that you're suggesting that we group with other clerics.  It rather comes off as that's going to be the only people that want us.  Not that I don't think that's likely true, because if this trend continues, that probably WILL be true.  But that bothers me.  That hugely bothers me.<br />
<br />
Furthermore, you are taking a class which, by YOUR design has NOT been a melee class, and telling us that now our ability to advance is dependant upon melee.  I must ask you, do you realize how many of us will die, and how often, trying to get up to any skill level in weapons?  What about those of us who DID skill up our melee, but only 2hb? Or are only level 54?  52?  50? <br />
<br />
The change of giving these spells at 54 means that clerics all the way down to level 49 will be effected.  A level 50 group can EASILY, and EFFICIENTLY take a level 54 druid or shaman for healing over a level 50 cleric, because the level 50 cleric has even LESS utility than a level 54 cleric... (assuming that the level 54 cleric got the uber rare dropping, hard to land DS- MOR, as well as the mana hog Retribution).  AND, assuming that they can afford to buy the spell.<br />
<br />
What you are telling us is that the high end (level 60) game is being fixed, and not to worry.<br />
<br />
That doesn't help those of us who have yet to get there.  We are still worried, and you are still ignoring us while it is US that this will have the BIGGEST impact on.<br />
<br />
Please don't give me the excuse that 50 to 60 is over with when you reach 60.  That's obvious.  What I ask you to consider is this:  HOW DO WE GET THERE.  Not only are you taking away our groups, you are NOT giving the LOW (level 50 to 58) clerics any compensation for having our groups stolen from us.<br />
<br />
While I appreciate your response to the level 60 clerics, this is nothing but smoke and mirrors to those of us lower than 60.  Another carrot to dangle in front of us while you ruin our ability to ever reach that carrot.</div></div><hr />

Without changes to our defensive skills and offensive skills standing toe to toe an blue con mob is SUICIDE.   Unsure where you guys are testing and how those &quot;test&quot; subjects are geared, but being a middle equiped cleric, I get hammered HARD (no pun intended)   The skills caps for those items have to be addressed.<br />
<br />
2.  The summoned hammer is &quot;nice&quot; but there are several issues with it.<br />
<br />
     a)  Argo?  Will it generate sufficient argo that the tank is going to have problems.  <br />
<br />
     b)  Why should those with nicer, higher end weapons be forced to bag them for this item?  <br />
<br />
     c)  Should we all be relegated to having the same weapon as an end result of caster balance?<br />
<br />
3.  Why are we being given melee skills instead of caster ones?  Why is the &quot;battlecleric&quot; route the one of preference?  <br />
<br />
<br />
How are clerics supposed to be distinct from paladins?  Clerics were always a parent class of Paladins, but we're now being driven to be more like Paladins.  I have no desire to be a paladin.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Xorena</div><div class="date">08-23-2002, 09:51 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Why don't we wait to see the changes before we get all up in arms about this?<br />
<br />
I love my cleric (level 60, 40+ aa points and epic), but standing, healing, sitting back down and blasting is not really what I call a fun time (if I am above 60% mana, I blast). Trying to solo as it is is an exercise in patience. I burn an entire mana bar on 2-3 mobs. No thank you. Soloing is what I do with my druid (level 60, 61 aa points and epic).  I group with my bard husband (60, 110 aa points and epic) a lot and admittedly the only time I ever bring out my cleric at this point is to group in CT. Any other camp we can hold duo pretty much with my druid and him.<br />
<br />
After the change, I am hesitant to say. I know for a fact I am going to have a LOT more fun with my cleric. With my druid, I am somewhat apprehensive about this 75% heal. We do not even know the specifics of how it heals (75% total hp? 75% of hurt HP? up to 75% only?).  Even with the most optomistic of estimations (75% of total hp), I would never think a cleric could be replaced by a druid where a cleric is currently required in the first place.<br />
<br />
Druids are not your enemy. In my opinion, the people who bot clerics and run around PLing themselves are the source of the reason why clerics cannot get groups. Most people have a hang up: &quot;we must have a cleric to do X&quot;. Take advantage of that. After the changes, I could easily see clerics being even more wanted in groups with the attractive alternative of soloing more effectively (notice this doesn't say &quot;uber soloer&quot; it says &quot;more effectively&quot; meaning, moreso than now).<br />
<br />
If you do not have x clerics currently you cannot raid y mob. This is a boon to all players who have problems getting clerics to raid, as well as increasing the perception that druids have better raid capabilities (personally I think the perception that druids suck on raids is far from the truth, but it is perception that matters in this game, not reality).<br />
<br />
I realize many people are scared of the druid &quot;CH&quot; but if you do not do pick up groups often, this will not effect you.<br />
<br />
Basically my point is, this will make my cleric more fun for me. This will increase the perception that druids do not suck on raids. Druids can also realistically fill in for clerics (somewhat) if the need arises, although they are a poor substitute.<br />
<br />
Relax, play the game and have fun.<br />
<br />
EDIT: I agree with Adon. I think the Yaulp V spell should add a proc similar to the summoned weapon, instead of being forced to use the summoned weapon in primary. Just my 2 cp.<br />
<br />
EDIT 2: I also think that if we outdamage any melee (with similar equipment) with this combo, then these spells need to be nerfed. Clerics are not a melee class, though this combo will give us a little bit of excitement in an otherwise boring grind.</div></div><hr />

I trust they will add more things.  Pardon me for liking the changes.  I mean, god forbid that I get to do something more exciting than heal.  God forbid that, when I'm soloing because I can't find a group, I can be a little better at it.  The level of whining that has gone on over the last 2 days is nuts.  This board used to be fairly calm and reasonable.  That seems to have flown right out the window.  <br />

However, to the contrary, don't you feel its time we get up and comment on the changes before they finished?<br />
<br />
Its quite obvious that VI/Rich Water still not firm (or don't know) on how to tune cleric as a class. We need to express our feelings/opinion before they annouce it completed/dish out the 2nd wave of changes.<br />
<br />
For the hammer, I just consider a &quot;fun&quot; toy rather than putting us any where among the classed in xp'ing/grouping.<br />
<br />
In my opinion, neither turning us into a melee-healer class is a good idea. We can play an alternate if we want to melee, don't we?<br />

<br />
Giving clerics the option to melee, is a good thing. I would like to see it as a series of spells, maybe starting at 20th level, when we begin sitting on our butts all the time, and growing in power as we level. This would give us another option, just like many other classes have the option to solo if they want/need to. <br />
<br />
I don't think a summoned hammer is the way to go with this 'proc-fighting' method though. As a lot of people have said, they have worked very hard for the weapons/items they're wielding now, just to have to bag them. You might as well take CLR off the usable by list, since to do this, we have to use this summoned hammer. Perhaps a proc-buff instead, so that people can continue to use what they already have. A cleric swinging away with their epic would be one heck of a sight.<br />
<br />
On a broader scale, even if we're given the ability to do this, will we really? The first time a cleric is up there fighting some mob, and a tank dies from not getting a heal (either the cleric wasn't watching, or ran out of mana from not medding), what do you think the group is going to do?  <br />
<br />
Is the Yaulp-regen supposed to be good enough to replace sitting? If it is, does it 'stack' with sitting, because then all you're doing is saying not only do we have to sit, we now to pop up to yaulp every half a minute. Nice jack in the box impression.<br />
<br />
Are the shaman/druid heals going to be good enough that they can cover healing while we get up and melee? I'd like to hear their view on being told to sit and med for heals because the group needs the cleric to melee. Talk about altering class purpose. Put away your nukes and dots, Mr. Druid, and mem those heals.<br />
<br />
Like many others, I didn't really sign up to be a melee person. It'd be nice to have the ability to put out some damage, but it's not really what I'm here for. Give me some other spells to be casting besides heals. It'd be an interesting trade off between the priest classes. Say I heal while the shaman slows or the cleric DSs and dots. Then the shaman or druid picks up the healing while I lay down a stackable slow, or haste, or DS, or something, that works _with_ the other classes spells. If they can step up closer to our level of healing, what harm in us stepping closer to other classes abilities.<br />
<br />
Grouping should not be about replace-ability, it should be about synergy. Spells from multiple classes that work even better together.<br />

<br />
Don't forget some table scraps for the paladins....<br />
We should get subset spells and skills at a lower ability to what warriors/clerics receive.  Paladins should also be considered secondary healers.<br />
<br />
If anything these changes just give clerics more options.<br />
Clerics will not be replaced in the CH rotation.  <br />
I've seen the trend of raid clerics doing melee to spice things up.<br />
<br />
With a cleric you know your healing is 100%.  With a secondary healer you might get by, but its a lot less efficient.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Grumbles</div><div class="date">08-23-2002, 10:00 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Brazzo, clerics already solo in those spots on occasion.  Undead mobs generally dont run, the spawns are static and spread out enough that adds can be avoided.  If you think this is the rule rather than the exception try to figure out the zones where you can pull singles without invis, sow, Lev, harmony, snare or any of the other spells that make other classes so adept at doing this job.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Geneze</div><div class="date">08-23-2002, 10:07 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Fact: Clerics get groups now BECAUSE we are the only viable healers for many locations. When someone looks for a cleric for their group, it's not because we can rez, stun, nuke, MoK, MoR, resistance buff, DoT undead, or root. Aegolism might a a tiny bit to do witk it, but I doubt most people even consider that, either. They loook for a cleric because we are the only ones that can handle the healing where they want to go. <br />
<br />
Actually, even that's not quite right. Shaman can already heal adequately in many places, but there aren't a whole heck of a lot of them out there taking our group spots. <br />
<br />
Druids on the other hand, are more numerous than the stars. Once they have the ability to heal a group adequately in any XP zone, there is no longer any reason to look for a cleric for your group. <br />
<br />
Once you have adequate healing, it DOESN'T MATTER if someoen else can heal a little better. Good enough is just that- good enough. We will become just like warriors. Sure, they can tank a little better than paladins and SKs, but does anyone go looking for a warrior to tank? On the contrary, they go looking for a knight instead, because they offer more to the grop than just tanking. The same will apply to us. Groups will look for shaman and druids before a cleric, because they offer more than than just healing, and there healing will be good enough, just liek a knight's tanking is good enough. <br />
<br />
So, what are you giving us so that we can offer more than just healing? Crap melee? Ok, I get a 25% self haste, and a 14/18 weapon. That's just wonderful..but my 1 HB skill is still only 175. My offense is only 200. I cannot double attack, I cannot bash (though you mentioned this was a possiblity). I cannot riposte. I get 25% haste and a fast weapon...now I can miss 3 times as fast! Yippee! Have you ever seen a cleric's log from melee? We miss more than 75% of the time! <br />
<br />
We are not STUPID. Most of us have played melee characters. Many to high levels. We know that melee damage comes from the fact that they have high weapons skills, and such things as dual-weild, double attack, and riposte. We are smart enough ot realize that a good weapon and a small amount of haste alone will not come anywhere NEAR real melee damage. If you want to make us battle clerics, you are going to have to do it right. We will have to have DPS similar to at LEAST a bard to make that happen. Otherwise, I am STILL more useful sitting on my butt medding. And how useful is that? Not very, considering I bring only heals to the group, whouch could easily be handled by a druid who can also do a lot more. <br />
<br />
I'm sorry, but it's just not enough.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Segismundo</div><div class="date">08-23-2002, 10:12 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Increasing cleric weapon caps / damage table, giving double attack etc is NOT an option. There are some sick weapons out there dmg/dly wise for clerics, and changing straight melee stats would mean looking back at each cleric usable bonker and tweak it (which is probably way too much work) AND also would mean the DPS increase wouldnt be fair... clerics on not raid level guilds would barely benefit from this as their choice of weapons is limited, on top of that it would also mean that we get balanced through gear which is unfair if you think how druids and shamans will probably get their spells out of a vendor. <br />
<br />
The reason they are using a summoned hammer instead of a proc adding spell could be that they cant actually modulate the proc rate using the spell, only by weapon stats. <br />
<br />
Looking at it from this perspective makes their decision on how improve cleric dps quite reasonable. If this would make groups choose a cleric over the wide range of abilities which druids and shamans have at their disposal is an entirely different discussion that should be kept on hold until the 'utility' spells they are planning show up.<br />
<br />
Another entirely different discussion is if this dmg increase should be mana based (nukes/dots) or not. I honestly much prefer melee because there is no associated downtime with melee (other than the mana used for healing yourself on a solo context). On a group situation bringing DPS without using mana is very useful specially if you gain almost half of meditation mana while meleeing (thx yaulp5). More casterish clerics might prefer clickies tho (ala jbb) but thats a matter of preferences.<br />
<br />
That being said I am of the opinion yaulp5 should have added a DS component, that way it would increase soloing ability without unbalancing group situations (unless the cleric is actually tanking which is an interesting option). Speaking of tanking dont forget that shields will allow to block blows and increase mitigation (supposedly) so once this goes live tanking while soloing might not be as bad as it is now.<br />
<br />
Given that:<br />
<br />
a) Verant is aware of our concerns<br />
b) We dont have solid data on hammer dps (and if someone does, share!)<br />
c) We dont have solid data on tanking improvements thru shields<br />
d) We still dont know anything about our utility spells<br />
<br />
I conclude we should wait to judge these changes until we know everything. However, the idea of my group play becoming something like moderate melee dmg, healing, tossing away utility spells all that with ok standing meditation is appealing. <br />
<br />
Finally, about bagging other raid attained hammers that indeed is a drawback albeit several of these have utility beyond wielding (clickies on epic/sun, for example). Anyways future raid content might be itemized with hammer upgrades so raid clerics not necessarily will be locked with the summoned hammer.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Shadowfrost</div><div class="date">08-23-2002, 10:13 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hmm.  Hmm.<br />
<br />
To the guys who're concerned about invalidating existing equipment for a summoned hammer:-  this happened with mage focus items.  Then Verant took other steps to sort it out.<br />
<br />
You will change and upgrade your equipment as time goes on anyway.  This isn't that terrible.<br />
<br />
The Va'Dyn drops a 40/38 1hb which is CLR DRU SHM (for example).  He isn't a difficult kill... how would this compare with the summoned hammer ?  And I can imagine nice procs being put on some other cleric 1hb's (Dawnfire's been named several times) as well.<br />
<br />
Priest class balancing is a good idea.  What we should realistically expect is that at the end of the balancing process, the classes will actually be balanced.  Druids get viable main-tank heals... clerics get another role to compensate.  I can live with that.<br />
<br />
Clerics will be more fun to play now.  I didn't make a cleric because I wanted to melee, but I can adapt to this and deal with it.  I do expect some challenges with the implementation.<br />
<br />
Fix list<br />
<br />
* Increase clerical combat skills to bring them in line with shamans.<br />
* Parry.  Gonna need this, unless we get slow.<br />
* Snare would be good... I'm a DE so I have a clickie snare necklace anyway, but other clerics will end up stunning as a kind of ghetto snare.<br />
<br />
Concern<br />
<br />
The paladin community is going to have a collective apoplexy, and I don't blame them.<br />
<br />
Will you upgrade paladins to take account of the changes to clerics ?  If so, what will you do for shadowknights to maintain balance between the knight classes ?<br />
<br />
Once you've done this, what will you do for the warriors who're raising a major stink about knights encroaching on their territory ?<br />
<br />
Once warriors get their upgrade, will you do the same for rogues, monks, rangers, beastlords, and bards ?<br />
<br />
And will you upgrade the nuking classes to keep them inline with the melee damage dealers ?<br />
<br />
This could get way out of hand.<br />
<br />
Wish<br />
<br />
If we aren't going to get invis (still), how about un-nerfing Wake of Tranquillity ?<br />
<br />
As originally implemented, this spell was an indoor version of Harmony.  It was nerfed.<br />
<br />
Fixing it would make moving around a lot easier for the new breed of melee clerics, and also give clerics another non-healing option to increase competitiveness against druids and shamans.<br />
<br />
Overall<br />
<br />
When I originally saw this I went nuts.  I levelled a shaman to 17 last night because I was positive I would quit my cleric.<br />
<br />
Now... I'm not so sure I'll retire.  I'll solo a small mushroom or two and check this out before making the decision.</div></div><hr />

<br />
1) clerics owe verant an apology.<br />
all over the wish list was the ability to melee, they got what they asked for. complaining about it is flat out stupid. <br />
<br />
2) solo xp gain rate<br />
I can currently make aa xp at about a blue an hour in maiden's eye using aego, blessed armor of the risen, epitaph of life, and root. preferred targets are bats, skeletons are a bit rough, vampires are damn near impossible.<br />
<br />
the solo capacity really needs to improve that about 150%-300% to make it viable, to about 1/2 a bub to a full bub an hour. i dont think its quite what druids and shams are capable of, but that's a reasonable tradeoff against healing capacity.<br />
<br />
3) druid heal value<br />
3K might be enough to cover a slot in a c heal rotation. for this to really be used by most raid leaders, it might need to be bumped to 4-5 K.<br />
<br />
4) sub 56 clerics<br />
I think these are the folks that are hurting the most on groups, they need something to help them honestly.</div></div><hr />

The game is beyond their control.<br />
<br />
As it stands, IMHO, they could give the priest classes, except the shaman, these new healing abiliteis and do nothing else and we'd be fine.  I have a 60 cleric.  The demand for a cleric is insanely high.  I say insanely high because it is insanely high.<br />
<br />
Little if any changes need to be made to clerics.<br />
<br />
I like the new group cele elixir.<br />
<br />
But, giving the clerics more melee ability is stupid and will only suceed in having me, when I play my melee classes, look for a replacement group or cleric when I see one standing up and attempting to tank.<br />
<br />
These guys are all skewed in their priorities.  Clerics and warriors have incredible roles and rewards in the game.  Nothing will remove that. They do this at the EXPENSE of the other classes, not just the priest classes.<br />
<br />
There aer large numbers of bugs that really annoy people.  For instance, the wall bug for rangers and the lack of high level ranger weapons and gear and the relative 0 change in effectiveness between 1 bow and another.  The stacking of the ranger wp vs. brells or even a silly little DS from the druid and magi line demand to be fixed.<br />
<br />
The beastlord has no class aaxp skills.  Their weapons and armor choices are near non-existent.  Their hybrid spell casting penalties, their lack of damage upgrade (that occurred when the magi and necro received theirs) for their pets, their relative inability to do any sort of melee damage and the TOTAL and UTTER duplication of spell lines given to them (including the most recent ones that duplicate the ranger class buffs) just shows you that they care more for soem classes then others.<br />
<br />
All the while they focus on changes to problems that are viewed to be relatively new while these other classes have been asking for their fixes for 2 to nearly 3 years.<br />
<br />
As I said, I play a 60 cleric.  I zone into a zone and am immediately deludged with tells for groups, heals, buffs, resses.  This is silly.  I'm sure the druid is deluged with ports but ports just detract from what the person entered the zone to accomplish to begin with.  You can't improve your class when you are porting.  There's no exp gain for ports.<br />
<br />
The druid class needed some changes.  This is so obvious.  But to pit the druid against other classes is outrageous and it will harm the game exp portion of the game.  Giving clerics melee ability will harm portions of the game.  There is NO such thing as a battle cleric as there is no such thing as a battle wizard.  There needs to be no changes to the game that promote this.<br />
<br />
I read dispassionately the post by Rich Waters.  My only conclusion was that &quot;these guys are lost&quot;.  They have no idea of what one change will do and what it won't.  All the while they are  thorwing out changes to two classes they neglect the other classes that have been asking for fixes for much longer.<br />
<br />

Fix the ranger wp stacking.<br />
Fix the ranger lack of weapons and armor at the high end.<br />

Funny how this list could just go on and on yet they spend so much time to try to offset the change to druids by increasing the solo ability of the cleric when the cleric needs no changes even if you give the druid the improved healing.<br />
<br />
You guys can't even figure out your priorities.  You let bugs exist for 2-3 years all the while having the affected classes complain and ask for fixes.  Even so, when they have been complaining for 2-3 years in the end you say it &quot;will change the flavor of the game&quot; or &quot;the bug is too hard to fix&quot;.  Back when they complained, if you had fixed them they wouldn't be &quot;too hard&quot; or &quot;change the flavor&quot;.  Some of the excuses are crazy while they go on to improve even more a class (the cleric) that is far and away above all other classes that are mandatory on raids.<br />
<br />
We are lucky to have 1 necro on a raid.  We are lucky to have 1 druid on a raid.  We are lucky to have 1 or 2 paladins on a raid.  We absolutely have 0 beastlrods in our guild or on any raid.  If you aren't a 60 wizard you aren't valued on a raid.<br />
<br />
All the while we can do with 1 or 2 warriros, 10-15 clerics, 10 rogues, and a couple buff classes ad we are set on any raid.  We need only build a raid of cles, warriors, rogues, shaman, ench, and we are going to do the majority of our damage.  All the while you let some classes just blatantly overwrite the buffs of others damaging their ability to perform.  You let wall bugs and light of sight get in the way of the ability of a class to do their major damage from a skill that took them over 100 levels to attain.<br />
<br />
I'd say you guys are lost and you need to get your priorities straight Verant.<br />

Tell you what: You bind close by Charasis, die inside, and then recover your corpse. Then come back and tell me how you did it. <br />
<br />
The fact that I can solo in Charasis, as Ritch says we can with the new stuff, is useless to me unless I can both get there solo, and do a CR solo. If I cannot, then I will not attempt to solo there, and neither will any other cleric. <br />
<br />
If those are examples, what are some others? I'm sure Velks, but I won't be soloing in Velks. Will I be able to solo in Sebilis? The Hole (where stuff is blue, not green or light blue)? Fungus Grove? The Deep? Akheva? Acrylia? I'm not saying I won't be able to, I'm asking. All those,  at least  the entrances, I can CR naked, as I can Chardok, because I can bind right outside of them, or in them. Charasis I can't, because I can't get to it naked. If I go back to a town for invis potions, the see invis mobs will have respawned,  so I'm screwed there, too.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You guys complained about solo ability and about the boredom of just healing all the time.  It seems to me that these changes address both of those issues.  If you want to be a godlike soloer, go play a druid or a necro or a mage.  But you'd better get used to being unwanted for raiding and xp groups.<br />
<br />
Making high end loot obsolete by replacing it with a summoned item is a valid issue.  But otherwise I see nothing but good for clerics in these changes.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Legynd</div><div class="date">08-23-2002, 11:13 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I think the changes are very interesting.<br />
<br />
I don't think the other cleric 1hbs are invalidated by this one.  You would use it while xp'ing, but you'd still use the high-stat 1hb (such as blackstar, etc.) when raiding.<br />
<br />
My biggest worry is for younger clerics.  You don't make a new spell line and start it at 56.  Yaulp 1-4 should be upgraded to have scaling haste components and dex increases.  There should be summoned hammers at lower levels with lower ratios and smaller DDs.  This way, there is a whole line of hammer/yaulps from younger clerics to older ones... Otherwise you will have the same problem wizards currently have (a huge power gap between 59 and 60 because so many spells they don't get until 60).<br />
<br />
In addition, I would like to see the undead line of spells made more effective than our regular lines.  Epitaph of life should be a dot on the order of Winged Death so that we can root/dot solo.  Our undead nukes should have reasonably better ratios than our reckoning/judgment line.<br />
<br />
Finally, MoK is useless.  I do not cast this spell ever, in xp groups or raids.  It simply takes too much time (I cast it off bp) and is resisted too frequently.  MoR is not that great, either, but it's better than nothing, and it does at least work with the hammer/yaulp/attack idea.  Again, if MoR is a spell line, why are there not lower levels of it so that low level clerics can use this spell?  <br />
<br />
I think the changes are reasonable, but they need to be added at low levels too, so that the play style doesn't just radically change once you get MoR, YaulpV, and this hammer.<br />
<br />
As to everyone who says &quot;I could solo  Charasis and Chardok zonein already&quot;, well, yes, so could I.  But how much mana did you use while doing it?  That's what I thought.  You sat for 8-10 minutes probably recovering it all.  These changes will allow us to solo with ZERO down time (might have to remed 1 CH worth).  <br />
<br />
To the people saying &quot;we need offense/defense&quot;, most of the damage from this new weapon is being done by the proc.  This is a unique mechanic that no other class will have!  You do not need more offense; the damage output from the actual melee of this weapon will always be lower compared to the high-proccing 100something dd.<br />
<br />
As to the people saying &quot;we can't melee; we get beat on!!!&quot;  Hello, what are heals for?  Root the mob, back off, cast a heal.  I for one like the idea that our soloing will require healing in order to succeed.   I am guessing we can solo some decent mobs by being brave, letting ourselves get knocked to a bub, rooting the mob, backing off, CH'ing, and then wading back in.  <br />
<br />
I do not think we need invis.  If you can't make it to Chardok naked, I don't understand why you're playing a cleric.  I've run through Umbral to VT before without invis.  It is not something necessary at all; people just imagine that it is because they're afraid to get hit a little bit.  With run3, you can go anywhere.<br />
<br />
I actually think a manaless dps is very interesting and the right direction for the cleric class.  (Improving our nukes would only impinge on the territory of wizards.  Improving our dots impinges on the territory of druids/shamans.  Improving our melee, but doing so only by procs, is a cool, innovative idea imo).  <br />
<br />
So to summarize, make our undead dots/nukes better (totally broken lines currently), improve yaulps I-IV, make summoned hammers at mid and low levels, and make Mark of Karn into a useful spell.<br />

Theses are bad changes.  They eliminate the usefullness of clerics in an xp group...not the NEED as there isn't one, but the ability of our class to be useful in that group.  The additions are not sufficient for us to solo efficiently.  If we are to be a solo class we should be just as good at it as any druid or wizard quading.  If we are to be a group class we should be just as useful as any enchanter or rogue is now.  I suppose it's too much to ask for the druid/shaman role of being a great solo/group/raid class but I damn well expect to be exellent at two out of three of those.<br />

If this BS goes live and has a significant impact on my ability to get a group, I may start twinking that soloer.<br />
<br />
I made a Cleric because they're a grouping class, I like grouping, and I don't want to be &quot;a bad paladin&quot; as someone qutie aptly put it.  If I again wanted to melee and scrounge for groups why attempting to solo, I would bring my Ranger out of retirement.<br />
<br />
You can all discuss the pros and cons of the proposed melee additions all you want, but in my opinion they are inconsequential.  They are not what Clerics are about, and I will not use them for several of the reasons already mentioned - you already made Paladins into an excellent battle-cleric so it's a little late and silly to make us the same.<br />
<br />
The additions to our spell line will do extremely little, and as mentioned they don't affect anyone until level 58.  I'm 54, so how does any of this do anything other than hurt my chances at getting a group?<br />
<br />
The root of all this is the heal spell additions to Shamen and Druids to give them &quot;raid-quality&quot; heals.  Once again, VI panders to the minority population of EQ doing endgame encounters instead of looking at its entire player base.  If people need an unproportionally high number of Clerics to do those encounters, you're right that something is wrong.  But you're fixing it from the wrong direction.  Don't give near-CH to two classes that already have more than enough usefulness and power, both in and out of groups, but instead maybe fix your damn endgame so you DON'T NEED that inproportional number of Clerics!<br />
<br />
Proposed changes to make Clerics somewhat solo friendly:<br />
<br />
1. Give us a self-invis spell for the love of all that is not a Druid!  The old logic that &quot;we pat your back if you pat ours&quot; doesn't hold much water anymore since Invis. to Undead hasn't had a whole lot of usefulness since, oh, I don't know...Lower Guk?  Wizards get ITU but Clerics can't get Invis?  Give me a break...<br />
<br />
2. Higher defense/dodge caps.  We have pretty decent AC but we still get a beatdown in a hurry at any level.<br />
<br />
3. A regular (non-undead) DOT and a more mana-efficient nuke so we might take out more than one mob before being oom.<br />
<br />
I think that's about the end of my rant - all these changes really make me sick to my stomach, and just go to show that with VI's balancing it's always &quot;2 steps forward, 1 step back&quot; - and that's being generous.<br />

<br />
Yes, paladins will be slighted by this.<br />
<br />
No warrior is replaced at the raid level by a paladin.  The defensive discipline is just to powerful.  High level warriros can do better melee damage then a ranger at the high end.<br />
<br />
A 175 1hb and 200 offense is pretty high for a pure caster class.<br />
<br />
You get 1 swing less then a paladin but the chance of a double attack off 1hb/1hs isn't 50%.  A paladin has maybe a 30% of a chance to hit a second time on that double attack.  That'll put you in a position of doing more damage then a paladin with that prioc.<br />
<br />
Verant doesn't care about paladins so they probably have no intention of increasing paladin power which, if they did, would trigger their relative gain in melee power over the dual wielders thus causing them to ask for more.<br />
<br />
Double atatck off a single hand does more damage then dual wield without double attack.<br />
<br />
If you feel you need to bag your weapons to melee with the new hammer, bag the new hammer when you switch roles.  Most melee classes have multiple sets of gear and lots of weapons that they have to switch in and out.<br />
<br />
Rezzing is a pretty powerful ability that is a serious determining factor for choosing a cleric over a druid.  Shaman are loved no matter what once they have their 70% slow spell.<br />
<br />
If you think your role as a healer is boring imagine trying to be a wizard.  They do little more then stand and blast and sit.  They target one mob.  You target multiple players, can group heal, can blast, cure, melee, have invul (x 2) can cheal yourslef over and over have awesome buffs.  So, complaining about the class being boring is somewhat disingenuous.<br />
<br />
I see clerics here with significantly more AC then a ranger has (self bnuffed).  High end rangers have maybe a 1100 AC self buffed and they are the real high end rangers.  Buffed with Aego, and thorncoat and coe they maybe approach 1250ac but have a ton of stacking issues.  I see clerics here with significantly more HP then a ranger has (self buffed). Rangers, at the very high end maybe have 3k hp.  Most typically can self buff to 2700hp.  This includes their Skin like nature and strenght of nature.  With Aego, FOS, str of nature, they maybe get close to 4500 hp.  With beter damage mitigation from the improved shields, the ability to root and then cheal ones self and the ability to buff yourself beyond a class that is 75% warrior I can't see you guys having much room to complain.  Even with all this they can't heal for squat, they have basically warrior level melee output and archery with a whole slew of probelms with walls, line of sight, buffs that are overwritten by vastly inferior spells (brells, damage shields).  Even the bard epic keeps the spelle from beign successfully being refreshed.  This is just sad to see clerics so spiteful of changes such as this when there are so many other classes out there that haven't even remotely the same power or desirability as they have.<br />
<br />
Take a solo situation.  Locate mob, buff, cast pet, pull mob, root.  Go in and melee with new hammer.  Procs occur on misses.  The delay is very very very very low so that means alot of swings and alot of procs.  When we hit we hit hard, procs hit, pet hits.  When we get in trouble we root, back off, pet dies, cheal, recast pet, re-root, and re-enter, if ti is even needed.  If we die, we go back, get our body and rez for 96%.   Cast our self clarity spell (blessed armor of the risen, rebuff, and go again).  That cheal alone is vastly more then any other class that can solo.<br />
<br />
I am a 60 cleric and I can't see much of what is being complained about.  i can see level 54-57 clerics being upset though.  I can now see that some melee classes, who also get stomped into the ground and fast, have signficantly less hp and ac then a class that was never desinged to be a melee class.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">DarqangelKB</div><div class="date">08-23-2002, 11:26 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well i dont know. I played a Shaman to 60 and he could do just about anything. Solo, grp, quest, travel safely, make somewhat usefull potions, real jack of all trades. Of course, slow/torpor, massive dot's, buffs, haste, clicky things which are mana free, yep he could do it all. He had his role on raids be it buffing/slowing/de-buffing, spot heals, looking after the casters.<br />
<br />
I played my friends Druid and found him much like the Shaman but one heck of a traveller and money making machine (ports for donations/quading), usefull buffs, dmg shield, de-buffs, nukes, dot's. Had his raid role, PoTG, circles, spot heals, looking after casters.<br />
<br />
Now i play my Cleric. She has been group dependant since an early age. She has struggled to keep up with her running costs, armour, components, travelling expenses (ports/potions) Of course now she is 56 she get's a lot of requests for 96% res. Sometimes the donation is 1-500pp, sometimes a peridot. <br />
<br />
She has had little chance to solo mobs, this was fine, i did not want to solo, i wanted to group. <br />
<br />
Her melee is laughable this is fine she always had another to dish out the blows for her. <br />
<br />
Her damage mitigation is a laugh, she gets hit for max a lot of the time, this is fine also, there was always someone better suited to take this damage. <br />
<br />
Her DD was a luxury but again laughable due to the resists/mana costs. Again this is fine, there was always a finger waggler who could do that much better or at a better ratio, she doesn't mind, that's their job.<br />
<br />
She could let the tank go down to almost 2% hp and heal him straight back up to full. She could cast that quick heal on the finger-waggler and keep them up until the tank could gain agro or the mob was messed. In the worst case scenario, she could raise her fallen comrades or those who had fallen in battle elsewhere. all these are fine, this is what she was made for, this was her defining ability, her CLASS ability.<br />
<br />
Im sorry VI, i don't want to cannadance (Yalup) again. I dont want to summon a hammer which will only allow me better dmg/ratio due to the fact i have to cannadance or rely entirely on the proc which is suspect at the least.  I don't want to solo now from 56 - 60 because Shaman or Druids can keep most adept groups alive in the majority of zones. I don't want the others in the group to laugh at my misses as this is the only way i can increase the dps of the group effectivly. I don't have nor will i pay the extortianate prices for supposedly usefull spells like MoR or MoK. I do not want to be a pet class.<br />
<br />
I do want my fellow gamers to be able to group and lvl effectivly wothout having to wait for a Cleric, however i don't want my group to also be sat waiting for a CC of some sort, thanks to your changes to casting NPC's. I do see many groups able to exp/quest without a Cleric. <br />
<br />
Please note, once a Shaman slows a melee based mob, the dmg output of that mob is greatly reduced and thus the healing needed is again greatly reduced, something any capable Shaman can do effectivly, whilst still putting out good DPS thank's to Epic (Not the hardest to get im sure many will agree) and JBB (rare but not that rare) semi-efficient pet and DoT's.<br />
<br />
Without a slower in the group a Druid may struggle to keep up with the healing required for the group if more than 2 mobs come and no cc, however their dmg shield/dot's/nukes will increase the dmg output of the grp greatly. However as in most zones, mobs can be single pulled for the majority of cases if you have someone 58+. <br />
<br />
I am now being told that my group desirablity will be increased due to the fact i can summon a hammer for melee (please put away any other weapons you may have gained over the course of playing your class) i can send in a low mana cost pet to act as a dot and i can Yalup to regain mana whilst swinging which may improve my proc damage/chance. These new ability's will also make be become more effecient whilst soloing, something i dont want to do thanks (unless i am farming for tradeskill components)<br />
<br />
If i want to solo/nuke i will log on my Druid alt becasue they can travel, nuke, dot and ARE great soloers. If i want to melee i will log on my Warrior alt, becasue they can tank and deal out dmg.<br />
<br />
I want something which will improve my group desirability/capability, be it improving the DPS of the group via a dmg shield/haste buff or the ability to possibly have a single target mez spell with a lvl restriction on it, maybe lvl 50 or below.<br />
<br />
Im sorry i don't want to melee, i don't want to canna-dance, i dont want to be a pet class or mini mage, i don't want to solo i dont want to be a rez-buff-bot. I don't mind if you give these heals to the other priest classes i just ask that you give me something i do want or something my group would want.<br />

Actually, I don't think we need to be able to quad solo.  I would be quite happy with the following 2 flexible soloing options:<br />
<br />
  1.  Root/dot undead with a decent dot (on the order of winged death).<br />
  2.  Hammer/yaulp/mor/pet/wade in.<br />
<br />
Druids also have 2 forms of soloing essentially (root/dot and quadding).  Shamans really just do the same thing pretty much.<br />
<br />
We already have ok roots (not super, but ok).  Just increase Epitaph's damage to be good and more like a real DoT instead of below the ratio of our nuke.<br />
<br />
We are still the better (even if no longer the only) group choice for a healer and the best CH'ers for raids.  We should still have to sacrifice a bit for that.  It may be that we will be seeing lots more HARD zones in PoP where the better healing of a cleric will actually *gasp* be needed/desired.<br />
<br />
If we can rot/dot undead, do decent nuking damage every now and then, melee/proc/yaulp solo, and have improved heals, this seems to me to be a faily well rounded solution to clerics' current problems.<br />

  so say 20% block modifyer gives you 51 skill in block<br />
<br />
  BLock is like 2 times as effective as parry, and a 51 skill in block is equivalent to say 75-100 parry<br />
<br />
  Relax and wait for all the changes on test to play out<br />

  Personally with all the new cleric changes , assuming they add lowver leveles of this Yaulp 5 and the new hammer I would roll a cleric right now if they implement this.<br />
<br />
 jeez the hammer is a 24/14 weapon vs undead There is NO 1 hand weapon better than ratio.  Vs normal mobs it is freaking godly on its own.  <br />

Did you know that procs activate on misses as well? so the faster swing rate is a bigger deal than your weapon skill even.<br />

I agree with the many posts about the need to upgrade melee.  If our balancing is to be an upgrade to melee skills, please give us the same DPS as druids have.  My wife plays a druid and with epic and ES arms can do mana free approx 2k damage in 30 seconds.  I want to do 2k damage with this mace in 30 secs so I am doing equivalent mana free damage.<br />
<br />
I will need the corresponding defense skill rises to go with it.<br />
<br />
I like the idea of making us melee.  I understand that many of my brothers and sisters may not.  for me, I think it might be a fun and different way of playing my cleric.<br />
<br />
But, if you balance druids by giving them CH, please give us equivalent mana free DPS.  Druid epic and ES arms are very, very easy to get for most 55+ druids.  Now they have CH as well.  They have become very powerful in groups, and I want to have the same mana free DPS as they get from those two items alone.<br />
<br />
We will need appropriate defensive and offensive increases in skill rises.  All of my melee skills have been maxed out since level 39.  Please give me an appropriate skill rise so I don't melee like a level 35 pally who never trained in double attack.<br />
<br />
You made shamans the gods of duoing by giving them CH along with their many other fine abilities.  <br />
<br />
You gave druids, an incredibly powerful offensive class, an incredible defensive skill to go along with that in partial CH.<br />
<br />
Are you prepared to give clerics 4k Damage per Minute to even them up with druids?  Mana free, remember?<br />

&gt;1) clerics owe verant an apology.<br />
all over the wish list was the ability to melee, they got what they asked for. complaining about it is flat out stupid.<br />
<br />
What - not complain over the fact they still do not understand that a cleric cannot survive toe to toe melee with a low blue, nor even a high green, AT LEVEL 35, LET ALONE 55! Newsflash - it doesn't matter what proc you put on a weapon, or what haste / mana regen you add to yaulp - you will still get crushed with a huge lack of defensive skills. <br />
<br />
To those people saying that the 'new bad boy' hammer owns - try soloing a blue with it that a shaman or druid your level is fighting -no undead, no group, no main tank to take aggro so you can hit the mob from behind and exclaim omg! this hammer rulez! Thats what you are getting in return for losing your unique ability to CH.<br />
<br />
VI: I chose a cleric. A CLERIC. Not a paladin. Why should anyone choose a cleric now or continue with one if you are changing their role out from under their feet in the mid 50's?  If you are going to do that kind of change then roll it back down through the levels - make a shaman / ench style pet starting at level 35, revamp the entire yaulp line with mana regen / haste / proc buffs, raise def / off skills, increase dodge, add in a main hand damage bonus, add in block, and a 25 % chance to double attack, or don't do it at all. Oh wait - thats pretty much a paladin isn't it?<br />
<br />
Don't leave all the pre 50 clerics infuriated with what you've done to them, to their future levels.  They've invested alot of time and effort to get there, only to have you say guess what? We're completely changing your role, so sorry we didnt warn you at level 1.<br />
<br />
And again - you are releasing the info peicemeal - all this does is cause trouble, it only serves to make people anxious and angry.</div></div><hr />

<br />
i'm not here to flame, just bring some insight to certain views that you expressed, I can see the merit of them, just want to bring a lower level cleric aspect to it.<br />
<br />
&quot;Some of the excuses are crazy while they go on to improve even more a class (the cleric) that is far and away above all other classes that are mandatory on raids.&quot;<br />
<br />
Yes, raids. But what about experience groups? Shamans can replace clerics in certain zones, why after this would a group choose to take a cleric before level 58 into an xp group when the druid (and shaman) offer so much more and you can get most buffs and services from the cleric(s) at zone with a donation or from friends / guildees.<br />
<br />
&quot;they spend so much time to try to offset the change to druids by increasing the solo ability of the cleric when the cleric needs no changes even if you give the druid the improved healing.&quot; <br />
<br />
Problem again is with grouping, if a druid is lfg for hours they can go off and solo or quad, it may be boring but they can do it without burning their mana bar on 1 or 2 mobs, but as a cleric we're dependant on groups unless we have undead mobs and added weapon procs for undead.<br />
<br />
&quot;I play a 60 cleric. I zone into a zone and am immediately deludged with tells for groups, heals, buffs, resses.&quot;<br />
<br />
Exactly, you're level 60, a druid form of CH probably won't mean much where you're hunting at 60 ( CT for example ) and buffs? sure, people love aego.<br />
<br />
I'm not sure what server you are on, but me as a 56 cleric I never get deluged with tells when i am unanon.<br />
<br />
But people are worried about the levels 50 - 58 since it's already hard to get groups with bots around or other alternative group setups in certain zones, so now there will be more competition for the remaining spots and us as clerics, simply don't have that much over a druid/shaman to offer.<br />
<br />
Do I believe druids need raid desireablity? Yes<br />
Did they get it? Yes<br />
<br />
But they may get it at a price of lowering the desireablity of a cleric.<br />
<br />
I can only hope to see this through to the end and look at what Verant is planned to give us, so that groups have an incentive to invite us.<br />
<br />
I for one don't want to feel like an xp leech</div></div><hr />

<br />
4) Still looking for : self invis ; undead snare ; undead slow. <br />
<br />
The invis would, of course, be quite helpful.  But I must ask why you (and others) feel the need to limit the need for snare to undead, beyond you feel that it fits to the concept of the Cleric.<br />
<br />
But if this is your only reason, then it seems that the Druid Snare should only affect animals and cacti, the natural aspects of Norrath.<br />
<br />
I would love to see a snare implemented that worked on all mobs.  Perhaps it should be more in line w/ the necro snare so that it does not encroach too much onto druid turf, but I see no reason to limit the snare to undead.  Perhaps another option is to have a spell that is a lesser snare (a'la the necro) for all mobs except for undead for which the snare is the equivalent or even betters the druid snare.<br />
<br />
I realize I am focusing on a minor point in the whole scheme of things, but I feel that, given the relative paucity of Undead zones, an undead snare would not be too particularly helpful whereas a lesser snare may be of some greater use.<br />
<br />

Constantly sitting and healing, sitting and healing.  Cant do much else.  Now, they give you the ability to get up and do respectable melee damage if (and here is the key) IF YOU WANT TO.  No one is forcing you to do it.  <br />
<br />
If you have a druid in the group who feels like being the main healer...LET HIM.  They can do it now.  Get up and step into the fray and deal some decent damage.  <br />
<br />
If there is no other healer in the group, sit and be the main healer.  People complained that we were a plate wearing class and cant go toe to toe with mobs.  If they up the defense cap on us (and I have a feeling they might since procs have a nasty taunt) you can...again IF YOU WANT TO.  <br />
<br />
As one poster stated, the damage from the hammer comes from the proc, and from other posts it seems to go off every 2 or 3 swings, thats a decent amount of damage. If you dont want to step into the fray and feel like nuking, with the new mana regen spell, you can nuke and still have mana to backup heal.  Two clerics in a group is a more attractive option now since one can deal some ok damage meleeing/nuking and backup heal, on the magnitude of a cleric if things goes wrong, and the other can be primary healer. It about the options, they are giving some to us.<br />
<br />
I feel the flames coming,  but I just had to say this.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Vinta</div><div class="date">08-23-2002, 11:47 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I know there are a lot of vocal and very skilled clerics out there who are bored with healing and the end game or whatever and want something new to do; but not everyone is 60th level with a full spellbook, Velious quest armour, and gets stuck in a CH chain every night.  Frankly I still enjoy healing and have no desire to be a &quot;battle cleric&quot;.   I had the &quot;battle cleric&quot; beaten out of me by around 11th level and would like to think I know my place. ;) <br />
<br />
Nor can I afford to be a battle cleric, skill-wise or fund-wise.  Since 20th level, well-meaning groupmates have done their best to keep my Defense from going up, and arguably the rest of my melee skills, too. :)  Hell, even if I had risked the ire of my groups by standing up and swinging a stick, and ended up with maxed melee and Defense skills, my offensive and defensive capabilities would be laughable at best.  Miss miss miss hit for 1 miss miss miss hit for 12 miss miss miss miss. <br />
<br />
The hammer is cute, and I'm sure those of us who have embarassing equipment for our level will be thrilled.  But for the well-equipped clerics who already have better? This is kind of a slap in the face for them, don't you think?<br />
<br />
This idea with the Shields is charming, but it occurs to me that it's going to be a real bitch to raise melee skills when everything that you could raise skills on above 50th level will stomp you into the ground.  Easy enough to raise skills at 25th, but now? Right...  <br />
<br />
I don't want to be a cleradin, or a palic.  Maybe it's just because I'm lazy and don't want to learn a different style of play after all this time.<br />
<br />
And really, I have no desire to solo as a cleric.  When I want to solo, I'll play my druid or my necromancer.   Or I'll log off and play a single player game.  <br />
<br />
Changing the role of a cleric - or any class - so radically this late in the game does not sit well with me, even if the game does need to evolve.   I sure as hell wouldn't have started a cleric three years ago if I'd known that everyone else would get the things that made clerics wanted and valued. Or if I'd known that the class I started because they were so group oriented would be stuck soloing in a couple unfriendly zones with gimpy skills. ;) <br />

<br />
Yes, they ARE forcing us to use them.  How?  By kicking us out of groups, which were our ONLY viable way of getting exp.<br />
<br />
Now, we suddenly will have to melee as our only way of soloing.  When this whole time, we've been slapped on the wrists for meleeing EVER...<br />
<br />
Frankly, the ONLY thing I see helped by these new spells is the &quot;fun&quot; factor of the highest end of the game.  Kudos on that.  Now, please move on to the practical, please.</div></div><hr />

I guess I don't see clerics doing snaring/slowing of live mobs because thats just not what I view a cleric as doing in EQ. A druid snaring I see because I envision the grass and plants reaching out and wrapping around the limbs of the monster.  But yeah, I see your point too!<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">dakaraiofbristlebane</div><div class="date">08-23-2002, 11:59 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Sorry legynd but you are wrong.  We shouldn't have to give up ANYTHING because we are needed at raids.<br />
<br />
To get to raid level we need the ability to get xp.  To get xp you have to be able to solo mobs or group to kill mobs.  If a cleric is not a good group member they will find it very hard to get xp groups &amp; therefore need to solo.  If soloing is your primary means of getting xp you should be good at it, as druids and wizards are now.  If you can't solo efficiently you should be an exellent group member in xp grind groups, as rogues and enchanters are for example.<br />
<br />
Every class needs one or more raid roles but usefullness on a raid MUST be considered seperately from ability to get the xp needed to be useful on raids.   My cleric is 59 right now.  Six months ago I was 57...it took that long because on my server most of the high level folks have figured out that a cleric is an xp drain in ther groups so getting a group is difficult.  My guild doesn't believe in XP groupign together (another rant entirely) so pickup groups are about it for me &amp; lots of other folks.<br />
<br />
Clerics, and every class, must be given a way to efficiently obtain xp.  This method must be usable by a normal population of that class so, for example, it can't be undead only because there are not enough undead for all the clerics to solo.  It doesn't matter if that route is group or solo but everyone should have a set of skills that supports this attempt to increase in level.  If you are a solo class you should be a good solo class.  If you are a group class you should be a good group class.<br />
<br />
These changes make us the worst group members possible of the priest classes while making us better, but still fairly bad, soloers.<br />
<br />
If we are to be melee soloers then our sustained DPS needs to be on between paladins &amp; monks...probably more toward the latter since we can't take the hits generated by the longer fights a soloing paladin deals with.<br />

<br />
Hmm.. YOU advertise lfg and tell them that YOU want to melee because YOU WANT TO - do you think they will pick you over a melee class?<br />
<br />
If you have the opportunity to mess around with melee in an exp group then they really didn't need you for healing did they? A druid or shaman wouldv'e done just fine.<br />
<br />
Okay - you can solo then! Grab a non-undead blue mob and close your eyes so as to not emotionally scar yourself.  After you die, comfort yourself with the knowledge that you can get 96% of that exp back.<br />
<br />
You will need a hell of a lot more than a raised def cap. If VI actually adds in what would be required for a cleric to survive solo-melee, then it would encroach on the role of the paladin.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Aley</div><div class="date">08-23-2002, 12:07 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Here is a few suggestions:<br />
<br />
1- Make the new hammer spell a buff so we still can use our current weapon (i.e. epic or that uber mace from Greigs).<br />
<br />
2- Improve our 1hb and maybe our 2hb. Giving us better melee is the key here...<br />
<br />
3- I would like to see more undead spells for the cleric (not as strong as the necros). Like a 35% or 40% undead slow and maybe another undead specific dot.<br />
<br />
4- Why Verant doesn't use the players religion? I would love to see spells that are deity specific. I dunno a level 60 spell called &quot;Crusade&quot; that is castable only on follower of the same religion as the cleric that could give a small hp regen, attack bonus, an extra 300-500 hp, and some defense and last about 3-5 mins. At the end of the spell the one that benefit from the spell receive an 300-500 pts dmg. (it's a small sacrifice to receive all these bonus). Also, it needs to stack with other spells (avatar, focus, etc). Could also be an ability to cast Yaulp 4 or 5 on others (same religion once more) :)<br />
<br />
5- Modifiy/Add the AA abilities so we could buy with our AA points more melee abilities: maybe a riposte skill, a dodge skill and a critical hit (make us pay a lot for it... but offer us the ability to become real battle clerics). Or maybe somekind of undead specific critical (like the paladins but weaker).<br />
<br />
6- A deity specific send follower to the closest temple could be fun and usefull.<br />
<br />
<br />
VI people really need to make us more fun by giving us a lot more options in group and solo fights. We were the healing specialist by a nice margin, but now the generalist priests (i.e. druids) not only have extreme versatility but now can heal almost as good as us in non-raid situations. Don't make us pay too much for our speciality since we aren't as much specialists as before.<br />

I am getting extremely nit-picky, but I can certainly live w/ the druid snare and understand its premise.  But, as I said, a snare comparable to the necro (minus the DOT) would be nice.  An what helps the necro snare, I wonder?  It seems easier to buy into a Cleric snare w/ &quot;divine&quot; aid than a necro w/ ...not exactly sure what would aid a necro. <br />
<br />
Again, this is a silly point and I am almost embarassed to be airing it.  I guess my question for all of this is, &quot;why aim low?&quot;  If we aim high, we may not get what we want, but we may get something useful.  If we aim low, then I shudder to think...</div></div><hr />

<br />
Thank You for Your post. It sure seems like a nice weapon to wield (especially after reading this post: http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/forums/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=11179 ) and its nice to see a Verant employee visit us, to hear our concerns.<br />
<br />
Still I think this hammer is a bad idea and Im going to give You several reasons why:<br />
<br />
1) Weapons won. Many of us have played this game for years and have fought battles long since gone. Weve earned our scars and weve earned our weapons. This hammer negates all that. Whatever Godly weapon weve wielded before  this one beats it hands down (yep  just like that). Our prize of prizes, The water sprinkler of nem ankh, will now be something we whip out of our backpack when its time to ress someone. Our epic degraded to a simple item only used at special occasions.<br />
<br />
2) Clones. Whatever weve done, whatever our background is, we will all look the same. One of the charms of EQ is to see something new, something Youve never seen before. When I see someone wielding a cool looking weapon I ask what it is, how that person got it. This new hammer of Yours negates all that. We will all be clones.<br />
<br />
3) The lower levels. The clerics that havent reached level 56 will be left out of the solution. They will struggle on their own personal Golgata before they are graciously rewarded at a certain level for all their efforts. Get level 56 and  whammo  all problems solved with buying a simple spell (simplified, I know).<br />
<br />
Rich: this solution seems hasty and ill thought out to me. If You are so determined in making us into battle clerics (after a certain level, mind You) why not make it properly? Raise out dense and melee skills. Perhaps to the same level as the bards? Or somewhere close to it? This would help clerics all over the table  not only after L56.<br />
<br />
Face it: A conjured hammer wont solve our problems!<br />
<br />
- This is not the solution!</div></div><hr />

<br />
Personally if we are solo'ing I'd envision us taking more punishment but being able to make up for it with better effeciency on our self heals.<br />
<br />
Leveraging our ability to heal ourself to make us effective solo'ers is key to fun (and unique class defining) cleric solo'ing imho.  This is why melee is gonna be on the table there.  <br />
<br />
I do think a DS on the yaulp would be a better option than the mana regen which is just gonna make me want to spam yaulp5 while raiding VT which will be a pain in the but =).  The DS would offer effeciency only in solo situations and hence easier to balance.<br />

A while back I solo'd in the Grey using root and dot technique on undead mobs. In the time it took for my C3 to run out I got just under 2 blue of AA XP. Within the same timespan of a single C3 my wizard can get 13 blue of AAXP. That is more than half an AA point. Can any of what you plan to give us help me gain XP any faster than that? Using any of the melee upgrades is not feasible at level 60 because I don't want to get close enough to get hit by XP giving mobs.</div></div><hr />

<br />
On the positive side--you won't remain 56 forever.<br />
<br />
I do understand your concerns.<br />
<br />
The druid was at times, sitting for hours on end lfg, while I as a cleric, at any point in the game, was never lfg.<br />
<br />
I understand that clerics between level 54 and 57 will be more significantly impacted then a cleric that is 58+.  I also know that the ability to rez will probably be a determining factor for groups when has to make a choice.<br />
<br />
Given the cle also has the ability to tremendously buff HP and has a very good ac buff they will also be desired over the druid.  The druid and shaman will become nothing more then a viable alternative for those groups that can't find a cleric.<br />
<br />
On my server, in places where you probably fiht (say Sebilis), groups constantly call out for a cleric.  Sometimes for long periods of time.  In places like Karnors, this is a given--lots of shouts for a cleric and a rez.<br />
<br />
In these two places alone the druid can now act as a more efficient healer and supplement the lack of supply of clerics.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Ok, but ask your typical druid or shaman if they want to be main healer in an exp group.  Most of them will tell you no.  They have much better things to do with their mana.<br />
<br />
I think I phrased my post wrong.  I apologize.  These spells give us more utility.  A better ability to adjust to what your group needs, and not just be there to heal.<br />
<br />
Just change my statement &quot;If you want to&quot; to &quot;If your group makeup calls for it&quot;.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gello</div><div class="date">08-23-2002, 12:44 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">On the outcry that a summoned item is too nice for non-ubers, it's no different than L53 druids all over suddenly getting winged death.  Or paladins getting 20% spell haste from a vendor (Valor of Marr).  A cleric with this may be closer to their non-uber paladin/sk groupmates in melee output, but they won't get the full use out of it since they'll have to heal more.  Healing a 3.5k hp buffed ranger with 900 ac is vastly different than healing one with 5.5k hp and 1200 ac (and the dps to make their ac moot).  The former cleric is not going to be meleeing the whole time if they're fighting anything remotely challenging.  Away from groups and soloing, this summoned hammer is not very different from a new nuke.<br />
<br />
On the outcry that a summoned item is replacing raid-class loot, it's actually not bad.  Casters replace raid-class gear for summoned mage focus items all the time.  It's nothing new.  It's not like that weapon slot has ever really made a difference.  And if you have something that did then this summoned item is just as easy to bag.  I bag my epic lots for situational stuff.  I've passed on blackstars and aleje/smoldering cudgels because I already have too many weapons to carry around (especially once I get a primal).  The norent aspect of this even appeals to me since it's not something I have to devote inventory for full time.<br />
<br />
In the high end xp grinds, as I said before, it's all about DPS.  That's the only thing anyone can bring to a group.  If an xp hunt is not about DPS, then my healing skills are needed and that's where the cleric class isn't broken.  It's not about defensive stuff.  Groups with a cleric already have an enormous leg up on defense with the best hp/ac buffs and heals.<br />
<br />
Personally I think it's an elegant solution.  It's also pretty cool how those without an epic (it sounds near impossible to get one nowadays) have something useful they can wield.<br />
<br />
Most importantly, I think we should base our opinion on what those on test are saying, not in en_spells.dat or our past experiences.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lorelai</div><div class="date">08-23-2002, 12:56 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">A couple of things:<br />
<br />
If druids and shamen want a raid level CH type heal, fine. Make it cost a reasonably expensive reagent per cast, like a pearl (4pp). This would make it less useful for grouping situations, but just fine for raids. I burn a stack of peridots every single raid, which is 210pp, which would be over 50 casts of druid CH with a pearl component. I think I don't cast 50 CH'es in a regular raid.<br />
<br />
For melee, I like the changes, because for some reason, I like tanking things sometimes. But just giving us the hammer and Bash isn't enough. We'd still have fairly low DPS, and die too quickly. My suggestions:<br />
<br />
Up 1hb/2hb caps to 225<br />
Up Defense cap to 225<br />
Up Dodge to 150<br />
Add parry capped at 150<br />
Add block capped at 150<br />
Switch to the hybrid damage table (we should melee better than casters)<br />
Give us the main hand damage bonus but at a lesser rate than melee classes<br />
Give us the same casting/meleeing timing as hybrids</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ammelen</div><div class="date">08-23-2002, 12:57 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">These changes are beyond horrible.  I don't honestly know what the verant dev team is thinking.<br />
<br />
First of all, clerics cannot not get xp groups, cannot solo, but have a great role in raids.  Shamans have great roles in xp groups and raids and can solo well, imo they need no upgrades.  Druids can get xp groups and solo well, yet are lacking a defining raid role.  Adding a 3k cheal means that clerics' xp group situation gets worse and druids' raid situation does not get any better.  This is not fixing the problems, it's making them worse.<br />
<br />
3k is too high for a druid cheal, the most uber tanks on my server have somewhere around 5500 hp with druid or shaman buffs. (These tanks hit about 7500 hp with full raid buffs and about 6k with cleric buffs.)  An average cheal hits at 40 percent.  Even in a cheal chain on a raid with a 7500 hp tank, cheal chains are timed so that the average cheal hits for about 3k hp.  Thus, druids are getting a cheal nearly as effective as a cleric's.<br />
<br />
Now in response, you are giving clerics some gimp ass melee ability? Ugh that's horrible.  First of all, most of us made clerics because we don't want to melee, because we don't enjoy it.  It's not fair to change that role on us at this level of the game.  I can't realistically see how this will give us effective soloing ability.  Paladins can soloo decently well, but even against undead mobs with lots of aaxp and c3/vog, a paladin cannot get anywhere near the solo xp a druid can.  A cleric's melee certainly won't touch a paladin's, so at best clerics will have an extremely gimp solo ability and in a way they don't want to solo.<br />
<br />
You are giving the main class defining ability of clerics to another class.  While I'm not suggesting such changes would be good, a balancing change would involve giving clerics tracking, snare, targeted ae's, and ports.  This is huge, you are giving away the only thing a cleric has and giving us trash in return.<br />
<br />
The heal spells you have set up, while good in concept, are really poorly designed.  Consider the group elixir spell.  On test now it's 975 mana for 1200 hp in 4 ticks.  I can cast word of redemption now for 1100 mana (125 more mana) which delivers a complete heal to all members in less time (10s total to deliver the heal).  Celestial Elixir is a great spell, because while it is slow, it is the most efficient heal except cheal.  Look at the hierarchy you set up before, elixir is more efficient than other group heals, less efficient than cheal, so you can use it when someone doesn't need an immediate heal to avoid death.  The new group elixir is more mana, not less, than the group instant heal word of restoration, which also throws in poison and disease cures.  Why would i use it over word of restoration and word of redemption?  At that mana cost, I wouldn't.  Maybe in a few circumstances where I am trying to watch aggro very carefully, but I can't see many uses for it.  Ethereal remedy and light aren't bad as they are, but hardly make up for giving druids our class defining ability.<br />
<br />
WE DON'T WANT TO MELEE.  WE DON'T WANT TO SOLO.  We chose the cleric class because we wanted to group and we wanted to play a caster.  As it is now, we already can't get xp groups.  Why take a cleric when shamans or druids can keep a group healed as it is in most zones and can also haste, dot, slow, ds, port, evac, nuke, etc...<br />
<br />
Clerics have given up EVERYTHING to get cheal.  We can't melee, can't nuke effectivley, have no snare, have no ports, have no invis, can't solo anything decently, have lousy inherent mana regen, have no speed altering spells, have no slows or debuffs to speak of... We have NOTHING of value except cheal and rez basically...  You are taking away cheal, which means our value now in xp groups will be rezzing them for pp after they wipe.<br />
<br />
This is horrible.  Please verant don't do this to us.  If this goes live, I guess I'll just quit playing my cleric altogether and play my other characters, fortunately I have that option, not all clerics do.</div></div><hr />

We've seen that Shadow Knoghts are receiving some upgrades soon, but are there any plans to change or add spells for Paladins as well, I wonder?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">aandaie</div><div class="date">08-23-2002, 01:22 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">There is really no way this is someone from Verant, or if it is its a joke. There are several key parts of this post that make it a rather obvious joke:<br />
<br />
1: &quot;- Provide clerics with useful group and raid roles as other priests gain raid quality healing&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
They will always have that via resurrects and Complete heal, along with the most mana efficient healing and the fact they only do one thing on raids mainly, HEAL, GO FIGURE.<br />
<br />
 <br />
2: &quot;- Decrease the cleric's mandatory dependancy on grouping for any reasonable gain&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
That would be like decreasing the warrior's need to eventually group. Its part of the class and its why the two go together well.<br />
This will ALWAYS be needed for clerics.<br />
<br />
<br />
3: &quot;The summoned hammer is a unique weapon in that it has a very high proc frequency, doing 75-150 damage per proc.&quot;<br />
<br />
HIGHLY dubious. Proc is proc, there is no increased proc frequency. All things proc at the same proc RATE possible.<br />
<br />
<br />
 <br />
4: &quot;In testing, clerics have been effective soloing the entrance to Charasis and Chardok, grouping in a number of high end dungeons, and even making reasonable experience as a two-cleric duo in Cazic-Thule.&quot;<br />
<br />
This last part had me rolling on the floor choking on dust bunnies.<br />
This will never, ever happen.<br />
 <br />
<br />
<br />
5: &quot;While this may not be sufficient to get clerics into groups by itself, it does add significant value and allows even multi-cleric groups to be profitable. Fairly extensive play-testing, both by game designers and clerics on test have proven these spells to be effective, and perhaps more importantly, very entertaining to use. &quot;<br />
<br />
Okay, if you have not got it by now there is no hope.<br />
Once again, clerics are the most in demand character for groups,<br />
especially at the level when they'd have this hammer (they have<br />
the 96 percent res at 56 after all..)<br />
<br />
<br />
6: &quot;In addition to the added spells, we'll be trying out the Bash skill for Clerics, beginning at level 25. While this skill will cap out lower than their melee counterparts, clerics should still get a decent amount of value out of this addition. It adds a bit of damage as well as a free chance to stun opponents. This also works well with the recent improvements to shields on Test, that give a meaningful boost to armor class, in addition to a chance to block incoming blows.&quot;<br />
<br />
I'm having trouble breathing now....<br />
Number six is the ultimate fake post clincher though:<br />
<br />
<br />
6: &quot;Clerics are going to receive additional changes so that they have some abilities that makes them more sought after for grouping.&quot;<br />
<br />
Cause they can't get groups at 56.. aHAHAHHHAHAHA.<br />
OH MY GAD&gt; Please tell me everyone is pulling my leg in thinking this post is real? PLEASE TELL ME.<br />
<br />
<br />
7:  &quot;It's very important that clerics have an ability that makes other players say &quot;I really want to invite a cleric because they can do X, and that will be really helpful.&quot; <br />
<br />
Once again, makes it very obvious. Cleric's have had that forever and its some OTHER classes who don't. X for the cleric is resurrects and the best healing. Its the most in demand set of &quot;x&quot;.<br />
<br />
Do you have ANY idea what they'd have to do to other classes if this stuff was true? I'll give you a hint, a 2900 max hp heal for druids is not really it. You could give druids that AND a group heal and NO ONE is still going to take them instead of a cleric in the 50's. As far as the shaman goes, its ALWAYS going to be in a group with a cleric alerady in it. Newer heals for those classes are ONLY for raids and adding spam heals on the MT that the cleric CH chain will be healing. Druid and shaman STILL won't be part of that chain.<br />
<br />
Ammelen seems to be adding into the ruse:<br />
<br />
&quot;First of all, clerics cannot not get xp groups,&quot;<br />
<br />
What? Clerics get the best xp groups of all. The clerics I know have the most AA points of all, they certainly don't get them solo.<br />
<br />
The funniest thing is eqcaster's realm posted this. Maybe they are in on the joke, at least I HOPE that they did not think it was real.<br />
<br />
More from Ammelen:<br />
<br />
&quot;Adding a 3k cheal means that clerics' xp group situation gets worse and druids' raid situation does not get any better&quot;<br />
<br />
Aahahh what? its the total opposite. A heal that big will only <br />
really be useful for a raid or the druid shagging mobs in a<br />
duo with an sk or something. Cleric's xp group situation..<br />
ahahaa... LIFE in the game in general is an xp group <br />
for the cleric.<br />
<br />
There has also been no mention of the size of the shaman and druid heal, but if the druid was 3 k it would CERTAINLY have a HUGE BUTT cast time. I'm talking so huge to make it worthless<br />
in all but a few situations. During a raid my druid will sill be casting chloroblast 99 percent of the time because someone has to save a stupid wizard while all the clerics are in the CH chain.<br />
<br />
Bash for the cleric.. sflkdjlk make it stop.. make it stop.. <br />
What people seem to want is the paladin, but with CH and the<br />
cleric's other heals/resurrects. This would be like giving my druid<br />
ranger melee ability at 56 and up. Not.. going.. to happen, nor<br />
should it.</div></div><hr />

It'd be nice but there isnt thaat many undead content. Both Grey and Acrylia are usually crowded while neither Maidens nor TM is that good xp anyways. And honestly... sham/druid heals gonna replace us all around the globe so such limited use fix while being coherent with the class 'theme' wouldnt be enough.<br />
<br />
DS tanking is a solo method that some clerics are using already, issue is that its costly (shaman potions ouch) or requires some really time consuming to adquire items (chardok ring, dain ring). Adding a DS component to yaulp would be what the spell needs. To imbue weapon they should create a  new spell, yaulp is of a too short duration, concerning if spells can modify proc rate... ya got any proof adon? would be an interesting concept.<br />

The recent changes are giving us 1, 2, and 3.   .750 batting average is godly.   <br />
<br />
Instead of lambasting the changes, give Jahaar some idea's on how you would fix it.  Sitting around saying its broke is easy, fixing it is hard.  I'm just glad Verant is willing to make some serious changes, even if their first attempt isn't what you would like.   <br />
<br />
It seams to me the biggest area of concern is the 48-55 crowd, they don't see real benfits from the changes, yet they have to compete with.  Why don't we come up with some suggestions to make this level group more viable, especially since they have to compete with level 54 druid and shaman CHers.<br />
<br />
Finally to all the Healers vs. Battle clerics.   This change doesn't mean you have to hang up your meditation pad (or saddle now days) and equip the mace.   It gives us something to do when mana is good, we are soloing, it doesn't mean we will have to melee to get groups, and I'm sure thats not what Jahaar intends.</div></div><hr />

Since this is far short of what you need to do to help make the class half way enjoyable i am very unimpressed.  I have been playing for almost 3 years and after today i am almost as depressed as the day i found out what STUPID Velious armor effects had.  Summon food and water?  That kind of crap should be dubbed a vendor.  <br />
<br />
On many high end raids in NTOV, Ssra temple there will be NO cleric meleeing....You will be doing a CH chain like every day till the cows come home.  A cleric could be auto'd by anyone.  <br />
<br />
There is such a great demand for clerics should be addressed.  I never have a problem getting a group.  Its the simple fact that i sit constantly and just cast a SINGLE SPELL....Complete heal...Maybe If you lowered the resistance on Mark of Retribution i would have 2 spells to cast.   <br />
<br />
Next time you look to do something to the class Make it intresting to sit for 45 mins or make it so we can med at level 60 standing up.  I cannot stand to play my cleric anymore more than 40 mins at a time because the game is no longer fun.  I don't see how soloing with melee will be much different i will still have to med for 100000 hours inbetween each mob since all cleric nukes are mana inefficent. <br />

<br />
Thanks for the update.  As a person who has played his cleric from almost the inception of EQ however, I still hope expressing concerns are also looked at for your proposed changes.<br />
<br />
Making clerics better at melee does not really help our class become more desirable in group situations.  Mainly because like you stated, we are gonna still be there for healing.. I find it unlikely that clerics are gonna concentrate on meleeing in a group situation, instead of paying attention to their group mates hps.<br />
<br />
Making clerics better at melee may help us on the solo front however, but do you really believe the changes you have thus far mentioned, put us anywhere near what shammies, and druids already do for exp. solo?  I find it a bit unlikely that clerics will be able to pull four wyverns at a time in Cobalt scar and melee them to the same experience gain as a quad pulling druid.  I mention this not because I want to be a solo player, but because the heals that are being proposed will pretty much make it more mandatory.  Even before these new heals were introduced, the Cleric class in general has been slowly having trouble finding groups, even my own guildmates say that having a cleric in groups such as sebilis, does nothing but slow down the experience grind.  Giving us melee abilities doesn't address the group situation, but giving druids and shammies the proposed heal just further precludes us out of groupage. <br />
<br />
I think zones like the re vamped CT is the path to take.. If indeed these heals are gonna happen (which I believe they are), then having more zones that still require our exceptional healing abilities, that drop wanted items that all classes can benefit from, and challenge even the most experienced and balanced of teams is the only way to save us in group situations.  If the developement teams just look at the zones and the players that are lfg, rarely would they see a CT group without a cleric.. I think that is what really would be what most of us want.  Also in these same CT groups you will find shaman and druids as well.. No one is left out : ) .   <br />
<br />
One more thing Mr. Waters, and then I will take another breath.. Many of us spent 60 levels by being group dependant.. Giving us melee skills that will allow us some degree of solobility is a 180 degree change for us.   If we seem skepticle that these enhancements are going to help us become more group friendly, then great, but if the changes proposed only help druids and shammies become more raid friendly at our expense, then please consider that before implementing these new heals.  <br />

Hmmm dont wanna bash you, but in Ssra the only time clerics get locked in med/heal mode is during boss fights. During moves its all nuking, meleeing or /follow and /gems. NToV more or less the same unless you are having a multi flurry pull.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">SaylerEQ</div><div class="date">08-23-2002, 01:50 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">This is just a horrible idea.  <br />
<br />
First, IF I want to go bang on mobs, I've got a monk.  I don't play my cleric when I want to bang on mobs.  That's NOT what he does.<br />
<br />
Second, the proposed spell changes totally eliminate any real chance for clerics to get GOOD groups at 54.  You won't need more than a druid or shaman in XP groups once they have a version of CHeal.  So it only does 75% health?  Hell, that's fine.  My monk solos all the time at 50% health.  Add in a druid's DoTs and damage shield or a shaman's slows and you're well past any NEED for a cleric.  And Brell only knows there's more than enough druids to go around...<br />
<br />
Third, since I'll NEED to solo my cleric once these changes go in, I certainly won't want to be doing that by meleeing.  Geez, how about a DoT that works on live mobs and a snare so I can at least root &amp; rot?   What's proposed will do no more than make sure that IF I can kill one mob, I'll spend all my mana doing it AND healing myself later.   Druids can solo four on a bar of mana;  shaman get mana regen well past that of clerics and get a pet to help.  Are we seriously supposed to let our Hammer tank for us so we can get off a heal?<br />
<br />
Horrible, horrible ideas.  If you want to make druids and shaman raid-capable healers, do so.  Give them thier CHeal, but make it 600 mana and include a 2pp/use reagent.  Then they'd do just fine -- on raids, in a secondary healing role, just what they NEED.<br />
But please don't nerf my ability to get an XP group and tell me I was supposed to be a nerfed paladin...</div></div><hr />

In all your travels across norrath, you will never hear uttered:<br />

I could list AoW fight, THO (ten minute useless CH chain), Parasite worm Ring, Ring of Fire(s), VT, I could drone on and on....No need to waste all the time.  <br />
<br />
I just wanted to give a few small examples...Still the soloing capabilities after this patch will be the same.  The cleric has to tank an unslowed mob and out taunt the pet with nukes and such for the pet not to kick the bucket.  I can't root the thing so therefor i have to Tank it...No you can't DA or DB bc you will lose aggro and the pet will die.  So therefor we are back to Rooting and Nuking for soloing.  This patch if implemented is a wad of used toliet paper.<br />
<br />
This will change nothing.  Even with all the FT my cleric has and the self buffs it won't matter bc the nukes are mana inefficent, cleric downtime will be greater than a warrior who has an invigorate BP and is soloing.<br />
<br />
Especially since all the nukes and DoTs are magic based mobs especially in luclin have high MR...So we would be resisted lots anyways.  The Group CE = worthless Group CH is only 1200 mana why would group CE need to be 1025 *i think that was the mana cost they said*  its insanely high.  I would cast group CH over that spell any day of the week, bc i wouldn't have to cast it multiple times.<br />

I love grouping. I made a cleric so I would be wanted in groups, and could meet new people and have fun making friends. Since I was a cleric and had the best heals I was always wanted in groups. But I have seen my role less needed in groups for awhile now. And these new Druid and Shaman CH have me scared. As for the new Melee spells and hammer, well the Wisdom on the hammer will be nice for me, since I am moving to my old server to rejoin my RL friends, and its nice to summon an 8 Wis 35 mana hammer. I don't see it being useful in groups. Since i spend alot of time LFG, when i d get a group, it is because they don't have a shaman to slow or chanter for adds, so they really need my healing. The hammer and yaulp will not help out much there for I will be healing and medding. But I do look forward to Partnering with my Warrior friend. For now instead of just standing MoRing the mob and CHing my warrior friend and medding again, I can slap the mob around a bit in melee. The new changes are both good and bad, but they said more are on the way, so scared as I am of them, I will have to wait till all the changes are up a running before I decide what to do with my role.</div></div><hr />

<br />
In this regard, I am particularly enamoured by the proposed &quot;Bless&quot; line with its various enhancements.  Not sure if those proposed on this forum would be enough to get us into a grp over and above other classes, but some finessing of the idea may be just what the doctor ordered.<br />
<br />
Anyhow, the proposed changes are a part of the whole.  A disappointing part?  This is obviously the case for some, but if (and this is truly a big &quot;IF&quot;) the aid to xp grping is a sound, viable, and truly useful option, then perhaps we will all be relatively happy.  Those who want to solo can *try* to do so (although a raising on certain skill caps, as proposed by others does seem to be in order here), those who want to grp can do so, and those who desire to raid should find that our functionality in this regard is still more or less intact.</div></div><hr />

While I pay just as much to subscribe to EQ as the die-hards who play for hours every night, I cannot devote that much time to the game to level my character up to 55+!  I am more interested in exploring the world and meeting interesting characters.<br />
<br />
What concerns me is that none of these changes affect lower level clerics at all.  If it's merely the end-game raid balancing that's going on, that's fine - perhaps VI thinks that &lt;55 classes are completely balanced.  But perhaps VI could clarify their position on this?<br />
<br />
The post states that the goals of these changes are:<br />
1.  Provide clerics with useful group and raid roles as other priests gain raid quality healing.  <br />
2. Decrease the cleric's mandatory dependancy on grouping for any reasonable gain<br />
3. Increase the level of variety and interest involved in playing a cleric<br />
<br />
The post says the 'first part of the change was to add the following spells.'  I certainly hope that this is only the FIRST part of the change because the spells added are Lvl 56!  Clerics less than level 56 would not experience any of the three changes noted.<br />
<br />
I must assume that other lower level spells following the paradigm will be implemented as well to give clerics of, hmm less imposing stature, access to the same character style.  It just seems a bit schizophrenic to play in one style for 55 levels and then give clerics a supposed melee ability and tell them to go at it!<br />
<br />
Could Verant verify that this change will be implemented among lower level clerics as well if the changes (or hopefully modified changes) make it live?<br />
<br />
On a separate note but still on topic, I wonder:  IF VI thinks that the proc of the new hammer is a major component of the new meleeing cleric paradigm - why not just make a spell that adds a self-only proc buff?  That would allow clerics to use a variety of weapons rather than having all 55+ 'soloing clerics' (&lt;--- lol this I HAVE to see) running around with the same weapon.<br />

 <br />
I can almost guarentee that a cle's melee out put post 54 isnt going to be good enough to solo squat.  imo the only way these changes are going to be good is to raise the lvl of undead in game AND add more undead mobs. <br />
<br />
Imagine Unrest as a 50+ zone<br />
<br />
These changes are to higher end char because VI has screwed up and made the high end game almost totaly dependant on clerics. They are trying to even it out but in weak fashion. Shm/Dru getting CH would be fine if it was AA and not a given at X lvl.</div></div><hr />

Actually even without the new spell there would be alot of people that would prefer a druid or shaman over a cleric in many places.<br />
<br />
&quot;I don't have as good a heals as the cleric&quot;<br />
<br />
You DONT need the best heal spells, you JUST need to overheal mob dmg output without suffering from downtime *hint* what made clerics preferred choice during kunark was NOT that they had the best heal but because druids could not compensate dmg output. <br />
<br />
&quot;I mainly don't have RESURRECT&quot;<br />
<br />
You DONT need it. Hardly anyone dies xp grinding nowadays (unless on risky AoE groups). And if someone does, its not that hard to find clerics and pay for a rez. Ask enchanters if they get groups for KEI... they just get people ask them to go solo.<br />
<br />

<br />
&quot;Cleric wanted for 56 plus group. Which is what you've always heard&quot;<br />
<br />
Huh, no. Since quite some time ago both druids and shamans have become better healers for xp grinding because the original EQ idea of &quot;full groups struggling on dangerous dungeons&quot; died long long time ago. XP grinding is &quot;small versatile groups with almost no downtime on low risk places&quot;. Suggest you buy a time machine and set it for destination:luclin.<br />
<br />
&quot;(from a desperate sk or paladin) &quot;hey, you and I could <br />

The fun part is that druid/shaman + pal/sk duos are really good xp, almost no downtime combos already.</div></div><hr />

If they are going to make a spell with a summoned weapon that frequently procs, I'd actually prefer thay made a spell that tripples or more our current proc rates, or adds a high rate proc to the weapon of our chouce, we have a wide variety of nice weapons with procs, (Hammer of the Sun, Undead Click DoT; Rightiousness, 150ish DD + Stun vs. all; Fred has a nice 2hb w/ Undead proc; Dawnfire, undead nuke; Truesight Hammer, summoned nuke; Mace of Confusion, Anti-Agro; =P)<br />
<br />
Group CE + the new versions of DL and Remedy are something that just should have hppened long ago. I can't even remember when I last needed remedy, I've been a CE + DL + CH junky considering the mana pool and mana income I've had in the past few months. When casting something other than CE or CH it's all about hp's/time, and DL has that pretty squarely beat, while not as fast as Remedy, the extra hps are meaningful.<br />
<br />
Bash and block are welcome, but what about our worthless dodge? <br />
<br />
This looks well intended and I'm glad to see it, so I'm not complaining about the intention, but I'd like to see somethings that will scale with mudflation a little more, look at our old summon hammer line, they used to be uber, now they are a joke. I remember when clerics were routenley invited to Wisp groups because you knew for sure had a magical weapon! Big time baby! But now... This new hammer I'm worried will fade in value not long after PoP, and would much prefer some form of self buff proc rate uber increaser (And I don't mean a dex buff) =P.<br />

<br />
I like the melee changes, its one step twards makeing more then one cleric in a group worth having (which is also a big problem. people keep bringing up that clerics are practicly required in a group, but they forget that you only need one, and that 2 is useless. No other class is like that. even more then one enchanter can allow for reall big ass pulls or even AE fighting. )<br />
<br />
how ever are you going to be doing anything about CURRENT cleric usable weapons in the game? A have a hammer of rightouseness and it is a hammer of no small feet to obtain, and does some good damage. but from the way it looks... this summoned hammer which every cleric will have puts mine to shame. (well, &quot;kinda&quot;). <br />
<br />
are we going to see any of these high end weapons tweaked for cleric usage as an alternative to the summoned hammer?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">JonJonSanfru</div><div class="date">08-23-2002, 03:10 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I haven't had time to read all the pages here, but i have gone through a 'most' of them and my view is as follows:<br />
<br />
1. It seems that most clerics do not want to Melee because we will never be 'effective' melee dmg dealers and realisticly that is not what an EQ Cleric does. Along with this is the fact that inorder to kill a mob we will still rely on Spells to do a good deal of damage and out Dmg spells are not mana efficient. So even though we are doing extra melee dmg, we will still have long med periods in between mobs. This is to say that increasing caps and adding skills will not signifacantly increase our desirablity in groups and make out class a feasible solo class.<br />
<br />
2. Also most clerics feel that an upgraded Undead line would be a waste considering the lack of Undead mobs in general (more undead zones is not a complete solution either). <br />
<br />
3. Most people seem to think that only 'End Game' Clerics should be getting any upgrades. This is fundamently wrong. A cleric life is tougher XP wise all the way up to 50+ and beyond (ie not just limited to lvl 50+). I'm glad that so many of you have reached the top of your game, and i'm glad that you think that all the time you went through entitles you to more of an opinion and that you think that every other cleric should get the shaft until they reach lvl 50+ to enjoy the benefits you want right now. Everyone here pays the same to play and everyone deserves the same consideration &lt;period&gt;<br />
<br />
4. VI is not going to massivley overhaul our spell line, its not a reasonable request. It would be nice, but from what i've read it seams that that is not the way VI does things.<br />
<br />
5. I think Druid CHeal is fine, its nice that at that level there is a backup healer (that is not just a token healer) and that the Druid class has a rounded approach to the game. I do not think Shamans should get it. Shamans are Shamans... they mitigate damage a different way. They should get better slows, remove restrictions from Torpor and be given a mini-Torpor at a lower level.<br />
<br />
6. My suggestion to balance out class? A pet, plain and simple. Something like Summon Animated Holy Armor, get the line starting lvl 39 (one set after the Shms) or at lvl 34. It doesn't have to be massivley powerful, but Bane against Undead would be nice. This adds the melee capabilty to the cleric without changing what we fundamentaly are. There, now we can add melee dmg to out spell dmg without making have as much down time because we can med while the Pet holds aggro. It means that XP groups will have a reason to keep us... Buffs, Healing, and Pet (who does relatively significant dmg via melee). It can bash, dual weild... etc. Also it doesn't really change our Raid role and it doesn't over balance us, just gives us the means to get XP on our own if we can't find a group and means that in a group we can contribute more to the DPS. There are some considerations that i am not informed enough to make suggestions on, but this is a feasible solution to our problem. And for lvl 54s who have the unswerving hammer spell already, well just have a minor quest that gets it swapped for the lvl 54 pet spell.<br />
<br />
Alright everyone, if anyone read this post a reply and tell me what you think...why this is right, why its wrong, why its kinda right but need tweaking... etc. If someone has already addressed this i apologize for repeating it, but this kind of post is not well represented in this thread so maybe a double is a good thing. And those 50+ Clerics who think they are entitled because they 'went through so much crap'... well i really don't know anything about that because i haven't been playing for 3 years, but i know that it is quite unfair to say you are more important than the rest of us... like i said we all pay the same and we should all benefit 'now' from these upcoming changes whatever they may be. Lvl 40 Shms/Drus have no problem getting groups and XP... while its not a problem for a simlarly lvled Cleric to get a group, it gets just a tedious healing... unless you are lucky enough to have gotten a KEI bestowed upon you. Get it? the 'Cleric Class' needs and upgrade... not 'Lvl 50+ Cleric Players' plz remeber this when you are posting.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gherad</div><div class="date">08-23-2002, 03:21 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I think clerics should get 250 defensive, offensive, double attack, riposte, dodge, a 50% slow and a snare spell.  Heck, you should get an AE snare and an AE damage spell so you can go quad kite in Maidens.  Bah.<br />
<br />
What kind of backwards server are you all playing on that you can't get xp groups?<br />
<br />
Take a look at other classes spells sometimes to put things into perspective.  Wizards are the best nukers in the game, bar none.  But their spells aren't 250% better than druid nukes.  The margin is much, much smaller (about 20%).  Rogues are the best melee damage dealers in the game, but they aren't 340% better than warriors (about 30%).<br />
<br />
This is a game where small differences in classes make a big impact over the long run.  You've enjoyed an absurd monopoly on healing for the past few years, and now that two other classes can heal 50% as well as you, you scream bloody murder.<br />
<br />
If you can't get in any xp groups, then go make some friends like everyone else has to.<br />
<br />
It looks like Verant is trying to help with the issues of soloing and the boredom of doing nothing but healing.  I think that's great.  If you don't like what they are doing, then point out how it could be improved.  But stop whining about shaman and druid stealing your spots and complaining that you can never get xp groups.  If you want something to complain about, play a paladin or a mage or a wizard.  You'll look back with fondness on the days when you were a cleric and it only took you 15 minutes of /lfg to be picked up.</div></div><hr />

I have no desire to be a battlecleric.  That isnt why i started playing one, and regardless of the changes that go live, i dont think i will be one.<br />
<br />
If you want to put clerics up to par with druids/shaman in group desirability, consider matching the usefulness/damage mitigation of slow/snare/dots/whatever through Marks or some other sort of spell.  I wouldnt mind being 100% group dependent if it meant there would be some 'REAL' reason to want clerics in groups.<br />
<br />
As many others have mentioned before me, the spells you are testing do nothing in their current state to increase cleric desirability at all.  I realize balancing this game is an enormously difficult task, and i wish you the best of luck.</div></div><hr />

I think a buff spell that adds a proc to our current weapon would also be a much better method.</div></div><hr />

Sitting = 100 mana in 4 ticks.<br />
Melee w/ Yaulp = 30 mana in 4 ticks.<br />
<br />
That's more than three times the amount of mana for sitting. We won't be able to keep up with mana to be &quot;wanted&quot; in a group.<br />
<br />
We will be OUT OF MANA and our GROUP WILL BE DEAD if we use the weapon.<br />
<br />
(Ok, the 1% of the clerics with FT15 wont be effected, the other 99% will)<br />
<br />
There's one thing you can do to this, and I bet every cleric would be happy with it. It would solidify our ability to manage in the group with this hammer upgrade that is going to force us to lose 25 mana per tick. (that's ALOT of mana to lose!!)<br />
<br />
1. Allow us to gain the 25 mana per tick while meleeing. Ie: Remove the clerics ability to need to sit to med.<br />
2. Increase our defense / AC caps, as well as 1hb.<br />
<br />
Otherwise, we are dead in the water and won't see XP unless friends significantly watch their DPS in a group drop from grouping us.<br />
<br />
I do not want to be a burden on my friends, and have them group me out of pities sake, because another class can so significantly increase the DPS of their group...<br />
<br />
Edit: For the love of god, make sure these 'balancing spells' do not drop for 1% of the server. Make sure they are vendored, or yard trash mobs an xp group can get. I beg you, please.<br />

To all of you that say : &quot;I have better weapons , why would I use this&quot;  , &quot;this is a toy&quot; , &quot;I can't rely on procs&quot;<br />
<br />
you did not read very well ; This weapon is designed to have a high proc rate<br />
<br />
<br />
To all of you whining (and yes, I'm starting to see why people are calling us whiners ; I never used to believe that) about how &quot;I was the dutiful cleric who sat down, med'd and healed ; How do I raise my defense/1hb/offense now that I'm high lvl&quot;<br />
<br />
Theres a herd of lemmings jumping off that cliff..Follow them, for obviously they are doing what is right. What does that mean? You allowed the &quot;many&quot; to dictate how you played your character and have closed your mind to change<br />
<br />
<br />
None of the proposed changes for us do ANYTHING to change your current playstyle. (That is especially true to all of you saying &quot;this forces us to use some crappy summoned hammer&quot;)<br />
<br />
You don't want to use it, then do JUST AS YOU ALWAYS HAVE, sit there med, stand heal, rinse repeat<br />
<br />
Do not presume to speak for all clerics when you say &quot;WE DON'T WANT MELEE&quot;<br />
<br />
Speak for yourself...I wanna be able to melee some as a cleric..I dont tell you how to play, don't presume to tell me<br />
<br />
I think Verant is trying to address a very difficult issue ; Cleric-bane , aka &quot;Complete Heal&quot; has limited what can be done for clerics, because the outrage that would come from it...&quot;You gave them X!  But they can already complete heal and get in groups!&quot;<br />
<br />
I am level 52, in a small guild ; I have no doubt I will never have my epic, and/or any of the &quot;uber&quot; cleric weapons; A weapon like this suits me just fine (and probably many others) <br />
<br />
You have better? <br />
<br />
/clap<br />
/cheer<br />
<br />
Use your choice of weapons then...<br />
<br />
Let Verant work on this issue ; Its just some proposals and cannot hurt your gameplay<br />
<br />
<br />
and quit pulling in other class issues/gripes/concerns.. Let's try and act a bit more level headed and discuss this, rather than argue back and forth</div></div><hr />

<br />
A 54 druid is going to be a much better choice for xp groups than you.  Your ability to gain xp will be reduced.  The 'fix' for this nerf is for level 56 and higher clerics not you folks at level 52 who need a lot of xp to reach the fix &amp; will have a lot of trouble gaining that xp.<br />
<br />
That's not whining, that's the most likely outcome.  Most melees I know, including myself when I'm on one of my melee alts, don't waste space on a cleric in an xp group.  It wouldn't make sense to invite a class that won't be doing much work, won't speed up the kills, but will be diluting the xp the rest of us gain.  I hate doing this so I usually just dual box with my cleric but if I'm in a full group that isn't in CT I don't normally want or need a cleric.<br />
<br />
How do folks plan on reaching 56 when somewhere between 50 and 55 they will be constantly competing with the ten thousand druids on thier server for a spot in an xp group and those druids are much better equipped to help the group advance?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Goryn Grimblade</div><div class="date">08-23-2002, 05:16 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I think certain parts of this change are a good step in the right direction.  An upgraded Remedy-class spell was needed, provided it is the VERY VERY close to the same mana and cast time.  I really hate having casters drop out from underneath heals, and thats exactly what happens when you Divine Light or anything of that cast time.<br />
<br />
I also feel quite insulted you feel our healing is &quot;more than adequate&quot;.  For the most part I agree with you, but when you propose spells that require far too much mana and far too long a casting time to be efficient and effective, it makes me wonder whether or not YOU understand about healing.<br />
<br />
Better melee is kinda cool, though not particularly useful lest I plan on soloing.  I also hope you plan on adding more spell gems because I certainly wont drop a Divine or heal for Yaulp 5.  Bash is SO long overdue I have moved past, into 2HB.  But I am pleased to see we are FINALLY getting this skill, and I still have a shield or two lying around I will bring out and dust off.<br />
<br />
If you plan on adding melee, however, it has been pointed out that a corresponding increase in Defense is warrented.  We are a plate class, yet somewhere in your combat system's damage calculation this seems missed.<br />
<br />
Stacking issues.  Blessed Armor stacks with not a dam thing.  Harnessing overwrites it, Protection of Glades overwrites it, and I am sure there is more.  For Brell's sake, FIX IT.  And I fully expect Yaulp 5, whether or not I choose to cast it, WILL stack with Blessed Armor.  Else, what is the point.<br />
<br />
A temple gate.  Yes, I know about Faithstones.  Yes, they are cool.  We deserve a spell with this, not another item.  We are supposed to be devote follower of ___, able to ask him/her for divine protection, yet we cannot gate to our home temple.  Seems a little off to me.<br />
<br />
Finally, I am VERY curious to know where these fine spells will be located.  One would hope they would be vendor sold, but I have no illusions that will be the case.  While I may be thinking a little long term here, I think its an important consideration for clerics.  Cool, you give us these spells.  Not cool, 1% of clerics can kill MOB and loot it.  Or, not cool, these spells cost 100k+ (worse than Malo/Torpor).<br />
<br />
You are starting to pacify me, personally, though I am still skeptical on many things.  I do think you still have a way to go in compensating us for dr00d/shaman Heal.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kalinn</div><div class="date">08-23-2002, 06:08 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">If our balancing is to be an upgrade to melee skills, please give us the same DPS as druids have. My wife plays a druid and with epic and ES arms can do mana free approx 2k damage in 30 seconds <br />
<br />
this is incorrect.  druid epic and es arms do a grand total of 444hp damage in 30 seconds.  epic total is 1650 over 3 minutes, es arms total is 372 over 1 minute 6 seconds.  clerics already do have mana-less damage up to 366 damage in 30 seconds, although it is not as easily delivered as that from druid items.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
1) Our solo capability must be on par with necros/quadding peoples  <br />
<br />
this is just not feasible.  the main purpose of the balancing is to create an even playing field for all of us out of the combination of soloing, grouping, and raiding.  putting clerics as equal soloers to necro or quadding would make them way above others in the grand total.  you cannot be equal to the best soloers, be of average valuable to groups (debatable whether average or high), AND have the absolute top spot of raids where you compose 20% of the raiding force, and still be balanced.<br />
<br />
for a long time, the druids and necros ability to solo has been held out to them as a reason for their lack of desirability for groups or raids (in comparison to other classes), and one of the main cries against druid healing upgrades from clerics has been that soloability.  well now both can share in the boring soloing and the boring count/heal at raids.  you will find that the ability to solo does not make up for much if you dont want to be soloing in the first place.<br />
<br />
the major complaint i see here is that clerics dont want to melee, they want to be casters.  the problem with that is it would make a cleric a more viable soloer, but not a more viable grouper, and that also is a major complaint against the new soloing abilities because clerics seem to want to group.  spell damage takes mana and reduces your healing capabilities, melee damage doesnt (when paired with standing mana regen from yaulp).  so these changes allow clerics to deal damage while at the same time not reducing their healing potential.  any time a dru/shm is in that healing position, their damage dealing reduces their healing potential.  with the cleric damage coming from melee, they are still far and above the most capable healer choice for groups.<br />
<br />
of course, the yaulp line before 5 needs to be changed to allow clerics to scale up in these new abilities from a lower level than mid 50s, as well as perhaps introducing a scaling version of the hammer so that the stats and proc go up with each additional spell.<br />
<br />
but i would definately suggest that you NOT ask for the hammer idea to be taken away completely just because some high end items may have to be bagged.  there are a whole lot of clerics in the 50 to 60 range that do not have a primary weapon that comes anywhere close to this suggested hammer, and it would be sad to get that nerfed for these clerics.  bagging epics or certain items isnt unheard of, in fact many druids bag epics on a regular basis so they may use one of those super items, and the epic only comes out for certain purposes, like the cleric hammer would.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Romidar</div><div class="date">08-23-2002, 06:22 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Let me start by saying that clerics need upgrades even if the changes to druids &amp; shaman don't go through. They need significant upgrades if they do. It sounds like the druid/shaman upgrades are coming only as a result of PoP, but it's going to seriously impact pre-PoP areas.<br />
<br />
Also let me say that I don't know what changes would be really good for cleric. Making them better healers seems silly and making them even better vs. undead is only a minor help (as a paladin, I know how few zones we get to use our anti-undead abilities in already). Things that would make clerics more desired in groups are mainly things that other classes already have (haste, slow, ATK buffs, etc.). Being able to significantly debuff mobs' ATK ratings (e.g., protection from evil riff) would possibly help. Anyway - I can't say what is most needed so I'll shut up on that aspect.<br />
<br />
What disturbs me is the idea of a class that melees fairly well but also has good healing abilities. As others have posted, are we just going to merge the paladin and cleric classes? If cleric melee is brought anywhere near paladin melee (by increasing skill caps, for example), then where are paladins left? Our healing is nowhere near that of a cleric (or a druid/shaman if these changes go live).<br />
<br />
This seems to be a clear case of lack of &quot;Vision.&quot; Paladins are supposed to be the ones doing melee and then healing when necessary - is that now also going to be the role of a cleric? If these changes are intended to make people decide they'd like a cleric just as much as a shaman, then the melee ability would have to be awfully good.<br />
<br />
If druids and shaman are encroaching on the healing role of a cleric, then it seems that clerics should be getting more utility abilities (as many others here have mentioned). I don't want my healer engaging in melee instead of watching my health bar, to be honest. The very idea would make me LESS likely to invite a cleric to a group, not more likely. (I also played DAoC for a while and refused to play with a smite cleric unless we aleady had a healing cleric.) Take a look at the DAoC boards to see how most people feel about a cleric who doesn't heal. *shrug*<br />
<br />
Boosting melee ability is not the way to improve soloing ability (melee classes don't solo nearly as well as casters anyway!) nor is it the way to improve desirability in a group. I -really- hope these changes do not go live.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Niin</div><div class="date">08-23-2002, 06:25 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">It's not the bagging of my primary weapon that bugs me.  It's locking EVERY cleric into ONE item if they want to get the benefits of this 'upgrade'.<br />
<br />
It would be much better to make the proc on the hammer instead a buff like Divine Might, that would affect any weapon.  This wouldn't lock clerics into one weapon for their career if they want to be 'balanced'.<br />
<br />
That is just lame.</div></div><hr />

I think that clerics, when forced to solo, will be wishing that they had put AA points into Strength, Regeneration, Spell Casting Fury and other advancements, rather than the alternative PREFERRED AA points towards Mass Group Buff, for example. <br />
<br />
Additionally, we've already posted on our GUILD message board a notice to the effect that clerics will now be bidding on/expecting to get a shot at the following: <br />
<br />
HP/AC Gear <br />
PRIMAL 1hb from Sleeper's Tomb <br />
Haste Items <br />

Time to whip out my 56 Pally and level her up to 60.... no wait... pally's are gimp too. Given the choice of a Pally or an SK in a group that has a Druid healer (with the new spells), most exp groups would pick an SK any day of the week /sigh. <br />

Ok, guess, then I'll be leveling up my 22 druid or my level 5 monk, or my level 5 rogue. <br />

Not sure where I fit in on these proposed changes, but I'm level 60 and like grouping. That is more difficult lately so some solo abilities for short periods of time sound nice. I'd rather group and be the healer though.<br />

Do you assume because I said I was in a small guild and may never see my epic that , that means I will never chose to change that?  You don't know me or anything about me..<br />
<br />
And yes, my opinions do matter..Just as yours (sadly)  and everyone else's do.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Thanks for reading/responding.  Thanks for listening to our wants/needs, and doing something about it.<br />
<br />
I love the cleric class.  I love it the way it is now.  I am a healer, who melee's now.  I dont call myself a battle cleric..but I love the idea of being one.  I am scared to try and solo :)  I've always had the impression that clerics are not solo'ers.  That has been fine with me.   It sounds like I am one of the few that always has a group when I log in.  I don't even have to ask guild to group..hehe.  I have never had the need to solo..if I'm given the...opportunity (not really the word I am looking for here)..I will test it out, play with it, and probably enjoy it.  I love the idea of having options.  One of my group members is a shaman.  It would be really neat, IMO, to make them main healer once in awhile.  Heck yea I'll summon a hammer and a pet and go to town.  Got adds?  I'll take one!  I read the post from the test server cleric that soloed a dog in Chardok..that makes me go &quot;wow&quot;, I want to be able to do that!<br />
<br />
I've seen a lot of posts asking for better heals - we need an upgrade to divine light - is one of the more popular ones.  I've seen a lot of posts asking for better soloing abilities.  Take a look at the new spells again.  New heals (I don't say better since I dont know if they are or not), and new spells that will make soloing more effective.<br />
<br />
In closing -<br />
Thank you.  Thank you for giving us some diversity.  I'm really excited about *all* the &quot;proposed&quot; changes so far :)  Thank you for wading through all this crap:D :p</div></div><hr />

<br />
Adding the druid and shaman spells does nothing to detract from a cleric's grouping capability, just the cleric's relative desirability.<br />
<br />
To balance the effect of those spells, a cleric would need two things:<br />
(1) an increase in utility to increase the desirability to match that of a different healer.<br />
(2) the capability of soloing effectively when grouping is unavailable.<br />
<br />
The Hammer and Yaulp begin to address concern (2).  There still would need to be changes to address (1), as well as (2) for those levels impacted by the addition of the almost-CHeals but not high enough to benefit from these spells.<br />
<br />
And then, after they close this round... Verant needs to reopen melee balancing, since Paladins will need to be retuned... then casters will need to be retuned... then priests... then melees...</div></div><hr />

Because I am a soloing halfling cleric. I get sick of people going around saying &quot;Hey, do you need a group?&quot; when I dont have a tag and am sitting around stunning/nuking/Unswearving/Meleeing my targets. People laugh when they see I have SCHWs (Silver Chitin Handwraps).<br />
<br />
As a cleric I feel we are the most used and abused class in game. I have been stepped on by numerous guilds n such just because of my healing ability and I think its a shame that we absolutely HAVE to follow people (guilds, groups, friends) to get any sort of EXP in the 50+ game... it just sucks.<br />
<br />
At level 54 (the level I am now) I can effeciently solo light and dark blue mobs outside of KC (drovlargs, chickens, giants, spiders) and those of you who say we cant already obviously havent tried or devised better strategies... granted, the process is slow but it can be done. With this I think for those of us who wish to solo like this will and for those of you still yearning to be the healing cleric who says you have to use these new spells?<br />
<br />
I guarantee I will be flamed for this post but its no problem, because I still half agree with our superb healing abilities.<br />
<br />
Along with these new additions in test, I would like to see a self invis, more undead arse whoopin ability (such as an undead only harm-touch variation), and a pet that wont dissappear after the target is dead. Thats all I gotta say... I cant wait to test the hammer out....<br />
<br />
Added to Edit: I havent played EQ in a few months and this is guaranteed to hook me again...</div></div><hr />

I said your opinion of spells you won't be able to get doesn't matter.  If you were going to be able to xp worth a damn at 52 after these patches then of course you would have an opinion that matters.<br />

Reread the post.  You are supporting changes that will keep you under the level needed to cast these spells for a LONG time potentially.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kitsinu</div><div class="date">08-23-2002, 10:56 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yet again, Verant puts in a change to the Cleric class that MUST be nerfed.  Let me explain this :<br />
1. Summon horse<br />
2. cast Yaulp V<br />
3. Do NOT melee<br />
4. wait for Yaulp V to wear off<br />
5. rinse and repeat<br />
<br />
Results :<br />
Normal sitting meditation mana PLUS Yaulp V mana.<br />
<br />
What this means that is that whatever mana regen they put onto Yaulp V will have to be removed because it would make Clerics even more powerful in outdoor zones (horse).  Can you hear a dog somewhere howling in rage?  I can.<br />
<br />
Yaulp V would probably be great for Clerics as it currently stands.  Verant just can't allow that though, Druids would complain.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Borick</div><div class="date">08-23-2002, 11:04 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Simple solution.  If that becomes a problem, set the Yaulp 5 spell so that it will not stack with the horse buff.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kitsinu</div><div class="date">08-23-2002, 11:13 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The horse isn't really necessary, I was working on the assumption that Yaulp V will have a high agro factor like Canibilize spells so you couldn't sit down.  Either way, the Yaulp V would result in Clerics joining Shamans doing their &quot;Cani-Dance&quot; of standing up and casting between mana ticks between fights even indoors.<br />
<br />
Not stack with horses?<br />
Wouldn't that just be appropriate for a class whose hybrid gets an instant casting horse?  Part of why I am pointing this out is because if it doesn't go in right now, it will be nerfed and we will spend literally months waiting for something to take its place as balance.<br />
/sigh</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Zachton</div><div class="date">08-23-2002, 11:20 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm going to go ahead and admit that I've only read about 5 pages its kind of late, but I like the changes, sounds like something diffrent to be able to play with.<br />
<br />
If you are threatened by druids and shaman being able to heal decently I feel sorry for you, we will always be able to own them in that prospect.  Don't worry about it.<br />
<br />
Karn isn't usless, it makes a huge diffrence in long battles, ask a rogue or a tank, they notice it.<br />
<br />
The yaulp 5 thing I basicly see is a form of caniblize or self melee buff like shamen, intresting to see how it will be tweeked though.  Hard to figure out what spells I'd have to demem to go to solo though heh.<br />
<br />
If you don't like meleeing... don't simple as that.  If other clerics decide to do it and benifit from it then great, don't complain that you wern't given the option.  Druids can quad kite, but they don't all like to or want to take the risks, so they don't all do it.  Its the same thing really, risky, with a possible bonus for you.<br />
<br />
Bash good for anyone against casting mobs, specialy when they resist your stuns.  Don't see how effective our bash will be but hey its something, from a role play aspect I've played my cleric long enough, and watched melee do it for enough years to figure out how to smack something with my shield.<br />
<br />
Its an OPTION not something you have to do.  Options are good, lets you play the game diffrently and have fun.<br />
<br />
I'm not threatened by druid and shamen heals, but I like the idea of being able to stand up and do something diffrent if I choose, in places like seb it won't really matter, pets not worth while cause the fights can last anywhere from 30 seconds to half a second, in places like cazic where you may have to fight a mob that keeps managing to ch itself for a good solid 5 minutes or so alows you a lot more versitility.<br />
<br />
Any way remember this is all on test, its not a sure thing any how, I can't wait to see how it pans out though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ancarett</div><div class="date">08-23-2002, 11:21 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I agree that druids and shamans have needed some improvements to their high-end healing ability: not sure that 75% and approx 3k is the best target, but I'm sure this will be tweaked.<br />
<br />
So now druids and shamans might have semi-viable heals for caster classes on raids. Good for them. <br />
<br />
I'm worried more about XP groups. We've said that clerics need to add something of value (BESIDES CH and buffs) to xp groups and that it would be nice to have an idle chance at the occasional solo. But in our wildest dreams, I don't think any of us thought you'd be telling us to pinch-hit as paladins (and if I were a paladin, I'd be a bit miffed at the thought of clerics being billed as the heal/melee class). Ye gads. . . even if my groupmates parsed the data on an amazing proc, do you think they'd want their cleric on the frontlines in melee? We're supposed to melee and do all of our caster-intensive activities? I don't really see how, even with the limited mana benefits of Yaulp V (better hope it doesn't fizzle and that you don't get stunned so that you're regaining some mana while you swing).<br />
<br />
I'd imagined some cool spells that would either allow us to buff something besides HP/AC/resistance (how about a blessing spell that adds ATK/DEX/STA to all groupmembers?) or a creative DoT or a spell that adds a proc to all group members' weapons?<br />
<br />
I'm willing to see where this goes but if the balancing is going to stand upon my cleric becoming a melee class, I think it is flawed from the outset.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Aorion</div><div class="date">08-23-2002, 11:42 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I don't think they are making us a melee class, just allowing us to melee.  Paladins aren't bugged about it because we won't threatn the positions at all.  We won't be hitting like Pallys and we can't take damage like them.  Their only good battle heal is a LOH,  and insta heal we can't touch.  And they rarely use that except in emergencys.  <br />
<br />
As far as grouping goes, the new abiliies wil allow us to do a little extra damage when we're not LOM and medding up.  We no longer have to stop nuking at 80% mana, so that we'll have mana for heals.  One of my pet peeves has been that, even with our other spells no one wanted us to burn mana on them.  So i basically heal/med for 36 levels.  I missed the little tanking and nuking i did for my first 20 levels.  This change might allow us to do that again<br />
<br />
It won't be easy for sure.  We have to learn new ways, and then convince the old guard that the new ways are better than what we've been doing.  But realy, for alot of us that have been complaining about the rut we've been in this might offer us something new.<br />
<br />
I'm still a little worried about the effects on the before 56 Clerics.  They bring up some valid points that I hope VI addresses.  But we have  alot of time to wait before any of this might  go live, so we have to wait and see what they do, and hope for more reports from the Test Clerics.</div></div><hr />

New Melee  Cleric with a poofing pet??? Plus our epic Ragefire Spawn issue...  No thanks...  I would rather be able to quad kite, sow, invis, port, nule and cast comp heal and be able to get my epic which is handed out like candy.<br />
<br />
Would rather have a melee cleric with a pet that poofs and cant get the epic cuz the wait list is a year on ragefire or a druid that can comp heal in your group?<br />
<br />
I am not happy with the changes...  Puts me out of business, as if it were not hard enough to find a group.  Might as well give druids and shamans rez ability too to make up for the loss of clerics your going to have.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Drakkus</div><div class="date">08-24-2002, 02:30 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">All classes need the ability to solo effectively. Soloing does not necessarily equate to melee ability. The hammer/Yaulp5 are interesting diversions to keep Clerics amused but without significant raises to weapon skill caps, damage mitigation etc, it is not a serious ability. Hopefully that is all it was intended to be and soloability will be introduced via a snare spell and some reduction in nuke cast/recast.<br />
<br />
Back in the pre-Kunark days I tried my hand at soloing the undead in Kithicor when I hit L44. Sense the dead for ghetto tracking, pull with a banish, with Jboots run to the HPH zone and wait for the mob, then root/Banish til dead. I was living on the edge, mana pool only just enough to kill mobs assuming they didn't resist and didn't break root too often, it was very slow xp gain but it was different.<br />
More recently I tried (at L57 I think) to solo some blue Giants in BurningWood, basically ran out of mana with the mob at 40percent. Over a few different zone/mob scenarios the main issue is root, it is expensive and breaks often, I found I was using almost 50percent of my mana on root refresh.<br />
Another negative factor for Cleric soloing using root/nuke is the cast/recast time of the spells. DoT/Root may be more effective.<br />
<br />
In order to solo effectively we need Invis, SeeInvis and perhaps some form of snare. <br />
Rangers were de-nerfed when they were given SeeInvis, now is our turn, this old design nerf should be corrected. I resent having to carry around a backpack full of non-stackable 12.5pp invis potions in order to travel around. The mask in VT is adding insult to injury. Please please, invis and see invis. There are a handfull of gainsayers but the majority of Clerics would see this as a significant boost.<br />
<br />
Comments on the proposed heal spells, 1050 was way too high for the groupCE, 975 still needs reducing.<br />
WoR is 1100 mana for groupCH, SingleTargetCH is 400mana.<br />
Using the same ratio for SingleTarget/Group CE, the mana cost would come out at around 825. An average L60 Cleric would still only be able to cast 4 before oom.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Cayleu</div><div class="date">08-24-2002, 03:05 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Heh, if these changes allow me to solo in a depopped plane of hate with only roamers up effectively as has been reported, then I'm pretty dang happy about these changes. Yaulp V also gives us a lot of mana regen to offset what we lose by not medding, and so exp groups will suddenly be fun again, with us meleeing for decent damage, and playing with a useful pet!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sumeine Bertoxx</div><div class="date">08-24-2002, 05:43 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">A long time ago I thought a change was made to make life better for the MAJORITY of the players.<br />
<br />
The partial CH has been added &quot;to relieve clerics of the huge weigth on end raids&quot;. Well in their short sightedness Verant totally forgot that it will also remove the weigth we wanted in order to be wanted in groups.<br />
<br />
How many clerics can join end game raids in ssra or boss raids in NToV? How big is that percentage compared to the total cleric player base?<br />
<br />
All in all you see the MINORITY of clerics doing CH cycles and you (Verant) use THIS minority to bring up a change that will affect ALL clerics, moreso those below lvl 58!<br />
<br />
Verant's well-known short signtedness will now doom the cleric's capability to get groups by giving away the last remaining class defining ability we had: CH. Heals can be handled by others, other classes can rez albeit not as effectively as we can (difference of ONLY 6% though - that's not even 10 min in a good group!). To remedy to our loss of groupability we get &quot;enhanced soloability&quot; by the means of a proccing hammer, a low block bonus on shields other classes wil also get, and through minor useless changes to our pet...our defense and offense caps are to remain the same so whilst we CAN melee we'll need to stun a mob or root it (unless immune to both or immune to magic) in order to heal ourselves about every 20 secs. This would result in less mobs killed for more mana in the same time frame we could root/nuke for XP.<br />
<br />
I have seen high end fights where clerics not in the CH chain were given STAR RUBIES (75pp/cast) to banish repops. I don't see ANY problem in giving the new CHs a 10 to 16pp component cost then, because every guild should gladly want to donate the cash in order to get this uber weapon by using shamen and druids in CH chains. however a 10 to 16pp component would make using the CHs in a group marginal and wouldn't threaten our role in groups - healing. Somehow, somewhere though I get the feeling that Verant won't do anything of the likes...and not even the gods know why.<br />

As far as this game has gotten it has done very well at increasing the raid zones as one gets better equipped but not the exp zones.  This is my first time posting as a cleric here and well I'm damn happy the way I am. To me these changes will just be more toys. As long as they add more zones with the desirablity of CT and the same and increased strength I'm sure the changes to druids and shamans will not affect me much being a well equipped and well played lvl 60 cleric. The only way it will affect me if they don't put these zones in.<br />
<br />
I do believe that druid healing needs a huge bump, but not necisarily the shamans. Tropors even i though its tough to find is one niffty little spell even though it has its drawbacks. AL (Afterlife) even proved this by killing Twarro and his spirit in the ice caves in UP with just a war, monk, and shaman. <br />
<br />
When it comes to raid time shamans are generally too busy with buffs, malo, slow, and disease to do too much spot healing. Thus leaving the druids to do that with some pretty ****ty proxie spells of DL and remedy. Pretty darn tough to spot heal a tank on the rampage list with it unless your busting with clerics or have a butt ton of druids. So this heal would be an awsome spell to have for any guild.  Also great for when you have to do hate , fear, chardok, ect. for epic pieces too will give you more than plenty of capable healer for a well equiped guild to hit more than one at the same time.<br />
<br />
Now when it comes to clerics having problems finding a group because of this new spell, I don't think giving us more spells is the real solution. Giving us more melee is not a solution either. The solution lies in having more prophetable stronger dungeons.<br />
<br />
I remember my first group in seb a long time ago when having such equipment and lvl's there was a rarity.  That place kept me on my toes constantly healing and darn that was fun. Now that the equipment of me and the people on the server around me has gone up by leaps and bounds that place is a total joke. More of a farming exp, some ok twink items to sell, and farming of vendor fodder spells is what goes on here. This is where the cleric will get get pushed out of, old outdated zones with this spell to the druids.  And any fun loving druid would agree that its boaring.<br />
<br />
As long as a good abundant amount of stronger well prophetable exp zones gets added in PoP these spells will just be a few toys to play with and just that. That way the higher lvl people can move away from the woren out exp zones of seb ect. and onto the bigger better zones leaving them more open to the newer not so well equiped people to enjoy with little worries of their class becoming obsolete.<br />
<br />
If you guys at vi want to make these spells feel free to. I'd love playing with them when i feel like farting around. But these sure as hell beter not be the solution to keeping clerics viable. The only thing that will keep us viable as peoples equipment around us just keep getting better is tougher zones with prophetability. After you fix the druids why don't you spend more time making zones that will keep clerics viable in single groups.<br />

None of the clerics I know, and this are a lot, would create a cleric to melee for exp or items...<br />
Clerics should never be wizards or necros.<br />
Clerics need quick casting heals with the best lifebringing ./. manasink ratio in the game, because this is clerics work. No one would need to med while standig, if this ratio would be better. But it isnt. And this is the point. We clerics should be able to cast heals long after another healer class runs out of mana for healing to much and to ften.<br />
Beside this, Clerics should be the class with the second best damage-spells against undead mobs after the wizard-class. The damage ./. mana-ratio should be much better, than it is now.<br />
<br />
Another thought to this: Policeofficers loads gun with normal ammo, fires at a robber an strucks him down. After that, the officer fire at a ghost. Ghost yawns and eats the officer. - But ghostbuster loads silverbullet-amo, fire at the robber and strucks him down. Also struck down the ghost -or at least hurts the ghost very much.<br />
<br />
This means: Clerics should need significant lesser mana to damage undead than all other classes except the necros maybe. And the damage should be much higher than it is now.<br />
<br />
Clerics need a doable epic to. The last change at this quest was an uppercut for all brave holy people, VI. And who says, more epics will make the game to easy? <br />
1.  It is now hard enough (for your clerics at least)<br />
2.  If you think, it will be to easy after a better solution to this epic, feel free to make the game harder at others places, VI!<br />

After 3 years of everquest, I retired in may 2002. I was  sick from sitting, meding and clicking this hot button to run that stupid makro in the ch-chain all the times. Never saw lots of the boss-mobs in action, because I stood together with the other clerics round the corner to avoid the aes.<br />

I DO feel for those of you over 50 who NEVER meleed.  While you obviously can continue that way, if  you DO want to play with the new toys it will take a lot of time to do you any good.<br />

Serenya won't use them much as her group stands, she doesn't have a back up healer and her tank is a wood elf, so she is very much a traditional med/heal cleric.  Velma is drooling; her group is twinked and she already splits healing duties with a druid.  She is vry much a battle cleric and is looking forward to that new hammer.  Either way, it's nice to have options.   <br />

I do agree that this doesn't give a must-have factor to groups, so I am just waiting to see what else is being changed.  I'd like group-only damage add or damage mitigation buffs (Bless anyone?) myself.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lyph</div><div class="date">08-24-2002, 09:14 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">What I see with those new changes is that I could be able to log in my cleric 1 hour in FG or another easy xp place, without having to lose the time it takes to find/form a group etc, and do some &quot;efficient&quot; killings instead of logging my SK or dual boxing for short play sessions. I say efficient because I use to do sometimes some solo in ME or grey, but just for fun because exp gain rate is not worth it.<br />
<br />
If those changes add this possibility to my cleric, then I am happy to get this option, most of you forgot that we were able to log for a short time and do some solo exp trough levels 1 to 30, and finding that back again at level 60 will be a pleasure. :)<br />
<br />
Fun!<br />
<br />
In raids I don't really need more roles, I am able to heal what is needed, I guess I do that job well and don't want more, and getting some more help from druids in that area is most welcome, but I am in a guild with few clerics... ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Velisaris</div><div class="date">08-24-2002, 09:43 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok, 2 quick comments.<br />
<br />
If you are threatened by druids and shaman being able to heal decently I feel sorry for you, we will always be able to own them in that prospect. Don't worry about it.  <br />
<br />
If you're talking strictly numbers, yes we still out-heal druids/shamans...our spells are more efficient and specialized.  No one is arguing about the numbers, per se.<br />
<br />
What we are discussing is the perception of OTHER classes in exp groups.  To them, with these new druid/shaman heals, druids = shaman = clerics as far as healing abilities go.  Why on earth would an average exp group pick a cleric to heal, when they can have a shaman to buff stats, slow the mobs, regen them, sow them, AND heal.  Or why take a cleric who can heal, when you can take a druid who can buff, sow, lev, invis, port your butt around if the pickings in your current exp spot get slim, evac you if things get rough, AND heal.  That's what we're talking about...the perception of other classes that clerics no longer are superior in healing to the other priest classes and cannot offer as much to a group as druids/shaman...thus, more clerics sitting at the zoneline shouting &quot;LFG&quot; for much longer periods.<br />
<br />
<br />
Secondly, I think I speak for a lot of other clerics in the mid-50s range when I say that I really don't care about the opinions of lvl 60 clerics.  These changes most likely won't have any impact on you either way.  You've made it...you're at the top...you've got the epic...you've got the full suit of Shyshrine armor...you've got double digit AA points, most likely MGB or will get it very soon.  Finding an exp group for you doesn't have the same weight it does for the rest of us.  So please, keep your &quot;you're overreacting&quot; comments to yourselves...if you were still lvl 55, having to fight druids and shamans for exp groups, you'd feel the same way I do.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Axemaster</div><div class="date">08-24-2002, 09:52 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Increase the level of variety and interest involved in playing a cleric <br />
<br />
*** sounds good ***<br />
<br />
<br />
The first part of the change was to add the following spells:<br />
<br />
Hammer of Judgement - CLR/56 (summon a hammer with a powerful and frequent proc effect) <br />
<br />
*** mmmm and this is going to mean I cant weild Blackstar? My 20/25 Str15 Sta25 Wis20 Hp100 Mana100 +15 all saves 105 hp group heal proc? Isnt Blackstar supposed to be the help I need in combat?<br />
<br />
Make this into an EFFECT that I can place on my own weapon (the proc that is) and we might have something (much like the Paladin undead spell)<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Yaulp V - CLR/56 (self only melee and mana regen buff. Adds haste, dexterity, mana regen, and stamina regen) <br />
<br />
*** and this is going to stack with BAOR right? Right? Because currently anything over Yaulp 2 doesnt***<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
These spells are useful in allowing the cleric to do a new form of combat damage. Clerics use the new Yaulp spell to gain melee haste, standing mana regeneration, and increased Dexterity. This helps out a great deal by allowing the cleric to use their new summoned hammer at peak efficiency. <br />
<br />
*** this Yaulp Haste will stack with items im assuming, and also chanter or shaman haste?***<br />
<br />
Using Yaulp + the Hammer of Judgement, the cleric begins to be effective in toe-to-toe combat. Other supporting spells available to the cleric are his low cost summoned pet, and the Mark of Retribution/Mark of Karn spells. Using a combination of these spells, along with the clerics excellent buffs give surprisingly good results. In testing, clerics have been effective soloing the entrance to Charasis and Chardok, grouping in a number of high end dungeons, and even making reasonable experience as a two-cleric duo in Cazic-Thule. <br />
<br />
*** As a clerics main avenue of damage spells are undead, I decided to try to take on a skeletal drudge last night in ME. Result of combat: I was at 20 mana, 30 life, skeleton was at 50 life. I tried to root dot and med, but my root only held once for any length of time, and was resisted about 8 times to the 3 or 4 it held. In the end I had to zone when I got an add.<br />
The issues I had with this combat:<br />
1. Mob hit very hard, fast<br />
2. Mob resisted root lots<br />
3. Lot of interrupts esp when trying to root it again, or heal myself so I could be alive to try to root it.<br />
4. Epitah wore off very quickly - I had to stay very close to the mob - which meant that when root broke I didnt really have time to cast root again.<br />
<br />
I can only think of 2 zones on Luclin where there are undead who will give a cleric XP on their own. ME and Grey. The grey is impossible to solo now due to so many live creatures and those annoying traps everywhere. ME is a solo haven for druids and wizards and has what looks to be a good source of dark blue xp undead. This was just a test, and I will go back and try some more to try some different spell types, and techniques.<br />
******<br />
<br />
<br />
In addition to the added spells, we'll be trying out the Bash skill for Clerics, beginning at level 25. While this skill will cap out lower than their melee counterparts, clerics should still get a decent amount of value out of this addition. It adds a bit of damage as well as a free chance to stun opponents. This also works well with the recent improvements to shields on Test, that give a meaningful boost to armor class, in addition to a chance to block incoming blows. <br />
<br />
*** not a bad idea, and one clerics have asked for for 2 years or more, personally Id rather have a couple spells the would help with combat more as most things Im gonna go toe-to-toe with at my level (60) are gonna kick my ass with their damage outlay***<br />
<br />
<br />
The following heal spells were added to the cleric class:<br />
Ethereal Elixir - CLR/60 (group version of the Celestial Elixir heal-over-time spell) <br />
Ethereal Light - CLR/58 (upgraded version of Divine Light single target heal) <br />
Ethereal Remedy - CLR/59 (upgraded version of Remedy single target heal) <br />
<br />
*** we only have 8 spell slots. Eight. I already have this set up on most raids and groups:<br />
Divine Light<br />
Celestial Healing<br />
Complete Healing<br />
Divine Aura<br />
MOK<br />
MOR<br />
Judgement<br />
Root<br />
<br />
I guess I could replace Divine Light with the new one...but Im going to have to lose some of my group useful spells to use any of these new heals...which reduces my group role and puts me back to medic only - I see using these new heals only in Raid encounters...<br />
***<br />
<br />
<br />
so to sumarize:<br />
1. Make the &quot;summoned hammer&quot; an effect to put on your weapon, like that undead Pally spell<br />
2. Give clerics an undead snare, or<br />
3. Reduce the resists or make root more effective for a cleric<br />
4. Possible a Fear/Atone over time spell. So you can fear off adds who forget who you are when the fear wears off and dont come back with 10 buddies.<br />
<br />
<br />
An interesting way to go....just needs tweaking....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">BillyCleric</div><div class="date">08-24-2002, 10:05 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">What good is a melee weapons for clerics when they're just going to sit and med? Sure, if there are 2 clerics in a group and one is already FM and is backup healer, then he can melee, but in your normal group a cleric is not going to stand up and go toe to toe with any mobs to add extra dmg, they're going to be sitting the entire time. A solution to this would be to remove the med ability from clerics and have them med while standing or sitting. Other wise you're going to need to come up with a way that a sitting cleric can be useful to a group. Maybe allow them to cast spells while sitting.</div></div><hr />

<br />
After trying out several solo spots including Velks, Lguk, Chardok, The Grey, Seb and a few others I forget atm, I'm hard-pressed to figure out how this hammer (which might be replacing an epic in some cases.  Dawnfire in my case), combined with a new Yalup V, is going to make soloing much easier.  As a cleric in full SS armor, it takes me nearly a full bar of mana to solo a blue anywhere.  I can't stand toe-to-toe with it because I lose almost all my hp within one minute of physical contact, even with all my personal buffs.  Ever try to take on a single green mob in Velious or Luclin with a solo cleric?  Without root or a full bar of mana, it's not an easy task.  <br />
<br />
I certainly hope that if we are going to be considered an equal to xp groups and raids to druids and shaman that we will be considered equal in soloability as well.  The test cases that you cited are no different from my personal results, but you neglect to address the efficiency of the downtime involved.  Both of the other priest classes have the ability to shorten this downtime considerably.<br />
<br />
I for one am certainly disappointed with the idea that you wish to give the other priest classes equal footing in groups.  I didn't play my cleric as my main for two years only to find out that I could now solo.  I don't remember that being a very high demand, either, from the cleric community.<br />
<br />
We priest classes are usually only allowed one spot in any xp group.  I guess now my main will become the bot and I'll be levelling a class that can have the opportunity to get a group without having to beg for one for an hour at the zone in, only to find out that a druid or shaman beat me to the groups and then have to travel for another half hour to another area without invis, hopefully not dying. =/</div></div><hr />

Bats are much easier than the drudges in ME, the vamps are nearly impossible, root wont hold on them and they hit like a tank.<br />
<br />
But the bats arnt' that hard.... so rotating dots roots I was able to solo 3 at once... keep in mind that I'm 60 and decently equiped, having the FT3 boots and the earing of solstice as well as 30 or so aa points.<br />
<br />
Generaly in groups if I'm running low on mana stuff has gone seriously wrong, I oftentimes have quite a lot of mana for lack of things to do.  Mark and MoR all the mobs nuke every once and a while, judgemnt only takes 8% mana, with kei BaoTR and FT items doesn't take long to get that back, I often melee with my sprinkler just to alieve bordom.<br />
<br />
If the tank goes linkdead sometimes the cleric is the best 2ndary tank in the group, generaly we can hold agro over rogues and rangers if we chain stun... paladins can out do us on it though, the new changes will make it much easier to retain that agro if we wish.<br />

I think too many of you are putting too much drama into this.<br />
<br />
1. I for one will be happy that the Shammy and Druids can be expected  to heal for a change instead of them getting mad that I am not healing them while they are either overnuking, or converting HP to Mana, and killing all my mana in the meantime.<br />
<br />
2. I know alot of clerics are well lazy. They sit around and well heal. If sitting and healing is something you like, that will not change. We are / will still will be the best healers of any other class. We still have the best res too. <br />
<br />
<br />
3. This is not even live yet, if you are on the test server and have tried all these new options out, then you many start the stonning,<br />
These many not ever leave test in the current form. It also states they are gonna do MORE!, this is not it, it is not over, heck it has barely even started, give them a chance.<br />
<br />
4. I personally wish to thank VI for trying to put clerics back where they should be, In EQ most clerics sit around and just heal, most other games I have &quot;Battle Clerics&quot; that exist and do very well. If I am fm I am behind the mob beating for around 50 dmg a swing atleast I am being productive.<br />

The new hammer tends to proc often from the logs I've seen, and the sucker is FAST.  An 18 delay weapon with the Yaulp v goes down to something like 13.5 delay... add another haste item... could prolly hit some haste caps.<br />

<br />
1.  Nope I don't have the full suit of Skyshrine-- I'm still running around in Pants from Hate.<br />
<br />
2.  Finding exp groups is hard as heck... why?  High end guilds over-recruit clerics to the extent that finding exp groups within our OWN guild (always preferable) is very very difficult, unless you happen to log on at the right time.  Yep, the high number of clerics is GOOD for raids, but truly sucks for day to day exp grouping.<br />
<br />
3.  I'm way down on the food chain as far as AA points go.  IF I can get groups and get more AA points, will I &quot;waste&quot; them in MGB?  Heck no.  Those points are going into Spell casting fury.<br />
<br />
4.  I'm number 52 on our Ragefire rotation list atm.  Doesn't look as if I'll be getting epic until sometime next year, unless some UBER_GUILD_01 decides to break the rotation, as they just did with VS and Trakanon on my server.<br />

Sorry but, &quot;we really think the game needs another melee class,&quot; isn't a good enough excuse to take away our role as primary healers in XP groups, give us no additional utility, and then fix us up so we cn solo nearly as well as a paladin...the paladin of 6 months ago before the 2hs patch and IoN went into the game.<br />

<br />
Dalur ; How is completely removing the neccesity ever for a cleric -- and doing it so much that it will be detrimental -- to be grouped 'beneficial for the masses'?<br />
<br />
As it is, a druid and shaman working well together, can keep 4 melee healed well enough to kill well. Add this, and they will simply shred through content with new DOT stacking / added mana to buff / etc / etc / etc, and they'll be able to do it anywhere.<br />
<br />
The DPS will be so significant that replacing either one with a cleric, will be pointless. Groups will know this. Those who want to go withtout slow, WILL be able too, and make a 5 man + 1 druid team, and those 5 people won't be clerics.<br />
<br />
I only hope that if the majority of posters who fear this scenario take you up on your latter suggestion, and thousands of accounts get cancelled. I bet for once, they'd finally listen.<br />
<br />
The solution isn't salvaging one class (us clerics) for another for everything but raids.</div></div><hr />

You do realize you dont HAVE to use those spells... and we still got the bonuses and uber high heals (Critical Complete Heals reach up to 21khp+ Ive seen). I think we have nothin to fear from the other priest classes healing wise.... except for druids... how I hate druids with a passions :) (buncha no-good wanna-be every class in the game)<br />
<br />
Honestly though... now that I think about it more they should leave HEALING how it is (the spells we got already are already pretty freakin strong) and just give us this melee opprotunity... that would allow us to do all the combating that druids (kiting) and shamans (pet/debuff/slow ect) can do... I'll gladly take that hammer and yaulp (even for just medding) and go kick some arse... <br />

<br />
Effect Dawncall :cool: <br />
<br />
Now that said why on earth would I want to bag this weapon for a summoned hammer with a reduced attack/delay mana &amp; hp ratio?  Also meele on a cleric is just plain UBER awful.  I can hit well into the 70's when I hit.  Thats the key, I miss alot at max skill and I am slower than sin even with VoG.<br />
<br />
I like the idea of going back to old school where clerics can meele but do it so it is realistic.  I take huge damage when I meele anything from light blue to dark blue and even some green mobs.<br />
<br />
3553HP and 1088 AC Buffed.  Most of the time if I play Mr. Meele I get 2 hits in before I have to heal, then 2 more hits and heal.  Why go through all this greif when I can just root a mob then nuke or if Undead right click my weapon and dot them to death?<br />
<br />
Making a proc buff would be better but would still not adress the issue of damage that we take.  There is no point in being a Battle cleric if the only time you can really be a battle cleric is will Arch AA points.  <br />
<br />
By the time a cleric goes through all the hassles of getting that many AA points for better hp and reduced dmg it would be worthless.  Things like mass group buff, Bestow DA, Crit heal 3 SCR and healing Adept are alot more practical, not to mention desired more in raids.<br />
<br />
What I see happening is several chain effects.  The Cleric solo ability will remain sub part to a total waste of time while people will pref to use a druid / shaman combo for reg exp groups in most zones VS a Cleric / Druid or Cleric / Shaman.  Hell I would.<br />
<br />
I have heard people say well because of the higher HP on the servers CH is still practical.  Not true for most exp zones.  With Slows, Haste (Ever increasing with the mass #'s of haste items reaching upto 41% out there), mana regen and the overall DPS increases, Cleric CH is not important at all.<br />
<br />
I can sit in Seb, Chardok, Akheva, Acrylia, The Deep, etc and just heal with elixer on MT between nuking Judgement 3 or 4 times.  If I do CH it is just because I am being lazy or doing it for novelty. <br />
<br />
The over all abilities a shaman and a druid can bring FAR outweigh what a cleric can in an exp group.<br />
<br />
As for buffs, Aego is nice but when you can PotG, RotG, Khura's Focus, Brute, and the endless other buffs both classes can cast one buff just can't compare.<br />
<br />
Druid, shaman healing is a very awsome thing for everyone when its for raids.  I do not see this affecting a cleric's shot at raiding.  But for grouping this will be uber awful unless VI pulls a few more tricks out of the bag.<br />
<br />
Group CE = AWSOME!  This is the one spell of them all that I really wanted to see.  Cast this bad boy before the meele rush in to an ae mob and watch it work :).<br />

After spending a couple hours going through the posts here and on EQ Druids I've come to a couple understandings. No matter what changes they make, you can't please everyone and there are going to be tons of people moaning about what they would of done better. For those that think even with the new spells Druids/Shamans will replace Clerics seriously need to take a step back and look at reality.<br />
<br />
I never have a problem soloing when I want (Unrest, Kith, ToFS, CoM, Feerot) there are tons of undead for me to fight there and other places. With my Tunare necklace of grasping roots, I can root and dot 4 mobs easily and sit and med. Typically as long as I don't blast my root holds if more than 2 break I have my high level root up because of the fast cast time. Pull back and med. For those that say they can't solo need to look at different strategies. Sure melee proc will be nice, so at least while its beating on me I can do a little damage before its rooted. Yaulp V, I probably won't use for the haste but casting it and then medding. Gee more mana regen for me even if it only lasts for a short time, its better than nothing. <br />
<br />
I never have a problem a finding a group. When I first log in I have people sending me tells across 3 zones asking if I'm looking for a group. My wife plays a 52 Druid and when she's with me I always find a group. Even when I play by myself I always find a group. When I can't I make one, there are 10 melee's for almost every 1 cleric. Sure sometimes I've spent 30 mins trying to find a group but its not because I've been replaced.<br />
<br />
Here is the reason why you see a lot of groups with a shaman/druid or a druid/druid instead of a cleric. Well there are more shamans/druids usually than clerics. You have a group of melee's sitting around doing nothing, waiting for 15 mins so they can actually do some fight and they see someone shouting LFG. They are impatient, want exp and tell them to come join them. 15 mins later a cleric zones in LFG but none are available. He wasn't replaced because they have better heals, he was replaced because the others were convenient. Another 15 mins boom cleric has a group. Who do you think will get more exp, cleric or druid? Cleric! I'd like to see any shaman/druid with melee's outpull my group. I'm sorry with buffs, slows, dots, snares they will be OOM pretty quick if they chain pull. If they pull single slow enough they can keep pace. But my groups have a bard/chanter so we can pull 1-3 mobs while they fight their one.<br />
<br />
They aren't getting a CH, their heals still don't heal as well as me. Half the time in good groups I don't even need CH unless on a raid. I use Celest Heal and med, usually keep everyone 100% health and still have full mana for that bad pull.<br />
<br />
It isn't about making druids/shamans replace clerics, it isn't about making clerics become melee's. Hate to tell you it but for the same reason a cleric will never replace a warrior, monk, rogue, sk, pal is similar to the reasons why druids, shamans will never replace clerics. All classes are valuable its all about taking the options before you and using them wisely. This allows those 3 groups of people sitting waiting for a cleric because most of them are in groups already to at least get exp and do something because they finally have someone who can at least keep them patched up better.<br />
<br />
Grouping with my wife I can tell you I'm usually at 80-FM unless we get bad or multiple pulls. She on the other hand her druid usually operates at 40m and thats if she is only doing snares, dots, buffs, ds and meds. Then you add she can heal, even with a real CH she'd be OOM in a few pulls. Ever see how often mobs agro on her more than me and thats even when I cast CH I get less agro, so she can't sit and med. I repeat it will never happen a druid/shaman can not replace a Cleric. Possibly two might be able to do a capable job but the group with the cleric will still outpull them. Having a druid/shaman in the group now with those new heals helps me even more because we can handle more mobs. When we get those bad pulls and I end up OOM, they don't have to stop the druid/shaman can really be backup healer and I can med. Instead of their Sup heal which barely heals a bubble of health on a tank.<br />
<br />
I don't know what zones or servers the clerics who say they have trouble finding groups or soloing now are on. But on mine I can do both quite well. You all have to understand too, this is a multiplayer game and groups aren't made up of NPC players that they have instant made groups waiting for them. Instead they have PC groups sometimes they have to look, sometimes a slot is open for them. Just be patient, its impatience that gets you killed and not in groups. Its hard for me sometimes because I only get a couple hours a night, except on weekends, but I get more exp if I wait that 30 mins to get in a good balanced group, then if I picked up all LFG and made a hobpog group that could handle less. Also the clerics that demand all the loot, that just might be a reason why its hard to find a group as well. <br />
<br />
A Druid/Shaman will NEVER replace a Cleric, even on raids. A group of Druids/Shaman's chain casting their version of CH on MT will not be able to keep a MT alive longer than a group of Clerics chain casting CH. Not to mention we will never get replaced because we rezz. If your in a tough dungeon then we always get grouped because of that alone.<br />
<br />
The new spells are fine the way they are. I'd have to see them more to fully see how they work but as they are written now, I don't see a problem with it. No I don't want SoW or other Druid/Shaman spells, if I wanted them I would of played one of them. We Rezz, Druids Port, Shamans Slow/Haste. No class will replace one another unless they start giving everyone the exact same spells. So everyone just wait, watch, be patient and let things happen as they will. You won't lose your importance in the game.</div></div><hr />

Taking too long on stuff that needs to be done.  Making it too obvious to me that a cleric will only be needed for CH chain, rez, and aego in the high end game after this patch.  No cleric duo, trio, ect will ever be the same as any other class in pairs.  <br />
<br />
The Yaulp line + standing and meleeing change is just too funny, regening only 25% of the mana we would when sitting, and doing the damage a level 2 warrior would with that summoned hammer.  <br />
<br />
The Shaman in a group already surpasses the cleric.  I have been in groups where i haven't had to heal ever.  The shaman just Torpored everyone who was loosing health after 75% slowing every mob.  Now giving him a bigger heal is going to be balancing for the cleric?  Shaman can Mana free DoT, Mana free nuke, they can solo better than almost any other class.<br />
<br />
I don't disagree with the druid getting 3k CH or 75% CH whatever comes first.  Druids lets face it have never been in groups really.  Its time they got a class balancing upgrade.<br />
<br />
But making a cleric 75% LESS effective while meleeing is not the answer to making a balanced class. Try opening your eyes to the future of what this will cause.  Your class will never change you still won't solo you will still be group dependant.  But now groups won't need you as much.  <br />
<br />
The reason i say you can't solo as well is you have to use a hammer with HORRIBLE dmg/dly on it.  YOu regen mana 25% of what you could sitting.  Your nukes are the same and the pet still does i think it was parsed at 8 dmg  a sec....Not a big bunch of difference.  You will still be root / nuking...but now when the mob runs away you can not cast a spell to finish him...you will go and melee.   Otherwise i never see a cleric wanting to tank an unslowed mob.  What would be the point our dodge skill is so low we would get owned. <br />
<br />
So WTS 60 cleric.  I never see them making this class enjoyable with any patches.  Nor will i wait till the price of my cleric become worth that of a level 30 shaman.  Lets face it Verant does hate clerics.  Its always been apparent.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Oh, and if we are going to be so heavily dependant on Yaulp5, better make sure it STACKS WITH BLESSED ARMOR OF THE RISEN.<br />
<br />
Otherwise, we aren't getting much of a benefit from that mana regen, are we? The spell itself costs 25 mana to cast. In 4 ticks we gain 40 mana from it. That leaves 15 mana after costs are covered... If BAoTR doesn't stack, we are in negative already.<br />
<br />
Just from the self buff, we would have gotten 24 in the same time period.<br />
<br />
Not to mention, while standing, meditation is not in effect... Which makes this not very productive.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Wayen</div><div class="date">08-24-2002, 02:42 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Level 60 druid here, with level 50+ characters (warrior, cleric, bard and rogue).<br />
<br />
First, as a druid I view this spell as nearly useless on raids.  The cast time is too long to effectively keep casters and low HP meleers alive on AE mobs, and won't keep the MT alive while the CHeal rotation is kicking in.  Verant can keep this spell if they make Nature's Touch more mana efficient (lower the mana used by 25-50 points) and faster casting (shave off 1.0 sec).  The only real use of this spell that I can forsee is healing the puller that got beat up a little before he runs back out to pull while the cleric meds.<br />
<br />
Second, I think this spell will help many of those times that a group can't find a cleric.  With 5 of my 6 level 50 or higher characters, I have lost count how many times we couldn't find a cleric to start a group in a decent location or when a group broke up since the cleric left.  Don't take this the wrong way, but many clerics don't have an idea on the hunting limitations put on a group without a cleric.  Granted it usually ended up with me logging one character to play the cleric and then we picked up someone else.<br />
<br />
Thirdly (is that a word?), if this lets druids become a main healer in decent exp locations, then don't think the druid would bring more to the group than healing and snare.  Without aggro control or better armor/skills, doing much more than that would be deadly.  Plus, druid heal+buffs vs cleric heal+buffs, the mana usage of the druid heal would add up quick when compared to a cleric.  Most groups would realize that they are more effective with a cleric than without.<br />
<br />
Now on to what clerics need...<br />
<br />
1.  They need to be the master of undead destruction.  IMHO, they should even outclass wizards in terms of destruction of undead.<br />
<br />
2.  Clerics need more vs. undead spells.  Even some debuffs that lower AC and attack of  the undead would be helpful.  I even like the undead slow.  Undead harmony would be neat.<br />
<br />
3.  More undead only zones to perhaps utilize/justify a druid as the healer and the cleric as an effective nuker/utility.<br />
<br />
4.  More CT-ish zones where supreme healing is the difference between struggling to succeed and cruise control.<br />
<br />
5.  If the cleric melee changes go live, a couple things should change.  The yaulp V spell should have a component that makes the cleric mana regen while yaulp is up equal the mana regen of sitting.  Make it last a few mins with a bit longer recast.  This way a cleric could contribute some damage (thourgh melee) without expending mana (through DDs) while regaining mana at the sitting rate (group members not complaining about mana regen).<br />
<br />
To comment on some suggestions by others...<br />
<br />
1.  Clerics should not get a form of snare.  In many locations, snare is the &quot;in&quot; to a group.  Allowing a cleric with superior healing abilities, rez, buffs to take over the &quot;in&quot; role of an sk, necro, ranger, or druid might be pushing it.<br />
<br />
Before anyone jumps up and complains that druids may get a form of healing that was the cleric's &quot;in&quot;, I couple this with item #4 above.<br />
<br />
2.  Cleric soloing is a tough one.  Perhaps more of an option with #3 above.<br />
<br />
All in all, I feel the greatest thing hurting clerics right now is the state of the game.  The lack of locations that require superior healing is slowly dwindling as the player base is outclassing the mobs.  I can only hope that PoP will solve this.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Segismundo</div><div class="date">08-24-2002, 03:31 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">&quot;1. They need to be the master of undead destruction. IMHO, they should even outclass wizards in terms of destruction of undead&quot;<br />
<br />
Huh... no. Druid/shaman large heals replace clerics anywhere. Undead only spells however, ghetto clerics on the small undead spots (which btw they are just a few and several other classes predate these).<br />
<br />
Would you feel 'balanced' if your new CH would only heal dmg inflicted by plant types of monsters? So stop trying to create cleric ghetto's, thanks.<br />
<br />
&quot;as a druid I view this spell as nearly useless on raids. The cast time is too long to effectively keep casters and low HP meleers alive on AE mobs, and won't keep the MT alive while the CHeal rotation is kicking in&quot;<br />
<br />
Yes it will keep the MT alive, and it could even be used to make an all druid ch line. On slowable mobs with properly timed CH lines druids should have NP. On non slowable, it depends on which mob and what kind of tanks you have. It will do the trick for AoE healing as well unless you are fighting a monster that fires aoes very often / heavy dmg.<br />
<br />
&quot;but many clerics don't have an idea on the hunting limitations put on a group without a cleric&quot;<br />
<br />
That actually depends on group level. On the 60 game clerics are not needed anymore for good xp, nor are big groups. Small no downtime versatile groups = where the good xp is. On the lower 50's it might be an issue given that theres a lot of people using still rygorr or equivalent and low profile weapons. Still, in these situations a shaman+druid combo can handle things fine.<br />
<br />
&quot;then don't think the druid would bring more to the group than healing and snare&quot;<br />
<br />
Yes it would. XP mobs dmg output is not that high and a 3k heal is very efficient. FYI at mid 50's to high 50's (depends on gear as well) most ch's land for 3k'ish so you would function almost as efficient as a cleric.<br />
<br />
&quot;druid heal+buffs vs cleric heal+buffs&quot;<br />
<br />
Cleric buff = ac, hp (and hp are irrelevant if cleric ch is not being used). However druid buffs add ATK (faster kill rate), passive no agro dmg (DS - ok this one is a manahog unless some kind of buff focus/aa is available), and manaregen (if pog/potc available). Druid buffs &gt; cleric buffs for xp'ing.<br />
<br />
&quot;Clerics should not get a form of snare. In many locations, snare is the &quot;in&quot; to a group&quot;<br />
<br />
Hellooo heals are the only way of getting in a group clerics have. Druids (because they were unable to be viable healers for quite some time) got already a set of tools to get in a group. Now you dont want us to get ONE of your group 'in', but are happy to take the ONLY 'in' a cleric has (rez is mostly irrelevant unless ya heading to a totally deserted, out of the way zone).<br />
<br />
&quot;More CT-ish zones where supreme healing is the difference between struggling to succeed and cruise control&quot;<br />
<br />
Once new dru/sham CH it would take a zone with mobs hitting way harder than ct or aoe dmg on the regular xp zones to have to take a cleric over a druid.</div></div><hr />

<br />
/shrug, my cleric is as good as retired, necro is more fun anyways, can't get a group? So i'll solo and actually be effective at doing it...heck I can even melee for a lil bit with a mob snared/feared and not having to fear bad retalliation if fear breaks...<br />
<br />
Verant...add a component cost to the shaman and druid CHs, they'd be used for raids only if they cost 10pp per cast. And you'll need to beef up our clerical unbreakable faith by really fixing us...since you've managed to break the faith of something around 70% of all clerics.<br />

It is hard enough to find a group as the main healer.  Groups only want ONE cleric.  Now they give two classes with cake epics and the ability to be main healer for ANY exp group.  WAKE UP they know they are screwing you that is why they are giving you solo ability.  Some of you mention that you have no problems soloing.  GREAT who cares.  A clerics main strength is his/her ability to get a group.  That is now being taken away.  Remember all those druids out there that play the class because it is so EASY.  Well they are now better than you are at your job.  A clerics job is not healing its keeping the group alive.  When was the last time you CHed an enchanter?  Now this druid can DS the main tank killing the mob faster.  Dot the mob killing the mob faster.  Heal the main tank to keep the group going.  A group with a druid or a shaman in your place will kill mobs faster, get more experience faster, and get to keep all the gems for themselves.  Clerics will be put with necros and beastlords except they will not be able to handle the mobs those classes can fight.  While they are fighting anything we will be trying to share the undead mobs out there.  Don't agree and let your place be taken by two of the most overpowered cake classes in the game.  Sorta funny listening to the 60 clerics say how easy it is for them to solo those weak as mobs in SPECIFIC spots and how awesome they are.  I see 60 shaman cut through chardock and other areas.  Now we as they put it CAN EVEN SOLO A DOG IN CHARDOCK.  One dog woopie I see shaman root dot the dogs and work on the sarnacks because the dogs are a distraction. :mad:  Yes everyone please settle on the changes Verant can make the cleric the next great solo class unless there is a raid.</div></div><hr />

-Perplex<br />
<br />
I hadn't seen the numbers on the Yaulp V spell when I posted that this spell was nerf bait.  Now that I have seen it, I realize that it doesn't need to be nerfed.  After mana costs, Yaulp V is equivalent to Flowing Thought 3.75 if you are willing to keep pounding away at the spell every 24~ seconds.  No need to nerf that at all, it comes pre-nerfed.  And this is assuming that the spell stacks with all other mana regen buffs and doesn't give too much agro when cast.  Way to go Verant on making sure this spell wasn't too powerful.  My abject apologies for having thought you were giving us something powerful enough to be nerfed.  I think this is fairly safe from the nerf bat.  I will just have to weather the laughter when other classes realize that the priest balancing gave druids a massive healing upgrade and gave clerics FT 3 3/4 (if they want to stand up and cast a spell every 24 seconds or so).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">tenarife</div><div class="date">08-24-2002, 06:35 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">It gets even better.<br />
<br />
This just in: Druid CH reduced to 300 mana on test.<br />
<br />
So now, not only can a druid CH 95% of every normal tank serverwide, they do it better than us.<br />
<br />
I don't even know what to say about this change... I really don't. I'm beyond myself.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">pag0</div><div class="date">08-24-2002, 07:14 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Didn't I see that they lowered the mana cost on y5 to like 10? can someone confirm?<br />
<br />
Also of note, what is the actual difference in mana regen when sitting or standing? Unbuffed, without FTxx, just plain base mana regen standing vs sitting (from 56 to 60, since these are the lvls MOST affected at this time by these melee changes)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Archivis</div><div class="date">08-24-2002, 07:27 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok, from what I've seen everyone else is covering the points of extra changes that need to be made to make this a logical change. However there is one thing that I havent seen spoken of yet. Where exactly will we be able to get these spells? Will they be merchant sold? Or, most likely, Dropped spells that people will either have to spend hours upon hours to get, or be forced to pay over 10k for a single spell. Personally, if they are dropped spells they better be common drops. There are all ready enough spells I will never have because I can't get them, or I refuse to pay outrageous prices for them.<br />
<br />
If this is to be our option for solo'ing, let's make sure EVERY cleric has the option, not just the ones who have huge bank accounts, or uber enough guilds to get them for us.<br />
<br />
I have sent emails to the dev team... I have posted many things on upgrades clerics would do well to get, and I have bitched endlessly about how pointless it is to &quot;controll&quot; our epic that really has a minor effect that is duplicated by a spell we get by not making ragefire a triggered spawn. I will not get into all of that again. <br />
<br />
However, while this is a step in the right direction, I still see it as falling short of what is needed. Bash skill you say? New summoned hammer? Spiffy... what about those of us who use a 2 handed weapon? Sucks to be us huh? And to go back to my concern over where these spells will come from, I all ready am missing too many spells to list due to refusing to pay over 10K+ for them. <br />
<br />
The spell economy itself could use a tweeking. How about letting players teach each other spells? You would never again see: You're lvl 60 and dont have Aego? Sorry, we'll take the cleric who does have it, your out of luck, go away. Not only would this put an end to people over charging for spells, it would also encourage people to be friendly and work with each other to over come a greater goal. But that is another issue all together. All I'm saying is, this is a good start, let's not screw it up, and let's see what else ya got comin' to us.<br />
<br />
My suggestions (for anyone who has read this far...):<br />
<br />
1. Clerics with snare/slow type spells - If we get snare, that will more or less negate the melee things in the works. Slow however in this case makes much more sense. We aren't tanks. We can take a few hits, yes, but tanking is not on the list. With snare, we would end up kiting. With slow, melee combat would have much better results.<br />
<br />
2. Some reliable means of single pulling would also be in order for this thing to work as planned. Mayhaps you should rethink the changes made to Wake of Tranquility. I fail to see why it was changed in the first place.<br />
<br />
3. Invis type spell - Would it be nice? Sure. However, not 100% needed. Look at it this way. Clerics are the only preist class that have no form of movement speed enhancement beyond runspeed 3. Giving us Spirit of Wolf... not really a great idea, that's nature, druids and shammies have that covered. How about God's Speed then? A widely accepted form of wishing someone well on a journey. Sounds like a clerical spell if ever I heard one. and would also make clerics more valuble at least durring inside raids/groups as I don't think a God's blessing would be limited to outdoors. :p  <br />
<br />
4. I generally like the idea of making the hammer proc a self buff type spell. this would solve the problem of people with better weapons, or who rather use 2 handed things. Good work for you other clerics out there! :)<br />
<br />
5. Wrapping a DS into Y5 instead of mana regen. Hmmm I could go either way on this one. I think the mana regen is nice, and you will notice a big change if you have other things that regen mana, such as the PoTC non-druid earring, or various other Flowing Thought items. However, a DS would be nice to, either way I'll be happy to use a yaulp spell for other than carrying smithing supplies.<br />
<br />
6. The Deity necklaces. Good idea, bad implementation. Dark Elf Clerics can free cast snare, High Elf cleric's can free cast root. Ect. Dwarf Clerics get a bit chafted here. We only have 2 necklaces whereas others have 3. At this point in time, our top one summons beer. A nice TOY, not practical for anything other than humor. How about giving us something that makes sense for a Dwarf, that would have an effect on game play. Or at the very least, an effect that makes sense for a cleric. Something undead based... something having to do with indoors, or underground where Dwarves are at home. Anything, so long as it has an effect on game play. And as far as I know... Halfling clerics are even more shafted on this. I have yet to hear about a Karana necklace. (If I'm wrong here, someone tell me where I can find the info ;))<br />
<br />
/rant on<br />
<br />
7. And this will really be the last one. FIX OUR DAMN EPIC QUEST. kk thnx~ As a person who has a full time job, and who tries to have a life out side of work and EQ, I simply can not sit around for 6+ days to get the last peice of my epic. Make the damn dragon a triggered spawn by handing in the pearl to the Human Ragefire who has a MUCH better respawn timer. I've said this countless times. The cleric epic is in NO way a high powered epic. is it useful? Sure. Does it have good-great stats? You bet. Does it have an effect that we would not other wise get such as the shaman or druid epic? Nope. We get the exact spell at lvl 56. I see no logic to punishing clerics who can't sit in one place for over 6 days for a nice item that grants nothing other that free cast spell that we hope we NEVER have to use. If a cleric has to rez on a raid, that means someone screwed up in some way (be it the cleric missing a heal, or the person who died just not understanding his orders ;)), the raid we are on gets wiped out, or we see some poor person who got themself randomly killed doing something, and for what ever reason (role playing, or just out right enjoying helping people in need.) We res them. Where is the logic in &quot;controlling&quot; how fast these come into game? Why are clerics the ones who get special attention? Out of all the preist classes, clerics have the weakest epic effect, and the hardest epic. WHY? Shaman epics are said to be so easy, that they should just be handed out for reaching lvl 55. and facing facts, when is the last time you saw a druid over lvl 56 with out an epic? Please, don't tell us that you fixed it by making it so the non-hardcore people can't get one. That to me is just as bad as being told to sit in the back of the bus.<br />
<br />
/rant off<br />
<br />
I'm sorry for the VERY long post, but I've been playing a cleric for a LONG time now. Infact my cleric is my highest lvl, and longest /played character, not to mention the first one I ever got past lvl 50. I take this class very seriously. If after nearly 3 years we are finally going to be able to solo, I want to see it done right. And I also want to see some focus on areas that are long over due for some fixes. To any one who has made it this far, congrats... you get a cookie. Send me a tell in game to recieve it :p<br />

Dont' know what the auras should do, but we have to be grouped for it to have effect so people dont beg us for an aego and run off and play for 2+ hours.<br />

One of the things I saw many people misquote on thier postings was referring to Rich Waters's statement.<br />
<br />
These ideas you have been bandying about may be tried on the server because what Rich said was...<br />
<br />
<br />
Clerics are going to receive additional changes so that they have some abilities that makes them more sought after for grouping. The final ability choices will be made after this first set of changes is evaluated and tested more extensively. It's very important that clerics have an ability that makes other players say &quot;I really want to invite a cleric because they can do X, and that will be really helpful.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
These changes are step one...there will be a step two...maybe some of these ideas will be included in it.<br />

If rumor is true, and druid CH has gone from 400 mana to 300 mana on test, on a 6000 hp warrior:<br />
<br />
Scenario: (heal at 30% health)<br />
CH from a cleric = 9.0 hp / mana (3600 hp)<br />
CH from a druid = 9.8 hp / mana (2940 hp)<br />
<br />
Might be a tad off on the max from the 2940, but i'm pretty sure that's right. And how many warriors serverwide have 6000 hp+?<br />
<br />
It's RARE to see 7000, and 6000 is being REALLY liberal. We had a discussion about it, and we guessed normal XP groups are 5000 hp for your tank... you don't want to know the calculations behind that one...</div></div><hr />

They like to be able to decide who lives and who dies with the click of a button<br />

I know at least that i didn't make my cleric with hopes that i could run off to charasis and melee mobs...Clerics can already solo there np so why make it easier? and why change grp dynamics...<br />

With 60 shamans having torpor they can already be the main healer for a good grp in Seb/Velks and even CT i've seen war/mnk/shm/enc handle sewers np<br />

Not sure why VI is thinkin we need to be battle clerics and solo but i'm pretty sure that the high end clerics that would actually be able to use these spells would prefer just being able to have better healing spells...Maybe a semi mana efficient grp heal or a quicker cast time ch type spell...like that 75% ones for dru/shm...toss it to clerics with a 7.5 sec cast time or something...<br />

Why would it be pointless at 59 to nearly 60?  You still have several hundred levels to go in aa points alone, and to be perfectly honest I get beter exp soloing than grouping half the time any way.  In groups I pull a lot of the time just to keep from being bored to tears.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I think the general consensus is if they are going to put these changes in place, do it right.  Having to swap out a nice weapon for a summond hammer is by far a waste of time IMO.  Why did I bother to get it in the 1st place if all I do is summon my main weapon now?<br />
<br />
This cramps the reason to look for better weapons.  I like mine but if this tweak is ment to help the class it should be as a buff not a summoned item.<br />
<br />
Druids and shaman will be getting the full effect of their upgrades which can be used in any scenario, from solo, raid to exp groups.  Clerics should expect nothing less.<br />
<br />
VI really put the cleric class into a tight box which gets hurt with any heal upgrades to other priest classes.  It is time to take us out of that box.  For far too long we have been dependant on CH as our claim to fame.  Not rez, not buffs.  They are nice but as so many people have said all of these things can be done via a BoT.<br />
<br />
Make our class a challange to play.  Give us real group potential.  I am seeing a few more posts regarding MoK &amp; MoR additions.  Thinking Outside the box is really what its going to take.<br />
<br />
Let the shaman, rangers, necros and Enchanters slow.  Let the BL's shaman, rangers and druids Sow.  Invis?  Nice but not real new at all. Also with a Gnomish vanishing device etc it is not really needed but would help. All these things are just trivial imo.<br />
<br />
My list of things I would love to see. (Re-tooled)<br />
<br />
1) Spell lvl 56 The Unseen Weakness<br />
      ~&lt; 300 Mana 6 Sec cast time &gt;~ Duration 1Min<br />
<br />
This spell when cast on a target increases the amont of critical damage inflicted on a mob.  20% more damage caster based 40% damage Meele based. (Popping a disk would be alot more fun.)<br />
<br />
2) Spell Lvl 57 Bristlebain's Deception<br />
      ~&lt; 200 Mana 3 Sec cast time &gt;~ Duration 1Min<br />
<br />
This spell when cast on a target decreases any healing spells that land on the mob by 50% with a 10% chance the mob will *resist the heal altogeather!<br />
<br />
(Lower the lvl of MoK and MoR spells into the 30's)<br />
<br />
3) Spell Lvl 55 The Clerics Apprentice<br />
~&lt; 1500 Mana 10Sec casting time &gt;~ Druation zone based.  <br />
<br />
(This pet does not despawn unless the cleric camps zones etc. Also the pets race is random.  So a HEF cleric could summon a DE cleric.)<br />
<br />
Pet is a 34 Cleric. This pet instead of being an all out meele would focus on casting Superior healing on his master.  Only 4 spells are available to this pet.  <br />
<br />
* Yaul 2<br />
* Hammer of Striking<br />
* Greater Healing<br />
* Superior Healing<br />
<br />
Until the cleric is down to 50% health the Pet does not heal, only meele with Yaulp 2. (Less dmg that UHoF but still helpful) This pet can't be buffed by anything above lvl 34 in the cleric buff line. The pet would be able to med on command and have a mana pool large enough to cast 2-3 SH's.  With Yaulp 5 and a buff that proc's off any weapon this could be a very viable solo method.  I still feel offence and Defence caps need to be raised.  Esp Dodge 1Hb!<br />
<br />
I fully agree with making the &quot;new&quot; summond hammer a buff instead of an actual hammer.<br />
<br />
Making cleric gates to temples is a great idea.  We are far to dependant for ports to get anywhere.  This is a plus for all since it would make rezzing the dead more practical.<br />

You know... if you don't like the new hammer... don't use it. No one is forcing you to go &quot;battlecleric&quot;. You can remain a healer if you wish <br />
<br />
Well, except that XP spots for 54-59 clerics are going to be a lot harder to find since druids will be more than sufficient.  Shaman-based groups didn't have a &quot;problem&quot; already.<br />
<br />
You're missing the point, though, and it's an important one:<br />
<br />
They're adding the Hammer and the new Yaulp and the bash skill as part of the effort to balance the class because they're nerfing it by spreading out adequate healing.  That is exactly what they're saying:  the new abililties are intended to offset, in part, the new heals for druids and shaman.  They say there are other changes coming to make clerics more valuable to groups, but melee isn't going to be it.<br />
<br />
So, let's look at Joe Average, 54 cleric.  He's probably got maxxed defense, at least if he's smart.  His strength is higher than it was, but there are a few inherently weak cleric races and it's almost certainly not 200+.  His AGI, STA, etc. are all around 100 or above.<br />
All through his career, he's added WIS gear, with good AC when possible, with HP and resists coming later down the decision tree.<br />
No group has really let him work on his melee skills and he's probably not played solo enough to max them out.  He knew he wasn't a melee, so he's never really concentrated on melee skills.  He's not on a decent melee table and it actually takes him a while to clear an orc camp in EC with pure melee.<br />
<br />
Now druids at his level (54) have a baby CHeal that's more than sufficient for XP groups.  They also can port, evac, damage shield and snare.  He can't do any of that &quot;extra&quot; stuff;  he's a healer.  And he's a piss-poor melee.  And he doesn't get the hammer until 56.  How's he get there?  Compete for groups with druids who are more than adequate healers and provide all those other nice abilities?  Compete for groups with shaman who are more than adequate healers and can Slow and melee buff?  Nope, his only ability is a rez.  It's the one thing he has the other classes don't.  But wait!  He's 54.  He doesn't have the &quot;good&quot; rez yet.  So he's not going to get groups for that, either.<br />
<br />
So Joe Average, 54 cleric:  no more groups because of his healing ability.  No solo capability because he doesn't have the Hammer that supposedly will let him solo for two more levels.  No 96% rez at this point either.  Good luck getting to 56, Joe Average, because you are well and truly screwed over.<br />
<br />
And, more than anything, that's what's wrong about this.  The other classes get a spell that's supposed to make them viable on raids that really makes them more than viable in XP groups, all at 54.  And a 54 cleric who has to compete with them for XP groups doesn't get compensating abilities until 56 even if you believe this melee crap is compensation, which I don't.<br />
<br />
Two things to &quot;fix&quot; this:  first, they say clerics will get other abilities to make them group friendly.  Make sure those are at 54 so clerics who have to compete with druids who have the new spell can compete.  And make sure that those abilities &quot;attack&quot; the reasons why the other priest classes get groups over clerics now:  a combined Slow and Snare, for instance, both 75% of druid Snare and shaman Slow at 54th level.  And, second, if that's not the fix, add a component to the druid and shaman CHeal that is expensive enough to make it inappropriate in XP groups and inexpensive enough to make it viable on raids.<br />
<br />
But giving clerics an ability at 56 to solo in exchange for giving druids and shaman an ability at 54 is wrong, especially since that 54 cleric simply has no way of ensuring his continued group viability which is essentially his only way to getting to 56.</div></div><hr />

WTH are you smoking? :)<br />

<br />
Doing 30DPS on an exp hunt wont cut it. Druids and Shamans can do that much with right clickabkles. Any other melee class can probably double that DPS in a lot of dungeons. Our melee in general just sucks. We miss 3 times and connect one. So what if that proc goes off every third hit, it takes NINE swings to make it hit three times. <br />
<br />
The heals are welcome additions but we are already a far sight more effecient than anyone else; they help, but its minimal help at best. The upside to the heals is I seeing it opening up spell slots for us. Lose DL and CE and just use the fast caster. Or use the large heal. In AE situations the group CE is decent due to low agro but for mana effeciency its nowhere even CLOSE to Word of Redemption. <br />
<br />
Conclusions : we still need significant damage upgrades and if this is the answer (melee) then we need our offensive and defensive melee capabilties raised across the board. The proposed changes are not what a large range of clerics have asked for; in fact most of us see the key to our versatility to be in spells and abilities not in melee. Fixing the melee picture is doing something that should have been VERY apparent to ANYONE playing a cleric post 30 over 2 years ago. Upgrading our Undead line is another thing that is overdue; how can a spell line that is limited to less than 10 percent of the hunting areas in the game be WEAKER than spells that affect everything? Doesnt make any sort of sense. <br />
<br />
<br />
Clerics need something that breaks them away from the constant med state this is a good start but it STILL leaves us lagging far behind every other class in damage output or damage buffing. Sony I think is being cautious because they realize how much any significant change to our spell lineup can affect raids. Melee and self buffs are going to be the only feasible routes because if we can offensively buff others you can bet it will be used on raids, same for any sort of new &quot;Mark&quot; type spells. <br />

<br />
We need a DOT that does roughly 1200 Damage to undead. A Nuke that does in the 1k range VS undead.<br />
<br />
Second another nice feature would be an  undead only slow. Allow us to slow undead for 30% or something.  Thats not overpowering and it wont come into play a whole lot but atleast it is an option. <br />
<br />
Clerics and Pallys are the slayers of undead, as it is now clerics still take 15 min to melee a level 6 skeleton to death. <br />
<br />
Give us a spell that we can cast on whatever we are wielding. Have it do DD VS undead. Maybe give it to us at level 45 or so and have it do more and more damage the higher level we get. <br />
<br />
Similar to a bards song. The higher you are the stronger your songs become. <br />
<br />
Maybe at level 60 give it a manatap that sucks mana from the mob. (From Caster Mobs anyway)<br />
<br />
These are all things that could benefit not only the cleric but also groups. <br />
<br />
It would allow Druids or Shamans to play healers. Clerics could nuke, do some melee, maybe slow an undead mob or two among other things that would help a group.<br />
<br />
I also think that our summoned hammers should not poof after each fight. With 100hps and low damage output they dont make a big difference anyway.</div></div><hr />

I guess I was spoiled by spectres too much, but with a specialty against undead, I think it's reasonable to think that there should be some kind of undead a cleric could solo for at least modest xp at any level.    I'd really like to continue playing a cleric, but the 50+ game is very intense and time consuming.  Instead of adding ways for a 56 cleric to melee (not that this is gonna make it possible in my opinion), I'd much rather see the ability to solo our true nemesis, the undead.  <br />
<br />
     At 51, xp comes to a slow trickle, with raids making it more likely you'll see the xp bar moving in the wrong direction.  There are few zones where you can find a pick-up group, and after spectres, there's nothing a cleric that's not completely twinked out could reasonably solo.  I have to say, the more I play a 52 cleric, the less I enjoy playing the game at all.  :(</div></div><hr />

[B]Lately, we've been working up some changes to help balance out the cleric class.  This is important to get done before Planes of Power, as it's the foundation for the growing role of priest classes in the future of EverQuest.  The goals behind these changes are to Provide clerics with useful group and raid roles as other priests gain raid quality healing<br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
&lt;font color=&quot;#3333ff&quot;&gt;These changes sound ok but it is very important that other classes are NEVER able to replace clerics in groups and high-level raid encounters as the role of primary healer.<br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
They should get better heals, but clerics should still be UN replaceable. I happen to like the fact that people NEED me. I don't mind not being able to solo, as long as I am necessary in groups.<br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
I have played the solo game as a necromancer, and HATED it. If I go to sebillis, Cazic Thule or any other zone to get experience and can't find a group because there are too many druids and shaman in the zone I am going to be very upset.<br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
I already have a hard time finding pickup groups due to the large number of high-level clerics on my server. If other classes get healing abilities that allow them to do nearly as good as a cleric, that will make for 2 other classes that I would have to compete against to get groups.<br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
I noticed that in an earlier post you mentioned that clerics have trouble finding in groups because they are not thought of us essential to high-level groups. That is totally untrue. The only reason I do not get groups from time to time is because there are too many clerics in a zone.<br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
A good experience group needs several melees, maybe a nuker or two, and some sort of buff class. How many clerics are needed in a group?? ONE. This causes a huge bottleneck for clerics who want to get a group for some experience. Lets take Velks as an example. Velks can generally hold about 30 people before the players run out of mobs to kill. If you go over 30, the next group of 6 people will be standing around and getting a kill maybe once every 5 to 10 minutes.<br />
<br />
 <br />

30 people equal 5 full groups. Out of those 30 people, only 5 of them are clerics. In other words, if I go to velks and there are 5 or more clerics in the zone, there is no chance in hell of me getting a group there. At the same time, there are tons of opportunities for other classes to get groups since you need several melee/nukers/buffers in each group.<br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
Each of those groups can hold a druid and a shaman for an example, but you will almost NEVER seen 2 clerics in a single experience group.<br />

 <br />
<br />
Yay, only 2 clerics in the zone. I can get a group!!! Damn there are 4 shaman and 8 druids! There is NO chance of me finding a group with that many good healers.<br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
If I see the above scenario happening after the changes you have planned, I am probably going to stop playing my cleric all together.&lt;/font&gt;<br />
<br />
It's important that clerics maintain their role as the premier healer of the game.  Raid quality heals are being added for other priests to allow them to fulfill their role as secondary healers in most situations.<br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
&lt;font color=&quot;#3333ff&quot;&gt;The KEYWORD here is SECONDARY. As it stands right now, I believe that the new shaman/druid spells are too mana efficient. They should be able to keep the main tank on a raid alive in a pinch, for a descent period of time. They should not be able to perform a full-blown complete heal rotation on a mob that takes 5 to 10 minutes to kill. That is MY JOB as a cleric.&lt;/font&gt;<br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
Clerics have always been a healing specialist, but the situation has escalated such that many raid level encounters may not be undertaken without disproportionally large numbers of clerics.<br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
&lt;font color=&quot;#3333ff&quot;&gt;Disproportionally?? My guild can take down 90 percent of the games raid level mobs with around 8 clerics. How many melee are needed? Anywhere from 20 to 40, depending on what you are trying to kill. You then need a lot of nukers and casters to really jack up your damage.&lt;/font&gt;<br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
  No other class has been able to fill in if a cleric is absent, and healing is too important of a role to allow one class to dominate it so completely.  After these changes are complete, clerics will still be the very best of healers but other priests class are able to substitute to some degree.<br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
&lt;font color=&quot;#3333ff&quot;&gt;Who can fill in as a warrior on a raid? NO class can. No class can take the amount of damage that a warrior can handle.<br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
Who can replace a Wizard on a raid? Druids can to a degree, as can Necromancers if they have life burn. No one can truly replace a mana burn wizzy though, their 10k plus burns, and bane damage spells.<br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
The point I am trying to make here is that all of the classes have unique abilities that make them all ESSENTIAL on raids.<br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
Druids are incredibly good nukers that can only be outdone by wizards. If I am on a raid and want to be in the group that gets experience the most, you better believe that I am going to try to get in the group with a couple druids that can cast moonfire. Moonfire and a descent mana pool make druids incredible damage dealers.<br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
Now lets talk about shaman. SLOW anyone? Shaman are the ONLY class that can slow a mob well. Enchanters/bards can do it, but to be honest there slow is pretty horrible in comparison. Shaman spells are also essential. If the main tank on my raid doesnt have Focus and Stamina buffs on before we engage, odds are we arent going to engage the mob at all.<br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
Who can replace a cleric on a raid? Apparently druids and shaman will be able to after the next patch. (sigh)&lt;/font&gt;<br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
Clerics are going to receive additional changes so that they have some abilities that makes them more sought after for grouping.  The final ability choices will be made after this first set of changes is evaluated and tested more extensively.  It's very important that clerics have an ability that makes other players say &quot;I really want to invite a cleric because they can do X, and that will be really helpful.&quot;  This is vital to the health of the class.<br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
&lt;font color=&quot;#3333ff&quot;&gt;I practically have people offer me money to group with them if there arent enough clerics in a zone. Clerics arent just really helpful now they are an absolute must. I really dont know where you are getting your information from, but clerics couldnt be much more useful than they already are.<br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
I get tells from 10 zones away asking for resurrections. I get tells from level 45 players offering 200p for me to come to them and cast Aegolism on their group. I get people from all over the game giving me tells to come group with them. How much more desired can we get than that???&lt;/font&gt;<br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
All priests should offer a similar level of value in solo, group, and raid situations, and they won't be considered balanced until this is true.<br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
&lt;font color=&quot;#3333ff&quot;&gt;So you are saying that all priest classes should be equal value?<br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
Does that mean a cleric will now be able to nuke for 1100 damage at a cost of 300 mana? A druid can do this now.<br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
Does that mean that a cleric will now be able to buff melee classs offensives stats? As it stands right now ONLY shaman can do this well.<br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
I think the answer to the above questions will be NO. What this basically boils down to is that clerics can now melee a little better, while the other priest classes get to keep all of their essential spells while getting a HUGE healing upgrade.Clerics get to solo; druids and shaman get upgrades that make clerics less important. That doesnt sound like a very good balancing to me.<br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
It sounds to me like you are tired of hearing druids and shaman complain, have decided to do something to make them quiet down, and hurting a class that is already well balanced in the process.&lt;/font&gt;<br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
We understand that there's a lot of trepidation at major changes, and fears that your class will become less valuable in the game.  When the changes are finished, I think most people will be pleased and will feel that their concerns have been listened to and addressed.<br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
&lt;font color=&quot;#3333ff&quot;&gt;I will wait to pass judgment until I see the final changes. PLEASE tell me you are not going to start adding changes to the live servers until these changes are finished. If you are going to make these changes slowly over a period of time, that will mean that clerics will be of less value until all of the changes are in place.<br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
Do I have to be less valuable for the next six months while the development team fiddles around with this balancing act???&lt;/font&gt;<br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
The health of all classes in the game is as important to the dev team as it is to the many people who've spoken up passionately about their concerns here on this board.<br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
&lt;font color=&quot;#3333ff&quot;&gt;It looks as if you are listening to the concerns of druids/shaman, and are scrambling to fix clerics because they will now be unbalanced in comparison.<br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
I hope that I am wrong.&lt;/font&gt;<br />
<br />
