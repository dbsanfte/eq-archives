Just starting my quest and I'm about to lay the smack down on the plasmatic priest.  Was just wondering how everyone did theirs and what worked best and what doesnt work.  I've heard his aoe can aggro a bunch of other mobs and wondered what you did if anything to defeat that part of him.<P>Well thanks a lot for any info you can give.<P>Kellethia Goldmane<BR>Cazic-Thule<BR>51 Vicar of Tunare</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#f7f7f7"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Daia Spiritlight</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">We just did him this past Sunday.  We did get some small aggro from temple mobs at the zoneline (a couple of stuns failed) but they were easily controlled with atone/mem blur and that's what I'd recommend if your people don't want the faction hits.  Also to make sure he doesn't AE on you while still upstairs (a lot of mobs up there), do not damage him in any way until you get him to the zoneline.  He will wrath you, so be sure to have your magic resist up and have a great sense of direction (mine sucks and I took 4 wraths before diving off a platform to get back to the zoneline for the fight).  It helps if you have someone escort you up to his room and have the doors opened for you - makes it easier to get out when you're running for your life. =) <P>In the end, he went down easy but he took a relatively long time.  We had 13 people between level 47 and 55 whomping on him (or healing the whompers) and it still took nearly 2.5 minutes -- a very long time for a non-planar EQ fight.<P>Good luck!<P>------------------<BR>Peace and Love and Bright Blessings,<P>Daia Spiritlight, High Priestess of Quellious<BR>Rathe Server</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#dedfdf"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Mirriana_00</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">He was far, far easier than I thought he was going to be.

It was well into the battle both times, and they ran straight for our bard, then killed me when I healed him.  For some reason he managed to aggro the whole entry and pull 7+ mobs on us.  He claims he wasn't playing AE songs either time.<P>/shrug<P>We just managed to kill the priest as everyone zoned, so I just respawned there and looted him.<P>I'd recommend 6+ high level, competent people, or 12ish 50th level people.</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#f7f7f7"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Nurrse_Sakuraa</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><BR>When I killed him, we had about 7-8 ppl total.

Killed him yesterday with a 60 monk, 55 monk, 59 cleric (me), 55 cleric (the beneficiary), a 52 warrior, a 54 druid, and a 51 enchanter. This was overkill but we were on our way to kill Eejag so we figured we'd do this first.<P>The easy way to do this is to pull the mob to the zone, which is very simple. Take a monk, point out the mob to him, have him whack it and run to the zone where he should FD. Have someone say (preferably hotkey if you are still preparing, but shift up arrow will do) 'what plasmatic priest' which will make him hang around. Say it repeatedly so he doesn't leave until you're ready, then hand him the proper item and give him his beatdown.<P>He's a 55 cleric. You can expect him to hit like an average 55 mob and occasionally cast a laughable DD as well as CH. For humor value he also buffs himself with Fortitude, which you might want to dispel first if you're a perfectionist (like me). The only thing you have to worry about is the CH. Don't let him do it. If you were to believe some of the statements above you might get intimidated by this but don't worry. He is in fact quite stunnable (or by amazing coincidence his casting was interrupted four times in a row at the very moment my stuns landed on him) and not particularly resistant. Just stun him like anything else that CHes and he dies quite easily.</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#dedfdf"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Boanerges</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial"> <BLOCKQUOTE><font size="1" face="Verdana, Arial">quote:</font><HR>I love when people talk about things they know nothing about, like they wrote the book.<HR></BLOCKQUOTE><P>Nice insult to open with.

I thought I was just dreaming when I landed that stun 2 seconds before he CHed himself.  <IMG SRC="http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/rolleyes.gif"> I don't know how he got interrupted for you, but I have never had any stun I cast sucessfully interrupt him. Unless he was changed in a patch, this is still the case.<P>No, he's not hard but, like so many other mobs, if you make a small mistake it can cost you big time. He doesn't always cast the same spells, however. Never had him cast an AE and only twice has he tried to CH (suceeded once). If you burn him down fast (Reckoning and Retribution work just fine, btw) you should have no trouble.<P>------------------<BR>Boanerges Thundercry<BR>Erudite Templar of Prexus<BR>Cohort Chalybeius<BR>Cazic Thule Server</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#f7f7f7"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Jubal</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Sorry bout that Boanerges, just returned from server rants and momentum carried me =)<P>Anyway I have fought him several times myself and I do stun the CHes and it does work for me.

There were two of us who needed the priest.  We killed him promptly when he spawned at 9am game time, and we expected to have to wait the 72 minutes of real time for him to spawn again.  However, when he was checked a few minutes later, he had respawned!  We did him twice within about 10 or 15 minutes of each other.
