With good dragon faction, you can port into Wakening Lands without trouble from Wuoshi.<BR>2. With good dragon faction, you can port into Cobalt Scar without trouble from the Cobalt Drakes and Wyverns.<BR>3. With good dragon faction, you can cross the Western Wastes to the Temple of Veeshan without trouble from the roving dragons (see a pattern here).<BR>4. Half of Temple of Veeshan is on Claws of Veeshan faction, the other is not on any faction. Just fight in the un-factioned areas (this is where the parts for the Skyshrine quest armor drop anyway).<BR>5. Easier trip through Temple of Veeshan to Plane of Mischief if allied with dragons.<BR>6. Temple of Veeshan quest givers are on Claws of Veeshan faction. My guess would be that they give out some pretty nice stuff. As far as I have been able to determine, all the quest in the Temple of Veeshan are unsolved.<BR>7. Bank and vendors in Skyshrine are more centrally located in my opinion.<BR>8. If you do go on a dragon raid, you can avoid the faction hit by; getting killed (not an unlikely event), stay low on hate list (difficult depending on class), just heal (I have gone on a couple Wuoshi raids where I healed several people but did not get on the hate list), or /quit just before it dies.<BR>9. If you do take a faction hit, there are lots of low level creatures to kill that can reverse the hit. Since it is usually only one dragon you are attacking, there are not several hits to fix.<BR>10. And finally, Giants are Evil. Just ask Mother Tunare.<P>------------------<BR><A HREF="http://eq.castersrealm.com/players/view_profile.asp?Id=4094" TARGET=_blank>Templar Crestus Tunarian</A><BR><A HREF="http://www.exiledlegion.com" TARGET=_blank>Exiled Legion</A><BR>Rodcet Nife</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#f7f7f7"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Xitara Du'Vie -Xegony-</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><I>1.

With good dragon faction, you can port into Cobalt Scar without trouble from the Cobalt Drakes and Wyverns.</I><P>With good giant faction, you can hunt wyverns and cobalt drakes for gems needed to complete velious armor quests.<P><I>3. With good dragon faction, you can cross the Western Wastes to the Temple of Veeshan without trouble from the roving dragons (see a pattern here).</I><P>With good giant faction, you can hunt dragons non-stop in western wastes for dragonhide armor, necklace of superiority clones, and you can kill klandicar for sleeper's tomb keys.<P><I>4. Half of Temple of Veeshan is on Claws of Veeshan faction, the other is not on any faction. Just fight in the un-factioned areas (this is where the parts for the Skyshrine quest armor drop anyway).</I><P>One third of Temple of Veeshan is on Claws of Veeshan faction, one third is on Guardians of Veeshan faction, and one third has no faction. As far as I know, Skyshrine quest armor only drops in the Halls of Testing. Another thing to note is that the quest givers in skyshrine can be charmed quite easily. This allows people aligned with giants to complete both sets of armor.<P><I>5. Easier trip through Temple of Veeshan to Plane of Mischief if allied with dragons.</I><P>Unless you gain faction with Guardians of Veeshan by completing Temple of Veeshan quests, you will still find it difficult to reach Plane of Mischief.<P><I>6. Temple of Veeshan quest givers are on Claws of Veeshan faction. My guess would be that they give out some pretty nice stuff. As far as I have been able to determine, all the quest in the Temple of Veeshan are unsolved.</I><P>Correct, Legacy of Steel from The Nameless is getting pretty close to finishing some quests. I believe they still need to kill Dozekar the Cursed.<P><I>7. Bank and vendors in Skyshrine are more centrally located in my opinion.<BR>8.

With good dragon faction, you can cross the Western Wastes to the Temple of Veeshan without trouble from the roving dragons (see a pattern here).<P>  Unfortunately, the ice burrowers and wolves aren't as nice, they usually end up being just as much of a pest as the dragons are (Easier to see big dragons than little wolves)<P>6. Temple of Veeshan quest givers are on Claws of Veeshan faction. My guess would be that they give out some pretty nice stuff. As far as I have been able to determine, all the quest in the Temple of Veeshan are unsolved.<P>  Which leads me to believe they're either broken, and don't work at all, or there is not even an uber guild strong enough to take down the mobs needed (LoS is sided with dragons, and have yet to complete a quest given in ToV)<P>  Also note, Sleepers Tomb is on CoV faction, or at least some of it, allying with the dragons will prevent you from killing almost everything in the zone.<P>  Siding with the giants is a good idea because; <BR>1) Kael is centrally located, without a port, you'll end up running through it once in a while.<BR>2) The best armor in the game comes from the Kael quests (Can argue SS for stats, but I'll take the AC anyday)<BR>3) There's some pretty nice quests from Kael, easily doable by one or two level 50's, including Girdle of Reflection.<BR>4) Dragons drop some pretty nice loot =)<P>  All kidding aside, I really think its best to do whatever your guild/group of friends decides, its not much use having all the options if you can't follow through with them.<P>Just my .02<BR>Khalim Richelieu<BR>The Pantheon<P>Edit: put Girdle of the Diligent instead of Girdle of Reflection, woops.<p>[This message has been edited by Khalim - Innoruuk (edited 03-27-2001).]</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#f7f7f7"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Segal</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">1) Actually its alot easier to kill Woushi if you are +Dragon faction than if you are +gaint.   <P>2) Yeap, number one issue that faces most guilds is getting people from point A to point B.  Those portals make a huge difference.<P>3) Not only can you cross western wastes, but you can kill the dragons and a little time in Kael will repair the damage.<P>4) Kill everything in TOV and then repair faction damage in Kael.  Or have a Non-KOS puller bring mobs from the Testing Hall.<P>5) +Dragon faction will certainly help get to POM but other factors also apply.<P>6) +Dragon faction allows you to complete all SOV quests with the exception of Kael quests assuming you are hunting in Kael. Even Kael quests can be completed with some effort.<P>7) Skyshrine is the most centrally located for people hunting in WW, DN, and SG.  Not too mention that you get the side benefit of great faction in Thurgadin.<P>8) Two dragon slayings, two trips to Western Wastes where I killed roughly 40 dragons, one night in TOV and I am Kindly to dragons.<P>9) One night in Kael seems to make up for two or three nights in TOV or WW.<P>10) Killing gaints is fun especially for a cleric.  Root parking works, Atone works, DA pulling is a blast.  Its fun to kill level 50+ mobs that are not 100% MR for a change.<P></FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#dedfdf"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Nemean</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Nemean's top ten list for why he will never side with those goat-loving giants<P>1)  The first time I was in Velious - I zoned into Kael, /hailed the first wandering giant, and he proceeded to pound me into a red mist.<BR>2)  Revenge will be mine.<BR>3-10)  See 2.<P>Nem.</FONT></TD></TR></TABLE>
