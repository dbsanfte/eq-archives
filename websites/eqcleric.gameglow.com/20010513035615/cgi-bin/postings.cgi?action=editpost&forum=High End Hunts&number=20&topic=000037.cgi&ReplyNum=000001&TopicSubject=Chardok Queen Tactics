<TEXTAREA NAME="EditedMessage" ROWS=10 COLS=45 WRAP="VIRTUAL">The queen doesn't have a lot of HP, like 18-20k, but she is capable of killing a very large number of people very quickly. Due to how devastating her AE is most people find it preferable to fight her with a small number of people with very tightly controlled agro.
The hard part is clearing out her guards, you will need to have more than one puller so that you can chain FD pull her guards away from her. We usually set up out in the hall in the corner by the fake wall.
Once we have her down to 1 or 2 guards we quickly set up our fight team. Generally the team is 3 warriors, 3-4 clerics, every mage on the raid, 2-3 wizards and one enchanter. If there are 3 or more mages, I like using only one warrior and having all the clerics focused on him. Also there will usually be 2-3 suicide paladins involved. Can do it with fewer, but it sucks to be one of the people sitting outside in the hall, so we include as many people as its safe to. =)
The critical thing is for the warriors, preferably only one of them, to hold agro through the entire fight. Pick one warrior to be the primary tank, have them engage and start off with riposte disciplin to build agro. after the Queen's first AE, a palladin uses LoH on the warrior then uses DA to cut his agro. Once riposte is gone, warrior should go defensive, at this point, at this its at least 2 clerics should be spamming CH at him, its handy for a pally to be standing by with LoH incase he gets to low. Any paladins involved need to be right at the warrior when they LoH and be ready to DA to get agro off them. The paladins should also understand that they will not be getting cleric heals, so once they LoH and get agro off them, they should back out of AE range, or die, thier option. The idea behind this is to prevent the queen from bouncing around after clerics, when we use this tactic to control agro MOBs don't generally even bat an eyelash at the clerics.
Mage pets are very handy because they are imune to the AE. Need an enchanter to mez the extras in the room and any spawn. A couple of wizards are handy to blast her when she gets low on hp. She has a disgusting tendancey to run very fast out of her room and up the ramp when she gets low. About the time she hits the top of the ramp, she gets healed through the walls, stops and gates. I realy recommend you prevent that, about 2k in nukes is plenty to finish her off as she is about to run.  =)

We usually have about 12 in for the fight. She can be done with less, but who cares, its more fun to include people. I don't recommend having more involved with the fight due to possible agro problems. The key is keeping at least 1 warrior alive and keeping the queen agro on him. Also keeping the clerics and casters out the AE is critical. 

Paladins involved in the fight are there only to help prevent prevent agro on clerics.
Imediatly translocate, and ban from future raids, any ranger that decides to stand with the clerics and see how much damage he can do with trueshot....
Once you kill the queen, its easy to keep the area clear pulling to her room. Keep an eye on the time and have everyone out of her room and ready for the fight with her 1 and 3/4 hours after she dies. Spawn time is suposed to be 2 hours, but she usually spawns about 10 min early for us.
GL and have fun.  =)
