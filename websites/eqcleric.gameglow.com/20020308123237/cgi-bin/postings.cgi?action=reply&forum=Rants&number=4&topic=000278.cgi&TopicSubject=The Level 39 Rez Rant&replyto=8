I have died once since 39, and I was quite pleased to get 50% of my exp back when I rezzed myself.<P>Today, I am in Dreadlands looking for a group. Someone shouts, 'Is anyone rezzing?' Since I'm not doing anything, I shout, "If you can do with a 50% rez, then I am".<P>Now, I don't expect everyone to go crazy over my 50% rez. Its nice, but I know at high levels you lose 8 hours of experience for dying. The difference between a 50% and 90% rez can be several hours. With that said, I am not offended when my rez is refused. I even do a /who on this person to first, if the person is over 50, I usually assume that person is in need of a 90% rez.<P>However this person says a minute later,<P>"Looking for 49+ rez"<P>I found this extremely rude. No, "Thanks Quotison, but since I lost a lot of experience in Level X, I am really looking for a 90% rez, but thanks for the offer."<P>I have spent 21 days playing this character to level 43. I am not a second rate cleric. If you don't want my rez, that's fine, but don't throw my rez aside as if it was useless. <P>------------------<BR><B><A HREF="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=42628" TARGET=_blank>Quotison Iachwer</A></B><BR>43rd Level Dwarven Cleric<BR>Tarew Marr Server</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#f7f7f7"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Islington</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Well it gets worse before it gets better.  After you get the 90% res, people are going to scoff at your 90% and look for the 96%.  Most levels, the differance is negligable but people still insist on that 96%.  THEN once you get the 96%, people will seek you out for it.  It doesn't matter if they have a 90% resser sitting right there at FM, they will still want your 96%.<P>------------------<BR>Quistil Angelwatch<BR>Templar of 59 Seasons in the service to the Great Mother Tunare<P>Islington Angelwatch <BR>Cavalier of 53 Seasons in the glorious service to Erollisi Marr</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#dedfdf"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Bindol</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">I'm not sure what you considered rude.

I also had many people just ignore my tells saying I could rez them at 50%.  I even had one guy tell me I was stupid for offering a 50% rez when he obviously needed a higher rez.

I didn't find out she was grouped with the level 50 cleric until after I had done the rez, or I would have refused.<P>Heard a story of a level 52 cleric traveling thru oot and hearing someone spam /shout with NEED 96 PERCENT REZ DUE TO BIND DEATHS.<P>Level 52 cleric offered to come and do the rez, but the person refused.

Perk interest of Clerics...hmmm maybe mine is good enough let me go out of my way to help this guy.  Right.  People ought to ask for what they want.<P>When I am non anon (which is 100% of the time) and I get asked for a rez they better darn well take it.  They know my level or can figure it out.  They most likely did a /w cleric to see who could rez in the first place.  So if they send me a tell asking for a rez and then find I don't have a high enough exp% to give back to them.  They just earned a quick log on the no rez list, no group list, possible ignore list, and buff any creature they are fighting list.  I can get mad on ocassion.</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#dedfdf"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Brenen</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">50% res is better then no res, but is really sucky to anyone over say 50+.

Why?  Because it gives me something for nothing (if I am not charged). A rez is not something you are automatically entitled to or even deserve.  Death brings a penalty and the fact that we are able to mitigate that penalty at all is very nice.  Restoring 50% after a death for who cares what reason is opportune.  90%...excelent and 96%...next to perfect.  But anyway you count the exp it is receiving something for nothing.<P>If I were to offer you a free Toyota Camry after your car just got wrecked would you decline it?  No way.  But if you thought there was a chance you could get a Dodge Viper instead you might hold out.  To me this is just GREED.  Take what you can get, move on, and enjoy the game.  We all want the best stuff but it isn't always going to happen and you will erk quite a few people along the way with your greed.</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#dedfdf"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Aerlin</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Ok, I am lvl 48.

The only time that stands out was once when I was doing several resses by the Ry'Gorr fort.  It was during off hours and I was the only cleric in the zone.  The only anon person in the zone was a druid (I knew this because she was standing right next to me).  There was a 35 ranger shouting for a 49+ res.  Since I couldn't do it at the time, I just kept silent.  On the other hand the 52 necromancer I ressed gave me 200pp.  I told him that was a bit excessive for only a 50% res, especially after he fed me his mana, but he insisted.  Some folks are nicer than others.<P>Aerlin, personally, I think the one you ressed was a fool.  5 dots is reasonable for a 50% res and the next time he wants one, you probably will be 49+.  What I would do if I was you is the next time he asked me for a res would be to inform him that I don't have the Divine Ressurrection skill up and ready for him and since he made such a big deal over the last time I helped him out, I wouldn't want him to settle for anything less than a perfect res.
