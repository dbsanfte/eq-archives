<TEXTAREA NAME="EditedMessage" ROWS=10 COLS=45 WRAP="VIRTUAL">The placeholder spawns every 3.5 hours.  It is standing under one of the platforms at the camp.  I didnt write down the exact loc when i was there, but i will try to describe it to you.  

The undead camp has several platforms just like the gnoll camp in lake rathe.  On the east side of the camp is a fallen platform.  if you stand with that one on your left, facing the camp, there are two standing platforms in front of you that are close together.  The righthand one is a little farther away from you, and is where you will find the placeholder.  There is no need to clear the whole camp. Killing the ph is all you need to do.  The placeholder is the only standing putrid skeleton you will see there.  There are also two putrids lying on the ground under or near the platform where the ph spawns.  

You might have to sit there for several hours to wait for it to spawn once so you will know the schedule. Then just bind there and gate back every 3 hours or so. (I gave myself a bit of extra time in case anyone else stopped by looking for grimrot) I started this camp out by actually sitting there, and it was insane.  I was much happier when i started setting the timer and gating back. 

I did this for a couple days, and when i finally got the dead grim to spawn, the live came up 3 hours later! I couldnt believe i was lucky enough to get back to back spawns and could stop hanging around sk.  

I had the help of a chanter to kill the live Grimrot.  The chanter tashed him, and his pet started working Grim over.  I sat back and healed the pet. I'm not sure how this would work at your level, but at 51 it worked just fine. Oh, and he will HT you from whatever distance.  My friend pulled from his maximum range and was harmtouched across several acres of south karana.  ;)

That gnoll you were wondering about is for a monk quest.  If you draw a circle around the camp, with that gnoll being at 12 o'clock, the fallen platform i mention for you to stand at and face the camp is at about 9 o'clock.
I hope that was helpful and not just confusing.  Send me a tell on Rallos if this isnt clear.

One word of warning, if you have been clearing the camp, you may well be KOS to the corrupt queynos guards now.  I know i am now, and i started out clearing the camp from boredom.  I havent been attacked in N Qeynos yet, but there is at least one watchman in NK who is a corrupt guard.  The other guards love me, he comes running to beat me up every time i run into him.  

Good luck with your Aegis, it is definitly worth the trouble.
