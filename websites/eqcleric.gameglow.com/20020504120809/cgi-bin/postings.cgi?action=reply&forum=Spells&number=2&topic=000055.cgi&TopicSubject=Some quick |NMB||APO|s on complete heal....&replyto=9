Ive been doing the suggested for along time now.... people look at me like im on crack with my rubi bp but I am never oom fast.  [IMG]http://www.kmrcs.com/eqcleric/ultbbs/ubb/wink.gif[/IMG] (And it all gets better when I get a regen on top of it). Cleric's hp regen also is so slow you often have to heal yourself, but now even with a sizeable scratch I let it regen up and not waste a gheal.

As for the stone compleat heal combo... its fine in situations where #1 you are casting symbols alot anyways... ie giants, dragons, PoF, lower guk camps where you know the spawns and know nothings gona trample you. its also more effective if you have a shaman who can cast altuna on you.[/B][/QUOTE]

A fully buffed Cleric can have about 1300hp at level 39. (This is a guess, since I have around 900 at level 31). If you mana stone yourself down to 100hp, you net 400mana. Complete heal takes 400mana (unless your specialize alteration processes). You break even.<P>But every level you gain past 39 allows more and more usage of a manastone with complete heal. With the level 44 buffs, I am sure you could have around 1600hp at level 44, netting yourself 500mana from your manastone. After a complete heal, this is 100mana more than you started with.<P>Now, what I am wondering: Is this really worth it? I mean, in the ammount of time you manastone yourself to death, then cast complete heal, couldn't you med back the 100mana and then some? I know that at level 31, I can cast a 90mana bravery and med it back in just a few seconds. As your meditation skill goes up, your mana comes back faster, right?<P>If these #'s are accurate (and please tell me if they are not), why do so many clerics swear by the manastone? I can see useing it here and there when you are full health and meding anyways, you might as well regain some HP's and get some free mana out of it. But to stone yourself down and cast complete heal just doesn't add up.<P>------------------<BR>Dikmer Orless<BR>Dwarf Cleric, 30th level<BR>High Priest of Holier Than Thou (Xegony)</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#f7f7f7"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Badaf</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Ive done this procedure.

There are certain items that can push your HP even higher.  A pair of rings from the reanimated hand in lower guk comes to mind (as well as many other hp and stm enhancing items).  So it's possible for one's hp to go even higher than 1900.<P>2. The boredom factor.  If you're soloing spectres, stoning down and healing up makes you feel like you're doing something productive.<P>3. Improve your alteration and specialize alteration skills.  Practicing your complete heal improves those skills :-)<P>Regards,<P>Darial<BR></FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#dedfdf"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Balddur</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Sure I can get around 1900 hps fully buffed, but that costs me 13 pp every time I do it (darn Peridots are expensive) and to me is just not worth it.

I read somewhere that you gain 1 mana per 10 meditation per tick (can anyone confirm this?). If so, in 17 ticks, you can gain back roughly 400 mana from straight meditating. <P>Again, WHY do some clerics swear by using this method?

When I hit my stone, I immediatley lose 60 hp and immediately get back 20 mana. I can lose hp and get mana just as fast as I can click the stone, barring lag and such. Also, if you're med is maxxed likely your specialize alter is also netting a bit more mana savings.

Let's assume that's  a 10% mana reduction and it hits most of the time. So now you've got +80 mana in 3 ticks, better than the 60 I'd get medding, assuming the 1 for 10:1<P>Plus, it makes me feel like I'm doing something  <IMG SRC="http://www.kmrcs.com/eqcleric/ultbbs/ubb/smile.gif"><BR>This isn't the real use of a stone though as some have said. Pack Regen/chloro is amazing for mana recovery as well as giving the pallys something to do with that new Gheal.

After 3 res he was OOM. What he did was used the mana stone regained a lot of mana then the other cleric healed him and did the mana stone again.

However there is a chance that all the new expansions and equipment nowadays might alter the conclusion from 99.<P>Question: Is manastone really worth it?<P>Facts:<BR>- Rightclick effect that converts 60hp into 20 mana (3 sec casting time)<BR>- You can only use it in old world but not in any planes or the revamped Cazic-Thule<P>The alternative way of getting back mana is to meditate. With maxed meditate skill you will get approx 20 mana/tick. Some people argue that youll get back mana much quicker by stoning your health down and then CH yourself. I cant see how tho. Lets say I am fully buffed with Heroism and Marzin and self buff.<P>Start HP: 2500<BR>Stone yourself down to 100hp. This will take 40*3 = 120 seconds.<BR>Complete Heal yourself. This will take 10 seconds.<P>So in 130 seconds you get 40*20 - 400(CH) = 400 mana back. Thats a ratio of 18 mana/tick. Thats even worse than just sitting down. I know some of you have a lot more hp lets say 3580. It will still not be more than maybe 25 mana/tick. Thats less than meditating with normal Clarity or manasong. I can see a difference if you got a Donals BP or someone else casting CH on you. But without them is it really worth the money to get a manastone?

I'll agree this is a complete waste.  The return for doing this.. as seen above is very small.  The only way it's worth it is if you have a donel's BP and can CH yourself for no mana every 8 mins... OR have someone else heal you.<P>The better use of the stone is to use it as you go.  By that I mean.. cast a spell then tap the stone a few times to get yourself close to FM and sit and get the rest back via med.  What your doing there is getting twice as much power by regening your hp and medding at the same time.  Using a fungi tunic and/or other regen items REALLY makes a hug diffrance.<P>Doing it this way I'm ALWAYS at 90% mana or better and dont' run the risk od stoning myself to death OR getting aggro off something when I'm at 100hp and dieing.

When I am soloing it just isn't practical, because I want<BR>to have very short spurts of 'low on life' status that I have<BR>complete control, and I tend to be dumping mana at a very fast<BR>pace.  So I need to get that back fast, so, ta-dah, Manastone down<BR>to 150 or so and CH back up.  Also great when you die in the old<BR>world.  I can be fully buffed and back full on mana in less than 3<BR>minutes with a stone.  Tons o fun.  <P>And the first few times lag gets you killed you learn how many times<BR>you can right click and live.  This is an important item to know..;-)<P>Gryfalia<BR>59 Templar of Brell<BR>Imperial Guards<BR>Druzzil Ro<BR></FONT></TD></TR></TABLE>
