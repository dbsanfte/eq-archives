Yes its a nice change for those on a higher end, but he should flat out be non-kos period end of story and have to be engaged.

In its current state, they effectively destroyed every kael arena raid for many guilds.

In any event, this is a very poor and upsetting move that will hurt a HUGE majority of players that try to get better armor for their guilds via kael arena.<P>What the heck is verant thinking?<P>Aladain</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#f7f7f7"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Qwenya</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">I think the idol was a good idea as a trigger for the AoW.  Too many guilds would want Vindi/Statue but not the AOW.  That left other guilds who did want the AOW with a missed opportunity.  I do agree though that the placement of the idol will make the arena non doable for those servers where there is no one to attempt the AoW.  I am thinking however there are not too many where he will be up for any length of time though.  Perhaps they chould move the Idol back in the temple where the Statue is but grief players capable of killing statue and not interested in AOW would still kill him.  <P>They did make him non KoS to everyone even though he scowls.  He is like a banker in a KoS city and will not attack if on his own.  He does however seem to have some social agro issues and jumps in if you get too close pulling the giants, like you said.  <P>Not sure how they could change this.  They purposely made him a pain and with no loot so griefers who can kill statue will not kill him to block others out of an AoW try.<P>Qwenya<P>------------------<BR> <A HREF="http://www.clubfu.com/view_player.php?uid=44" TARGET=_blank>http://www.clubfu.com/view_player.php?uid=44</A><p>[This message has been edited by Qwenya (edited 02-15-2002).]</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#dedfdf"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Gello</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">No idea about Kael, but there were a ton of changes to high end mobs with the last patch.  A guild on our server that's managed to kill Tormax and clear NToV prior to patch failed on Lendiniara the Keeper after patch *boggle*.  Guilds/alliances just on the verge of entering the very high end game had an enormous setback this patch.  <IMG SRC="http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/frown.gif">  Verant did this before our first solo attempt at Klandicar too, punks.  Gets old but we'll roll with it.  I'm sure it helps the crowding of the very high end mobs but it doesn't address the lack of content for the booming number of L60's.</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#f7f7f7"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Darianne</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><BR>Before I bitch, I'd like some clarification  <IMG SRC="http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/smile.gif"><P>Are you saying, that the arena cannot be done... eg:  Single group xp, small guild raids, on just the Arena including Kalis (sp?) and the Protectors?<P>Or are you saying, that you can't do past the icewall (Vindi/Guardians/etc...) without agroing the idol?<P>If this screwed up, your every day Arena raid... IMHO, then this was a change for the worst (and quite possibly an accident on Verants part).   The arena is a great training 'raid ground' for many small guilds, learning to work together... and its almost always packed on Quellious, so its made good use of too.<P>Note:  I'm not saying you need a raid to do the arena, I'm saying its a good learning ground, and you can "raid" it without being an uber guild.
