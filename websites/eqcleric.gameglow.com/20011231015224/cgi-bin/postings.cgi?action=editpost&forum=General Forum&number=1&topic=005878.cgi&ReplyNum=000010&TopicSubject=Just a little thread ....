Metrech, 
I think you are not thinking it our correctly when you say simply give it to pallys and necros. I think it is much like the 'meta-ability' of reducing the number of active MOBs in an encounter. As you can see from my above post, that ability is shared by all casting classes (except magicians!) including all hybrids. 

So I can name the following meta abilities within EQ:

1. Healing - shared by Clerics, shaman, Druid, Paladin, Ranger, Necromancer, Shadowknight, enchanter, few items.
2. Active MOB reduction (root, mez, lull) - Shared by all casters except magician.
3. High Rate damage (DD, DoT) - All casters.
4. XP recovery (rez) - Clerics, and to a lesser degree Paladins
5. Relocation expedience (port, faster running) - Druids, Wizards, Shaman, Rangers, Bards, SoW potions, JBoots.
6. Melee Effectiveness Improvement (haste) - Enchanters, Shaman, Bards, and a number of items. 
7. HP improvement (HP buffs) - Clerics, Druids, Shaman, Paladins, Rangers, enchanters. 

As we can see the important ability which is least shared is XP recovery, the 2nd least Melee Effectiveness (haste) which is only shared by 3 classes (however there are items which reduce the strain on this ability, perhaps it should also be looked at). 

XP recovery is controlled by (basically) one class. It is the only important meta ability which is so concentrated. This is the crux of the problem.

Sound stupid? Yes it does, just as stupid as your request to remove res.

BTW.. Post your real server and player name so we know not to res/port/sow/clarity/heal/buff you since these all reduce downtime and aid in faster XP unbalancing the game :P

Slayer97,
Yo, tard! Can you make my point any better?

SoW is shared by many classes, druid, shaman, ranger. Futher, somewhat affordable SoW potions have been added to the game. Further, JBoot are actually attainable!

Also metrech ALREADY gave you his real name! Do you have some serious learning disability?

Finally, you are making my point exactly when you attempt to threaten (THE WRONG PERSON) with no more Rezes from your class. 

Yeash.

If Verant were to give Resurrection to the two other priest classes, they would either have to make their hit point buffs use a reagent or remove the reagent on the Cleric symbol line or have it be very rarely used. Verant depends on Clerics symboling people to act as a cash sink, and Clerics depend on income from Resurrections to afford the reagents in the first place. I personally would be just as happy if they did give the spell out to the other priest classes, but people could pay for their own reagents. I dislike charging for Resurrections (being a cash hungry mercenary wasn't the reason I created a Cleric). To avoid this, I have sold (cash only, no trades ) most of the droppable loot I have received the last five or so levels. Other items have been given away gratis to those in need (and those that didn't want to twink but prefered to beg). Take my Resurrection spell, but take my reagent expenses too. I would be happier not spending the vast amounts of time I spend doing Resurrections, and wealthier at the same time. 
Road_Kill, it is people such as yourself that use "fighting words" without the risk of a fight that make me think twice about being helpful. I do always worry that I might accidentally help someone like yourself. Yes, that means if I knew who you were, I would boycott Resurrecting you. I would even explain to other Clerics I know why I had added you to that very short list. Perhaps that proves EvilChu's point, but I don't think so. The same people that Clerics refuse to res are usually boycotted by others for other reasons. I have seen such people drop out of sight within a few months. I don't think it was just a Resurrection boycott by a few Clerics that did it though.

Benelorn,

?? Really? To hear it from the people on the message board, all clerics spend all of their time going from zone to zone rezing people out of the goodness of their heart. How strange that verant would expect this to be a method by which clerics would be able to afford the reagents to their symbol line. 

And trying to suggest that one spell line should be overpowered/horded by one class becuase they have another line of spells which is costly, is, well, about as idiotic an argument as I have ever seen.

> Road_Kill, it is people such as yourself that use "fighting words" 

1st, boo hoo. 
2nd go re-read me posts, I flamed, when 1st flamed. Too bad that my flames were better than his. Ahh the price of being talented.

Boo hoo. I wonder if this helps make my argument? Hmmm?

What are you saying? I just don't see it? Are you saying that rez makes people quit? Or are you saying that, I don't know, that I'll pay. If it's I'll play ... BWHAHHAAHHAAH you must be kidding.

Regardless of your lack of class and manners, you do come close to the truth Road_kill. Ressurections let verant go crazy with the amount of exp loss post 50, and need not look back. They simply assumed that everyone post 50 could, with little difficulty, attain a ress everytime they died. Yes, if ressurection was not in the game, then the exp loss would most definitely not have been nearly as high in the post 50 game as it is now. 
However, try to think a little beyond your 4 tiny walls and ask yourself, if verant did in fact remove all exp resses, would they actually lower the exp loss to 4% of what it is today?

Now with the number of available clerics and whatever else verant thought to use in determining the experience loss post 50, they made it what it is today. If 3 times (and it would actually be more then that since druids+shaman easily make up much more than 3 times the cleric population on my server, and likely alot of others) the amount of people were able to ressurect, what do you think they would do to the amount of exp loss per death?

It would do nothing but make people even more dependent on ressurections. You can argue that the spell never should have existed, but can you truly imagine the impact its removal would have in today's EQ?

A likely comparison would be to remove wizard/druid teleports. Everyone could still get around, it would just take exponentially longer to get from point A to point B. Its pretty much the same thing with resses...you could still get from level X to level Y, it would just take exponentially longer.

Road_Kill Said:
Clerics are, IMO, the bane of EQ. They were given two spells that were CLEARLY out of WACK: Complete Heal, and the REZ line. If these two spells were removed from the game (other than the 29 rez, that one makes sense) EQ would be a much better place. 
------------------------------------

Ask that to every single person reguardless of class in the high level game if they agree with you. I think you would be suprised at their answers. Considering there are encounters in this game that Verant has said MANY times were designed with complete heal in mind, these are all now rendered improssible. Considering you have a 4,000 HP warrior that engages a mob that doubles for 500 (a difficult, but not "DANG HARD VELIOUS EPIC" mob) and goes on 20 rampages, and gets enraged (have you even experenced a rampage/enrage of a mob?), I would like you to explain to me how a healer of ANY class is expected to keep up. By the time my complete heal is done from being started with the warrior at full health, the warrior is close to death. WHAT do you, or other people that think complete heal is too powerful suggest we do? I've been waiting to ask this for awhile, we keep getting told by anti-clerics that complete heal is too powerful, but not one of you have been able to come up with an answer on HOW we can keep others alive with these encounters! If someone tells me to divine light over and over, well, ok, I can cast that 4.5 second cast time for 910 HP; 350 mana a max of 7 times at the level I am now. I am healing him a maximum of 6,370 HP. Well, thats about 10-12 seconds of damage for that mob, so the 4.5 second cast time prevents me from even getting 7 of these off in time for the warrior to live.

Have you ever lost every single person on a plane raid but happened to have *1* cleric that was able to camp out in time? Is this what makes the cleric too powerful that he can login and res others, and continue where they left off? If you think this is too powerful, then what if that cleric had died? Now, in your scenerio, the necro is too powerful, because he can get everyones corpse back safe and sound via a summon corpse. What if they strip that from necros/SKs? Now you will have pissed off the necro community more, and when you die in the planes, your corpse is pretty much lost, unless you all bought those 250pp soulstones, find a wiz to port back up, get someone to drag EACH corpse whereever and how deep they are to the portal, and port folks up to loot, and pray you dont get agroed on. What do you consider more fun?

As for the original poster (Who has been anti-cleric in nearly all his past posts relating to cleric issues), I find it interesting that there are 3 classes in this game that can res. One to 96 percent, one to 93 percent, and one to 90 percent, yet there are only two classes that can group port. Where's your post there?

---- Road_Kill Said ----
Rez totally mucks up the risk vs. reward at higher levels. The 49 Rez was a mistake (90 percent XP), and it backed verant into a corner wrt. higher levels. Due to the existance of 90+% XP rezes, verant HAD to inflate the death penalty. 
--------------------------------------------
1. From what I understand (Please correct me if I'm wrong), the only time verant changed the death penalty percentage was when they HALVED it.

2. If what you say is true, and verant was backed in a corner with the 49 XP res, why did they give Necros one that gives 93 percent, and clerics a better one that gives 96 percent, then AFTER kunarks release, proceeded to give Paladins the 90 percent res at level 59? I think if verant was backed into a corner, they would have avoided these additions.

--- Road Kill said: ---------------------
No little child. They are for you, in that YOU have the power to decide who you wish to give them to and who you do not wish to give them to. 

Yup I agree. Boy, I'm sure glad that they gave that ability to one class. The game revolves around risk/reward, yet only one class in the game (two above 55) has the ability around which it is balanced. Sounds pretty reasonable.

Oy! Are you trying to tell me that there is a spell around which encounters must be balanced, because it is so powerful? Jeeze. That sounds pretty uber important. I hope that we give that to a lot of classes. 

Again, are you saying that one spell series, which is basically owned by one class, is the spell which enables high level play! 
-----------------------------------------
Paragraph 1 reply: Kind of like group ports, summoned corpses, etc?

Paragraph 2 reply: This proves you are not posting while thinking correctly. There are *3* classes in the game capable of ressing, cleric, necro, and paladin. The necro res comes at level 53, and is a 93 percent rez, 3 percent better than the best a cleric can do until level 56.

Paragraph 3 reply: Encounters are balanced around a TON of spells. Rez / CH being two of them. Verant, as you might have noticed is INCREASING mob strength (Yelinak anyone?), and is doing NOTHING to help your point. Why's that cleric's fault. Want CH and res removed? Sure - make level 63 mobs single hit for a max of 125, but also remove shamans slow, enchanters/bard mez, etc. Then we've got balance with the cleric (in YOUR view), but have effectively destroyed other classes.

Paragraph 4 reply: I would say thats a somewhat accurate statement though I feel encounters and raids are balanced with SEVERAL spells. You wont go on a raid without warriors. You wont go on a raid without chanters. You wont go on a raid without a monk. The only way to remove rez from the lineup, you would have to *GREATLY* decrease mob strength. Did you know that the some of the best and biggest guilds in all of EQ have a hard time taking down velious ubermobs even through they bring 8-10+ clerics? Some mobs all the clerics go OOM, and the mob has over half his health, not to mention he hasn't enraged yet. Can you please elaborate on how you would propose these mobs to be changed? Please go in detail on how you would handle summoning, rampages, and enraged mobs. I'd be interested in whether you think these should be removed, or what?

The intent of the game is to make it such that each player MUST depend on another to excell. It is possible to solo, but to truly conquer the greater challenges of the game you MUST work with others. No one class, and certainly no single player can do what a well rounded group or series of groups can do.

Clerics are the only class that can do anything to remedy the damage done by linkdeaths. If you're kiting at 51 and go linkdead and die, you don't need a corpse summoned.

And druids are the only class in the game capable of changing the game ENVIRONMENT. Whats your point?

-----------------------------------------

Sylk - Your post was fantastic and on key. As a level 55 cleric myself, I enjoy him to this day for the ability I have to help people. The non-existant ability I have to protect myself doesn't bother me.

---- ArchEngel said: ----
After all, it lessens the consequence of death and, in theory, gives clerics the power to boycott the rest of the EQ citizens.

I do not think that clerics as a whole will ever boycott resurecting people.
---------------------------------------

Paragraph 1 reply: If clerics were the only class that could res, and if those said clerics were foolesh enough to boycott their services to those in need, your statement holds true.

Paragraph 2 reply: You are correct. Most people (there are some excluded) created clerics to help people. I wouldn't dream of boycotting people as a whole - because I wouldnt get the satisfaction of helping people - but you can bet I'll boycott people that were hateful to me in my EQ past. I'll boycott people like EvilChu and Road_Kill, since they have pretty much stated that our services are not needed by them. 

---- Metrech said: ----
CH has a very large mana-efficiency, ESPECIALLY when you have a very high hitpoint tank (read fatty warrior). The higher the hitpoints of the tank, the more mana-efficient the spell becomes. 
-----------------------------------
Upon EQ's release, a level 50 INT based caster with 100 in +mana items, and 200 int had a mana pool of: 2200 (2100 int, 100 for +mana items).

Upon EQ's release, a level 50 warrior weilding 2 yaks (8/24) would be able to do 14.06 damage per second, not counting procs or Haste.

Today - a level 60 INT based caster with 100 in +mana items, and 200 int had a mana pool of: 2620 (2100 int, 100 for +mana items). This is a 16 percent increase in efficiency.

Today - a warrior weilding his epic in 1HS mode. He is doing 24.16 damage per second, not factoring in ANY haste nor factoring in any procs. This is a 72 percent increase in efficiency.

Do we say that melee's are overpowered? Don't forget, warriors are not the best damage dealers.

Road_Kill, what I meant is that ninja-looters and all around jerks tend to have trouble getting anything from anyone and tend to leave within a few months. You started out sterio-typing Clerics as threatening to boycott anyone's resurrection over nerfs being common on the Cleric sites. There have been a few posts along those lines, but mostly the people boycotting resurrections are doing it because the class they are playing instead of the Cleric they gave up on can't cast the spell.
I am not justifying Verant giving Clerics Resurrections due to the symbol line, I am explaining why it either won't change or will involve other changes. I truly wouldn't be upset if the Resurrection line were given out provided the cash sinks were given out as well (as in give the other priest classes the symbol line if they are given Resurrection. The two spell lines really go together). Crying? Not me, I don't play much anymore (nerf this nerf that, too few Clerics around to share the Resurrection duties making it more work than play. I camp in for a half hour to say "Hi" to friends and end up spending a couple of hours ressing. No thank you.). The reagents and cash I have on my character will probably last a month or two by which time I hope to move to greener pastures.

You? Talented? Using terms like "little boy" and "Boo hoo." at all, let alone repeatedly, are hardly the mark of a rapier sharp wit. More like the marks of an adolescent going through the stress of puberty.

I think I understand the point about resurrection throwing off the risk vs. reward. However, that's only the beginning. After all, if a character receives the 96% res, it is still _some_ penalty.
Being able to move faster changes the whole balance, as it allows people to avoid the risk altogether. Ports allow this as well.
Also, movement-impairing spells give the PCs a chance to get away. Root and Snare come to mind, as do any spells or abilities that have the chance to Stun.
Any spell that lets you avoid damage altogether is right out... this includes the Divine Aura and Rune series. I think there are more, but I'm not sure.
Anyone fighting anywhere near a zone line is obviously intending to exploit it to adjust the risk vs. reward.

So, in addition to removing the res line, Verant MUST also remove ANY spell that can help a character survive a fight. Any increase in the chance of survival obviously throws the whole risk vs. reward balance out the window.

>While obviously an exaggeration, I do see Georgia's point. Without ONE class, and their ability to Rez, I would be MUCH lower level. Can I say this about any other spell series in the game, perhaps SoW, but at least Verant has given that to 2.5 classes (rangers count for half, since they are a hybrid and not as common, and because it comes at 30), AND they have added AFORDIABLE SoW potions, AND they have added JBoots. <
THREE classes can resurrect. If you want, I can explain this to you since you're obviously not intelligent enough, or even high level enough to realize this. Necromancers, Paladins, AND Clerics can resurrect... clerics just get it earlier than the said classes. Should Rangers be crying now because they don't get SoW at 14 like druids?? I think not. On another note, corpse summoning is handled by one class... the necromancer... Again, I wouldn't expect you to know this as you have obviously proven yourself to be a lower level player.


>Again, are you saying that one spell series, which is basically owned by one class, is the spell which enables high level play! Wow. That just sounds wrong. Doesn't it!<

No, I'm saying one spell series is owned by three classes. It doesn't enable high level play, as it is limited... meaning, it costs 700 mana to cast, then two minutes for resurrection effects to wear off. You probably have never been resurrected so how about I explain this for you? When you are resurrected, your health drops to two bubbles, your mana pool is drained, and your stats are all red. Not to mention you are encumbered and cannot move immediately after you were summoned to your corpse.

Explain to me again how this is overpowering? It seems to me that you do not understand this spell line and you do not understand that without it, Verant's perfect little risk vs. reward high-end game would not function. Three classes have the ability to hold this spell. This spell line has been present in pen & paper RPGs for a long time. It is present in almost all roleplaying games and MUDs. You wouldn't realize this, as you are not old enough to remember or even know of these games. 

Please play the 50+ game before you make another post. With each and every post, you have proven yourself to be completely and utterly lost. I haven't proven your fact... I've disproven it. Unless you want some more stoning by the higher level players, you should probably quit posting your fantasy dribble, as the spell line will never be removed.... why you ask? Because three classes (Necromancers, Paladins, and Clerics) will leave the game. Flat out. I would not stay in this game or even go on raids and hunt in groups without the possibility of receiving a resurrection. Experience loss is too great in the 50+ game. 

You think losing your 1 hour of work at level 25 is bad??? No no, think again when you're level 57 and die with an unressed death only to have to deal with the fact that the past 40 hours of experience grinding in Old Sebilis is gone for good. Oh yes, you'll enjoy this MUCH when you get into the higher end game and then you'll kick yourself for not having a resurrection. 

Poor poor, sad little boy..............

2nd - You're an idiot. We're talking about game balance here, not some sort of vendetta against clerics. We're mad at VERANT not at clerics. We are not saying "leave the death penalty as is AND remove Rez" we're saying "Rez is unbalanced because only Clerics (and to a lesser extent Paladins) can give FREE XP-RESSES (Necros don't actually give free resses - from my understanding they take xp from one person and give it to another). How many Paladins do you think there are at high levels compared to Clerics? 1:10 ratio maybe? 1:100 ratio maybe? That's why roadkill is saying that clerics have a virtual monopoly on ressing.

Benelorn & Jwbal - as opposed to Roadkill I'm not saying remove rez, I'm saying give it to more people at a lower level. Heck make potions that can rez that you can quest like the Thurgadin gate potion. There's a money sink for you to free up excess plat from the economy.

I've suffered many many deaths where there just weren't any clerics around to res me. I play on the test server and guk is often empty - let alone kunark dungeons. Believe me, xp resses would have been nice then. 

uber_cleric01 - yes, doesn't it suck that Verant has made Velious mobs so tough that you have to have three clerics chain-casting CH on the fattie tank in order to survive the battle. Just think how much easier that mob would have to be if they removed CH from the game. You'd actually have OPTIONS on how to kill mobs. Casters might actually be USEFULL in high-level xp encounters instead of poor substitutes for the high-damage melee classes. But don't let me start ranting about that!

Oh and uber-cleric01 - i'd give teleporting to more classes too, or heck, make teleport portals on each continent so I didn't have to TAKE THE STUPID BOAT ALL THE TIME. And I'm a bard, so travelling by running is not so bad for me. Can anyone say "put the firepots in freeport"?

One more for uber_cleric01 - doesn't the 93% Necro res cost someone else xp? Or am I totally off base on this one. 

Heck let me ask you all a question - how many necro resses have you ever had? None? I bet 99% of players will say none.

Heck - ANOTHER uber_cleric01 response - Melee classes (especially rogues and warriors) are FAR too powerful at high levels. Or should I say Verant has made the high HP mobs in SoV too strong such that the high-damage melee types become NECESSARY and the caster-classes become USELESS. Does that sound balanced to you? Not to me, either. Why did this come about? CH-Tank. Say no more.

Arvor - your post is missing the point, although I realize you meant it as sarcasm. Rezzes are a problem, as is CH, because they're on too few classes - not because they help. They're unbalancing and have totally distorted the high-level game.

Georgia_Everlore - although you seem to think Roadkill is an idiot, I think that you have failed to understand the basic premise of what he is saying. He's not saying "take away res and leave the xp penalty as is" because that is too much damage control in the hands of too few people. If you were to take away res, he would want the death penalty reduced to like 4%. At least that's my impression of his argument.

Try to understand that we're talking about BALANCE here - not nerfing for the sake of nerfing.

ACK STOP THE INSANITY
Ressurections are NOT a right. They are a privilage. Is a dead person required to get a res? Nope. Will eliminating Ressurections stop the high level game, nope.

Face it resses are a BONUS they are NOT a be all and end all. What if they took out jboots, sow and all teleport spells because they are unbalancing. After all they arent required. They make life easier just like ressurection so they must be nerfed.

And besides ressurection has been nerfed MULTIPLE TIMES.
The first time was when they REDUCED the death penalty by 50%. Most of you newbies have no recollection of this but during the first 6 months of the game the death penalty was TWICE what it was now in terms of experience loss. I remember loosing a WHOLE BUBBLE OF EXPERIENCE AT LEVEL 15!!!! People who played after that period are spoiled. They think that the death penalty is unbalance when infact it has been reduced.

My character wore bronze armor up to his mid 30!! Wanna know why? It was the best thing short of rubicite and the no drop planar armor. There was no 20+ ac armor aside from planes. No quest armor such as crafted. 

And plate armor was highly valued whether it was bronze or not. And you know what? I was proud to wear that armor because it was at least decent.

Nowadays i hear people complaining that their new armor is only 20+ ac on their rogue and it makes me sick to think of how spoiled some people are with the expansions!!!

Please remove Road_Kill's posts until he can post with manners. Road_Kill is very offensive and imo should be banned from posting. I read these boards to learn and understand, but with offensive dribble such as Road_Kill's it is just annoying. I feel Road_Kill has the right, as we all do, to express our opinions, but not like Road_Kill has expressed them here in this post.

let me guess.. you want druids to have rez now.... take away CH, give druids rez and what will be a clerics defining spell? True North maybe?
just another druid wanting to be a cleric....

If you want to be able to rez, make a cleric...

you are jealous of not having all the spells of every class given to druids, you already got our heals just short of CH....

troll and whine someplace else

Verant as stated that CH and Rez are THE defining spells of a cleric and no one else should get them... oh wait, they already gave them away....

i am sure that if you get enough druids to complain about this, you will eventually get it... then start on melee abilities.. 

pretty soon we will all be druids

resistance is futile.. you will become part of the wolf pack

Do some folks just wake up in the morning and try to figure out what they could post that would tick the maximum number of people off? It certainly seems as if that's the case, and particularly with clerics (quite possibly the single most boring class to play in EQ) over the last few months. 
This game isn't being created from scratch; implementing the changes that some of the posters in this thread want would require a total redesign of the experience accumulation and loss system, as well as high end encounters (as those who aren't prone to calling other posters names have conceded). Making rez only the 29 revive ability to summon you to your corpse, and giving it to several classes, makes sense ONLY if the death penalty is removed. Then all you have lost by death is time, and all you gain by rez is time savings. 

Back when Verant changed the effect on the Donal's breastplate one point Verant itself made was that high end mobs in Velious had been implemented and tuned with the abilities of the Donal's assumed, and Verant felt this was wrong because no one item should dictate how they implement mobs. However, when the effect on the breastplate was changed, Verant did NOT go back and re-tune those mobs.

Suggesting major changes to one key ability around which other parts of this game have been balanced NEVER works out the way the suggestor thinks it will -- if the suggestion is implemented at all, no counter-balancing changes are ever made. So pie-in-the-sky suggestions which might be applicable to the next "great game" are all well and good; trying to shoehorn them into this one never works. All that is accomplished in most cases is nothing (except an invective-filled thread like this one).

That's not the vision, chief. The vision is that there be a compelling reason to play each class, a vision which you helped erode by convincing them to give the class-defining high-level cleric combat heals to other priest classes.

You see, the entire point is that people are compelled to play clerics and enchanters because they ARE measurably more powerful than the other support classes in most in game situations. This is Brad's own definition of unbalanced, and it applies perfectly to clerics and enchanters. 
What the clerics are trying to HIDE, is the simple undeniable FACT, that the only metric of power that means a thing in EQ is the ability to minimize risk and increase reward. And they are indeed wildly overpowered compared to their peers. Knowing how EQ works today, post-Kunark, post-Velious, you would be very unwise (and I'm being gracious here) to play any support class but a cleric or enchanter unless your guild already has enough to supply every group with one of each.

Yeah i had a full suit of steel armor before the cleric quest armor was implemented (which was later nerfed by removing their no drop tag)
I loved my look. I looked virtually identical to the cleric guildmaster and it felt great. Back then ganking on Rallos was at a minimum and rare so i could actually wear the armor and you know what? I never lost a single peice of it.

Thats how everquest was portrayed to us as a world where the equipment didn't make all the difference there was always decent alternatives to most every armor. Sure you might not have steel but bronze is easy to get so youll be good.

Now everquest has turned into a big lootfest and its disgusting. There is no point to the game anymore. Everytime you play its. What do you want to camp today or Where do you want to exp today, or even lets go up to the plane and hope that xxx drops but unfortunately verant nerfed the drops to next to nothing but we can still hope

-----------------------------------
The only way in my posts I've justified CH is because of these type of mobs in kunark/velious. I *FULLY* agree with you *AND* implied that in my post (which I think you might have missed) that if CH was removed from the game, fine - then have level 63 mobs hit for 125, dont become enraged, dont summon, etc etc. UNTIL those mobs are fixed, CH cannot be removed for the sheer fact that these encounters were designed around that single spell. There is no other spell in the game that can keep up with a fatty warriors health when hes getting beat on with these mobs. Is that why CH is so super-uber powerful? Certainly. Is that the clerics fault? Heck no. It is the pure, and utter stupidity of Verant, and their creation of these kunark / Velious encounters, AND this is the VERY REASON this spell cannot be removed from the game.

I wouldn't. I'm very content on paying a fellow player wages for using his teleport services. What you are doing is justifying giving rez out because you didnt have to "Lose that stupid experence all the time", at the same time, waiting to give porting out so you dont have to "Take that stupid boat all the time". At least, thats what I'm gathering here. I feel the day clerics get to port / sow, or the like, I feel EQ will have hit the rock bottom. Same thing if a 4th class gets to rez... then a 5th.

-------------------------------------

Yes it does. Ask a level 60 if he cares. Also, I've had 2 necro resurrections, not for the sake of "wanting the maximum exp back" either. The necro can get you out of two key situations in this game. They can summon your corpse to safety, and they can feign death. Take a raid gone bad, but the necro survived because he feigned and was able to res a cleric, so it could continue instead of having an insanely difficult CR (Which by all means, I would rather die non-rezzable deaths than lose all my gear), spend 150pp per coffin on 40 coffins (6000pp) (And the travel time to get them), necros spending 700 mana to summon 40 corpses (Thats 13 manabars on a level 50 necro). This is a large part why the necro res is as expensive as it is. Its a INTENSE lifesaver/raidsaver because of his ability to feign.

---------------------------------------
I appreciate all the chances to reply . You are blaming clerics and warriors for the CH-Tank combo for what the game is today. Whats funny is you're close - but not quite there. There is ONE type of class in the game thats unbalanced. My point I was making in my other post is *ALL* casters (Cleric included) have had no change EVER to their mana pool. WIS/INT has had a 200 cap FOREVER, +mana items have NEVER been common. The most I've ever heard someone have while sustaning 200 int/wis is 450 in +mana items, giving him a mana pool of about 3000. The best a caster can be is about 20 percent more effective TODAY than he was since the release of EQ with the exception of pet classes, they are maybe 25 percent more effective. Enter Melee - They are 70-80, and even up to over 100 percent more effective since the release of everquest. At their will, they can become 25 percent less effective by swapping one item out - or they can increase their effectiveness 25 percent by winning one item. They can increase their effectiveness an additional 30-40 percent by having one spell cast on them, or get one item not even related to their weaponry that makes them more effective. Because of this, mobs were designed around their unreal jump, twist, and control in overall power. Also because of this, the only classes that were made relevant were the ones to "support" the melee classes (Who totally and completely dominate the power shift in EQ). Obviously they need healed, so Clerics/Druids/Shamans are needed, but because verant designed warriors to be able to have close to 5,000 HP at level 60, you really need the best healer of them all since the other 2 classes have a hard time keeping up. Druids can damage shield / sow / snare to support by causing extra damage (DS) based on when melees get hit, SOW so they can pull more effictively, and snare so they dont run. Shaman can slow which gives support to meeles by reducing the mob attack speed by 75 percent (I wish this could be used on those boss mobs) and give insane stat buffs, increasing melee effictiveness even more. Enchanters can haste/clarity which will greatly speed up the melee's attack, and the clarity keeps the support classes going for less downtime. They also can prevent the melees from getting hit by more than one mob at a time. Bards are needed in a pinch when those other support classes are unavailable, as they can do everything listed above, but to a lesser extent (though I dont think they can slow a mob, please correct me if I'm wrong). What does say a wizard do to support the melee class? Nothing. What does say a necro do to support the melee class? Nothing. What does a mage do to support the melee class? Nothing, except maybe provide them with arrows to pull better. See what I'm getting at?

While you blame the CH-Tank *COMBO* as the reason all other classes are "useless", you need to take a look at who kills the mob, and who damages the mobs, and who are the classes that have had their effectiveness raised by over 70 percent since release. ALL the casters (Cleric/Mage/Necro/Wizard/etc) have NEVER had any change to the mana formula, and its always remained the same upcurve.

Resurrection is too powerful an ability for one or two classes to have! Nerf it!
Complete Heal is too powerful an ability for one class to have! Nerf it!

SoW makes soloing possible/safer for many classes, not to mention travel time reduction. Having an ability that alone makes classes able to solo relatively safely, if at all, is obviously overpowering for just a few classes to have! Nerf it!

Summon Corpse allows for a huge reduction of difficult corpse recovery time. It also allows people to get their corpses out of places where they would be unable to get them otherwise. Loss of all of your items is often a far worse penalty than lost EXP so this ability can be even more powerful than Resurrection and only 2 classes get it! Nerf it!

Pets allow a very few classes to do things that would otherwise require a warrior or other Melee class to do. This is obviously overpowering and, unless melees are to get pet casters to follow them around, needs to be Nerfed!

Lure spells allow one class to be the only class to magically damage some creatures. Obviously overpowering and in need of the big Nerf!

Call of the Hero! Need I say more!?! Clearly unbalancing! Nerf!

Evacuation Spells? Only 2 classes can save a group for a certain-death situation?!? Nerf!

(Insert arguments here for: Snare, Harmony, Feign Death, Sneak/Hide, Backstab, Evade, Dual Wield, Double Attack, Crits/Crips, Disciplines (especially defensive), Teleports, big HP buffs, Group mana-regen enhancement abilities, High AC, Crowd control abilities, Lifetaps, Harm Touch, Lay on Hands, HP Regen buffs, Invulnerability spells, etc.)

I guess when we look at the big-picture, all classes are overpowered and need some serious nerfs!

Hmm, how did I konw that this thread, at some point in time, would go from Clerics are to Uber with res to other healers should have it also so we are balanced.
Res is the single class defineing ability of the cleric class. It is already shared with Paladins and Necros (albeit Necros have a weird way of doing it)

Frankly, I'd be very very surprised if they have ever seriously considered giveing that ability to Druids or Shaman
