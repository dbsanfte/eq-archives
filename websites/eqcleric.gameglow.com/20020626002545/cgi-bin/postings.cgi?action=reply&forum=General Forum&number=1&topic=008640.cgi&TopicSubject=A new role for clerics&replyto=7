[B]"And how about a spell that lets you port back to your temple when you get to level 20... oh wait... we were slapped down hard with that one."

Um, I can port to my home temple...it cost me a few plat to buy my faithstone, but I can do it.


"We've all wanted Sanctuary to work like it does in D&D. You cast it, and things just dont' attack you. Would be easy, too, cause you could just make it work like invis, but players can see you."

I think our Divine Aura/Barrier is supossed to take this spells place.

"There really should be some level of cross-over spells for clerics in the way of deity specific spells. Apart from Embue spells, there really is no difference between a cleric of the All Mother and a cleric of Hate. Not much, mind you, but enough that being a cleric of the deity give you something different. Curses for the evil gods, nature spells for Tunare worshipers, enchanting clay and steel for Brell worshippers, etc"

I agree here. But don't give meBrell worshippers enchant ore and clay. That messes with enchanters too much. Give me something new...like a REALLY nice root (maybe term it boots of stone or earth to mud, make it temporary, fixed duration unbreakable) or perhaps a nice strength stamina combo buff. Not one that out does a shaman...maybe one for 20pts of both...that lasts a long time. And is high level...so when shaman are buffing it for say like 45 each...we can only do half that.

"I'm uninterested in anything that makes the cleric class better at soloing undead. I don't solo. I hate soloing."
I glad you shared. Now let me mention to you...you aren't alone in your feelings HOWEVER Clerics by definition should be able to solo undead...fairly effectively. Whether you choose to use this ability is up to you, but it should be available.

On Veeshan there are so many uber guilds killing uber mobs that often on EXP days we simply have too many clerics, especially when you factor in bots. I get a group because uber guilds don't need many enchanters, and I 2-box an enchanter...but I see a lot of clerics lately begging for groups. They need to either be able to solo...or get an edge soemwhere.

We do need something to improve our solo'ing and also our one-dimensionalness. My powers on a raid are fine, my powers in a group are slowly diminshing (when ac of tanks amkes mobs do minor dmg) while verant ups the raid healing of other classes. I never really had much of a solo ability, I can do it..but it's certaintly not efficent.[/B][/QUOTE]

That gives you the chance to re-roll something that doesn't go the way you want it.  EQ Clerics have that in an extremely limited capacity in terms of the spells that might save a character from death.  But they're way underpowered and too expensive to make them remotely useful.<P>An extension on this might be blessings which could, randomly, prevent some damage up to a certain amount.  Randomly go off to prevent a bad spell from affecting you.  And don't make it based on charisma... sheesh.<P>Or... what if clerics had the ability to curse things?  Or dispell spells as they are being cast?  Or suck mana out of caster mobs?  Granted, other classes can do that, but it isn't central to any specific class. <P>Or, if cheal is given to others priests, how about giving clerics some of their abilities?

I'd like to see clerics get abilities that make them more desirable in a group, where we're being muscled out by shamans.  <P>As far as an undead only slow...  too limiting.

(I think it went up as you got higher in levels, but don't remember for sure.)  Something like that in EQ would seem appropriate for Clerics.  A line of spells that adds to Offense, basically.  Maybe Defense, too, instead of saves (we already get endures and resists).  It would be different and unique as far as I know... especially if you don't like wolf-ing out.  (Mind you, I love wolfing out and wish there was an item that let me do it :)<P>I think our light spell should be castable on others.  In this case, not making the Halo NO DROP.<P>We've all wanted Sanctuary to work like it does in D&D.  You cast it, and things just dont' attack you.  Would be easy, too, cause you could just make it work like invis, but players can see you.<P>Why don't we get see invisible, anyway?  Shouldn't we get a high level true site spells that lets us see past illusions and invis?<P>I don't think cursing is the way to go.  It doesn't seem in line for clerics in EQ.  Unless...<P>There really should be some level of cross-over spells for clerics in the way of deity specific spells.  Apart from Embue spells, there really is no difference between a cleric of the All Mother and a cleric of Hate.  Not much, mind you, but enough that being a cleric of the deity give you something different.  Curses for the evil gods, nature spells for Tunare worshipers, enchanting clay and steel for Brell worshippers, etc.  <P>And how about a spell that lets you port back to your temple when you get to level 20... oh wait... we were slapped down hard with that one.<P>And one other thing.  What about a special skill for clerics: Fasting.  To train you have to go hungry.  It should go up fairly quickly, though, like alcohol tolerance, or perhaps the speed of meditation.  The skill would simply add to your meditation skill for gaining mana back.  And when you were actually hungry, you could gain mana back at Fasting speed.<P>Just some thoughts.<P>Sanctu<BR>High Elven cleric of Tunare<BR>Seventh Hammer Server</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#f7f7f7"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Pilsburry</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">"And how about a spell that lets you port back to your temple when you get to level 20... oh wait... we were slapped down hard with that one."<P>Um, I can port to my home temple...it cost me a few plat to buy my faithstone, but I can do it.<P><BR>"We've all wanted Sanctuary to work like it does in D&D.

I wasn't trilled with the fact that they made this ability a tradeskill, but when they made a required level of 51 or above to use the thing, I lost it.  Druids and wizards port to a variety of places starting at level 20, and the one place we will eventually get to go is set at the high end of things.  And we can't even bring our group there. Ever.  <P>Before the patch I worked pottery thinking that I could make such a thing some day, and some day got moved to very far away for no good reason I can see.<P>Sorry I'm ranting.  I just feel more than a little snubbed by the whole deal.  It seems like all the cooler things in EQ are all very high level, and it seems a shame to put things there that aren't too unbalancing in the first place.<P>Anyway, Your point about Brell worshiprs getting root or a str/sta buff is a very good idea.  And I agrre about soloing.  I hate soloing myself, but we really should be able to do it.  being killed by greens while wondering across a zone is just way to bogus.<P>Sanctu<BR>38  Cleric of Tunare<BR>Seventh Hammer server</FONT></TD></TR></TABLE>
