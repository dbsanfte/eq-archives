<TEXTAREA NAME="ReplyMessage" ROWS=10 COLS=45 WRAP="VIRTUAL">[QUOTE]Originally posted by Sylvanis:
[B]I'm looking for more info about this quest.

I've done all my numbers, and worked all my faction.  I believe now that my faction should be plenty high enough to complete the quest.

From what I've read, Lord Grimrot should have a placeholder.  I can't seem to find it.  I've looked for the Putrid that says "Die like the fool you are!" and he's supposed to be standing, holding a rusty broadsword.  I cannot find this mob.

Anyone have any additional information as to which one is his spawn point?

Also, whats with the named necro Gnoll that spawns in the camp?  Whats he for?  I've been keeping the camp totally clean, hoping Grimmy will spawn.

Any additional information would be appreciated. =)  Thanks!

Can a 41 Ranger and a 35 Cleric take down Grimrot in both of his forms (live and dead)?

You could probably even solo him.  Live one much tougher but a good chance.  Ranger just tanks away and you heal.  Live is VERY MR, when I was mid thirties I had trouble even with the help of a 48 druid, but he used mostly magic, later when I was upper thirties, with a 42 pally, we dropped him much easier.

I've seen countless posts of 54+ clerics who were unable to solo the live grimrot due to his super high MR.

I hope you realize I was answering your question about you AND the ranger killing Grim.  With the ranger the dead one will be EASY, and a chance with the live, I never meant to imply you could even dream of soloing the Live Grim.<P>I confused Eachann with my post so I wanted to clear it up so you don't go dying on my advice.  You can definitely give the live a shot with the ranger tanking and at worst you will have to zone.

I had all AC/HP buffs (including symbol) on, plus endure magic and fire.<BR>When he spawned I rooted, then I nuked, he broke root and HTed me (took off about a bubb and half), rooted him again.<BR>Nuked him 3 more times.  The last one was a bit overkill, probably could have killed him with my next lower undead DD, but hey, I had the mana.  He never resisted a single point of damage.<P>If I remember right (it's been a while) after the fight I had 3.5 bubbs of health, and 1.5 bubbs of mana left.

It is standing under one of the platforms at the camp.  I didnt write down the exact loc when i was there, but i will try to describe it to you.  <P>The undead camp has several platforms just like the gnoll camp in lake rathe.  On the east side of the camp is a fallen platform.  if you stand with that one on your left, facing the camp, there are two standing platforms in front of you that are close together.  The righthand one is a little farther away from you, and is where you will find the placeholder.  There is no need to clear the whole camp. Killing the ph is all you need to do.  The placeholder is the only standing putrid skeleton you will see there.  There are also two putrids lying on the ground under or near the platform where the ph spawns.  <P>You might have to sit there for several hours to wait for it to spawn once so you will know the schedule. Then just bind there and gate back every 3 hours or so. (I gave myself a bit of extra time in case anyone else stopped by looking for grimrot) I started this camp out by actually sitting there, and it was insane.  I was much happier when i started setting the timer and gating back. <P>I did this for a couple days, and when i finally got the dead grim to spawn, the live came up 3 hours later! I couldnt believe i was lucky enough to get back to back spawns and could stop hanging around sk.  <P>I had the help of a chanter to kill the live Grimrot.  The chanter tashed him, and his pet started working Grim over.  I sat back and healed the pet. I'm not sure how this would work at your level, but at 51 it worked just fine. Oh, and he will HT you from whatever distance.  My friend pulled from his maximum range and was harmtouched across several acres of south karana.  <IMG SRC="http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/wink.gif"><P>That gnoll you were wondering about is for a monk quest.  If you draw a circle around the camp, with that gnoll being at 12 o'clock, the fallen platform i mention for you to stand at and face the camp is at about 9 o'clock.<BR>I hope that was helpful and not just confusing.  Send me a tell on Rallos if this isnt clear.<P>One word of warning, if you have been clearing the camp, you may well be KOS to the corrupt queynos guards now.  I know i am now, and i started out clearing the camp from boredom.  I havent been attacked in N Qeynos yet, but there is at least one watchman in NK who is a corrupt guard.  The other guards love me, he comes running to beat me up every time i run into him.  <P>Good luck with your Aegis, it is definitly worth the trouble.  <BR><P>------------------<BR>Zzule D`Aemon<BR>Regent of Innoruuk<BR>Guild Leader of &lt;Disciple of Hate&gt;<BR>Rallos Zek</FONT></TD></TR></TABLE>
