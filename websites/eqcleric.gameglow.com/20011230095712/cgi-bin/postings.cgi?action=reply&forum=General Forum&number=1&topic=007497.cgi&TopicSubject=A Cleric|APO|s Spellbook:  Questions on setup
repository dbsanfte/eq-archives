For example page 1&2 were level 1 spells, 3&4 were level 2, etc.  Later, I figured there must be a more organized way to do this so I tried setting it up based on the type of spells (ie, Page 1&2 heals/cures, Page 3&4 buffs, etc).  When I reached somewhere around level 20 my pages started overflowing and I ended up having to reset the whole book to allow for the additional spells.  After a while I just went to the original page by level setup.  Now that my cleric is 31, it's becoming a pain to sort through those pages and pages of spells to find the one that I need in a panic moment (ie, caster001 gets poisoned and is losing points fast).  Is there any advice you experienced clerics can give me on setup?<P>I appreciate the help in advance!</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#f7f7f7"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Sollwin</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">I tried organizing my spells, was a disaster.

If you're starting a character put outdated spells up the back, (in their level order), that way you've left enough room at the front for the organisation of your groups of useful spells.
