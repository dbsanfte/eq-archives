[B]I'm pleased to say that during my camp there on Veeshan everyone behaved very well indeed.

I shared the camp over a period of days principly with Miffin and Ikorus, ressing each other as needed after any accidents without any thought of taking the camp till whoever was there first logged for the evening (or morning in some cases ).

I only wish all the long camps could have been that friendly, and I'm sorry to hear you've had to deal with some less friendly people.

Although it does not require a kill, it is a long camp, and not the cake walk Vernant made it appear! Some information for those of you about to tackle this added phase of the cleric epic:<P>1. The merchant Zordak Ragefire has a specific spawn point in SolB, he does not wander the zone as some have reported. His new spawn point is on the ledge, beneath the window of the Fire Giant Castle. (approx loc. is -1400, -300)<P>2. There is a safe spot in the far back corner of the ledge, under the overhang, where you can wait out this camp and not be aggroed by Fire Giants, AS LONG AS YOU DON'T SIT DOWN. This allows you to see the spawn spot clearly and safely, as long as others don't aggro a giant on you in order to claim the camp. (Yes this is a very real danger, and why we kept the Fire Giants cleared after someone did this to me. Thankfully I had a level 60 warrior with me at the time, as well as my Shaman from a second account, so we were fine.  After this happened I decided not to take any chances and called in  reinforcements to clear the FGs.) <P>3. Although this part of the epic does not require a kill, it is long, and a HIGHLY contested spawn. The SolB Ragefire is estimated as lasting less than 5 minutes on average across all servers. I think this is a gross overestimation. Only one cleric can turn in a shimmering pearl and receive their swirling pearl then he despawns immediately. He is NOT spawning everyday. This isn't just broken according to a server GM who told me they changed the time and "lengthened it somewhat". He spawns randomly on a 1 to 3 day timer as best I can determine. After I claimed the camp the spawn appeared at just over the 42 hour mark (this was Tuesday morning at 5:04 am EST). I know that another cleric on our server got their swirling pearl on Friday night at roughly 9:30pm EST. I do not know if one appeared between my camp and hers, but according to a guide who dropped by, there was not an additional spawn.<P>4. As I said, this is a HIGHLY contested spawn (and in my mind creates a second bottle neck in the cleric epic). There were numerous clerics appearing throughout my camp. They are bound there (so pop in a lot), and many are camped out there in "strategic" spots. Most will honor your camp under what appears to be certain conditions: <BR>a. Only the cleric can establish and hold the camp. In other words the cleric must be present in the area of the spawn at all times, not just in the zone.<BR>b. The cleric must be an "active character". Responding to tells, and say. (You snooze you lose.)<P>Note: I said MOST would honor the camp, not ALL. There were several who came in invis (keep see invis on), and some that told me straight up that they would not honor the camp, that Vernant didn't recognize camps, and the spawn belonged to whoever managed to turn their pearl in first. One guy told me that if people honor the camp they would never get their swirling pearl unless they were willing, and able, to maintain the camp for three days, and that lots of people couldn't do that, so he considered it a free for all.<P>In summary, it is not the mobs we have to beat here but other players. It reminds me of why I would NEVER want to play on a PVP server.<P>By the way my server is Veeshan, and typically a very "play nice" group of folks.  As best I can determine we have between 40 and 50 clerics at this point in the quest though, so with current spawn times I figure it would take 3 or 4 months for everyone to get their swirling pearl even if we assume no additional clerics need one.<P>Good luck all.  Hope this info is useful.<P>Telenu Spicemaker<BR>57 Templar on Veeshan<BR></FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#f7f7f7"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Dikmer</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Sad to think I have to buy a Bracer of the Hiden (or maintain a second account) JUST to be able to see invis to make sure noone is trying to sneak the camp from me.<P>But you are right. I swapped out with a friend for 56 hours, and on average, 10-15 other clerics would pop in per hour "just to check". Several would stand around or walk around for 15-20 minutes "just talking to friends" or "just trying to figure out where to go". It didn't occur to me to worry about those coming in invis. And of course, I had my pearl in cursor, ready to turn in, just in case he popped while those other clerics were "just there".<P>It's really sad what VI has reduced us to. I haven't even though about moving to Skyfire yet, and I am afraid of how badly it will go when I do.</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#dedfdf"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Hakadek - Veeshan</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">I'm pleased to say that during my camp there on Veeshan everyone behaved very well indeed.<P>I shared the camp over a period of days principly with Miffin and Ikorus, ressing each other as needed after any accidents without any thought of taking the camp till whoever was there first logged for the evening (or morning in some cases ).<P>I only wish all the long camps could have been that friendly, and I'm sorry to hear you've had to deal with some less friendly people.<P>Hakadek</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#f7f7f7"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Telenu</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Thankfully Hakadek you are right.

At least, absor hinted at that at the FF.<P>Secondly, one cleric does not get a shimmering pearl every 24 hours.

Sunday evening, I go in, and it's open, no clerics anywhere near it, so I settle in to wait.  <IMG SRC="http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/smile.gif">   Other clerics start popping in to check, see me, and camp back out....  5th one sticks around.

I was playing an alt (2 box) so I just left my char there...  About half an hour later, he gave up too.  Had it for hours after that, until when it got late, someone trained King Tranix on me, and I DA'ed and then gated out.
