So creating with +25wis is a good idea. The remaining 5 points can go where ever. If you put that on stamina, it's only 15 extra hp at level 60.<P>I did +25wis +5str back in May '99. At the end of Velious, I was wishing I had done +25sta +5wis. But with the soft cap gone in Luclin, I'm glad I didn't. My equipment is decent, unbuffed I have 112str 149sta 239wis. I don't wear wisdom gear, I look for stuff with +mana and +hp and high ac.<P>Starting stats don't matter that much, as long as you don't put points into dex or int or something like that. Wisdom and stamina are the two most important ones for a cleric. I was almost always encumbered back in the bronze age, so for a high elf, extra strength is kinda nice.<P><P>------------------<BR><A HREF="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=4758" TARGET=_blank>Klair</A></FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#dedfdf"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Daynan</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">I've always felt that that AGI was a good stat for clerics and enchanters. Doesn't AGI affect your channeling skill? Also I think it affects how much damage you take if/when you get hit.<P>If you become encumbered because of lack of STR and your AGI falls 5 points at least you will still be 75 AGI or greater.</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#f7f7f7"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Cassandra</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">AGI doesn't affect your channeling skill directly, but does increase your AC which means you get hit less and so channel more often.<P>I put 25 points into WIS and the other 5 into STR so my poor little Erudite could at least carry some loot.</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#dedfdf"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Lynet</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">I went with the high elf, but with 20 points in wisdom and 10 in strength.  It helped a LOT in the 20s and early 30s because armor is heavy.  I now have enough gear that happens to have str on it that I no longer have to watch encumberence like a hawk, but the extra 5 points are still very handy.<P>Lynet Beaumains, The Damosel Savage<P></FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#f7f7f7"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Bolgor</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Well, your first problem is starting a High Elf cleric. I started a dwarf cleric, with the idea of being a tried and true battle cleric. Then I realized that after 40, going in hammer a'blazing no worky-worky.<P>In any case I put 20 points into Wis and 5 into Str. Looking back Sta or Agi would have been better choices. As is however, I'm at 141str 118sta 94agi 100dex 200wis 68int 45cha. Resists could be better, but thats why I have bd bracelets and diamond rings in an inventory bag.<P>Though going battle-cleric isn't always the beneficial choice, let me tell you there's nothing more thrilling than breaking 1000 ATK as a cleric (which I've done with a load of buffs and yaulp). I can't count the number of times I watched a high elf in all wis and resist gear drop in a round or two of pummelling and then have that same mob come to me afterward and I stand and take it for a round or two. <P>More mana, more wis and all of that is nice... but a dead cleric ain't gonna do anyone any good, no matter how much wisdom he has.</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#dedfdf"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Deian</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">I have a high elf cleric.<P>206 wis, 119 str, 149 sta, 462ac at lvl 15<P>Race don't matter.

I see that reference made all the time and I just don't get it *chuckle*.  Dwarves' higher base stamina may let them take a hit or two more than a high elf, but stamina and hit points are easy to come by, via armor and buffs  <IMG SRC="http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/wink.gif">.<P>I'm not necessarily recommending you do what I did, but when I created Samsara and was pretty ignorant of what effect the various stats would have, I spread my 30 points out niiiiice and even across all of the "green" stats.  Wooo, go me!<P>That gave me 70 str, 80 sta, and 115 wis as base, along with the rest of the default stats.  I think I've done fine with that combo.<P>Honestly?  Gear with stats is so readily available that it makes little or no difference what you start out at, unless you're planning on doing a lot of naked fighting.  So I wouldn't stress about it.  Just don't leave any of those 30 bonus points unspent.<P>It does make a fair amount of sense to concentrate on the "green" stats, which as far as I know have the following effects:<P>Wisdom -- total mana pool, improving non-combat skills, minimizing fizzles (rumored?)<BR>Strength -- adds indirectly to attack, allows you to carry more, supposedly a secondary stat in smithing trade skill<BR>Stamina -- total hitpoints pool, length of time you can go without breathing, and having it over 100 means you don't really tire when fighting (rumored?)<P>Anyone feel free to correct where I'm wrong or left something out.

Period. This is very important to your AC. At level 60, dropping below this costs almost 75 AC<P>STR - depends on how your character is going to go. If you're doing this solo then I'd put points into this to carry loot. If you're twinking or PLing, I'd ignore this.<P>STA - I wouldn't put too much into STA. It helps, but it's not going to make a massive difference unless you dump a lot of points here. Gives you more HP.<P>WIS - used to be everyone and their dog wished they had dumped into wis but the explosion in high wisdom items out there means it's a lot easier to pass 200 wis. Going past 200 has some benefits now but it's not something I would put any great efforts into.<P>DEX - affects procs and maybe hit percentages. Not real useful<P>CHA - The "other" green stat. Supposedly affects Death Pact, Divine Intervention and the (useless) Lull series. Also affects buy/sell prices. Again, not really useful for starting points.<P>INT - might affect tradeskills.

Obviously, I have no problem getting a 200 wis.<P>The low str and sta  have never really been an issue for me . A few weight reducing bags and low weight armor fixed the str thing and if sta ever gets low (VERY RARE) I can cast ext. fatigue. Only had to do that once while swimming 'cuz i got lost in Lake Rathe.<P>There is gear for every stat. You just have to loot so you can buy it. I don't even carry a weapon anymore (haven't since 30 ) so for me its all about Wis. I am happy with my 1425 hp  self buffed at 42. i can take a few hits while hitting my "save the cleric" hot key.<P>Congrats on making a cleric!
