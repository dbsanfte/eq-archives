[B]I'm with ya on this one.  My number one pet peave is back in my level 40s I'm in Sol B and I get tells asking if I want to join a lower guk group.  Today, I'm in Karnors, and I get asked if I want to go to Seb.  I dont have my LFG flag on, I'm in a dungeon (or whatever yall wanna call karnors hehe).  When I'm in seb, I get asked if I want to go to Howling Stones.

AHHH!!!!!!

I absolutely HATE going anonymous, but I'm more tempted to not because of res requests, but because some people are too stupid to realize that I'm in a zone that you normally dont "Look around" in, and I get asked if I want to go somewhere.  I dont mind it so much if I'm in freeport, commons, faydark, etc.

Thats one of my biggest pet peaves. hehehe

It sounds more like a seriously bad assumption based on ignorant class hate rather than fact.  My main is a 49 druid and I can say that I have *never* done a /w all cleric 49 60.  Ever.  In fact, I rarely even do a /w cleric for the same zone I'm in.  Believe it or not, nobody knows better the frustrations of constant outrageous begs like a druid/wizard (more so a druid).  Just to give you an example of a tell I got recently:<BR>B1: Hi<BR>Me: Hey, what's up?<BR>B1: Can you do me a favor?<BR>Me: What's that?<BR>B1: Can you evac to EJ, pick me up in CoM and port me to Iceclad?<BR>Me: Do me a favor and do /w all Seriena.  Thank you and good luck.<P>I was in the Hole at the time.  So, basically what I'm trying to say is that all players do stuff like what you are complaining about.  Since druids and wizards alike get this stuff all the time, it's not likely that they are the ones asking you to go out of your way the most.<P>I agree with the original poster....I wish more people would do the /w command.  I hate taking the time to explain to people that I'm not even close to the zone that they are in. /sigh.</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#dedfdf"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Docdoertee DVine</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Well, for me it is getting annoying lately.<BR>I play on European times and usually not many people are on - also not many people are not-anonymous since we are on a PvP-Server.<P>If I play on a weekend afternoon, I get tells for resses like every 5 minutes for resses. What even more bothers me, is that people can´t accept a "no". Lately I don´t even answer requests anymore, because 90% of the people keep bothering you, even if you tell them that you are busy. Some examples from the last days:<P>- I was deep in Kael, getting Corroded with the guild. Player X tells you: "Hello fellow dark elf. I lost my head in Lake of Ill Omen. Can you come and ress me?". I answered that I am busy with guild in Kael, behind see-invis mobs and without a mage to CoH me back, so that I won´t be able to. Answer: "You won´t help your same race when they need you? blablabla" ... *sigh*<BR>- I was in Western Wastes, hunting dragons with my guild. Player X tells you: "Can you zone over to Eastern Wastes and res me?" Uhm ... I explained him that Eastern Wastes is not one zone to zone over and that I was busy and couldn´t leave, etc. Answer: "You are lying!"  ... *sigh*<BR>- The funniest thing happened when I was in Hate once. Player X tells you: "Hello. I need your help". "I am busy in Hate, I am not able to come to ress you, I am sorry". "Oh, I don´t need a ress. I am level 1 and need a bodyguard that travels with me from Halas to Freeport". ... uhm ...<P>What I hate is:<BR>An_Unknown_Player00 tells you: "<BR>*sigh <BR>You tell your group: "Ress-Request incoming"<BR>An_Unknown_Player00 tells you: "Can you ress me?"<BR>Sorry, I am AFK right now<P>If I give responses lately when somebody asks for resses depends how they ask. If they don´t know me and don´t even say a hello first, I don´t bother to answer them. Something like "Can ya rez me plz. thx." I will never answer. Did I mention I hate "plz" and "thx"?<P>But thanks god there are other people as well. While I was busy looking for some Griffins in EW, a druid gave me a tell, asking desperately for a ress in a nice manner. He went LD in Field of Bone and ran into a guard and died and lost his level 55. He came and picked me up, we went there (all in all took like 20 minutes or so *shrug*) and I ressed him. He gave me 1k in the trade-window and I always cancelled the trade. He was really surprised that I don´t charge for resses - I never do. Either I want to ress people or I don´t. Offering me pp won´t help. But now everytime he is in the same zone as I am, he asks me if I need a ride - which is way more usefull for me then pp  <IMG SRC="http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/smile.gif"><P>Well, to end my babbling (sorry, bored at work  <IMG SRC="http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/wink.gif">), I have to say that lately the requests and the attitude of people have gone worse and worse each day. And no, it´s not the quad-kiting druids that are so annoying - to be honest, they are most the time the nicest people. It´s simple people who can´t accept a "no, I am busy" as a "no" and keep bothering you.<P>Docdoertee D`Vine<BR>High-Priestess of Teir´Dal<BR>~Seekers of Divinity~<BR>Rallos Zek<BR></FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#f7f7f7"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Crispus</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<BR>From Gryfalia =And I get this /tell.

Indeed, I<BR>know that he was above 30 and I think from<BR>recollection higher than 40 (not sure).  At<BR>that point you SHOULD know something about<BR>Kedge Keep, not necessarily from having been<BR>there, but from discussions people have.<P>It's an underwater dungeon, kinda underneath<BR>Dagnor's Cauldron.  Many things see invis and<BR>since it is so unfriendly an environment, you<BR>don't just visit, you go there for a reason.<P>/who name all is one of the basic commands<BR>in the game.  At a base level /who tells<BR>you the names of everyone in zone (and, if<BR>they aren't roleplaying or anon, their<BR>class, level and guild.).  Doing a /who name<BR>would give you the information on just the<BR>one person.  Doing a /who name all would<BR>give you that information regardless of where<BR>you and I are, AND tell you where I am.<P>I actually don't mind rez requests, and have<BR>only have a couple people give me a hard time<BR>for not being able to get to them.<P>And, in a nutshell, my attitude towards these<BR>subjects is that people who request a rez<BR>need to remember that they are not the top of<BR>my list when I am doing something, and they<BR>move further down my list depending on what<BR>I am doing.  If I am just sitting in EComm<BR>selling stuff, well, just wait a minute for<BR>me to finish this transaction and tell me<BR>where the corpse is (or get me a port or<BR>whatever).  If I am soloing it merely depends<BR>how deep I am in whatever dungeon I am.  I<BR>don't want to have to work my way back down<BR>to the basement of CC.  If I am in a group<BR>in a hard to get to place (the planes, Kedge,<BR>Kobolds in Velk's Laboratory) it's VERY <BR>unlikely that I will drop what I am doing and<BR>help you out.  And a little research on your<BR>end (the requestor) to look where I am saves<BR>me from having to say what, at a higher <BR>level, you should be able to figure out for<BR>yourself.<P>I suppose I find it similar to warriors who<BR>are out soloing, come upon me medding<BR>and want me to heal them, because, well,<BR>it's just mana.  So I should have to sit here<BR>for an extra 5 minutes so you don't have to?<BR>That's inconsiderate, and makes me feel that<BR>I am obliged to help someone I am not obliged<BR>to help.  Had someone do this for 15 minutes<BR>with their mammoth pet in EW.  Not my job to<BR>keep your pet alive so you can keep soloing<BR>while I try to med up.<P>Or else I Just find it funny and move on <BR>(this is the normal result).<P>Gryfalia<BR>50 Cleric of Brell<BR>Druzzil Ro<BR>Imperial Guards</FONT></TD></TR></TABLE>
