Do you read it the way I do?  If your account gets hacked...rather than give it back to you, they're just gonna ban it?!  Have fun starting over!<P>Xthor Mednheal<BR>Cleric of 44 Seasons<BR>Solace Keep<BR>Druzzil Ro<BR>______________________<P><BR>As the population of Norrath increases, so too do issues regarding stolen or compromised accounts, and/or accounts that have been transferred from one player to another in violation of the User Agreement. These issues - and the time it takes to investigate and attempt to resolve them - hugely detract from the time that SOE’s customer service staff have to devote to providing quality customer service to issues that impact upon the gameplay experience. Accordingly, SOE must remind all players that:<BR>(1) Account security -- whether it be password protection, running virus checks, disabling file sharing, or any other element of making sure accounts are not stolen or compromised -- is the sole responsibility of the account owner.<P>(2)Any and all stolen and/or compromised accounts that are reported to SOE will be banned, and no items will be reimbursed. Any player found to be involved in an account theft will have any and all of his/her accounts banned.<P>- The EverQuest Customer Service Team<P></FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#f7f7f7"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Bodin</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">I just won't connect to the Internet when I play EQ.</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#dedfdf"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Dikmer</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Well, there is a good example of good customer service.<P>NOT!<P>Hope they don't ban me. That was ages ago.</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#f7f7f7"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Saviorr</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">In other words:<P>We at Verant do not think it's in our interest to provide basic customer service support to our loyal customers.  You, as customers, are responsible for account security and if you're stupid or unlucky enough to get your account hacked, then we don't want your $120 a year or the $30 you spend on expansions.  <P>It's that type of arrogance that will be the downfall of this game.  Considering the number of competing games set to be introduced in the next year...you'd think they would have a more "customer friendly" approach.<P></FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#dedfdf"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Snaggletooth</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">I know some guys who continually trade accounts around.  All the time they are doing this.  They make convoluded deals with people who think they are friends.  Stupid crap like - if you give me your acct, I will give you this acct, and powerlevel your rogue on server X.  Basically they end up knowing quite a few different login names and passwords.<P>All of them at one time or another have called customer service complaining of their characters being stripped and/or deleted.  And in a few cases I can testify that those characters were indeed stripped.  But no one knows who did it, because 10 or more people have the login names and passwords for these accounts.  These accounts have been played by so many people.<P>These guys waste a ton of C.S.'s time with their idiocy.  I can totally see why CS is taking this stand.  The true hacked accounts are extremely rare I bet (seeing as how I know a bunch of these goofballs causing problems without hacking.)  VI can spend lots of money investigating, or just end all the nonsense.<P>Meanwhile, after 26+ months playing EQ, I have had the same account, same login name, same password, and zero calls to CS.  I never gave my info to anyone (after being asked by MANY people, including my guild leaders - grrr  /slap.)  I am the type of customer they want.<P>I guess VI is willing to lose the .0001% of their playerbase who have been maliciously hacked to avoid having to spend unlimited $$$ on the children mentioned above, who will always try to cheat the system in some manner.   The silent majority sure won't be affected, or even know about this policy.</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#f7f7f7"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Mirriana_00</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">The truth is that 90%+ of the "hacked" accounts today are people who have given their passwords out at some point.<P>Even if you haven't, and VI resets your accounts, they suddenly have to deal with two times your equipment being in the world as before.  That affects the economy in a big way if this is wide-spread.</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#dedfdf"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Xthor</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Since I don't give out my username/password, I guess I didn't look at it from that perspective.  I can see where this does solve a lot of those problems...but it definitely makes me more paranoid about password security....which I suppose is what they want in the first place.  <P>Xthor</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#f7f7f7"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Galavant</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">This is similar to banning people for exploiting terrain like Conquest did in Sleeper's.<P>"We at Verant know we are crappy programmers who don't know squat about 3D technology, and we know that Quake I's beta test looks advanced compared to our 3D engine, in that it at least had solid walls that monsters couldn't sense or attack you through. But we feel that it is unfair for players to take advantage of our idiocy in releasing such a shoddy product, and we will ban anyone we find who uses our screwups to their advantage, instead of fixing the damned problems like we should have before we ever released the game."<P>Yet another reason I will never buy another Verant game.

As for server power, that should be less and less of a problem as the technology keeps advancing. We're HOW far ahead of where we were when EQ first came out? I have high hopes for future games, provided they don't get too heavy into the release-now-patch-later thing and actually have a game that works when released. <P>I do realize that to fix a lot of these issues in the game would require literally a whole new game, and as you have pointed out a major hardware upgrade. Maybe I'm just to idealistic to think of releasing something that was less than perfect, even by the standards of two years ago.<P>------------------<BR>Galavant Greenlabel<BR>http://www.geocities.com/mirthandmayhem<BR>Rathe Server<P>"Judge not by size, but rather by spirit."</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#f7f7f7"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Bodin</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">I once sat down and thought about the hardware and ISP needs EQ server locations needs.<P>I passed out.</FONT></TD></TR></TABLE>
