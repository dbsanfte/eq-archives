<TEXTAREA NAME="ReplyMessage" ROWS=10 COLS=45 WRAP="VIRTUAL">[QUOTE]Originally posted by HadekkinK:
[B]Well after hitting this cycle numerous times I was finally outright given a copy of BoA (Fate is so fickle sometimes lol).  Sherazade as to your questions:

1.  Both versions can drop spells, I'm 99% certain - good friends have told me they got spells from non-named, I just haven't seen it myself.  However, neither are gauranteed to drop a spell.

2.  The no-rent key is part of a quest to get a key to Inner Acrylia - something you should only bother with if your guild is *cough* quite powerful and willing to endure a pretty horrendous time sink.  As I understand it, you give the no-rent key to the Vah Shir prisoner, and he tries to escape from Acrylia; things spawn to try to stop him, and eventually he gives you a quest item.  This gets combined with other items from doing the Grimling Wars quests and gets you eventually a key for Inner Acrylia.  It has nothing to do really with the High Priest cycle.

3.  Spawn time - when I first started doing this cycle, several months ago, the High Priest (untargetable version) would spawn almost immediately upon completion of the quest (ie death of the targetable priest).  I have a screenshot of the new Priest standing over the dead body of the old one  :).  However, in the past few weeks, there's either been a bug or the spawn time has been changed, as the untargetable version is no longer spawning quickly upon cycle completion.  We waited 15 minutes or so and then called it quits.  The next day I checked and he was up, however.

Whether this is a bug in the script or by design, I'm not sure, but it seems that this quest may be a "one shot" type of deal, at least if you're unlucky like me and get this bug.

Hope this helped, good luck getting your spell!
