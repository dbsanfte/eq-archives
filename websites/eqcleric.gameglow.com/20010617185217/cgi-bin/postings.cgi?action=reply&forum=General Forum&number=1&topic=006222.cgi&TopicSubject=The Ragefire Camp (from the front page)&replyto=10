<TEXTAREA NAME="ReplyMessage" ROWS=10 COLS=45 WRAP="VIRTUAL">[QUOTE]Originally posted by Cayleu:
[B]All I can say is, thank God I hail from the Luclin server, the home of Everquest's ONLY 100% universally-followed Ragefire Rotation List.

If your wondering what I'm talking about it is found here: 
 [URL=http://pub6.ezboard.com/fluclin71335dragonsandtheplanes.showMessage?topicID=587.topic]http://pub6.ezboard.com/fluclin71335dragonsandtheplanes.showMessage?topicID=587.topic[/URL] 

Basically, this list was constructed by the major guilds of the server, since obviously any kind of Ragefire agreement would have to be signed off on by the major guilds to work. Miraculously, it has happened, since *February*, with dozens and dozens passing through the list, with no cheating or KSing at all. Even more miraculously, our Ragefire rules are tailor-made for the little guy, the small guilds, people with Real Lives, unguilded folks with lots of friends. Our list's rules are such that the "uber" guilds would benifit a lot more without the list, which makes it even more amazing that the list hasnt been broken these last 3 months. I wont say that our community is somehow nicer or better than average, I would be biased and that statement would be self-serving, but still, its pretty remarkable.

Consider the basic rules: You are verified to have the shimmering pearl, you show that you are level 50, you get put at the bottom of the list. Notice the absolute lack of any mention of guilds. This is not about guilds, this is about the clerics of Luclin, and getting as many epics into the server as efficiently as possible.

When you reach the top, your butt goes to solb or lavastorm, and you camp ragefire. If your online at all, a /who all yourname had better show you being there, or one of your monk alts if you got one. If you cant be online due to RL, or sleep or whatever, your guild or friends need to be watching it with some kind of a way to contact you. In short, if your found every day on exp camps or lots of raiding during your turn, that obviously looks very, very bad. Countless clerics who have graduated through the list have put in their dues, the cleric at the top is expected to pay the same time commitment price.

Now the important part. He spawns, the server will generally grant you somewhere between a 3-5 hour grace period to get folks together to bring down Ragefire. More time if in a bad time of day (4am) Less time at the peaks when you should have less of a problem getting a raid together. The list is generous to those clerics who traditionally would have almost no chance on other servers, but a line has to be drawn somewhere. If 3-5 hours are not enough for you to get a Ragefire raid together in normal circumstances, the next in line gets his chance. The server isnt going to tolerate having Rage up all day long.

The only exception to this grace period is if a downtime is going to happen within 5 hours or so, or if naggy's possible window of spawning is within the next 5 hours or so. In these cases you absolutely had better be online and ready to kill him soon, or all rules are pretty out the window, as the server is facing the possibility of a wasted RF. Those are pretty much the only times Luclin ever reverts to standard practice of other servers, and only for that brief period. Thats really the only time we've had a minor problem on the list, when Ragefire spawned one day, but naggy was due up that afternoon. The cleric at the top was not online. Ordinarily he would have been given a bit of time to show up, but in this special case, that cleric lost his chance and had to resume his turn later that day when he logged on to find Ragefire killed to beat Naggy's respawn.

Weve had some problems and close calls, legitimate arguments about the list's fairness, but each time things were adapted just enough to make things work out and keep the idea alive. (For example, originally the list had no shimmering pearl requirement and people were signing up who hadnt even killed Overking yet, that threatened to kill the list big-time. Requirement was added that in order to get on the list, you had to be ready to spawn the final fight, and disaster was averted.)

Very occasionally, we will get challenges, intellectual arguements against the list every 3-4 weeks or so. The most amazing thing about it, is these arguments never really come from our "uber guilds" (of which I guess I'd be a member of one of them) who would benifit most from trashing the list and messing up "the little guy." Usually, these arguments are met with surprisingly fierce resistance, none of those guilds who really could do damage to the list are swayed, and some of us come to places like these eqcleric boards to find horror stories to repost over there, reminding people just how good we've got it, and what exactly we are trying to avoid. (and succeeding)

I admit this probably wont work elsewhere, the only reason it worked for us, aside from Luclin being unusually more calander-driven than most servers, was that it was established early. The server really has not known anything except the list. Getting on the list. Camping ragefire on your turn. Helping the one on top, no matter what guild they are in. A server which already has been thoroughly scarred with bitter fights over Ragefire, probably theres no way this could be established with universal agreement.

Of the last two clerics to complete the epic on Luclin, one was in a teeny-tiny "family" type of guild, and the other was unguilded with lots of friends. When they needed help at the end, they were able to get that help across partisan and guild-lines, including lots of assistance from the "uber" guilds which this list maybe doesnt benefit more than the FFA alternative. That really is a neat thing to see as being possible. It's a shame most servers are unable to do this.[/B][/QUOTE]
