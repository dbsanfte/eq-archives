<TEXTAREA NAME="EditedMessage" ROWS=10 COLS=45 WRAP="VIRTUAL">Ok I tried out acrylia exp, and this is my findings.

1.  Its safe and very quick run to the spot you want.  There is a bit at the back wall that nothing spawns in and is safe to afk camp out which is very nice.

2.  Exp for a cleric without c3 is very overrated.  I was getting pretty standard 'cleric soloing' exp as in blue mob kill exp anywhere.

The trick to acrylia is its relatively safe, and theres no time to pulling.  Its all in the downtime.

Without C3, or any FT gear (only mc1), I found that mana usage was a push.

I tried a variety of different methods.  I found that rooting and dot'ing is not particularly effective because root is very variable.  Unlike bats in ME, you can not rely on root, and I have done 3 or 4 roots which have worn off before I have even gotten into position to dot.  With this, and due to the high fizzle rate of the dot, I was looking at 1 kill per 15 minutes.

A different method I tried was mor pull, and nuke tanked with a single CH mid fight.  This went quicker, but I ended up using much more mana.  Overall I probably had the same dps, and again I ended up with 1 kill per 15 minutes.

Lastly in an effort to just try slightly more efficent I went for exp - battle cleric style.  I mor the mob, cast our pet, turned the mob so pet was hitting its backside, swopped to dawnfire and tank healed it until it died.  Surprisingly enough the kill rate wasn't that much slower than using DoT's and the mana useage was substancially less (looking at 30%, 3-4 CH's and mor).  Note that I do have a 40% haste cloak, so it definitely helps with how much damage I do (though no primal yet, it would help alot with procing the dawnfire I bet).

Total kill time including mana regeneration = 12 mins.

With c3, I think I could battle cleric them almost continously (to the extent that the pet might not ever go).  It would perhaps double the overall exp rate, though give how weak it is at the moment with present gear, it shouldn't matter too much.  I am pressing for a hammer of the sun, so if I do get one of those I will try it out and keep you informed.

Increased forms of damage shield, such as ragefire arms, shaman potions (not cost efficent if you ask me) 8th ring or chardok ring would definitely help that part of the fight.

Out of a bad bunch its probably the best, but it shows how poor a cleric out of the box (and whilst im not uber, I am certainly not poorly equiped) can solo.  Clerics need more than anything a damage upgrade.  A damage output of around 700 a minute is not enough for any class.  </TEXTAREA>
