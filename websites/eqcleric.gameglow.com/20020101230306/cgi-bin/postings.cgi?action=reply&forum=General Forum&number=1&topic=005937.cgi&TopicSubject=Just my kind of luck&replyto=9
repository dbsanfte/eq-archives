[B]Ok i like the need before greed thing and on large raids this might not be plausible but i was thinking of a different way to roll for loot. This could only apply to items that are not no drop. Basiacally after a night of grouping with a bunch of people instead of rolling for each item why not put every item you got that you were going to roll for into a bag, then have everyone in the group roll a random 100. Keep track of who rolls what and then the highest roll picks an item from the bag first, second highest picks an item next and so on. That way everyone (depending on how many items you got) would have a chance to have at least 1 thing and 1 person with stupid luck wouldn't get all the items. 

It might not apply in a whole lot of situations but when i hear about people who constantly loose out on rolls when there are lots of things they got in one night it just doesn't seem right ya know.[/B][/QUOTE]

Was quite the group and we were plowing through the zone.  Draco dies...and he has one of the Terror shields.  <P>Now, in what is probably a sort of unusual thing, this particular guild I was with makes these shields Cleric only on the rolls.  So...given one of the clerics there already had one, it was just between me and one other person.  So we roll off.  I roll an 84.  /cheer!....then he rolls an 85.  I was honestly laughing.  Hail my kind of luck.<P>Well, we contine to clear the zone and are having a blast doing it.  Get to Cazic.  Take him down easy and....an Eye of Cazic Thule and Halo of the Enlightened drops!  They roll the Eye first to all casters interested...I'm number 5 on the list.  They loot master rolls a 6.  *sigh*<P>So then she takes names for the Halo.  And again, thanks to having the right clerics along I guess, and the fact that one cleric won something earlier, there are just two of us rolling.  So we have to roll off.  The other cleric rolls a 25.  I'm standing there thinking ... Ya know, if I roll a 24 ...And I rolled a 58.  I was stunned.  <P>And lets just say....I'm glad my luck was just that little bit off with Draco.   <IMG SRC="http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/wink.gif">  Never thought I'd be wearing such an amazing piece of gear.<P>And I never thought I'd be able to say "Nope, don't need See Invis"  <IMG SRC="http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/wink.gif"><P>*dances*<BR><P>------------------<BR><B>Aaldiana D'Ozz</B><BR>Level 58 Healing Wench  <BR>Guildmistress of <I><A HREF="http://mav.nu/hb" TARGET=_blank>HonorBound</A></I>  <BR>Bristlebane Server<BR><I>Flirtatious by Nature - Strong by Will</I><BR><B>Whip and Flail enabled</B></FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#f7f7f7"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Kandolek</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Grats Aaldiana!!

The raid leader, Bilorre, didn't even hesitate, but announced that the drop was going to me because I was one of the most unlucky random rollers he had ever seen, and that I had more than earned it for the number of times that I had been with them on these raids..This act just earned Bilorre and his guild alot of respect and also the help of me anytime I can possibly be there for them.   There was not one question about this from anyone as most had been with me on these raids.., and I passed the information onto MY guild leader as well.
