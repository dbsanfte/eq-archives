You turn in the trigger, you get the trigger back and then Fay spawns.  <P>Second, you MUST remove the loot off Ragefire, becasue otherwise, you whill have people farming Ragefire for the loot.<P>Finally, to really accomplish a solution to this problem, you make him spawn more often to eliminate teh back log.  VI's choice is to make happy the ones who already have the epic who also want to be considered elite because of their status as epic wielders, or keep happy the entire rest of game players all of whom want to see every cleric with a clicker.<P>I mean really.....  Who in their right mind doesn't want to see every cleric in the game outfitted with one of these.  <P>If you have issues with how easy it is, that is one thing.  If you ahve issues with how rare it is, that is another.  <P>There was a time when a 50+ cleric was rare.  Those days are long gone in EQ.  There was a time when an epic wielding cleric was rare.  Those days too are long gone.  <P>Personally, I would like to not have to compete with uber guild twinks for their guilds 50th epic.<P>Btw, on Quellious last night, Skyfire went down, came back up, and there was immediately afterwards a druid from Vis Major and Lotus Cult scouring Skyfire for Ragefire.

Clearly the reason why every server's boards are littered with Ragefire bickering is due to the fact the stick contains a mana free res... and having that in a guild does indeed enable you to do things you couldn't before.  <P>The only reason I care about the epic is the mana free res... from a personal perspective I think it's funny that one of the big three reasons I quit my paladin was I didn't want any part of a huge quest that other people wanted me to complete (before RoK was released).</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#f7f7f7"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Twinskey Bab0linskey</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Oh yeah, as for Tarf02's comment about removing the loot...

For useful epics (and cleric is definately that), you don't need extra loot to motivate people, thats just dumb and ignorant.  Also it should be triggered, I think it totally blows the script to not have it linear.<P>I know people in LC are after Ragefire for melee loot.  Some of that blazing armor is supposed to be pretty nifty, whatever.  I can't think of any cleric mains (maybe 1) that need epic so talk to the people in LC you see in zone let them know you are camping it, i'd be pretty suprised to see LC port in a lowbie cleric twink to look it when you are camping and waiting to finish quest.  If you see rage pop and need help send me a tell.<P>LC has been very aggressive in getting epics for our clerics but we have also helped a lot of non-guild clerics with their ragefires as well. <P>Brambodius Tanglefoot<BR>Lotus Cult - Quellious<P></FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#f7f7f7"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Ellystra</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">This whole situation is rediculous. At this point - I'd just be happy to see a RF spawn that's working properly - and then would be happy to push the issue elsewhere to see some changes for the better.<P>All these changes havef done is to move the area - folks are still going to fight over it until some serious changes are made (IE - remove loot or to make the heart container no rent or some other such drastic measure).<P>------------------<BR>Teir'Dal Revenant of the 57th Rank<BR>Ellystra Pureheal - Human Templar of the 58th Order<BR>Wood-elf Rogue of the 18th Blade<BR>Iksar Monk of the 21st Fist<BR>Erudite Necromancer of the 10th Unholy Sanctum<BR>Vah Shir Warrior of the 11th Sword<BR>Bertoxxulous</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#dedfdf"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Sollwin</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">If I were to make the changes to the quest, I'd give it a complete overhaul.  These are the changes I would make:<P>1) Begurgle would not always drop his crown.  Would be about the same rate that Wizards see on Phinny's Staff.<P>2) Gimblox would be done like Begurgle.<P>3) Overking spawn would be changed to 12 hours, making "note farming" a thing of the past.  Note would always drop.<P>4) Ixi would only be available once every 3 days.<P>5) Leave new Sol B Zordak as is.<P>6) Put Zordak in Skyfire on 24 timer, triggerd by handing in Swirling pearl.  You get Swirling Pearl back, combine in container.<P>This effectivley shifts the bottle neck to the beginning of the quest.  VI could use their actual rate's to determine drop percentages and rarity of spawns.<P>The whole problem with the cleric quest is that getting to Rage was easy.  Many parts of the quest were suitable to farming.  Very easy to get 4 notes in a raid on Chardok and I still remember the Ixi parties where Rage ready clerics were churned out 4 to 5 at a time.<P>Result was a massive backlog of clerics waiting for one spawn.<P>------------------<BR>Sollwin Lifestar<BR>58th Halfling Templar of Bristlebane<BR><A HREF="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=41743" TARGET=_blank>Inspect Me!</A></FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#f7f7f7"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">ShelseaDruid</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">The change I would make would be the following:<P>Zordak the Merchant would be the trigger in Skyfire for the Dragon form.  I would put it like Faydedar.  No loot falls on him.  I would have also have him spawn every 8 hours to give all cleric a chance at him.<P>There is a cleric on Brell that is the 2nd cleric after him (first one got hers).  She has been there for 58 hours as of last night.<P>I know that we do not pay our $10 a month to sit around camping stuff at least I don't.<P>/hugs<BR>Torriana Shaddowfists<BR>56 Cleric<BR>Abyss<P>Brell</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#dedfdf"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Xthor</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">/agree Sollwin<P>I think the bottlenecks should be earlier in the quest.  I agree that to lower the drop rates on Begurgle and Gimblox would help.<P>The problem that they'd have if they increased the frequency of the end mobs would be a short term flood of epics into the game from all the people that are stuck at Ragefire.  Personally, I think that's what they should do, as a person's excitement and anticipation gets higher as they get closer to the end of the quest -- thus they're much more disappointed when they hit the wall there.  Much better to have the bottlenecks near the beginning where the cleric can pretty much get the items on their own and are not as excited because the quest is "nearly done."<P>For the record, I'm done with Begurgle, but not Gimblox yet.
