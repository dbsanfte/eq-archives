If we had 4 groups of L55+ and more casters we probably would have succeeded. Be careful of runners and clumping mobs in the Prince area.

Prince got destroyed on second attempt (pulling him out is a pain the a$$).  We moved on to the overking, but he aggroed on the puller, and casted an AOE, sending all the pets into a rage.  Needless to say, was not good.  What route are you taking to him?  Dropping into the pit from the library area?  I assume this is the way to go, otherwise you have to go through the queen (shiver).  Also, any tactical stuff on him would help too.  How bad is his AOE, melee output, etc.  thanks =)<BR></FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#dedfdf"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Treskin</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Into the pit? That is certain death, you have to go over the trap and straight through the hidden wall. Once you go around that corner king is on on the right and queen is on the left, we had no problems pulling the king clear. We got him with one guard, but unfortunatly he CH'ed once, then almost everyone went linkdead...the few of us left still almost killed him again but some back spawns got us. If we would have moved up further he would have gone down. Oh well =(</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#f7f7f7"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Stylean</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">awesome, thanks for the tip.  One more quick question, (you wont believe me, but i pulled the entire trip to prince and king for my guild hehe, dont ask.) once at the bottom of the library, can you pull the mobs OVER the pit into the large area, or do you have to rush across the pit enmasse and fight on the other side?  From my recon before the king aggroed I saw at least 1 just after the pit.  Pull him/them across, or move to them?<BR></FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#dedfdf"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Walbort</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Thanks for the info, guys...for the walkthrough, any idea on his level, his max melee damage, spells besides CHeal that he casts, levels and numbers needed to beat him, perchance loc info?<P>Walbort Wholeheart<BR>Scribe of Brell<BR>Bristlebane Server</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#f7f7f7"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Blanck</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">I participated in the killing of this guy over the weekend.<P>We had about 4 groups (LR + HF), maybe a little less. We ventured through the tunnel from the zone-out (the one where you need to DMF and float up), and into the castle. Once inside, we made our way to the library, and set up in the room under the stairs (herbalist room?). The king seems to have 6 guards with him, you need to pull as many of these as possible before you go for him.<P>After pulling several guards, someone accidently aggroed him and about 5 other mobs.<P>The fight begins!<P>We had 3 enchanters, they started chainstunning him and all of the other stuff that came with him when he was pulled. He procced his AE 4 or 5 times, and surprisingly, it didnt seem to do a whole lot of damage, but it does have a dispell-effect as well. People were dying all through the fight, but we managed to down him for the first time on Fennin Ro!!<P>After he was killed, we still had to deal with the 5 or so other 54ish mobs, and everyone was rather beat up, so most everyone died except for a couple people who could FD.<P>Someone managed to loot him before he died; he dropped:<P>Argent Defender (33/49) =/ crap.<BR>and some no-drop parchment or scroll of some sort, I think this rotted =(<P>oh well =D twas a great raid nonetheless.<P><BR>--<BR>Blanck Ironhands<BR>55 Warrior<BR><~LAST RITES~><BR>Fennin Ro</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#dedfdf"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Stylean</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Had another attempt tonight.  Got some very useful info.  Breaks down as follows.<P>FD pulling out his gaurds is fairly simple.  just have the monk FD on the ramp going up and pull off him there.  You can usually get the king alone or with 1 gaurd.  Problem is, the king casts Gflux.  We were fighting him with 1 of his gaurds charmed (owning him in fact), when he set off a gflux.  several ppl hit the ceiling.  Immediately after, 5 to 6 more mobs run into his room and wax us.  (overking was at the V in over when the last of us died to the train.  sigh).  My next attempt, we will pull him into the hall before his room after clearing the roamers and gaurds.  This should work out better, there are no mobs directly above the hall section of the dungeon.  That way a flux wont affect anything (other than your HP total).  <P>his AOE is wuss.  did about 2 bubs of damage to the average tank, and he only got it off twice the entire fight (every 30 secs i think, we were hammering him pretty good until the train).  Not sure on his melee, never got close to him.  Also, as mentioned casts Gflux.<P>Suggested buffs - GRM, RF, HP buffs, AC buffs.  Hes harder than the prince, but deff killable.  Just figuring out where to fight him and timing the spawns in the hall, foyer, and his room that makes it difficult.  We go after him again next weekend probably.  If anyone downs him though in the interm, pls post your strat so i can compare it to mine =)<P>Ive read of ppl getting to him with 18 ppl, but dont really see how thats feasable unless your all lvl 60 and have perfect group balance.  Plan on taking 24 mid 55s.  Not so much for the king (i can see 18 ppl owning him easily), but to clear quickly to your target.  Getting caught in repop in certain areas can be really ugly if your trying to pull forward.<P>Stylean SilverSteel<BR>Fallen Cleric of Marr<BR></FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#f7f7f7"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Stylean</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">ungh left out stuff.  We fought him in his chamber, which is directly below the library / foyer area.  If youve gotten to the King, then you know there are like 14+ mobs in that area.  When we went for him, the foyer was dead, but the Library was still poped except for the 2 door gaurds.  thats 5 to 6 mobs.  exactly the number that ran in on us.  I really think avioding, or negating the gflux in this room is key to killing him.  Hence, we pull him into the hall next time.</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#dedfdf"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Shanaynay</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">What's the spawn time on the King?
