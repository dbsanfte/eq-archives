I am a lvl 20 dwarf cleric(who obviously worships Brell)and I sm so bored ATM I have stopped playing for a couple weeks.

( NOT LOIO,  was there from 15 to 19 and it gets pretty old.  I will be going to the Mountain Giant camps in FM at 24 or 25 but I don't really know what to do from here til then.

Get a group of friends and have some fun. Hell, while you're in Sol A, maybe you can grab Lord Gimblox's ring to start your epic.<P>A 20ish group could also (I think) survive the upper level of Dalnir (Kunark, in Warsilks Woods).<P>Don't like dungeons? Well, Stonebrunt is good from 20 to 35ish. And you can get there VERY easily from SK by using Nexus.<P>Velious is right out at 20. Sorry.<P>Luclin, however, has a few 20ish zones. Paludal Caverns and HollowShade Moore come to mind right off.<P>In other words, GET OUT THERE and explore  <IMG SRC="http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/smile.gif"></FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#dedfdf"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Grumbles</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Your getting into a tricky age there at 20.

There seem to be lots of lower level guilds out there. <P>The reason for this is that killing ANYWHERE is going to be boring unless it is just a diversion whilst you are with people.<P>Some places are more fun than others but in the end it is the people that make the hunting fun.<P>I emphasize this because the role of a cleric is often not perceived to be as exciting as some others. But if you perservere through the sitting, dependence on others and sense of guilt when fellow group members die, you will become one of the most powerful and sought after characters in the game.<P>Clerics are literally AWESOME ... but the trade-off for that is a fairly long apprenticeship. So find friends to assist you through the levels. They will keep you eager to log on and get another few yellows.<P><BR>Napper<BR>High Priest Xev</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#dedfdf"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Wisecleric</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Try out Dark Age of Camelot. :P</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#f7f7f7"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Skwar</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">I haven't heard anyone suggest High Pass Hold... don't recall the level of the Gnolls or Orcs there, but if they're too hard -- goto High Hold Keep and join up in some Goblin groups.

It also very rarely has anyone in the zone anymore.<P>Unrest is ok, but when u die it does get ugly there. Same with MM.

Level 20 is when you leave soloing behind and get in groups and really learn your role AND learn every other classes' roles.  Its not about what zone you are in or what mob you kill or how many of them you have to kill to ding.  Its about testing yourself to see if you've got what it takes to be a cleric.<P>Where to go?

I have gotten in the habit of leaving a trail of beer in different zones, just to see who might follow...hehehe.<P>My favorite time was when I had just completed the DSoB quest in Oasis, went down to the docks and /shouted "Keg Party at the Docks!  Free beer for all that say 'Praise Brell'".  I had over 1 dozen takers and everyone had a great time, until a Sand Giant came by and started wrecking havoc.  Everyone was drunk, they started trying to run and shout and learned just how powerful this drink (Brell's Blessed Stout) really is.
