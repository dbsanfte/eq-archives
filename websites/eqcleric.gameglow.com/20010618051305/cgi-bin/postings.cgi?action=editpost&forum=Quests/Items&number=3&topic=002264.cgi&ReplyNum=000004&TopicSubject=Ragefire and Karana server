<TEXTAREA NAME="EditedMessage" ROWS=10 COLS=45 WRAP="VIRTUAL">Hehe,

From my own experiences, talking to other players, and my semi-active involvement in KGC (grin), my insight is as follows:

Have a group of at least six with you at all times camping the lair and it is yours. Keep the FGs cleared and you further bolster your argument. Even the guilds most people have *issues* with respect that (at least they did with me). When the Japanese guilds see a force there, they sometimes ask how long we are staying, an then head out. (If you are NOT there around the clock, a cleric froma  Japanese guild, DOES have a good chance of grabbing the camp in the wee hours ET....)

Sitting at the zone is not camping Ragefire, having a FD monk is not camping Ragefire (a few guilds/alliance object to that on Karana). Mobilize quickly when he is up and kill him. Expect pressure from other guilds if the assualt forces aren't there in 30 minutes.

Ain't it fun?

I did the camp four times. The first time I had the camp after AoVB killed Naggy and they reset the zone 6 hours later (grrr). Another time was the *ahem* incident. The third time I had it, I helped someone from Atlantis kill it and got inline behind a Valoran cleric who had to abandon the camp to to Fear 20+ hours later (he also helped Atlantis kill ragefire - it was at like 4 a.m. their time).

The final time I did it (and I was successful), I had to be a jerk. We were going for the camp and I got into an argument with another (insert larger guild)cleric who claimed he had been calling the camp for 30 minutes (The ranger I had in the zone disputed that but who knows). I pointed out that sitting on his butt at the zone and waiting the next 90+ minutes he said he would need to gather the forces to clear FGs does NOT constitute a camp of Ragefire, I got the guild and alliance I am in to blow through the FGs and we camped em for 53+(?) hours until he popped. Thank god my wife was away for the weekend.

Did I like what I did the last time? no. Do I think I was right and would do it again - unfortunately, yeah.

I always had at least 6-10 people with me (SS room is still good XP up to 58) and when I took a power nap I ensured folks had my number.

We have 4 AoVB clerics ready for Ragefire now and will need to do another marathon soon. (groan)

By best solution - do the overking before you are up for Naggy again (you are what - fifth in line?) and then just hold the camp after he drops. Kinda hard for anyone to contest your rights to a camp when you have a Naggy assault force there....
