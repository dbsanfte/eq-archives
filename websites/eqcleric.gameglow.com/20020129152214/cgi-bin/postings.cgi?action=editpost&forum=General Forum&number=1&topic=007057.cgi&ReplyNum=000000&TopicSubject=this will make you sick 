58th cleric
---

Many folks have aspired to be a necromancer and often ask my advice on being a necromancer. I am quite flattered to get asked questions and do my best to oblige in any way I can. However, as I have journeryed for over two years, I have come to rank many of my high-level necromancer friends as to their performance. I do not mean this to sound arrogant or mean spirited but the truth is some people just plain stink at being a necromancer. A few guildmates have encouraged me to write a guide on necromancers. What I have decided to do instead is share some tricks, secrets and tips that I have learned in my travels. 

Gather around you aspiring young adventurers and if you listen carefully and study hard maybe just maybe one of you shall be worthy enough to call himself my apprentice. Necromancy is a magical art but one that demands patience. If you wish to whack your opponents down in a blinding display of power go visit the Magician guild. Fear. To be successful in this art you must overcome fear in all its forms. I do not tolerate cowards. 

Life force this is what a necromancer has dominion over and can manipulate with great easy. Lifetaps or taps are the necromancer’s spells that does X damage to a mob and heals the necromancer for X damage. This spell is NOT a nuke. If you desire to go whack something down in glory go visit the Magician or Wizard guild. A lifetap is the most inefficient spell a necromancer has in their arsenal of offensive weapons to do damage with alone. However, to heal a bubble of health and do a tad of quick damage to the mob, they are one of the best spells in the game. There better be another reason a necromancer is tapping a mob when he/she is at full health other than to do damage to the mob. Knowing when to use taps is essential in learning hitpoint/mana management. You will also learn that those pesky healer types have itchy heal fingers, sometimes its best to let them now when you desire healing otherwise you are not being efficient. 

Necromancer healing can be quite efficient in the right environment. In fact, after reading this some clerics might just turn green with envy. A necromancer’s healing ability to others comes late in their career (after level 44). In fact, calling it a heal is a bit of a misnomer, it is actually a life force transfer from the necromancer to the target. This will be a long discussion so get comfortable my listeners. The spells needed to successfully do this are as follows: 

Pact of Shadow: Level 44 
24 second transfer of 300 hit points over time to target from necromancer 
Mana Costs: 10 
Casting time: 2 seconds 
Recast Time: 12 seconds 

Shadowbound: Level 54 
24 second transfer of 500 hit points over time to target from necromancer 
Mana Costs: 10 
Casting Time: 2 seconds 
Recast Time: 21 seconds 

Corporal Empathy: Level 44 
Instant transfer of 215 hit points to target from necromancer (Ouch!) 
Mana Costs: 200 
Casting Time: 3 seconds 
Recast Time: 9 seconds 

Bond of Death: Level 49 
54 seconds DoT drain of 720 hit points from monster to necromancer 
Mana Costs: 360 
Casting Time: 7 seconds 
Recast Time: 10 seconds 

Vexing Mordina: Level 57 
54 seconds DoT drain of 1,098 hit points from monster to necromancer 
Mana Costs: 495 
Casting Time: 5.5 seconds 
Recast Time: Instant 

Normally, when I am doing this I am in lich form, which is converting 32 hit points into 32 mana whether I am sitting or standing, and have the best possible regeneration spell I can get on me (regrowth adds +15 to my regeneration). When the mob is pulled into camp, I cast Bond of Death (“Bond” or BoD) on the monster, thus starting the hit point flow from the monster into me. BoD is a very low agro spell, so there is very little risk of me taking agro from the main tank. By the time I have BoD up on myself, the tanks are down about one bubble, I can then cast Pact of Shadows (Pact) and/or Shadowbound on the targeted group member transferring hit points from myself to the party member. By just doing this one rotation I get the following results: 

380 Mana used for healing of 800 hit points and damage to target of 720. Compare this to the cleric spell Celestial Healing, which does 748, hit points of healing for 225 mana in the same time frame. 

Now that sounds ok right? Well here is where it gets really juicy! Notice the recast times on the pacts verses the BoD? During the time I have one BoD going I can cast 4.5 Pact of Shadows or 2 Shadowbounds or a combination thereof. Ack you think I have committed suicide right that’s more hit points than I have – HaHaHa you fearful little toads. The Pacts act as DoT on me, so when I recast them it just overrights the previous casting thus I never take full damage from the subsequent pacts but the party member gets the full benefit of the heal. I generally only need to cast one quick tap sometimes two depending on the length of the fight to restore my own hit points. Now after I have multiple pacts cast for 1 BoD I can get the following results: 

380-410 Mana used for healing of 1,300-1,700 hit points over 24 seconds for the party, while the mob has taken 720 damage from BoD and maybe another 320-640 from a quick tap or two (1,040 – 1,360 damage total to mob). Compared just to the cleric Celestial Healing spell the cleric would require 2 castings for 450 mana to heal 1,496 hit points and done zero damage to the monster. If the cleric isn’t already green, well this will make you want to barf. After I have done all of that, I have already liched back all or most all the mana I used while the cleric will be lucky to have medded back a small portion of their mana even with clarity II. Remember lich generates mana for me standing or sitting, it is just that while sitting I get the normal regeneration boost in hit points and mana to make me even more efficient in medding. 

Now while I am doing this, my hit point bar is going up and down like a roller coaster. I am already losing about 15 hit points per tick from lich alone after you factor in regrowth. Casting one pact and one shadowbound costs me 800 hit points in 24 seconds. The multi-casting will cost me another 437-450 hit points maximum (that’s 4 pacts cast or 2 shadowbounds for one BoD), this is the incremental hitpoint costs I will get waiting for the spell to recycle through before I overwrite it again. That’s a total of 1,700 hit points flowing out of my little blue body maximum in under a minute without factoring in lich. To counter all this loss of life remember BoD is healing me 720 hitpoints in 54 seconds and 2 Defluxes get me 640 hitpoints in six seconds, so I can do all of this and only be down 340 hit points in after a full minute. I am able to take these swings in hit points now because my hit points with cleric buffs are 2,500 approximately and I have 1,500 approximately with just equipment and no buffs. 

I have found that the primary healer in the group really needs to understand necromancers and how this tactic works if the group is to be truly the most mana efficient. I am ALWAYS aware of my hitpoints during any fight, and know exactly how far I can push this, and where I will be at the end of the fight with hit points most times. If the primary healer is healing me cause they see my hit point bar jumping up down like a pogo stick they are wasting mana. If I get in trouble, I will let the healer know, otherwise they must trust me and what I am doing. 

While I have other more efficient spells to cause damage to the monsters, none of them are quite as group friendly as this little tactic. Take the 1,040 damage from this tactic; add my pet’s damage and that is still a nice contribution to offense alone for basically zero mana usage during a fight (I factor in my liching to offset mana costs). Adding in the healing is a huge bonus to the group and is a more mana efficient than letting the cleric do all the healing. With a necromancer supplementing the healing a group can pull almost non-stop cause the cleric can keep pace mana wise with the pulls. A good necromancer should always be able to keep up in mana with any group. 

One downside to doing this is I need the buff slots to do it. If I get grouchy cause someone casted extra buffs on me its because I need those slots to pact/bond. Remember the bond and vexing are a healing dot on me so that is two buff slots taken. When I use pact and shadowbound that’s two damage dots on me so there goes two more buff slots. Consider I am in lich with a regrowth, which uses up two more buff slots. In total I need six buff slots to do this out of my 15. I prefer to have my shielding and DMF buffs up at all times so that brings me down to only being able to get 7 buffs. If the cleric has cast Heroic Bond and a symbol on me that only leaves me room for 5 buffs. It doesn’t happen a lot but when the group gets buff happy it can cut into my ability to function if my buff slots are filled up with things I do not need as a caster. 

When I hit level 57 I get my BoD upgrade Vexing Mordina, which will drain 1,098 hit points in 54 seconds and give to me. The other really, really sweet thing is it stacks with BoD, so in reality I can have 1,818 hit points flowing in with these two spells alone and doing the same damage to the mob at the same time. HeHe I can not wait to test my limits with this new spell. 

Corporal Empathy can be handy in raids but I seldom use it when in experience groups. Unlike the pact spells it transfers immediately 215 hit points but costs me 200 mana. It is handy to shot one of these off if you don’t think the cleric is going to get that CH in on the main tank in time. 

For me the fun is nonstop casting during the fight. Mob comes in cast BoD, send in pet, Pact, Shadowbound, Pact, Pact, Pact, Deflux, Deflux mob dead and I am still good to go for mob number 2. If it’s a long fight I can add a second or third dot to the mob and still avoid agro. When I did the pit in Icewall with a cleric, shaman, druid, ranger, and monk, I did all of this and added two dots to the target and always finished with more mana than any other caster. Now watching my hit point bar, the groups hit point bars, my mana bar, my pet and its health, and switching back and forth on targets not to mention group chatting, well my fingers get a good workout. HeHe. I will admit though when I am casting multiple pacts on multiple party members, I have to really concentrate and remember who has which pacts going on which members. When we did Howling Stones and the rogue got some nasty HTs taken, I hit her with both pacts and the cleric hit her with Celestial healing, in the rogue’s own words “Wow a hitpoint explosion!” 

For advance tactics try throwing in ghetto mezzing, but that’s another topic for another day. Have fun my fellow adventurers. Oh and by the way these tactics are hardly any known secret but I find many necromancers that do not known anything about them. In addition, many seem reluctant to try them as well. It definitely is not a tactic for the weak of heart. 

 

PS I sacrifice my apprentices in the end, there can only be one true power in Norrath and it will be ME!
