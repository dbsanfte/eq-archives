          <blockquote>
            <p>The Bloodforge hammer quest begins by giving the two ogre heads
            from Zarchoomi and Corflunk to Byzar Bloodforge in Kaladim warrior
            guild.&nbsp; Both ogres are found in Butcherblock.&nbsp;&nbsp; Byzar
            will ask you to take a little trip to kill a dwarf by the name of
            Trumpy Irontoe and bring back his head. Trumpy is found in or around
            Fish's Ale tavern in Qeynos.&nbsp;&nbsp; Fish's Ale tavern is near
            the unused dock.&nbsp; If you try to kill Trumpy outright you will
            be slain by his bodyguard Bruno Barstomper.<br>
            <br>
            Hail Trumpy, he will say he wants some drinks.&nbsp; I believe he
            wants honey mead, I forget.&nbsp; You can buy these right there in
            the tavern.&nbsp; I had to give him 5 drinks before I got a
            response.&nbsp; He then says something about some guy.&nbsp; Ask
            about the guy.&nbsp; He says something about another guy, ask about
            that guy and Trumpy will say he didn't say anything about that guy
            and run out of the tavern.&nbsp; I followed him around behind the
            arena, rooted him and killed him.&nbsp; During the fight guards
            walked up and didn't interfere.&nbsp; Loot his head ( I got it first
            time I killed him ) and return the head to Byzar Bloodforge and you
            receive the hammer.<br>
            <br>
            When you kill Trumpy your faction with some evil groups will raise
            and your<br>
            faction with some good groups will lower.<br>
            <br>
            Hope this helps, sorry it is so vague.&nbsp; I was doing this at
            around 3AM so<br>
            some details are kinda vague.<br>

            </font><br>
            Just as Hamar said, Trumpy Irontoe hangs out in Fish's Ale tavern in
            Qeynos.&nbsp; He was very easy to find for me. I imagine as this
            quest becomes more well known, we will see a lot more people hanging
            out in that tavern, hehe.<br>
            <br>
            Trumpy asks you to buy him drinks. He does not respond to anything
            else further until you buy him Honey Mead (like Hamar said) and give
            him one. Trumpy will really like you now, saying you're not as
            worthless as you look, tells you to buy yourself a drink and get him
            another one, too. I had to give him 4 drinks before he started
            talking about the other characters, and you also get faction and
            experience (faction with the thieves guild, probably). The first
            character Trumpy talks about is Kane, saying he will have to tell
            Kane about you. Ask him about Kane, and he will tell you Kane runs
            the town and then he says something about Sragg. Ask him about Sragg,
            he will then say he didn't say anything about Sragg, he is obviously
            afraid of Sragg and his group for some reason, and he takes off and
            runs out of bar. Follow him out of the bar, if you kill him in the
            bar, the bouncer in the bar (who isn't really Trumpy's bodyguard, he
            is just a bouncer that doesn't like people killing the bar patrons,
            heh) will make short work of you. Once Trumpy walks out of the bar
            (he walks slowly, he is quite drunk by now), kill him.<br>
            <br>
            When you kill him, your faction with evil groups (ie, Kane Bayle)
            and the Corrupt Guards of Qeynos goes down and your faction with the
            Guards of Qeynos and the Merchants of Qeynos goes up (I guess the
            merchants don't care much for Trumpy and his nefarious ways).<br>
            <br>
            The head on Trumpy Irontoe is just labeled &quot;Dwarf's Head&quot;.</p>

            <p>The first step in the quest is to go to runnyeye and kill the
            monster known as Borxx.&nbsp; Borxx is a big evil eye and spawns way
            deep in.&nbsp; But once spawned, Borxx wanders around the entire
            area, so there's no telling where to find it.&nbsp; That's what is
            time consuming.....trying to find Borxx to kill it.&nbsp; What we
            did was just stay put instead of running our arses all over and wait
            for Borxx to come to us.&nbsp; Of course, then you run the risk of
            another group killing it.&nbsp; So&nbsp; we decided to camp the
            spawn spot. That way, if someone did kill it, we'd be there when it
            respawned.&nbsp; Now don't be confused by the big evil eye that
            sometimes has spawned when you first come in runnyeye.&nbsp; That
            one is different. The one you want is called Borxx.&nbsp; Now, after
            you kill Borxx, loot just ONE, and I do mean just ONE, lens off it.
            Make SURE you leave a lens on the corpse or the quest won't work.<br>
            <br>
            <font color="#FFFFFF" size="3">Two people can loot Borxx, one lens
            apiece.&nbsp; Just so long as the same person does NOT loot BOTH
            lenses.<br>
            </font><br>
            You will need at least one other person with you to do this.&nbsp;
            Give the lens to the other person, then create a male gnome
            enchanter agnostic mule character with VERY high charisma.&nbsp; Put
            all training pts into his charisma.&nbsp; He must have a high
            faction for this to work.<br>
            <br>
            Go to the Steamfont Mountains.&nbsp; Near Ak'anon there are a bunch
            of windmills...pass the windmills and continue in the valley from
            there, and along the left side of the mountain there are two
            observatories.&nbsp; The NPC you want there is BRON FRUNGA.&nbsp;
            Make sure your gnome has the lens at this point.&nbsp; Have the
            gnome enchanter Hail Bron Frunga.&nbsp; If your gnome enchanter's
            faction is high enough, she will tell him about the lens.&nbsp; Do
            what she says and give her the lens and she will give you the
            observer's staff.&nbsp; It is most definitely worth the
            trouble.....the stats on it are terrific.<br>

            <p>The location of Brona Frugrin is 1800, -200.&nbsp; When hailed
            and asked the appropriate questions, here's what she has to say:</p>
            <blockquote>
              <p>Well met Fandiren (which is the name of my mighty agnostic
              Level 1 Gnome Enchanter with maxed out Charisma). What brings you
              out this way? Are you interested in becoming an Observer? No, you
              look like the adventuring type. The wilds of the Steamfont
              Mountains is as far as my body goes. But through my [duties] as an
              Observer, my mind travels the cosmos.<br>
              <br>
              Well, I am quite an accomplished enchanter but most of my time now
              is spent crafting the magical lenses that enable us to see beyond
              the ceiling of Norrath and into other realms and dimensions. Say..
              In your travels have you encountered any [Evil Eyes]?<br>
              <br>
              Evil Eyes are dangerous creatures of great magical power. You will
              know one if you see one. There is a rumor that somewhere on
              Antonica there lives a powerful Evil Eye by the name of Borxx. I
              believe that with the Lens from her eye and some expert tinkering
              I could create a device that will enable me to observe the gods
              themselves in their native planes. If you were to bring me this
              lens the Eldrich Collective will reward you greatly.<br>

          <blockquote>
            <p>It is a quest that can be done entirely in Ak'Anon.&nbsp; You
            need to have a good faction with the Gemcutters (or Gemchoppers, who
            ever the warrior guild are) as they are the ones that actually give
            you the hammer. Manic Compten (I think that is his name, the
            spelling should be close) is the one that you need to give the
            completed blackbox of the head defective clockwork named Red V.&nbsp;
            Red V spawns deep within the Mines of Malfunction between 12AM and
            6AM game time (usually twice within this span).&nbsp; He needs to be
            killed quickly or else he will run for the door and be killed by a
            clockwork just outside the door.&nbsp; When he dies, he will drop
            some scrap metal, occasionally, some sprockets or gears, and of
            course, the incomplete Red V blackbox.&nbsp; To complete the
            blackbox, you need to get Blackbox Fragments off of the Obsolete
            Clockworks in the caves or from Runaway Clockworks that I see often
            by the Dragon skeleton to the West of the city gates.&nbsp; Fill up
            the incomplete blackbox with the fragments, click on combine, and
            give the completed blackbox to Manic in the Gemcutters guild.&nbsp;
            If your faction isn't high enough, you will get something else (I
            got a Round shield once), some money, and factions. It is a nice,
            nice hammer.&nbsp; Dmg 6, Dly 20, Weight 5.0 (I think), +2 Str, +2
            Agi, +2 Dex Lore Item.&nbsp; I sold mine today for 50pp because I
            could summon a hammer to use, and the quest isn't that hard.&nbsp; I
            think that Red V is like a 5-6 level MOB.&nbsp; If you'd like a
            little more info or anything, let me know, and I'll see what I can
            dig up for you.<br>

            honeycombs<br>
            can be obtained in the Misty Thicket quite easily by killing bixies).

            will reward you with some Honey Jum. Take the Honey Jum back to
            Aeston in<br>

            receive a rusty<br>

            enough with the<br>
