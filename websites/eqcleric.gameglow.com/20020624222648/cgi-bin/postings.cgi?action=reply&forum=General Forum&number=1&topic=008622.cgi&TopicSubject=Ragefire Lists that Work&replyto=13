Only those that actually come to skyfire and talk to the current camping cleric should be put on the list. This not only makes it more personable, it forces the current cleric camping to actually be at the camp, makes the list actually active, not just a list of names on a board that people can just ignore.<P>2. The first three clerics in line need to agree to help each other. Many people work or go to school during the day, and cannot always be there. The other clerics should help when the other person cannot be online for RL reasons and do everything in their power aka let the guild know, find out if someone else has their information, if ragefire happens to pop. IF none of this is possible, the next cleric in line gets the pop. Also, if possible, the guilds of those clerics should agree to help whoever is up on the list. My own personal greatest moment on my rage camp wasn't when I looted the heart, it was when 4 guilds of clerics that were sitting there with me, came to help. Now THAT is cleric cameraderie.<P>3. You must have ALL parts of the cleric epic done and over with before you get put on the list. This includes the solb ragefire turn-in guy. The epic is bottlenecked as it is, do not make it worse by getting on the list before you have gotton ixiblat, the king note, the shimmering pearl, etc. View it as a turn-in mob, like it use to be. This is just to be respectful to the other clerics.<P>These probably shouldn't be the complete list of rules, but I think they are pretty important not to forget. It all has to do with respect.<P><P>------------------<BR>Magada Caduceus<BR>59 Templar of Drinal</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#f7f7f7"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">horgran</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">The Torvonnilous server currenlty has a working rotation based on guild.  The list has been in place for some time now, at least 2 years I believe, with only a few infractions.  There is some dissent in the way we do it though and we are currently trying to work out a way to improve the situation.

Having to sit in one zone for days on end in the hope that you somehow manage to get the rage spawn would convince me to abandon all hope of the epic.

We don't have every guild on Druzzil Ro signed up on rotation, but we do have the majority of the major guilds.  The only requirement of the alliance is that member guilds respect the rotation and not try to KS others.  There is no requirement to provide forces to help camp, but the alliance is only as strong as our member guilds make it and help out when forces are needed.<P>This morning for example when I started my 3rd day of camping Ragefire, a group of non-alliance guild peeps moved into the corner to proclaim they were camping Ragefire.  A few tells and phone calls later and we had 3 groups there waiting including two warriors doing figure eights on top of his spawn point to insure first aggro.  The non-alliance peeps decided that they were tired and called it a night.  Ninety minutes later, Rage pops and we are unimpeded (except for a nasty Guardian Wurm add).<P>It isn't always perfect though.  A few weeks ago the same non-Alliance guild showed up while we were engaged with Ragefire for another member guild.  They "conveniently" thought we were "wiped out" (despite our plethora of int casters unloading and 4 additional groups topping the hill) and unloaded with manaburn to take the experience and the loots.  My advice to you when this happens is /REPORT everything!!  Scroll up and /report your first aggro and /report /who zone and anything else that may be important.<P>The key is to take the good with the bad and to make the best of an intolerable situation.  If you can organize even a few guilds to pledge support for you, you can get a majority of the Ragefire spawns.  Nobody wants to camp a full raid force in Skyfire 24 hours a day, but if you can spread the camp time amongst a larger pool of people it becomes not as horrendous.<P>Feel free to e-mail me with any questions about how we do things on Dru Ro at Zardnok@hotmail.com.  I doubt that this post made as much sense as I normally do, but I am still working on limited sleep after 3 days in Skyfire.<P><BR>Zarnok Anansi<BR>59th Templar of Tunare<BR>Officer of Evening Reign<BR>Druzzil Ro<BR></FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#f7f7f7"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">electrae</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Question for those of you that have working lists, do you ever have instances of people not following the rules?

Your luck with it could vary. I'm pretty sure a Luclin-style list may not be accepted in most server communities. Our list is universally-accepted, and has gotten to the point where practically everyone in the entire server 50+ level knows about the list. Guild politics mostly gets set aside for Rage, there are countless stories in Luclin where many bored members of "uber-guilds" come together to assist a small-guild cleric who happened to be at the top, with open Ragefire raids swelling to rediculous numbers, represented at times by 5 or 6 guilds. (Of course when an uber-guild cleric reaches the top, their raids tend to be small, quick, efficient, and in-house)<P>Anyway, over the last year or so, I've come up with several opinions on Rage lists, and what makes ours work. Take these however you will. ; )<P>1) Start Simple<P>Complexity kills. Rage lists that start out being super-complex books tend to die, as guilds who originally were open to the list are slow to understand how the blasted thing works, and finally gives it up. The Luclin list has grown complex with rules now, but we are very familiar with our complexities. We started with extremely simple rules and adapted over time as needed.<P>2) Start Early<P>For some older servers a Rage list is simply not a realistic option at all. Few things in the game are a flashpoint for guild hatred as much as Rage races and KS'ing. Once your server has had a long, long taste of FFA, you are already starting at a huge disadvantage, essentially having to convince many, many parties to bury the hatchet. This would probably be most applicable to the Bayles.<P>3) Get UNIVERSAL Consent<P>This is, by far, the most important thing. By universal, I am mostly speaking of each and every "uber-guild" signing on to it, without too many little bitty guilds opposed. Whatever it takes to get universal consent, you may have to be pragmatic. If one powerful guild tells you all to buzz off, that they will never respect the list, you may as well give it up and save everyone the heartache of losing what they had "earned" through the list.<P>4) The first order must be fair<P>The Rage list graveyard is littered with the corpses of lists that began with a single guild starting the list for the rest of the server, of course loading it with their own clerics. Whatever you need to do to figure out a first order that everyone agrees to, before additions are begun, is fine, but many list attempts tend to die due to a perceived unfairness on how it was originally set up. On Luclin, when the list began a long, long, long time ago, the quest was still new, and only a few people, which everyone knew each other, were doing the quest. So those 6 or 7 people set the order based on who had been camping Rage in solb the longest.<P>5) Communication, communication, communication.<P>If your server has a huge one-stop community that is widely used, as the Luclin server is fortunate to have with <A HREF="http://www.eqluclin.com" TARGET=_blank>www.eqluclin.com</A>  and their boards, then you have an advantage. Rage lists dont tend to live very well at all, when they are based on a guild's web site, or recorded only on a scrap of paper on some person's computer desk. Being easy to reach, and a central site would be helpful.<P>6) Committees Suck<P>Of all the Rage lists that fail almost right away vs those that live at least a little while before finally dying out, often a difference is at the top. If you are trying to have some council head this up, or worse yet, have the cleric on top "in charge" of the list he is participating in, passing the duty down to the next cleric, then new clerics that come by wondering what the list is for the first time, often will not see it as "real". "Who do I talk to to get on this 'list'." "Errm, I dunno, it changes... or, there's this group that decides things among themselves." This will have problems. A Rage list needs to be headed by one person with a Kindergarten-teacher's patience, a reputation for fairness, being willing to rule against their own guild if need be for issues, and preferrably already having the epic or not participating in the list themself if possible.<P>7) Keep the floodgates shut tight<P>Luclin very, very quickly adopted a requirement that you absolutely must have the whole quest done up to Rage once our list began. If I one day on a whim decided to announce that I would list any cleric who wants on above level 50, our large-yet-still-doable list would swell grotesquely, untill it became so large that new clerics would no longer be willing to wait on a 1-year+ list.<P>8) Individual based vs Guild based<P>These are the two basic approaches. Luclin's list is individual-based. Nearly every other list out there is guild-based.<P>An individual-based list is more difficult to start, because guilds, used to the idea of proposing guild rotations for critters, will be pushing for a guild rotation, before they would sign off on it. However, in the long run, I believe an individual-based list is more fair, and has a better chance to survive over time.<P>A guild-based list is much easier to start, and get universal acceptance... for a time. Guild-based lists suffer from a fatal flaw. They are not fair to the uber-guilds. The quickest way to destroy ANY agreement in this game is to make the uber-guilds mad. Just because an uber-guild happens to be larger than most, their #4 cleric has to wait a LOT longer than  their fellow clerics in small guilds. This also has encouraged "guild-hopping" in the past, with a cleric joining a small guild, convincing them to assign that cleric the role of being that guild's Ragefire rep, getting their epic, then leaving for the large guild they wanted to join all along.<P>These are just my opinions, of course I could be wrong. ; )<p>[This message has been edited by Cayleu (edited 06-01-2002).]</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#f7f7f7"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Grumbles</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">#3 Universal Consent.   There isnt universal consent and more than one guild has already stated that they will NOT honor the list if they have a cleric that needs.
