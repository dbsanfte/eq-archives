The 188 part is easy, the part after that is difficult and very expensive.  Probably more expensive and time consuming than going to 250 in JC.<P>Once you get to 188 then you've got to find someone to start lacquering gems, or you've got to skill up a JC-bot.  Buying stacks of opals... or other more expensive gems.  Eventually you get to the range of having a so-so shot at getting to make spirit stones, but the components are hard to come by and also extremely expensive.  They never trivial and expect to get lots and lots of failures.  Thus, they are very expensive.<P> <BLOCKQUOTE><font size="1" face="Verdana, Arial">quote:</font><HR>Originally posted by AgmyleezVargyle:<BR><B>I suggest making a level 1 crit dump some wis or int gear on him and master him if you have already went over the 200 mark in another trade.
