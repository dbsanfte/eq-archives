[B]The replies so far are much appreciated.  I *thought* Oribi was a lead GM for Brell, but I could be wrong on that score.  Still looking into it.

I would be more than happy to be set back to early Monday.  In fact, as I thought that's what would be done, I haven't done anything with Cozgrove to get exp or items.  This just seems like the easiest solution.  I realize that they might be hesitant about setting a public precendent, whereby some people might try to take advantage...but this really just seems like an instance where an exception should be made.[/B][/QUOTE]

I had just completed the Emil's Report quest, as I had done many, many times, and was suddenly KOS to Skyshrine when I gated back to that zone.  I checked many other factions on other continents to discover it had happened everywhere.  All I had worked for was simply gone.<P>I have since learned that this is not an isolated incident.  A post on Allakhazam's site dated 4/2 speaks of this happening to someone.  Just last night, it happend to another character I know--Dreamflayer.  I'm guessing that it's been happening a lot.<P>What is more distressing is that when I was finally able to speak to Brell GM Oribi, I found her to be polite but of no help whatsoever.  I was assured that absolutely nothing can be done.  I was told that nobody has the power or authority to alter faction in any way regardless of circumstance.  I was told that my character could not simply be reset to a point prior to the bug having occured.  I was told that there was absolutely nobody I could appeal to.  Can this be true?<P>After a year and a half of being a loyal subscriber with TWO accounts and a combined play time approaching 200 days...THIS is good customer service?<P>I have reported the bug, as I assume others have, but I will also be posting to as many other sites as I can find to try and discover how often this has been happening, when it's been happening, whether or not it was reported, and how it was resolved.<P>Has this bug happened to YOU?<P>I would still love to simply have what I worked very hard for returned to me.  I'm not asking for *extra* faction...only what I had before a programmer's bug unjustly took it away.  Thanks for taking time to look at this.</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#f7f7f7"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Islington</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Just wanted to add a comment.<P>What they told you about being unable to reset your faction is a flat out lie.

Each server, as I understand it, has one or sometimes two Lead GMs who are, well, more important. If Oribi is not lead GM, /petition for the email address of the lead gm (amusingly, these are of the form <initial><surname>@verant.com - the gm's *RL* initial and surname  <IMG SRC="http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/rolleyes.gif"> ) and email them. If Oribi *is* lead GM and still will not help, step up to eqmail@verant.com (although this is pretty useless from what I hear), avancouvering@verant.com (Absor), just about anyone you can think of @verant.com. Maybe even gwrinn@verant.com (Abashi) but that might be chancing it  <IMG SRC="http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/smile.gif">. Be polite, of course, but also persistent. You have a case. And restoring to an old save is *well* within their capabilities. Say you're prepared to sacrifice a day or a week of xp - that's what such a reset would do. If your server has an ezboard, wait till ezboard comes back up    <IMG SRC="http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/tongue.gif"> and try and find out the Lead GM's email address there.<P>So long as you are polite, I like to think you will get listened to.<BR><p>[This message has been edited by Niccy (edited 04-25-2001).]</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#dedfdf"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">electrae</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">This is not the first I've heard of this bug.
