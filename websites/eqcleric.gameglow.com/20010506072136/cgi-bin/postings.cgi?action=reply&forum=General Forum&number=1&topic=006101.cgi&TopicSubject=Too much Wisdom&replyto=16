<TEXTAREA NAME="ReplyMessage" ROWS=10 COLS=45 WRAP="VIRTUAL">[QUOTE]Originally posted by JanSorensen:
[B]In the high end game keeping wisdom down to 200 becomes increasing difficult except possibly for gnomes. You still have options though and so do I - but its narrowing down.

My wis giving gear is down to:

7 PMM 
5 EM Helm
15 Akkirus BP 
8 Donals Legs 
5 Weight of the Gods
25 Epic
5 Medicine Totem
2 Bracer of Swirling Smoke
5 Girdle of the Dilligent
10 Lodizal Shell Shield

With a base of 118 this leaves me with 205 wis - and I can only imagine the problems a HiE with 130 base wis must have. I obviously really need to swap the PMM out for an Enshrouded Veil and there are also a few other options to lower wis - but for many other slots any upgrade would yield even more wis (SBS -> Orb of infinite Void, Donals -> Templar/Akkirus, Med Totem -> Fetish etc)

Anyway, we can see my full equipment listing at [URL=http://eq.castersrealm.com/players/view_profile.asp?Id=9406]http://eq.castersrealm.com/players/view_profile.asp?Id=9406[/URL]  if thats of any help.

One other back slot item is the lozodial shield.. which I don't have yet, but seem to see more and more of those popping up.  One other thing you could consider instead of the earrings is your finger slots.. If you are using plat jaspar rings or even the velious ones, you may want to dump those for a golem ring or two.. or some other finger item rings that add ac. <BR>As far as gauntlets are concerned you could think about thunder etched gauntlets.. but they are pretty rare drop from what I have seen so far.  <BR>Dusklar 59th cleric </FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#f7f7f7"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">tailchaser</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Drop Forest Loops for Electrum Blue Diamond Earrings.

A few days later I spent 12 hours and 4 Place Holders trying to get a Live Grimrot.  I gave up when I found that a guildmate had the Scythe in his bank.  We chained the Quest and my Paladin now has an Aegis of Life.<P>I will NEVER get one for my Cleric though.  It's just too dang long.<P>With that being said though, the Aegis IS a GREAT item though.  If you want to do it, go ahead and camp the thing using the guides out there (kill the PH at the proper time to force a day/night spawn).  In between spawns, either log off or wander off or whatever.  I literally went AFK for 45 minutes and came back with no disturbances.  I set a timer for 3 hours to give me plenty of time to ensure that the camp was still mine.<P>It's a good item and if you go after it, good luck.

The Skeleton camp contains a bunch of Skeletons.  Inside the camp are a bunch of little “huts.”  One of these “huts” does not have a lantern on top of it, and it has 3 Putrid Skeletons sitting around it.  Inside the “hut” is Grimrot or his Place Holder.  The Place Holder is ALWAYS a Putrid Skeleton, will remain standing, and carries a rusty broadsword.<P>Now when you arrive at the camp and the PH is up, you’re lucky and can begin to camp it right away.  If not, you’ll need to wait for Grimrot or the PH to spawn.  This Skeleton and Grimrot are on a 3 Hour 20 Minute timer.  That means that you will get one pop every 3 hours and 20 minutes real time.<P>To get the Aegis of Life you need two items.  The Decaying Heart off of the Dead version of Lord Grimrot and the Pestilence Scythe off of the Live version of Lord Grimrot.  Note that the Dead Version will also drop a Scythe but it is not the correct one.  The correct one comes from the Live version and is a No Drop item.<P>To get Grimrot to spawn you must kill his Place Holder.  You should kill the Place Holder at 6pm Game Time to force a Live Grimrot to spawn (or another PH).  Kill the Place Holder at 6am Game Time to force a Dead Grimrot to spawn (or another PH).  What you are doing is ensuring that the next pop occurs during the day or night to get the proper version of Grimrot.  THAT is the reason your friend didn’t want anyone to kill the Standing Skeleton.  If you kill it at the wrong time, you will get the wrong version of Grimrot (or his PH).<P>That’s the reason this camp sucks so bad.  Grimrot is a rare spawn with place holders and an insane timer on him.  You can spend a 24 hour, real life day here and you will only see 7 or 8 Grimrot’s or Place Holders.  I got insanely lucky with the Dead Version.  He just happened to pop as I was going through the skeleton camp.  The Live version I camped for over 12 hours before chaining the quest with a friend.  The Aegis is great and I love mine, but I doubt I’ll do the quest for my Cleric since my Paladin grew so frustrated with the darn camp.<P>BTW, in between spawns I went AFK for large amounts of time.  I went shopping, I took a shower, I cleaned, I read a book, etc.  The camp is very safe and I never ran into anything that would attack me so long as I remained standing (as soon as I sat down, low green mobs would attack me).<P>Hope that this helps.  It’s a great item but it’s not fun.  Good luck.<BR><P>------------------<BR>Quistil Angelwatch<BR>Cleric of 30 Seasons in the service to the Great Mother Tunare<BR>Islington Angelwatch (Semi Retired)<BR>Paladin of 52 Seasons in the glorious service to Erollisi Marr<BR>Phoenix Crusaders</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#dedfdf"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Puggins</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Heh, I got a couple of alterntae suggestions:<P>1.  Lose both forest loops.  Lug 2000pp worth of rubies to innothule and get yourself a Lynuga's hoop, which is 6ac 6wis 6hp.  Replace the other one with an electrum bs earring (ac2 hp35 mana25), sarnak earring (AC5 Str5), or cougar earring (AC4<P>2. I agree with replacing your mammoth cloak, but I don't think that the grimrot camp is worth it.  If you're gone camp something, I'd do the Hooded Black cape (AC10, hp45, STR5).  If you want to get original, buy a full plate cape from a human smith (AC12).  The enchanted version also has 2wis, which is a bonus.<P>3.  Jade rings have to go if you're still wearing them.  Replace them with Velium Fire opal rings (AC6 HP65).<P>4.  Easiest way to upgrade bracers: go to icewell and wait for a couple of the nodrop ac10 wis3 bracers to fall off guards.  Getting two of these drops your wis by 4 and ups your ac by 12.<P>If you decide not to camp anything at all, you can get a non-enchanted full plate cloak, 2 vel rings, BS earring and Lynuga's hoop for a few thousand plat and get the following adjustments:<P>AC +21 (raw)<BR>HP +165<BR>Mana +25<BR>WIS -18 (assuming you have vel jade rings, less if plat)<P>This will still keep you above 200 and increase your survivability by a ton.  Keep in mind this is the lazy method.
