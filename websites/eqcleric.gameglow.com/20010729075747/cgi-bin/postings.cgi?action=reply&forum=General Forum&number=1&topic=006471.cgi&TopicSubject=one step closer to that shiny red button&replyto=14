[B]You forgot mana regen.  We are the only caster class that doesn't get any form of this (yes, even the mage's rods would be nice).

Why don't clerics get upgrades? Its simple, we are the limiting factor for how people advance in the game.  If people can kill ubermobs too easily its the cleric's fault and thus should be nerfed.  We have seen this time and again (donals, MoK, etc).  Thus other classes can reach our skill level and not impose on that 'limit' that clerics have. This means VI doesn't care if druids can heal as well as clerics, they just cant pass that 'limit' that affects gameplay.  But why cant clerics get non-healing ability upgrades? Its because VI sees clerics as the holders of this 'limit' that controls the pace of advancement in the game, thus clerics are all-powerful and can have NO upgrades.

Absor made it clear some time ago that they didn't plan any big changes for clerics (as with most other classes), and that any "final balancing" was likely to be minor.<P>That said, I'll agree that it's annoying the way they've left the "final class balance" discussion hanging in midair for all this time.<BR></FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#f7f7f7"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Cayleu</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">*shrug* What, exactly do we as a class need?

Giving clerics the ability to summon pets close to their level and the ability to nuke for 2k damage... that's earthshattering. Making Fortitude slightly better than Heroism (since it's in a higher level)... I don't call that earthshattering.<P>Most of what was in the "class balancing" was minor. Stuff like fixing MoK, making the "pet" not suck quite so bad (I liked the immune to AEs idea) and self invis (long overdue, IMO) are minor things. None of them will significantly change our gameplay<P>Bottom line: I'm not worried about what he said.

Their idea was to iron out all the bugs, missing items, and bad spells for the classes, not add new stuff.  The horrible truth is that bards were done first and they had a number of missing/broken effects.  When other classes saw bards getting songs fixed and new songs, they decided they could just ask for brand new kick-ass spells and get what they wanted.  That wasn't VI's intention at all.<P>VI simply didn't know what to do when everyone from every other class spammed them asking for new spells, new specialties, new equipment, new disciplines, and a handful of fixes, so they simply ignored the issue until it died, rather than explain what they wanted to do and incense the playerbase.<P>"promise us things will be changed"<P>What did VI ever promise you would be changed?  They did a bunch of stuff for the bard class that were obvious bugs/broken effects.  Absor then made a list of items, presented it to the live team, and the vast majority of the items got shot down.</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#f7f7f7"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Resurrector</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">You guys are NUTS!<P>Please please please please please please please NEVER ask verant to look at our class.

This is kinda like watching Mark McGuire approach Hank Aaron's record.<P>There is a significant amount of hostility towards clerics over at VI. If you read any of Gordon or Alan's post on classes, they generally manage to sneak in some reference to clerics.  Basically, they think that clerics are "necessary" and no one class should be "necessary".  Accordingly, any "fix" that makes clerics more "necessary" gets 86'd. <P>The class balance thread in regards to clerics quickly devolved into a war between disgruntled non clerics, druids who were incensed that clerics were hostile to the idea of druids getting sup heal earlier, clerics that wanted to melee, clerics that wanted to solo, clerics that wanted to heal better, etc etc etc.<P>Quite frankly, VI doesn't know what to do with us, partly because we are such an awesome class.  A group without a cleric is simply not going to accomplish as much as a group with a cleric.  You can not insert any other class in there and still have that be a true statement.  <P>However, all that being said, with the advent of new games coming out on the market in the very near future, they are going to lose some business.  They are going to do some things to try to prevent loss of their market base. Changes you want to have happen and changes you don't want to have happen will be coming down the pike very soon, regardless of what they say.<P>For those of you who played UO, in the last days, there was a tremendous exodus to EQ.  UO tried to respond by making some very positive changes to their game.  It was unfortunately too late.  At some point, they couldn't give away their game to folks.<P>EQ has been out for a long time.  The longer you play a game like this, it will just become boring after a while, no matter what they do to it, or how much you like it.<P>EQ's days are numbered.   <IMG SRC="http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/smile.gif"><P>But they will be making some changes soon.<P>Tarf</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#f7f7f7"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Alle</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Alas Verant has a reputation for promising things they are unable to deliver and then turning around and saying that you misunderstood them in the first place.

By the time they got to clerics, they had already moved on to other things.<P>Clerics have the smallest pool of worthwhile spells of any caster(worhwhile = I might actually cast this spell and feel it was worth the mana sometime in my clerical career).  We have way too many garbage spells.  <P>We are the only pure caster who doesn't get regular invisibility, levitate, night vision, see invisible.

Melee?, etc.  <P>LOL clerics can't even summon or make bandages.
