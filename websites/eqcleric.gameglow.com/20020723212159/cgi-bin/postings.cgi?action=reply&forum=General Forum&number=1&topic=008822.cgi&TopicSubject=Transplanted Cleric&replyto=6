So starting out life "again" can be hard.<P>Just last night I strolled up to a group in LFG mode and they laughed me off because I was nekkid. *sigh* So, where can I go at this level to solo some mobs so I can get some lowbie armor and some good coin to rebuild myself without taking a lifetime?<P>.. anyone with help or suggestions, let me know!

The spawn rate is slow on elementals, so you can clear them before they respawn and catch up on mana.  You won't be agro to much at 41 either.  You just need to find some buyer that will pay 500+ platinum each.  You can get some decent equipment in a weekend of camping I would think.  The drop rate is very rare, and only the elementals drop it, not the pets.  Save the Lava Rocks, Drops of Mercury and Swirling Mist to sell also.</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#f7f7f7"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">horgran</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Chrol is the head GM on Torv so he would be a good one to talk to.<P>At level 41 you could solo most of the mobs for the temple of ro quests, or just ask someone in the zone for help.  You will ned to save up some money to buy the plat bars but with some rl friends on the server you should be able to save up a few plat fairly quick.<P>Making plat by farming greens is going to be tough without any melee ability.  If you get desperate, head to some newbie zones.  People will be overing you money to powerlevel them.  Not the best option but one that will provide some money.<P>Also, the jarsath is not useable by dwarf clerics.  Not sure what race you are but keep that in mind.  If you can use it, then do try to loot some.  Since it is no drop it really does just rot.  It's not unusually some brave level 10 shaman to wonder over and get a full set just for being there.</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#dedfdf"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">JanSorensen</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">I wouldnt petition for help.
