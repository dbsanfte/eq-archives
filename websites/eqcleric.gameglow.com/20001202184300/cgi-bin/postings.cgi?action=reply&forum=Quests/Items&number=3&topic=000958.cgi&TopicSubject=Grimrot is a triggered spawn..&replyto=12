Anyhow i sat at Grimrot's camp for about 3 hours I think, and nothing ever spawned in his spot. (I've spent about 18 hours there now, and killed the live version 4 or 5 times, so i know his spot definitely, the 3 standing putrids are a giveaway)  Anyways, I'd remembered reading something here a while ago about someone not seeing anything in that spot for 5 or 6 hours.  <BR>  So, being bored out of my skull with not even placeholders to kill, I started to think about why it wasn't spawning at all.  So I ran to Qeynos, had Camlend give me the quest, and i gated back to SK, wouldn't you know all three placeholders were up.  Of course, a paladin had taken over my camp by the time I gated back, but at least now i know if nothing spawns there, it definitely needs to be triggered in the Priests of Life guild.<BR>  Something else of note, since I'm *not* an idiot.  I tried creating a level 1 human cleric on my second PC, to go trigger the quest, but it didn't make a difference, since he couldn't get the quest.  I believe you actually have to get the quest itself to trigger the Grimrot or his placeholders spawn.<P>Just something that might be found useful<BR>Khalim Richelieu<BR>The Pantheon<BR></FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#f7f7f7"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">khamrynn</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Although it possibly could speed up him spawning I doubt it's neccessary. It's been a while since I camped it but from what I remember, if you keep the two area's clear and make sure you kill ghanex drah as soon as he spawns grimmy will spawn relatively soon after. A few times I got both live and dead spawn at the same time after killing both ph's then killing drah right after. However considering how rare the undead version is, it wouldn't hurt to try this heh.</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#dedfdf"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Wynona Brownbeaver</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">I did faction crap for a week until Cameland would give me the quest. When he finally  gave the response I was after, I immediately ran to south karana and killed every spawn in that camp for roughly 3 hours. No Grimrot. Screw it, I was alone and would've had my ass handed to me by the live one anyway.<P>------------------<BR><B>Wynona Jugg</B> - lvl 40 Dwarven cleric<BR><I>Mith Marr</I></FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#f7f7f7"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Khalim - Innoruuk</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">  Well, I'm not sure if I was misleading in my post, but i didn't even get placeholders for over 3 hours after the server had just come up.  I've camped him for 18-30 hours previously, and always got placeholders within 30 minutes or so, which makes me think this worked.  And in response to the second guy, its very possible while you were camping him, someone else was working on faction, and in fact got the quest.<P>  As I said, its not some neat trick to make him spawn and be done with it, I just believe he won't start spawning, himself, or placeholders, until someone triggers it after a server outage.<P>Just my .02<BR>Khalim Richelieu</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#dedfdf"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Seolta</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">I guess I have really strange luck or something: I've gotten the Dead Grimmy 3 times, and the live one NEVER.

On the third occasion, I had a 40th warrior and 43rd monk for company, and we wasted him with minimum effort.<P>On the first two occasions, I was just killing the putrid skellies for faction (and the others for bone chips for faction) - both times, live Grimrot spawned within 30 minutes or so.  He was already up on the third occasion, when we dropped him.  Maybe I just got lucky, but it seems to me that indiscrimate slaughter of that camp does help him to spawn...<P>So I now have the scythe, and my faction is up to low warmly with the temple - that shield will be mine one day  <IMG SRC="http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/smile.gif"><P>Oh, another thing - if you want to clear that camp quickly, just tag everything in it with one blow, gather them all round you, and blast out Word of Souls (or better).  150 points of AoE - works wonders  <IMG SRC="http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/smile.gif"><BR><P>------------------<BR>Morrun Catspaw<BR>Halfling Cleric (41st)<BR>Albion - Death Before Dishonour!<BR>Cazic-Thule Server</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#dedfdf"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Dalur - Veeshan</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Have you had luck doing this?
