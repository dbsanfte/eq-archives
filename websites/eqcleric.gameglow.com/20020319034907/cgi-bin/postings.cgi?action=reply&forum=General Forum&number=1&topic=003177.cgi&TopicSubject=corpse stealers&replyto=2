She stated that Summ then proceeded to loot all her stuff and logged.  I have never known Andrade to lie; she is a friendly and trusting person.  also, she has many high level friends who give her nice things because she is such a sweetheart  <IMG SRC="http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/smile.gif">  I had no reason to doubt her; however, I did ask Summ the next day 3 times what happened to her stuff.  He did not reply.  I then told him 3 times (to prevent claims of being unable to hear due to zoning, etc.) that if he did not return her things I would announce his actions in every zone I entered and would publish his name in every test server forum.  He did reply to me, but promptly messaged Andrade that his son had used his account, and the boy was now grounded, however he could not find any of her things.  At this point I was certain--heh, everybody has heard this old whopper before.  He did not offer to replace her items--when she told him she had no money or items left he did not even give her food money--he didn't even offer to buff her  <IMG SRC="http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/smile.gif"><P>Thanks for listening!</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#f7f7f7"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Boanerges</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Did you petition this person?

The only reason I consented was because my corpse was in a place where retrieving it would have been extremely difficult.  The GM would not restore my character, and the guy was not banned.  I was fortunate enough to have friends help me replace everything, but the experience was quite disheartening.  I can understand why people would consent.  After all, most of us would never even think of doing this to another, so we tend to believe that people wouldn't do this to us. It is truely sad that some people find this type of action something good to do.  I hope you did petition this.  I hope your head GM actually does something about it.  I am very glad of your actions of telling everyone.  A ruined reputation is the next best thing to a banning.

I think the term they used is "ganking"<P>Works like this... Powerlevel a caster up to a pretty high level (say 40) and strim him/her of all their equipment and give them 8 bags. Now, bind yourself in a zone where people frequent (say West Commons). Now, let's say a warrior happens by and he's carrying his hard earned YK. Suddenly he's hit out of nowhere either by magic or a pet and a few seconds later he's dead.<P>Warrior returns to find his precious YK gone so he goes to get revenge. He finds this caster and somehow manages to kill him/her. He then loots the corpse, regaining what money he had but, much to his horror, there are only bags. And you cannot loot items in bags. There is also no equipment of value to loot either.<P>Not sure how rampant it is but it definitely is quite feasable to do this and farm items from other players.<P>And Verant has said they won't fix that problem just as they won't implement a /drag command.<P>------------------<BR>Boanerges Thundercry<BR>Erudite Cleric of Prexus<BR>Proud member of The Steel Wind<BR>Cazic Thule Server<BR></FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#f7f7f7"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Apenance</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">I prefer the item loot myself, I love the challenge.

Don't die where you can't get your corpse, back when we didn't HAVE the /corpse command, you just had to bite the bullet, lose xp and get your corpse back.<P>Don't see why people want an easy game...<P>I want others to be able to screw me.
