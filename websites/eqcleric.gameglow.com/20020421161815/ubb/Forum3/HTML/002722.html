</FONT><HR>  Hello friends.  I'm posting this with the hopes of rallying enough support to get verant to reconsider the spawn time for ragefire in skyfire mountains.  Here is why I think a change is in order.<P>  Currently all the mob encounters leading up to a fight with ragefire can be done in 1-2 days.  Lord bergurgle is a random timer, but almost always spawns within a 24hr period.  Lord Gimblox is also on a random timer but follows the 24hr time frame.  The plasmatic priest spawns several times a day.  Ixiblat and the king in chardok both have a two hour respawn timer.  The turn in for solb is on a 24hr timer.  <P>  Then you come to skyfire mountains.  So far in my 5 weeks of camping him he has averaged a 5day spawn time.  This is entirely too long of a gap for him to spawn in when you consider the number of clerics waiting to get his piece.  You can have 4-5 clerics a week be up to the ragefire point easily.  Yet if ragefire spawns twice in that week your server is considered lucky.<P>  With the lack of gm enforced rules governing who gets what mobs this type of system only plays into the hands of the larger guilds.  A smaller guild that might enlist help to get the king note can not form in the amount of time that a larger guild can have sufficient force to take him out.  This means that even though most clerics can get the quest complete up to the point of killing ragefire, only the ones in the strongest guilds actually stand a decent chance of taking him.<P>  I understand that the cleric epic is very beneficial to the guild that has it.  I also understand verant's policy of making epics something that are not attained by everyone.  Unfortunatly this only holds true for certain classes.  Some classes are able to get their epics with relative ease while other classes will only get it if they are in the strongest guilds and spend 6months or more working on getting the rarer items for it.  The disperity in the difficutly of epics ridiculous.  To tell one class they can have their epic and another class that their epic will not be gotten as often is pure foolishness.  All epics should be equal in ease to attain or in difficulty to obtain.  Unfortunatly at this point they can not be radically changed.  <P>  The cleric epic attainability can be put on par with some of the other classes merely by increasing the spawn rate of ragefire.  If he was garunteed to spawn randomly within 3 days(72hours) then the bottleneck for the cleric epic would be done away with.  In the process of this remove all loot from ragefire except for the cleric item, similar to the spawned fay for druids.  This would ensure that only clerics are intersted in ragefire being killed.  It would not flood a server with cleric epics either, but would give some of the smaller guilds the chance to complete this quest without having to be crushed under the heels of larger guilds.<P>  For now I will continue my vigilance in skyfire.  I'm currently on my 5th week of being here.  At first I was learning what I could from the cleric that was here before me.  Her guild got the kill, but it went to someone else and she left the zone.  I then started watching for him.  Another cleric from a larger guild came in and also did the same a few days later.  I know this guild well, for I was once in it.  I chose not to race them as they would more then likely beat us and I saw no point in keeping vigile only to have him taken from me.  When she got her rage I reinstated my camp.  A few days later a different cleric from the same guild I used to be in moved in zone.  This time I have not backed down.  I'm on my 4th day straight of being at his spawn oint 24/7 with the help of my husband.  I'm afraid that when he does spawn the larger guild will get him again.  If they don't there is a new watcher that came in today from a different larger guild who I will have to race also.  Sadly I feel that my days upon days of lookout duty will bear me no fruit.  My guild is trying for the first cleric stick since we reformed on our server.  Unfortunatly the entire design of this point of the quest is in favor or larger guilds that can assemble dragon killing forces in 5-10minutes.  <P>  Hopefully we can get verant to adjust this quest so that all clerics no matter size of guild have a chance, just a chance, of getting their epic.  It's sad to see that the defining fight for an epic weapon is not a battle with a dragon, but rather a fight with larger,faster guilds and the effort of constantly mainting a presence in case a mob does spawn.  Epics are not a series of mighty battles with horrible foes that lead to a weapon blessed by the gods.  They are rather a series of sleepless nites and battles with large guilds who feel might makes right in their never ending search for yet one more elite item to add to their inventory.<P>Please verant make the epic quest something that you can do without having to spend days on end waiting merely on a mob to show up.  Make this game fun again rather then a tedium in hopes of recapturing the fun that you once enjoyed.  <P>  </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#f7f7f7">

</FONT><HR>I may get a lot of flak(sp?) for this, but I don't care one way or another if they change the spawn time.  Yes Ragefire in SF is all I have left to do.  If you are in a big guild, good for you.  You don't have to worry about getting the people there.  If you are in a small guild it is all about making friends.  Ally with other small guilds.  Talk to everyone.  When your time comes you may have to send buttloads of tells, but I'm sure people will help you.  My guild is on the smallish side.  We have no clickers.  We also raid consistantly with another guild.  Between the 2 of us we have 5 clerics that only need Ragefire (of those 5 2 need to solb). <P>My point is Verant has said time and time again that they do not want epics to just flow into the game.  They are not trying to eliminate the bottleneck..they just dont want any part of our epic anymore.  I think it is "ok" the way it is..<P>------------------<BR><A HREF="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=14272" TARGET=_blank>Phalia Kordain</A><BR>59th Templar<BR>Lords of Belterra<BR>Xegony</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#dedfdf">

</FONT><HR>On CT server last night our GM had two guilds roll for the rights to Ragefire. This was after a cleric from my guild had spent two days straight there. He said that camp time is a player rule, not a Sony rule. He also said that randoming is being done across all servers now. Frankly, that's more involvement than I expected from Sony since it's so obvious that they want to reduce the rate of cleric epics entering the game. I guess short of a server crash or bringing the zone down, there was nothing he could do except make them roll so he could stop answering petitions and get back to playing Gems, the game invented for the Ragefire camp.<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#f7f7f7">

</FONT><HR>I support this. They said when they revamped SkyFire to have Ragefire spawn, that he would spawn once every 1-3 days. It is more like 4-6 days. On our server, more than one conflict occured over this spawn.<P>I got my Epic last saturday, but it was after an ugly race which left a bitter taste to my Epic. I don't think it is right that people who are generally helpful should be set up into fierce competition with one another. To me, this encounter is really poorly designed.<P>I see only two solutions here.<BR>- Rewrite the entire Cleric Epic. Prevent ugly encounters like Ragefire alltogether.<BR>- Change the nature of the Ragefire spawn in SkyFire. Maybe make him like Phinigel Autropos; spawning every 12 hours, but only 15% chance to drop the Heart Container. Maybe a few bits of other loot, but not the loottables it used to have. Or maybe make him drop two Heart Containers (first, Dragon Hearts are big, second, don't they have two for such a huge body?).<P>Anyway, this encounter is not good the way it is now. The general inflow of Epics (any Epic) should be regulated by difficulty of content, and not lack of content.<P>------------------<BR>- Kaysha Soulsinger<BR>Vicar in the 54th Circle of Erollisi Marr on Lanys T'Vyl<BR><I>The road to Heaven is paved with stones from Hell</I></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#dedfdf">

</FONT><HR>Phalia<P>  Yes, I know all about having friends.  I have them.  The problem lies in that while I'm sending out a multitude of tells and my friends are trying to find ports the larger guild is simply saying "everyone to skyfire druids get them there".  In 5minutes they can have a force to kill him while I'm sending tells to my friends.  It's truly an epic encounter when the only way to get it is to be in a large powerful guild.  Yep, really epic there.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#f7f7f7">

</FONT><HR>I agree and sign. <BR>I have also been camping ragefire for the final part of my epic for 3 weeks now, I have not been able to assemble the forces fast enough to take him down when he poped because other bigger guild's have been able to get the guys there that thay need to down him. I have help arranged for the kill but it takes a X amount of time for me to send the tells needed and get the peeps there instead of just saying /guild Ragefire POPED come now!!, I am also the first in my guild to get epic, but we are not a large guild we have about 30 50+ peeps but never enough to beat the larger ubber guild to the spawn. <P>There has got to be a better way of doing this while i have been camping i have seen almost wars started between guild's trying to kill ragefire first i mean is this the kind of enviroment SEQ is trying to condone a camp that is made to cause major disagreement every time the mob pops and also causing a GM to moderate most ever time the mob pops? I know about the not wanting to get too many cleric epic's in game but lets face it every guild wants at least one cleric in guild to have a epic it is just too valuable to a guild as a whole and no matter how hard you make it most guild's will still put all there weight to getting that epic before any others. <P>What I am asking is for the ability to kill ragefire in a guild that is not one of the top 5 on the server if you need to see the reason see how many thay have in guild with epic and what guild's are killin ragefire when he pops the same ones every time. <P>Now with all the bad things I have seen with the new ragefire spawn i have also seen guilds take care of it between themselves by having the cleric's camping him atm roll for the heart and then helping each other kill the mob. If only more guild's took this aproach I would not be so conserned because I would know that sometime I would be able to roll and win the mob. but alas that is not how it is in the world of EQ. <P>I started my epic way before the changes and talked to several cleric's about the Sol B ragefire and have heard of many camping him for over 90+ hours which worried me greatley but then thay announced the changes I was very excited thinking I would have a real shot at getting epic now. But I have blown the 90+ hours camping him out of the water I dont even know how many hours I have there and have talked to numerous cleric's that are in the same boat. This is just too much of a demand on a cleric's time even with this being a epic. <P>I have read many intresting solutions to the problem but the one I think has the most weight to it is the having 3 separate camps for the final part of the epic with the cleric having to get a item off each mob to complete the heart of ragefire but having the camps at a shorter duration or mabey trigered like the monk final four. I am not sure what needs to be done but something has to be done about this camp it is hands down the worst in the game, it takes away from the enjoyment of the game for many peeps that just do not have the time to sit at a camp that thay have almost no chance of killin the mob if he even does spawn then when you factor in the server crashes or maintance resets on the spawn he just isint up enough. <P>well just my 2c worth anyway I hope if you read this you will see where I am coming from. <P>Ninil Goodsoul<BR>Guild Leader Alliance of Steel<BR>54 Cleric of Tribunal Server.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#dedfdf">

</FONT><HR>Well then phalia, stop being part of the problem and come up with a solution.<P>You say that you don't like the camp.  That you don't think it's fair.  Yet you offer no solution.  You simply try to point out supposed flaws without providing any answers.  I'm not here just griping about this stupid camp.  I'm providing a solution along with reasons I feel that this needs to be changed.<P>You say a greatly reduced chance.  How much is that? 1%,5%,10%?  If a 10% chance then I'd have to see 10 rages pop to get mine.  At his current spawn rate that is 3months of non stop camping.  3months of being online as close to 24/7 as possible simply because I'm not in a guild that can take down a dragon at the drop of a hat.<P>  Put the heart on spawnable mobs, adjust the timer so he spawns more often, make a forum for each server where clerics sign up and he is designated by a first come first serve basis where a gm moderates, make him triggered from the turn in to zordak in solb.  Something, anything  but please find some way to allow people in the smaller guilds to be able to finish this epic without investing such a huge chunk of time.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#dedfdf">

</FONT><HR>first.. dont bother camping your clr there. just camp a gimp there to check on him. if you see him up you can make an attempt to rally. you say you cant do this cause your a small guild. well.. thats kind of the whole point of epic. how ever many small guild clerics have gotten there epics so obviusly it can be done. <P>second, I think someone killed him 1,2, or 4 times without telling you while you were checking on him for 5 days in a row. I dont think rage is allowed a 5 day spawn timer. infact ive been understanding it that 3 days after the server has veen up, he is on a randomized 24ish hour timer. </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#dedfdf">

</FONT><HR>Commbat_Meddic, <P>The problem with Ragefire has not changed. They will not change the timer to make him spawn more often. Why? Because they have said that they want to keep a control on how many cleric eipcs come into the world. Yes that is harsh and a bitter pill to swallow but I don't see it changing. <P>They will also not make a forum for each server where a cleric puts his name on the list and a GM takes it and says, "Serving #127 please! Step up to the window!" No, that would be more like a Legends server and most of us are not on Legends. <P>What we have on our hands now is just like what the warriors have as far as killing and obtaining Sev in EJ. <P>What I would petition for is to have them check and verify on the spawn timer to see if it's working as intended. We were told it was a 1-3 day timer but we have found otherwise. Have them conform to the original timer. <P>That is my suggestion. And for the record, yes I have my swirrling pearl. <BR><P>------------------<BR><A HREF="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=15286" TARGET=_blank>Spawrhawk Wormwood</A><BR>High Priest of Fennin Ro</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#f7f7f7">

</FONT><HR>I got lucky with my ragefire (skyfire version) and got the first one to spawn on Povar after the move out of solb.  Nobody else was camping it (it was presumed to still be broken) and he was up when I logged in.<P>That said, I was prepared to sit there (and beg others to sit there with me) for the time it would take for it to spawn.  I don't -like- that painfully long camps are required for some of the items I (note the word I use is not need) want.  I do, however, see the need for this to be the case.  Epic weapons aren't intended to be obtained by everyone, cleric or otherwise.<P>Yes, the cleric epic has a great effect.  Thats why you have the level of contention for this spawn.  Really, the rest of the epic is inconsequential.  Ixiblat and Chardok king are the longest spawns throughout the rest of the quest, at 72ish and 120ish minutes respectively.<P>With a little luck with gimblox and bergurgle, the cleric epic can be done up until zordak in about 6 played hours, with a single group.  Takes a pretty focused, coherent, capable group, but it can be done.  For that reason, I won't expect the skyfire quest to be changed much, if any.<P>I agree with VI, limiting items entry into the world.  I was an epicless cleric for a long time, and it was a very rare occurance (during exp or in a major guild raiding) that  being without an epic was an issue.  When I had time to finish the quest, I did so.<P>What I do find unfortunate is that my epic spends the vast majority of its life now in a bag.  If I wasn't too forgetful, I'd probably put it in the bank, and still be able to pull my weight in exp groups, and along the way in guild raids.<P>I'm sympathetic to people that can't devote days to camping skyfire zordak, but I don't see that trivializing the limiting factor of the quest as a solution.  That mightn't be a popular opinion, but, nobody said we all have to agree  <IMG SRC="http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/wink.gif"><P>--Kanroc<BR>--High Priest, Triton<BR><P>------------------<BR><A HREF="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=92322" TARGET=_blank>Magelo Profile</A></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#f7f7f7">

</FONT><HR>Here's what I think should be done with Ragefire:<P>The problem: Ragefire spawns every 3 days (give or take), and is heavily contested.  Making him a faster spawn isn't going to happen since Verant don't want epics entering the world any faster than they do now.<P>(I'm not sure I understand the logic there, since Bergurgle and Gimblox are already somewhat rare, but it's true that there's a big backlog of clerics with their pearl, me included).<P>So...<P>Change the Ragefire to a non-KOS human merchant in Skyfire.  Make him always up.<P>Add an extra stage where the cleric needs to collect several (4 maybe?) uncommon/rare drops from regular, xp-giving (at 50+) mobs in various locations around the world.  One of these items would be a container.<P>Combine all items in the container, and hand this to the merchant.  He despawns, and respawns as the KOS version.  Fight occurs as previously.  As soon as (or very shortly after - less than an hour) the dragon dies or despawns, the merchant form respawns non-KOS.  If you fail this encounter you need to go camp the items again, but you keep the pearl.<P>Ragefire still drops the heart container and you still need the swirling pearl to combine it with.<P>This moves the bottleneck (i.e. limiting the rate of epic creation) to collecting the uncommon drops needed to hand in to the merchant.  However, this bottleneck becomes much less painful since you can camp these items with a regular XP group.<P>Possible places to get these items could be Skyfire, Sol B, Burning Woods, Timorous Deep, Kedge... looking for zones with some tough mobs and a fire/water theme here.<P>I think pretty much everyone agrees that the big problem with the cleric epic is that it's a poorly designed quest.  There are a lot of very easy steps (only Ixiblat and the Overking need a significant force), with one enormously contended rare spawn.  Remove that contention by making Ragefire always available, but lengthen the quest.<P>How does that sound?<BR><P>------------------<BR>Morrun Catspaw<BR>High Priest of Bristlebane<BR>Albion - Death Before Dishonour!<BR>Cazic-Thule Server</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#dedfdf">

</FONT><HR>I agree that something has to be done and soon! I've been eagerly anticipating my shot at Rage for about 6 months. We are a small guild and have just recently gotten to the point where we could handle Ixiblat and the Overking. Now I wait for Ragefire. The biggest problem is that Verant in all their wisdom decided to drop some pretty wicked loot on Ragefire and Now the "Ubers" are camping him just for the Dragon bags and the potential for a CoF. That has to be eliminated!!<BR>For my money the easiest solution is to just make Rage a triggered mob! Just have our girl Natasha or SolB rage give ye an item that triggers him in SF. That way only clerics can trigger the mob and we don't have to pay verant to sit around playing Gems for days on end<BR><P>------------------<BR>Zhuul D'vesh <BR>Templar of Rancor<BR>Justice Keepers <BR>The Tribunal</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#f7f7f7">

</FONT><HR>Problem with requiring pieces from other mobs, and zordak being an hourly spawn is that it only slows down particular clerics.  The rate at which the epics enter the world is limited by the slowest single component.<P>Assume for the moment that the mobs dropping each of rare-piece-1, rare-piece-2, and rare-piece-3 spawn times are 8h, 12h, and 24h respectively.  If the mob can spawn every 20 minutes, say, then even if the item from the mob is rare, the completion time -could- be 20m.  The maxiumum number of a particular item that could potentially enter the world is the important number to consider for limiting rate of entry into the world.<P>While Joe Questor is off getting rare-piece-1, John Questor could be getting rare-piece-2, Jane Questor could be getting rare-piece-3.  Queueing them through, 1 person is ready for zordak every 24h (the longest spawn time of the bunch).  During that 24h, 2 people could have gotten rare-piece-2, and 3 people could have gotten rare-piece-1.  There's a backlog at rare-piece-3 that grows over time, but that backlog is insignificant compared to the current zordak backlogs.<P>Unless one of the pieces enters the world at the same rate as zordak currently spawns, the rate at which epics enter the world is decreased.  Thats what VI claims not to want.  They want 1-2 epics entering the world per week, maximum.  The only way they can ensure that is making one of the spawns occur at most twice a week.  End result is that without doing substantial rewriting of the quest, there will be a single piece that ends up contested.<P>--Kanroc<BR>--High Priest, Triton<P>------------------<BR><A HREF="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=92322" TARGET=_blank>Magelo Profile</A></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#dedfdf">

</FONT><HR>I understand what you're saying, Kanroc, it's a good point.<P>I guess what we're really looking for (actually, what Verant are looking for, but they make the rules here) is a way to ensure that only 2 epics a week enter the game.  Verant themselves have said that the SF Ragefire should spawn every 3 days or so = ~2 epics per week.<P>The current mechanism to ensure that is the spawn time on a single mob.  And we know the problems that causes.  If you can't get 12-18 people there faster than everyone else, you can't have your epic.  It becomes a struggle against other players rather than a struggle against the game itself.  Am I right in thinking that that's what most people hate about this quest?<P>So... make the rarest "random drop" I suggested drop only twice per week - the important thing is to have it drop from multiple mobs in multiple zones - that way, you won't have a load of contention for one camp.  That might take some extra coding (server maintains a record of how many "rare-items" have been looted recently), but it must be possible.<P>There is still the possibility that multiple epics may be created in a couple of days, but *on average* the rate will still be around 2/week.<BR><P>------------------<BR>Morrun Catspaw<BR>High Priest of Bristlebane<BR>Albion - Death Before Dishonour!<BR>Cazic-Thule Server</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#f7f7f7">

</FONT><HR>What really upsets me about the cleric epic is that it is not fair.  Take a look and compare the rogue and the monk epic quests.  Both of these quests can be easily accomplished in a small - medium sized guild because the final "epic" fights (The General in Kithicor and Xenovorash in Lake of Ill Omen) are spawned via handing in items.  Now I know what your thinking Ragefire used to be a hand in, but it caused too much trouble, so the quest was changed.  However, the REAL problem was not that the final step of the quest was initiated with a hand in.  The problem was that the merchant Ragefire did not spawn often enough!  1-2 spawns a week is simply not enough to keep up with the number of clerics needing this step.  It is simple supply and demand, if there are not enough spawns to go around, people misbehave and KS, ninja-loot, etc.  <P>Take a close look at the spawn time on the other epic mobs.  General Vghera can be spawned by any of the dark elf NPCs in Kithicor and they have a respawn time of 8 hours.  There is a high supply and availability of spawns that can trigger the epic mob and <BR>people are well behaved when it comes to performing this stage of the epic.<P>Now consider the true power that these offensive oriented epics have.  It is typical for 90% of rogues-monks to have their epics if they are 55-60.  Now combine the total damage output from these epics and compare it to the total utility power of a similar medium sized guild with 90% of their clerics level 55-60 having their epics.  Verant needs to realize that cleric epics are not over-powering.  They should be more prevalent in Everquest because they would be a major benefit to small and medium sized guild.  More cleric epics would greatly reduce the downtime related to unfortunate situations.  High downtime leads to upset and unhappy people.  If people are happy in Everquest, they are more likely to continue playing the game and thats what Verant should be considering, since EQ is slowly reaching the decline stage.<P>Why should a cleric be expected to maintain a 5-7 day army that is large enough to kill Ragefire?  It is not fair.  <BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#dedfdf">

</FONT><HR>Epic Comparisions<BR>The rogue and monk epic's final encounter is a trigger spawn but the rate of items dropping upstream from this is in the order of 2 per week.  Ask a rogue how long it took to get the robes he needed or the Monk for the KC or Chardok pipe.<P>In instances where the rate was not controlled, VI altered the quest.  The shaman epic was changed at one point because there was no rate controlling step.  Now the tear from PoF drops at the rate of 2/week instead of from a 6min spawn lvl 4 mob (iksar child).<P>Comparing epics is not a good idea.<P><BR>Possible solutions<BR>I think your point is valid though.  The rate controlling steps should exist further upstream in the linear cleric epic quest instead of the final Ragefire encounter.  <P>Ideas:<BR>-Chardok note doesn't drop 100% of the time (Phinny style)<BR>-Plasmatic priest or Gimblox spawn or drop rate adjustment.<BR>-Lord Berg adjustment (yuck, not my favorite)<BR>-there are others<P>The final turn in of the swirling pearl can then trigger Rage dragon spawn with the heart box as loot.  Pearl is returned in the process.  The GM customer service issues would not be difficult since the pearl itself would become more difficult to obtain.  Killing the dragon for other loot such as red scales or CoF can not occur with the trigger method.<P>Since Rage is spawned more frequently, the case of the pearl turn in by one cleric and the ninja loot by another cleric would be minimized.  Ninja cleric would need to have pearl already to hit combine.  Besides, you still have your pearl if you need to trigger it again.<P>Down side to this change.  All the clerics with the pearl now would be released in a flood of epics since they are upstream already of the control point.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#f7f7f7">

</FONT><HR>Aye, Forel, that's why I would suggest adding a new step between the pearl & Ragefire.  Seems to me that's the only way that Verant will change it - changing further upstream will result in many many clerics suddenly getting their epics, as you say, which I suspect Verant don't want.<P>The important thing as I see it is not to have a rare drop from a single mob, or a common drop from a single rare spawn mob, since that will just lead to the exact same contention problems we have now.<BR><P>------------------<BR>Morrun Catspaw<BR>High Priest of Bristlebane<BR>Albion - Death Before Dishonour!<BR>Cazic-Thule Server</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#dedfdf">

</FONT><HR>I think you guys are to hung up on the whole Ragefire thing...<P>The best way I can see to accomplish the what we all want and what fits in to VI's "vision"<BR>is to move the bottle neck. So that Ragefire the Dragon  pops on a much quicker timer. More Dragons = More chance for the smaller guilds to have a turn. Have him drop the heart as normal.<P>What you can do then is make the Avatar of Water a random spawn over a triggered one. Have him pop twice a week. Sure you might have 20 clerics waiting for him to turn in his Orb of the Triumvirate but the first one there wins. <P>No uber guilds to help you there, just you  and the next cleric. A small guild will have a better chance to finished the quest, the epics will  still enter the world at the two a week rate that VI wants.<BR>Hell the clerics waiting around for  the Avatar of Water could /duel for rights or just who is quickest.  The cleric would be forced to be there in person and not have a twink or second account there<P>Why does the "bottle neck" have to depend on who has the biggest guild?<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#f7f7f7">

</FONT><HR>>> Epic Comparisions<BR>The rogue and monk epic's final encounter is a trigger spawn but the rate of items dropping upstream from this is in the order of 2 per week. Ask a rogue how long it took to get the robes he needed or the Monk for the KC or Chardok pipe. <<<P>As a rogue, I got my robes at the same time, and in the same place, as I got the piece I needed from the General.  The robes are trivial, especially since the Kedge and Ishva robes don't actually require you to go to Kedge keep or Splitpaw.  <P>Indeed, the *entire* rogue epic is easier, in  my opinion, than the cleric epic not counting Ragefire.  On rogue epic night, we'd regularly do four or five Generals.  Rogues were the only class where we'd get epics for twinks - it was that easy.  I have screenshots of as many as there seperate dead general carcasses lying on the ground at once.  <P>A "quest" in which the hardest part is just sitting on your ass and hoping that some other players don't screw you is just piss-poor design.  Verant can come up with all the excuses about limiting the numbers that enter the world, but that doesn't change the weak nature of the end-quest.  <P>The cleric epic stopped being "uber" eons ago and it is high time for Verant to make this quest something clerics look forward to rather than the suckfest that it is now.   <P>--Deimos</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#dedfdf">

</FONT><HR>Do you want to change the ragefire spawn timer? <P><BR>Do your think petitions work?  Might but by this time next year who cares. <P>You want it changed now?<P>ANSWER:<BR>Have everyone gather in SF on your servers.   Petition the GM's over and over about Play fair camp rules.   Make them roll, make then show up and waste time.   Generally use thier GM hours.   Yes this is harsh but you know what?   They will fix it, VI doesn't want thier GM's spending 3-6 hours a day in SF sorting out a mess.   <P>Have one guild camp SF, have another guild show up every 20 minutes and leave, they dont really have to be there to get ragefire, but make it look like they are, have the GM's sort it out.    This is the single fastest and guaranteed way to fix a dumb spawn timer issue.   1 epic a week, and you can progress to this point minimum 1 a day.   VI vision, in 2 months everyserver will have 50 clerics all ready for rage, with no body to blame but VI.   They take thier frustrations out on each other.   Its the Vision after all.   <IMG SRC="http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/smile.gif">  <P>I know my guild has gotten 8 clerics ready for thier epic in the last 2 months, only 1 got it.   In 2 more months we will have 14?  Get the picture?    Who wants to spend 12 weeks of guild time in SF pissing others off?   I've never seen the druid or monk epic items contested.   Not many monks waiting on thier epic end mob?<P>Once the GM's start feeling the pain from guilds showing up and envoking fair play rules every 20 minutes, it will get fixed. <P><BR><p>[This message has been edited by Kanbyen (edited 03-21-2002).]</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#f7f7f7">

</FONT><HR>My God, Kan has hit it right on the head!  I've always stated that no amount of petitioning and complaining to Verant would make them change this spawn.  I'll stick by that.  What they *will* change, and have a proven track record of doing so, is time-consuming tasks that their gms and guides must undertake.  If we make this an issue with them (and force them to witness disputes and /randoms for rights to the spawn) and continue it with other guilds, it could mean an overhaul of the spawn again!<P>Please note that this would have to be a friendly agreement among guilds as well.  No animosity should be taken at a challenge for the spawn.  Quite the contrary, if you have more than one cleric (of course you do!) in the group waiting for the spawn, wait until the gm leaves after the first dispute and then call them back to say that another cleric from your guild wants to challenge the previous winner of the /random.  I guarantee that after 1 week of this the gms and guides would be going out of their friggin' minds.<P>Is it petty?  Yes.  Is it fair?  No.  But then again, if they had truly fixed the way the end of the cleric epic was handled, we wouldn't have to do this.  Want Verant to listen?  Get their own volunteers to complain and threaten to leave.<P>BTW, I'd sign the petition if I honestly thought it would do any good in getting it changed.  I've got 1kpp saying it doesn't.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#dedfdf">

</FONT><HR>Sadly, this was the beauty of the Naggy bottleneck. Uber guilds could not go in and Gank Naggy. Individuals or small guilds could sponser/lead a Naggy raid to obtain the camp. This gave them a real shot at Rage assuming camp was honored (which I think it was for the most part).

</FONT><HR>Yes Vi needs to do something.  Lets take a fast look at other epic's.  Melle's epic's are replaced by weapons from ToV or primal weapons. Wizard Epic, with the new AA skills they do 3 times the damage with other spells, plus the cast time on the epic Ouch. Mana free LOL, FT items, Clarity (1, 2 or 3) and bard song, who needs mana free DD spell.  Nice in EXP groups but when fighting Mobs in ToV or SoL, if mob isn't dead in under 2 minutes most of the time we are dead. Mage Epic is OK.  So that leaves Chanter,Cleric and Bard, they are the most benifictal epics period.  Highend game,in EXP groups and the mid level game. This is all my opinion BTW.  SO why not give these classes a Highend Item that has a better effect.  What effect I am not sure but I am sure Vi can think of a few.  This would leave the middle of the road guilds a chance for the cleric epic with out lessening the effect and give the Power gamers a chance for a new item, which they would earn through the risk vrs reward Mobs.<P>Decon<BR>High Priest<BR>Sol Ro<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#dedfdf">

</FONT><HR>We've established a list system on Xegony, however, I agree that the current spawn rate is inconsistent with the ability of other classes to obtain their epics.  The fastest I have seen Ragefire spawn in Skyfire has been 36 hours after a patch, and the fastest I have seen it after he is killed is 142 hours (5 days and change).  When the initial post was put up on the Developers corner, Alan stated that the spawn of the killable version would be every "few" days...  Last time I checked, a "few" days was 2 to 4 days, max, not 1 week...<P>The most consistent time of the spawn of Ragefire is actually about 6 days, and some change.  approximately 150 hours of camping.. I have been in Skyfire for the better part of 6 weeks now, with minor excursions to other areas for brief experience hunts.  In that time, I have seen him spawn a total of 5 times.  Previous to that, since the patch that changed the spawn, I have seen him spawn 3 other times, and the first time, people were so busy arguing over the rights to the dragon version, that the dragon despawned on them.  3 other occasions the dragon despawned, because raids failed and were unable to regroup in a sufficient amount of time.<P>It is my belief that Verant needs to make the spawn for Ragefire similar to the Druid epic's spawn of Faydedar, triggered and capable of being triggered a minimum of once a day.  Personally, I don't see what is so imbalancing about the cleric epic, that they would bottleneck it so tightly that it is virtually impossible for a small guild to accomplish the camp...</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#dedfdf">

</FONT><HR>Well I am at the Rage in SF stage now, it is a shame that Verant messed this epic up so much !!<P>They made this change the stop all the bitching and KSing, IMHO they really made this change to make clerics sit in SF for hours on end, finally get rage to spawn, have a race to get troops there just to be KSed by another guild.....I mean honestly this is a SICK camp.  As I said I am at this stage now and I cant see myself ever getting this dawn camp, last week when i checked there there was 8 other clerics sitting in line waiting for the chance to even get the camp  <IMG SRC="http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/frown.gif"><P>I think they should make the Rage pop like the druid final battle, have the vendor standing there and have the cleric hand in the swirling pearl for Dragon ragefire to spawn, but as with Faydedar you get the Pearl back so if you get beaten you get another chance some hours later.  At least this way you can get the troops there and be ready for the final encounter.<P>just my 2 cents worth........<P>Good luck all<P>Alilinkie<BR>59 Templar <BR>Rodcet Nife</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#f7f7f7">

</FONT><HR>After camping Ragefire twice for my guild and finally getting this epic I can honestly say that I am damn proud of spending my time there and having something as wonderful as my sprinkler to show for it.  Its a matter of pride and acknowledgment that I did not give up. While I agree that this camp is horrible...and the chance for less honorable guilds (I have a list going on these) that storm in to KS you is high...the camp is appropriate.<P><BR>This epic is the most useful in the game.  Without mana..within minutes you can restore a fallen raid.  Why should it be easy?   Yes, other epics seem easy..rogue, ranger, and druid.  But none of them will get an entire guild on its feet in under 10 minutes and ready to kill again.  No other epic can do what ours does.  There is NOTHING that even compares.  So the entire epic situation should be unique and difficult.    <P>As for those smaller guilds..my friend in Sap recently got his epic.  Do not even say its unfair for those that only have a handful of players lvl 54 to 56.  It has been done.  <P>After spending 3 months, being KS'd twice and almost giving up...I now hold my Sprinkler. <P>Cartina Darkdeeds,<BR>Brothers of Darkness<BR>57th Cleric to the Rogue</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#dedfdf">

</FONT><HR>I know of 3 non guild clerics on the E Marr server that have gotten their epic. They did it by making friends. I know one of the guilds well that he used to help get the epic and there was 4 clerics that agreed to roll for the item needed. I know it is no real solution but it is one. This is a game of social science when you reach high end portion. I am glad my cleric never accepted being a guild twink. I am glad my friend who earned her epic was a non guild cleric because it shows a cleric looking for a pick up group can get her epic. <P>Yes the only way things will ever change in this game is if people talk and come up with solutions that benefit the company (sony) and the players. We all think if we suggest a change it will not happen. Apperantly that is not correct otherwise paladins/clerics would not have access to rezzses earlier nor would a level 18 druid be able to evac a party to a safe zone. Changes done in the game is wieghed by three measures; one what is good for the company, two will it unbalance the game and thirdly how will players benefit. lets face it clerics wanted a different solution to Sol B it took over 2 years and now they have it. Let us hope it does not take another 2 years to fix it to where it should have been in the first place.<P><BR>Loshanna Ghoulslayer 25 Cleric of Innoruuk<BR>Drcobane Ghoulslayer 46 Pally of brell<BR>Linanae Wintersnight 30 Shaman of tribunal<P>"I have a question for you.

</FONT><HR>problem I forsee with the idea of getting guilds together and /petitioning all the time. Is that the sparse GM population will soon start to ignore the /petitions. sure the guides MIGHT show up got get the superficial details, but I see it degrading to the point of Guide_01 pops in, gets the names of the parties. Then Guide_01 pops out 2 min later. and if the GMs do not outright ignore the petitions. All they have to do is wait 10-12 hrs before responding. Most of the petitioning parties would have logged by then. There by making the point moot. Im a cynic, but I also have seen the wonderful CS in action for last 4 years.<P>Funno Happykatz<BR>High Priest Gotk<BR><p>[This message has been edited by funno (edited 03-29-2002).]</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#f7f7f7">

</FONT><HR>Ok, my wife is camping Ragefire after we have been sitting with another couple for 120+ hours before they got their container.  I agree with the petitioner that this should be changed.  Alot of what I am hearing in this forum is what Verant wants you to believe.<P>First of all, who says this epic is unbalancing if there are too many in the game?  One person said a cleric with epic can get a raid up on their feet in no time, like this is a bad thing.  Out of all the bad things in DAoC, the only consistent good thing you hear about it is that CR is not a pain in the butt like it is in EQ.  People have said throughout the lifetime of EQ that CR is a royal pain.  Since Sony/VI is obviously stealing the good ideas from DAoC, why not this one.  It does not unbalance the game, it only allows people to do what they are paying their hard earned money for, fight, kill, loot and move on to the next challenge.  Sitting on your butt for two hours waiting for a rez only benefits one group, Sony/VI.  That butt-time keeps you two more hours away from reaching whatever goal you set for that day or week.<P>As said before the only people they are hurting are the ones that are not in uber-guilds.  Why piss of 90% of your customer base?  I know why.  Most people are envious of the uber goobers and feel that they have to do everything in their power to be just like them.  So they will spend more time and play the game longer so they can eventually reach those heights.  Sad to say though maybe one in a hundred will even be in one of the top three guilds on their server regardless of what gear they have.  They will quit out of frustration.  The only difference between them and the people that don't have uber aspirations is that the latter probably quit a long time ago when they realized they had taken their character as far as it could go without being uber.<P>An epic should be a personal journey.  There is nothing epic about getting 30 of your closest level 60 friends and obliterating a mob in less than 15 seconds after sitting on your butt for 5 days straight. <P>I also hear a lot of "well I had to suffer and so should you" type of posts.  This to me is a very pathetic attitude to take.  I'm a monk.  I started my epic at level 1.  I was in a guild that maybe had two people over 50 in it.  It took me a year to finish my epic when I was 52.  Do I get mad that the majority of monks out there are choosing to kill Brother Zephyl for their first robe instead of questing the headband/sashes and raster/targin camps.  Which is what occupied most of my time for that first year.  The answer is no and I will show up for any Brother Z killing that I'm needed at.  Even then Verant nerfed the quest so that he doesn't always drop the robe like he used to.  Can't you people see that Verant wants you to sit on your duffs at mind-numbingly boring camp?  There is nothing epic about that at all.  This is done because they can't think of anything better to do.  So once again we have to pay for the Vision not really being that Visionary.  I believe that those who say "Why should you have it easy because I didn't" are focusing your anger at the wrong people, the players.  If I'm leading a hike through a cow pasture does everyone have to step in the same manure that I did?  What purpose would that serve.  The haves should be helping the have nots so that nobody has to wear smelly boots again.<P>Yes I posted without solutions, but didn't want to take that liberty with your boards and your class unless asked.  <P>Thanks for listening,<P>Peacedog AoxomoxoA<BR>56th Monk<BR>Tunare</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr></table><table border=0 width="95%"><TR><TD valign=top align=left><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial">This topic is 2 pages long:&nbsp;<A HREF="http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/Forum3/HTML/002722-.html"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;1&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/Forum3/HTML/002722-2.html">2</A>&nbsp;<P>All times are ET (US)</FONT></td><td align=right valign=top><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><A HREF="http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum3&number=3&thisthread=002722&go=newer"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next newest topic.">next newest topic</ACRONYM></A> | <A HREF="http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum3&number=3&thisthread=002722&go=older"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next oldest topic.">next oldest topic</ACRONYM></A></font></td></tr>
