Georgia,

Yes, your absolutely right... only the smaller guilds on Fennin Ro choose to adhere to the calendar. The uber guilds have chosen to plan their actions based on their wants, needs, or desires... and that is fine if they so choose to do so. It's a game and they payed their money just like i do. My personal preference is to respect other guilds and their goals and objectives, that is not to say that the uber guilds on Fennin do not do this as well.. infact, I have many friends and former guildmates in some of these guilds and I play and raid with them often enough to get the "you get to 56 and we really want you to join us" speech. And that's great, nothing is more satisfying than earning the respect of your peers. Personally, i would never leave my guild. I have been with them for 4 years and thru 3 different games. 

My personal view on the calendar, however naive it appears to be, is to respect my fellow gamers and their attempts to organize a "fair" scheduling system. I don't believe the calendar works on Fennin Ro either, but I have chosen to follow it regardless. I would follow and support a Ragefire schedule if it ever got established and "supported" too.. but we both know how pointless and likely that is LOL.   :)

Lemme tell you, i had a doozy.<P>Saturday night we went up to Hate after another guild had attempted their raid and gotten wiped out and decided to leave. It was my first ever trip to Hate so i was excited and nervous. I was lucky enough to pick up both the EM Greaves and an EM Breastplate for our time spent up there... i was so excited I was literally shaking!<P>Sunday I got up and went off to buy my level 51 spells in FV. After that I went to Karnage Castle and had a long and interesting chat with fellow forumer Spawrhawk (omg, i think i spelled that wrong.. sorry Spawr). I traded a nice wizard some items I had been attempting to sell for a Girdle of the Diligent. Hunted for a bit in KC, then got wiped out by a train. 2 hours and at least 15 trains later I finally got out of there (after rez'ing about 15 people) and headed over to Icewell to work on my Giant faction.  The Huntsman was up and we invised, ran to his room and took him out! Got a fancy pair of Boots of the Huntsman. Went to the scribe room and killed him too, but before we could loot the body 6 mobs from the Keep down below we *popped* into the scribe room (2 Frosticubes, 2 dwarf skellies, and 2 tenticle thingy's).. got wiped out, petitioned the GM who wouldn't help with out proof. (hello, there were still 4 of those keep mobs in the dwarf palace, what more proof do you need?). Did manage to ding 51 tho  <IMG SRC="http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/smile.gif"><P>And the kicker.... was about to log off when i got a plea from a guildy who had taken 1 group up to Fear to play around with some of the respawns (it had been cleared earlier that day)... foolish me went to help out and now my body lays in Fear, unrecoverable until the next guild on the calendar goes up for their raid tonight.<P>Summary of this weekend:<P>Gained -<BR>EM Breastplate<BR>EM Greaves<BR>Boots of the Huntsman<BR>Girdle of the Diligent<BR>Level 51<P>Losses -<BR># of Deaths = 6<BR>Lost level 51 2x in Fear<P>End Result: My body is laying in Fear with all my equipment at approx loc n930 x p1330<P>Here is to hoping the guild who raids Fear tonight on Fennin Ro is not only very capable, but willing to help us get our bodies back...<P>Talk about your highs and lows...<P>/sigh<P>Panteroo Mcgillakudy<BR>lvl 51, 50, 51, 50 cleric of Tunare<BR>Fennin Ro</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#f7f7f7"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Shohanna Curesurtales</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Er...
