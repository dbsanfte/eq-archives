First trip up there I spent about 6 hours of time and ended up getting the helm.  Second trip, Night before Turkey day.  Ended up getting gloves and the boots, Spent about 10 hours that time.  Last trip, spent about 3 hours up there.  Group had probs and a lot of people decided to leave.  Anyway.  We were fighting a Cleric of Innoruk (sp) and had one mezzed and also had a loathling lich mezzed.  Killed the Cleric and he had legs.  I rolled a 14 and didn't win those.  We killed the other cleric a little bit later and he had the BP on him.  I won the roll on that.  I never win rolls so we extremely happy   <IMG SRC="http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/smile.gif">  ......  Soo, all in all in about a weeks time without a whole lot of hours spent there I have most of the pieces I want.  Still would like the legs.  <BR>Very very lucky I would guess.<P>Sooo,  on average how long does it take to get most cleric pieces from hate?  How long did it take most of you?<BR>Also, in the whole time we were there, Only one warrior piece dropped.  My friend was not too happy about that.  Do the other class pieces drop less than cleric pieces or was it just a freak run of luck.  There were also many other pieces which I didn't even roll on or were all ready duplicates to what I had.  Anyways,  thought I would share<P>Allono<BR>51st Vicar<BR>Quellious</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#f7f7f7"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Sullah</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">It took me about 5-6 trips to get everything except for the BP.  I transferred servers and lost it all but got gloves and arms on one trip recently.  Now I don't even bother worrying about it and have stopped wearing EM armor except for certain resists (all Thurg/SS/Donal's now).  <P> <BR></FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#dedfdf"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Islington</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Cleric drops in Hate seem to be pretty good.  You have to understand that I used to play a Paladin and pretty much all Fear classes get hosed on Planar Armor in some way, shape or form.  In about 8 Fear raids I had a total of 3 pieces of Valorium (Bracer, Vambraces, and Greaves)that that was VERY good.<P>With my Cleric, my luck was far better.  I had all the EM I wanted after 3 trips to Hate.  The first trip I got a Bracer and the Vambraces.  The second trip I got my BP and a second Bracer.  The third trip I got the Greaves.  I've been back in Hate quite a few times and have passed on gaunts, boots, helms, and shields numerous times as they are not upgrades for me (well the Helmet is but I won't wear the Graphic).  So all in all, 3 trips to Hate netted me 5 pieces of EM.  However the only piece that I still wear for everyday wear, is the BP as I haven't found anything better to replace it just yet.  I still use the Bracers for the CHA, the Greaves for the extra point of WIS over my Donals when Tradeskiling (EVERY point helps) and the Vambs for Magic Resist Encounters.<P>With a decent raid, you have a good chance of getting something.  There are lots of Clerics of Inny so there is the potential for a lot of dropped EM.<P>------------------<BR>Quistil Angelwatch<BR>Templar of 58 Seasons in the service to the Great Mother Tunare<P>Islington Angelwatch <BR>Cavalier of 53 Seasons in the glorious service to Erollisi Marr</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#f7f7f7"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Tundar</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">First raid: BP and arms<BR>Second: Legs<BR>Third and following: Passed on rolls, as I got what I want (I have better in the remaining places).<P>I know...I was in luck like newer before  <IMG SRC="http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/smile.gif"></FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#dedfdf"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Kolevii</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Took me 30 some odd raids to get everything >< .

On one of the clearings I was with the guild I joined later but there were no EM drops on that trip (I would have gotten then automatically if any had dropped I think as all other guild clerics have EM already or Templars armor). <BR>    Anyway I always thought I was going to get EM and progress to Donals then Templars as I had been planning/hoping to get into my current guild. I ended up only getting a Prismatic Shield as a drop from Hate. I then started getting the more common plate drops from ToV. End result? I went from having no planar armor to Kael quest armor... quite the jump.<BR>    So thats what happened to me... I had horribly bad luck on EM drops and ended up just getting Templar's armor first, though sometimes I wish I had some of the peices for resists gear now, perhaps I'll still get some.<BR>    Hope you have better luck on EM drops in the future as I had no luck at all.  <IMG SRC="http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/tongue.gif"> <P>------------------<BR><B>Saamar Aikanaro</B><BR><I>Templar of Tunare<BR>Realm of Ages<BR>Fennin Ro</I></FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#f7f7f7"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Sollwin</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">While EM is nice, it's not to hard to move into peices of Donal's and Forbidden Rights at the same levels.

Now it's the armor you can do without, maybe legs or a bp, but Let Gloves Rot?!  huh???!!!  NEVER thought I'd ever hear that!<P>Started Suudar in June of 99 - still no BP, 100+ Inny runs, Donals Arms - on Rallos this stuff just isn't too sought after, no Velious quest armor.  I just play to hang out anymore, exp and lewts are bonuses.<P>Just interesting to see the progression.  I do notice that those early raids, we accomplished more with less, gear, people, etc.  And nowadays I don't think there's the unity, and understanding that they/we had back then.

When Kunark was first released, I still didn't have a full set of eth mist, and had to go to hate at least 30 times to finally get the bp.. I remember many nites of going to hate and not one bp would drop.. seems that the drop rates are a bit higher now, as I was in Hate just this past weekend.. Now most clerics are not as hard pressed to get the eth mist, as they are setting their sights higher for the thurg, kael, or tov armor.  <P>I have a full set of eth mist, will hang onto it as long as my bank space permits, and hope maybe someday verant may make a quest that requires the turn in of some no drop armor.. that would be so cool  :  ) <P>Dusk 60th HP of Prexus. </FONT></TD></TR></TABLE>
