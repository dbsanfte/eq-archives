I had little problem dropping Epitaph on the second level boss mob of Ssra last night.<P>I am guestimating my damage from epitaph at over 7k per full bar of mana (probably 8k) and I have a Dawnfire.  No haste as yet, but I am working on that as well.  Will end up with a Silvery Belt I think. I currently have 40 charges of shaman DS (30 damage per hit) and will probably have some clarity potions shortly. Waiting for a friend to get her skill maxed.  I have no skill points as yet (working on 55 first).<P>I have no doubt that this will be slower than my normal group, but that group has about 15 people feeding into it and I only get a shot every once in awhile.  I am sick to death of Velk's and this would be a nice place to get a little exp while waiting for something more enjoyable to show up.<P>Thanks,<P>Bram</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#f7f7f7"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Panteroo</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Obviously Aldur will have some more complete answers for you, i just thought i would share my experiences.<P>You should be fine with tboots/jboots as the most likely hunting spot you will be going after the bats is at the 2 house area which is quite close to the Dawnshroud Peak zone line.<P>The bats hit me last night for a max of 153 with the average hit in the 80-110 range. They do double attack.<P>I would estimate their hitpoints in the 6-7k range based on hunting experience... sorry i can't narrow that any further.<P>I didn't find them very resistant at all... I don't have Epitath yet, but was easily able to stick Exile Undead and TotU on them when i wanted to.<P>I would not rely on melee to do any significant amount of damage however... what they lack in hp and damage output they make up for in ac.. with max 1hb and melee skills I was hitting for between 1 and 16 pts with a 12dam 23 delay Goranga Spiked Warclub. If you can proc the dawnfire consistantly then i would say go for it, otherwise be weary. Using my Warden Symbol of Tunare for the right click Grasping Root (lvl 5 root) i never got resisted.<P>I haven't attempted to solo one of these myself but i would be very cautious even with my mana pool which at 57 I estimate at about 2800 mana... but as soon as i can get the Epitath spell you can bet I am gonna give it a shot.<P>Let us know how it goes  <IMG SRC="http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/smile.gif"><P><P>------------------<BR>Panteroo Mcgillakudy<BR>Patriarch of the Patron Saints<BR>Fennin Ro</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#dedfdf"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Bram</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Thanks for the info, Panteroo.  Dawnfire isn't for the melee damage, it's for the banish undead proc <grin>.  Over 100 dex and haste=1 proc generally before I have to back out and heal.<P>Bram</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#f7f7f7"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Aldur</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Sorry about delay - been a bit busy (and giving EQ a bit of time to stabilise).<P>Note all of this is before any retuning of any mobs that may or may not have occured, I aint checked lately.<P>Firstly you probably don't need a horse, but it certainly helps.  Having a horse is not really for the speed (although it helps a little for pulling), it is for other things.<P>Things I use for killing bats as efficently as possible (I have managed to do it in 30% mana) are<P>1.  Horse<BR>2.  Level 52 Dot<BR>3.  Dawnfire<BR>4.  Velious legs.<P>The bats I found max hit around 120-130 - if someone else says they hit for 153 then I guess they can, but im sure it was around 123-130 that they max hit me.  They do hit pretty fast though, and of course double attack and bash.<P>It's a bit hard to know resist rate of spells, if you are below their level then I would guess that you may have the odd resist, but their resist rates are similar to spectres, which I remember nuking pretty good at like 7 levels below their level (only resists I ever got on spectres was when it was an enforced resist because it was too high for me to hit at all).<P>I am not entirely sure how much damage the level 52 dot does, castersrealm says 750, others say 900.  All I know is it takes about 7 dots + 2 procs from dawnfire to normally kill them.<P>However how much mana you have isn't really the question, because you will regain a reasonable amount of mana during the fight as it takes about 4 mins to kill it.<P>The order is really fairly simple.<P>Root<BR>Dot<BR>Spam velious legs to heal<BR>Spam velious legs to heal<BR>repeat root.<P>Now the reason why horse is useful is that healing yourself for 210 with the legs will still net you 21 mana a tick for sitting down.<P>Estimate how much mana you lose from swoping out your dawnfire (unless your dawnfire is your primary weapon).  For me I lose about 250 mana for losing belt + epic so after the first round I swop out.<P>Then engage said critter until your health is about 50%.  Note keep reapplying dot whilst meleeing, but don't bother with root, until you want to back off.<P>Then heal self up whilst rooting/doting.<P>Bats seem to have enough hps whereby 8 dots + a little bit will kill them.  For each proc on the dawnfire - you will save yourself 275 mana.<P>It is very easy on the whole - I have died only the once in maidens (in whole of Luclin infact) and that was when I got run over by a train whilst I was healing myself after a fight.<P>Mana pool wise - I don't exactly have that much to shout about - around 3.3k, but its a bad fight when I get to 50% mana, 60% mana left is acceptable, and any more is a good fight.<P>Be warned - you may occasionally have to heal.  Sometimes you will get one resisted root, followed by about 3.  When in this case don't let yourself drop too low before healing in the case of mana efficency, because critters like to break root just as you think you have things under control.<P>Hope this helps.</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#dedfdf"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Josiefuz</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">At 59 I had a hard time holding root in Maidens.

I did not expect to suceed (and I didn't) was just goofing off while I was waiting for my chanter friend to get CRed so I could res him..<P>okay, I'm 53rd lvl with a 220 wisdom.  I used no equipement procs during this (cept my jboots of course), just my straight up spells<P>The other problem is I don't have the 52nd lvl DoT yet.<P>I started rooting and DoTing with the other two DoTs.  I'd run  to just past max spell range and start medding.  On average my roots were holding about 45 seconds each.  I didn't time them but I'd have to recast a 2nd time just before my DoTs wore off and they are a minute and half DoTs if I remember.<P>Went a bit tricky after the second root.  The bat managed to get close enough to intterupt my attempt to re-root him at first and got me down to 60% health (I didn't have a symbol on)  but no biggie.<P>It went good for about 3 DoT cycles after and I remained at 80% mana.<P>Then I had some more trouble but got it re-rooted, cast cel heal and started medding again.  This put me at 60% mana which I stayed at for several more DoT cycles (didn't count)<P>Once the bat got down to about 30% health I started having big problems.  THe bat was resisting one out of every three roots and the roots were barely holding long enough for me to recast DoTs much less med, so a wizzie friend that was near by came in and helped me finish kill (bat was about at 20% when wizzie threw in)<P>So they aren't that hard to do.  I might have succeeded if I had the 52nd lvl DoT, not sure though, since it would have been a bigger mana drain /shrug.<P>Kaharz Stronginthearm<BR>53rd lvl Vicar of Brell<BR>Rodcet Nife<BR>Forsaken<BR></FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#dedfdf"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Josiefuz</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">I was using Immobilize.

I can't see far enough into the mist and I get jumped by them from a range beyond my sight (thank you excessive fog).

I am not sure what fogging you are talking about, as I get none of that when I play.  Upping your clipping might help with viewing them from slightly further away.<P>I head right at zone, over the hill to the little hut.  This is where I make my camp (of just me :>) on the edge where the zone wall starts to rise.<P>You then pull from further right, near the house.  Bats wander across in front of the house.   A good place to check what is about is a slight hill further to the right.  Further down there will be a few drudge (non undead last I checked) skeletons and various other things.<P></FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#dedfdf"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Bram</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Thanks Aldur.  It probably is my clipping.  I tend to turn everything off and all the way down since Verant can't seem to avoid code bloat.  Even with 512 meg of RAM things seem to slow down at the most inopportune times.  Will give it a try.  Soloed light blue spectrals in TT with Dawnfire and Epitaph.
