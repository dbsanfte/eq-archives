<TEXTAREA NAME="EditedMessage" ROWS=10 COLS=45 WRAP="VIRTUAL"> [QUOTE]There need be no conflict between honor and uberness.
When the majority of people in a group behave dishonorably, that becomes the way of it. But it's a choice not an inevitability.[/QUOTE]

 [QUOTE]In the end it is "just a game", even though it is easy to forget sometimes. [/QUOTE]

There you have it, the two ideal in a nutshell. Casual vs Uber.

Grief playing has always been justified with "it's just a game" since most people discovered it en masse in Diablo. But if it's "just a game" then why bother griefing in the first place? I remember someone with a hack who came into a public Diablo game I was in and he would res and kill me with one trick over and over until I was out of money. He then laughed at me and left the game.

I hadn't really lost anything. My character just had a few gold on him and I didn't lose anything of value, not that I couldn't hack the game myself and get it back. 

But EQ is a Persistant State World. If you see someone with, say, a mage or a necro epic you know they earned it and aren't some random hack. So EQ is more than "just a game". It's also an investment of time, the same as anything else in the real world.

But the Internet is also anonymous. It doesn't matter who you are today because you can be the devil today and an angel tomorrow. So some people see that as license to do whatever they want and damn anyone who gets in their way (for the l337 people out there "P|_4y 2 (ru5|-|").

"Just a game" applies to something temporary. Like the game "Sorry". Yeah, I bumped your guy back to start. But it doesn't mean anything. Next time it might be your guy bumping me back. It's all in fun. But in a PSW like EQ it's like telling them "My time is worth more than yours". I liken it to the person who builds a sculpture in the sand. Yes, it's temporary. But at the same time, there's a reason they're spending the time and effort to do it. Now, take some spoiled brat who sees it and takes a running leap into it, destroying it. Would his saying things like "It's just sand" "I have as much right to be here as you do" "Well, if you were smart you wouldn't have left this where I could do this" justify it? Of course not. You've taken THEIR time and THEIR effort away.

In direct application to EQ, take Ragefire. On TZ/VZ it's acceptable to execute dark_elf00 who is camping Ragefire as those are the rules. I don't know, I really haven't played there. But on the "blue" servers it's just downright cold. I've seen larger guilds do it time and time again. That's why you really can't "camp" Ragefire. Because even if you sit there the entire time there's nothing to stop uberguild00 from running you over and saying things like "We have as much right to this as you do" "You shouldn't have left this where we could run you over" and the ever popular "It's just a game". And there's nothing you can do but sit there and watch them kill him after all that time you've put in.

It's not just Ragefire. It's not just my server. I have to laugh when I see one uberguild justify itself in terms another guild they've never even heard of used just a few days ago. See if these quotes sound familiar...

"Calendars favor the small guilds over the large ones and we're not going to stand for it so we're withdrawing and going FFA"

"You guys were moving too slowly so we took it"

"We need X item more than you do"

As I said, we play in a consequenceless world. Your reputation can't follow you around unless you want it to.

So go ahead and stomp on my character. Ruin my camp. Steal my mobs. Because your time is more important than mine... or should I say "It's just a game"
