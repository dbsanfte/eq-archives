<TEXTAREA NAME="EditedMessage" ROWS=10 COLS=45 WRAP="VIRTUAL">OK, By now most people know that the Paw of Opolla has been moved to Upper Guk. Having gotten three of the four rings on the weekend, here is my initial notes. I am looking for confirmation on if Vin Molter and Gynock have changed.

To get the Paw you need 
-----------------------

The Container - give the Rat Ear Pie and Three bottles of Kalish to Vin Molter in Qeynos. Someone said he is now a higher level Necromancer, and killing him may be harder then you think  <--- Unconfirmed

The Copper, Silver, Gold and Platinum rings.

Copper Ring : Turn Bracket Mildew (Rare drop from the Fungus Mutant in Upper Guk - about 1 in 10) to Melaxis, a named Kerran near the old Princess Mitty Castle in Kerra.

Silver Ring : Turn Faerix Spores (Extremly Rare Drop from the Fungus Mutant in Upper Guk - about 1 in 30) to Melaxis, a named Kerran near the old Princess Mitty Castle in Kerra. The Silver ring is also still spawning in the Razorgill pond in Blackburrow every four hours - I would strongly advise getting this as soon as possible 

Gold Ring : Turn Degenerated Guk Weed (Very Rare drop dropped from the Fungus Mutant in Upper Guk - about 1 in 20) to Melaxis, a named Kerran near the old Princess Mitty Castle in Kerra.

Platinum Ring : Kill Gynock Molter (Rare spawn in Befallen at entrance; placeholder may spawn every 16 minutes (a rat), or may spawn every 64 minutes (a 'shouter'). As far as I know, this bit hasn't changed <--- Unconfirmed

Faction at Kerra
----------------
Most people will be Apprehensive or Indifferent to the new Kerrans. I have done the following quests to improve my faction.

Kill the 'wharf rat' that spawns in the hut near the docks and get 'A Sharp Tooth' from it. Give this to Thalith Mamluk on the Western dock for some XP, a small faction increase and a necklace of +3 Agility (Lore, Nodrop). I have done this quest about 16 times now, it doesn't seem to shift faction very much.

Or better :

Kill Sentry Creot - a 30th level Paladin who spawns outside the most North Wester hut in Toxulla forest. He uses lay hands, and has about 1300 hps. You will take a major faction hit with Erudin - I started Amiable and after 2 kills I am now dubious. He spawns every six minutes, and is often camped by mid 30's to 40th level Necromancers, due to the rapid spawn time. Turn the head into Shazad Asad in the old Clawknights room, for a major faction change (2 heads got me to Amiable from Apprehensive), and about 4 platinum, and a Sejah Ghulam Bracer (Dex +5, Sta +3, AC 5, No Drop).

Some people say kill the Erudin Emisary - I disagree. Although weaker then the Sentinel, he doesn't always drop a head, so your Erudin Faction may end up getting hurt more.

NOTE
----

It seems that Melixis has some religeon faction also : After 7 heads I am still apprehensive, and nothing I can do can shift it. (On the plus side, the best place for me to sell loot is currently Kerra Isle). I know this affects Mithanial Marr and Tunare worshippers also from a few hours of research on Friday Morning. If she refuses to give you the quest, and insults you, you will not get the ring when you hand the plant in (I tested with a spare mildew)

So, this is how I handed my three plants in :

Stand behind her. Start the trade. Put the first item in the first window. Then get invisibility cast on you, and hit complete. This may not work 100% of the time, but it worked the three times I did it. Both Enchanter Invisibility and Druid Camo worked. This will probably be fixed in the next patch, so better get in quick.

The Fungus Mutant
-----------------
The Fungus mutant spawns in a corner in the fungus farm in Upper Guk. He has about 650 hp's at most (Retribution, Force and Holy Might kills him 80% of the time, same for a single Starfire), and casts a Whirl till you Hurl spell and a poison dot. I'd think he is about mid to high 20th. Resist magic and resist poison work nicely for me at 44th level to avoid embarassing yourself in front of the assembled crowd. He drops plants about 1 in 10 kills, although I have seen 3 from 5 kills drop something.

The Camp : Let's just say the first thing shouted  when zoning into upper is no longer 'Ancient Camped'. It's now 'Fungus Camped ?'. I've done this for about 15 hours, and apart from being lied to on the first day ('No, he hasn't dropped anything for the last 30 hours') It's been a pretty nice camp, normally with about 3 to 6 people hanging around

Normally you will be there with high level shamans or druids. 90% of the people doing this will be after the Guk Weed, as this is the gold ring. The best way we came up with is to figure out who needs what, and run three lists (e.g. Player 1 gets the First Guk, Player 2 gets the second guk and the First Mildew, Player 3 gets the second mildew and the first spore). 

This way, if someone turns up and demands a share of the spawn, point out that the players have already come to an agreement and they are welcome to join the rotation. Most Guides and GMs will be happy knowing that the players have come to an agreement

Other spawns in the Area : Lots of fungus creatures, roaming and stationary. Expect to kill about 3 roamers to get into the spawn, if uncamped. Each has about 500 hp, and drop rusty, rare bronze, and about a plat. There is one wandering Shin that patrols through the farm, but is easy to avoid. You will totally trash your live side Frogluk faction doing this farm. 

Well, that's my information from the last four days. Anyone have more info on changes in Befallen ?
