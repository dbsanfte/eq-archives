<blockquote>
For months now Clerics have been beseeching Verant to modify the Ragefire camp.  Verant has been silent on the issue until today, when <a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000155.html">Absor responded</a>.  So, as with many intolerable situations in EQ we had the choice of dealing with reality as it exists in the game (don't analyze that too closely =P), or getting it modified.  Verant declines to modify, so we must then deal (refusing to do the quest or camp is one way of dealing).<br><br>A large part of the problem exists due to the relative ease of the quest.  Because of this many players are at the final stage in a state of frustration due to their inability to complete the quest quickly, if at all.  In hindsight Verant admits that the quest is too easy.  However, they refuse to ease the bottleneck so they are content with the status quo.  Accept it.<br><br>On to the camp.  I've read many threads concerning conflict over the Ragefire camp.  While I sympathize with those who feel that their "camp rights" were denied, I also feel that it is time to re-define what it means to <i>camp</i> Ragefire.  <br><br>First, let me list a few things that are not camping Ragefire:<br><ul><li>Having a Monk or Necro'd feigned in the lair.  Also, having any other character sitting around watching for the spawn.</li><br><li>Having a solo Cleric (yourself) sitting in the lair waiting for the spawn.</li><br><li>Keeping the Fire Giants cleared with a small group.</li><br><li>Any amount of players waiting on the spawn that are not sufficient of themselves to kill the spawned Ragefire.</li></ul><br>All the above examples are merely an early warning system to allow you to get a head start on gathering the force necessary to kill Ragefire.<br><br>What is camping Ragefire:<br><ol><li>A force sufficient to kill Ragefire immediately when he spawns.</li><br><li>See 1. above.</li></ol><br>When Ragefire spawns, turn in your Shimmering Pearl and kill him.  Don't ask for time to buff, for forces to get there, etc.  If you can't kill him when he spawns you are not ready.  Period.  Call in the next group.  Ok, I'd probably allow five minutes or so (heck of a time to hit the head), but otherwise you must be ready.  If you aren't ready you aren't camping, your scouting.<br><br>Is the above harsh?  /em shrugs  It's reality.  Verant gave us an easy quest.  They made the reward for that quest incredibly desirable.  That guarantees fierce competition for the reward.  With the post from Verant I don't see how one can reasonably treat this camp any other way.  The first group at the camp with the force necessary to kill Ragefire gets the spawn (don't dither turning in that pearl).  And you know what?  It's fair.<br><br>Rayne<br><br><a href="http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/Forum1/HTML/006222.html">Go here to vent</a></blockquote></p>

<blockquote>
From the <b><u>Cleric Petition</u></b>:<br><blockquote><b><u>Item #1:  Stun While Invulnerable</u></b><br> <br>This has been the source of much consternation and discussion in the cleric community.  If, while invulnerable, we are allegedly immune to being hurt or damaged in any way, how is it possible that we can be stunned?  Our line of invulnerability spells are highly useful, but invariably when the situation calls for their use, the creature(s) in question are more than capable of stunning us repeatedly and having us remain under their feet when our divine protection wears off.  We believe if the gods have gifted us with the ability to render ourselves invulnerable, then no type of harm should be able to penetrate that barrier, which includes protection against stunning blows.</blockquote><br><br>While we all waited for the response to the petition, this interview was done:<br><blockquote>GZ's indirect response in the interview:<br><b>7. You must have heard this one by now, but why are we able to be stunned while divine aura is up and will this ever be changed? </b><br><br>Divine Aura protects from physical damage.  It does not protect from stun.  This goes along with our philosophy of having no &#8220;get-out-of-jail-free&#8221; cards in EQ.  Divine Aura is a nice way to protect yourself if things get bad &#8211; and as an added bonus, monsters tend to leave you alone once they figure out that they can&#8217;t hit you.  There is, however, a built in weakness &#8211; you can be stunned.</blockquote><br><br>Now, almost <b>two years</b> after the original formal request the gods have decided that if you can't be hurt you can't be stunned.  <br><br>/boggle<br><br>So Verant, are you going to take two more years to fix you're screwed up Ragefire mess?  Think you could do it a bit quicker, er, while I'm still actually playing this game?<br><br>By the way, wonder what other item I'm referring to off the petition?<br><br><blockquote><b><u>Item #8:  Meditation</b></u><br><br>This request is made to benefit all casting classes.  We feel that meditation should be programmed as any other skill, such as melee or fishing or begging, with the ability to &#8220;hot key&#8221; and go directly to our spell book with meditation active, rather than having to go through a two-step process.<br></blockquote><br><br>Flabbergasted in Louisiana,<br>Rayne<br> <br></blockquote></p>
<a name="newsitem989323652,77254,"></a> <p><font color="#FF0000"><strong>Patch message 5/8/01</strong></font><small><br>   Posted by <a href="mailto:DalurS@hotmail.com">Dalur</a> at 7:07 AM</small><br>
<blockquote>
                                                   PATCH MESSAGE, MAY 8, 2001<br>                        PvP Changes<br><br>                        We have made the first of our upcoming changes to the PvP aspects of EverQuest:<br><br>                             Consider: /Consider will only have three results when used to consider a Player Character. The character will<br>                             show as 'green' if he is below the range that allows you to attack him. The character will show as 'white/black' if<br>                             he is within your ability to attack. And the character will show as 'red' if he is above your range. This will only<br>                             take effect on PvP servers. <br>                             Sanctuary Levels: Characters below level six will not be able to engage in PvP combat, unless they take part in<br>                             a Guild War, duel or use the Arena. This will, obviously, only take place on PvP servers. <br>                             De-Leveling: Characters that lose levels will only retain the combat skills of a character two levels higher. This<br>                             means that if a character of level 10 somehow loses 5 levels, that character will only have skills that would be<br>                             available to a 7th level character. This change will apply to all servers (it has to, code-wise). So the two level<br>                             buffer is there to make certain that people that lose levels during normal gameplay will be minimally affected<br>                             (hopefully not affected at all), while those that purposefully lose levels with the intent of causing other players<br>                             grief will find themselves at no great advantage. <br><br>                        These are the first of the things that we plan to. We are taking a careful, step-by-step approach to changes whenever<br>                        we can, and we have other changes planned for upcoming patches.<br><br>                        Quest Changes<br><br>                             We've made a change to the Velious armor quests. The folks in Kael and in Skyshrine that give out rewards for<br>                             these quests are now being stricter about who they will reward quest items to. You will have to be considered<br>                             an 'ally' (see Features section below) by these NPCs in order to be able to complete these quests. If you are<br>                             doing quests for the Coldain, however, they are somewhat less picky, and they only require that they consider<br>                             you 'kindly' to reward you for your labors. <br>                             The Black Silk Cape will now drop more frequently [Necromancer Epic]. <br><br>                        Bug Fixes<br><br>                             Attacking with a two-handed piercing weapon will now 'gray-out' the attack button as it should. <br>                             Text that once read: "You cannot remove this affect." now reads "You cannot remove this effect."   Changed<br>                             by popular demand. <br>                             Food Emotes: Forcing your character to eat by right clicking food will now properly display the appropriate<br>                             emote to those in the area. <br>                             Fixed a problem that often made it difficult to loot really large NPCs. <br><br>                        Item Changes<br><br>                             The Shield of Tsunami can now be equipped in the secondary slot. <br>                             Quivers now reduce the delay time on bows, the better the quiver the faster your bow. We will not be listing<br>                             the speed increase a quiver will give your bow, but you can tell the good quivers by their ability to reduce the<br>                             weight of your arrows (better-made or magical quivers have this property). <br>                             The Ivory Handled Falchion should now 'proc' without telling you that it is out of charges. You may need to<br>                             contact your GM to replace the item with a new version if it is still acting strangely. <br>                             The Opal Bracelet is now a wrist item, not a finger item. Be aware, once you remove it from your finger, it will<br>                             not go back onto that finger, it will only fit on your wrists, as it should. <br>                             The Large Dragonbone Shard will no longer appear to be a Staff of the Gathering. <br>                             The Ring of Levitation will now poof when all the charges are used up, and should display the correct number<br>                             of charges. <br>                             The Priceless Velium Reinforced Bow now has a range of 200 instead of a range of 0. <br>                             The Refined Mithril Blade should now be equipable in both primary and secondary slots. <br>                             The Unicorn Horn should now have a graphic. <br>                             The Hammer of Flattening has been changed from tiny to large. This might cause you a little reorganization in<br>                             your inventory. <br>                             Runebranded Stone Buckler is now labeled as a shield and can be used to bash. <br>                             The Ring of Pureblood is now a finger item, not a waist item. <br><br>                        Spell Changes and Additions<br><br>                             Translocation spells: Five new Wizard 'push' spells have been added (Translocate: Fay, Tox, North, Combine<br>                             and Group). Translocate spells send the group to the location, while the Wizard remains behind. Translocate<br>                             Group sends everyone in the group (except the Wizard) to their own bind points. Translocate Group can be<br>                             found on NPCs in Velious (and they won't give them up easily). The others are available on an exclusive<br>                             vendor. All Translocate spells (even the original Translocate) have confirmation boxes that must be accepted<br>                             before the target will be sent. And Wizards can no longer Translocate themselves. <br>                             Some lower 39th and 44th level Velious spells have had their drop rates increased. <br>                             GM Resurrection has had it's name changed from ResurrectionGM to Customer Service Resurrection so that<br>                             players will be able to better tell when they are getting a resurrection from the GM staff. GM resurrection will no<br>                             longer have Res effects, and will leave the newly Ressed with full Hit Points and Mana. <br>                             Divine Aura and spells of that type (Divine Aura - cleric, Divine Barrier - cleric, Kazumi's Note of Preservation -<br>                             bard, Harmshield - necromancer, Quivering Veil of Xarn - necromancer) will now prevent the caster from being<br>                             stunned when hit for their duration. <br>                             The Eye of Zomm series of spells will no longer work in Kedge Keep. This change was made to prevent an<br>                             exploit. <br><br>                        Feature Additions and Changes<br><br>                             Looting text has been changed. You will now see a -- before and after any loot messages. This has been<br>                             changed primarily to help prevent any fake looting messages from being thought of as real. <br>                             When you loot an item, you will receive a text message telling you what you have just looted. <br>                             Expanded Friends List: The Friends List will now hold 30 character names. And each character has its own<br>                             friends list. You can find and edit this list with a text editor, if you need to, outside  the game. You can locate<br>                             the text files in your EverQuest directory. The files will look like this: _<#>.ini. The default Friends List for<br>                             existing and new characters will be your old Friends List. <br>                             The destroy or drop item confirmation box will now close if you accidentally pick up another item while they are<br>                             open. This should prevent accidentally deleting or dropping the wrong item. <br>                             When selling to a merchant, you can no longer sell items that are inside a container by having the container<br>                             selected and clicking the sell button. The merchant will tell you that you need to empty the container before the<br>                             merchant will buy it. This should prevent folks from accidentally selling items that they did not know were in<br>                             those containers. <br>                             You can now move items around inside containers that are in the bank. <br>                             There is a new /consider message: "regards you as an ally". This is the highest level of friendliness that an<br>                             NPC will register using the /consider command. The faction required to reach this rating is significantly higher<br>                             than 'warmly'. <br><br>                        - The EverQuest Team<br><br>Information found at <a href="http://eq.castersrealm.com">EQ Casters Realm</a><br></blockquote></p>
