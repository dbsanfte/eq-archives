I'm sure we've all encountered some pretty weird ones before.<P>Story 1<P>Once, I was grouped up in CoM, and had a necro in the group.  The necro got aggroed, and I cast a heal on him.  Nothing happened, because he had harm shielded himself right before I cast.<P>A few seconds later he died.<P>Turns out, he had been feeding his health to the tank (don't ask me why) and when he harmshielded, he couldn't lifetap anything or be healed.<P>Story 2<P>Was grouped up in bar/chef in OS.  Had a rocking group going, we were killing everything.<P>We had a krup that managed to get a gate off.<P>Suddenly, I see on my screen "YOU HAVE BEEN SUMMONED".  And I'm sitting in some little room somewhere where I didn't recognize anything.  This frog is kicking me in my buttocks.<P>So our mage says "hold on, memming CoH".  Suddenly I was summoned back to my group.  Then another party member got summoned to the frog, and the mage summoned them back.  And then another member... etc<P>We went back and forth like this until we all died.  But it was great fun playing tug-o-war with the summons. :P</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#f7f7f7"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Darianne</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><BR>I'm part of the group... so me...<P>Doing a CR in Velks... we need to get past these two gargs and two spiders.

Once we all pop up at the druid circle, our poor druid doesn't zone in. Turns out his gate was unstable and he got munched by hordes of clockworks. He was useless for ages after due to fits of laughter.<P>That is the only time I've seen someone left behind an evac in 2 years of playing - I thought it was only a myth until then.  <IMG SRC="http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/smile.gif"><BR><P>------------------<BR>Zakalwe Soulwarden<BR>Plum Templar of Rivervale<BR>Xev</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#dedfdf"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Sylvus</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Heh, the tug-o-war was funny. Mine isn't quite that elaborate, but none the less amusing.<P>We were in Karnor's at T2, and someone trained us. Well, being all good friends in RL we usually are ready for these kind of things as we grouo together quite often.<P>The chanter we had does a great job at mezzing everything, about 7 mobs to be precise. So we get somewhat relaxed. Me, the cleric, has 80 mana so we figure we are good. Had some nice tanks in the group to taunt and do the damage, not to mention a 55 monk that is very experieced in all of Karnor's. <P>We have it under control until the chanter starts getting hit. The cleric i am, predict when mez starts to break and i cast a celes heal on the chanter to keep him alive long enough to mez again, if needed i cast a quick remedy on him if he is being beaten on too hard to help with the celes healing.<P>At this point, our chanter is at 3 1/2 bubs of life with a celes heal on him. He begins to regen when we discover he is nowhere to be found.    <IMG SRC="http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/frown.gif"><P>A few seconds go by, and the chanter comes running back up to the group from down below. "I was knocked off" he says. No biggie, these things happen. <P>We kill 3 more mobs, one breaks and the chanter is getting beat on again. Once again i cast celes heal, and nothing happens. I cast remedy and nothing happens, his life does not move. <P>This boggles me as i do not know why i can cast on him and him not get life back. <P>We all have to zone as the rest of the mobs break Dazzle and commence to tear into us, me being the target seeing how is the chanter is not around.<P>We all jump off the tower and swim for our lives, and we make it to the zone with out any deaths.<P>I ask the chanter what happened? He replies "I was knocked off 2 more times and i had to run back to T2" <P>Well no wonder we had 7 or so mobs on us. He brought some friends everytime he came, not to mention when i tried to heal him, he was in the water, which not only wasted my mana, but it didn't heal him even though it was casted on him.    <IMG SRC="http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/frown.gif"><P>It was funny when i thought about it. Seeing a chanter fall off of a ledge, run back up to crowd control, fall off again, then repeat several times.<P>Reminded me of something off of Monty Python :P<P>Sorry if this was too long, I hope there is some humor in this for someone besides me.<P>[This message has been edited by Sylvus (edited 03-16-2001).]<p>[This message has been edited by Sylvus (edited 03-16-2001).]</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#f7f7f7"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Themis</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial"> <BLOCKQUOTE><font size="1" face="Verdana, Arial">quote:</font><HR>Darianne has been slain by Darianne.<BR><HR></BLOCKQUOTE><P>ROFL...

We were doing ok on the xp and avoiding the trains pretty well until one found us. Our tank calls for evac and just as the LOADING, PLEASE WAIT shows up it occurs to me that for the first time in a long time, the evac I'm about to land from was from a druid and not my usual wizzie companion. <P>My problem? I'm KOS with druids. (Call it a weakness but I just love hearing those halflings scream...something Atrila has teased me about in the past. Blame my DE connections. *grin*) <P>Well, sure enough, as I appear in East Karanas I'm instantly attacked (figures this was one time those druids weren't camped). Needless to say, I died almost before I could see what was happening. So...I reappear at my bind spot by Paw, run to EK to get my body and then gate back to fight some more. <P>Everyone is of course having a ball with this at my expense in guildchat. Not often a guildmember gets to kill their guild leader. 8) <P>I tell the group that next time an evac is called I'm going to hit Divine Aura (since you can't evac with that spell on) and run for the zone instead. I figure its about the same odds and if I die, at least I'm not 3 zones away. <P>Well, sure enough about an hour later we again have to evac.

Had killed pretty much all the non-social stuff around and the only thing left was spiders.<P>I found one that was away from all the other spiders and start killing him.  About that time, another spider came wondering by and joined in on the fight.  They promptly vanquished my pet and came after me, so I started running.<P>Unfortunantly, I got turned around and couldn't remember which way I needed to go to get back to the gaurds.  So I started making these huge sweeping circles trying to get my bearings.<P>Finally, I found the trail and started running up to the guards.  When I got to him, I spun around thinking that the spiders were going to get what was coming to them.<P>When I saw the resulting train from having made these circles around the newbie grounds I quickly realized I was going to die before the guard killed them all.  There must have been 15 little spiders running toward me.<P>So I took off and ran towards the zone into the city to get the 2 other gaurds to help out in the killing.  I ran past them and spun around, seeing the delightful message that these spiders were all being slain.<P>Satisfied that they were all dead, I ran back out into the opening to be greeted by...<BR>You have been slain by Cargo Clockwork<P>DOH!  He might have been mechanical, but he's still in cahoots with the little organic spiders!</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#f7f7f7"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Dikmer</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">I have 2 REALLY memerable life and death stories.<P>It was in Najena. I was a tad low for the zone, but was doing ok with a group zone fighting. Anyways, someone trains some tenticle terrors to the zone. I always run and jump as I run to get the little edge in front. As I got to the zone, I jump, and got nailed by the train. I actually saw myself do the "dwarf roll" from above as I went unconsious, and saw "LOADING, PLEASE WAIT". I thought I was dead, but I zoned out and was bleeding to death. Someone used a bandage on me to bring me back to life.<P>Another one that I LOVE was when I was in the Ghost room of Unrest. One of the group members was new ans wanted to look into the Pit. He fell off and aggroed everything. TRAIN TO ZONE! I was running my ass off as the group was getting ground down. I reached the top of the stairs and stopped to DA. DA on, but I get stunned. The group passed me and I was "IT". I made it to the front door and a TT did that Tenticle Throwback spell that shot me over my group, across the courtyard and slammed me into the wall over the tunnel out. That probably saved my life  <IMG SRC="http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/smile.gif"> I bounced off the wall and kept running.<P>Made it to the zone with like 20kp left. I was the butt of many "flying dwarf" jokes for awhile after that.</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#dedfdf"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Apallohadas Fayweaver</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">One word.<P>Manastone.</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#f7f7f7"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Kanr</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">I think my funniest one was in hate.<P>After awhile on the loveable "Purple Inkie Quest" I had the honor of being PT cleric (we should start a humorus hate stories thread someday).<P>We lost our monk to RL stuff late on the raid, and was using a Warrior as the puller. I'd go a little ways out in D to "greet" him with a heal as he came in, and let the chanters do their work.<P>So he comes in REALLY banged up, I toss a heal on him and suddenly am summoned about 100 yards from camp. As the gholem was beating the snot out of me one of the Ashenbone Drakes decided he didn't like me much and did that knockback thing.  The Gholem, angry at the loss of his prey didn't like that a single bit, so he summoned me back. I popped a DA and did a lame attempt to bring this junk to camp.<P>So Basically what the rest of the raid saw was me disappear and then come flying back to camp backwards, get my bearings, disappear again, come limping back towards camp and die.<P>That was one of the few deaths I just had to laugh over.  The rest of the night the PT made Yo-Yo cracks at me.<P>----------------------------------------<BR>Kanr Do'Van, Cleric of Innoruuk, 55th Season<BR>Kaashar Do'Van Tier'Dal Necromancer, 55th Season<BR>Khavar Do'Van, Tier'Dal Warrior, 48th Season<BR>Kilonar Do'Van, Tier'Dal Shadow Knight, 41st season<BR>E'CI Server<BR></FONT></TD></TR></TABLE>
