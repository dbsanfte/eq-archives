<TEXTAREA NAME="ReplyMessage" ROWS=10 COLS=45 WRAP="VIRTUAL">[QUOTE]Originally posted by Zzule:
[B]When I was around 20th, I was grouped in Najena with some friends.  We had been there all night and I needed to bank badly.  So I gated to town and promptly fell asleep on my keyboard.  I woke up a couple hours later with computer keys plastered to my face and still grouped!  They sure had a laugh when they realized what had happened.  They had been talking to me and each other the whole time apparently and thought I was mad at them for some reason they could not fathom. 

More recently, my husband bought me flowers and since we were eq'ing, I wanted them next to the computer so I could see them.  So the group pulls, and my sweet little kitty decided to have a taste of the 'salad bar' on my desk.  Just as we pulled, she knocked the vase over onto my keyboard and mouse, which stopped working entirely.  So there I am frantically shouting at my husband to tell the group I cant heal them and he is laughing at me trying to dry out my keyboard and at the way the cat charged out of the room with wet feet. 

I had to do the whole keyboard switcharound since the bath drowned it.  I dont think anyone died but they all laughed. ;P

Wether the cat walked across your keyboard and hit gate by accident which resulted in a wipeout or you spilled coke all over your keyboard and you couldn't type anymore. Kinda the stuff you never wanted to tell anyone about <IMG SRC="http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/smile.gif"><P>I can't really think of any right now, but i'm sure I had a few. Some of the ones I can remember were when I fell asleep while on a raid in Kith to kill that general guy. I was only 30 or so at the time but I was helping the shaman to get mana back faster and helping in downtime to heal up and it was fun. I was kinda tired when I got there but nothing worse than usual. Then I looked up at the screen and everything was black and I realized I had fallen asleep and died and no one was around anymore. heheh everyone thought I was mad at them for letting me die and I wasn't talking to them anymore:P At least they got a good laugh out of it when they found out what actually happened <IMG SRC="http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/smile.gif"> </FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#f7f7f7"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Skwar</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">I think my worst incident ever was when my mouse locked up.  My cursor froze, but I could still use my keyboard.  Unfortunately, I depend on my mouse a little more than I should and so I notified my group that I would be logging to reboot to correct the problem.  My group was in the Dreadlands at one of the ruins, so they all elected not to pull and wait on me.  I was gone no more than 2 minutes (from camping/rebooting/relogging), but when I returned my entire group laid there dead.  They had been trained by a neighboring group and fought to the death (every one of them).  I rezzed them all and we returned to the evening's work of constant pulls and good experience.  Shortly into it, my damn mouse locked up on me again.  I (once again) notified everyone that I was going to log, plug in a new mouse and be right back.  Everyone approved so I logged, swapped out the mouse and returned to the game to find THE EXACT same thing.  I felt so bad.  I never asked everyone what happened the second time -- I just rezzed them all and the group broke up.   <IMG SRC="http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/frown.gif"><P>------------------<BR><A HREF="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=57051" TARGET=_blank>Skwar Rewt</A><BR>Proud Cleric & Officer of Clan Chaos<BR>42nd Half-Pint Medic of Xev</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#dedfdf"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Dikmer</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Worst one for me was when i killed my monitor.<P>I was home alone, wife and kids were out.

My friend was a wizard who was a yellow from 29 and really wanted to get his new spells. I agreed to help him, if he would in turn go with me to Tox and from there, we coudl go to Kerra and get oen of the cleric quest pieces.  <P>Well, we got that done in relatively short order.  Then, we ported to Tox and started running up the coast to where you turn off across teh water to go to Kerra.  My friend said to me "phone, I am auto following you", cool, no problem, I am heading up the coast.  I get up from teh comp and run into the kitchen to grab a drink.  I run back adn OH NO!  I am in teh water.  No biggie, I am just a few steps in, I turn around and run out.  My friend doesn't come out.  I run around a bit trying to get him to auto follow me out.  It doesn't work.  I see his hp bar go down to zero.  I swim around and find his body.  <P>A few more minutes pass and my friend says to me "um....., I am dead?"  I felt awful, and nothing was said about it for months.  We are quite good friends now though, and at some point I told him to auto follow me and I got both gnomish barrels of good natured abuse.

We had traveled from the DL's, through Calibis to the FoB, once we were at the entrance to Kaesora I went for a quick afk;  when I got back I was standing at the druid portal in the DL's.  My ferret decided a quick gate was apparently in order... no one died, but dam it was another half-hour to get back.<P>Ferrets are easy to move and very easily distracted once moved... so he's usually no issue as long as I'm at the keyboard.
