I have little hope that I can change anything. I do hope, however, that if enough people post rational suggestions to the EQ developer's corner about the problems with the current Ragefire spawn, maybe Verant will make changes.<P>For any who care, here is my full, very long, post to Verant:<P><BR>I am going to try to rehash a very old problem, one you've about which you have no doubt received innumerable posts, requests, flames, and rants.<P>And I'm going to try to be reasonable, and offer realistic suggestions to start you toward a possible solution, should you agree with me that there is a problem here.<P>Let me first start by saying there are too many cleric epics. I see level 51 clerics running around epic in hand. They are a dime a dozen. Quite often the people carrying epics are insensitive, rude, or otherwise undesirable in groups. Many of these people don't have epics because they are well-loved and supported by other players, but simply because they allied themselves with a powerful guild.<P>But the purpose of my post is to point out the pain and heartbreak surrounding the cleric epic, particularily Ragefire.<P>Currently, the rarity of the Ragefire spawn is the biggest bottleneck in keeping the cleric epic rare. But even so, there are tons of clerics running around with epics.<P>The real problem with Ragefire is that it doesn't restrict the epic to the most deserving cleric. It doesn't limit the epic's availability to the best cleric, the most powerful cleric, the most devoted cleric, the cleric with the most respect or most friends.<P>It simply restricts the epic to the clerics in the biggest most powerful guilds.<P>There are two guilds on my server that have 95% of the cleric epics. They have an agreement between these two guilds to rotate Ragefire, and no other guild or cleric gets a shot. One guild "stole" a Ragefire spawn, and have been rather reviled by the big two for doing this.<P>These two guilds steal clerics from smaller guilds by promising epics if these clerics abandon their guilds and join the big two. This cripples some smaller guilds who can no longer raid the planes, or kill Trak, because they don't have enough clerics in their guild.<P>The worse part is the infighting, the disrespect, the guild vs. guild, player vs. player, cleric vs. cleric struggles and hurt feelings that comes with the competition for Ragefire.<P>Here is a quote from a post on EQClerics.com that illustrates my point:<P>-------------------- Begin Quote<BR>This past Sunday, I wandered into solb just after lunch EST time. There were only 9 ppl in the zone at that time, none of which were of level to be keeping watch for rage or do FG's. So I sent a call out to the guild and within a matter of minutes we had forces there to begin on FG's. Some Relentless folks had entered the zone as we were making our way back and we assisted them in killing the FG's in order to get some of their camped out folks out of FG spawn areas. Once the FG's were down, Relentless thanked us nicely for the help and went on their way. Myself and others decided to hang out in the lair a bit and do some bugs, stone spider and the sort. And yes, The Relentless folks were told we were hoping to stay there for Ragefire spawn.<P>As the day went on, a large number of our people had camped out for various reasons. Some leaving numbers to be reached on moments notice. I sat in that lair for the entire day. We killed FG's again and I sat in there some more. Around a quarter to one AM EST time, some of the same Relentless folks that had been with us earlier in the day, came in, killed Tranix and proceeded onto the lair and found me still there. As they were leaving, BOOM! Rage spawned. Now, as many of Albion had already camped out, I had been talking during the day and evening to other friends in other guilds and asked for backup reinforcements in the case that Rage spawned. So I had ppl ready to come to my aid on a moment's notice. When rage spawned, the call went out and they all headed to solb as quickly as possible. <P>Unfortunately, Relentless ended up with I'd say around four groups of people in the solb area almost instantly. The thing that bothered me so much with this is that I knew I had the forces coming. I knew I would be able to finally complete this quest that I have been ready to finish for months. I had not been able to do so because of the constant camps held by larger guilds that have people online at any given time of the day. <P>But here's the kicker, then my question. I spoke with four people out of Relentless pleading with them to give my folks a chance to get to the lair. Told them several times I had forces in route. Folks that gave up other camps they were in to come and assist me. The responses I got from Relentless people I spoke with was a direct no. Followed by speak with so and so. I did. Again a flat "sorry, no deal. We're killing him."<P>Sunday night was the worst night I have had in ages. I felt I was completely disrespected and I vowed never to assist TR in anything again. Monday, apologies were made to folks other than myself, and offers of assistance came about to others than to myself. <BR>-------------------- End Quote<P>Note how this player was crushed, discouraged. She felt it "was the worst night I have had in ages."<P>I know of one player who got so disgusted after having this happen to him that he quit the game and doesn't play EQ anymore. I know of another player, a very compassionate, kind girl who loved helping others, who quit her cleric and created a rogue after a crushing experience like this.<P>Is this what Everquest is about? Pain and heartbreak?<P>Sure, it wasn't Everquest that did this, it was some rude and disrespectful players that did it.<P>But this Ragefire bottleneck breeds this problem, rewards the rude and disrespectful players, and the other players who are considerate and generous and kind have absolutely no recourse. None.<P>Now this is NOT a rant, not a rambling about some problem. I would like to offer some solutions.<P>First, what is the cleric epic about? Or any epic for that matter?<P>It seems to me that possession of an epic should indicate that you are at the pinnacle of your class. A rogue with an epic should be the sneakiest, the best at picking locks and pockets. A warrior with an epic should be the best dang melee tank in the business. A necromancer with an epic should be raising the dead, slaughtering innocents, etc...<P>A cleric with an epic should be the best healer, the best glue that keeps a group together, keeps them alive. Ideally, this means he has tons of respect and has armies of (converted?) allies to flock to help him complete his quest (crusade?) for his epic.<P>In fact, other than the nice wisdom and mana bonuses on the watersprinkler, the cleric epic isn't about making us more powerful or elite. Rogues and Warriors can do more damage, Mmages can summon a killer pet, etc. All clerics can do is restore life, and this is almost always used on other players. Our epic is not about making us more powerful, it's about helping others. Shouldn't it therefore be a reward for clerics who have built a reputation for helping others?<P>In fact, almost every cleric I've met in this game is an extremely sensitive, kind, compassionate individual. I believe that anyone who would voluntarily play a class that is nearly helpless on its own, entirely dependent on others, and whose only power comes from healing and protecting other people must be this kind of person or will lose interest long before reaching epic levels. Consequently, these kind and sensitive people are the ones who suffer the most from rudeness and insensitivity from other players. It is the nature of kind and sensitive people to be wounded most deeply by such inconsiderate behavior.<P>Killing Ixiblat Fer and killing Overking Bethelzed are examples of the respect needed. These mobs don't need a guild and are frequently killed by getting a few pickup groups together consisting of friend from all walks of life, regardless of guild. <P>Killing Ragefire doesn't require this kind of respect, it simply requires a cleric to be part of the one or two largest guilds on his server.<P>The Ragefire bottleneck defeats the purpose of an epic. When Uberguilds have alts and twinks with epics, just so they can camp out a cleric with an epic incase a raid goes bad, yet other clerics, even level 60 High Priests who are well-respected and very important to their own guilds cannot get an epic, then something needs to be done.<P>What can be done?<P>First, I would make Ragefire easier to spawn, much like some other epic quests can now trigger the ultra rare mobs (i.e. Faydedar).<P>Second, I would make Ragefire much harder to kill. Currently, he's no harder than Nagafen, but he doesn't kick out everyone over 52nd level. In my opinion, he's easier than Ixiblat Fer and Overking Bethelzed. Anyone who can handle those two can surely handle Ragefire in his current incarnation.<P>These two simple changes will enable any cleric who is high enough level, who can complete the earlier (and currently harder) steps, and who has enough respect, is well enough liked to amass sufficient support, to achieve an epic. <P>After all, isn't the epic supposed to indicate that the person carrying it is the paragon of their class? Not just some alternate of another player in an uberguild who wants a backup rezzer camped in Hate in case of a wipeout?<P>If nothing else, making a change like this would reduce the pain and heartbreak that some players are suffering, pain and heartbreak that has no business existing in a game, in an entertainment venue.<P>I don't expect you to fix the attitude of these rude jerks who inconsiderately trample over anyone who gets in their way. MMO games will always face that problem. <P>But you can easily make a couple changes so that those jerks lose this avenue they so frequently use to cause this pain to your kind, sensitive cleric players.<P>I'm not saying make Ragefire easier. I think you should make him harder. Ragefire should be the toughest encounter, the final epic battle, the ultimate challenge. The difficulty of beating him should restrict the availability of epics even more than the rarity of finding him currently does.<P>Just please, please make Ragefire available to any cleric with enough respect, enough goodwill on a server to garner sufficient support to attempt this encounter.<P>After all, aren't clerics about respect and goodwill? About helping other people? Shouldn't these qualities define our ability to get the only epic in the game that is all about helping other players?<P>Enough said.
