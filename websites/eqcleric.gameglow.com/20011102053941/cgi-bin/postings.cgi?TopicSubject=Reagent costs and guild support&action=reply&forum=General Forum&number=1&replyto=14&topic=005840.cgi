[B]being a guild leader, and a cleric, I make damn sure my costs are covered. even so sometimes I cut it slim (usually have a bank acct of under 1k).. because a) I hate selling junk so I give it away to someone who needs and b) I just don't do alot that makes for high cash loot often. I spend all my time grouping with friends, so its never an issue that I loot to cover my costs. I was in a semi-pickup group the other night in hs, at least the leader was someone I didn't know. and I said point blank, you will give me gems and stuff to pay for peridot. no problem by them. it is my honest opinion that peridot symbols are very worth the money, even on non raid scale events. it just depends *who* I'm going to cast on. priorities: puller, main tank, chanter, cleric, other tanks. if we're fairly safe, I may just do a symbol on the puller/tank. if its a nasty raid, I'll keep most of us symboled always. ya, it eats the bank acct, but those extra cpl hundred hp can save lives, and thus time and hassle.

The exception to this is hate when all cash loot goes to the wizzards for port gems. They even give one rare gem to all monks and wizzards as a thank you for coming.  <P>Due to this I can end up using about 5k plat a month on peridots. However a few good friends I have in the guild do realize this, and make sure that at least once a week we go to Sebilis.  One night camping the jail there can end up with 1k plat in gems easily.  So I can for the most part keep up with the demand on peridots. <P>I have tried to get some kind of reimbursement on raids before, but this never works.
