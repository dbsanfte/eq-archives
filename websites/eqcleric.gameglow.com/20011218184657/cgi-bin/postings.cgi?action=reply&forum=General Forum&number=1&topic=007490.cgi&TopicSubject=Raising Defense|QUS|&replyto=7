[B]I doubt you'll ever need to train defense.  Clerics get beat on enough in their normal grouping to max defense.  

Maxing your 1hb is easy too.  Every time you sit and get bonked by a mob, bonk him back a few times before sitting again.  You are up anyway, might as well slap him silly.

I've grouped with her since 10 or possibly earlier and she has RARELY been on the front line.  Now at almost 31,  if something does agro, the group tank or chanter has it off double quick (most of the time).  While all of this may sound good it has left her a bit hollow when it comes to offense and particularly defense.  Offense and 1hb must be at an all time low.  Defense can't be far behind.<P>I am worried about defense, should I be?<P>If defense is a necessity, does anyone have any suggestions for raising it?  I don't mage/necro friends to dual pets, etc.  I know the mob has to be blue for defense to go up but most blue mobs in the high 20s pack a wallop. I had thought about goign to Qeynos hills SoWd and just pull the weaker Miller and drag her to bb zone just to let her beat one me for a while but I solo'd them on my druid in the high 20s and they do hit hard.<P>Any advice is much appreciated!</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#f7f7f7"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Marvill</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Keep doing what you're doing by fighting in groups, but when you find one where things are rather calm, let the group know you want to practice your defense.  Overnuke/stun to draw aggro, and let yourself get beat on.  Keep DA and DB handy, just in case.  Let your tanks know to stop taunting unless your health falls below whatever level.<P>Make sure you get it maxed ASAP.  Low blues when you're 31 may seem to pack a wallop, but they're nothing compared to light blues once you're 50+.</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#dedfdf"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Zereh</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Each skill up in Defense means and extra point or two in natural AC. <P>You can't raise defense unless you get hit; you can't raise your weapon skill or offense unless you are swinging a weapon on the front line.  <IMG SRC="http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/biggrin.gif"> <P>I'd find a nice steady stream of blues somewhere and get a group going that has  another cleric friend or healer of some type in it. Pretend your a tank and whack those beasties upside the head for a couple of nights.<P>  <IMG SRC="http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/wink.gif"><BR>Zereh<BR>Terris~Thule<p>[This message has been edited by Zereh (edited 11-27-2001).]</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#f7f7f7"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Tundar</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Neat trick:<BR>Root the mob and get close, and I mean REAL close. Like stand on it.<BR>A rooted mob will always hit the one closest to it. If you need a heal, back off and heal yourself. If root breaks, your tanks should have enough aggro to make it stay on them.<BR>If you got a rogue in your group, he will love this as that makes him able to do backstabs without fearing the mob will turn and hit him. Be sure to engage from the opposite direction of the rogue.<P>Kind regards<BR>Tundar, L57 and still 1 point short of 200<BR>/sigh</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#dedfdf"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Lynet</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">I found that I had to make time every level to go tank some low blues.  The perfect training mob is a fast swinging, low damage, undead.  If you can't find that, then find any low blue.  As a rule of thumb old-world critters hit less hard than do Kunark or Velious critters.<P>The trick for me has been to <BR>1, change into ac gear<BR>2, bum an agility buff from a shaman or ranger<BR>3, root the critter before backing of to heal myself.<BR>4, have gate loaded and ready to use.<P>do NOT expect to gain experience or group with others while doing this, you really do better if you say "I will train defense for 40 minutes" and then go about your regular hunting.<P>Lynet Beaumains, The Damosel Savage</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#f7f7f7"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Fattima</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Well as it has already been said, the only way to get those skills up is to practice them by engaging in melee.  I do this by either looking someone to duo with.  In either case, I try to tank about 1 of every 3 mobs.<P>As far as buffs or stats go, the most important stat for improving melee skills is actually Dex.  I am not sure exactly where the breakpoints are, but even if you have to get some gear to get it up, every point of Dex helps.</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#dedfdf"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Twinskey Bab0linskey</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Defense is important for those time's when the crap has hit the fan in xp groups or when doing somthing solo (and maybe some might consider foolish).  A high AC means your hit less and for less damage.  Imho, it's the heavy hits that interupt spells when a mob is beating on you.<P>I think your best bet is one of two places.  If he's still light blue, then the hermit in SK would be best.  He's a monk who hit's alot, but not hard.  You should be able to get him outta his house by saying "I've come to kill you" as I recall... or just cast an AoE next to his chimmey.<P>The other option is the Brute's that are outside of Dalnir in War Woods.  For big sized mobs they sure don't hit hard... and the zone is right there to Dalnir.  After they green out, you can use the Brute's (or yeti's) in the DL's.  </FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#f7f7f7"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Josiefuz</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">I doubt you'll ever need to train defense.

Pull those wandering cactus plants to someplace relatively safe (i used to prefer the SW corner or the "tunnel" to FM). Then you take turns... one time the druid roots the mob, damage shields you, and heals you as needed. When the druid is OOM or the mob is dead its your turn. The druid damage shields themselves and this time you root and heal until the mob is dead or your OOM... rinse and repeat. You sure aren't gonna level at a quick pace doing this, but you will get your 1hb, offense, and defense skills up AND get some experience while doing so.<P>If your in your 40's grab your druid friend and go hit the Bloodgill goblins in Lake of Ill Omen. Do the same thing described above taking turns every other mob.. just be sure to pull the gobbies to land. <P>If you want to go hardcore then do this for as long as possible or for hours at a time. If you find that boring then do it for an hour or two a few days a week.<P>The other option for the less "sane" is find a place where you can get 4-6 mobs on you at once and still be near the zone line... Round them up, DA or DB, and let them pound on you while they do no damage.. you can still get defense increases while DA'd. I have found that CoM is just about perfect for this since you can easily round up the front 5 mob spawns and run to the zone to do your DA thing.. inbetween DA/DB recycle times you can solo pull/root one and just heal yourself.<P>those are a couple easy options for ya<P><P>------------------<BR>Panteroo Mcgillakudy<BR>Patriarch of the Patron Saints<BR>Fennin Ro</FONT></TD></TR></TABLE>
