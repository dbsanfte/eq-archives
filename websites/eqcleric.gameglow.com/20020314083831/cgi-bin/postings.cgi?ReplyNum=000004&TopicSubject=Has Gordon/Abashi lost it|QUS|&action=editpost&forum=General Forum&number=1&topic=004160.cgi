<TEXTAREA NAME="EditedMessage" ROWS=10 COLS=45 WRAP="VIRTUAL">I can totally believe that crap about the Rangers, Boanerges.

For awhile, I read those boards thinking that Abashi was some sort of a middleman. We would ask him questions, he would go back to Verant, then he would reply. He would forward our concerns to the company. He was the bridge of communication.

Lately, I realized that this is a load of Rhino dung.

He is actually a human shield, placed out there, defect our questions & concerns back to us. All he does is put spin on it. 

[i]"This is the way it was intended to be"[/i] He in NO way actually knows that this was how it was intended. What probably happened was some planner just forgot to put it in. He assumes that this is class balancing. [i]Shamans are better in this aspect. See, it all makes sence. Clerics were designed to be the masters of curing poison & Shamans the masters of curing disease.[/i]

The thing is, he actually believes his own crap.

But, it really isn't all his fault is it? I mean, here is a copy of the daily memo that Abashi is distributed with:

[i]Gordon-

Today, people will be directing questions to you about concerns and problems they have with the game. We can't possibly make everyone 100% happy, so the people that complain must be the people that are going to be unhappy no matter what. Thus, there is nothing that says that the status quo isn't perfect.

Therefore, when people come to you, hoping to make their lives "easier" & address what they consider legitimate bugs & problems, tell them that this is the way things were intended to be & that they should try another class or learn to have fun the way we intended it.

We understand that you get a lot of negative posts about different aspects of the game. But remember, only a very insignificant few who are unhappy post negativly here. A large majority of people are actually happy with the game & actually playing it & have no time to post because of all their fun. Remember, no post = 100% content with the game. Thus, all negative posters are inherently wrong & generally unhappy people without any true concerns.

Have a good day, and let us know if any real concerns come up. HAHA. Just kidding.

Sincerely,
VI staff[/i]

Ho hum. Sorry for the rant.
