I dont play test, I cannot verify that).<P>Of course we can buy potions for all that stuff... early in life (non-twinked) its hard... but definatly, if I can afford to buy a few stacks of Peridots, I can afford some invis potions and others.<P>But it is still a cross to bear for clerics... we dont have much more than root and gate to help with travel.  Potions run out, its not a massive sink of money, but it is yet another cost to incurr.<P>Some clerics charge regularly for resses, or get donations, but thats mainly a level 49 thing... sure I made some money with my level 39 res cause people were stuck... but a few generous people have rocked 49 already.<P>We were talking about spell drops, so I'll concentrate mainly on the 3 wis casters, and 4 int casters... only the cleric has to worry about travel, and any annoyances that go along with it.<P>So we also really need to bring up the med-heal routine?

I played one, it can be a pain (especially for mages having to get all that crap, and necros who have way too many research only spells)... but at the same time, an INT casters has a WAY easier time reaching 200 int than we do 200 wis... and for them AC is not so much of a concern.<P>I'm envious of other classes travel ability more than anything else... but I like what I'm doing now, I have no desire to be one of them.<BR></FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#dedfdf"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Rayne</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">And let's not forget the real big one, the Res line of spells.<P>Once you hit 49 death just isn't a big deal, especially compared to what everyone else has to deal with (ie. find some Cleric even WILLING to come to some zone for 1-200pp).<P>I'll admit I wish I could cast the Levitate and Invis spells, after all, every other caster has them.

Yes, there are potions available, its just a pain keeping them all, and its possible you may run out in a given night.<P>The only levitate item in the game is all but impossible to get.  There are now two EB items that I know about off the top of my head... one being the fishbone earring... an easy (but always camped) camp.. or buy from 2-5k depending on your seller.  The shield from the turtle being the other.  No invis items (that clerics can use, woot warriors) exist that I know about.<P>On mana regen:<P>Wizards get thier harvest spell.  Wizards (and I think Necros, but I'm really not sure) get that "shieldskin" upgrade post 50 which add 1 mana/tick.  Harvest is the real nice one... but hey, 1mana/tick is better than 0 extra per tick.<P>Mages get Mod Rods.  Definatly not something you just summon when you need mana, cause they cost a lot... but its possible to have on on you for later, and have them on friends.  More useful to give back other peoples mana in raid times (ie: Mage, summon rods and drop them)<P>Enchanters get thier clarity lines, they also have thier insight/brilliance lines, and the new +mana lines (Gift).<P>Necros are kings and queens of getting mana.<P>Druids get some post 50 spell... mask of the hunter or something?  Like the wizard shield spell, it adds 1mana/tick regen.  Now druids get a spell at 60, which is less hp than what our buffs do... but offers "Breeze" level mana regen that aparently stacks with other forms of mana regen.  Who'd want the cleric hp/ac line again?<P>Shamans have thier very nice Cannie line, I play a shaman and the line is amazing.<P>---------<P>Am I a bit jealous of this stuff?  Of course... I'd love to have some mana regen... either as a constant effect (clarity like) or a direct surge (harvest, cannie).   I know clerics have advantages now..... having reach post 49, death is trivial unless I expertly lose my body somewhere.</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#f7f7f7"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Alle</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">I'm really not sure what the point of Dikmer's post was.  All casting classes and several of the hybrids get invis, see invis, levitate and EB.  Clerics don't.  Sow is a non issue to me since sow potios are readily available.  Verant seems to justify denying clerics these simple convienence utility spells simply because clerics have the ability to rez (shared by paladins and necros).  At one time clerics also had a significantly better ability to heal than did druids and shaman but Verant has all but removed our advantage in this area.<P>So.. clerics live lies as a second rate caster - we suck at melee yet don't get simple utlity spells that would make playing EQ a little more enjoyable.  I fail to see where giving clerics these 4 simple spells would totally unbalance EQ.</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#dedfdf"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Rizena Halcyon</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><BR>Just a few notes:<P>   Staff of the Waterwalker has the effect of EB.  A guildie let me borrow that to do the underwater part of the camp for my epic.  EB Potions are too expensive for that camp.  I was there at least 6 hours.<P>   Jboots aren't the be all end all for SoWs.  They're a very low level SoW and recently I've noticed that I can't outrun everything.  There's those nasty sarnaks next to Chardok that SoW themselves and each other.  They can and do outrun jboots.  The last few times I've run through FV, I've had trouble outrunning the froggies.  They all aren't shaman, but I'm guessing they don't have a hard time getting a SoW.  Nothing beats the ole stun and root trick.<P>Invis isn't too bad.  I've always carried potions, until I won a Larrians(sp) mask in Sebilis which has 10 charges of superior camo.  Not that I had to win that, the AC is awful and everyone in the group let me have it cause clerics don't have invis.<P>Yep, clerics are the only casters that don't have mana regen, but I don't see us getting it any time either.  If anything it's the cleric's mana that directly effects the efficency of the group.  The more mana we have, the more pulls and exp the group can get.

Turns 225 health into 150 mana and costs 200 mana to summon.  Plus they are lore so you can't make a bag full for later.</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#dedfdf"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Tarf</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Well.....<P>the quote are out of context.  That was a hostile nasty thread.  Comparisons were made, things were said.....<P>Anyway, there are lots of alternatives for high level folks.  And low level twinks I guess.  All those potions cost cash.  And I can afford them at level 49.  I couldn't at 30.<P>There are also some other things one can do for EB.  Tinkered stuff.  Rebreathers I think are quite expensive.  Aqua lungs are affordable for what they do.  Unless I have it backwards.  Of course, again, affordable is a matter of level really.  Back in the day, 1pp was a lot of money.<P>I can not really comment.  After all, I am a really pampered cleric.  Not only can I buy nearly all my spells from a vendor, but I have a really good friend who is a druid.  Accordingly, all I have to do is ask nicely most of the time and I can get all those nifty spells cast on me whenever I want.<P>And I disagree about the 39 res.  It rocks for the level.  I made a ton of cash off it.  I got a bunch of thank yous from 50+ folks and I got thousands of pp in cash and items from the 30 to 49 crowd.  I guess the over 50's were taking such a big hit on exp that they didn't feel very grateful.  There are certain dungeons that are not very populated.  Kaesora and Nurga and Droga all come to mind.  Walk in, get ready to adventure and get a tell which says can you come down to xxx to res our party/cleric/rogue?  Sure, just let me cast invis on my self to get past the spiders (drink a potion), be right there.  Incredible gratitude.  Not so much for the exp back, but that they got their gear back and were back in their camp spot instead of lost and scared adn confused.  Same deal in Crystal Caverns.  If you hunt the giant fort in FM, you are not going to run into those folks.  If you go to the bottom of dungeons you are.  And you are going to have a blast doing it.  And I do not mean LGuk either.  Everybody goes there.<P>I guess I think things are fine.  And I am glad that other classes got our spells.  Necros and Pallys can res?  Good, let them, I want to play.  Shammy's and Druids can heal?  Good, I wear plate, can stun and root, and chanters know I take care of them.<P>EQ is not a game for soloers.  At least not the way I play it.  I like grouping with tanks, druids, wizards, shammys, SK's, rogues, monks, etc, etc, etc.  I like that other people cast spells on me.  I like that I can heal, buff, res and CC for the group.<P>I like playing a cleric.<P>Tarf<BR>Battle Cleric</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#f7f7f7"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Salina</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">I have to toss in a few things here.<P>For 56 levels now, I've relied on a.) my wits b.) my friends.<P>I corner the market in sheer amounts of invis potions.   <IMG SRC="http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/wink.gif">  I have jboots, so that helps a great deal.<P>I generally only get ports to places because I need to get somewhere in a hurry.<P>I don't charge for rez - I don't have 8 tink's bags in my inventory.<P>It would be great if we got invis and mana regen and whatever else.<P>We don't - we most likely never will.

If that friend needs a rez sometime, you can bet your eboots I'll be there.<P>Buy potions - yes, it sucks.  No, the other two primary priest classes don't have to.  But paladins, warriors, SKs, rogues, etc. have to buy them.  Deal with it.  Get some charisma gear so you're not losing everything for the purchase.<P>I generally keep around 6 invis potions on me, plus an EB potion.  I keep a 10 dose sow potion in the bank for naked CR.<P>Instead of feeling put-upon, ask that shaman you just rezzed for a 10-dose sow potion, or for a future discount.<P>Ask the druid you just rezzed if they can port you somewhere later.  Same for the wizard.<P>Believe me, my husband is an enchanter.  If he could have my AC he'd sell his liver.  But he's a caster - they don't get AC.
