[B]Not really sure about this.  One way to deal with the Dot is to have everyone put 1 junk buff on top slot, followed by a insta cast buff (like jboots, shrunken goblin skull earring, etc.).  Put 1-2 int casters in each of the tanks groups.  Before you pull you would have everyone get their 2 top buff dispelled by nullify/anull.  Than everyone would click their insta cast item.  That would make it so everyone has 1 instacast buff at top and one Emply slot.  When you fight, people would call out for dispells, and the designated dispellers (the int casters most likely) would dispell the people in the groups.  The DOT would take the 2nd slot on your buff columns, and when you get dispelled you would lose the DOT and the insta cast item.  Than the person just clicks their insta cast item.  This would allow people to be fully buffed and keep their buffs while allowing a slot for themselves to get dispelled.  Still would be a long fight, and making the int casters dispellers would make the fight totally dependent on melee dmg+pets but all velious fights are like that basically.  The problem is that Rumbleroot spams the DOT, so you probably need 2 dispellers per group to ensure that you take minimal dmg.

I havent really dont POG since a long time ago, just this is how I would try to tackle the DOT problem.  Take note that we only have evil races in our guild, so bards really wouldnt be an option.

All this is easy.  The real killer is his dot.<P>Basically he seems to cast a very large area of affect dot that is practically impossible to resist (300 resistance yields 50% resist rate) and due to the fact that it casts it constantly (zero cast time) like every 6 seconds, you have everyone on the field with a 150 hps a tic dot on them.<P>The problem ian't that it kills particularly quickly, its just that the critter has 100-150k hps and doesn't go down quickly.  Whilst not powerful the dot alone will kill everyone under 3k of hps in 2 minutes without healing.  With healing I can keep my party alive for perhaps 3 more minutes (using heroic bond), but the fight tends to last 6+ minutes.<P>Last fight we gave a serious effort, we brought in alot of people (40) to try it and got it down to 'rum' and have of b, before we all kicked it, but we are not fighting smarter, just bringing in more firepower.  I have no doubt if we bring in 50 or 60 people then he will go down, but it aint a great solution (given we can do the other trees with no problems with 3-4 groups (treah really is hardly worth buffing for - waste of space tree).<P>So other than getting to 60 and getting out the group CH (which would double or even tripple my healing output in this fight), I can't see a way of fighting it smarter.<P>We toyed with the idea of 59 bards song to dispell it, but that got nerfed before we had enough 59 bards to try it out.  Thought that group dispells by bard in groups with no buffs might help, have not really had enough bards (some dead from kiting rumble around til its got zero mana) to test this out.<P>Is there a way of fighting it smarter rather than just doing the age old zergling rush?<P>Any ideas?</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#f7f7f7"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Calac Oakshield</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Nah don't need to zerg him.

Being there is no space for a DOT I would presume it doesn't stick similiar to a cleric trying to cast Celestial Healing or Elixir on a player with 14 buffs.  Is this worth a try?<P>Another option it to get a few melee's with a weapon that has cancel magic on it as a proc and let them cancel the DOT with that as it proc's there are several of these types of weapons around.  I am not sure if there is an AOE version of the dispel procing weapons but that would be very handy here if it could be used to debuff everyone.<P>How could you do this cause I know your saying you cant cast spells on ppl outside the group blah blah simple get the melee's to Duel each other and not actually fight that way they can cast spells they normally couldn't on each other nice simple way around it.<P>Nazrin</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#f7f7f7"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Zakalwe</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">If a mob tries to cast on you and you already have 15 buffs, it just automatically overwrites your top buff, so that's no good, sorry.  <IMG SRC="http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/smile.gif"><BR><P>------------------<BR>Zakalwe Soulwarden<BR>Plum Templar of Rivervale<BR>Grey Council, Xev</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#dedfdf"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Norin Grimsbane</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Tanks weilding Glowing Black Swords is an interesting idea, but you could not debuff (malo, tash, slow, etc) if you did so.<P>the Swords would at least keep the DoT off the Tanks if it proc'd enough.<P>Interesting thought, but that would require a *lot* of Swords ;b<P>------------------<BR><B>Norin Grimsbane</B><BR>lv 59 Dwarf Templar<BR><I>The Tribunal</I></FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#f7f7f7"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Remfin</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Just have to kill him before you die to dot, and dispel like crazy</FONT></TD></TR></TABLE>
