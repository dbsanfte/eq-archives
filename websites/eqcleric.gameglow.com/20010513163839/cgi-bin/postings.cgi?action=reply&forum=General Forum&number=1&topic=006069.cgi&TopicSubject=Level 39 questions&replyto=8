[B]Use CH as much as possible in situations that are safe untill you get the hang of it.  It doesn't have to be mana efficient when you are figurign it out.  Practice is important.

Most of the time you don't have to charge for resses.  People will shout the zone "Paying xxx for a exp res".  Make sure they know it is 50% exp recovery.  I tell people to give me what they think the res was worth.  As this is often an indicator of how much inconvenience I went through as well as what they went through.  If you do this, then at times you will be disappointed and will not even get a thank you.  At other times, you will be pleasantly surprised.

Tell your guildies that you are busy.  They can wait a couple hours till you are done, they can get someone else to res them.  They should understand.  If they don't, then treat them as you would any other rude person.

PS I don't know why, but I used my 39 res all the time.  Perhaps I hunted in different places.  50+ folks are delighted to get a 50% res when they have no hope of getting a 90% res.[/B][/QUOTE]

When do you CH over SH?  Right now, SH seems to do the trick for all the tanks, as it heals about 2.5 bubs on 40ish tanks.  Something about waiting until the last bubble to heal those tanks scares me.  Esp with ~20% fizzles at 39.  So to rephrase, who should get CH and when should I start casting?  And remember I am talking about 39ish MOBs.<P>Resuscitation.  I speculate that I will be very popular at 39.  Should I charge for rez (i.e. stranger asks you to travel for a rez)?  If so, is there a fair price?  And how do you tell your guildmates that you are busy?  I can see that this spell can be a double-edged sword.

Use symbol and daring to max his hp's. Any L39+ tank worth his salt should have min. 2k hp when buffed.<P>So try learning how to use CH. Depending on the situation, I start when they have around 2 bubs of health left.<P>A good advice would be to make and use a macro with something like:<P>/sit off<BR>/cast 2 (or whatever spell gem your CH is)<BR>/g Complete Heal on %T<P>If you fizzle, just press the macro again. Your party will understand the 2nd message is because of a fizzle.<P>Regarding rez:<BR>I normally never charge unless I have to travel alot by foot (unless I am very bored and just hanging around chatting with friends and buffing lowbies).</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#dedfdf"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Catroina</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">The macro I use for Complete Heal is:<P>/sit off<BR>/cast 4 <BR>/g Complete Heal incoming on  %T ,in 10 seconds.<BR>/pause 5<BR>/cast 4<P>The reason for the last pause and recast is in case of fizzles I will automatically recast the spell. If the spell went off succesfully when the game parses the second cast command it will say something to the effect of "You can't use this command now" but it doesn't interefer with the casting that is going on. I have all of my heals and stuns macro this way so so I minimize the amount of time I waste from fizzling. I can't take credit for this idea though I as I learned it  from lurking on these boards.<P> <P>------------------<BR>Cleric of the 44 Season.<BR>Disicple of the Teachings of Rodicet Nife.<BR>Emarr.</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#f7f7f7"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Euboa</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">And BTW, don't worry about Rez requests...

Even at 39, I found it to be useful, and saved me time overall when used appropriately.<P>If you don't feel safe casting at one bubble, try casting a bit sooner.  Better safe than sorry when you are first learning it.  Then, as you start getting a feel for the timing of complete heal, start waiting a bit longer, until you find the maximum point you can wait safely.  As you use it, you'll start to get a feel for when it is useful, when it isn't, and when you need to start casting it.<P>If you don't start using it now and learning it, you'll never become confident enough with the spell.<BR><P>------------------<BR>Thalanar Solal<BR>Cleric of Tunare<BR>Brell Serilis Server<BR>Leader of Shadow<BR>http://www.silver-shadows.com/</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#f7f7f7"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">KamuelaTZ</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">My numbers aren't exact but this is how the math goes:<P>Sup Heal: 500Hps 250mana<BR>Com Heal: MaxHps 400mana<P>So basically if you need to heal more then 900hps it is more effecient to Complete Heal at 39 rather than cast multiple Sup heals.

When I made 39, there were I think 4 clerics higher level than me non-anon online most of the time, so people were happy to get a level 39 res.  Even today, I speculate that you WILL be popular when you hit 39 - of course, nothing like you'll be when you hit 49  <IMG SRC="http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/smile.gif">.<P>As for the cost, I usually don't charge for reses unless: 1. They are anonymous when they ask, and 2. I have to travel.  If a druid or wizard ask me nicely, and they are not anon, and offer to come get me and port me - as long as I'm not grouped or going somewhere, I'll res them for free.  Thats the only exception I'll make to travel.  Also, 3. They are kewl d00d when they ask.  i.e. "Hey, can i get a rez plz i was quading dorfs and got an add  <IMG SRC="http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/frown.gif">" as opposed to "Hail Aladain, had an unfortunate bout of luck and died  <IMG SRC="http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/frown.gif">  If you have the time, can you res me?".  Ya get the picture <IMG SRC="http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/smile.gif"><P>Usually, I wouldn't pay/donate more than 50pp for a level 39 res, and 100pp for a 49/56 res.

You won't be bothered much in a zone where there are a lot of level 49 and above characters- like most of Velious. However, spend any time in an empty zone with a 20 to 30's level dungeon near, like say Dagnor's Cauldron or the Feerott, and you will end up hoisting the /anon or /roleplay flag of surrender up pretty quickly.<P>I get compensated for about 1 in 10 times I do a resuscitate.
