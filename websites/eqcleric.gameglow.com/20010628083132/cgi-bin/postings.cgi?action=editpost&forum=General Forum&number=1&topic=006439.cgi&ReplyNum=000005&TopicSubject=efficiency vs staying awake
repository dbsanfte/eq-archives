<TEXTAREA NAME="EditedMessage" ROWS=10 COLS=45 WRAP="VIRTUAL">I rarely do pick-up groups anymore, but when I do I have noticed that it'll sometimes take me a while to get used to the mix of the group.

For example, take these two groups, both fighting at the necrosis-guardian camp in Sebilis:

Group A: Paladin, Ranger, Rogue, Shaman, Enchanter, Me -- all mid-50s.  The Paladin was the main tank, and her gear wasn't overly spectacular, but she did an awesome job of holding the taunt.  With Shaman slow, the group's mana was good enough to pull stuff as soon as it popped for near-constant action.  And although it was really controlled, it was still enough action to be fun.  The enchanter helped a lot by going LD several times *grin*.

Group B: Warrior, Ranger, Rogue, Shadowknight, Enchanter, Me -- again all mid-50s.  At first I thought it would be cake with all those meleers.  But no, although the rogue did a good job of managing her aggro, the damage ended up being spread out fairly evenly across the other three.  At first I was able to keep up with buffs and healing (only barely), but then I took my fate into my hands and told them that my mana and I would love them forever if they could keep the taunt on the warrior.  The SK said ok, he'd stop taunting, and he did.  It was a beautiful thing.  But the ranger, poor guy, had uber-taunting weapons, including a snare whip, so while I'm sure he couldn't help it (at one point he was asked about it, and they were the only weapons he had), it sure frustrated the heck out of me, and we were lots less efficient, especially with no shaman.  I am totally spoiled by the ranger I regularly group with, who really knows how to manage his aggro while still doing his job, and who is blessed with good equipment.

What's my point?  It doesn't sound like you were really hurting for mana except in a couple of situations when anyone would probably have been (enchanter and shaman also oom).  Once the monk joined, it's possible that the fact that he couldn't ditch aggro had more to do with what the warrior was doing (or not doing) than with what the monk was doing.  At any rate, all you can really do is ask them to help you out.  They may or may not be able to really do anything about it, so you manage.

So sure, you adjust based on what your goal is.  As someone else said, efficiency in this particular case was what made it fun for most of the group, so you made the change.  But there are factors that you can't really control, especially in pick-up groups.  It's one of the risks you take  =).
