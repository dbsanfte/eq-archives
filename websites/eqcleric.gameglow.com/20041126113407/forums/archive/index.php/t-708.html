<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Rorgg</div><div class="date">07-25-2000, 02:28 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">[Note: I play a 51 shaman as well as my 25 cleric and I've noticed some people mucking up buff processes because they didn't really understand what we were doing.  This is intended as a primer, not the optimal buff plan for any one raid.  Any additional insight from the cleric crowd would be helpful.]<br />
<br />
So, you're going to go kill a dragon.  Good luck!  I assume we're speaking of Nagafen or Vox here, since no other dragon is the one you want to cut your teeth on.  Even then, dragons are nasty beasts.  They're level 55 and an extremely tough level 55 -- 32000 hit points and the dual area effect breath/roar.<br />
<br />
To understand why the dragon buffs are done as they are, it's probably best to understand why dragon raids fail.  Most failed dragon raids are caused by the tank corps dying too early.  The tanks need to stand there and take the heat (or cold as the case may be) to allow the casters to mana dump.  In addition, on a Vox raid, tank bashes are needed to stop her from getting off a complete heal.  If the tanks are all feared or dead, the casters are cut to shreds by claw damage in very short order and the raid is a failure.  Even if the casters die early, if the tanks are alive, the casters (if bound nearby) can re-rush the dragon naked and blast away to finish the job.  Without the tanks, though, this is not viable.<br />
<br />
So, the primary objective of the buff process is to keep the tanks in the middle of the fight.  Tanks are removed from the fight usually in one of two ways: they are feared by Dragon Roar and run off, or they die to the massive AE damage fire or cold.  This leads to THE most important point of dragon buffing: * The entire purpose of the dragon buffing process is to buff Magic Resistance and Cold/Fire Resistance.*  Unfortunately, it's not as easy as casting two or three buffs due to the dragon breath's AE dispell effect.  The dispell means that to ensure MR and CR/FR stay active for the entire fight, these be &quot;buffered&quot; by as many other buffs as possible to ensure they stay.  Even in a fast kill, the dragon will probably devour 8 to 10 buffs, so keeping as many in front of MR and CR/FR as possible is desirable.<br />
<br />
Note: The process and buff orders I will describe here is not meant to be the best possible buff order.  It is however, a fairly simple process that can serve as a basis for a mixed group who do not work together regularly, as it only involves 4 buffers, in discrete sequence.<br />
<br />
Generally, buffing will be done after all reachable mobs short of the dragon itself have been reached.  There will be one to three &quot;buff teams.&quot;  All people MUST be completely debuffed before starting the buff process.  The buff team will buff a player, then that player will camp out to a chat room so as to not let their buffs time out.  Pet classes may be done last and left in the game to be given time to re-meditate from summoning.  A buff team generally will consist of, at minimum a Shaman, Enchanter, Cleric, and Druid.  A second shaman can take the place of the druid if necessary, especially if a mage is available.  Each team would also like if at all possible a bard to sing mana.  The last slot can be used to split the load of the most mana-intensive buff sequence (usually a cleric).  <br />
<br />
When there are enough to do two or more complete buff teams, the highest levels are usually assigned to tanks, then the lower level team to casters.<br />
<br />
Here is the general sequence (in each case, the buff name is just a sample buff in the line.  Use the appropriate level buff):<br />
<br />
1. Shaman<br />
The stat buffs are the least important buffs, so the shaman comes first.  Shamans will generally call up an unbuffed raid member to the buff team, then buff them with:<br />
	A. Dexterity<br />
	B. Strength<br />
	C. Agility<br />
	D. Stamina<br />
	E. Talisman of Altuna (or INT casters self-shield)<br />
It's important to remember that these will be the first buffs removed, especially the first 3 -- so in those cases, it is acceptable to use lower-level versions (I tend to use the level 29 versions) in those cases to save mana.  The reason for doing Stamina and Altuna last is that they buff maximum HP, and ideally when they fall, the extra HP they imparted will already be gone.  When buffing INT casters, it's easier to skip Talisman of Altuna and ask them to cast their self shielding spell at this time.  When the shaman is done, he will inform his party who he's passing along to them, and ask the person to report to the<br />
2. Enchanter<br />
The enchanter's load is relatively light, but he/she will be also providing the buff group with clarity.  The buff process is:<br />
	F. Augment (for melee) or Clarity (for casters)<br />
	G. Rune<br />
Because the enchanter's load is fairly light, he/she will often act as &quot;traffic cop,&quot; making sure the cleric and druid get the right people in the right order.  The next stop is at the <br />
3. Cleric<br />
Pretty straightforward.  Cleric buffs are pretty mana intensive, especially if Shield of Words and/or Heroism is used, so this job is often split between two.  Order here is pretty flexible:<br />
	H. Symbol<br />
	I. Resolution<br />
	J. Shield of Words<br />
Then, the person finishes with the<br />
4. Druid<br />
If a druid is not available, a second shaman if handy, or even a cleric, with a mage to do the DS can fill this role.  The important thing to remember is that RESIST Magic and RESIST Fire/Cold be placed as the last two buffs.  If your druid does not have Resist, do NOT settle for endure.  Get a spare priest to fill the bill.<br />
	K. Damage Shield<br />
	L. Chloroplast<br />
	M. Resist Magic<br />
	N. Resist Fire/Cold<br />
Immediately after casting RF/RC, the druid should inform the member to camp immediately out to a pre-determined chat room so as to not wear out the shorter-lasting buffs.  When facing Nagafen, having a mage on hand to do the damage shield as the very last buff may be a desirable change, as Lava Shield also gives a Fire Resist bonus.<br />
<br />
This whole process can take a while, but if everyone on the buff teams has done it before, or just catches on quickly, it's possible to process about 3 people at once, as much as mana allows.  Extra bards, necros, and manastones with healers can also help the process by providing extra mana.<br />
<br />
As long as you keep the general goal in mind: the two resist buffs last to be maximally protected, you should do fine.  Good luck with the dragon!<br />

<br />
Also, as a cleric, you might consider having DB, DA up, and clicking them right away to prevent buffs from being dispelled, sice people never need heals at the start of the fight!<br />

I have always encountered a fifteen buff limit, and Rorgg/Werdse listed fourteen of them. Not much room for extra junk buffs beyond those. Unless the other buffs take and the icons simply do not show?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Verbannen</div><div class="date">07-26-2000, 06:13 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I have done several Dragon raids recently.  Groups are typically:<br />
<br />
2 tanks<br />
Shaman or Druid<br />
Mage<br />
Cleric<br />
Bard<br />
<br />
Since each group is pretty much like this, buffing is self-sufficent within the groups.<br />
<br />
After dispelling, I (cleric) cast Resist Disease, Poison, and Fire (for Vox) or Cold (for Naggy).  These are the cleric &quot;junk buffs&quot;.  After this, cleric sits and meds.  I recommend the Resist series over the endure series because they last twice as long.<br />
<br />
Next, shaman (or druid/mage) casts See invis, levitate, and Strength.  Next is Stamina, and Armor of Faith.  These constitute the &quot;low end buffs&quot;.  After this, do Aug (tanks) or Clarity + Brilliance/Insight (casters).<br />
<br />
Next come HP buffs, Hero/Reso and Naltron, then RM (preferably have an enchanter join group briefly and do group RM), and RC (repeat with Druid doing Circle of Summer).<br />
<br />
Sn now the buffs, in order are: (for Vox, switch fire and cold for naggy)<br />
<br />
Tanks.....Casters<br />
Res Poi...Res Poi<br />
Res Dis...Res Dis<br />
Res Fir...Res Fir<br />
See Inv...See Inv<br />
Levitat...Levitat<br />
End Bre...End Bre<br />
Stamina...AoF<br />
Aof.......Brilliance/Insight<br />
Augment...Clarity<br />
Altuna....Altuna<br />
Hero......Hero<br />
Naltron...Naltron<br />
Res Mag...Res Mag<br />
Res Col...Res Col<br />
<br />
This is 14 of the 15 buffs you are allowed.  Bard should twist Resist Magic and Elements songs.  The bard songs will not work without a space for the icon, so one of them will not take affect until the first dispel hits.<br />
<br />
Also, it pays to do some prep work on the equipment end.  Get some Peridot Plat rings (4ac 10save cold), Golden peridot bracers (6 save cold), Froglok crown (20 save fire and cold), cloak of the ice bear (20 save cold), Mistmoore shield (10 save magic, fire, cold), BS Mantle (10 save magic), and Dwarven Ringmail Tunic (8 save fire, magic, cold)<br />
<br />
Your wisdom takes a hit, but that is somewhat offset by the insight.  Going into raids, I have about 180 wis, 140 cold/fire resist and 110 magic resist, without bard song.  Bard song puts resists close to 200.<br />
<br />
The last 4 raids, I have not been feared once, and the AoE breath barely takes half a bubble.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Vendrix[Da`Kor]</div><div class="date">07-26-2000, 08:50 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I've downed 60+ dragons before they implemented this new sub-53 patch, here's my take on group make-up, buffs and tactics...<br />
<br />
The, hands down, best group against a dragon is 3 Warriors, Bard, Cleric and whatever (backup healer would be optimum). Then again, at least on EMarr, Dragon raids were a lot like a Chinese buffet. Always different and take what you can get. Sometimes we had a shortage of Clerics (downed Vox with 2 healers pre-Kunark with no losses, a few times), Paladins, etc. Anyway, dragon raids are where Bards really shine. I didn’t realize their true power until I checked my resists pre-combat and saw a 225 Magic resist and 235 Fire/Cold resist. A good Bard won't even swing a sword at the Dragon, just stand under the beast and twist songs keeping everyone under that uber-resist umbrella. Before you rush the dragon, have the Bard stop playing and hit everyone with a ONE buff dispell, hopefully this clears the top buff location. Then the Bard starts playing again filling that spot with whatever song. When the Dragon casts an AE spell, the only buff to get dispelled will be the Bard song, which refreshed itself in 1-5 seconds anyway, you loose nothing. As for the 6th spot, that can be a tank, Cleric, Druid, Shammy or just about anything else. If it were a backup healer, I would always tell them, &quot;you heal me and Ill heal everyone else, that’s your only job&quot;.<br />
<br />
Buffs you need to think about ahead of time. Will you have a Bard? Are you a tank or caster? If you have a Bard you don't need any junk buffs, you aren't going to lose anything. If you don't, then you need to lay on 1-4 junk buffs (see inviso, endure poison/disease, etc). Tanks may want less junk buffs to fit Haste and stat buffs, ask them. Casters don't require all those stat buffs and haste, just enough HPs to survive. Lay a pile of junk buffs on them. No matter what buffs you cast, make sure that Resist Cold/Fire/Magic as well as the big HP buffs(symbol and talisman) are all last, you want them as long as possible in the event of multiple AE dispells. On our raids, we required that everyone had unbuffed CR/FR of 80 and unbuffed MR of 60, it's not that tough to get those numbers at all.<br />
<br />
Tactics are pretty straightforward. The object is to do as much damage as you can in the shortest amount of time. Sounds simple eh? I found AE heal to be the best spell at Dragon raids. I would firmly plant by ass under the beast and after the second AE breath, start popping off AE heals. Since everyone was taking damage from the Dragon breath and everyone was close, AE heal is by far the most mana efficient spell to use. As an FYI - if you find that sitting behind a wall and healing, without the dragon breath hitting you, is a great thing to do… think again. That’s an exploit. If you are going to fight a Dragon, be man/woman enough to stand face to face with it and not hide behind a wall for your own safety. Other than that, just remember not to push Nagafen into the lava or Vox up onto a rock, both make them much more difficult to kill and can actually screw your entire raid.<br />
<br />
Oh, before I forget… Magic Resistance in the be all - end all resist when it comes to a dragon raid! All your powerful weapons and uber-fire/cold resist don't mean a damn thing if you go running out of the room 5 seconds into the fight. With a 110 magic resist, I was never fear… that was at level 50. It's not a tough number to come by. A good +10 MR shield, Skull Shaped Barbute and some platinum diamond/jacinth rings are all you need other than good old Resist Magic or Group Magic Resist(GMR).<br />

Time from ice giants to Vox death including buff prep was usually 40 minutes or less, with the actual dragon fight involving 1 or fewer deaths.<br />
<br />
Buff order is the most important thing in a dragon raid.<br />
<br />
On my warrior (my main character) my buffs were as follows, in this order:<br />
<br />
Resist Disease<br />
Resist Poison<br />
Guise of the Deceiver<br />
Grim Aura (note on this later)<br />
Strength<br />
Agility<br />
Dexterity<br />
Stamina<br />
Talisman<br />
Resolution<br />
Shield of Words<br />
Symbol<br />
Resist Magic<br />
Resist Fire/Cold<br />
Rune series<br />
<br />
If you can teach your tanks to NOTICE when they get dispelled and to recast something on themselves (like that grim aura earring from grachnist) then they probably won't die.<br />

<br />
How we do it is this:<br />
Fill the first 4 slots with stat buffs cha,dex,agi,str - which costs no mana with jaundiced armor<br />
Then Stamina and talisman<br />
Then Rune<br />
Then Cleric buffs (SoW, Symbol, Hero)<br />
Then Aug<br />
Then RM and elemental resist (fire or cold)<br />
Then Chloro, DMG shield just before fight.<br />
<br />
Which leaves room for 2 more buffs which can either be bard song, or more junk. Hybrids can get a clarity if they really want it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
recently did my first Nagafagagafen raid.<br />
<br />
Had about 4 groups or so.<br />
<br />
Did 4 junk buffs (little guys, resist disease, etc.) plus necro, and druid buffs.<br />
<br />
Then we got ready, and stormed into Naggy's lair.<br />
<br />
We got obliterated.  Some bug occurred that no one could do ANYTHING but run and type.  We couldn't target, or cast.  I couldn't even hit f10 to camp, I ended up /qing.  By the time I got back, everyone was dead.<br />
<br />
5 hours or so later, we finally got everyone's body rezzed up and summoned.<br />
<br />
Just a small FYI - not sure if it was a complete fluke or not, but it was a serious bug which the GMs chose to ignore when we petitioned.<br />

This is a bad idea. Bards can vastly improve your CR/FR and MR. I had a bard in my group one day practicing twisting 3 songs and with some of her best up I had almost 200 CR and MR WITHOUT resist gear on.<br />
<br />
Bards are your best friend as far as resists go.<br />
