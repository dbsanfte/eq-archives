<TEXTAREA NAME="EditedMessage" ROWS=10 COLS=45 WRAP="VIRTUAL">The problem actually started out very early on in the start of Everquest.  Before all the expansions all the AA.  The ratio of Clerics to Druids was by far a smaller number everyone had a Druid they were by far the superior priest class at the time.

As the game evolved and expansions started to appear new challenges new spells, new skills appeared the Druid found themselves now in vast numbers and competing for the rights to a limited number of places as backup healers/DD on raids.  The cleric was also required here as the primary healer so always had a place.  Druids complained (had a bigger voice because of numbers explained before) and had many advantagous changes made to their class as a whole making them even more powerful outside the raid arena and somewhat more useful during raids.  Clerics on the other had didn't really have any major beneficial changes that actually made them more useful outside the raiding arena.  

Clerics today are the poorest class for solo play (AA exp really hasn't helped the clerics cause at all).  A cleric requires a Tank or Melee to kill mobs in most cases at an effecient rate bot other healer classes can solo very easily and probably get twice to three times the AA experience that a Cleric/Melee combo can get in the same time.

It is said that a cleric is the benchmark for the all priest classes well we might be the benchmark for healing spells but nothing else.

Druids seem to always complain about not being useful on raids but in essence this is the price you pay for the class you have chosen to play you get supreme solo ability but raids don't really require you all that much.  The cleric on the other pays the price for their high requirement in raids with the lack of ability to solo effeciently. 

If I stood up and said out of all the healer classes if there was one class that I saw as slightly unbalanced it would be the shaman why you might ask well think about this-

1  A Shaman is pretty much mandatory now on raids the more the better (I think same dersireability as clerics)

2  The are quite able to solo very effectively

3  In many cases a shaman is more desireable in an EXP group than a cleric or druid (slows, heals, dots just can't be beat ask any warrior)

More and more I am finding myself grouping with friends during exp hunting and actually not doing much at all the melee never really take enough damage to warrant a heal and my nukes tend to get resisted a lot, if they don't they take so long to cast that I might get one off on a monster and then find myself interupting my second cast cause the monster is dead already.


Saarem,

You only look at the one thing (druids not wanted on raids) what Grumbles was trying to get as was along the Risk vs Reward line you see a Druid can achieve large amounts of exp in a very short time with little or no risk at all.  Clerics have fallen well behind every other class for exp hunting since the expansion "Shadows Over Luclin" the AA abilities that are there are designed mo so for the Druids and the Shamans and not the clerics let me explain this:

What use is a Critical Heal on a complete heal? sure I can heal 21000HP but give me a tank with more than 8k and I will be very impressed.  For a Druid a Critical Heal on a NT means a 2 - 3k Heal which when you think about it is up with the clerics usual complete heal.

The sadest part for clerics is actually the class specific AA while all other classes get things that are very beneficial a cleric really doesn't get anything to right home about. Lets start a little post mortum here shall we: First the cleric Class AA:

* Mass Group Buff (Druids get this also)

* Divine Ressurection (100% exp rez only cast every 72 RL hours onyl good for rezzing self maybe)

* Innate Invis to Undead (Utterly Useless skill)

* Celestial Regeneration (Nice Heal of Time for No Mana)

* Bestow Divine Aura (bestows invulnerability to player has its uses (144Min Refresh However)

* Turn Undead (Due to casting times of this ability its only useful upto 2nd level and even then has issues namely finding undead of high enough level to kill for exp)

* Purify Soul (Cures majority of harmful effects again has only certain uses due to 72Min refresh)

* Spell casting Reinforcement Mastery (Druids get this also)

OK Now for the Druid Class AA

* Mass Group Buff (clerics get this too nice to have item)

* Quick Evacuation (at level 3 all evacaution spell 50% faster very nice indeed)

* Exodus (No Mana Instant Cast Evac Spell I see this being useful if a raid is going sour?)

* Quick Damage (Hmm Faster casting Nukes let me see Cleric nuke is 6 seconds for 925DD hmm Druid with this get a 3.5 second 1100DD abouts seems good to me)

* Enhanced Root (makes root/DD much easier now hmm Risk vs Reward I hear someone cry)

* Dire Charm (Oh permantly charm an NPC hmm now you have a high level PET umm RvR???)

* Innate Camouflage (innate invis any cleric would be happy just to get an invis spell much less innate ability)

* Spell Casting Reinforcement Mastery (Cleric gets this also)

So as you can see the Druid AA is much more beneficial and useful to the class than the Cleric AA abilities basically to sum it up clerics GOT SCREWED with Luclin AA and you sit there an moan about not being wanted Blah Blah Blah all I can say is enjoy the freaking game and stop whining you got by far the better deal since the release of everquest and it seems are still getting it.

Sorry for the Rant I am just sick and tired of this arguement that seems to go on and on forever. 

Anyway my two cents finished
