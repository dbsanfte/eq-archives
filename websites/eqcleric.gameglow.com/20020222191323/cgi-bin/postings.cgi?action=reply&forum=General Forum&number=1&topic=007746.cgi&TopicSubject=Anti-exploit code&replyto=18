From what I read, the mob was hitting in the 500s and the fight lasted about 90 minutes. But, whatever, VI did what they did and some guild did what they did and in the end, they got an epic fight with worthless rewards cause they went around the barriers rather than through them. Right or wrong, it's VI's game and its done.

Those items were added after people found a way to bypass the quest to enter his room and then kill him. For alot of the things VI gets right, some things just make me shake my head and wonder. First, they always assume and expect players to take the most blunt and direct approach available. Never mind after 3 years we have shown them that we will find alternative ways to the same objective. Any time this happens it resultes in nerfs and/or changes to mobs. I don't know what it is that VI has against thinking outside the box, but they really do seem to hate anything players do that doesn't simply involve running screaming at the problem with a big stick. If VI had truly wanted players to only reach Seru via the quest, they should have designed his area better so that it was in fact the only way possible. It's not the player's fault that they found another way to reach him, if VI had better level designers, it would not have happened any other way. The loot just shows they blame the players, it is in fact Verant's fault and blaming the player is just being a poor sport.<P>Kinelaria</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#dedfdf"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Aerie</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">If people got into Sleeper's Tomb by somehow using spells and not killing first brood dragons for keys, you all would agree that it would be an exploit. Yet using gravity flux to get to Seru's hold (basically a mini-dungeon within a city that requires key) somehow isn't an exploit because it's possible to do so?</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#f7f7f7"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Kinelaria</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">   I don't feel like repeating myself endlessly, see what I said before. No, I don't consider it an exploit. If VI does, then they should design their zones better and realize this was something that should have forseen themselves. Using gravity flux to reach an area is neither a new idea, or a novel tactic (it's an adaption of Quake's rocket jumping). VI can even fix this, I am sure (they can patch in whole zones, I don't think modifying one slighty should be too hard). So really it's all in their court, it must not be a problem since it's not been fixed, and to my knowledge, nobody has been warned or banned for using this trick to reach Seru. There's no bugs being used here, no cheap camping in a wall type exploit, or anything at all out of the ordinary with what they did. They simply found utility in the side effect of an offensive spell, it's called out of the box thinking, and should be encouraged. Not everything should be about running screaming at something to bash it.<P>Kinelaria</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#dedfdf"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Aladain</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial"> <BLOCKQUOTE><font size="1" face="Verdana, Arial">quote:</font><HR>Originally posted by Kinelaria:<BR><B>Never mind after 3 years we have shown them that we will find alternative ways to the same objective.</B><HR></BLOCKQUOTE><P>But see, this is where you are wrong.

What point would there be to the cleric epic if people could simply skip to Ragefire?<P>The point is, there is a quest behind all this and Verant has made it impossible for you to simply skip past the other parts just to get to the reward. They grav fluxed up so they could get the glory of the kill first and see how hard he was and maybe get loot. They got the first two and part of the third but they were denied what others will have to quest for.<P>Has Verant punished players for going outside The Vision(tm) before? Yes. Is this a case of Verant doing so? Yes. The major difference? There is recourse here. They can do the quest and go back for the loot. Nobody has been robbed of anything. In fact, if anything, it actually BENEFITS other players.<P>The usual scenario is that uberguilds will blow through areas and exploit the hell out of them and then get it nerfed so nobody else can do the same, thus ensuring they have an advantage (for a while anyways). For once, Verant actually LEARNED something and was ahead of the game. If anything, it was a lesson to players. Verant has woken up to the pattern and put a stop to it. Moreover, it means there is less exploiting to be done AND less "uber" people have less of a gap.<P>Let's say that he HAD dropped normal loot... Everyone and their dog would have been grav fluxing up and killing him until Verant either nerfed the spell, the zone or the tactic.

They didn't find a clever way around an obstacle to get at an ubermob.

Loopholes and exploits weren't used, the players worked with what they had according to the way the game was designed.  The human mind is a powerful tool for getting around problems.<P>Verant did not take into account all of the powers that players have when they designed the dungeon and quest.  So when the dungeon and quest were attempted (playtested) by the players to the best of their abilities, Verant hastily did a work-around to force people to do the quest the "right" way, which can only be defined as the way Verant originally intended.  But the work-around was indeed "cheesy" and lazy, since it simply involved a localized nerf that did not fit into the storyline (unlike preventing levitation in VL, which makes sense).<P>Verant still seems to have a rather dictatorial style of dungeonmastering.  However, I can see that their game has grown so huge and complex that dungeon design that takes into account zillions of spells and their nuances is growing more difficult.  I expect that back-nerfing to close clever avenues will become more common as new expansions appear, with new spells and abilities.</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#dedfdf"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Varya Valorvixen</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">We killed Seru by G-Fluxing up and we thought is was pretty funny actually when the loot got nerfed. Our guildleader logged in to find out he was sporting a sexy pink BP with -99 to all stats instead of the godly BP he logged off with. We knew it was cheesy to kill him that way.
