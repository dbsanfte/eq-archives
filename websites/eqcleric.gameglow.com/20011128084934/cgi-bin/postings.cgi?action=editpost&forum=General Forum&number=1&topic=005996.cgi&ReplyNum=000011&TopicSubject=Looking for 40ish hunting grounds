<TEXTAREA NAME="EditedMessage" ROWS=10 COLS=45 WRAP="VIRTUAL">Mage/cleric should be able to do Kaesora.  At least, I could I think, because I know the zone, spawn rate and pathing pretty well.  There is a safe spot down by the church, that I could show you, but I am not sure I could tell you how to get there.  But I will try.

First off, Kaesora has both live and undead mobs.  You can usually travel all around it with either invis or invis to undead.  However, random spiders see invis.  So you need to con them.  Also, some of the ravenous nibblers or whatever they are sometimes spawn in with the undead, so look out for them and don't go too fast.  Here is how I would do it, to sort of see how it was going to work. 

Both you and your friend bind right outside Kaesora.  The only thing that jumps me there is some skelly named Targashin or something.  Don't worry about him just kill him.  Zone in.  There may very well be half a dozen people getting fangs in the church.  If that is so, you can send them a tell, letting them know you don't want Xal, you want to PL your cleric friend, they might not mind if you come hunt there, and if you check in from time to time, they might let you know before they leave so you can come get the camp while it is still broken.  (One time I was there to get a fang and I was checking in while we were hunting in the library, and the camp had all gotten keys except for one rogue. The rogue was by himself, he was delighted to have us come down and heal him and help him out).

Zone into Kaesora.  Get regular invis on each of you.  Drop down the left pit drop.  The left pit is not very far.  The middle one is, don't drop off the pit straight ahead of you, there are always spiders down there that see invis and there are lots.  Have gate memmed and gate to the entrance if you have any trouble.  (after you drop down the left pit, there is a door straight ahead of you with a pit drop right behind it, this pit leads straight down into the undead area and is in many ways easier, but you might have a fight at the bottom of the pit, and I don't know about pet pathing to get down there, you would certainlyh want lev to get down.  You could ITU and drop down, particularly with lev, this is a very easy way to get to the library from down there, then just explore around).  Hug the right wall around until you are in the first corner of the big room with three spiders.  Check to see if all three are indiff.  One or more of the spiders may see you, and may attack.  Alternatively, you could make a pet after you drop down, that is a pretty safe spot.  I am not sure about best strategies for that area with a mage.  I would think a 40 cleric could heal your pet and you could have a cake walk of a time in there.  3 spiders at once can be problematic, especially when 2 people are learning how to work with each other.  Anyway, kill or invis past the three spiders in that big room.  Next stop is the doorway in the room with the 3 spawn.  Go in there and invis past or kill the 2 spiders in that room.  That room has a fake wall.  Go through the fake wall and down the tunnel, killing as you go.  Should be cake from that point on.  When you get to the library, pull the library out to the tunnel until it is clear, then you can set up in the library and should have no problems at all.

To give you an idea of the Church area difficulty, here is how we broke the church spawn.  49 cleric (me), 49 druid and 49 mage.  We went into the center of the church, right by where Xalgoz spawns and I took off ITU.  They started hitting me.  Mage waited 2-3 seconds and cast a pet.  Druid healed me a couple times.  Pet killed all the mobs.  (There is a large pit on the floor of the right side of the church facing the pulpit.  It is not a bad drop, but there are three undead down there, and it is a real pain to get 3 adds at once, they shouldn't come up if you are fighting, but you need to keep it clear, to avoid some of the problems with pathing and just because you will want to be killing stuff, and i like to avoid having monsters right below me).

Best place to pull the church:  When you get down to the end of the tunnel where you see the church, hug the left wall.  You get to a spot that is like a little natural alcove.  There are occasional roamers here, but it is pretty safe, and if your pet will stay there and mind, you should be able to pull to there.  

I have seen plenty of 50+ folks in this dungeon asking me for a res.  Be careful.  I think the two of you can do it, but you need to get to know the zone, and if you get over confident, it is quite easy to get swarmed by a gazillion greens in here.  And I would vote Earth Pet.  Like anywhere else, you don't want any runners.

This zone is perfect for what you want to do.
