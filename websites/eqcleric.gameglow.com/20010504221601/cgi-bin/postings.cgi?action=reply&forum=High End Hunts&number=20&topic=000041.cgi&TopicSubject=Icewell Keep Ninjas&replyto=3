[B]Regular guides can do something against ninjas, so the guides that said they had to wait for the server GM, were not really well-trained apparently. No, they couldn't have banned the ninjas on the spot or return the items to the rightful parties, but they could have watched the situation via GM-Invis, and handed out warnings if need be. They could also gather sufficient evidence on the ninjas for the server GM.

Problem is getting pretty bad, someone on my server had a BP ninjaed from him the other day... my guild is starting to do this camp and already has had hassles with potential ninjas. Any ideas?</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#f7f7f7"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Brodder</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">YES- One take down their names, TWO, contact VI staff-via petition. TWO have your own neutral party ther to corpselock the kill if you are too busy, IE fighting more than one in a pull where you can't loot and lotto immediatley.<BR> LET everyone in zone know- TAKE screenshots and post them on a MOST wanted page (too bad you can't PvP in these situations).<BR> ALSO- IF you know what item was on the critter-kill you can tell the GM-investigatiosn like this are taken seriously. VULTURE NINJA's are treated just like a raid ninja- No mercy is shown. Another lil trick is to have some ALTS group with the NINJA's and play along with their plan- BUT have an anon 55+ mage with your "GROUP"...<BR> He moves for the item have mage lev down into ICEWELL shaft and COH him....OR LEV above the ICE CAP and COH- then gate...many would be surprised at teh fall...Okay the later would be punished too, harshly, but at least you can dream it.<P> 1- Contact STAFF in these situations.<BR> 2- MOVE off- if they follow, warn them to please leave your group be. Or Raid be.<BR> 3- LOG and /report anything and every thing they say-even if you have to zone repeatedly. Follow with petition. Or have each member who  is in range /report every 10 lines or so of his speech- or tells OOCs shouts etc etc.<BR> 4- even if they LOG GMs can track them- data is stored server side so they cannot escape even by destroying item. Looting even a copper off a kill that isn't yours is a ninja offense-much compounded if the INTENT to steal is there.<BR> 5- BE POLITE and FIRM.<BR> 6- DO NOT STOOP to their game- they will use it faster than you would to make your life miserable with the staff. IF you think any of your guildmates might fly off the handle and make threats-Silence them. Prewarned is prepared.<BR> 7- only time we had this problem was in SOL B way back on Bertoxx in the KPC room- If we killed King or Priest inevetiably a MONK would train us and and FD. Too bad I'd Heal him <G>. And our Monk, would corpselock until that monk was toast, and then he'd FD. This is the time we discovered that 5 casters can AOE any train in SOL B fairly easy.<BR> IF we saw the MONK coming down the hall I'd call PREPARE AOE's. Soon several LDCS bats or Doggies would come running. Having 3 LVl 50s in room with us did help- 5 AOE's and one AOE STun then AOE MEZ later our single tank could take down each one by one. I was never over 30% mana in that group that day let me tell ye.<BR> Finally Tinysa showed up and listened as the monk said he just kept taking a wrong turn on way out of zone from bad pulls.<BR> She asked why he had 2 RMBs in bag, and various other loots in a tinker bag from this room's drops today? <BR> Silence-<BR> She then asked Who he was pulling for-<BR> SIlence-<BR> She said she'd already asked each group in zone- and all had filed against him in petitions-<BR> He went LD-<BR> 1 minute later she summons a necro-<BR> 20 seconds later he is swimming in lava-<BR> 10 seconds later he is dead-<BR> 10 seconds later he is perma banned-<P>so we didnt get our ninja'd items back-<BR>but we got justice-<P>NOT necessarily going to happen every time-<BR>But I can say someone in our group aparently was a VI staffer that day...and no it wasn't me.

Overall the GM's talked about the server GM not being online and 'I'll tell him tomorrow when he's online'.  In the end basically nothing has been done.  They often log in ogres and block the castle entrances and get our pullers killed/almost killed and the GM's will move them to a different part of the zone, then they just walk back and stand in the same spot repeatedly.<P>Our only solution (which has worked quite well) is that the group who gets the kill can loot it.  If no one on the raid needs it, then it is destroyed on the corpse before the corpse goes public.  Since doing this we've cut down the number of 'camping plooter begger scum' by at least 70% and only had 1 set of arms plooted.<P>I really hate beggers, even nice ones.
