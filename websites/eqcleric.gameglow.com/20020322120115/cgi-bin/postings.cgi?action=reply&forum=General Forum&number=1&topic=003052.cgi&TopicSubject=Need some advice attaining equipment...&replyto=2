The PAW? Saving for the PAW? Unless you're super rich in Platinum, and I don't know a a cleric that is, you're not going to buy a PAW. On Prexus, I've not seen one that went for less than 10k Plat. I was lucky enough to buy my Platinum Ring for 1500 Platinum, but the other three rings I had to earn the hard way. (I wonder how much the gold ring sells for anyways.)

I've never seen Golden Efreeti Boots sold. I've only been invited to one Efreeti raid.

So, not to be mean, but the things you mention require you to be seriously twinked, have real good friends in the game, or you have some real great items for trade.

Or have fun and earn 'em, and before you know it, you'll be level 45!!!!

(Not a powerplayer, but at level 45 I have 2 of the 3, just need the boots now.. but I'm not counting on them.)

Mammoth cloaks on my server were going for about 2500.  GE boots are around the 5 digit figure as is the paw.  Sometimes people are willing to sell some of the individual rings needed for the paw, but usually not the tough ones.  With the aegis quest, it's a lot of luck.  I spent many hours there in a row camping for Grimrot.  Finally I gave up camping for Grimrot and decided to get my faction high enough.  Then by per chance I happened to be doing a res in the NK area and just decided to pop in on the Grimrot camp and see if I could get lucky.  I was extremely lucky that day.  Was another high level cleric, a low level cleric and a wizard camping at that time.  The wizard was just helping the 2 clerics.  Both clerics had been there earlier when 2 versions of the dead Grimrot had spawned so they both had the heart.  I was lucky enough to already have the scythe, so I just hung out with them for a short period of time.  We ended up killing 2 versions of the live grimrot and 1 dead grimrot about 30 mins after I got there.  So a lot of the camp is just pure luck.<P>The best thing to do to raise cash would be get a warrior partner and go hunt giants.  Giants roam around in oasis, south ro and rathe mountains.  To get giants to spawn in oasis and south ro, kill the giant scarabs.  They tend to make the giants spawn quicker. I've heard that killing the lizards in the rathe mountains makes the giants there spawn quicker, but that is just speculation - not a proven thing as far as I know.<BR><P>------------------<BR>Dalur Stouthealer<BR>53rd Dwarven Vicar<BR>Veeshan Server</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#dedfdf"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Dorad</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">items = time<P>You could always power level to 40 - then try to get into a King / Lord group in lower guk. <P>*Note Clerics can go into high lvl areas because heals are not resisted - 600 point heal is 600 point heal<P>The king room you can get a crown of the froglok kings you could trade for decent items or pp.<P>The lord room if your real lucky you can get YK which you can trade for PP or items.<P>Both rooms have great exp for a lvl 40 and decent loot.<P>Or you could start soloing specters / Hill Giant which drop decent loot.

As much as I would like to have the nice "high" end equipment, it's just not feasible for me because of the time needed to obtain these items. In my early days, I spent as much tme as I could, but still never got the Testament of Vanear. A Paw of Opalla, Aegis of Life, Efreeti Boots aren't items that I'll have any time soon or if ever (I do have everything for the Aegis but the Scythe). Even in the cleric quest armor, the only pieces I got myself were the Boots, Gloves and Greaves, and that took a span of about 10 levels to do. A guildmate (Druid) got me the chestplate, and another friend nailed Gull for me. Buying things is out of the question too because any nice item I get, I give to my friends instead of selling. The last item I sold or traded was a Chipped Bone Bracelet for an Evil Eye Bag. (I gave away my first EE bag). <P>Even though I don't have the "best" gear, and my wis is nowhere near 200, I still get by. EB Boots, Aegis, Paw, etc are great items but you really don't NEED them, at least I don't. At level 50 now, I have only 170 wis, with an AC at about 800. Try not to get too caught up in what you don't have, and enjoy what you do have.<P>------------------<BR>Veloran Triumphante<BR>50th High Cleric of Tunare<BR>Quellious</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#dedfdf"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Gniss Fleshmender</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Uh Cat?

Possibly depends on which server you are on.<P>2. Possibly depends on how much an item means to or what it is worth to the person selling/buying/trading.<P>As a cleric, a Mith 2hander doesn't do you much good, so you traded it for something that would. Sounds like a fair trade to me  <IMG SRC="http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/wink.gif"> <BR></FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#f7f7f7"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Walbort</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Hiya, Meddik! *waves*<P>Sorry to hear about your guild. If you have trouble finding people to hunt with, get in touch in-game, love to have you along.<P>Since I'm on your server and recently went through the process of evaluating trade offers for a FBSS (I rolled a 92!!! NO WAY!!!), let me offer a couple of recent opinions for your consideration.<P>-The Aegis of Life really is worth the time. You can do it in short shots, don't have to get it all at once, and besides, you're not likely to get both pieces in one camp anyway. If you camp it with a ranger or druid (you do need some help, live Grimrot is a bad mutha), they can pull cyclops and the like for experience while you whack putrids for the faction you'll need for the quest. Obtaining it was perhaps the most satisfying quest I've ever finished (and it's cool to be called a Defender of Life by the paladin guildmaster in Qeynos when you're an ugly dwarf  <IMG SRC="http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/smile.gif">, and WHAT an item!<P>-You just got JBoots! Shut up! *slaps self* Sorry, my insane jealousy is sometimes difficult to control.<P>-The Paw seems to go for around 5K in our bazaar, but I don't see many go up for plat. Mammoth cloak is probably 3-4K if someone sells it, but they almost always go as a trade. EBoots practically never get sold. A druid friend of mine put together 15K plat and has had no luck finding a taker.<P>-Lower Guk has noticably opened up on our server, and clerics are always in demand. I ended up getting an abalone gorget and a Paw for my FBSS. All it takes is a little luck in the Arch-magi, King, Sage, Supplier, or Frenzied rooms (and maybe others) and you're in the money.<P>-Finally...I know this sounds hypocritical, but through my recent acquisitions, I've learned how hollow item attainment is as a primary objective. I netted 15 WIS and 13 AC from my new items, and you know how much mana I gained at my level (after substracted mana lost from +mana items I was replacing?) About 60. 60! Not even enough for a REGULAR heal. Honestly, it felt hollow- I wondered, was this really all there is? Then I ran into a naked half-elf ranger on the docks in Freeport. Without presumption, he shared his sad story with me, of being killed in Crushbone while bound in Freeport. Without saying a word, I abandoned my plans, gated nearby, found his corpse, and rezzed him, saving him at least 30 minutes of travel and probably a couple hours of exp. Felt 1000 times better than putting that shiny stuff on. Just go have fun with your friends- if you haven't spent much time in Guk, so try it and see if you like it. If not, go do whatever you enjoy with the people you enjoy doing it with. If you haven't done the cleric armor quests, I had a blast doing them and highly recommend them. And I got to 202 wisdom wearing a full set of cleric armor, too, so don't let anyone tell you it sucks.  <IMG SRC="http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/smile.gif"><P>Look me up anytime, friend.<P>Walbort</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#dedfdf"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">SeaOfHoles</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">From what people are saying though, no one has seen undead Grim in 6+ weeks.<P>------------------<BR><B>Murrachan Moorsfang</B>(45th Rank Dwarven Priest)<BR><B>Briathrachan Moorsfang</B>(40th Rank Halfling Warrior)<BR>Mist Riders<BR>Mithaniel Marr</FONT></TD></TR></TABLE>
