My Cleric can easily keep up with heals there with just MC1, FT3 boots, and BAotR, it's my damned SK that can't keep up with snares.  He needs Deathly Temptations badly.  A Monk would just obliterate the mobs so to hell with Snares.<P>I mean if you just want full blue kills CT is hardly the way to go.  CT is great in a full group as you get excellent XP plus loot.

It is ALL about the players behind the screens.  I know I can count on this group, I know we can succeed, and they know it too. This group killed Verina Tomb, not once but twice, (60 cleric for the chanter epic) with only the addition of a lvl 40 rogue, as an example of what we can do if we put our minds to it. honostly, we didnt need the rogue, but we encourage guildies to group so when he wanted to go along we took him.  <P>Even if we play alts, whatever combo we have, we can succeed because we work well together and we trust each other.

Oh and I admit I'm assuming gear level to be pretty high.<P>For exp, hmm.<P>Classes that obviously aren't all that:<BR>warrior and shadow knight... monk tanks blue mobs just as well and outdamages both, so if you can choose there's no reason not to pick a monk over the two<BR>druids and wizards also come out as pretty weak, since druid can't heal by themselves without being insanely inefficient and if there's a shaman/clr in group they're reduced to nukers and wiz will own them there. Alas wiz dishes out more damage than dru so that's out with the druid... but wiz doesn't outdamage melee without manaregen help, and then we're looking at no tank or healer (unless you go for something funky like enc/pal/wiz, which admittedly might work).<BR>Rangers are also crippled bit indoors because Verant slacks and archery isn't very reliable... so if we're looking at a 3man able to operate in any exp zone I'd have to say rangers are out too.<BR>For exp you don't do hard hitting mobs... damshields just don't make up for lost damage that you get by putting a clr in your group. So slows > damshields+CHs -> shm > clr. Also paladin can heal pretty well now and they dish out pretty impressive dps especially against the undead.<P>We're left with monk, rogue, bard, paladin, shaman, enchanter, magician and necro. Bard has a significant issue with damage unless they can charm, mostly they act as a replacement healer... would never put them in group with a shm or enc. You have 3 methods of damage control and that's those 3. Get to pick one and deal with it.<P>Enchanters are good and bad. They become extremely powerful if they can dire charm, but as a weakness they're fragile and are really in grave danger if your groups healing method is a paladin. And even a dire charmed pet doesn't really justify having a cleric in a 3man (if we're talking bigger groups, the cleric becomes quite justifiable). All in all I don't think enc is worth the risk unless you have a very, very controlled environment. Something funky like enc/nec/pal in an area with lvl 46 undeads would be interesting, but frankly the group wouldn't be good in most areas.<P>Also paladin/bard/shm don't stack since they're also there for the healing purpose really. Also you do need someone tanking and it'd be monk or paladin really.<P>Pretty much any combo from then on owns.<BR>Monk/shm/nec, pal/rog/mag, monk/bard/rog are all extremely potent groups.<P>Still like it was said before... it comes down to the people behind the keyboard. You can really rip places apart with combos like enc/mag/clr too assuming low MR mobs. Still the easy combos come down to often having a monk (best tanking + damage combo), shm (usually best endurance + damage reduction + damage combo) and a third person for damage.<P>-- Delheru Tanreall<BR><A HREF="http://www.ascentguild.com" TARGET=_blank>Ascent</A>, Rodcet Nife</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#f7f7f7"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Panteroo</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Yeah the Shm/Mnk/Rog combo is definitely powerful, heck when i can actually get a good connection on the P.O.S. 3rd PC I play a Clr/Mnk/Rog trio.<P>but my favorite trio is:<P>Shadowknight/Rogue/Cleric<P>why?<P>Shadowknight - a nice big fat SK with aego can hit 4k hp without alot of difficulty.

With BAotR + MC3 i hardly run into mana problems ever in exp groups without an enchanter. Throw in root for CC if/when it's necessary.<P>I once did some parsing for my rogue while exp grinding in the Chardok mines (niblik, bank, herb). The only variable between the two tests was the presence of a SK in one. With the SK's atk buffs my rogues atk was able to get at or slighly above 1400. My DPS increase went from 92.25 to 103.47 with those added atk buffs. Thats a 10% increase in DPS on a non-uber rogue and IMHO, that's alot. <P>Your not losing slow's either. A rogue can make slow poisons and while they are not anywhere near Shaman slows, they do the job pretty well. I have never had a problem with my rogues aggro when using slow poisons when my SK tanks.... rogues also have the Locustlure as a slow option as well.<P>That's just my thoughts anyway</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#dedfdf"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Violet</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">What about paladin and DC enabled enchanter?
