I have a Defender named Electra Quetem on the Freedom server.  Primary ability is Empathy, secondary is (forget actual name) Dark forces.  A decent soloer at level 5!  <br />

Anyone else playing a Defender?  <br />

I'm curious about what Power Pools to take.  Too many good choices!</div></div><hr />

Got my guy up to level 15. Been thinking on cancelling EQ and just using his account to play because he doesn't use it. Anyway, I was very torn between going flight or going run speed, but seriously, once you take hover and you get to the top of some of those skyscrapers, you will never regret the decision :) Take Hover then take Flight when it opens up and save the rest of your choices for your normal powers. A couple of the leadership ones might be handy if you're planning on being a healer though.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yup, got an empathy/dark one myself.  Don't play him too much though, but he is entirely focused on being the healer/buffer, pretty much.  For power pools, I'm going fitness (swift, health, stamina), leadership (all 4 of them), and teleport (recall friend, teleport).  But I'm only planning on taking 2 or 3 powers from the secondary pool...can't solo well at all, since I only have the basic secondary pool nuke;)  I want fitness for health to recover damage taken by absorb pain, stamina to pay for the end cost of keeping up 3 leadership abilities.  The leadership abilities are to boost the effectiveness of the group.  Recall friend because it has uses in pulling as well as recovering the bodies of people that die in the midst of baddies we can't clear.  And teleport because, well, travel power and got the prereq already;)<br />
<br />
If you intend to solo a bit though, hover, flight, and maybe air superiority are good choices, since mobs do more damage in melee than ranged, for the most part, and hover represents the easiest way to keep most of them out of reach.<br />
<br />
Also play an invuln/energy melee tanker, an assualt rifle/devices blaster (my soloer), and an ice/ice blaster.  All on Pinnacle.  Got a few other characters too, fun to design costumes and themes;)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Uh oh... that is gonna blow.  I have yet to group.<br />
<br />
I'm actually impressed with how well my character solos.  I've picked more from her secondary powers, Dark Blast, than from the Empathy Powers so far.  Simply because I wanted to solo a lot.  <br />
<br />
I found that sometimes my one blast spell is good enough I can kill something wtih one shot from a long distance. And the baddies don't come chasing after me.  So I have a fairly good chance of weeding them down a bit.</div></div><hr />

I suppose you could bind them manually to keys of your choice; it just isn't done by default.  I didn't know about the command the last time I tried defender.<br />

I haven't tried this personally, but looking at the guide, it should work.  Try that and let me know if it's bearable.  I know that trying to do it with the mouse made it a miserable experience.</div></div><hr />

You can set up binds to do this for you.  A good thread on binds can be found here: http://boards.cityofheroes.com/showflat.php?Cat=&amp;Number=281789&amp;page=1&amp;view=collapsed&amp;sb=5&amp;o=&amp;fpart=1<br />
<br />
Copied from the thread:<br />
/bind F1 &quot;team_select 1&quot;<br />
/bind F2 &quot;team_select 2&quot;<br />
/bind F3 &quot;team_select 3&quot;<br />
/bind F4 &quot;team_select 4&quot;<br />
/bind F5 &quot;team_select 5&quot;<br />
/bind F6 &quot;team_select 6&quot;<br />
/bind F7 &quot;team_select 7&quot;<br />
/bind F8 &quot;team_select 8&quot;<br />
<br />
This will bind F1 to select team member 1, F2 to 2, etc.  Hope this helps</div></div><hr />

Having said that, I plan to try a defender as a secondary - the fact they can solo quite well is a pleasant change from EQ clerics.</div></div><hr />

Have some RL friends who play on Liberty which is why I chose it.  Its interesting though.  The friends who played EQ know that it helps to watch your chat channels and will talk to you in the game, talk through missions or fights, work on strategy etc.   The friends who haven't played a MMORPG before will never respond to tells or group chat, and then act surprised when you don't want to group with them because they never say anything.</div></div><hr />

Pretty sure I saw Shaydiim as Super-Jew at one point.<br />
<br />
Also... is it only me, or does anybody get really annoyed at the group invites?  Myself and my friends have yet to actually be asked via tells or even local channels if we want to join groups yet are often spammed with group invites at times.</div></div><hr />

For a lot of the players I'm meeting in CoH this is thier first MMORG and they were drawn in by the chance to play &quot;Super Heros&quot; where the fantasy rp'ing of EQ never interested them. <br />
<br />
As an aside. I'm not at all sure why anyone would start playing EQ these days. Maybe it's that boredom has set in, but if I knew starting a game I would be in for all the years of grinding I've done to get to lvl 65 and my modest gear I'd probably smash the CD and melt it over the flames of the burning box. lol</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kitsinu</div><div class="date">05-14-2004, 03:33 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The character creation is pretty amazing.  You can make nearly anything you can think of, just stand in Atlas Park and look around a while to see how versatile the creation design is.  If you have a character in mind from a comic book, you can come within throwing distance of that character (sorry, no Cthulu squids).<br />
<br />
The game really is fairly easy.  When you have a controller to lock down mobs, you don't have any sort of &quot;I said not to touch the damn thing!  Weren't you listening?&quot; sorts of stress you get from EQ.  Taking out a locked down mob is a good thing as it keeps the mob from going for the controller if it gets loose.  Teams fights against the bad guys are a free for all at lower levels (but fun), though I imagine people will learn more control later on.  In fights it seems to be more &quot;What do I want to do?&quot; rather than &quot;What can I do?&quot;.  You are far less squeezed into a mold in CoH, though it is a bit early to be certain.<br />
<br />
The assist method is also superior.  Target whoever you want to assist and use your ranged attacks.  If the hero you are assisting will need a heal after the attack, hit your heal ability and it will start as soon as the ranged attack is finished.  No twitch timing involved.<br />
<br />
Going LOM as a healer in a fight?  You can rest once (long recharge time) when the team can do without you a bit.  We had 3 defenders in a group of 8 last night (I think I was the only Empathic healer doing the big heals) and they were able to take up the slack when I couldn't heal.  Since it takes time for a power to cycle and become ready for reuse, you have time to use your attack powers however you choose, and still do your healing job.<br />
<br />
The biggest weakness seems to be a lack of tanks, rather than a lack of healers.  Tanks probably die a bit too much due to inexperienced healers and the lack of Empathic Defenders (with a CH that costs them 20% of their own health that cannot be healed back for about 30 seconds).<br />
<br />
When making my empathic healer, I probably made a mistake by chosing &quot;radiation&quot; as my damage powerline (yes, you can chose what sort of resists you have to deal with).  Radiation lowers the defense of its target, and seemed like a good bet at the time because I expected more melees.  Instead, this game has more caster types than tank types being created (that I have seen), so something that increases the effectiveness of ranged powers hitting would probably be better (or even psi to ignore defense, though you are unable to do any damage to mindless machines with psi).<br />
<br />
As far as the interface, it was awful until I remapped the movement keys, autorun, and screenshot keys to what I was used to using in EQ.  The /bind commands provided earlier in this thread helped immensely as well.<br />
<br />
<br />
P.S. Infinity server, though I am still experimenting with characters to find the type I like the most.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Turns out that as a Storm/Psychic Defender, I only have one heal.  But I can solo pretty easily, and my one heal has been able to keep my groups alive pretty effectively, so I reckon it's okay.<br />
<br />
The Storm power set has a lot of debuffs, so I am reducing the damage that my people take, rather than healing as much, I guess.<br />
<br />
I have chosen all of my powers based on the &quot;story&quot; of my character, not based on any role that I wanted to play in groups.  Still, I think it's working out very well.<br />
<br />
The amount of time and detail that you put into character creation really inspires you to be &quot;true&quot; to your character in that sense.  At least it does for me :-).</div></div><hr />

I'm having as much fun just trying out new characters as I am playing my mains. <br />
<br />
The defenders are the closest thing to a cleric. I choose dark/dark for my powers and am in love with the amount of dmg, crowd control and healing I can do, I don't feel like a one trick pony anymore. Even though my power choice of dark/dark is a little lighter on healing one thing that really improved it was getting the power pool &quot;aid others&quot; skill; it really rounded things out by giving me a single target large heal to go with my group heals. <br />
<br />
I like it so much I've begun taking it as a choice on my other characters, combining it with &quot;aid self&quot; for a neat little field medic ability even on my scrapper. It's a pleasure to see that any class can get some type of heal abilities.<br />

<br />
Level 10 scrapper - ton of fun but I have to be careful if I'm the only melee character since a lot of mobs will jump me at once.<br />
<br />
Level 10 blaster - all he does is light stuff up.  I pull all the time with my sniper blast (so much fun to time it with someone else sniper blast and watch the fall over while his friends look around confused as to what just happened).<br />
<br />
Level 7 defender - I made him into the stereotypical healer in case my roommate ever wants to take a night off from healing duties.  It's fun that I get some offense in the secondary power set, hard to remember to heal all the time though :)<br />
<br />
Level 5 tanker - I chose the axe as his primary power set and the *thud* / seeing the mob fly backwards across the screen makes me very happy.  I'd like to get a few more powers to see what this guy is really capable of though.<br />
<br />
Level 3 blaster - yeah, I made another one to try out the assault rifle / devices setup.  Right now I need to level up for a couple more powers.  Web grenade is fun, so is caltrops and my buckshot.  I picked the long recharge high damage offensive skill which is in need of some quicker powers.<br />
<br />
I'm torn between blaster and scrapper as my fave, I guess it is situational.  Coming from being a cleric in EQ, I'm just all about high damage characters :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hilbur Helpmate</div><div class="date">05-19-2004, 06:58 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">One of the really nice things I find about this game is the sidekick option which lets one player sidekick a lower level person. The sidekick's level is then raised to one below the sidekicker. The sidekick doesn't gain any new powers but his powers' levels are effectively raises as is his hit points and defenses. The enhancements still seem to function as if the power was at the lower level though. None of mine ever change color in any case. Since how much damage you do and take as well as your base accuracy is massively dependant upon your level compaired to the opponents level sidekicking allows you to add a lower level person to a group that might be needed (healer or controller for instance) and they will be effective. <br />
<br />
I have a lvl 17 invun/war mace tanker and a lvl 8 mind control/empathy controller. Invunrability doesn't seem to reduce opponents melee damage much but you have so many hit points it doesn't matter very much. If you buy regen out of fitness and give it 3 healing enchancements you can chew through even con mobs with easy. I have teleport foe which is wonderful. <br />

One of the things I really love is jumping off stuff in this game. With my tanker the ground just trembles when I land from a high jump and I find that so amusing.</div></div><hr />

<br />
then at 22 when you can get SO into your resist, you can take on 30 mobs no problem..a whole lot of fun</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Axterix EnObelix</div><div class="date">05-20-2004, 01:56 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I play a variety of characters.  The one I play the most is my tanker, the Imperial Guard.  Invul/Energy melee.  Good fun.  Got both Unyielding Stance (good resists versus all but psionic, makes you basically immune to CC, but roots you) and resist physical with 6 DO resists, and 3 each on resist energy and elements.  Rocks, take about 50% of any attack other than psionic.  Next level, teleport, so I'll be able to port around in US.  And 2 levels after that, Invincibility.<br />
<br />
Also play an Ice/Ice blaster, Shosuro Namuki, based on Lot5Rs Scorpion Clan.  Just got her super jump, great fun to go jumping around the city and battles.  And an assault rifle/devices blaster, UPU-9B X, who has fly, also fun.  And an empathy/darkness defender, Axterix.  And, well, the list goes on, including a controller who will get superspeed, must try all travel powers!  All on Pinnacle.<br />
<br />
When making my empathic healer, I probably made a mistake by chosing &quot;radiation&quot; as my damage powerline (yes, you can chose what sort of resists you have to deal with). Radiation lowers the defense of its target, and seemed like a good bet at the time because I expected more melees. Instead, this game has more caster types than tank types being created (that I have seen), so something that increases the effectiveness of ranged powers hitting would probably be better (or even psi to ignore defense, though you are unable to do any damage to mindless machines with psi).<br />
<br />
Defense applies to both melee and ranged, so I wouldn't worry about that.  Personally, I like the radiation power set a lot for 2 reasons.  The first attack is one of the, if not the, fastest recycling attack in the game.  Just great for always having a button to push if you choose to take very little from the secondary power set.  And the second attack lets you shoot laser beams from your eyes.  Even defenders deserve a warm meal:)</div></div><hr />

I have a 14th Tech Inv / SS Tanker (Kraven Kor) that I love, but also rolled up 2 different defenders to mess around with -- Darkscion, a Dark / Dark Magic Defender, and Hotline, a Mutant Empathy / Psychic Blast Defender.<br />
<br />
Healing seems much less stressful in CoH -- I primarily use Aura heals, and with Darkscion my best heal is also a debuff, plus I have tons of stuff I can do a fair amount of damage with that all debuffs as well.  Haven't messed with Hotline as much, she is still level 2.</div></div><hr />

A bunch of my friends started playing it and EQ just aint payin anymore so I cancelled EQ and started CoH. Man is that a fun game!!!!!!!<br />
<br />
It's so nice to have RL friends that play the game too. I get to **** talk them all day when they mess up. mwahahah :D<br />
<br />
I am playing on Guardian as Teletran 1. He's a blaster, Energy/Gadget. I was told by someone while I was in beta that gadgets sucked so I never really tried it. But seeing as my character is a robot with Tech as his origin, it made sense. IT RULES! Web grenades are like root + slows. Caltrops are so much fun. You toss them down in an area and any mobs running over it are snared and take a small DoT. Toss a web grenade on them while on top of the Caltrops and they take that damage plus whatever you blast them with. <br />
<br />
I just really gotta get used to the whole macro thing. I haven't made any yet cause they look scary to make :P<br />
<br />
I took a look at the link someone posted eariler about binding keys? It looked like some coding language :P Is there some guide somewhere on what it all means? I know there is some in the guide book but they don't give many examples :P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Taku</div><div class="date">05-25-2004, 09:51 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The binds/macros in the links are some more complicated ones that you might be interested in later.  Forget if it was mentioned in the thread previously but /bind and /macro work exactly the same except for one minor difference, /bind hooks the command to a key or combination of keys on your keyboard while /macro makes a button you put on your little tray and can click.<br />
<br />
Here's a basic example:<br />
<br />
/bind numpad1 &quot;powexec_name Hover&quot;<br />
This makes it so every time you hit '1' on the number pad it will execute Hover.  The nice thing about calling it by name is that it doesn't matter where you drag the icon on the bar<br />
<br />
/bind numpad4 &quot;g Mesmerizing $target - please refrain from waking them.$$powexec_name Mesmerize&quot;<br />
The &quot;g&quot; at the beginning of the message make it always say the text in group chat no matter what the default is.  $target says the name of target.  The &quot;$$&quot; is the separator between commands.<br />
<br />
/bind h &quot;+up$$powexec_name Hover$$powexec_name Hover&quot;<br />
This one is handy.  The &quot;+up&quot; makes you jump before it turns on Hover so you have a little distance from the ground if you're trying to avoid the bad guys.  Not 100% why the second execute of Hover is in there since I took it from someone else but I believe it just makes the command *not* toggle.  When you hit the button Hover will always be on, even if it was on when y ou hit the button again.<br />
<br />
/bind LSHIFT+LBUTTON &quot;powexec_name Teleport&quot;<br />
I haven't used this one yet but it seems like it'd be a major bonus.  I don't have teleport but I believe currently you have to click on teleport then click on the screen where you want to teleport.  This speeds up the process.  If you hold down the left shift button and click the left button on your mouse it will start teleporting without having to do the two-step process of click on power then click on where to go.<br />
<br />
/macro moron &quot;local Hey $target, Good job moron!$$thumbsup&quot;<br />
Notice the /macro.  This will create a new button to click and I believe place it on your mouse pointer.  The button will be labeled &quot;moron&quot; (there isn't a lot of space so keep it short, also there is currently a bug that will keep you from logging in if you make a macro named &quot;color&quot; or &quot;colors&quot;).  The button will say in the local channel (like /say from EQ) &quot;Hey %target, Good job moron!&quot; and then do the thumbs up emote (the guy made this macro for the idiots who come along and finish off the pack of mobs you're working on).<br />
<br />
That just about tapped my basic knowledge on the subject, hope it helps :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Aean</div><div class="date">05-25-2004, 11:31 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Thank you very much, that clears up alot :)<br />
<br />
I think I will like the Bind keys alot, although the macros may be handy. <br />
<br />
This may be a dumb question cause i'm so used to EQ, but is there a /assist function? and could you make a macro out of it. I don't know how useful it would be though because of how many mobs you usually fight. It's almost better to just have it free for all :P</div></div><hr />

I am not sure if it works in reverse. I have casted a heal while I had a foe targeted, and the heal did land on a group mate, but I didn't test to see whether it was random, or if it was actually &quot;assisting&quot;.</div></div><hr />

I think if you're playing EQ without too much lag you'll find CoH is fine.<br />
<br />
Well, finally got CoH and solo it runs fine, but any 3+ or 4+ group going against 5+ mobs makes it a dia-show, and my EQ did run just fine without lag. CoH lacks more radical measures to minimize the graphical lag, since ye can only tune particles down, not stop drawing them altogether as ye can in EQ, and I'm well over the minimium requirements.<br />
<br />
So, well, I'm looking forward for a life of soloing as a scrapper I guess... :(</div></div><hr />

Was playing my healer Saturday night and noticed something.  If there is only one other person in my group and I hit my &quot;heal other&quot; button, it will automatically know to heal my partner.  Though as a healer I usually target the person in group most likely to need healing, that way I can lob shots at whoever they are targeting and be ready when they need heals.</div></div><hr />

I would make one kind of blaster then play it for a bit then make another one and try out the different powers to find what I wanted to be.  <br />
<br />
So far I love my mind controller, Dominate has got to be the best spell ever !! I mean a mezz that you can hit the mob durring and it doesnt wake up . I think it is a big reason killing with my hubbie is so easy. I play with my hubbie and he plays a tanker , well we have not needed a healer as of yet because I just mezz everything but the one target my tank is on and dominate that one so my tank takes no damage .  I love the AOe slows and knock backs as when mezz isnt the best choice I can slow em down and push em back away from me to get a better angle on the situtation. So far I am loving this game , my level 11 is my biggest girl after all my time trying each different combo choice , and so far we are on Justice server . I am not a power gamer as my level shows but I am taking my time and really enjoying this game , I cant  wait to fly tho .</div></div><hr />

Dominate isn't anything that the other controllers don't get (called differently: Blind, choke, etc) and Mind Controllers have some very, very weak, silly high level powers that no one really likes.  And their mid-level powers, most of them, are pretty so-so.<br />
<br />
The only reason I keep playing my Mind Controller is because I LOVE her secondary powers (storm).<br />

I've played illusion/kinetics, fire/radiation, gravity/something controllers and they can all pretty much do everything the Mind Controller can do and then some.</div></div><hr />

Healers in CoH are far more fun than EQ.  You generally have a secondary powerset that does some pretty good damage!  <br />
