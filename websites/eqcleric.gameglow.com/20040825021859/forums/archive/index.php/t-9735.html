<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Pirmin</div><div class="date">11-23-1999, 02:33 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Saw on EQVault (Sunday, November 21, 1999, http://www.eqvault.com/)  that a large number of monks had a &quot;sit-in&quot; on the Fennin Ro server to protest on the recent changes to feign death. 191 monks showed up! (http://www.eqvault.com/eqshots/monk_protest.jpg) John Smedley appeared as a 50 foot gnome and spoke to them saying that &quot;the feign death changes were done because people were exploiting dragon runs with it, but also said that they had received enough emails and feedbacks to reconsider and discuss the feign death situation on monday&quot;.<br />
<br />
I think You know what I would like to see us clerics strike on, right? Yes, of course, the Cleric armor quests (Stump Watch, Super Rare spawns, Lowest AC of all class specific armors though we are a plate based class). Think of the impact it would have if hundreds of clerics got together on this?<br />
<br />
How much action do You think it would be in the higher level dungeons if we did? I think I know the answer - None! No Greater Heals, Superior Heals or Complete Heals. No buffs, stuns, banish undeads and definately no Revives, Rescucitates or Ressurections!<br />
<br />
I know that this will probably never happend. The sit-in would take a lot of planning and so much could go wrong. Many clerics have claimed that they will never do these quests since they already have better armor. Others won't show up since they rather play the game than nag at Verant...<br />
<br />
... but if we could pull this off - boy, would it feel good!<br />

<br />
If an even like this ever took place, with REASONABLE demands being asked for, I would seriously consider attending, but I would not attend if the demands the organizers were making were simply unrealistic.<br />
<br />
I agreee, it would feel very good to see a &quot;peaceful demonstration&quot; take place, if only to bring together all of us in one place to &quot;bond&quot; as a class.<br />

I have absolutely zero interest in getting any of the cleric quest items, since they really arent worth it compared to other, easier to acquire items.  <br />
<br />
One possible demand could be that if we are to remain a plate-based class, they up the armor's AC.  Its pathetic to think that Rangers get more AC than we do.  Rangers are supposed to be restricted to light armor, so why is it they get more AC than we do?<br />
<br />
And, of course, the quests themselves just plain stink.  Stump watch is someone's cruel joke, at our expense. It's worth protesting just to get that changed.  Why is it I see so many Rangers, Bards, and Warriors running around with their FULL quest armor (those are just the classes that I know what their armor looks like, other classes could have as well) but I can count of one hand how many clerics I have seen with ANY piece of the armor.<br />
<br />
I work hard in this game for the few hours a week I get to play.  Let me know about a sit-in and I will be there (hopefully its on Mithaniel Marr).<br />

<br />
These quests are long and painful with little to no real reward. Its insane that Verant thinks we have so much time to devote to watching the ground. <br />
<br />
I personally haven't tried these quests based upon my experiences with the Testament of Vaner quest. I sat and stared at a wall for 8 hrs befor the guard spawned, and even then had to fight a KS'ing wizard for the kill. *Boggle wizard* don't know why he wanted it.<br />
<br />
On the upside I was able to watch 4 movies in that time.<br />

Pehaps we should make 1st level clerics on just 1 server to get a bigger demonstration instead of 5 on one sever 10 on another.<br />

The West Gate of Freeport would be a good Central Spot, somewhere away from the guards for the evil players.<br />

I am in, but only if we have a good leader that make sure this runs smoothly.<br />
I dont wanna participate in an event with demands I dont support.<br />
Demands are simple: <br />
Stats remain as they are. They are no different than all other quest armor, cleric quest armor has no lesser stats than any other quest armor.<br />
AC is upped so that we once again are a Plate class.<br />
Quests are changed so there are no more stump watch and 99% placeholders for our spawns. Move spawns onto regular spawns like many of the other quests armor are. SK armor is a good example. <br />

Maybe we could even form a guild so that we would have the use of guild chat.  All I ask is : it be done on a Friday, Saturday, or Sunday;  This not turn into a griping session, lets speak our piece and not bitch;  Treat whomever from Veriant (if they show) with the upmost respect;  And the Head GM of the server be alerted to our actions (you know when the big boss shows up he has to be a little nervous).<br />

Hey, I participated in the Monk Sit-in as I agreed with their agruements.<br />

Now let's see if we can get this thing rolling  http://www.kmrcs.com/eqcleric/ultbbs/ubb/smile.gif<br />

Less meaningless waiting would be a better statement, I believe. Also, I agree that the stat bonuses doesn't really need much change, it's the ac that is bad and unfair.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">GreenKnight</div><div class="date">11-25-1999, 04:36 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I've suffered through a number of the quests so far and gotten extremely lucky on a couple.  I have the boots, legs, arms, gloves and the cad. mace thing.<br />
<br />
Like many of you I've gotten fedup with the mindless, boring camping and would definately support a sit in provided as mentioned above the demands were reasonable and the sit in conducted in an adult fashion with no flames, whines, or outbursts of any kind.<br />
<br />
Looking at the equipment we can wear, this cleric only armor seems to fill a void between bronze and higher end mithral pieces.<br />
Alot of us had bronze in our early 20's.  By the time we hit the 40's we're working on mithral and other nice pieces.  The mobs I've killed seem to support the idea of you can get this stuff in your late 20's early 30's range.<br />
<br />
So now we need stuff that fits in between.  The current stats(excluding ac) on the stuff are fine with me.  Many of us are putting together different armor configurations to fit the need.  One favoring ac, and the other favoring wis/mana.<br />
<br />
I'd like to see the following changes.   1)Raise ac to fit with other classes      2)Increase the likelyhood of a mob to spawn.  I'm under the impression that bilge is a once every 2 to 3 week spawn from reports I've gotten.  God only knows the spawn rate of Zahal and Regis.  If I can obtain mithral bracers camping for a week (not to mention getting exp as well), then the cleric only ones should also be obtainable in the same length of time.  Otherwise, what's the point?<br />
<br />
I'll spread the word on the Rathe server and just keep checking here to see what day/time this event will take place.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Norin Grimsbane</div><div class="date">11-25-1999, 09:04 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Everyone, I will volunteer myself to help run this event.<br />
<br />
I believe since the oldest and most populus server is Fennin Ro, then Fennin Ro should be the host.<br />
<br />
Also, in order to maximize the number of people participating, then we should give at least 2 days to spread the word, to about one week maximum as we do not wish to stall any longer.  In this case, I feel the best times would be either Saturday evening (November 27), Sunday early to mid evening (November 28) or Friday evening (December 3).  Please fellow Clerics, let me hear your opinion on these dates.<br />
<br />
To establish a standard on our requests, I believe we should decide now.  Given the consensus on this thread, it seems that the number one request should be &quot;Obtainability&quot;;<br />
our armor requires us to camp mindless for hours (even days) waiting on spawns that have a very low chance of appearing.  Second is the Armor Class of our equipment, it is below that of the orginal rubicite and even below that of non-plate classes.  *These ideas result in the request that our armor be obtained reasonable and present us with a more impressive armor class.*<br />
<br />
I believe this covers all aspects of the event.  I plan to set-up a temporary website to display information on this event as well as distributing it to all the major news sites.<br />
<br />
I would like to thank everyone in advance for their interest in this, and I know will together can and will accomplish our task.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Domanic</div><div class="date">11-25-1999, 09:39 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I think 3 December would be best, a US Friday evening just before close of business say 6pm.  This gives players around the world a chance to participate (for example Australia is +17 Hours so that is 1pm on our Saturday).  People in the US possibly can leave work early on a Friday afternoon to make 6pm and it doesn’t mean that Verant Staff have to come in on their weekend to process our complaint.  <br />
<br />
I think the objective should be simple and to the point.<br />
<br />
1. Better Armour Class.<br />
2. Static Spawns that Drop the Quest Items, (no place holders)<br />
<br />
I have no problem with stump watch, it makes no difference if you are waiting for 7H 10M for an item to appear on the ground or a mob to appear to me.<br />
<br />
Once the date is set.  Someone needs to Contact SonyEQ and EQ Stratics to get it posted on their web pages as an Event.  We should also each send in an E-mail to Verant telling them about the event and that we plan to take place.  That way they will not be able to ignore us.<br />
<br />
Fennin Ro, West Gate of Freeport would seem a good spot to me.<br />
<br />
If we can get a guild created in time for the event maybe called (Clerics Vs Cleric Armour) or something witty if anyone has any imagination, it would make things a lot easier to run on the day.<br />

As well, I believe a time of 6PM PST should allow most people to participate.  For those of you in Europe, I realize this will be 3AM to 4AM in the morning for many of you (I believe), but if you can show up either later or earlier, it matters not, we just want you there.<br />

I've given this some thought and wrote the moderators on this site an email requesting them to help me out with details and coordination. As I think this sit-in might attract alot of people it takes some planning to pull off. But I'm glad You stepped forward and set this in motion!<br />

I'll mail You the same text I sent the guys here!<br />

I really think it's too soon to the monk's protest for this. Maybe if you had come up with something different, but to copy them so soon seems a bit ... I dunno, wrong maybe.<br />

If we get the raise in AC on our armor it will be some of the best pre planes equipment that we can get our hands on. Until You get ready for the bigger MOBs in the high level dungeons (SolB, Lower Guk etc.) I reckon You should at least be level 40, or so, to be able to survive the ordeal (I am probably wrong on this one, as usual). But I'll tell You - when You hit level 30 and You start fighting higher level mobs... Man... They hit HARD! You'll be glad You're wearing Your brand new cleric only armor (with the same AC rate as bards, shadow knights and Paladins, of course 8) and not the usual bronze or steel plate. Try throwing Your tank a heal in a tight spot - that &quot;big ugly&quot; WILL turn on You!<br />
<br />
But if You have an idea how we could protest and still attract Verants and other players attention - Please share it with us!</div></div><hr />

Well from what they say, if we are such a well balanced class, giving other classes chain armor with AC better than plate unbalances us, and in comparison makes us weaker.<br />

<br />
In the six hours I slept last night, we've had over 15 people register.  If we keep up the momentum, then be next Friday, we will have a large crowd there to show how much we care about the Cleric class.<br />
<br />

<br />
Glad to hear from you, and I look forward to hearing what you have to say.  I believe that we can all easily work together on this.  And getting the moderators here to help out is an excellent idea.  Let me know if there is anything else that I can do for you.<br />
<br />
Thanks all!<br />

I also agree that it needs to 'more interesting' to obtain. The items for the quests need to be put on NPCs that will at least gain you experience while you wait for them to spawn, not just a Stump Watch, or Cabin Watch, etc.<br />
<br />
One thing everyone seems to be missing, though, is that the cleric quests also give you no experience when you complete them. The experience you get should at least be equivalent to the experience you receive when you complete the crafted armor quests. IMO, this also needs to be on the list of demands.<br />

Don't worry Cam.  The demands are simple and reasonable.  We are not asking for an increase or change in the stats bonuses.  We are simply asking that the quests be made such that the armor is actually reasonably obtainable, and we also feel that the AC should be increased given that Clerics are a plate-wearing class.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Daia</div><div class="date">11-26-1999, 04:21 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, I would certainly participate as a Rathe representative and ask the other clerics in my guild to.  But I too have great pause that this event will be dismissed as another &quot;me too&quot; &quot;yeah and what else is new&quot; type of protest.  <br />
<br />
What made the monk protest unique is that it was first.  But now there's the necro protest.  We will be not the second, but the third class to do this.  Seems to lose it's political punch after a while.<br />
<br />
On the other hand the notion of a cleric strike is very inviting since I think that it would soon become clear that we were serious about our desire for reasonable change (I'm with Camalorn - if it's not reasonable change we're after I cannot suppot it.  My view of reasonable -- first and foremost, eliminate Stump/Cabin Watch 99.  Second, up, even just a little, the AC on our quest armor, or at least shift the stats.  They don't all have to be wisdom but some more strength or agility would sure be nice).<br />
<br />
So how about another alternative? What if we had a day where clerics would only group with other clerics? Different than a &quot;sit in&quot;, admittedly and without careful organization, planning, hard to make a show (since we may be spread out).  But it accomplishes the end of eliminating all cleric presence from those areas that truly need them.  Plus we get the advantage of not having to just &quot;sit&quot; if we don't want to.  We could all hunt newbie zones in bunches, thus making us visible but safe.<br />
<br />
I don't know if this is a good idea or not, but I do worry that we will not be taken seriously simply because we're the third.<br />

<br />
It is my honest belief that despite the Cleris being the third class to have sit-in, we will still have an effect.<br />
<br />
Clerics are the healers of Norrath, and even with great effort, shamans and druids could not take our place.  Therefore, if a great number of Clerics are all in one place at one time on one of the busiest EQ nights, then I feel that it will have an impact.  This also gives us a chance to insure that Verant has taken notice of our requests.  I am also open to other ideas, but as this has already been set into motion, I believe it is best to stick with it.<br />
<br />
Think of our gathering on Friday as more than just a sit-in.  And remember, the more Clerics that are there, the more the groups on our servers are going to miss us.  We will make a bigger difference the more we're missed as well.<br />
<br />
I understand your concerns Daia about being just a &quot;copy cat&quot;, but I also believe that with the right aspect on the situation and enough motivation, that it can be more than any sit-in that has come before us.<br />
<br />
Thanks for your participation.<br />

I will have my friends range from 20-50 http://www.kmrcs.com/eqcleric/ultbbs/ubb/smile.gif to announce this because i believe that if everyone wants a good cleric that they will want the best for us. I have been given money already to buy banded or ringmail.<br />
The demands sound sane and reasonable I do hope this stays under control.<br />
One idea I have is if anyone is on the Fennin Ro server could get anyone who can tele, cause' I would like to show up as an Erudite of which is what I am.<br />

<br />
Cleric Pilgramage from Freeport (or Kaladim) to Felwithe (hey we're lvl 1, can't make it too bad)<br />
<br />
Sit in around the place where a lvl 1 cleric is created instead of just at the gate in the newbie grounds - IE: make your character, move a little, scribe your spells and wait =)<br />
<br />
Sit in on the boat from freeport to butcherblock, with the event coordinator telling all three zones our woes.<br />
<br />
The two ideas involving the boats might not be so good with a large group (100+) all trying to zone at once, but I'm sure if the boat crashes that's one guaranteed way to get a GM there =)<br />
<br />
I'm not a cleric myself, but I have stayed with my friend Sonette (who is a cleric) for a week and a half in the ocean of tears waiting for gull skytalon.  That camp is just insane, even worse than babbi.  At least he's a timed spawn.  Probably about as bad as zahal/regis, cept if he pops at least werewolf hunters don't immediately kill him.<br />
<br />
Also, the enchanter quests DO give experence.  For completing my glowing mask I'd say I got maybe 1/8 or 1/4 or a bubble at lvl 25.  I also got FACTION with the temple.  Cleric quests should give REASONABLE experence (the crafted armor quests are a little overboard in my opinion, hence the flooding of gloves) and especially Faction with the temple for completing their quest.<br />

<br />
***NOTICE***<br />
Due to the extreme popularity of the Cleric Sit-In, the Sit-In will no longer only be held in West Freeport.  On the day of the Sit-In, as West Freeport begins to reach 150+ people in the zone, I would ask that you begin spreading about East Freeport and North Freeport.  Should all three of these zones become full, then begin to move into the Commonlands and the Desert of Ro.  Thank you for your cooperation in this matter as we wish to avoid crashing any zones.<br />

<br />
It would still work in with the current plans for the sit in, starting at the temple of Truth in Freeport and ending at the temple of Life in Qeynos.  Our 1st level dead bodies can litter the ground on the trail.<br />
<br />
When we die and zone back to Freeport we can start again leaving our fallen bodies as testimony to our sacrifice.<br />
<br />
Perhaps some established players on that servr can say in Rivervale and bind the players who make it that far?<br />
<br />
The only problem I see with a pilgrimage is how can the GM address the group if we are scattered across Antonica ??<br />

<br />
I like your suggestion about the pilgrimage, but as that would require a great change of plans (and some way to talk to the Verant Rep) we'll hold off for now.<br />
<br />
And twist on this idea that might work is later that night (or day for you international players) after the sit-in is over (and Verant has hopefully acknowledged our presence and cause), then those who still want to stick around can make the prilgrimage.<br />
<br />
I like these ideas of &quot;post&quot; sit-in activites.  Just remember to *please* wait till we have shown Verant how strong our numbers are before you decide to leave.  We don't want people just marching off without first succeeding in our goals.<br />
<br />
Thank you again everyone for your support. This event is going to be an exciting one to say the least.<br />

I'll be there, with friends. <br />
<br />
Erm, I'm suprised no one else has thought of this. After the sit in, should we be rebuffed, let us all as one... camp the stump.<br />
<br />
What better why to demonstrate our woes that hundreds of level one cleric bodies piled upon the stump of opression?<br />
<br />
Let's see how many bodies can pile up in the hours it takes for the the stump bag to spawn. If that isn't an appropriate protest I don't know what is.<br />
<br />
Hell, call the event &quot;StumpWatch&quot;.<br />

For now, I plan to arrive on Fennin Ro (I'm on The Rathe normally) at 6pm EST at Freeport for the sit in... with a new level 1 cleric (I'll make a gnome as I am and walk him there).  I will bring as many true clerics as I can find.  <br />
