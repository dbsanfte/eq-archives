<TEXTAREA NAME="EditedMessage" ROWS=10 COLS=45 WRAP="VIRTUAL">What VI really needs to do is wipe every old dungeon off the map and replace them with ones that actually make sense.

There are three reason that people will never play the game the way VI wants them to:

1) It is virtually impossible to consistently get a group of people from unrelated spots in Norrath, get them over to a dungeon you want to "do," get them organized, and then have all of 30 minutes of fun fighting your way through it, getting maybe one interesting drop and less experience than any of the players would have gotten soloing low blues.

2) There is no alternative place or mechanism to get 99% of the items in the game. If you want an SMR, there is one and exactly one place to get one. So why would you go anywhere else? You can get roughly equivalent items in some cases, but every single enchanter who wants to complete their epic is essentially obligated to sit in lower guk for weeks camping the Magus. Why the hell would that enchanter organize 12 different groups over 6 hours a day to "do" the dungeon instead of just sitting there and reading a book between spawns (or in many cases, asking the guild necros who now have nothing to do in Velious raids to go solo the spawn for a day).

3) If you try to do a dungeon, you will die. A lot. You will spend 15 minutes working your way down, someone will die, and then you will spend 6 hours doing CRs and refighting through rooms. Meanwhile the next group waiting at the platform to ride the Lower Guk ride is tapping their feet. yeah, right. They got tired and just fought their way past you, and are now begining the same multihour CR process in the next room because the mage's body fell through a wall.


I honestly can not believe that VI ever thought anyone would play this game "as they intended." Maybe up until level 20, when there are no dungeons with anything worth camping and most of the mobs still wander around.

All randomized loot did was move the lowest level camp site to the zone out area. Dungeons without the initial population to support the playstyle the game forces you into (anything old world except Lower Guk and SolB, most Kunark dungeons except for Sebilis, the non-city zones in velious) are all empty 90% of time and thus raid-oriented.

All I can say to VI is "Well, duh."

I can zone into Droga on any day of the week, any time, and I will tell you exactly how many people will be there. Three. Me, the guy farming the Idol of the Thorned, and the guy farming the Shroud of Nature.

I can zone into Solusek's Eye on any day of the week, any time, and I will tell you exactly how many people will be there. Ten. Me, the guy farming the Molten Cloak, a paladin trying to get Melatite, someone fighting the Solusek Priest or whatever his name is that drops an epic component, some farming imp skin gloves, and one level 25 player asking "Any exp groups here?" There will be four other people who are there after surviving a train in solb and zoning in for safety. They'll be gone in ten minutes.


I've posted this elsewhere, but I'll say it again because I am in absolute shock that VI keeps avoiding this:

 Dungeons in EQ are broken as designed. 
 Camping items is NOT fun.
 

What I do not understand is why dungeons, and lets use lower guk as an example, don't work like this:

You zone into Upper Guk, the thriving city of Frogloks. The greeter says "Hello %T, Welcome to Guk. The inn and markets are yonder, and then temple to (whatever paladin god the frogs worship. Has anyone ever found out who?) is down that way."

In the temple of $GOD, the Shin Lord says "Hello %T, I understand you are here because you want [a Ghoulbane|an SMR|money|$phatlewt] -- if you bring me some of the following items I will have the smiths and tailors of my people make you such in reward."

Having received this quest, you go down into the ruins of old guk to slay the horrid undead frogs. They drop numerous items which you take N number of back to the Shin Lord to prove your worth, he gives you $item.

No camping, no sitting in one place all the time. You can fight your way down to the Ghoul Lord, kill him, take his head back to the smiths of Guk and get your Yak.


Drop rate controls are stupid. They don't work over time, and they annoy the hell out of players.


Alternatively, if you are evil, you can wander down slaughtering the goody goody frogs of Guk, fight your way down to the Froglok King, take his crown and the Mithril Two Hander Plans from his smiths, and walk back to Neriak where you buy a large piece of mithril, find a player with high blacksmithing skill, give him the plans and the mithril, and he makes you a Mithril Twohander.

Want an FBSS? Bring me two scrolls of Swift like the Wind, five pieces of silk, two vial of mana that I can imbue with the spells, six small gems of certain types that I can use to hold the magic in the item, and two shadow wolf pelts -- wala, FBSS.

Sure, it took you 36 hours to find all that stuff, but you weren't sitting on your ass camping the Frenzied Ghoul the whole time, and any number of players can do this quest concurrently.


If players new that every time they "did" lower guk at least one person would get all the commonly dropped quest items they needed for something they wanted, then you actually would see six people getting together and "doing" the dungeon. There would be no point in sitting in the Frenzy room all week, because only one of the quest items for the sash dropped there, and it dropped all the time.

Any time the loot is static and sufficient enough to form a constant playerbase, you are never going to find anyone doing a dungeon unless the zone is just too difficult to survive in, in which case they're just going to raid it because a six person group would never survive anyway.

I suspect nothing I'm writing is sounding at all new to players, because we all figured this out days into the game.

So no, we are not playing the game the way VI intended, primarily because their "intended" playstyle is about the stupidest possible way to play their game.

Sorry for the ranting, but this has always been a sore issue for me. My intial playgroup in EQ basically fell apart because our Paladin wanted a Ghoulbane and we decided to "do" Upper Guk. A week later and a level lower, we all gave guk the finger and it's been next to impossible to get that group together to do anything ever since.
