Flash of light and Fear and Stun are what you want to land, followed by your DD.  Stun them over and over and over.

I have never dueled a druid, but that is what I would do fighting a druid mob.

Somehow they get that damn ensnare to land (eventually) and it's all downhill from there.  Is there nothing more frustrating than being rooted with stacked DoTs eating away your HPs?  I seem to be doing everythig right.  I'm well thought out is reguards to my spell line-up.  It's just that druids can switch thier tactics so fast, I fell extremely limited and unable to match them (unless it's melee....if a druid is stupid enough to let me get toe-to-toe, he's meat)  Even in melee, I've been surprised, given the Dmg Sheild and weapon procs.

I can say this mainly because I was never able to kill the bastard!<P>Just get your unbuffed MR/FR up over 90, knock his buffs off (most druids never bother with Jboots, so you'll end up with the speed advantage) and dispell and heal yourself till he's oom.<P>The only problem (thank goodness for me) is that unless the druid is a total gimp (not that uncommon actually) they can back out of the fight pretty easy.

EQ's PVP system is very bad and even Verant doesn't try to pretend otherwise. <P>EQ was meant to be a cuddly PVE game where everyone could all just get along. Instead, Verant has found out (and the other game companies thank them for it) that a full PVE world doesn't work. You need some element of PVP to satisfy some people, and to keep a certain amount of action-consequence in the game...eg allowing players to settle their own issues in the game, and dispense some justice when it's required. I know there's been plenty of times I wished I could just blast somebody (eg that quad-kiting druid who just dropped her mobs on my group, or the guy who tried to scam me in a trade).<P>Shadowbane is going to be a full-PVP world, but with PVP having potentially serious consequences in the form of bounties, bad reputation and becoming KOS to NPCs. Those who wish to be PKs can be PKs...but they can expect to be treated acordingly (eg unable to enter towns without risk, hunted down like dogs, etc.). DAOC is going to have similar features within its kingdoms, but PVP is going to be an important element in DAOC as kingdoms war against each other...I expect DAOC to be much like Tallon/Vallon Zek in that regard, and Shadowbane to be slightly more akin to Rallos Zek.<P>Hopefully these measures will help keep the grief PKs under control, and will also help cut down on the people trying to take unfair advantage...no one thinks anything about giving people grief in EQ because you know there's little they can do. In Shadowbane or DAOC, the person giving grief just may die for it. As it should be.<P>------------------<BR>Galavant Greenlabel<BR>M&M Brewing Company<BR>http://www.geocities.com/mirthandmayhem<BR>Rathe Server<P>"Judge not by size, but rather by spirit."</FONT></TD></TR></TABLE>
