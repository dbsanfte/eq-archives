The hp bar bounces all over the place now while stoning so you can't go by watching hp accurately unless you click real slow.  You also learn (usually the hard way :P ) to stop clicking the moment you get distracted.<P>Unless at zone-in I personally wouldn't use the faith/manastones to get mana back in a dungeon or even in the middle of an xp grind.  It'd be kinda inconsiderate.  I use it a lot tho (mostly to get to bank/sell/get someplace), enough to dread Verant doing what they did to the coterie mask of the dead: "Oops, you guys like this too much.  We intended it to have 5 charges!  Really!"  If a nerf must happen, hopefully it happens to the manastone and not the faithstone.

Then 4sec casting gate, 30sec zoneing TT, 30 zoning again SEB. And 10 seconds CoH.<P>Well...you would have regened enough mana to continue. If you have a mage in the group for CoH, ask him to spend the mana on a single mod rod #2 instead. With 3 minutes of medding and a mod rod 2, you should be pretty well off mana wise without all the hassle and leaving your group completely vulnerable.<P>------------------<BR><A HREF="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=20365" TARGET=_blank>Citra Dangermouse-60 ENC</A><BR><A HREF="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=20357" TARGET=_blank>Venerable Pilsburry Dangermouse-60 CLR</A><BR>Celestial Tomb<BR>VEESHAN</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#f7f7f7"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Quotison</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">I don't see how the port-manastone-gate back method could work unless you zone quick.

Manarobes are 3second.  3 to 4.5 second would probably be right, although 1 to 2 seconds would be nicer =).

I was stoning for mana, and he fell unconcious.  I hit him with a tiny heal while he was purple, he got back up and into the fight.  Managed to get enough mana to finish that fight out with no deaths. Without the manastone it would have been a wipeout.<P>Then, just a couple days ago we went after the rogue epic mob in steamfont.  We had a group of 5.  Started with me, (60clr) 50 rog, 48 war, 56 necro, 30 bard (who we met that night and came along for the ride.  This guy is amazing he kited for us and died 3x.  he is in the guild now.  <IMG SRC="http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/wink.gif">)<P>The warrior, rogue and necro died quick.  The bard kited while i stoned and resed the necro.  Then the bard died and I kited while the necro medded and the war and rog logged their mains and got to steamfont. <P>I died, and the wiz took over kiting.  Chanter arrived and tashed, then died.  I<BR>resed the chanter.  Wiz died. Chanter kited, pet beat mob, bard beat mob, I nuked, necro snared and dot'ed.  Wiz ran back, (he was bound close) started nuking.  He and chanter took turns kiting as aggro switched til she died.  <P>At a couple points, I was sure the rogue was going to have to start his epic all over again.  I dont know if this mob despawns, like some do, but she was certainly trying to wander away when she wasnt aggro'd on anyone. If I hadnt had the manastone, there is no way I would have had enough mana to res everyone back and heal and nuke during the fight. <P>We have also killed Verina Tomb for the chanters epic with myself (56 at the time) 55 chanter, 55 wiz and 40 rogue.  The fight took 3 tries before we wasted her, but I think the manastone would have changed that. <P>I can really see why they took this item out of the game and reintroduced a robe that clerics cant use.  This thing is very very powerful in the hands of a healer.  If you can get one, I highly recommend it.  Oh, and if you have a chanter partner, like I do, they can ToT you and you both gain benefit from the stone. <P>------------------<BR>Zzule D`Aemon<BR>High Priestess of Innoruuk<BR><I>Disciple of Hate</I><BR>Rallos Zek</FONT></TD></TR></TABLE>
