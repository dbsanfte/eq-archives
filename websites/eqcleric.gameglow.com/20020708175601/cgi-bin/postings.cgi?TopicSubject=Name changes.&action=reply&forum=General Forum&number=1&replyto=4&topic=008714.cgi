Or, you may have thought of a much cooler name during your travels through Norrath.  Now, as part of Sony Online Entertainment's continuing commitment to provide EverQuest players with the finest gaming experience on the web, SOE is pleased to announce a new, reasonably priced, character name change service.<P>You simply fill out SOE's form (which you use to request, for each character, a rename to an unused name on your server that complies with all of the terms and conditions of SOE's character naming policy) and SOE will charge you the applicable fee.  SOE may discontinue this service, without notice, at any time.<P>Legends Premium Server character renames will remain free. All other servers are eligible for this paid service.<P>Check out the EverQuest Live site (www.everquestlive.com) for more details.<P>---------------------------------------------<P>One thing I always liked about this game is the fact that your name is a fairly important feature.  If you do horrible things, they can come back and bite you in the bum.  But with the above offer, does this not seem to be a way out for those that have ruined the name they carry ?<P>I strongly dislike this myself, and I can't see the sense in doing this, except as a possible cash cow.<P>Thoughts ?

If someone has a bad rep changing the name alone is not enough to fool people.  Someone will figure out who the "new" person is either by there actions or equipment.<P>On the other hand, if you are selling a character you can now have the named changed so your old friends don't think version_02 of your toon is you.

You should be accountable for your actions, in game.<P>Now what this message doesn't say but I read over on castersrealm is that they will have a web form where you can enter a chars name and see name changes for that char and that's how they defend the reputation thing. Pretty lame I think. <A HREF="http://eq.castersrealm.com/viewarticle.asp?Article=4354" TARGET=_blank>http://eq.castersrealm.com/viewarticle.asp?Article=4354</A> <P>I for one don't really see the following happen:<BR>Char01 shouts, LFG!<BR>groupleader01 switches to his other computer and looks up Char01 on soe's fancy website and realizes that Char01 is in fact Plooter01 that looted that DRT way back in crushbone even though he didn't win the roll and promptly decides not to invite him into the group.<P>Imagine the possibilites..

Those of us who have been here 2+ years remember well the massive fights with Gordon "Abashi" Wrinn over even basic problems with the game. Abashi's philosophy was "If you don't enjoy EQ then you're not playing it right".<P>We all rejoiced when they woke up to the fact that we are paying customers and we understand the game better than many of those who made the game. It brought about sweeping changes where VI not only listened to us but even asked for our input.<P>Now the pendulum has swung the other way. Verant is caving in on issues they should not and giving us more money sinks. Legends was the tip of the iceburg. Now you can pay $49.95 to change one or all of your character's names. Now people can race through leveling, running average players over along the way, and when they've hit 60 and everyone on the server hates them... *poof* $49.95 and you have a new identity you can EBay, er, sell off to a new owner.<P>We need to learn money is the new dynamic here. Verant is literally selling out. Maybe VI instigated account trades are next (OSI already has a transfer-for-fee service for UO accounts). Then again, maybe buying pre-made level 60 characters is next. Who knows?<P>The only constant here is the love of money.<P>------------------<BR>Boanerges Thundercry<BR>High Priest of Prexus<BR><A HREF="http://www.cohort.cc" TARGET=_blank>Cohort Chalybeius</A><BR>Cazic Thule Server</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#dedfdf"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Agrippa</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Sir,<P>Absent the opportunity for profit, there would be no computers, no fancy graphics accelerators and certainly no Everquest.

Fortunately, it is fairly expensive.  <P>Should Verant make money off of character's changing hands?  Will that come next?  Hmmmm... I think they should never touch that one.  It's only a short step from selling existing accounts to selling prefabricated level 60 accounts.<BR></FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#dedfdf"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Boanerges</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">  <BLOCKQUOTE><font size="1" face="Verdana, Arial">quote:</font><HR>Originally posted by Agrippa:<BR><B>Sir,<P>Absent the opportunity for profit, there would be no computers, no fancy graphics accelerators and certainly no Everquest.

How is this any different from letting people escape their reputations for $49.95?<P>Verant should turn a profit. I think we can all agree on that. The question becomes at what point should Verant making a profit outweigh our right to enjoy the game? As I said, I can see "professional players" doing everything under the sun to boost their characters to 60 including things like training camps to gain desirable loot, killstealing, etc. Then they turn around, change the name for $49.95 and sell the account for $200 making over $100 in profits.<P>Let me give you another example. There was a recent grumbling over Verant handing out free accounts and implying characters roll up twink clerics, druids and/or wizards. Now, imagine Verant offers accounts with a level 60 cleric on them for, say, $150. Want them decently equipped (wearing full PoG and other various items)? Tack on another $150. And the kicker, with epic tack on another $100. So to buy a fully equipped cleric with epic from VI will cost you $400.<P>How does that negatively impact me? My character, with all my /played time can now be bought for $400. It means that, essentially, my character is worthless because to get most of what I have now can be reduced to a dollar value.<P>I am not saying the name change will destroy the game or that Verant should not make money. I am saying that I hope this is not a slippery slope where time invested becomes meaningless in the face of money.<P>------------------<BR>Boanerges Thundercry<BR>High Priest of Prexus<BR><A HREF="http://www.cohort.cc" TARGET=_blank>Cohort Chalybeius</A><BR>Cazic Thule Server<p>[This message has been edited by Boanerges (edited 06-11-2002).]</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#f7f7f7"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Morlife</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><BR>Bottom Line here guys is ...

You picked a stupid name you'd regretted for months, and now you have the chance to change it.  It's like the cosmetic surgery you've alwasy wanted.  Then again, for the Iamsnot and Melikepanties characters out there, VI should have been considering changing their names anway.  But, what do you expect from a company who's filtering software doesn't let you hear someone saying "Incoming: a stongazer cockatrice" because cockatrice is a potential "bad word?"<P>Over all, I don't like it.   A great many things change about your character as you play: clothing, weapons, even your face.  Your name is the only thing that sets you apart from everyone els ein this game -- at least appearance-wise, since everyone plays differently.  As many have mentioned, your name holds your reputation, for good or ill.  I don't want to have to look people up on a web site to see who they are in-game.  That's just too bogus.<P>The ad iteslef for the service is annoying, too.  It's all sugary and sweet.  It's the Stranger with Candy voice ment to entice you to mindlessly buy their product.  I felt disgust while reading it.<P>If VI really wanted to help players customize their characters, they would make it easier (ie possible in most cases) to change your surname.  It seems to me that your surname was supposed to be the part of you you can customize to show how your grown as a character.  <P>I, for one, haven't taken a surname because I dont' feel I have anything too unique to label about myself.  I would definatly if I grandmastered a tradeskill, did or liked something special in the game, or -- pipe dream time -- was allowed to choose some special alternate skill/whatever that would further define my character.  (I've always thought allow a character to pick up one or two alternate skills would be cool.  Not like AA stuff, but something like being able to train in on skill you couldn't in, like foraging or poison or bash, or raise the cap on one skill you had, like swimming or dodge.  And make it available at level 20, when you are able to pick a surname.  I'd pick swimming... but I digress.)<P>Sanctu<BR>Master Swimmer (200)<BR>39 High Elven Cleric of Tunare<BR>Seventh Hammer Server</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#f7f7f7"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">SleepyBhr</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Fnord duplicate post.<p>[This message has been edited by SleepyBhr (edited 06-11-2002).]</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#dedfdf"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Ambul Ants</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Call me cynical but there are already plenty of accounts for sale.

I just lost 20 minutes of composition by mistyping my user name.<P>Suffice to say, Boanerges, that I think your points are valid and hard to argue with.  I must take issue, however, with your assertion that the value of your account will be reduced in the event that Verant decides to sell ready-made pre-leveled and equipped characters.  While one might be able to purchase a 60th level cleric with an epic weapon and great equipment, no one will be able to buy 100+ days played for $400 in a 30 second transaction.  The lionshare of the value of, for example, your character is in the experiences you've had as opposed to the items you own.  I think that if you consider that you chose to build (I am assuming here, but I think I can do so safely) your character when you could have easily purchased a ready-made 60th level cleric, you will see that you agree to some extent with this point.  The value is in the journey rather than any particular item.<P>Agrippa<BR>Rodcet</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#dedfdf"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Bennan</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Interesting posts, thanks for the link to that bit about being able to look up character names.
