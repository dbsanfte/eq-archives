Just the thought that it will probably take me several hundred or even a thousand or more hours to get up high enough to do things like Planes Raids fills me with a terrible malaise.<P>What do you do to keep the game interesting??<P>Euboa</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#f7f7f7"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Dalur - Veeshan</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Hrmmm<P>That's a hard question to answer.  For me I like the thrill of levelling up and getting more points (hp & mana) and being stronger and being able to go to new places (with less chance of dying) and all that kinda stuff.<P>Prior to playing visual online games, I used to play a MUD game where basically all you did was level up and go do a few quests and get equipment and hang out with out people in a text environment.  I was a big time leveller and ended up with the highest level with the highest number of hp and that kinda stuff.  It gave me a sense of satisfaction in building up the strongest character in the game.  The last time I checked, he was still the biggest and strongest character.  <P>I guess it all boils down to the individual playing.  If you don't enjoy the repeated "kill, med and rinse" routine, this game may not be for you.  It's not for everybody.  A big part of this game is killing things to attain a new level.<P>------------------<BR>Dalur Stouthealer<BR>53rd Dwarven Vicar<BR>Veeshan Server</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#dedfdf"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Suesc</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">I keep coming back for the people.

Some people like to to sit southwest corners of dungeons and watch fungus grow. Other like to keep moving through dungeons. Others like to do quest or draw maps or lead dragon raids or run guilds etc... <P>My roomate like to chitty chatter and could care less about power leveling.<P>I personally like exploring running aimlessly for hours <- sad but true :/ but what I like the most about the game is when I am in really good party and we get jumped by overwhelming odds - certain death is on us and we all pull together and ride it out. We end the fight everyone is OOM the tanks are at 30% health , cleric took a beating etc.. and right at end battle we invs up with last bit mana to escape the next wave mobs. Thats exciting.<P>I know some people who get a lot of fun out of engineering trains and watching people die. They say adds excitement to the game - what do I know - it's there game too.<P>There is always going to be certain amount of grunt work in the game - ther no getting around that. Do what you like that is fun and when the game is no longer fun - quit and find something else that will keep you amused for while.<P>Dorad Clericus</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#dedfdf"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Cathawk</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">For me it's the people and my guild.

I took one week of vacation and spent the whole time playing EQ and leveling as fast as I could.<P>However, the people are more important to me.  I think I do a /who all ???? constantly during the game.  I'm always looking for friends and talking to people.  So much so, that at times I have received a tell from someone before my screen pops up after logging on.  The first 30 minutes of being logged on is usually filled with talking with people (in tells or in guild chat) and deciding what I want to do for the evening.<P>Last night, for example, I think I killed one thing all night long that I got exp off of.  I spent the rest of the night running around with a friend, trading items and helping him finish a quest.  Also, checked on a rare spawn to see if it was up.  I had one of the best nights I've had on the game last night and exp was the lowest priority on my list.<P>Now, with that said, I have a raid that I will be on tonight.  I will hope to get lots of experience and maybe some decent loot.  But my routine for the evening, I'm sure, will be to heal, buff, med... maybe stun a few times and even a couple of debuffs.  And if the raid goes as most raid do, for me, there will be plenty of joking around and a good time will be had by all.<P>It does take time to develop friends in the game.  I think I was lucky and developed a good number of them early on and have maintained them.  I am continuing to gain friends as I am growing into the upper levels.  But, more than anything else, the people are what keep me coming back to the game time and time again.<P><P>------------------<BR>Sadara Raincaller<BR>40th High Elf Cleric<BR>Follower of Tunare<BR><A HREF="http://home.kscable.com/companions" TARGET=_blank>Companions of Honor</A><BR><A HREF="http://www.brellserilis.net" TARGET=_blank>Brell Serilis</A></FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#f7f7f7"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">chrisstauf</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">I would say that the best thing I ever did was to join a guild.

No offense, but it only gets worse the higher you get.. <P> Most of the clerics on raids have to sit facing the wall just to make sure they don't get lagged out.. <P> and unless you want to do what i do(and it is SLOW going) which is soloing.. be prepared for a boring career(if you like doing what clerics do, it isn't boring, but if you don't like the buffing/healing then it is boring)  So, it sounds to me like it is time to switch classes, no offense.. <P> I feel for you, because I got to 30+ before I realized I hate being a cleric, and now ALL my friends are 50+.. I'm still only 40th because I play about 10 different characters to keep from getting bored.. <P> My only other advise is.. <P> GET A TV and VCR real close to the computer, and go pay off all the overdue fines on your blockbuster card.. get into a party, watch a movie.. heal some folks and get some experience  <IMG SRC="http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/wink.gif">  <P>------------------<BR>Vfelia D'var<BR>Tunare<BR>http://www.clericsofhate.com<BR>http://www.eqstuff.com</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#f7f7f7"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Whackem Smackem</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Yeah, watching movies/reading helps...

For me what it comes down to is the friendships.  After the initial exploration, EQ is basically a fairly dull game except every once in a while when you can do something really new or pull off something dangerous.  But most of the time is spent waiting or doing something fairly safe and repeatitive.  <P>So, when I think about quitting, I realize that I would really miss my friends and the few new things I am doing, but would not miss the game itself all that much.  <P>In terms of keeping it interesting, I honestly believe that clerics have a pretty nice amount of variability.  Lots of people (including lots of clerics) think it is just a heal, buff and med routine.  I haven't found that to be true for me.  I have played a druid and a cleric to high levels and, while I like both, prefer my cleric for his adaptablility and his importance.  While druids have a easy time soloing and can offer some nice group abilities, they only have one technique for dealing with problems (running away, in various forms).  Clerics, on the other hand, just start getting interesting when everything goes to hell.  Plus clerics are generally vital to a group while druids are just a nice-to-have.  <P>What you can do: try different roles as a cleric (but let your group know what you are doing).  While heal/buff/med works great, so does stun/heal/buff/med - and often keeps you busier and with less total down time.  Also, clerics are often the best choice for crowd control if there is no enchanter in the group (enstill and/or atone).  Clerics can also taunt and (thankfully) anti-taunt.  Very useful in the right place.  You can solo too - all the way up to 50+.  Actually the teens and low 20's are the hardest.  Once you get 29, soloing is easy, occasionally interesting, and a nice change of pace if you get tired of the heal/med routine.  <P>------------------<BR>Squamos Furioso<BR>52 cleric of Rodcet Nife<BR>Tunare server</FONT></TD></TR></TABLE>
