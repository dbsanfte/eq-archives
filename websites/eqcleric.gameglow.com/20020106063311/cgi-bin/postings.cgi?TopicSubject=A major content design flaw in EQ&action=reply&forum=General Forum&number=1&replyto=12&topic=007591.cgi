Spell drops were balanced accordingly.<P>When Velious was release, casting classes got new spells, but most were not that cool. Now we suddenly had two continents for 50+ xp. And melee loot, as usual, got a huge boost in power in Velious, while casters still have to go to Kunark for spells.<P>Luclin introduces the same situation a third time. Now we get a 3rd expansion with even cooler loot, some new spells (most rather silly in my opinion but I'm sure some are quite nice). But we STILL need to go to Kunark for Kunark spells, and Velious for Velious spells, while the melees can happily get all the nifty stuff from Luclin, since they automagically get discs when they level.<P>The effect: its getting increasinly harder to obtain the Kunark dropped spells. <P>There are many solutions to this problem:<P>- Verant could simply label Kunark a legacy area and throw us a bone by putting all Kunark spells on merchants.<P>- Simply increase Kunark spell drops. Velious spells are, I might add, less of a problem since they generally drop more. <P>- Verant could put Kunark spells on merchants to make it a bit easier for us, and instead pull slightly improved Kunark spells on the Kunark dragons / bosses. I like this idea myself.<P>- Verant could random spells across several continents, so that we can get Velious spells in Kunark, Kunark spells on Luclin, etc.<P><BR>Please feedback this issue if you agree.<P><P>------------------<BR>Mirixia L`Elamshinae<P>Cleric of Innoruuk<BR>Vallon Zek</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#f7f7f7"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Dalur - Veeshan</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">I agree that the spell drops are rediculous.<P>I've been 60 for quite a while and I think I'm still missing 3 or 4 of my 51 - 60 spells.<P>------------------<BR>Dalur Stouthealer<BR>60th Dwarven High Priest<BR>Veeshan Server</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#dedfdf"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Quotison</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">I think they should place all these 51-60 spells on all the 51-60 mobs in the game... no matter what the contient.

I think that depending on a mobs level in kunark, he should drop that spell, or lower, with same possibility of drop rates from a L51-L60 spell (in other words on a L60 spell roll a dice 0-1000 - 0-100 drop a L51, 101-200 drop a L52, etc.  On a level 53 mob for instance, roll a dice 0-300, 0-100 = L51, 101-200 = L52, and 201-300 = L53), and so on.  This would actually DECREASE the number of L51-L54 spells which (I dont know about your server but...) are insanely common, and increase the L55-L60 spells which are insanely rare.<P>As for the comment on the Shaman spells, I agree with.  Shaman spells practically never drop in kunark OR velious.  We got 6 celestial healings before we got one spirit quickening.<P>As for the overall balance with Melee I also agree.  The big suck imo is that when a melee gets an upgrade, they can sell their item.  When we get an upgrade spell, we can't sell our old one.  Thats why when a melee auctions MoK for 15k, it makes me sick.<P>Aladain</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#f7f7f7"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Twinskey Bab0linskey</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">It's funny, when I first started playing EQ it was the melee's complaining they had to buy their gear from the casters.<P>I'm missing almost all my spells, I think the only droped one's I have are Aego, MoK, Stun Command and Trepidtion (which isn't really a drop spell)... but I really don't care.

A level 60 cleric for quite a long time, and I am still missing 2 of my Kunark spells, of which I have seen only one of them drop one time.. The other one I haven't seen it drop at all... This is after several jugg raids, trak raids, and chardock royal raids.  It seems the Jugg raids dropped a ton of mage spells, and some of the other classes spells, excluding shammies and clerics. Many of a night I spent 6 hours in Juggs to see one cleric spell drop, even while doing the protector.<P>I don't think there is anything wrong with having dropped spells, but they should be to where every caster has a chance at them.. Many casters, may belong to small guilds, and organizing a Royals raid, or major dragon raid is out of the question without outside help.. and we all know how difficult that can be.. try and do that now with Luclin out, and say we are doing Gorenoire or Trak so I may get a rare spell.. haa!.. good luck. <BR> <BR>The other thing many people forget to notice is on these large raids there may be as many as 6 clerics all needing the same spell.. so lets see a 1 in 6 chance, on a spell that has terrible odds of dropping to begin with,.. not the best odds. <P>My 2 cents worth.. the spell drops need to be more frequent and easier to obtain.. end of story.. <P>Dusklar  60th High Priest of Prexus</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#dedfdf"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">electrae</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">You should post on safehouse as well.

Personally I have only seen Sont drop the 60 kunark spells (no 58-59 ones that I remember, just 60) and have not seen Kunark spells drop on any of the other dragons.  Maybe I just haven't hunted WW enough lately though (entirely possible).<P>Sont is however a very nice source of the Cleric and Necro Kunark spells, seems to drop those the most commonly.When we dropped Sont last night he had 2 Word of Restoration, Divine Intervention, and like 4 other spells, at least one being a necro Kunark spell.  In previous kills we got Banishment of Shadows twice and 2 other copies of WoR.  Divine Intervention last night dropped me down to only needing 3 more spells to complete my pre-Luclin spellbook (Banishment of Shadows, Unspoken Word, and Enforced Reverence).  I know clerics who have been offering tons of plat for those 3 for months and still don't have them, this is just stupid IMO.<P>If they don't want non-Luclin people to have access to the dropped Luclin spells fine, but at least make Kunark drop spells drop off anything 51+ in Kunark, the state it's in now is just stupid, they upped drops to a degree but not nearly enough and the spells still do not drop in a balanced fashion, some are incredibly more rare than others, this needs to be reviewed.<P><P>------------------<BR><A HREF="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=14796" TARGET=_blank><B>Ceridwen Elay</B></A><BR><B>High Priestess of Tunare</B><P><BR><B>Arianwen Taur`amandil</B><BR><B>53 Wanderer</B><P><I>Prophecy</I><BR>Bertoxxulous<P>"<I>If dreams are like movies, then memories are films about ghosts</I>"  --Counting Crows</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#dedfdf"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Pacemaker</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">I got most of my Kunark spells in Veeshan's Peak.
