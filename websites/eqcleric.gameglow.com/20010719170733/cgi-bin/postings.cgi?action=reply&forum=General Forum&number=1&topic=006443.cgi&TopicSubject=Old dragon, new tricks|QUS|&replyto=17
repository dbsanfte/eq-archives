Supposedly, after killing everything in Sleeper's Tomb he heads to Skyshrine and wipes out the zone and then moves to ToV where he kills everything there as well.

The Sleeper is supposed to cause a gigantic change in the game world that Verant isn't ready to go through with yet...for lack of coding or whatever reason.<P>I halfway wonder if the Sleeper isn't Verant's mechanism that they have in place for taking down servers permanently when the time comes...the world-ending monster to end all monsters. Given that DAOC and SB aren't too far in the future, the time for EQ to start shrinking and for servers to get condensed may be coming...when underpopulated servers get merged and the number of servers is reduced.<P>The end of an MMOG.

Here is what happend...<P>We were fighting the 4th warder (ventani) and had it down to 60% or so when kerafyrm spawned, and wiped us out. Kerafyrm then killed the 4th warder.<P>Roughly 15 minutes laster, GM Valdelmar comes in and has this to say.<P>[Tue Jun 05 00:37:10 2001] Valdelmar shouts, 'Everyone that is in this zone, has a corpse in this zone, or was involved in the invasion of this zone is receiving a warning for Exploitation.'<P>Now this is where it gets good. When asked what exactly we exploited, here was the answer:<P>[Tue Jun 05 00:44:50 2001] Valdelmar tells you, 'We witnessed your clerics below the bridge keeping the warders agro by complete heal so that the tanks could safely kill. That's exploitation'<P>Now, anyone who plays the high EQ game or has a reasonable knowledge of EQ game dynamics knows that this completly IMPOSSIBLE to exploit.<P>The mobs summon ability negates this exploit 100%. If the clerics are top on aggro list, they get summoned up from below the bridge, and killed nearly instantly. The mob was on ME (the warrior) the entire battle, besides when it decided it was mad at my clerics - which is when it killed them in no time flat. In fact, if you look at the first screenshot in yesterdays update:<BR> <A HREF="http://eqconquest.inet.net.nz/img/news/st1.JPG" TARGET=_blank>http://eqconquest.inet.net.nz/img/news/st1.JPG</A> <P>You can clearly see that I am stating that the REASON WE LOST is because the clerics gained too much aggro and were killed, and that I am saying that in order to win, we have to clerics aggro less than my own (so he stays on the tank).<P>We've all been playing this game for years now... To be treated like this was basically a slap in the face. We had a LIGIT tactic to take down the 4th warder, and verant suspends us over some BS exploit that isnt even possible to execute.<P>Why? Because we showed the playerbase that the sleepers script was STILL not finished like they said?<P>Dunno, but I urge every one of you to please take the time to email verant and back us up on this.<HR></BLOCKQUOTE><P>------------------<BR>Boanerges Thundercry<BR>Erudite Templar of Prexus<BR>Cohort Chalybeius<BR>Cazic Thule Server</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#dedfdf"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Dalain</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">speculation from my servers msg board *shrug*<P>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<BR>Well, further reading in the post indicates that they had corpses that Clerics would continously rez. <P>Normally, coming back with 40% health and a (non-verified) 5% slowdebuff is usually BAD, right? <P>But what if you are fighting a mob that casts a 70% slow...and what if that slow doesn't STACk with rezz effects...and what if your tank is hurt to BELOW 40% health anyways...and what if you have clerics chain-casting rezzes on a tanks corpse... <P>See where this leads? <P><BR>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<P>Assuming something like that was occuring, I can see why VI would consider that an exploit. *shrug*  <P>Dalain<P>PS I normally wouldn't get involved in this at all but this post intrigued me, since I've never been to sleepers I have no idea if that's the effect of the 4th warder or whatnot.

Verant would be very happy for people to awaken the sleeper as often as possible.  They were banned for using several exploits, such as the z-axis expoit to keep their clerics from being summoned.  Not only did they use the exploits, but they bragged about it before and after the event.  Not too smart.<P>Of course, what you're seeing on all the boards is a proclamation of innocence on the part of the guild.  They present logs to support their side, with huge gaps that they claim are "not relevant".  Verant is usually reluctant to comment on discipline issues, but they have posted something on the EQ web site.

Verant has a statement concerning this on their forum page that states that the primary target was in range only 25% of the time due to the "z-axis".  As hard as these mobs hit, most falling damage would be trivial by comparison.</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#f7f7f7"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Falconquick</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Update: Then, Brad McQuaid said:<P>On June 4th, 2001, SOE banned and/or suspended 28 players belonging to the guild Conquest. Plainly put, they were cheating, we observed them cheating, they knew they were cheating, they admitted they were cheating, and they got caught.<P>While SOE does not want to spoil the game by releasing full details of the cheats to all players, basically the 28 Conquest players were (among other things) purposely using world geometry, aspects of the hate list, the "z" coordinate and its nullification of NPC's ability to summon, and multiple atmospheres (e.g. water/land) to arrange dragon-type encounters so they could attack without getting hit back for the vast majority of the time that it took to kill the monster. In short, what they did was carefully orchestrate 100,000+ hps encounters so that, for 75% or more of the time that it took to kill the encounter, the monster got beaten on and was not able to fight back.<P>In addition, SOE staff observed various members of the guild discussing the cheating -- these comments include:<P>"we're useing [sic] massive amounts of exploits and u send a gm down here?"<P>"Any lead GM shows up, this show is over."<P>"yeah, this is the most impressive Itz-guyversploit [sic] to date"<P>"every guild exploits these"<P>The EverQuest Rules of Conduct state, among other things: <P>"You will not exploit any bug in EverQuest and you will not communicate the existence of any such exploitable bug (bugs that grant the user unnatural or unintended benefits in game), either directly or through public posting, to any other user of EverQuest. You will promptly report any such bug via the in-game /bug command or via the eqtesting@verant.com email address."<P>"Disciplinary issues involving guilds will also be addressed on a broader basis. Guilds whose members habitually violate any of the Rules of Conduct . . . may be disbanded."<P>As a result of this unfortunate incident, (i) most of the participants were suspended for one week, (ii) a few, who had received previous warnings or suspensions, were banned, and (iii) this guild has been disbanded.<P>SOE regrets having to take these measures, but SOE is committed to protecting the health and viability of the game and of the EverQuest community. We'd also like to correct a few related misconceptions regarding this event: (i) Conquest did not complete the encounter - SOE staff inadvertently spawned the Sleeper during its efforts to stop the cheating, (ii) the "human figures" in some screenshots are a result of the screenshot taker not patching, and (iii) the zone is complete and working -- once SOE has patched fixes to these exploits we encourage players to wake the Sleeper.<P>We appreciate everyone's emails with regards to questions and we do hope this will assist everyone in an understanding of the situation.<P>-The EverQuest Customer Service Team<P>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<P>Hmmm. I wonder what happend to:<P>It is our policy not to discuss disciplinary actions taken on players with other players. These actions are considered confidential and we only will communicate directly to those players involved in the incident.<P>I am sorry that we will not be able to answer question on this issue.

Going forward, however, we are changing this policy: we will continue to respect customer (and former customer) privacy to the extent that we'll not talk about specific individual's, their names, character names, private communications between them and us, etc. <P>If, however, an event like this one (multiple bannings/suspensions) comes under the public eye, we will (at our descretion) post a general statement regarding this issue such that it's at the very least 'our word against their's' as opposed to 'their word against silence'. <P>-Brad<BR>Check more of the story at <A HREF="http://www.mobhunter.com" TARGET=_blank>www.mobhunter.com</A> </FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#dedfdf"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Aaldiana D'Ozz</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">PS...VI is full of it.  Mobs summon on the Z-axis just fine.  They summon out of water just fine.  They continue to even melee on the Z-axis just fine.<P>The ONLY thing that might be considered an exploit that I've gathered from this whole thing (though I'm sure there is still some info not being stated) is using a rez as a way to save/heal someone from battle as well as using rez effects to avoid the slow effect of the warders AE.  And I find it funny the exploit they were banned for was obviously not even working well given they had LOST to the warder twice trying it. (As per their own statement.)<P>The exploit here seems to have far less to do with Sleepers in specific and more to do with  battle rezzing in general.  I think too many people have become hung up on the fact that the Sleepers zone was involved and not on the admitted "tactics" so far revealed.<P>I do have a concern though that as an overall "fix" to this, rez itself will be somehow changed.  Much shorter duration on the rez confirm box (which would really be annoying coupled with that stupid missed-box bug still around), the ability to only rez a body once, or godforbid a nerf on the epic like adding some sort of HUUUUGE assed cast time or reagent cost or something.<P>My 2cp anyway  <IMG SRC="http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/wink.gif"><P>------------------<BR><A HREF="http://eq.castersrealm.com/players/view_profile.asp?Id=10222" TARGET=_blank>Aaldiana Fior'Cron</A><BR>Level 59 Cleric of SIN*<BR><A HREF="http://clubfu.vestergren.nu/" TARGET=_blank>Club Fu</A><BR>Bristlebane Server<P>*Sweet, Innocent & Naive...with the halo to prove it</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#f7f7f7"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">kitsinu</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Don't mention reagent costs for the epic effect.
