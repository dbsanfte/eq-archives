<TEXTAREA NAME="EditedMessage" ROWS=10 COLS=45 WRAP="VIRTUAL">I guess we all have different strategies and ideas of what  the "best" healing method is...so, here is mine.

I got into a heated debate with another cleric one night because I was using greater heals and superior heal, rather than complete heal (like she thought I should). Actually, she made me feel so stupid, I almost left to hunt with another group.

 There were 2 of us clerics and one tank.  He was doing his job *smacking* the mobs around while pre-fight buffed him and then  kept him healed.  I would throw in a few roots and/or stuns to help the battle a bit, but basically, I kept back at a distance and kept him healed.

Once in a while I threw in a wrath or smite to speed the battle along or help finish the mob off if our tank was tiring or I knew it was time for another mob to spawn in our room. 

Well, this other cleric told me I was doing it ALL WRONG!

I was supposed to jump right in with my mace and help him pound away.  Then, when he got to 1 bub of health, cast complete heal on him.  "More mana efficient" she explained to me in lecture detail.

My defense of my battle strategy was this: 

 If my tank gets to 1 bub health, he is gonna be slower, tired and his fighting skills drop. (tell me if this is wrong). 

 Also, he is going to be in big trouble if another mob spawns in our room (or a train wanders by)and whacks him before I get complete heal off.  

Also, if another mob suddenly jumps me, the chances of me getting a complete heal off on him (or any heal at this point) is very iffy.

Anyway, to keep her happy, I changed my battle strategy and pretended to be a tank for the night (even though it really went against the grain)

NOW-- if I am in a large group, no way would I use this strategy of hers.  No matter how mana efficient it seems to be!

If I have 6 people down in Lower Guk and I do a little rooting/atone/stunning, I am going to find mana dropping.  

I am going to see everyone in the group's health dropping.  I throw in some greater heals or superior heals (depending how mana is and how many people need healing)  I try to keep everyone in the group at least to half health at all times.  I want them unstunned and able to blast/kill/run at will.

I try not to be a tank.  The first time I throw out a complete heal, the mob is on me.  All of them.  So, now you have me in a big battle myself with a mob(s), (remember, she said to use that mace) I can't get a heal off on anyone and half the group was down to 1 bubble.  People are gonna die :-(.

So, after this long tirade (hmm, maybe I am on wrong board).... am I doing wrong?

If you are my tank (or in my group), do you want me to let your health drop low and then complete heal or keep you kicking  with greater heals/superior heals throughout?

What do the rest of you do?
