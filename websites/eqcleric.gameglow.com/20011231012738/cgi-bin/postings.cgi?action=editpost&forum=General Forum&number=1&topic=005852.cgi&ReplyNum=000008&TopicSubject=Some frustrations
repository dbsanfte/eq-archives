<TEXTAREA NAME="EditedMessage" ROWS=10 COLS=45 WRAP="VIRTUAL">Tarf,

Wonderful post!  Thanks for all the input.  I feel the reason many clerics were ignored in the past is because a large number of them posted things on the class balance thread that were unreasonable.

Heres what I see and why - some of these I'm going to post up, some I might not, would be very interested in everyones opinions though   :)

Aladain.


Reasonable Changes
==================

---------------------------------
Standard med rates while standing
---------------------------------
We are the only class in the game that has absolutely no form of mana regeneration faster than just medding.  Given that any caster class and priest class is very dependent on their mana ESPECIALLY in the post 50/55 game, we all should have a fair mana regenration rate.  I would think clerics, above all classes, have mastered the art of prayer and meditation, and should by level 50 or so be able to meditate and pray under nearly any situation.  Not asking for clarity, nor clarity 2, just standard med rates - anytime, running, sitting, or standing.

Below is format - Class: Spell/item (Extra Mana regen-Health taken) for their mana regen capabilities.  A "t" next to number means per tick.

Enchanters: Clarity (6t-0); Clarity II (11t-0)
Mages: Mod Rods (125-250)(And the one caster class that isn't totally dependent on their mana provided a pet is up)
Necro: Lich (20t-32t)
Wizard: Harvest (L34: 171mana L60: 301 mana-0)
Shaman: Canabalize (28-50), Canabalize II (33-67), Canabalize III (38-75)
Druid: Form of the howler (2t-0), Spirit of Oak (4t-{Increases Health Regen by 2t}), Mash of the Hunter (3t-0), Protection of the Glades (6t-{Increases Health Regen by 2t}).

---------------------------
Group Armor Class Buff (AC)
---------------------------
I assume the only reason Verant doesnt add this is because of stacking reasons with casters shielding line, and shaman self buffs.  I tend to agree, however, feel as though a group SoW or group BoF in replacement of the level 54 pet (the spell doesnt have to be added at 54.  57 or 58 is fine in the case of BoF) would be a much more welcome addition to clerics.  AC buffing is a killer.

------------------------
Aegolism as a Group Buff
------------------------
Mana of this needs increased from 750 to 1500, and use 1 peridot as component, but a buff that would hit the whole group.  Again I assume they didnt because of the AC buff part and stacking issues, but if clerics are to be the king of buffing, and I get turned down for this spell routinely, then there is something wrong.  Mana regen might be viable as this is a buff from the gods so powerful, it warrants such a thing - although this won't happen.

------------
Invisibility
------------
Gods can render us invulnerable, but they can't make us unseen?  Clerics need, and deserve Invisibility.  Especially with wizards getting invisibility to undead, clerics should get invisibility.  There is absolutely no reason for this.

Bard: Invis song
Cleric: Undead Only
Druid: Camo/Sup Camo/Improved Sup Camo
Enchanter: Invis AND Invis Undead spells
Magician: Invis AND Pet Invis spell
Monk: Sneak
Necro: Gather Shadows (Invis)
Paladin: No Invis (And they shouldn't)
Ranger: Camo
Rogue: Sneak / Transparent Mask
Shadow Knight: No Invis (And they shouldn't)
Shaman: Invis
Warrior: Invis on Cobalt Greaves (They shouldn't have this)
Wizard: Invis AND Invis to Undead (Added with Velious)

---------------------
New Healing Structure
---------------------

The easiest way to eliminate complete heal as an imbalance.

I think this would give clerics a NICE way to make strategy.  I would love to have a structure like this to get out of the standard Remedy / Complete Heal / Divine Light combo we all have at level 53.  This would give us a lot of complexity.

I put some thought into the below, but some might not be perfect (some might be more efficient earlier than others), but you get the idea I'm getting at.  Pay CLOSE attention to the cast times vs. Mana cost.  I think having a level 60 spell that will drain your entire mana bar, but heal the whole party A LOT in little cast time is a groovy idea.  Just some thoughts   :)

Format:

Spell name / HP Recovered / Over Time or Instant / # of ticks / Mana / Cast time

Level 1:
Minor Heal / 15 / Instant / 0 / 10 / 1.5
Thought of Health / 24 / Over Time / 3 / 12 / 2.0

Level 5:
Vision of Health / 48 / Over Time / 3 / 30 / 2.0

Level 24:

Prayer of Life / 450 / Over Time / 5 / 175 / 2.5

Level 29:
Substantial Healing / 500 / Instant / 0 / 220 / 3.5

Level 34:
Blessing of Life / 600 / Over Time / 5 / 200 / 3.0
Burst of Life / 350 / Instant / 0 / 300 / 0.5
Superior Healing / 538 / Instant / 0 / 250 / 4.5

Level 39:
*remove complete healing*
Surge of Life / 700 / Instant / 0 / 500 / 0.5

Level 44:
Divine Energy / 740 / Instant / 0 / 300 / 4.0
Celestial Healing / 748 / Over Time / 3 / 225 / 4.0

Level 49:
Word of Prayer / 300-person / Instant-Group / 0 / 450 / 6.0

Level 52:
Soothing Embrace / 1150 / Over Time / 5 / 350 / 4.5

Level 53:
Divine Blessing / 800 / Instant / 0 / 150 / 9.0

Level 55:
Word of Light / 525-person / Instant-Group / 0 / 500 / 6.0
Celestial Light / 1250 / Instant / 0 / 425 / 5.5

Level 56:
Jolt of Replentishment / 1300 / Instant / 0 / 650 / 1.0

Level 57:
Celestial Elixir / 1400 / Over time / 4 / 300 / 6.0

Level 59:
Celestial Peace / 2000 / Over time / 4 / 400 / 6.0

Level 60:
*remove group complete heal*
Word of Replentishment / 1500-each / Instant-Group / 0 / 900 / 9.0
Touch of an Angel / 2000-each / Over Time-Group / 8 / 750 / 5.5
Spirit Song / 3000 / Instant / 0 / 850 / 6.0
Vision of Life / 450 / Instant / 0 / 120 / 0.5
Savior / 2800-each / Instant / 0 / {Entire Mana Bar; Minimum 2300 mana to cast} / 0.5

==================================
Things NOT reasonable for a Cleric
==================================

Teleport to anywhere - We're not Druids or wizards.  Personally, I dont think druids should get ports, and ONLY wizards can, but that wont ever happy.  Reguardless, clerics should not get ANY sort of port.  ***MAYBE*** on our uber-kick butt piece of armor, a port to Gfay or something, but other than that, no.

Level 54 Pet - Take it out - I'd rather have a group AC buff.

100% XP Res - There is absolutely no penalty for death - forget it.  Would do more damage than good IMO.

Reagentless Symbols - While I agree the costs on some of these (Naltron for example) should be lowered, I dont think they should be removed.

Melee - Clerics are who we are because we put the life of hand-to-hand fighting aside.  The only damage we were meant to do was brought down from the gods above.  If you want to be a "Melee Battle Cleric", you need to find another game.

Faster Mana Regen - I don't think this is reasonable, however, I do believe we should be the only class that can med at all times standing, running, etc, since we don't (and shouldnt) have a form of mana regen other than medding.
