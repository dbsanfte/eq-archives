Everyone died at the end, but the warrior survived long eough to loot his blade.<P>It took us 3 attempts to succeed, and we only did because we were REAL lucky. <P>What strategies do other people use?</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#f7f7f7"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Caleal</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">The queen doesn't have a lot of HP, like 18-20k, but she is capable of killing a very large number of people very quickly. Due to how devastating her AE is most people find it preferable to fight her with a small number of people with very tightly controlled agro.<BR>The hard part is clearing out her guards, you will need to have more than one puller so that you can chain FD pull her guards away from her. We usually set up out in the hall in the corner by the fake wall.<BR>Once we have her down to 1 or 2 guards we quickly set up our fight team. Generally the team is 3 warriors, 3-4 clerics, every mage on the raid, 2-3 wizards and one enchanter. If there are 3 or more mages, I like using only one warrior and having all the clerics focused on him. Also there will usually be 2-3 suicide paladins involved. Can do it with fewer, but it sucks to be one of the people sitting outside in the hall, so we include as many people as its safe to. =)<BR>The critical thing is for the warriors, preferably only one of them, to hold agro through the entire fight. Pick one warrior to be the primary tank, have them engage and start off with riposte disciplin to build agro. after the Queen's first AE, a palladin uses LoH on the warrior then uses DA to cut his agro. Once riposte is gone, warrior should go defensive, at this point, at this its at least 2 clerics should be spamming CH at him, its handy for a pally to be standing by with LoH incase he gets to low. Any paladins involved need to be right at the warrior when they LoH and be ready to DA to get agro off them. The paladins should also understand that they will not be getting cleric heals, so once they LoH and get agro off them, they should back out of AE range, or die, thier option. The idea behind this is to prevent the queen from bouncing around after clerics, when we use this tactic to control agro MOBs don't generally even bat an eyelash at the clerics.<BR>Mage pets are very handy because they are imune to the AE. Need an enchanter to mez the extras in the room and any spawn. A couple of wizards are handy to blast her when she gets low on hp. She has a disgusting tendancey to run very fast out of her room and up the ramp when she gets low. About the time she hits the top of the ramp, she gets healed through the walls, stops and gates. I realy recommend you prevent that, about 2k in nukes is plenty to finish her off as she is about to run.  =)<P>We usually have about 12 in for the fight. She can be done with less, but who cares, its more fun to include people. I don't recommend having more involved with the fight due to possible agro problems. The key is keeping at least 1 warrior alive and keeping the queen agro on him. Also keeping the clerics and casters out the AE is critical. <P>Paladins involved in the fight are there only to help prevent prevent agro on clerics.<BR>Imediatly translocate, and ban from future raids, any ranger that decides to stand with the clerics and see how much damage he can do with trueshot....<BR>Once you kill the queen, its easy to keep the area clear pulling to her room. Keep an eye on the time and have everyone out of her room and ready for the fight with her 1 and 3/4 hours after she dies. Spawn time is suposed to be 2 hours, but she usually spawns about 10 min early for us.<BR>GL and have fun.  =)<BR><P>------------------<BR>Caleal P`Terak<BR>BATTLE CLERIC of Innoruuk<BR>Cazic-Thule server<BR>Officer, Shadowed Soul</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#dedfdf"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">electrae</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Wow!  Interesting tactics!<P>Only problem I would forsee is getting everyone to understand their part.  <P>We had a LOT of problems getting the guards cleared.  In fact, most of our problems stem from this.  Many times the queen would show up after we pulled some guards to the pit where the King spawns.  That always wiped us out.<P>I think we ended up charging the room when there were 4-6 guards still up.  Somehow even though the enchanters were all dead, the guards were mez'd.  I ressed the dead warrior wanting the queen blade and he was able to loot it before a guard killed him.<P>Quite an epic battle...  Truly what we lacked in tactics we made up for in persistance.</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#f7f7f7"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">electrae</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">After looking at this again for a bit I have one question, how do the clerics survive the AE?  Can you be out of range of the AE and still be in range for heals?</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#dedfdf"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Jhihad</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Yes The Queens AE is very short range (it also is line of sight).  If you fight her at her throne clerics can stand right at the door and heal and not be in the AE range.  The biggest trick to this is allowing the main tanks you send in to build enough aggro so that the Queen doenst go after the clerics that are healing.<P>Of course if you have enough high level melee, you can just go with guns blazing.  Send all your tanks in a rush with their offensive discipline.  Wizards nuke hard.  Since queen only has something like 26K hp she goes down super fast.<P>------------------<BR>Jhihad Daemonwrath, High Priest<BR>Xanit K'ven, Vallon Zek</FONT></TD></TR></TABLE>
