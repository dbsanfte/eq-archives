<TEXTAREA NAME="ReplyMessage" ROWS=10 COLS=45 WRAP="VIRTUAL">[QUOTE]Originally posted by Arturum:
[B]I log in this evening and something I have been fearing happened. Donal's Arms got the unannounced nerf. For those of you that don't know, and yes I'm letting the cat out of the bag here, Donal's Arms Valor effect can be used as a backup healing spell. Resolution is often used the same way due to it lower casting time. Basically the Arm's were giving out free 200 point heals. 

Anyway today I log in and pop a arm valor on myself, and notice RIGHT away the casting delay is WAY WAY up. Heres my log:

[Thu Jun 15 18:11:37 2000] Your Donal's Vambraces of Mourning begins to glow.
[Thu Jun 15 18:11:49 2000] You feel valorous.


12 seconds even. Now I don't have a /log of pre-patch casting, but I'm sure someone here does. Do me a favor, cut and paste it over here. 

Now I'll admit the effect is still damn slick, and perhaps I'm whining. The thing that gets me is this...Item Change Without Announcement. I guess they don't want everyone to know the extra healing effect of stacking valor upon valor. Well Verant, its out now...

I have always been under the impression, and perhaps I'm wrong here, that if they change an item they would post that change. 

Its going to be interesting to see how this all turns out.

It should not of been raised.  It already came at a price, to use it to heal, you had to buff with Valor, not reso or hero.  6 seconds is already longer then remedy by 2 seconds.  Shamans get a bracer thats unlimited damage of about 250, it was not nerfed, the sleeves were a very useful tool to save lives in those times when you thought all was lost for your group...oh well, hell in 12 seconds I won't even use it to buff newbs, faster to mem and cast reso, heh.<P>Az</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#f7f7f7"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Aldur</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Well I have to say that a free heal every 6 seconds is a little unbalanced dont ya think?<P>how many other classes can meditate what 90 mana in one tick.<P>They always said the cast times were 3-4x normal hence if anything they were unbalanced before.<P>The shaman arms are very very unbalanced I heard of what you can do with them so I don't expect them to be untouched for very long.<P>in my opinion from all equipment I seen if a peice of equipment changes radically what you are capable of doing then it will get changed.  Items on the whole just let you do what you do a bit better.<P>Some of the best items (EM BP, alabone gorget) and such don't actually let the cleric suddenly take on the world and win.  <P>It seems that having these effects on the armour is a bit of a mistake by verant.  Either its a completely worthless spell and people complain (bard summon food/water effects) or they are too powerful and is a must have item.<P>good spells to have on items are ones that people still use at level 50-60.  Having sow on druid and shaman armour, snare on ranger and druid armour that type of thing.  Maybe having level 49 ress spell on cleric BP with cast time of around a minute.  It wont let us take on red mobs and win but it will stop us sitting about on our arses all day ressing after a bad raid.<P>Things that people use day in day out but having something that would radically change the way you work (darkness on that necklace is one....has it been nerfed? cos a cleric with snare is so powerful - and no its not particually because im jealous (even though I am heh) its the fact that movement slowdown spells are something we have never had before....giving us that skill would definitely infringe on other classes role in a group).</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#dedfdf"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Greggery</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Didn't the patch say that items with effects would have casting times now, and that you had to stand still during it as if you were casting the spell?

Sure it's only 90 mana but if you can chain cast...<P>Second, the armor pushes EQ beyond Verant's vision. Gordon has listed us as an example of balance. We don't get invisibility (something we've asked for for quite some time). Now we have warriors with greaves that cast it. It's a slap in the face to give a FREE spell, especially one that a CASTER class has asked for, to a PURE MELEE class. Tell me how it's balancing to have a non-caster get a spell that WE NEED? Not to mention that why give them spells at all? We picked casters and gave up the ability to melee to be able to cast. Warriors gave up casting to melee. Now they get casting armor. Tell me, Verant, where is the armor that will allow us to melee better?<P>Third, why bother with the planes anymore? Much of this armor is superior to that found in the planes, yet it is not in level restricted zones, lore or no drop. Verant made a HUGE issue of how they wanted planes armor to be a status symbol and proof that you earned it. And now Verant hands us armor that eclipses our "status symbol" and can be handed to any level 5 twink? HELLO?<P>Fourth, what genious thought up this casting armor? I mean Donal's helmet has only AC and casts Yaulp II. I mean, unless you're at 200 wis without the EM helmet what cleric would wear it? In fact, most of the armor pieces (except greaves and the BP) are non-stat but rich in AC. Our greaves are actually useful as Naltron is one of the most mana draining spells we have and I doubt anyone will chain cast a spell requiring a 10-12pp reagent but I just don't see much else useful. (and we still don't know what our BP casts or what stats it has)<P>Lastly, hybrids. Hybrids have an exp penalty. Despite the revelation of it I wasn't that disturbed by it. Did it really destroy all the fun we had during the time we were ignorant? But Verant has justified keeping it using the excuse "...but you can cast..." It's no longer a completely valid excuse.

The helm is at least 4.5 maybe 5 seconds. So the helm casts a spell roughly twice as slowly as the real deal.<P>Valor has a casting time of 3 seconds. And "heals" 200 hp. According to these posts the casting time for a 200hp heal is now 12 seconds and not 6. Well clearly you can see the problem. It shouldn't be 12, but it never should have been 6 either. If daring is 4.5-5 seconds, Valor should be around 8-9 seconds. <P>Unfortunately I doubt this will be corrected and mostly likely Donal's arms will stay at 12 and the helm will be raised to 9.<P></FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#dedfdf"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Goryn Grimblade</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Innane patches like this just re-enforce my opinion that Verant doesn't have a clue how to run a business.

OBVIOUSLY the morons on the Live Server and Game Play teams NEVER even LOOK at the item lists that the Itemization Team comes up with. You idiots...take a look at your product and review it BEFORE you put it in the hands of your customers.

Because they never look at the "big picture" until after it's been released to 10,000 people.  Actually, I don't even think that it's not that they don't look, they can't look.. they don't have 10,000 people to show them before it gets to us.  See, they make this item thinking "Hey, lets put Valor on the arms, no one will really want to use it, it's a massive downgrade to what they could be using"... and they create the arms.  Then they release it to us, and low and behold, we do use it.. a lot, and we're using it to get around the lack of mana.  I can almost guarantee that they saw Valor as a "cute little extra" and never even thought about exactly what we could do with it.<P>Before they nerfed it, my groups had no gripes about getting valor instead of reso.  When I explained to them how I could squeeze heals out of my arms in a tight bind, they were overjoyed with Valor.. and this isn't what Verant wanted or intended<P>Am I overly upset that they nerfed it?  Nah.  I now just use them to heal Shamans when they cannibilize themselves.  I'm just personally overjoyed with the AC21 that comes with these arms... and so I shall not complain to highly, or to longly about this nerf... </FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#f7f7f7"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Omniscience</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">I am just feeling a bit upset and unfair to clerics.

I use it to heal pets between battles. The AC is awesome. Even pre nerf these were idiotic to use as a "free" heal in combat. Please. 200Hp heal? LOL, what were you fighting croc's in Oasis?

I have to agree to some degree with Ming, altho, the effect was a great downtime healer.  <P>Try looking at what's happened to monks.  The one thing they were supposed to do (king of melee) is an iffy proposition at best.  And armor?  A monk will be wearing the same armor from about lvl 25 till about lvl 46.  And so far monks are the only class without the ability to cast a spell.<P>Think about how shadowkights were treated in the past.  Can you say completely ignored.  At one point the single best thing about them (a spell) was not just nerfed, but completely taken away.<P>Think about rogues.  Now a class coming into its own (much like the SK), but previously completely underwhelming, and in the exact same boat as the SK.<P>Think about rangers.  A helm that does superior camoflage(sp?).  Nice.  But how does that make up for being about the most general class out there.  Talk about a nerf.  Play a class thru 50 only to find out that while no one class has all your skills, a balanced group can cover everything you can do.  I really feel for a friend of mine.<P>I'm not flaming, just trying to provide a little perspective on things.  Be happy for what you did get.  Armor with some incredible AC.  Grim is finally spawning. (Spoke with Telemachus on Veeshan - when he got the heart).
