<TEXTAREA NAME="EditedMessage" ROWS=10 COLS=45 WRAP="VIRTUAL">On 4/23 at 6pm central on the Brell server, my character encountered a bug in the Skyshrine zone which reset all of my faction in all game zones to starting default levels.

My character, Cozgrove, had worked for months specifically to build up positive faction on several zones to Kindly or better--this includes Skyshrine.  I had just completed the Emil's Report quest, as I had done many, many times, and was suddenly KOS to Skyshrine when I gated back to that zone.  I checked many other factions on other continents to discover it had happened everywhere.  All I had worked for was simply gone.

I have since learned that this is not an isolated incident.  A post on Allakhazam's site dated 4/2 speaks of this happening to someone.  Just last night, it happend to another character I know--Dreamflayer.  I'm guessing that it's been happening a lot.

What is more distressing is that when I was finally able to speak to Brell GM Oribi, I found her to be polite but of no help whatsoever.  I was assured that absolutely nothing can be done.  I was told that nobody has the power or authority to alter faction in any way regardless of circumstance.  I was told that my character could not simply be reset to a point prior to the bug having occured.  I was told that there was absolutely nobody I could appeal to.  Can this be true?

After a year and a half of being a loyal subscriber with TWO accounts and a combined play time approaching 200 days...THIS is good customer service?

I have reported the bug, as I assume others have, but I will also be posting to as many other sites as I can find to try and discover how often this has been happening, when it's been happening, whether or not it was reported, and how it was resolved.

Has this bug happened to YOU?

I would still love to simply have what I worked very hard for returned to me.  I'm not asking for *extra* faction...only what I had before a programmer's bug unjustly took it away.  Thanks for taking time to look at this.</TEXTAREA>
