[B]Buy some Donals Vambraces of Mourning they
go for about 2Kpp now and are nice AC and have the added benefit of casting Valor which is nice to heal yourself after rezes or other party members and conserve mana if required.
You can also use them too buff low level friends in zones as you run by free buffs are never a waste.

I took that advice around lvl 36, and started upgrading everything. I was getting fairly happy with my equipement, and felt that I had a pretty good setup.  <P>However, I am lvl 51 now, and I jsut realize my equipement is complete crap.  Although I this is my first character, and I am not in a n uber guild by any means (we raid 7th floor of tofs, and do the enterence area of charduk when we get enough people, we also recently tried kael, but we never made it into th arena, hehe -on a very good night we can organize 10-14 reasonably high lvl characters).  Which basically rules out any sort of raid gear, ie SoV, planar.<P>My current ac can reach 754 fully buffed, and 190 wisdom, very little additional mana, 118 agility, 55 charismae, and 86 str. (I am a dark elf).  I am usually not fully buffed, however when I am, I do notice mobs actually miss me in KC (with my new remedy spell, it takes a bit of work for a monster to kill me  <IMG SRC="http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/smile.gif">. I cant even imagine what it would be like to have 900 ac with remedy...<P>The mojority of my gear was actually earned in KC, or I was all able to trade for items that I've made in KC (ie i traded a book of the obsidian for a paw of appolo, that way I can use the paw and a cgs for good wisdom and 20ac).<P>Current set up (I cant remember the names of every piece though):<P>Jarscap BP -20ac (lightwieght, i used to wear a Dusty, should i switch back?)<BR>Jarscrap Legs (they are actually pretty good)<BR>Jarscrap Boots<BR>Jarscrap Helmet<BR>Kunzar Cloak<BR>2 - forest loops<BR>2 - wisdom rings<BR>Chipped bone bracer<BR>A bracer from a warlord that I killed (5wisdom and more ac then a chipped bone bracer).<BR>Plat. Ruby viel (7str/wis)<BR>Charred Guardian Shield<BR>Paw of O.<BR>rang slot empty.<BR>Some gloves that I found in tofs (i think 3wisdom, and some agi)<BR>I think Ulthork Arms (adds a few wisdom, could be wrong on the name).<BR>Some 4wis/str necklace.<P>I think that is everything. I have just over 4000plat saved up in the bank.<P>Should I just scrap most of my equipement and buy Ro armor for the higher ac (will probably loose more wisdom)? Or buy a set of rygors armor (if i am going to wear crap armor I might as well look good :P).<P>I plan on devoting most of my time now getting better armor (considering my lvl).<P>What should I buy, and what should I hunt for?  <P>I do have a reasonable amount of time to play, however like I said I cannot form large groups, and I dont really want to sit around by myself doing boring camps.  I think I am going to try to get some Seb. armor - I think there is a nice cloak that drops there.<P>I am getting very tired of people saying "Sorry, I am looking for a 49 lvl res (snicker, hey everyone look at this n00b in KC)". Which I have to reply, no I am lvl 51, and that's not banded armor that I am wearing...<P>A "lvl 19 looking" 51st, sad, Dark Elf Vicar.</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#f7f7f7"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Panteroo</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">some immediate upgrades for you... but you most likely won't be getting exp getting them...<P>Skyshrine --<BR>Guardian Helm (ac & wis)<BR>Guardian Legs (ac & wis)<BR>Guardian BP   (ac & str/sta)<P>Icewell --<BR>Royal Frosted Velium Boots (ac 19 !!)<BR>RFV Gaunts/Arms (for AC only)<BR>-- in icewell, these items rot all the time because there is nobody to loot them<P>EW --<BR>Gauntlets of the Black (ac +wis)<P>Thurgadin --<BR>Prayer Shawl quest #3...

Just realize that at your level only the occassional Gargoyle Guard will be blue... everything else will be green.<P>Get into Icewell on a busy saturday night (like tonight most likely will be). If your on dwarf faction just auction to the zone that you are buffing and post-fight healing for the rights to loot some RFV Boots... By doing this you will get first priority over any level 2 newbie who just ran up there for the loot. Chances are you won't be able to loot the legs and bp since they are quite rare and sought after (tis the reason most people in icewell are hunting) and the other easy to get items are not as good as what you already have (gaunts, arms, helm).<P>If you want to max your doorf faction AND get a sweet azz'd range slot item, do the thurgadin shawl quests:<BR>1) 4 giant toes<BR>2) 10 giant heads combined in a box (given)<BR>3) "feed" the doorfs (requires baking and pottery, but can be multiquested)<P>Even after i have hunted in Icewell for 4 full days I am still amiable with the dwarfs (I am switching to Kael faction).
