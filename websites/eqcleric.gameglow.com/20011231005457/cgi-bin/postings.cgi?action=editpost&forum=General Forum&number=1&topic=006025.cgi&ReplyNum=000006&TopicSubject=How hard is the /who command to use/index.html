<TEXTAREA NAME="EditedMessage" ROWS=10 COLS=45 WRAP="VIRTUAL">Well, for me it is getting annoying lately.
I play on European times and usually not many people are on - also not many people are not-anonymous since we are on a PvP-Server.

If I play on a weekend afternoon, I get tells for resses like every 5 minutes for resses. What even more bothers me, is that people can´t accept a "no". Lately I don´t even answer requests anymore, because 90% of the people keep bothering you, even if you tell them that you are busy. Some examples from the last days:

- I was deep in Kael, getting Corroded with the guild. Player X tells you: "Hello fellow dark elf. I lost my head in Lake of Ill Omen. Can you come and ress me?". I answered that I am busy with guild in Kael, behind see-invis mobs and without a mage to CoH me back, so that I won´t be able to. Answer: "You won´t help your same race when they need you? blablabla" ... *sigh*
- I was in Western Wastes, hunting dragons with my guild. Player X tells you: "Can you zone over to Eastern Wastes and res me?" Uhm ... I explained him that Eastern Wastes is not one zone to zone over and that I was busy and couldn´t leave, etc. Answer: "You are lying!"  ... *sigh*
- The funniest thing happened when I was in Hate once. Player X tells you: "Hello. I need your help". "I am busy in Hate, I am not able to come to ress you, I am sorry". "Oh, I don´t need a ress. I am level 1 and need a bodyguard that travels with me from Halas to Freeport". ... uhm ...

What I hate is:
An_Unknown_Player00 tells you: "
*sigh 
You tell your group: "Ress-Request incoming"
An_Unknown_Player00 tells you: "Can you ress me?"
Sorry, I am AFK right now

If I give responses lately when somebody asks for resses depends how they ask. If they don´t know me and don´t even say a hello first, I don´t bother to answer them. Something like "Can ya rez me plz. thx." I will never answer. Did I mention I hate "plz" and "thx"?

But thanks god there are other people as well. While I was busy looking for some Griffins in EW, a druid gave me a tell, asking desperately for a ress in a nice manner. He went LD in Field of Bone and ran into a guard and died and lost his level 55. He came and picked me up, we went there (all in all took like 20 minutes or so *shrug*) and I ressed him. He gave me 1k in the trade-window and I always cancelled the trade. He was really surprised that I don´t charge for resses - I never do. Either I want to ress people or I don´t. Offering me pp won´t help. But now everytime he is in the same zone as I am, he asks me if I need a ride - which is way more usefull for me then pp  :)

Well, to end my babbling (sorry, bored at work  ;)), I have to say that lately the requests and the attitude of people have gone worse and worse each day. And no, it´s not the quad-kiting druids that are so annoying - to be honest, they are most the time the nicest people. It´s simple people who can´t accept a "no, I am busy" as a "no" and keep bothering you.
