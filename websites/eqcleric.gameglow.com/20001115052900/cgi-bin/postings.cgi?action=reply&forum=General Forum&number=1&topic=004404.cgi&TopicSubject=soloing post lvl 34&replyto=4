<TEXTAREA NAME="ReplyMessage" ROWS=10 COLS=45 WRAP="VIRTUAL">[QUOTE]Originally posted by bellsong:
[B]I got a lecture from an over50 cleric the other day.....

he was pretty adament that my 750 ( unbuffed)ac, 189 wisdom, resists from 45 up, and 105 extra mana....was........poopy


he suggested I drop another 40 or so ac and resists, to get 11 wisdom and 50 more mana...which i could easily do


*IF* I wanted to get smeared


I try hard to balance things...forest loops/ electrum black sapphire ears, for Ac AND Mana..

bloodstained coif rather then nightshade etc.


dont let anyone tell YOU how play...if your group logs off at the end of the night happy, and alive...you did fine...

if that group is just you, alone.....its just easier to apply the rule[/B][/QUOTE]

Well I have to strongly disagree.  I am presently a lvl 36 cleric on rallos zek, I have a 735 buffed AC, 1120 hps, 150 wisdom.  I have absolutely no problem soloing non-undead blues.  <P>I sit in melee pounding on them with my cadecaus and casting wrath over and over.  When I finish a fight I am usually left with 2-2.5 bulbs of mana, and only lose about .5 - 1.5 bulbs of health.  This is more effecient than my wizard was using roots after each nuke.<P>So if you are a younger cleric don't listen to what everyone says, always take AC into consideration when you decide what to wear, don't worry about getting to 200 Wisdom, its highly overrated at these lvls, and as long as you can solo something without root you'll do just fine for effeciency.<P>My general rule of thumb, never drop more than 1 ac to pick up 1 wisdom.  A skull shaped barbute is a lot better than a runed circlet, the chestplate of the constant is better than a bs tunic... you get the idea.  </FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#f7f7f7"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Dalur - Veeshan</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">A lot also depends on where you are soloing.  A lot of stuff is much harder to solo on in Kunark than say the old world.  I can remember being level 50 and EASILY taking down spectres in oasis or OOT.  Once Kunark opened, I went to trakanon's teeth and went to soloing on the spectral keepers.  They were a tough fight.  I would use 3 quarters of my mana bar and be down about 2 bubbles of health after healing during the fight.<P>Even at level 57 the last time I ran through there using my new undead nuke 695, I would use half a mana bar on them.  Specs I can drop with 2 nukes and a sound of force (generally).<P>I have soloed the living stuff, but it's much harder as the damage output from our normal nukes are not efficient as our undead nukes.<P>So yes I do agree with you that those who say soloing as a cleric is impossible are incorrect.  Although at higher level you WILL find that you will not be able to stand toe to toe with things and nuke and melee.  The things at higher levels start hitting way too  hard to take a beating for more than a couple hits.  I have 900+ AC and still get the snot beat out of me in very rapid order.<BR><P>------------------<BR>Dalur Stouthealer<BR>58th Dwarven Templar<BR>Veeshan Server</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#dedfdf"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Aguuth</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">yes i agree that I do not plan on soloing post lvl 50 very often.  However I am almost positive I can solo non undead, without using root all the way up to lvl 49.  <P>This whole post stemmed from me grouping with 2 different clerics over the last 2 days.  Both of them were in pure wisdom gear and well, they sucked IMO.  When a mob aggroed on them for some reason they were just destroyed in combat.  When things went bad I was able to taunt something off and root/park it without taking much dmg, they couldn't.  If I got aggroed because the tank needed a heal immediately after the pull I took little dmg, if they healed they almost died.  When things got really ugly I was able to use divine aura/intervention to pull everything off the tanks and let them zone, then I gated through 3 mobs... I'm sure with low AC they couldn't of.  And yet they were ripping on me for being a newbie with only a 150 Wisdom.  I had almost 200 more AC than one of them, heh.  And I don't have twinked gear or anything.</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#f7f7f7"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Dalur - Veeshan</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">You are at that point that pretty soon you will find that you WON'T be able to melee effectively when soloing.  Things start to hit you WAY to hard to make it effective.  I too soloed and grouped quite a bit around your level.  I found that I could not last more than a couple rounds with a mob going toe to toe even with high AC.  Even with 900+ AC and level 58, giants can still hit me for 75+.  Most of the things you will need to start fighting at your level to get continuous xp will start to hit you that hard - in addition they will start to double and triple attack you.<P>If you are able to solo doing the melee method all the way up to 49, you are a better cleric than I.  I tip my EM/Donal's Helm to you should you succeed.  Keep us updated on how your soloing/meleeing goes as you progress.<BR><P>------------------<BR>Dalur Stouthealer<BR>58th Dwarven Templar<BR>Veeshan Server</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#dedfdf"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">bellsong</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">I got a lecture from an over50 cleric the other day.....<P>he was pretty adament that my 750 ( unbuffed)ac, 189 wisdom, resists from 45 up, and 105 extra mana....was........poopy<P><BR>he suggested I drop another 40 or so ac and resists, to get 11 wisdom and 50 more mana...which i could easily do<P><BR>*IF* I wanted to get smeared<P><BR>I try hard to balance things...forest loops/ electrum black sapphire ears, for Ac AND Mana..<P>bloodstained coif rather then nightshade etc.<P><BR>dont let anyone tell YOU how play...if your group logs off at the end of the night happy, and alive...you did fine...<P>if that group is just you, alone.....its just easier to apply the rule</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#f7f7f7"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Tesius</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">I have to agree with Dalur, as with most of the other clerics who have learned this the hard way...  Yes, with a high AC we can tank.  But with a lower number of HP's than melee classes combined with the inability to hit the broad side of a forest giant, we can't stand toe-to-toe with a high-level mob (especially Kunark mobs) for very long.<P>For example, a wurm will make short work of me, as it hits for 134 consistently. Combine that with double and triple attacks, and the occasional stun, and you can die in a matter of seconds.<P>Can we solo past level 50?  Absolutely.  Is it done often?  No.  Can we solo non-undead mobs?  Absolutely.  Is it done often?  Again, no.<P>The AC / Wisdom argument has been debated before, and probably will continue to be as long as people play the game.  Just play how you wish to play, and don't pander to snooty players telling you how to play.<P>*throws 2cp into the air*<P>------------------<BR>Tesius Lux<BR>45th Priest of Innoruuk<BR>Solusek Ro</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#dedfdf"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Braddley</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Yeah, I'm the type of cleric who believes in Rooting, Nuking Undead, Re-rooting, Nuke Nuke Nuke, Root, Nuke, loot and scoot.  hehe.<P>I just go into LG and solo Wans and Zols.  Wans never pose a problem and Zols, I just need to make sure my Root sticks.<P>I don't like to solo live stuff right now, until 44th, but then I can do it, due to Retribution's MUCHO more damage output.  hehe<P>Braddley<BR>43.95 lvl Cleric</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#f7f7f7"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Aguuth</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Update number 1... I am now lvl 39, soloing stuff in overthere when my monk friend isn't around ( yes I realize I gained 3 lvls in 3 days, heh).  I can still solo up to a lvl 34 mob in melee without rooting and just timing my nukes.  This means I can solo this way at least to lvl 45 I believe.  My wisdom is up to a 153, which is plenty to kill this stuff, and my ac is a little over 760 now I believe.  When I finish a fight I usually have 2 bulbs mana left and lose around 1-2 bulbs health, I  usually need to heal every 2-3 fights.  I still get better exp this way then in a full group usually... though I've found best exp I get is when grouped with a lvl 44 monk who can blow through low blues(lvl 32ish mobs) in now time.</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#dedfdf"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Dalur - Veeshan</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Gratz on your levels and your progress.<P>Keep the updates coming as I will be interested to know if it is indeed possible to make it to 49 with the melee method.<BR><P>------------------<BR>Dalur Stouthealer<BR>58th Dwarven Templar<BR>Veeshan Server</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#f7f7f7"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Zifnab</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">I stopped soloing at 52.
