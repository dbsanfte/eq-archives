[B](Quick aside: do I get annoyed when they ask me class level? I'm not anon, and I STILL get asked, and I say things like "cleric, just like it says on my /who  ;)")

To anon, or not to anon, that is the question.  Whether tis nobler in the mind to suffer the endless tells for resses, or to go anon, and by anon-ing, silence.  

(Ok enough of that)

You have a personal choice here. On one hand, some clerics can't stand the number of res requests they get and go anonymous. On the other hand, some don't, either because they don't mind so much, or out of a sense of duty, or what have you. It's a choice you have to make for yourself (usually when you hit about 39th).

I do not go anon. I get requests for resses all over the place. I have a policy on doing them, and it depends on how busy I am and where they are, and I stick to it. On one hand I get tired of the requests sometimes, especially because some people are rude and ungrateful.

On the other hand, some people are kind, wonderful, thankful, appreciative, and generous. And those people are a pleasure to interact with.  And sometimes you will be rewarded if you are willing to go out of your way to help someone. (My top reward to date is a robe of the ishva.)

You can go anon, and avoid the requests. In doing so you avoid the hassle, but also the pleasures. The choice is up to you.

All you people out there, let this newbie pick your brain for a bit.  I was confuzzled when I heard these two terms talked about once.  And I want to know why someone would use them.<P>/anon Okay the anonomus(sp?) button.  Now I understand, through many of your posts, that you put this on when you don't want to be bothered when you do quests and such.  If I ever get higher level ... and I pray that Prexus will allow me ... it can be a good and a bad thing.  I mean don't you get annoyed by all the people who keep sending you /tell asking what level/class/race you are?<P>/role I have no idea what good this /roleplay thing is.  ain't it just like /anon?

It also means that the only way someone could find out if your on is too either have you in their friends list as this will show you as being on just now where you are.  Also if someone has your name they can do a /who <name> all and see if you on and again will not know what zone you are in.<P>The /roleplay is really used like a /anon but this actually leaves the Guild tag up so you can do a /who all <guild name> and it will show you in the list, many guilds prefer this as it shows active members when a who is done on the guild.<P>The use is really upto the player but majority of these two commands are used by Druids and Wizards and not Clerics after all we are honorable and tend too show ourselves to the public at large.

Is he good or bad, does he have any mortal enemies, is he strong or weak, smart or not so smart, quick or slow, etc.. Then you try and act out that cahracter while playing within the rules of the game. For EQ you would probably do other things but similar to tabletop games, for instance dwarves and elves while not hating each other dont' get along unless trouble is around, then they work together very well. High Elves think they are better than everyone else and would never stoop so low as to group with any of the evil races. Gnomes are always curious and in some games they invent very strange and often explosive machines, Paladins are mortal enemies with Shadow Knights, and good clerics would distrust any necromancer.<P>But in EQ it makes things kind of hard, although some people do it, to not group with certain classes or races, and to stay in a role, especially in the middle or combat and such so most people don't do it or those that do only do it in certain situations. Some people create stories around their character, I remember one person, I forget the URL, that had this huge story for her elven cleric, and it was a great story too by the way. The best one i'd ever met was a necromancer when i was still playing on prexus. We got into this big theological debate over the gods in EQ in the middle of tox forest, it was so much fun. but it takes more effort than most people are willing to do. <P>but i'm rambling and my thoughts are jumping all over the place so i'll shut up now, i hope i didn't confuse you <IMG SRC="http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/smile.gif"></FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#dedfdf"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Kayleigh</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">(Quick aside: do I get annoyed when they ask me class level?

It's not hard to respond to someone, be polite, even when they are not.

Plain and simple.<P>My not being anon is not a advertisment for my services (It can't be, I res with the watersprinkler and I'm level 55 so my who listing does not reflect the res I cast).
