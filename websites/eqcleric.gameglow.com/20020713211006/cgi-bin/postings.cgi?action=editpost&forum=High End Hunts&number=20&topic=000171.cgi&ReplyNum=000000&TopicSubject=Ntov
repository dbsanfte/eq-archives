<TEXTAREA NAME="EditedMessage" ROWS=10 COLS=45 WRAP="VIRTUAL">Just thought I would ask peoples opinions on something, since this is a sensible mb, with people whose opinions are worth taking.

Firstly a bit of background.  my guild is a reasonably largish (probably 120-150 people, but with 40-60 average raid attendence) that is capable of killing greig, IV, all of UP, rhags 1&2 (though who couldn't kill them), everything in kael except AoW, have attempted tunare once and done reasonably well, CT, wtov and all ST key dropers and ik and eashen.

What we have been rather fearful of is north tov.

At present we have had a single attempt at aary in which we messed up royally, tank ran out of range of first heal, died and she ran round corner ae'd everyone with the proper ae and that was the end of that.  Dispite this we did get her to 50%, so are confident that given another shot we will own her.

Anyhow on sunday we found ourselves with nothing to do.  Given that ntov is something we wish to learn (and I don't know about you but my guild needs to try things - fail a few times so we learn what to do, what not to do).  We wanted to go into ntov and practice killing the yard trash.

There is a rotation for ntov on tribunal which we are not a part of, and that rotation had given ntov out to another guild (who is est/pst based and hence very worried that a euro raiding guild becomes capable of killing in ntov).  When we were preping for coh to the hatchlings area we were trained by that guild.  Long story short GM's appeared and ordered the other guild out of the zone and gave them their second official warning.

So my guild had free reign to enter ntov - which we took advantage of to learn its ways.

Anyhow after 3 wipe outs, we had learned that flurry drakes need to be respected and that dagners the destroyer likes to run up the wall if you try and position him so that his ae doesn't hit the casters (we wiped out once because of this, and killed him on the second try, it didn't really count because he seems to velks regen rate.  I am confident though with the knowledge we had gained we could do him again on first attempt).  We also killed the naggy clone on first attempt, but wiped out just before doing a lady dragon near koi because we accidentally trained koi to camp before we were ready - and the back spawns which all suddenly poped prevented a meaningful cr.

As you can imagine with the loss of certain mobs - the guilds in the rotation are a bit upset with my guild for having the nerve to attempt something.

So I was wondering what other guilds feel about going into ntov without killing aary.  I believe my guild is clearly capable of killing aary, but just not have an opportunity to prove this.  I personelly do not see why any other guilds try and tell any other guild what they can and can not do(As long as they are not in the zone with a raid before us - we will always respect a raid capable guild, though we once had 19 people claiming zlandicar, which we did ignore, they were cring at the time cos I think van wiped them out.)

Also how did other guilds find when they entered that part of teh zone for the first time?  We are getting called useless because we have died whilst trying to learn the zone.  For example yesterday we went after the triplets, and when we preped for the blackstar mob, we accidentally pulled the one that ae's for 1250 which we were really not prepared to take (and I can imagine we will die lots of times learning effective strategies).

Do other guilds typically do things on their first attempt, or are they like mine, they learn through trial and error.  Unafraid to try and die - knowing that knowledge gained is the most important part of the first attempt.</TEXTAREA>
