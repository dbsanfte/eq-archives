A test of a cleric versus undead, would only be a test of his or her's marshall prowess and ability to nuke undead and keep the others under control until they could be dealt with.<BR> A true test of a Cleric is in keeping his party alive! Give a cleric 3-5 players at random to form a group. Give em five minutes to discuss tactics and to cast Buffs. In Three waves of increassing difficulty send monsters at them. THe cleric with the minimal deaths in a party and that survives the event with the most members alive during the most waves wins that chapter.<P> For it will be true me lass, that a cleric with hammer of the gods, may defeat undead much faster than his bretheren who haven't achieved such luck. A mace of Ykesha, for example would allow a properly geared cleric to cause immense damage on his opponents in a battle.<P> Necro's are the masters of undead as advertised, they have the most tools to deal with them, clerics have a few tools shared with that class. Our Strentgh is in our ability to heal others and to allow a group to take on more than they normally could in a battle.<P> Here are some propsed rules:<P> GROUPS shall consist of 3-5 members seleceted by cleirc from a pool of volunteers cleared by the Arena Council. Suggested are heroes taken at random, and all would be scanned and geared by the GMs themselves and paid for their time. Heck I'll Bring the Double Brewed Double stout Dwarven ale to the Arena. IF ye want Mama Gurtha's Happy Meat Pies, that's extra as she don't deliver.<P> This pool would include Monks, Rogues, Rangers ( one must be chosen) A tank (Warrior, Paladin SK), one caster type(Mage chanter wizard necro), and one of the following (Druid, bard, shaman,)  The OThers are allowed to Buff themselves, BUT NOT EACH OTHER...this is the cleric's Job.<BR> A caster with a PET is worth TWO SLOTS int he group, or two points. As are the Shaman, druid and BArds)<BR> A rule of thumb is That Secondary healers cannnot Heal each other or themselves or pets. Damage shields other than on their own pets are disallowed also.<P>   Five minutes to Buff party and med up.<BR>   Wave one 2-3 mobs of medium power.<BR>   Wave Two 2-3 mobs of equal power as group level.<BR>   Wave Three 1-2 caster mob + 2-3 medium Mobs<BR>   Wave Four 4-6 Undead <BR>   Wave Five 4-6 Caster MOBS<BR>   Wave SIX If necessary- UBER MOB<P> Cleric Must Survive each wave. IF group member dies in a fight. To continue in group they must be ressed in fight/battle currently going On. If NOT they may option to replace two of the NEXT MONSTERS in next wave.<BR>  Downtime between battles is lowered as waves progress... 1st to 2nd 5 minutes, 2nd to 3rd 4 minutes, 3rd to 4rt...3....etc etc.<P> This would challenge a cleric to select a balanced group for the challenge based on skills not gear, and two test his ability to direct a battle and keep his party alive in a fight.<P> The cleric that goes the most waves before succumbing is the winner. In case of a tie the GM will select two PCs to joing the cleric. Kill and rez one immediately and then send in a wave of undead one at time once every minute until cleric is dead or his two party members are.<P> This allows the clerics to be used as designed.<BR> Merely fighting undead limits any cleric that specialized in his main skill Healing sphere or abjuration to be at a penalty compared to the rare evocation specialist out there.<P> Clerics aren't necros, nor are they wizards, so sending them in to killundead in waves until they are dead is by no means a true test of their skills. It's only a test of mana pool, gear, and ability to control multiple mobs. Clerics ARE NOT DESIGNED TO SOLO. Therefor this test as you proposed is UNBALANCED and UNFAIR.<P>============================================<BR>OKAY BOYOS N LASSES, POST RESPONSES ON THAT THREAD LINK UP TOP AND OFFER CHANGES TOO>!<BR>IF WE ARE VOCAL WE MAY BE HEARD LONG ENOUGH TO GET THE TEST OF TACTICS AND TEST OF CLERICS TO BE A COMBO EVENT OR VERY SIMILAR.<BR>=============================================<P></FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#f7f7f7"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Darus Grey</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">So you find this more asinine then two clerics with 200+ MR nuking each other out only to not land a single spell and melee to death for 3 hours =0?<P>------------------<BR>-Darus Grey, 53 cleric of 211 days played.</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#dedfdf"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">JaigeTZ</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">I don't even think there should be a cleric BoTB tourney, it would be dumb either way.<P>------------------<BR><B>Jaige Lors'Thex</B><BR>Cleric of Innoruuk<BR>Eternal Darkness @ Tallon Zek</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#f7f7f7"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Llumis</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">I dunno, I kind of like Brodder's idea.

Make them auto-ran somehow by Verant(user or auto-computer). Make these two Ogres just stand toe-to-toe and beat on each other so that the warriors battle tactics are not a factor in the outcome of the fight. The idea of the contest now is to beat the opposing cleric and/or thge clerics Ogre. You are responsible for not only staying alive, but you have to keep your Ogre alive AND defeat the other team.<P>All spells are available and can be used to either heal yourself, your Ogre or get offensive against the opposing Ogre or the opposing cleric. If either you or your Ogre dies. The competition is over and you lose.<P>Why a 50th level Ogre and not 60? - Make sure all your offensive spells can land, even if you are not level 60.<P>Why an Ogre and not some other char? - Give the warriors a lot of htpts to be able to stand in battle a long time to truly test the clerics ability<P>Why have a second Warrior char? - Clerics in a purely offensive battle is not that exciting and really doesnt test a cleric at all<P>I think this would be a good test of both the sit/med and heal clerics and those clerics who still think that they are an offensive weapon.
