<TEXTAREA NAME="ReplyMessage" ROWS=10 COLS=45 WRAP="VIRTUAL">[QUOTE]Originally posted by chukoliang:
[B]Hmmm, I don't know if it seems horrible to you but I will tell you what I feel was the personal worst rez experience, I had.

I have had the tells from across the world. I have had people begging for rez's. I have even had people telling me I was a jerk and more,because I didn't travel 6 zones to rez some total stranger. I have had totally twinked out guys with super items who don't give me a dime for the rez. And of course what I usually get is a thank you , I don't require a donation,but when your as poor as I am, it sure helps. Even a buff is good  :)

But my worst experience was when I had just died in burning woods hunting wasps with a druid friend and , I was bound in the Dreadlands. As I was going across a guy from my guild whom I barely knew was asking for a rez. I asked him where his body was and he proceeded to argue with me that I was not high enough level to rez him the 90% rez with my level 51 cleric. 

Ignoring that I told him I could and found out his body was some where in FV. I zoned over and ran there, not having an invis and barely having a sow , I ran near the city where he told me the body would be. I then messaged him and he told me it was along the river bank heading away from the zone to the lake of Ill omen. Not being terribly familar with the area and a little bit worried, because even the green mobs there seemed able to kick my butt, I went on the hunt for my guildies body. 

I continued the search with the /corpse button along the area he said his body was, it took me about 30 minutes to figure out that this guy knew the zone less then I did. I was already into the quest to resurrect him so I was determined to get him. I msged the guild , no one would respond to help this person. I was shocked no one would come help the cleric, who had rezzed their arses and healed them. But I continued to search.

Then I was struck down by one of these green mobs and killed. I then went back to my bind point and had to make my way back to the FV zone with no items on me. I was running to the zone and I got lagged out by the trees (which often happens to me) and I was killed.

 I had to find a friendly bard with nothing to do to point me to my body. She did and I followed her. She showed me to my body in time for me to get beat on and killed by another mob. Fortunately the kind bardess came to my rescue and brought my two bodies to me to be rezzed at the KC zone. After the rez an enchanter I am in the habit of trading spells with, you know I buff him and he gives me clarity, fixed me up with clarity and invis while his druid friend in his group gave me a sow.

I was now invis and sowed so I ran to the fv zone and using the /loc command which I always hit when something starts beating on me I was able to find my body. About 300 feet away in game terms I found the body of the guild mate, I dragged both bodies back to the bridge near fv where the guards were, getting my head beat in dragging it there, but being saved by the guard.

Both bodies were safe, so now I contacted the other person and he was afk so I rezzed myself. Then I rezed him. After I rezzed him, he msged the guild that he had gotten lvl 54 back and without out a thank you, or do you need a sow (he was a ranger), or a pretended offer for a donation, or not even a thank you for your help guild brother, he camped. 

I was a little disgruntled, and then went to the bank in F.V. and got me a sow potion and invis potion and then had made it back to where my body was in the Burning Woods, I rezed myself and had lost some exp, because I had died once on my own ,but 3 times in helping my guild mate. It was late at night so I camped.

I logged out and came back on to have a message from a guildy asking me why I was a jerk and didn't rez the named person from the night before. Of course I was very confused and talked to the guildy and then found out that the named person quit because no one in the guild had helped him. He mentioned my name and the person messaging me assumed it was me who didn't help. However, it was soon realized that I was the only one who helped the person.

This was all for naught though because , later I went on a Vox raid, we killed vox and the gm's shortly after respawned it, and this lead to confusion that extended a rift between some persons and the guild lost most of it's higher level persons, while I just followed a friend of mine, who left and went to another guild. 

I would have to say thats my worst rez experience, because it lead to my most deaths and the strangest reprecussions afterwards.

But i'm sure there are many clerics with worse rez experiences out there.[/B][/QUOTE]
