Now zone back out, take a deep breath, and /shout BANZAI!!!!! Cleric inc to liveside, move your butts! (a lot of people twink/exp at the liveside zone in uguk).  Now run like a girl again.
Getting out:  Please tell me you didn't bind at liveside...

Other tricks:  get an invis near the zoneline - invis does tend to fall at the worst possible times though, and some mobs can see through it.  If you choose this, make sure you have an SoW as well.  As far as learning the ways around uguk, make a human character and run them down.  You won't be KoS to live frogs, and can explore at your leisure, learning the routes.  I haven't done this in a while, but if they changed it, all you lose is about 30 minutes on a throw-away character.  You'll need an SoW to make it down to Guk, but that isn't hard to find.

My best advice would be get a friend that can invis/camo you and make sure you have stun/root & gate memmed.  Print off a map of upper guk and study it a bit before you head in.  Try to figure out ahead of time where you are going and keep moving.  Should you get into trouble, stun, root and gate.  Do this a couple times and you should figure out how to get to the main zone area of lower guk fairly easily.  Once you are in lower guk, and fighting the dead stuff there, you might be able to raise your faction enough that you won't be KOS anymore by the upper guk frogs.<P><P>------------------<BR>Dalur Stouthealer<BR>52nd Dwarven Vicar<BR>Veeshan Server</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#dedfdf"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Suesc</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">I would like to chime in- please, info on L Guk.

Leo died twice, sliced through pretty quickly.  <P>The advice I had received said to solo at the zone, and try to get into a "Bedroom loop" group.  <P>I am also curious if the greenies in Upper Guk will ever stop aggroing.  Leo killed just a few live frogs.  But it is enough that one of two frogs right near the zone to Lower Guk aggro. Running to Lower Guk is no biggie then, because Leo just zones.  But getting out will be another story.

If you make all the right turnings, it takes about 40 seconds each way. The live frogs are agro to me so I knew all about this when I started going to lguk, back in my low 30s.<P>On the way down, nothing will agro til the scryer room in uguk. As long as you don't fall off the plank bridge over the water, you can get from there to deadside zone real fast, so if you do get in trouble just divine aura and leggit.<P>Do the run down a few times, gating back out to the swamp. And then once you feel comfortable with the directions, run it the other way, coming out. From deadside back to the surface, the first few frogs are spread out, so I usually just rooted em and ran away, not bothering with atone. The only tricky bit coming out is the last bit by the crocs, but the frogs there are super low level so you shouldn't have any difficulties.<P>Hope this helps.<BR><P>------------------<BR>Zakalwe Soulwarden<BR>44th lvl Halfling Cleric<BR>Old Continent, Povar</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#f7f7f7"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Sphynkl</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">I've become amiable to the live froggies by killing the dead ones.

Also- does enough spawn at the bottom of that ramp to the left and right of the "T", to support working this area?
