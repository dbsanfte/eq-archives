There is usually never enough mana to use DDs anyway and i only mem the buffs at buff time.

You might from time to time wonder why you have one or other of the heals memmed, but they are not all there for when everything is going well. It is when things go the wrong way up that you need your whole armory of heals.

Here are the contenders:<P>Resolution: Can act as a heal.  faster casting than greater for about the same healing power. Messes up my buff timing.  I like to have all buffs fade at same time so I can reapply with ease.  Abjuration also kinda scary for interrupts<P>Greater:  Piddly heal but seems to work for casters that are getting pounded.  Fast cast too.  Alteration so I can channel easily<P>Superior:  Nice heal but Celestial kinda overlaps. Also might overheal from time to time<P>Celestial:  OMG this spell ROCKS!  Only downside is I wonder if I used it in place of superior and had a druid or something down to half a bubble, I wonder if it would heal fast enough.<P>Complete:  Duh, always memmed.<P>So Celestial and complete are gimmies but what should I mem for the third slot (I think 3 is all I can afford space wise):<P>Greater<BR>Resolution<BR>Superior<P>Please Advise,<P>Phinnin<BR></FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#f7f7f7"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Dikmer</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">I never trusted using buffs to heal.

If it looks like that wont be enough, pop a Greater. Don't Celestial the tank if you can avoid it, and Complete Heal them as much as possible.<P>Celestial wasn't available when I was 44, and I don't have it now, so I don't have any practice using it.<P>This just seems the best way to do it, based on what I have read.</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#dedfdf"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Darianne</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><BR>I got Cel Heal at 45... since then Cel Heal and Sup Heal have almost exclusivly been my heals, with CH coming out only in a few limited situations (I'm glad you use it so often to rate a 'duh').<P>Once I dinged 51, SHeal got replaced with Remedy... and I find myself using the level 49 AE Heal a bit.</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#f7f7f7"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Dikmer</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial"> <BLOCKQUOTE><font size="1" face="Verdana, Arial">quote:</font><HR>Originally posted by Darianne:<BR><B>Once I dinged 51, SHeal got replaced with Remedy... and I find myself using the level 49 AE Heal a bit.</B><HR></BLOCKQUOTE><P>While I agree with the Remedy part, I find I only sit and mem Word of Healing when the Fit hits the Shan and eveyone is down 2 bubs.

Celestial is more effecient up to 1600hps so you should probably use it unless you timing your complete heal to hit when they go unconcious.<P>Dump Gheal, I was so glad to unload that spell. Assuming you are on Kunark you will need Sheal even for casters.<P>I kept reso loaded, it is great for topping off casters, especially the enchanter. As long as you don't use it on yourself the timing of your buffs is not impaired.<P>That group heal is a hog, never found an effecient or sensible use for it. Even under AE spells it most sensible for the support classes to stay back. I only used it for entertainment. I don't know if Hbond is more effecient but I prefer it for loading ease.<P>------------------<BR>Teir' Dal Vicar<BR>Tallon Zek</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#dedfdf"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Tarf</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">I would suggest that you use Complete Heal when possible.  It is just too important of a spell, and it is extremely important to have the timing down right.  1600hp I think is the cutoff.<P>I hate using greater. It is significantly faster then sup heal, and greater in conjunction with cel heal might be all you need.  If you have a shammy, druid or pally you are grouped with, ask them to mem greater and hit the casters as soon as they go down half a bubble.<P>I mem sup and cel heal all the time.  Comp when I have a tank that merits it.  Greater never.  I have excellent back up healers though, and they do have greater memmed.  Simply because it is faster. <P>I keep two slots available for heals, 3 when I have CH memmed.<P>Tarf</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#f7f7f7"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Tundar</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">I have never used reso/hero etc. as a way of healing.<BR>The specialisation is just not high enough, and the hp's healed are too few compared to what other spells you can mem - even GH, but that subject has been discussed ALOT here on these bpoards.<BR>Also, our hp/ac buff will not override the druid skin-line, so be careful when using buffs for heals!<BR>But the most important reason is I tend to unmem my buffs and replace them with stun/root/dispel magic/etc. to be more versatile to the group.<BR>Heck, you already got 3 heals memmed (sup, CH, CelHeal), no need for more.<P>Depending on the situation, I would skip SH instead of GH if your enc is taking alot of hits and you need a fast heal.<P>Main conclusion must be:<BR>CelHeal can replace SH or GH in most situations.<P>------------------<BR>Regards <BR>Tundar of <A HREF="http://hem.passagen.se/dlarsson" TARGET=_blank>Familjen</A> on Bristlebane<BR>Dwarven vicar of no small potential</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#dedfdf"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Laeth</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Traveling alone:<P>1. Greater Healing<BR>2. Celestial Healing<P>- Greater healing for quick remedy and celestial when I have time to regain life and I'm severely hurt.<P>In a group with 50- tanks playing their first character:<P>1. Greater Healing<BR>2. Celestial Healing<BR>3. Superior Healing<P>- Fresh tanks tend to panic too much or run out of range while I'm locked in a CH effectively killing themselves.<P>In a group with experienced tanks / High level pet:<P>1. Greater Healing<BR>2. Celestial Healing<BR>3. Complete Healing<P>- My favorite. Approximate CH to hit at around 1 bub allowing warriors to maybe get a critical in. Always keep in mind what you are fighting and what is happening around your group, switch to heals that will have your tank's hitpoints hover around 3-4 bubbles when nukers or AE dealing mobs are around.<P>- Complete healing is also great on high level pets. Watch out though - new server side filtering placed a greater delay on the pet health updates.<P><BR>With your emergency heal (gem #1) you need to anticipate what will happen in the next few rounds. The split second you see the mob facing one of your weaker characters, you might want to start healing so that your heal lands right as the damage is done mending the wounds while you are getting prepared for the second round of punishment (depends on the mob of course). Your heals should be bound right next to your movement and sit/spellbook buttons and you should have the person who you assume will be getting hurt next targeted. Generally its a good idea to switch between group members during the combat always having the person who you think will require the next heal on lock. This reduces your response delay and sometimes saves a few lives. Often healing after you see hitpoints go down is not enough, by the time your heal goes off you will be remedying second round of combat placing target at 2-3 bubbles and falling behind, thus 3rd or 4th round will finish them off (casters mostly) if the tank fails to taunt off. Always predict what will happen next and stay in the 3rd person view (since you don't have to move around much) watching out for trains and adds.<P>Good luck!<P>- Laeth<BR>- Luclin <P></FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#f7f7f7"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Darianne</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">  <BLOCKQUOTE><font size="1" face="Verdana, Arial">quote:</font><HR>Originally posted by Dikmer:<BR><B> While I agree with the Remedy part, I find I only sit and mem Word of Healing when the Fit hits the Shan and eveyone is down 2 bubs.

A lot... but sometimes.  I've been blessed in Seb groups with C2 and a bard quite a bit, which gives me a bit of leeway.  Naturally CH and even CelHeal are better to use in a perfect world... but the fact is, sometimes a bunch of casters get hit... or enough wimpy mob AE's start to add up... if I see a bunch of people drop at once, and I have the mana, Word of Health it is.  <P>Word of Healing is a nice heal... basically if you have 4 people, each with more than 500 damage, then its *ALMOST* a 4:1 ratio like Cel Heal.  (500hp/member for 600 mana).  If 6 people are all hurting for over 500 points, it's definatly an efficent heal, but yes, it's a mana hog.<P>Anyhow... to clarify, Word of Healing is NOT a *main* heal for me... but I do keep it memmed when I can, for when lots of people do get hurt at once, because it is an efficent heal.<P>----------<P>About CH... I have a respect for Complete Heal... even on some fully buffed casters it's the most efficent heal (muhahhaaha, "Complete Heal inc on Wizard, hope he can last 10s!")... but I personally hate the spell... I hate such a long cast time, and the large mana cost.<P>I know how to use it... I know pretty much when it's a good idea to use it... but I don't *like* it.  I do what I need to do which includes CH, and I know CH plays a huge role...  that's the way it is.<P><p>[This message has been edited by Darianne (edited 03-29-2001).]</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#dedfdf"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Napper</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">I usually have 4 heals memmed:<P>Celestial<BR>Remedy<BR>Divine Light<BR>Complete<P>There is usually never enough mana to use DDs anyway and i only mem the buffs at buff time.<P>You might from time to time wonder why you have one or other of the heals memmed, but they are not all there for when everything is going well.
