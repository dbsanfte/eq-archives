<TEXTAREA NAME="ReplyMessage" ROWS=10 COLS=45 WRAP="VIRTUAL">[QUOTE]Originally posted by Etumaru:
[B]I also think the Forest loops are a great idea. You will have to kill many of them but I find alot drop off the giants in FV more than FM. If you run right off the bridge and keep running you will come across a small fort with 3 giants in it. The loot drops are awesome and you can save a load of pp that way.

There is also the Gatorscale leggings you can kill for. These dropped the first time I killed him, no one was camping him at that time.
Leggings : 
AC7 WIS: +5 HP:+15
Found in Upper Guk off the rare spawn Ancient Crocodile. 

If you like to travel there is a decent hand item as well, good for secondary slot.
Ancient Sensate Eye
+4 WIS +4 INT +2Sv Disease 
Dropped in Paludal Caverns off of The Reishicyben. 

All of these are killable at your level and may be a tiny bit better than what you have (I didn't take the time to look at the stats of your current stuff).

The main reason for this is that I don’t have a 50+ level character to twink myself with (this is my first character).  I don’t mind because I like adventuring for my equipment.  The problem is when I ask other clerics about equipment, their answer is almost always to save money and buy something from another player.  I don’t mind buying some minor items, but I would much rather get the items myself.  Also, I rarely have over 1,000 pp (the most money I had at one time was 1,600 pp).<P>I would appreciate any tips on what new equipment I should start working to obtain (quests or drops).  I always adventure with two friends (a ranger and necromancer my same level).  We primarily adventure in “old world” dungeons, but I’m sure I could convince them to travel elsewhere for nice equipment... especially if ranger or necro equipment is there as well  <IMG SRC="http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/smile.gif"><P>For reference, here is my current equipment:<P>Head: Skull-shaped Barbute<BR>Face: Platinum Ruby Veil<BR>Necklace: Warden Symbol of Tunare <BR>Earring 1: Jasper Gold Earring<BR>Earring 2: A Hollowed Pixie's Rib <P>Shoulders: Adamantite Epaulets<BR>Arms: Vambraces of the Fervent<BR>Wrist 1: Bracers of the Reverent <BR>Wrist 2: Bracers of the Reverent<BR>Hands: Gauntlets of the Ardent <BR>Finger 1: Platinum Jasper Ring <BR>Finger 2: Platinum Jasper Ring <P>Chest: Chestplate of the Constant <BR>Back: Aegis of Life <BR>Waist: Girdle of the Holy Wanderer <BR>Legs: Greaves of the Penitent <BR>Feet: Boots of the Reliant <BR>  <BR>Melee 1: Centi Warhammer <BR>Melee 2: Charred Guardian Shield <BR>Range: Small Wisdom Deity<P>Thank you<BR></FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#f7f7f7"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Serenya</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">I'd say you're in pretty good shape actually.  The ones I thought of are 1) hunting giants in Kunark for the forest loop (same wis as the jasper earring plus some additional useful stats, particularly for a dwarf) and 2) the orc fort in Velious (the zone between ice clad and gd?) for the Gauntlets of the Black.  While you're in Velious go hunt the wurms in GD for Celestial Healing, or check out the Tower of Frozen Shadow for fun and Turning of the Unnatural.</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#dedfdf"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Andok</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Thank you for the tips, Serenya  <IMG SRC="http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/smile.gif"><P>I agree that I have good equipment for a self-made guy.  I really wanted to know “what now?”...<P>I had a shopping list of items that I was working to obtain since level 20 (Ro armor, jewelry, etc).  After finishing the Aegis of life quest this week, I realized that I had completed my entire list.  I started asking around so I could make another “to do” list, but everyone just recommended that I buy stuff.<BR></FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#f7f7f7"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Serenya</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">If you like questing start in on the Thurgadin Shawl quest.  While the shawl isn't particularly good at lower steps, at step 4 you can get a seal which makes a very nice ranged slot item.  I understand that there is now a Qeynos Badge quest series with good results as well, but I'm afraid I don't know anything about them.<P>You didn't mention your race -- if you are a small race I actually like the Dusty BP, which drops in Frontier Mtns, better  then the gold BP.<P>If you hit the Orc Fort in Velious, also keep an eye out for Ry'Gorr Chain leggings -- same AC as your gold ones, but with hitpoints and a different selection of resists.  For questing, there are the Thurgadin quest leggings involving the Brood Mother.  If you're trying to do the shawl quest you'll be killing wolves in GD, and might get a shot at the harness needed for the leggings.  This is particularly popular item with druids and rangers, so should keep your ranger friend happy.   You'll also need to pay a visit to Crystal Caverns (zone in inside the orc fort) for this one.<P>It's been a while since I helped someone with the leggings, and I've not done the shawl quest yet, so I'm a bit vague on the details I'm afraid, but there are plenty of guides floating about for both.<BR></FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#dedfdf"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">ixif</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Also if you're small race get a Belt of the Centobite.
