</FONT><HR>Just going to post this overhere so it doesn't get glossed over since this thread seems to be the new "what clerics want" thread.<P>First post:<BR>I know a way VI could fix the entire cleric's-can't-solo issue in one fell swoop, and they wouldn't even have to add any new spells (though an undead snare or slow would be N-I-C-E). There is even a basis for it looking at AD&D, which is what EQ is supposed to be based on, originally. Druids and shaman would be unable to complain, and fun would be restored to the life of high level clerics everywhere. What is this ultimate panacea? Quite simple, really:<BR>Tag all heals except CHeal (and WoR, obviously) as damaging to undead.<P>And there would be singing in the streets, birds would chirp and rainbows would fill the sky. That one simple little thing would once again open up the end game for clerics. We would no longer be considered by raid leaders only as "do I use him in a Cheal chain or to throw spam heals??" Soloing would be as viable for us as any other caster class, especially the priest classes. There is a solid reasoning for it-the divine power that can heal the living can equally destroy the undead. We would have usable AoEs (AoE heal = AoE undead nuke now).<P>Oh yeah, and one more thing-fix the freeking symbol quests that aren't working/put in ones for the religions that don't have them. So far, this and diety-specific jewelry/idols are the only thing differentiating the choice of gods for us. Throw everyone this little bone, at least.<P><BR>Second post with a bit more info on my reasoning added:<BR>I contend that clerics/druids/shaman (being priests) *should* be the most powerful class when it comes to killing undead, with clerics being slightly ahead of the rest of the pack. The turn undead AA ability was a step in the right direction for us, but I think it needs to be expanded upon.<P>/roleplay on<BR>We weild the power of our gods-a cleric should be a truly awesome force when faced with a horde of undead. Any person devoted and pious enough to have reached the upper levels of the priesthood should be a shining beacon of light (or menacing beacon of the dark forces for out evil brethren) in the dark, evil places where the undead hold sway. Undead beings should cringe at the sight of us and whither at our holy touch, ripped apart by the very power that serves to mend the wounds and stem the bleeding of our living companions.<BR>/roleplay off<P>I would also contend that Torpor would be a better spell than CE. Think about it-Torpor is 300 less damage for 100 less mana, but also adds in snare/slow/mana reduction. Nature's Recovery/Touch for druids would also be amazing spells-1Kish DD and 900 DoT. Though I agree that all these spells would be truly awesome against undead-I also feel that they should-level 59+ clerics/shamans/druids should be able to rip through undead foes as easily as necromancers destroy living foes.<P>When you consider the fact that these spells only work on a limited set of creatures (undead) and that our spells vs live mobs would still be much less than optimal, you're not really unbalancing us when compared to other classes, just opening up moer options for us. Wizards would still be the kings of DD vs live mobs (and vs undead in many cases), shaman/necros/mages would still have the edge on us in damage due to having useable pets. Druids/wizards would still be the masters of quad-kiting and transportation. <P>In other words, you would be expanding the role of all the priest classes (since druids and shaman also get heals) and opening up some more options for both soloing and grouping for clerics.<P>All without needing to add new spells, abilities, etc-you would just need to add an extra bit to the spells that currently exist.<BR><P>------------------<BR>Higar Mettlebender<BR>Vicar of the 54th Prayer and Luclin Loot Ho<BR>Weilder of the Water Sprinkler of Nem`Ankh<BR>Guardians of the Keep<BR><A HREF="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=20669" TARGET=_blank>Higar's Profile</A><BR>Master Drinker (200) <BR>Master Jeweler (188)Master Fletcher (185)Master Brewer (175) Master Smith (175) Master Potter (168) Master Tailor (163)Master Baker (162) (Anyone got any dragon meat lying around??) <BR>Proud wearer of the 7th prayer shawl.<BR>Coldfyre <BR>Warrior of the 14th Blade<BR>Grandmaster Mule (255) Grandmaster Trader (255) <P>Drinal Server <BR>"These balls are making me testy!"</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#800080" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#f7f7f7">

</FONT><HR>this is hilariuse... people putting down the res spells because it will premote bad clerics? wtf? ok I can see leveling up a lvl 14 for THE HOLE so he can revive lost raid parties.. how ever the chance of anyone takeing the exp hit of a 0xp res at such levels is very very slim. I know I sure as hell would rather summon and rebreak rather then take a 0xp res. (especialy for some suck place like the hole). Besides I dont think theres any race that starts out none kos to the hole. why would people be bringing halfling rogues down there if it would be just as much effort to bring any other race down there thats not kos?<P>as for there being to many resurections (think 2 people mentioned this) I belive it has to do with the inability for resurections to change with level. Our nukes and our heals actually heal more when we level up requireing slightly less new spell upgrades. I guess they cant do the same in resurections. I think the way the resurections are now is just perfect.. any anyone saying the low level ones (20 and 30xp) are worthless can stfu and delete their clr now cause they have zero-clue. remember guys.. this is BETTER for clerics 1-49 accross the board! this introduces revive (0xp) earlier and gives xp resurections earlier. <P>Erik, to answer your questions on the spells...<P>Your right.. 58 uses more mana per damage/stun then 49.. but did you forget you can chain them both? or how about the fact you can pretty much now keep a mob peramanently stunned bu chaining all your stuns now?<P>Judgment is pretty screwed.. its only use afaik is when your on a raid in a group thats dosnt require much healing, it allowes you to get that extra damage in and hope to kill steal and get some exp.<P>as for the undead Dot's... im surprised so many people havnt figured this out. well.. i'll let you guys in on a secret since the grey has been nerfed (and i dont mean the AE thing). Dot's dont break root. sure you can nuke but youll be re rooting the mob right after and you will prolly take some damage. or you could use one of your strongest roots that will hold the mob for MINUTES and just cast the Dot.. sit and med, stand and recast when it wears off, sit and med.. repeat untill dead. I was soloing skelis in the grey useing this method but they did a 2nd hidden nerf where mr was slightly increased and hps was increased. also more rockies tend to roam the undead areas.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#800080" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#dedfdf">

</FONT><HR>Most clerics generally have 2 spell gems permanently used up by Divine Aura and Divine Barrier, correct? In reality then, the average cleric only has 6 spell gems at his disposal to use for swapping spells around.<P>How about that at level 50, Divine Aura and Divine Barrier become disciplines with the same refresh time the spells have now. This would open up 2 more spell gems to clerics to swap in other spells for, making us somewhat more flexible. IMO, this is just as good for us as increasing the number of spell gems available overall.<P>Artereis Kyhtalin<BR>Xegony</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#800080" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#dedfdf">

</FONT><HR>First of all, let me say that I realize we're seeing these proposed changes totally out of context (with respect to both other changes to clerics, and changes to other classes) so take the below with a grain of salt.<P>Stuff you asked about:<P>Smite changes - Good stuff.  A power increase, albeit a small one, to our nukes, which could do with an upgrade.  As a level 40 I can still solo low blues (And occasionally do, as a break from the leveling grind.), and this will make that a bit easier and is certainly welcome.  On a related note, a similar small upgrade to our undead DD line would be welcome, to keep those two lines of spells balanced with respect to each other.  All that said, a magic resistance debuff of any kind would be highly desirable.  Even aside from DDs, having my root resisted 5 times in a row, and the 6th breaking after 2 seconds makes me wish I hadn't tried to cast it at all.  And that's on a blue.<P>Resurrection Changes - Mostly good stuff, but I'm not sure about all of it.  As a L40, I don't have the "good" XP rezz yet, but I'm looking forward to it.  That said, remember that rezz is one of our "prestige" abilites, and an XP rezz even moreso.  I think I'd rather wait until 49 for my next rezz than get an "in betweener" at 44.  Also, as an impoverished cleric I often rezz for donations, and I'm a tad worried about what a spell every circle would to the market for rezzes.  However, this would certainly give lower level clerics a power boost, which I'm in favor of.  So I'm of two minds on the issue.  Either way, I'm in favor of the L14 no xp rezz spell.  Put it in there.<P>I also agree with several people above that this seems to have two intended effects, and may only accomplish one of them.  It will almost certainly make dungeon exploration more convenient and thus popular at lower levels.  But I'm not sure it will do much to make clerics more desirable than drus/shams as healers in lower level groups.  (Begging a cleric who's not in your group for a rezz is currently the norm, I don't see that that will change much.)<P>Either way I like the idea of the XP percentage showing in the confirmation window.  There's some confusion now, and if the number of types of rezzes is increased, it will certainly get worse.  The trend seems to be toward giving the players more information anyway.<P>As to the paladin rezzes, my thoughts sort of depend on what else you guys are doing.  By themselves, I'm against them.  CHeal and XP rezzes are really the only unique aspects of the cleric class.  They're the only things we get that no one else does.  Giving XP rezzes to paladins steps on our toes, with regard to class abilities and uniqueness.  That said, I'm all for broadening the classes somewhat (see below), and if the cleric class is broadened some then I'd be fine with paladins being broadened to include XP rezzes.<P>Stuff you *didn't* ask about, but that I'll talk about anyway:    <IMG SRC="http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/smile.gif"><P>Defense - Our dodge skill cap should almost certainly be higher.  Int casters get the same dodge cap, yet we're a plate class and supposed to be able to melee somewhat.  By the same reasoning, a *small* increase to the caps on our weapon skills and offense and defense seems in order.<P>Group Buffs - I'm still amazed that clerics don't get a group buff anywhere in the spiritual armor line, and we don't get *any* group buffs until level 52.  Certainly we should get some group buffs by level 39, and perhaps even as early as 9 or 14.  And a group buff anywhere in the spiritual armor line would be appreciated.<P>On a related note, another line of buffs usable on others (just 1 more) would be awfully nice.  Anything really; short duration (5-10 min) small increase in chance to hit, short duration small increase in damage per hit, anything.<P>Uber level heals - Now that I've gotten Complete Heal, I really don't have much to look forward to in the way of heals other than Celestial Heal.  The higher level heals, Remedy, etc., don't really offer much other than a tiny gain in efficiency (a couple of percent).  I'd happily settle for those heals having the same mana/hp efficiency as Superior Heal in exchange for a significantly faster cast time.  Similarly, below raid levels our AoE heal spells are very specialized.  You need at least 3 group members to be wounded, and wounded enough for that amount of healing to be efficient in order to use it.  Even something minor like increasing the range would make the earlier spells in this line see more use.<P>Class Roles - I realize that EQ is a class-based game, but somewhere between initial design and now the classes have gotten EXTREMELY narrow.  Clerics are perhaps the biggest example of this, we really only do one thing well enough to speak of:  Heal.  I understand your desire to maintain inter-class dependencies, that's why I agree that clerics should not get an invis spell.  However, one of the things that makes a game fun is versatility, the ability to do something new every day.  I think the overly tight class roles are the main reason most people have so many alts.  I'm not saying every class should be jacks-of-all-trades, but a little diversity of function would be welcome to most people.  Well defined roles is a good thing, being straitjacketed into those roles is not.<P>Soloing - Clerics are the worst solo class in the game, and this has several effects other than the obvious "we need to group for XP."  First of all, while I wouldn't want to use soloing as my primary method of gaining XP, it's a nice change from grouping for variety's sake.  And while at level 40 I can just barely solo low blues, it's a near thing (half health and OOM when I'm done with one).  In 5 more levels, I doubt I'll be able to solo XP giving mobs at all.<P>Second, lack of soloing ability makes doing quests more difficult.  Many mid-level quests involve camping mobs that don't provide very good loot/xp other than the quest item.  I hate to ask several other people to group with me so *I* can get a quest item, with little potential reward for them.  And often without a group I can't even get to the mob in question in a dungeon.  This actually gets *worse* as I level past the intended level range of the quest.  I'm too high to group with people who could get the minimal side rewards of camping the quest mob, and people of my level now get no rewards for the camp.  And I still can't solo the quest mob.<P>Finally, it contributes to the "impoverished cleric" syndrome.  Yes, in part clerics are poor because they have to buy spells and plate-class armor.  But we're also poor because we can't solo mobs for loot.  Ignoring farming of high-demand items (like the FBSS), which I'm against, many classes derive a significant portion of their income from soloing green mobs for their standard loot (plat, weapons, etc.) so they don't have to split it.  Clerics can barely do this with LOW greens, and even then it takes too long to kill a mob for it to be effective.<P>(Sorry for the long rant.  I hope Verant keeps asking players for their opinions, and that this initial information overload doesn't dissuade you.)</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#800080" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#f7f7f7">

</FONT><HR>I like the changes on the Strike line of spells.<P>I have concerns about confusion on the rez line though.  I think lowering revive to 14 is a wonderful idea, but I believe that paladins getting it so much earlier than they did before is not quite so good.  I'd prefer to see the Pally spells moved back 1 more circle for them.<P>Also, while you are working on the rez spells, is there any way we can get a message as to WHICH corpse we just cast on?  All the other spells show the target name after the spell has been cast; the rez line of spells does not.  It's not such a big deal now that I have my epic, but it sure was annoying when doing large numbers of rezzes prior to that.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#800080" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#dedfdf">

</FONT><HR>just a small post before bed. baradur, rez's are allready given to palidens, heck at 57 or 58 they get resurection, the %90 one. of course they are steping on cleric toes.. they ARE clerics. Sure rangers dont get ports (thought it might not be a bad idea), but the paliden population is really takeing a hit. a good pali is hard to fine these days as a high level, they get a low amount of stunage, some ok secondary healing... and low range buffage. infact the only reason the pali is anygood at this moment is because paliden only spells were introduced. Atleast now with some xp resurections to look foward too, there life might be a little bit easier. <P><BR><P>------------------<BR>---<P><A HREF="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=32524" TARGET=_blank>Magelo Profile</A></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#800080" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#f7f7f7">

</FONT><HR>Only thing I have to add (hope this already hasn't been said) is that definately fix Divine Light, or give us some kind of new heal.  Remedy doesn't heal enough, while Divine Light takes too long.  It makes it harder to keep your casters alive.  <P>Also raise our 1hb, and 2hb to 200.  Shamans can raise their peircing to 200.  I do not see why other priest classes can't have their melee skills raised as well.  That will make us a bit better at swinging our hammer or mace, but won't be too overpowering.  <P>As far as our defense, I think it should be raised, nothing to drastic maybe like 10-20 points.  Also raise our dodge, it's ridiculous that it caps at 75, that's the same as casters.  You would think as a plate wearing class that you would be able to dodge a bit more hits than someone in a robe.<P>Last thing is give us more utility spells.  The mark lines are a very good idea.  Perhaps take a look at our lull line, it would be nice if this line of spells were actually useful.  Also please take a look at our higher (50+) level nukes/stuns.  The mana/damage ratio isn't on par. <P>Ok so I think I repeated some other clerics here, but hey I was too lazy to read every post!<P>Natosha<BR>60th Cleric<BR>Drinal Server</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#800080" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#dedfdf">

Please do something about our AA skills, our utility besides healing and our healing.  <P>CH is great for tanks, but whats our alternative for casters?  DL.  4.5 seconds for 900 hp's.  Give us something that can save the life of a caster.<P>L58<BR>1500 hitpoint heal<BR>400 mana<BR>2.0 seconds<P>L60<BR>3000 hitpoint heal<BR>500 mana<BR>4.0 seconds<P><BR>L60/49<BR>Group CE/CelH<P>Both of these are grossly under effecient compared to a CH, but they give us at least a fighting chance at keeping someone alive.  The Rez changes are going to be very welcome for the younger still growing clerics, the nuke changes mean I can land something before Team stabs is looting the corpse, but the big issue has got to be heals.  More, better, faster!  (compared to DL)  Better is not always about efficiency ratio's.  <P>Thanks!<P>------------------<BR><A HREF="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=18964" TARGET=_blank>Grumbles</A></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#800080" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#dedfdf">

</FONT><HR>I like the rez changes.  I agree about giving young clerics the ability to revive earlier.  <P>I also think having too many choices will confuse people.  Simply giving Revive earlier  will be fine, imo.  I dont know that this will get people to venture into dungeons.  It isnt just the rezzing, its the corpse recovery.  The whole "2 hours of downtime if we mess up" issue.  Perhaps a summon corpse for clerics? And none of that "that's necro's area" junk.  They have a rez, clerics can get a summon corpse.<P>As far as changes to the dd- thats nice, but I dont see it doing much to alleviate the linearity of the class.  I'd like to see more of the Mark of Karn/Mark of Retribution "think out side of the box" type of spells.  But I cant think of what, LOL.<P>I play a lot with the same 3 people.  If I play my rogue- we have a 60 druid to do the healing, which works really well.  We have a chanter to slow, two melee to finish the fight fast and 60 druid to heal.  I use Leo for when we adventure into new zones and dont know how fast the damage will be dealt.  But beyond that- he is a rez mule for my friends.  <BR>I think that was Verants intent- to provide more group choices for people.  But to have him so easily replaced (for regular xp groups- not raids) should be a wake up call.<P>Shaiel<BR>60 heirophant<P>Leonidas<BR>57 Templar<P>Anneli <BR>54 Rake<P>Niccolla<BR>15 Monkette</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#800080" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#f7f7f7">

</FONT><HR>Heya,<P>  Thanks for the feedback, I've been reading it all and pondering it.  If I don't get to your post, it doesn't mean it was a bad idea at all - just some ideas are easier to accomplish, and some would need a lot of thought before they went in.<P>There were some good points raised all around, and here are some additional things that are up on Test Server now-<P>Judgement: Increased the damage to 925 points for the same 325 mana cost.  Prior to the change, the spell was not a reasonable upgrade to Reckoning.<P>Enforced Reverance: Increased the damage to 300 points for the same 200 mana cost.  Other aspects of the spell are unchanged.  This should make it a useful upgrade to Sound of Force.<P>The concerns about people being confused by the names of the new Resurrect spells are quite valid.  The programming team is going to see about adding the percent of experience returned to the Resurrection consent box. <P>As with anything on Test server, there's no guarantee it will make it to Live, but rest assured the EQ team is hard at work on improving the game.<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#800080" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#dedfdf">

</FONT><HR>The one bad thing I see with the Smite changes is it makes it harder for a Cleric to remove a spell, mem a nuke, nuke and unmem the spell.  Obviously not too big of a deal, but it does make it so that Clerics can't just pop in a nuke as fast as before.<P>Oh, and Rich.

</FONT><HR>Jahaar<P>Thank you very much - for posting here AND following up on it. I think thats an extremely good business decision.<P>The change to Judgement is great - making it 2.8 dmg/mana seems fair and makes it a true upgrade.<P>Since you are looking at dmg ratios it might be nice if you could look into the fact that our undead dot has a WORSE ratio than our undead dd - while the standard for other classes is that a dot has a significantly better ratio. <P>For a comparison: (Since our dd/dot are the highest upgrade we get I have compared to the next higher level druid dd/dot)<P>Exile Undead (55) - 725 dmg 250 mana = 2.9<BR>Epitah of Life (52) - 750 dmg 275 mana = 2.7<P>Frost (57) - 762 dmg 250 mana = 3.0<BR>Winged Death (53) - 1287 dmg 350 mana = 3.7<P>Infact, seeing I assume we are supposed to do well vs undead I think it would be in order to change both Exile Undead and Epitah of Life to match the stats of Frost and Winged Death respectively - or atleast change Epitah to 1000 dmg for 275 mana = 3.6.<P>------------------<BR><A HREF="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=4264" TARGET=_blank>Mikar of the Nexus</A><BR>High Priest of Brell<BR><A HREF="http://companions.windsofstorm.net/" TARGET=_blank>The Companions</A><BR>The Tribunal<p>[This message has been edited by JanSorensen (edited 03-13-2002).]</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#800080" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#f7f7f7">

</FONT><HR>Jahaar the issue with enforced reference isn't so much the damage efficency, its the fact that stuns of this nature are of no particular use in the high end game.<P>There really are two types of stun, those for emergency and control, and those for preventing gaters.<P>Control ones are handled fine by stun command, and sacred word.<P>Gaters however are more problematical.  The recast time on stuns is so high that in order to actually keep a mob stunned for its last 20% of its life, it takes a substancial number of stun spells, which often a cleric can ill afford to use and provide healing coverage.<P>Enforced reverence would be much better served as being a gate preventer, in order to do this it would require fast cast time, damage is of little importance, and it would have to have a fast recast time/perhaps even none.  Since this could get abusive I would suggest removing the stun component completely from the spell and make it a spell interupter only.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#800080" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#dedfdf">

</FONT><HR>Jahaar why not just have a single rez spell and make the amount of xp restored solely dependent on the clerics level and not on the spell itself. You could just increase the amount of mana and time it took to cast the spell as you increased the amount of xp restored. That way you could have a sliding scale of xp restored and bridge the gap between spell circles. How about (lvl-10)*2% xp restored...<P>There is no reason ever to use a lower circle rez spell than the one you currently have so I don't see how any of this could be a problem.<P>Apart from there being too many spells now I think the change is good. Though for a few laughs I'd like to see paladin rezzes requiring expensive gem components...<P>I would also like to see the changes applied to the smite line applied to the undead DD line as well.<P>Oh and make epitaph of life more efficient please... it isnt that much better than banish. I'd like to see an undead DOT with a damage ratio greater than 3.5... after all we are supposed to own undead.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#800080" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#f7f7f7">

</FONT><HR>The only problem I see with these wonderful new changes is that it will make it REALLY hard for a high level cleric to make any money on doing rezzes once he hits 39 and 49. It would be no different than giving ports to a level 14 wizrd or druid. The higher level wizards or druids would see their cash flow go completly bye bye. Also to give rezzes to paladins (even if they have to wait any longer), totally disgusts me. The rez in the firsdt place was only given at high levels to a paldin for showing his/her devotion to his god. Now rezzes are thrown around like water for paladins, and even necromancers.

</FONT><HR>Humm... as some other said, fewer resses then suggested with % on them.<P>Judgement at 925 sounds ok though it is still only a toy.<P>Now as for other issues... I am a plate wearing class, I strap on big parts of metal on me exactly as a warrior or a paladin and yet so is my defense lower then a rogue or a ranger... How is that? And while we are at it about ac, how come I am about as bad as tank with 1k ac as 1.2k ac. Those 200ac makes no real difference for me if I try to tank. Many melee are in agreement of some sort of ac cap exists and the current rumor is that for healers so is it at 950ac. Now true or not so should the fact we are wearing PLATE armor have some effect when I try to tank a mob (esp. green things, also look at their nuking. A Green level 30 gobbo should not be able to nuke me for 200+ when I got over 100 in the particular resist).<P>Paladins are suppose to be 25% cleric and 75% melee, can I then be 25% melee and 75% cleric? I do more damage with MoK and proc (VP 295dd hammer, one to two procs / fight) on a green mob then I do in melee damage to them and i takes me minutes at level 60 to kill (with melee) a low 30s mob. I want to be able to actually defend myself esp. as I wear plate armor and wield a big mace swinging it to defend my god! Somehow so do I belive the gods aint exactly in favor of us defending their faith on anything but discussion.<P>Look at the highend game... I have yet to find a single encounter where I do exp where I would bring a cleric over a shaman. That includes CT (revamped), Ssra elites, Fear break in with 1 group to do exp on full spawn (hey, the zone is free from trains by others at least) etc. Lets face it, CH is nice and all but if you need 4 to do a CH chain on that raid only and not the rest of the time so is the fun of cleric disapearing. It is not that hard to do a boot for CHing (level 39 is enough). Also would be fun to see healing spells that are beyond CH... Something like 3k heal for 600m with a 5 sec casting time. It is a caster type of heal allowing you to use something above divine light when a caster starts to tank a mob.<P>As final note, when a melee leaves NToV with a few weapons so will he have increased his value to the guild by a big chunk. He will also have no problems to start soloing (even without fungi) rather well. If a caster (esp. cleric) leaves NToV with equal amount of gear so will he have a slightly increase in mana, hp, resists and still solo as bad as he did before (2 level 45 mobs on 1 manabar with few resists using all undead dots... for 1 pixel in AA with 100% and downtime there after). If clerics aint needed in groups then give us something to allow us solo resonably well. Look at a shaman, he got the option to solo, group and bring something to a raid (and yes before you say it, I do have a shaman that I am leveling up) why can not clerics move closer towards that option. I dont want to be a shaman but I do want to have options of what to do and not feel I am slowing the group down or wasting my time trying to solo.<P>Dangrim, 60 cleric</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#800080" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#dedfdf">

</FONT><HR>Thanks for looking afer us clerics. I like the changes however, at the risk of sounding ungrateful it isn't enough. As someone posted earlier I am and "old" cleric and since the release of RoK our role and abilities have changed very little. Sure with RoK, Nalton became Marzin, Shield of Words became Bulwark of Faith or Aegis and Resolution became Heroism. With SoV all these bcame Ageolism and with SoL came Blessing of Ageolism. Our resist buffs became substandard we were given some inefficient dots when stacked don't even reach 1k damage. We (and thanks you I really mean it) were given the Elixer line of heals. Nothing beats an Elixer for sheer flexibility in healing. Remedy was a good add and Divine Light is quite franky too slow and too ineficient for regular use. All in all clerics have stayed pretty much the same we still buff, heal and res with some upgrades with expantions and actually we lost ground to other classes in what were once patented cleric abilities.<P>What I would like to see as far as changes:<P>1) A self only invisiblity, lets face it clerics are one of the minority of classes in game without and invisiblity of some sort and the only caster class without it. Without travel utility spells and no true offensive capability a cleric survives by avoiding trouble. Invisiblity would make sense from both gameplay and RP standpoints.<P>2) Review our AASP class ablities. One or two gems are in our class specific abilites but, for the most part they are toys with no real practical use. As an example, Invisiblity to undead. Outside of L Guk on the dead side I cannot think of a zone that does not have "live" or "summoned" mobs sprinkled about to prevent any significant invis to undead movement. I thin in terms of class specific AASP I would much prefer something like a reduction in cast time on heals ability or even an ability that increases range of heals.<P>3) A nice mid-range heal say 2k-3k would be much appreciated as well. <BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#800080" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#f7f7f7">

</FONT><HR>Ok on to the followup. The change to judgment looks good, I could go for a little more damage though since it is our last nuke and the scale you guys are useing for mana:damage on the cleric spell is still based on old world mob HP, so this spell still pretty much sucks in sol and veliuse and its many uber hp mob. <P>Now for the stun... I think you guys are really starting to miss the boat here. Our stun spells could be so much more if you did 2 things to them.. A) remove the damage! I would so much like to use these puppys with an enchanter around... and B) Remove the knockback! I generaly never use anything but normal stun because the high level stuns moves the mob so much, it gets moved OUT of the melees range.. this generaly means 2-5 seconds where my TANK is not hitting the mob! this is one reason I love my rightousness hammer, 100 point stun and it dosnt move the mob. Also the damage on the stuns only give it a 2nd much UNEEDED resist!<P>BTW peoples.. please no wish list... so many peeps asking for invis.. how about we fix invis undead? %50 of the grey is undead yet invis undead dosnt work on %100 of them. there is simply a huge lack of mobs in the game in which invis undead works. ive NEVER used our AE invis undead spell and i got it when I was 51! ive also never used our improved invis undead spell (which btw is self only, which im pretty sure is a bug, but since no one has any mobs to use it on, no one knows or cares)<P><BR>*edited due to bad content*<P>------------------<BR>---<P><A HREF="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=32524" TARGET=_blank>Magelo Profile</A><p>[This message has been edited by Dalur - Veeshan (edited 03-13-2002).]</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#800080" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#dedfdf">

</FONT><HR> im sorry but these changes while they appear to be very nice are perhaps as bad a thing as can be done to young clerics as there is . i really dont beleive there was much thought put into this at all . here is why i think so .<P>1) the changes to the strike line of spells is simply a net gain of nothing . the spell casts faster which is meaningless because if a mob is beating on us and we are nuking rather then rooting and stepping away and nuking then the person isnt to smart . and the recast time is made longer so net effect is same spell slightly altered in the way it casts . no mana effeiciency change . no change to the insane resist check against mr of higher lvl mobs . <P>2) and this is the one that really concerns me for the lower lvl ppl and the one i think needs serious reevaluation . the addition of more resses . giving these spells to paladins at the suggested lvl will seriously undermine lower lvl clerics . why you ask ?? lets examine resserection .<BR> resserected characters return to there corpse asap with some restoration of lost exp which is fantastic . but the down side is you lose all mana and have res effects .now lets say im in a typical lvl 25 or so group outside paw and a caster dies .now being as he is a caster of course he bound right near where we are fighting right 8) . now i can res him and give him a small amount of exp back and he will lose all his mana and have to med for 4 min or so to get that back . how many mobs can you kill in 4 min at paw??? i will bet that we can make up his lost exp in the same timeframe .<BR> now if a tank dies we can just bring him right back to the action and res effects wear of in a minute and we are right back to rolling . <BR> so our net for using the res is a big hit to caster mana for a small amount of exp . or getting our tank back and getting exp rolling in again .<P> now these are the worst lvls for clerics as druids / shaman are often chosen as healers over clerics as we have similar heals through these levels and druids / shaman bring much more versatility to the group then a cleric does . now doing the above math so to speak if you have the option of a paladin or a cleric at this camp who would you choose ??? i would take the paladin everytime . he brings healing to the group . he brings decent buffs . and he brings more damage to the group . and if someone dies??? well he can just res em back and we will get there exp back from death in 5 min or so . the thing is that mobs have to be damaged to kill em . i have yet to see a mob that i could heal to death .<P>if you are seriously considering giving away the class defining ability of clerics you will have to give serious consideration to massively upgrading clerics damage dealing abilities to compensate because you will have marginalized low lvl clerics right out of a job .<P> clerics do 3 things and we are the best at them . we heal . we buff . and when it goes to hell we res . this is all we do . we dont slow . we dont snare . we dont sow . we have no utility to speak of . what we do we do better then anyone . we are a very 1 dimensional class . chipping away at that seriously undermines us as a class .<P> i am all for changes to help lower lvl clerics . lord knows they need it . but the changes that are suggested do not help in the long run . while they look nice on the surface if implemented in the present form with paladins getting res sooner it will ultimately damage a very restricted class already .<P> garthin <BR> 58 cleric <BR> The Shadow Order<BR> Lanys T'vyl</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#800080" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#f7f7f7">

</FONT><HR>just a follow up to what I posted yesterday.  first I would like to say that while i would like a self only invis, better melee abilities, better nukes, making da and DB skills instead of spells along with much improved def abilities these items are really not needed for a cleric.  as it is with our buffs and armor we are pretty well set for traveling, and defense, atleast opposed to other caster types, so invis is not needed, and while the other additions would be a nicity to soloing, it would potentially unbalance our class, clerics are groupers not soloists, we do healing buffing and rezzing and thats about it.  the things that I honestly think would benifit our class would be as mentioned before removing damage from stun so i can work with the enchanter better, perhaps an improvement to the lvl 19 heal we got with SoL to help our positions in this lvl range against shammys/druids, and a group line of buffs like a group symbol at lower lvls say 30ish.  Changing the rez line will just cause more problems for us, as mentioned before in the lvl range you want to give it it just hurts our class, and doesnt give much to the group other than more down time for minimal if any real exp return, and in the pre 35-40 area exp return isnt that important I can get 50% back in no time in a good group even at 35, now post 40 is a different story, besides that shouldn't the rez line be given to the clerics that have proved their worth to their god? (if your moving revive to lvl 14 group ports for wizzies and druids should also be moved to that lvl range).  Also I just ask that you please listem to all concerns posted on this board.  thanks for your time.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#800080" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#dedfdf">

</FONT><HR>I think these changes will make people who try and abandon clerics out of frustration by level 15 or 20 keep going. I know that I sure had a tough time in my teens getting groups and feeling useful, and I started my cleric after a year and a half of experience in EQ.<P>I'm not worried this will significantly cut into the rez for cash market: hasn't everyone gotten the message at some point that your X% rez isn't going to be good enough after all, since they've found cleric_01 who can give them more xp? But it will increase the appeal of clerics at lower levels, it will also make some semi-distant zones seem more palatable for players (reducing the crowding in Oasis, LoIO, etc.).<P>I also think your proposed changes to the Smite line of spells would be welcome. It won't make clerics simple to solo (I don't think anything really should). It will make it easier to get off a nuke under pressure, which is the only time I'm really worried about that line of spells.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#800080" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#f7f7f7">

</FONT><HR>I think "fluff" is the best description of these changes. I've been a level 60 cleric for a year now, and none of this is going to make her more interesting to play. Judgment will do more damage but have a slower recast time -- I'll still only be able to get at most one nuke in on a raid mob.<P>Please make changes that matter. Give us invis OR make invis potions stackable and cheaper, as well as allow shaman to make stacking invis potions for us. <P>Un-nerf BPs -- Donals is 30 sec cast time on one target every 7 minutes? Stupid. You could at least reduce the cast time; it's not even practical to use in a CR situation since you can med a complete heal that fast. Or change the effect on it to Invis; even warriors get an invis BP. Put something on the Velious BPs more exciting that MoK, which casts too slow anyway.<P>We also need more cleric drops that have value -- I am so sick of seeing great 1HB weapons drop that are not cleric usable. And if a cleric can use them, a warrior will always claim need. Most of our cleric loot is no drop, so we have nothing to sell and make money with. Remove the peridot requirement for aego so we don't keep eating the cost of buffs on raids and in groups. Give us a line of armor or weapons that we can sell, just as you do for all the other classes.<P>The level 60 Luclin spells drops are insulting; all this time and still no group aego. The Ancient spells are just a minor upgrade in what we already have. No thrill there. Give us an interesting new buff or skill -- like a skill AE Rezz for raid wipeouts. Give us a means to solo since you've upgraded druids and shaman and pallies to the point that clerics are unnecessary for groups now.<P>Give us something new, something useful.<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#800080" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#f7f7f7">

</FONT><HR>First I'd like to say that if these changes are the START of balancing Clerics, then bravo.  They bring some interesting tidbits to the low-end game, and I'm not going to argue a shorter cast time on DD spells.  Now, if you really want to make me happy, adress Undead DD and DoT spells as well.  A lot of clerics with a lot more experience than me have raised valid points here.  Just let this be the beginning of the changes, not the end.<P>-Daeneb</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#800080" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#f7f7f7">

</FONT><HR>I think the changes to res benefit the entire game more than they specifically improve the cleric or paladin.  The changes to the smite line are nice, but I can't see as they add all that much to clerics since from the point we get cheal to the point we log off from boredom, we're healers and ressers and that's about all we get to do.<P>I agree with what another old-timer cleric said.  Clerics are too narrowly defined and are boring to play in the end game.  <P>Give us something REALLY COOL to do.  </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#800080" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#dedfdf">
