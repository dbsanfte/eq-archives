<TEXTAREA NAME="EditedMessage" ROWS=10 COLS=45 WRAP="VIRTUAL">I two box all the time, although I try to get in my regular play time as well.  

After one too many nights of things ending early or not getting started at all because of a lack of a healer, I decided I was going to try a cleric even if it meant not playing my main sometimes.  I just wanted to have the option.  That night Fattima was born on my wife's account (the intention being that my wife would actually sometimes play the character, hahahahahaha....)

My main is a 57 Ranger.  When I made Fattima he was high 40s or low 50s, he PL'd her a little and twinked her a little but for the most part she was on her own by level 14 and didn't get any decent gear until 25.  

Well around 30 I found that I wasn't enjoying the pickup group scene anymore.  My first career being melee I often found myself annoyed at watching them make the mistakes I'd made at the same levels.  I needed something new, like a regular group.  Well I started to hang with some guildies on our designated "twink night" but it wasn't enough.  I had some serious burnout as a Ranger and needed a real break.  

I had this Iksar Necro who was 25ish at the time, and I'd been playing him more and more lately as I'd been feeling a bit anti-social.  I decided to give 2 boxing a try with him one night.  I started out doing nothing but using Fattima to buff the necro and his pet, and heal them between fights.  (This was as much to avoid some faction hits as it was to keep things simple.)

Along the way I got better at it.  I moved on to more challenging camps.  I took time at every level, in some cases for multiple levels at a time, to go play each of my characters in a "normal" setting - grouping with my cleric and soloing AND grouping with my necro.  Occasionally people started sniffing around, wanting to hang out with me.

Eventually Fattima caught up enough to group with my Ranger.  I tried it a few nights but her heals were just not enough to keep things rolling at 37.  She went back to grouping with the necro until she hit 42.  Most of that time was spent 2 boxing in what had become a regular group.

Well now I group Fattima with my Ranger all the time, but I also let her tag along and soak XP off my necro.  I have become fairly practiced at 2 boxing and I do not hide what I am doing from anyone.  I tend to be pretty controling about how my groups work, but I have developed a /friends list full of people who are fine with that and trust my ability to play two characters well.  They know that if I need to be focusing on healing and being a cleric that that is what I will do.  

I can count on one hand the number of times I have let someone other than myself die while I was 2 boxing, with either the necro or ranger.  Each any of my characters died it was because I had been pushing the limits of what my duo or group could handle, and ultimately had very very few deaths.

Playing two characters at a time can be stressful, but it is a lot of fun too.  Personally I like a cleric as a second box character because you can just hang out and duo (solo really) or you can form a group and do something interesting.  If it comes right down to it the other char can stay home and you can just be the healer that night.  Let's face it there's one other thing:  it's tough to beat having a rez available every time you die.
