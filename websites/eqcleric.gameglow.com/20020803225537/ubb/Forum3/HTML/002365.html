</FONT><HR>If I missed any, let me know.<P>Innoruuk: 3 quests (CLR/SHM).<BR>Tunare: 3 quests (CLR/DRU).<BR>Cazic-Thule: 2 quests (CLR/SHM).<BR>Brell Serilis: 2 quests (CLR) with 1 more foreshadowed in the game already.<BR>Rallos Zek: 1 quest (SHM).<BR>Bertoxxulous: 1 quest (CLR).<BR>Tribunal: 1 quest (SHM).<BR>Quellious: 3 quests(CLR).<P>Quellious: Erudin<P>Initiate Symbol Quest: Say to Leraena in the Temple of Peace in Erudin "what more powerful kobold shamen?" She will then tell you to gather 8 "odd bone necklaces" from "a lesser shaman" in the warrens. Place those in the box she hands you, hit combine, and hand them to her for your Initiate symbol. The lesser shaman are 9 - 11 and drop the necklaces about 1/10. <P>Disciple Symbol Quest: After completing the Initiate quest, reply with "I am ready to deal with the greater kobold shaman."  and Lareana will tell you to return with 8 "odd bronze necklace" which drop off "a greater shaman", combine them in the box she hands you, and turn them in with your Initiate symbol for the Disciple symbol. The Greater shaman are 13 - 17 and drop the necklaces about 1/7 or so.<P>+3rd Symbol (uncompleted): After receiving your Disciple symbol, say to Leraena "I am ready to advance." She will tell you to return with the High Shaman Drogik's symbol -- it is "odd cold iron necklace". The High Shaman is 22nd level and drops the "odd cold iron necklace" about 1/2, but occasionally drops more than one.<P>Hand the "odd cold iron necklace" to Leraena and she will give you "odd bronze necklace" and "a sealed parchment" and tell you to take the note and the necklace to "Glyssa Sonshaw" in Freeport. Hand in a "odd cold iron necklace" and the sealed parchment to Glyssa and she will give you another "sealed parchment" as well as another "odd bronze necklace" and commands you to seek out a kobold in Ak'anon. <P>After handing your cold iron necklace and note from Glyssa to the kobold in the bar in Ak'anon, he tells you to seek out "a kobold missionary" and retrieve the "doctrine of Roflon Zek" and then return with that, a note he gives you, and your disciple symbol of Quellious to your temple.<P>The kobold missionary spawns at night near the mino caves in steamfont. He drops a lore/no drop/magic "encrypted document" every time.<P>Return with the encrypted document and the note you received from the kobold in Ak'anon and turn them in along with your disciple symbol of Quellious to receive your Regent Symbol.<P>Note: This is bugged. Everyone hands you "odd bronze necklaces" but they all expect "odd cold iron necklaces". The solution is that you must have at least 3 "odd cold iron necklaces" in order to do this quest. <P>Innoruuk Neriak<BR>Initiate: High Priest Perrir Zexus wants you to prove your worthiness. He wants you to collect 4 Halfling woven grass amulets to prove your worthiness. These can be found on Halflings in Nektulos Forest. <P>Disciple: This is done after completing the initiate quest. <P>Hail Ithvol K'Jasn and tell him 'I am an initiate'. He will tell you to go and slay Master Whoopal in Nektulos and take his head to Draxiz in the The Tower of the Spurned. (Master Whopal spawns at a Totem Pole just west of the bridge near the shore. His placeholder if Questor Dunden.) Slay him and you will get a Halfling Head. <P>Return to Neriak Commons and give the head to Draxiz. He will give you a mask, which looks like a head, that will give you 1 guise of halfling. <P>Now head down to West Commons and look for an npc halfling called Wallin Slyfoot. He wanders a bit, but usually ends up on the path near Kitchor. When you find him active the illusion spell and tell him that you will assist him and he will give you a letter for Master Whopal (Hehe..he's dead) <P>Now return to Neriak Commons and give Draxiz this note. This will cause the Leatherfoot spies to spawn. They spawn in a small room behind the waterfall near the PoD. Kill them (there may be two) and one of them will drop another Halfling Head. <P>Return to Neriak 3rd Gate and take this head and your Initiate Symbol to Ithvol. He will reward you with your Disciple Symbol <P>Note: Dealing with Draxis will lower your Dead Faction. It is a small hit but if you are Dub, then think twice before doing this part.<P>3rd symbol: This is given after you complete the disciple quest. <P>Hail Ithvol K'Jasn and tell him 'I will deliver the provisons.' He will tell you to go the Neriak Foreign Quarter and tell Dran Slug Rembor that 'Ithvol sent me' <P>Travel to West Foreign Quarter and tell Dran ‘slug’ Rembor, 'Ithvol sent me' Dran will ask you for 2 steel bonings. These can be made with the blacksmithing skill. After you give the bonings, he will hand you a crate and says 'Heres the crate of provisions. Take this to Dragoon Szorn in the Lesser Faydark immediately! <P>Travel to Lesser Faydark to the camp at (loc -900, 1155) and give the crate to Dragoon Szorn. He will hand you a receipt and ask you to find the [missing shipment]. If you ask about it he will tell you to 'Seek out Ennixy and tell her [hate be my guide]. She typically works from her homeland in the steamfont mountains.' <P>Travel to Steamfont and talk to Ennixy Frennor (a gnome at 1350, -850). You say, 'Hate be my guide' Ennixy will ask you to slay a paladin named Crusader Swiftmoon. He will spawn right near her. After you slay him he will drop the missing crate and his head. <P>Travel back to Lesser Fay and take the crate back to Dragoon Szorn and he will give you a Voucher of Services Rendered. <P>Travel back to Neriak 3rd Gate and give to Ithvol the Voucher, the head of Crusader Swiftmoon, the receipt for the provisions, and your Disciple Symbol of Innoruuk. Ithvol will then give you your Regent Symbol of Innoruuk. <P>Brell Kaladim<P>Initiate symbol of Brell<BR>Go to the WARRIOR guild in kaladim and look for Bronlore Lightblade. Tell him you are a priest of brell, and he will ask you to get him 4 bead necklaces of the new goblins who's attacks are of the highest calibur. He's talking about the new *enraged goblins* that spawn in a cull-de-sac near crossroads in BB, loc ~neg 400, pos 400. Spawn time is 18 minutes, goblins are ~level 20. <P>Disciple symbol of Brell<BR>Second in the line of symbols for Brell, This requires some travel and some help if you have fought Sir Lucan. Tell Bronlore that you are ready for your next task, and he asks you to deliver a note to an old friend of his who is on vacation in Oasis. Warning: you MUST ask what note to get the note. when you get the note, he casually mentions that his friend is grumpy and will not talk to you unless you bring him his favorite drinks. You will need: Dwarven ale, Elven wine, and Freeport stout. Take the booze and note to oasis, and the dwarf you need to deliver to is near Sro, in the corner away from the ocean, holding a fishing pole. when given the note and booze, he will talk about an old recipe he lost. Asking about this, he will reveal he had a dream as to where to get the items, and will send you to get them to make the beer, and also to bring him a rat sandwich to nibble on, and your initiate symbol of Brell.<BR>BEER:<BR>Ask him what cask, he will give you a "holy cask" 4 slot combine container. He has told you where the components are: <BR>Preserved Hops: named ghost in unrest, looks like a dwarf. <BR>Battleworn cantine: Undead brewer in unrest.<BR>Forest Barley: Kithcor merchant.<BR>Summoned water: spell<BR>You can not fail on making the keg of beer.<P>3rd symbol: unknown<P>Cazic Thule Paineel<P>Initiate: Sern Adolia wants you to bring him some rat livers to study. These drop from undead rats in the newbie area. Bring 4 of them to him for xp, faction and The Initiate Symbol of Cazic Thule. <P>Disciple: This is given after the initiate quest. Atdehim Sqonci wants you to bring him a Giant Snake Fang, Kerran Doll (drops from more than Kerran priestesses), Ichor of Wooly Spider, and your Initiate Symbol and he will reward you with the Disciple Symbol of Cazic Thule. <P>3rd symbol: unknown<P>Tribunal Halas<BR>Inititate: Give Jinkus a piece of Mammoth Hide Parchment (from Cindl - Ask her 'what mammoth hide parchment?'), and a bottle of datura ink (from Greta outside Smokes and Spirits - Ask her 'what ink?'). <P>He will give you a wanted poster. Take this to one of the Bank guards in Qeynos. They will give you a List of Qeynos' Most Wanted. <P>Return this to Jinkus for Initiate Symbol of Justice, exp, and faction (+ShamenofJustice, +MerchantsOfHalas, -CircleOfUnseenHands, -CoalitionOfTradefolkIII, -EbonMask). <P>The symbol is barbarian shaman only.<P>Disciple: unknown<BR>3rd symbol: unknown<P>Tunare Felwithe<BR>Initiate: You say, 'hail Yeolarn Bronzeleaf' <P>Yeolarn Bronzeleaf says 'Hail, Angelsyn ! <BR>We of Tunare are charged with protecting the Great Mother from the forces of Innoruuk. Even now, the evil minions of this foul deity are despoiling our great forest. Will you help us [protect the Mother]? <P>You say, 'I will protect the Mother' <P>Yeolarn Bronzeleaf says 'Just outside the gates of Felwithe, the forces of Innoruuk gather in the guise of decaying skeletons. Bring me four sets of bone chips as proof of your vigilance. I assure you, your faith shall not go unrewarded. <P>Give him the bone chips <P>Yeolarn Bronzeleaf says 'Praise Tunare! I knew you would be victorious. I reward you with this spell, and pray that it will help you in your fight against the unholy forces of Innoruk. When you are ready you will make a fine [Initiate of Tunare]. <P>Your faction standing with ClericsofTunare, KingTearisthex and Anti-Mage got better. <P>You say, 'What Initiate of Tunare?' <P>Yeolarn Bronzeleaf says 'The Teir'Dal behind the undead plague in our forest have discovered a means of creating a terrible undead called a Ghast. These Ghasts have been sighted in the Lesser Faydark and must be destroyed. Bring me four of the vile creatures hearts. <P>Give him four Ghast hearts! <P>Yeolarn Bronzeleaf says 'I requested four Ghast hearts! <P>Yeolarn Bronzeleaf says 'Praise Tunare!! You have done well young Initiate. Here the symbol of your station within our faith. Return to me when you are ready to [slay the necromancer] that has been creating the undead.<P>Disciple: You say, 'I will slay the Necromancer' <P>Yeolarn Bronzeleaf says 'The Fier'Dal rangers that inhabit the Lesser Faydark have spotted a courier making deliveries to the Teir'Dal camp near Castle Mistmoore and to a necromancer that lingers near the ancient obelisk. We believe that the crates he carries are supplies needed for the creation of more Ghasts. Another shipment should be arriving soon. Seek out the necromancer at the obelisk and take his head then take the head of the courier and return them to me with the crate that the courier carries and your Initiate Symbol of Tunare. <P>The courier is making deliveries to the Teir'Dal camp near Castle Mistmoore and to a necromancer that lingers near the ancient obelisk. We believe that the crates he carries are supplies needed for the creation of more Ghasts. Another shipment should be arriving soon. Seek out the necromancer at the obelisk and take his head then take the head of the courier and return them to me with the crate that the courier carries and your Initiate Symbol of Tunare. <P>Yeolarn Bronzeleaf says 'I require the head of the necromancer, the head of the courier, the crate the courier carries and your Initiate Symbol' <P>Bring the two heads and the crate back to Yeolarn. <P>Yeoolarn Bronzeleaf says 'Praise Tunare! The Mother smiles on you this day Disciple Angelsyn! I present you with the symbol of your new station among the Priests of Tunare. Return to me when you are ready to become a [Warden of Tunare]. <P>3rd symbol:You say 'I am ready to become a Warden of Tunare. <P>Yeolarn Bronzeleaf says 'The crate that the you recovered from the Courier contained this black candlestick that radiates an aura of great magical power. I request that you deliver the candlestick to Lady Trilani who is studying with the High Men in Erudin. Perhaps she can divine the nature of the candlestick and offer aid in defeating its power. The remaining contents of the crate have been given to Crusader Swiftmoon to be delivered to a gnome in steamfont that is purchasing them on behalf of the Eldrich Collective. When you return be sure to present your Disciple Symbol to me with anything that Tilani may ask you to deliver. <P>Taking the Candlestick to Tilani (The Mystic Cloak Quest NPC) in the Erudin Palace gives you this... <P>Tilani Palrone says 'I sense a great evil power in this candlestick. I will need you to concoct a divinatory aid for me before I can discern more. Take this suspension and brew it in a brew barrel with one white hellebore (dropped by Gnolls in Split Paw or SK), a pouch of the red dust created by the Fire Peak Goblin Wizards, and the caustic substance used by the Dark Offerers in Mayong Mistmoores wicked castle. <P>-- Note: The pouch of red dust seems to drop off random goblins in Solusek's Eye. It seems like every goblin has a chance of dropping it. <P>-- Also, all of these items are no drop, and you can usually just ask people hunting in the zones to let you loot them. <P>Your faction standing with KeeppersoftheArt, KingTearisthex and FaydarksChampions got better. Your faction standing with TheDead got worse. <P>Get the ingredients and brew them and take the result back to Tilani. She will give you Un-animation Powder. Take this powder and your Disciple symbol back to Yeolarn: <P>Yeolarn Bronzeleaf says 'Praise Tunare!! I will have our sorcerers examine this power immediately to see if we can reproduce it in quantites enough to eliminate the undead plague. I award you the rank of Warden of Tunare, the All Mother smiles upon you Illilliae !' <P>Rallos Zek Oggok<BR>Initiate: Zulort asks for 3 mystic dolls and the medicine bag dropped by lizard man mystics and will then make you an initiate of Rallos Zek.<P>Disciple: unknown.<BR>3rd symbol: unknown.<P>Bertoxxus Akkanon<BR>initiate: The quest begins with Evah Xokez, cleric trainer of the dark reflection faction in the mines of malfunction, Ak'Anon. No brackets are provided, but if you are "willing to learn" she will give you a vial and instruct you to spread the plague by using it to infect a female rat, a new mob type in Steamfont. It is necessary to charm this mob in order to complete the next step, otherwise the rat will reject the vial due to unsuitable faction. Perhaps there is some cleric spell which will adjust faction to the point where a solo player can complete this step, but I do not know of it. Give the vial to the charmed female rat, and receive an empty vial and experience in return. Give the empty vial to Evah Xokez, and she will reward you with faction, experience, a container, and another task. <P>The second task is to collect four items and combine them in the container, then return the combined container for the Initiate Symbol of Bertoxxulous. The four items are gnomish spirits, a sprig of wormwood, and two diseased bone marrow portions. The spirits can be brewed using the brewing trade skill, or purchased in Ak'Anon. Diseased bone marrow is found on brittle skeletons, a new gnome sized skeleton mob in Steamfont. They can be found in the area north and west of the windmills. I noticed a great many more spawning after I began to buff the newbies in the area, so I presume they have place holders. Not every skeleton has the marrow, perhaps one in five do. The sprig of wormwood is obtained by hailing a NPC in the Steamfont Mountains named Ennixy Frennor, and asking about wormwood. She is a static spawn, found north and west of the windmills in the vicinity of the brittle skeletons. <BR>Disciple: unknown.<BR>3rd symbol: unknown.<P>------------------<BR>The patchwork cleric<BR>Domus Divinae<BR>Prexus<P>[This message has been edited by Gniss Fleshmender (edited 08-06-2001).]<P>[This message has been edited by Gniss Fleshmender (edited 03-03-2002).]<p>[This message has been edited by Gniss Fleshmender (edited 03-03-2002).]</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#f7f7f7">

</FONT><HR>Rivervale is very big on Karana.  Didn't try there?<P>And very big on Bristlebane, who is a common cleric diety and has no discovered symbol.<P>Humans have a very large religion selection and it's not inconceivable that a Karana quest may begin in Qeynos or Freeport, likely the former.  Rodcet Nife is a common cleric diety there and has no discovered symbol.  Mithaniel Marr is very popular in the latter, and a popular choice for clerics, but has no discovered symbol.<P>There are a ton of dieties aside from Karana and the collection Gniss did great work to put together.  In time I'm sure Verant will get to all of them.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#dedfdf">

</FONT><HR>I'm a human cleric of Karana from Qeynos.  I've been waiting/looking for the symbols since they came out.<P>I think since Karana isn't a highly chosen god, the Karana symbol will be implemented last.<P>Maybe if Verant ever implements the plane of disease, like the plague story line hints towards, I'll get a super symbol of Karana from a quest involved in the plane.
