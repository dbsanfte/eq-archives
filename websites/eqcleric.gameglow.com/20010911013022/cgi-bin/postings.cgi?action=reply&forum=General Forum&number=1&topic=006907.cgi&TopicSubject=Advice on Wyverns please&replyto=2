<TEXTAREA NAME="ReplyMessage" ROWS=10 COLS=45 WRAP="VIRTUAL">[QUOTE]Originally posted by Derenath:
[B]I'd suggest you solo elsewhere. The drakes' aggro range and AE nuke/strip is a death warrant for any class that can't invis themselves. And believe me you will run into drakes.

There's no safe zone close enough to run to if things get bad. Druids and wizards quad kite around there and the less skillful may drop one or 4 wyverns on yer head. The mobs aren't undead and have quite a few hp's for thier level so you'll be medding ALOT. I'd say you're making things unecessisarily difficult for your self. Any positive giant faction you gain wouldn't be worth the effort.

If you're dead set on it though, bind at the zone wall farthest to the right as you face the water near the shore. Any faction hit you take would be -dragon and +storm giant.

If you solo occasionally, go to Karnor's Castle or hit the undeads around Dreadlands. There's enough undead there to make soloing as a cleric worth the time until 54-55, enchanters you can buy clarity from, much safer places to bind, and safer zones to run to. Also, the live critters have fewer hp's, don't hit as hard, and don't AE frost/strip.

I recently obtained my CS key/Tooth and I would like to know about soloing Wyverns in CS.  I am a 51 cleric (wis is 200 with AC873).  Is this practical for me and where should I bind in the zone after entering via the Dragon ring portal to avoid the fun of a death loop  <IMG SRC="http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/smile.gif"><P>My visit to CS was very brief - my guild took me through Sirens to a Raid in WW - we just stopped briefly to get the tooth from the ring - so my experience in CS is very, very limited.  Any advice and tips would be greatly appreciated  <IMG SRC="http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/smile.gif">  <P>Do I take a faction hit killing Wyverns  (I am on Dwarf faction -- those Giants dont like short people I have found  <IMG SRC="http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/smile.gif"> )<P>BTW - I do prefer to group (after all we are clerics) but there are always those times online when we have insufficient time to group effectively and soloing is useful for this at times.

This zone is generally hunted by druids, necros and wizards. You'll find an occasional group here but if you get 4-5 of the soloing/quadding classes there's not much left to hunt.<P>Spells you need to solo here effectively are some form of sow, invis, some form of snare, levi.<P>Now if you want to group here, that's a different story. I grouped here a number of times with a group that consisted of 2 druids, 1 cleric, 1 wiz, 1 paly. The druids and wiz would quad wyverns while the paly/cleric feared seachests and drakes all at the same time. Talk about good exp. Not to mention the gem drops. Of course our group upset quite a few people in the zone since we didn't leave many spawns untouched.<P>As far as taking faction hits...you'll only take faction hits against dragons if you kill the named drake or the named wyvern (this wyvern summons btw). If you kill the otters you'll take faction hits against them.<P>Stay away from the bulthars...way to many hitpoints and pretty good magic resist.<P>Then there's the occasional siren someone drags on the beach....../shiver</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#dedfdf"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Aaric</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Soloing at 51...hit burning woods, or trakanon's teeth.<P>There are a ton of spectre camps in TT that go green at 52ish...and burning woods has a lot of wandering undead.

Wyverns and drakes both use claws of veeshan faction for con, but you dont' take hits off them.  Faction hits are only from the named wyvern (don't think there's a named drake).  Also, drakes can move fast. You want jboots, tboots, or some sow potions.  If you're not kos and can move fast, you're set =) If you're even remotely careful, you can fall and only take a hundred or so damage from the cliff (and you do want to fight on the beach, plenty of room to run). <P>And if you can parter here with a quad kiter when there are few people around, great exp.  You're useful for finishing up a quad or soloing 1 at a time while the partner quads.</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#f7f7f7"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Lyli</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Well, I for one LOVE CS. I think it is a great zone, but not for a soloing cleric. As others have said, there are lots of druids around usually quading stuff and can turn messy if it gets out of hand.<P>However, if you can go there with a tank or two - or a tank and necro, CS is a lot of fun! I go there a lot with a Pally and Necro friend and we usually rack up the exp. Also the gem loots are great. You get gems for quest armor or to sell. <P>So, like I said, I really love CS and enjoy when we go there. However it is not the place to solo. Take a friend! More fun that way anyways. =)<P>Lyli</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#dedfdf"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">MarcussW</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">CS is a great place to go for a 51 cleric if you want to make money.

Then just root and nuke, takes about 4 bubs for you to down one.  The drakes RARELY make it as far as the boulder, and when they do, they turn back around and head back to the dragon portal.<P>I got from 52 to 1 bub into 53 there in a week.  Got lots of gems and a LOT of pp from ressing too.<P>One last word of advice:  AVOID Yvolcarn!!!!  He is 52, massive MR, and hits in the 150+ range.
