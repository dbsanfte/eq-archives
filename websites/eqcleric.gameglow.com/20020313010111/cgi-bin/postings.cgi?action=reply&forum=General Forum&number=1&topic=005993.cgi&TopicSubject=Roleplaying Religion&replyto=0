<TEXTAREA NAME="ReplyMessage" ROWS=10 COLS=45 WRAP="VIRTUAL">[QUOTE]Originally posted by Gandwin:
[B]How many of you out there actually roleplay your worship of a specific deity? I'd like to hear examples of how you do it.

My character is a cleric of Bristlebane, and I've been having a great time pulling pranks. So far, I've mostly just roleplayed through spending a lot of time travelling, meeting new people, telling jokes, and tricking newbies into drinking too much alcohol.

Yesterday, I got two people to drink 5 ales in a row outside the West Freeport gate. I told them they were magic ales. If they drank all five, one after the other, they would get Center and Endure Poison. I cast the buffs when they did it, and they actually thanked me! It was a riot.

Anyway, I love playing a cleric of Bristlebane, and I'd like to hear what you do to make your cleric's religion come to life.

I'm also a master drinker, and am constantly making reference to the other races as "lightweights that would be put in a casket by even one Tumpy Tonic" and other such comments. Many of my RP stories revolve around my adventures in places such as Irontoe's Eats in Kaladim and McQuaid's Stout in Halas. I have a collection of EVERY stein in the game...the only one I'm missing is the new one from the Warrens.<P>I have great respect for the children of Tunare...Mordryn, a high elf cleric of Tunare, gifted me with a Dwarf Ringmail Tunic when I was level 5, just for RPing a discussion with him. I never forgot his generosity, I passed that tunic on a gift to another cleric in a simlar manner later on in life, and I've always been on good terms with Tunare's followers since. BUT...that doesn't stop me from making fun of pointy-eared tree-hugging lightweights who can't carry their armor, and certainly can't drink like a dwarf can.  <IMG SRC="http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/smile.gif"><P>There's nothing that carries RP weight like a good solid curse. Here's a few of my favorite exclamations and insults...<P>- "NAGAFEN'S BREATH!"<BR>- "What in Solusek's fires..."<BR>- "BEHOLDER'S EYES!"<BR>- "Bah, ya smell like a goblin's codpiece." A good generic insult. <BR>- "Yer so birdbrained yer growin' feathers. Yer mom been sleepin' with Krags? I bet yer baby picture is an egg." I unloaded that one on a really obnxious beggar in Butcherblock.<BR>- "Bah, I've drunk water with more kick than this!" Said in response to my first drink of Elven Wine.  <IMG SRC="http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/wink.gif"><P>Then there are some of the holier things I do...<P>- "Brell's blessings on ya!" Usually said to people I buff or heal out of combat.<BR>- When I first went to Kunark, I RP'd as a missionary of Brell sent to convert the native people. They weren't very receptive to me, as you can imagine. I tried the same thing in Velious, but when I found out that the Coldain were already followers of Brell, I assumed the role of ambassador. <BR>- I often accompany my brewing sessions with prayers to Brell and Ol'Tujim...the patron saint of brewing.  <IMG SRC="http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/smile.gif"><P>Then there was the RP fight between me and a necromancer, outside the gates of Qeynos...<P>- "I'd kill you, but I don't want yer blood taintin' Brell's soil."<BR>- "You worship who? The Plaguebringer? OH! You mean...oh what is it...Bertoxisname or whatever it is, right?"<BR>- After I killed him and he repopped, "I see the earth has rejected yer corrupt soul once again."<P>Enough for now, I think you've got the idea.

They are constanly calling me "Master" and "Father" and "Holy One", so I respond with "My son" and "young one" and such.

I fare well, as do my charges. Thank Brell!<BR>/shout Stay the course, young one, and call upon Brell or myself should you need assistance.<P>It's fun.
