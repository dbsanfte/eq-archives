I guarantee that I have done that many more times than received an overpayment in sebilis.  Saying gems should not be a source of income is like saying " ok I will symbol you only in places that drop gems.".. not too many tanks would like that answer.. <P>Anyone that plays a cleric that gives free rezzes, and purchases his spells, armor, and other components realizes that we normally lead a pretty low income life...

I was constantly being handed gems and after 5 gems I told the group "I have more than enough gems to last me the night, please loot up guys".  There were a few remarks such as "Wow, that's the first time I have ever heard that!" and "Are you sure?" "Glad to hear a cleric finally fesses up".  <P>   I have heard from other cleric friends that they make an average of 1-2K a night *profit* in gems when in Sebilis.  This is unfair, stupid and greedy.   Other group memebers need money too (especially monks who cannot carry coins)  I know several clerics who have 10-30K in the bank from these expeditions while I have a significant but lowly 3-5K usually.  The only reason they get away with it is because groups can't afford clerics to leave a group.  Well after a little while in Seb certain reputations will outweigh others when multiple clerics are LFG, guess who's gonna get the invite?  (Not the greedy cleric for sure)<P></FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#dedfdf"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Dannig</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">For me, I usually get the gems to cover the dots used, then tell the ML to alpha split the cash items from there on out.<BR>Most groups LOVE me for that  <IMG SRC="http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/smile.gif"><P>------------------<BR>Dannig   55 Cleric<BR>Dark Elf<BR>Member of The Commune <BR>Xegony<P>group01 "Dannig, heal yourself"<BR>you tell the group "Oh yeah  :) "</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#f7f7f7"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Josiefuz</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">It's obvious the servers vary on this issue.  I don't want all the gems, I just want enough to cover my costs.  If I got all the gems in a seb group I'd make a killing!  I don't want to make a killing, I just want my fair share.  <P>Sol Ro uses the first 3 gems to the cleric.  I usually get in a group and stay there for 3 hours.  This means 1 gem per hour.  At level 54 that meant 18 symbols cast (200pp) for 150-300pp in gems (depending on if you got cheap fire opals or better gems).  In a weeks time of xping each nite I usually came out slightly ahead (less that 500pp ahead).<P>Once I got Symbol of Naltron my symbol costs dropped slightly because I can save a few dots in that same 3 hours.  Given the same scenario I net about 1k-1.5k per week over my dot costs.  Keep in mind it cost me 10k to buy that spell though, so I have almost broken even.<P>Fighting in those horrible zones where symbols are needed but gems don't drop, I pass along the cost to my group.  They either get cheaper symbols (Only naltron's mark, no Martzin) or they find another way to pay me back (more loots, a decent item, or they cough up the peridots themselves).  Just like I don't try to take more than my share from a group, I don't feel it's necessary to give more than my share either.  <P>The bottom line is that we each have a personal decision to make in this matter.  Even the clerics (us) don't agree what is correct.  What one cleric calls greed another cleric calls fair.  Even if we did all agree, what the clerics called fair, some other class would call greed.<P>Let's continue to discuss and share, but not point fingers at each other.  As always, our milage will vary.<P>-Fuz<BR>58 Templar, Sol Ro<BR></FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#dedfdf"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Entare</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Unfortunately, I have to agree with what most of the people had to say about clerics, expecially in OS.  My main is a level 60 magician, who hardly gets played outside of raids.<P>My cleric is only level 44, but since we only have 1 or 2 clerics that don't play that much, I often end up grouping with a lot of 56+ guildmates in Sebilis or Velks.<P>In a tipical evening at necropsis, JUST in gems you can expect around 1kpp an hour.<P>Let me clear something up:  Every group SHOULD pay clerics their components.  What every group shouldn't do is pay for the clerics rare spells and their raid expenses.  If you are grouping with only people in your guild, then by all means loot as much as you feel appropriate, since you will use that money when raiding with them, however, if you are in a group of people that you do not know, you cannot expect them to pay for the peridots that you use when raiding with other people.<P>Magicians hardly spend any money on pearls during day to day grouping, but if you are the only mage in a halls of testing raid you can easily go through 60+ pearls in one session.<P>If I spend money raiding, I just inform the raid leader of how much I spent, and usually I am at least reinbursed partially for the pearls.  I would consider it totally out of the line for me to ask a group of people I didn't know to fork over cash so that I can pay for pearls that I didn't use for them.<P>The money that you get from a group should be equal to a your expenses for the evening, plus a fair share of the rest of the money.  If you had horrible gem drops, lots of dispelling mobs and wipeouts, by all means get all of the gems, but if at the end of the day you can bank 1kpp after paying for your costs, and everyone else banks 100pp, then you are a disgrace to our class.<P>Clerics have it VERY easy with dropped post 50 spells, try being a shaman, or a necromancer.  The 59 pet spell is worth 100kpp on my server.  Does that mean that a necro is entitled to a higher share of the loot because his spells are more expensive?  Some cleric seem to think so.<P>To the cleric that said that he thinks he should get every gem, or the clerics that think that it is allright to bank 1kpp per session, you are A SHAME to your class, you are the ones that give us the reputation.<P>Now, to all those clerics that think stiffing the group is fine, just a question, how many tinker bags do you own?<P>End</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#f7f7f7"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">JesterDK</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Plz guys only post if you know what youre talking about. I mean come on. A level 44 Cleric talking about dots spent ? Get Naltron first, use it for a while and see how you like it then.<P>I run through dots faster than i run through the food. Rarely reimbursed except for when hunting in Sebilis in Guard / NG or whatever its called on your server.<P>I think its a good suggestion to say 3 gems to cleric rest alpha. Nice system and is fair in most camps in Sebilis. But come on. We need to get reimbursed for all the dots we use in the camps in Velketors or in all the other camps were in. This argument will get beaten upon alot, cause "It cant be right i need to pay you for whatever camp you were in last night!". No, it cant. But tough luck, will you prefer if i just say, hey, i will only symbol you after i get paid ? In the middle of combat the warrior goes "Symbol faded" and you reply "well, geeze. Come over here with 11pp and then i will symbol you!" Face it. We get screwed if we dont act like asses some times. <P>I would surely wish that i could teach all the non-clerics out there a lesson.

I mean come on. A level 44 Cleric talking about dots spent ? Get Naltron first, use it for a while and see how you like it then.<P>I run through dots faster than i run through the food. Rarely reimbursed except for when hunting in Sebilis in Guard / NG or whatever its called on your server.<P>I think its a good suggestion to say 3 gems to cleric rest alpha. Nice system and is fair in most camps in Sebilis. But come on. We need to get reimbursed for all the dots we use in the camps in Velketors or in all the other camps were in. This argument will get beaten upon alot, cause "It cant be right i need to pay you for whatever camp you were in last night!". No, it cant. But tough luck, will you prefer if i just say, hey, i will only symbol you after i get paid ? In the middle of combat the warrior goes "Symbol faded" and you reply "well, geeze. Come over here with 11pp and then i will symbol you!" Face it. We get screwed if we dont act like asses some times. <P>I would surely wish that i could teach all the non-clerics out there a lesson. Would be nice if each and every cleric stayed away from camps other than in sebilis where the gems actually are found. Then they would be the ones with the problems and not us. I can almost hear it: <P>"a_stupid_warrior_01 tells you: We need a cleric for a camp in velketors and for some resses, would you consider coming plz?"<P>"You tell a_stupid_warrior_01: Too bad. You guys are the ones who dont want us to break even on gems.

(well, I still had my NO DROP gear)<P>Since then, I have only ever sold 1 item that was awarded to me. I have sold a few other items along the way that were won through /random. Only 1 "major" item, that was a fungi tunic (sold for 35k). Through steady savings and skimping, frugalness, and the profits from smithing, I have gotten myself fairly well equiped.<P>Equipment:<BR>Primary Melee: Paw of Opolla<BR>Secondary Melee: Sarnak Battle Shield<BR>Ranged Weapon: Seal of Thoridain<BR>Ear: Blue Diamond Electrum Earring<BR>Ear: Blue Diamond Electrum Earring<BR>Neck: Black Alloy Medallion<BR>Face: Mask of War<BR>Head: Ethereal Mist Helm<BR>Shoulder: Adamantite Epaulets<BR>Finger: Golem Tear Ring<BR>Finger: Diamond Wedding Band<BR>Wrist: Donal's Bracer of Mourning<BR>Wrist: Heavy Dragonhorn Bracers<BR>Arm: Donal's Vambraces of Mourning<BR>Chest: Breastplate of Forbidden Rites<BR>Back: Aegis of Life (Back)<BR>Feet: Donal's Boots of Mourning<BR>Legs: Ethereal Mist Greaves<BR>Waist: Girdle of the Diligent<BR>Hands: Thunder Etched Gauntlets<BR>Misc Inventory: 3X Bag of the Tinkerer, Large Soiled Sack, some extra resist gear, Fishbone Earring.<P><BR>Now, if I can get myself that well equiped in 5 months, I can only imagine how much money I would have had to buy more and better gear if I had KEPT all the gems I shared with my Sebilis groups. Those clerics that don't share must have 500kpp in the bank.</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#dedfdf"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Entare</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">I still don't understand your point.  I have hunted in Sebilis A LOT more than you I bet with my mage... I went from 52 to 60 there.<P>I am hunting there with my cleric now, even though 44 is normally way to low for a cleric there, since I only group with guildmates it ends up working very well, and the only camp I haven't been to yet with my cleric in Seb is King/Juggs.<P>First 3 gem to a cleric then start splitting is a fine guide-line, which can be finetuned depending on the amount of drops/dispells, etch.  <P>There is no reason why a cleric should make more money than anyone else.  The fact that your spells are expensive isn't a reason.  The fact that you spent a lot of peridots buffing at a raid isn't a reason.  This group has nothing to do with your expensive outside of it, unless you only hunt with guildmates/raidmates, you cannot expect them to compensate you for your other expenses.  What would necros have to say otherwise?  If a necro tried claiming all gem drops because he had to summon all of his last groups's bodies from the mushroom king, what would you say to him?  It is the last group's responsability.<P>Dikmer, my definition of 'stiffing my group' is getting more money AFTER symbol costs than anyone else in the group.  What's yours?</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#f7f7f7"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Niccy</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">I've got an interesting spin on the "I'm not responsible for paying your [guild's] raid costs" line. Sure, maybe you aren't, but who's paying YOUR guild's clerics' raid costs? Why, it's the people they group with in Seb... who just might include my guildmates.<P>So either we have an easy system where everyone funds all clerics, so everyone can raid all the time - or a hard system, where guilds have to exp <I>together</I> in order to be able to finance their raids. I prefer the easy system.<BR></FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#dedfdf"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Gimmel Greatheart</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">In my alliance of guilds we have an entry fee for planes raids, 50pp for clerics/chanters and 100pp for everyone else. All trinkets go to the alliance treasury which goes for reimbursement costs for non-fee raids (like epic raids). The trinkets for a single Hate raid can easily total 5k, which will fund peridots for several raids. It's not that tough, really, and I only lose money on peridots in exp groups, but that is more my fault than anything, since I rarely ask for reimbursment. For me at least, it would be disingenous to ask other people to fund my raids, since we fund them just fine. Taking the first few and alpha after that seems the easiest.</FONT></TD></TR></TABLE>
