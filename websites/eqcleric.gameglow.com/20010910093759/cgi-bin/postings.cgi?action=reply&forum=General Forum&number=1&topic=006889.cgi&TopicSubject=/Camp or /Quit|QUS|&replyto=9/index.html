<TEXTAREA NAME="ReplyMessage" ROWS=10 COLS=45 WRAP="VIRTUAL">[QUOTE]Originally posted by dtatum:
[B]Actually... the benefit of DA/Quit is that you only have to take a beating for roughly 15 seconds tops in order to log, and unless you are the only thing there the agro won't be on you as much during that 15 secs. If you try to camp with DA on, you cast it, its lasts 15 sec, but you have to be SITTING for an additional 15 and if you get hit you blow the whole thing and now have to start over the 30 sec process with one less DA spell.

If you DA and then /q, your LD NPC has 15 sec of no fear just to stand there and then after that if the mobs come back they just have to live for 15 more sec and will be logged out regardless of the pounding they are taking. If you can live for 15 secs you are safe using this method. If all clerics did this the probability of at least one of them logging out before dying is pretty high. Remember if everyone tries to camp, all mobs have to do is run around and hit each of the sitting clerics to make sure that no one lives. Everyone doing DA/q means they have to kill every single one of you in 15 secs or someone will make it out.

I was telling the raid leader it took 5 tries to camp and he told me next time just hit DA and then /quit. Everything I have always heard was never hit quit always camp. The next raid when a cleric camp was called I hit Cel heal and then DA on myself and typed /quit. While both cases I safety camped.

I've seen a linkdead cleric chase an unsnared wurm that ran in ToV halfway to Lenny the keeper, trying to bash it down with his sprinkler, because he was LD but agro from the AE.  Also, if you are LD and a mob agros you with an AE, you dont leave the world til either you or the mob is dead.<P>I tend to use /q only as a last resort when sitting down gets me beat up.<P>Khain</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#dedfdf"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Haxx</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">If you aren't aggro to the mobs yet (and haven't been AE'd yet), and you /q immeadietly, then even AE's won't aggro you... the mobs won't even touch you and you'll be out safely.<P>Like, if you see 384953489 mobs inc, just /q without hesitation and you're safe. DA and DB allows others to get hate, while yours drops... so doing this for ~5 seconds and then /q'ing will sometimes keep you safe.<P>Always try to camp if possible, and *never* /q if you've been ae'd/aggro'd  <IMG SRC="http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/wink.gif"> You'll try and melee the mob down till you die.</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#f7f7f7"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Mirriana_00</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">If you are not currently at the very top of a hate list, you can DA and /q.  DA acts as a hate-lowerer, and you should be able to exit the game.  This only works if someone will be there for mobs to beat on for ~30 seconds, as they will turn on you when you are at the top of the list.<P>However, it is always preferrable to camp out.

I've just recently really realized this..in the past i would keep trying to camp and wouuld always get hit and end up not getting out.   If you are in a situation where the mobs are on other people but they come hit you when you sit down, you won't be able to camp and you should /quit then.    I read that if you are not actually being hit and you DA and /quit you'll always get out.
