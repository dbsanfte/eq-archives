I didnt like it much but had a need for the sum she offered so agreed. Certain agreements and statements were made though.<BR>1. I could have the account back if I ever returned, if I simply reimbversed the money plus/minus compensation for any new gear/levels.<BR>2. That I could use the account well she had it if I asked her.<BR>3. Although not really an agreement it was under the impression she was gonna use it simply for a ress mule for her/guild.<P>Well...my business has been doing well, and im at the point where ive hired people to do things I use to do, and have the freetime to play EQ again (im a lvl60 cleric btw).<P>Well...I came back..my friend was ingame, so I logged in my friends account to talk to her, I told her i'd like to buy my account back, because I was ready to come back.<BR>She got real defensive..and put me on ignore...<P>So i contacted her guild-leader and asked about me...and found out shes been playing him fulltime now, so I understand why shes attached to him now.<P>So im sorta stuck in a dilemna.<BR>On the one hand...I really want my character back(yes I know I probly shouldnt have gotten in this situation in the first place but its easy to say that now  <IMG SRC="http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/wink.gif">)<BR>And a deal is a deal...<P>On the otherhand...shes grown attached to the character, and if I were to take it back by force(i'd still send her the $$ back), that I might earn a bad reputation for "stealing" the account back.<P>Im a regular here, and just wanted an anon name because im embarassed by the whole thing..but respect the opinions of my friends here..so I ask for any suggestions on a course of action.</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#f7f7f7"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Aean</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Well my impression on it is that you both made a deal with certain *clauses* and now she isn't holding her end of the deal. However did you get it in writing? <IMG SRC="http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/smile.gif"> probably not, also i'm with you on the part where she is now attatched to her/your character and doesnt' want to give it up so what if you make her a comrpomise. <P>What if..... you give her back some of the money she paid you, lets say half. In return she will give you equipment that was once yours and powerlevel you to a decent level. I'd asume a really high level seeing as you were 60 at one time, so just as an example lets say 50. Then after that time you are on your own. That'll give you back a cleric and let her keep the one she has grown attatched to, and still let you both be friends. it'll be alot of work but you'll both be happy.</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#dedfdf"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Dalur - Veeshan</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Hrmm<P>That's a tough thing to decide.  While I'm not a lawyer or anything like that, I would think that something "verbal" or elsewise, would be a non-binding contract.<P>Sure you both agreed to do this "upon certain conditions" and this other person should "HONOR" the agreement even though they have been playing the character quite frequently.<P>I guess the person playing your character would have to have a serious change of heart, or you would have to offer a serious amount of money to get them to go back to the agreed upon deal.<P>I DEFINITELY would NOT include Verant in on this.  Considering they are banning people for lesser offenses, they would probably ban both you and the person playing the character for breaking their terms of agreement.<P>Best of luck to you in this really tough situation.<BR><P>------------------<BR>Dalur Stouthealer<BR>59th Dwarven Templar<BR>Veeshan Server</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#f7f7f7"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Aladain</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">The solution is very simple under one provision.<P>Call verant and say that your account has been hacked, and that you have the original CD-Key that the account was activated with (PROVISION being the person you sold account to does not have this key).

You took money, gave account info.  If you take the account back without paying that's quite clearly stealing.

After playing a cleric to 45, I see how addictive they are... but I can ALSO say how easy they are to level... <P>A guildie of mine made a 40 cleric in 9 days playing... thats decently easy... so work a deal with her to get your old cleric for some time to PL you.... if she has any conscience, she knows she owes you the character, but in this, you are having a happy medium....

I must admit, it doesn't make sense to me.  If this person is a friend, why are you on ignore?  I can not think of any person I know on a casual basis that I would expect to honor an agreement.  I would expect a friend to.  What exactly was your agreement?  Was it casual conversation?  Did you make clear that you were coming back in only a couple months.  Was this person thinking that in all likeliehood they were keeping the account with only a miniscule chance of you coming back?  <P>It is my experience that most conflict arises from disparate expectations.  If you and she had the same expectations, there shouldn't be a problem now.  Since there is a problem now, there has either been a miscommunication or a lack of maturity on one side or the other.<P>Personally, if it was me, and I put myself in the situation you are in, I would just start up a new character.  Reputation is everything in this game.  That is why I think no accounts should ever be sold, or bought.  I am not buying one, that is for sure.<P>When I tell a player that I will not group with them because of an event that occurred 6 months ago, and they respond, I wasn't even playing 6 months ago.....  I am still not grouping with them   <IMG SRC="http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/smile.gif"><P>You essentially gave your rep to this person.  Every person who you were ever kind to or mean to in game now looks at her as the actor in that situation.  Every person she has been kind to or mean to gets transferred to you.  It is fun to play characters of all levels.  There are a bunch of new games coming out.  <P>You have a lot of options to choose from.<P>Tarf</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#dedfdf"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Morale Dilema</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Thank you all for your helpful advice...i'll be taking bits and peices of it..i'll take rayne's advice and get in touch with the guildleader and inform them of the situation and ask them to speak to her (why shes ignoring me I truly dont understand...I was chatting with her, brought up the subject, she got defensive about it and suddenly I was on /ignore i thought she was a friend...which is why I agreed to this in the first place...but I guess people show thier true color's eventually)<P>Anyways...I'll try and work out a solution with her via the GL... and if that fails and she continues to be unreasonable will take it back by force, and send her a check for what she payed, plus some for the gear shes gained on him.<BR>Yes it was only a verbal agreement, but it wasnt casual and was made very clear, and after hearing the responses I feel its probly my best action to go for getting my account back if shes gonna be unreasonable and not even talk to me.</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#f7f7f7"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Benezetta PiaAdiuvo</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">It is a violation of your User's Agreement with Verant to in any way "share" an account with someone else, which you agreed to every time you clicked the happy little button to log into the game. <P>I'd recommend you read it, THOROUGHLY, before deciding upon a course of action.<P>Just my two copper's worth.<P>Benezetta Pia`Adiuvo<BR>Tunarian Priestess of 42 Prayers<BR>Paradise Lost/Xegony</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#dedfdf"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Meddik</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Its this kinda stuff that makes a very good case for the EULA.
