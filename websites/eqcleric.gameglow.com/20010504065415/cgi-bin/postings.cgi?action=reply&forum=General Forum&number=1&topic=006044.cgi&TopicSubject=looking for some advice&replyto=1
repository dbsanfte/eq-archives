[B] Vita,

Did fear about two weeks ago, we had 6 groups and only 2 clerics and fought fright (I dont know if he was harder than terror, but was hitting in the 300-500 range).  I sure wasnt expecting it, but when I saw health on the rogue go from full to half at the start, I immediately CHed the warrior (then full) and continued to chain CH him while the shaman in the group superior healed everyone else.  I ended up getting agroed and died, but actually bound right there (we had a bad break, and clerics were asked to bind in fear, so I bound each step of the way).  The fact we had 15 necros there, and 3 mages, the pets actually did most of the dirty work, and fright ended up dying.

Its definately difficult, but if you know you are going to have a fight like that, start a CH early on main tank and start the fight.  Have a backup to handle the other group members, and chain CH on the main tank, interrupting yourself if he doesnt need it.  Thats been the best way I have been able to do it.  I'm sure there is an even more effictive way, but thats the best I can offer for now =)

The raid broke into Fear easily with minimal deaths. I was in a group with a chanter and four tanks, ranging from lvls 47 - 51. They didn't draw aggro too much, since there were higher level tanks along, but when they did it wasn't too hard to keep up with healing them as we cleared the easier things in Fear.<P>Then, we buffed up and fought this big ugly named thing called Terror.  <IMG SRC="http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/smile.gif"> <P>It killed a few of our higher level tanks and so I was healing the tanks in my group as they fought it. Their health went down so fast that it didn't seem possible to use Complete Heal on them. I was chain casting Remedy, and drew aggro and got hit a few times for 400 +, so i didn't last very long, hehe.<P>My question is, how can you heal tanks that are getting hit for this much ?? Complete Heal probably wouldn't have made it in time even if I started casting the moment they drew aggro. Chain casting remedy, which heals for i think about 450 points, is a losing battle when the thing you are fighting hits for about that much each time ....<P>This is the first time I have ever encountered things that hit this hard. How do clerics deal with this situation? I am used to fighting is things that are relatively wimpy, like things in Karnors and Sol B.  <IMG SRC="http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/smile.gif"><P>Any advice would be much appreciated.<BR></FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#f7f7f7"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Aladain</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial"> <BLOCKQUOTE><font size="1" face="Verdana, Arial">quote:</font><HR>Originally posted by vita:<BR><B>Then, we buffed up and fought this big ugly named thing called Terror.   <IMG SRC="http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/smile.gif"></B><HR></BLOCKQUOTE><P>Vita,<P>Did fear about two weeks ago, we had 6 groups and only 2 clerics and fought fright (I dont know if he was harder than terror, but was hitting in the 300-500 range).

I believe he quads for 450 and has an extremely nasty Cold based AE.  The only real trick to him is since he has relativly few hp (by velious standards) you need to do alot of dmg quickly to him before you lose too much of your dmg output.<P>Anyway truthfully against a mob capable of dealing that amount of dmg that fast, a lvl 50 cleric would be really hard pressed to be able to heal tanks sufficiently IF they are actually tanking.  Greater heal doenst heal enough as well as superior heal.  Your best bet would be to chain cast CH and hopefully have 2nd healer (like a shaman with chloroblast) help assist heal.  In fights against Terror I just tend to use Group heals alot, since the AE seems to do signifigant dmg.  Divine Light is also good as well as Celestial Elixer.  Both with are a bit above your level.<P>*just an afterthough* never had celestial healing, not sure if that would be sufficient to cast to give you enough breathing room to use CH.<P>------------------<BR>Jhihad Daemonwrath, High Priest<BR>Xanit K'ven, Vallon Zek</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#f7f7f7"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Gorian</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Ive fought them all bout 3 times since thier  change in the main agro group. <P>Normally  ill go into the fight and stand up near the tanks with DA\DB loaded.

If they are  all geting hurt ill drop an AE heal and Get ready with my finger on the DA button.<P>Normally works pretty well ,but you need to make sure you are not on the top of the list when that DT is coming ... try to save your AE heal for  after a DT is done if you can.<P>Gorian Skysplitter  55 Dwarven Templar -RN<BR>Anomen Furyfist     36 Human Monk -RN<BR>Tyle Dreambringer   33 Highelf Mage -RN<P></FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#dedfdf"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Mirriana_00</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">The first thing to realize is that you can't keep up with that damage output.
