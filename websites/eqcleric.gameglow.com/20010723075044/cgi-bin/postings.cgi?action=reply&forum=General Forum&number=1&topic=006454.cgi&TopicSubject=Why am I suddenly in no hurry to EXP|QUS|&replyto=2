<TEXTAREA NAME="ReplyMessage" ROWS=10 COLS=45 WRAP="VIRTUAL">[QUOTE]Originally posted by Jaldarith:
[B]I know exaclty how you feel, Dikmer.  When I was 54, I was crunching really hard, and working on my epic.  I banned myself from Sebilis, Chardok, and other experience zones, just so I could focus on Ragefire.

I spent 4 weeks camping Ragefire (with numerous server-downs (remember the spontaneous crashes?)), and I just spent every part of those 4 weeks in Nagafen's lair.  I would eventually get a full yellow bubble every 4 FG rounds (~32 hours), but I never really worked on experience.

I got my epic at 55.

I went to Sebilis and got 56, but what's funny is, it took me nearly 2 months to get 57.  I had it all filled up like 5 days after I got my epic, but I was half a [b]blue[/b] bubble to 57 for nearly 45 days.  All I did was questing, raids, dying a lot, getting 4% experience loss, and I ended up taking a month to get that last half a blue bubble.  Sure, I could have got it in 30 minutes if I felt like it, but I just didn't want to do the experience grind.

I have a hard time going back down to those places and looking for pickup groups.  Especially after I grouped with the same 5 people for 2 months straight.  You just learn so much from people who KNOW how to play their classes.  Us 6 could solo things that would take 2 groups, maybe even 3 groups.  We were uber, in a sense.

Currently, I'm no more than a full bubble into 57, and I've been 57 for about 60 days.  Crazy huh?

I could have 60 right now-- heck, I could have had 60 3 months ago, but I just didn't feel like it.


I would call it a burnout.  If you need some time off, take it  ;)[/B][/QUOTE]
