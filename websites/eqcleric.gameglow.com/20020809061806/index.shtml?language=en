<blockquote>
Well it's been a while since we have had an update, but this one appears to be a doozie....<br><br>July 24, 2002 3:00 am<br>                          ------------------------------<br><br>                          *** New Interface Available ***<br><br>                          The new EverQuest user interface is now available for use on Live servers. Many of you will find that it runs faster<br>                          than the old interface. It is extremely customizable, and offers all sorts of features including resizable windows,<br>                          fading windows, a pet control window, and flexibility through the XML files. We decided to offer it for optional use<br>                          as a sort of Beta II for folks on the Live servers that haven't had the chance to try it out on the Test server.<br><br>                          To activate the new interface:<br><br>                          * Log into the game.<br>                          * Type /newui into the chat bar and hit enter.<br>                          * Log out and exit to your desktop and then log back in.<br><br>                          or<br><br>                          * Before you log in:<br>                          * Open the EQclient.ini file in your EverQuest folder with a text editor (notepad works fine)<br>                          * Find the [Defaults] section of the file<br>                          * Add a line that reads: NewUI=TRUE<br>                          * Log in<br><br>                          We want to thank all the folks that have helped us test the interface and have offered a wide variety of useful<br>                          ideas.<br><br>                          Enjoy the interface!<br><br><br>                          *** Bazaar Now Available ***<br><br>                          Those of you that own Shadows of Luclin now have access to the /bazaar and /trader functions. These functions<br>                          only work in the Bazaar. You can find the Bazaar on Luclin, adjacent to the Nexus and Shadowhaven.<br><br>                          /bazaar opens up the Bazaar Search Window, which allows you to easily locate specific items for sale by Traders in<br>                          the Bazaar. /trader opens up the Bazaar Vendor window, which allows you to make items available for sale to<br>                          others in the Bazaar.<br><br>                          You can only use the Bazaar if you have the new interface turned on. See the message above for details.<br><br>                          Again we'd like to thank the folks that helped us test this feature. And we'd like to apologize for the delay in<br>                          delivery of the Bazaar.<br><br>                          We think that you'll find the finished product to be a good one.<br><br><br>                          ** ViewPort **<br><br>                          One of the new commands available only with the new interface is /viewport. You can use this command to change<br>                          the size of the gameplay area.<br><br>                          /viewport [distance from left, distance from top, width, height]<br><br>                          All of the distances and numbers for the viewport command are in the same measure as your screen resolution<br>                          numbers. <br><br>                          For Example: Let's say you are running in 800 x 600 video mode and you want to create view the game only in the<br>                          top half of your screen (not that you would). You would type:<br><br>                          /viewport 0 0 800 300<br><br>                          The top left of your screen is 0 and 0. 800 is the width of your screen, and the 300 is one half of the height of the<br>                          screen.<br><br>                          /viewport reset - will reset the viewport to the default setting.<br><br><br>                          ** New Vah Shir Models **<br><br>                          We have developed new models for the Vah Shir for use with the old world. You may now choose to turn off the<br>                          Luclin version of the Vah Shir models and use these new models if you wish. These new Vah Shir models require<br>                          less memory and you may want to use them in place of the Luclin models to improve system performance.<br><br><br>                          ** Spells **<br><br>                          - Fixed a bug with the bard songs Warsong and Battlecry of the Vah Shir that caused them to slow you down when<br>                          used without other haste components. - Fixed a bug with bolt spells that caused double hits due to elevation.<br>                          Sorry Mages. <br>                          - Removed the "Ahhh... I feel much better now!" message from certain spells when the caster is over level 35.<br>                          -Removed the reduction in damage to Damage over Time spells when used on NPCs that are moving.<br>                          - Mind Wrack will now consider the z-axis when calculating the maximum distance group members can receive the<br>                          beneficial affects of the spell.<br>                          - Song of Sustenance should prevent unnecessary hungry and thirsty messages.<br>                          - Bind Affinity can no longer be cast on any ungrouped player in arenas.<br>                          - The caster of Voice Graft will once again see what is being said.<br>                          - Spells that transfer hit points over time from the caster to a target will no longer take effect on the target (the<br>                          hit point gainer) if the caster (the hit point giver) isn't also affected by the spell.<br>                          - Added a spell effect message to Magician epic.<br>                          - Beastlords now get Endure Disease at level 24 and Resist Disease at 51<br><br><br>                          ** Pets **<br><br>                          - Pet Resistance Changes: Pets will now use their master's level and resistances when saving against spells cast by<br>                          NPCs (against PCs pets will use their own resistances and level as they always have) - unless the pet has special<br>                          resistances, in which case it will use that resistance.<br>                          - Altered pet summoning spells so that they always summon the most powerful pet possible, instead of pets within<br>                          a 5 level range. <br>                          - /pet report health now uses the same user defined color as spell text.<br>                          - /pet report health will now display a list of the effects on the pet.<br>                          - Mage fire pets should now cast their damage shields more often. <br>                          - Wizard, Druid and Cleric pets and familiars can now be buffed by characters other than their owner.<br><br><br>                          ** PvP **<br><br>                          - Fixed a bug on Tallon and Vallon Zek that made player characters in non-human illusions immune to ranged<br>                          attacks.<br>                          - It is no longer possible for PC's to fear other PC's at all on any server. The same was also done for charm.<br>                          - Pets can no longer be affected by charm spells. This should fix the issue that caused charm spells to make pets<br>                          disappear.<br>                          - NPCs who are pets of players and call for help from other NPCs will have their cries fall on deaf ears.<br><br><br>                          ** Alternate Advancement **<br><br>                          - Dire Charm will now send a message to inform the caster that the charm has broken by Feign Death.<br>                          - Spell Casting Subtlety should work properly for all levels of the ability.<br><br><br>                          ** Zone Specific **<br><br>                          - Corrected a problem with a treasure table in Marus Seru.<br>                          - The drakes in SkyShrine should no longer be dropping cloth caps. They should now be producing Drake Eggs. The<br>                          drakes are very happy about this.<br>                          - The mountain lions in Steamfont now have jawbones. They are happier about this than the Drakes are about their<br>                          eggs.<br>                          - Hoshkar should no longer appear as a bag, qualifying him as the happiest of them all.<br><br><br>                          ** Horses **<br><br>                          - Fixed a bug that was allowing characters to change into illegal forms while on horseback, causing some unusual<br>                          displacement problems. Characters will no longer be able to turn into those illegal forms (elementals, for example)<br>                          while on a horse.<br><br><br>                          ** Quests **<br><br>                          - Corrected an issue with the Proudfoot Greaves recipe.<br>                          - The Vex Thal key quest has been changed slightly. Celestial Rifts will no longer be used to create the key - a<br>                          new item replaces them called a Planar Rift. Planar Rifts are acquired by defeating the same creature as before,<br>                          however all future Rifts are going to be No-Drop. <br><br>                          A Celestial Rift can be placed in a forge by itself and 'combined' to create a Planar Rift. Please be aware that the<br>                          new Planar Rifts are No-Drop, and should only be converted in a forge by the intended owner. Old-style Celestial<br>                          Rifts may be converted into the new Planar Rifts for a period of one month from this patch. If you have any rifts<br>                          currently, be sure to convert them to the new style within 30 days.<br><br>                          This change is not intended to make it more difficult or time consuming to acquire your Vex Thal key. Many players<br>                          had brought forth concerns regarding the ability to hoard Celestial Rifts, which had the potential of causing some<br>                          long-term issues. This fix addresses those concerns, and does not add any difficulty for players currently working<br>                          on this quest.<br><br><br>                          ** Items **<br><br>                          - Shissar-bane bows should be working.<br>                          - Irontoes Tipped Beer Stein should now look like a stein rather than a bag when equipped.<br>                          - The Intricate Shield can now be used by Dwarves, High Elves, Iksar, Vah Shir, Barbarians and Half Elves.<br>                          - Imbued Steelsilk Helms now have plate graphics.<br>                          - Large Fine Plate Boots can now be worn by Bards.<br>                          - Crustacean Shell Helm now has a graphic.<br>                          - Pickbringer's Chainmail Boots are now wearable by Gnomes.<br>                          - Forged Firebrand Halberd now has a halberd graphic rather than an axe graphic. Also, because it is a two-handed<br>                          slashing weapon, it can no longer be used by Bards.<br><br><br>                          ** Dialogues **<br><br>                          There were a few NPCs that were not responding properly to their quest text. This has been fixed for the following<br>                          NPCs: Wizard Schrock, Seamey Whirewhisker, Oglard, Morgalanth Tal`Raeloen, Verona Rankin, Gunex, Waltor<br>                          Felligan, Nallar Q`Tentu, Lord Nethryn and Cilin Spellsinger.<br><br><br>                          ** Miscellaneous **<br><br>                          - NPCs no longer have a chance to break root when being healed or buffed.<br>                          - /split no longer has a chance to cause a loss of coins if done while a group member is gating.<br><br><br>                          ** Grouping **<br><br>                          We have revamped the grouping system. This is a major rewrite of the system that should have little effect on<br>                          gameplay, with the exception of removing the bugs with the old system. Players should no longer have issues with<br>                          their group due to the link-death of any member (including the leader), zoning and other such issues. There is also<br>                          a new command available.<br><br>                          /makeleader - The leader of the group can now reassign who the leader of the group is by use of this command.<br><br><br>                          *** News from Faydwer ***<br><br>                          It is rumored that the major cities of Faydwer have announced a call to arms for all young adventurers. News of<br>                          mysterious bloodthirsty goblins to the west setting up encampments has prompted all residents of Kaladim, Kelethin<br>                          and Felwithe to all begin preparing themselves for what they think may be a momentous battle. Intelligence<br>                          originating from the Scouts of Kaladim and Kelethin has informed their respective leaders of a possible alliance<br>                          between a mysterious aqua goblin tribe and the Orcs of Clan Crushbone. Due to the possibility of an attack by<br>                          either or both of these powerful tribes, guildmasters of all cities have begun the training of young soldiers brave<br>                          enough to heed the call to defend their homeland against all unknown creatures and new inhabitants.<br><br><br>                          *** Call to Arms ***<br><br>                          Tarlain moved along through the tunnel at a brisk pace, a wistful smile painting his weathered features. His arm<br>                          reached out from under his travel stained greatcloak so that his hand could traced the side wall of granite while his<br>                          mind recalled the many times he had passed through this tunnel in his youth. It had been many years since and the<br>                          memories of his training in the woodland ways within the environs of Surefall glade filled him with a peaceful<br>                          nostalgia. <br><br>                          This nostalgia all but vanished as Tarlain rounded the final curve and broke into the tree filtered sunlight of Surefall<br>                          Glade and beheld a most unexpected sight - a line of Qeynos foot soldiers marching past the Ranger hall and on<br>                          toward the far end of the Glade. What could bring the forces of Qeynos here? Knowing this could not bode well,<br>                          Tarlain strode quickly to the Ranger hall, his eyes on the receding backs of the footmen. <br><br>                          Reaching the main hall entrance, Tarlain's sight latched on to a proclamation inked in the flowing hand of a Qeynos<br>                          scribe and bearing the seal of Antonius IV. It outlined the rising threat of Blackburrow Gnolls invading and despoiling<br>                          the previously sequestered Jaggedpine Forest. Because of this danger Antonius has lifted his father's ruling to<br>                          protect those forests and now calls for able-bodied men and militia to join in quelling the expansion of the vile<br>                          Gnolls. Gritting his teeth at the thought of Gnolls invading the pristine woodlands, Tarlain turned and with a hand<br>                          on his longsword, set off to catch up with the guardsmen and throw in his lot against the dogs of Blackburrow.<br><br>                          (Note: Jaggedpine Forest is only available by using the optional files download option in the advanced section of<br>                          the EverQuest patcher. Be aware that the download required for this new zone is relatively large.)<br></blockquote></p>

Pets basically treat mesmerized<br>                             NPCs as if they were dead <br>                             Pets are neutral to NPCs.

In most situations<br>                             (with an active party, for example) the Dire Charmed pet will not take<br>                             experience. Like all pets, they will take 75% of the experience if no PC does<br>                             damage to the target. As long as a player does damage to a creature, a Dire<br>                             Charmed pet will never take more experience than it used to. <br>                             Charmed NPCs will now respond to the /pet report health command <br>                             /pet sit down command should now work on charmed NPCs <br>                             Fixed a bug that was preventing reclaim energy from working on Magician Epic<br>                             pets. <br><br>                        Miscellaneous<br><br>                             Fixed a bug that was causing a person that logs out with "damage shields:<br>                             OFF" to be unable to see damage shield even when they turned them back on <br>                             Fixed a problem that was causing crashes when /following someone on a horse<br>                             if they went out of range <br>                             Fixed a bug that prevented targeting an invisible NPC from horseback, even<br>                             with See Invisible <br><br><br><br><br>Information found at <a href="http://eq.castersrealm.com/">http://eq.castersrealm.com/</a><br></blockquote></p>

While I've mostly enjoyed (greatly enjoyed) my return to EQ, there's <a href="http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/Forum4/HTML/000316.html">an issue</a> that really gets my blood boiling.  No, it doesn't have diddly to do with Clerics, but you might find it mildly entertaining.<br></blockquote></p>

The problem was with filters that allowed players to<br>                          ignore spells that were hitting them. The following changes were needed to fix this issue<br>                          - Player characters will now always see spells that hit them and spells they cast<br>                          - Players with the Group option set for PC spells will see the start spell casting messages for people in their group<br>                          and they will also see when member of their group are hit with spells<br>                          - Players with the ALL option will still see all PC spells and spell hits<br><br><br>                          ** Spell Stacking **<br><br>                          General stacking changes: Some buffs were not being allowed to stack which now will stack, and other buffs were<br>                          being allowed to stack which should not have. <br><br>                          For example, many stacking problems with spells that have a See Invisible or Levitate component are now gone<br>                          (e.g. Dead Man Floating), while a number of stacking exploits that granted too much regeneration, too much<br>                          offense (ATK), too large of a damage shield, or too many hit points have been fixed. Here are some of the details:<br><br>                          - Vision abilities (natural or spell-granted) should no longer cause spells to fail to take hold<br>                          - Bard songs should in general overwrite fewer spells<br><br>                          - Harness of Spirit no longer stacks with spells that grant Strength or Dexterity boosts. It was never intended to<br>                          do so<br>                          - Harness of Spirit and Avatar should now stack properly<br>                          - Call of the Predator and Warder's Protection should no longer stack<br>                          - Arch Lich should no longer overwrite innate racial vision abilities<br>                          - Levitate and Dead Man Floating should no longer conflict<br>                          - Dead Man Floating should no longer conflict with any vision abilities (natural or spell granted)<br>                          - Spirit of Eagle should no longer cancel Levitation/Levitate spells<br>                          - Fixed a stacking exploit with Armor of Protection and Armor of the Risen<br>                          - Focus of Spirit should no longer overwrite Visions of Grandeur<br>                          - Focus of Spirit should now stack with the Whistling Fists effect<br>                          - "Circle of" Druid spells should no longer stack with their Resist counterparts. <br>                          - Shroud of Spirits and the Cloak of the Akheva should stack properly now<br>                          - Cantata of Soothing should no longer overwrite Clarity spells<br>                          - Cantata and Chorus of Replenishment should no longer overwrite Acumen<br>                          - Bladecoat no longer overwrites Clarity II<br>                          - Lower level druid group buffs should now be less likely to overwrite higher level buffs<br>                          - Avatar and Force of Nature will no longer stack<br>                          - Ancient Feral Avatar should now stack properly<br><br><br>                          ** Alternate Advancement **<br><br>                          - Improved Familiar should now be better than Greater Familiar<br>                          - Fixed a bug with Permanent Illusion that was causing the caster to see his illusions drop when zoning, even if<br>                          others continued to see the illusion<br>                          - Trolls and Iksar no longer receive double regeneration ability from AA abilities<br>                          - The Archetype skill Casting Deftness will no longer supercede the Class specific Quick Buff casting time reducing<br>                          skill. Note that at this time there is a maximum benefit to casting time bonuses of a 50% reduction<br>                          - Casting deftness was changed to reflect the increases presented by the in-game help (5, 15 and 25%)<br>                          - Turn Summoned should now work on all summoned creatures, not just pets. The text should correctly say that<br>                          there is only one level for this ability<br>                          - Improved Reclaim Energy now works with the epic pet<br>                          - Fixed a crash bug caused by Call Corpse<br>                          - Alternate Advancement abilities that affect a spell's duration should now work for clickable items<br>                          - Quick Summon should now work for Call of the Hero and Manifest Elements<br>                          - Quick Summon also changed to match the benefits presented by the in-game help<br><br><br>                          ** Skills **<br><br>                          - Increased the velocity tolerance for the Hide skill. This may slightly improve the functionality of the Evade skill<br>                          - Poison should no longer be interrupted<br>                          - Sneak only breaks when a character is hit, not when he hits someone<br>                          - Fixed a bug that was causing a problem when Pick Pockets was used before Beg had refreshed. Beg and Pick<br>                          Pocket use the same timer, so now using Beg or Pick Pocket will cause both buttons to gray out<br>                          - A message is now displayed and skills are properly reset when a rogue breaks sneak and/or hide because he is<br>                          looting a corpse<br>                          - Beastlords should function like other hybrids when casting in melee<br><br><br>                          ** Zones **<br><br>                          - The Hole now uses Kunark-level Mez/Charm/Taunt rules<br>                          - Petrified humerus should now be available<br>                          - Zones where mounts cannot be summoned will now remove mounts when they enter the zone<br>                          - High level NPCs can now be taunted in Cazic Thule<br>                          - Random frame lag in Guktop and Oasis should be fixed<br>                          - Fixed a pathing problem in Tenebrous Mountains<br>                          - Fixed a pathing bug in Paludal Caverns<br>                          - Fixed pathing exploits in Chardok<br>                          - Fixed a pathing exploit in Cazic Thule<br>                          - Fixed a pathing exploit in Acrylia<br>                          - Fixed a pathing bug in the Tower of Frozen Shadow<br>                          - Fixed a pathing bug in Fungus Grove<br>                          - Fixed a spot where characters could get stuck in Twilight Sea<br>                          - Moved the Permafrost 'safe point' closer to the zone line<br>                          - Addressed an issue with an aggressive NPC that appeared outside of the Arx Building in Sanctus Seru<br>                          -Modified the Vyzh`dra the Cursed spawn trigger to make the various incarnations more accessible<br>                          -Modified several NPCs in the temple of Ssraeshza to address the disparity between melee and caster effectiveness<br>                          in the zone<br><br><br>                          ** Quests **<br><br>                          - Adjustments have been made to the 8th Coldain Prayer Shawl quest<br>                          - High Priestess Alexandriana should be working properly now<br><br><br>                          ** Tradeskills **<br><br>                          - Added over 1,000 new tradeskill recipes for all levels of skill, along with many recipe books. A few of the vendors<br>                          of Norrath might be able to get you started on your way <br>                          - Added Mortar and Pestle to a Thurgadin merchant<br>                          - Rubbing Alcohol is now available from a vendor in Thurgadin<br><br><br>                          ** Guilds **<br><br>                          - Fixed many bugs with the guild system, for example: GMs can now rename guilds without the need to destroy and<br>                          recreate them, guilds can have names that share the first 15 characters with another guild (they couldn't before)<br>                          and people should no longer experience random guild kickouts when a guild on their server is deleted/reformed.<br><br><br>                          ** Pets **<br><br>                          - A character may now have a horse, a pet and an Eye of Zomm at the same time<br>                          - /pet attack range has been limited to prevent its use as a targeting tool. Asking pets to attack targets outside<br>                          the range will generate a "not a legal target" message<br>                          - Pets will once again tell you who they are attacking by sending its master a /tell<br>                          - Pet attack animations should now be working for all pets<br><br><br>                          ** Chat Channels **<br><br>                          - Players can specify a chat channel as their default channel using the /channel commands (e.g. /channel chat<br>                          mychannel)<br>                          - The 'old' method for setting the default channel is also now saved in the INI file<br>                          - Kick and Invite should be working for chat channels<br><br><br>                          ** Horses **<br><br>                          - Potions now work while on a horse<br>                          - Skeletons can now ride horses (meaning: PCs should be able to mount and ride horses while changed into a<br>                          skeleton)<br><br><br>                          ** Miscellaneous **<br><br>                          - Fixed a bug that was causing the AFK flag to sometimes not be visible to players entering a zone after it was<br>                          turned on<br>                          - Made some adjustments to factions to make Beastlords, Druids and Rangers (as well as small adjustments for Vah<br>                          Shir) a little better liked by animals (those that don't adhere to a faction)<br>                          - No updates are sent when the player character is not moving, saving resources. We've also increased the rate<br>                          that position updates are made by moving player characters, using up some of those saved resources but making<br>                          movement a bit smoother<br>                          - Stationary NPCs should no longer warp when they aggro/summon<br>                          - NPCs who shout names while they Death Touch should be fixed<br>                          - Teleports arriving in some zones should spread the arrivals out a bit more. Affected zones are Nexus, Skyfire,<br>                          Emerald Jungle, Butcherblock Mountains, South Ro, Greater Faydark, Tox, North Karana, West Commons and<br>                          Lavastorm<br>                          - Fixed the bug that was preventing players from seeing the "your spell is interrupted" or the NPCs spell interruption<br>                          message<br>                          - Fixed the issue with boats depositing players at the safe point of the zone after zoning<br>                          - Fixed the strange floating NPC bug (seeing NPCs floating in the air after zoning)<br>                          - /cry is now working<br>                          - /consent %t should allow the consented character to drag your corpse<br>                          - Target Nearest NPC (F8 by default) has been fixed.<br><br><br>                          ** Sullon Zek Rules Change **<br><br>                          We have increased the number of character that can be created on an account to three. These characters,<br>                          however, must be on the same team<br><br><br>                          ** Firiona Vie Rules Changes **<br><br>                          Since the launch of Firiona Vie we have had tremendous support for this special server from players who want a<br>                          very roleplaying immersive environment. Players have made numerous suggestions to tweak the ruleset a little<br>                          more. We have taken many of those suggestions and made changes accordingly. <br><br>                          We will be keeping the following rules intact: <br><br>                          * /ooc will remain unavailable to remind people that acting in character is strongly recommended. <br>                          * The Common language will remain out, to help maintain the feeling of race-based community and to allow people<br>                          to continue to roleplay someone with a native tongue. <br>                          * The Trivial Loot Code and all of the special rules for no-drop items will remain. This has worked out nicely for the<br>                          sense of community on the server. <br>                          * The one character per account restriction will remain.<br><br>                          However, we will be removing the following restrictions:<br><br>                          * Anonymous/roleplay flags will no longer be required. They will remain available, but forcing anonymity on<br>                          characters was causing undue problems finding groups and other such things that are essential to enjoyable<br>                          gameplay. <br>                          * The language learning limit/speed restrictions will be removed. While the idea of limited languages seemed like a<br>                          good idea, this is another item that was just making it too hard to actually play the game. Roleplayers that don't<br>                          want their characters to be overly literate always have the option to play their characters that way. <br>                          * /shout and /auction have returned to unrestricted use to allow easier grouping and selling. People are welcome<br>                          to filter those channels if they prefer not to see them, but the benefits of having them availabe is just too great.<br>                          /ooc will remain disabled on this server. Obviously, acting in character on any channel is strongly recommended. <br>                          * Alignment restrictions has been removed. Forced restrictions for grouping make playing the game too much of a<br>                          chore. Characters, however, may always decide who they wish to group with based on any factors the character<br>                          perceives. If your Dark Elf won't group with a paladin, he doesn't have to (and shouldn't). If your cleric of Quellious<br>                          wants to heal a necromancer because healing people is the right thing to do for him, then you should be able to do<br>                          so. But not allowing these things is a restriction on your ability to play that character 'in-character', and a real<br>                          hindrance to general gameplay.<br><br>                          Again, it's important to understand that this is still a roleplaying preferred server. The rules that we are changing<br>                          were often as much of a restriction to one's ability to roleplay as they were a help. And the artificial barriers to<br>                          grouping, especially the trouble created in just finding a group, needed to be removed to allow people to actually<br>                          play the game. </blockquote></p>

                          NOTE: We are unable to patch "code" right now because we are in the middle of making some changes to the basic<br>                          structure of the game.

This command allows you to turn on and off the<br>                             "DoProperTinting" option in the eqclient.ini file. Activating this command should correct<br>                             most tinting issues (such as armor tint also tinting the character's skin). But if it<br>                             causes issues you can toggle it off by using /dopropertinting off <br>                             Added /chat commands, that allow players to create their own chat channels. Please<br>                             read the eqmanual_supplement.doc in your EverQuest directory for more information <br>                             Added /hitsmode command. This command allows you to more finely control how you<br>                             see hits, including seeing them in a window other than your chat window. Please see<br>                             the eqmanual_supplement.doc for more details <br>                             Added /clearhits to clear the current hits in the M2-M5 modes of the /hitsmode<br>                             command. Again, please see the eqmanual_supplement for more information <br>                             Added /showgrass command. This toggles the radial flora (Luclin only) on and off <br>                             Added options in the Options screen (under Chat Filter) for filtering out Melee and Spell<br>                             criticals. Options are All/Me/Off. These can also be activated using the /filter<br>                             command, and will affect critical hit, critical blast, exceptional heal, and crippling blow<br>                             messages <br>                             Changed /filter to allow you to toggle the various chat filter settings (still also lets you<br>                             toggle the badwords filter) <br>                             Changed /channel to allow you to set your default chat channel.

"Can not use Mend for x seconds" can still appear,<br>                             but you now should be able to use mend at the appropriate time <br>                             Fixed bug in the client that caused a "You are out of Ammo message" even when you<br>                             still had ammo <br>                             Messages should no longer be lost while you are zoning <br>                             Corpses that are made to appear at the "safe spot" of a zone for any reason can now<br>                             be moved using /corpse as long as the person using the command has /consent for<br>                             that corpse <br>                             Added "AllLuclinPcModelsOff" line to the eqclient.ini file which, if set to TRUE, will skip<br>                             the loading of all of the Luclin PC models (except the Vah Shir, which always gets<br>                             loaded no matter what this is set to). This should allow players to set the loading of<br>                             each race and sex individually for their normal game play, but then quickly turn all<br>                             models off for a raid or other such circumstances <br>                             Added /rtarget function (can be used as /rt). This function targets the last character<br>                             to send you a /tell. It follows all of the rules for /target <br>                             Messages sent to you while you are zoning should be saved and sent to you when you<br>                             reach the other side of the zone.

<blockquote>
February 13th, 3:00 am<br>------------------------------<br><br>** General **<br><br>- Improved sound for many users.

Pets will now, when close to you, STOP.<br>- Many higher level NPCs now have a random delay before they initially spawn. This means that they will appear at a more random time interval after servers or zones are brought up. This is designed to provide a fairer distribution of these NPCs across all time zones<br>- If you right click to auto-inventory an item that you are looting and it will not fit into your inventory, the item will simply appear on your cursor as if you had left clicked on it<br><br><br>** Gameplay Related **<br><br>- NPC and PC corpses can now be /considered to find out how long until they decay, and PC corpses additionally tell you how long you have to resurrect them<br>- The timer for corpses is now seven days for any corpse over level five, whether the player is on-line or off-line or any combination of the two<br>- Characters below level eight will no longer see light blue cons<br>- Spires will no longer try to teleport you to Luclin if you do not own the expansion, and therefore will no longer move you to the 'safe point' in the zone when it can't take you to the Nexus<br>- Pets can now be targeted by typing their full name after the /target command (or at least enough of it to distinguish it from the owner)<br>- Knockback now works correctly when on a horse<br>- Summoning a horse in Plane of Sky will no longer allow you to levitate<br>- Gating when in the same zone that you are bound no longer causes problems<br>- Horses will no longer disappear when a character is moved to the 'safe point'<br><br><br>** Trade Skill Related **<br><br>- Added several trade skill items to Grobb; including a brewing supply vendor, a brew barrel, a baking vendor, a standard forge, a pottery cooking mold vendor, a kiln, a pottery wheel, and a sketch vendor.<br>- Added water flasks to two merchants in the Bazaar<br>- Added high quality ore vendors to Bazaar, Kaladim, and Qeynos that sell a limited supply of HQ Ore<br>- Fixed an inconsistency with the armor class of Enchanted Imbued Dwarven Plate compared to the armor class of other Dwarven-smithed plate armor<br>- Batwing Pie, Bug Bites and Deadly Medley now exist<br>- Repaired the recipe for Superior Gnomish Spirits\Gnomish Cleaning Substance<br>- Increased the drop rates of cultural armor temper components<br>- Added hilt mold vendors to more cities<br><br><br>** Quest Related **<br><br>- Made adjustments to the Whistling Fists quest<br>- Reduced the spawn time of the Zordak Ragefire in SoldungB.

It is not immune to spells though, just extremely resistant.<br>- Warcry should now work properly<br>- Life Burn now considers hit points from items and should no longer be interrupted<br>- Area Taunt should be no longer affect creatures on heights or floors above and below the warrior<br><br><br>** Discipline Related **<br><br>- Added the following /disciplines for Beastlords: <br>Level 51: The Discipline of Resistant<br>Level 54: The Discipline of Fearless<br>Level 55: The Discipline of Protective Spirit<br>Level 60: The Discipline of Bestial Rage<br><br><br>** Item Related **<br><br>- Expendable items no longer use mana when 'casting' a spell<br>- Extra damage from either elemental or bane damage should now work for special attacks like backstab<br>- Shield of Auras can now be used by Necromancers<br>- All pieces of Black Pantherskin Armor are now Beastlord useable<br>- Steelsilk Helm should now be visible when using the new models<br>- Windspeeder's haste is now a permanent effect<br>- Shield of Mental Fortitude is now actually a shield and also has a different graphic<br>- Drape of the Deep Thinker now has a robe texture when equipped<br>- Orb of Lost Souls can no longer be "Held"<br>- Dark Cloak of the Sky from 'worn to activate' to 'Race/Class to activate'. The previous change that made it 'worn to activate' was an error. <br>- Items that add bonuses to the Lock Pick skill should function properly now<br><br><br>** Firiona Vie **<br><br>- The Trivial Loot Code present on the Roleplaying server will no longer affect items that are marked solely with the No-Drop flag. No-Drop items that are also Magic or Lore will continue to behave as they did prior to this patch.<br><br>- The EverQuest Team<br><br><br>** Tales **<br><br>Grand Master Glox sat silently staring into the black waters of the Cabilis aqueducts, his thoughts tracing and retracing the recent visions that had upset his nights. The Lord Cazic was trying to tell him something, but he could not yet decipher what it was. The hand on his shoulder startled him and he turned quickly, striking the intruder with a quick blow to the chest. The figure crumpled to the cold ground.<br><br>Glox stood over him with a look of horror, it was one of his own pupils he had struck. He lay bloodied and bruised at Glox's feet breathing heavily with much effort, he was obviously dying. The pupil reached up toward Glox with something in his hand. Glox took the items from his hand and peered at them intently. There were two items, one was a glistening serpentine scale, the other an ancient stone symbol. Glox recognized the symbol almost immediately with horror. It was the symbol of the Soriz, the ancient Iksar tribe that had been the slaves of the Shissar empire. Glox looked down at his pupil again. "Where did you get this?" The dying Iksar used his last ounce of energy to point up toward the night sky and the moon of Luclin. "sSs... Ssraeshza... has... returned..."<br><br><br>** A Call to Arms! **<br><br>Have you long dreamed of aiding your fellow adventurer? Do you enjoy travelling the world and meeting new and interesting people? Are you over the age of 18 with an EverQuest account in good standing and some free time? If so, then the EverQuest Guide Program may be for you! If you feel compelled to join our ranks, point your web browser to <a href="https://guide.everquest.com/guideapp/">https://guide.everquest.com/guideapp/</a> and fill out an application!<br><br>February 4th<br>------------------------------<br><br>** Changes to the EverQuest patcher **<br><br><br>A little while ago we combined our Test patcher with our Live patcher. The intent was to remove the confusion that having two patchers can cause and to encourage more people to play on the Test server.<br><br>Well, we're going back to the old way. We are going to split the Test patcher and the Live patcher back into two separate programs.<br><br>This means that in order to access the Test Server you will need to run TestEverQuest.exe, which you will find in your EverQuest directory. To play on the Live Servers just start EverQuest as you always have.<br><br>There are a few advantages to separating the two patchers. Splitting them up makes it a little easier, as a player, to be sure that you are headed to the right server when you double click the icon. It's also a little more intuitive for those that want to run the game in two directories.<br><br>Using two directories for EverQuest does use up a lot of hard drive space. However, for those with enough space that play regularly on both Test and on Live servers, this is a safer and faster way to work. Using the same directory means that each time you change servers (Live to Test or Test to Live) you will have to patch. The data on the Test Server is very rarely the same as that on Live servers.<br><br>And for us internally it makes it easier to test new patchers. It gives us one more step for testing. Now we can push a patcher to the Test Server and try it out there after internal testing and before it goes to the Live servers.<br><br>In any case, we've decided to move back to the old way. Starting on Monday, February 4th, 2002 you will need to run TestEverQuest.exe to patch and play on the Test server, and Everquest.exe to patch and play on the Live servers.<br><br>* Patch Message Addendum *<br><br>The command line argument "/test" should no longer be used to play on the Test Server. Anyone using this should remove this argument from their shortcut. Please manually select "TestServer" from the Advanced Options window to use the Test Server. On Monday, February 4th, TestEverQuest.exe will once again be used to patch and play on the Test Server.<br><br><br>- The EverQuest Team<br></blockquote></p>

Please see the Developer's Corner on our web site for more details<br>- Added Quest NPCs to Thurgadin, Kael and Skyshrine for Beastlord quest armor<br>- Gravel leaf tea will now fit in the combine container for the associated quest<br>- Grimling Blood should now be dropping<br>- Idia in the bard guild in Kelethin was telling you to turn in a quest item to the incorrect NPC.

Many of the items had AC that was inconsistent with the armor types of the classes.  The AC has been reduced on some pieces and raised on others.  In all instances where the AC was dropped a different statistic was raised.  Several items received a significant upgrade while others were downgraded<br>- Also in regards to Umbral Plains armor, Ranger has been removed from the plate class armor that was dropping and have been added to the usable classes on the chain equivalent.  Bards have been added to the plate equipment list.  This might mean that some Rangers will have armor that they can't use.  Our Customer Service personnel will trade out that armor for the chain equivalent<br>- Ghoulbane is now No-Drop<br>- SoulFire charges can only be used by Paladins (though they can be used from inventory)<br>- Raised the armor value on many Beastlord specific armor pieces<br>- Added effects to a few of the Wild Lord's armor pieces<br>- Added Vah Shir to Imbrued Plate Mail useable races<br>- Rhino Hide armor is now Druid and Monk usable<br>- The Crustacean Shell Shield is now magic<br>- Scroll of Knowledge can now be equipped in the primary, secondary, and range slots<br>- Scroll of Enlightenment can now be equipped in the primary, secondary, and range slots<br>- Thought Horror Fangs can now be thrown<br>- Iron Scroll of War must now be worn to activate<br>- Cloak of Thorns right click effect should work now<br>- Runed Bone Fork is now equippable primary, secondary and ranged.  The "range" value has been removed to prevent people from accidentally throwing them<br>- Spider Fur Collar has been given weight 0.0 to be consistent with other pieces<br>- Dark Cloak of the Sky must now be worn to activate<br>- Sage's Crown is now No-Drop to match every other Velious quest armor<br>- Icicle Circlet is now No-Drop to match every other Velious quest armor<br>- Bone Collar of the Possessed should no longer cause players to crash when inventory is opened<br>- Idol of Rallos Zek can now be used by ShadowKnights<br>- Helm of Grim Blessings can now be used by Wood Elves<br>- Flayed Skin Bracer is no longer a Lore item<br>- Greaves of Avoidance can now be used by all races<br>- Steel Threaded Wrist Wraps are no longer lore<br>- Bravado's Breastplate now grants a larger Hit Point bonus<br>- Guise of the Hunter can now also be worn by human bards and rogues <br>- Primal Cudgel now has the proper effect<br>- Added "Recommended Level" equal to the current item use level for the several items.  All of these items require the player to be level 51+ to equip them and/or use their effects.  Setting the "Recommended Level" field like this just lets the player know what level they need to be to use the item.  The actual utility of the item was not affected in any way, this change is purely informational<br>- Several items have been changed to be not useable by Iksar.  They had been erroneously set as Iksar useable in the last item patch.  These were primarily items that were usable by Beastlords (and were therefore changed to allow all Beastlord races to use them), but that had been specifically restricted from use by Iksar due to their inherent armor value<br><br><br>** Zones **<br><br>- Shades in Umbral, Maiden's Eye and Vex Thall are now considered undead<br>- Placed portals to and from Great Divide and Nexus<br>- Added many new items to better round out the rewards for high-level Luclin encounters<br><br><br>** Horses **<br><br>- Implemented horse trade in quests.

                          Normally this isn't something I'd do. But, well, I'm going to outline the changes we're making to this quest in rather<br>                          close detail. But first, let me try to explain the concern that players had with this quest.<br><br>                          With arguably the most popular Epic Quest item, the Cleric trying to gain his Epic item usually finds plenty of people<br>                          to help in the process. Clerics are commonly the first in line with guilds to help with their epic quests. So Clerics<br>                          tend to get further in their epic quest faster than many others. This has lead to a very nasty 'bottleneck' for<br>                          Clerics trying to complete the quest. The Ragefire portion of the quest has been creating a lot of static among<br>                          players.<br><br>                          So we have decided to make a change to the end portion of this quest. To reduce confusion and to help people<br>                          understand why we're making this change, I'm going to give out a few specific details. These changes will go Live<br>                          with the patch tonight.<br><br>                          For those that are not interested in quest details, consider the rest of this post SPOILER INFORMATION:<br><br><br>                          First, the 'merchant' version of Zordak will now appear at a different location in SoldungB. He will appear once each<br>                          day (except after a server comes down, then he will spawn in one to three days). The appearance of this NPC will<br>                          no longer require the absence of Lord Nagafen.<br><br>                          The cleric still turns in his Shimmering Pearl to Zordak. But now the merchant Zordak will return a Swirling Pearl to<br>                          the Cleric and disappear.<br><br>                          At that point the Cleric will need to head out and look for him. A killable version of Zordak will appear independent<br>                          of the pearl turn-in every few days (except after a server goes down, then he will appear a little faster). Killing<br>                          Zordak will transform him into dragon form, and the Cleric (with help&#8230;) must kill him immediately.<br><br>                          The new dragon Zordak will drop a heart that is a container that requires the Swirling Pearl to be combined in it to<br>                          create the Heart that is turned in to Omat.<br><br>                          The rest of the quest remains the same.<br><br><br>                          The goal of these changes is to reduce the problems with the bottleneck that existed before. They will not remove<br>                          that bottleneck, but hopefully will remove the nasty competition for a single spawn with so many people willing to<br>                          be&#8230; rude to each other.<br><br>Alan<br><br><br><br><br>*Very interesting in my opinion.  I don't know how many times we have complained about this and asked that this be changed and lo and behold, we now have a different ending.  Way to go Verant.<br>                          </blockquote></p>

First, due to the many generous donations received, this site is in no danger of disappearing any time soon.  EQCleric is currently funded through February, 2002.  I'll re-evaluate the available options in March.<br><br>Second, let's look at the available options.<br><ol><li>Cheap hosting: I'm (well you =P) currently paying $50/month for space and bandwidth.  While our storage needs are negligble, our bandwidth requirements are not.  Many people have written me about $10/month hosting sites with unlimited bandwidth.  Those sites offering unlimited bandwidth are generally lying.  If one looks hard those sites always have a disclaimer about a bandwidth cap at which point they start charging.  In all of the cases I looked at this site would have bandwidth overruns and have cost me (us) considerably more than $50/month.  So we're getting this site for a very reasonable fee.</li><br><li>Free hosting: Several people have written me offering completely free hosting including one individual who wishes to take over the site.  My inclination is come March, 2002 to take of one of them up on their offer.  I'll post more about it next year.</li></ol><br><br>So, thanks again for your support in keeping this site alive and enjoy your adventures in Norrath.<br><br>Signing out from Camelot,<br>Rayne</blockquote></p>
