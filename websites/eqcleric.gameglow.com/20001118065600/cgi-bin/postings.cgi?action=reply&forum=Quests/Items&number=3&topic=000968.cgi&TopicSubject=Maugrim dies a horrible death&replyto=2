Get to Kerra Isle. There's a 50th Wizard camping her for his twink. My Necro friend gets into a shouting match with him, and logs, mad. I talk reasonably to him, but come to no agreement. We gate to Cazic so I can at least get some exp this day. Friend switches to his Warrior. About 2 hours later when we have a great group going, the Wizzie gives me a tell saying he killed her. I make a mental note about how much I hate farmers.<P>1pm - Most of my group in Cazic has to log, so I get a TP back to Tox and go to Kerra Isle. Now there's a Cleric waiting for her. Sigh. I kill a few necros (helping him clear placeholders) and camp.<P>5pm - Log back in. Nobody camping her! Yay! Only other person in zone is a 50 Druid camping Mitty. I start clearing placeholders.<P>8pm - After killing place holders till my eyes bleed, finally decide to get some food (IRL). Come back, the island has respawned. Drop down to start killing necros. Start to cast Wrath, but see the necro behind the one I'm casting on is Maugrim! Interrupt my own spell and buff my self to all heck. Res magic, symbol, bravery, guard, res fire, res poison, res disease. Figured I'd pull her to the beach. Give a shout that I'm pulling her to the beach, and that people should watch out (about 6 people in zone now). BTW - She spawns in a roaming area, and seems to have no place holder (ie: it looked like all the wandering necros were there, but she was there too. As you come onto the island she was in the part of the maze to the left.)<P>I fear the pet, and head for the beach. While in the water, she fears me and I swim around a lot. Thank god I had my head above water when she did that. I stand on the beach waiting. Waiting. Waiting. Finally the pet comes at me. I spook it. Wait. Wait. Fear breaks. Spook pet again. Wait wait. Pet comes back. I figure she isn't following and so I expulse the pet and melee it to death. I'm down to about 60% mana, and 80% health. A 27th warrior shows up and whacks the pet a few times, just for fun.<P>Suddenly I'm dotted and Maugrim runs up and whacks me. Dang ok. No problem. I start to Wrath her as the warrior is beating on her. I get down to 2 bubs of health and 20% mana. i use my last bubble of mana to heal myself, and continue meleeing her. She's down to 30% life. When I finally go OOM I have 1 bub of health, she's at 20% maybe, and I'm dotted. I say "Can anyone heal me?" the Warrior says, that he's just a warrior. We are not going to be able to do it. I sigh, and say "Oh well, it was a good fight anyway. thanks" and prepare to die. Suddenly, I am surrounded by blue sparklies and I have 50% health!! I cackle gleefully, and start to whack maugrim with renewed glee. I can see the fear in her eyes. I finally melle her to death! I have my Icon!!! I look around quickly, and see a Barbarian Shaman sitting nearby. I bow and extend my sincerest gratitude. Then I rememebr the dot! I sit and med enough for a final heal as I'm at a quarter bub. Then the dot falls off! Whew! another close one. I continue to thank the shaman, as I med up to gate out.<P>All in all one of the most fun and intense combats of my career!<P>Thanks to you, kind Shaman, you know who you are!<P>Lessons learned: <BR>1. Keep those necros cleared! If I could have taken her on the isle, I would have rooted and nuked her easily. But with the necros around, they would have healed her, making the whole thing more difficult.<P>2. Backup is nice. At level 30 it was a VERY close solo. Even a 20th level cleric would have helped immensely.<P>3. Forget the pet!!! I should have kept fearing the pet until she showed up. The pet was not a problem. I could have meleed her pet pretty easily after she was dead, much easier than taking her on with 60% mana.<P>4. All the magic resistance helped! Yes, I got feared once, and dotted once, but you should have seen all the resists! I'll go fire up my log and count them. I would have been toast if not for the high resists!<P>5. She appears to be a timed spawn outside the normal spawn locations (about 4.5 hours from what I can tell). But keeping the other necros cleared netted me some nice cash (about 50-70pp or so). And she spawns in the location noted above. I know she didnt wander in there becuase I saw her cast her pet before I knew it was her.<P>Good luck fellow clerics!!<P>------------------<BR>Veloria D'Von<BR>Teir'Dal Cleric of Innoruuk<BR>30th year<BR>Griffin Claw<BR>Prexus</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#f7f7f7"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Temuli</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">My attempt at Maugrim also came close to ending in disaster. I'm a lev 50 cleric.<P>It was my first (and only) trip to that zone and after some wandering I found where the necros live. Prior to this I had wasted some time searching the other Kerra in the sea until someone got me straightened out. OK so I wasn't perfectly prepared....<P>The necros weren't aggro, so I roamed at will<BR>giving them each a lovetap, rounding a bunch up together and AEing them to death. On about my 5th round-up, I suddenly realised that Maugrim was amongst my little flock! <P>"Great!" I thought.<P>Next thing I knew I was Feared and running around all over the place. Every time it wore off I was slapped with another Dot and Feared off again on my merry way.<P>I had no idea where I was nor the zone in relation to me, but fortunately the Fear pathing took me more or less to it - it was with enormous relief that I zoned out (wondering if I would arrive healthy at the other side) and got a heal off in time to save myself. It would have been a long run back from where I was bound - West Commons or somewhere else equally masochistic. <P>I rezoned in a little better prepared, with MR buffed. I led off with Sound of Force, and this time Maugrim behaved herself nicely  <IMG SRC="http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/smile.gif"><P>Somehow, I keep forgetting that greens can be dangerous.

Sorry!<P>In any case, congratulations on the fabulous battle.

I will look at my logs for you, but I can tell you that for the generic heretic necros the faction hit was Bertoxxus (whoo) and for Maugrim it should have been similar.
