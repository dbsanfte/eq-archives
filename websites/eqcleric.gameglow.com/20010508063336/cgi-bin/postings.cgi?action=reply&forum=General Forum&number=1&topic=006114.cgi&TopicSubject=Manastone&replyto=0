<TEXTAREA NAME="ReplyMessage" ROWS=10 COLS=45 WRAP="VIRTUAL">[QUOTE]Originally posted by Frater:
[B]Hello all,

I am fairly new to the board and my cleric is mid-level (36 currently). My main is a high level monk and in a recent trade I received a manastone thinking it would be cool for my cleric.

I have noticed that it flat won't work in some places and when it does work it seems to suck up a LOT of HP's vs a little mana regained. My current strategy has been to not even use it unless we have an overpull and I am OOM and need that one last Heal to get off on the tank, etc..

What is your experience with this? Are Manastones valuable to our class? Why won't it work in some places? Is there any special strategy to using one?

Thanks!

You spend 400 mana for the spell and break even on mana if you stoned down 1200 hit points.  Anything over 1200 hit points healed is where you get the mana regen.  I would consider getting some hit point items for level 39 and then keeping yourself buffed with your best hit point buffs if you want to use this normally.  Just be careful, using the stone causes agro against mobs in range, and low health increases agro too.</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#f7f7f7"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Rayne</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">You pegged it Dikmer.  I haven't done Kedge much since I've hit 50 (just pop in to do Phinny occasionally).  The things that give me XP are too much trouble to kill for XP in that zone.<P>So... it's LDCs and Imps most of the time.  LDCs are good XP up to 59 and can get one to 60 if soloing (er, not as a Cleric of course).  Imps will get you through 60 and beyond (if there was one).<P>Haven't hunted in LGuk since 50, so can't comment there.<P>The entrance mobs in the Hole will get you to 54 and can PL a single player to 55 very quickly (great place to bring a low 50s Warrior with a snare whip).  Downstairs is good until upper 50s (on the floor) and the rev tower is good to 60.  I don't like the Jail for PLing, the Ratmen hit too hard, have too many hit points to do them efficiently and if you spawn a Guard just wrap it up.  A good group can get incredible XP in the Hole.  Loot sucks.<P>One day I'm going to try the bears and stuff inside Perma....  Bet they aren't camped at all =P.  Just figure it'll take my SK too damned long to kill them.<P>I broke into the Efreeti with my SK at 58 (with Rayne healing of course).  I suspect it'll be a lot easier at 59, though I haven't tried yet.  The LDCs are so much easier for only a little less XP, um, provided I can get them all.<P>To get Rayne through 59 I fired up a 3rd comp, grabbed an Enchanter, and invited a 60 Monk to push Rayne through at the Kobold Village in Velk's.  Very nice XP, very nice cash (1500 an afternoon after splitting), and the occasional loot item to sell or twink with (25 AC tunics, 10 AC back items, twink stuff).<P>My SK is only 2+ blues into 59, so I'm too depressed to think about powerlevelling right now.  I wouldn't bother, but the 60 spells are nice for SKs.<P>Best place I've ever seen for XP, at upper 50s, is South Wing of Charasis.  A strong group can mow through that place, nice cash loot items (I wouldn't wear a Sash of the Dragonborne, but can sell them for 14k) and just incredible XP, as in 2-3 blues in 59 a night.  Of course the Manstone doesn't work there =).<P>Like I said earlier, the 'stone is definitely situational now, but it allows me to do productive XP hunts without an Enchanter or Bard around.<P>Rayne<BR></FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#dedfdf"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Avenea</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">I lub the stone! I would put it up there as one of the must haves for a high end cleric. It's not incredibly useful pre-cheal, but once you get a decent amount of HP's its great. Rayne pretty much covered how to use it, buff yourself with hero/reso, symbol and armor of protection before using it. But the part I really love about owning a manastone is the new found ability to solo in the old world that it gives. With 2500+ HP, 900+ AC, the ability to root, nuke for 650+, heal, snare (dark elfs only ;D), and on top of that, the ability to regain mana at the drop of the hat you can easily solo blues and be up and ready to solo another in the time it takes to stone back up. I've done (for fun) AM/hand solo in Guk, LDC's in sol-b (up until I get jumped by 3 and have to zone  <IMG SRC="http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/biggrin.gif">), and occasionally I'll kill X'ta Timpy and her sisters to equip low level dark-elf necromancers with robes of enshroudment.

(you know, the <B>pit</B> someone always falls into during Vox raids) At 59, you will start seeing green mobs and experience will plummet however... (well it's 59, so experience will start getting depressing anyway!) <P>Getting into the pit is easy enough - only icy terrors and ice giant diplomat will see through invis 100%, and only few giants here and there will see through invis. Just check with third person view and be careful. None of the bears, wolves, and spiders will see through invis from my experience, so falling down into the pits with invis is pretty safe. At level 56 (or 57?) a careful puller should be able to get solo mobs 100% of time down in the pits. Getting out is even easier, provided you are level 53 and above. Just run into Vox's lair, and you'll get a free ride out to Everfrost. Make sure Vox is up though. :P<P>Loot simply does not exist down there, and if you spend any more than 4 hours there in a stretch, your mind will go numb.
