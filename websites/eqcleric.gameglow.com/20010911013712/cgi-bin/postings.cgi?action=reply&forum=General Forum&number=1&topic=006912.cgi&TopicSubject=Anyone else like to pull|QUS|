Pretty good group, but neither of the melee classes we had with us (55 monk and 56 ranger) had ever been before and did not know how to pull it.<BR>So having a pretty good bit of experience with d1/d2 I tried my hand at pulling...and had a blast!<P>Most of it was not krups so I was able to single pull about 80% of the time at 58 (pissing the monk off no end  <IMG SRC="http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/wink.gif">) and for once got to do something other than sit and heal.  I was even able to solo the whole library and the d2 room!<P>Personally I have always hated meleeing.  I rarely get up and melee in a group even when I am not having to heal much b/c I just don't like to (usually I wait for there to be just one mob and play with my donals boots some so I can do spell dmg w/o forcing myself into more medding), So it had never occured to me I would find pulling so much fun  <IMG SRC="http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/smile.gif"><P>Anyone else like to break out of the normal cleric role and pull?<BR><P>------------------<BR><B>Arianae</B><BR><B>58 Templar</B><P><BR><B>Arianwen Taur`amandil</B><BR><B>53 Wanderer</B><P>Bertoxxulous<P>"<I>If dreams are like movies, then memories are films about ghosts</I>"  --Counting Crows</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#f7f7f7"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">electrae</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">I pull upper Kobolds in Velks when I'm the highest level person in the group.  <IMG SRC="http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/smile.gif"></FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#dedfdf"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Aiien</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">I pull all the time when I'm grouped with friends. Part of it is general cleric boredom, especially when I have level 60's in full kael/skyshrine tanking the mobs which means I heal once every 10 minutes or so, but most of it is impatience. I hate pullers who stand around for a minute after a kill, then spend minutes finding a mob, then ask if everyone is ready, then ask for a mana check, then finally pull. <P>I'm usually out pulling junk while my group is killing things in these situations, freaks out people who aren't used to me, but I have fun.  <IMG SRC="http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/wink.gif"><P>Aiien</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#f7f7f7"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Darianne</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><BR><--- puller of Nurga, Droga, Kaesora, Seb (heh, "can the cleric please NOT pull"), and now my new favorite place to pull, Chardok!<P>Pulling is 50% knowing the mobs and spawns, and area.  The rest is split between what abilities your class has, and how good a player you are.  Just because a monk has FD, does not make them a good puller.  By the same token, just because clerics don't have FD, does not mean we suck.

Any strangers in the group get nervous if the cleric is constantly running around. Really relieves the tedium of sit here, heal, heal, run there and repeat though.<P>Honestly we're pretty well suited to pull with high AC, high hp, roots, stuns, atones, and low aggro pull spells like null magic, MoK, and pacify. Before I got my PoG chest I'd pull with a donal's bracer. The pacify effect was resisted almost 100% of the time.

I personally don't think anyone can convince me that it is a good idea for the cleric to pull.  Although I agree that it can be succesfully done, I just don't see why it is a good idea.  I totally understand the desire to want to break the boredom of being a cleric, but pulling is not the answer if you ask me.  I feel the same way about an Enchanter pulling though.  I know some love to do it and some are quite effective with it, but things can go wrong then you got a big CR to do which sucks.  I'd rather be bored and safe than excited and dead.

Of course this doesn't apply in multi-group situations  <IMG SRC="http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/wink.gif">  The issue is that oftentimes in more crowded dungeons you'll randomly run into a fd monk splitting 5 mobs, that as a cleric, you have no choice but to aggro all of them.<P>In multi-cleric groups, raids, or in groups where you have the levels to solo pull, it can be quite the right thing to have a cleric pull...or in outdoor zones where you can train (like fear) since no class has the surviveability of a cleric with jboots  <IMG SRC="http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/wink.gif"><P>I remember pulling the temple in fear one night and training around the mobs for so long that HT refreshed on the knights I was training....I was laughing so hard when I was burnt to the ground by 5ish HT's.</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#dedfdf"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Aliudyen</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">I pull Fear a ton...was there the day it opened and many days after that..

It's all about levels and knowledge there.  A 60 can single pull pretty much any mob at all, and he pulled then with slow, so he wouldn't even take a bubble of damage before they were taunted off of him.<P>If you had a 60 wizard in your Seb group and everyone else was under 57, you'd probably do better with the wiz pulling, honestly.  One mob single but on a wizard gauranteed is better than pulling 2-4 every time.</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#dedfdf"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Tarf</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Darianne is a great puller.<P>The key to pulling for a cleric is knowing the zone inside and out and, unequivocally, having a chanter that rocks the world.  <P>If a cleric can get singles because of level, then anyone can and it is no special thing.<P>I know Darianne and her chanter friend pull like clock work, cleric pulls, brings to camp, casts DA, chanter mezzes one, cleric moves, chanter mezzes another, cleric moves, chanter mezzes another, when only one is left, tanks dig in.  It is super easy on the chanter, and it is a way that clerics get to really shine as a puller.  Clerics can have high hp, high AC, and hte almighty DA.  In certain situations, it works great.<P>I love to pull in HS, DA all those HT's and then let hte chanter and tanks take over.  Never had a problem there, but many folks don't want clerics to pull, because even though they are the best class for it in some situations, CR is too frightful.  And they are right.  CR in HS is a serious pain if everyone gets wiped out because of a hot dog cleric.  Thankfully, I work with excellent players and if it would have come to that, our evaccers have gotten everyone out safely.<P>Chanters make it all happen for cleric pullers though.<P>Tarf</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#f7f7f7"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">electrae</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">  <BLOCKQUOTE><font size="1" face="Verdana, Arial">quote:</font><HR>Originally posted by Bram:<BR><B>Why do you like pulling with MoK?<P>Bram</B><HR></BLOCKQUOTE><P>Because it seems to have low aggro, sort of like pulling with dispell.
