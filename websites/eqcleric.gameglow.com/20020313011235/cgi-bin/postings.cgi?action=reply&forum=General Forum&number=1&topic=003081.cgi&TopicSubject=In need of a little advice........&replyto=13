Level 20 would be excellent for Unrest.  I fought there on and off from about 19 to 30ish.

This is my first time posting here so if this post seems a litte amatuerish well....it probably is.  I've read alot of the stuff that is here and check this bulletin board daily and I've gotta say that you people are the most experienced players that I've ever met.  Well, to get to the point, I need a little help on where to get exp at level 20.  I group with a level 20 ranger, level 20 bard, and level 18 warrior regularly and am currently at Mistmoore but the exp there is a bit slow and since all of us are barely in the 20's we have to stay at the very front of the place which gets trained often and not very fun if you know what I mean.  <BR>Is there anywhere that we can go for better exp?<BR>Your advice has always been top notch so don't fail me now <IMG SRC="http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/smile.gif"><BR>Thanks in advance,<BR><P>------------------<BR>- Thoran Oakinshield<BR>  Cleric of Brell<BR>  Tunare Server</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#f7f7f7"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Juul</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Go to Cazic Thule.  Stop laughing, I'm quite serious.  I started there at 19 with a 19 ranger partner, and we stayed til 28th.  You don't mention what races people are, but you can bind the non-evils in the Arena zone in Lake Rathe.  I recommend binding yourself in the CT courtyard, behind the tree on the north wall.  This is a *very* safe spot - I have never had anything aggro me there (as opposed to B. Hurd and his Spectre friends outside).<P>Get a nice spot in the CY, and send the ranger forth into the maze to pull defenders.  Might take you a try or three to get a hang of the zone, but it's niiiiiiiiice exp.</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#dedfdf"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">krixxor</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Cazic thule is a very fine dungeon.  I have been there since lvl 29, but am now nearing the end of my time here.  I have noticed alot of lower lvl characters hunting there recently.  But, I also see them dying quite a bit to trains...and the occasional gator that stops to chomp on them as it is being pulled to the zone line to be killed.  With the release of Kunark, and the changing of paw, the aviak area in South Karana doesn't seem to be camped as much anymore.  You could try lower lvl aviaks in a group.  HighHold pass killing orcs at the kith zone line would be good as well, in a group.  Aviak guards in Lake Rathe are good exp if you can get one of the spawns.  Skels and Drybones are good at night in Lake Rathe at the ruins near the Sk zone line.  These are all good hunting areas for folks around lvl 20.  <BR><P>------------------<BR>Krixxor DE Cleric<BR>Druzzil Ro Server<BR>39th Season</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#f7f7f7"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Bennan</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">My suggestions would be Runneye Citadel. It is normally deserted so you could possibly have the run of the place.<P>Or maybe Dagnars Cauldron, killing those Aqua gobs could net some good xp.

I hunted in Upper Guk and Runnyeye a lot from lvl 20 to mid 20s. For Upper Guk, you could try doing the Squire spawn area which isn't very far from the zone or head on to the scryer room. As for Runnyeye, you could fight your way down to the warlord room and hold it. Like any dungeon, never let anything escape.<P>Since you have a regular group, it would be nice to explore dungeons which are suitable for you and aren't very crowded. I had loads of fun exploring Upper Guk and Runnyeye back at the lvl 20s. It's fun and there were few times when we went in too deep, got very lost and died.<P>Hehe ... or if you're feeling adventurous, just zone into Sol A, the mob that wanders near the zone will be blue to you. ANd a little way down the steps you'll even find some even or yellow cons for your level.<P>For outdoor zones, I've not hunted in many of them at your level with the exception of Lake Rathe  <IMG SRC="http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/smile.gif"><P>Hope this helps  <IMG SRC="http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/smile.gif"><P>------------------<BR><B>Reviver Enithsa</B><BR><B>Phoenix Crusaders</B><BR><I>Human Cleric of Erollisi Marr</I><BR><I>Erollisi Marr Server</I></FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#f7f7f7"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Nizdaar</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Permafrost, near the entrance.<P>I went there with a 4 person group that was exactly the same level and composure (well, druid instead of ranger).

Have to spend money on invis potions now.<P>My group did Runnyeye at that level and did well.  Most of the Blackend Iron pieces don't sell well, but at the warlord room you can get a Blacken Iron Medallion which I still use, and the boots which sell for some good cash because it let's melee classes kick beasts that are only touched by magic weapons like ghouls and wisps.  Sometimes the Blackend Iron Crown drops in the warlord room too.  My group ended up with four of them after about a week in RE.<P>I recomend Runnyeye because not only will it be good for xp, but really good experience for how things work in a dungeon.  Tanks bind close in Rivervale (if they are not evil).  The group learns it's role by not letting any runners go and what happens when one does get loose (which will happen).  That kind of thing sets you up for things like Cazic and Sol A where you don't want to wait for your tanks to hike through the Inky woods or run all the way from Freeport to CT.<P>I didn't do Permafrost much, but I gather it's much like Runnyeye.<p>[This message has been edited by Ortheao (edited 06-02-2000).]</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#dedfdf"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Boanerges</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">I did my low 20s in Rathe Mountains.

No loot, but pretty easy to root and smite a hound.  If you get in trouble, just run back to the guards in the town near the gorge, or better yet, pull the hound in close to the town before you blast in earnest.  Just root and shoot.  Those hounds will give good experience while solo up through level 24.  Boring, perhaps, but solo experience is better than group experience.  You will probably have to smite the hounds five or six times to kill them.  Med and repeat.  Watch out for griffs, evil eyes, and cyclopses, all fairly rare near the gorge town.  Lion Patriarchs are probably still blue at 20, but the guards won't kill lions.<P>When you get bored, go into the gorge and group up for evil eye hunting near the throne of King Xorbb.  That's a lot of fun.  Those evil eyes look nasty, but the unnamed ones have no more hps than a gorge hound.  Watch out for charm, and those very fun push effects that throw you halfway across the chamber.  </FONT></TD></TR></TABLE>
