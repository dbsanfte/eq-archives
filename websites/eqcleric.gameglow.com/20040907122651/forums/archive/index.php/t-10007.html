<br />
Arirang turned up announced they were gonna take Rage when he spawned and they did despite the fact there were 2 clerics there claiming the spawn and despite the fact that they did NOT get first aggro.<br />
<br />
I am on that list and I have waited like all the other clerics on the list, the cleric that was number one had been there for 9 days with the cleric that was before him, then he was on on his own camp, so he had waited nearly 2 weeks just to have Rage stole from under his nose.<br />

<br />
The worst part about it is that the cleric who was camping Ragefire has been there since May 11th and had a killing force in place. Arirang simply showed up with a group who was able to do a majority of the damage after Rage had been engaged, KS'd, and then laughed about it.<br />

Rodcet has some interesting rules about how to camp Rage. Bascially you have to sit there  in skyfire to camp ragefire (to basically have some sense of order and to show people in the zone you are serious about it). You have to be there with the person who is camping it before you, and if Rage spawns, you and your guild help the person currently holding the camp. <br />
<br />
Cleric 1 has epic from rage (finished camp) with guild A<br />
<br />
Cleric 2 has current camp, Guild B<br />
<br />
Cleric 3 is second in line, Guild C<br />
<br />
I think this has created a very nice environment where guilds help each other... except Arirang. <br />

<br />
&quot;the list&quot; is nothing but an informal agreement of those who agree to it, those who do not are hardly bound by it.  Unless &quot;the list&quot; people can damage the abusers of the list through boycotts etc then the list is useless.<br />
<br />
KSing is another thing.  if you got aggro first that is the only real issue here.  Prove that and these guys are in trouble.<br />
<br />
I hate the fact that EQ pits us against each other and guild against guild.  if they are going to do this then all servers should be PVP and disagreements should be taken out on each other right there and then like in a good role playing game hah ha.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Lists suck for people who can kill Ragefire at will, whenever they want. As long as people believe they are entitled to get Ragefire as soon as possible, and deserve their epic more then other people, there will be these problems.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Grumbles</div><div class="date">05-28-2002, 03:03 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Lists are usually a joke.  Either you can mobilize to kill a mob or you cant, if you wanted EQ to be an enjoyable experience you can pretty much forget getting involved in many of the epics.  Namely Cleric and Warriors for contention among guilds and Mage because it's a nightmare in and of itself.  <br />
<br />
I heard that a list system just got a grass roots start on Drinal and I think it's pretty unrealistic.  It sets the expectation that you will wait in line for your Ragefire to spawn and then you can call in the troops and kill it.  <br />
<br />
Welcome to the real world combined with the new world.  Ragefire is in a portal zone, wandering like a free range chicken, 4/5 MB wizzies, a cleric to loot the heart and anyone else free to come with for the ride and 10 seconds later you've got a dead RF.  <br />
<br />
Sitting there for a week by yourself with your name at the top of the list is all the consolation Verant will give you because the team that got the kill was within their rights, and if they cared about being flamed they wouldnt have done it.<br />
<br />
Lists have their best shot of working on a server where EVERYONE agrees to it, and there's not much incentive for a guild that can mobilize pretty much at will to consent to a list just because there's 200 velks lab rat clerics in various guilds that have like 12 people but need 45 to kill Rage even though they all want epics too.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gryfalia</div><div class="date">05-28-2002, 08:18 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ragefire needs to have one of two things done..<br />
<br />
One - move him to the plane of Sky or something, not necessarily high up, but that way if you want to get him you need to have someone who can BE in the plane of sky to watch for him (no level 20 FD monks) or<br />
<br />
Two - Make him level 65, give him insane MR, make him regen like a banshee (ok, no clue how fast they regen), and make his AoE two times harder<br />
<br />
<br />
Using solution 1, any guild of strength enough to kill the normal Ragefire can kill him, they just have to WANT it, and once someone kills the Princess on island 1, there is no one else to get to him.<br />
<br />
Using solution 2 takes away the 6 MB wizzys in a group getting the kill, regardless of their guild affiliation.<br />
<br />
<br />
Lists are fine, as long as everyone on the server can put away their 'we are so Uber over you that we DESERVE this more than you' attitude.  But since that isn’t going to happen, rotations will continue to get jumped.<br />
<br />
Oh yeah, and make the Druid/Wizzy evacs land in Burning Woods, not Skyfire.  That way more Wizzys and their groups will be more likely to survive landing..;-)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Thecklos</div><div class="date">05-28-2002, 10:59 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I was one of the people that helped start the list on Rodcet.  The &quot;rules&quot; of the list have been changed since then.  We tried to have a max of 10 people on list period.  The real problem with the list as stands is that it's got 70+ people on it.  Now at the current spawn rates we get around 62 ragefires a year (I figured this out once before - including patches and 2 weeks of daily patches window.)  A list of 70+ people goes out more than a year.  I'd say any list that goes out a month or two max is probably okay assuming people follow it...otherwise it is stupid.<br />
<br />
Another comment, I'm actually surprised that the list lasted as long as it did without a single ks incident, after seeing the kinds of things that happen on other servers.  <br />
<br />
That said I think manaburn is excessively overpowered in RoK/old world zones.  Witness VP, we have a group that goes and does VP with basically 2 groups (war, 2clr, rog, enc, 7 mb wizzies.)<br />
<br />
I really think manaburn should be like manastones and not work at all in old world/kunark.  Or that some mobs should be completely immune to manaburn (re: kunark dragons, venril sathir, vp dragons)<br />

<br />
SIMPLE SOLUTION!<br />
<br />
1)Put a No Drop, Lore, No Rent container item someplace in SkyFire that has a groundspawn rate similar to the current RF. Have the item spawn in the same spot or even better have it spawn in 1 of several spots. <br />
<br />
2) Have the pearl from SolB combined with the no rent container to form a new item that when given to a common NPC in SK summons RF immediately.<br />
<br />
DONE! Nuff said, <br />
<br />
- RF would be no more common than he is now, the No Rent Container would control the fequency he can be spawned<br />
<br />
- NoKSing, You'd NEED the rare No Drop Piece and the Pearl to get RF to spawn. At that point its obvious who has the &quot;right&quot; to kill him<br />
<br />
- The end becomes more fair. Small guild or big alliance, you have an opportunity to be in the right place at the right time and get the piece you need to finish your quest. You don't need to ruin yours and your friends real lives to camp SF to pick up a rare No Drop piece and combined it with an item you should already have.<br />
<br />
- Doesn't change the current quest HARDLY at all!</div></div><hr />

Some people are respectful, some people will even rally together force for those in line, even if they are done with epic. Some people figure they don't want to wait for whatever reason, and that is their right. <br />

I think it just stings a bit more when you have sat in that stupid zone with those stupid chromos and the stupid spinning red ball for 1-2-3weeks or more.<br />

<br />
We don't have a list, but the Rathe has a civil agreement from the SolB days.  A cleric who camped ragefire and maintained a force capable of keeping the fire giants clear 'held' the camp, and this was generally respected by all of the guilds.  In fact, any cleric from any guild could camp ragefire with his friends, and when RF finally spawned one or all of the four 'big' guilds would usually come in and help take down the mob.  Ragefire killings became something of a block party.<br />
<br />
Ragefire 2.0 has created a few problems.  One of the guilds recently killed a ragefire that was being 'camped' by another cleric.  The ensuing uproar on the server boards was such that several members of this guild quit and the server community (Including the offending guild) went above and beyond to make sure that the offended cleric was taken care of.<br />
<br />
You guys can take the exitement of 'putting it in someone's eye' and shove it somewhere else.  Everquest isn't a zero-sum game to me.  I don't have a winner or a loser in my game.  I'm happy to see civility win out over barbarism and anarchy.</div></div><hr />

1)  When someone engages the human/dragon, they &quot;report&quot; themselves immediately, so the report shows they have agro.<br />
<br />
2)  When the Human/dragon version goes down, whoever gets exp &quot;reports&quot; themselves immediately, so the report shows the exp.<br />

Fine, people don't agree with the list.  I'm one of those people for numerous reasons I won't get into as they have been stated enough.  But I would never waltz in and KS somebody who had camped it for days and already engaged the mob.  <br />

And it shows Arirang did in fact engage the mob before PA was even remotely wiped and that changes how the encounter would have happened when you have vultures sitting there.  Twice in that log there was a request from a member of Arirang telling their guildmembers to back off.<br />
<br />
The character of their guild can be summed up with this snippet though : <br />
<br />
&quot;Cometix tells the guild, 'then, if pa fail, we will rush' &quot;<br />
<br />
Arirang is what caused the failure in the first place.  They didn't have a cleric camping days for Rage either.  And at the end of the log : &quot;I as spokesman of Arirang apologize for the miscommunications with PA and personally to the person who have spent countless hours camping.&quot;<br />
<br />
Well, I'm sure that will make the cleric that got screwed next 6 day wait go that much quicker.<br />

<br />
I think lists suck.<br />
<br />
But the point is that if you can't kill Ragefire at will then you are SOL.  Not only SOL but you should be SOL.  I don't have rights to other spawns that my guild alone can't kill.  I don't have rights to anything that my guild can't alone kill.<br />
<br />
It isn't that people think they are entitled to theirs before others but the fact that people aren't entitled to their epic before others that makes list dumb.<br />
<br />
Why should anyone on a list be more entitled than someone not on it?<br />
<br />
It is the whole point of the PNP.  No camping.  No KSing.  If what was said is true then this is a KS and was wrong.  If they engaged first it is unfortunate to the camping party.<br />
<br />
I think it is rediculous to force someone to sit at a place for that long to expect something.  I think it is just as rediculous to actually sit there for that long.<br />
<br />
I do not ever plan on &quot;camping&quot; Ragefire, but I do at some point plan on having my epic.  I will fairly engage Rage under the rules set forth by Verant as stupid as they may be, they also save me from having to waste so much time doing nothing.<br />
<br />
I find it commendable that Servers can come together and figure out a solution that works well for their community.  But I don't see it as necessary, and I find it rediculous to enforce these non-unanamous decisions on others that want no part of it.  When there is a significantly large population going against some forced solution it ether needs to be rethought or you need to be aware that there will be rebels with as much right as those that forced the standards on them in the first place.</div></div><hr />

<br />
SIMPLE SOLUTION!<br />
<br />
1)Put a No Drop, Lore, No Rent container item someplace in SkyFire that has a groundspawn rate similar to the current RF. Have the item spawn in the same spot or even better have it spawn in 1 of several spots. <br />
<br />
2) Have the pearl from SolB combined with the no rent container to form a new item that when given to a common NPC in SK summons RF immediately.<br />
<br />
DONE! Nuff said, <br />
<br />
- RF would be no more common than he is now, the No Rent Container would control the fequency he can be spawned<br />
<br />
- NoKSing, You'd NEED the rare No Drop Piece and the Pearl to get RF to spawn. At that point its obvious who has the &quot;right&quot; to kill him<br />
<br />
- The end becomes more fair. Small guild or big alliance, you have an opportunity to be in the right place at the right time and get the piece you need to finish your quest. You don't need to ruin yours and your friends real lives to camp SF to pick up a rare No Drop piece and combined it with an item you should already have.<br />
<br />
- Doesn't change the current quest HARDLY at all!<br />
<br />
<br />
Morrun, with regards to ShowEQ... <br />
Nothing would change. You can use SEQ right now to keep track of spawns. But even if you could see where and when this No Drop, Lore, No Rent Container spawned, all you could do is find a cleric who needs it and tell them. It doesn't stop some other cleric camping the zone from finding it first. <br />
<br />
The point is that this solution would be FAR superior to the way it is now. I'd like to hear ANY practical or theoretic arguments against implimenting this right now today? Heck, I'm sending this thread in to VI in fact, it shows the crap that happens AND a simple way to stop it!</div></div><hr />

<br />
Verant should separate the rez effect item from the epic.  Make the rez effect item some separate quest that is only doable after you have your epic and results in an ammo slot item with no stats no wt and simply click effect: revivscience.<br />
<br />
Then replace every cleric epic in game with the new epic + ammo item.  At that point they could change the bottleneck on ragefire, make him triggerable whatever.<br />
<br />
Also, the bottleneck in the ammo item thing should be a random mob that can spawn in like 1 of 5 different zones.  Or something equally hard to camp.<br />
<br />
As for ground spawns and SEQ, it shouldn't be that hard to see people that are sitting in a corner of a zone (if you want to watch for it) that stand up and make a beeline for ground spawns as they spawn.  <br />
<br />
The best way if you wanted to do a ground spawn item would be to have it spawn/despawn in like 5-10 second intervals in a couple different zones.  Would spawn for 10 seconds, despsawn, spawn somewhere else, despawn until somebody actually picked one up at which time it would not spawn again for however long it took.  <br />
<br />
SEQ would then just let you know it's spawning, but probably never fast enough to go run all the way to it and grab it.<br />

Hello, watching the ground is no fun.<br />
<br />
I appreciate your concern for the problems with the quest, but vehemently disagree with both Dasmiter's and Thecklos's proposed solutions.  I'll be damned if I'm running around and staring at the ground hoping to grab a 10 second ground spawn.  That's just silly.<br />
<br />
Verant just needs to grow a pair of balls, grandfather in the Clerics who are waiting on Ragefire so they can finish and re-design the quest compleletely.  They should re-design the other quests too to bring some parity to the game.  It's ridiculous right now.<br />

<br />
They do NOT want any ITEM spawning Ragefire cause they're sick of it. Ragefire is KS'able and will be KSable until they get around to redesigning the WHOLE quest.<br />
<br />
I for one really hope they put something in in the Planes of Power where you get sent to YOUR OWN ZONE so no one else can get in there with you. This would alleviate EVERYONE'S problems.</div></div><hr />

Cleric started camping RF Tuesday May 28th 2 PM EST was at RF camp 24/7 with several guildmates and friends. Of course we noticed the occasional &quot;pop - up scout&quot; But it wasn't until this morning (Monday June 3rd) at about 5:30 am that we noticed one of the &quot;uber&quot; scouts pop up. About 20min later every single member in the guild who was on line appears in the zone. WTF? So of course not to be show up we call in our troops as well. So Guildleaders start talking, uber_guild01 feeds us the FFA BS line blah blah blah, and then start training Chromodracs (sp?) on us to disspell our raid group. nice eh? /petition. Enter GM. Blah blah blah....&quot;uber_guild01 stop training mobs.&quot; At this point we have 30+ people in the zone to help us when/if RF spawns. <br />
10:00AM P O P right smack dab in the middle of our little camp circle,/log, engage, dead. RF pops again right on top of our raid party /log, engage, dead, KS'D :O( Dispite being warned Uber_guild01 sees fit they they need the RF loot more than anyone else in the entire server. BAH! The next thing that happens ....GM's all over RF camp....Guildleader talks to them and at this point it is going to lead GM for our server. Hopefully with all the /report /log chat and /petition will prevail. <br />
The reason why I though this was fishy is I wonder if it was more than pure stupid dumb luck that they came in force 4 hours before the spawn or is there a new cheat program availiable that VI doesn't know about yet?<br />
BTW not to mention any names but the Uber_guild01 is called **cough** N O V A E **cough**  http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/smile.gif<br />

My very favorite part about the cleric epic is that it is the WORST SOLID CAMP (Solid not being. Run into com with 6 people, kill black reaver, look for jade reaver drop, come back in an hour for a month (I would enjoy it. Could you imagine the loot? MoSS's would rot like crazy, and everyone of your small helping group would have their ears sprouting with Black Reaver junk). 5 minutes an hour. Heck, even bind people there to do it. RAGEFIRE is the WORST SOLID CAMP. Not worst for rare items in rare raids from rare mobs. WORST FOR STARING AT THE GROUND. WAITING. WORST FOR KS'ING. You don't here stuff like this for the<br />

Beastlord<br />
Druid<br />
Shaman (2 in my guild have their epics lol)<br />
Necromancer<br />
Mage<br />
Wizzard<br />
Enchanter<br />
Epics.<br />
Why? Alot are &quot;3 gate in, kill, no epic, come back in hour and port out (If you can get a wizzie to port in out, mage for COH (especcally the Kedge Keep guy for the mage, which I hear is pretty much the bottleneck). Warrior/Bard Scales? &quot;Hey, vox/naggy up now. Lets go kill them if we have the force&quot;. Nobody was sitting at the camp spot to tell you not to. Druid epic's Fayeieydrawayr (Mangled alot) is &quot; Port to boat zone. Catch boat. Boat along hitting track&quot;. (Or is it triggered, which would be Easier).<br />
I don't know much about other epics (I think I should go read up on every one of them, be worth my time), but I can safely say the cleric one would benifit from being more like the ghoulbane. Give us 30 different level 58-65 mobs on a 3 hour timer each in raid zones, and some open zones. And in the Bottom of Kaeorsa/Nurga/Durga/Dalnir/unused kunark dungeon 01. Make one drop from a Terrisnia repop thats level 59 and aoes   cold 200pt nuke that gives the effect of shadow vortex (SK atk debuff)(frozen shadow   http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/biggrin.gif) in TOFS. Make it take 90 hours anyways, but in a way we could do it a bit at a time, or pick up a part while raiding. There would be some of a choke point based on the mob's repop time, and which parts are easiest/fastest/clostest to a common zone cause: &quot;Somebody is camping such and such. Lets try other part I don't have yet&quot;. <br />
Please, don't put it in anything below a 30+ zone however, cause by then people know a bit more bout the game. (A Kobold Emmisary near Steamfont Mino Caves. Level 27 Shaman that a 23 cleric/30 druid/24 monk/26 Enchanter had problems with. In a NEWBIE ZONE. Its for the Cleric Symbol of Quellious Btw)<br />

Could somebody show me a flaw in this Idea?<br />

<br />
The point is that 40 different things that are on a 3 hour timer STILL means that the entire quest takes 40*3 hours to do! You can't get around that. If 40 people are doing the quest at once, then each one doing a different part means they'd all do all the parts in 120 hours. Period. VI won't go for that its WAY to easy. Quantity of steps does not a good quest make.<br />
<br />
Not to Rayne's comments...<br />
<br />
OMG. You people just want to re-create Stumpwatch.<br />
<br />

<br />
Rayne<br />
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br />
<br />
I also disagree with a despawning ground spawn. The Ground spawn should be left there until someone picks it up, or possibly despawn after 24 hours, maybe. But the next one should spawn 72-120 hours (3-5 days) AFTER the current one is picked up.<br />
<br />
IMHO,your opinion is somewhat selfish. For you its borring having to wait for a ground spawn, thats cool and all becasue it is borring. BUT the way it is now brings out the absolute worst in the player population. I've never wanted to quit EQ becasue of the game itself, just like the game itself hasn't kept me playing for over 3 years. Its the players, the people behind the PCs that make the experience good or bad. <br />
<br />
VI has said and done things to limit the amount of damage that &quot;grief&quot; players can do. Apparently they feel that a few people who derive pleasure at other paying peoples expense is not good for the game on a whole. That said, the current RF setup goes against this philospohy! In fact it encourages and in some cases forces us all to engage in grief activities in order to complete the quest. This is no longer an &quot;in game&quot; problem. Real people are getting real angry because they're getting screwed out of their time and energy by people taking advantage of a loophole that VI won't fix.<br />
<br />
My solution resolves that problem. Screw SEQ, it does what it does regardless of a ground spawn or whatever. If it provides and unfair advantage in one case, then it provides and unfair advantage in ALL cases.<br />
<br />
The bottom line is that quest NEEDS to be changed. Not everyone is going to achieve every quest. I for one DON'T want to see the quest made any easier. I DON'T want to see RF spawn any more frequently than he does now. What I DO want is for there to be way to finish this quest without a small fraction of a server base being able to disrupt the play of everyone else.<br />
<br />
Heck I'd settle for VI saying that any guild caught KSing RF would be immediately disbanded and have accounts suspended. At least make people THINK before they just decide to intentionally screw over someone else.</div></div><hr />

You are very wrong about no other class having to camp mobs like RF. In some cases it's worse. In the case of Enchanters, they have to camp a mob in Neriak 3rd Gate (who came up with that bright idea?). So not only is the mob frequently KSed by two manaburn wizards and a level 20 enchanter, but you are doing nothing but sitting on your rump waiting for her to spawn because there's nothing else to do in the zone.<br />
<br />
There are some classes in the game whose epic is so hard to get because of camps like Verina Tomb. bah.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">DaSmiter</div><div class="date">06-24-2002, 05:41 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Lolli, you got it backwards! The enchanter part in Neriak 3rd Gate is MUCH easier. You have a statis spawn that is not &quot;easy&quot; to just gate in and kill. You have to either have your 1 or 2 killing groups (we did it with 2 non buffed, half dressed, half HP, half mana group of mid 50s). You kill the guy in 1 minute, then you loot the corpse...<br />
<br />
The cleric mob is by FAR the worst. <br />
<br />
You have an easy to get to, outdoor zone mob with both Wizard, Druid and walk in zones near by. Then you have the dual mobs. See what makes it screwed is that it doesn't matter who kills the original RageFire. A group can be hard at work killing him, then have a guild pop in at the last 10% and total jack the dragon as soon as he spawns. They don't even have to touch the guy you've been camping for 2 weeks straight. No other epic comes close to the human problems caused by the cleric epic.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">holyern</div><div class="date">06-24-2002, 07:22 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">First off I play on the Luclin server and we have had a list system from almost day one of the cleric epic being brought into being.  The 4 or 5 power guilds at the time decided that it was more productive to have a list and abide by it rather than fighting each other and really not gaining anyone any time.  The system has worked since they agreed to it with less than a handful of KS attempts in the whole time the list has been up and running.  All the guilds on the server work in cooperation and understand that the list is worth having.  Every once in a while there is a rumbling from clerics near the end of the 50+ cleric list but none seem to want to risk being blacklisted by trying to KS it.  If you do the math that 50 person list equates to about 40 or more week wait.  I personally would like to see them Change the epic quest a bit maybe make it tougher and with an end that doesnt promote KSing.</div></div><hr />
