<TEXTAREA NAME="EditedMessage" ROWS=10 COLS=45 WRAP="VIRTUAL">This is the same syndrome that drives people to justify 92 hour camps.

"I invested $N weeks of time in a obviously broken system, and refuse to believe that my time was not justified."

The only reason I play this game is to do fun stuff with my friends (IRL ones and new ones I've met in game). I believe most players are like me in that getting the Uber Doohickey of Phatness just really isn't that big deal, in the context of the rest of their lives, and killing a badly animated dragon really isn't that cool compared to going hiking across the Sandia mountains with your SO. That probably why I never went past the early 50s. I don't care enough to invest 80 hours a week to kill polygon baddies that will only respawn again 24 minutes later.

The overriding PVP mentality seems to be justifying your self worth by 1) how much stupid **** you will put up with, 2) beating up other people willing to put up with equal amounts of stupid **** to establish a pecking order.

I played on Rallos and Vallon for a while because I thought it would be fun. The same ****wits who farm out AC rings and constantly brag about PLing their latest twink to 50 with 45 second played on blue servers are a bunch of corpse campers and mindless gangbangers in PVP. 

How do you justify starting a caster group, PLing it to 4th or 5th level, then ganking newbies OF YOUR OWN RACE as they walk out the door for the first time? What sort of pathetic masturbation fantasy is that?

But that's Rallos. Maybe Vallon and Tallon are magical mystery lands where people don't have a little score counter telling them how many people they totally outmatched with their twink resist gear, sebilis weapons and fungi tunics, which is what I saw when I was there. Watching twenty teenish players in Oasis -try- to beat down a deleveled fungi monk with whatever the totally overpowered monk weapon du jour was pretty much killed any desire I had left to play THAT game.

I fully expect that if I went back to Rallos now I'd see that too, with so much Velious gear being NODROP.

So you survived playing on a PVP server. You are uber, you are phat, you rape hundreds of nekkid wood elves daily with your elite skills and RSI-inducing circle strafing. Congratulations, here's your prize, it's a big box of absolutely nothing, because this game doesn't give you anything other than what you brought to it. The only victory in EQ is having fun, and as far as I can tell the PVP servers simply don't have that option available, and the server population loads seem to indicate that I'm not alone in that sentiment.

You know what you get when start talking about how you're only playing if "You're on Rallos, rallos and ONLY rallos?" You get ignored, because the rest of us don't give a damn.

We now return you to your regularly scheduled fear of bind point camping.</TEXTAREA>
