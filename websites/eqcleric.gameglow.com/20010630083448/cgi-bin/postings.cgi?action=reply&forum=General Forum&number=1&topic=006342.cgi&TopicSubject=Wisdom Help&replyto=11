I just dinged level 43, and Im currently in Velious.  I belong to a very small guild(15 members) and I despise long camps.  There's about 1k pp in my bank account, and I have to figure out what to do with it. Forgive me if I mis-name things, I'm doing this from memory.  Some of it is pretty strange stuff, I know.  I don't want to lose too much AC, so I don't want to wear something like Ulthork Hide Sleeves, but I know I need a boost.<P>My wisdom with the following gear is 163.  <IMG SRC="http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/frown.gif"><P>Earrings: 1 Forest Loop, 1 Gold(?)

Good AC and Great WIS.  Plus they sell VERY cheap now.<P>Back.  Kunzar Cloak from Karnors Castle.  Very Common and it offers nice AC and 2 points of WIS.  Another choice is a Cloak of Ry`Gorr Oracles which offers 1 point less AC but I think the stats are slightly better.<P>Wrists.  Cleric Quest Bracers are the way to go.  9 AC and 5 WIS is an unbeatable combo.<P>Hands.  Gauntlets of the Black.  15 AC, 3 STR, 2 WIS.  These are falling in price everyday but you are also high enough level to camp for them with a group.  They drop off of Firbrand the Black in the Ry`Gorr fort (Blacksmith Room) and theyre his common drop<P>Waist. Crystalline Belt gives a combination of WIS and AC.  Cant remember the AC off hand though.  Look into it but it might not be a worthwhile upgrade.<P>Secondary. Charred Guardian Shield.  10 AC and 9 WIS.  Need I say more?<P>Range.  Totem of the Warrior Spirits if you feel like trying your luck with Grachnist the Destroyer.  Small Wisdom Diety for about 250pp or so.<BR><P>------------------<BR>Quistil Angelwatch<BR>Cleric of 37 Seasons in the service to the Great Mother Tunare<BR>Islington Angelwatch (Semi Retired)<BR>Paladin of 53 Seasons in the glorious service to Erollisi Marr<BR>Phoenix Crusaders</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#dedfdf"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Galavant</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Hi Llumis. Let me see what I can do for you, slot by slot.<P>HEAD: Your Runed Circlet is fine til something better comes along. All the good replacements for it are pretty high-budget.<P>EARS: Go get another Forest Loop. The extra AC and stats always help.<P>FACE: Consider upgrading to Velium when your budget permits. Look up Flyer in-game...he's an enchanter and master jeweler in my guild. Tell him I sent you. He should be able to hook you up at or close to cost.<P>NECK: There's now a series of quests in Felwithe for high elves like yourself that result in a AC7 WIS+3 neck, Warden Symbol of Tunare or something like that. Should be easy at your level.<P>SHOULDERS: Adamantine Epolets are AC9 WIS+7, fairly cheap (150 PPish) and one of the easier camps in Lower Guk.<P>BACK: A Kunzar Cloak (AC7 WIS+2 INT+2 Fire+10) should be pretty cheap. The Mammoth Cloak (AC7 WIS+4 Cold+5) is expensive, but you and the people you regularly group can camp it easily...it drops from the Goblin Alchemist in Permafrost.<P>CHEST: You're doing fine here. If you really feel the need to upgrade your AC, a Dusty BP or EBBP will give some more in that area.<P>ARMS: Never heard of Ancient Sleeves. I wear Donal's myself, before that I wore the quest arms.<P>WRISTS: You can camp the ogres in WK for some Chipped Bone Bracers (AC4 WIS+5) or get the quest bracers as you mentioned. Since you're a high elf, and high elves usually need STR, you may want to go to Sol B and get a pair of Runed Mithril Bracers (AC4 STR+3 WIS+5) instead of the quest bracers.<P>HANDS: Gauntlets of the Black. Great AC, STR and WIS all in one package. Not a hard camp either, just go to the orc fort in EW. Firbrand the Black drops them, along with the Dark Ember...a good upgrade to your main hand if you need it.<P>RINGS: See my comments under "FACE".<P>WAIST: Go into Crystal Caverns and camp up a Crystalline Belt (AC5 WIS+3 INT+3, among other things). As an aside, CC is a great place to farm if you need money.<P>LEGS: Quest legs are fine. I'm working on the quest for Kromrif Military Leggings myself, they're a nice upgrade. Sell the Rygorr, you can get about 400 PP for them.<P>FEET: Quest boots are fine too. If you really want, you can try to get a pair of Frosted Velium Boots from Icewell Keep...problem is they're no drop, so you have to see if anyone has left some laying.<P>PRIMARY: Wraithbone Hammer is good for now. Most things you'd upgrade this with are beyond your budget anyhow.<P>SECONDARY: The Testament of Vanear is an easy quest and gives WIS+10 Mana+10. If you put your Spirit Tome in main hand, you'll look like you're holding two books. Llumis the Librarian.   <IMG SRC="http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/smile.gif"> And as you mentioned, a CGS is always a good option for your off hand.<P>RANGED: I use a Medicine Totem, but that's way past your budget. A Small Wisdom Deity is cheap. You'd have to balance it against whatever you already have there though.<P>Hope all this helps, see you in game.

You have more Wisdom then I did at level 47    <IMG SRC="http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/smile.gif"><P>Like you mentioned, the quest bracers should be top priority.<P>You could sacrafice a few points of AC and get a Bloodstained Tunic (4 WIS I think).<P>Also, you could get a Small Wisdom Diety for your range slot.  It's a player made item with the pottery skill.  It offers 3 WIS for your Range, and I've seen it selling for around 150pp.<P>Some people forget that there are other clerics out there besides high elves.  I'm a Human Cleric, and I started out with 96 WIS.  I'm now at 200 WIS at level 52, but I didn't break the 170 mark in WIS until I started getting my Etherial Mist (from plane of Hate).<P>It's quite a challenge to get over 100 WIS.  High Elves are spoiled with starting WIS in the 130 range :P<P>PS: I'm *STILL* Wearing a Bronze Cloak at level 52.  Had it since level 7 :P.  It's hard to get many upgrades.  Kunzar cloaks are small races only so I cant fit that.  Mammoth Cloaks have less AC and I don't want to sacrafice the AC.<P>------------------<BR><A HREF="http://eq.castersrealm.com/players/view_profile.asp?Id=8476" TARGET=_blank>Badany Greatheal</A><BR>Vicar of the Prime Healer Rodcet Nife<BR>Zebuxoruk<P>[This message has been edited by Badany (edited 05-23-2001).]<p>[This message has been edited by Badany (edited 05-23-2001).]</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#dedfdf"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Mirriana_00</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Haha.

I say that I don't really camp much, and he trades me a kunzar cloak.  I told him I couldn't wear it, but he said I needed to keep it anyways.<P>Anyways, gloves of the black are fairly cheap on Fennin.  Like 1-2K or less now.

Doing part 3 of the 10 part series of Coldain Prayer Shawl quests nests you the 3rd shawl and the Thurgadin Seal. AC3, 3wis, 30mana. You lose 2AC, 2wis, pick up 30 mana, and it's FREE.<P>Well, nearly free. I spent 10pp to learn enough baking to do the quest. <P>Go to Freeport, buy a couple stacks of wolf/rat meat and a few stacks of bread amd a spit. Combine 1 meat, 1 bread in the spit and make a sandwich. Once you trivial those (26 for rat, 31 for wolf), go to the guy in the first Inn in EC that sells baking supplies and buy a few stacks of "jug of sauces". Go to the dock in FP, buy fresh fsh. 1 fish, 1 jug = 2 fish fillets. (trivial at 82). Now go to the last Inn in EC where the lady is that sells all the spell components and buy a dozen or 2 batwings. Then go to the docks and buy an equal # of fresh fish. 1 wing, 1 fish in your spit and you make fish rolls. Trivial at 135. Took me about 2 hours.<P>At 135 baking you can do the 3rd quest easily. This series of quests also nets a shoulder item that gets a little better each time you "upgrade". I currently have a 5ac, 5wis, 5int, 5cr shawl, and am working on the tailoring skill to do the 6th step. The shawl I have is not (yet) better than Adamantite Epoletes, but by #7, it is. #7 is 7ac, 7wis, 7int, 7cr/dr/pr, permanent, STACKABLE effect of Flowing Thought I.

You'll get good xp and a pair of epolets quickly, got my pair the first hour I was there and a second set dropped 3 hours later.<P>2)Sell that spirit tome, prices vary and have come down but you should get 1-2k for it.

As we ran around trying to find griffons on track he killed whatever he wanted. In the end it took 2 hours to get my 3 eggs.
