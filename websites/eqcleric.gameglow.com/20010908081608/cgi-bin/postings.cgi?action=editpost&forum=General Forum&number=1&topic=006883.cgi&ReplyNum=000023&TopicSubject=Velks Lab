<TEXTAREA NAME="EditedMessage" ROWS=10 COLS=45 WRAP="VIRTUAL">Hmm, haven't been there since the change, probably because I haven't played EQ since the change =P.  A few comments from a Velketor's veteran:

The upstairs kobold camp (which was where you'd commonly find Tpos) was one of the best XP camps in the game, bar none, for anyone 53+.  I used that spot to power Rayne through 59, and power my SK to 60.  At times we'd average 70k+ per minute experience.  It was just incredible.  There's no risk there and even if you screw up and pull Tpos without proper preparation CR would take 10 minutes max.

The downstairs Kobold pits was second to only the upstairs area.  Sure the dispelling orbs were a pain, but you would only have to fight near one during the initial drop down (and not always then).  There were several safe rooms to pull to.  The loot from both upstairs and downstairs was mostly mediocre stuff, but occasionally a very nice item would drop, er, nice if you weren't in an "uber" guild.

The pre-patch spiders were all green in the 50s and existed to be an obstacle to get to the good places.  They were basically only obstacles to Clerics and Warriors; everyone else invis'd past them with ease.  Well, I did with my Cleric too, just cost me 12pp an Invis potion.

The spiders you'd find in the kobold pits were much tougher, but had the chance of a rare that might drop a very nice item.  The experience wasn't great, but it was something to do.

The golems after the upstairs kobold pit (near Velk) were definitely a nice challenge for a single group of high 50s players.  We spent a few evenings taking out Kerdelb, Bledrek, etc and basically stopped because we quit EQ.  We were hoping for those very nice leggings (forget name, ac 35 or so), but they never dropped.

Never did Velk or Lord Djoll., but saw every bit of the zone.  It was a very nice place to spend an evening; good xp, empty of other players, and convenient as hell.  Sirens Grotto was the only other zone to compare with it, and at that only from a convenience standpoint.  Mobs in SG were generally a pita to kill and once you've farmed the cloaks out of there, only reason to go was for gems (the well full of sirens near the WW zone was excellent for high end gems).

Frankly it seems to me that Velketor's was due to become popular even without the upgrade for the reasons stated by others above.  With the ever increasing 50+ population people just had to try it.
