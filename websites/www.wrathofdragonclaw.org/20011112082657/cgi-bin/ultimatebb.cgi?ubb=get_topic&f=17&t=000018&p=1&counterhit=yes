     Scalpel was not in a good mood. He was glad to get out of the tiny tent, but the pungent smell of incense still clung to his clothes and had made his eyes tear. He was not overly fond of the gypsies, but still, they often had useful, if not cryptic information to be had...for a price.<P>     He strode out into the sun with a frown firmly affixed to his thin face, but was stopped sunddenly by a small tug on his hand. The frown soften, as he looked down to the face of his son; The reason for his visit to the gypsy. Max was a beautiful child with a tossle of straberry-blond locks, but was somewhat pale of complexion. "Thin." Thought Scalpel. "But then again, he comes by it honestly." Scalpel then glanced to his son's eyes. Ah, those eyes; soft blue-green orbs, alwyas darting and always taking in. Scalpel just wished Max would tell him what it was that he saw and what it was he was looking at.<P>     For 9 years his son had been thus: Growing slowly, seldomly speaking, and when he did speak, it was usually only one of a handful of words.<P>     "Why did you bring him to me? He's obviously retarded. Better fit for a work camp than wasting time on him." The leech in the city had told Scalpel. That DID bring a smile to Scalpels' face - He wondered if the Lugweilers' Dismal Itch spell had finally worn off the quack by now. How he hated doctors!<P>     He had consulted Gort and Farreach too. They had been more hopeful but still baffled. "Hey der." Gort said. "Dis child ain't no dummy, I can tell you dat. But why he don't speak?...I can't say."<P>     The gypsy had seen the same thing. "No, he's not retarded - More like asleep. Deep waters flow strong beneath the clam surface. Perhaps he just needs the right pebble tossed in to break the surface." The gypsy went to a shelf and picked up a trinket. "Here," She said. " I see you gonna take the boy fishing after this. For only 5 more platinum I throw in this charm, helps you catch the really big one's, eh?" Scalpel still wondered why he had bought the foolish charm - A small green dragon with opal eyes. "Oh well," He thought. "Maybe Alrad (his wife) would like it."<P>   So they walked, he and his son, enjoying the bright day and the sounds of spring all around them. "I'll stop by Mcdfuffys'," He thought. "Maybe he'll go with us." <P>     "Want to see Mcduffy, Max?"<P>     His son looked up at him and fairly beamed. Max liked the old halfling. He was patient with him, and didn't try to get him to talk. Subsequently, he usually said more to Mcduffy than he did most people.<P>     They soon arrived at Mcduffys' but found the halfling not at home. "Gone to get pipeweed and porkrinds," said the note on the door. Scalpel laughed. The old halfling was, of course, now so fabulously wealthy he could have had servants do his shopping for him, but he knew that what he really enjoyed doing was going into town to dicker with the merchants.<P>     Scalpel got out the small dragon charm and thought to leave it behind, as a joke, for Mcduffy. As he got ready to place the dragon by his doorstep, something odd happend. The dragon turned its head! Suddenly the small figurine felt warm and heavy. Scalpel gasped as waves of emerald light came corruscating out of the charm, enveloping he and his son. His vision blurred as they were drawn into a shimmering green vortex and taken to a differnt plane.<P>     When he gathered his senses, Scalpel took in the new surroundings. Grassland, as far as they eye could see. He looked to his son, who was used to seeing his father use magic, and found the child looking back, calm and secure. "This is not my doing son, but hang on - we'll get out of here soon."<P>      He had just let go of his son's hand to get his book out of his backpack, when he felt a sharp tug on his robes. "It's here." Said his son's small voice.<P>     Scalpel looked to his son, and then around. He din't see anything. "What son? What's h-.....?"<P>     "Oooof!" The air exploded out of Scalpel's lungs as he was hit hard in the back. At the same time he heard a loud "Whoosh" above his head, and he was knocked to the ground.<P>     "What the...?" Scalpel felt something warm and wet running down his back, soaking into his robe. He looked at his son, whose face was filled with terror."Daddy!" He screamed.<P>     "Whoosh!" Scalpel was rocked back on his heels as he was struck in the forehead. This time though, he caught a glimpse of the foe, and it nearly buckled over - It was a dragon; Huge, fast and terribly strong. He knew then that it was just toying with him. It could have killed them both in its first attack. <P>     Scalpel threw himself into his spell, using all his training to keep concentrating despite the pain of his wounds. "Liberatas est agronamus magnus me aida!" He shouted.<P>     The earth at his feet began to bulge, and a rent formed. Liquid rock began to bubble out of the crack and form into a huge muscled shape. Scalpel had little hope that this elemental could defeat the dragon, but he had other ideas.<P>     "Yessss Massster" It slowly said.<P>     "Protect the boy" Scalpel ordered, and he turned to meet his foe.<P>     "Whoosh!" Scalpel was again knocked back as a talon drove into his chest and broke a rib. He looked down to see  bright red foam coming out of his chest. He tried to talk, but found that little air would come to his lips. He fell to his knees. He knew then and there that he was done for.<P>     Huge wings beat the earth, as the dragon settled in. Scalpel turned and tried to rise to his feet to meet the monster, but found that his legs would not obey. "Run son." was all that he could manage to say. He heard and felt the ponderous steps of the beheamoth as they shook the earth coming toward him. He was on the very verge of blackness.<P>     Scalpel reached to his neck and pulled out the small crystal rod, and with his last ounce of strength, he broke it into. " My freinds, come quickly...help save...my child."<P>     He looked to his son, but saw determination, not fear in his face. What was he saying? Something he had heard Mcduffy say in some spell at one time he thought. Scalpel then felt the talon drive into his back and begin lifting him into the air. The pain was incredible!<P>     All at once, he stopped rising and slid off the talon. He looked up to see the dragon, frozen, inches from his face.  With that, darkness overtook him and he knew no more.<BR>     <BR>     <p><FONT COLOR="#3299CC" SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial">[Edited 1 time by Scalpel Spelsmith on 21 April 2001 at 02:02]</font>

"WHAT?"<BR>I ask as if enraged.<BR>"You are telling me porkrinds have gone up to 4 silver for a pound?"<P>The halfling merchant rolls her eyes. She knows full well I do not care about the price of rinds. Sometimes she appears to enjoy my eccentricities but today she seems less patient. "Mr. Callanish, if big fancy adventurers like you would stop brining in treasure by the wagonload we would not have all this inflation."<P>Suddenly the game of haggeling becomes less interesting to me. That telepathic bond between guildmembers is tugging at my consciousness. <P>How strange. Even when getting messages from Hate or Fear they have always been crystal clear. If I have missed them, it has been due to my own distractions. This message however is vague and distorted. It is from Scalpel, that much I can feel. It is a call for help. I feel that in the emotion of the message more than a clear picture of his words.<P>The halfing merchant asks if I am alright and I hear concern in her voice but my attention is rivited to this vaguge communication from my close friend and guildmate.<BR>I mutter something assuring her that I am alright an move to a more secluded location.<BR>Cloaking myself in anonymity to avoid the many requests my druidic spells and level of skill often attract, I concentrate on that guildbond that allows us to devine the location of fellow members.<P>The picture I recieve is of a lovely place, soft and green yet alien. The name that comes with it is cryptic to me. Grodawn. This place I have never heard of.<P>I project my thoughts to all available guildmates. "Scalpel is calling for help but I am having trouble locating him. This is a call to arms. Get his location if you can and let me know if you need to be picked up somewhere. We may well be on an impromtu raid here. And does anyone know where the hell Grodawn is?"<P>While waiting for responses I begin learning my travel spells and bookmarking my combat spells for a quick change.  <P>

A skeleton swings and misses me, Darn Skeletons are too stupid to not attack me. So I just keep running knowing I am faster than it. The world dissolves for a moment and as I am transported I think to myself Since when do Skeletons summon?.<P>Here. Green fields, but I don't recognize them, Max, BIG dragon, Scalpels corpse, Damn I'm not in the Karanas anymore.<P>Casting. The dragons feet adhere to the ground. "Max MOVE BACK NOW!" Then I realize Max is casting, I've heard it often enough to know what it is. To the guild "pick up Max in Misty at the circle." <P>Dragon swipes at me. Flurry af Bites and claws ends up with about a fifth of my life gone. I can see he wants to attack Max, but I am closer and so he is compeled to attack me.<P>Roar! I resist the dragon fear. Well not really, but I don't run. <P>Pop! Max is gone , and so am I, turning to run. Gah! that hurts as another chunk of health is ripped away. Stunned, I wait for the next hit and cringe as another chunk of hits is ripped out. No longer stuned I run, getting out of his reach he breathes.<P>Poison, I notice as I wish I could keep more spells memorized. Out of range I sit flipping the book open with the quikness of a thousand practices.<P>Blast it! Thats what I get for rearranging my book.Flipping pages, there it is. Forget this mem that. stand, refresh hurry. cast and the poison is abolished. Time to run again.<P>To the guild "I can keep running but I am not sure where to go. Can't leave Scalpel's corpse here anyway. Maybe Max knows where I am or how to get here?"<P>I feel the magic that bound the dragon fade. <P>"I will stay here as long as I can. Let me know what is going to be happening.<sheepish grin>"<P>Running. Circles, I think, looking back, BIG circles.

Nutryneaux reclined languidly on the curve of a grassy hillside as the sun made its journey into the horizon. Soft new blades of verdant grass laid beneath her supple form like a plush carpet and she relished the feel of it against her arms and fingers.  A sudden clank of metal nearby roused her from her half-slumber. Opening her eyes, she was met by a floating weapon and shield above her head. <P>"Meme?" the endearment came from none other but her son as he knelt beside her, his voice seemingly strained and urgent.<P>"What is it, mon fille?" Nutry resounded fondly and smiled warmly up at the flaxen haired young elf.<P>"I *feel* that something has happened..." Xenshen began his face contorted as if searching for the proper words. "Someone from the guild is in great danger."  He was a psion, gifted with the talents of the mind,a manipulator of thought, an enchanter of cognition. <P>Nutryneaux's face grew sullen and she sat up quickly placing her diminutive hands on his arms. She searched her son's face. "Xenshen, who is in danger?"  Some where in a the back of her thoughts, she was greatly relieved it wasn't Pyrus or Xenshen would have said so. Still the ominous tone in her son's voice was alarming. She squeezed his hands gently in hers as she watched him grapple with the warnings he was receiving in his mind. <P>Nutryneaux stood and wiped blades of grass from her leathers, then gently touched her son's cheek. "Thank you, mon fille. Have no fear, I will go immediately to the guildhall and see what there is to know."<P>The trees in the valley were awash with bountiful succulent new leaves. The child of the green jogged in between the myriad of trunks and disappeared into the threshold making her way to the guildhall.<P>------------------<BR>   <IMG SRC="http://members.aol.com/siihouette/nutry23.jpg">   <p><FONT COLOR="#3299CC" SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial">[Edited 1 time by Nutryneaux LunaNuit on 20 April 2001 at 17:29]</font>

"Pick Max up in the circle at Misty." I hear at least that much of Gort's call. Still distorted and vague but unmistakable in its intent this time. There was more but I could not catch it nor waste time on it at the moment.<P>I slap my book closed and head to the nearby tunnel that bores through the hills and leads to Misty Thickett. It would have taken me longer to learn the teleport than to run there considering my proximity to the standing circle of stones.<P>On the way, there is barely time to consider how Gort came by this information. If the fuzzy comunicae he sent is any indication, my guess would be that he is now where Scalpel was when he called for help.<P>Reaching the circle of stones I see Max. He is crying and looks freightened, yet it is more the kind of fear I have seen in the faces of people in battle than on children filled with terror. <P>The last thing to do here would be to yell for Max to tell me anything. Whatever it was in his head that caused him to be so silent would clamp down like a trap if he was put under any pressure to speak at this point. I waste a precious second just staring at him patiently. <P>His trembling hand comes up. There is a curious little fetish in it shaped like a green dragon. I reach out to take it. It, ever so slowly, begins to turn its head in my direction. "Not yet" I say quietly to myself as I toss it into one of my pockets. There is a strong feeling in this item and I believe I have found the way to wherever Scalpel, and probably Gort, are.<P>My thoughts go out to the guildmembers as strongly as I can project them to gain attention.<BR>"EVERYONE AVAILABLE... MEET AT THE DEN NOW"

"Aren't you done yet?" I silently ask Kirico as I impatiently sit in the town market.  Marshalling the discipline learned over many years I calm my thoughts and attempt to become one with nature.<P>I feel the grass beneath me and ease into the flow of the life forces that surround all.  Slowly I feel my reserves of the arcane fill to their full potential.<P>"Only a moment more, love," comes the reply.  "She was in a particularly foul mood and I had to play her a tune before she would make it for me."<P>On the whole towns don't appeal to me- too much destruction and no regard for the life that already exists where the people want to dig.  As towns go, though, Rivervale isn't as bad as many.  The halflings that are the primary inhabitants seem to care for nature more than most.<P>"Excuse me, miss, but are you going to be teleporting to the commonlands soon?"  I look up to see a huge barbarian warrior standing in front of me.  Sigh, I could have sworn that I was being inconspicuous in this corner.<P>"I'm sorry, but I am waiting on a friend and then we are going to the Toxulla Forest.  Tis only noon, Kithicor Forrest should be safe if you hurry."  He mutters his thanks as he takes his leave.  Soon I see him talking to another across the market.  Brother, what some people will do to avoid a little walk.<P>I feel my mind relax as I hear Kirico approaching.  Always singing some sort of song he is just a joy to be around.<P>"Ok, I have the Jumjum," he says once he is by my side,"next on the list is Erud's Tonic."<P>"Toxulla Forrest is the closest I get to Erudin," I remind him.  I am just about to start the incantation when I hear faintly "pick up Max in Misty at the circle".  It is Gort, a good friend and high priest.  But what is he doing with Max?  I can't recall a time when I have seen Max and Scalpel hasn't been there.  I look at Kirico and see that he also heard the message.<P>"Come on, we aren't far from there," he said taking out his drum.  "It will only take a few minutes."<P>I nod quickly and stand.  A quick mental search and I verify that I have my greatest healing power available to command.  Kirico starts tapping his drum and I feel my blood start to rush through my veins.  My feet are light as a feather and I feel that I can outrace the fastest demon.  Kirico runs for the edge of town and I follow close at his heels.  I pay close attention as more than once I have missed a turn and crashed into a wall at this great speed.<P>Within moments we racing out of the town and heading for the circle of stones that serves as the entry point for those druids powerful enough to open the correct portals.<P>We come upon the standing stones poking up out of the mist from which this area draws its name.  As we approach I hear strong and clear "EVERYONE AVAILABLE, MEET AT THE DEN NOW".  It is McDuffy our venerable leader.<P>We come to the crest and see McDuffy standing next Max.  Max is trembling and McDuffy is trying to calm him.  Kirico stops singing and we slow down so as not to startle Max even more.<P>"What has happened?" Kirico asks when we are within speaking distance.  McDuffy looks up.  He is about as tall as the nine year old boy, but his face shows that he is no yearling.<P>"It isn't very clear," McDuffy begins,"it seems that Scalpel and Gort are in trouble.  Max managed to get away.  I believe that it has something to do with this charm."  The guildleader reaches into his pocket and pulls out a curious little totem in the shape of a green dragon.<P>I can feel the power in it as I gaze upon it.  It is alive!  I reach for it while McDuffy and Kirico say something that I cannot understand.  I take it from McDuffy's hand and feel the power pulsing in it- it envelopes me.  Kirico is shouting and from a distance I feel a pain in my hand, but it is too late.  The world disolves and I am no longer in the Misty Thicket.

I pause as I see the expression on Kizzie's face.  Obviously, she has not had a good day.  I get out my lute and I play the Carillion that I learned so many years ago.  Her face softens as she hears the music.  Always a crowd pleaser, that little ditty.<P>"Ah, then it is you again, Kirico" she says breaking into a smile. "Can I interest you in a ..., no there is only one thing that ye buy from me.  I'll lay you odds that you want some more Jumjum."<P>"Right as always, Kizzie." I carefully move up to the counter.  Though I am not a large person, the shops and houses were all built by halflings.  I feel like I should walk around on my knees to get the proper perspective sometimes. Carefully, I remove the three honeycomb from my backpack and lay them on the counter.  Reaching into my money pouch I grab a fistful of gold.  Counting carefully, I lay out 30 of the gold coins.  "Here you go,"<P>Deftly, she scoops the honeycombs into one drawer and the gold into another.  It is amazing to watch because she only uses one quick swipe of her small hand.<P>"Aren't you done yet?" I hear a voice in my head from my love, Jaia.  She gets irritable if we spend to long in town and we are rapidly approaching her tolerance.<P>"Only a moment more, love," I reply. "She was in a particularly foul mood and I had to play her a tune before she would make it for me."<P>I wait patiently while Kizzie goes into the back of the shop and fishes around for the proper item.  Finally, she comes back with the sealed jar of Jumjum.  A few more moments of small talk and I am headed out the door with my prize humming the tune that helps those of the arcane arts focus their meditations.  Fishing out the shopping list I cross off Jumjum and read the next item- Erud's Tonic.  Oof, it is a good thing that Jaia is humoring me with all of her "nature's gates" as she likes to call them.<P>I watch with some amusement as the barbarian warrior bows and takes his leave from her.  As she didn't even bother to stand he must have been asking to teleport to some far away place.<P>Ok, I have the Jumjum, next on the list is Erud's Tonic."<P>"Toxulla Forrest is the closest I get to Erudin," she says.  That isn't too far and I am about to comment on that when all of a sudden I hear a quiet voice say, "pick up Max in Misty at the circle."  It takes me a moment, but I recognize Gort's voice.  With just a hint of strain in it I know that it must be serious.  I have seen the wise holy man face down things that would make the most courageous warrior tremble with fear with nothing but a lackadaisical "Hey der, what have we here?"<P>"Come on, we aren't far from there," I say taking out my drum. "It will only take a few minutes".  Jaia nods and stands up as I begin tapping lightly on my drum.  The ancient melody making my blood course through my veins, my feet so light that they seem to not even touch the ground.  I run in the direction of the Misty Thicket.<P>It seems to take mere moments to get to the edge of town and enter the thicket.  I slow slightly and change course as the path to the druid's circle is one I know well.  As I spy the stones in the distance I hear "EVERYONE AVAILABLE, MEET AT THE DEN NOW". It is  McDuffy, leader of the guild and a halfling worthy of much respect.  I come to the top of the hill that hosts the standing stones as if a crown upon the land.  I see our leader standing with Max.  From this distance if I didn't know better I might be tempted to think that Max was the elder, although closer scrutiny would soon show the error.<P>I stop playing my drum and we slow down.  Often, people are unnerved by my swift approaches and Max looks to be agitated.<P>"What has happened?" I ask when we are within speaking distance.<P>"It isn't very clear," McDuffy says, looking up at me,"it seems that Scalpel and Gort are in trouble. Max managed to get away. I believe that it has something to do with this charm."  McDuffy reaches into his pocket and pulls out a tiny figurine.  It is of a green dragon with opal eyes.  I bend down to examine it.  The opals glitter, seemingly with a life of their own.<P>"What is that?" I ask turning to him.<P>"I don't know," he replies,"Max had it.  I can only assume that it is what trapped Scalpel and Gort.  It has great power, I can sense it."<P>"What do you.." I begin, then trail off.  Jaia has picked up the green dragon.<P>"Jaia NO!" McDuffy shouts.<P>A strange green nimbus begins to form around Jaia.  Quickly I slap the figurine out of her hand and try to grab her.  I feel the dragon as I knock it to the ground.  My hand passed right through her.  With a soft pop of inrushing air she is gone.  I stare at the space that had so recently been occupied by my love.  Turning, I see McDuffy carefully wrapping the green dragon in cloth before stowing it back in his pouch.  Max looks on with eyes as big as saucers.<P>"I have called everyone to the Den," McDuffy says sharply, "we must organize a rescue party before anyone else gets drawn in."  He pauses, then finishes quietly, "even you, Kir."<P><BR>

Green fields.  Verdant green fields.  Looking around I don't recognize anything.  Surprised, I look again.  Nope.  Definitely a new area.<P>Scalpels body is practically at my feet.  Kneeling, I check for a pulse that I know is not there.  The body has been ripped asunder, but it is still warm.<P>"Gort!" I shout. "Can you hear me?"<P>"Hey der!" comes a winded response. Over the hills to the right I see movement.  Wishing for Kirico's song I begin an incantation that I keep memorized for those times that we are not hunting together.  I complete the cantrip and feel the pain as my bones go soft and rearrange their pattern.  The sensation of hair growing at a stupendous rate from every square inch of my skin is indescribable.  Soon it is done and I am running as a sister to the pack.  I whine as I pick up the odor of lizard.  It is nearly overpowering.  Underneath it is the familiar odor of halfling in a can.<P>Using the scent as a guide I follow it quickly across the hills.  Soon I see Gort, his short legs a blur as they try to keep up with his magical boots.  Tunare be praised that he had those boots for right behind him, almost literally snapping at his heels was a huge dragon.  His eyes glittering like the opals in the figurine.  Slowly, inexorably, the dragon was drawing nearer to the plucky priest.<P>Drawing upon the power that Tunare has bestowed upon me I called for the plants to reach up and hold fast the monstrous beast.  Alas, the powerful creature tore the roots as if they were but tissue paper.  Quickly, I tried an alternate spell.  Again, the plants reached out, but this time instead of trying to immobilize the great lizard they grasped and grabbed to merely slow it down and allow time for Gort to draw away from it.<P>"Get to Scalpel," I called to Gort.  "I will try to keep our friend entertained."  I saw Gort change direction and head toward Scalpel's body.  The dragon turned, seeking the source of the power that had allied itself with the priest.  Uh, oh.  Using the speed of the wolf I drew it away from Gort.  "Hurry, Gort!  I don't know how long I can keep him."

     "Lissssten to rootsss. Let water ssshape. Grow old. Ssstrong."<P>     These were the predominant thoghts, each a year in the making, in the mind of the elemental. It fell and rose in the crust of the earth like some sluggish raft in a sea of mud.<P>     Suddenly, its rudimentary mind was probed and commanded to obey. Reluctantly at first, but then with growing speed lent to it by the magic, it oozed to the surface, ready to do the bidding of its new master.<P>     "Yessss Masssster." It said slowly.<P>     "Protect the boy." The figure holding the radiating gem said. <P>     A mental picture of "the boy" flew into its mind and the elemental searched for its new master. He found him close at hand, and glided to his side. "Massster ssayss protect boy. One...two...massstersss......protecting." It sensed the dragon by that time, but as it was not yet harming the boy, it remaind protective.<P>     Then, as abruptly as he was summoned, the elemental felt the original magic that had compelled him to be brought to this plane stop. He was not sure what to do. It looked back to its summoner and saw him lying on the ground, the dragon close at hand.<P>     "Massster gone." It said, but then it turned back to the boy. "Mussst ssstay to protect new massster." It reasoned. <P>     It then felt another presence close at hand, and saw a small humanoid come toward the boy. Apprehensively, it moved closer. Then, pop! The boy was now gone!<P>     "One massster....two massssterss....no masssterss...one....two....too MANY!"<P>     White-hot rage began to fill its small brain, and it began to convulse. Sheets of rock began to crack and pop on its surface as its muscles bulged to incredible size. It doubled, then trebbled its bulk, and the dull slate eyes turned a malevolent firey-red.<P>     "Musssst kill!!!" It roared, and searched the area for foes.<P>     Just then, it saw the beautiful druid pop into the clearing and begin to deftly prepare her spells.<P>

Kirico had been correct those times he told me what a good combination a druid and a bard could be. Between my teleportation to the circle of commons and his drums we were arriving at the Emerald Tiger's Den so quickly that very few of our members had yet arrived. Fortunately, a few bleary eyed ones appeared to have been eithier drinking or sleeping here already. Others, like Nutryneaux, had heard the call and had the means to arrive swiftly.<P>A lot of questions are asked all at once. It appeared that most of them had heard the same calls as we did so they had some idea what was going on. Signaling for silence I shout. "Suffice it to say Kirico and I have found a way to where Gort, Scalpel, and now Jaia are." <P>Turning to Blixa I give her instructions. "Blix, get Max to a room upstairs and send someone you trust up to stay with him. Maybe call in a favor from one of those paladins that wander down from their guild to flirt with you all the time."<P>Seeing that we are in a hurry Blixa assigns this task to a young, and rather startled looking member of the Northern Paladins who had been watching our entire exchange with fascination over his mug of ale. I raise my bushy eyebrows as I see how quickly he snaps his attention to the task then turn my gaze back to Blixa questioningly.<P>She looks both a little embarrassed and impatient as she tells me, "Never mind that you nosey old halfling, stick to your business." I hear as well as feel that several more members have arrived during our exchange.<P>"Alright." I say, "All guildmembers gather round. Those of great and small skill alike. We have no idea what we face here but everyone will be useful. Pretend we are doing one mass group teleport." <P>I look in Blixa's eyes with an intensity I save for when I need for people to know I am in earnest. "Blixa. Take that Pike from over the mirror behind the bar. Stand as far from me as you can. I am going to be holding a small dragon statue. It will begin to move. Very soon after that I, and hopefully all those touching me, will fade from this place. As that happens Knock it from my hand with the pike."<P>A few questions arise but I wave them to silence. "Kirico and I have seen this done. Trust us." I turn again to Blixa, "Any who are left behind, in the chance that it will not take us all in one trip, or any who come after us, should repeat this procedure. You stay behind to direct this my friend. Leave the dragon fetish where it lies until the next group is ready to go. Once it is touched, the process begins."<P>I feel the hands reach out and touch me. Small ones, large strong ones, gentle<BR>ones, "wow" I think "that one must belong to Rockabilly or Palant". The fetish is in my hand. It turns to look at me. I feel it knocked from my grasp as.....<P>We arrive in pandemonium. It is soft green country but I hardly notice. In a glance I take in Gort, Jaia, a Dragon and a rogue Earth elemental<p><FONT COLOR="#3299CC" SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial">[Edited 1 time by Mcduffy on 21 April 2001 at 07:40]</font>

( Though my piss poor English and grammar, how can this story go without ME???Muhahahah Sorry to ruin this story with my comic ways  <IMG SRC="http://www.wrathofdragonclaw.org/NonCGI/biggrin.gif"> )<P>Meanwhile, back at the Emerald Tiger Den, a foul stench took over the smell of sweet ale. "WTF is that smell? " demanded Gomb. Suddenly the doors burst open with a bang.<P>A grumpy looking darkelf and never before seen maiden walked in. Trailing them, FAR behind them... was another darkelf. It was the source of the aweful smell. All eyes grazed on the grumpy one as the all silently grabbed hold of thier trustful sidearm. <P>The Grumpy one stared at the tenseful standoff and said " BAH!! ". Suddenly a white FLASH, blinding everyone in the room, and standing before everyone was a HUGE Barbarian. All gazed and sighed relief. It was Raichu. At the sight of Raichu, all knew that the other two that came in with them was Keeki and Tome ( /bonk everyone for not knowing that smell ).<P>It has been a long time since anyone from the guild seen these three. For the past 6 months, Raichu have been wandering the Planes of Hate while Keeki and Tome been tucked away in Skyfire.<P>"The POS Ranger finally arrives " declared Gomb. Raichu smiled. Raichu knew to be on best behavior, with Gomb here,the beautiful Amethyst must be near. <P>"Are we late? Where is McDuffy? " said Keeki. "They left right before Amethyst and I got here, and were told to head off towards them once we get a more to join our party" declared Gomb. As Tome opened his mouth to utter his first words, " We'll Join .." ,a voice near the fireplace behind Gomb said with a giggle " Before you JOIN, DUDE go wash up!!!!!" With that, Keeki led Tome to the back while Raichu sat next to his old friend Gomb.<P>When they returned, Gomb and Raichu got up, put away the maps and got up. Lets go! Mcduffy will need much help.<P><p><FONT COLOR="#3299CC" SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial">[Edited 1 time by Raichu Babai on 21 April 2001 at 13:04]</font>

<I>Much faster this way,</I> Nutryneaux, a Child of the Green, thought. Tired of having to enter the town by negotiating through the sewer systems like a common criminal, Nutryneaux took the direct route. <P>"Your foul deeds have earned my contempt!" The illreputed militia guard shouted as he spewed out further insults and called for more men. Fortunately the lackey's sword missed her as she ran by him at the gate. Nutryneaux took in a scoffing breath and smirked at him. It never ceased to amaze this elfess how one's reputation in cities traveled faster than a bard with battle drums!<P>Still blessed with an accelerated animal spirit in her stride, she ran deftly around the maze of walls into the northern part of city while the militia men fell behind. The northern guards, in league with the paladins of light, smiled warmly with respect to her when she arrived. The militia men never followed that far into the city but stayed in their corner of the dismal world of stone and mortar they had taken over. Nutryneaux mused as she ran through the streets towards the guildhall. If not under such a time constraint, she would have stood at the zone and shouted back to the militia guards on the other side just exactly what she thought them! <P><I>Foul deeds? I'll show you foul deeds!</I>, she thought with a wry smile, not sure what she would have shown them though. However, the Child of the Green had seen many humans using such taunts on one another and would know how to decipher the meaning even if she didn't.  <P>***<P>Nutryneaux finally arrived at the guildhall Den, and felt utterly relieved to have done so unscathed. Once inside, the perisistant tone of doom was palpable and she glanced around cautiously.  Kirico and McDuffy arrived shortly after, and the hall erupted into questions and concerns regarding the mage Scalpel and his son, the druidess Jaia, and the cleric Gort.<P>"Suffice it to say Kirico and I have found a way to where Gort, Scalpel, and now Jaia are." McDuffy shouted above the commotion and had Blixa escort a young lad, Scalpel's son, upstairs.<P>Nutryneaux regards the guild leader curiously, her mind in a flurry of thoughts as he quickly explained the dimensional door he intended to use to tranport willing guild members to where Scalpel, Jaia, and Gort had disappeared.<P>McDuffy looked about to the group as he held up a small dragon statue,  "Kirico and I have seen this done. Trust us." <P>A distortion like a vortex of transparent liquid swirled around the halfling's fingertips where he gripped the statue. Nutryneaux blinked as the flux of air began growing and encircled McDuffy, Kirico,  and the others in his direct vicinity. Like an arch made of gelatin, it appeard as shimmering cystalline gateway and the group shifted through it. The Child of the Green leapt to her feet and dove into the fluctuating air, her fingers clutched around someone's arm.<P>The emerald hued walls and the tiger carpeted den gave way to green country side in another place far away from the city. Taken aback and heightened to this strange new locale, Nutryneaux,  felt the need to review her list of incantations. Then she heard it, the distinct sounds of leathery wings moving through the air. Dragon!<P><B>BAM!</B> A rock hard fist hit her square in center of her back nearly knocking the breath out of her. Nutryneaux stumbled to her knees, as the second blow missed over her head. Wincing in pain she turned her gaze and saw a rogue earth elemental rearing back for another swing...<P><P>------------------<BR> <IMG SRC="http://members.aol.com/siihouette/nutry23.jpg">

"A plat short and a day late, the story of my life" Vandril said as he felt the movement of the guild. Being a wizard is different than most other magic using beings. Druids feel the way that Norath trembles when thier magic is used. Wizards feel the very essence of magic move. Great battles and massive spells feel like hammers ringing in his head. The benefit was, he knew where they went.<P>Quickly grabbing his spell book, he sat for a few seconds, memmorizing several of his teleport spells. "I may not be a bard or a druid, but I am quick enough". A moment later the world rushed around him and to those that watched, he simply disappeared. A soft pop was heard where the air rushed in to fill the void where he once stood.<P>The sounds of the dragon was the first thing to assualt his senses, the next was the rogue earth elemental as it threw itself at him. Fortunately it wasn't powerful enough to break through his shield instantly. Grinning as he cast he watched his magic surround the elemental's body and then turn into a thick wall. It always ammused him to paralyze a earth elemental.<P>The grin was quickly wiped away as the dragon's talons ripped through his weakened shield and blood came out his mouth. Crying outloud, shouting at the top of his lungs he unleased with the mightiest spell he knew. The dragon scream in pain momentarily as the massive sphere of ice and cold ripped into its body. <P>As the ice fell away from its body, Vandril turned to run, terrified. The damage was minimal, only patches of scales were missing and the dragon seemed only barely hurt, worse it seemed even angrier.<P>"well back to the old drill" he said to himself. "Hopefully people will live to rez me" Running as fast as he can trying to take the dragon away from his companions, giving them a chance to act unified.<P><BR>

Nutry flies across my vision as she is blind sided by the rogue elemental. Expecting a palnar battle I had memorized my strongest exile spell. A quick incantation and a large ammount of earth slides off the rockish body of the summoned creature. It turns its featureless form in my direction but is quickly distracted by a mighty blow from the sword of Raiachu.<P>I glance at the dragon and see that it has gained most of the groups attention. My healing power does not begin to rival that of Gort but it is enough to sustain Rai while he finishes off our earthen opponent. Those things hit hard once they go feral.<P>Once it has fallen my attention turns to our more serious opponent. To my relief someone has managed a successful snare on the dragon. Gomb is standing ready to go toe to toe with the beast. It will not be enough. Gort's complete healing will be needed there along with any of our spells that can get through its inate magic resistance. <P>It is still mass confusion. We have had no chance to group up. It has been arrive and fight. I cannot even tell who all is present. <P>Calling forth Wings of Death I send swarms of bees, flies, misquitoes and a few insects that must be unique to this pace to worry at the eyes and wounds of the great reptile beast. Kirico's tunes ring out. Not even being certain what they are doing, they always fill my heart with hope and raise my spirits. I just begin to think we have this under control, then my eyes go to the horizon and my heart sinks.<P>"If anyone gets a free moment try to contact Scalpel's spirit." I yell. "Get permission to move his corpse away from the battle. Then, as soon as possible, rez him and start him recouperating. We are going to need him."<BR><p><FONT COLOR="#3299CC" SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial">[Edited 1 time by Mcduffy on 22 April 2001 at 13:01]</font>

Running as fast as he can Vandril is running around in a wide circle, not to far from help but far enough the dragon won't worry about the others. Ignoring the fact that he is nearly dead, his lung punctured from that last lucky swipe the wizard runs on.<P>I feel the power, great healing magics being wrot on the field, not Gort but someone almost as good. Looking around trying to see what my friends are up to, I feel the touch of serenity... that brief moment when all is right and you are in complete balance with nature... and damn! its not hard to breathe anymore!. Scouring about my mismashed friends I see that Amethyste, bless her heart is here and she brought that troll too. Good, good.... time to make her earn her keep.<P>"She's all yours Gomb!!" Vandril shouts, twisting with agility that is uncommon in a wizard, he stops turns around and looks right at the Dragon. The dragon senses victory and closes in for the kill,Only to strike thin air. What was to be a quick kill before killing that druid that undid all his work, turned to be an even more infuriating defeat. Howling in anger the dragon whirls around to look for Amethyste, that wizard got away because of her, only to have the light obscured by millions of insects and vermin from Mcduffy's spell.<P>"Over here you overgrown Gecko!!, yeah you flower smelling iguana!" Vandril shouted from behind Gomb to the dragon. He had shadow stepped away from the dragon to disorient it, and to bring it to the one who was tough enough to go toe to toe with it. "It's not much my friend but it should add to Amethyste's magic" Vandril whispered to Gomb as he casted his next spell. The thorns that grew out of Gomb's skin now had a strange redish glow. If someone had the time to actually examine it, they would have seen that there were thousands of little fire elementals dancing on the barbs.<P>Rearing to the insults, the dragon looked for where they came from and saw Gomb standing in all her might, braced for the charge.  Trolls may not taste good but they keep well...<P><p><FONT COLOR="#3299CC" SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial">[Edited 1 time by Vandril on 22 April 2001 at 14:03]</font>

    Motrin awoke from his lazy nap to notice a flowing vortex of opaque liquid flowing to the top of the den, Motrin being the intelligently inclined barb thought it was just a unique dream. He awoke startled when he heard something fall to the floor, he put his head back down on his pillow to sleep again but his companion Gabeker brought the totem over and gently placed it in his lap. Motrin picked it up to inspect it but it began to contract and turned into a flowing vortex of green fluid. Motrin's feet left the ground but he bent down and picked up Gabeker. Motrin became unconcious while levitating to the altered plane. He was put down gently on his back but his companion came flying down and landed on him *THUMP*. <P>    Behind him Motrin could feel a presence of magik, he turned just in time to see the fist of a Earth Element named Jobober hurl straight towards him, he dodge it and began summoning the wrath of winter. Jobober started running and pieces of rock fell from his form as winter slammed into it; it turned in horror. Motrin ran up to it and started talking "What are you doing? I can sense the presence of Scalpel in your life force. I am one of Scalpels bretheren, will you help my brothers and sisters kill the Dragon that took your masters life?"<P>

"Busy place." I say.<BR>Looking around I see an immense amount of seeming confusion, but I know What they will all do. I move to make sure that I can see as many as possible. I will need to concentrate on each so I will know who needs my healing. I take a quick glance at Scalpels body, soon Scalp, soon.<BR>I notice the druids are Summoning their little allies, the fighters are engaging the monsters, others are arriving as I look around, Sorting out nicely.<P>Remebering the days when I could weild a weapon in combat or cast a damaging spell, I sit down. I will need all my magic for healing and can't indulge myself anymore. <BR>"oh well. To the work at hand.<P>Once again in my book. I can cast these they will be needed in any event.<P>Standing I cast first on Gomb, I feel my purse get lighter as Gomb is surrounded by a field of shimmering symbols, Next on Raichu, also for him I summon the power of heroes to infuse him.<BR>I sit back down and look hard at Gomb, not yet I say to myself. Bringing to bear my experience I watch. This much damage over this much time, allowing for the casting time plus a little cushion..... and people think this is easy. <BR>Standing once more. "Completly healing Gomb." I say. Now all know what I am doing. Gomb knows it's coming. Ame and the others that can heal will not waste their magic on Gomb unless it looks like I won't get done with my casting in time. Going through the motions and words that are so familiar to me, wishing it didn't take so long to cast. "I can cast 3 lesser heals in the same amount of time." I think to myself. <BR>Done.<BR>I sit as I watch Gombs health return, for the moment anyway. Quick check, Raichu ..Ok, so far. Jaia, Nutry, Ame, Vandril, Mcduff, the rest ok for now. back to Gomb, hurt but not yet.Check my pool of magic, Hmmm going to be close I think. Too close.

I yell in pain and hear similar curses and yelps around me. It was not breath, but some kind of area damage magic from the dragon. No noticable wounds, more like cramps and cracked joints. A group harm touch perhaps, but there is no time to consider that now.<P>The dragon is under the assult of both Gomb's and Rai's weapons along with whatever spells we manage to get through. He does not look near damaged enough for comfort yet. Unless more of us show soon I have grave concerns about our chances with this dragon let alone what I see approaching form what my direction sense tells me is the north.<P>At first they look like werewolves but as they close on us I see that they are more humaniod looking. They run like apes with their arms nearly dragging on the ground as if they are bent over as they lope forward. Whatever they are there are at least 10 of them and they are scowling at me, ready to attack. They appear to be a bit green to the ways of sohisticated combat but there are still quite a few of them and we have our hands full at it is.<P>"Train of .... Bentoveroids.... coming from the north." I shout as I turn to meet their charge.

Our battle with the dragon has taken us a fair distance south from the original combat locale. That leaves Scalpel's corpse just a little to the east of being directly between us and the charging Bentoveroid things. Kirico runs to meet their charge. Playing  highly discordant melody (actually making me glad I cannot hear it more clearly) on a horn I see the Bentoveroids react in pain as they clutch at their ears and howl. Several split off to try to chase Kirico down. Just as I am beginning to cast a spell to inhibit their charge some alter their course and head for the corpse of Scalpel.<P>Only a split second passes but much occurs to me. It is very unusual for creature types to show any interest in corpses and these hairy, naked, beings do not look to have the sentience of a gnoll. Scalpel is not of a class that feigns death well, and surly he would not have continued the ruse, even if he had the ability, once combat was joined.<P>I do not even take the time to consider. On the off chance that Scalpel has been unconscious instead of dead, I cast a blast of chlorophyl into his body. HE STIRS.<P>Casting with all the speed I am able I cause the ground between Scalpel and the rapidly advancing Bentoveroids to heave upwards. The front runners fall and squeal in agony as their feet and legs are ground together in the tulmut of rock and hard clay. The ones directly behind them try to stop but are pushed forward by their own momentum and the ones yet behind them. The ground continues to pulverize the ones who have already stumbled into the area and damages the new arrivals as well. <P>A third surge of earth signals the fading of my spell's effect but it has killed three of the front runners, seriously damaged two others the rest are hot on Kirico's trail. Scalpel is now standing and beginnign to cast a spell of his own.<P>The torrent of spells I have cast from the teleports, to the healing of Raichu, the insects I summoned upon the dragon, the healing of Scalpel, and the upheaval of earth have left me drained.<P>"OOMM!!!" I shout.<p><FONT COLOR="#3299CC" SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial">[Edited 1 time by Mcduffy on 25 April 2001 at 19:11]</font>

Swirling mist and then it clears.  My stomach gives a lurch then settles- wow that was a trip.  Not the usual sensation I have from teleporting.<P>I look around at the pandemonioum.  I recognize the wolf that is Jaia.  Thankfully, she is safe for the moment at least.  I see the dragon attacking Vandril and Gomb running over to take care of it.  Raichu is also moving in.<P>Gort is over by Scalpel's body, but is watching the combat.  I begin mixing my songs so that the maximum effect will cover my friends.  Fire and Cold resistance, Magic resistance, and damage shield all intertwine in the melodies that I sing.  I keep time with my drum and the magic that is imbued in it boosts the effects to a useful level.<P>"Completely healing Gomb," Gort announces as he stands and begins the slow ritual.<P>I grunt in pain as an incandescent shower of green sparks surrounds me and my compatriots.  The damage shield goes down and I feel my muscles cramp briefly.  That could have been much worse I think as I look to see if anyone has fallen.<P>"Train of .... Bentoveroids.... coming from the north." McDuffy shouts.  I turn and see a pack of the brutes heading for our little party.<P>"Jaia," I call out, "please fill me with the Spirit of the Wolf."  I sit down and get out my song book.  Several years ago I learned a little ditty that might help in this situation.  McDuffy looks at me strangely, but Jaia doesn't even blink.  Within moments I feel the strength come into my legs.  Having reminded myself of the tune I stand and switch to my horn.  <P>Running toward the incoming group I test out the composition.  It sounds a little harsh to me, but judging by the reaction of the bentoveroids it is having the proper effect.  They scream and cover their ears.  As a group they try to seek out the source of their pain.  All to soon they have a bead on me and run straight for me.  As they get closer I can see the blood streaming from their ears.  Everybody is a critic I laugh as I start to back up.  I run faster as they get closer- staying just out of their reach.<P>"I have these occupied for the moment," I call out.  "Vandril, when you get a chance- do you have Bonds of Force ready?"<P>Ouch! I pick up the speed a little as one of the critters reaches me with one of their long arms.  This is going to take awhile.<P>

Thank Tunare that reinforcements have arrived!  I glance over my shoulder to see how the dragon is doing.  Dodging swipes of its claws is not what I call a good time.  Cursing softly I see that it has noticed the new arrivals and has quit pursuing me.<P>I circle around back to the party as I take stock of the situation.  It is just like normal, I laugh to myself, everyone rushing around trying to do something and no one coordinating.<P>Vandril takes a claw to the chest- ooo, that has to hurt.  Quickly I cast my biggest healing cantrip.  Amethyst does the same and the expression on Vandril's face as he goes from mortally wounded to hardly scratched is a pleasure to behold.  <P>The dragon has turned to face Gomb.  Easily the most impressive fighter of the group assembled she challenges the monster with her two blades flashing.  Raichu moves in by her side and also lays into the beasty.  I hear Kirico's songs rythmically sounding through the area.  I have heard this combination before- ironically when we were going to challenge the Lady Vox deep in the caverns of permafrost.<P>"Completely healing Gomb," Gort says as he begins his incantation.  I turn my attention to the warriors knowing that until Gort has completed the lengthy ritual that they will be dependent upon my fellow druids and myself for any healing that is required.  I begin to cast my healing spell on Gomb, but before I finish I see that Gort's has completed and her wounds are fading.  I terminate the spell before I waste the results.<P>I stagger as the dragon rears up and we are encompassed in a shower of emerald drops.  The grass turns black in a wide area.  Taking stock, I feel a little sore, but not the major blasting that I expected.  I hear Kirico's songs again and smile.<P>"Train of .... Bentoveroids.... coming from the north." McDuffy shouts. What manner of bizarre creatures are these I wonder.  I take a quick glance and see the creatures with the long arms and ape-like gait.  I shudder as I turn back to the fight.  That is all we needed- more things to fight.<P>"Jaia, please fill me with the Spirit of the Wolf,"  Kirico sits down next to me as I begin the spell.  It used to surprise me that he would want to move like the wolf when with his songs he can move so much faster.  Then he explained that he could only sing so many songs and while he didn't like moving so slow it was still faster than most of our opponents.<P>I see Kirico take out his horn and run toward the onrushing monsters.  He puts the horn to his lips and out comes a horrible dischordant tune.  Reminiscent of claws on slate I am glad that it isn't aimed my direction.  I see the creatures scream in agony and clap their oversize hands to their ears.  Half of them turn to follow Kirico, but the other half are running straight towards Gort!  I am readying a spell when I hear McDuffy calling upon the earth itself to rise up and smite the group.<P>"Darling, can you come give me some help here?" I hear Kirico's voice in my head.<P>"On my way," I send him a quick return thought.<P>"I have to go give Kirico a hand with the bentoveroids.  I will be back as soon as I can.  Amethyste you and Nutryneaux are the only backup healers- McDuffy is meditating."<P>Quickly I run on my four paws over the hill where I saw Kirico heading last.  As I crest the hill I have to laugh.  He is leading them on a merry chase on the other side down by a large stream.  My laughter fades as I see one of the creatures reach out and rake his back ripping through his cloak and drawing furrows of blood through the chinks in armor beneath.  With a burst of speed he lengthens his lead.<P>I can tell that he is still in pretty good shape, but inevitably he will be forced to slow down as the loss of blood increases.  The creatures are not doing very well either, thank goodness, with blood flowing from their ears in copious amounts.  I scan the surrounding territory looking for ideas.<P>Upstream I see that the small river comes from between two steep banks- almost a small cliff.  I smile.  <P>I run over to the bank and quickly swim to the other side.  I position myself on the steep bank and take out my spell book.  McDuffy had the right idea, but this is a much better place.  I scan the spell and lock it into my memory.<P>"Run them upstream along the bank," I tell Kirico.  "Go fast and get some distance on them."  He doesn't reply, but I see him straighten out the circle he has been running in and head in the direction I desire.<P>I see him lengthening his lead and I begin the simple incantation.  As the wierd creatures run under the towering bank the magic takes effect.  The earth rips asunder and huge cracks open up beneath the bentoveroids feet.  With a look of panic they attempt to leap over them.  With a rumble the entire banks splits and comes down upon their heads.  <P>Anxiously, I wait for the dust to clear.  The effect had been more than I expected and I was afraid that Kirico might have been caught in the mini avalance of dirt and rock.  Suddenly he is at my side crooning the melody that helps my thoughts focus easier.<P>"We better head back to the other fight and see what is going on," he says as if nothing has happened.  The melody changes and I feel the cuts and scratches closing, healing from his song.<P>"I hope they are still alive."  I say.  We hurry across the water and over the hill.<P>

     I glide acroos the cool stone path faster even than when I have been blessed with the Spirit of the Wolf from my druid brothers and sisters. Mists swirl about my legs and the sky is gray and overcast. Although the scenery seems muted and drained of color, it is a comforting, restful place - very restful.<P>     I approach a low stone wall with mistly shapes verily swimming in the ether on the other side. Several seem to notice my approach and come towards me, beckoning for me to cross the wall and to take my place with them. The urge is near irresistable.<P>     I waiver, thinking of my dearest friends, brothers and sisters all, pitched in a dreadful battle, to which I have brought them. I resist the call of the mists - but it is not enough. Slowly I move to the wall.<P>     Suddenly I hear the voice of Mcduffy, chanting softly. He speaks of fresh earth, rainfall, warm sun, new buds on trees, and flowers coming to life. He speaks of snowy winter nights with your toes next to a warm hearth, the taste of a mug full of hot spiced cider, tall tales shared among friends and laughter. He speaks of true friendship and love. He reminds me of the joy I have in my son. <P>     That one is enough!<P>     Slowly, I open my eyes and try to sit up. PAIN! <P>     The wounds on my back and on my chest are all ready clotted and begining to heal. I touch my head and wince; That one may leave a scar I muse. I then scan the sceen.<P>     A lump forms in my throat as I see how many of my sisters and brothers have come to my aid. I have come to question many decisions in my life but never this one - I have choosen guilds well indeed! I almost forget what is going on as I watch the heroics of stout Gomb, going toe-to-toe with the great dragon and the play of scintillating magics in the air around the battle. Brave Gort, bruised and bloody, is by my side. Looking puzzled, he rises to his feat to cast healing magic my way.<P>      Perhaps it is the song of Kirico that fills my heart with hope, but strength seems to be returning to my body as I rise. "Save it for those who need it my friend. I have full mana, and that's all I need." I have been pulled from the brink once today and if it is my lot to return, so be it!<P>     I take in a fresh breath of air. It is a good day to die!<P>     I look to the rest of the battle, and would have doubled over in laughter, would my body have allowed it. That old campaigner Motrin is sitting astride what seems to be left of my earth elemental giving it a stern lecture! How odd though, although the elemental seems almost destroyed, it is huge! I send my thoughts to it and reestablish my control.<P>     "Massster!" It says. Although this is directed to me, I notice with some amuzement it is still gazing Motrin's way.<P>     " I am healing you." I think to it. "Will you obey in this fight?"<P>     "Yessss my Massster." It complies.<P>     "Agronomus, Aidi ton filis" I shout, and, considering our situation, add, "Berserkus liberatus!" I briefly wonder if I have the power to control such a being, but quickly banish those doubts, and flash a mental image of myself as powerful and confident to the elemental. It rises from the ground and glides toward the dragon. "Is Motrin going to ride that thing like a horse into battle I wonder?"<P>     Looking elsewhere, I notice Kirico's beloved, Jaia, is in battle with several ape-shapped creatures. "Where in all the nine hells did these come from?" I muse. Knowing that these creatures could pitch the battle, disrupting casters from their important task at hand, I send a message to my son, and find, with great relief that he is safe in the Den.<P>     "Son, if there if there are any fighters with you, they are needed here in the battle. Have them come quickly, but you stay there!"<P>     I then turn my attention back to the battle at hand and blanch...the dragon has reared back and is taking in a great gulp of air!<P>     <p><FONT COLOR="#3299CC" SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial">[Edited 1 time by Scalpel Spelsmith on 26 April 2001 at 17:55]</font>

Nutryneaux rose from her knees and took a narrowed glance at the elemental who had socked her. It was aimless and mistook her for an enemy, as summoned creatures do when they have lost their masters. However, many incoming guildmates handled the poor hapless creature subduing it for the time being. <I>Was that Motrin straddling it? </I>she curiously mused to herself.<P>Wiping the dirt and grass from her hands and leathers, she readied her thoughts for the battles that quickly ensued. A swing of leathery wings followed by trunk sized talons which rumbled the horizon as Raichu and Gomb began deflecting it. Nutryneaux's eyes widened, having never faced dragons this close before. Her mind began reeling, <I>What should I do?</I> <P>Her  first thoughts coalesced, and she quickly turned her focus onto Raichu and then on Gomb as sprigs of pithy barbed vines jutted from their bodies like amour made of thorny protection. She tried to rise vines from the earth beneath the dragon's talons, to stop it or slow it, but her efforts were lost in futilty as the dragon was just too strong.<P>Nutryneaux blinked hard, as Jaia's words broke through the commotion, "I have to go give Kirico a hand with the bentoveroids. I will be back as soon as I can. Amethyste you and Nutryneaux are the only backup healers- McDuffy is meditating."<P>Swallowing hard, and shoring up her reserves Nutryneaux shouted, "I am ready!" From her pack she flipped the Mace of Tunare into her delicate pale hand, and in the foreign landscape it shown like a sunlight dancing through an emerald shaft, filling her thoughts with the added strength and mana she needed for what was to come.<BR><P>------------------<BR> <IMG SRC="http://members.aol.com/siihouette/nutry23.jpg">

"Train of .... Bentoveroids.... coming from the north."  Mcduffy shouts. Great.. just great I think to myself. Time to shine.  Sitting quickly down I open my book to the back, usually not a good sign because that is where my fiercest spells are. Well i have spells that do more damage outright, these are spells of mass destruction.<P>Standing I look at Amethyste and before I can even utter the words I feel the spirit of the wolf strength my legs. "thanks" I say grinning. I love having good friends.<P>Kirico's call to me "Vandril, when you get a chance- do you have Bonds of Force ready?" breaks my momentary lapse. Laughing I call out "That's like asking if Jaia is with you!!" as I run to chase him. Looking for the angle I run to cut him off and as he brings those things closer to me, I begin my chant.<P>I open my eyes and see Kirico outdistancing them nicely now. The spectral shackles binding the Bentoveroids, slowing their charge enough that they realize they can't catch the guard and that I was the cause of this.<P>Just like giants I think. Barely speaking I begin my next spell, I have the time before they get to me. The thunderclap that ensued was louder than the Dragon, and the Bendoveroids looked stunned. Their flesh had been ripped apart by the sheer volume of the thunderclap but they were still standing. "so you want more eh?" They are going to start calling me a druid with all this thunder and lightning soon I think to myself as I start the next chant.  The rest of the Bentoveroids fall in the lightning storm that hit. They were just recovering from the shock of my last spell. "Bentoveroids are Burtoveroids now"<P>I look back at the main fight, the Dragon doesn't look please that her minions have become one with the soil, but she has Raichu and Gomb to deal with.  I know it will only be a matter of time before she takes offense to Gort and his healing abilities. Time to distract the dragon again.<P>

It is a warm summer day as I lay about the warm fields of Commons.  I merrily help the younger adventures with the nasty creatures that they do battle with. Hardening of skin here, increase in health regeneration there, all to pass the time. As I just get done helping a young monk with a puma, I get a mental summons by my older brother Mcduffy asking for help.  Great I think to myself, whats he gotten himself into now.<P>I imbue myself with the speed of a wolf and race off to the Tigers Den. As I approach the gates of West Freeport I see Sir Lucan standing there, berating his men. Oh if there was more time, I would have some fun but alas duty calls. <P>He happens to see me as I race by and starts to bark orders to his men to have them stop me.  Not now Lucan, but maybe later,  as I race for North Freeport.<P>I enter the Tigers Den and see Blixa standing there. Knowing my brother, he would entrust her with any crucial information as to his where abouts.  Hey Blixa, where is the old coot? I ask.<P>She tosses me a Dragon totem and says, Use this to get with him, others are already there. Scalpel seems to be in trouble.<P>I can sense the fear in her voice.  Oh joy, I think to myself, another merry time to be had by me.<P>I focus on my brother with the totem in hand and I feel myself start to get light headed as I am being transported to another plane.  Just before I am fully immersed in the fog, I release the totem and let it fall to the ground in the Tigers Den. <P>When I come back from the haziness, I am standing in a grassland that stretches as far as the eye can see.  I am slowed by the teleport, the fog slowly leaving my mind. I look around see my friends from the Alliance of the Griffin.  They seem to be fighting a big green thing. My vision is still blurry but is focusing fast.<P>A DRAGON!!!!!!<P>Well thats just great. Of all the things that I need to be dealing with right now. <P>I look around to take an assesment of the area and situation. Gomb and Raichu are fighting the Dragon. Gort, Amethyste, Nutryneaux, and Mcduffy (old coot) seem to be backing them up with Vandril, Kirico, and Jaia laying waste to god knows what the hell those things are.  I spy Scalpel and Motrin playing with an earth elemental, is Motrin trying to ride that thing?<P>Well it looks like its time to make my presence felt.<P>I open my spell book and start to memorized some spells that will make this dragon think twice before messing with my friends again.<P>I stand up and target the Dragon just as I see it start a huge intake of breath.  I call upon my god Karana to grant me the spells and power to help us in the battle that we now face. <P>I call upon the wind to momentarily stun the beast, NO DRAGON BREATH FOR YOU! With it stunned, it no longer is able to breath on us.<P>Not wanting to waste time, I mutter some arcane symbols and encase the Dragon in ice. Watching its skin crack, I immediately begin casting again.  Now its skin begins to melt as fire rages around it, as it screams in pain, I make a hasty retreat knowing full well that it will now want to try and find out who was causing it so much pain.<P>WELL HELLO THERE YOU UGLY, GREEN, OVERGROWN IGAUNA, COME AND GET SOME!<P>That should let everyone know that I am here I think to myself. If you want to make an entrance, might as well do it in style.<BR>

Finally getting some sleep after days of waiting for Hadden to come give me my earring back.  I'm awoken by a shoven from Blixa.  "Scalpel needs help, use this to get there", she says. <P>"Oh, TUNARE!  Am I ever going to get some damn sleep.", I grumble as I roll out of the down bed.  I rub the sleep out of my eyes and think to myself..."Sleeping on the ground is all fine and good, but I'll still take a down matress any day."  <P>I slowly Picture in my head the image given to me from the stone figurine.  Gathering the forces of nature in my surrounding area, I release them in a quick pop.  I'm near instantly transported halfway across the world.  Having arrived, take quick stock of my surroundings and begin a small spell that will allow me to fly, then a spell that will speed my journey.  I head out towards the sounds of battle. <P>"A very tired and worn out Comblast reporting in" I shout out.  I sit down for a few moments trying to gather more energy.  I see the Dragon off in the distance.  I feel bad  that there is really nothing I can do at the moment.  Until I have some energy built up I would just be dragon fodder.

Braganz haad been concentrating fiercely on his lock picking skill in the East parts of Freeport when he received the call. It must have been several call before it finally got through, because the Den was empty when he finally did arrive.<P>Appearing in a strange land, he immediately hid himself from view and took stock of the situation. Scalpel was on his feet again, and the dragin still looked as though it hadn't been harmed all that much. The extra creatures seemed to be well in hand with Kirico, Jaia and Vandril, so Braganz did his best to sneak behind the behemoth of a lizard.<P>Carefully avoiding swishing tail as he approached the dragonf rom behind, Braganz selected his biggest pointiest weapon from his arsenal and took careful aim at the back of the dragon, just above the tail, hoping for a good hit. The hit was good! And it seemed Raichu and Gomb had been doing a very good job of taunting the dragon, as it barely even flinched at the attack from behind.<P>With that in mind, Braganz didn't waste time evading the combat at all, and simply started swinging until he could find another good oppurtunity to place his Chokodai Prod in the back of the dragon again. Of course he was very noticable behind the dragon, agily (though barely in some instances) avoiding the tale of the dragon still, and he felt his speed increase as Motrin imbued him increased speed and strength.<P>The smile on Braganz's face could be seem easily to all who cared to look at him. It had been some time since he had seen any combat action, and he was enjoying it immensely. He vowed to spend less time in town now that he'd had a chance to work on some of him more "socially unacceptable" skills.

Not a breath, but a roar, at least its no damage this time. <BR>I think to myself, some of the less experienced ones will be running, but its been awhile since Gomb or Rai have run from dragon fear.<BR>Starting to shape up, but warrior light as always.<BR>"Hurry up and get done with the yard trash," I shout. "Going to need everyone on the Dragon."<BR>Looks like we are doing some damage to it, but these things are never quick.<BR>Its, on the edge, Vox or Nagggy type, going to have to go, Burning Woods, or even Skyfire, we should be able to do this.<BR>

Mala...resist...mala...resist...mala...RESIST!<P>Scalpel was running out of options and his friends were getting hurt! He had all ready tried the old faithful; Shock of Swords, and when it had done nothing more than jar a scale loose, he knew the beast had a great deal of magic resistance. The rogue elemental was at least doing some damage, but it still was not enough. He could only hope that he might be able to lower the dragon's magic resistance to help the other casters before he died, but time was running out, and so was his mana.<P>"OOM!" Shouted Mcduffy, and Scalpel verily cringed. Well, Scalpel thought, might as well go out in a blaze of glory.<P>Scalpel thumbed through his worn tome with practiced fingers, back to the pages he almost never used...Ah! Here it is - Scinitllation, this may give him some heartburn anyway!<P>Scalpel began to ready the spell, but stopped abruptly when he saw the now familiar green vortex begin to form nearby. To his dismay, no mighty warrior stepped through the arch, but only a small boy. "Son! What are you doing here..go back!"<P>Scalpel saw his son run to him. Max had never disobyed him before, in fact, Scalpel had sometimes wished he would if only to see a change in him, but this was not the time!<P>Max came to his father. He gazed into Scalpel's eyes, then briefly touched his hand.<P>"Son, no! You have no idea..." But then Scalpel stopped short...Max had dropped his hand and was casting! <P>Small purple rings began to spread out from Max and head to the dragon. The rings pulsed with energy as they encircled it, then gave a loud "Pop!" and disappeared. <P>Scalpel gaped in astonishment. "Ummm...dragon Malaed!" he shouted. He then looked in wonderment to his son, who was all ready casting again.<P>Corruscating blue sparks began to emmanate from his son. The magic covered the small boy from head to toe, seeming to draw force from him. Then, with another pop, they flew from him and fell on a shower to the party. Scalpel felt the mana in him renewed...fully!<P>Scalpel turned his attention back to the fight, and saw Mcduffy look to him, puzzled.<P>"Hit it hard now!" Scalpel yelled. His jubilation would have been short-lived, however, if he would have looked to see his son, paler than ever, collapse to the ground.<P><p><FONT COLOR="#3299CC" SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial">[Edited 1 time by Scalpel Spelsmith on 26 May 2001 at 10:51]</font>

"Dragon Malaed" I hear Scalpel shout.  That is good news. It will be so much easier to get spells through now.  Jaia and I come over the rise after taking out the remaining overoids and survey the scene.<P>Gomb and Raichu are hacking away from the front.  I spy Braganz burying his weapon into the back.  Gort is meditating out of reach- standing occasionally to heal the tired fighters.  Omcduffy has joined the fray, calling upon Nature's fury to help strike down the beast.  Amethyste is trying another snare as the one by Jaia fades into memory.<P>Scalpel is casting... no wait, that isn't Scalpel casting.  It is Max.  What in the name of all that is holy is Max doing here?  I see a shower of blue sparks spread from Max in a familiar pattern.  Jaia stiffens.<P>"Full mana," she reports.  I see Scalpel swing into action summoning god knows what horrific effect to aid in the battle.  Max crumples and falls.<P>"You help with the fight," I tell Jaia, "I'll take care of the kid."  She nods, attention already focused on the fighters to see if any spot healing is needed.<P>Quickly, I run to Max and pick him up.  He is very pale and hardly breathing.  Quickly I start the Hymn of Restoration to aid his healing.  A little Jig of Vigor mixed in also seems to help.  Reflecting on the blue sparks that I had seen coming from him I add that song prized by all casters-  the chorus of clarity that sharpens minds and enables the mystic forces to flow without the natural resistance of man.  Repeatedly, I sing these to him as I try to pull him back from the brink of the abyss.  Craddling him in my arms I carefully move him off to one side- out of the direct line of any dragon breath.<P>I look up to see how the fight is going...<p><FONT COLOR="#3299CC" SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial">[Edited 1 time by Kirico on 27 May 2001 at 01:21]</font>

She<BR>could only remember snatches of it now... a wild light, a clutter <BR>of voices in her head, and her father's voice above all.<BR>She searched for his voice now, but Mcduffy was somehow out of her <BR>reach.  Shilok did not wonder at this for long, as her thoughts were <BR>interrupted by a door opening and small feet scuttling across the floor <BR>to her bed.  In the candlelight of her room at the Emerald Tiger's Den, she<BR>could barely make out the figure of Max.<BR>She sighed easily.  The little boy always made her feel somehow peaceful,<BR>and his quiet was often a welcome change from the boisterous older<BR>members of the guild.<BR>Max himself did not seem peaceful now, though.  He remained silent, but <BR>Shilok could tell there was something urgent at hand.  Quietly, without<BR>question, she slipped off her bed to stand in front of the boy.<BR>"Tell me what to do," she whispered, for she would obey any command.<BR>She knew something of the boy's secret... enough to know that she would<BR>follow his lead even if it meant defying his father Scalpel and her own<BR>father, Mcduffy.<BR>Max softly took her hand in his and led her to a balcony overlooking the<BR>tiger-carpeted den.  Slowly, he pointed at the barmaid, Blixa.  As he did,<BR> Shilok noticed something small in his hand glinting in the light.<BR>She understood.  She was to distract Blixa, possibly even keep her from<BR>sending word to the others.  They were in danger, wherever they were, and<BR>only Max could help them.  Shilok alone understood this, and she nodded<BR>gravely to the little boy, now frail and small in the light of the great<BR>hall.<BR>"Go," she whispered.  "I will cover for you as long as I can."<BR>And with that, Max stepped back into the shadow of her room and with a <BR>blinding flash and a quiet *pop* he was gone.<BR>Shilok prayed for the safety of the guild, whatever great battle they<BR>might be in.<BR>But now she turned her sights on Blixa and the few others gathered in the hall.<BR>She hoped she could distract them long enough for Max to return safely.

While the bentoveroids were an easy mark, they still drined Vandril's most precious resource, his mana. Thinking he still had some left in him, Vandril began his short lived but massive unslaught of fiery destruction. Five and then a sixth torrent of fire engulfed the dragon.<P>Unlike most casters Wizards imbue each of thier spells to rend through a creatures magic resistance, must like an arrow finds the soft spot in a suit of armor. It works better when the dragon has been tash'd or malao'd but at least he could hurt it. Not enough though seeing that the flames had only barely damaged the critter.<P>As Vandril appraised the damage, the tell tale pulple rings with the splash of green encircled the dragon. A grin broke his face and just as quickly disappeared.  Finally mala went through, but no mater, by the time I am ready for another assualt, Gomb and Raichuy will be dead.<P>Blue filled Vandril's vision. Magic was exploding all around him, engulfing his being for what seemed like hours, but was only a few short seconds. The need to rest was gone. "Wow, did you learn a new chant Kirico?!?!" Vandril shouted.<P>Renewed and regenerated, Vandril was ready to begin anew when the dragon reared back. Even in midspell Vandril knew this would not be good, dragon breath is ugly, destroying even the mightiest fellows in a single blast. Good thing troll flesh just doesn't do anything but sag. The deafening roar that echoed through out the land, was enough to break Vandril's concnetration on the spell. <P>Must leave, must run, must..... No I will not run.. Dragon Fear, in my past battles I ran like orcs run from me now, but experience has taught me. With eyes still closed, I pray for a split second that I am not the only one who resisted.<P>For the dragon breath is surely next.<BR>

Heavy concentration. I meditate while trying to see if Rai or Gomb look so wounded that they need an emergency heal from me. I tear a tiny piece of my thoughts away to check my mana.<BR>Holy Karana!!! How did I lose track of time? If feel full mana coursing through my being.<BR>No time to wonder now.<BR>It breathes... no roars.... Dragon Fear!!! That might have scared me away at one time but not anymore.<BR>What spells are on it? I see there are swarms of insects on it already. Spikes still protrude from the tanks' skin. To hell with it. No time to analyse either. <BR>WHEN IN DOUBT>>> NUKE!!!!<BR>I breathe with the lungs of my diety and watch the debris, ranging from dust to small rocks to bentoveroid parts gather in a whirl of force and blast into the dragon's hide. <BR>The beast actually cries out and it's side buckles in a bit. Wow full effect. Someone must have gotten a malase through.<BR>Good! "KREEGAAAAA" I cry. "SLIT YOUR OWN THROAT AND SAVE US THE TROUBLE".<BR>"Nukes always stack". Then I take in another heavy breath as I call to Karana to help me with yet another blast.<BR>

RAURRRAAGHH!!!<P>The dragon roared out in pain and frustration; What had began as a game of cat and mouse had quickly turned into a fight for its survival - How it longed to make these foolish mortals pay with their pathetic lives! Now was not the time however. It was hurt, and these pathetic creatures were swarming around it like the insects that worried at its eyes. <P>It paused in battle for a moment, scanning the area, and taking particular note of the combatants, eeriely regarding each one, then it's outline began to shimmer as it was surrounded by thousands of opaque oscillating bubbles. Pop! It was gone!<P>

Comblast is suddenly woken up by a loud pop and he realizes that he fell asleep while waiting for his mana to return.  He hears a lot of shouts that he can barely make out... Stuff like: "Oh shit.. Gated" and "Where the hell did he go?"... Comblast then realizes he is totally refreshed and ready for battle.  He takes a quick look in his mind.. Feeling for the creatures aura's so that he can see if the dragon is still somewhat close by.  Not sensing the dragon, he goes and joins the others.

Great just great, i have the perfect spell for this situation but no, I didn't bother to learn it. Well sometimes its best to look out for one's own survival. <P>Quickly memorizing abscond and several other small teleports, Vandril stands up and pours his mana into it. With a soft pop, he vanishes.<P>Reappearing at what is spposed to be the safest spot nearby, I laugh once again at how usless that spell is. Not more than 10 feet from me is that dragon, working its own magic, which with no doubt will summon each one of us individually for it to slaughter at our leisure. <P>Well I am never one to die with mana at my disposal. Crying at the top of my lungs hoping that I will be heard in true wizard fashion, I scream. And launch into magic that will hopefully interupt its first round of summons.

For the first time in many years the dragon was at a loss for what to do.<P>It's bind spot was only about 1000 yards from where the fight had begun, but it was far enough away that it knew it could get several heals off then summon the party there individualy to kill them. Now this impudent mortal arrives, screaming its fool head off! What to do...kill him or heal...<P>In the end, pride overwhelmed the dragon. It would kill this foolish one for daring to face it! Yes, his bones crunching beneath its mighty talons would indeed be satisfying!<P>The dragon turned to the wizard and launched a viscious series of claw and bite attacks...this one's pain would become legendary!
