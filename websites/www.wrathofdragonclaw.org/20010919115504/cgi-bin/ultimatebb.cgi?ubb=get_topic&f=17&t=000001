The cold winter air whirled its icy fingers against the small window pane of a local tavern. Rounds of ales and the late hour had the crowded inn swirling with merriment, and to further lighten the mood, a bardic competition ensued. A gifted bardess known as Anbrolyn stood up to announce that she and her daughter-in-law would successfully improvise a ballad based on any subject and about any one the crowd could randomly come up with. She then proceeded to wager that they could finish the ballad without missing a beat and would be taking bets.<P>Nutryneaux, druidess of the Green and child of the fae, groaned inwardly and glanced around the crowd nervously.  She shifted her gaze back to her mother-in-law and regarded her with a silent sigh. Nutryneaux was verbose and creatively articulate when the spirit moved her, however she was no bard, not like the genius of the beloved Anbrolyn.<P>A motley Paladin stood up, and with a narrowed gaze spoke crisply, "I will pay you 20kpp if you can finish a ballad about me." Waggling a flirting brow at the charismatic and ever-youthful Anbrolyn, he set a bag of coins down with *clunk* between the two elfesses. Anbrolyn's smile was brilliant and never revealed the ire this one Paladin instilled in the minds of many.<P>The bardess picked up her harp and settled the ancient instrument on her lap. Strumming a few chords, she picked a simple key and began an intricate prelude and bespoke the title: "The Ballad of Sir Reginold."  With deft fingers she entered a cadence and began singing a verse, alternating verses back and forth with Nutryneaux the song went as thus:<P><BR>--In grand nights of hence when Knights were bold<BR>--There once was errant Sir Reginold <P>--This knight was awful his skill was waning<BR>--His aches and pains was he complaining<P>--Many a war did he ignore no foes to damage faces<BR>--There was no threat he could not beat by less than thirty paces.<P>--Across the river & down the lane there skipped a fair young maiden<BR>--Radiant sunshine was her hair with eyes like sparkling ~umm~ jaden?<P>--From under a bridge jumped forth a beast with hunger long to slake<BR>--The lass did flee, and shriekéd forth, "Not I, a troll's dinner make!"<P>--Her cries did reach the Errant's ear echoing through the fold<BR>--Leaping astride his spirited steed, was none other than Sir Reginold<P>--His boot caught the reins and yanked the bit, the horse did rear and buck<BR>--Hurtling him thither upon the troll. ~"Darn, that knight's weird luck!"~<BR> <BR>--The beast was smashed, through chance was slain<BR>--The Knight was honored the deed proclaimed.<BR>	<BR>--But telling tales in days of old, left out the hurling forth of Reginold.<P>The inn errupted in roaring laughter and more rounds of ale. The paladin? Well, he disappeared saying he was late for a quest.<BR>_____________________________________________________________________<P><center><img src="http://members.aol.com/siihouette/nutryneaux3.jpg" alt="Nutryneaux © 2000"></center>

PART II<P>Reginold Fennandwer could hear the tavern's resonating laughter from outside as he mounted his horse. "Walk on Dulcette," he muttered through clenched teeth and the war-horse obeyed him with a precise steady gate. He looked back at the tavern windows with a fixed emotionless glare, scoffed under his breath, then turned toward the road.<P>The sound of Dulcette's steps through the frozen ground made remarkably light *crunching.* Reginold commented to himself with admiration, that she was such a massive mare yet could make delicate deft steps. In a gesture of fondness that surprised even himself, he reached a gloved hand out and patted her thick neck.  Dulcette had been the finest horse he had ever seen and it was his fortune and *favor of the gods* that he had obtained her. "A knight's faithful companion," he mused, "was a good war-horse." Reginold nodded in the silence as his thoughts coalesced. A companion who was faithful and steady and...<P>An unbidden memory flowed through the young knight's thoughts like melting snow. A woman of golden hair and skin who danced with boundless grace and sang with a voice as silvery as a flute consumed his mind. She was a noble elfess with magnificent gifts and bountiful physical attributes, truly a treasure beyond his reckoning. Seeing Anbrolyn again this evening rearoused all of his dormant musings. <P>He recalled the first time he had seen her, he was younger then,  and was enrolled in the academy of the Knights of Arundel. A traveling band of minstrels had come to Antonica and settled into the city. They performed nightly at various taverns from one end of the city to the other. When they reached the northern part of the city, they played at the Emerald Dog, the paladin's local tavern. Elves were rare in a human city, but there she was the golden haired elfess playing her harp and singing. Anbrolyn's long graceful fingers glided over the taut strings with the expertise of an intimate lover's caress. Reginold fell into the lush tones of her voice, lost in the spell of her song, and instantly loved her.<P> * * * <BR>Reginold's father had been a founding member of the Knights of Arundel and his family a lengthy lineage of "begets" with a list of notable noble men and women as long as a courtyard.  He had been expected to be the crowning glory of knighthood for his family and all his young life he assumed nothing different...and let everyone know it.<P>Unaware to Reginold, the paladins of Arundel but especially the counsel, had a completely different attitude towards him. Plain and simply, they thought he was a screw-up with the pompousness of an Erudite guardsman. The only reason they tolerated Reginold was the yearly income from his family's estate which kept the academy strong and healthy during the lean years and/or during wars. The counsel had secret meetings concerning Reginold and it was their intention to send him away from the guild on as many far off quests as they could. Any quest they could find or create, Reginold was sent out, away from the prying ears of the city.  It was the counsel's sincerest hope that Reginold would eventually give up his notions of knighthood *voluntarily* and that their reputation would not suffer from any further embarrassment of his *incidences*.<P>To Reginold, he seemed to be out more often than inside the academy. He figured he must surely be on his way to knighthood with all the benevolent work he had been doing at out-of-the-way towns. Returning home from a small farming community in the Karanas, he noted in the distance a small house near a river and heard the distinct cries from a woman. Moments later she emerged in his view and was being chased by a large troll. Immediately, Reginold spurred his gelding toward them.<P>_____________________________________________<BR><center>(To be continued)<P>By Nutryneaux </center><P><BR>
