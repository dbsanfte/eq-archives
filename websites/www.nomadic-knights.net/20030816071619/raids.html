<b><big>Raids</big></b>
<P>

Raids will be set up for the purpose of an opportunity to group with other guild members and obtain experience and items that a single group may not be able to obtain by themselves. We use the raid system from Planes of Power for our raids.
<P>
A few basic raid rules are in place to ensure the safety and enjoyment of everyone.
<P>
<ul>
<li>There will be one Raid Leader assigned to each raid. He/she may ask others to assist, but this is at their discretion. All instruction should be taken from the raid leader or any person he/she has asked to assist in running the raid.
<li>
<b>All raids will have a minimum level requirement.</b> If you do not meet the requirement you will not be assigned to a group in the raid.
<LI>
The starting time, meeting place and length of the raid will be stated in the Raid announcement. Raid attendees/guild members will not be required to escort you in or out of the zone if you will be late or need to leave early. 
<li>
If you have a balanced group which you typically worked with, please let the raid leader know in advance and that person will try to place you together unless you are needed to fill another group.
<li>
Raids are not a time to explore new zones or wander off.  Stay with your group unless instructed otherwise.  Your stroll down a different path could cause the entire raid to wipe.
<li><b>BE ON TIME!</b>  We can not stress this enough.  
</ul>
<P>
<b>To ensure that raids run smoothly, everyone attending the raid will be expected to do the following:</b>
<P>
<b>Before the Raid - Raid Preparation</b>
<ul> 
<li>Try to have a map in hand of the area being raided.  If you are not familiar with the zone, then be sure you do NOT go AFK at any time.  Stick with your group leader.
<li><b>Arrive at least 30 minutes before the planned start time of the raid.</b> It will take at least 30 minutes and maybe more to set up groups and coordinate hunting locations.  If you are late, it is possible that you will not be allowed to go on the raid. 
<li>When you arrive at the grouping location, immediately disband your self from any group that you were part of. Put up the Looking For Group tag by typing: /LFG ON and be sure to take /role mode off so that the raid leader can see your class and level.
<li>Once assigned to a group, move to your group leader's location, remove the LFG tag, sit down and minimize chat until all instructions are stated. 
<li>Prepare all of your hotkeys. For most characters, this will consist of a "/assist Main_Assist_Name" key.
</ul> 
<P>

<b>During the Raid</b>
<P>
<ul> 
<li> The raid Leader will use a specified chat channel to communicate to everyone. This will include requests for status from group leaders as well as coordinating the looting of no-drop items. 
<li>Do not wander away from the group.  Stick together or you may aggro additional monsters. Raids are not the time to explore a zone on your own. 
<li>Only the group leaders should be communicating with the raid leader or raid assistants unless there is an emergency. If you need to inform the raid leader of some information try to do so via the group leader.
<li><b>LISTEN!</b> DO NOT attack a monster until you hear an assist call, unless told to do otherwise by the raid leader.
<LI>Keep chat to a minimum and on the channel specified for it.  If we are distracted, we will wipe.  It is important to be paying attention to the raid leaders and their instructions.
</ul>
<P>
<b><big>Loot Rules</big></b>
<P>
The class of loot WILL be determined prior to the raid.  On raids, there will be a master looter (ML).  Cash and gems from the raid will be put into the guild bank to cover raid expenses, such as coffins, peridots for cleric buffs, and the like.
<ul>
<li><b>God loot</b> These are items from raid level mobs that would be an upgrade for a large portion of the people who can equip that item.  Each guild member that is interested in said item is to send a tell to the raid leader who then decides (along with class leaders and officers) where said item will go. The item is then awarded. Such items tend to be no-drop.


<li><b>Tier 2</b> This is where the item is good, but not great. Then the loot officer will usually /random between the people who want the item. These items may be no-drop but that is not necessarily the case.
<li>
<b>Tier 3</b> This is common stuff that isn't really an upgrade for anyone but might still be of use. This stuff can either be /randomed off , given to alts, or turned in to the Guild Bank.
<li>
<b>Epic drops</b> The awarding of these drops will be decided prior to the raid.  If a member sets up a raid to get a drop for an epic, then the drop is theirs.
<li>
<b>Loot list</b> This is used while farming armor in Kael/HoT.  For an example of how a loot list works, click <a href="http://www.mindfork.com/nk/lootlist.html">this link</a>.  
</ul>
<P>
 
<b><big>Need Before Greed</big></b>
<P>
A big part of being a Nomadic Knight is sharing.  We help each other move forward in the game, and sometimes that requires that we sacrifice our own personal fortune for the betterment of a guild mate.  If you do not absolutely need an item, please consider letting another guild member have it.  Their upgrade will help you in the end by making us more powerful as a whole.  You are not required to pass down your old items as you get upgrades, but we encourage it.
<P>
Trying to stick to the guidelines of Need Before Greed makes the game more fun for everyone and is a good way to live your life in general.  Its just good karma. :)
<P>

 

<center><big><big><b>Have fun!</b></big></big></center>
<P>
Remember this is a game and it should be fun for everyone. Do not allow yourself to stress or cause others stress during the raid. Follow instructions of the raid leader and take occasional mishaps lightly. If the raid is not going well, post a constructive suggestion on the boards after you log out to make it go more smoothly the next time. 

<P>
 
 
<b><big>Raid Hosting Information</big></b>

<P> 
Both officers and non officers will be allowed to host raids, however, the raid and raid leader must be approved by Mystykal, Erki, or Desane. In cases where someone’s raid leader experience is unknown, an officer may assign someone to co-host the raid. To have a raid approved, email or post the details with the request to Mystykal, Erki, or Desane. The details will be reviewed and posted on the board if approved. 
<P>
<b>Details to include in post:</b><br>
Date of Raid<br>
Place of raid (a link to a map is recommended)<br>
Meeting place<br>
Meeting and start time in EST and GMT - GMT is EST plus 5 (noon EST is 5pm GMT)<br>
Details of transportation to and from (if available)<br>
Type of loot (god,etc)<br>
Minimum level requirements<br>
Any other useful or pertinent information<br>
<P>
<b>Raid standards:</b>
<ul>
<li>Raid leaders organize raids for the benefit of all attendees and not for their own personal gain. Raid fees and loot preferences will generally not be acceptable. Any special circumstances for these should be discussed with an officer in advance and clearly announced in the post.

<li>Whenever possible it is good to assist guild members in arranging transportation to and from the raid, but not required.
<li>In some cases it may be necessary to deviate from standard raid policies. These should be approved in advance by an officer and clearly defined in the raid announcements.
</ul>
<P>

<b>Qualifications for leading a raid:</b>
<ul>
<li>You should be familiar with and prepared to enforce raid policy/rules.
<li>You should be familiar with the zone you intend to raid.
<li>You should be able to respond to multiple tells and give directions quickly and effectively
</ul>
<P>

<b>Raid leaders responsibilities:</b>
<ul>
<li>Arrange groups with appropriate mix and level where possible
<li>Ensure all attendees are appropriate level for the zone
<li>Ensure all attendees are aware of the raid rules and have a map of the zone
<li>Resolve any disputes and address any misconduct
<li>Ensure corpse recovery of all attendees prior to logging
<li>Ensure all have been offered the opportunity to be led to a safe area to camp prior to logging
<li>Because you are assuming all of the above, it may be good to (1) call the raid’s end 30 minutes prior to when you are prepared to log (2) pre-assign someone reliable to take over in case real life or technical issues force you to leave early.
</ul>
<P>


Last minute miniraids, exp grinding, and other mass guild get togethers do not require approval in advance, however, the organizer is expected to follow raid leader standards and raid rules to the extent possible.
