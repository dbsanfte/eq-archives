Congratulations to yet another epic'ed druid in the guild, Zuuz!  
<P>
<center><img src="pics/zuuzepic.jpg"></center>
<P>
Due to death bugs from preordering the new expansion, we have not been doing much raiding.  Yesterday, some brave NK's went out to fight some new monsters and laugh in the face of death.  
<P>
Shinkicker tipped off the guild that the Evolved Burrower was up in Acrylia Caverns, so a force of Knights went there to take it down.  The fight was a success!  23 Knights fought, 23 Knights lived to tell the tale!  The only deaths were pets.
<P>
<center><img src="pics/burrower.jpg">&nbsp&nbsp<img src="pics/burrowercorpse.jpg"></center>
<P>
The burrower dropped <a href="http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=10130" target="_blank">Spell: Spirit of Snow</a> and <a href="http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=16252" target="_blank">Spell: Hammer of Souls</a>, which were banked.  It also dropped a <a href="http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=13332" target="_blank">Glowing Orb of Luclinite</a>, which went to Zuuz, and 2 <a href="http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=8885" target="_blank">Bile Coated Codex</a>, which went to Ibenkarrim and Lafortee.
<P>
Mystykal will tell the tale of the next adventure:
<P>
"Boy, did we have an adventurous day today!  We set off to Ssra for our normal Wednesday raid, to go visit the basement and begin farming pieces needed for Shissar bane weapons.  Once everyone was in the Temple of Ssra, I checked track, and Rhag Zhezum was up.  This is a mob that the Nomadic Knights has never met before, but with 15 people and some quick research, we decided that we would try our hand at killing him." 
<P>
<center><img src="pics/rhag1.jpg">&nbsp&nbsp<img src="pics/rhag1corpse.jpg"></center>
<P> 

"The kill went very well, with only Rhag Zhezum and Ubgrog having suffered.  We got some nice drops from him as well.  We got <a href="http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=10130" target="_blank">Spell: Spirit of Snow</a> (Bank), <a href="http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=8520" target="_blank">Spell: Mask of the Stalker</a> (Mystykal),  <a href="http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=12059" target="_blank">Serpent Skin Armlet</a> to Crawflowr and Divaythe, <a href="http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=8750" target="_blank">Mana Twined Staff</a> (Nvie), and <a href="http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=13332" target="_blank">Glowing Orb of Luclinite</a> (Ibenkarrim)."
<P>

"Upon the untimely death of Rhag Zhezum,  Rhag Mozdezh was spawned on a floor above us.  We called out to the guild to see if anyone else wished to join us.  We were joined by 4 more Knights and then proceeded to make our way through the temple to meet Rhag Mozdezh.  Clearing his guards was a bit tougher than for Rhag Zhezum, as we found out they have an AE stun.  However, we disabled his guards quickly and made our way into his chamber."
<P> 
<center><img src="pics/rhag2.jpg">&nbsp&nbsp<img src="pics/rhag2corpse.jpg"></center>
 <P>
"After a stunning fight, and a few casualties - Rhag Mozdezh had died at the hands of NK.  He was rather gracious with loot, as we received <a href="http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=10130" target="_blank">Spell: Spirit of Snow</a> (3rd of the day for bank), <a href="http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=7573" target="_blank">Gloves of Control</a> (Desane), <a href="http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=10233" target="_blank">Talisman of Evasion</a> (Nvie),  <a href="http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=9329" target="_blank">Spell: Maelstrom of Electricity</a> (Jimbop), and <a href="http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=13332" target="_blank">Glowing Orb of Luclinite</a> (Snack)."
<P>

"For us, this was a big accomplishment - not just taking the mobs on our first attempt, but doing so with small numbers in attendance.  Grats to everyone that was part of such a successful evening!  I look forward to more trips into Ssra."
<P>
Congratulations Knights!

On Wednesday, July 9, guess who we killed again? Vindi!  This time Estima received the breastplate and Starzz received Vindi's head for the Gloves of Earthcrafting quest.  
<P>
<center><img src="pics/vindicorpse3.jpg"></center>
<P>
We have another epic wielder to show off!  Congratz to Neebone for completing the Necromancer epic!
<P>
<center><img src="pics/neeboneepic.jpg"></center>
<P>
On Sunday, July 13, NK headed into the Temple of Veeshan to the Halls of Testing.  This was our first trip here as a guild.  After a rough start, we found our rhythm and did well!  We had 16 pieces of armor drop, including a chain breastplate which went to Crawflowr.  Congratz to everyone who got loot!
<P>
<center><img src="pics/hotkill1.jpg">&nbsp&nbsp<img src="pics/hotkill2.jpg"></center>
<P>
While we were there, Desane snuck around and turned us all into dark elves, except Surfear, who somehow avoided him!  Thank goodness it was only temporary, or else I'd never have been able to show my face in Rivervale again!
<P>
<center><img src="pics/desanesvision.jpg"></center>
<P>
I don't know which is scarier - seeing a dark elf wielding a druid epic, the holiest of all druid artifacts, or Mystykal's helmet.  Yikes!

We've been busy! :)
<P>
On July 5th, we had another member receive their epic.  Congratulations to Dalvore on completing the druid epic and receiving the Nature Walkers Scimitar!
<P>
<center><img src="pics/dalvoreepic.jpg"></center>
<P>
On Sunday, July 6th, we had another Nomadic Knights first!  We took out Doomshade in the Umbral Plains.  It was our first time attempting this, and we had only one death while doing so!  Go go chain runer Desane!  You can see his half naked self looting the corpse in the picture below.
<P>
<center><img src="pics/doomshade.jpg"><P><img src="pics/doomcorpse.jpg"></center>
<P>
Thank you to Gruven for the great pictures!  I wish that I could have been there for this fight.  It looks like it was an awesome one!
<P>
Doomshade was very generous with his loot.  Zayle received a <a href="http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=10277" target="_blank">Bow of Doom</a>, Nvie received the <a href="http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=9010" target="_blank">Stave of Wit</a>, Darrack received <a href="http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=8959" target="_blank">Pebble Crusher</a>, and Degas received <a href="http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=9329" target="_blank">Spell: Maelstrom of Electricity</a>.  We also received two more spells for the vault: <a href="http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=8486" target="_blank">Shock of Firey Blades</a> and <a href="http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=8504" target="_blank">Koadic's Endless Intellect</a>.  Congratulations to everyone who received loot!
<P>
On that same day, we attempted to take out Faydedar, my last epic mob.  However, Celestial Navigators had more people in the zone before we did, so the decision was made to let them take down Faydedar for their druid's epic.  We assisted them, and they were successful.  I admit I was a little disappointed, but I figured that with another day or two, we would be able to try it.
<P>
And I was right - today, July 7, 2003, we killed Faydedar for my epic!  The fight went off without a hitch with no deaths.  Members of Celestial Navigators came to help us with the kill in return for our favor of the previous day.  It worked out great for everyone and now CN and NK have two happy druids with leafblowers!
<P>
Here's the little runt fighting for his very short life!
<P>
<center><img src="pics/faydedar.jpg"></center>
<P>
And here I am a little later on, with my epic. :)
<P>
<center><img src="pics/karisunepic.jpg"></center>
<P>
Thank you to all the Knights who have helped me achieve this goal.  I have been with this guild for pretty much all of my EverQuest life, and I am very proud to be a Knight.  To have reached this point in the game is amazing to me, and I know that I would not have been able to do it without the help of the guild.

I am proud to introduce the first epic bard in Nomadic Knights - Janika!
<P>
<center><img src="pics/janikaepic.jpg"></center>
<P>
On a tip from our trusty friend Shemm, Nomadic Knights headed to Old Sebilis, to meet with the Undead Bard for a battle.  While in his death throes, the Bard called upon Trakanon for aid, and the Nomadic Knights were ready!
<P>
<center><img src="pics/udbard.jpg"></center>
<P>
Trakanon went down with minimal deaths on our part.  Check out those teeth! Yikes!
<P>
<center><img src="pics/trak.jpg">&nbsp&nbsp<img src="pics/trakcorpse.jpg"></center>
<P>
In addition to the Trakanon Gut Strings for Janika's epic, Trakanon gifted us with the <a href="http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=2017" target="_blank">Elder Spiritist's Breastplate</a>, which was given to Starzz.  We also received some nice spells, Tigir's Insects and Avatar.
<P>
Thank you to everyone who came to help with this kill, and congratulations again to Janika!

Happy Birthday America! :) <img src="pics/flag1.gif">
