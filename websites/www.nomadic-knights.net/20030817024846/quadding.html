<b>Catkin's Guide to Quadding</b> - Taken from the Message Board
<P>
1) Prepare
<P>
Get your spell set ready before you start - or you'll find yourself trying to re-memm spells mid-quad<p> 

Buffs (you'll need to refresh them if they drop off mid-quad)<br>
SoW/SoE (you'll need the speed to outrun the mobs)<br>
Snare/Ensnare (for pulling)<br>
Damage spell - Lightning Strike or similar AoE for nuking<br>
Root (for finishing)<br>
DoT (for finishing)<br>
Evac (for when it all goes wrong)<br>
<P>
If you have a mana buff, this will help immensely.
<P>
2) Assess area
<P>
<ul>
<li>Is it camped already? Are there are any named mobs that need to be dealt with separately, lured away, or just avoided?
<li>If there are other players nearby, plan where you can quad without interfering with their pulling area.
<li>Decide where to quad. I go for a straight line (2 to 3 nukes before turning round), or a triangle (run from point to point, nuking as you go). Watch out for hills and slopes. These can hide mobs (and prevent you from nuking) and also can allow mobs to get too close before you are allowed to cast.
<li>Check out what mobs are where, and work out a pull order.
<li>Are there any potential adds? Work out how to avoid them if you can.
</ul>
<P>
3) Refresh buffs if you're not sure how old they are. Med up to at least 80% mana.
<P>
<b>Go! Go! Go!</b>
<P>
4) Pulling
<P>
Pull with Ensnare. If you pull with Snare it may wear off mid-kite, with hilarious consequences.
<P>
While you're still pulling, keep an Ensnare's worth of distance between yourself and the mobs that are already snared, or they'll aggro you while you're trying to pull.<P>

Run the mobs around in your pulling area. You need to get them grouped together, and I find the best way to do this is to run round them in ever-decreasing circles until they are nicely bunched together. Position the mobs at one end or point of your pulling area.
<P>
5) Nuke<P>
Run away from the mobs and nuke when you are just past the distance it is safe to do so. After a time you will learn how far away you need to be. To start with, get a good distance away, and keep hitting that spell button until the mobs are close enough to cast.
Wait till mobs are nearly on top of you (if they aren't already, ho ho ho) then speed nimbly off to your next casting point and nuke again.
<P>
6) Finishing off<P>
If you're lucky, all the mobs will stop running at the same time. You can then finish them off with one final nuke. 
If some mobs are still running, you may have to root then dot (this is where a clicky dot comes in invaluable).
<P>
7) Med<P>
Loot the bodies, then find a safe place to med. I have to confess that if I'm quadding grabbers, I port to Nexus and med there, then port back to DSP when I'm ready.
<P>
Notes<P>
a) I aim to start a run on 80 mana, and end on 20m. How close I take it depends on how safe the area is, and if there's a zone close. In DSP I like to have 20m buffer for dealing with adds and trains. If you're oom, your SoW will run out just as that shroom train gallops over the horizon!<P>
b) If there's any possibility of Things Going Wrong (especially in a busy zone) make a /shout Train to Zone hot button, so you don't have to try and type while running.<P>
c) Don't talk while quadding. It is absolutely fatal. Your friends just will just have to wait! Chat while you're medding, then warn them before you start your next pull.<P>
d) Adds. Snare them, draw them away, and root them to one side of your quadding zone. Dispose of them after the quad.<P>
e) Time of the day. The best quadding zones (eg, Cobalt Scar) get crowded at peak times. Personally I think it's more trouble than it's worth trying to quad in a crowded zone. There won't be enough mobs to go round, and it will all end in tears...<P>
f) Accidents. Be careful switching targets mid-quad. If you have to refresh a buff, remember to tab-target back to the mob, or you will nuke yourself . It goes without saying (er, so I'll say it anyway) that rooting yourself while quadding is a BAD idea.<P>
g) Hmm, this notes section is getting out of hand!<P>
h) Practice makes perfect. There isn't much margin for error when quadding. If your mobs catch up with you and hit you, you'll probably die. Just make sure they never get the opportunity.<P>
