We've been busy! :)
<P>
On July 5th, we had another member receive their epic.  Congratulations to Dalvore on completing the druid epic and receiving the Nature Walkers Scimitar!

On Sunday, July 6th, we had another Nomadic Knights first!  We took out Doomshade in the Umbral Plains.  It was our first time attempting this, and we had only one death while doing so!  Go go chain runer Desane!  You can see his half naked self looting the corpse in the picture below.

<P>
Thank you to Gruven for the great pictures!  I wish that I could have been there for this fight.  It looks like it was an awesome one!
<P>
Doomshade was very generous with his loot.  Zayle received a <a href="http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=10277" target="_blank">Bow of Doom</a>, Nvie received the <a href="http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=9010" target="_blank">Stave of Wit</a>, Darrack received <a href="http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=8959" target="_blank">Pebble Crusher</a>, and Degas received <a href="http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=9329" target="_blank">Spell: Maelstrom of Electricity</a>.  We also received two more spells for the vault: <a href="http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=8486" target="_blank">Shock of Firey Blades</a> and <a href="http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=8504" target="_blank">Koadic's Endless Intellect</a>.  Congratulations to everyone who received loot!
<P>
On that same day, we attempted to take out Faydedar, my last epic mob.  However, Celestial Navigators had more people in the zone before we did, so the decision was made to let them take down Faydedar for their druid's epic.  We assisted them, and they were successful.  I admit I was a little disappointed, but I figured that with another day or two, we would be able to try it.
<P>
And I was right - today, July 7, 2003, we killed Faydedar for my epic!  The fight went off without a hitch with no deaths.  Members of Celestial Navigators came to help us with the kill in return for our favor of the previous day.  It worked out great for everyone and now CN and NK have two happy druids with leafblowers!
<P>
Here's the little runt fighting for his very short life!

And here I am a little later on, with my epic. :)

<P>
Thank you to all the Knights who have helped me achieve this goal.  I have been with this guild for pretty much all of my EverQuest life, and I am very proud to be a Knight.  To have reached this point in the game is amazing to me, and I know that I would not have been able to do it without the help of the guild.

I am proud to introduce the first epic bard in Nomadic Knights - Janika!
<P>

<P>
On a tip from our trusty friend Shemm, Nomadic Knights headed to Old Sebilis, to meet with the Undead Bard for a battle.  While in his death throes, the Bard called upon Trakanon for aid, and the Nomadic Knights were ready!
<P>
<center><img src="pics/udbard.jpg"></center>
<P>
Trakanon went down with minimal deaths on our part.  Check out those teeth! Yikes!
<P>
<center><img src="pics/trak.jpg">&nbsp&nbsp<img src="pics/trakcorpse.jpg"></center>
<P>
In addition to the Trakanon Gut Strings for Janika's epic, Trakanon gifted us with the <a href="http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=2017" target="_blank">Elder Spiritist's Breastplate</a>, which was given to Starzz.  We also received some nice spells, Tigir's Insects and Avatar.
<P>
Thank you to everyone who came to help with this kill, and congratulations again to Janika!
