You will need an <a href="http://www.ezboard.com/" target="_blank">EZBoard</a> account to do so.  Visit <a href="http://www.ezboard.com/registration/userregistration_global.html" target="_blank">this link</a> to create an account with EZBoard if you do not have one already.
<P>
Before you apply, be sure to visit the rest of our site to see what our rules and policies are.  We will expect you to know these and understand them before you post an application.

<P>
Please note that we do not accept characters which have been purchased from other players (eBayed).  We want you to have done your levelling and exploring on your own.
<P>
While in the application process, please /join nkchat in game to speak with current members.  We would like you to group with us so that we can get a feel for you and your playing style, and so you can get to know ours.  Please remember that if you come on a raid with us, you will be coming as a guest, and will not be entitled to any loot.
<P>
<b>If you are invited to join Nomadic Knights, please keep in mind that you will be subject to a 30 day probationary period.</b>  During this period, we may remove you from the guild if we feel you are not a good fit for Nomadic Knights.
<P>
Once you have completed your probationary period with NK, you may have your alternate characters invited to the guild.  Alts must have a minimum level of 30 to be admitted.  The only exception to this is bazaar mules.
<P>
If you have any questions, please contact an officer in game or through nkchat.  Thanks!
