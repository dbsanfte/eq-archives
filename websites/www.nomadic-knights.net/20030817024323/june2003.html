Sunday, June 22, 2003 marked a big turning point in the Nomadic Knights and the types of monsters we can attempt.  We were victorious in slaying Derakor the Vindicator in Kael, known to most as Vindi.
<P>

<P>
Congratulations to Coradon who received the <a href="http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=5521" target="_blank">Chestplate of Vindication</a> and to Warmheart who received <a href="http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=9028" target="_blank">Derakor's Head</a> to continue his quest for the <a href="http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/quest.html?quest=971" target="_blank">Gloves of Earthcrafting</a>.
<P>
This will not be the last time we kill Vindi.  He will fall again and again before our blades and we shall all reap the benefits of his death.

Instead of our usual raid to Kael on Wednesday, we decided to attempt some new monsters in Umbral Plains.  We went after Radir Fireshower and Tawro Icequake.  Once we killed each of them, their spirits came after us in revenge!  Well, they were no match for the Knights.
<P>
<center><img src="pics/radircorpse.jpg">&nbsp&nbsp<img src="pics/tawrocorpse.jpg"></center>
<P>
The Spirit of Radir dropped two <a href="http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=8972" target="_blank">Mithril Edged Shortswords</a> and a <a href="http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=8969" target="_blank">Bracelet of Fortitude</a>.  The Spirit of Tawro dropped a <a href="http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=8969" target="_blank">Bracelet of Fortitude</a>, a <a href="http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=8953" target="_blank">Flaming Dirk</a>, and a <a href="http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=9012" target="_blank">Rod of Virtue</a>.  Congratulations to those who received loot!  Darrack and Aberon each received a sword, Soladinne received the dirk, Venys received the rod, and Ozene and Janika each received a bracelet.

On Saturday, it became known to us that the dragon Gorenaire was lurking in the Dreadlands, killing those that came within her reach.  We decided to mobilize and remove her threat from the land.
<P>
<center><img src="pics/gorenaire.jpg"></center>
<P>
Well, she caught us unaware, and we died.  But, we mobilized again, and were able to take her down on the second try!
<P>
<center><img src="pics/gorecorpse.jpg"></center>
<P>
Congratz to those who received spells and loot from her corpse.  The ones that I remember - Irishhealer received the spell <a href="http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=8474" target="_blank">Banishment of Shadows</a>, Mulener received the spell <a href="http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=8523" target="_blank">Entrapping Roots</a>, and Malanor received <a href="http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=84" target="_blank">Orb of Tishan</a>.  After that fight, this halfling was thinking of snacks rather than loot, so I can't remember what else was left.  Please let me know if you remember! :)
<P>
After the fight with Gorenaire, information reached us that Venril Sathir was lurking in Karnor's Castle.  We decided to take our force there to confront him.
<P>
<center><img src="pics/vscorpse.jpg"></center>
<P>
As you can see, he fell swiftly.  Note to self: bring notepad along when going to fights.  I cannot remember the loot he dropped outside of the <a href="http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=1364" target="_blank">Deepwater Greaves</a> which went to Dustinkarl, as he was the only paladin we had with us.
<P>
On Sunday, we attempted the Plane of Hate.  As I had to leave before we entered the plane, I do not have information about how that fight went.  Please let me know if you have pictures or stories to share! :)

Nomadic Knights is proud to announce that we have two more epic holders.  Congratz to Mabell on completing the rogue epic and Mesozioc on completing the monk epic.  Sorry no picture of Meso, he appears to be camera shy. :)

My, what a busy weekend!
<P>
On Saturday, a large fighting force of Nomadic Knights gathered in Skyfire to help Catalizt with the final fight of her epic quest, Ragefire.  I know that I was biting my fingernails, since I tend to be scared of dragons due to my short size.
<P>
I had nothing to worry about, since we were spectacular!  Both the human and dragon forms of Ragefire went down easily, and Catalizt looted his bloody heart.  We had no deaths!  She and Desane ran off and soon we were treated to constant links of her new toy - the <a href="http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=152" target="_blank">Water Sprinkler of Nemh Ankh</a>!  Congratulations Catalizt!  I was later the recipient of its healing magic.  
<P>
<center><img src="pics/cataliztepic.jpg"></center>
<P>
On Sunday, we gathered in Burning Woods to help Arley fight Ixiblat Fer, the fire elemental.  Of course, we won. :)  We've got this fight down pat now!  No deaths.  As a bonus, Ixiblat decided to give us his cloak, the <a href="http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=2190" target="_blank">Cloak of Flames</a>.  Congratulations to Janika on receiving the cloak!
<P>
<center><img src="pics/arleyixi.jpg"></center>
<P>
After taking down Ixiblat, we headed to Chardok to fight the royals to get drops for Arley and Elnon.  We fought hard, but most of us ended up dead in the library.  I had to leave as my halfling tummy was rumbling and there were things to be tidied in the hobbit hole, but many of the Knights continued onward.  Both Arley and Elnon received epic drops.  Congrats to you both!
<P>
We will be heading back to Skyfire on Tuesday to kill Ragefire again.  Please check the guild message board for the time.  I am going to try not to be so scared this time, since I know I have the Knights to protect me! :)
