    After the application is filled out, an officer will contact you for further

    <p align="center"><u><b>Role of a General Member</b></u></p>
    <p align="left">As a general member, you will be expected to participate by 
    the following:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
      <p align="left">Checking <b>and </b>posting on the message board a minimum 
      of once a week.&nbsp; It is highly recommended to check more often, as you 
      may find something is going on that you would want to attend.</li>
      <li>
      <p align="left">Provided there are sufficient members online, group with 
      guild members first.&nbsp; We understand that there are not always enough 
      people online to group with, or you have friends that you would like to 
      group with.&nbsp; We encourage you to bring along your friends, but if you 
      do not group within the guild you are missing out on gaining valuable 
      knowledge of other guild members, such as fighting technique and habits.&nbsp; 
      These become important as your character progresses in Everquest and 
      especially when you need to group with others for higher level drops.&nbsp; 
      If you cannot find enough members in the guild in your level range, 
      consider checking with our allied guilds to see if you can find more.&nbsp; 
      For a list of current guild alliances,
      <a href="http://www.nomadic-knights.net/alliances.html">click here</a>.</li>
      <li>
      <p align="left">If there is a raid in your level group and you are online, 
      you will be expected to either attend the raid or give reason as to why 
      you cannot.&nbsp; Again, this goes to knowing the other members of the 
      guild and building teamwork within the guild. Raids will be arranged in 
      accordance with policies set up by the raid officer. To view those 
      policies, <a href="http://www.nomadic-knights.net/raids.html">click here</a>.&nbsp; 
      Guilds that we are allies with may also have raids that you want to 
      attend.&nbsp; Please check their forums on the message board to see what 
      they have going on and don't forget to let them know if you plan on 
      attending.</li>
      <li>
      <p align="left">Be willing to assist guild members when possible.&nbsp; 
      All members will want to get an item of importance to them at some point 
      in playing the game, and they will need help.&nbsp; If you see a post on 
      the message board or discussion in game about plans for this and you are 
      in the level range, please consider helping them out.&nbsp; At the very 
      least, be willing to apologize if you cannot help and wish them good luck.&nbsp; 
      If you need to request the assistance of the guild with a drop or quest, 
      we recommend a 2-week notice so that people have time to see it and 
      hopefully get more to attend and help out.&nbsp; </li>
      <li>
      <p align="left">Recruiting:&nbsp; As a Nomadic Knight, you may find people 
      asking you about joining our guild.&nbsp; In order to keep a good 
      relationship with everyone, including those that would want to apply to 
      our guild, simply refer them to our website, and let them know there are 
      application instructions on our website.</li>

    <p align="center"><u><b>Disciplinary Actions</b></u></p>
    <p align="center">&nbsp;When a complaint
    is received to the officers about a member of the guild, it will be reviewed by them. Upon
    this review, the officers will issue a one-time warning to the player in question regarding
    the action that lead to the complaint. Upon receiving this warning, the player will be
    placed on probation for a set period of time depending on the specific offense. If 
    another offense occurs during the probationary period, the member will be disbanded from the guild at that time.
    Certain offenses, such as theft, will result in no warnings, but upon verification of the
    claim, the member will be removed from the guild.&nbsp; In addition, any 
    offense within the probationary period following an invitation into Nomadic 
    Knights will result in removal from the guild.</td>

    of a Knight</b></u><p align="left">
<!--EZCODE BOLD START-->    The following is an example of some of the things 
    that Nomadic Knights will not tolerate. Exceptions on these behaviors are 
    given on a case-by-case basis.&nbsp; Please contact an officer in game or 
    leave a post on the message board asking for exception authorization.<ul>
      <li><p align="left">Whining</li>
      <li><p align="left">Begging (For money, items, ports, rezzes, etc.)</li>
      <li><p align="left">Excessive use of foul language in game or on the 
      message board</li>
      <li><p align="left">Demanding donations for services rendered.&nbsp; For 
      more information on this topic, please check our
      <a href="http://www.nomadic-knights.net/goodpractice.html">Good Practices 
      page</a>.</li>
      <li><p align="left">Intentional bashing or flaming guild members in game 
      or in any other way.</li>
      <li><p align="left">Intentional training of mobs onto other players</li>
      <li><p align="left">Ninja looting</li>
      <li><p align="left">Camp Stealing - Camp stealing can include traditional
    camps and also when groups claim multiple camps. The main type of group in the latter
    category is an AOE group. If you want to camp an area an AOE group is claiming, <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><!--EZCODE UNDERLINE START--><u>--DO
    NOT</u><!--EZCODE UNDERLINE END--><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> just walk in and take what you want, send a tell to the group and ask if you
    can camp x. This is more likely to achieve an amicable settlement. </li>
      <li><p align="left">Playing using the Anonymous mode.&nbsp; We require the 
      guild tag be shown, therefore Role playing is allowed and Anonymous is 
      not.</li>
      <li><p align="left">Lack of participation in the guild.&nbsp; If real life 
      requires you to take extended time away from the game, please let us know 
      so we don't just think you don't want to participate in the guild.&nbsp; 
      You may be questioned on things that are going on here on the website, and 
      not knowing the information (raid rules, guild policies, etc.) may put 
      your guild participation in question.</li>
      <li><p align="left">Powerleveling (Helping a character gain experience and 
      levels faster than what would usually be the norm) or twinking (Giving a 
      character better equipment than what they should have at that level).&nbsp; 
      As always, Nomadic Knights has never and will never dedicate full guild 
      efforts to powerleveling or twinking.</li>
