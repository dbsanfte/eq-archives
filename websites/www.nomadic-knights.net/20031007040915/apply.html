Nomadic Knights is looking for good people to join us.  Are you one of them?
<P>
At this time, we are considering applications from all classes.

<P>
We require a minimum level of 51.  New recruits should post an application on the <a href="http://pub149.ezboard.com/bnomadicknights" target="_blank">guild message board</a> in the proper section.  You will need an <a href="http://www.ezboard.com/" target="_blank">EZBoard</a> account to do so.  Visit <a href="http://www.ezboard.com/registration/userregistration_global.html" target="_blank">this link</a> to create an account with EZBoard if you do not have one already.
<P>
Before you apply, be sure to visit the rest of our site to see what our rules and policies are.  We will expect you to know these and understand them before you post an application.

<P>
When you apply, please include a link to a <a href="http://www.magelo.com/" target="_blank">Magelo</a> of your current equipment, if you have one.  Also, please describe why you want to join Nomadic Knights.  If you wish, please include your previous experience with guilds and your travels through the lands of Norrath.
<P>
While in the application process, please /join nkchat in game to speak with current members.  We would like you to group with us so that we can get a feel for you and your playing style, and so you can get to know ours.  Please remember that if you come on a raid with us, you will be coming as a guest, and will not be entitled to any loot.
<P>
If you are invited to join Nomadic Knights, please keep in mind that you will be subject to a 30 day probationary period.  During this period, we may remove you from the guild if we feel you are not a good fit for Nomadic Knights.
<P>

If you have any questions, please contact a officer in game or through nkchat.  Thanks!
