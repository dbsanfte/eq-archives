There are definitely lots of fun adventures to be found in the Lost Dungeons of Norrath.  I've traveled to at least one of the dungeons in every zone, and found them all to be challenging and fun.  There are lots of things to find on the ground, but not many of them edible unfortunately.  Give me any potatoes you find and I will make you some soup to keep you warm in those cold dungeons, especially those in Everfrost.  Brrr!  
<P>
Here's some pictures from various adventures the Knights have been having in the dungeons.

Almric, Mizz, Janika, Ubgrog, Crawflowr, and Nvie went into one of the dungeons in Rujarkian Hills and had a successful rescue mission.  However, on the way out, they set off a trap that Almric has aptly named "the beer bomb".  Somehow, they stumbled out into the sunlight, peering through bleary eyes and muttering to themselves about orcish ale.
<P>
As Almric said, "Personally, I think Boozebelly or Furin were in there before us!"
<P>
They must have been hanging out in Everfrost too, because we set off a "beer bomb" in one of Miragul's dungeons.  No pictures, but my head is still aching.

Jimbop and I joined a group from Promethian Order in storming one of the Everfrost dungeons.  Somehow, I picked up a pet there.  First a goblin in the Rujarkian Hills, and now this... well.. I don't know what it is!  I named it George and he fought pretty well.  Sadly, he died in one of the battles.  I won't forget him though!

Bored while in a dungeon?  Unlikely, but hey... play some chess while you try to warm up!
<P>
Keep those pictures and stories coming!  And be sure to <a href="http://pub149.ezboard.com/fnomadicknightsfrm9" target="_blank">vote</a> on which dungeon we will attempt to raid!

First, a moment of silence for those killed in the acts of terrorism that happened 2 years ago, on September 11, 2001.

Your lovely webmistress has been putting up her feet lately and resting, so big apologies for the lack of updates to the site!  We have been BUSY though!
<P>
Almric sent me this funny picture from Plane of Valor. :)

Thanks Almric!

Last month, three groups of Knights headed into the Plane of Nightmare and did the Hedge quest.  They succeeded and were flagged for Terris Thule!  Divaythe won <a href="http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=16485" target="_blank">Elbow Spiked Arm Plates</a>.
<P>

Terris herself even showed up!

<P>
Uh Divaythe... I think she wants those armplates back!
<P>
The big bad Rumblecrush went down in the last couple of weeks too.

The big fun that most of us have been having this week has been with Lost Dungeons of Norrath.  We will be attempting a raid to one of the dungeons at some point.  Members, be sure to check out the <a href="http://pub149.ezboard.com/fnomadicknightsfrm9" target="_blank">Raid Forum</a> and vote on your dungeon of choice!  You need member access to see the forum.

Sharrien picked up these two shots in the Rujarkian Hills dungeon!

Thanks Sharrien for sending those in!

I've been travelling the dungeons myself, and having lots of fun discovering new baking and smithing recipes.  Last night, my group came across a mysterious crate in one of the Rujarikan dungeons.  I was nervous about opening it, but Mizz wasn't, and sent in her warder to break it open.  Instead of a trap or treasure, we found a slave hiding in there.  He decided that he wanted to follow me, and he fought a few battles with us before running off.

That's all for now!  See you in Norrath! :)
