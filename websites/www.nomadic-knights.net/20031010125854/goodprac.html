<b>Good Practices Within EverQuest</b> - by Karisun
<P>
EverQuest is a game, and as we get wrapped up within the game, it can be easy to forget that there are people behind each character we meet.  There is truth to the phrase "You catch more flies with honey than with vinegar".  If you are kind to others, word gets around and you will find that it is easy to get people to help you when you need it.  If you are rude and ungrateful, you will find that the game progression may be slower than you would like.
<P>
Being polite and respectful to others is the key to getting along in EverQuest.  If you need a port or a resurrection spell cast upon you, politely asking and offering to donate for that persons services is an acceptable way to do so.  If you have services to offer, requesting that others pay you for your time is acceptable.  The key is to request a reasonable price for your service, and not to demand.  You can always say no if the price offered is too low.  The key is being polite about it.
<P>
While in a game that relies on text and typing to communicate, it can be easy to be misunderstood.  When asking for a service, use complete sentences.  Say please and thank you.  You will find that more people will come to your aid when you speak politely.
<P>
Examples:<br>
  Sow plz - bad<br>
May I please have a SoW? - good <br>
May I please have a SoW? I will donate for your time. - even better<br>
Excuse me kind druid, could you cast upon me the spell of Spirit of Wolf?  I shall give you coin for your time. - excessive, but also nice :)<br>
<P>
Guild members will usually help other members with things like ports and rezzes for free.  That is a part of being in a guild - helping your guild mates.  However, you should not demand these things from members.  Guild members are not your slaves, nor can they be expected to drop what they are doing every time you need a favor.  Members who can port or rez are not required to help you.  If the favor you are asking for involves needing a spell component, such as a gem or coffin, you need to provide this.  
<P>
Demanding payment from other guild members for ports and the like is not acceptable.  If you don't want to port or rez someone, then say no.  Don't demand to be paid for your time.  The only exception to this is if some type of components are needed.  It is reasonable to expect that a gem or other material will be provided by the person who needs the favor, and if not the item itself, then the amount it would cost to purchase that item.
<P>
Most guild members who have tradeskill abilities will do combines of items for free as long as you provide the materials, such as metal for smithing or gems for jewelcraft.  If you do not have the materials, then the member with the skill will charge you a reasonable price for the materials.  Please keep in mind that even when someone is a master of a tradeskill, failures can happen.  It is a fact of the game.  They are not responsible for any losses of ingredients during the creation process.
