      Raids will be set up for the purpose of an opportunity to group with other 
    guildees and obtain experience and items that a single group may not be able 
    to obtain by them selves. A few basic raid rules will be needed to ensure 
    the safety and enjoyment of everyone.</font><p align="left"><font size="2">&nbsp;- There will be one Raid Leader assigned to each raid. He/she may ask others 
    to assist but this is at their discretion. All instruction should be taken 
    from the raid leader or any person he/she has asked to assist in running the 
    raid.<br>
    · All raids will have a minimum level requirement. If you do not meet the 
    requirement you will not be assigned to a group in the raid.<br>
    · The starting time, meeting place and length of the raid will be stated in 
    the Raid announcement. Raid attendees/guildees will not be required to 
    escort you in or out of the zone if you will be late or need to leave early. 
    However, at the discretion of volunteer(s) someone may be able to pick you 
    up. Please do not ask repeatedly for assistance while the raid is going on.<br>
    · If you have a balanced group which you typically worked with, please let 
    the raid leader know in advance and that person will try to place you 
    together unless you are needed to fill another group.<br>
    <br>
      </font><font size="4">Getting started: </font><font size="2"> <br>
      · Ensure that you have a map in hand of the area being raided.<br>
    · Arrive at least 30 minutes before the planned start time of the raid. It 
    will take at least 30 minutes and maybe more to set up groups and coordinate 
    hunting locations. <br>
    · When you arrive at the grouping location, immediately disband your self 
    from any group that you were part of. Put up the Looking For Group tag by 
    typing: /LFG ON (Ensure that you are not in anon or roleplay in order for 
    the leader to see your class and level) <br>
    · Once assigned to a group, move to your group leader's location, remove the 
    LFG tag, sit down and minimize chat until all instructions are stated. <br>
    · Prepare all of your hotkeys. For most characters, this will consist of a 
    &quot;/assist Main_Assist_Name&quot; key. </font><br>
    <br>
      <b>During the Raid: </b> <br>
      </font><font size="1">· 
      </font><font size="2">Raid Leader will use a specified chat channel to communicate to everyone. 
    This will include requests for status from group leaders as well as 
    coordinating the looting of no-drop items. <br>
    · Do not wander away from the group, stick together or you may aggro 
    additional MOBs. Raids are (usually) not the time to explore. <br>
    · Only the group leaders should be communicating with the raid leader or 
    raid assistants unless there is an emergency. If you need to inform the raid 
    leader of some information try to do so via the group leader.<br>
    <br>
      </font><u><font size="4">Loot Rules:
      </font><b><font size="3"> <br>
      </font></b></u><font size="2">
    <br>
      </font>
      <b>General Loot:</b> <font size="2">
      <br>
     · The group leader should designate a master looter within the group. If the 
    group members change during the raid the master looter should distribute the 
    items and coin as evenly as possible before disband.</font><font size="2"><br>
    <br>
      </font>
      <b>Special Items: </b> <font size="2"> <br>
      · When a special item drops, the group leader will notify the Raid Leader of 
    the item and relevant stats on it, to include who can use it. Then the Raid 
    Leader will announce in the chat channel that the item has been looted and 
    ask for those who can use it to let their group leader know. Numbers will be 
    assigned and called out. A /random 1 xx will be done (with xx being the last 
    number assigned) and the winner announced.. The items should be distributed 
    as to how they best support the guild members. First anyone who can use the 
    item for their character at the raid to improve their stats can roll on the 
    item. If no immediate person can use the item, the raid leader will 
    determine some form of equitable distribution such as roll for alts, open 
    roll, one for each group to sell and split proceeds, etc. depending on how 
    many items there are.</font><font size="2"><br>
    <br>
      </font>
      <b>No-Drop Items:</b> <font size="2"> <br>
      · When a no-drop item drops from a MOB, time is of the essence. No-drop 
    items are a special case and will be treated as such. In most cases these 
    items are quest related and should go to whoever is closest to completing 
    the quest. At this time the Raid Leader may ask in /chat channel who needs 
    the item but it will be up to the Raid Leader to decide who gets to loot.
    <br>
    <br>
      </font><b>Have fun:</b><font size="2"><br>
      · Remember this is a game and it should be fun for everyone. Do not allow 
    yourself to stress or cause others stress during the raid. Follow 
    instructions of the raid leader and take occasional mishaps lightly. If the 
    raid is not going well, post a constructive suggestion on the boards after 
    you log to make it go more smoothly the next time. <br>

      <font size="2">Both officers and non officers will be allowed to host raids, however, the 
      raid and raid leader must be approved by Mystykal or Aztor. In cases where 
      someone’s raid leader experience is unknown, Aztor or Mystykal may assign 
      someone to co-host the raid. To have a raid approved, email or post the 
      details with the request to Aztor or Mystykal. The details will be

      </font><b>Qualifications for leading a raid:</b><font size="2"><br>
      -You should be familiar and prepared to enforce raid policy/rules.<br>
      -You should be familiar with the zone you intend to raid.<br>
      -You should be able to respond to multiple tells and give directions 
      quickly and effectively<br>
      <br>
      </font><b>Raid leaders responsibilities:</b><font size="2"><br>
      -Arrange groups with appropriate mix and level where possible<br>
      -Ensure all attendees are appropriate level for the zone<br>
      -Ensure all attendees are aware of the raid rules and have a map of the 
      zone<br>
      -Resolve any disputes and address any misconduct<br>
      -Ensure corpse recovery of all attendees prior to logging<br>
      -Ensure all have been offered the opportunity to be led to a safe area to 
      camp prior to logging<br>
      -Because you are assuming all of the above, it may be good to (1) call the 
      raid’s end 30 minutes prior to when you are prepared to log (2) pre-assign 
      someone reliable to take over incase real life or technical issues force 
      you to leave early.<br>
      <br>
      </font><b>Raid standards:</b><font size="2"><br>
      -Raid leaders organize raids for the benefit of all attendees and not for 
      their own personal gain. Raid fees and loot preferences will generally not 
      be acceptable. Any special circumstances for these should be discussed 
      with Aztor and Mystykal in advance and clearly announced in the post.<br>
      -While it is not the main purpose of the raid to get XP, it is always good 
      to distribute the opportunity for XP whenever possible and safe to do so. 
      Single puller raids should have an “Inc for Group 1, 2 and so on” and 
      unless the mob is too powerful for one group to kill, other groups should 
      allow the announced group to have the kill. No one wants to spend several 
      hours at a raid sitting around watching the power group kill everything 
      when they are capable of killing most of the mobs in the area on their 
      own.<br>
      -Whenever possible it is good to assist guildees in arranging 
      transportation to and from the raid, but not required.<br>
      -In some cases it may be necessary to deviate from standard raid policies 
      such as on Looting rights on Epic Quests, Non familiarity on Explorations, 
      etc. These should also be approved in advance by Aztor or Mystykal and 
      clearly defined in the raid announcements.<br>
      <br>
      Last minute miniraids, powerleveling sessions and other mass guildee get 
      togethers do not require approval in advance, however, the organizer is 
      expected to follow raid leader standards and raid rules to the extent 
      possible.<br>
