<b>Our Guild Charter</b>
<P>
The Nomadic Knights are a guild of friendship who aim to promote fair play and honor throughout the world of Norrath. We will accept those walkers of Norrath or Luclin who have achieved the rank of 51 seasons or more.  
<P>
We will pass our skills and knowledge onto the inexperienced and readily learn from those who are able to teach us new skills. 
<P>
When we fight, we shall do so with honor and integrity.
 <P>
When we gain new equipment, we will share with our members in need and disregard our personal fortunes while doing so.
  <P>
By following these guidelines, we shall achieve our mutual goals, and benefit all within the guild and those who accompany us on our travels. 
<P>
<b>Our Guild Goals</b>
<P>

The Nomadic Knights wish to be a family strong in both people and resources.  Our long-term goals are to become a guild on the Vazaelle server that is known for helping others.  Our short-term goals are to build our guild through quality membership, particpation, and alliances, providing the best that we can offer to players who join us.  We hold organized raids to various zones three times a week.
