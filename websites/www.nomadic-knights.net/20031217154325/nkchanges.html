<big>Changes Ahead for NK</big>
<P>
edited on October 24 - edits are in <b>bold</b>
<P>
On October 18, we had an officer's meeting.  This meeting lasted for close to 5 hours.  There will be some changes occuring within Nomadic Knights.
<P>
We will be refocusing our goals as a guild.  NK is a family style guild.  We watch out for each other, help each other, and have fun with each other.  We expect our members to have lives outside of EverQuest.  We don't require raid attendance, but it is instead strongly encouraged if the raid is happening during a time that you are online.
<P>
We want to have members who are here for the long haul, because they want to have a good group of friends to spend their online time with.  We are not the guild for you if you are expecting to reach the Plane of Time in the near future.  We are not the guild for you if you are just biding your time and working on levels and AA's until you can qualify for a hardcore raiding guild.  We are not "Epics R Us".  If you want to get your epic at some point, expect that you will be waiting for a while, probably 2 to 3 months or more, after you are admitted to the guild.  If you want help from us, you have to give us help in return.
<P>
While we are a family guild, our raids will become more businesslike.  We are going to discourage a lot of chatter during raids.  We will be a lot more strict about raid discipline, listening to assist calls, using the proper chat channels, following directions, being late for a raid, and going AFK during the raid.  If you can't follow the directions given by the raid leader or fully concentrate on your job, you will be asked to leave the raid.  We will be regularly scheduling raids again in the coming weeks.  Please keep up with the message boards for more information about this.
<P>
Our minimum level for admission to the guild will be increasing in the near future. <b>(now increased to level 60)</b>  The exact level is still being debated by the officers.  If you are a current member and end up being below this level, you will be "grandfathered" in.  As of now, all alts in the guild need to be level 30 or up.  We will be regularly deguilding alts that are not being played and moving up in levels on a regular basis.  The alt level does not apply to designated bazaar mules.
<P>
We will begin requiring that all people who apply to Nomadic Knights have a real life age of 18 years or more.  Just as the minimum level above, if you are below this age limit, you will be "grandfathered" in.
<P>
We will not accept characters that are eBayed or otherwise purchased.  We only want people in this guild who have taken the time and effort to get to their levels on their own.  If we find that a current Knight is either selling their character or is an eBay purchase, they will be deguilded.
<P>
If you leave NK at some point, you have one chance to come back, and one chance only.  Your readmittance to NK is at the discretion of Mystykal and any officers she deems have the right to readmit former members.  If you leave NK and come back, you will be subject to the same probationary period as a new member and will lose any DKP earned.
<P>
Nomadic Knights will be moving to a DKP system of loot in the near future.  DKP stands for "dragon kill points", but you do not have to kill dragons to earn them. :)  As you attend raids, you will earn points for attendance.  These points can then be spent on items that drop during raids.
<P>
All points will be kept track of in the guild manager (alt-G to see it) and can only be earned on raids as declared by an officer.  When this system begins, members will be given some points to spend right away per the following system:
<P>
New Members in probation - 5 points
<br>
Current members of 6 months or less - 10 points
<br>
Current members of 6 months or more - 20 points
<P>
Further details of how this system works will be forthcoming as we hammer out the details.  Be patient as we implement this system.  We expect to have some wrinkles to iron out, but want to be as fair as possible.  Remember, this is a game, and we want to have fun!
<P>
Pharrah has agreed to join us as our Enchanter and Recruitment Officer.  She will be interviewing applicants, answering applications on the board, and watching over new members.  If you know someone who wants to become a member, please refer them to the website or Pharrah if she is online at the time.
<P>
Our charter, member rules, loot rules, and application instructions sections of the website will be changing in the next week.  <b>(Charter, member rules, application instructions have been updated, loot rules will be soon)</b>There will be a post on the message board and the main page of the site when these are completed.
<P>
If you have questions, please speak with an officer or post them on the message boards.  Thanks for reading.
