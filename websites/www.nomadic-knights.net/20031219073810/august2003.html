We did a pick up raid in Kael last night, and I just wanted to post a BIG congratulations to Bonecrow!  He received a Torn Enchanted Silk Robe and Torn Enchanted Silk Gloves since he was the only caster along for the raid.  When he does his turn ins, they will become <a href="http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=4968" target="_blank">Warlock's Robe</a> and <a href=http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=4666" target="_blank">Warlock's Gloves</a>.
<P>
Congratulations Bonecrow!
<P>
I'm also going to toot my own horn a bit here.  After hours and hours of picking up meats and plants all over Norrath, I finally got my baking skill to 231, and then was able to attempt and succeed at the <a href="http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=15981" target="_blank">Grandmaster Baker's Spoon</a>!  This was a big goal of mine, and I want to thank all the Knights who gave me bits and pieces they collected for me to cook so I could reach it!  Thanks Knights!

What a fun Sunday we had!
<P>
August 24, 2003 10:00 PST - a large group of Knights gathers in Iceclad at the request of their webmistress to help her complete her quest for the final Coldain Prayer Shawl.
<P>
We fought our way through five waves of giants and wolves to escort General Bragmur across the icy wastes.  Nobody died, and we all had a lot of fun!  
<P>

<P>

At the gnome village, we were blessed by a visit from a minion of Brell, who came to present me with the <a href="http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=11999" target="_blank">Blessed Coldain Prayer Shawl</a>.  What an exciting time!  Thanks Knights for helping me to complete this quest!  Thank you Sharrien for the picture, I was too excited to take any! :)
<P>
The giants and wolves gave us some equipment as well.  Congrats to Lafortee on receiving the <a href="http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=12307" target="_blank">Tracking Wolf Collar</a> and to Ragnoroc and Iendari who each received a <a href="http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=12003" target="_blank">Ice Forged Helmet</a>.
<P>
From the icy wastes of the Iceclad Ocean, we traveled to the Plane of Innovation with our collective eye upon the mechanical dragon, Xanamech Nezmirthafen.  To find the dragon, we had to escort Nitram Anizok through the junkyard that takes up much of the plane.
<P>
Keeping Nitram the gnome safe from harm was not an easy task, and we learned quite a bit about this quest as we worked through it.  This gnome, unlike many of his kindred in Ak'Anon, does not like it when we use our magic to run in the form of a wolf.  We also learned that even though we believe we are heros, our heroic magic that summons our comrades to the battlefield will not work within the Plane of Innovation.
<P>
Beasts made of metal and wire attacked us from every corner as we made our way carefully along the paths, clearing the way for our gnomish friend.  Eventually, we reached a dead end.  But, then the gnome opened a door, and we beheld the mechanical monstrosity that is known as Xanamech.
<P>

It was a long hard fight, but we were successful.  The dragon spewed forth oil and steam with the intent of harming us.  A few of us fell, but the rest held on until Xanamech was nothing more than a pile of twisted metal. 
<P>

<P>
This is just his head!  The rest of him is below.

<P>
The Xanamech's corpse held two pieces of excellent equipment, the <a href="http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=16478" target="_blank">Innovator's Ring</a> and <a href="http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=16477" target="_blank">Woven Shim Choker</a>.  Congratulations to Yaksong who received the ring, and Janika who received the choker.

<P>
Thanks Sharrien for the above picture!  
<P>
Everyone who fought received permission to go into the Factory to explore there.  A few even went right after the fight! Thanks Almric for the picture!
<P>

<P>
While we were wandering through the junkyard, Mystykal told me a story about how she and some Knights had come to that very place a few weeks before to destroy the Junk Beast.  She even gave me a picture!
<P>
<center><img src="pics/junkbeastcorpse.jpg"></center>
<P>
This happened on August 14, and they received some equipment from the Beast.  Moadin received the <a href="http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=16322" target="_blank">Junk Beast Power Source</a> for a quest, and Ozene received a <a href="http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=16311" target="_blank">Metal Flecked Wirespun Cape</a>.
<P>
Remember, if you have tales to share and pictures to show off, send me a message via email or in game.

<P>
On Sunday, August 17, we made a trip to Plane of Fear!
<P>
<center><img src="pics/pof1.jpg"></center>
<P>
We had a great turn out!  Thank you to Zuuz for taking these awesome pictures and for the witty captions!
<P>

<P>
Gruven and Ubgrog were expecting nasty mobs, but didn't count on nasty breath!  (Gruven hands the decrepit warder a Menthos)
<P>

<P>
Unusual amount of seafood for a zone without much water!
<P>
<center><img src="pics/pof4.jpg"></center>
<P>
Dang..that is one ugly bird!
<P>

<P>
Taking down the enraged golem for Nonox's epic!  Congrats to Nonox!
<P>
Overall, this was a very successful raid.  We did well on the break in to the zone and did not wipe.  It's a shame that most of the mobs we wanted to take down were not up.  Congrats to everyone who received gear!
