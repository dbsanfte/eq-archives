<b>Member Rules for Nomadic Knights</b>
<P>

As a general member, you will be expected to:
<br>
<ul>
<li><b>Check the message boards a minimum of once a week.</b>  It is recommended that you check more often, as you may find something is going on that you would want to attend. This is how we let people know about upcoming raids.  If you do not have member access to the message boards, please post in the appropriate section so it can be granted.
<li>
<b>If there are people online in your level range, group with guild members first.</b>  We understand that there are not always enough people online to group with, groups are already full, or you have friends that you would like to group with.  We encourage you to bring along your friends, but if you do not group within the guild, you are missing out on gaining valuable knowledge of other guild members, such as fighting technique and habits.  These become important as your character progresses in EverQuest and especially when you need to group with guild members for higher level drops.  If you are a soloing class, such as a druid or necromancer, you are not expected to group with the guild all the time, but it is recommended.
<li>

<b>If there is a raid in your level group and you are online, you will be expected to either attend the raid or give reason as to why you cannot.</b>  This is important so that you can get to know the other members of the guild and build teamwork within the guild. Raids will be arranged in accordance with policies set up by the raid officer.  We understand if you have limited time online and can't attend.  Just let an officer know.
<li>

<b>Be willing to assist guild members when possible.</b>  All members will want to get an item of importance to them at some point in playing the game, and they will need help.  If you see a post on the message board or discussion in game about plans for this and you are in the level range, please consider helping them out.  At the very least, be willing to apologize if you cannot help and wish them good luck.  If you need to request the assistance of the guild with a drop or quest, we recommend posting a 2-week notice on the guild message board so that people have time to see it and hopefully get more to attend and help out.  
<li>
<b>Honor the Nomadic Knights guild tag.</b>  We ask that members do not play in /anon mode.  You may play in /role mode if you wish.  Many druids, clerics, and wizards do this to avoid being spammed for ports or rezzes.
<li>
<b>If someone asks to join the guild, refer them to this website.</b>  All of our rules and instructions for application to the guild are here.  If you refer the person to our website, this avoids miscommunication and ensures that prospective members know what Nomadic Knights are all about.
</ul>
<P>

 
<b>Disciplinary Actions</b>
<P>
 When a complaint is received by the officers about a member of the guild, it will be reviewed by them. Upon this review, the officers will issue a one-time warning to the player in question regarding the action that lead to the complaint. Upon receiving this warning, the player will be placed on probation for a set period of time depending on the specific offense. If another offense occurs during the probationary period, the member will be disbanded from the guild at that time. 
<P>
Certain offenses, such as theft, will result in no warnings, but upon verification of the claim, the member will be removed from the guild.  In addition, any offense within the probationary period following an invitation into Nomadic Knights will result in removal from the guild.
 <P>

 
<b>Behavior Unbecoming of a Knight</b>
<P>

The following are examples of some of the things that Nomadic Knights will not tolerate. If you are unsure about any of these, please contact an officer in game or leave a post on the message board asking for clarification.
<ul>
<li><b>Whining</b> 

<li><b>Begging</b> (For money, items, ports, rezzes, etc.) Asking politely is one thing, demanding is another.  We believe that members should know the difference. 
<li>
<b>Excessive use of foul language in game or on the message board</b>
<li>
<b>Demanding donations for services rendered</b>  See the <a href="http://www.mindfork.com/nk/goodprac.html">good practices page</a> for clarification about this.
<li>
<b>Intentional bashing or flaming guild members in game or in any other way</b> 
<li>
<b>Intentional training of mobs onto other players</b> 
<li>
<b>Ninja looting</b> 
<li>
<b>Camp Stealing</b> Camp stealing can include traditional camps and also when groups claim multiple camps. Speak to the people who have the camp you want and see if a compromise can be reached.  Do not jump in and take what you want.
<li>

<b>Playing using the Anonymous mode</b>  We require the guild tag be shown, therefore Role playing is allowed and Anonymous is not. 
<li>
<b>Lack of participation in the guild.</b>  If real life requires you to take extended time away from the game, please let us know so we don't just think you don't want to participate in the guild.  Stay up to date with what is happening by checking the message boards.


</ul>
<P>
<b>Our Views on Powerleveling and Twinking</b>

<P>
Powerleveling is defined as helping a character gain experience and levels faster than what would usually be the norm. Twinking is defined as giving a character better equipment than what they should have at that level. If you wish to do these on your own with your own resources, that is your decision.  However, begging for powerleveling help and equipment for yourself or your alts from the guild is NOT acceptable behavior.  Nomadic Knights has never and will never dedicate full guild efforts to powerleveling or twinking.
<P>
