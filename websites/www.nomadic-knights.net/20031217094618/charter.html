<b>Our Guild Charter</b>
<P>
The Nomadic Knights are a guild of friendship and family who aim to promote fair play and honor throughout the world of Norrath. We will accept travelers of Norrath or Luclin who have achieved the rank of 60 seasons or more.  
<P>
We want to build a solid group of people who enjoy each others company while playing EQ.  If you are looking for a place to hang out while you finish levels and AA's to join a more "uber" guild, then Nomadic Knights is not for you.  We are also not the guild for you if you expect to see the Plane of Time in the near future.  Nomadic Knights is also not "Epics R Us".  If you want to get your epic, expect to wait 2-3 months or more from the time you are admitted to receive any raid level assistance with it.
<P>
We love to help our members, but we expect their help and commitment in return.
<P>
Nomadic Knights raids 2-3 times a week to various zones.  We have members from all regions of the globe, and find that diversity refreshing.
