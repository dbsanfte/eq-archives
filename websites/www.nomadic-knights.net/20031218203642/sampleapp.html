<li>I am over 18 years old.
<li>Pacific time zone
<li>Karisun, lvl 63, 29 AA, Druid
<li>My magelo is <a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=475087" target="_blank">here</a>
<li>I am somewhere between casual and hardcore.  I don't grind out levels fast, but I do spent a lot of time on EQ hanging out.
<li>This is the only guild I've been in.
<li>I was referred a long time ago by a friend who has since left the world of Norrath.
<li>I try to contribute fun and humor in guild chat, my help when I can, and just a general good attitude.
<li>My proudest in-game accomplishments were the completion of my Blessed Coldain Prayer Shawl and my epic.
<li>I play because its fun.  I like the people I've met and consider them to be friends.
<li>My next goal in EQ is to get my smithing skill up and continue to work on AA and level 65.  I have no larger goal in mind besides having fun.
