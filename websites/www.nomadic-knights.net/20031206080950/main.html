Congratulations to Atini who recently completed her quest for the Blessed Coldain Prayer Shawl!

Here she is talking with a representative sent straight from Brell himself just before she received the shawl.

Sunday, bloody Sunday.
<P>
We headed out from the Plane of Knowledge with high hopes for slaughtering some dragons in the Halls of Testing.  However, when we arrived, we found that another guild was already there making big piles of dragon corpses.  So, we regrouped in PoK, and then headed to the Akheva Ruins with hopes of killing Itraer Vius.
<P>

<P>
Yes, she is a spooky devil, isn't she?  It was very dark and creepy in the ruins, but we bravely marched forward to do battle.
<P>
Unfortunately, we were bested by her guards.  We regrouped and got everyone buffed up again, then headed in to try once more.
<P>
We were a bit short on healing power, and Itraer Vius proved that blindness is a spooky girl's best friend.  We fell again unfortunately.
<P>
But, we have learned a lot from the experience.  We will train some more, scribe new spells into our spell books, recruit more healing power, and try again until we succeed.  Some big spooky lady in a bathrobe is no match for us once we set our minds to it!  A big bad giant named Derakor the Vindicator used to laugh at us... he doesn't laugh any more.  Itraer Vius will fall just as he did.
<P>
See you in Norrath folks!  Look for me at the North Ro adventurers camp doing jobs for them until I get the Remove Greater Curse spell.

*yawn* Oh, hello!  I've been a sleepy halfling lately, and haven't been doing my job, which is keeping you informed about what the Knights are up to.  Too much time spent at the brew barrel and "sampling" my results I suppose.  Anyhow, here's what's been going on (that I can remember! boy, those "samples" were potent!).
<P>
Lets start on a fun note!  On Thursday, there must have been something in the water, because beastlords suddenly had huge mutant pets!
<P>

Nobody was shrunk or grown by magical means for this picture, including the tiger!  Things were back to normal on Friday.
<P>
Congratulations to Xdro and Ozene who both completed their <a href="http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=11999" target="_blank">Blessed Coldain Prayer Shawl</a> recently!  This is a huge accomplishment and you should be very proud of yourselves!
<P>
*yawn* Hmm... what else....  *munches cookie*
<P>
We've done some small raids into Plane of Storms to complete BoT keys.  We went into The Hole to find a drop for Chubelle, but were unsuccessful since those tricky Erudites in Paineel decided to move everybody around.  Lots and lots of us have been successfully conquering the Lost Dungeons and receiving rewards and lots of loot.
<P>
Oh yes!  The guild's two biggest love birds finally got hitched!  Congratulations to Gruven and Starzz J'Kizz on their marriage!
<P>
I put out a trap of ale and some Halas Meat Pies, and caught myself a Barbarian!  Grimwolfe and I have decided we should team up together, and we have changed our names to reflect our commitment to being partners in crime.  We are now Grimwolfe and Karisun Shadowdancer.  So, if you find your pocket empty of your plat, but somehow full of cookie crumbs, you know that we've been there. :)
<P>
We have three raids coming up next week.  Check the magical Message of the Day while in Norrath to see what's going on.  I'll be there with my camera, as long as I don't fall asleep.
<P>
*yawn* Back to the hobbit hole for me.  Come visit me in Rivervale if you happen to be in town.  Bring the ale and I'll supply the cookies.
