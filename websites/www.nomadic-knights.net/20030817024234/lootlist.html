<b>How a Loot List Works</b> - by Erki - taken from the message boards
<P>
Note: We use loot lists when armor farming in Kael and HoT.
<P>
Loot lists are composed by level and armor type; silk, chain, leather, or plate.
<P>
Example: On the raid are 4 people who can use a silk drop.
<P>
Antony lvl 63 chanter<br>
Benjamin lvl 59 wizard<br>
Cristina lvl 56 magician<br>
Daniel lvl 51 Necromancer<br>
<P>
Silk gloves drop.<br>
Raid leader asks Antony if he wants them, Antony passes.<br>
Raid leader asks Benjamin and he takes them and moves to the bottom of the list.<br>
<P>
Later, silk arms drop.<br>
Raid leader asks Antony if he wants them, Antony passes.<br>
Raid leader asks Christina if she wants them since Benjamin got the gloves and therefore went to the bottom of the list. Christina takes them.<br>
<P>
For the next silk drop the list is:<br>
Antony<br>
Daniel<br>
Benjamin<br>
Christina<br>
<P>
All chest items will be god loot as well as drops from Vindi if we should dare to attack him.
