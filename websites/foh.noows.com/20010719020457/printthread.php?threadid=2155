<p><b> After Two LONG Months.... Temple of Veeshan defeated..</b></p>

<p>After two months of battle, we finally managed to take down the ruler of the Claws of Veeshan, Vulak'Aerr. Congratulations to FoH and Cestus Dei for putting in so much time and effort to see this goal realized. <br />
<br />
The actual fight with this beast lasted over 14 mins and took an INCREDIBLE force to complete. Don't ask me what that means, just know that the amount of firepower we dumped in him would have killed Statue of Zek four times over....<br />
<br />
Anyhow, here's the lewtz...<br />

<p>How come those arms are better than most of the nicer mellee type BPs, and they are for CASTERS?<br />
<br />
And, that is 1 one hell of a lucky Rogue.  Who has enough of Furors love to be the one to loot that thing?<br />
<br />
Oh, wait, can Furor actually love someone?  I doubt that =P<font face="verdana, arial, helvetica" size="2" ><br>

<p>I love that screen where Furor calls for offensive disc and Dregor pops /disc resistant. =)<br />
<br />
That was a friggin long fight. I died in HoT and waited around a few minutes for a res, got ressed back in and buffed up and was sitting there, only to realize you were still fighting the same mob hehe.<br />
<br />
Does the upgraded ToV loot make north hall a little easier? Or just the learning experience from previous fights?</p>
