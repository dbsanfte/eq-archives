Phoenix Risen and <i>The Order of Illuminati</i> joined forces in a ceremony
that was held at the Lake Rathe Arena.&nbsp; Many new members were welcomed into
the ranks, including some new officers whose titles will be announced here
shortly.</b></font></p>

Recruiting Freeze and New Recruiting Requirements</i></b></font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Garamond" size="4"><b>Due to the sudden increase in
membership, a temporary recruiting freeze has been enacted.&nbsp; In addition,
some new recruitment requirements have been put into place for new members
only.&nbsp; This freeze does not affect 2nd generation characters for current
members.</b></font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Garamond" size="4"><b>PR will continue to bring in
additional Illuminati members over the next two weeks, therefore, we will be
unable to determine our current membership size until everyone who will be
joining us has completed the change over.&nbsp; Once we have determined what our
current population is and our new members have had a chance to settle in, we
will reopen recruiting following the new guidelines set up by our Guild Leader, <i>Sir
Lage Holyblaze</i>, and the Executive Staff.</b></font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Garamond" size="4"><b>The new requirements for
recruiting are posted on our Recruitment page; you can read them by clicking <a href="join.htm">here</a>.&nbsp;
