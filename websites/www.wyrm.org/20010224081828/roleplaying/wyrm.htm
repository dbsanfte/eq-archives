Monster.&nbsp; We exist on all worlds in some form, we are a Constant in the equation of
Reality.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Some people's realities include us as monsters who's appetite,
greed and viciousness is only matched by it's cunning and power. &nbsp; Others have us as
spirits of Wisdom and Magic.&nbsp; The<img src="../images/sdrag4.gif"
alt="sdrag4.gif (120704 bytes)" align="right" width="206" height="476"> Wyrm symbolizes Power, Wisdom and Wealth to
many peoples.&nbsp; We are symbols of royalty, and of savage intellegence and calculating,
destructive violence.&nbsp; Immortal, yet able to perish at the hands of mortal men, We
are Paradox.&nbsp; We live and watch the world of mortals change around us, wilst we
remain, like a standing stone around which sheep graze.</font></p>

<p align="center"><font color="#000000" face="Viner Hand ITC" size="4">We move amongst
you, often unseen, undetected,&nbsp; and unnoticed, for we are never what you think we
should be.&nbsp; </font></p>

Mortals.&nbsp; </font></p>

you must first submit yourself to the inspection of the master of the rookery - to enter
without joining with us is fine, but you will never know power within the Conclave if you
do not submit yourself to the sensitives of the Conclave - we want no enemies amongst us,
and it is within our power to deny you.</font></p>

<p align="center"><font color="#000000" face="Viner Hand ITC" size="4">The symbol of the
Egg is one of birth and rebirth, new beginnings.&nbsp; Touch it, Seeker, if you wish to
pass unchallenged within the Aerie of the Conclave.</font></p>
