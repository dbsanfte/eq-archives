<p>This city is in the trees, 40 ft minimum.&nbsp; Platforms marked with the rounded
pattern are 60 ft up.&nbsp; Platforms marked with the cross hatch are 100 feet up. &nbsp;
Don't fall.&nbsp; Don't jump.&nbsp; Razorleaf elves are not responsible for broken bones
or other injuries incurred by idiocy.</p>

<p>Razorleaf was settled several hundred years ago by elves rejected by their communities.
&nbsp; Mixed lineage, runaway lovers from disapproving families, deformities, strange
magic, crazy ideas, all can be found in Razorleaf.</p>

<p>The Lift Tree is where everyone arrives who is NOT a member of the community. &nbsp;
Coming up some other way if you are not a Razorleaf Elf is not recommended. &nbsp; See
above for advice on going down without the Lift.&nbsp; There are several small guard
stations on the lift and a few buildings that are possibly temporary dwellings, but no
real merchant areas.</p>

<p align="center"><em>Warning!&nbsp; some of the below is RUMOR ONLY.&nbsp; Act upon what
you see below at your own risk!!!</em></p>

<ol>
  <li><strong><big>The Wolf Platform</big></strong> - when some of the Wolfsoldiers are in
    town, this is where you will find their wolves relaxing.&nbsp; Sometimes, this is where
    you will find the wolfsoldiers themselves relaxing.</li>
  <li><strong><big>The Loitering Platform</big></strong> and the <strong><big>Firefox Tavern</big></strong>
    - Loitering and buying food and drink, mostly quick things you can cram in your head as
    you walk, is encouraged on this platform. &nbsp; There's always a crowd here.&nbsp; It is
    one of the places strangers are most often found.&nbsp; </li>
  <li><strong><big>Woodshaper's platform</big></strong>. One building is for storage of woods,
    one is for the Woodshaper's dwelling.</li>
  <li>A ramp up leads to this platform - the Runners Rest is here, a gathering place for
    Rangers.&nbsp; All who can prove they are of the Ranger class or a near class to it may
    stay here for free and eat and drink freely here as well.&nbsp; Their guests must pay.
    &nbsp; A woman named Treefell is the head of the Runner's Rest.</li>
  <li>You have to climb a ladder to get to this platform.&nbsp; <strong><big>The EagleAerie</big></strong>
    is here - only Eagle riders or Flying Elves are welcome up here - do not even bother to
    try to socialize up here if you have to climb up.&nbsp; The ladder is for relatives and
    people getting DOWN mostly.&nbsp; The other elves consider them a snotty bunch.</li>
  <li><strong><big>Trader Tree</big></strong> - Unofficial trading goes on here.&nbsp; You can
    find meat, untanned hides, cookies, herbs and vegetables, never in huge quantities, all
    traded here by private citizens looking to get something for their surplus stuff.</li>
  <li>A ramp up leads to this platform, and the <strong><big>Healer's Hall</big></strong>.&nbsp;
    Just a collection of tents clinging to the sides of the tree that holds up the platform,
    This area has sick and injured elves and animals sheltered within.&nbsp; the Healer is
    Comfrey, a very tall and pretty grey elf that has that androgyny thing going on and is
    PROBABLY a man if you go by muscularity, and his(?) assistant, Bumblebee, a short, cute
    male elf who looks more like a child who would like to be stealing candy than a healer.</li>
  <li>the Ramps leading too and from this platform are very steep.&nbsp; This is <strong><big>Lookout
    Point</big></strong> and there are several elves gathered here talking, usually about
    what's going on in the forest and such... you can see most of the treetops from here and
    apparently, they watch for signs of smoke from this tree.&nbsp; A forest fire can be
    devestating to a tree city.</li>
  <li><strong><big>The Fountains</big></strong> - There is a bathhouse here called the
    Fountains, and a house near it with no name where people can stay.&nbsp; It is run by an
    elf with pale ivory skin with a definate greenish cast to it.&nbsp; His name is
    Merrow.&nbsp; Anyone with a need for frequet baths or immersion in water is advised to
    stay in Merrow's inn.</li>
  <li>(hard to see this number, it is near 19, which is on the same platform.) <strong><big>the
    Baneful Flower</big></strong> is a poisoner and apothocary.&nbsp; It is run by a female
    elf with skin as pale as a white pearl, and hair the color of a raven's wing.&nbsp; She
    has eyes of a pale yellow green.&nbsp; Her name is Antimony and she sells poisons, drugs,
    and heavy metals that are all useful to magic users, healers and assasins.</li>
  <li><strong><big>Feathered Death</big></strong> - the Archers guild.&nbsp; Run by a cold,
    bitter looking elven man named Riptide, who is freind to Merrow and apparently adventured
    with him.&nbsp; Riptide is very, very obviously halfdrow, his skin is dark but not black,
    his eyes are a bright, wicked red, his pale silvery grey hair is butched short in front
    and while quite long in back, pulled severely back in a tight braid.&nbsp; He deals very
    poorly with pureblooded elves of the Grey and Drow type and everyone who is of those
    bloods is warned by people standing around not to go in and get lippy with Riptide.&nbsp;
    However, his bows are fantastic and he can make any kind of bow or arrow you want or
    need.&nbsp; His specialty are trick arrows such as wood and stone biters, frog crotch
    arrows, whistlers and filled arrowheads made to shatter on impact.&nbsp; He will usually
    warm up to archers, regardless of race, and halfblood drow are well known to get excellent
    prices if they are obvious about their mixed blood.</li>
  <li><big><strong>Baker's Pleasure</strong></big> - a bakery.&nbsp; Run by what looks like it
    might be half-halfling half elf.&nbsp; Short, very plump for an elf, Brenda Baker is a
    buxom blond with a sugary giggle.&nbsp; Specialty of the Day - every day, btw - is what
    she calls moonbread, a frosted yeast raised pastry that melts in your mouth and is vaugely
    reminisent of a crossant.&nbsp; She also sells regular raised breads and muffins.&nbsp;
    You can by lembas wafers here as well.</li>
  <li><strong><big>Ironhold Smithy</big></strong> - Hammer Ironhold and his freind Jax
    Ironhold run this smithy. &nbsp; While they can and do make weapons such as knives and
    arrowheads, swords are not really their cup of tea.&nbsp; there are usually 2 guards
    standing look out as well - not only because this is one of the outermost trees, but
    because there is a firedanger here like no other platform.</li>
  <li><big>Houses</big> - this is a residntial platform.&nbsp; Kids play here with their pets,
    women and men gather and do some of the daily work that an elven household requires, etc.
    &nbsp; Nothing of special note.</li>
  <li><strong><big>Merchant Row</big></strong> - this is where the Fairs are held every full
    moon.&nbsp; The large building is the Merchant's Guildhall, where offical members of the
    Elven Merchants can check in, get maps, store very precious cargo, and possibly find
    lodging.&nbsp; The smaller buildings, the yellow ones are cottages of people who happen to
    live on the platform.&nbsp; the other smaller building is the Capsized Turtle, a
    tavern.&nbsp; the sign is of a turtle, sitting naked on its overturned shell, which is in
    the water, and it is apparently rowing it like a boat with a little oar.&nbsp; It is a
    loud and boisterous place and it sells just about any alchoholic beverage you can
    imagine.&nbsp; it also is usually watched carefully by up to as many as 12 guards at any
    given time.</li>
  <li><strong><big>the Skyveiw Inn</big></strong> - steep ramp up to this platform, and this
    place is usually empty, it is expensive and worth every penny.&nbsp; Stay as a guest here
    and you will be treated like royalty.&nbsp; The Proprietor is Tercel Skyveiw, who is
    rarely seen.&nbsp; Usually you are just waited on by the HUMAN staff - another reason a
    lot of people do not like the place.</li>
  <li><strong><big>Fartravel Maps and Lore</big></strong> - Elkrun Fartravel is considered a
    Sage by the people of Razorleaf.&nbsp; He does NOT like to be disturbed and if you go
    there, you better know exactly what you want.&nbsp; he does not chat.&nbsp; and he is not
    cheap.&nbsp; He is a freind to Skyveiw.</li>
  <li><strong><big>the Smoking Hare</big></strong> - a rabbit with a halfling style pipeweed
    pipe is on the sign of this place.&nbsp; This is a mixture of resteraunt, inn and dining
    hall.&nbsp; apparently many people in town use this place as their sole source of food and
    drink, and it is very popular and quite large.&nbsp; Hare, a tall elven man of no clear
    elven line (and he does smoke occasionally) is usually with a crowd of elves, laughing and
    telling tall tales. &nbsp; His hired help often include townsfolk who have no money for
    food, so there'sa big turn over.&nbsp; His cook is a creature that looks vaugely elvish
    but is covered with fur and has a decidedly wolfish cast to it's features, no one's found
    a hair in their food yet so no one complains.&nbsp; The food here is quite a bit more
    hearty than at the other elvish inns, no delicate sauces and flavorful salads, you get
    meat and potatoes, bread and cheese and big servings of all of it.&nbsp; Its not cheap but
    it's good and a human or half orc can eat here and not keep waiting for the entre to
    arrive.</li>
  <li><strong><big>Witchwood</big></strong> - Witchwood sells magic.&nbsp; spells, books,
    inks, the occasional item. &nbsp; Witchwood is another of the androgyns and he/she/it does
    not give any clue as to his/her/it's gender.&nbsp; I will refer to it as a&nbsp; him for
    simplicity, but do not take that as it's gender.&nbsp; Witchwood is wrapped in a purple
    robe that covers his shape from prying eyes.&nbsp; his eyes match the robe almost
    perfectly.&nbsp; He has pale skin that looks like he's never been in the sun, and hair the
    color of spiderwebs, and about as wispy, which falls out from the robe occasionally in a
    long tumble - it must be longer than he is tall.&nbsp; And he is tall, well over 6
    feet.&nbsp; Witchwood is feared by many of the Razorleaf inhabitants.</li>
