<ol>
  <li><p align="left">a covered bridge</p>
  </li>
  <li><p align="left">a large fountain with several tiers, the lowest is obviously set up for
    animals to drink from.</p>
  </li>
  <li><p align="left">Thatched farm houses and a smithy.&nbsp; There is a small well there
    where the buildings are clustered.</p>
  </li>
  <li><p align="left">The Dragongate Inn.&nbsp; A very large building set up to recieve a
    large number of patrons.&nbsp; There are 2 bars, one in the north, quite large, and one in
    the south, much smaller and less boisterous generally.&nbsp; The southernmost bar is for
    private talk, quiet dinners and private drinking.&nbsp; If you drink in the northernmost
    bar, you can expect freindly beings of all race and creed to pester you, including the
    help.</p>
  </li>
  <li><p align="left">A large Barn - mostly storage and a few chickens run around ruling the
    place.</p>
  </li>
  <li><p align="left">A large and well equipped stable with special paddocks for 'special'
    mounts.&nbsp; Clay flooring and stone walls provide strength and durability for those
    who's mounts are a little beyond the norm.&nbsp; </p>
  </li>
  <li><p align="left">Shipping Warehouse and cottages for the workers at the docks, as well as
    a couple of cottages owned by captains who regularly dock here.</p>
  </li>
  <li><p align="left">Dragongate Lighthouse and the Guardhouse for the docks.</p>
  </li>
  <li><p align="left">The docks and harbormaster's office and dwelling.&nbsp; Also sells bait!</p>
  </li>
  <li><p align="left"> A mirror pool - calm and pretty, usually surrounded with tiny birds and
    timid animals who drink here rather than at the river, for reasons known only to them.
    &nbsp; It is said to have healing properties by the locals, but is also said to be
    haunted.</p>
  </li>
  <li><p align="left">the Dragon Gate - this ancient ruin still functions.&nbsp; carved
    standing stones with fading depictions of dragons and extradimensional beasts surround an
    empty spot where nothing but some stubborn grass grows.&nbsp; The stones hum with power
    and give off a very faint light at night.&nbsp; Most of the natives of the area, while no
    longer afraid of the place, avoid it, as sometime 'things' come forth... which justifies
    the rather large population of adventurers given cheaper rates at the inn than merchants.</p>
  </li>
  <li><p align="left"> a ruined stronghold - occasionally, those who do not wish to be known
    to the townmembers take up residence here - tho it is not for very long, ever. The place
    is haunted by somethng, and it is not just a rumor.&nbsp; Whatever it is is tolerant of
    short term visitors, but long term guests at the ruins are destined to be found like all
    the others, which the locals will tell you is very unpleasant for the finder but&nbsp; not
    as unpleasant for the found, as they don't have to clean up the mess, being quite dead.</p>
