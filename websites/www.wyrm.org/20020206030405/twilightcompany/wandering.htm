  <p><font face="Tempus Sans ITC"><strong><big>Posted by Aylrin on 10-05-2001 01:00 PM: </big></strong></font></p>
  <p><font face="Tempus Sans ITC"><strong><big>&nbsp;</big></strong></font></p>
  <p><font face="Tempus Sans ITC"><strong><big>'Sometimes, I think it would be easier to
  just die.' <br>
  <br>
  Even as the thought crossed her mind, Aylrin dismissed it. She wasn't giving up. Sooner or
  later she would make the right turn and find her way back out of this hellhole. <br>
  <br>
  There was no way to know how long she'd been lost down here. Days, definitely. Weeks?
  Possibly. At the beginning, she'd wondered if the rest of the party had escaped, if they'd
  realize one of their members was missing and come looking for her. Anymore, she spent most
  of her time focused on the necessities: staying alive and out of sight. <br>
  <br>
  There was no real reason to expect the party would have missed her. It'd been another
  random grouping of adventurers, marching into the mines under Highkeep to kill some
  goblins and make some gold. A couple warriors to lay the heavy damage, a couple casters to
  provide protection and attack spells, a druid to patch up the wounded, and herself to back
  up the tanks and support the mages. They'd been doing well, and they got cocky. Went a
  little too deep into the mines, and when they realized they'd taken on more than they
  could handle, they'd also found their escape blocked. <br>
  <br>
  After that it had been pure bedlam. She couldn't remember when she'd lost the rest of
  them, and had no idea what twists and turns she'd made before finding a dark pocket of
  stone to hide in. Nor could she remember how long she'd stayed there, huddled in a tight
  ball, playing the whisper-soft song of invisibility. Eventually, though, the blind panic
  had faded, and discomfort had overcome fear. Still playing her flute to stay unseen (and
  thank Karana she always took her instruments into battle), Aylrin had gone looking for a
  way out. <br>
  <br>
  She'd never been able to find it, and the search for escape eventually took second place
  to the search for food. Now her life had narrowed to a few simple imperatives. Remain
  hidden or invisible at all times. Avoid casters who might see through her bardsong. Steal
  or scavenge food and water. And if there's a chance, find a way back to the surface. <br>
  <br>
  Those chances were less and less of late, especially since the goblins were starting to
  get suspicious about the ghost in their midst. Patrols were increasing, even deep in their
  own lair, and usually included at least one magician. The bard wasn't sure how much longer
  she could keep up this game. She wasn't sure how much longer she wanted to. <br>
  <br>
  Stretching the kinks out of her back, wincing at the bruises from sleeping on rough stone,
  she considered her options. She'd managed to raid a storeroom earlier, food and water
  wouldn't be a problem for a little while. Before she'd fallen asleep, she'd noticed a
  patrol milling around what looked like a solid stone wall. If she stretched far enough to
  see out of her current hideyhole, she could see the place. <br>
  <br>
  There were no guards there now. <br>
  <br>
  She allowed herself a slight smile. Quickly and quietly, she made her preparations. Just
  why she'd started drawing the runes she couldn't say. She was no wizard, the magic of
  those symbols was a mystery to her. But she did it anyway, tracing them from memory of the
  runes she'd seen and imagination of what those she hadn't might look like. Protection.
  Invisibility. Strength. Good Fortune. When they were done, she simply stared at them, dark
  against her skin, then brushed one hand over them, humming softly. The runes disappeared
  into her skin, becoming part of her. She hoped. <br>
  <br>
  She traded the drawing tool in her hand for the flute in her pack and began to play. Once
  she was sure the illusion was in place, she crawled out of the hole and examined the wall.
  And found a passage, narrow and winding and dark, and almost completely obscured by piles
  of broken stone on either end. She didn't recognize it, but it was something new,
  something different. Without hesitation she crossed the passage and followed the path on
  the other side. <br>
  <br>
  It was a tricky journey. Some sections of the path seemed almost abandoned, while others
  were centers of activity. Those she skirted through carefully; invisibile did not mean
  intangible. But the further she went, the fewer of these active pockets she found. Empty
  rooms occationally opened onto the path, and other byways to explore. The sparce
  population made sneaking around easier, and sleeping a little more secure, but those
  benefits were trade-offs for a lack of food sources. She had yet to find a single storage
  facility, and foraging was difficult. A rune for sustenance joined those she drew every
  time she dared to sleep and every time she moved on. <br>
  <br>
  She'd just finished erasing the runes and was wiggling out of the crevise she'd nested in
  when she heard them. Carefully, so very carefully, she moved to where she could see the
  room, counting four goblins growling and shrieking at each other. Oh, how she wished she
  could make sense of their words! She had no way to know if they were a standard patrol or
  following her, if they were arguing about something important or discussing the merits of
  red wine or white with fish. What she DID know is that they were between her and the
  doorway, and they moved around too much to risk sneaking past them. <br>
  <br>
  So she watched and waited. Eventually they settled whatever discussion they were having.
  Three left, while the fourth - probably the youngest, if size made any difference -
  settled himself in a corner with a clear view of the door. A guard. That was all right.
  She could sneak past a single gaurd. <br>
  <br>
  She waited several minutes, then pulled out her flute and began the whisper-soft song
  again. This was always the hardest part, the most dangerous. If the guard pinpointed the
  sound before the spell took it from his mind, she was done for. But the goblin didn't seem
  to hear a thing, and only blinked once, owlishly as the illusion took hold. Practice, and
  lots of it, kept her from smiling - tightening the lips would change the wind pressure
  into the flute, and possibly unmake the song. Slowly, carefully, she slipped from her
  hiding spot and headed for the hall. <br>
  <br>
  And the goblin started shouting. <br>
  <br>
  For a moment she stared at the creature, too shocked to move, and then realized her
  mistake. The guard, young or not, was a spellcaster. And apparently one with the ability
  to see through invisibility spells. And it wasn't just shouting; its hand were moving,
  ready to cast... <br>
  <br>
  She didn't pause to think. The flute dropped from her mouth as she gave one piercing
  udulation - a twisted blend of a shriek and a bellow, two attack songs twisted into a
  single sound of pain. It was enough to make the caster flinch, lose the concentration on
  the spell. The next instant she was in the passage and running for her life, praying with
  every breath that the noise had not been heard and the other goblins had gone the other
  way...</big></strong></font></p>

  <p><font face="Tempus Sans ITC"><strong><big>Posted by Valius on 10-09-2001 04:22 AM: </big></strong></font></p>
  <p><font face="Tempus Sans ITC"><strong><big>&nbsp;</big></strong></font></p>
  <p><font face="Tempus Sans ITC"><strong><big>Valius wiped the sweat from his brow with the
  back of a gloved hand and hefted the crystal-bladed greatsword once more. He wasn't very
  good with it yet, which is why he had stayed down in the depths of Highkeep after the
  others he'd hunted with had left, doing a bit of practice on the goblins that other
  parties had found. The adventuring folk were gracious enough, which was more than he could
  say for the guards; those fellows looked askance at him, probably recognizing the aura of
  a holy warrior. As far as he'd heard, they had ties to the corrupt Freeport Militia at the
  very least, so their hostility was no surprise. <br>
  <br>
  The underground was under adventurer control as usual as teams worked to root out the
  pockets of pickclaw goblins that infested the tunnels below the Keep. It was locked down
  fairly well at the moment, with a pack of seasoned mercenaries guarding the lower entrance
  while the younger ones dispatched those crazed creatures that slipped through the minor
  passages to make their assault. So it was that Valius and the others of the younger party
  were surprised to hear shouts for assistance from down below. <br>
  <br>
  Valius, startled as any, stowed his two-hander quickly to bring out his more familiar
  shield and the Ghoulbane his beloved Lexa had given him. The younger party he had been
  practicing with hesitated, whispering among themselves as they eyed the lower passages;
  everyone knew that the mercenary bands were the only things keeping the stronger goblins
  from destroying Highkeep, as the guards were hardly the best-trained. That only barely
  registered to the paladin. With Karana's strength, after all, everything would be well.
  And there were people who needed rescue. <br>
  <br>
  Voicing a battle cry, he sped down the tunnels toward the fray. The passages that far were
  blessedly clear; it was only deeper that the chaos began. The path narrowed, choked with
  goblins and adventurers, barbarians standing shoulder to shoulder with Teir'Dal. At
  another time he might have felt the need to comment. <br>
  <br>
  In the midst of the fighting, deep among the mass of goblins, was a single figure flailing
  about and screaming, colored light dancing around her in a way that only bards could
  evoke. Valius edged closer; she looked young, a wood elf from the build and bleeding,
  staggering as she struck out with a skull-headed staff and whip which barely had room to
  swing. The elder adventurers were preoccupied with keeping themselves alive, some probably
  never even having seen her, and it was apparent she would not last long in the crush. <br>
  <br>
  Well, he thought, swords and shields aren't much use when you can't reach the enemy to
  strike. He sheathed his blade and, keeping his eyes on the maddened youngster, cast out a
  silent prayer to his god. Somewhere over the plainsland, a storm raged. Somewhere near. As
  healing energy rushed through him, bright and sharp as lightning, he felt the old sorrow
  of the cleric's guild slamming its doors in a half-breed's face. <br>
  <br>
  Life flowed into the young bard, and her struggles grew stronger. A goblin raised its
  hands in strange gestures though and a choking fog of acid filled the close tunnel; Valius
  raised his shield to protect himself as it rolled closer and dissipated. Again and again
  he sent out his prayer, but he was ill-trained to heal and the goblins were falling too
  slowly. <br>
  <br>
  &quot;Back up!&quot; he shouted at last, voice and nerves raw from channeling the god's
  power. <br>
  <br>
  The others must have heard, for they inched back up toward the surface, taking their
  opponents with them. Ducked behind the shield again, Valius pressed himself against the
  wall to scrape by; the girl did not seem to have heard and was still fighting with two
  burly goblins and a diminutive caster that hid behind them. She sagged even as he forced
  his way in, battered to exhaustion by the blows, and he whispered a last prayer to his god
  as he stepped over her to ward off a killing strike, half crouched to brush her with his
  fingertips. A little electric spark jumped between them, and the bard gasped as her wounds
  sealed entirely. She scrambled to her feet as he drew his blade, struggling to keep the
  goblins at bay. <br>
  <br>
  &quot;Run!&quot; he shouted. Again, she did not seem to hear and went back to beating on a
  goblin and shrieking her warsong. He took a few slashes at the other burly one and knew
  quickly that he was in over his head. Summoning the power again, he chanted and the ground
  beneath his opponent flashed to liquid then solid, encasing the creature's feet. It
  shrieked and clawed after him as he backed away and did it to the other, then tried to
  hook the bard around the waist and haul her away. <br>
  <br>
  She half-turned and walloped him over the head with her staff, only bared teeth visible
  within the helm. The cacaphonous songs made his skin sizzle under his armor. Crazy, he
  thought, absolutely mad. <br>
  <br>
  Quite calmly, he let her go and whacked her hard in the helm with his shield. He was glad
  to see that it stunned madwomen quite as well as it stunned monsters. <br>
  <br>
  Back in the sheath went the sword, and he swept her over his shoulder, thanking all the
  gods that she was a woodelf and not some massive barbarian damsel-in-distress. The goblins
  thrashed and snarled behind him, and their little compatriot started chanting in its
  twisted language. A concentrated burst of power stopped the creature in mid-cast, and
  Valius wasted no time in turning tail and running like all the legions of hell were after
  him. The girl shook off the daze and started struggling, and he just reached back and
  slammed his fist on her helm. Again, she quieted. <br>
  <br>
  So much for valiant rescue, he thought as he scrambled up the path, up and up to where the
  mercenaries were resting after finishing off the other goblins, and up further into the
  keep. He appropriated one of the empty rooms that festooned the keep and flopped the girl
  down on the narrow bed before sagging down the wall himself. His head hurt like nothing
  else, teeth aching with the feeling of being struck by lightning himself. Karana certainly
  wasn't delicate about lending a hand. <br>
  <br>
  When the girl didn't stir for a little, Valius moved to her bedside, worried he might have
  hit a bit too hard. He worked the steel helm off gently, then just stopped and stared at
  the revealed face. <br>

  <p><font face="Tempus Sans ITC"><strong><big>Posted by Aylrin on 10-11-2001 06:59 PM: </big></strong></font></p>
  <p><font face="Tempus Sans ITC"><strong><big>&nbsp;</big></strong></font></p>
  <p><font face="Tempus Sans ITC"><strong><big>Disorientation and a sense of wrongness were
  the first things to impress themselves upon her, and Aylrin struggled towards
  conciousness. It was too light, she realized, too open. The goblins would find her! She
  ground her teeth against the headache-induced groan and forced herself upright. She had to
  find a place to hide... <br>
  <br>
  And then she realized she was not alone. <br>
  <br>
  One hand reached automatically for her lariat, but it was gone, as was the rest of her
  equipment. Captured! She inhaled sharply; no bard past their second season was ever
  weaponless. But before she could voice her attack, a hand grabbed her, and with it came
  power, warm and soothing as a summer rain. Karana's power, comforting body and soul. <br>
  <br>
  Shock and that power kept her still, allowed her to note the things she had not in her
  panic. Built stone walls surrounded her instead of dirt tunnels, and she lay on a bed
  instead of a rocky floor. The person holding her arm, murmurring soothing words, was no
  goblin. Was, in fact, familiar. &quot;V... Valius?&quot; <br>
  <br>
  The paladin gave her a small, subdued smile. &quot;This mean you're not going to hit me
  again?&quot; <br>
  <br>
  Confused, she shook her head, unconciously curling into herself as she tried to make sense
  of what happened. The little spellcaster had seen her, she remembered that, and running
  for her life. And then the fighting, a mass of flailing limbs and pain, too many for her
  to handle, each too strong for her to take, but she couldn't give up, absolutely would
  not. And then Karana's power had touched her, strengthening limbs, healing wounds, and
  she'd been in a frenzy when something had grabbed her. <br>
  <br>
  An embarrassed flush tinged her cheeks. &quot;It was you, in that fight. I'm sorry. I
  didn't... I thought...&quot; she buried her face against her knees until she could control
  herself. &quot;I'm sorry.&quot; <br>
  <br>
  &quot;Under the circumstances, I think it's excuseable.&quot; Val'd had time while she was
  unconcious to see the evidence of a long time spent lost: features hollowed by too little
  food of too poor quality, sickly-pale skin under encrusted grime. &quot;Aylrin, how long
  were you down there?&quot; <br>
  <br>
  &quot;I'm not sure. What day is it?&quot; He told her, and she shuddered. Over a month
  she'd spent skulking through those endless caverns. So much time lost. What had been going
  on? What had she missed in that time? <br>
  <br>
  Had anyone missed her? <br>
  <br>
  That last question she didn't voice, but Val spent a good deal of time answering the
  others. She heard about raids and hunts, old friends and new recruits. Val seemed
  grudgingly appreciative of a recent addition by the name of Geirk, if only for his
  apparent talent for harassing Furiel. The paladin never had liked the dark elf much,
  guildmate or no, and Furi's quick rise through the ranks didn't seem to help that any. <br>
  <br>
  The words he didn't say answered the question she didn't ask. No &quot;Everyone's been
  wondering where you were.&quot; No &quot;Agaeis got worried when we never heard from
  you.&quot; Most painful of all, no &quot;Furiel was asking about you.&quot; The rogue was
  her best friend! They traded messages on an almost constant basis. Hadn't he once wondered
  why she'd stopped? <br>
  <br>
  They were bitter thoughts, and unjustified, and a part of her knew it. But that part was
  buried deep by the pain. Lost for a month, unnoticed and unsearched. The thought made her
  unbearably weary, dragged at her spirit in ways her long isolation had been unable to. <br>
  <br>
  &quot;Val?&quot; she inturrupted. &quot;Do you think I might be able to get a bath?&quot;
  She examined her bony, fithly arms, and gave a self-depreciating laugh. &quot;And some
  decent food. With what there is to eat in those tunnels, no wonder the goblins are so
  ugly.&quot; <br>
  <br>
  Her smile was light and good-humored. Half of a bard's life was spent as a jester,
  entertaining others, and Aylrin was a master of the art. Val made the arraingements, and
  left her alone to bathe. She scrubbed repeatedly, until her skin felt raw and the water
  went cold, wondering if she'd ever get the feel of dirt off herself. Finally she wrapped
  herself in a long robe and dug through her piled things. Then she sat on the bed and
  pushed up the sleeve of the robe, staring at her arm for a long time. No, she realized,
  the arm wouldn't do for this. She opened the robe, baring her chest, and slowly began to
  draw new runes over her heart. Self-reliance. Independence. Distain. <br>
  <br>
  When they were done, she studied them for a long time, then vanished them as she'd done so
  often in the goblin tunnels. She carefully tucked the drawing tool back in her things and
  dressed, calmer now, and more certain. They didn't need her. She wouldn't need them.</big></strong></font></p>

  <p><font face="Tempus Sans ITC"><strong><big>Posted by Aylrin on 10-20-2001 05:07 AM: </big></strong></font></p>
  <p><font face="Tempus Sans ITC"><strong><big>&nbsp;</big></strong></font></p>
  <p><font face="Tempus Sans ITC"><strong><big>&quot;Thanks for the escort, Val. I really
  appreciate it.&quot; <br>
  <br>
  The paladin nodded absently, and Aylrin couldn't help but grin at the suspicious looks he
  gave anyone who wandered too close. Freeport did not have the best of reputations, and had
  earned in spades every whispered rumor about it, but that didn't bother the bard. She'd
  always been at her best among rogues. <br>
  <br>
  Valius's considering gaze focused on her eventually. &quot;Are you sure you're going to be
  all right here?&quot; The little wood elf certainly didn't look all right. Her skin was
  still a sickly pale, and her eyes squinted painfully in the desert sun, maladjusted after
  the long time underground. But her grin was as bright as ever. <br>
  <br>
  &quot;I'm sure. I'm going to take it easy, do some local hunting and polish up my skills a
  bit, and that's it.&quot; She was a little worried the assurances wouldn't sit well with
  the paladin, but Val'd never been one to doubt someone's word without reason. Even if the
  only reason was the person's race, or profession. Still, since she didn't fall into one of
  those &quot;automatic suspicion&quot; slots, he took her at her word. <br>
  <br>
  And she was as good as her word, or mostly so, for all of three days. So killing crocs in
  Oasis might not fall under local Freeport hunting. It was at least entertaining, and
  certainly helped to brush up her fighting skills. But it wasn't satisfying, even after her
  skin settled for tanning instead of burning and her eyes stopped watering by noon. The
  open dunes, while as drastically different as she could get from the entrapping tunnels as
  possible, were just as alien and unwelcoming. <br>
  <br>
  She wanted trees, tall and stately, with sunlight diffused to a soft green glow. Except
  there was no more welcome for her there than in this blasted desert. Still, she reasoned,
  there were the islands in the Ocean of Tears, and there was Butcherblock. Pleasant enough
  places, close enough to feel homelike, and little caring for Feir'Dal politics. Those
  might be worth more exploration. <br>
  <br>
  Passage aboard the Siren's Bane was easy enough to get, and she enjoyed the sea journey
  immensely. She always had. If anything could have seduced the young wood elf's heart away
  from her forests, it was the ocean. The soothing rolls of the boat eased deep-seated
  aches, and the salt-laden air refreshed the spirit like a rousing song. Aylrin had never
  understood the travelers who disembarked weary and grateful for the end of the journey.
  She always came off the boat more refreshed than she'd gotten on. <br>
  <br>
  Refreshed enough, in this case, that when she spotted an all-too-familiar figure on the
  docks in Butcherblock, she forgot bitterness and abandonment and scooped the halfling up
  in a hug. <br>
  <br>
  &quot;Papa Aggie!&quot; <br>
  <br>
  The druid's reaction careened quickly from shock to surprise to shock to joy, finally
  settling on that stern, worried disapproval that he turned so easily on the youngsters of
  Wyrmshadow. &quot;Aylrin! Where have you been, young lady?&quot; Aylrin grinned impishly,
  too familiar with Agaeis's behavior to take offense at it at the moment. &quot;Um...
  that'd depend on when you meant.&quot; <br>
  <br>
  &quot;I meant for the past two months,&quot; he replied undauntedly. &quot;No one knew
  where you were, or what happened to you. You didn't contact anyone!&quot; <br>
  <br>
  Now she blushed, just a bit. &quot;I... kinda got lost, in the goblin tunnels at Highkeep.
  Didn't Val tell anyone?&quot; <br>
  <br>
  *That* set him off in a vehement diatribe about the paladin's habits of not telling anyone
  anything. Aylrin defended her friend heartily, but somewhere inside she was secretly glad
  for the diversion. With the ordeal behind her, getting lost that way had become something
  of an embarrassment, and the longer Agaeis focused on Val, the less he'd focus on her own
  failures. <br>
  <br>
  Besides, it seemed that Papa really had missed her. So maybe he had some things right
  about Val. After all, if the half-elf hadn't told the guild about finding her, who knew
  what he hadn't told her about the guild... It gave her a little bit of hope, at least. <br>
  <br>
  She broke from her musings when she realized Agaeis was asking her a question. Stonebrunt?
  She'd certainly never been there before, it might be worth exploring. And Megera was there
  as well. Aylrin hadn't spent nearly as much time as she would have liked with the wizard;
  something in the other woman told Aylrin they could be good friends. So she agreed to go,
  and Agaeis worked his magic. <br>
  <br>
  He could only actually teleport them so far, and Aylrin was a little dismayed to realize
  they had to travel through a place called the Warrens to reach their destination. Racing
  through those tunnels, piping the song that kept hostile eyes away from them, gave the
  bard a nasty turn. More than once she nearly panicked when she lost sight of her guide.
  She couldn't get lost again, she just couldn't! But they made it through, with only a
  relatively minor mishap when a few of the dog-like kobolds saw past her spell. And then
  they were out, free, the tunnels behind them and around them nothing but crisp air and
  proud trees and towering mountains. Somewhere nearby she could hear the sound of surf, and
  a thrill of delight ran through her. Trees and mountains and ocean, what more could she
  need? <br>
  <br>
  Agaeis showed her around, and though they didn't find Megera, Aylrin did get to meet the
  cat-like people of the highlands. A pair of kittens playing entranced her, and the druid
  parted with her in the settlement. She didn't mind in the least. <br>
  <br>
  That evening, her camp set up and ready for bed, Aylrin pulled out her drawing tool. She
  twirled it through her fingers with expert precision as she considered what she'd
  discovered. Even if it was only Agaeis who'd been worried about her, she'd been very, very
  wrong in some assumptions. Those runes had to be undone, and she owed him a few others. <br>
  <br>
  Thin, sharp pain made her drop the tool, and she blinked at the long cut across her
  fingers. Not so expertly wielded after all, she mused. Soft humming closed the shallow
  slash, and she licked away the droplet of blood that had begun to trail down one finger.
  Still humming, she scooped up the tool and began drawing. Strength. Forgiveness.
  Friendship. Good Fortune. Over and over again.</big></strong></font></p>

  <p><font face="Tempus Sans ITC"><strong><big>The bard flopped onto the sand, leaning
  against the stripped crocodile carcass and giving her companion a weary smile. &quot;Not a
  bad night's hunting, huh Meg?&quot; <br>
  <br>
  The wizard yawned in reply, and Aylrin followed suit. She put away her blades in favor of
  her lute, fingers spread over the strings in preparation to play. But she hesetated,
  watching the slow run of blood from the many bites her prey had given her. So much
  bleeding already, so many cuts and scrapes and open wounds, surely a couple extra lines
  wouldn't hurt? <br>
  <br>
  No, she'd promised Megera she'd only cut the blood runes once a month, and this wasn't the
  optimum time for that magic. Her fingers strumming the healing song automatically, Aylrin
  considered when would be the best time. The full moon was always a solid choise of course,
  but Winter Solstice was coming soon, and wasn't that supposed to be a time of power too?
  She couldn't remember, and when she thought about it, didn't know when she'd learned such
  things in the first place. <br>
  <br>
  That gave her pause. When *had* she learned anything about the flow and ebb of magic, when
  it was strongest and weakest? And where had she learned about blood magic, and carving
  runes in her own flesh to absorb their purpose? Picked it up along her travels? Probably;
  Meg at least knew about blood runes, far more than Aylrin did. But how exactly had she
  learned it? She couldn't remember, and that bothered her vaguely. <br>
  <br>
  &quot;Something wrong, hon?&quot; <br>
  <br>
  Aylrin looked up to find Meg's concerned eyes on her, and gave the wizard a small smile.
  &quot;Just random thoughts.&quot; She packed the lute, the bites already faded to thin,
  white scars, and took out her weapons once more. <br>
  <br>
  Meg noticed the move and wrinkled her nose. &quot;You know, I'm getting tired of crocodile
  meat. How about we do something else?&quot; <br>
  <br>
  For a moment Aylrin considered the comment, and realized she was heartily sick of hunting
  crocs as well. Maybe of hunting in general. &quot;What'd you have in mind?&quot; <br>
  <br>
  &quot;I thought we could stay at my place for a while, visit with some friends
  there.&quot; It took a moment for the meaning behind the words to sink in. *Her place.*
  Aylrin had known for a while some of her guildmates were not native to Norrath, had known
  that Meg was one of them. But knowing, and being asked to go WITH her to that unknown,
  other world, were two very different things. &quot;You could help me do some
  housecleaning,&quot; Meg added with a small grin. <br>
  <br>
  It was the irony that broke through the freeze that had taken hold of Aylrin's thoughts.
  Every adventurer on Norrath was racing to explore the new civilization on the moon that
  Erudite wizard had discovered. She was being offered a trip to a whole different world,
  one the overwhelming majority of those adventurers would never even hear about. And she
  was hesitating. <br>
  <br>
  Well, was she a bard or not? <br>
  <br>
  &quot;Sounds like a plan to me.&quot; <br>
