  <p><font face="Bradley Hand ITC"><big><strong>Before Wyrmshadow, before my 'abduction' to
  the Rivervale area to guard the lives and land of the halflings in Misty Thicket, I lived
  in Qeynos. It seems like a lifetime ago, and it might well have been....a human's
  lifetime, at least. <br>
  <br>
  I was born Valin Atherasson, in the dock area of South Qeynos; I suppose that's why I find
  myself drawn to the water, since from my earliest memories I can hear the waves lapping
  against the shore and feel the cool wind drawn from some place far away. Of course, you
  could also say that I'm drawn into the water because it's hard to swim in plate mail, but
  that's semantics. Anyway, everyone here knows I like to fish, and we're not going to hear
  any jokes cracked on that score, right? Good. <br>
  <br>
  Anyway. My mother, Athera, was a tailor's daughter before she met my father, and before I
  was born I think she dreamed of somehow drawing him out of his nomadic adventurer's life
  and settling down. She was human, perhaps prettier than most for she certainly caught the
  eye of the high elf who would sire me, and, according to the ramblings of her declining
  sickness later on, caught his heart as well. I have reason to doubt that. <br>
  <br>
  My father could not have been more different from what my mother knew unless he had been
  an ogre or another creature of darkness. Living in Qeynos, one gets used to the comings
  and goings of rangers and druids, Surefall being our close neighbor to the north and all,
  but the word of Tunare never really seemed to touch those folk of the Glades; bordered as
  we were on Karana's Plains, most chose to follow the Rainkeeper. We are as far from
  Faydwer as it is possible to get on Antonica, barring the harsh tundra of Everfrost
  itself, so the appearance of a high elf could certainly not help but catch the eye of
  every maiden in the area. A high elf paladin of Tunare...that was a prize worth striving
  for, or so went my mother's rambles. When my grandfather was alive, he often said that my
  mother won over my father not by any wiles or physical charms, but by true purity...and
  although I've been called a cynic many times, I think I can believe it. <br>
  <br>
  I do not know what his name was. My mother never told me. They were together for only a
  short time, though she begged him to stay, but he was questing....a new continent had been
  discovered and his people were landing on those foreign shores to construct an outpost,
  and, as one of the defenders and standardbearers of the sylvan faith, it was his duty to
  go along. He left my mother three months pregnant and departed for Kunark, and never
  returned. <br>
  <br>
  Mother pined, and she wept, and grew big in the belly, and then one gusty autumn night she
  forced me into the world under the care of the Priests of Life. <br>
  <br>
  I can't say that I grew up unhappy. My grandfather refused to turn my mother out on the
  street, and so we had a place to live and Mother did piecework and knitwork and washed
  laundry and so made enough money to keep us from starving or freezing. I rambled along the
  piers, among the workers constantly loading and unloading the ships that travelled between
  us and Odus, and I tangled with the beggars and the ragged children that haunted the
  wharfs. There were secret places under the water that I could barely see with my head just
  under the waves, but my curiousity was not stronger than my hatred of swimming then; I
  never said I liked to swim, just that I liked living by the water. <br>
  <br>
  I made few friends, and the ones I did make outgrew me quickly. There were not many
  half-blooded children around, and the humans shot up past me in height and in interests at
  a startling rate. Kids I'd played with in the sand at the shore became teenagers, then
  married and settled down, and I was still little more than a child. My mother aged, her
  dark hair shot through with grey and her fingers curling painfully in the damp atmosphere.
  My grandfather passed away, and was buried in the graveyard of the Temple of Life. <br>
  <br>
  In my seventeenth year, my grandfather's grave was plundered, as were many others in the
  churchyard. Already weakened by grief, this horror chained my mother to her bed in the
  little house Grandfather had left us. Her collapse meant she could work no more, so I set
  myself to scavenging; there were no other jobs for a half-blooded bastard who looked no
  older than a tenth-year human child. <br>
  <br>
  It was hard finding anything that wasn't rotten through and inedible or unusable. If I had
  been older, maybe I would have realised something more than grief was wrong with my
  mother, and with the entirety of my hometown. At night, she muttered and thrashed in her
  sleep; in the daytime she was hardly better, her eyes glazed and glittery with fever and
  her words incoherent. I did not notice how much quieter the town got as the season wore
  on, as each time I set foot outside our broken door there seemed to be fewer and fewer
  people out on the streets. I do remember the profusion of rats, huge wharf and sewer rats
  that scuttled around boldly even in daylight, but most of the time I was too delirious
  with need to register much more than their existence. When it became obvious at last that
  my mother was not bedridden because of grief but because of illness, it was already too
  late. <br>
  <br>
  An epidemic of disease had swept Qeynos in that summer while I rooted through refuse and
  snatched what little I could while merchants' backs were turned. Some blamed the rats,
  some the water, some said a sinister curse was upon the town, but everyone knew that there
  was some supernatural agent at work; the hills outside our city, once green and beautiful,
  were plagued now with rabid beasts and undead...and I knew deep down that my grandfather's
  bones stalked the night among those other restless souls. My mother had been a good,
  devoted follower of the Temple of Life, so finally one of the priests gave in to my
  entreaties and descended to our small abode.</strong></big></font></p>

  <p><strong><font face="Bradley Hand ITC"><big>&nbsp;</big></font></strong></p>
  <p><strong><font face="Bradley Hand ITC"><big>I think he honestly tried. He was a young
  priest, with a plain, sad face who had obviously seen others in a similar state. It must
  have been bad; I couldn't tell, she just looked like Mother to me, albeit Mother suffering
  more, and more uncontrollably, than I had ever seen or could deal with. The priest laid
  his hands on my mother and murmured the words of prayer, and I saw the magic of healing up
  close for the first time...at the public healings Rodcet Nife's temple occasionally had, I
  always seemd to find myself in the back trying to climb on some bit of scenery to get even
  the slightest glimpse. The lines of pain on her face softened, her eyes slid closed in
  true sleep, her wheezing breaths eased. Then the priest rose, head bowed solemnly for a
  long moment, and then he looked at me with eyes too sad to be mortal. <br>
  <br>
  &quot;I'm sorry,&quot; was all he said, then he left. <br>
  <br>
  My mother died that night, while I clung to her hand and begged her to wake up. She never
  stirred, and finally her breath just ebbed away. Looking back, I know I should be thankful
  that she was granted some peace, but I fell asleep there with my face pressed into the
  blankets that still held the scent of her old perfume, her chilling hand locked between
  mine. <br>
  <br>
  The next day I was at the gates of the Temple of Life, a grubby orphan, tear-streaked but
  defiant. 'Bertoxxulous', said the whispered gossip, and for the first time I had heard it
  as I stalked through the streets. The god of disease, strewing his wrath upon Qeynos and
  surrounds. My mother's murderer. Thus, I thought, I would cast my lot with his mortal
  enemies. I would become a priest, like the one who had tried so desperately to save my
  mother. <br>
  <br>
  When the high priest slammed the door in my face with the words, &quot;We don't take
  half-breeds,&quot; I did not cry. I had already wept all I could. In the place of tears
  came a boiling rage. <br>
  <br>
  Rodcet Nife wouldn't have me. Tunare had spirited my father off to wander or die somewhere
  far away, across more distance than I could even comprehend. Bertoxxulous...even stung as
  I was by the God of Healing's rejection, I could not turn toward my mother's murderer and
  the defiler of my grandfather's grave. I found myself stalking purposefully, my feet
  tracing a path all of their own, and turned a corner I had only ever dashed by in my
  scavenger ramblings. And I saw the banners, and the men and women in armor, all emblazoned
  with the sigils of rain and storm, and I knew where my steps had brought me. Scared,
  determined, and darkly furious, I tugged on the cloak of the nearest armored figure, and
  when he looked down at me with curious eyes, I had only one question. <br>
  <br>
  &quot;Am I welcome?&quot; <br>
  <br>
  And he looked me over--wiry frame too slender for my height, eyes too old for a
  child-smooth face, and the subtly pointed ears half-hidden by ragged dark hair--and set a
  gauntletted hand on my shoulder, and said &quot;Yes.&quot; <br>
  <br>
  I am a Knight of Thunder. I haven't been home in a long time, and it hurts; I stood by
  while the green plague mist took over the Karanas, too young yet to do anything to fight
  it. The Plainslands are clean again, but with no help from me, and my lack of action
  shames me. I searched what little of Kunark that I could face and found no trace of my
  father, but there are deeper jungles and dungeons to explore, and even though the humans
  who were my childhood friends have children and grandchildren of their own now, I know
  that like me, my father--if he still lives--is nearly as ageless as when he first met my
  mother, long long ago, on the Qeynos docks. <br>
