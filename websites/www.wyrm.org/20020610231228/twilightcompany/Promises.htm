  The last note echoed in the small room as Aylrin gasped for breath. She'd lost track long
  ago of how long she'd been working on this one instrument. The mandolin, the drum, even
  the flute hadn't given her as much trouble as this simple horn. Rubbing her neck, she put
  the horn away and stretched out the kinks. In a few days she could go back to Freeport, or
  maybe Qeynos, and have her skill judged by one of the Bard Guild trainers. The last time
  she'd been in Freeport they'd been satisfactorily impressed with her skill. Maybe this
  time, they'd judge her among the masters. Maybe this time, she could go home.<br>
  <br>
  Home. The images came immediately, bright and clear despite the seasons she'd been away.
  The tall, stately trees, the platforms and ramps and bridges nestled among them. With them
  came a sharp pang, a longing that never seemed to grow less intense, a need to see the
  Greater Faydark once more. Soon, she thought, Only one more promise to keep.<br>
  <br>
  There'd been so many promises she'd made over the years. Kevek, the quiet, serious bard
  who'd been her mentor and friend all her life, had always given his gentle support to any
  of her fanciful ideas. Mother... well, mother was a ranger, practical and a touch
  impatient with fancies. There was no time for daydreaming while trying to put food on the
  table and keep enemies from the door. Odd that mother had always been friendly and
  admiring of Kevek, even to asking his aid in raising her daughter, and yet had disapproved
  of Aylrin becoming a bard as well. But then, Kevek was a fighting bard, skilled with the
  sword as much as the lute, and among his songs were magical attacks as devastating as any
  battlemage's spells. Mother didn't expect her to acheive the same skills. Aylrin had
  nearly gone into hysterics the first time she'd seen a pixie die. When she'd seen Mother
  kill an attacking orc, she'd fainted.<br>
  <br>
  Things have certainly changed. The shy, skittish girl who'd left so long ago was not the
  same one who would return. She remembered every single boastful promise she'd made, piling
  one on top of another in an effort to impress Mother. To be a master of all instruments.
  To become a fighting bard. To master weaponed fighting. To be a jeweler. To master ALL
  crafts.<br>
  <br>
  Kevek had, as always, given his unswerving encouragement, never indicating he doubted her
  ability to do all she said. Mother had chuckled, had said she'd be happy if Aylrin came
  home in one piece. And Aylrin, disappointed and stung, had sworn she wouldn't come back at
  all, until she was a Master Bard, a Master Fighter, and a Master Crafter.<br>
  <br>
  Many, many times since she'd regretted that hasty oath. But she would have regretted even
  more going home to face Mother's I-knew-it sympathies, and it would have killed her to see
  Kevek disappointed in her for not keeping a promise.<br>
  <br>
  So she'd stayed away, and she'd studied every skill she possibly could. She'd been
  certified as a Master Potter ages ago; while not jewelrycraft, it was a craft, and a
  suprisingly useful one. She was equally skilled with blunt and slashing weapons. All that
  remained was the judging of her musical talents. Then she could go home, Then she would be
  a daughter her Mother could be proud of. <br>

  <br>
  <br>
  &quot;Aylrin? Can it really be little Aylrin?&quot;<br>
  <br>
  Aylrin laughed and hugged the guard. &quot;It's Master Aylrin now, Rainbringer!&quot;<br>
  <br>
  &quot;You really did it, then? Congratulations! Fireblight, look who's back, and a Master
  to boot!&quot;<br>
  <br>
  Even as the guard called to his partner, Aylrin was slipping past them onto the lift into
  Kelethin. &quot;I'll come by and visit later. I have to go see Mother now!&quot;<br>
  <br>
  &quot;Aylrin, wait!&quot; But the platform was already rising, and Aylrin was blissfully
  unaware of their efforts to call her back. She was home! Each breeze set the trees
  whispering welcome, the gentle rainfall was a song of greeting, and all the blessedly
  familiar faces and places came rushing back to her mind. Home at last! She was off and
  running the moment the platform stopped, too eager to be held back even a moment more.<br>
  <br>
  &quot;Mother? Kevek?&quot; Flinging the door of her Mother's house open, she announced,
  &quot;It's Aylrin! I'm ho-&quot; Her delighted announcement stumbled to a halt as she came
  face to face with two druids. One of the pair began some greeting which Aylrin never
  heard. Her attention was on the other, bending over a cot holding-<br>
  <br>
  &quot;Mother!&quot; She pushed past the two and knelt by the cot, eyes starting to tear.
  &quot;What happened? What's wrong?&quot;<br>
  <br>
  &quot;Hush, child, hush. She's resting now, we've placed her in a healing sleep. Leave her
  be for a time.&quot;<br>
  <br>
  One of the druids placed a hand on her arm, and she blinked at the older woman.
  &quot;But... but what happened? How was she hurt?&quot;<br>
  <br>
  The druids gestured for her to move away from the bed, and sat down where they're talking
  would not disturb the injured. &quot;You know what's happened in the Lesser Faydark,
  child?&quot;<br>
  <br>
  &quot;The god of Fear has taken that part of Tunare's realm.&quot; She glanced at the
  still figure on the bed. Mother was a devout follower of Tunare. Aylrin easily recalled
  her own rage when Bertoxxous gained a foothold in Karana's plains. Had Mother felt the
  same, and feeling such, gone to battle the intruding forces?<br>
  <br>
  The druid confirmed it. &quot;A war party was gathered little more than a week ago to
  fight the enroaching evil. No one is sure what happened; those who survived have as of yet
  been unable to talk. The bodies of most of the party were found near the Mistmoore border,
  and a few who'd been left for dead. There were also several Tier'dal corpses, so we know,
  at least, who they fought.&quot;<br>
  <br>
  Aylrin shuddered, all the rumors and nightmares of her childhood coming back to her. For a
  moment she groped for something, anything to say. &quot;Where's Kevek, the bard? He knows
  healing songs, perhaps he cou-&quot; Once more her words stuttered and ceased, as the two
  druids slowly shook their heads. &quot;He... he's not...&quot;<br>
  <br>
  The woman put her hand gently over Aylrin's. Her voice as comforting as possible, she told
  the girl, &quot;He was part of the party, but not among the corpses found. Rangers found
  traces of a Tier'dal raiding band, and followed it to the sea. Another of the missing
  party was found dead on the trail, so we believe they took the missing captive. The
  rangers picked up their trail again in the Oasis of Mar, but lost it in the Commons. I
  believe its safe to assume any survivors were taken to Neriak.&quot;<br>
  <br>
  Slowly, Aylrin closed her eyes, her previous joy crushed under the news. Neriak! Sweet,
  gentle, strong Kevek, taken captive, taken there. A part of her hoped the bard had met
  death already rather than survive to what the Tier'dal might do to him.<br>
  <br>
  She took a deep breath. Time to mourn the departed later. There were still living to care
  for. She rose and walked back to the bed, inspecting her mother's still form. The druids
  had been thorough in their healing; with rest she would be up and about soon. Except
  something about the blankets didn't look right. Something in the way they lay...<br>
  <br>
  She gasped. &quot;Her arm! Sweet Karana, her arm...&quot;<br>
  <br>
  &quot;We tried all we could, but in the end it was either remove the arm or lose the
  woman.&quot; The older woman stood behind Aylrin and placed a comforting arm around her.
  &quot;But she'll live now, and thrive. That's the most important thing.&quot;<br>
  <br>
  It was all very suddenly too much for Aylrin. &quot;Leave, please. Now.&quot; A faint
  sound of protest came from the previously silent druid, but Aylrin sliced her hand sharply
  through the air. &quot;You've done what you can. I'll tend the healing from here.
  Leave.&quot;<br>
  <br>
  She paid no attention as the woman gestured her companion out the door, or when she
  followed a moment later. For a long, long time, she simply stared at the pale, motionless
  form on the cot. Then she sat down on the floor, her mandolin in her lap, and began to
  play the soft, soothing, healing song she'd learned so long ago. She wasn't sure when the
  tears started to flow in earnest, but she noted distantly that her rhythm never waivered,
  and her voice did not shake in spite of the crying. Master Bards were skilled beyond such
  things as tears, after all.<br>
  <br>
  Kevek would have been proud.<br>

  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  The soft groan roused Aylrin from her half-sleep. She put the mandolin aside and shook out
  her aching hands. &quot;Mother?&quot;<br>
  <br>
  Another groan, a fluttering of eyelids, and then her eyes opened, focused on the girl
  knelt beside the cot. &quot;Aylrin? What... what are you doing here?&quot;<br>
  <br>
  Aylrin grimaced at her mother's raspy voice. &quot;I've come home, just like I said.&quot;
  She got a glass of water for her mother, gave it to her in small sips.<br>
  <br>
  The older elf's eyes focused on the mandolin. &quot;Yours?&quot; she croaked, and when
  Aylrin nodded, she asked, &quot;You've been singing the healing spell?&quot; Another nod,
  and the woman lay back with a small smile. &quot;Not but what I expected.&quot;<br>
  <br>
  Surprise and a little bit of hope filled Aylrin's heart. &quot;You expected this? For me
  to be able to play like this?&quot;<br>
  <br>
  &quot;Of course. You never did have the stomach for a fighter, so of course you'd learn
  the healing skills.&quot;<br>
  <br>
  Involuntarily, Aylrin flinched, even as her voice took a defensive edge. &quot;I am a
  fighter, Mother. And a bard. And a crafter. Just like I promised.&quot;<br>
  <br>
  Eyes fluttered open again, focused on Aylrin, then her mother shook her head.
  &quot;Typical of you, Aylrin. You never could accept your limits. So instead of learning
  one skill well, you go out insisting on doing them all, and you end up doing none
  well.&quot;<br>
  <br>
  &quot;But I do them well! I've hunted all over Antonica, and made fine pottery, and sold
  jewelry in Freeport.&quot; A sense of dispair was beginning to well up in her, all too
  familiar. &quot;Look. I made this cloak, gnoll-fur, and I hunted up the fur myself!&quot;
  She fingered the edge of the warm, soft cloak, remembering how long it'd taken and how
  much fur she'd ruined trying to make it.<br>
  <br>
  Her mother looked obligingly, then snorted. &quot;Blackburrow, isn't it? Very hard hunting
  there, I'm sure.&quot;<br>
  <br>
  The sarcastic tone stung, and she replied bitterly, &quot;And I'm sure you killed a
  hundred orc commanders your first day on the hunt.&quot;<br>
  <br>
  &quot;Watch your tone, young lady.&quot; The suddenly sharp, commanding voice belied the
  frail condition of the woman speaking. &quot;I am your mother, and you will give me the
  respect due that relationship. Do you understand?&quot;<br>
  <br>
  &quot;Yes, ma'am.&quot; Even as she said it, a part of Aylrin couldn't believe this was
  happening again. She'd spent the last several weeks battling orcs and killing crocodiles
  for food, and here she was cringing like a child!<br>
  <br>
  Her mother was completely unaware of Aylrin's discomfort. &quot;You've been this way all
  your life, Aylrin. Can't accept limits. Can't accept natural order. You try too much,
  girl, and you're going to make yourself miserable. Some people simply aren't meant to
  accomplish many things. Stick with what you're good at, child, and don't drive yourself
  this way.&quot;<br>
  <br>
  Her voice small, her form bent, Aylrin offered one last defiance. &quot;Kevek always
  believed in me.&quot;<br>
  <br>
  The weary sigh from her mother was, again, all too familiar. &quot;Kevek was a dreamer,
  dear. Entertaining, a lot of fun, but not very practical. His dreams couldn't stop the
  raid, and they couldn't save him.&quot; After a long pause, she added, &quot;I'm only
  saying this because I love you. I don't want to see you hurt.&quot;<br>
  <br>
  Another akward pause, then Aylrin collected her lute. &quot;Why don't you get some rest?
  I'd like to go visit some friends, if that's all right.&quot; Her mother made a small
  gesture of dismissal, and Aylrin slipped outside.<br>
  <br>
  There was no one she wanted to visit right then, but there was someplace she wanted to go.
  Once, exploring the platform city as a child, she'd come to a small, isolated place. There
  was a small house on the platform, but long unused, and no connection from it to the rest
  of the city save a long, sweeping bridge. Even the guards only patrolled there
  occationally. She'd stood on that tiny platform, so high she couldn't see the forest floor
  at all, and looked up at the trees which stretched beyond view above her. It had started
  to rain, cutting off the view of the next platform, truly isolating this place and its
  one, small inhabitant. Awestruck, and slowly delighted, Aylrin had spun and danced in the
  rain, avoiding the shelter nearby. All the years after, she'd thought of that platform as
  Karana's private place, a guest room provided to the Rain God by Tunare for his visits.
  From then on she'd been a worhipper of Karana, wholehearted. But she'd never told anyone
  about her private dance with Karana, except Kevek. Kevek always understood.<br>
  <br>
  Now she made her way back to that platform, seeking comfort in the familiar rituals of
  childhood. This time she went into the house, not wishing to be seen if a guard came by.
  At last all the tears she had choked back came forth. Tears for Kevek, dead if the gods
  were kind. For her mother, deprived of health and wholeness. For Tunare and Karana, who's
  realms were being desecrated. For the child she'd been, who had never been able to quite
  please the one she loved the most. And for the woman she was now, who realized she never
  could please her mother, would always fail in some way in her view.<br>
  <br>
  A long time later, drained of tears, she heard the faint pattering of rain outside. She
  stepped out onto the platform, isolated as it had been the first time she'd come here. As
  Karana's blessing soaked itself slowly into her skin, she began to breathe easier. She
  walked to the edge of the platform furthest from the bridge, looking down into nothing.
  Then she fished in one of her bags for a small bracelet. Silver and turquoise, it was the
  first thing she'd ever made with jewelrycraft. Though almost everything else she had sold,
  this one, unenchanted item she'd held dearly, intending to give it to her mother. For a
  long moment, she studied the way the muted light played on its surface, the way the rain
  ran over the inset stones. Then the bracelet fell from her fingers, into the Greater
  Faydark, into oblivion. <br>

  <br>
  <br>
  It was past noon, and Furiel had staked out a position in the sun on the steps of Highpass
  Keep while he waited for the ache to go out of his arms. He was tired, bruised and
  bloodied, and a little bit drunk; all the usual after a run of trying to clear the mines
  of their infestation of goblins. He'd proved his worth a while back, and now the guards at
  the gate and around the keep gave him nods and smiles when he went by, despite
  the...slip-ups with shuriken earlier. He was grateful. It was steady work, and it paid.<br>
  <br>
  The sun slanted down at strange angles from this elevation, hurting his eyes when he
  caught it wrong. A far cry from Nektulos, he thought as he watched a falcon flicker across
  the sky. But not in a bad way.<br>
  <br>
  &quot;Heartseeker? Furiel, called Heartseeker?&quot;<br>
  <br>
  The address made him blink, and shake his head and look back down to the courtyard and the
  woman within it. It was that bard, the one who gave the mail runs for the Keep...something
  Goldtune. She was holding a bag and looking expectant, and Furiel half-rose, kicking over
  a half-full bottle accidentally. The bard waited politely as he grabbed after it and
  swore, her calm face twitching just a little in a smile.<br>
  <br>
  &quot;That's me,&quot; he managed at last. &quot;Mail for Freeport?&quot; He squinted at
  the bag, then her when she shook her head.<br>
  <br>
  &quot;Mail for you. Sit down already before you hurt yourself.&quot;<br>
  <br>
  He sat, baffled, as she drew a parchment envelope from the carrysack. Who in Norrath would
  write him a letter?<br>
  <br>
  &quot;Who's it from?&quot;<br>
  <br>
  The bard handed it over, and rolled her eyes when he wasn't looking. &quot;I don't know,
  sir, I didn't read it.&quot; She moved on up the stairs past him at that, into the Keep to
  finish the delivery, and he sank back down to peer at the letter. It was fine parchment,
  though worn around the edges from travel, and as he broke the seal a faint scent of
  evergreen drifted out.<br>
  <br>
  &quot;Furiel,&quot; he murmured faintly, translating the half-understood elvish into
  Teir'Dal as he went, &quot;I need your help...&quot;<br>
  <br>
  He read the letter to himself with a growing unease. It was Aylrin's hand, and her
  signature at the bottom...the wood elf, the bardling it was so much fun to tease.
  Something about raiders, and dark elves, and prisoners, and...maps?<br>
  <br>
  &quot;She wants what?&quot; he said under his breath, alarmed enough that the guards
  looked over curiously.<br>
  <br>
  Maps. The little bard wanted him to make her maps of Neriak so she could make her way in
  there and try to rescue her friend. Mentor? Lover? It didn't say, but the girl's panic
  came through clearly enough to assume.<br>
  <br>
  Furiel closed his eyes, trying to think through the haze of alcohol. There was no way
  Aylrin could rescue this friend, even if he were alive. No map could even teach her how to
  get through Nektulos, and the city was a labyrinth of passages carved right out of the
  mountain. Not to mention the proliferation of guards. She couldn't sneak through reliably,
  she couldn't change form, and Furiel just knew that if she found her friend hurt she'd
  start in with that healing song immediately. As lovely as it was, it would be a beacon for
  every bard-hating Teir'Dal in the city. And there were a lot of them.<br>
  <br>
  So that left...<br>
  <br>
  *I can't believe I'm even considering this.*<br>
  <br>
  An hour later, with a return letter promising maps and any other intelligence Aylrin
  needed already speeding its way toward the Faydark, he stepped back out into the sun. The
  Captain had been less than pleased to lose a good hunter, but there was no shortage of
  mercenaries willing to clean out the Keep. He had argued weakly, anyway. No one really
  wanted a Teir'Dal around, even as friendly as Furiel had tried to be.<br>
  <br>
  He wondered, as he started down the path toward Freeport, just how much he would regret
  this once he was sober. <br>

  &quot;You've barely come home, and you're leaving again?&quot;<br>
  <br>
  With effort, Aylrin was able to not cringe at her mother's tone. The heavy disapproval had
  always been there, and most likely always would be. &quot;I've things to do, Mother. I'll
  be home again soon.&quot;<br>
  <br>
  &quot;Always something to do. You've never learned to sit still for a while.&quot; With a
  sigh, her mother sat down in the nearest chair, watching her daughter pack. &quot;What
  silliness are you joining this time?&quot;<br>
  <br>
  Gritting her teeth in frustration and fury, Aylrin replied, &quot;I'm going to bring Kevek
  home, if he's still alive.&quot;<br>
  <br>
  &quot;Have you lost your senses completely?!?&quot; Shock was something a bit new to hear
  from her mother, and Aylrin was hard-pressed not to smile. &quot;He's dead, child, and the
  only thing you'll accomplish going into that hellhole is to join him. How do you expect to
  enter Neriak and survive?&quot;<br>
  <br>
  She double-checked the contents of one bag, then began sorting the next. &quot;A friend is
  going to help.&quot;<br>
  <br>
  &quot;Another fool to march into the fire.&quot;<br>
  <br>
  &quot;No, Mother.&quot; The second bag was sealed. &quot;He's going to make me some maps
  and tell me the best route in and out of the city. He knows his way around pretty well, so
  he'll be able to prepare me for what's to come.&quot;<br>
  <br>
  &quot;Your 'friend' is lying to you, darling. He can't possibly know his way around that
  place. No one enters the Tier'dal realm and comes out alive.&quot;<br>
  <br>
  &quot;Tier'dal do.&quot;<br>
  <br>
  The silence behind her stretched long enough to make Aylrin nervous. She turned to see her
  mother deathly pale. &quot;You're friends with... with one of them?&quot; When no denial
  was forthcoming, her mother exploded. &quot;How could you possibly be friends with one of
  those murderous, hateful, gods-forsaken creatures?!&quot;<br>
  <br>
  &quot;Because he's very kind, he's taught me a great deal, and he's a guildmate in
  Wyrmshadow.&quot; Turning back to her inspection of her supplies, she finished, &quot;I'm
  supposed to meet him in Freeport. With a little luck catching the boat in Butcherblock, I
  can probably be there before nightfall. Once we go over his information, we can plan a
  decent escape.&quot;<br>
  <br>
  Her mother simply stared with a strange expression on her face. Slowly, she told the girl
  before her, &quot;I don't know what's happened to you, Aylrin. You're not the girl I
  knew.&quot;<br>
  <br>
  &quot;I never was.&quot; She gave her mother a kiss on the cheek (ignored) and gave her a
  gentle smile. &quot;I'll be back in a few days, I promise.&quot;<br>
  <br>
  No response whatsoever. After a brief period, Aylrin picked up her bags and left. Part of
  her was glad she'd stood up to her mother at last. Part of her feared she'd done
  irrepparible damage to their relationship. Both emotions, however, were quickly swallowed
  in the overwhelming worry for Kevek. Maps and plans and a Tier'dal friend were all well
  and good, but what if he wasn't alive? She took the lift to the ground, took out her drum,
  and ran for Butcherblock. Please, she prayed silently, Please let Furiel be in Freeport
  when I get there. Please let there be someone left worth rescuing. <br>

  <br>
  The guards at the gate to the Foreign Quarter ignored Furiel as he walked into the city,
  looking past him as if he were not there. This satisfied him; he'd paid a goodly sum to
  get far enough that they'd stop glaring at him every time he tried to come home. Standard
  operating costs for a follower of Bristlebane down here.<br>
  <br>
  Speaking of costs, this little trip was likely to seriously lighten his purse. Instead of
  heading straight on through to the Commons, he veered up the jagged path toward the troll
  and ogre section, picking his way carefully in the dim phosphorescence of Neriak
  'daytime'. The city was quiet, as usual; unlike the boisterous Freeport, connector of two
  continents and general human place, the dark elf home was quiet and watchful.<br>
  <br>
  Except, of course, when there was a sacrifice due.<br>
  <br>
  He passed through the tunnel cut into the rock and slipped down into the real foreign
  quarter. The smell here was...decidedly different, probably one of the reasons the guards
  declined to patroll in here and instead gave guard status to some few ogres. Furiel
  wrinkled his nose a bit, unused to the stink from too long spent in fresh air. With a
  preoccupied smile and wave to the ogre ladies on the landing--and a quickstep or two to
  avoid their 'friendly' hands--he slid by, up another ramp, and eased open the thick metal
  door of one of the apparent living quarters.<br>
  <br>
  Inside, Oosa Shadowthumper grunted and twitched in his sleep, draped on a chair bigger
  than some folks' beds. Furiel shut the door silently behind him and slid into a shadow,
  then cleared his throat.<br>
  <br>
  The ogre exploded from his seat, the massive sword that had been resting against the wall
  by him carving the air in a deadly arc. Furiel stood as still as he could while Oosa
  looked around wild-eyed for a target, sniffed the air and then grunted with irritation.<br>
  <br>
  &quot;Thief,&quot; the ugly creature grated, &quot;come out.&quot;<br>
  <br>
  &quot;Put the sword down first,&quot; Furiel said, shifting his position quickly as the
  ogre turned to track his voice.<br>

  Oosa's face screwed up in disgust, but he set the sword back against the wall and sat down
  in a massive crash of rusting mail. After a moment or so, the rogue slipping out of his
  hiding place. Oosa glowered.<br>
  <br>
  &quot;What you want?&quot;<br>
  <br>
  &quot;Just thought I'd pay a visit since I was in town,&quot; Furiel said, leaning against
  a wall in an attempt to be casual. That the big ogre could crush him in a moment, and
  would if he decided not to like the elf, was undeniable, but Oosa was a serious problem to
  the plan that had been formulating in Furiel's head.<br>
  <br>
  Thankfully, the ogre was used to dealing with rogues, for certain reasons. The dark elf
  flashed a smile. &quot;After all, you've always been a helpful fellow. You deserve some
  appreciation. A break, as it were.&quot; At that, he pulled out a small pouch from under
  the darkness of his cloak, bouncing it in his palm a few times. It jingled appealingly,
  and the ogre sat up slightly, irritation fading into slyness. <br>
  <br>
  &quot;Oosa been wanting a break.&quot;<br>
  <br>
  &quot;At the local bar, maybe?&quot;<br>
  <br>
  The ogre twitched his fleshy pale brows. &quot;Maiden's Fancy maybe.&quot; Furiel's
  disgust must have shown up on his face, because Oosa roared with laughter, slapping his
  palm on his knee with a great clashing of metal.<br>
  <br>
  &quot;If you're entirely done...?&quot;<br>
  <br>
  &quot;Yes, yes. How long, thief?&quot;<br>
  <br>
  Furiel frowned thoughtfully. If all went well... &quot;Two hours.&quot;<br>
  <br>
  &quot;How much in there?&quot;<br>
  <br>
  &quot;Twenty.&quot;<br>
  <br>
  &quot;That not keep me for two hours, elf.&quot;<br>
  <br>
  &quot;Twenty-five then. But you better not get tempted to come back early.&quot;<br>
  <br>
  The ogre held out a meaty hand, grinning in his eager tusky way, and Furiel dug out a few
  more coins and handed over them and the pouch. Oosa nodded. &quot;Deal. Oosa won't cross
  Ebon Mask.&quot;<br>
  <br>
  A faint smile twitched the corner of his mouth, but Furiel just inclined his head with
  proper elven condescension. &quot;I'll be sure to tell the guildmasters of your
  help.&quot; With that, he bowed and slid his way out of the place.<br>
  <br>
  Next, errands. The shops of the Neriak Underground provided all that he needed, though the
  lady herbalist regarded him strangely when he asked for certain of her plants. Not usual
  purchases for a rogue, he knew; nothing toxic or even potentially toxic. At least, that
  was the hope. He stopped again at the bank, entrusting his heavier gear to the dour-faced
  banker and taking out a roll of clothing, old stuff he'd kept there just in case. Cloak,
  tunic, pants, boots, the basics. With his smaller blades hidden and a pair of plain swords
  on his hips, the bundle of clothes under one arm and his herbal supplies and poison kit
  strapped to his belt, he stepped back up into the street and the shadows.<br>
  <br>
  It begins now, he thought as he made his way stealthily toward the lair of the Indigo
  Brotherhood. A little thrill slipped through the vice-clench of calm he'd tried to put
  over his emotions. If this Kevek fellow was dead, it would have been a waste of more than
  a little money; if he was not, he would be in the dungeon under the Brotherhood. The
  temple to Innoruuk was inviolate, not to mention spelled down to the very stones against
  any such action like a rescue or sneakthief's attempts, but it also did not have the
  facilities to hold prisoners. Sacrifices were kept in the pens under the Brotherhood's
  practice arena, and hauled out through the streets to the temple when the time came for
  them to die. If Kevek hadn't already been taken, he would be down there.<br>
  <br>
  Furiel staked out a spot by the Toadstool tavern and settled in to watch the warrior
  compound. He'd been in there once or twice when he was younger, usually in the care of his
  mother when she wanted to watch the arena fights. He closed his eyes and tried to remember
  the layout, even as his hands moved automatically to crush and grind the leaves he'd
  bought in his poison pestle. A double staircase down to the lower area, which fed into a
  central room where the guildmasters tended to gather...corridors beyond that, and stairs
  down to the cells... The warriors did not patrol their own halls, as far as he could
  recall, which left only possible wanderers as a threat. A good-sized one; patrols, at
  least, had a rhyme and rhythm to them. His hands added water to the concoction
  automatically, mixing and crushing into paste. Opening his eyes, he dipped a finger into
  the stuff and traced it across his pale leather armband, then compared the smear to his
  skin. Deep indigo, a decent match.<br>
  <br>
  Time to go.<br>
  <br>
  He ghosted in one of the side doors that he knew led to the downstairs. It was well-lit,
  the halls white stone with no place to hide, but he pulled down his mask and brushed his
  cloak back to show the swords on his belt. First step to infiltration: look like you
  belong. The guildmasters in the wide bannered trophy room glanced up from their discussion
  as he made his way down the steps, but only briefly; he bowed with deep respect and they
  gave their curt nods before going back to discussing some fine point of swordsmanship. In
  dusty leather and banded mail, he certainly did not look skilled enough to be noticed.<br>
  <br>
  Down a corridor... He passed several closed doors, and spotted a merchant lady lingering
  in another room through an archway. No guards, just like he'd remembered. Faintly through
  the stone he could hear the clash of steel on steel from above, but down where he was it
  was quiet. The archway into the dungeon loomed in the wall darkly, no fine white stone
  there, and he smiled a little behind his mask. A blessing there, at least. On crossing
  that threshold, he slid back into the dark and descended.<br>
  <br>
  The cells twisted and twined through the earth underneath the warriors' complex,
  labyrinthine. There were no guards, no torches, nothing but the damp cold cavernous drip
  of the place. Darkness was only a slight problem to Teir'Dal eyes, and Furiel slipped
  along the edge of the cellblocks, glancing into each. Most of them empty, a few bearing a
  huddled form. He counted halflings and a human or two, all slumped in misery and simply
  waiting to die, then a long row of empty cells. His heart sank. What would he tell
  Aylrin...?<br>
  <br>
  A faint, tormented sound caught his ears, further down in the gloom, and he slunk along
  past more and more empty pens toward it. Finally, so distant from the other prisoners that
  only faint echoes of their cries might reach him, the rogue found his quarry. Wood elf,
  male, curled up on the stone floor with his hands hidden against his chest. Naked like all
  the prisoners and whimpering faintly. Furiel could smell blood, and rot.<br>
  <br>
  &quot;Kevek,&quot; he whispered in light elven, and the figure froze. &quot;Kevek?&quot;<br>
  <br>
  A faint sounds that might have been an affirmative. He nodded to himself and slid out his
  lockpicks.<br>
  <br>
  &quot;Aylrin sent me. I'm here to help.&quot; <br>

  <br>
  It is never a wise thing to underestimate a bard.<br>
  <br>
  Even as the pain dragged whimpers from his ruined throat, even as he cradled the twisted
  remains of his hands, Kevek could not quite suppress the fierce, pleased smile. Assuming
  the trainee commander survived whatever punishment the Guildmasters put him through, he'd
  always remember that one thing. It is never wise to underestimate a bard.<br>
  <br>
  It'd been before dawn when the &quot;training exercise&quot; had started; little more than
  another excuse to beat the prisoners within an inch of their lives before sacrafice. Lying
  in his cell, Kevek had heard three sobbing prisoners dragged from theirs, and then his
  door had opened. &quot;Here, prep this one too! We'll set him up and have some extra
  fun!&quot;<br>
  <br>
  &quot;Setting up&quot; had included twisting his fingers until they were swollen twice
  their size and every little touch was agony. Then some vile concoction had been poured
  down his throat, burning all the way, resulting in pain with every word or whimper. They'd
  dragged him into the arena, where one of the other prisoners was being used to demonstrate
  methods of attack that caused the most pain with the least chance of quick death. He was
  chained nearby... and handed a lute.<br>
  <br>
  &quot;Now play,&quot; the commander had ordered in heavily-accented common. &quot;Heal
  them up, so we all get a good workout. Stop playing once, and it's you we start practicing
  on.&quot;<br>
  <br>
  Wide-eyed, Kevek had stared at the lute. They wanted him to sing. They'd even given him an
  instrument! The fools! Cringing in proper terror, he'd begun picking out the healing song,
  whimpering at every strum, trying to tune the whimpers to the music. As the bleeding
  prisoner's wounds eased their flow, the commander grunted. &quot;There you go. Have at
  them, and have a good go. And remember your angles!&quot;<br>
  <br>
  The commander had taken a perch above the Arena, leaving only the prisoners and three
  trainees within the affect area of Kevek's song. Kevek had studied the trainees covertly.
  Green, all three; he'd bet none of them had ever faced an enemy that wasn't bound. His
  fingers shifted, the song changing slightly. The words he sang softly became harsher,
  whispered venom. It was a peculiar talent, often called twisting, the ability to weave
  two, or even three, songs together for a combined effect. Kevek had perfected the skill
  ages past.<br>
  <br>
  When the prisoners began to look faint, nobody thought anything of it. When one died, the
  commander had glared briefly at Kevek. But the bard was still playing, so he'd dismissed
  the death as excess enthusiasm on the part of the trainee. The trainees were certainly off
  this morning, though. Tired, a little befuddled. One had actually yawned. A second
  prisoner died, and all three had focused on the remaining human, barely twitching with the
  strikes anymore. A moment more, and one of the trainees had lowered her sword and stepped
  back, swaying on her feet. Confused eyes had circled the Arena, focused on the
  still-singing bard. Rage had for a moment cleared the spell-cast legarthy, she'd raised
  her weapon with an animalistic snarl... and dropped dead where she stood.<br>
  <br>
  Pandemonium ensued. The commander and a guard had charged into the arena, shouting for
  assistance, while the remaining trainees moved from confused to frightened. One drove his
  sword into the last chained prisoner, killing him instantly, while the other charged
  around the Arena screaming about spies and assassins. Through it all, Kevek continued his
  songs, hitting each new entrant with the slowing Lullabye and the slow-killing battle
  song, until one of the Guildmasters entered the scene, took one look at him, and charged
  with a warrior-cry of rage and death.<br>
  <br>
  He'd answered her cry with a powerful bellow, shredding his throat to force out the attack
  again and again. Both trainees fell, a guard staggered into a wall, but the Guildmaster
  kept coming despite the pain, smashed into him, shoved her fist into his mouth to stop the
  death-song and crushed the lute under her feet. He could remember her shouting, demanding
  to know who had given him a weapon, then she'd pounded his head against the ground twice,
  and he knew no more.<br>
  <br>
  He'd woken up when they were breaking his fingers, every one, every bone. More of that
  throat-stripping poison had been poured down his gullet, and then the flaying had begun.
  But they hadn't killed him. No, they wanted him especially for Innoruuk's altar now. He'd
  been thrown into a cell far away from the other prisoners, to ensure no others would die
  before their time, and left alone since. Which was fine by him. Kevek's only regret was he
  could not use his deathsongs on himself, and find his own release from this hell.<br>
  <br>
  Then came the whisper of his name. It came again, more insistent. He gave a soft
  acknowledgement, wary, wondering what new torture they had for him.<br>
  <br>
  &quot;Aylrin sent me. I'm here to help.&quot;<br>
  <br>
  A shiver took hold of him, and he swallowed hard despite the pain it caused. Was this some
  new trick, to torture him with hope? But they wouldn't know about his darling prodigy,
  wouldn't know to taunt him with that name. Would they? He forced the words out, a harsh
  whisper. &quot;She's not here, is she?&quot;<br>
  <br>
  &quot;No. She's on her way to Freeport.&quot; A click followed the words, then a faint
  creek as the cell door opened. &quot;There we go...&quot;<br>
  <br>
  He rolled over to face his benefactor, hands curled protectively near his chest. Dark elf
  by appearances, but that didn't mean much. Somewhere in the Faydark, Kevek's own Mask of
  Deception was probably slowly rotting away, unless the Teir'dal had recovered it durring
  the raid. He didn't speak standard elvish very well, so that eliminated the idea of him
  being another wood elf. &quot;Who are you?&quot;<br>
  <br>
  &quot;Friend of hers.&quot; Almost buisness-like, the young man inspected his injuries. He
  unrolled a bundle of cloth, revealing clothes and bandages, and set to work dressing the
  wounds. &quot;This might be uncomfortable, but I'm not taking you out naked.&quot;<br>
  <br>
  &quot;I'm afraid you'll be hard-pressed to take me out at all.&quot; Curiousity was
  getting the better of caution. Had Aylrin heard about the raid and hired a rogue mercenary
  to retrieve him?<br>
  <br>
  The stranger negated the declaration with quiet confidence, then helped him stand. The man
  seemed a little too concerned to be the average mercenary. And the accent to his elven was
  familiar... too familiar of late. &quot;Why did you come?&quot; he asked as he helped the
  stranger dress him.<br>
  <br>
  &quot;If I didn't, she would.&quot;<br>
  <br>
  Kevek grimaced. &quot;She can't come here. She'd never survive.&quot;<br>
  <br>
  &quot;That's what I was thinking.&quot; The young man's tone told Kevek more than his
  words. He was no mercenary, was fairly close to Aylrin, friends at least. And he'd wager a
  singing short sword that Aylrin had no idea he was doing this. &quot;Give me your
  hands.&quot;<br>
  <br>
  As they eased gloves over the swollen digits, Kevek gritted his teeth. Further questions
  of the young man's relations with Aylrin produced vague answers, and he gave it up to
  concentrate on more pressing concerns. &quot;So how do you intend to pull this off?&quot;<br>
  <br>
  The question produced a wry smile, and a pot of deep blue pigment. &quot;You, my friend,
  get to be a Teir'Dal.&quot;<br>
  <br>
  Kevek's lips quirked faintly as the young man began to apply the pigment. &quot;Not a
  first, exactly, but definitely a unique way of doing it.&quot;<br>
  <br>
  Nodding, the young man never paused. &quot;I've got a plain mask for you, but it won't
  cover everything. Cloak's to cover your hair.&quot;<br>
  <br>
  A very unusual young man, Kevek decided. He thought he might like him, given the chance.
  &quot;You do a lot of things different from the norm, don't you?&quot;<br>
  <br>
  That made him pause a moment. &quot;I don't catch your meaning.&quot;<br>
  <br>
  &quot;Pretty unusual for a Teir'Dal to rescue a wood elf from his own people, all for the
  sake of another wood elf.&quot;<br>
  <br>
  The young man smirked in response. &quot;Maybe Xev's on your side.&quot;<br>
  <br>
  &quot;Maybe.&quot; The dyepot was put away, and Kev looked to the young man. &quot;What
  now?&quot;<br>
  <br>
  &quot;Now we walk out like a pair of relatively innocent warrior trainees.&quot;<br>
  <br>
  &quot;Possibly more difficult than it sounds.&quot; Kevek's legs were already starting to
  twinge from standing, and he wasn't sure he could manage more than a shuffle. But there
  wasn't much choice, either. <br>
  <br>
  Watching him, the young man promised, &quot;We'll take it slow. Do you know
  Teir'Dal?&quot;<br>
  <br>
  Concentrating on trying to walk normally, Kev replied, in accentless dark elven,
  &quot;Better than you know light elven, I'd wager.&quot;<br>
  <br>
  A moment's silence, then, &quot;Bards. You just have to walk normally for a short
  distance. Stay betwen me and the wall and we should be fine.&quot;<br>
  <br>
  Kevek nodded, moving into position. &quot;Don't knock bards, boyo. They'll save your
  life.&quot; Or take it, he added silently.<br>
  <br>
  The young man snorted. &quot;Let's not get into this argument now.&quot; He placed the
  mask on Kevek, gave him one last inspection, pulled up his hood, and nodded. &quot;Let's
  go.&quot; <br>

  <br>
  With a silent prayer to both the Bristlebanes, Furiel led the way out of the cell.<br>
  <br>
  The idea was to move slowly and act natural. He knew for a fact that the warriors were
  complacent when it came to security within their compound, and there was no reason for
  them not to be: no enemy in his or her right mind would ever try to come this far to save
  someone. Granted, few of the adventurers he'd met outside Neriak were truly in their right
  minds, but if there had ever been a jailbreak like this Furiel didn't know of it, and
  doubted the Indigo Brotherhood would announce it. From his scouting on the way in, he'd
  been sure it could be done.<br>
  <br>
  Now that it was time, though... Just grit your teeth and do it, he told himself. And hope
  Bristlebane doesn't feel like pulling a nasty joke on us right now.<br>
  <br>
  He kept his pace to a walk for the bard, even though it already felt like someone was
  sharpening razors on his nerves. As they passed the other prisoners, sharp ears caught a
  faint sound from the bard, a half-croaking song just under his breath, and Furiel stopped.
  He grabbed the neck of the bard's cloak and leaned in, supporting Kevek with a hand on his
  shoulder.<br>
  <br>
  &quot;Don't,&quot; he hissed, &quot;even think about it. I don't know what you're trying,
  but don't.&quot;<br>
  <br>
  Behind the mask, the wood elf's eyes narrowed with pain and frustration. &quot;They
  deserve something better than Innoruuk's altar.&quot;<br>
  <br>
  &quot;We can't do anything about that now. If you want them to die so much, I can come
  back later.&quot; Not likely, Furiel knew, but after a moment the bard nodded reluctantly,
  though he didn't look like he believed it much either.<br>
  <br>
  With another tense reminder of &quot;You sing, we die,&quot; the dark elf led the way out
  of the cellblock. The white halls were quiet, and after a moment of listening he nodded
  and led onward. The blank hallway fed into a small open area, and as they paced past a
  thankfully closed door Furiel gave a brief glance to the side, for the merchant lady who
  was set up across the way. She must have been used to random comings and goings, and
  glanced up only briefly from her ledger.<br>
  <br>
  The bard was already breathing hard behind him, but he concealed it well, just a faint
  rasp coming through the mask. Furiel doubted he'd last very long even at a sedate walk,
  though. He gave the elf a questioning look as they turned the corner out of sight, and the
  bard paused for a breath or two then nodded sharply. Around the next corner was the
  cluster of guildmasters, and beyond that the stairs. That would be the most difficult
  part.<br>
  <br>
  Then they were out, and walking. Furiel could feel the warriors' stares on his back, but
  didn't turn; he had urgent business outside, he just had to keep thinking that. He wasn't
  trying to sneak out a prisoner, no, not at all. He crossed the bare space and started up
  the broad stairs, nerves knotting with each move. Looking back even to check on Kevek
  would blow it; any show of concern was out of character, and any show of weakness on
  Kevek's part would mean death if the warriors were watching. There was a moment, when he
  reached the halfway point on the steps and heard Kevek stop, that he considered just
  bolting and not looking back and telling Aylrin &quot;sorry, I was too late&quot;.<br>
  <br>
  Instead he kept walking, and after a moment he heard the scuffling steps of someone trying
  to catch up. Not steel boots, so he stayed calm as he topped the stairs and turned into
  the leftward entryway. No one was up there, and he risked a glance backward to see Kevek
  fall from his decently brisk pace to a near collapse once he was out of sight. Furiel
  lingered by the street door, waiting. If someone came up and spotted the bard, that was
  it, he was out.<br>
  <br>
  It didn't happen. They stepped out into the street together, unnoticed, and a moment later
  stepped into The Toadstool. Furiel blocked the view into the common room with his body and
  gave a nod to the bartender, who returned it with the grin of the bribed, and motioned
  Kevek into a small alcove.<br>
  <br>
  &quot;Keep going straight,&quot; he murmured. &quot;False wall.&quot;<br>
  <br>
  The passage through the Neriak tunnels was much swifter than the trip through the
  Brotherhood. Kevek's voice echoed softly in the caverns, and Furiel was slowly driving
  himself crazy with paranoia, but no one sprang out at them from the darkness and the faint
  tickle of healing magics sped their progress as the bard gained strength.<br>
  <br>
  Furiel poked his head through the false wall of the other end of the tunnels, and breathed
  a faint sigh of relief as he found the room empty. He motioned Kevek through, quieting him
  with a wave of a hand, and opened the door a crack to check the next area. Oosa
  Shadowthumper's stool was conveniently empty. The dark elf smirked and stepped out fully,
  holding the door for Kevek.<br>
  <br>
  Everything was working. They made their way down the streets of the Foreign Quarter,
  Furiel on the outside edge to block any passerby's view of his companion, and as they went
  the rogue passed a coin here and there to a smiling troll or ogre who obligingly averted
  their eyes. He knew that if anyone asked them, they'd tell what they saw in a heartbeat,
  but the coins kept them from running off immediately and raising the guards. He could deal
  with the guards later. After all, what Teir'Dal guard would believe a troll or ogre
  against a dark elf with the Scribe of Innoruuk on his side?<br>
  <br>
  We just can't hold our alcohol at all, he thought. Dark or high, we just fall to the spell
  of wine.<br>
  <br>
  The guards only saw their backs as they walked right out of town.<br>
  <br>
  They stayed away from the path in Nektulos, heading straight through the deepest part of
  the forest instead. Kevek spent the time singing healing and speed as Furiel navigated the
  darkness, doing his best to spot guards and golems and avoid them before they were
  noticed. They hit the river a good distance away from the bridge and its guards, and Kevek
  stared at it.<br>
  <br>
  &quot;I can't swim like this,&quot; he said, voice rough from torture and singing. Furiel
  cursed, and glared off toward the bridge, then back.<br>
  <br>
  &quot;Well, I can't carry you, you're as big as I am.&quot;<br>
  <br>
  &quot;I could walk.&quot;<br>
  <br>
  &quot;Through the water?&quot;<br>
  <br>
  Kevek snorted softly under the mask. &quot;Yes, I can. I'm sure Aylrin can too, by now.
  She's a smart girl.&quot;<br>
  <br>
  &quot;Doesn't look like a mermaid to me.&quot; He shrugged, then stepped down to the bank.<br>
  <br>
  &quot;Just help me across,&quot; said the bard, and slid in.<br>
  <br>
  Breathing underwater was definitely a new experience to the rogue, but he adapted to it
  quickly, which was good because the local piranha decided that the blood-trickles washing
  off of Kevek indicated that a nice meal had just dropped in. He slashed at them as they
  swarmed, spearing a few and wiggling them among the others so their fellows would turn
  their attention to the downed fish. The stupid things were distracted easily enough, and
  finally the rogue boosted the bard up onto the grass of the other side of the river. Kevek
  sprawled there, coughing, with his cloak a dripping rag and his dark hair plastered across
  face and mask, and Furiel was just pulling himself out after him when he heard, &quot;Time
  to die, wood elf!&quot;<br>
  <br>
  The guard struck down at the prone bard, but his sword met steel rather than flesh. His
  eyes widened with surprised, then narrowed as he took in what and who was his new
  attacker, but he was too slow; Furiel drew his companion dagger from his boot and set into
  the guard, teeth bared and face furious. The thin blades found their homes in muscle and
  flesh, too fast to parry or sometimes even spot, and the guard shrieked as the serrated
  dirk hummed to life and set its poison deep within him. He managed to draw a slash along
  the rogue's arm and another on his cheek before his sword was caught and twisted away
  deftly, flipping to the ground. One more strike, and he tried to run, but the poison
  sapped his strength until his legs would barely move.<br>
  <br>
  Blood burning with adrenaline and anger, Furiel just watched for a long moment as the
  guard fought to move. He followed him, paused to grab the back of his tunic and wipe off
  his second blade and sheathe it, then jammed the serrated knife into the back of the
  guard's neck. The dark elf collapsed in a crash of armor.<br>
  <br>
  Furiel stepped back and wiped the blood from his face, watching mesmirized as the hilt of
  the dirk quivered with the guard's death twitches. He reached down and wiggled it then
  slid it out thick with gore, and turned the guard over. Yes, he recognized that face. As a
  child, he'd followed one of the golems out to the bridge, and this guard had nabbed him
  and hauled him back home to his parents. He hadn't been kind, certainly, but he wasn't
  rough. The first of his people to fall by his hand.<br>
  <br>
  Furiel scrubbed his blade in the sand and tried not to think.<br>
  <br>
  As soon as Kevek seemed to have caught his breath, he started walking again, trusting that
  the bard would catch up. <br>

  The boat jerked heavily as it hit the Freeport dock, rousing Aylrin from a light sleep.
  Shaking off the drowsiness, she came up on deck and jumped to the dock while the mooring
  lines were still being tied off. Almost sunset. She hoped Furiel was at the Guildhall with
  the maps, because she had every intention of getting into Neriak tonight.<br>
  <br>
  You can't possibly learn the in and outs of the entire city in a few hours, the logical
  part of her mind told her. You might not be able to learn it well enough in a few days.
  And that's assuming that Kevek is even alive to find.<br>
  <br>
  Alyrin was doing her best to ignore the logical part of her mind.<br>
  <br>
  &quot;There's a dark elf waiting for you upstairs,&quot; Felicity Starbright pointed to
  the side door the moment Aylrin entered the Guildhall. A little of her failing confidence
  returned at the other bard's words; something was going right, which was surely a good
  sign. With a nod of acknowledgement, Aylrin slipped through the door, past the two
  vendors, and up the stairs. She spotted Furiel the moment she reached the top, sitting on
  one of the cots. &quot;You're here! Do you ha-&quot;<br>
  <br>
  And then she spotted the person on the other cot.<br>
  <br>
  Her throat suddenly tight, it took two tries for her to choke the name out. There was no
  response from the prone figure, and hope and dread warred inside her as she stepped
  towards him. One trembling hand touched the pale cheek, smooth and cool, but thank Karana,
  not cold. Up close, she could see the rise and fall of his chest in time with his shallow
  breathing. Dumbstruck, she stroked a thin, blue smear along his jaw; some sort of pigment
  stained her fingers.<br>
  <br>
  Swallowing hard, she turned back to Furiel. He was standing now, that mischief-maker's
  smile gleaming in his eyes. &quot;Y&#133; you&#133; you got him out?&quot; The smile
  broadened slightly, and Aylrin closed her eyes. She was not going to cry. &quot;Maps, I
  told you maps&#133;&quot;<br>
  <br>
  He chuckled, and suddenly she was hugging him, clinging fiercely. He held her tenderly,
  stroking her back as thank you's tumbled from her mouth. The tears had slipped her
  control, but that was ok, Furiel wouldn't judge her for them, he'd rescued Kevek for her,
  she could trust him.<br>
  <br>
  Eventually, gently, Furiel pulled back, and with an effort she brought her runaway
  emotions back under control. He answered her questions about the rescue with a casual
  evasiveness that told her there was more to the story than he was saying. She didn't push,
  though. Nor did she argue when he left to hunt, telling her to stay with Kevek. Later, she
  could get the full story, could spend more time with the rogue. For right now, she wanted
  nothing more than to sit and watch Kevek sleep.<br>
  <br>
  Two weeks later, Aylrin helped Kevek onboard the boat to Butcherblock. The older elf moved
  stiffly, his hands were wrapped in light bandages, and she doubted either his hands or his
  voice would ever be the same. But all those things were secondary concerns, and she was
  still caught in the awe and wonder of having him here, alive. The Freeport clerics had
  done their best by the bard, and Furiel had occationally come by to help him work his
  hands back into condition. Though he still had a fair amount of healing to do, both he and
  Aylrin felt it was time to go home. Aylrin had written her mother with the news, but each
  time the letter came back unopened. She hoped she'd be able to talk sense with her mother
  in person.<br>
  <br>
  They took the journey through Butcherblock and the Greater Feydark in slow stages, neither
  rushed nor worried. There was nothing in either place that Aylrin feared, and Kevek had
  recovered enough to add his own protective wards to hers. Those heavenly days, reminiscent
  of times long gone, delighted her to no end. She was in such high spirits by the time they
  arrived in Kelethin that she barely noticed the guards greeted them with as much
  apprehension as congratulations. Only when Fireblight &quot;offered&quot; to escort her to
  the Rangers' Guildhall did she begin to realize not all was as well as it seemed.<br>
  <br>
  Nothing could have prepared her for the news the Guildmaster gave her, though. &quot;Your
  mother has disowned you, Aylrin. She has also accused you of consorting with Teir'Dal,
  known enemies.&quot; The Guildmaster's expression was grave as he studied the girl before
  him. &quot;That's a very serious charge.&quot;<br>
  <br>
  Fury and fear swept over her, and for a moment she couldn't speak. &quot;Furiel is a
  friend, and a guildmate. He's not like the other dark elves.&quot;<br>
  <br>
  &quot;A guildmate&#133; from Wyrmshadow; that's who you signed with, isn't it?&quot;
  Aylrin nodded stiffly. &quot;Yes, I've heard of them before. Not the most discriminating
  when it comes to letting people join, but a decent enough lot overall. Even so&#133;&quot;
  The guildmaster sighed heavily. &quot;Aylrin, whatever this&#133; Furiel&#133; may be to
  you, he is still Teir'Dal, and they are still our enemies. If it weren't for the fact that
  you brought Kevek home alive&#133;&quot;<br>
  <br>
  The Guildmaster paused for a long moment, then took some parchment and a quill.
  &quot;Consorting with the enemy is cause for banishment at least, Aylrin. Granted the
  extenuating circumstances, I'm willing to give some leeway.&quot; He wrote quickly, signed
  the notice, stared at it, and then stared at her. &quot;You're free to come and go
  throughout the Feydark, undisturbed, as any friendly visitor. But from this day forward, a
  visitor is all you are, a stranger to the Feydark. You have no home here anymore, and no
  rights of a citizen.&quot; Softly, he finished, &quot;Today Kelethin mourns the loss of a
  daughter.&quot;<br>
  <br>
  &quot;But&#133; but&#133; you can't! This is my home! You can't cut me off like
  this!&quot; Her protests were useless, might as well have been unheard for all the notice
  the Guildmaster gave them. He passed the notice to a runner, who walked away to post it,
  and went to the paperwork on his desk as though Aylrin were not even there. It was too
  much for the girl, and she fled.<br>
  <br>
  Hours later, drained of tears and emotions, she sat quietly with her head in Kevek's lap
  while he stroked her hair with his damaged hands. &quot;It doesn't matter what they say,
  Aylrin,&quot; he soothed. &quot;You'll always have a home here. You've been a daughter to
  me, I couldn't have loved you more had you been my own flesh and blood. And no one can
  make me turn my daughter away from my door.&quot;<br>
  <br>
  &quot;It won't be the same,&quot; she replied dully. &quot;They've posted the notice. By
  morning everyone will know I'm a disgrace.&quot;<br>
  <br>
  &quot;You are NOT a disgrace!&quot; The fierceness of his declaration should have startled
  her, but she didn't seem to have the strength for even that much response. Kevek noticed,
  and bit his tongue against the arguments he wanted to voice. Words were useless now. He
  continued to stroke her hair, finding more comfort in the simple gesture than she did.
  After a long while, he spoke again, changing to what he hoped would be a safe topic.
  &quot;You're a Master now, Aylrin, with the right to a surname. Have you thought of
  any?&quot;<br>
  <br>
  A small, bitter laugh escaped her. &quot;Oh yes, I've thought of one. Wyrmwood. It seems
  suitable, don't you think? Very descriptive. I'm a wood elf, and part of Wyrmshadow.
  Perfect, really.&quot;<br>
  <br>
  He stared at her bent head, thinking about the pain in her words, thinking about the
  meaning of the name she'd chosen. And he said no more.<br>
  <br>

  Furiel had spent most of the time lurking around Freeport just in case Kevek or Aylrin
  needed any help. Soon enough, though, the amusement value of throwing knives at griffins
  or babysitting young adventurers to while away the time grew stale, and he was relieved
  when the pair boarded ship to head back to Faydwer.<br>
  <br>
  The Commonlands were quiet as he made his way through, the midafternoon sun hanging high
  with the promise to stay there until he'd crossed Kithicor. Every now and then, a passing
  spider or wisp caught his attention, but otherwise he was left to thoughts he had been
  trying to avoid since he had left Highkeep in the first place. His purse was lighter, his
  reputation unstable, and for what?<br>
  <br>
  The thrill of escape, he assured himself as he passed the tollbooth, giving a vague nod to
  the guards who manned it then looking abck to the ground. That adrenaline rush from going
  somewhere he was not allowed, and escaping undetected with the prize. He was just sour
  because he hadn't made a clean getaway, that was all.<br>
  <br>
  It was nothing to do with Aylrin. She's a wood elf! One step away from a high elf! He
  shuddered at the thought in reflex. Nothing to do with her. Why, if she wasn't a guildmate
  he would have charged her out the ears for the service.<br>
  <br>
  Pride somewhat mollified, he looked up a bit to find himself treading on sand. Befallen,
  he thought as he caught the glow in the sand further on, Lanys T'Vyl's little stronghold.
  He'd been in there a few times to get a look at the layout and...evaluate their security,
  and his feet had brought him that way while his mind wandered. Furiel smirked to himself
  and shook his head, turning himself toward Kithicor again. Too much time around bards. He
  was starting to get downright scatterbrained. Picking up the pace, he skidded down the
  side of a dune past an armored figure and arrowed toward the forest.<br>
  <br>
  Pain lanced through him in a blast of magic sparks, and his heart nearly stopped.<br>
  <br>
  It took all of a splitsecond to glance back and see a snarl beneath a Dragoon's helm and a
  leering skeleton charging after him, then instinct kicked in and he bolted. Bony fingers
  grabbed for his cloak, tearing deep rents in it, but he managed to shake the creature off
  and leapt down another hill, rolling and tumbling and ending up decently in the lead. His
  skin sizzled with the heat of another spell, but the rest did not connect and he veered
  past the lake and launched himself through the jagged pathway into the darkness of
  Kithicor. The Dragoon may have had a clear sight of him on the gentle hills of the
  Commonlands, but the murk of the woodlands in daylight hours was enough to thwart even
  dark elven eyes. Furiel fought his breath back to normal and crept quietly through the
  brush, not daring to move faster than a crawl until the skeleton's eerie laughter had long
  since faded into the distance.<br>
  <br>
  The ogres had talked, he knew. Probably quickly, since the escape of a prisoner was a
  damnably important matter. The Indigo Brotherhood had probably rightfully tied the escape
  to the death of one of their guards, though death on duty in Nektulos was not a rare
  thing, and thus...<br>
  <br>
  &quot;And thus I can't go home anymore,&quot; he murmured to himself. A wayward goblin
  looked up from its root-gathering, startled at the voice out of the darkness, and he threw
  a blade at it absently and watched it keel over with a squeal. A memory drifted up as he
  watched the creature twitch its death throes: Alecto, the dark priestess, and her comment
  that the Father would not let him, or any Teir'Dal, go so lightly. Then he drew his ragged
  cloak closer about his shoulders and ran, back toward Highkeep.<br>
