The bookstore is a nicely sized one on a pleasent street. On the ground floor is a counter
in a corner (a quarter of a circle by the windows), a bathroom, and some tables and
chairs. There are several cushy chairs, and bookshelves up to the ceiling. About half-way
back is a metal spiral staircase leading up to the second level. The second level is sort
of a balcony, which is over the back half of the first floor and looks out on the first
floor. The occult section is located up there. Behind the counter there's an odd feature:
a sword collection. Those with Awareness, please roll so as to detect the sanctum-like
nature of the place and the overwhelming amount of rotes all around the store. <br>
Tom - Appears to be working his way through getting his Masters degree, about 23, brown
hair and green eyes. Quiet and helpful, tho often one can't quite remember what he looks
like...</font></strong></p>

WWPetersonAutoRepair - The garage sits next to an office, and it's a rather large garage
too, holding between eight and thirteen cars and a motercycle or two. The place has a
reputation for being odd, but fast and doers of good work. Also a bit pricey, but, well,
what can you do? It is especially known for modifications done to cars, including making
them environmentally safe, getting better mileage, and...other modifications.<br>
Thomas - Thomas is British, blonde, and obsessed with looking at himself in a
mirror...particularly his hair. He sits behind the counter, taking payment, getting info
on what needs to be done on the cars, and taking phone calls when he isn't busy with his
hair.</font></strong></p>

RbN - The window has an assortment of stuff, most of which would throw off an actual
practitioner. For example, more crystals than Shirley Miclean has. Inside is an assortment
of books, tarot cards, candles, holders, crystals, jewlery, assorted chachkas, and all
kinds of other stuff. There's a curtain over the door to the back, and Daniel tends to sit
behind the glass-topped counter, shuffling tarot cards. Inside the case is the nicer
jewelery and knives and such things. The door jingles as it opens. There are usually
between 5-11 cats around the store. Reputation: 3.<br>
<em>This is a PC owned room and should only be opened by WWDanielOoH and i3rokenvovvs.</em></font></strong></p>

- The club is a nice local spot. There isn't much of a line, just a few people, but a
bouncer is at the door anyway. Inside, 15 steps lead down to the floor. There's a bar
against the wall, and in that area are some tables and chairs. Beyond that is the dance
floor where there is a stage for live performances. Today there's a local band playing
some fairly modern stuff. They're not half-bad, and the place doesn't water down the
drinks, so it does pretty well. <br>
Al - Al is the bartender. He serves drinks and breaks up fights. Most people do&nbsp; not
fuck with Al, because pissing him off could cause your skull to develop a leak. He's 6'11
and has arms like tree trunks. <br>
Bouncers - There are two bouncers at the door, one of whom is monosyllibic. They do their
jobs well and are not above bribes. </font></strong></p>

WWRavenspointMallRbN - The mall is a large, rather stereotypical mall. Some differances
from most malls are that it contains all of the following: a laser tag area, a carousel,
and an efficiant customer service center. Eat at the food court, shop at the many stores,
gaze at the pretty things in the high-priced jewelery stores... the mall has it all
(almost). So come down, enjoy, have fun, use the parking lot! Open until midnight through
October!</font></strong></p>

WWRavenspointGeneral - Ravenspoint general is one of the local hospitals. It is neutral
religous-wise, and has rather nice facilities as well as a highly-trained staff. Rumors
abound of miracle-workers, and patients do seem to heal fast... but this is probably all
just some silly rumor. Who knows the truth?</font></strong></p>

crockpots always full and the grill and deepfrier and broiler are always ready.</font></strong></p>

art, with the current japanese babyvoice girl of the week crooning softly in a vaugely
musak-ish way for background music. cook and manager are slightly pained by the decor but
no one else seems to notice and the owner don't know the difference between chinese and
japanese. </font></strong></p>
