<p align="left">A Note to all Rafter Leapers - THERE ARE NO OPEN BEAMS!!&nbsp; If you jump
in the rafters in this in and you are more than 1 ft tall, you are going to brain yourself
pretty good.&nbsp; The 2nd floor is making a ceiling to the tavern and resteraunt area of
the in.&nbsp; If you start leaping around in the rafers, you are going to encounter
laughter and ridicule if you do not heed the 'no rafter' warning.&nbsp; If you want to
jump in the rafters, try the barn.&nbsp; No one serves drinks there, however.</p>

<p align="left">There is always at LEAST one bouncer on duty at any given time. &nbsp;
Don't make him or her come and get you.</p>

<p align="left">NO ONE but staff is allowed in the Kitchen unless being escourted thru by
one of the staff.&nbsp; Don't break the rule or the Kitchen staff will assume you are the
latest food delivery.&nbsp; Don't try the patience of the Head Cook, Bill.&nbsp; He
demands privacy when he's cooking.</p>

<p align="left">Floors are sturdy wood planking, sanded smooth.&nbsp; No rushes on the
floor.&nbsp; Walls are stone.&nbsp; There are, for those of you who see magical writings, <strong>invisible</strong>
runes inscribed on all the windows (all windows come equipped with sturdy shutters) and
over all the lintels.&nbsp; </p>

</font><font FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="2" color="#804040">in the dragon gate area,
copper peices are divided into 10 bits.&nbsp;&nbsp; one gold is equal to 20 silvers is
equal to 200 coppers. to remember it easily, think of a copper peice as a dime, a silver
as a buck, and a gold as 20 bucks.&nbsp; <em>HOWEVER, value is a little different when you
consider what it will buy. in those terms, since a copper will buy quite a bit compared to
our modern dime, you might want to think of a copper as being around a dollar in value. </em></font><font
