<p align="center"><strong>A Mystery....</strong></p>

<p align="center"><strong>by Jack of Swords.</strong></p>

<p align="left"><strong>I have been hunting around the tower in North Karana with my rogue
for several levels now, and every time I passed by the two empty farms behind the tower I
would hear humanoid footsteps. They concentrated in one particular spot, but there was
never anything visible there. I did a thorough check of the buildings and roofs in the
vicinity but never found anything, so finally I decided to bring in my wizard.<br>
Shaidaxi is only level 8, but he has See Invisible and a radiating AE spell, Numbing cold.
With another young Wyrm, Siaballa, for a witness and invis'er, I ran down to NK to check
it out. Found the spot, and Siaballa told me that she could hear the footsteps too, though
barely; she had her music on, while I always turn mine off. See Invis turned up nothing,
so I started casting my AE.</strong></p>

<p align="left"><strong>The first picture posted here is what I saw from the first cast
onward.</strong></p>

<p align="left"><strong>The second picture is a top-view screenshot of a sort of control
group for the experiment. There was nothing in radiating range. This shows how the spell
looks when there is nothing nearby.</strong></p>

<p align="left"><strong>The third picture is another control group, to illustrate how the
spell looks when there is something in range.<br>
</strong></p>

<p align="left"><strong>The fourth picture is a top view of the castings in North Karana.
There is no visible target, but the spell reacts in exactly the same way that it would if
there was one. The footstep sounds did not stop, and nothing attacked me.</strong></p>

<p align="center"><strong>Here is Saidaxi casting an area effect spell with no target in
range. </strong></p>

<p align="center"><strong>Finally - here is Shaidaxi casting on... nothing visible.</strong></p>
