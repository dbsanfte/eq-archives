<p align="center"><big><strong>Harrassment and annoying people and trying to lure people
out of a party with promises of gifts and power leveling.&nbsp; Reported by Razorclaw</strong></big></p>
<font face="verdana, arial, helvetica" size="2">

<p><strong>Hunting in Najena, Razorclaw, Pendra, Hackina, Wynne and Keef were all alone
except for some fella named Kormer. Kormer shouts 'I'm camping the &lt;mumblemumble&gt;
room!' (i've no memory of what room it is - doesn't really matter.) so Razorclaw shouts
'Good for you!' in sort of a 'Yay, we don't care, have fun' kind of spirit. <br>
Next thing she knows, the person is calling the group Noobs, berating them for being
noobs, and generally harrassing everyone in both tells and shout. he finally showed up and
actually started trying to entice some of the group away from the rest with promises of
power leveling, so he could break up the group. All the time in tells to razorclaw, with
foul language and nasty remarks - Razorclaw pointed out she could insult him just fine by
telling the truth and without foul language - he was a crybaby and was hunting alone
because he had no friends and could not get a group. Hackina, who he was trying to entice
away, pointed out to the dim fellow that all of us were in teh same guild except keef, and
all of us were freinds real life, not just everquest, and we were not going to turn on
each other nomatter what he did or said. I took him off ignore long enough to tell the
fellow we were all laughing at him in group chat because he was behaving like such a
pathetic loser. None of us would duel him. We pretty much ignored him and chatted amongst
ourselves. <br>
<br>
This apparently incensed the fellow. I had put him on ignore, so he pestered wynne for the
guildmaster's name. Wynne was too busy - we were hunting - to bother and ignored him.
Finally he pestered someone else in who'd shown up in Najena to hunt,&nbsp; to pester me
for jabbuk's name. <br>
<br>
What's especially sad is he's a member of the Anklebiter's brigade, and that used to be
run by Ichiban, who I know from when i first started playing, but who has since apparently
gone on. Unless there is another anklebiter's brigade. <br>
<br>
Anyway... don't fail to call him Crybaby Kormer if you hear him on one of his shout/whine
tirades, and send him a big kiss from Razorclaw. </strong><br>

like that. She is a female monk with a guild called Valkyries of Norrath. Now I know
several peeps in that guild (Twin being a former member and all) but this chick just got
the best of me last night. <br>
I popped on as Alpha just to get him to Tox for a trip out (and to pick up some stuff from
Tennetty). Alpha was at cat town and was sowless so the run to the warrens was going to be
long and deadly. I gave a shout looking for a sow but no takers. That is when I noticed a
druid standing near the road by cat town. I asked him if I could please have a sow but he
did not respond (weras was his name). Tiatally tells me he is afk at the moment that is
why he did not respond. I thank her for her info and then ask her if he was going to be
afk long. If not I will wait for him to ask a sow but if he was to be long I will look
elsewhere and maybe try the run without sow. I did not think that was being rude, mean and
demanding but let me tell you she blew her stack at me. She kept calling me names telling
me how dare I think of her hubby (ingame hubby) as nothing more that a sow whore for my
private use and to hell with me for his afk inconveniencing me. <br>
Now I do not beleave I said any such thing. I meerly asked if he was to be long afk, if
not I would wait to ask for a sow but if so I would chance the run without. Needless to
say I try the run without sow and nearly got myself eaten. I made it back to cat town with
0 mana and less then a bub of health and a very angry (and still very much alive) tiger on
my butt. She was kind enough to kill it for me with Weras's help but then told him not to
heal me nor sow me as I was rude and demanding (the bitch). </font><u><em><font

</font><strong><big>Jabbuk</big></strong></p>

<p><strong><font face="verdana, arial, helvetica" size="2">A young barbarian warrior named
Falccorr. he said he had 200p to spend to equip himself. I was on Macflies selling low end
items. I put several items into the trade window for him to look at. he picked what he
wanted and could afford I went to hit cancel to end the trade so I could put his items in
the block and by mistake I hit trade. I hit cancel right away but he was faster then I was
and got all the items. I send to him that it was a mistake on my part to please return the
items. He laughed at me, sat and logged out. <br>
Now I seen his guild tag (Knights of Winter) so bought up the guild to see who was in
there. Nobody I knew but I did see a 49th lvl player so dropped him a tell about what had
happen. He said he was an officer and that he was an officer and that he would pass this
on to the GM and gave me the GMs name. <br>
The other day while I was hunting with Morley I got a tell asking for Macflies (they just
picked someone in our guild to ask and he just happen to be me), I told him that Mac was
my bank toon and he asked me to hold on as the GM wanted to speak to me. <br>
he and I talked (he was on one of his other toons) about what had happen. I told him that
I did not have a problem with the officer I had 1st spoke to (which is what he thought) I
told him I had a problem with thieves. he told me that this Falccorr was nolonger a member
of the Knights and asks what is was I lost as he would see if he could replace it. I told
him I will eat the lost (no more then 1k). He wanted to ensure that the Knights did not
have a problem with Wyrmshadow in anyway over this. I ensured him that we did not and will
hold hold the whole guild in contempt over the actions of one as long as something was
done about it. And I believe that they handled it properly. <br>
So if you see someone named Falccorr it is guild law now that he is not to be healed,
TPed, SoWed, Buffed, or anything what so ever. As for the guild Knights of Winter they are
not to be held to the same restrictions as Falccorr. Not necessary to go out of your way
to help them but they are to be treated as any other guild on Xegony. If we find out that
Falccorr is still a member..well then..... But I am sure the GM spoke the truth
so.........</font></strong></p>

<p><strong><font face="verdana, arial, helvetica" size="2">Hunting in OT with Hemie in a
nice group. We had room for one more and this mage named Jeffer for the guild Soul
Suvivers asked to join so we let him. Well he sat down and for atleast 6 fights never cast
a spell nor sent his pet in, nothing. So we told him to do something next fight or he is
out. Well poof he is removed. Now about 5 mins later he must have come back to his
computer and noticed he nolonger was sponging exp from us and got mad. We were fighting a
few things when he ran around and grabbed 2 knights and trained them right to us. Now we
were fighting 2 knights all ready so did not move nor break our fight to fight the
newcomers. Now the only thing that was good about this was that the 2 knights he trained
on us did not argo on us as they were busy beating on him. Now you know what happen
next... he died and we fought his 2 as well as our 2. But we won with no deaths. So now he
comes back to his corpses but does not loot it instead just sits there spamming us with
'dippy' in tells. I have no idea what is was meant to mean. &quot;dippy&quot;..
&quot;dippy&quot;.. &quot;dippy&quot;..?? So I said &quot;do da day&quot; after one of his
dippys. Well he just kept on spamming us and spamming us so we had our SK (who was
pulling) pull a knight right to his as he sat on his corpse and then FD so it would attack
him. <img alt src="smile.gif" border="0" width="15" height="15"> The damm knight ran right to us and attacked us
instead. But then as we were fighting the knight a cockitrice ran over and in just a few
pecks killed him again. And needless to say he blamed us for it. I get several tells from
his guild about it asking for the name of our GM to complain to . I told them that I was
the GM just playing an alt and then told thier officer what had happen he explained that
this Jeffer is either alittle kid or retarted (I am thinking a bit of both) and that he
would like to apologize to me, my group and the guild for the actions of Jeffer. <br>
So if you are out there and see a mage named Jeffer do not group with him. From what I
learned that night he has done this several times during the week and is known for joining
a group going AFK, sucking exp and doing nothing to help the group at all. Then bitching
when he is removed from the group for not fighting...</font></strong></p>

<p align="center"><strong><font face="verdana, arial, helvetica" size="2">This is actually
a culmination of several experiences of this particular guy, not just one event that made
me write this rant. Saw him lfg in DL the other day and it reminded me that he's taking
too much of his own crack. <br>
<br>
The subject is one Morfeis Corpse, currently 36 enchanter and likely to stay that way for
a while. His name is extremely apt. I've tripped over his various small corpses in
Highkeep, Crystal Caverns and now in the Dreadlands. It was in DL though that I actually
grouped with him (unless my mind has merely mercifully blotted out the memory of working
with him before). <br>
<br>
Let me just say that I've never seen someone die so often due to his own stupidity when
surrounded by a full group trying to save him. We were working from the dirt off the North
Wall (this won't mean much to the folks who haven't hunted in DL, let's just say it's
'relatively' safe and fairly close to the zone, yet still being close to stuff to pull;
wanderers rarely come right up to us). <br>
<br>
Now, for one thing, everyone in the group was 40+ except him...I was at least 44 because
that's when I went to DL. He was probably 35 or 36, and I'd say the leader only let him in
because he's an enchanter. We had a druid, we had tanks of various sorts--I remember a
ranger, a monk and a paladin--we had me, and of course him. <br>
<br>
I don't remember if it was a multiple pull or a single; either way, he got a mob on him.
Now, the chanters I've worked with so far in DL are relatively sane; they run around, but
in our general vicinity so the tanks can try to whack the critter and the rooting/snaring
people can try to root/snare it. Well, as soon as it got on him he bolts for the
zone...right out of range of the druid who was trying to heal him, and outdistancing us
tanks because he took off so fast (we were confused). Out of range of LoH too, according
to the pally later. So everyone chases him, the casters can't cast because they're trying
to stay in range, the tanks are jumping like frogs trying to close the distance to get the
critter, and wham...gnomey dies in front of the KC entrance. <br>
<br>
And then he died where he'd been bound through some mishap...he'd been doing something
while awaiting rez, we'd told him he was getting rez, and yet he ran off somewhere
dangerous and got killed. /em shakes his head. <br>
<br>
And then we rezzed him in the KC entrance, and a short time later a drolvarg got trained
through us and we tried to save him but he didn't move and got splattered about two feet
from the zone line. <br>
<br>
Then he left, and we were all very relieved. <br>
<br>
Sooooooo just a public service announcement; if a gnome named Morfeis wants to be your
chanter, don't let him! Especially not if he's a good 5-10 levels below most people in the
zone but still wants to hunt there (the lowest I've grouped with in DL beside him was a 38
cleric...the others have all been at least 40). <br>
<br>
/em shoos Morfeis back to CC.</font></strong></p>

<strong><big>Furiel</big></strong><font face="verdana, arial, helvetica" size="2"><b><br>
</b><strong>Second in our installment of stupid people today is a barbarian shaman named
Spyco Mantis, also met in the Dreadlands. Thankfully this one did not manage to die on us
or kill us. However... <br>
<br>
I get invited into a group. Me, another rogue, a paladin, a cleric, a ranger. Spyco sends
out his lfg message, we scoop him up because tanks love haste, mmmm haste. And that sow
thing is nice too. <br>
<br>
First inkling of trouble: the cleric (Kititier, who let me be pecked to death by an evil
chicken but we had forgotten he was afk so I forgive him...otherwise, he's good) asked him
when he had quit Kit's guild. Spyco says a couple weeks ago, then mentions that he joined
and quit the Silent Majority then joined this new one that he's in (Dal Ruadha...I might
keep track of him just to see how many guilds he goes through). Reminded me of Mammiss the
guildhopper, which is a bad association. <br>
<br>
So we get set up, he starts meditating, we start pulling. We were working pretty quickly
so we just asked for haste and sow to start with. He did those upon request. We pull, we
pull, no more buffs appear in our buff bars, there are a few scattered requests for buffs
but they never materialize. However, we have to pull the critters off him more than once
because he's spending his mana nuking. <br>
<br>
A giant drops a giant lord's tunic, he whines and whines about how he needs money, a
couple of us abstain from the roll, he loses and whines. Another drops, the ones that
abstained and the winner stay out of it, we roll, he loses, he whines. <br>
<br>
Every time a critter drops, he loots it...he follows the tanks into battle just so he can
be up close to loot. <br>
<br>
He does not buff. He does not debuff. He sows, hastes and nukes. He calls himself a
'battle-shaman'. Eventually the other rogue, who was the leader, gets sick of his constant
looting, whining and nuking and asks him how much he bought this character for. They argue
argue argue. During the argument he disbands and runs off shouting lfg. <br>
<br>
I did not see one buff of any sort from him that was not sow or haste. We had to repeat
requests for both of those many times, and he often went oom from nuking. <br>
<br>
At the end, after he'd left, Kititier expressed embarassment that he was ever in his guild
at all. We got a new shaman some time later and my buff box was absolutely full. We were
all quite relieved. <br>
<br>
So there's another on the do-not-group-with list.</strong></font></p>

<p><strong><font face="verdana, arial, helvetica" size="2">Okay - so, as most of you know
I have a new character whom has been dubed Swiftz, a rogue. Well, I was in WC partnered up
with a druid, I believe we were both lvl 13 or 14. Well, things got a bit hairy and we
were forced to flee. <br>
<br>
Well, so I ran to the EC zone with two dervs on me. He ran to the guards at the checkpoint
with one derv on him. While on my way to the zone I noticed his life bar went purple,
opps. Before I got to the zone line a druid tagged me with a sow, so instead of zoning I
just kited the remaining dervs shrunkens. Which really works well cause some reason I
either get a crit hit for 15 or a deadly hit for 30, never anything lower less I miss. BUT
ANYWAY. After I finished I went to the checkpoint. And noticed the guards where dead. <br>
<br>
SO. I shouted something tot the effect. <br>
<br>
&quot;Gawd why do you people have to kill both guards?! Leave one for us lowbies who rely
on them to save our hides from time to time. Thanks to you Maelian is dead, and I am close
to it.&quot; <br>
<br>
Well then miss Nerya the Druid shouted back. <br>
<br>
&quot;Good I am glade he&#146;s dead! And I hope you die too!&quot; <br>
<br>
I replied, &quot;Jerk&quot; <br>
<br>
&quot;I&#146;m not a Jerk,&quot; stated Nerya. <br>
<br>
I left it at that, and then I looked for her lvl. The guards in WC are lvl 33 and she was
50 if I recall correctly. So killing the guards in the first place are quite pointless. <br>
<br>
The next day I was soloing in WC going for my 15th lvl. A HG was sighted and people where
shout the location so someone could take care o fit. Well apparently she was kiting it.
And every time some said &quot;HG by Dervs&quot; or &quot;HG up&quot; or &quot;Anyone on
HG&quot; She would reply very rudely with &quot;I&#146;m on the hill giant moron.&quot; or
&quot;Are you stupid? I am already on the HG!&quot; <br>
<br>
Well I can&#146;t get onto EQ cause this stupid patch thing today; friggen 4 hours of
download and the servers are still down! Anyway to sum it all up Nerya is extremely rude,
and uh... yea.</font></strong></p>

I invited her and she participated in one fight, then FD'd and went afk to do something in

A little later, the group upstairs in Highkeep got in an ooc argument with her because she
had gone afk during a fight or something and died, and they too accused her of

<p>Cheers to Rancorous</b></font> </p>

<p><font face="verdana, arial, helvetica" size="2">I'm not sure who or what this guy is,
but in Crystal Caverns last night when myself and three of my party members drowned way
out in the middle of nowhere (a tunnel that the spider queen swam into while escaping), he
dropped what he was doing and swam out and retrieved all four of our corpses without
asking for compensation and providing amusing banter in /ooc the whole time. I thought he
deserved a mention here, since otherwise I'd have been begging waterstones and trying to
sneak-swim to get the corpses, which at sneak speed would have taken a looooooooooong
time. Three cheers for Rancorous!</font></p>

<p><strong><font face="verdana, arial, helvetica" size="2">Yshva a 52 cleric from the
Deffenders of Fay has earned our respect! Tonight Me, Valius, Alphaflies and Curley were
hunting in da new zone, Stonebrunt Mountains, and right as we were looking for a last pull
of the night.... well you know how it goes, we all, cept Alpha, died. <br>
<br>
So we brush off our clothes lick our wounds and regroup in the cat village. Yshva offered
to exp rez us all!! Unfortunately Alpha had all ready done a rez to Curley and Valius so
she was not able to exp rez them =( <br>
<br>
Okay so, a tried cleric exp rez us, so what Clerics are greedy and will do that any day
for coin right? Wrong. I offered her all my plat and a Giant Lord's Tunic for helping us
and she turned it down and said no payment needed, that she liked to help people who helps
others! <br>
<br>
Five stars for Yshva! <img alt src="tongue.gif" border="0" width="15" height="15"></font></strong></p>

<p><strong><font face="verdana, arial, helvetica" size="2">I was sitting and medding at
the Edge of the Lake of Ill Omen this morning, while patiently fighting tigresses,
flunkies, and skirmishers. Full of mana, I stood up and saw a WoodElf Babe in Ry'Gorr
armour looking at me before she ran off. I went hunting and was midpull before I realized
I had a whole slew of buffs that I hadn't had before. So, I sent off a quick tell to say
thank you belatedly. She chuckled and told me I was welcome. <br>
A couple minutes later, I got another reply asking if I'd like her to watch over me while
I fought, as she was at loose ends. I said 'sure', and we went over to the Goblin fortress
near the river. With her pulling, I fought a long string of blue, white, yellow, and red
gobbies -- and went straight from 19 to 21, with barely a nod at 20!!!! Woohoo!! Didn't
even break to go train Double Attack. <img alt src="tongue.gif" border="0" width="15" height="15"> I even managed
to max Archery at 105 before dinging to 21. <br>
<br>
So if you see Shay AmberMist , 51st Woodelf Rangergirl of the Ring of Fate, or her alt
Benevolent Seraphym, Darkelf Cleric, buff her hard for me!!!!!! <br>
