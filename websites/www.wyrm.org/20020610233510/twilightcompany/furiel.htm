  <p><strong><big><font face="Papyrus">Travel Journal: Spelunking in the Caverns</font></big></strong></p>
  <p><strong><font face="Papyrus">We call it 'the well' or 'the pit' or 'the hole'. Whatever
  you want to term it, it's the entryway to get down to the poor isolated dwarves of
  Froststone, who somehow got themselves beaten down into a tiny mining establishment under
  the Eastern Wastes. Maybe they used to own the fort up top that the orcs now fill to the
  brim, but I don't know...the Froststone dwarves aren't really that friendly. <br>
  <br>
  The well is huge...deep, sparkling and frosted everywhere with ice bridges and the
  constant sound of meltwater. The first time I entered, through the magic crystal hidden in
  the depths of the orc fort, I was companion to a druid and a few other usual hunting
  partners so we floated down casually, past the watchmen to the bottom, and strolled out of
  the vast dark mining tunnels into the icy halls of the dwarf town. <br>
  <br>
  More usual is what I do with my monk friend Geirk, when we've gone out into the open air
  and decided to come back in; he flings himself off the top of the well with typical
  monkish abandon, bouncing a couple times off walls and bridges and whatnot, and while he's
  distracting the orcs I fall from bridge to bridge like a shadow. It works rather well. The
  orcs never have a problem believing that the crazy human who just bounced off six bridges
  and slammed into the bottom is dead, not just playing at it. He's tried to get me to jump
  straight down, but--heh--Teir'Dal legs aren't made to absorb that kind of impact. <br>
  <br>
  For boring people who don't have the guts to jump, there are always the many passageways
  that I think eventually lead down to the bottom of the well... I've never managed to
  untangle all the paths, myself. <br>
  <br>
  The caverns are really a gorgeous place. Outcroppings of crystal grow through the ice,
  clear and blue and occasionally vibrantly pink, and they seem to hum to some unknown
  vibration every now and then. Everything is vertical; the well spirals down to sit mostly
  on top of the dwarf town, which in turn settles above another nest of tunnels that reach
  deeper into the icy earth to the unclaimed territory of monstrous creatures. Echoes from
  above drift down constantly, and even whispers can sound like shouts in the strange cold
  chambers. <br>
  <br>
  Once, the dwarf influence spread further out, I think. The guards talk about defending the
  town from the horrors below, and I have seen those: strange creatures mimicking
  stalagmites but with tentacles and gaping maws, horrid little lizard creatures that make
  noise far beyond their size, and a myriad of spiders that are actually rather pretty with
  their luminous crystalline bodies. Less hostile than these are the geonids, humanoid in
  shape but stone and crystal in composition. It is a little unnerving to watch them lift
  off the crystals that seemed to be their heads, but I've never been up on my monster
  anatomy. <br>
  <br>
  In a way, it's similar to Highkeep, only more grim. The Froststone population is
  dwindling; it would likely already be gone if it were made from a shorter-lived race.
  There are no children, only hard-faced warriors and grieving widows of those who went
  above, and with the assault on two fronts I can not see how they will survive long. This
  is likely why they provide shelter, if not friendly faces, to so many adventurers. Without
  us, perhaps, they would have been overwhelmed. <br>
  <br>
  The tale I wish to tell is that of some of the great horrors down below.</font></strong></p>

  <p><strong><font face="Papyrus">&nbsp;</font></strong></p>
  <p><strong><font face="Papyrus">Beyond the dwarf town is a tunnel that descends into the
  icy depths, winding about until it comes into an open place, where a broken bridge spans a
  creek and an abandoned mining tent still stands, empty. Stalagmite terrors stand like
  sentinels in the far corners and the lizardlike crawlers snap from the water, but the gap
  in the bridge is not too far to jump and these creatures do not attack unless you get too
  close. Across the bridge, an archway leads to another over-water path that looks to be
  made of the ribcage of some great beast, possibly a dragon, though it must have died long
  ago to be entombed under so much ice as this. Evidence that the dwarven civilization
  stretched further is there beyond the dragon bones, in a carved stairway to what might
  have once been a grand hall. Now, the far end of that is marred by encroaching ice and the
  burrow-holes that the monsters have made through it. <br>
  <br>
  There are three passageways. The far right leads to the geonid gathering, and beyond them
  up into sunlight once more. The central passage seems to descend deep into a spider-hive,
  for there are always crystalline insects pouring out of it. The far left, which my party
  followed in the time I recall now, is populated heavily by the stalagmite creatures, as if
  they too came up from some deeper place in the earth, perhaps after miners opened the
  wrong cave. <br>
  <br>
  Most of these creatures are small, and posed little problem for our group as it was:
  Kairie, the lady druid; Geirk, my constant companion the dress-wearing monkey; Cryoheart,
  the elven cleric whose blue-white armor so matched the surroundings; Macx, the
  dress-wearing lizard (which isn't quite so entertaining because lizards don't seem to care
  if they wear dresses); and Wareen, a young ranger first scouting the area under our care.
  I don't know why I surround myself with elves and monks, I just do. <br>
  <br>
  We fought our way deeper into the tunnels and indeed found a cavern that seemed like it
  might have housed the terrors once, before the miners sadly broke through the ice to
  discover it. We did well picking them off one at a time, the little things not causing
  much trouble with our spellwork and quick blades (or fists, I suppose the monks did
  contribute to the killing). <br>
  <br>
  Then we found trouble, or rather it found us. We'd been resting and tossing dice about
  while the casters were deep in meditation, when suddenly huge tentacles were lashing among
  us. Where the normal terrors came up to my chest, this creature towered over the human and
  high elf easily, with a maw that could have fit me in without ever needing to bite. We
  scrambled to our feet to fight, and though it was a horrid creature--hollow as we found
  when we cut into it at the end--it fell, though not without costing us much in blood and
  mana. <br>
  <br>
  Only moments later, another massive terror lurched out of the cavern. This one was
  different, darker, and where its tentacles lashed out they seemed to draw life away from
  the victim. While our attention was busy with this one, a third appeared and attached
  itself to first our cleric, and when we turned on it--managing somehow to pull it off in
  time--the life-leeching terror attacked the druid Kairie. She fell too fast for us to
  save, and after her went Geirk, down under the onslaught of razor tentacles and not just
  faking it that time. The life-leech bled its last, but the third monster was back on the
  cleric; we fighters tore at it enough for him to gate away, then stood toe to tentacle
  with the creature desperately until it finally tried to slither away. It did not get far. <br>
  <br>
  I brought the bodies back to town while Cryoheart was navigating his way down the well and
  Macx and Wareen were resting in a safe area. The ranger decided to try to return, though,
  and before any of the rest of us could get to him a terror had latched onto him and sent
  his soul back to the Faydark. When we all finally returned to town, ragged and tired, we
  still felt the need to celebrate. Certainly we had killed the rulers, the hive-parents,
  the big nasties of tentacle-kind. <br>
  <br>
  Of course that wasn't so, but it was still a hell of a rush. <br>
  <br>
  ((/ooc That actually happened...a hollow crystal, a life leech and another hollow crystal
  [all level 38 I think] popped in rapid succession and added onto our combat. Three named
  critters popping in the same spot one after the other....it was scary.)) <br>
  <br>
  Having defeated the tentacle menace--or at least too traumatized to head that way again
  for a while--we turned our sights to the spider cave.</font></strong></p>

  <p><strong><font face="Papyrus">&nbsp;</font></strong><i></p>
  <p><font face="Papyrus">Posted by Furiel on 08-31-2001 10:58 PM:</i> </font></p>
  <p><strong><font face="Papyrus">&nbsp;</font></strong></p>
  <p><strong><font face="Papyrus">Now I'm glad my folk don't worship spiders as some of our
  kin from elsewhere do, or this would have been a much worse time than it already was. From
  the ice barrier, the tunnel snaked through solid white, though not untouched by dwarven
  hands; after spearing spiders where they had settled here and there, we came upon a room
  with an underground stream and another bridge, this one still whole. Beyond the bridge was
  an archway, and as we fought our way toward that we heard stranger noises than what we had
  come to expect from the spiders and the occasional ugly lizard that decided to tag along. <br>
  <br>
  The old group had split for a bit, so this party was new and consisted of myself, a
  barbarian warrioress, a ranger and druid, the lizard monk Macx and the cleric Cryoheart.
  As the sneaky one of the group, I was elected to go take a look. <br>
  <br>
  The archway led into a short, cornered tunnel and then widened again abruptly into a great
  cavern tapestried with webbing. The grandest of them covered the far wall, but there did
  not seem to be any exit or entry beyond the way we came. Separating my position from that
  web was water, a cold still ring of it surrounding a raised platform of ice upon which the
  source of that sound was perched. He--at least I think it was a he--was at rest, seeming
  bored and with a crystalline blade in his hand, but the sword wasn't what got my attention
  even though it was pretty and all. What disturbed me was that while he had the upper body
  of an elf--sort of murky greyish, but recognizeably elfin--his lower body was a huge,
  hideously mottled spider. <br>
  <br>
  I relayed this information back to the crew and, though surprised, they decided we should
  go ahead with the attack. We took up positions in the little hallway while the warrior
  drew our prey to us and set to work. <br>
  <br>
  The hallway, as I said, was not a large thing, and in my efforts to get behind the
  elf-spider I was forced onto the ledge of it, my heels out over the water. The acoustics
  of the place were quite good enough to hear the lizards gnashing and churning down there,
  just waiting for me to lose my footing. I was yelling at my companions to back up so I
  could actually stand straight when the warrioress suddenly gaped and pointed behind me. <br>
  <br>
  Let me tell you that I gained a new appreciation for the pain of all my victims when Queen
  Dracnia's clawed leg went into my back. <br>
  <br>
  Thankfully, instinct takes over where pain eradicates thought, so I was on the ground
  scrambling between clacking legs and getting myself the hell away from the new spider
  before I even recovered from the shock. She was big, much bigger than the male that went
  down even as she surged into the tunnel, and beautiful in a strange way, her flesh and
  hair a rosy grey-pink except for the virulent red hourglass on her stomach. Her legtips
  shattered the ice where they struck. <br>
  <br>
  At first it appeared that we were doing alright; once the barbarian had caught her
  attention, I slipped back to my spot at the rear. But she had crossed through the water to
  get to us, and so did the little spiders that rushed out of the darkness to join in the
  fight, and soon the crawler lizards decided to investigate the blood-scent that had filled
  the cavern. And for all her beauty, that red hourglass was there for a reason; first the
  cleric fell to a swarm of little spiders, then one by one we fell either to poison from
  her sharp legs or to the claws and fangs of the lizards and spiders. There was nowhere to
  run, but we tried. I made it nearly to the end of the spider hall before I couldn't run
  any further; our only survivor was the monk. <br>
  <br>
  After fuming in Highkeep for a while before I could be summoned back to myself, I had
  decided that there would be revenge, though the others were discouraged.</font></strong></p>

  <p><strong><font face="Papyrus">&nbsp;</font></strong></p>
  <p><strong><font face="Papyrus">And revenge there was. When enough had gathered to make
  another attempt--the cleric and barbarian warrioress and myself joined by another warrior
  woman, this time a dark elf, as well as a wizard and a druid--we trekked down into the
  white hell again and hacked our way into the spider tunnel. All the queen's little
  broodlings rushed up to meet us but as before they proved only a slight problem. <br>
  <br>
  We fought down to the bridge with barely more than a scratch among us, and I slipped up to
  the cavern to take a peek inside. The Queen had vacated the area, likely to lick her
  wounds since we had managed to make a decent dent in her side before we fell, so we
  cleared out the spiders that were wandering around the ice dais and settled in to wait. <br>
  <br>
  Apparently she had not gone far, or the screams of her little followers reached her ears
  even in the depths, because soon enough there she was again, this time stepping into a
  cleared room with rested, unengaged and unwounded foes prepared for her. She charged us
  once more, reckless, obviously thinking we were easy prey because she had taken a few of
  us before, but the newcomers were no slackers and a wizard's firepower is not to be
  underestimated. She slashed at us with her poisoned claws and I felt the sting, worse than
  any other pain I've felt, as if searing metal had been poured into my veins...and it stuck
  longer than anything I'd ever been stung by, but by the time it had faded the Queen was
  dead, collapsed in a jumble of legs and ichor and spent webbing, and not one of us had
  fallen. <br>
  <br>
  This is not to say that we didn't bleed everywhere or have some nice poison-induced
  hallucinations, but we survived and dragged our beat-up selves back to the dwarf town in
  triumph. <br>
  <br>
  I wandered down there again a little later, just to see how the spider hive was going now
  that its queen was gone. I poked my head around the corner to check on the dais room and
  there she was...the lady herself, with only slightly different features and that brilliant
  crimson hourglass standing out like blood on her dusty flesh. Her sister, or her daughter
  perhaps. I don't doubt now that there is a brood of these creatures, the queens and the
  male subordinates, somewhere deeper below. Somehow, I doubt we'll ever be truly rid of
  them.</font></strong></p>

  <p><font face="Papyrus">Posted by Furiel on 09-03-2001 07:01 PM:</i> </font></p>
  <p><strong><font face="Papyrus">&nbsp;</font></strong></p>
  <p><strong><font face="Papyrus">An addendum must needs be made now. My companions and I
  ventured back into the lair of the crystal spiders just last night in an effort to rid the
  land of another spider queen, and what we found surprised us. There is indeed another
  entrance/exit from that particular room. We found this much to our dismay, embarassment
  and ultimately death. Of course, this happens a lot. <br>
  <br>
  Everything was going as planned. We cleared the area of little spiders and were more than
  prepared for the Queen. Obligingly, she crawled out of wherever she lairs--which we
  learned soon after--and charged us, throwing about her poison and her massive pink body in
  the usual way. Her threashings were to no avail against us, so that even though I was the
  eldest of the group and a few others were barely within range to group with me, we soon
  had her running with nary a lost life and very little of our blood spilt. that was when
  the trouble started. <br>
  <br>
  At least two of our number tried to root her in place, but it would not stick. Bleeding
  ichor, she dove into the cold waters that surround her dais, and all of us save the cleric
  and shadowknight--wise fellows as we'll see--dove after her. We struck and struck
  underwater but she was too fast for us, and led us to a tunnel that twisted and turned
  away from the dais room. <br>
  <br>
  Now, I have seen various underwater tunnels in this place, and they never seem to be very
  long, so with great bravado we all swam in after her, determined that she must die before
  she reached the end and brought other creatures down upon us. So we swam, and slashed, and
  swam, and pierced, and swam, and bashed, and swam and swam and swam and realized that the
  tunnel was not ending and it did not seem like to do so soon! But the Queen was still
  alive and staggering before us, the carrot dangling ahead that lead us to our doom, and by
  the time we regained our senses to realize we had to turn back it was far too late. I was
  in the lead, and my air gave out first. The others followed soon after, four of us in all.
  <br>
  <br>
  I said it was embarassing at the start, now didn't I. <br>
  <br>
  Thankfully, though the shadowknight who stayed above could not escape the spiders, our
  cleric managed to gate out when he realised we could not return. He enlisted the aid of an
  elder adventurer--a shadowknight or necromancer I believe, though I never saw him--to go
  down with a breathing spell and invisibiility and pull all our sorry carcasses up. And I
  have decided that one day I will make that dive again, with waterstones galore, and see
  where that tunnel leads. <br>

<p><strong><font face="Papyrus"><big>Prologue </big><br>
<br>
<br>
It was a quiet night in the Broken Glacier tavern, with not many outlanders crowded up to
the bar alongside the rest of the Thurgadin Coldain. An elven ranger, sodden with good ale
to the point of unconsciousness, was slumped in one corner where the ice dwarves had
chucklingly nudged him so that he would not take up precious bar space. A trio of
Faydwerian dwarves spoke in low tones over perpetually full mugs in another alcove,
occasionally casting suspicious glances toward the pair of adventurers monopolizing the
dartboard, but they made no moves against the two despite their obvious disapproval. <br>
<br>
Velious is a strange place, Furiel thought as he sipped his ale, watching the Kaladim
dwarves out of the corner of one eye and fingering his shurikens. Geirk, decked out in his
new fancy burgundy robe, was taking his turn at the board, sticking blades one by one into
the center of the concentric circles. Scoring had gotten to the point that the one to lose
would have to be the first one not to hit the bull's-eye. It was almost distressing. <br>
<br>
People who would kill me--or try--on any other continent can't raise a finger here, the
rogue thought, trying his best to supress a smirk and avoid unduly inciting the dwarves.
Because the natives accept everyone with the same degree of suspicion. It must be galling
for them to be as distrusted as a dark elf. <br>
<br>
Having sunk the last of his shuriken into the corkboard, the monk turned and bounded back
to the spot Furiel was staking out against the bar, a big grin on his face as he flopped
back into his seat. Somehow he managed to look graceful, which the rogue envied; he
comforted himself with the thought that, really, it was impossible to be graceful in
anything heavier than leather, so it wasn't his fault that he, an elf, couldn't quite
match up in fluidity of motion with a human. Really. No reason to be jealous. <br>
<br>
&quot;Your turn,&quot; Geirk said, waving enthusiastically at the hole-riddled board, and
Furiel grunted and slid out of his seat, adjusting his scaled cloak back over his
shoulders. <br>
<br>
That, and I feel like I'm wearing some older brother's hand-me-downs, the rogue thought as
he presented his left shoulder to the target and flicked the shuriken across his body. It
hit the target between two of the indentations Geirk's blades had made. He shifted stance.
It was important to practice all angles; if he thought it wouldn't be a little too
embarassing, he'd practice while laying down. I may well find myself doing so after a
couple more drinks. <br>
<br>
Geirk cheered drunkenly then flagged down the stumpy bartender for a refill while Furiel
contemplated the board again. His helmet, with its decorative horns and the eye-slits that
made peripheral vision so difficult, was resting on the counter by the monk's elbow, among
the scatter of bottles they had emptied so far that night. There were a few new nicks on
its night-black surface, but that was expected. That was why they were holed up in a
tavern drinking the night away anyway. <br>
<br>
Another shuriken quivered on the board, on the line between the center and an outer ring,
and with a crow of victory the monk sprung up from his seat and wobbled over there to peer
at it. He tilted his head, the clasp that kept his dark hair out of his face in combat
glinting in the dim tavern light. &quot;It's out! I win!&quot; he slurred and turned back
to beam at his friend. Furiel smiled a bit and shrugged. <br>
<br>
&quot;Have a few more of those and you won't even be hitting the board,&quot; he said, and
Geirk grinned. <br>
<br>
&quot;Oh, I think I will.&quot; <br>
<br>
The rogue rolled his eyes theatrically for Geirk's benefit, and that worthy beamed again
in his childlike way and bounced back to the bar. With a sigh, Furiel stepped up to the
dartboard to slip his blades out of the cork, the quirked smile slipping away as well. He
wiped them on the edge of his cloak and secreted them around his person again, then stared
at the marred rings thoughtlessly for a few moments. The alcohol and the mix of a nearby
hearth and the cold, hewn-ice floor was getting to his head. <br>
<br>
How long had it been since he had felt like himself? A while, he mused; when he had
unwoven the stitchings of the cloak the Icepaw gnoll had made for him, when instead of
carrying the blades he had earned in blood he had accepted those of another, greater man.
There was no reason to complain, really. His new things--new to him--were better than the
old, ragged gear he had been carrying from ages. Some came from places he had only ever
heard of. But the cloak was heavy on his shoulders, more than a ruined weight of
blue-green seahorse scales should be, and the other pieces sat no better, as if they truly
had been crafted for a bigger man. <br>
<br>
Just another facet of the jewel-toned unease his life had become recently. The time was
coming where he felt there was a choice that needed to be made, and the very thought of
his options gave him nightmares when he did not have the luxury of falling exhasted into
sleep. <br>
<br>
The problem is that I don't know what I'm trying to accomplish, he thought as he made his
way back to the bar, noting offhand that his steps weren't exactly the straightest either.
Certainly he could hold his liquor well enough to drink many a dwarf under the bar, but
the pile of bottles arranged there was....excessive. Prove myself as an assassin? As a
dark elf? The latter thought made him grimace, reminiscent as it was of many a rant from
his father. The former...well, there was never a doubt that he was a killer. The new dents
in his helm, and the bruises he and Geirk both sported, came from their last tussle with
the ice and frost giants that lurked out there in the Great Divide beyond Thurgadin's
gates. It was hardly assassination, though, and whenever he saw fellow gentlemen and
ladies of his profession he always felt somehow lacking. As if there was some almost
divine drive behind their opaque eyes. Something he had missed. <br>
<br>
He settled in again, brooding, and stirred only slightly when Geirk lifted his head from
the mug of ale he'd been dunking in and poked him in the shoulder. This was obviously not
the response that the monk wanted, for he did it again, and again and again and again
until the dark elf grunted and peered over at him with narrow peeved eyes. <br>
<br>
&quot;I told you I'd win,&quot; said Geirk as soon as he had an audience. &quot;Nobody
beats the Wonder Monkey!&quot; <br>
<br>
&quot;Mhm.&quot; Furiel rolled his eyes again. It was habit; it was so very hard not to
roll one's eyes when the 'Wonder Monkey' started talking. <br>
<br>
&quot;Nobody, I tell you!&quot; Poke, poke. &quot;Especially not silly rogues who can't
even hit me when I'm playing dead.&quot; <br>
<br>
Poke. Poke. Furiel ignored it and sipping from one of the non-empty bottles. Poke. The
human was squinting at him with eyes full of drunken mischief. Poke. He curled his hand
into a loose fist. <br>
<br>
&quot;Do that again, Geirk, and I'll be forced to--&quot; <br>
<br>
Poke. <br>
<br>
Why does it always end up like this? Furiel thought mournfully up at the unresponsive
ceiling, then put his mug calmly down and tackled Geirk off his chair, applying knuckles
vigorously to the human's scalp. Wrestling ensued. The Coldain sidled down the bar away
from the pair subtly, though one sly-looking fellow made off with a half-empty bottle from
their collection while they were occupied with bouncing each others' skulls off the floor.
<br>
<br>
A normal day under the badge of Wyrmshadow. Nothing out of the ordinary, nothing that
could herald a change. <br>

Homecoming isn't what it used to be, Furiel thought darkly as he stripped the last ring
off the curled, too-familiar corpse and watched it vanish with some of his essence. The
ring, as he replaced it on his finger, felt somehow too large, as if his foolish
clumsiness had done more than just set the rogue guildmasters at his throat. <br>
<br>
The Velious cold had gotten too far under his skin and he had decided to escape back to
Neriak, where it was always warm, nestled against the Lavastorm Mountains. Along the way
from the point the obliging wizard had zapped him--North Karana, since the young Erudite
had yet to learn how to send someone even to the Commonlands--he had paused in Highpass to
have a talk with the young lady rogue hidden among the smugglers. After realizing she had
nothing to teach him, he was about to shimmy down the cliff back to the winding path that
curved between Eastern Karana and Kithicor when he had overheard voices in one of the
smugglers' alcoves. <br>
<br>
&quot;We need someone to get the documents,&quot; one was saying, in tones of quiet
desperation though the steadiness of his voice tried to hide it. &quot;You know I can't
even set foot outside of here. The Circle has eyes everywhere.&quot; <br>
<br>
&quot;As does the Mask and the Miner's Guild, though you've said they're not
searching,&quot; came the second voice. &quot;Anyone thought to be connected with you
would probably be killed on sight.&quot; <br>
<br>
&quot;An unknown, then. But how can an unknown be trustworthy?&quot; <br>
<br>
The second man chuckled. &quot;Come now, Stanos...you should know with Founy's betrayal
that few of us are. Thieves and assassins, my friend.&quot; <br>
<br>
&quot;You've stayed by me though, haven't you.&quot; <br>
<br>
&quot;You pay me enough.&quot; <br>
<br>
&quot;And you know the truth, Anson. There might be some speck of honor in you yet.&quot;
The second man gave a derisive snort, but the first went on, &quot;If only that Teir'dal
worm Tani hadn't stuck his idiot nose in and taken off with the other part, we wouldn't
have half the trouble.&quot; <br>
<br>
Tani? Furiel thought. It sounded like they were talking about someone he knew...Tani
N'Mar, a guildmaster of the Ebon Mask, whom he had always rather hopefully thought he took
after. That elf had taught him the finer points of theft. A thought brewed in Furiel's
white-crowned head. <br>
<br>
Steal from the master thief... And whoever this Founy fellow is. Xev knows the Highkeep
folk have been the kindest to me outside Neriak, and Neriak is growing tense for me as it
is...there's no harm in pandering a bit to the rogues around here. And it can't be that
hard... <br>
<br>
He had crept off, leaving the two humans unaware of his eavesdropping, and late in the day
found himself trekking through the warm darkness of Nektulos. The Dread Guard ignored him
politely. Some of them still thought he had the blood of one of theirs on his hands; he
could see that in some of the sidelong glances the Dragoons cast him, but he had gotten
the Scribe of Innoruuk drunk enough to proclaim his worthiness to the city, and almost
everyone obeyed the Scribe, however grudgingly they might feel about it. The few who did
not obey were easy enough to avoid. <br>
<br>
Through the Foreign Quarter, a moment's detour to the bank, then he was wandering down the
ridge past waterfalls and Innoruuk's temple to the most important part of the Third Gate:
the Hall of the Ebon Mask. The most obvious, easily accessible rogues' guild I've seen, he
thought as he sllid open the door between the two huge human-shaped statues and descended
into the dark interior. Qeynos, Freeport, Highkeep, all of them mask their guilds with
pitfalls and hidden entrances...we might as well light the whole place up in glowfire, for
all that we hide it. An interesting contrast. He stepped into the sanctum. <br>
<br>
Familiar faces looked up from their conversations, or the paperwork that seemed so out of
place in a clandestine organization but nevertheless remained. Furiel nodded to all his
old masters, marvelling at how...small they seemed, now that he was fully grown with
wicked blades at his belt and a night-colored helm hiding his face. Once, he had been in
awe. <br>
<br>
Did they become petty when I wasn't looking, or were they really always like this? he
wondered as he drifted through the rom, looking at the weapons and tapestries on the dark
walls as if reminiscing. He overheard snatches of talk, though he tried not to eavesdrop;
Lanys, Malevolence, Al'Kabor, Rivervale, Mayong Mistmoore, fragments of gossip and
goings-on, names and legends. And yet these dark elves were settled here as comfortably as
statuary, perhaps never leaving Neriak, content to simply command the young assassins that
came, year by year, to listen to their poisonous words. <br>
<br>
Xev, he swore internally, reflecting on the bitterness of his own thoughts. I really don't
belong here anymore. <br>
<br>
The circuit nearly complete, he glanced up sidelong to Tani, who lingered as always by the
stairway and was deep in discussion with one of the other guildmasters. There was a
scroll-pouch on his belt, unlike any of the others in the room. If he really had stolen
some parchment, that was where it would be. It was just a matter of mounting the stairs,
and brushing by in just a way that his fingers could slip in the pouch and out... <br>
<br>
A dark hand clamped down on his wrist, catching him with fingers half-in the scroll pouch.
He froze, too shocked by his own failure to move as Tani N'Mar wrenched one of his short
swords from its sheath and slashed at him, eyes blazing. &quot;You little wretch!&quot;
the guildmaster roared, and the one he'd been speaking to sprung up the stairs with a
drawn blade as well. Wrenching free, the panicked thief bolted, but that speed born of
fear could only take him so far before a poisoned blade found his back. Nerves burning,
muscles contorted and locked, he had lain just outside the great door of the hall,
paralyzed as the blades descended. <br>
<br>
Xev had done his little trick then, and Furiel opened his eyes once more to blink at the
startled banker, then sigh and make the trek back. Tani N'Mar had been waiting by his
body, and spat at his feet when he mounted the steps. <br>
<br>
&quot;You're not the first to try taking from your betters, boy,&quot; the guildmaster
sneered, &quot;but none of them fared any better. Don't try it again, or your membership
in the Ebon Mask is forfeit.&quot; Tani's cold blue eyes glittered, and he showed teeth in
a cruel smile. &quot;And we know what will happen to you without our protection, don't we,
Bristlebaner.&quot; <br>
<br>
Furiel simply started stripping his phantom corpse, silent. Finally, the sneering Innoruuk
rogue turned and stalked back into the Hall. <br>
<br>
This, Furiel thought, will be much harder than I expected. But if it spites that
bastard...it will be worth it. <br>

<p><strong><font face="Papyrus">Third Time's the Charm (or Fourth, or Fifth...) <br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
When this is over, I'll definitely have to leave town, Furiel thought after the third
failed attempt. He hadn't been caught, at least; Tani hadn't spotted him in the act since
the first time, but it was obvious to the rogue guildmaster, and to all the others in the
sanctum, that there was a little feud going on that wouldn't end until one or the other
got what he wanted. Tani seemed to want to catch the Bristlebane rogue red-handed again.
Furiel could only imagine what would be in store for him if that happened. Another
poison-wracked death was the least of his worries. <br>
<br>
After the fourth, he was seriously considering putting a blade between Tani's shoulders
and grabbing his pouch and bolting, nevermind that the other guildmasters would cut him
down before he reached the door. Cultivate patience, he told himself. Of course, he didn't
listen; he'd rarely paid attention to anyone else either. <br>
<br>
What he did manage to cultivate, by then, was a mask of indifference, so that when he
walked out of the sanctum empty-handed but for all of Tani's spare change the guildmaster
couldn't sneer at his look of defeat. Everyone told him he wore his emotions too plainly.
It made him a bad gambler, and had given him a hard life in Neriak. At least that, he
thought, won't matter soon. <br>
<br>
Try or die, that's all there was to it, but the tension was getting to him. He had not
hunted in weeks, and the feeling that he had lost something was getting stronger as time
went on. Maybe it was his pride, but he knew that he had to steal the parchment soon, or
else lapse, perhaps, into the stasis that held the guildmasters ever in their sanctum. <br>
<br>
Stress relief in the form of the mass murder of unsuspecting fire-drakes just concluded,
he was just swinging by the dragoons that guarded the entrance from Nektulos when a
familiar figure stepped out from the gloom and nabbed his sleeve. Hadn, a Teir'Dal wizard
who nevertheless was allied with a paladin of the rogue's close acquaintance. <br>
<br>
&quot;Furiel,&quot; he inquired, and the rogue paused and raised his helm and nodded.
&quot;It's been quite a while.&quot; <br>
<br>
&quot;It has. Did you need something?&quot; Friend of paladins or no, the rogue was
feeling leery of all dark elves at the moment. The wizard arched a silvery brow, but let
the curt tone go unremarked. <br>
<br>
&quot;A little matter of money, if we can step inside...&quot; <br>
<br>
&quot;Of course.&quot; <br>
<br>
Once out of hearing of the ever-vigilant Dragoon ears, the wizard tapped Furiel's shoulder
with his book admonishingly. &quot;What's gotten under your skin?&quot; <br>
<br>
The rogue shrugged. &quot;Feeling thwarted. Nothing to worry about. What did you
need?&quot; <br>
<br>
&quot;Nothing more than a transfer. Our mutual friend has convinced me to finance a
horse.&quot; <br>
<br>
&quot;A what?&quot; <br>
<br>
&quot;A horse. These riding beasts, on the moon.&quot; <br>
<br>
Furiel stared at him for a long moment, wondering if he had been off drinking concoctions
with the gnomish wizards. &quot;Riding beasts on the moon.&quot; <br>
<br>
&quot;Yes.&quot; <br>
<br>
&quot;Our friend is on the moon.&quot; <br>
<br>
&quot;Yes.&quot; <br>
<br>
&quot;Are you feeling okay?&quot; <br>
<br>
&quot;You hadn't heard?&quot; <br>
<br>
&quot;About the moon?&quot; <br>
<br>
&quot;Yes.&quot; <br>
<br>
&quot;Nooooo, I've been a bit occupied.&quot; Obsessed might be the better word. <br>
<br>
&quot;Al'Kabor opened an old Combine portal to the moon. Apparently there are people up
there. It's got an interesting view.&quot; <br>
<br>
&quot;...I see. ...you need me to go to the moon?&quot; <br>
<br>
The wizard waved a hand idly. &quot;No, no, I'm sure he can come to you, but you know how
he doesn't like it if he and I are seen together.&quot; <br>
<br>
Furiel shrugged. &quot;Fine.&quot; The two had wound their way down to the Burnished Coin
by then, and the rogue handed over his day's gatherings with great pleasure, as much for
the disgusted look on the banker's face as for being rid of the smell of fire drake
innards himself. &quot;How much do you need me to carry?&quot; <br>
<br>
&quot;About five thousand.&quot; <br>
<br>
&quot;....and you trust me with that?&quot; <br>
<br>
The wizard laughed. &quot;My friend, you have rarely been less than honest. I think
there's something wrong in your head.&quot; <br>
<br>
&quot;Why thank you,&quot; the rogue muttered. Honest. I feel insulted. I should keep it
all...splurge on mountains of ale... He couldn't do that though, not when someone knew he
had the money and where it was supposed to go. Damn you, Fizzlethorpe, stop playing
practical jokes in my head! I should have been a warrior... <br>
<br>
&quot;All right, then. Count your coins. I have some business to see to,&quot; he said.
The wizard cocked his head curiously. <br>
<br>
&quot;Like?&quot; <br>
<br>
&quot;Get myself killed, if I screw up.&quot; <br>
<br>
&quot;Oh, can I watch?&quot; <br>
<br>
Furiel gave the grinning wizard the rudest gesture he could think of, then trotted out,
nodding in passing to the guards and the glaring representative of the Indigo Brotherhood
that happened to be lingering to talk with them. <br>
<br>
Number five. He ghosted into the Hall of the Ebon Mask, cracking his knuckles and
loosening up his fingers. Tani's back was turned, the base of his skull the perfect
target, and Furiel realized with no sense of surprise that he hated this man, perhaps more
than he hated his father, or the god that had bred his whole misbegotten race. Playing
right into their hands, he thought, but that didn't make the acid burn of hatred ease one
bit. If he could have... If he could have done it, there would have been no more Ebon Mask
after that day. <br>
<br>
He brushed past the guildmaster, fingers licking out and snagging a coin on the entrance
pass. As he went down the steps, he flipped it in his palm, checking its color even though
the weight itself had told him platinum. Tani's stare bored a hole between his shoulders,
the same spot where he had thought a knife would grace the guildmaster best. It had become
something of a ritual; he did not even linger at the tapestries or talk to the other
rogues there as a pretense for having visited. Just one circuit, then he would go back to
fuming and doing whatever it was that Hadn wanted. As he came around to face the stairs
again, he locked eyes with Tani and saw his same hatred reflected back. It was somehow
very satisfying. <br>
<br>
I hate you, he thought as he bore closer, because you have given up. All you do is lounge
around here, filtering the reports from your spies and counting your coins and growing
old, for days on end. Al'Kabor opened up the moon to us, and do you move? Do our leaders
truly lead us? Or do they send out the young and the half-trained to strive and die in
unknown lands, while they sit back and wait for new coin, new blood and souls to roll in.
I hate you because you're a businessman, as fat and lazy as any of the merchants here, and
a captive of and lackey to the priesthood. And that's what you make of us, too. More than
anyone, we should not play their games, revere their gods, and set up shop among tailors
and taverns. Even the halflings have a front for their activities. <br>
<br>
Tani's eyes narrowed as he mounted the steps, and he saw the guidmaster tense subtly. He
kept their gazes locked. His hands did not need his eyes to guard them any more. As he
slipped by, it took great effort to not smirk into the other man's face, or spit, but the
chance was gone in a moment and the tempation to turn around and do it anyway was soon
gone. Once he had stepped out of sight, Furiel bolted up and up the flights of stairs and
out the great main door, adrenaline flooding his veins, and clamped his teeth on a cry of
victory before it could be voiced. <br>
<br>
Then, calmly, he slid the torn half of parchment into a safe pouch, and ambled back to the
bank. <br>
<br>
Some time later, he lay against the cool stones outside the entrance to the city, one hand
pressed to his throbbing forehead, and wondered why in the world he had let Hadn buy him a
celebratory drink or six. Or ten. Maybe it was more, alcohol only barely impeded him any
more. However many it was, about all he could remember was some indecency with Mare
X'Lottl and slamming maybe sixteen throwing knives into an Ebon Mask door before he
realized that in his state he could not approximate the image of a hand giving the finger.
Thankfully, no one had come to investigate. Or perhaps they had, and he just hadn't
noticed. <br>
<br>
Oh, and he'd pinned a note saying 'I quit' to Tani N'Mar's chamber door. <br>
<br>
He was fairly certain Tani would know who it was. <br>
<br>
&quot;Definitely time to find a new home,&quot; he breathed into the night air. Somewhere,
far above the all-concealing greenery of Nektulos Forest, the moon hung high in the sky, a
new place...maybe a safe place. &quot;And maybe the worst place to hide, if it's just been
found. Spies...&quot; <br>
<br>
Regardless, he had another piece to track down, since the incomprehensible scrap he'd
lifted from Tani was incomplete. What was the other name mentioned? Founy? Who on Norrath
had a name like Founy? <br>
<br>
Pushing off the wall, he slung the coin bag over his shoulder, the clank of platinum in
mass quantities making him feel like he'd just liberated the Thex treasury. Onward, then,
to rid himself reluctantly of his riches, and find Founy, and then... And then.... <br>

<p><strong><font face="Papyrus">Breaking Up is Hard to Do <br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
The worst part about hunting poison supplies in Lavastorm, he thought as he trekked along
the rims of Nektulos' tall hills, is avoiding the guards on the way back. No, strike that,
the worst part is those damn fire elementals. But this is pretty bad too. <br>
<br>
It had been...weeks, maybe more. He had lost count. So easily sidetracked, he thought
morosely as he passed by the circle of stones, tipping his helm silently to the halflings
that still crouched there to work their magics no matter how many times the dark elves
tried to root them out. They nodded back warily, not trusting him any more than they had
when he first stumbled upon them. Hefting his sack of supplies more comfortably on his
shoulder, Furiel pressed onward. <br>
<br>
First it had been delivering that haul of platinum to Lerien the paladin. Then that fellow
had insisted on dragging him along on a few jaunts, promising him something he could not
resist: all the loot except the few things the paladin was seeking. He had come back with
a good bit more money in his pockets and some interesting trinkets to hand around, as well
as some working knowledge of Mistmoore Castle. Killing the enthralled but decidedly
Teir'Dal servitors had been...disturbing. He really was not sure how to feel, but Lerien
certainly fell to it with zeal and the castle's denizens had shown no friendliness toward
him despite their common blood. And so, he had wet his blades in one unceasing battle from
courtyard to pinnacle and back again. <br>
<br>
Once or twice he could have sworn he'd seen his little sister's face under the helm of a
herald or usher, but none of them gave him any quarter and none were Tanelenae under their
armor after they had fallen. It's necessary, he had told himself, more and more frequently
as the night wore on. I have to be used to this, if the Ebon Mask decides to come after
me, or the rest of Neriak does since I'm not under their protection. <br>
<br>
And after that, Lerien had dragged him along on another expedition...ill-fated but a good
deal less traumatic, strangely. Deep in the Feerrott was a portal, guarded by an erudite
necromancer and a legion of undead; Furiel had fought alongside Lerien's guild and
representatives of several others to that portal, and through, to invade the plane of
Cazic-Thule, where the sky rained blood and fire could be seen from a distance, belched up
in the midst of hideous woodlands. He had gawped like a country lad, feeling small among
the grizzled veterans and the sorcerors of power. Small, but nevetheless invincible, for
they had carved a swath through the nightmare landscape with ease. A single mishap had
ruined it: someone who never came forward had stepped too close to the lair of the
dracoliche, and the undead dragon made its cold breath felt over all of them. As painful
as it had been, Furiel could not help feeling elated once he had returned to the right
side of the portal, his gear once more slung across his back and only a bit the worse for
wear. Finally he had been somewhere, done something worth remembering! <br>
<br>
More jaunts had ensued, and a goodly number of duels. The urge to slip into Kaladim rose
now and then, but most often was checked by some more immediate event, or that constant
dread of Faydwer. Running to Mistmoore with a companion was one thing, but he could tell
no one about the private quest he had undertaken, and being stranded on the continent of
the light elves... It made him more than a little nervous, no matter that he knew he was
safe in the shadows. Add to that dwarves and--eyugh--gnomes...and it simply was not high
on his list of places to visit. He'd rather dance on the steps of the High Palace of
Erudin. Or streak Innoruuk. <br>
<br>
The quest was nagging at him though, along with the dozen-odd things he had left undone.
Poison-crafting was one of those, and thus he had spent a day slaughtering basilisks and
drakes and plumbing the depths of Najena for what he needed. <br>
<br>
He ghosted by the guards near the pass to the Commonlands, nabbing a mail pack from the
poor abused bard who watched this edge of the mail route as he slipped by. The run to
Freeport flew by as he counted up how much he needed by way of suspensions, and after a
brief discussion with Toxdil he slipped into the city, whistling, pockets a bit lighter
but hopeful that he would learn something this time. <br>
<br>
Passing the mail off with his mind on other things, he almost missed the bard's parting
comment, but then she caught his sleeve and he snapped out of his thoughts to frown at her
warningly. She seemed unruffled, as humans were wont to do when glared at by superior but
shorter beings. <br>
<br>
&quot;Your guild's lady bard was through here a bit ago. She said to tell you, you ought
to check the tackboard at the tavern.&quot; <br>
<br>
Furiel blinked, rather puzzled, but thanked her and veered that way. Wyrmshadow had rather
recently begun posting missives between members on the tackboard, like other guilds and
gangs often did; it was easier than trying to reach everyone through the magic link that
was branded or bound into a bit of jewelry on their person, since the message would not go
through if the person were asleep or otherwise insensible. He had checked on it now and
then, and scrawled a note of his own at times. But why would Aylrin have told him to look
there, rather than given the message to the other bard? Or told him herself? <br>
<br>
The tavernkeeper's nose looked like it would double up on itself when he caught the scent
of Furiel's poison supplies, but the rogue shot him a dagger-look and he kept his peace.
The tackboard was full of messages as always, with only a few recent ones fluttering at
Wyrmshadow's corner. He leaned in to squint at them curiously. <br>
<br>
&quot;Gone to visit Megera's kin,&quot; said one in Aylrin's unmistakable hand, the words
choppier and jagged than they had been before they had thought her lost. &quot;I'm not
sure when I will be back, but I will try to keep in touch if it is possible from
there.&quot; <br>
<br>
Good, he thought, relief mixing with regret. The poor lass had been a wreck since she had
been rescued from the bowels of Highkeep, and Megera had confided in him that she was
cutting herself and healing it with song, under some delusion that she could work blood
magics like a necromancer. He liked her, liked her a lot...she sometimes reminded him of
his sister, but in a good way, not like the demon-crazed women of Mistmoore. But their
paths had been rapidly diverging even before she had vanished. The high elf would take
care of her like he could not. <br>
<br>
There were other messages. Random babble from Geirk the monk and the other young monk he
had brought in with him, a few of his own scribbled responses, the very rare note from
Tinakori the halfling... And one more, something recent from the guildleader Jabbuk. <br>
<br>
&quot;I am moving on...&quot; <br>
<br>
What? He leaned in closer, squinting in the dim tavern light. <br>
<br>
&quot;I have given leadership to Alur and gone to One Hundred Swords. I know a few of them
and they have been trying to talk me into going there for almost a year now. ...I doubt
most of you will even notice me gone.&quot; <br>
<br>
&quot;What?&quot; he repeated out loud, incredulous. Suddenly afraid, he drew out the
chain that was tucked under his tunic and mail, running his thumb along the stylized
dragon's head charm. It still tingled with magic, and when he concentrated he could still
feel that link to the others who wore the same mark. Relieved, he let it fall, then stared
at the parchment some more. <br>
<br>
Alur. A young, female, Teir'Dal necromancer, almost entirely untrained but indebted to
Jabbuk and unbreakably bound. Without the druid's guidance, though... <br>
<br>
Damn it. Everywhere I go I'm cornered by my kin. Grinding his teeth, Furiel tucked the
pendant back down the neck of his tunic and slung the collection bag over his shoulder
again. Leaving the guild suddenly sounded like a very good idea. Leaving, and going far,
far away for a long long time. Like to Velious. Or the moon. <br>
