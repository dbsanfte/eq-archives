<h2 align="center"><font face="Papyrus"><strong>Do unto others as you would have them do
unto you.</strong></font></h2>

        <li><strong><font face="Papyrus">/shout should never be used for OOC. Ever. </font></strong></li>
        <li><strong><font face="Papyrus">Don't beg. Not from other guildmates, not from people
          outside the guild. Beggers are not welcome in the guild.</font></strong></li>
        <li><strong><font face="Papyrus">No OOC names should be considered - outwardly, always be in
          character whenever possible, and that includes your name.&nbsp; For Instance: <u>Racecar</u>
          is not acceptable into this guild.&nbsp; <u>Buttlicker</u><em> </em>for a high elf is not
          acceptable, and maybe not for anyone else, either.</font></strong></li>
        <li><font face="Papyrus"><strong>Intentional Killstealing is frowned upon.&nbsp; Everyone
          has done this by Accident.&nbsp; Don't do it on purpose.</strong></font></li>
        <li><font face="Papyrus"><strong>Absolutely NO spamming, scamming, cheating, ninja looting,
          and other things that you would object to if done to you.&nbsp; If the only way to get
          what you need in the group you are in is to ninja-loot -- find another group. These things
          make the guild look bad. Don't make the guild look bad.</strong></font></li>
        <li><strong><font face="Papyrus">Keep it fun at all times - and not just for you. Make sure
          someone knows you're teasing before you go into a 2 hour tease session. If the other
          person isn't laughing - it's not funny.&nbsp;&nbsp; Make sure the other person understands
          that you are roleplaying if you are in character -- and that they want to roleplay too.
          Don't force it on non-rp'ers - but recognize that you can stay in character while dealing
          with them. </font></strong><br>
