  <h1 align="center"><strong><font face="Papyrus">The Charter of the Twilight Company</font></strong></h1>
  <hr>
  <p><u><strong><font face="Papyrus" size="3">Mission statement: </font></strong></u></p>
  <p><strong><font face="Papyrus" size="3">We are a guild building off the ashes of a few
  former guilds; a twilight mixture of races, classes, and alignments, bound together by
  friendship and mutual support. </font></strong></p>
  <p><strong><font face="Papyrus" size="3">Our aims are to hunt and raid together and to
  provide crafting support. We consider courtesy to be paramount in dealings with others.
  &nbsp;&nbsp; </font></strong></p>
  <p><strong><font face="Papyrus" size="3">Many of the guild members come from a roleplaying
  background, so we encourage roleplaying as much as possible, and discourage obvious out of
  character talk in the open channels. </font></strong></p>
  <p><strong><font face="Papyrus" size="3">We will understand that this is a game, only a
  game, that it does not come before our lives, and that a sense of humor is a good thing to
  have.&nbsp;&nbsp; Above all, the Company must have fun.&nbsp; </font></strong></p>
  <p><strong><font face="Papyrus" size="3"><u>Officers duties and titles (who's in charge)</u><br>
  Officers are appointed by the Guildmaster - simularly, they can for any reason have their
  officership revoked.&nbsp;&nbsp; Junion officers are appointed to assist the guildmaster
  in guilding and are recognized as officers but have no official duties other than to guild
  people they know are to join the Company.</font></strong></p>
  <p><strong><font face="Papyrus" size="3"><u>Qualifications to join (how do you get in).. </u><br>
  We have no level limit, <em>but!!</em> ...we only take applications from those we've
  hunted with, as in you have to be sponsored into the guild by a current guildmember. Real
  Life Friends are acceptable.&nbsp; People should not expect to receive any sort of guild
  handmedowns of any great worth until they have attained a level where their corpse will
  not vanish after 30 minutes. We also do not take level into account for purposes of
  deciding rank or worth to the guild, the idea is to be a 'fun' guild, not an 'uber' guild.
  </font></strong></p>
  <p><font face="Papyrus" size="3"><strong><u>Proceedures for being disbarred or leaving the
  guild. (how do you get out?) </u><br>
  We will not tolerate members dragging our name through the mud and any who do so will be
  punished.&nbsp; Expulsion of the offending character, then of all of the characters of
  that one player, or reparation of damages at your own cost are some of the possible
  punishments.&nbsp; </strong></font></p>
  <p><font face="Papyrus" size="3"><strong>Anyone who wants out may leave at any time, we
  are not expecting people to make some kind of lifelong commitment.&nbsp; However,
  circumstances of your leaving will determine whether or not you get a welcome back later.
  &nbsp; </strong></font></p>
  <p><font face="Papyrus" size="3"><strong>If you leave to go on a Raid and join another
  guild temporarily, that is acceptable, but please remember to let us know by email, the
  forum, or tell an officer so that it may be noted.&nbsp; Suddenly seeing a former member
  wearing another guildtag is something of a shock to the system.</strong></font></p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>

  <p><small>The charter is not carved in stone. Things can change at any time.&nbsp; The
  Company is a living, breathing thing and is not static.</small></p>
