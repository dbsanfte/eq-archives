<p ALIGN="CENTER">FUN THINGS TO DO WITH HOTKEYS</p>

<p ALIGN="CENTER">(Or How Power Level Sense Heading Without Really Trying)</p>

<p ALIGN="CENTER"><em>by Mackay of the Conclave of the Wyrm</em></p>

<p>One of the most useful things to do in Everquest is to max out Sense Heading. Nothing
helps you survive a frantic run to the zone in an unfamiliar area like knowing exactly
which direction you are running! <font FACE="Wingdings">J</font> But it takes forever to
raise this skill to a useful level: Click the hotkey incessantly while:
fighting/running/healing/waiting/shopping, and after two or three hours you are finally
rewarded by &quot;You have raised your skill in Sense Heading (01)&quot;</p>

<p>Fortunately, there is an easy way to raise this skill such as without thinking about it
with a little key board remapping. You can set your hotkey to automatically run Sense
Heading anytime you move right or left. It&#146;s the tiniest bit complicated, but if you
follow the directions below, you will be able to get Sense Heading to a useable level in a
fairly short time. (I generally throw a couple practice points into it at the beginning
just to speed things up a little)</p>

<p>I&#146;d like to take the credit for this idea, but I got it from AllaKhazam&#146;s web
page in the Tips section. It&#146;s not there any more for some reason, but
AllaKhazam&#146;s is a good place to find a lot of useful ideas and information. You
should visit his site often: <a HREF="http://everquest.allakhazam.com/">http://everquest.allakhazam.com</a>

<p><big>How To Train Sense Heading Automatically</u> </big>

<ol>
  <li>Create a Hot Key for Sense Heading.</li>
  <li>This will only work if you use the alphakeys to move with, not the separate arrow keys.
    (it should also work with the numeric keypad, but that is my mouse hand, so I haven&#146;t
    tried it <font FACE="Wingdings">J</font> ) I use the following keys to move my characters:
  </li>
  <p>&#145;a&#146; = Left</p>
  <p>&#145;f&#146; = Right</p>
  <p>&#145;e&#146; = Forward</p>
  <p>&#145;d&#146; = Back</p>
  <p>I have remapped &#145;Duck/Stoop&#146; to &#145;v&#146;. </p>
  <p>I use these letters because they fit my hand and closely resemble the feel of the
  separate arrow keys next between the alpha keys and numeric keypad. Feel free to use any
  keys you like.</p>
  <li>In Everquest, open the Options Screen and select &#145;Keyboard&#146;</li>
  <li>Click &#145;Next&#146; to get to the User-Defined Key that reflects the number of the
    hotkey position you have set for &#145;Sense Heading&#146;.</li>
  <li>Left-click on that space, then enter (by pressing) the key you use to turn right or left
    with. In my example above, that would be &#145;f&#146;. (If you want to use an arrowkey on
    the numeric keypad to perform this function, press that key.)</li>
  <li>Click &#145;back&#146; until you reach the page with &#145;move right&#146;.</li>
  <li>Double-click the space for &#145;move right&#146; and enter the same key you entered for
    number 5. In my example, that would be &#145;f&#146;. (If you want to use an arrowkey on
    the numeric keypad to perform this function, press that key.)</li>
  <li>Now, if you page back to the User-Defined keys, you will see that the key you entered
    for your Sense Heading hotkey has gone blank. <u>That&#146;s Good!</u><b> </b>Leave it
    alone, it&#146;s supposed to be that way! <font FACE="Wingdings">J</font> </li>
  <li>Click &#145;Back&#146; until you are completely out of the Options screens.</li>
  <li>Exit the Everquest Application completely, and restart it. Now, every time you turn
    left, you should be practicing Sense Heading.</li>
  <p>11. <u><b>Very Important Points:</b></u><ol TYPE="a">
    <li>You <u>must</u> make sure that in each page of hotkeys you have a &#145;safe&#146;
      hotkeys in that same position, such as Forage/Time/Who/ Friend/LOC. This is a BAD place to
      have your button for Melee Attack, unless you really want to leave bodies cluttering up
      West Freeport&#133;&#133;&#133;. And besides, it&#146;s really embarrassing to Sit
      everytime you turn right. <font FACE="Wingdings">J</font> </li>
    <li>Because this is a change in your computer instructions, not in your character on the
      server, <u>you will see this effect in every character you play!</u> Be very sure you have
      made every character &#145;safe&#146; as in paragraph &#145;a&#146;!!!!!!!</li>
    <li>If you are in the habit of using &#145;Shift-&lt;number&gt;&#146; to page through your
      hotkeys, the number that was previously assigned to Sense Heading will no longer work. I
      now use &#145;Shift-&lt; f &gt; as from my example above, or the mouse to reach that page.</li>
    <li>Once you have Sense Heading up to 30 or so, it will advance easily enough just by you
      clicking on the hotkey as you need to know your direction in the course of play. Once you
      reach this point, you can remap your keyboard to the original positions if you wish.</li>
    <li>Obviously, you can practice a different skill such as Forage or Mend, by remapping your
      &#145;turn left&#146; button in the same manner. I&#146;ve done that with Forage, and now
      I can&#146;t run through a zone without finding food at least once. If you do this,
      re-read paragraphs &#145;a&#146; &amp; &#145;b&#146;. <font FACE="Wingdings">J</font> </li>
  </ol>
</ol>
<u>

<p>Other Fun Things To Do With Hotkeys:</u></p>

<p>I have a Social Key reprogrammed as follows:</p>

<p>/follow</p>

<p>/g On Follow! Pick &#145;em up and put &#145;em down!</p>

<p>This lets me easily notify my group member(s) that I am ready to follow without typing
the command and text. It&#146;s kind of a no-brainer, but it took me 6 months to figure it
out. <font FACE="Wingdings">J</font> </p>

<p>Any other command or series of commands can be mapped onto a Social button. It&#146;s a
shame there is such a small number of Social buttons.</p>

<p>Almost any button on the main screen can be dragged to the Hotkeys, which means you can
avoid looking at the main screen more than you need/want to. (This includes Spell buttons,
but see paragraph &#145;a&#146; above!!!) </p>

<p>Again, this isn&#146;t rocket science, but it takes a little practice and training to
remember to page through the hotkeys instead of hitting &lt;F10&gt; to loko at the main
screen.</p>

<p>This is a good idea I got from &#145;The Wood Elf Bard&#146;s Guide to Combat&#146;,
written by Nafai, at Welcome To The Concert Hall. (<a
HREF="http://www.attcanada.net/~reaper/index.html">http://www.attcanada.net/~reaper/index.html</a>)
</p>

<p>You can create hotkeys for inventory/weapon/armour slots the same way you create any
other hotkeys. Once created, you can use your mouse to drag items from one slot to the the
next on your hotkey page. This is very useful for my cowardly bard, who likes to run away
quickly by launching Selo&#146;s Accelerando when things start to go sour. Once she starts
running, I can then easily swap her sword and shield for her drum so that she can run <u>faster</u>,
without switching to that busy, big, and distracting Inventory screen.</p>

<p><u>Be careful if you do this!</u> It is very easy to drop things from inventory when
you swap them, especially when you first practice it. It would be a very bad thing to lose
your brand new Combine Long Sword because you were too panicked to swap your drum
slowly!!!! Even so, it&#146;s a very handy technique</p>

<p>I hope this information was useful and easy to understand. If you have additions or
corrections, please let Meg know so she can update this.</p>

<p>Good Luck and Good Hunting!!</p>
