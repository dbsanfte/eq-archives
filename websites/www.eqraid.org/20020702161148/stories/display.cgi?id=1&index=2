With keen eyes and ears he sees the traps laid and sprung, the food hurled, the slow deaths of those trapped, the gift of life given by the cleric.  The frog hordes advance, the gate collapses, the cleric, barbarian and troll perish. Enter the ranger who gleefully slays the frogs.  The knight ponders this as the ranger sits amid the frog bodies and pats himself on the back. The resourceful dark knight runs over to the troll town and pokes a large, mean troll in the eye and runs back to the ranger. The knight waves at the suprised ranger as the trolls come storming along behind him. Chuckling, the knight crumples over into a death-like state. The righfully angry trolls decide the ranger would have probably poked one of them in eye someday and have him for dinner.</font></td>

The foul souls corrupted by the Zek brothers, must be inquisited and cleansed for the name of the Marr Twins. Realizing he is vastly outnumbered, he gulps an invis potion.

The trolls, feasting on the corpses (especially enjoying the ranger's) turn to see 35 guards chasing a gleaming warrior with a fiery blade. They stand up, ready to assume the chase.

Seeing rangers die, did not amuse him, this is a common occurance.  However, watching the clerics gate collapse, brought an evil grin over Belin's stern face as he could see a horde of trolls follow his fellow Shadowknight Cynister, coming straight for Khoros.<br><br>"Now we're talking."<br><br>Watching the cleric's surprise as a village of Trolls swarm him, and seeing Cynister crumple up over "dead" was a sight he will never forget.  Belin sends Cynister a telepathic message in a dark and ancient language, "Dude, ju r0x0r!".<br><br>Just as Belin was about to leave the commotion, hearing the cry of someone so pansie enough to call himself a Paladin, he watched Edrick enter the scene.  Edrick has goop all over his face from drinking some kind of potion (at least that's what Belin thinks the goop is /shrug.) Watching Edrick train the trolls, then quaffing another potion and letting the Militia do the work, all Belin could think of is, "What a wuss."<br><br>Seeing Luclin and Goobtrik face to face in heated battle, did not interest Belin, so he promptly shouts to the surrrounding area "Hey, anyone seen a bloody Ratman Guard around here?!?!" Belin hears no response, sighs, and continues on his way.</font></td>

The rabbit sensing his favorite food hops gracefully over to where the proud shadowknight stands. The rabbit's nose twitches slighty and in one fell swoop, swallows Belin whole.
