      <td> <font face="Verdana" size="-1">Neriak, mountain fortress of the Dark Elves.  A cloaked figure makes his way towards the training halls of The Dead in Neriak's Third Gate.  Few where about at this hour and his passage was noted only by the ever watchful guards that roamed the city.  Trailing his hand over the ancient stone of the corridors the young man quietly mused to himself.  "How much these walls have seen, what stories could they tell"  Stopping for a moment the young man closed his eyes and let his mind travel where it would.  He could feel the storms that raged thru the darkness this night, slashing and howling thru the peaks of the Lavastorm Mountains.  The very air seemed charged with some eldritch energy that thrummed and vibrated throughout the stronghold of the Tier'Dal.  Resuming his slow pace he made his way towards his destination.  Few people in the land of Norrath would have seen or heard his passing. The Dark Elves, or Tier'Dal in the Elvish tongue, where by nature silent and possesed an inate ability to blend into the shadows.<br><br>Moments later he stood before a seemingly featureless wall marked only with a few faintly glowing symbols visable only to Tier'Dal eyes.  Passing his hand over the symbols and muttering a few syllables of the Dark Speech causes the faint outline of a doorway to appear. The rock shifts silently aside as he enters a narrow tunnel with a winding stair leading up into the darkness.  The stairs lead to a place of meditation known only to the Initiates of The Dead. The dark Necromancers, grave spell weavers of awesome power and the Shadow Knights, the military arm of The Dead.  The young man who now ascended the stairs to the Balek'Ci'Kel, the Tower of Sight, was a member of the latter.  His name was Cynister Grimshadow, Shadow Knight of the 5th Circle.  He thought he would spend a quiet night in meditation.  What he saw when he stepped onto the landing at the top of the stairway stopped him in his tracks.<br><br>Her back was to him as he passed thru the doorway and into the chamber of the Tower of Sight.  The place was so named for it was carved into the highest of peaks in the mountain range that housed Neriak.  A single large room with windows that looked down upon the vastness of Nektulos Forest.  Oft times several members of The Dead might be here meditating or merely watching the mist move thru the forest.  Tonight only she was there.  She turned and he gazed into those eyes, often heard in song or story, but never seen till this day. Those ancient eyes, so much older than the beautiful, ageless form they resided in, held him as surely as the strongest chains, he could not move, he could not speak.  A whisper of gossimer cloth as she crossed the room to him.  She looked up at him and a small smile played across her lips.  "Come Cynister, we have much to talk of this night.  There are portents in the air, The Father has spoken to me of you. Come.."</font></td>

      <td> <font face="Verdana" size="-1">The Queen of Neriak! At that moment he must of looked rather foolish gaping at her, quite unable to say anything.  Apparently it showed on his face too, for it brought a brief chuckle from her.  That quickly faded as her face turned stern again, "Come! Sit with me and hear what it is I command of you."  Settling fluidly into one of the many divans in the chamber she beckoned to him.  Quickly he approached and kneeled before the one who commanded the unswerving loyalty of The Dead. <br><br>"What is commanded of me, my queen.  I live to serve."  "There is something that has been lost to us for many years young Cynister.  An item of power and symbol of the house Thex.  Long it was lost but our agents have finally found the location of this talisman.  I did make sacrifice to The Father and seek guidance for I was not sure who to send on this errand. A rogue of great skill perhaps, or a Grave Lord from the ranks of the Shadow Knights, mayhap a dread Warlock sumommed from his arcane studies to do my bidding."  A smile again flitted across her lips.  "What did my visions show me instead? A whelp, a knight of the 5th circle, not even skilled enough to call forth the weakest of spells.  The Father showed me you, Cynister.  You are to be my champion for this task."  Leaning back she stared intently at him.  Her eyes narrowed and a feeling of heat washed over him as he mustered his will and returned her gaze.  "Fail me and none shall ever know you walked this earth.  Succeed and your place among the Grave Lords is assured my young servant."  "I shall not fail you my queen. What task must I accomplish for you?"<br><br>He held himself well Christianos Thex mused to herself as she observed the young man who knelt so still before her.  What was it about him that intrigued her? Surely not his physical appearance, he was not overly handsome and he was much heavier muscled than most Tier'Dal, giving him a somewhat brutish demeanor.  But the calm that radiated from him was something else entirely.  Ahhh that was it. Focus.  Even at such a young age he was more focused than many of his elders.<br><br>"You must retrieve the pieces of the Thex Mallet and return them here to me.  The Thex Mallet has been found and must be reforged.  You know of this talisman?"  "Aye my queen, the symbol of the House Thex, long lost in the Combine Wars."  "Your instuctors have taught you well Cynister, yes that is the item of which I speak.  Now take yourself to see Loveal in the Lodge of The Dead. He will provide you with information and equipment for the task ahead of you."  Rising, he bowed low before her.  "As you command, my queen."  As he turned to leave she called to him softly, "Cynister.  It will be long before you see me or the walls of this city again. Your quest will take you far from home and test your will.  Prepare yourself well.  Do not fail me."  He silently nodded to her and turned his steps towards the Lodge of The Dead.</font></td>

      <td> <font face="Verdana" size="-1">Loviel S'Nez stared at the whelp in front of him, a sneer playing across his lips as he looked at the young night holding his new armor and weapons.  Leaning closer to the young man he suddenly hammered his mailed fist into the young knights midsection.  Cynister grunted in pain but his facial expression did not change, nor did he take his eyes off of the Shadow Knight master.  His baleful eyes just inches from the young man's face Loviel spat out syllables in the Dark Speech.  "If you should think that the Queen's desires for your success shall afford you any protection from me should you fail her... You would be most sadly mistaken young apprentice.  Fail Her and you shall die a thousand deaths, each more excruciating than the last!"<br><br>Bowing low before S'Nez Cynister turned and made his way from the armory with his bundle of armor and weaponry.  It was time to prepare.  Once back at his quarters he quickly began to lay out his new gear and prepare for the journey that lay ahead.  The first task in his quest for the Thex Mallet had been explained to him by Loviel when he first arrived at the armory. <br><br>"The Queen would have you outfitted with arms and armor forged by the finest of Tier'Dal smiths.  She wishes to afford you some small chance to succeed in your mission apparently."  The Shadown Knight master sneered at his apprentice as he tossed him the bundle.  "You were a fine pupil Cynister, but I fear I shall never see you again." Shrugging, he turned away and fetched a folded letter from a table nearby.  Quickly S'Nez read thru the letter and tossed it into the nearby firepot.  "The first step of your mission is to travel to the Lavastorm Mountains.  There is a Paladin of some renown, one Sir Lindeal, who has taken it upon himself to interrupt the trade routes with our ancient stronghold of Najena.  Find him, challenge him and kill him.  Should you live thru your encounter with him, bring me proof of his death, his testimony should do well." Chuckling to himself he eyed his student.  "A testimony eh? What fools that cannot remember their purpose lest they read it from a parchment!  Let the fires of hatred rage from within when you find this Paladin and leave his torn body for the carrion feeders."<br><br>Cynister mused over this as he outfitted himself, carefully placing and securing each piece of banded chain armor in the proper order.  That finished he strapped on the belt that held his new sword and dagger.  Pulling the blade free from it's sheath he stared at the fine workmanship of the blade. A Combine blade, made by the ancient craftsmen of the Northlands, still keen and rust free after so many hundreds of years.  The light flickered and shimmered across the surface of the finely wrought steel.  The blade itself seemed to give of a faint glow.  Smiling to himself he sheathed the blade and secured his pack containing rations, bandages and the like to his back.  He looked around his sparse chambers one last time and quietly made his way out of the city and set his feet upon the road to Najena, nestled deep in the Lavastorm Mountains.</font></td>

    <tr> 
      <td> <font face="Verdana" size="-1">Cynister sat at the mouth of the cave that had become his home these past weeks and meditated, his eyes staring out into the darkness, his ears absorbing the sounds of the night.  The moon was almost full again, almost 4 weeks gone by since he left the stronghold of Neriak to begin his mission.  In that time he had grown much.  When he finally found this accursed Paladin he felt he would be equal to the task.  The Lavastorm Mountains were teeming with hostile creatures, more than enough to constantly improve his skills.  When the Shadow Knight masters evaluated him upon his return he was sure to be advanced to the 9th rank or perhaps higher.  Finally he would be instructed in the use of necromantic spells.  The young man wrenched himself back to the painful reality that none of that would come to pass if he did not find his prey and quickly.  The Paladin was wise and clever, several times Cynister had come upon his handywork but to late to find him at the scene.  Dead goblins, vanished supplies, guards slain in the very shadow of ancient Najena.  Channeling his frustration into a seething hatred for this servant of Marr Cynister focused his mind as the night passed to dawn.<br><br>The fire goblins had informed him that a supply of minerals was being taken to Neriak this day.  Cynister felt sure he would finally flush out his quarry today.  Silent and hidden above the trail close by the broken gates of Najena he watched and waited. The goblins milled around the huge ogre porters as their packs were loaded and secured.  Closing his eyes, Cynister strained his exceptional hearing for the faintest signs that the Paladin was near.  After several minutes he heard what he had hoped for all these weeks.  Someone was moving down the slope towards the pass the caravan must move thru to begin the trek to Neriak.  Opening his keen eyes, the young shadow knight scanned the rocks above him.  There! Flitting from behind a large boulder was a large figure, a human!  Clad all in dull chain armor, smeared over with lava ash the Paladin blended in almost completely with the terrain.  Almost.  Cynister quickly and silently made his way up the slope and behind his target.  The Paladin had chosen a small flat area on the slope to set up his ambush, screened from the road by rocks this natural platform was ideal for launching a barrage of magic and missiles and allowed an easy escape.  There would be no escape today for him though.  Mentally preparing himself Cynister silently stepped onto the rock shelf where his opponent crouched, his attention taken by the activity below.<br><br>Cynister drew his blade from the scabbard slowly, making sure there was an audible hiss as the blade came free.  The man in front of him tensed for a moment expecting the blow.  When none came the human slowly stood to his full height and turned.  The Teir'Dal and Human faced each other for several seconds.  At last the Human spoke. "So at last they have sent you.  I hope you are prepared to meet your dark god today evil one."  He pulled his blade free from his back scabbard, a large two-handed sword.  Nothing else needed to be said, both knew that no surrender would be given and no quarter asked.  Silently they came together the sounds of their battle masked to those on the ground below by the noises of the caravan.  The Paladin, slow and powerful and the Dark Elf, swift and agile, traded a flurry of blows but the heavier blade of the Human beat aside Cynister's lighter blade and scored a crushing blow across his shoulder. His mail rent and blood flowing down his arm Cynister staggered back and went down to one knee.  Eyes gleaming the Paladin raised his blade for the finishing blow.  Grinding his teeth together Cynister channeled the pain into hate, the hate into strength.  Spinning aside as the Human's sword bit into the rock where he had been a moment ago he snapped to his feet, spun past his over-extended foe and brutally slashed him across the back of neck. Staggering upright the Paladin clutched at his neck and as he did so Cynister came in low and slashed again upwards across the knights midsection.  The combine blade cleaved thru the chain links and into the flesh beneath.  Slumping back against the rocks the knight attempted to call upon his god of light for healing but Cynister quickly stepped forward and unleashed the power of hatred, channeled thru his outstretched hand directly into the Paladin's chest.  The smoking corpse crumpled to the ground. Sagging to his knees Cynister could barely maintain conciousness long enough to bind his wounds.  <br><br>Opening his eyes Cynister realized he must have passed out after binding his injured shoulder.  Dizzy, he crawled over to the body beside him and searched thru the pouches till he found what he needed. The Testimony of Sir Lindeal.  Gingerly he made his way down to his camp to take rest and mend his wounds before making his way back to Neriak.</font></td>
