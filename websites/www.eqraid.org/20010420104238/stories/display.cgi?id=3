The branch shook violently, the brush parted, the steed let lose a slight whiny as it caught its footing.  <br>"Ahh, clear skies," the rider mumbled to himself.  He took in a deep breath through his nose.  The scent, the scent of familiarity.  He had come home. <br>The journey he had been on had taken him several months but he was now home.  The quest was all behind him now, his ascension to his current status was a long hard task, but that was not on his mind at the moment.  He knew that soon he would be within the confines of the keep and again the longing feelings would burn again.  <br>Would she be there?  Had anything changed?  Word of Icewind Keep had not reached him in these many months away.  Uncertainty began to fill his mind.  The joy of his homecoming, clouded by old feelings.  <br>The gates seemed closed as he made his approach.  Off in the distance he could make out an Orc encampment, their shamens' fires begin to light up the sky as the sun set.  Seems as much as we tried the Orcs have never given up, there seemed to be an endess supply, he thought to himself.  <br>"Hail, old one," a voice from behind him spoke.<br>"Oldsalt, I knew you were near by your stench," he replied.<br>Oldsalt broke out into a robust laughter, exclaiming,  "you jumped so far out of your saddle, I thought you were taught to fly!"<br>He smiled, knowing he was had, "I see you are still attempting to learn the ways of your lost art, perhaps some day they will prove useful."<br>Laughing Oldsalt answers, "Perhaps, anyway I will see you soon.  You should not have trouble making it to the keep."<br>He waves farwell and continues his travels.  The fires from the keep burned bright.  He began to hear the rumblings of a town.  It was not so long ago, when Icewind Keep was barely a few lodges and tents.  Now success had brought prosperity.  One of the great doors opened as he drew near.<br>"Now it would be just like you to arrive as we are to begin our meal.  Welcome home my friend," said Aegirson as he reached around and delivered a big hug.  <br>"It has been too long old friend," he reciprocated.<br>Aegirson shouted.  "Go on they are expecting you.  Just save me some food for later!" <br>As he opened the door to the hall, he caught it.  The scent.  The smell of lilacs on a summers day.  The freshness of a spring morning.  A scent so cool, he could see with his eyes opened.  She had just walked by, she had to be close.  His pulse hastened.  His eyes alert.  He gulped.  The nervousness again.  She was here.  He would see her soon.<br>The room was busy, people scurring about tending to their duties.  Great men and women conversing.  Those seeking greatness hovering about.  The Great Hall filled with activity.  A smile broke across his face.  His mind filled with, what if's.<br>Ahh, how he longed for clear skies.</font></td>

"Where is Daigeh?!"<br><br> "I am deeply sorry, Ambrose," Aegirson said in a soft voice, pulling him aside, "but Daigeh has passed away."<br><br> "WHAT?!!" Ambrose screamed, "That cannot be true! Where is she now??"<br><br> "She is in her chamber upstairs, waiting to be interred. The ground is yet a bit cold for a proper burial."<br><br> Ambrose hastens up the staircase, so intent on seeing his lost love he almost forgets to snag a beer from the hands of Albrich as he shoots past.<br><br> Running through the hallway, Ambrose skids to a stop in front of the door of his beloved. His breath coming quickly, he opens the door and steps inside.<br><br> She lays still on the bed, her lifeforce fled from her body. Summoning upon all his magical powers, he incants a spell of ressurrection. <br><br>It had no effect whatsoever.<br><br>"NOOOOOOOOOO!" screams Ambrose in profound shock, "THIS CANNOT BE SO!"<br><br>"Bah, STFU," Temporal calls from the next room.

All those days of cleaning the stables had paid off. As he walks down the halls of this great keep he now feels he is finally home. His thoughts are disrupted by a shout...."I'm begging you...anyone...wake that love sick dwarf out of his dreams, I cannot get any sleep!" <br>Piergeiron recognized the voice coming from the room.  It was Temporal.  Piergeiron knocked softly and slowly opened the chamber door to the mighty Enchanters room.  Temporal look up from his bed. "Pier" he shouted, "would you please go over and wake that insane dwarf out of his Daigeh is going to die dream, he is having again!" "I swear the high council will here about this!"  Piergeiron silently nods at the Gnome and walks out quickly heading toward Ambrose's chambers. He hears Temporal's voice still muddering curses at the situation. <br>As Pier rounds a corner he is stunned to see a man walking toward him he has not seen in months....</font></td>

He had spent much of the past several months preparing for his ascension to his rank.  Now was the time to experience the living again.  His heart continue to yearn, burning in a way, unsatisfied.  He knew she had been here.  He sensed her.  He knew.  However, he did not want to seem obvious, he did not want to share.  If those around him could only read his face it would be as apparent as getting wet in a storm.  He kept his manner stoic.  There will come a time, a moment when it would be right, a moment when he would be sure.  He would let her know.<br>The activity of the evening became too much for him.  Too much, too fast.  Still she was not here.  No satisfation to steal a glance.  No knowing if he could read her face, her manner.  With a smile he excused himself from the table.  His comrades extending their good will.<br>As he made his way from the Hall, he spoted a squire making his way.  They both nodded to one another.  The squire in gallant fashion.  He smiled as the squire past.  Dreams of youth.  He thought, he knew, the lesson in life he had come to know.  It was not the knowing.  It was not the experience.  It was not the fame, possession, or material things one strived to obtain.  Life, a true life to oneself he had come to know was to follow ones heart.  Only recently had he began to listen.  All these years.  All the battles.  The desire to prove oneself.  To who?  To what end?  The calling of the heart.  <br>As he found himself on the walls of Icewind Keep, he heard a familiar voice.<br>"Sounds fairly livily in there tonite," commented McMad.<br>"Livily indeed, my friend.  It is good to see you again," he responded extending his arm.<br>Taking the arm with his, "Aye too long indeed," McMad concluded.<br>"McMad my journey has my mind racing still.  May I assume the watch?" he asked.<br>"You sure my friend?  I would think you tired," McMad questioned.<br>"I am sure.  Please join the others," he assured.<br>"Maybe I can get some boar while it is warm.  I will speak with you tommorow my friend", as McMad made his way.<br>He smiled as he looked out upon the vastness of the darkness.  It was a cold night.  He had set his gaze.  His thoughts again turned toward her.  He saw her eyes before him.  Lost as he kept his gaze.  He looked at the fields of green growing on a hilly landscape.  Clouds chasing.  Winds blowing.  Blowing so that her cape moved.  So gently.  She began to turn.  The wind singing a soft melody in the tall grass.  His heart was warm.  His eyes searching, watching.  Turning slowing, she moved.  Her eyes.  He saw forever.  He saw all things.  They called to him.  <br><br>The frost had begun to collect on his cape as the fires died down in the Keep.  He stood watch.<br><br></font></td>
