  <hr size="1">
  <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">If you are level 55+, and enjoy playing with
  a guild that is family oriented CIW may be the place for you. CIW is on Claws
  of Veeshan faction. If you are applying you should also be on CoV faction.
  Post all the pertinent information about you and your &quot;MAIN&quot;
  character here including former guild affiliations, amount of time you play on
  a daily basis, and your goals in EQ. Then contact Qwai, McMad, or Matthi in
  game for further instructions. Pledges should plan on 3-4 weeks of
  raids/grouping with CIW before an invite is extended to them for full
  membership. New members are on a 45 day probation, and are not eligible for
  Epic fights for 60 days. Do not expect high end loot during your 45 day
  probation.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">If you have read and agreed to these
  guidelines, <a href="http://pub3.ezboard.com/fclanicewindnewmembersapplication">please
  do apply here</a>.</font></p>
