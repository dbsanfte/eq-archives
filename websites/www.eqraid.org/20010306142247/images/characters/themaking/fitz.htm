<p><b><font face="Verdana" size="2" color="#000024">1. An idea:</font></b></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">What works for me best, is to do an animation
of a character that best portrays the character's abilities. A spell, a practice
move, or even an emotion animation. Something to keep in mind, is that the more complicated
the movements, the more screenshots you will have to make and therefore will
have to put them back together again. You do not need the full idea to get
started - the way I usually work is to first take screenshot of the character
performing a movement.</font></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><font face="Verdana" size="2" color="#000024">2. The screenshots:</font></b></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">You will not escape this, you must take
screenshots of the character in game. Your target and you must not rotate, move
forward, change illusion, duck or jump during the shoot. I strongly recommend
shooting indoors where lighting is stable. I also recommend shooting in an area
where there aren't many people and especially mobs that could disrupt the
shooting session.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">I take as many screenshots as I deem necessary.
Ideally, I need a screenshot of every key frame of an animation - so that the
movement does not appear too jerky when I reassemble the frames later. Typically
I take around 50 screenshots.&nbsp;</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">If you don't crop all your screenshots at
exactly the same coordinates, your animation may appear as if there is an
earthquake, or that you may have moved during the shooting; here is a trick to
crop all your pictures perfectly:</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Why do this now? Simply to cut down my editing
work by at least half. I took many screenshots in order to make sure I captured
all the frames. In that process, I always have screenshots of some same frames.&nbsp;&nbsp;</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">I imported all the frames - I had about 50 of
them. Since I didn't take them in the perfect order that they appear - I use my
GIF program to rearrange them and figure which are the unnecessary frames. This
task may be overwhelming at first - it is very similar to trying to untie a
cluster of knots - or to do a huge puzzle; I try to match several clusters of
frames together which I then further rearrange with the other clusters. Here is
a first draft:&nbsp;</font></p>

      to have 15 to 20 frames.</font></td>

<p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Ok ok maybe I'm pushing it a
little too far now - but I really want this animation to look good, so I decide

mission statement again.</font></p>

<p>&nbsp;This animation took me two nights of 4 hours each. It is by far the
most complicated animation I have yet made. The only step that I could further
take this would be to actually model the character as a 3D model and
artificially animate the movements. I estimate that this alone can be HUGE
amounts of work for just 1 Everquest character animation - so I think this is as
far as I go. </p>
