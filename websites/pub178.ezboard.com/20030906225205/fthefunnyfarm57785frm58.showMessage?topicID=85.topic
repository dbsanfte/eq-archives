<br>
<br>
LOS ANGELES, California (CNN) -- A judge in California declared a hung jury Tuesday in the case against a white former police officer who punched and slammed a handcuffed black teenager onto a squad car during a videotaped arrest. <br>
<br>
Jeremy Morse, who was fired from the Inglewood Police Department after three years on the job, faced one count of assault under color of authority. If he had been convicted, he could have faced a maximum sentence of three years in state prison and a $10,000 fine. <br>
<br>
Shortly after Judge William Hollingsworth declared a hung jury, someone in the courtroom shouted, &quot;There's no justice here!&quot; <br>
<br>
Prosecutors said they would review the case to decide whether to retry it. Morse's lawyer said he would ask the judge to prevent another trial. <br>
<br>
&quot;The basis is that he's been tried once already, and it's unlikely any jury will convict him,&quot; said attorney John Barnett. <br>
<br>
After four days of deliberations, the jury -- which had only one black member -- acquitted Morse's partner, Bijan Darvish, of filing a false police report on the incident. He also faced three years in prison. <br>
<br>
Darvish and his attorney pounded their fists on the table in front of them when his acquittal was announced. Darvish hissed, &quot;Yes!&quot; but was told by the judge to be quiet. <br>
<br>
The jury's foreman told the court that seven jurors wanted to find Morse guilty and five stuck with not guilty. <br>
<br>
Morse was caught on amateur video shot last summer that showed him picking up Donovan Jackson, then 16, slamming him onto the trunk of a patrol car and punching him in the face -- all while the teen was handcuffed. <br>
<br>
Jackson, who was in the courtroom, showed little reaction to the findings. <br>
<br>
When asked by the judge whether any member of the jury thought the panel could agree on a verdict with further deliberations, no juror raised a hand. <br>
<br>
Jackson's lawyer told reporters after the findings were announced that the two officers would be deposed in a civil case and that she looks forward to a retrial. <br>
<br>
&quot;We are hopeful that this next time around that justice will be served and we in the meantime will proceed vigorously with the civil lawsuit,&quot; attorney Camryn Stewart said. <br>
<br>
Jackson stood next to his lawyer as she spoke but did not address reporters. <br>
<br>
Outside the courthouse in Los Angeles, Najee Ali of Project Hope said he was upset by the outcome. <br>
<br>
&quot;This is really Rodney King all over again,&quot; he said, referring to the case of four Los Angeles police officers videotaped beating King as he lay on the ground in 1991. <br>
<br>
&quot;Here we go again.&quot; Ali said. <br>
<br>
But Ali also urged those angered by the trial's outcome not to riot: &quot;Let not one bottle be thrown. Let not one brick be thrown.&quot; <br>
<br>
Standing by Ali was Mitchell Crooks, the man who shot the videotape of Jackson's arrest. Crooks said he was not surprised by the outcome because the prosecutors &quot;were not serious about trying this case.&quot; <br>
<br>
&quot;I was not asked to testify. The 20 people on the video were not asked to testify,&quot; he said. <br>
<br>
Gov. Gray Davis called on people to respect the judicial process. &quot;Let's let the district attorney decide what he's going to do, and channel your concern in a constructive, rather than a destructive, fashion,&quot; he told CNN. <br>
<br>
Los Angeles County District Attorney spokeswoman Sandi Gibbons said prosecutors would announce September 22 whether they would seek a retrial, and if they decide to do so, the retrial would begin September 29. <br>
<br>
Gibbons said her office was disappointed by the outcome. <br>
<br>
&quot;Under our system of justice, we must abide by the jury's decision. We disagree and are disappointed the jurors did not see the same crime that we did,&quot; she said. <br>
<br>
&quot;Because of the inability of the jury to reach a decision on the case against defendant Morse, the entire proceeding will be reviewed, it will be reviewed at high levels in the office to determine if another trial is warranted.&quot; <br>

I could understand him being a little rough in handling Jackson, and if the kid was fighting then it may have looked like the cop picked him up and slammed him down, but punching the kid?<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>Morse was caught on amateur video shot last summer that showed him picking up Donovan Jackson, then 16, slamming him onto the trunk of a patrol car and punching him in the face -- all while the teen was handcuffed.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--> <br>
I haven't seen the video, but if it shows that happening, then he was guilty.  The jury was wrong and the case should be retried.<br>
There is no reason, ever, to hit an unarmed and cuffed suspect regardless of provocation. <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top"> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub178.ezboard.com/fthefunnyfarm57785frm58.showPrevMessage?topicID=85.topic"> <img src="http://www.msterious.com/planet/leftarrow.gif" border=0></a><a href="http://pub178.ezboard.com/fthefunnyfarm57785frm58.showNextMessage?topicID=85.topic"> <img src="http://www.msterious.com/planet/rightarrow.gif" border=0> </a><br><br><a self href=http://pub178.ezboard.com/fthefunnyfarm57785frm58.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=85.topic&index=1><img src=http://www.msterious.com/peeps/planetreply.gif border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub178.ezboard.com/fthefunnyfarm57785frm58.emailToFriend?topicID=85.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub178.ezboard.com/fthefunnyfarm57785frm58.threadControl?topicID=85.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/deleteThreadFire.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands</a><br> <a href=http://pub178.ezboard.com/fthefunnyfarm57785frm58.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=85.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/ultimate/subscribe.gif width=20 height=20 border=0 alt="Click to receive email notification of replies"> Click to receive email notification of replies</a> <br>  <a href=http://pub178.ezboard.com/fthefunnyfarm57785frm58.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=85.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/ultimate/unsubscribe.gif width=20 height=20 border=0 alt="Click to stop receiving email notification of replies"> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies</a> <br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub178.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="thefunnyfarm57785frm85">911 Memorial<option value="thefunnyfarm57785frm28">Premiering Peeps<option value="thefunnyfarm57785frm15">Playful Peeps<option value="thefunnyfarm57785frm18">Punny Peeps<option value="thefunnyfarm57785frm19">Puzzling Peeps<option value="thefunnyfarm57785frm39">Poetic Peeps<option value="thefunnyfarm57785frm52">Peeved Peeps<option value="thefunnyfarm57785frm57">Picturesque Peeps <option value="thefunnyfarm57785frm58">Planet Peeps<option value="thefunnyfarm57785frm37">Panting Peeps<option value="thefunnyfarm57785frm24">Parody Peeps<option value="thefunnyfarm57785frm32">Pervy Peeps<option value="thefunnyfarm57785frm35">Princess Peeps<option value="thefunnyfarm57785frm23">Peeping Peeps<option value="thefunnyfarm57785frm72">Problem Peeps<option value="thefunnyfarm57785frm31">Practicing Peeps<option value="thefunnyfarm57785frm34">Pushy Peeps<option value="thefunnyfarm57785frm38">Password Peeps<option value="thefunnyfarm57785frm47">Postal Peeps<option value="thefunnyfarm57785frm71">Psst Peeps<option value="thefunnyfarm57785frm49">Perished Peeps<option value="thefunnyfarm57785frm75">Dolliez<option value="thefunnyfarm57785frm76">Blinkiez<option value="thefunnyfarm57785frm77">Chatterz<option value="thefunnyfarm57785frm80">Graphix</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#A0B0E0>- </font><a href=http://pub178.ezboard.com/bthefunnyfarm57785>Peeps</a><font color=#A0B0E0> - </font><a href=http://pub178.ezboard.com/fthefunnyfarm57785frm58>Planet Peeps</a> <font color=#A0B0E0> - </font><a href="http://pub3.ezboard.com/bthefunnyfarm57785">Peeps</a><font color=#A0B0E0> - </font><br><br> <script language="JavaScript" type="text/javascript">
