THORNTOWN, Indiana (CNN) -- Authorities say the woman who called the parents of a 6-year-old girl who has been missing since 1986 was &quot;the perpetrator of a cruel hoax.&quot; <br>
<br>
The girl's father, Mike Sherrill, said he took the news &quot;real hard&quot; and broke down sobbing while talking to reporters. <br>
<br>
&quot;I wasn't expecting this at all. When they called me with the information that we were going to have a news conference, I thought they were going to bring Shannon in here. I thought this was something,&quot; he said before covering his face and breaking into tears. <br>
<br>
His ex-wife, Dorothy Sherill, and several of her sisters also attended the news conference, but did not speak. <br>
<br>
Their daughter Shannon vanished from Thorntown on October 5, 1986, after last being seen playing with friends outside her home. <br>
<br>
The woman who called the parents claiming to be the now-grown girl has been identified as Donna L. Walker, 35, according to Indiana State Police 1st. Sgt. Dave Bursten. He said an arrest warrant has been issued for the woman whose last known address was in Topeka, Kansas. <br>
<br>
&quot;We are seeking help from the public across the land to look for this woman,&quot; said Bursten. <br>
<br>
Mike Sherrill told CNN Tuesday that he has never given up hope that his daughter might still be alive because there's been &quot;no proof she wasn't alive.&quot; <br>
<br>
He said when the woman called him Saturday he was stunned. <br>
<br>
&quot;Before I talked to her, I had a million questions that I wanted to ask her, and when I got her on the phone, I just totally spaced. ... I just went blank,&quot; Sherrill said. <br>
<br>
He said he and his ex-wife both gave their DNA samples to authorities years ago.<br>

<br>
(CNN) -- The woman accused of claiming to be the missing daughter of an Indiana couple surrendered Thursday to authorities in Topeka, Kansas, officials said. <br>
<br>
Shawnee County Sheriff Richard Barta said Donna Lynette Walker arrived at the Shawnee County Adult Detention Center with her lawyer around 5 p.m. (6 p.m. EDT). She was booked on one charge of being a fugitive from justice, he said. <br>
<br>
Capt. Timothy Phelps of the Shawnee County Department of Corrections said she will appear in court Friday morning, where a judge will evaluate the probable cause basis for her arrest and determine if bond will be set. <br>
<br>
After the hearing, the county's district attorney will decide whether to send Walker back to Indiana to face a felony charge of identity deception and a misdemeanor charge of false informing. <br>
<br>
Authorities in Lebanon, Indiana, said Walker phoned the parents of Shannon Sherrill and claimed that she might be their daughter, who has been missing for nearly 17 years. <br>
<br>
Barta said he did not know why anyone would do such a thing. &quot;Anybody who would do something like this is just not normal,&quot; he said. <br>
<br>
Shannon was 6 years old when she vanished on October 5, 1986. She was last seen playing with friends outside her home. <br>
<br>
Shannon's mother, Dorothy Sherrill, said she was happy to hear Walker was in custody. <br>
<br>
&quot;I'm excited in some ways, but it still hasn't brought my daughter home,&quot; she told reporters outside her home in Indiana. <br>
<br>
&quot;Great,&quot; said Shannon's father, Mike Sherrill, when told Walker was in jail. When told of reports that she had apologized, he said, &quot;Sorry isn't good enough.&quot; <br>
<br>
Sherrill said the only good thing to come out of the hoax was that it generated national attention which could help to find his daughter. <br>
<br>
Different names, different voices<br>
The hoax has &quot;emotionally, physically and mentally exhausted the immediate and extended family of Shannon Sherrill,&quot; Indiana State Police 1st Sgt. Dave Bursten said Wednesday at a news conference to announce the claim was a hoax. <br>
<br>
Bursten accused Walker of not only calling the parents but also telephoning members of the news media so the story would get more publicity. <br>
<br>
&quot;This has been a very cruel hoax for the family,&quot; Bursten told reporters. <br>
<br>
The motive behind the hoax was unclear, authorities said, pointing out that Walker never made any demands to police or family members. But they also said without elaboration that Walker has a history of carrying out similar hoaxes in the Virginia Beach, Virginia, area. <br>
<br>
Walker allegedly first contacted Dorothy Sherrill on July 25. She then called Mike Sherrill on Saturday, and authorities said they had been in phone contact with her, most recently on Tuesday. <br>
<br>
Authorities said she used three different names and three different voices in various phone calls to help corroborate her story. The phone calls were all made from the Midwest to western United States, authorities said. <br>

<br>
<br>
PORTLAND, Oregon (AP) -- The woman accused of calling an Indiana couple and falsely claiming to be their long-lost daughter had previously been an FBI informant, according to a published report. <br>
<br>
Donna L. Walker, who was held by Kansas authorities Friday in lieu of $100,000 bail, provided tips to authorities in Oregon and California, The Oregonian reported in Saturday's editions. <br>
<br>
Federal court papers say an informant identified as &quot;Donna&quot; frequently posed as a young girl to lure child pornographers out of the shadows of the Internet and turn them over to authorities in Arizona, California, Kentucky and Washington. Donna Walker was later subpoenaed as a witness, and federal officials as well as Walker have acknowledged that she was the informant, The Oregonian reported in Saturday's editions. <br>
<br>
Federal officials also suspect that Walker, 35, set off a wild-goose chase in Oregon that prompted investigators to search for two missing Michigan girls in January 2002. They were eventually found in West Virginia, living with their mother and her husband, a convicted pedophile. <br>
<br>
Confronted about the incident in later interviews with The Oregonian, Walker did not deny that she was behind the fraud. She blamed her lapses in judgment on multiple personality disorder. <br>
<br>
&quot;Like all criminal informants, you've got to separate the wheat from the chaff,&quot; FBI Special Agent Richard Davidson said Friday from Chico, Calif. &quot;You know what issues she's got. But she does have some good information -- or has in the past.&quot; <br>
<br>
FBI officials did not respond to calls from The Associated Press Saturday seeking comment. <br>
<br>
Walker first came to the attention of the FBI in Oregon in January 2002, the newspaper said. <br>
<br>
On January 27, dispatchers at a crisis hot line in Portland fielded a call from a man claiming he was thinking about killing himself and a teenage girl he was traveling with. A short time later, a girl's voice told emergency dispatchers that the man had kidnapped her in Michigan and that she was in a car at a McDonald's restaurant in Portland's southeast suburbs. <br>
<br>
Sheriff's deputies searched several McDonald's sites but found nothing. <br>
<br>
The girl told dispatchers she was 13 and gave the name of a 13-year-old Michigan girl who, along with her older sister, was reported missing from the Ypsilanti area. A similar call was placed the following day, and authorities again turned up nothing. <br>
<br>
The girls were found the following day in West Virginia with their mother, who was charged with illegally removing and concealing them from their father. <br>
<br>
The Michigan girls apparently were never in Oregon at the time of the searches, said FBI spokeswoman Beth Anne Steele in Portland. Walker is thought to have been behind the hoax, she said. <br>
<br>
Walker began to phone The Oregonian shortly after the hoax, using a variety of voices ranging from girls to women and, occasionally, a man. <br>
<br>
These characters offered news tips that could not be corroborated, some of them involving high-profile Oregon murder suspects Christian Longo and Ward Weaver Illinois. <br>
