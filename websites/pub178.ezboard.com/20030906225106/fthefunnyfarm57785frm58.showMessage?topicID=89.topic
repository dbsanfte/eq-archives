<br>
VATICAN CITY (CNN) -- Gay rights groups have hit back at the Vatican's global campaign against same-sex marriages, saying the appeal reflects a mix of religion and politics that is out of touch with the modern world. <br>
<br>
On Thursday, the Vatican issued a 12-page document in seven languages, approved by Pope John Paul II, calling on Roman Catholic lawmakers to block legislation granting legal rights to homosexual unions in Europe and North America. <br>
<br>
The document, which was two years in the making, urged Catholics to campaign against same-sex unions, which the Vatican sees as a threat to society and &quot;gravely immoral.&quot; <br>
<br>
The paper, entitled &quot;Considerations Regarding Proposals to Give Legal Recognition to Unions Between Homosexual Persons&quot; also makes clear the church's firm opposition to gay couples adopting children. <br>
<br>
&quot;Allowing children to be adopted by persons living in such (homosexual) unions would actually mean doing violence to these children ... (placing) them in an environment that is not conducive to their full human development,&quot; it says. <br>
<br>
While conservatives around the world welcomed the document, in Rome's gay community, the reaction was swift, with activists saying there is widespread concern the Vatican is using its considerable influence to spread homophobia and prejudice into Italian society. <br>
<br>
&quot;We are Italian citizens and not Vatican citizens so we don't want the Holy See to make pressure on our parliament,&quot; one Radical Party member told CNN. <br>
<br>
Gay rights supporters from Australia to England were quick to say they thought the Vatican was using an aggressive and cold-hearted stance to promote intolerance and stem a growing tide for equal rights. <br>
<br>
For its part the Catholic church stresses the document does not promote discrimination against homosexual relationships, but instead says same-sex unions are not the same as marriages that &quot;bring new human beings into the world.&quot; <br>
<br>
Heated debate<br>
&quot;Legal recognition of homosexual unions or placing them on the same level as marriage would mean not only the approval of deviant behavior ... but would also obscure basic values which belong to the common inheritance of humanity,&quot; the document said. <br>
<br>
The Vatican appeal comes amid heated debate on the issue in the United States, after the Supreme Court struck down state laws banning sodomy in June and two U.S. states come closer to legalizing homosexual marriages. <br>
<br>
While gay marriage is forbidden in the United States, Vermont allows same-sex civil unions while Massachusetts' top court is set to rule on the issue soon. (Ruling anticipated) <br>
<br>
The United States passed a law in 1996, called the defense of marriage act, which bans federal recognition of same-sex marriages licensed in individual states, or abroad, and the White House is considering backing an amendment to strengthen the traditional definition of marriage as man and woman. <br>
<br>
  <br>
The Vatican document has the backing of Pope John Paul II.  <br>
Earlier this week U.S. President George W. Bush made his views quite clear, saying he believed &quot;marriage is between a man and a woman.&quot; (Marriage 'for heterosexuals', White House considering constitutional amendment) <br>
<br>
Gay activists in America have slammed the Vatican document, saying they are upset because it breaks down efforts to keep the Church and the State separate and puts religious beliefs ahead of other arguments. (Episcopalians face divisive issue of gays at convention) <br>
<br>
The Vatican's document is an example of an individual denomination trying to instill its thoughts on political and legislative policies, Cathy Renna, spokeswoman for the U.S. Gay and Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation told CNN. <br>
<br>
Canada, Netherlands and Belgium now allow gay marriage and Britain is considering civil unions. <br>
<br>
In Europe, the Netherlands has recognized registered gay partnerships since 1998 with Belgium following suit in January this year. <br>
<br>
The Netherlands also passed laws in December 2000 allowing same-sex couples to marry and adopt children. <br>
<br>
Several other countries have given gays rights just short of those enjoyed by heterosexual married couples. <br>

<br>
And the problem with that line of thought in this age the Church has been outcasting the younger Parishiners.  They do not keep up with the times and the younger generation does not follow the church for their spiritual path.  So I believe the vatican is exterminating itself and they only have themselves to blame.<br>
<br>
I left the catholic faith about a year ago when I no longer felt the Church represents in what I believe.  I have kept this to myself and it has been a painfull 5 years of discovering.  <br>
<br>
My Fiance is Southern Baptist.  As with all christian religions they are very similar to the Catholic ways.  So we both decided to raise our children with an understanding of the major 5 religions and let them discover what they want to follow.  This outlook on spirituality has become very common lately.  <br>
<br>
Yes, grandma I am going to hell. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#363636><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon3.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub178.ezboard.com/bthefunnyfarm57785.showUserPublicProfile?gid=durango095>Durango095</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.box.net.au/~cirillo/smokindevil.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle><a href=http://www.imood.com/query.cgi?email=durango@evil1.com><img src=http://moods.imood.com/display/email=durango@evil1.com/trans=1 alt=The current mood of durango@evil1.com at www.imood.com border=0></a></span><br>  Posts: 106<br> <font color=#A0B0E0>(8/1/03 11:07 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub178.ezboard.com/fthefunnyfarm57785frm58.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=89.topic&index=2>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> <BR><img src=http://durango095.net/images/Hexley.png WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Gays hit back at Vatican</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>And the problem with that line of thought in this age the Church has been outcasting the younger Parishiners.

Cliona, you took the words right out of my mouth.  Even as their statements are disproven or becoming irrellivent and severely outdated, the Vatican keeps acting like it is the middle ages.  If the religion doesn't update a bit, it will go the way of the Greek/Egiptian/Norse... pantheons of gods. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#363636><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub178.ezboard.com/bthefunnyfarm57785.showUserPublicProfile?gid=thecreatureunderyourbed>TheCreatureUnderYourBed</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle><table style='Filter: Mask(Color=#8B008B)'><tr><td><span class='usertitle'>Wandering Soul</span></td></tr></table>

This is much better then what they used to do and just move the priest to a new location if there are too many complaints. <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top"> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub178.ezboard.com/fthefunnyfarm57785frm58.showPrevMessage?topicID=89.topic"> <img src="http://www.msterious.com/planet/leftarrow.gif" border=0></a><a href="http://pub178.ezboard.com/fthefunnyfarm57785frm58.showNextMessage?topicID=89.topic"> <img src="http://www.msterious.com/planet/rightarrow.gif" border=0> </a><br><br><a self href=http://pub178.ezboard.com/fthefunnyfarm57785frm58.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=89.topic&index=7><img src=http://www.msterious.com/peeps/planetreply.gif border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub178.ezboard.com/fthefunnyfarm57785frm58.emailToFriend?topicID=89.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub178.ezboard.com/fthefunnyfarm57785frm58.threadControl?topicID=89.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/deleteThreadFire.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands</a><br> <a href=http://pub178.ezboard.com/fthefunnyfarm57785frm58.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=89.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/ultimate/subscribe.gif width=20 height=20 border=0 alt="Click to receive email notification of replies"> Click to receive email notification of replies</a> <br>  <a href=http://pub178.ezboard.com/fthefunnyfarm57785frm58.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=89.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/ultimate/unsubscribe.gif width=20 height=20 border=0 alt="Click to stop receiving email notification of replies"> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies</a> <br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub178.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="thefunnyfarm57785frm85">911 Memorial<option value="thefunnyfarm57785frm28">Premiering Peeps<option value="thefunnyfarm57785frm15">Playful Peeps<option value="thefunnyfarm57785frm18">Punny Peeps<option value="thefunnyfarm57785frm19">Puzzling Peeps<option value="thefunnyfarm57785frm39">Poetic Peeps<option value="thefunnyfarm57785frm52">Peeved Peeps<option value="thefunnyfarm57785frm57">Picturesque Peeps <option value="thefunnyfarm57785frm58">Planet Peeps<option value="thefunnyfarm57785frm37">Panting Peeps<option value="thefunnyfarm57785frm24">Parody Peeps<option value="thefunnyfarm57785frm32">Pervy Peeps<option value="thefunnyfarm57785frm35">Princess Peeps<option value="thefunnyfarm57785frm23">Peeping Peeps<option value="thefunnyfarm57785frm72">Problem Peeps<option value="thefunnyfarm57785frm31">Practicing Peeps<option value="thefunnyfarm57785frm34">Pushy Peeps<option value="thefunnyfarm57785frm38">Password Peeps<option value="thefunnyfarm57785frm47">Postal Peeps<option value="thefunnyfarm57785frm71">Psst Peeps<option value="thefunnyfarm57785frm49">Perished Peeps<option value="thefunnyfarm57785frm75">Dolliez<option value="thefunnyfarm57785frm76">Blinkiez<option value="thefunnyfarm57785frm77">Chatterz<option value="thefunnyfarm57785frm80">Graphix</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#A0B0E0>- </font><a href=http://pub178.ezboard.com/bthefunnyfarm57785>Peeps</a><font color=#A0B0E0> - </font><a href=http://pub178.ezboard.com/fthefunnyfarm57785frm58>Planet Peeps</a> <font color=#A0B0E0> - </font><a href="http://pub3.ezboard.com/bthefunnyfarm57785">Peeps</a><font color=#A0B0E0> - </font><br><br> <script language="JavaScript" type="text/javascript">
