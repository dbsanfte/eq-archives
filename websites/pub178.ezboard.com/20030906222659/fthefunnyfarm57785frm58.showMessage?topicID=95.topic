MINNEAPOLIS, Minnesota (AP) -- A New Hampshire clergyman seeking to become the first openly gay elected bishop in the Episcopal Church has passed the first of three hurdles in a process that one leader warned could have &quot;severe consequences&quot; for the church. <br>
<br>
The eventual outcome could divide the church and its sister provinces in the worldwide Anglican Communion after years of rancorous debate over homosexuality. <br>
<br>
Following a tense morning hearing Friday, a committee at the Episcopal General Convention cleared the way for delegates to decide whether the Rev. V. Gene Robinson should be bishop of New Hampshire. They voted by secret ballot to endorse him and did not release the tally. <br>
<br>
The Diocese of New Hampshire elected Robinson in June, but the church requires that a majority of convention delegates ratify his election. He faces two more votes before he can be confirmed. <br>
<br>
The next vote will be in a legislative body composed of clergy and lay people, called the House of Deputies, which could occur on Sunday. If they approve, Robinson then faces his final vote -- in the House of Bishops -- possibly the following day. <br>
<br>
Robinson said he felt &quot;peaceful&quot; even as one opponent after another stepped up to the microphone at the hearing to condemn homosexuality and his candidacy. An equal number of Robinson's supporters answered back with testimony about his inspirational leadership and deep spirituality. <br>
<br>
Asked how he reconciles his relationship with his partner of 13 years, Mark Andrew, with biblical prohibitions against homosexuality, Robinson said that in Andrew's &quot;unfailing and unquestioning love for me I experience a little bit of the kind of never-ending love that God has for me. So it's sacramental for me.&quot; <br>
<br>
Andrew sat nearby, as did Robinson's 21-year-old daughter Ella, who spoke on his behalf, after which an emotional Robinson asked for &quot;a minute to recover.&quot; His diocese also released a statement by his former wife, Isabella McDaniel, calling the 56-year-old clergyman &quot;a good priest, a good husband and partner and a good father.&quot; <br>
<br>
But many who spoke against Robinson's election said their concerns about church unity and living according to Scripture outweighed their respect for him. Bishop Keith Ackerman of Quincy, Illinois, told Robinson, &quot;I love you. This is painful.&quot; Ackerman then warned of &quot;severe consequences&quot; if Robinson is confirmed. <br>
<br>
The Episcopal Church, with 2.3 million members, is the U.S. branch of the 77-million-member Anglican Communion. Conservative overseas bishops, representing more than 20 million parishioners, have said that allowing Robinson to serve would force them to consider breaking ties with the American church. <br>
<br>
&quot;The matter at hand is much larger than one person. This issue is even larger than one diocese,&quot; Ackerman said. &quot;The fragile unity in the church is in the hands of this General Convention.&quot; <br>
<br>
Despite these divisions, Robinson is expected to be confirmed. The Episcopal News Service found only two bishops in church history whose elections were rejected -- both in the 1870s. <br>
<br>
The convention, which continues for another week, also will consider approving a blessing ceremony for same-sex couples. <br>
<br>
At a hearing on that proposal Friday night, the Rev. Samuel Candler, of the Cathedral of St. Philip in Atlanta, said homosexuality &quot;is no threat to the institution of marriage and family.&quot; <br>
<br>
But the Rev. Kendall Harmon, of the Diocese of South Carolina, argued that approving same-sex blessings would violate church teaching and &quot;shatter the Episcopal Church.&quot; <br>
<br>
Robinson, who wore a button that read &quot;I Am Gene,&quot; said that during the testimony at his hearing, he silently recited verses from the Psalms about seeking God's protection from enemies. More than 500 people crammed a hotel ballroom where that meeting was held, with an overflow crowd forced to stand outside to await word of the committee's vote. <br>
<br>
He said he would not consider withdrawing his candidacy for bishop to prevent a breakup of the church, as a gay clergyman in England did recently. <br>
<br>
&quot;I'm at a very peaceful place with God right now,&quot; said Robinson, surrounded by supporters. &quot;God is very near to me.&quot; <br>

<br>
MINNEAPOLIS, Minnesota (CNN) -- Clergy and lay members of the Episcopal Church voted Sunday to approve the candidacy of an openly gay priest seeking to become a bishop in the church. <br>
<br>
The vote means the Rev. Gene Robinson is one step closer to being consecrated as bishop. The final vote is expected Monday in the 100-member House of Bishops. <br>
<br>
Robinson has been approved by his own diocese in New Hampshire, which selected him as bishop in June. A key group, the Episcopal Committee on Consent of Bishops, approved his candidacy Saturday. Robinson, 56, has been serving as assistant to the bishop of New Hampshire. <br>
<br>
Episcopalians are meeting in Minneapolis for their annual General Convention, attended by 835 deputies representing about 110 dioceses in the United States. <br>
<br>
Robinson needed a simple majority of both lay and clergy votes to be approved Sunday, which he received. <br>
<br>
Out of 108 dioceses at the convention, Robinson was approved by the lay members of 63 and the clergy of 65. Lay members from 32 dioceses and clergy from 31 voted against his candidacy. Lay members from 13 dioceses and the clergy from 12 dioceses were divided on the issue. <br>
<br>
The issue has sharply divided the 2.3 million-member Episcopal Church in the United States, which is part of the 73-million-member Worldwide Anglican Communion. Church members opposed to Robinson's approval as bishop fear an even greater split and say it could distance their church from the wider Anglican Communion. <br>
<br>
Robinson told CNN in an interview Saturday that he did not believe the issue should cause such a rift. <br>
<br>
&quot;I think all of the grim predictions about some sort of schism are probably overstated,&quot; Robinson said. &quot;We certainly lost a few people when we ordained women, but there were great predictions that there would be a real worldwide split in the church, and indeed that's not come to pass.&quot; <br>
<br>
A divorced father of two, Robinson has lived with his male partner for 13 years. One of his two daughters, Ella, 21, told the church committee Friday that she and her mother support Robinson's election, and called her father &quot;a good man and a good father.&quot; <br>
<br>
Those who favor Robinson's election say he would make a fine bishop and that it would position the Episcopal Church as a forward-moving group. They point out that Robinson and his partner share a committed, monogamous relationship that keeps them within the bounds of Scripture. <br>
<br>
Opponents of Robinson's selection say his homosexuality is contrary to biblical teaching. <br>
<br>
Hour of debate<br>
Sunday's debate continued about an hour, with dozens of church members stepping up to microphones and voicing their support or disapproval of Robinson's election. <br>
<br>
&quot;I often sign off on bishops I know nothing about, trusting the discerning work of the diocese that has called them as chief pastors of their work,&quot; said Altagracia Perez, the rector of Holy Faith Church in Inglewood, California. &quot;For once, I can vote with full confidence.&quot; <br>
<br>
Perez said Robinson's life of personal integrity and faithfulness qualified him to be a bishop. <br>
<br>
The Rev. Jeffrey Cerar of the Diocese of Virginia addressed those who would confirm Robinson &quot;because it is the polite thing to do or because New Hampshire should have autonomy.&quot; <br>
<br>
&quot;You are missing the significance of this event,&quot; Cerar said. &quot;What are we going to tell the world about the word of God? His homosexual partnership is contrary to the word of God, and he proclaims that God blesses it. That is the only reason the whole world cares what this tiny denomination says today.&quot; <br>
<br>
George Marshall of the diocese of Albany, New York, said before the vote that Episcopal support for a gay bishop would show that the church is subject to the trends of modern society. <br>
<br>
&quot;They're not seeking a church that is blown this way and that by the winds of the larger culture,&quot; Marshall said. &quot;It'll prove once again that our church doesn't have the confidence to proclaim the Gospel.&quot; <br>
<br>
Robinson had said he would be disappointed if his candidacy were not affirmed but that he would not leave the church over it. <br>
<br>
&quot;I believe that the deputies here at the General Convention and the bishops -- both those who oppose my consent and those who support it -- are doing so in a very prayerful manner,&quot; Robinson told CNN. &quot;I think they all live in a culture in which gay and lesbian folk are being more and more included all the time, but I think they are making this [decision] in the context of their own walk and journey with God.&quot; <br>
