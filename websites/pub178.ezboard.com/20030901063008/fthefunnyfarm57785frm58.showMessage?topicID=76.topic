<br>
BAGHDAD, Iraq (CNN) -- The U.S.-backed coalition provisional authority in Iraq has released photographs Thursday of Saddam Hussein's sons Uday and Qusay, hoping to convince skeptical Iraqis that the men were killed in a raid by U.S. troops. <br>
<br>
CNN.com is awaiting transmission of the photos from Baghdad and plans to publish them on the Web site as soon as they arrive. <br>
<br>
The pictures, taken after the brothers died in a firefight with U.S. troops Tuesday, have been shown to reporters, off camera. The images were described as gruesome. <br>
<br>
According to a Pentagon official who saw them, the photos are &quot;head shots&quot; that show the men apparently tried to alter their appearances by growing facial hair. <br>
<br>
Many Iraqis are skeptical about the deaths of the brothers, who were feared nationwide as ruthless killers and protectors of their father's dictatorship. (Profiles: Qusay Hussein, Uday Hussein) <br>
<br>
Former CIA Director James Woolsey said in an interview with CNN that releasing the photographs is necessary. &quot;Normally, we would not do this,&quot; he said. &quot;But I think it's necessary for the world to see and particularly for the Iraqis to see that these two are, in fact, dead, that this is not some ginned-up story from the United States.&quot; <br>
<br>
&quot;We've got to put up with a lot of lying about what has happened and what we're doing,&quot; Woolsey said. &quot;And I think, under those circumstances, the pictures are going to be necessary.&quot; <br>
<br>
A picture of Uday Hussein shows he had a shaved head and a bushy beard. Aside from the wound, he appeared relatively unscarred, Pentagon officials said. <br>
<br>
Qusay's picture showed he had less of a beard and appeared badly bruised and scarred, a Pentagon official said. <br>
<br>
Another Pentagon official said one photograph shows what could be an exit wound on the back of Uday Hussein's head, but the official dismissed as &quot;pure speculation&quot; reports that the wound could have been self-inflicted. <br>
<br>
Autopsies will be performed and the bodies could be re-photographed after they have been cleaned up, a Pentagon official said. <br>
<br>
Dental records, X-rays, and visual identifications from four senior members of Saddam's former regime who are in U.S. custody confirmed the identities of the brothers, according to Lt. Gen. Ricardo Sanchez, commander of U.S. troops on the ground in Iraq. <br>
<br>
U.S. Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld said that killing Saddam's sons was not a choice made by the United States. <br>
<br>
&quot;The task of the commanders on the ground is to do their job, and their job has been, without any ambiguity at all, to seek out, find and capture or kill the senior leadership from Iraq,&quot; Rumsfeld said Wednesday. <br>
<br>
&quot;If a person is determined to fight to the death, then they may very well have that opportunity,&quot; he said. &quot;It was not a choice that the United States or the coalition made, it was a choice that the people inside that building made.&quot; <br>
<br>
The director of the U.S.-led reconstruction effort in Iraq, L. Paul Bremer, said it was clear that the brothers did not want to be taken alive. <br>
<br>
During a visit to Washington Wednesday, Bremer was asked if U.S. troops had attempted first to capture the Hussein brothers, who presumably may have had valuable information. <br>
<br>
Bremer, who was in Washington at the time of the raid, said: &quot;We went to the door of the house, were refused entry and were fired upon, but with increasingly heavier weapons. And we had to respond and these people were found inside of a very heavily armored room. There was no way they were going to be taken alive.&quot; (Gallery: Timeline of the attack) <br>
<br>
President Bush called the deaths of Saddam's sons a sign that the former regime is gone and &quot;will not be coming back.&quot; (Full story) <br>

From what I hear, the majority of the Iraqis who have seen the photos, are convinced that they are dead.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#363636><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub178.ezboard.com/bthefunnyfarm57785.showUserPublicProfile?gid=fatwelshbirddiva>fatwelshbirddiva</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://img.villagephotos.com/p/2003-6/117507/clef.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle><table style='Filter: Glow(Color=#E6E6FA, Strength=5)'><tr><td><span class='usertitle'><b><font color='#8A2BE2'>Musical Diva</font></b></span></td></tr></table></b><a href=http://www.imood.com/query.cgi?email=raspberryjamdiva@yahoo.co.uk><img src=http://moods.imood.com/display/email=raspberryjamdiva@yahoo.co.uk/fg=#FF99C/bg=#99339 alt=The current mood of raspberryjamdiva@yahoo.co.uk at www.imood.com border=0></a> </span><br>  Posts: 80<br> <font color=#A0B0E0>(7/25/03 6:19 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub178.ezboard.com/fthefunnyfarm57785frm58.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=76.topic&index=3>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> <BR><img src=http://busmail.org/phpBB/images/avatars/gallery/reserved2/welsh_one.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: U.S. releases Uday, Qusay death photos</span><hr size=1> I just hope that Iraq can start rebuilding their lives and their country again <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :hug2 --><img src=http://www.msterious.com/hug2.gif ALT=":hug2"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  Apparently the brothers did terrible things to the people <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :( --><img src=http://www.msterious.com/sad2.gif ALT=":("><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->    <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#363636><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon3.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub178.ezboard.com/bthefunnyfarm57785.showUserPublicProfile?gid=clionabrightstar>Cliona Brightstar</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>password please!<br><img src=http://www.msterious.com/multicolorpaw.gif><img src=http://www.msterious.com/multicolorpaw.gif></span><br>  Posts: 36<br> <font color=#A0B0E0>(7/25/03 8:21 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub178.ezboard.com/fthefunnyfarm57785frm58.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=76.topic&index=4>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> <BR><img src=http://axxie.homestead.com/files/CELTIC10.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: U.S. releases Uday, Qusay death photos</span><hr size=1> Uday was the worst expecially towards women.

<!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://i.cnn.net/cnn/2003/WORLD/meast/07/25/sprj.irq.sons/vert.mortuary.jpg" style="border:0;"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--><br>
<br>
BAGHDAD, Iraq (CNN) -- Skeptical Iraqis and the rest of the world viewed for the first time Friday graphic videotape of two bullet-riddled bodies the U.S. military says are the sons of Saddam Hussein. <br>
<br>
The Coalition Provisional Authority, the U.S.-backed administration in Iraq, had released still photographs of the blood-spattered, bearded corpses to Western news agencies Thursday evening. <br>
<br>
The U.S. military took the unusual step of allowing reporters to view and videotape the bodies Friday at close range and in extensive detail to combat skepticism about assertions that Uday and Qusay Hussein were killed in an hours-long firefight with U.S. soldiers in the northern city of Mosul on Tuesday. <br>
<br>
A coalition spokeswoman acknowledged that releasing still photos Thursday may not have been enough to prove Saddam's sons were dead. Most newspapers in the region didn't get the photos Thursday in time for Friday's editions. (Iraqis react, Viewer discretion advised: Gallery of still photos) <br>
<br>
On Friday, military morticians told reporters seeing the corpses that the faces of both bodies had been partially reconstructed and prepared for viewing. <br>
<br>
Military pathologists said each body had more than 20 bullet wounds. After viewing the photos Thursday, some military officials had speculated that wounds on Uday's body could have been self-inflicted. But military pathologists struck down the notion, saying they had seen no signs of suicide. <br>
<br>
The morticians said they had also shaved Qusay's heavy beard, leaving only his trademark mustache, and trimmed the thick beard on Uday's face to the length he wore it in life. <br>
<br>
Morticians confirmed that autopsy incisions were visible on both bodies, as were multiple gunshot wounds and other abrasions. <br>
<br>
Military officials also showed reporters dental X-rays and X-rays of Uday's leg, which was severely damaged in an assassination attempt in 1996. <br>
<br>
The metal rod doctors inserted into the leg was removed and displayed with the body. Officials said the rod's model and serial number matched that of the one that had been inserted in Uday's damaged leg. <br>
<br>
The officials said the bodies would be stored in refrigeration until a family member claimed them. <br>
<br>
Officials said a military lab in Washington will conduct DNA tests on tissue taken from both bodies. <br>
<br>
Officials escorted reporters, including The Associated Press, Reuters and Al-Jazeera cameramen, into a mortuary tent at Baghdad International Airport for the viewing early Friday. <br>
<br>
The Arab network Al-Jazeera aired the videos in all their detail, while American networks, including CNN, avoided some of the more graphic portions of the tapes. <br>
<br>
Reactions, caution<br>
Iraqis were able to view the images on Arab television in many cafes and other public places. <br>
<br>
At one cafe, CNN's Rym Brahimi reported three reactions: Some said the video convinced them that Uday and Qusay were dead; some turned away from the videos' grim images; and some said it doesn't matter because the streets are still not secure and Iraqis don't have basic services. <br>
<br>
After the viewing Friday, the streets of Baghdad did not echo with celebratory gunfire as they did Tuesday when the United States announced that it had identified the bodies as those of Saddam's sons. <br>
<br>
Uday and Qusay Hussein were the second- and third-most wanted fugitives in Iraq, behind their father. (Timeline of the attack; profiles: Qusay Hussein, Uday Hussein, Flash interactive: Iraq's most-wanted) <br>
<br>
Senior Iraqi officials in U.S. custody have identified the remains, U.S. officials said. <br>
<br>
The U.S. government released the photographs through the provisional authority in Baghdad on Thursday because the U.S. military has traditionally been reluctant to release images of slain combatants. The Bush administration complained loudly when images of American dead were broadcast on Arab television networks during the war with Iraq. (Ethical questions) <br>
<br>
U.S. Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld said providing proof of the Hussein brothers' deaths could demoralize the remnants of Saddam's regime that are battling U.S. troops, encourage Iraqis to come forward with information and convince them that the regime &quot;is not coming back.&quot; <br>
<br>
Rumsfeld said he made the decision to release the photos, and it was &quot;not a close call for me.&quot; <br>
<br>
&quot;If it can save American lives, I'm happy to have made the decision I made,&quot; Rumsfeld told reporters at the Pentagon Thursday. &quot;That seems to me to outweigh the sensitivities -- the proper sensitivities -- that you have raised.&quot; <br>
<br>
Along with releasing the photographs, the United States has also granted a request from Iraq's new governing council to see the bodies firsthand. The hope is that Iraqis will believe what they hear from their fellow Iraqis, even if they don't trust the United States. <br>
