<br>
WASHINGTON (CNN) -- The Department of Homeland Security is warning that Islamic extremists might be plotting suicide airliner hijackings to be carried out before the end of the summer, with possible targets including sites in Great Britain, Italy, Australia or the eastern United States. <br>
<br>
&quot;As of mid-June, Islamic extremists may have been planning suicide hijackings to be executed by the end of Summer 2003,&quot; according to the document obtained Tuesday by CNN. <br>
<br>
&quot;Attack venues may include the United Kingdom, Italy, Australia, or the East Coast of the United States due to the relatively high concentration of government, military and economic targets,&quot; the advisory says. <br>
<br>
Great Britain, Italy and Australia were allies of the United States in the war on Iraq. <br>
<br>
Homeland Security officials said there is no immediate plan to raise the nation's threat level, but that the aviation sector has been encouraged to review security practices and implement new random measures. <br>
<br>
According to the advisory, possible targets could include national symbols, economic targets and venues that would produce many casualties. <br>
<br>
&quot;The plan may involve the use of five-man teams, each of which would attempt to seize control of a commercial aircraft either shortly after takeoff or shortly before landing at a chosen airport.&quot; <br>
<br>
Such a plan would preclude the need for hijackers to take flight training, the document says. <br>
<br>
The one-page warning, sent to U.S. airlines and others Saturday, contains words of warning and skepticism, saying some of the intelligence the government has received raises &quot;questions about the viability of the plot.&quot; <br>
<br>
Homeland Security sources said the credibility of the information is still being evaluated. One government official termed it &quot;dubious.&quot; <br>
<br>
Intelligence leading to the advisory was developed during the past several weeks and is based, at least in part, on information obtained by interrogating high-level al Qaeda detainees, according to a senior intelligence official. <br>
<br>
The Department of Homeland Security warning also says the hijackers might try to use everyday travel items, such as cameras, that have been modified into weapons. <br>
<br>
&quot;The hijackers may try to calm passengers and make them believe they are on a hostage, not suicide, mission,&quot; it reads. <br>
<br>
By doing this, one official said, the hijackers might be hoping to reduce the likelihood that passengers would take pre-emptive action, as those aboard United Airlines Flight 93 did September 11, 2001, after which the plane went down in a field in Pennsylvania. <br>
<br>
But that possibility, the advisory says, &quot;seems unrealistic given the widely publicized actions of passengers on the United Airlines Flight 93.&quot; <br>
<br>
The advisory also says the terrorists might plan to identify flights that transit through the United States or the other target countries, so that the hijackers would not need visas for those countries. <br>
<br>
Although the warning lays out specifics of the possible plot, it also says, &quot;No equipment or operatives are known to have been deployed to conduct the operations.&quot; <br>
<br>
One official would not specify what new security steps might be taken, but said one of the points of the advisory is to encourage security personnel at every level to be on the lookout for new and different terrorist techniques. <br>
<br>
Also Tuesday, the State Department reissued its worldwide caution reminding U.S. citizens of the threat of terrorist acts, citing tensions remaining from the war in Iraq as a possible reason terrorists and other groups might strike. <br>
<br>
&quot;Terrorist actions may include, but are not limited to, suicide operations, hijackings, bombings, or kidnappings,&quot; the caution said, adding, &quot;These may also involve commercial aircraft.&quot; <br>
<br>
Other potential modes of attack include conventional weapons like explosives, and nonconventional weapons like chemical and biological agents, the department said. <br>
<br>
The agency also reminded Americans that terrorists &quot;do not distinguish between official and civilian targets,&quot; which might include places like restaurants, houses of worship, schools, hotels and beaches at which U.S. citizens and foreigners congregate. <br>
<br>
Such worldwide cautions are issued periodically. <br>
<br>
Last week, a congressional report stated that U.S. intelligence agencies, including the FBI and CIA, &quot;missed opportunities&quot; to disrupt terrorism before September 11. (Full story) <br>
<br>
According to the report, senior military officials were poised to attack Osama bin Laden before September 11 but lacked the intelligence data they needed to execute their plans. <br>
<br>
The report also questions Saudi Arabia's cooperation in earlier terror probes and examines its link to the hijackers. (Saudi official, Bush meet on report) <br>
<br>
The roughly 800-page report does not point to any single clue that could have thwarted the plot, but says &quot;various threads and pieces of information&quot; were either overlooked or not put together. <br>

Monday, August 4, 2003 Posted: 1:10 AM EDT (0510 GMT)<br>
<br>
WASHINGTON (CNN) -- Attorney General John Ashcroft warned Sunday of the &quot;very real potential&quot; of new terrorist attacks against United States targets. <br>
<br>
But he also said more than 100 al Qaeda activities around the world had been disrupted by the war on terrorism. <br>
<br>
Ashcroft was speaking after a purported al Qaeda audio tape was broadcast on an Arab TV station threatening that &quot;America will pay a very high price&quot; for putting Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, detainees on trial. <br>
<br>
&quot;The potential for us to be hit again is a very real potential,&quot; Ashcroft said appearing on &quot;Fox News Sunday.&quot; <br>
<br>
&quot;The kinds of efforts that we're making, the kinds of information we're sharing with the American people, signal that we believe that there is such a potential -- but that we minimize the potential whenever we're alert.&quot; <br>
<br>
Ashcroft indicated that U.S. efforts to prevent terrorist attacks have met with some success. <br>
<br>
&quot;I feel confident that more than 100 activities on the part of al Qaeda have been disrupted and interrupted around the world,&quot; Ashcroft said. &quot;I don't know if I would say they are all al Qaeda. The network of terror has a changing face and there are different aspects of it and different players.&quot; <br>
<br>
Tape purportedly from bin Laden deputy<br>
Ashcroft's comments came as an audio tape said to be of Osama bin Laden's deputy Ayman al-Zawahiri aired Sunday on the Dubai-based Arab television network Al-Arabiya. (Full story) <br>
<br>
The speaker on the tape identifies himself as al-Zawahiri. He says the United States and its allies will pay a &quot;very high price&quot; if alleged al Qaeda and Taliban detainees at the U.S. Navy base at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, are tried in military tribunals and face the death penalty. <br>
<br>
The tape makes no mention of bin Laden. It tells those &quot;working or cooperating&quot; with the United States that America is too weak to protect itself or its allies. <br>
<br>
&quot;The crusader America will pay a very high price for any harm that will affect any of the prisoners that they are holding,&quot; the tape says. &quot;Those who are allies or helping America will pay the same price. Those who are handing over our brothers will pay the same price.&quot; <br>
<br>
If the United States should prosecute the Guantanamo detainees, the speaker says, &quot;it is sentencing its own people.&quot; <br>
<br>
&quot;We are saying to America one thing: What you saw with your eyes so far are only initial skirmishes,&quot; he says. &quot;The real battle didn't start yet.&quot; <br>
<br>
U.S. Homeland Security Director Tom Ridge said the identity of the voice on the tape was unknown. <br>
<br>
&quot;We haven't identified who actually submitted the tape,&quot; Ridge said, appearing on CNN's &quot;Late Edition&quot;. &quot;But [coming] from a terrorist, threatening American interests is not really surprising.&quot; (Full story) <br>
<br>
Montasser el-Zayat, an Egyptian lawyer who represents Islamic fundamentalists, said he is &quot;more than 100 percent sure the voice on the tape was al-Zawahiri's, because it had the same tone and 'expressions.'&quot; <br>
<br>
El-Zayat told CNN: &quot;He is my friend, and I know his voice well.&quot; <br>

Ashcroft: 'War still under way'<br>
&quot;It's not surprising,&quot; Ashcroft told ABC's &quot;This Week.&quot; &quot;It signals to us that the war is still under way, that al Qaeda still has the same intentions towards the U.S. that it did when it unleashed its savage attack on September 11.&quot; <br>
<br>
Ashcroft added that the tape represents a key reason to continue aggressive activities against bin Laden's terrorist network. <br>
<br>
Ridge told NBC's &quot;Meet the Press,&quot; Sunday: &quot;By and large, America, this is a permanent condition.&quot; <br>
<br>
&quot;The terrorists are looking at every phase of our economy, looking at how we operate.&quot; <br>
<br>
But Ashcroft and Ridge said there is no plan to raise the terror alert level above its current yellow &quot;elevated&quot; status. <br>
<br>
With anniversaries of two terrorist attacks approaching -- the East Africa U.S. embassy bombings five years ago this week, and the second anniversary of the 9/11 attacks next month -- Ashcroft was asked whether U.S. intelligence is picking up more threats. <br>
<br>
&quot;We continue to develop information that leads us to believe that al Qaeda wants to continue to strike the United States,&quot; Ashcroft replied. But, he said, it was not clear what role, if any, the anniversaries could play in plans for future attacks. <br>
<br>
&quot;My view is that one of the reasons we need to be as careful as we can be, one of the reasons we need to continue to be vigilant and continue to be active, is that we have a clear understanding that whenever we are active and we are disruptive, they delay, defer or default on their plans,&quot; Ashcroft said. <br>
