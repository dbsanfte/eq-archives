			Verant's fully 3D online role-playing game, EverQuest, was first made available to the public in February of 1999, and it was met with much critical acclaim. It also immediately became popular with both fans of role-playing games and casual players. Since then, it's become increasingly popular at an almost alarming rate. In fact, Sony just celebrated its 300,000th EverQuest subscriber. Even now, tens of thousands of hopelessly addicted players log on to EverQuest's crowded servers every day and every night in the hopes of attaining the next level for their characters or of obtaining a magical weapon, piece of armor, or another item that will enhance their characters' power and effectiveness even further.

If you've ever played a fantasy role-playing game, you'll probably find EverQuest's premise and setting to be familiar, even hackneyed. That's because EverQuest borrows liberally from many previously existing sources, especially TSR's Dungeons & Dragons pencil-and-paper game. In EverQuest's fantasy realm of Norrath, you'll find cowardly goblins and ugly orcs; thieves that pickpocket and stab their enemies in the back; towering, ham-fisted hill giants that viciously pummel any adventurers they see; and any number of other common swords-and-sorcery archetypes. It's true that EverQuest has been criticized by many for its general lack of originality, but its reliance on classic fantasy character types, monsters, and imagery is also one of the main reasons why it's been so remarkably successful. That's because Verant's team of skilled artists and modelers used EverQuest's robust graphics engine to render each of these fantasy archetypes in colorful and detailed 3D. If you've ever played a tabletop or pen-and-paper game, or if you're a fan of computer role-playing games, you'll probably be able to identify many of Norrath's fantastical denizens at a glance. And even if you aren't a fantasy role-playing expert, chances are you'll still be able to quickly acclimate yourself to EverQuest's environs and inhabitants; if you've heard of griffins, elves, and dwarves, you'll likely recognize their well-animated, fully 3D representations in Norrath. It's this effective combination of familiar fantasy imagery and attractive 3D graphics that makes EverQuest so insidiously addictive, at least at first: It's easy to lose yourself in a fantasy gameworld that actually looks like a fantasy gameworld.
<BR><BR>
But once you've familiarized yourself with EverQuest's appearance and the lay of the land in Norrath, you'll discover the game's intriguing character-class dynamics; each character class is distinctive, and each has its own particular strengths and weaknesses. One of the most enjoyable things about EverQuest (and part of the game's appeal) is attaining a new skill - which includes combat and trades such as fletching, smithing, and brewing - or a new rank of magic spells for your character. Another intriguing aspect of EverQuest is how the strengths, weaknesses, and skills of different character classes work with those of other character classes in an adventuring party. These class skills become all the more important in the high-level game - here, several groups must work together in tough dungeon raids to slay mighty dragons.
