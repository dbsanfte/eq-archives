        <img border="0" src="http://www.kgm-vazaelle.org/images/space.gif" width="20" height="100%" style="float: left">In ages past, the Iksar were a slave race, once used as labor and food by the vile snake race known as the Shissar.  The Shissar were an old and very powerful race that practiced ancient and evil magics and dared them selves to challenge the power of the gods.  The gods retaliated against these creatures by descending upon there homeland of Chelsith and unleashing a terrible green mist that literally dissolved the flesh from the bones of the Shissar but left all else untouched.  Thus with the coming of the green mist did end the rain of the Shissar and thus began the age of the Iksar.<br>
        <br>
        So then it was that the Iksar do owe there freedom as a race to the mysterious Green Mists sent from the gods, and thus it was tasting this newfound freedom did the Iksar become determined that never again shall they become slaves to another power.  To this end did Venril Sathir of the Kunzar tribe unite all the tribes of the Iksar under his rule.  To this end did his progeny conquer the face of Kunark to rule a mighty empire that knew few boundaries.  So determined were the Iksar to remain free that they would conquer and rule any that could possibly stand against them.  So then did come the Dragons.  So then did come the Ring of Scale and their war to wipe out the Iksar Empire.<br>
        <br>
        The war against the Dragons and their slave races raged on for near half a centenary.  Both sides suffered untold losses and, in the end, no true winner could be seen.  The dragons were forced to retreat finally, but not before launching one final deadly assault upon the great capital of the Iksar.  Their Empire now in ruins, those races, which had once been conquered by the Iksar, did revolt and again became a new threat.  So now do we come unto the present.<br>
        <br>
        The Iksar have gathered in their new capital city of Cabilis (New Sebilis to some) and they plot and plan to regain former glories.  Some of the Iksar leaders feel their destiny lay in again conquering the continent they once ruled.  Others feel the destiny of the Iksar lay in the far away lands of the softskins whom they see as having invaded their homeland in recent years.  A few however remember the lessons of the past.  A few still recall the ancient enemy that has decimated their empire, a few still know the one and only true enemy to the freedom of the Iksar is the deadliest creature to ever walk the face of all Norrath, the Dragons.<br>
        <br>
        So it is that was born a special group of Iksar, bent on the freedom of their race.  No longer closed-minded about the enemies of their people, these Knights remember that it was a Devine Act that gave them their freedom, and they look back to the time of the Green Mists for inspiration in the days ahead.
        And so did they form the

        Mist</i></font><font face="Papyrus" size="3" color="#008080">, drawing not only from the ranks of all the
        factions of Iksar, but also enlisting the aid of the softskins of like mind.  The Knights operate outside of the boundaries of the rulers of Cabilis.  They have one, and only one, true goal:  "The ultimate destruction of the greatest threat ever known to all of Norrath," the Dragon menace.  To this end, have they sought out many of the soft-skinned races and found those that, too, realize the threat that Dragon-kind poses to all races and joined together to exterminate this threat.<br>
        <br>
        So do the Knights now recruit those brave enough to aid them in their stand against this new menace, not as simply Iksar or Elf or Human or Troll, but rather as free beings that shall not see there races fall under the threat of the Ring of Scale.  So now shall they seek out those who will join in their crusade.  So then shall their ranks swell, and so then shall no clawed beast still walk upon the ground of Norrath.<br>
        <br>
        So are born the </font><font face="Papyrus" size="3" color="#008000"><i> Knights of the Green
