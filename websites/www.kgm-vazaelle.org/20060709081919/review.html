                        <br />
                        Review by: Tony   Kovalik <br />
                        <br />
                        Lately, as I'm lining my wife's guinea pigs' cage with the   Sunday newspaper, I've been reading about what's happening at Ford, and Enron,   and LTV Steel with a little tear welling up in the corner of my left eye; all   those people out of work and in this down economy. They have weeks off with   nothing to do but cash a severance check and pray congress extends unemployment   benefits for just a little while longer and all I can whimper is &quot;those lucky   bastards!&quot; as I am overcome with jealousy. You give me thirteen weeks of   unemployment and I'll give you the baddest level 50+ EverQuest character you've   ever seen on Ebay. And if you're fortunate enough to be out of work now, count   yourself lucky, indeed. The latest EverQuest expansion, Shadows of Luclin, is on   the shelves and has been broken in and beta tested by all us working stiffs   trying to get fired by playing it at work on the company T1. <br />
                        <br />
                        In case   you've been slaving away in a cave for the last few years and have suddenly had   your future freed up, you'll want to know that the EverQuest series, in general,   has proven to be perhaps the &quot;most successful massively multiplayer online game&quot;   in the history of a fairly young genre. Conceived of as an Internet game from   its inception, EverQuest quickly supplanted the flagging Ultima Online, a poorly   executed Internet version of a popular role-playing title, and continues to set   the pace into its latest release amid the rise and collapse of one online   persistent universe after another. Since debuting in 1999, Verant Interactive, a   division of Sony Online Entertainment, has ferociously defended both its market   share and its game's integrity. Aside from its original release and various   bundles, Shadows of Luclin represents the third retail expansion in as many   years and offers some sweeping upgrades to a game consistently tweaked with a   steady stream of patches and file updates. <br />
                        <br />
                        EverQuest's newest expansion   includes features that will benefit both newbies and veteran players reaching   their experience caps. By adding a moonscape floating high above the continents   of Norrath, Shadow's of Luclin contributes 27 new adventure zones to an already   substantial gaming universe. In addition to new items, creatures, and spells,   gamers can now choose a brand new playable character race, the Vah Shir cat man,   or adventure in the role of the new Beastlord class. Many gamers, those with a   lot of platinum anyway, will be excited to purchase the rideable horses   introduced with this expansion. For those with characters that have maxed out   their growth charts, Shadows of Luclin, offers alternate modes of character   development that benefit the gamer's alter ego by allowing he or she to   permanently add points to innate abilities or ratchet up fundamental statistics   that will aid their fighting or magic user skills and more. <br />
                        <br />
                        Beyond the   content enhancements, Shadows of Luclin gives the whole world of EverQuest a   complete face-lift. The graphical improvements come in three basic parts. As   EverQuest launched the first completely 3D game of its kind, its appearance has   become somewhat dated in light of new software and technologies. To keep up,   Shadows of Luclin employs a new 3D engine that allows for some stunning   character modeling and animation. The older parts of the realm can be optionally   overhauled with a retexturization process included in the Shadows of Luclin   install. After undergoing this bit of redecorating, the surfaces and lighting   effects are certainly enhanced with greater detail and sharpness but don't   expect any miracles. The blocky geometry doesn't go away. For instance, trees   still resemble a well talented third grader's construction paper masterpiece.   The game's animated elements, however, have undergone some pretty noticeable   improvements. First, everyone can take advantage of the new player character   customization interface that allows gamers to select a variety of eye, hair, and   face configurations. Depending on your hardware, you can take advantage of some   or all of the expansion's new player models. These new character renderings   allow for far more pleasing and realistic player appearances. <br />
                        <br />
                        Of course,   these enhancements come with a price. Not only does Shadows of Luclin retail for   about ten dollars more than any previous expansion, warranted in part by the   sheer amount of content, but its hardware requirements are pretty stiff. You'll   notice the minimums (see below) are comparable to many of its contemporary   competitors but the recommended requirements reach the level of today's current   PC technology. Often, you can disregard some the recommended mandates but in the   case of Shadows of Luclin, you'll be sacrificing most if not all of the   graphical enhancements playing on a lesser machine. Verant can't really be   faulted for raising the bar here. After all, dumbing down their product to the   least common denominator of PC is suicide in a market where high-powered   consoles are poised to enter the online market. And at a time when hardware is   dirt cheap, it's unfair to the many gamers who have invested in upgrades to   write a game to the specs of those misers still booting up their 133s with 16 MB   of RAM. That being said, gamers may want to thoughtfully consider whether or not   their current box is ready for this expansion. If your OS of choice is still   Windows 95, however, be prepared to get with the program or request a refund   soon. EverQuest will no longer play in that outdated environment as the game, in   general, now requires DirectX 8.1 which is unsupported in Windows 95. <br />
                        <br />
                        The biggest price tag on almost any online game, however, comes with the   time spent versus the rewards of playing. Verant is certainly no different in   this regard. EverQuest is designed to get you playing and keep you playing.   Inching from one level to the next, graduating from no armor, to tattered cloth   armor, to cloth armor takes a long time and at almost $10 a month you can   understand why each EverQuest expansion seems intent on keeping it's long time   customers with high-level characters happiest. But while Shadows of Luclin   probably means more to the veteran than the novice, it represents a strong   commitment on the part of Verant to keep this fantasy world long-lived and   vibrant. New gamers can be assured that getting up to speed with the base   installation and the expansions, while pretty costly, won't be a waste of time. <br />
                        <br />
                        Overall, with the right hardware configuration, Everquest: Shadows of   Luclin is well worth the money and effort. So, if your lucky enough to find   yourself downsized, make sure a new computer and an EverQuest account is part of   your retraining package. You'll have all sorts of new skills to put on your next   resume. I doubt many can claim blacksmithing or fletching experience in today's   tight job market and that might give you the edge you're looking for.</div></td>
