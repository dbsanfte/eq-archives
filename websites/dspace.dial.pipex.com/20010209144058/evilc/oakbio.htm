Arrival :<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>It was the last days of the order of the Knights Templar,
shortly after the pope's Apostolic Decree (22 March, 1312) decreeing the
dissolution of the order, and many members of the order were understandably
twitchy. Secret preparations were being made to evacuate most Templar's assets
and even society to a new, secret location. Tonight was the night. It was a
misty night and the Templar fleet had slipped into the Harbour. One or two
ships had neen noticed, but no-one would guess at the true scale of the
maneuver. Oak reported to his superior straight after matins as ordered, and
found all of his Knight Brothers assembled in the hall. Instructions were given
to assemble all their equipment and squires and put them on the supply ships
save for a set of the most basic combat needs (Armour, a weapon, and a pack
with some sundry items), which they were to keep on them, lest the need for
battle arose. As they filtered out after the meeting, Oak's eye was caught by
Joseph, his superior, who indicated he desired to speak with him. Oak and
Joseph were close - Joseph had spotted his tactical mind shortly after Oak had
been transferred into his command, and had kept him close as he was useful for
helping organise the men into a more effective fighting force in the heat of
battle. &quot;Oak, I have need of thee tonight&quot; Joseph said softly so as
not to be heard by all, &quot;there is to be a change of plan.&quot;. &quot;But
sir,&quot; Oak questioned, &quot;if you knew of this change of plan, why did
you not inform the men when you just addressed them ?&quot;. &quot;Because,
Knight, we knew of this 'Change of Plan' from the very beginning.&quot; smirked
Joseph. &quot;The Scotland destination was merely a diversion - we know there
are some informants within our ranks, so we made it appear as if we were going
to Scotland. We even put some things there to make future generations think we
had gone that way too. No-one must know our true destination, luckily it is too
unbelievable a location for most minds to comprehend&quot; he continued.
&quot;But more of that later. You must travel on my vessel. Armour up like the
rest of us and meet me on the deck at the front of my ship.&quot; With that, he
dispatched Oak.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;mso-layout-grid-align:none;
text-autospace:none'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Courier New"'>Oak
made his way back to his quarters, passing many men on the way who were
scurrying backwards and forward carrying books from the library they were
stripping bare. As he passed the library door itself, he saw a man, clinging on
at the top of a tall book-case, grabbing books and dropping them to a man
below. There was no time to wait to use a ladder, he was simply using the emptied
shelves as a ladder. The bookcase, no longer heavy from books as he removed the
last few from the top shelves, teetered, and slowly began to topple like a
domino – still with the man clinging on at the top, a book clenched firmly is
his teeth. “Nnnnnnngh!” Screamed the unfortunate soul (It’s kind of hard to
scream “Aaargh” with eight hundred pages of “The Mysteries of the Ark of the
Covenant” wedged in one’s mouth) as the bookcase crushed the man. Oak
immediately leaped to his assistance - his skills at first aid were known to be
bordering on the super-natural, though with all the Spanish Inquisition
activity lately, no-one dared speak of it. Oak fought long and hard to save the
man, and eventually got him in a relatively stable situation, enough so that he
could be moved onto a ship. Oak said a little prayer for the poor man’s health,
and departed.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;mso-layout-grid-align:none;
text-autospace:none'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Courier New"'>He
was late - very late. No time to put his armour on, he had to take merely his
leather undergarments and a couple of items in a backpack, and then race to the
ship.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;mso-layout-grid-align:none;
text-autospace:none'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Courier New"'>He
was one of the last to make it to the ship and immediately went to the top
front deck to meet Joseph. He arrived puffing and panting, and making his
apologies to Joseph, explained about the accident and said that he would depart
and armour up in his dormitory below.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;mso-layout-grid-align:none;
text-autospace:none'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Courier New"'>&quot;Nay,
Oak.&quot; said Joseph. &quot;We do not have time. We are setting sail
presently, and I have a job for thee&quot;. He handed him a bullseye lantern
that was shuttered closed; instinctively Oak went to open it as it was dark in
all the fog, but Joseph's hand, nimble despite his advanced years, covered the
lantern. &quot;No..&quot; he snapped. Even in the gloom, Oak could see the
tension in his eyes like he had never seen before. &quot;Wait until I tell you,
then unshutter the lantern and run around the perimeter of the ship, swinging
it so that all the other ships may see it. That will be the signal to start the
ritual&quot;. &quot;Ritual ?&quot; asked Oak, &quot;Are we to perform a ritual
to ask God for guidance and protection on our journey ?”<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;mso-layout-grid-align:none;
text-autospace:none'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Courier New"'>&quot;Nay
Oak, the ritual is what will deliver us to our promised land. This<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;mso-layout-grid-align:none;
text-autospace:none'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Courier New"'>world
has forsaken us - time to leave it and it’s wretched inhabitants&quot;
&quot;The new world ?&quot; quizzed Oak, &quot;The Americas ?&quot;.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;mso-layout-grid-align:none;
text-autospace:none'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Courier New"'>&quot;No.
Another world entirely. Our studies of ancient tomes found during the crusades
have revealed a way for us to escape persecution. We have unlocked the secret
of opening gates between worlds. Tonight, we journey to our new home - Dereth
!&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;mso-layout-grid-align:none;
text-autospace:none'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Courier New"'>Oak's
head was spinning, he was having trouble taking this all in. His mind was
racing trying to assimilate and make analyze all this new information, but he
was cut short my Joseph shaking him. &quot;Now Oak ! Now !&quot; <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;mso-layout-grid-align:none;
text-autospace:none'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Courier New"'>Oak
sprang into action : he unshuttered the lantern, and bounded around the
perimeter of the vessel, waving the lantern frantically, so that it almost went
out. “At least I am not in full armour”, he thought, “or else I may well have
put a foot through the decking planks!”<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;mso-layout-grid-align:none;
text-autospace:none'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Courier New"'>As
he neared completion of his circuit, he could discern a chanting sound coming
from all the ships around him, and as he rounded the last corner to meet Joseph
again, he noticed a priest, fully armoured, with resplendant white robe
emblazoned with a red cross on the chest – chanting. His eyes were glazed and
his lips seemed to be moving out of synch with the words emanating from his mouth
- which were visible ! The stream of words, deep blue in colour, glowing, and
in a language he could not read, were flowing from his mouth, straight ahead,
out to a spot some hundred feet ahead of the ship, where it was met by the
words presumably from the lips of priests on the other ships.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;mso-layout-grid-align:none;
text-autospace:none'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Courier New"'>A
hole was beginning to appear, a bright white hole, not big enough for a ship,
but as more words from more ships joined it, it got bigger, and bigger, until
it was large enough to swallow the whole fleet. At that point, Joseph turned to
Oak, hair flapping furiously in the wind which was being sucked into the portal
and smiled with the look of a young boy showing off his new toy. &quot;Hold
on&quot;, he said, &quot;This could get rough, we haven’t tried sending a ship
through before – there wasn’t enough time, we have only sent animals so
far.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;mso-layout-grid-align:none;
text-autospace:none'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Courier New"'>Oak's
ship waited back as the rear guard, waiting for the others to go<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;mso-layout-grid-align:none;
text-autospace:none'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Courier New"'>ahead,
but their time finally came. Their vessel fell in behind the last ship, and as
they got closer, they could see beyond the event horizon of the rift, but it
was very hazy. It was then that they saw a horrible sight. As the vessel in
front passed through the exact point of the vortex, the part of the ship that
was inside ceased to exist ! It was like watching a ship being put into an
invisible mincer, with only men and horses coming out the other end - both
fully armoured and glinting in the moonlight. They plummeted into the sea on
the other side of the portal and dropped like stones in the water. Suddenly
there was panic. The helmsman tried to navigate to avoid the portal, but didnt
have a hope. As the bow of the ship touched the portal, Oak saw the figurehead
disappear into thin air. Then, plank by plank, the ship began disappearing like
a salami sausage on a slicer.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;mso-layout-grid-align:none;
text-autospace:none'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Courier New"'>Soon
enough, the ship stripped away from under their feet, and they looked at each
other like condemned men in the gallows as the plank below them disappeared and
they began to fall. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;mso-layout-grid-align:none;
text-autospace:none'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Courier New"'>They
both hit the surface of the water at the same time and went deep under. Oak
looked into Josephs eyes, and for the first time, despite many battles together
saw uncontrolled panic. He went for the straps of his armour, and Oak tried to
assist him, but he was sinking too fast, and Oak’s buoyancy was causing him to
pull on the straps rather than feed them back through. After what seemed like
an age of struggling, and surely many feet of descending with no success and no
hope of repreive, Joseph obviously resigned himself to a watery grave as he
pushed Oak away with the last of his strength.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;mso-layout-grid-align:none;
text-autospace:none'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Courier New"'>Oak
floated there, watching as Joseph descended into the murky depths below him,
making no effort to bring himself to the surface, until he could make his
compatriot out no more, then turned and headed to the surface. It was lucky he
did what he did when he did, as he may never have seen the horse, fully clad in
barding, legs thrashing like it was running the race of its life, with bubbles
streaming from its nostrils hurtling towards him, along with a whole stream of
things above it, as if there were a huge conveyor belt dumping its unfortunate
load into the sea. The image of the whole of his order in one huge pile on the
bed of the ocean almost made him gag and loose what precious little breath he
had left, but he managed to contain it and kick out to the side of this rain of
death.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;mso-layout-grid-align:none;
text-autospace:none'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Courier New"'>His
lungs were burning with the desire for air by now almost felt like they were
going to explode, and the pain as well as the anticipation were almost too
much. The most dreaded fear at the back of his mind was that it all may be an
anticlimax and the air on this new world that he now raced to embrace may not
even be breathable !<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;mso-layout-grid-align:none;

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;mso-layout-grid-align:none;
text-autospace:none'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Courier New"'>At
last he broke the surface, and gulped for breath, almost not wanting to breathe
though - he didn’t feel like he had the right to when all his brothers could
never enjoy the luxury of tasting this world’s air, which was fresh and sweet,
with unfamiliar scents. He began paddling towards a silvery strip of sand he
could make out not too far away and he scanned the area - there was no debris
as only living things and their clothing had been transported, not a single
sign save for himself remained that the Templars ever existed in this world.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;mso-layout-grid-align:none;
text-autospace:none'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Courier New"'>Exhausted,
he crawled out of the water, and dragged himself up on to the sand of this
foreign land near to a curious large crystal, and collapsed, cold and weary
into unconciousness onto the soft sand.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
