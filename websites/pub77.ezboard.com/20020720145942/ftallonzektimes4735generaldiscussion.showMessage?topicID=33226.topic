Read this book. I am hoping someone with a religious background on these forums has read this book already. I just finished reading it earlier this week. I have read quite a few of the gnostic texts already and this book has tied it all together.<br>
<br>
It states, with as much proof as is possible considering the subject matter, that Jesus the Christ's ministry lasted just one year, that he was certainly not the messiah, that in fact, he never claimed any kinship with God whatsoever. The true purpose of the book was to trace the Freemason's origins back to the Knight's Templar, but once the author's began to search into the history, far more came to light. <br>
<br>
If you have any interest in Egyptians, Freemasons, have any doubts about religion, I would definately recommend picking up this book. I think it would be quite hard for anyone to continue believing in Christ as he is portrayed today after reading this book. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub77.ezboard.com/uphaonofrivervale.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Phaon of Rivervale</A> at: 7/13/02 2:47:03 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000028><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub77.ezboard.com/uastitious.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Astitious</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Griefer of TZT admins</span><br>  Posts: 3634<br> <font color=#FFFF00>(7/13/02 2:52:50 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub77.ezboard.com/ftallonzektimes4735generaldiscussion.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=33226.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.thespark.com/askjesus/graphics/jesus_3.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Christians, Catholics, Iffy Religious folks, read Hiram </span><hr size=1> Thanks, just ordered it.

There have been several serious works written since the discovery of the Gnostic Texts.<br>
They shed a different light on the first century, and should be read by anyone interested in that time period and the beginnings of the Christian church.<br>
Having a copy of the Gnostics texts to refer to while reading a book like this, I would think, would be recommended.<br>

&quot;Thanks, just ordered it. Should be a good read. Kights Templar were pretty close to gnostic tradition and even worshipped a Goddess of wisdom named Sophia. When they were betrayed by the Pope and the King of France, the few that evaded being burned alive went underground.&quot;<br>
<br>
Hehe... sounds kinda funny coming from you.  Don't tell me you buy into the occult myth of the Templar while being such the skeptic...?   Oh, and the 'few that evaded being burned alive' constituted 90% of the Knights Templar -- hardly a number that begs use of the word &quot;few&quot;.   In 1310 there were 546 Knights Templar, after the trials 50 were burned and four years later two of the leaders were burned. <br>
<br>
It is interesting to note that *all* of the Templar remained faithful to christianity even to the end, under pain of torture and threat of burning.  None of them admitted to any of the charges of the trial.   I guess that's what you expect from a group of excommunicated nobility given their second chance at salvation by going to the holy land in the hopes of martyring themselves. <br>
<br>
The Knights Templar were accused of heresy more for their banking activities than anything else. <p><center><b>Havlen</b><br>

Some of the theories presented were presented as just that. Theories, and nothing more.<br>

But.. the majority of the information dealing with Jesus, and his brother James are completely documented within the gnostic gospels.<br>

Of course, the Vatican refuses to acknowledge any of that. Are you doing the same?<br>

Just because something is documented doesn't neccisarily make it true. <br>
<br>
I think the words used would be &quot;credible source.&quot;<br>
<br>
When the masons, the &quot;templar&quot; masons, the illuminati and other such organizations began springing up in the 18th century a new word was added to the dictionary and that word was discovery with suitable quotation marks around it.  And, trust me, a &quot;discovery&quot; is far different than a discovery.<br>
<br>
For example, while I will tend to believe what Peter Partner says about the Knights Templar in his book: The Murdered Magicians, I will not take with equal value anything that a mason might write about the same organization.<br>
<br>
I guess it would be the difference in reading a book written by a historian with no real agenda and reading one by a historian with a very real agenda.<br>
<br>
Just as I tend to take historical theology written by a Christian with a suitable grain of salt, so do I take the same writings from a mason.  (And so would I read information from a right wing organization, or a left wing organization, or pretty much anything coming from someone that has already made up their mind on the subject and are simply picking out facts -- or portions of facts -- that seem to coincide with their own opinions)<br>
<br>
Regardless, I'd probably find it an intersting read.  I wouldn't waste money on it, but I might check the local library for it. <p><center><b>Havlen</b><br>

I didn't specify which documentation I spoke of, what I said holds true for all documentation.<br>
<br>
You could find ancient roman records stating that Jesus Christ was a four foot tall chinese woman, and that wouldn't prove the height, sex, or  race of Jesus Christ, only that you found a record.  <br>
<br>
Just think of the recent faux pax of the Chinese Newspaper taking an article out of The Onion stating that the Senate was threatening to leave Washington DC if new facilities were not built as truth.   Now, instead of a Chinese Newspaper, think of it as a historian seven hundred years into the future coming across the remnents of an issue of The Onion where that was the only article still legible.  <br>
<br>
That historian might think he had found documentation showing that the U.S. Congress was unhappy with Washington DC, but that, again, doesn't make it true.<br>
<br>
I just find it funny, at times, that though most of us know that hearsay is not fact, we often view it as fact when it is put into written form.  <p><center><b>Havlen</b><br>

<br>
Understanding the purpose/motivations/agenda of an author is important.  <br>
<br>
However, alternative viewpoints are important too. It's up to the reader to determine what is valid and what is not. <br>
<br>
I don't know if this book is the slam-dunk it is reported to be because I have not gotten my copy yet, but what I have read about the histories of the Christian and Gnostic faiths in the first 2 centuries CE tend to coincide with what I have heard of it so far.<br>
As does what I have read about the Templars and other knightly orders from the Crusades. <br>
<br>
History is full of hearsay, myth and propaganda. Which is why sometimes the best use for History is as allegory. Take from it what lessons you can so you can make better choices in the present.<br>

Certainly no actual proof of anything in the past can be proven anymore, but the documents the authors refer to have been carbon dated to belong to the period when Christ was out and about. The evidence given certainly paints a far more believable picture that almost fits into the gnostic gospels like a missing puzzle peice. <br>
<br>
What is more viable? That Jesus is the son of God, or that he was just a man who had high moral values, who disagreed with the religion of that time vocally, and got his ass kicked for it?<br>
<br>
There is far more proof out there that Christ was the latter, rather than the former, but you won't find that proof unless you go looking for it. They certainly won't be preaching to you that Christ is just like us on Sunday morning, will they?<br>
<br>
The Vatican refuses to acknowledge any gnostic works whatsoever. Hell, they wouldn't even let radiocarbon dating tests be done to the Shroud of Turin until 1988. And look what that got them.. the thing can't possibly be any older than from around 1100-1200 AD.<br>
<br>
The original purpose of the authors were to see if the Knights Templar had any linking to current Freemasonry. The information about Christ that came to light was a by-product of that. So in context, it would be like a historian looking for information about the cultural heritage of Australia, and finding penguin eggs there.

I have not read this book, nor can I currently afford to. So cant argue it's validity, but carbon dating isnt enough, and because he says his goal was to find said &quot;links&quot; doenst always mean that it was his goal. <p><br>

The Masons have been trying to 'prove a link' to the Templar since almost their own beginning.  What I find interesting is that they first tried to link themselves to the Knights Hospitaller (the Knights of St. John), but -- probably because the Knights of St. John still existed -- changed this to linking themselves to the Templar.    <p><center><b>Havlen</b><br>

<br>
- C-14 dating has been around only about half a century. So, an assumption has to be made that the amount of C-14 (approx. .0000765%) has been consistant throughout the approx. 40,000 years it is supposedly legitmate for applying against.<br>
<br>
- Since sunlight causes the formation of C-14 in the atmosphere, and normal radioactive decay takes it out, there must be a point where the formation rate and the decay rate equalizes. This is called the point of equilibrium. In the same way the C-14 is being formed and decaying simultaneously.<br>
<br>
A freshly created earth would require about 30,000 years for the amount of C-14 in the atmosphere to reach this point of equilibrium because it would leak out as it is being filled. Tests indicate that the earth has still not reached equilibrium. <br>
<br>
There is more C-14 in the atmosphere now than there was 40 years ago. This would prove the earth is not yet 30,000 years old. This also means that plants and animals that lived in the past had less C-14 in them than do plants and animals today. <br>
<br>
- The two principles C-14 dating hinges on is not scientifically proveable. 1) The amount of carbon-14 in the atmosphere has always been constant, and 2) its rate of decay has always been constant.<br>
<br>
- Present testing shows the amount of C-14 in the atmosphere has been increasing since it was first measured in the 1950's.<br>

<br>
No it wouldn't.  That theory doesn't account for events that would effect the amount of C-14 in the atmosphere.  <br>
<br>
Considering that Carbon Dating has given results of 45,000 years (and is supposed to be accurate to 60,000 years, though different scientist disagree on the accuracy) and Potassium-Argon dating has dated rock formations to billions of years... well, lets just say there is as much or more evidence to support the earth's age being greater than 30k years than there is of it being equal or less than 30k years.<br>

You're forgetting that the process was perfected against tree-ring dating which provides a consistent and reliable record for the last 8000 years.  If the process of carbon dating were as untrustworthy and variable as you're trying to suggest, scientists wouldn't be getting consistent results that match the tree-ring dates.<br>
<br>
And if you're honestly trying to say (with a straight face) that the earth is less than 30,000 years old, then maybe now would be the time to share your theory that the Grand Canyon was carved by hand.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000028><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub77.ezboard.com/btallonzektimes4735.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=formereqplayer>formerEQplayer</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 1374<br> <font color=#FFFF00>(7/16/02 11:27:54 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub77.ezboard.com/ftallonzektimes4735generaldiscussion.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=33226.topic&index=19>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re:</span><hr size=1> Scientists have been fully aware for 50+ years that C-14 methods have their limits if used in isolation. Therefore, scientists don't just measure the C-14 in an object and trust that the result matches some theory devised in perfect laboratory conditions. Instead, current radiocarbonic dating methods use highly calibrated dating tables that correlate C-14 data from thousands of objects with historical sources (including the Bible), dendrochronology (the treerings Madison mentioned), as well as lake varves (layers of fallen leaves in lakes) and ice cores from Greenland. Together, these sources provide very accurate records of atmospheric carbon absorption rates going back to 15,000 BC with a statistical error of +/- 5%. Furthermore, scientists don't just date isolated objects, they date the object as well as elements in its surrounding radiological environment to help eliminate further sources of error. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#00000F><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub77.ezboard.com/uastitious.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Astitious</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Griefer of TZT admins</span><br>  Posts: 3644<br> <font color=#FFFF00>(7/17/02 12:12:23 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub77.ezboard.com/ftallonzektimes4735generaldiscussion.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=33226.topic&index=20>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.thespark.com/askjesus/graphics/jesus_3.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Re:</span><hr size=1> I just got my copy of this book and I must say it kicks ass.
