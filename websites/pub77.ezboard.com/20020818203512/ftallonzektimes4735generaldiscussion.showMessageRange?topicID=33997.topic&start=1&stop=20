More importantly, I think there's some good wisdom in your retirement post that shouldn't be buried 100 posts deep in some flame-filled-thread.  Let me know if you want me to nuke this post and I'll happily do so.<br><br>More than anything, the sentiment you voiced about that &quot;tight&quot; feel is exactly what is missing in the EQ experience for me.  Even DAoC, which was superior in many ways, still missed that feeling.  In order to get the really big things done, you needed a guild with several dozen... maybe over a hundred people folks cooperating.<br><br>So many conflicting personalities... too many, with varying levels of temperment and maturity.  These games unfortunately aren't designed with the small tight crew in mind.  They were designed for a large mass of troops, ruled with an iron fist by a knowledgable few.  Mastery of game mechanics and discipline defined success...  not some vaguely defined bond between a small crew of guildies.<br><br>But I ramble, on to the post:<br><br><!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> A late retirement post by me...<br><br>Damman had no say in the matter about loot. I made the call then and am glad we did it. We lacked the experience, equipment and the skill to even take down Vindi at one point. We gear our MT up and boom, we start knocking down mobs, slowly but surely. Next we start gearing up other MT's and more falls to us. Right or wrong, I am glad I did it and I am glad the officers backed me up, even though we didn't always agree on it, it worked. Were there better ways? Possibly, but that was the fastest way to gear up an undergeared guild imo and I was in a position to call the shots if I deemed it necessary. Can anyone tell me any of those guys, bar the druids who really got the short end, would have been better off gearwise anywhere besides DO/Ven, bar PDM? If you don't like it and were a member, fine. Blame me. I made that call on the MT's and don't regret it one bit. I do regret the fact that we weren't able to take down more things and spread out a bit more wealth. As I said, druids got screwed.<br><br>I look at all of these posts bitching, whining, flaming and I realize why EQ is no longer that important to me. People like Asti and the legion of PDM kiss-asses come here to rail constantly. Hell, all we wanted to do was compete. PvP, spawns, whatever. We fought PDM more than any other guild. We gave them more competition than any other guild. We rarely won, but man, when we did it was sweet. Too little too late? The crime would have been not trying. I would rather try and fail then never try at all. You want a challenge? Try it yourself, otherwise your words are hollow.<br><br>These newcomer fuks in PDM, especially the latecomers, never experienced the united &quot;lights&quot; continual attacks or even before that fighing Reformation or whatever. They don't understand what it was like to not be in the top guild, to fight against the odds, therefore have no appreciation of what a struggle it really is to keep people motivated, fighting and most importantly, enjoying the game against at what may seem an insurmountable foe. All they see is a target, it's like the bully in the locker room, they feel like they gotta chip in or be ostracized. The previous guilds they were in were nothing more than stepping stones to be stepped on, but not thought about until they reached their goal.<br><br>Light team? Light team was dead and gone by the time we organized to fight. There was no light team &quot;help.&quot; Did they help us fight? No. Did they attack us? No. Did some level 53 member of random_light_guild_19 attack Kamzan? No. They were speedbumps to members of PDM so anyone claiming that organizing the light team would have been the trick, I say buy a clue. We organized to compete. This alliance with Sedition is a chance to compete. Why bitch about it or flame? Afraid another Sleeper is going to blow up in your face Asti?<br><br>Some people bitch that DO/Ven should have taken a more prominant role in organizing the &quot;light team.&quot; But approximately half our guild realized that those days were over, it was guild vs guild. Gunzo states its about loot. It's not about loot, its about competing. I never played on a PvP server for loot. Why else would I spend a solid week or more fighting PDM1 level 57- 60's with my uber Plague spell at level 53? I was in it to compete, gear was a means to compete and thats it. Don't get me wrong, it is fun to get gear once in a while, but nothing compares to taking your 6 against 6 from PDM and kicking their ass. My first fight like that was near the zone to swamp in TT. Me, Shimazuul, Shaade, Tonyaa, Mythd and ... Gunar I think, versus Deebee (he was major scary at the time, just done with BotB I think) and a crew. We lost 2, they lost 6 and they jumped us as we were exping. Ever since then, I got a rush knocking down the biggest and baddest I could take. In Invicta, we used to grab 6 and a porter and do a /who all pand and go to wherever they were and fight. I ended my EQ career with at least one killshot of almost every major non-human player. Although I killed Ramic with my alt DE wiz  Anyway, I ramble on with old memories.<br><br>I have much respect for the old-school PDM. My enemies, yes. But I always got along with them for the most part, no matter how shitty the situation because they came from similar backgrounds I guess. One teamers, eventual crossteaming (3 or 4 team don't matter once you cross the line in my opinion), feel like the whole server, or at least the competitive part is against you... If the situation had been different, there are some old-school PDM I would have been proud to have been guilded with. Kamzan, Croazil, Gaylen, Rummol, Atomo, Mythd, etc. But just like DO/Ven or any other guild, they had their share of bad apples. The difference is, they were on top.<br><br>Veneration truly has/had some top quality nice people in it. I can't say enough about Damman, Dummywummy, Oadina, WK, Jeris, Arack, etc. People that would go out of their way for others and never expect anything in return. Same could probably be said if I was guilded with others, hell, maybe even Asti. That's why I tried to never fully give in to the &quot;So and so is a #$@#% theory.<br><br>Piek, you were a bigger man in my eyes before you started taking shots. You don't expect people to be at least a little bitter when you leave them? C'mon man. Your leaving, along with the retirement of others and the jumping ship of even more caused a fundamental change in the way they have to play if they want to compete at at least the level Ven was earlier this year. So it comes down to changing your ways and competing or fading into anonymity. Now you wanna take shots when they are down? You are part of the reason. My retirement is part of the reason. I still think you are a pretty cool guy and pretty smart to boot, but I expected you to understand how people would feel betrayed. Especially when people warned me about you and this move before you were ever guilded. Ever been in a bad breakup? I sometimes think leaving an EQ guild is like that. Not just Ven, look at any guild and you will find a number of examples.<br><br>What finally did the game in for me was the lack of tightness. Raiding is fun and all, but I would rather be with a few close friends doing things I never thought a group of 6 could do. I will never forget the time in Sebilis when Me, Shim, Tonyaa, Mythd, Shaade and Litening went deep, got a major train and survived. Some of the most fun fights ever. Or breaking into a dark-controlled Sebilis with FE when Gunar played more. We tried sooo many times, succeeded only about half. Some of the most fun times I ever had in EQ. I miss those days, knowing your buds had your back, taking on things too big for you, doing things when you had no clue how to do them cause you didn't comb the spoiler sites. But above all, staying up till 3 in the morning on a work night having a blast as you port from zone to zone killing any enemy you see.<br><br>Another thought. Anyone remember the time in Invicta when we pulled Vindi before anyone else had ever tried, just to see how tough he was. He annihilated us. The small group stuff and the getting in over our heads things in FE/Invicta were the most fun days in EQ for me.<br><br>Anyway, that's my point of view. Agree or disagree, that's fine. I had fun and don't regret too many things. I hope you all enjoy your times in EQ and I hope you try and remember that it is a game to other people too. Try and be a nice guy and revive that guy/s you ganked if you can, you will find that at least being courteous will make you far more friends and give you far more enjoyment in EQ than being bitter. Getting an &quot;I owe your ass one&quot; from Deloth brings a smile to my face and sure beats getting a &quot;You prick! I am going to CC you, your mother, your dog and your whole guild from now until SB comes out!&quot;<br><br>I may still pop in once in a while. Damman and Zimen still have access, so don't try and cyber me until you are sure it is me. Good luck to Veneration and Sedition both, I will keep my eyes out for both your guilds. Veneration, my old guildmates and Sedition which seems like a mirror of the way things were in Invicta. <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br><br> <p>Umli Foehammer - Healer of Eir <BR>Modric Foehammer - Skald of Braggi <BR>The artist formerly known as Utumno  <align="left">    <table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="650">      <tr>        <td width="200" valign="bottom" align="left"><IMG src="http://www.playerbase.com/images/umlimodric.jpg" width="292" height="215"> </td>        <td width="50%"> <IMG src="http://www.playerbase.com/elysium/images/me/ubahninja.jpg" width="320" height="240"> </td>      </tr>      <tr>        <td width="50%"><I>Clan Lord</I><BR><I><B>Einherjar</B></I></td>        <td width="50%"><i>Member of the Zeebbo and Sorsisis Ninja'z 4 Hire Yo Club</i></td>      </tr>    </table></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000028><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub77.ezboard.com/uandromachus.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Andromachus</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 4<br> <font color=#FFFF00>(8/2/02 1:11:09 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub77.ezboard.com/ftallonzektimes4735generaldiscussion.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=33997.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Mordan's Retirement Post</span><hr size=1> Way to take the ball on this one Utumno.<br><br>Mordan, I wish you luck in whatever you do, in the few times we have met you have always been fair even under the hardest of circumstances, good luck with retirement.<br><br> <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#00000F><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub77.ezboard.com/udeddcat.showPublicProfile?language=EN>dedd cat</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Not just for <br>breakfast anymore</span><br>  Posts: 3802<br> <font color=#FFFF00>(8/2/02 1:13:27 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub77.ezboard.com/ftallonzektimes4735generaldiscussion.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=33997.topic&index=2>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Mordan's Retirement Post</span><hr size=1> mord was the only &quot;true&quot; guildleader i ever worked with in eq.<br><br> <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000028><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub77.ezboard.com/urakuzatz.showPublicProfile?language=EN>RakuzaTZ</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 79<br> <font color=#FFFF00>(8/2/02 1:38:48 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub77.ezboard.com/ftallonzektimes4735generaldiscussion.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=33997.topic&index=3>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Mordan's Retirement Post</span><hr size=1> I think he would have posted that here if he wanted it read... but that's not for me to decide.<br><br>A good post indeed... shed's some light on why the FE/HR merger talks failed way back and why Invicta was formed.<br><br>Good luck to you Mordan.<br><br>Kilithyr Tekn'dius<br>Tryndamere Elfbane<br>Kyladrine Elfbane<br>Rakuza Ikky <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#00000F><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub77.ezboard.com/ushimazuul.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Shimazuul</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 1277<br> <font color=#FFFF00>(8/2/02 1:40:00 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub77.ezboard.com/ftallonzektimes4735generaldiscussion.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=33997.topic&index=4>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Mordan's Retirement Post</span><hr size=1> I was debating about doing this too, but Utumno beat me to it.

I never thought I would have been half as loyal to anyone else.  Then you came a long.  You always stood your ground no matter how many people thought plan B was better and you know...your plan A was always the right one. I feel guilty because this game became fun to me again at your expense.  People out side of your guilds have missed out on one of the funniest, most loyal, straight to the point, understanding, level headed guys I have ever known.  I am just glad I got to be guilded with you as long as I did.  <br><br>It sucks we didn't get to hang out as much as I would have liked to.  I won't forget ganking groups of people from Kael with us as a duo.<br><br>EQ isn't really a way of life.  But regardless of what people say you do meet a lot of friends over, yes...a video game. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub77.ezboard.com/uculver.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Culver</A> at: 8/2/02 5:02:30 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#00000F><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub77.ezboard.com/uiven.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Iven</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/white_fire.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 2157<br> <font color=#FFFF00>(8/2/02 5:21:59 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub77.ezboard.com/ftallonzektimes4735generaldiscussion.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=33997.topic&index=20>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: re</span><hr size=1> Mordan was always a classy guy.
