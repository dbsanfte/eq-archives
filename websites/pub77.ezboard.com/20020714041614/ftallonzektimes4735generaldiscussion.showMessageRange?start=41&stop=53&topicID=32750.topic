<br>
That is not true...you can grow your own vegetables but instead most buy them at the store.  Why?  Because it is not as easy to grow as some would think, at least of higher quality.  There is also the space needed, equipment and time which some think they just don't have.  So it could easily be grown on farms in America and sold to stores and taxed for a god awful amount and guess what...folks would still buy it like crazy.<br>
<br>
" Almost all pot is grown locally. Hydroponic pot is better. That and the profit margin compared to the volume needed to ship means no one traffics large amounts of pot over the border."<br>
<br>
Another incorrect assumption.  This depends alot on your location in the country of course but I live in Texas and I can guarantee you that at least 75% of my weed comes across the border and not from Afghanistan incidentally i.e. I do not support Osama!  <p>Ccraxtd Skullz<Br>49 Shaman<Br><Br>Gammal<Br>35 Warrior<Br><Br>

<br>
The answer to this question stares us pawns in the face every day of our lives.<br>
<br>
It's three fold. I'll sum it up quickly and leave the debate up to the blind.<br>
<br>
First off, the government constantly seeks to manipulate and control, and they do this through force and no other means. The <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> must</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> have a so-called <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> enemy</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> in order to justify their bogus military and intelligence community. They simply could not pull off the horrible, insane and inhumane things they do, without the mass hysteria which is perpetuated through the media by way of the <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> enemy</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->.<br>
<br>
First reality of the drug war, control. You have no rights, you only have privileges. And the government can take these away at any time.<br>
<br>
Second reality, profit.<br>
<br>
There is a serious profit being made by the government in it's &quot;War on Drugs.&quot; By labeling it a war, they involved the military industry, and a huge market for law enforcement now exists. On top of this, prisons are being privatized more and more, and each person who gets prison time is nothing but a market value. They not only want people in prison, they <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> need</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> people in prison to keep this market alive.<br>
<br>
The medical industry also makes a huge amount of profit by the illegalization of these drugs. Note that each of the key illegal drugs are very easy to grow and harvest. Ease of obtaining such chemicals, would put a hurt on the high cost drugs marketed today by the leading pharmaceutical players.<br>
<br>
Take marijuana for instance. It can be grown at home with <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> ease</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->. This doesn't allow market control, like they have with alcohol or tobacco. Thus the &quot;marijuana tax laws.&quot;<br>
<br>
The anti-drug agenda is a multi-billion dollar industry.<br>
<br>
Lastly, suppression of &quot;third world&quot; economies. There are many nations who would no longer be &quot;third world&quot; if drugs were legal. The United States has always been run by money. Democracy is it's propaganda tool, the faces change, the system does not. It always has been, and always will be run by the top elite of the moment. i.e. which ever industry pulls the largest market share.<br>
<br>
The US has always waged economic war and espionage against the world. Almost all, if not all,  of our &quot;major&quot; wars have been fought over economy and resources... The Revolution was to gain control of taxes and home resources, the Indian wars were to secure land and resources, the Civil war was the Northern industries securing the Southern farming, WWII was to pull the economy out of the depression and secure resources across the Pacific, Korea was to continue the military complex (which was created in WWII) with funding against the <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> enemy</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->, The Vietnam War was all about the military complex and chemical industries, the War in Iraq was 100% about oil (the Bush family is in oil), the war in Afghanistan is mainly again about oil and securing a launching pad for future US military operations in the region... everything else you have heard about these wars were merely propaganda tools.<br>
<br>
The Drug War keeps a lot of small nations in check. It allows the US military to supply not only itself, but for the private industries which support the military to gain profit also by export. It is not just an economic tool, it is also a diplomatic tool.<br>
<br>
This is the exact reality of the Drug War. Eat the truth for a change, and stop being blind to the nation we really live in. The system does not do things for the same reasons &quot;you&quot; do things. The system does not care about you, the individual is insignificant. The faces change, the system does not. The system was designed to only care about one thing, money. And the system will only make small changes, when there is more money to be had.<br>
<br>
Take in stride, the new War... the War on &quot;Terrorists.&quot; In that, the pattern will continue. There will be no good things to come out of using the military, or increasing the power of force. Good never comes of these things. You must watch the profit makers, that is where the reasoning always stands.<br>
<br>
If you are against the system, you are an <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> enemy</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->. If they push, and you push back, you are a <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> terrorist</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->. Not a &quot;freedom fighter&quot;, not a revolutionary, a <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> terrorist</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->. And I tell you, the system always pushes, always uses force, in it's endless quest to find the <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> enemy</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> in order to justify support for the system. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000028><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub77.ezboard.com/uennder.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Ennder</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/globalBlack.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 1482<br> <font color=#FFFF00>(6/29/02 9:40:39 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub77.ezboard.com/ftallonzektimes4735generaldiscussion.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=32750.topic&index=52>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Reality of the War on Drugs</span><hr size=1> Well the original article was complete crap.  First off there is no proof that if everyone stopped drinking the world would be better.  There have been many studies done that show that without entertainment society would collapse and alcohol is part of a lot of peoples concept of entertainment.  <br>
<br>
Next he goes on about Marijuana corrupting the police.  Sorry to say but corrupt people will become corrupt in one way or another.  I don't really thnk you can blame that entire problem on one drug or drugs in general.  I'd rather my cops were making their extra money by letting drugs in the country than say... letting bombs in the country, or letting murderers go free.<br>
<br>
<br>
Finally he states that the biggest drug we import to support terrorism is gasoline.  Which is pretty funny since last i heard gasoline wasn't classified as a drug.<br>

Liberals make this country weak they are always worried about the terrorist that are in Cuba, they want to make sure they get 6 square meals a day and all this other stuff, but yet if it was an American soldiers that was captured by them they would no longer be living but who gives a shit about our men and women that fight for our freedom's right? Well I do.<br>
<br>
They want to give the Taliban flowers and sing song's about love to them and think that there hippie ways will change these people minds who only know one thing and that's death/murder.<br>
<br>
We taught these people in the middle east how to remove the oil from there sandy lands and this is the thanks we get for the wealth and fortunes we have given them. If it wasn't for the USA they still be trying to selling sand and opiates (which the still do I might add) but then again your a hippie you probably like heroin and that is why you stick up for them.<br>
<br>
Your lucky you have freedom of speech in this Country, I will say this you do have the right to voice your opinion, I am just glad not everyone think's as you do. Perhaps you like attention, or perhaps you enjoy going against the grain. I am wondering if you have a poster of Johnny Jihad Walker in your bedroom? The day that man/boydog step's out of jail I really do hope some person end's his life with a rifle round to the head....<br>
<br>
Don't forget hippie many lives have been lost to give you your freedom of speech, and many other freedom's.....you have the right to vote which means the right to change what you don't like and like Eddie Murphy said "If you don't like you can get the fuck out!" please by all means feel free to leave...<br>
<br>
I will end this post by saying thank you to all the men and women who have died giving me my freedom's and who are also currently serving this great nation that I live in, happy 4 of July to you all..........<br>
