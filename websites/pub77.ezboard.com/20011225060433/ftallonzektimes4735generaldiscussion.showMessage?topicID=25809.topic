<br>
I know.  Poor Elven Empire.  What is left of them now?  Who is the leader now?<br>
<br>
I know what happened in great detail.  I won't go into on Tallon Zek, however it is most unfortunate.  Domino effects suck.  <br>
<br>
However there is no need to lose faith.  Faith is always there you just need to try and keep hope alive.  When your guild started to lose members, that would have been a good time to change playstyles.  It would have been a good time to lay down the law, and tell everyone in the guild &quot;this is how it is going to be&quot;.  That would have brought life and excitement back into the guild.  It would have drawn in more members.<br>
<br>
But...  we both know that wouldn't have happened because all the higher levels in EE left because they were having trouble getting their epics.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :rolleyes --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/eyes.gif ALT=":rolleyes"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   Greed and Blueness killed the guild in the end.  Perhaps it will rise again like the Phoenix from the ashes.  That all depends on who is at the helm, of course.  <br>
<br>
It's never too late. <p><CENTER>

Oh, in response to your comments, yes I realize I need to update/get a new signature.  It is old as hell, but I don't know what I should put in it.  As soon as I think of something creative and inspiring I'll update it.  Until then you'll just have to look at something that dates back to the age of dinosaurs. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p><CENTER>

But here is my version of events.   <br>
<br>
&quot;in War, Truth is always the first Casulaty&quot;<br>
<br>
Well it in my opinion it started serveral months ago, slightly after the xp-pk episode argument we had with LotU.   Ravvi and Shaod had been at each others throats for a while, both making false and misleading accusations about the other.   As always Elephant did his best to smooth things out, but Ravvi and Shaod both refused to play nice, I can not be certain who's fault it was, but as always, nothing is clear or certain.<br>
<br>
Finally it got to the stage where I'd had enough, either Shaod or Ravvi had to leave the guild so the fighting would subside or be solved in a short mater of time, even at this point their fight was starting to effect the mood and moral of the guild, Minadien was spending more time playing alts then leading the guild, because he too had become sick of the @#%$.  Well, as you already know, Ravvi is my IRL girlfriend and it was upsetting to me to see her so unhappy playing a game which was meant to be fun, I had told her to leave the guild serveral times beforehand, if she was unhappy, but she didn't want to leave, because she thought I would be upset at her, and the guild would never forgive her, I told her that she would be ok, because hay this was a game and no one should get upset about a decision made in a game right?  so I made the decision that she should leave the guild, for her own sanity and mine.<br>
<br>
  So i sent a tell to a officer of Knights of the White Rose, asked them if they wanted Ravvi and Myself to join, told them it was a snap decision and they had no option but to accept it, if they wanted a level 54 (I think she was at the time) mage and level 51 cleric.   My intention was to switch guilds wait until Ravvi was happy then leave returning to my former position in EE, at the time Ravvi had a lot of friends in Knights so there was a reasonible chance that she would fit in well.   I said my goodbyes to the guild informing them that i would be back, and left, I spent about 2-3days in Knights, I wanted to wait long enough for Ravvi to settle down in Knights, before returning to EE, since she didn't want to be in a guild without me, *shrugs* I don't understand it either, I gave up trying to figure her out a long time ago.   Anyway on with the story.    Ravvi and I left, so a few others left with us, to me this was a unforseen event, No one should stay in a guild where they are unhappy just because someone else is in that guild they happen to like/respect, but apparently Ravvi had some friends who left with her <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> .   So EE lost a cleric/mage/ench no biggy, well I didn't think so, I soon returned to EE, and settled down to things again, the guild at this point was starting to mature a lot, unfornuately its members couldn't handle the change, Minadien tired his best to control the suitation and get everyone active, but the infighting had left everyone lack luster and not interested in helping the guild, then finally Seninea left the guild again, we were used to this since she had come and gone, but it still upset a few people includeing myself, Seninea's reasons for leaving the guild were pretty simple, she was sick of the infighting as much as everyone else was, exect she had the Guts to let everyone know <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  *good on ya Seninea* <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> , I cannot remember if Seninea left before or after the chardock incident where Shaod refused to be grouped in a group where a druid was the main healer, I was not on the raid so my account is second hand, anyway, Shaod was removed from the guild for it.  Then it happened, suddenly the entire guild seemed diffrent as if someone had opened a door to a musty old house and let in the fresh air, people started to have fun again, but the old school, push Minadien hard to bring back shaod and so he did.. the guild quickly fall back into its old ways, and the infighting continued, it all came to a head one night when elephant logged on and started accusing Minadien of applying to stature of the Gods, and a whole lot of other guilds, Minadien, said F it, I'm sick of it, handed the leadership commands to Anzac and left the guild, Elephant left the guild in protest of my getting the leadership, I am not sure why Elephant hates me exactally, but he's been a complete wanker to me for a while now, I wish he would tell me what i was meant to have done wrong.  anyway, I was now leader of the Guild once again, I rounded everyone up and tried to change the guild, introduced new rules of engagement, and told everyone that the guild was going to reorganise, I attempted to bring some life back into the guild, my rules were simple, <br>
<br>
1. No member will fight with any others in guildchat.<br>
2. All Officers have to spend time in newbie areas helping newbies, and genereally protecting the elven race from evil.<br>
3. The ruiles of engagement have changed, EE members now do not need premission to engage in combat with anyone deemed to be hostile to Elve's in General.<br>
4. No Elven Empire member will walk away from another Elf in combat even if that Elf is considered an affront to the Elven Race *he is still a brother/sister and we will not abandon them, instead working in hope to show them the light <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> *<br>
5. Leaveing the guild is not a crime, forgive anyone who leaves the guild, and don't hold grudges against them, they have their reasons.<br>
6. If you don't like the new rules, leave now.<br>
<br>
Well I tried, for 1 night i was leader, the guild officers followed the mandate, I created a few more officers as well of those who I believe deserved the positions, I have simple rules for officers as well, and said, no officer is above the others, only Anzac and Tunare can be considered God.  Officers will not controdict each other, if Disagreement ensue's you will e-mail Anzac about it, or talk to Anzac if he is online, Officers have to make their own decisions, and should never be afraid to exercise their athority, but they must also take responbiility for their actions, in other words, if they are going to remove someone, they should have a good reason for it, I believe that officers make mistakes and give them more then just one chance, if they start openly abuseing their athoruty, they will be removed from the guild.  Well we had a slight up serge in membership that night, Min returned to the guild, and we started a small rebuilding program.   Anyway, I logged in the next morning to see how things were going, and Shaod was online, he gave me 2 options, He would either destory the guild by taking all his friends from it and leave it himself, or i could hand over leadership to Elephant, because Shaod would never accept me as a leader, that was it for me, I went to velks where shaod was leveling, handed over leadership to him and then left the guild.    I was not going to stay in a guild where the senor members were intent of undermineing each other.   <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :( --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/frown.gif ALT=":("><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->    after I left I am not sure what happened, I know my IRL friends left the guild as well, and I believe it slowly collapsed from that point.   There were serveral reasons the guild ended up dieing,  but the main reason was the top members of the guild includeing myself, forgot how to have fun, and started setting our sights on bigger and better things, at our hight EE had 16members level 50+, and about 10 who were comming into the 40+ range. It was a good guild which went longer then anyone ever dreamed it would, a lot of skilled leaders, Elephant, Talathin, Minadien, all helped build the guild to its greatness.<br>
<br>
Oh I believe *from what I've read on the EE messageboards* that a few EE members stopped playing the game, because of my Personal opinion about the American government, I also am guessing that my opinion's have something to do with Elephant's dislike of me, understandible..<br>

I think that she was told by some of EE's former members that the reason the guild died was because we all wanted uber lootage which only the uber guilds could offer us.  I do not think she came to that conclusion on her own.<br>

First off a trained monkey may be able to play a necro, but it takes a person with great skill to play one well.  Way over half the Necromancers on Tallon Zek suck, don't know their full abilities (trust me Necros have allot), and that is why they complain about not being able to find a group.  Necromancers are similar to bards in the way that they are the jack of all trades, but only a master of a few.  There is much more to a Necromancer than DoTing, sending in pet, Fearing or Mana Pumping the Cleric.  <br>
<br>
Secondly I can't find where I read the thing about the EE and their Epics, but I can almost SWEAR that I read it some where.  *sigh*  As for the greed part EE was having problem with members not wanting to help other members.  For example, you Lzoril had a hard time getting members to assist you in SK finding Quil, even though there were people on around your level with tracking.  They were too busy gaining exp to come assist you. Perhaps I confused that with the epic thing...  *shrug*<br>
<br>
Anyway.  I'm going to miss EE.  I wish things could have worked out better than they did. <p><CENTER>
