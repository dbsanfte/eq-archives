Maybe I learned my lesson with wasting my life away trying to level in eq.  <br>
<br>
With DAoc it seems that I can play a few hours a week and still keep within the levels of my friends.  We all know post 50 in EQ is just unbearable, nothing could ever be that bad.<br>
<br>
Mythic is doing a good job at addressing issues.  At least the game runs.  I remember when EQ first came out there were alot of server problems.  Verant had alot of time to change the game since it took 3 months to hit level 30 in the beginning <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  (just kidding).<br>

If your computer can't handle the game, that is a personal problem.  If you like EQ better, that's all well and good, but to deny that you were talking shit is just part of the ignorance and bullshit I mentioned above.<br>

Malastan, learn to read... I said I doubt that one factor would make the game any more appealing to me. And processor speed isn't the main factor in lag so I don't think upgrading it is going to make a huge difference. I have 512MB of ram and a Geforce 2 card.. I updated my ram recently and helped alot with graphic lag. I run EQ fine and can usually do 50 person raids with spell effects on now and it's not too bad. DAoC I can't even move in an empty area without it being choppy. You want to say I'm talking shit?

<br>
It's not as bad as WWII Online or AO. <br>
<br>
The difference is that when people used to say 'I quit' while posting on the VI boards they didn't have very good alternatives.<br>
<br>
People not liking DAoC can drop it and go back to whatever they were playing before and not think twice about it. There are more choices (especially refined choices) then there was a couple of years ago.<br>
<br>
Several DAoC fans have pointed to the graphics being superior. It won't be that way for more than the next two weeks. At that point I believe EQ's graphics will be much closer, if not equal.<br>
<br>
Whatever...I think this is a sign to developers that if you're going to release a game it better be ready. I don't mean 18 months of post-release ready. I mean ready. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#00000F><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub77.ezboard.com/ukrowepdm.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Krowe PDM</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 431<br> <font color=#FFFF00>(11/20/01 4:22:59 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: .</span><hr size=1> Wasn't Aldebian the troll who used to post &quot;You're all real life welfare-leeching losers for playing EQ&quot; on every single thread?

<br>
My computer (1ghz, 128 ram, GeForce DDR) runs DAoC just fine, during 50 man EQ raids it was decent, I wouldn't lag out too badly, so choppyness is either due to lag in that particular area or a driver that needs updating.<br>
<br>
&quot;Whatever...I think this is a sign to developers that if you're going to release a game it better be ready. I don't mean 18 months of post-release ready. I mean ready.&quot;<br>
<br>
DAoC is far more ready than people expected it to be, the release has been pretty damn smooth compared to AC, AO, and yes, EQ. The high end PvE is already being worked on and has been implemented in some cases, but you can't work fast enough for powergamers who get 45+ in the first few weeks alone. People jumping ship because they're fighting hundreds of people and not Vulak Aerr for the endgame can go back to EQ, because that's the game for them. I'll probably play EQ a bit when SoL comes out, but in no way am I ever going to leave DAoC. PvE mobs can always be upgraded, graphics and gameplay cannot. <p>Krowe <br>

&quot;DAoC is springing leaks like crazy. People really are quitting. I know because a few of my friends tried it and they're back in EQ.&quot;<br>

Really? Is that why server populations are up? Is that why EQ took their server populations offline?<br>

If you prefer the gameplay of EQ then thats your thing. The point all the DaoC players are trying to make is this:<br>
<br>
We cant understand why you would bother...<br>
<br>
We have listed our reasons... we have tried to show you as fellow gamers why DaoC might better suit your playtime but so many of you are like mindless drones that chime in as if struck like a bell with:<br>
<br>
&quot;EQ &gt; *... convincing us otherwise is futile&quot;<br>
<br>
I think SoL will recharge things for a bit but not for the PvP servers... for those of you who do play on TZ why are you here? For the uber mobs and loot? If thats the case your blue by the very definition that was set forth eons ago with EQ players. Blue = PvE... red = PvP... TZ is supposed to be about the PvP so if you sit here and claim to be true to the server but wont give DaoC a fair shot then yes... your blue any way you slice it. <br>
<br>
DaoC was DESIGNED for Tallon Zek... the entire game was built for every one of you that have proded Verant to actually pay attention to their PvP playerbase... and yet so many wont even try it.<br>
<br>
But in summation... if your happy playing the role of the &quot;bastard redheaded stepchild&quot; of verant... who am I to stop you. <p><CENTER><a href = http://pub96.ezboard.com/bbravohmansboard>Bravoh Man's Board</a><br><img src="http://www.jbravoh.com/images/ferekar.jpg"><br></center>

<br>
And here's a tip for you: People are entitled to their opinions so stop making yourself look like an asshole by ranting and raving at me about mine.<br>
<br>
1) The game doesn't run well on my system, but it runs EQ fine<br>
<br>
Are you going to debate that with me?<br>
<br>
2) I don't like the game<br>
<br>
Are you going to debate that with me?<br>
<br>
3) I said I don't think upgrading will make a huge difference<br>
<br>
Educated opinion, not talking shit. Maybe you think talking shit is what people do when they say something you don't like? That might explain why you misuse the term.<br>
<br>
4) Even if I upgraded, I don't think I'd like DaoC<br>
<br>
I was in beta, and played it, and wasn't impressed. Are you going to tell me what I think?<br>

I happen to enjoy EQ's PvP system, and spent most of my time online doing it.  I never have trouble finding a good fight, whether its PKing in OT, defending North Wall or KC from darks, or fighting darks in Ro.  The only times I don't encounter PvP in an evening is when I decide to do a raid or group for exp.  I'm happy with solo/small group PvP as opposed to 2 hour waits for 100 on 100 battles that last 5 minutes, so the fact that I'm playing EQ instead of DAoC doesn't make me blue.  Its all a matter of preference. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#00000F><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub77.ezboard.com/ufujigato.showPublicProfile?language=EN>FujiGato</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 27<br> <font color=#FFFF00>(11/20/01 6:20:08 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: .</span><hr size=1> &quot;DaoC was DESIGNED for Tallon Zek... the entire game was built for every one of you that have proded Verant to actually pay attention to their PvP playerbase... and yet so many wont even try it.&quot;<br>
<br>
Yeah, the funnest times I've had in DAoC have been protecting Nisse's Lair from the hordes of Hibernian and Albion . ..er ... oh yeah that's right, you're safe in your own realm. <br>
<br>
DAoC is an EQ blue server with rewards for fighting in the Arena. That's the reality of it.<br>
<br>
SoL is going to ruin the PvP servers which is a shame. Take a look at the skill lists--Clerics and Chanters get nothing to help them PvP wise where many of the other classes get passive skills that will pwn in PvP. Oh yeah, one-shot 2000 point pvp wizard lures are gonna be nice. Druids are now the best pet class as well. SoL is proof that VI has no clue what PvP is about. At least people will get screen grabs of my corpse with better geometry.<br>
<br>
There are 4 servers with PvP rules, which amounts to about 10 - 15% of the user base. Can you imagine the stink if VI came out and said 'We really don't think wizards and bards represent the Vision of EQ and as such, all issues relating to that 10% of our user base will be relegated to the back burner in lieu of making the Druid experience more fun'.<br>
<br>
VI is clueless. When DAoC finally gets a clue and adds content (aka more than 4-5 dungeons per realm) so that 50 people don't need to be jamming Nisse's Lair, they might draw me away from EQ. But Shadowbane seems a better bet for what TZ should have been. I'm not optimistic SoL will do anything other than continue to reward the loot whores in PvP. <p>Chantro

<br>
I played Daoc for 20 days, got a Midgard Hunter to level 27 and got bored. Didn't even enter credit card information. <br>
<br>
Im going to summ my Daoc life for those 20 daysand going to point what I think what were the ups and the downs of the game ( So don't flame me cause this isn't a flame either about Daoc or EQ, it's just what I think).<br>
<br>
Daoc has brought some nice graphics, but still lacks in the 1st person view IMO. I just couldn't play 1st view, but at least 3rd view doesn't suck like in EQ. <br>
<br>
Daoc hasn't brought big variety of mobs, you have baby spider, kid spider, adolescent spider, mid age spider, grown spider, and so on, and it goes the same with some mobs, like wolves, werewolves, and etc.<br>
<br>
Daoc doesn't have a big number of places to hunt.<br>
<br>
Horses are a PoS, they are just taxi's cause u don't control them you just buy the ticket to the place and give it to horse and it takes you there.<br>
<br>
Trade skills:<br>
<br>
We'll when I got bit bored of getting levels, I decided that as a hunter I would get Fletching up to lower the prices of making arrows and making some profit selling stuff to other players. Hm let me se, WOW, now making my own arrows I spend 15% less than buying them from a merchant and I have to freaking go to Jordhein or Gna Faste to make them because I need a lathe to faction, and Im always encumbered cause Im carrying fucking heavy wood boards and metal bars to faction the arrows and the arrows themselves, not letting me loot shit cause if I loot I won't be able to move.<br>
Well there is still the part of selling bows to players, hmm EVERY HUNTER HAS FLETCHING, and those who would buy them are high levels who need bows made with 750 skill or so. Ok then lets get skill up to make UBBER bows. at 550 you need to bring leatherworking up....(honestly I gave up at that point. after getting woodworking, metalwirking, clothworking and loosing insane amounts of cash I decided I didn't want to waist one more full day to bring another secondary skill up to loose some more insane amount of cash trying to get Fleching up.<br>
<br>
Auto loot: IT COMPLETELLY SUCKS. Hunters use spears, im in Vendo, ubber spear drops, ubber spear goes to stupid healer, I tell the guy can I have the spear as im the only hunter here? he says, no, auto-loot man, im saving it for my twink ill make someday...<br>
<br>
PvP: Here comes the fun part. As people know you are safe from PvPer's in your realm but in the frontiers. You start hunting in the frontier, then a nice bowman shows up, boom, shot's your ass with an arrow for 500 dmg, as you have 350 HP your down in 1 shot. You release or get a rez (if rezzed sit your ass for 5 minutes or so to wait for rez effects to wear off, that if the same bowman don't kill you again). Ok I thought in not that high level, must be it. Decided to get a few more levels, so then we go again to the boring XP camp again (It doesn't change, either in EQ or in Daoc it's all the same). We decide to go to another realm to PK, ok port to Hibernia, 20 people, When we get there walk for around 15 minutes, get to some kind of fort where 6 Hibernians are waiting there, 3 bowmans take 80% of the people in 2 or 3 shots. 1 hour gone down the toilet. <br>
Ok lets go PK in Albion then, get to albion, walk for 40 minutes, don;t get anywhere, ubber mobs rape everyone, we die, loose XP, unable to rez and PK we release and go back to XP (WOOT).<br>
<br>
You are getting XP in a group, start to get pbeaten up by the mob, (HEAL HEAL), when you die cleric says, sorry was mezzing/rooting/Doting/giving clarity to people. Mythic has to understand that 1 person that has ability to do 1000 diferent things might get lost. why not make enchanter and healers as a diferent class?<br>
<br>
IMO, Mythic got everything people in EQ most hate and changed it, for example downtime. But these changes themselves wont hold the game if they don't bring something really new to the comunity. Why? Simple, because Verant is 2 years ahead of them.<br>
<br>
Summing it up:<br>
<br>
Load times: <br>
DAoc: really good and fast zoning<br>
EQ: well if you got a pentium 4 1.7 GHZ with 512 RAM isn't much of a problem, But when I log on my brother's computer it can take me up to 15 minutes to load on a velious zone (P2, 300 MHZ, 128 RAM).<br>
<br>
Mobs:<br>
DAoc: Didn't bring anything new.<br>
EQ: Has more options as for being running for a long time and having it's 3rd release coming up.<br>
<br>
XP:<br>
DAoc: Is fast, till lvl 25 or so, after that starts to get slow.<br>
EQ: Is fast if you concentrate on it. People love to say leveling on EQ sucks, but people can't sit their asses for more than 1 hour in the same spot. ( Im not saying that leveling in EQ is easy, but people complain not having a real reason to fo it. If people want it is possible to get a level per week post level 50).<br>
Anyways, leveling wasn't meant to be fast, or you guys really think EQ would be stilllkicking if people were able to get lvl 60 in 2 months?<br>
<br>
Epic:<br>
DAoc: they brought a good idea, every five levels you do a quest to further advance in your epic, and as a reward you get an item, at level 15 or so I got some nice gloves, but there is a problem, there are &quot;level's&quot; on armor, so it means I got the gloves at level 15 at 27 they are way gray to me, and fighting that means that if a mob that usually hits me for 50 damage, if they hit my hand they can do up to 200 dmg in one hit.<br>
EQ: Not much to to say about this, EQ has always sucked in quests, but they got a lot better with Velious.<br>
<br>
Graphics: <br>
DAoc: They are really good<br>
EQ: They aint bad considering the game was released 2 years ago, and with Luclin all graphics will be revamped.<br>
<br>
Horses:<br>
DAoc: THey work only as taxis, so get your ticket, give it to the horse, and go afk while the horse takes you to your destination.<br>
EQ: Well, can't say anything about this as Luclin hasn't been released, but fromt he screenshots and the options to buy diferent kind of horses, and baing able to actually control them is gonna rock, who cares if they going to cost from 5kpp to 50kpp. Get cash and buy one if you want.<br>
<br>
Gameplay:<br>
Daoc: sucks, sucks and sucks<br>
EQ: very intuitive and don't take 2 neuroniums (sp?) to be able to do the basics.<br>
<br>
Can't rember of anything else. But it pretty sums up what I think and the impresions I got on DAoc. Honeslty I don't think Mythic will go down the toilet, the game is promissing, but needs a lot of changes, and so far if you are way too more used with EQ you wont enjoy Daoc, we all know EQ is always getting more headed to ubbber fights with mobs, and I don't see that happening on Daoc cause the gameplay sucks, and considering for how much mobs hit and how much your HP goes up, if we were to compare EQ and DAco, Vindicator would hit for 5k dmg, while you would have max 4k HP.<br>

But I believe DAoC has a ton of potential and if they are able to update and add content to the game such as RVR high content zones. Not zones that are very large but zones that are small and great to fight over.  <br>
<br>
The two things that I think are the best about DAoC are as follows. <br>
<br>
1. DAoC has nowhere near as much downtime as EQ.<br>
2. Not all classes are the same. In EQ this lvl 40 ranger is the same as most other lvl 40 rangers. In DAoC your character can be customized. Casters concentrate on different things and specialize if different areas. This lvl 15 shaman can be a totally different character than the one standing next to him.<br>
<br>
At least that is how I understand it. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub77.ezboard.com/umomof6plus.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Momof6plus</A> at: 11/20/01 8:40:44 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#00000F><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub77.ezboard.com/uthirskblazinleaf.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Thirsk Blazinleaf</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_greenspot.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Can we smoke now?</span><br>  Posts: 53<br> <font color=#FFFF00>(11/20/01 9:48:09 pm)</font><br>    <BR><img src=http://members.home.net/bosco11/pictures/thirsk2a.jpg width=100 height=186></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: .</span><hr size=1> erondiel--very nice info for people that have no idea what DAoC is like compared to EQ.<br>

for the rest of the conversations going on in this post...<br>
<br>
The point where someone said &quot;some people like EQ, some people like DAoC,&quot; everyone should have replied--<br>
<br>
&quot;Oh.  That's true.  My bad.&quot;<br>
