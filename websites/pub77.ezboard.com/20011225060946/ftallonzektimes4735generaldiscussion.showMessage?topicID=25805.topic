It's strange, however, that people think PDM just grabs everyone they can, decks em out in "phat lewt" and then does so for their twinks etc...  that's bullshit, it doesn't happen like that.<br>
<br>
Along the lines of Stature:<br>
<br>
You only earn items if you stay in the guild for your entire EQ career, the second you disband from the guild you are a loot whoring lamer who didn't deserve the items and never helped out the guild.  So much trash is said about the people who quit the guild... it's ridiculous.<br>
<br>
I disagree with a number of things that the leaders/officers in Stature think... which is a large part of my leaving.  I had a disagreement with a member of authority and was told to disband from the guild and return the items I had been rewarded, this was the first thing they said too, they did not ask why I had a different opinion and why I was acting on it.  They simply didn't care about me, a member of the guild, all they cared about was that they got the loot back.  Sort of struck me as greedy, and a poor attempt at controlling another person through the usage of items received.<br>
<br>
About Darkoan:<br>
<br>
I hold a lot of respect for Darkoan, he contributes to Stature probably more so than any other person who is currently or has ever been in the guild.  He's a fine leader and usually gets their collective tasks done without much confusion.  It was very... very rare in which he received loot, and I attended the majority of raids that took place when I was a member of stature.  I think people are too quick to judge him based on rumors and message board flak.  Until you are either a member of Stature, or have interracted with Darkoan on a personal basis, then you have no right to judge him in such a derogatory manner.  This is only my personal belief though...<br>

Redfalkon, don't be a moron. Fungi groups are done by one exp group, of course we're not going to have the loot council decide if we're just exping. You won't see people rolling for gear in any other situation. Hinadurus got his fungi because everyone else already had one.

I'm not on a crusade.  I have about 11 posts since i rolled up Pokra about a year ago, hardly crusade-worthy.  You on the other hand have about 3000 angry bitter posts, and that number is steadily rising as you "go Rambo" on my latest opinion, merely because its contrary to your own.<br>

If you don't like the fact there's someone out there who thinks your posts are angry, bitter, and offensive, my advice is to examine your posts with a little objectivity for a change.  You're a grief poster.  If you don't like my saying so, then change my opinion by changing the nature of your posts.

Show me where I was bitter, angry, and unjustified in the way I handled myself. Show me where I did anything more than give my opinion. If I come off as angry and bitter you should look at the people I'm responding to before you jump to irrational conclusions.<br>

Oh no, my EQ guild suffered because I took time to get my life together... I went from a coffee shop to one of the top banks in the country, met a beautiful woman and improved relations with my friends and family... My guild merged with my favorite other light guild and filled the leadership gap where I could not provide it, and now all my friends are having a great time... boy you're right.<br>

It's better than being the bitter egomaniac you've turned out to be, whose attempts at insulting me ("You tarnished the reputation of halfling druids so no one ever wanted to make another one!") not only make absolutely zero sense whatsoever, but are about as funny as your doctor telling you you have a terminal disease.

Who's oneshotted you? Here's a hint: Aggro'd green enchanter pet+Winged Death=400 or so less plat in the bank account. Sure it happened a while ago, too bad it's the last time I actually saw you in game. Here's a suggestion: Seeing as how you f*cked up your last two guilds, specifically in the areas of quality control and pvp, it'd be wise to sit down and let the competent guildmates do the talking. At least they're around to back it up in game.<br>

Your flaming technique is predictable, and your personality is transparent. Bitter egomaniac? What exactly am I egotistical about?

Obvious lies like this are exactly why I wrote those "essays" on my opinion of the ToT. Don't accuse me of saying things I never said and expect to sound like anything but a chump grasping for straws. If I could find the thread where I commented on the ToT I would, however it seems to be lost in the sea of SoL posts.<br>

"I am surprised DO's team managed to drop 4 from PDM's best team, considering DO's team did not prepare for the event that much. My guess is that PDM won't go all the way against the cream of the crop of blue servers (i.e., Afterlife), since they've got the gear and they will be coming prepared for the tournament. If I'm proven wrong I will be happy, but I'm calling it like I see it".<br>

I spent like 10 posts trying to explain to the morons who couldn't understand the meaning of an "objective opinion" and dealing with immature insults that had nothing to do with what I said. In the end, my prediction was correct.<br>

Yeah, I got alot of tells from quality CB members like Maxem and Gattil out of nowhere, telling me how I was a joke to them and never pked any of them solo (Especially since the same trashtalkers would run off to gate the second I hit them). By the time I retired Krowe none of them had yet to even kill me, while on the flip side things were a little different for <a href=http://loc_sinkaro@members.fuzzybunnies.org/pandemonium/Everquest.htm> them</a>. You represent old CB's bitterness perfectly.<br>

Let's see, anything that a CB member posts or does is immediately justified by you (Saying you could see where Tyrannos's terrorist comparison was coming from not two weeks after Sept. 11 was tops for you, just tops), and you tend to rewrite history. Anytime someone makes you look like a jackass, you either /yawn and ignore them or ban them from your board ^_^ Not once have I even seen you admit to CB being at fault, and of all the guilds we've ever fought, AotL/CB is at the top of the list for gimpness. You're always right, for you're the most mature and reasonable person on the planet, and you make it known by hanging out with people of the same calibur. Hell, that "I am unlike the intellectually-challenged" quip you just made speaks for itself. Does Xcelon bathe your feet with oil?<br>

<br>
You didn't say something along the lines of "well the DO team didn't have Vulak gear" after we had only killed him once and had two pieces on the ToT team? Because alot of laughing people could say otherwise. No one was laughing at you because of those other comments or predictions, the Vulak one just came off as an extremely sore and bitter comment.<br>

Rewriting history, are we? It was me + one green enchanter pet (Mages can't root :(  ) while the others were up on the hill fighting the rest, I winged you while you tried to run away and you died in the water with no one but me and the pet around. I rejoined the others and killed Kilyena and Quifallian after that. Maybe you'd like to tell me just which melees those were on you. You know, to "save face." <br>

<br>
<br>
"Ran" is a relative term, considering in all the pvp fights I've been in with CB/DO, I've only seen you once, when I killed you. I think "Figurehead" is a more appropriate title. I could gather up 10 newbies in gfay and make a guild, does that make me as r337 as you? Do you even know how to run a raid or what strategies to use or are you one of the people who just sits in the corner after hitting the /pet attack hotkey and nuking a few times? Judging from who I see leading DO's raids, it's the latter. I always had a mouth, with or without PDM, it just got directed at your guild for being the biggest gimps in game. Calling me a Crushbone terror? Haha, weak, should I call you the Bane of Blackburrow for leveling there? Probably not, at least I pked my way up to 50+.<br>
<br>
<i> I play 4 nights a week. Where have you been? I'm not anon. Pay me a visit sometime, you'll know where to find me. </i><br>
<br>
If you expect me to see you as some sort of pvp threat, excuse me while I laugh. Practically all of my non-raiding time is spent on pvp, in all the busy zones (GD/Velks/DL, even Gfay), I'm pretty damn familiar with who pks often and who just logs on to exp. Even Maxem and Tyrannos show up to fight often, but you are absolutely nowhere to be seen. We can both talk trash till the end of time, at least I've backed it up in game. <p>Krowe <br>

<br>
I'm bitter because you PKed me or my guild... if you think I am really that petty you are a retard, plain and simple.<br>
<br>
<i>Let's see, anything that a CB member posts or does is immediately justified by you (Saying you could see where Tyrannos's terrorist comparison was coming from not two weeks after Sept. 11 was tops for you, just tops), and you tend to rewrite history.</i><br>
---<br>
<br>
I didn't justify it, but I said I saw a resemblance in the comparison (bullying and being lame to the innocent to make up for the crimes of a few). It's called an opinion. If you don't like it, that's fine, but every time you bring this up you say I thought it was totally cool for Tyrannos to say that. I even said I don't think it's cool to draw a relation like that especially at that time, but you can burn me at the cross for having a mind of my own.<br>
<br>
You can't look at things objectively. It's either black and white, and it's an immature and foolish way of dealing with things. I'm used to it by now, maybe you'll grow up eventually but I don't see it happening anytime soon. You could be an intelligent guy IRL but you sure aren't wise.<br>
<br>
<i>Anytime someone makes you look like a jackass, you either /yawn and ignore them or ban them from your board ^_^</i><br>
---<br>
<br>
Actually, whenever someone made themselves look like a jackass, I banned them from our board. There's a difference. Kandiar, you, and perhaps a couple other people who didn't know how to chill out and make a point without resorting to name calling or being extremely rude were the only ones banned. The majority of PDM still had access and I had no problem with them disagree or having an arguement as long as they didn't come off as a total bitter fool like you did.<br>
<br>

---<br>
<br>
I've never claimed we never made mistakes and that my guild was perfect. I could list off people who I booted from CB for being lame, and times where I spoke to guild members about conduct. I can name times that we fought and I spent time talking to PDM members about conduct, and both sides agreeing both sides are to blame for it. Does it really matter though? No, because of course you are going to think what you want to think. If your mind was going to change about me it would have already happened. I really don't care, I just like picturing you breaking a sweat trying to flame me.<br>
<br>
I could ask you the same question... how many times did you do something about what your guild was doing? Someone cries on guildchat saying CB_member_001 is doing whatever to them and you automatically are going to XP kill the next 10 CB you see. Eye for an eye! You rarely had proof and rarely had your story straight. You sure talked a lot though. You are a grief player with no class and always have been and your attitude has always been immature. As I have always maintained, I'm glad you couldn't lead a guild out of a paper bag, because you get so worked up over little things I dread what would have happened if you were anything more than a mouthpiece for PDM.<br>
<br>

---<br>
<br>
"Alot of laughing people" are ignorant fools. I never claimed anything even remotely close to that. The two pieces of Vulak gear PDM had was what allowed them to win against DO's team? What am I, level 5 with 4 hours played? <br>
<br>
Might want to check your Dossier, you will never find a quote from me along those lines. My comment about Vulak gear had to do with the fact that blue servers have farmed him and PDM only got him once, hence the gear advantage that will likely been seen in the ToT.<br>
<br>
You must feel pretty cool for making a big deal out of something I never said. Propoganda machine in full force!<br>

---<br>
<br>
Yeah, I wasn't sure if it was a melee on me or just the pet that I was remembering... cut me some slack, it happened over a year ago. One thing we have already established, however, is that you didn't one shot me. Pick on something else please, your lie has been proven.<br>

Ok, now you're just shooting blanks. Not even amusing, just plain sad. No you're right, I never organized anything, can't do it now, and I just suck. I have no ability to lead. Mmkay? Good, next....<br>
