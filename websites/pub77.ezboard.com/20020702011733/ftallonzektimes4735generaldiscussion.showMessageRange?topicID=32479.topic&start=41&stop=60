It has alot to do with the air more so then the actual physics of gravity, but since im taking stats, not physics, I shouldn't be the one to explain.<br>
<br>
The difference between the theories in physics and the theories in biology is that they use math to prove a physical theory. That doesn't necessarily make it law of course, but they know many things about the universe based solely on mathimatics. <br>

Also, learn to read.<br>
<br>
I said religion CAUSED 6 MILLION DEATHS! WW2 took way over 6 million, the jewish people being executed was 6 million. NO where did i say it started WW2, which was the cause of the deaths. The cause of WW2 was WW1, and the treaty which basically screwed Germany over. Germany felt feelings of dissent, and after hitler won power, he wanted to take beck germanies empire, knowing the democracies would do nothing. When he invaded poland, the allies declared war.<br>
<br>
Also, onto gravity. Gravity itself is a theory, read my explination, if its not true in all occasions, its not a law. The law of gravity is the pull, which is expressed in a formula of m/s/s acceleration. Also, yes, gravity is taught in science class. Most of science is a mathematical formula, but it is still science. I didn't have my math teacher explain gravity, they explained algerbra. My science teacher explained natural selection, gravity, astrology, combination of elements, etc.<br>
<br>
Yes, religions accept gravity, but again i was using it as an example of how science is based on theories, as is religion, but religious theories don't exactly change.<br>
<br>
And about the downward spiral? Religion has always been around. It was huge during the industrial revolution, that is what stemmed the commercialism, and narcassim? That's really nothing new, bro. Religion has always been around during these things, but religion was flawed. Wonder why religions failed? Because people were corrupted by power. Religion is as flawed as Commercialism. And think of this, you can always repent in religion. So, what keeps you from doing bad things, then repenting, then doing more? That could cause the downfall too, there is no real punishment for sinning.<br>

I believe that you shouldn't force religion on your children.  Period.  &quot;Forcing&quot; can be simply teaching your child a religion like Christianity without telling him or her that that religion has not been proven.  That is forcing.  Why you ask?  Because children are retards.  Seriously.  Children become as smart as the parents make them, and are so very impressionable.  They will believe literally ANYTHING you tell them.  Closing their minds with a religion (especially one like Christianity, which uses fear tactics to persuade their followers/followers to be) is not only &quot;forcing&quot; it on them, but is in my opinion morally wrong.<br>

I'm not sure which church you went to Tulli, but in the two different demonations i have been, the children are happy to be learning something about God that is positive.<br>

I'm sure Jesus' message of peace and love are very scary for you. You'd probably prefer sitting your children in front of the TV, on a Sunday morning.<br>

Adults force things on their children, because simply-they know better than their children. They've been down the road of life, and have a higher understanding. Following spirituality is hardly, &quot;closing a mind&quot;. If anything, i believe its the road to enlightment and understanding. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000028><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub77.ezboard.com/utulli.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Tulli</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/anim_1.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>hated globally</span><br>  Posts: 1444<br> <font color=#FFFF00>(6/21/02 3:55:04 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub77.ezboard.com/ftallonzektimes4735generaldiscussion.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=32479.topic&index=46>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Teaching children Christianity</span><hr size=1> Xuan, how many people would honestly believe in Christianity if it didn't offer a:<br>
<br>
heaven - This was a miracle in the eyes of the pesants in the time when Christianity first emerged due to the fact that you lived your entire life working for someone else, everything you reaped was taken excepting that which was needed to keep you and your family alive so you could produce more food ad infinum untill you died.  Allowing these common people to think they would become one foot under angels who were in turn one foot under the archangel (Micheal) who was in turn one foot under &quot;Christ&quot; who was in turn one foot under the most powerful being in the entire Universe was like a dream come true.<br>
<br>
and a:<br>
<br>
hell: Making people who would attempt to stray from Christianity rethink their decision based on the fact that they are going to this horrible horrible place.<br>
<br>
Of course they aren't in fear Xuan, they have accepted the only rational choice that has been given to them for what would happen after they died (the other being hell).<br>
<br>
The Church I go to, focuses mainly on trying to convert &quot;unbelievers&quot;, telling us every week that if you don't accept Jesus, you're going to hell.  And face it, THAT is one of the KEY messages the Bible preaches.  You can be the best person in the world, but if God really exists, and you don't believe in believe in him, your ass is going straight to hell.  If you don't believe me, look somewhere in Matthew, where Jesus tells that one guy (can't remember his name for the life of me) that &quot;Surely X, if you don't accept me you will go to hell&quot; not once but TWICE.  And then tells people that in order to go to heaven without accepting Christ that you must be greater than even the pharaseeis (go spelling) who went to Church every day, wouldn't eat with anyone but other pharaseeis, and gave tax on even their mint.<br>
<br>
Jesus' messages are shit in my opinion.  Seriously.  They are good in themselves, but the fact that his messages are with the rest of the Bible makes them pure shit.<br>
<br>
Adults force things on their children because they KNOW what will happen.  You don't KNOW a GOD (pun not intended! hehe) damn thing Xuan.  You just read a book which has been written and rewritten many many times, and believed what it said without the slightest piece of proof.<br>
<br>
And in closing, following Christianity is closing mostly all the doors that are open.  Xuan, according to the bible, you should not even be here &quot;And do not be unequally yoked with unbelievers&quot; and EXACT quote from the Bible, but I don't know the verse (Teacher puts the references up on the board.  I don't have to memorize them <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :p --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":p"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> ).

I positive that not as many people would accept Christanity if it didn't play into the existance heaven and hell. But you have to understand that Christanity didn't start these concepts. They were already incorporated into Judiasm. Its hard to argue the &quot;what if's&quot;, so i'm not really ganna go there.<br>
<br>
My point was, children aren't affraid of goin to hell. In my experience they are taught bible stories exclusively. How many Children bible stories do you know scare people into not wanting to go to hell? Maybe our idea of children's age ranges differ.  /shrug<br>
<br>
And i dont believe adults force things on their children, because they &quot;know what will happen.&quot; Life can throw you a curve ball at anytime my friend, no matter what you are taught. But the world around you is constantly trying to teach you things. Whether it be through the media, school, peer's, ect. And most of the time, those teachings are anti-Christian. So if your a parent who lives a Christian lifystyle, wouldn't you want to share with your child the understanding that you have, or would you let the world teach your child what &quot;it&quot; wants your child to believe.<br>
<br>
The &quot;unequally yoked with unbelievers&quot; verse, doesn't mean what you think it does. The bible teaches that a Christian shouldn't marry a non-christian. Jesus hung out with tax collectors (very hated people) and prostitues, because they were the ones who needed to hear the Word.

<br>
Why should they be?  They have already been brainwashed into believing they are going to heaven.<br>
<br>
Life doesn't throw curve balls.  That is why you tell your children to not do drugs, and to not have sex without protection.<br>
<br>
The reason that those teachings are &quot;anti-Christian&quot; as you put it, is because the world currently believes in *gasp* a theory that can be proven rather than one which is backed up by itself.<br>
<br>
&quot;So if your a parent who lives a Christian lifystyle, wouldn't you want to share with your child the understanding that you have, or would you let the world teach your child what &quot;it&quot; wants your child to believe.&quot;<br>
<br>
THAT is where the problem comes in.  A Christian lifestyle is fine in fact, it's perfect.  But when you bring in a character like the devil, you no longer give people any rational choice.  And THAT is why religion is bad.<br>
<br>
The fact that you do not KNOW for certain (or really at all) if the Bible is true, or just another fiction book, and are passing it off to your children as fact is what makes Christianity bad.<br>
<br>
Also, you're right about the unequally yoked thing <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  , I just figured I'd pull that out of my ass.

<br>
I thought you were arguing that children are taught &quot;fear&quot;, at an early age?<br>
<br>
And the anti-Christian teachings that i was refrencing, actually had nothing to do with evolution. I'm not sure where you got that from? I'm talking about the moral decay (Christianity morals) of society, in general.<br>
<br>
Ok, and you say that teaching a child a Christian lifestyle is &quot;perfect&quot;, but then go on to say that some things in Christianity shouldn't be taught, like the devil-is where i'm confused.<br>
<br>
Sure, the bible has been retranslated a few times. But with adequate study, you can take the earliest manuscripts and compare them to today's versions and you will find they are increadibly reliable. To make my point, if you leave out certain things that Jesus taught in Christanity (like the Devil)-your making a &quot;feel good religion&quot; for yourself.<br>
<br>
If you dont think people still have a rational choice, then why do sooo many people Not make the Christian lifestyle choice? It's a choice, non-the-less.<br>
<br>
I believe i should get a bit personal here. I do, myself, believe that the bible is in Fact-the Word of God. I have no doubts to this testimony. In my mind and my heart, the bible is true in its teaching of Jesus.<br>
<br>
And your ganna have to quote a refrence where the NT says, do not hang out with non-Christians. It would kinda make missonary work impossible, dont ya think?<br>
<br>
I believe everyone should have something in life to believe in. Kinda like veiwing the bigger picture. I have found wisdom and understanding in the teachings of Jesus. And when one day i do have children, you can bet i'm ganna teach them what my heart tells me. Jesus' core teachings are: Love God with all your heart, and love your neighbor. Are they really that bad? <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000028><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub77.ezboard.com/uquintain.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Quintain</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Member of the Posse</span><br>  Posts: 5684<br> <font color=#FFFF00>(6/21/02 5:46:33 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub77.ezboard.com/ftallonzektimes4735generaldiscussion.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=32479.topic&index=52>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Teaching children Christianity</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> <br>

Throughout Human History, more deaths have been caused due to secular reasons than for religious reasons.  The secular deaths dwarf religious-based deaths by about a factor of 100 or so (estimation).<br>
<br>
So, NOT being religious is much worse than being religious if you are simply counting &quot;deaths&quot;.  <p><center>Quintain<BR>Dark Consortium</center></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#00000F><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub77.ezboard.com/utulli.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Tulli</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/anim_1.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>hated globally</span><br>  Posts: 1451<br> <font color=#FFFF00>(6/21/02 6:05:07 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub77.ezboard.com/ftallonzektimes4735generaldiscussion.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=32479.topic&index=53>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Teaching children Christianity</span><hr size=1> I never said CHILDREN are taught fear.  There is no need for the fear tactics if you have a fresh mind ready to be brainwashed.<br>
<br>
When I said that Christianity is &quot;perfect&quot; I was refering to the teachings of Christ.  They teach basic morales and are good for people, but the religion part twists the whole thing up and in my opinion, makes it bad.<br>
<br>
I've never been with making any type of religion for myself.  I believe religions like Christianity corrupt minds, limiting choices in life without any reliable proof (and no, a book that refers everything you should believe back to itself is bullshit.  That is like me making a book saying that I am God, and that all the proof you need is in this book.)<br>
<br>
Not accepting Christianity is not a rational option if God really does exist, because then you would go to hell, and seeing as how that isn't neutral or above, it isn't rational.<br>
<br>
Tell me Xuan.  Were you raised in a Christian home, believing in God before you even knew the books of the Bible (not even in order)?  That is most likely the root of your belief.  Frankly, I don't think someone as intelligent as yourself would be able to believe in something without any physical proof (and as stated before, cross/self-reference is not proof.)<br>
<br>
I'm going to refrain on the verses right now.  So many in my mind, but without references they mean little.<br>
<br>
I believe in the unknown.  I don't know what is going to happen, and I don't care at all to put my absolute and total faith into something that I cannot prove at all.  And Jesus' core teachings in my opinion are that you better get saved or you are going to hell.  Of course if I became a Christian, those would no longer look like the core teachings to me, because I wouldn't have that to worry about.<br>
<br>
Edit:  Also Quintain, it is pretty different.  Wars about religion should be non-existant seeing as how most religions' main teachings (on the inside anyway) are to stop fighting (and most originated at *gasp* the same time period when fighting was going on in the lands) and to love one another.  Secular wars are completely different seeing as how within the secular world there is no teaching of peace or love.<br>
<br>
Sooooo, being religious is still worse than being non-religious counting deaths, seeing as how the main focus of religion is to NOT cause death.<br>
<br>

If you think this, Tulli, then you are pretty damn ignorant about Christianity in general.  Because Christianity is all about conflict between what is Good and what is Evil.  <br>
<br>
I can quote you many passages in the Bible where Christ mentions bringing conflict.

I became a Christian later in life, about three years ago actually.<br>
<br>
And also, the claims of Christianty are not only backed by the bible itself, but also by oral teachings and traditions.<br>
<br>
And since where talking about your opinion here Tulli, if your not in bed yet, why do you think religion is so bad?<br>
<br>
I'm curious as to specifics. Like is it a certain book of the NT you dont like? Is it &quot;christians&quot; attitudes your in conflict with? I'm curious is to why you think the Christian religion is bad?<br>
<br>
You are right about one thing though. Alot of people come to Christ through fear. And then when they are &quot;born-again&quot;, the fear does diminish. And the relationship becomes one of love, rather then the aspect of hell.<br>
<br>
Science isn't the all encompassing answer. If you use the scientific method, can you prove: that George Washington really did live? Was Martin Luther King really a civil rights leader? Did Jesus Christ raise from the dead?<br>
These are out of the real of scientific proof, and they need to be placed in the realm of - legal proof. And i've found, in my studies, the reliabilty of the written and oral Christian testomines to be sound and believable. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#00000F><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub77.ezboard.com/utulli.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Tulli</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/anim_1.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>hated globally</span><br>  Posts: 1459<br> <font color=#FFFF00>(6/21/02 6:45:34 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub77.ezboard.com/ftallonzektimes4735generaldiscussion.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=32479.topic&index=59>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Teaching children Christianity</span><hr size=1> Not to flame you or anything, but Homer's &quot;Oddesy&quot; and &quot;Illiad&quot; were both oral tales and both written down.

<br>
I know George Washington lived because there are countless books on him.  The same with Martin Luther, albeit not as many.  I only have one book telling me that Jesus rose from the dead (any others that were written after Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John I consider spin-offs).<br>
<br>
The reason I don't like religion is because of how Christians recruit.  They tell children something that cannot be proven by a hair, and make it fact.  In all honesty, I believe it should be illegal, but hey, this is America.<br>

We have written accounts from Martin Luther King Jr and George Washington, as well as the accounts of both friend and foe. What do we have about Jesus? Accounts written over 30 years after his alleged ressurection and mention by 2 historians that weren't even alive at the time. Not a single house built by the carpenter, not a word written by the teacher. <br>
<br>
As far as fear in religion. Sure you might feel all warm now, but that God of yours would torture you for eternity if you disobeyed him. Your suffering would be greater than anything any man has ever suffered on earth and it would endure for eternity. Sure you can say that it's a consequence, but your God set us up to fall and then extorts our adoration at the point of a gun packing eternal hellfire. God is like a Doctor that breaks your leg and threatens to gut you if you don't look on him with love as he sets the bone.<br>
<br>
Should children be taught religion? No. It's mind control and that has made the world a horrible place to live. If you love your children, teach them reason and let them form their own opinions. Don't make them believe what nobody can agree on anyway (that includes telling them to believe in nothing). <p><IMG SRC ="http://astitious.homestead.com/files/Dagarn.jpg"><br>
