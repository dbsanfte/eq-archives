<br>
I hesitate to say *anyone* thinks to much or too deeply ...how can that be when by creation or evolution (or both ) has given us our one truly defining characteristic .. that is -- our reasoning minds. Telling someone they think too deeply and that denial can be a good thing is just so.. negative I think there are better ways to say dude you think a lot but you need a way to chill too. We all need to chill every now and then but lets move on...<br>
<br>
Granted people pleasing is a good insight to yourself. It can set you up for being a pushover and being sorely taken advantage of and having all your emotional reserves and energy sucked dry.<br>
<br>
Compassion and empathy are what this world needs most - and it's funny how most people lack... it ... and integrity(this is all my opinion im not cynical - I have keen observation) and will latch on to it and guilt a nice caring person into total annihilation . which can leave you bitter, wondering if your D.N.A. wasn't manipulated by aliens - which is why you don't really fit in and you don't understand why you see other people behaving in such dork ways - when it;s all so obvious can;t we all just LOVE and GET THE FREAKN HELL ALONG? Why is it so hard?, and  then living in some rabbit den in twilight zone Illinois(which is where I am =P but im currently looking for a nice mountain cave where no one can get to -except for me i mean)<br>
<br>
It's good to think. It's good to be compassionate. It's hard to draw the line and decide when enough is enough esp. when you risk causing pain ... when your life is really not about that.<br>
<br>
The world is so strange and when I look back at all the great thinkers of the world. All the books. All the evils and goods we should have learned from ... I just don't understand why it isn't better. Why the ego's and the greed and the ignorance over ride any amount of goodness out there. Is learning really NOT possible?  Are we in hell right now paying that *life debt* thing? Are we here by choice learning something and returning home someday (if I find out I set myself up for this hell ride im gona kick my ass)? Are we doing that karmic thing? Are we Mary Shelly's abandoned*monster Abomination* created and left for being the true nightmare creations we are? Do we just have no clue and will figure itout when we hit that *otherside* as resentful specters or lost wondering souls? Will we receive further instructions upon entering the light (and I hope to god I don't have to write an essay)?<br>
<br>
But more than that what do we do when we are here? so often I think to myself that... Ok. so ill be an artist and do monster designs or web design and then so what? or im a doctor and so what? or I go into psychology and do criminal profiling and in the end so what? I'll join the peace core and try to make the hell ride for everyone here to some degree as easy as possible but in the end SO WHAT?<br>
<br>
what's the point? im confused as hell and honestly I spend most of my time wondering about relationships and getting really sidetracked by that and the fear that nothing really lasts..and UGH.!!<br>
<br>
yes, A Zen master candidate I am not! I believe that there are certain common ground rules for good in humans and you'll find them in all cultures .. such as &quot;don't steal my stuff that includes my marriage partner or my donkey (which might be the same thing) and don't kill anyone cause it might be someone I know...etc.<br>
<br>
<br>
and we continue do to all these things and more and get confused and rehash it and there are so many opinions and gods and bad ideas in all religions and various governments and truly evil people like pedophiles and whats up with that??.... that my head just might blow off.<br>
<br>
<br>
which is why im moving to a cave in the mountains somewhere very soon.<br>
<br>
<br>
so anyway.. it doesn't answer a thing I... im just sayN that a. you have to learn when to back off for your own health..B. risk sticking up for yourself with confrontations and taking the hurt feelings that come to you and those you might cause others.. from confrontation but it's  for learning reasons...(education I believe is still everyone's best bet for better living so if you can speak and live your good word what ever that is  while also setting your boundries and keeping your sanity- then your doing the best you can and maybe helping someone along the way.) and C. keep thinking and looking and searching. No one has any idea and you know too being a thinker that the question you asked about purpose isn't the first time it's been asked ..but to quote Sophie's world (as sweet a book as any  or a  younger reader) doh can't find it =P but it went along the lines of this... that we are all via our knowledge gained , standing on the backs of each great thinker before us, climbing the hairs of the white rabbit hoping to someday see the face of the &quot;great magician&quot;<br>
<br>
so keep thinking. you have years of history behind you to start from and you will lend all you have to those who come after you. =)<br>
<br>
<br>
*whew* thanks for allowing me to vent!<br>
<br>
<br>
peace ,<br>
