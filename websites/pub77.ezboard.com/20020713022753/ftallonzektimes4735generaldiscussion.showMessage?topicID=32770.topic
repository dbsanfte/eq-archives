Janze, 54 human paladin for sale, $250 with decent gear.<br>
her reason for selling was, "im having a baby and need some money"<br>
sounded honest enough to me, so i told him to buy it.<br>
<br>
My friend wanted to start a higher lvl char so he could play with me.  sounded honest enough to me, so i told him to buy it.<br>
<br>
about 2 or 3 months later the account info has changed, the billing info was still in my friends name for about a week after it was stolen.  I tried to get in touch with her to help my friend out, and i ended up getting some bullshit story about how it was someone else's account, and that they had started up again.  <br>
Well, that would be no problem to me.... IF the person who sold it had given the money back, ie. Adonia Shadowstepper.<br>
they didnt, they kept the cash, and sold the account again.  I have talked to the new owner and they told me the gear that was promised to them wasnt even on the character.<br>
<br>
----------------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
A short while later my other friend wanted to group up with us, (before Janze was stolen back).<br>
<br>
Enter Elvenstar.<br>
He bought the account in two payments of checks to him.  Michael Hodges.<br>
the account went to my friend with almost no problems, 49+ DE enchanter with almost all spells.  only thing that was misrepresented was the 250 jewelcrafting skill was really more like 100 JC skill, no biggie.<br>
Soon after Janze was stolen back, so was elvenstar.  They had been talking through emails the whole time and michael had seemed like a pretty nice guy, helping my friend with strats to play the chanter or some such thing. (not sure about what all the emails were about).<br>
then one day poof, P-word was changed and Elvenstar was sold again in short order.<br>
after about 2 weeks, the new owner was scammed.<br>
<br>
well, thats what happened, believe me or not, tis the truth.<br>
<br>
EDIT: thank you Rummol for your say in this matter.  As far as RL $ trading in EQ you are without a doubt the authority.  As i am not a message board warrior, i understand people doubting what i have to say.  But Rummol my friends, knows his shit.<br>

I sold him as I got him. I changed nothing. I had come to learn Janze had been in several hands before mine. I sold the account and rid my hands of it. This is what happened as I know to be true:<br>
<br>
I bought Janze because I wanted to go on high level raids. I logged him in maybe 3 times. Became too tired to play, was having a baby and had other things to work out. I decided to sell Janze. I offered Janze to the original Janze first. He said he would have loved to buy it but couldn't for some reason. I also offered it to Taenarin. No one wanted, so I put it up for sale. After some time and reducing my asking price I got a buyer. I got my money via paypal and I handed over the password. I have had nothing to do with the account since then. Being that I did not change the billing info when I got it (I didn't know better) then it is possible *ANY* of the other owners snagged him back. I have explained this before on the former TzT auction board and my explination was satisfactory then. edit: In fact, I was the one who offered the history of the account up to and including my involvement. I knew Janze's cousin was on his account because I was guilded with Janze when he first sold it. I follwed the account from there. I know the former owners before me but will not disclose their names.<br>
<br>
Last I *heard* Janze was claming this account was stolen from him by his cousin who had permission to use the account, but when Janze went to the military the cousin sold the account and Janze had acquired his account back.<br>
<br>
I am not in the possession of Janze nor have I been in quite a long time. I do not have Janze and I completed the transaction as promised. I got money and your friend got the account. I am not your scammer sir. It looks like one of the owners after me ran the scam, but since my selling of it was advertised you are placing the blame on me.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr>  I have talked to the new owner <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--> ?? So your friend has also sold this account?<br>
<br>
My theory: in order to aquire an account back that has been stolen you need the CD keys (which I did not have) billing name and address and the last 6 digits of the credit card originally used to register the account. I do not have this information, but the original Janze does and maybe even this &quot;cousin&quot; of his. If your friend changed the billing info then he would have also changed the billing e-mail address. So if your friend noticed the account was taken why didn't he request the password from the website? The website automatically sends an e-mail to the current e-mail address with the password.<br>
<br>
I did not scam you or your friend. It does look like you were caught in a loop of an account that has been sold too much. I am sorry for your loss, but I too have been a victim of this in the past. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub77.ezboard.com/uadoniashadowstepper.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Adonia Shadowstepper</A> at: 6/28/02 6:22:36 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000028><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub77.ezboard.com/uthisle.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Thisle</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>The Clown of TzT</span><br>  Posts: 1352<br> <font color=#FFFF00>(6/28/02 6:16:28 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub77.ezboard.com/ftallonzektimes4735generaldiscussion.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=32770.topic&index=11>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: She has scammed</span><hr size=1> Aye, Rummol  =teh shiz~<br>
<br>
My recomendation is that if you do buy an account, first have your own account, then pay VI to switch the char from the account you bought to YOUR account.  Its like 30bucks...  If you pay 250+ to acually buy the account, 30 shouldnt be a problem.<br>
<br>
I wouldnt buy any &quot;tainted&quot; accounts either.  Before you buy an account, ask how many times its been traded, and then do your own research...Ask around in game...<br>
<br>
&quot;Do you know soandso character?&quot;<br>
<br>
Ask guilds and what not.  <br>
<br>
The safest way to buy an account is not to buy one at all really.  But if your going to do it, thats how it should be done.  <br>
<br>
i got into the account trading a while back, i had fun doing it, i enjoyed playing high lvl different class's.  I just got lucky i wasnt scammed.  But many others wernt so lucky, i know of at least 2 of the char i played at one time and then traded, were stolen back.<br>
<br>
Who cares if they offer an account key...chances are they wont give you one, or its fake.  <br>

<br>
That will lead to the acct. getting blocked, VI does check this out unlike the xfer service to legends. So if you try it and loose the char. you have been warned.<br>

As for Adonia scamming people. The info I would need to prove it is in the US and I am in Spain right now. The person who tried to sell me Janze was either Adonia or someone really good at impersonating her and knowing a lot of info about her.<br>

You buy an acct from someone and try to have that char. moved to your own acct.... you stand a high liklyhood chance of have ur new shiny bought acct. blocked. IU know someone here who tried o do tha, not only would they not xfer the char. the acct. was blocked.<br>
<br>
But like was said b4 you would be the master of EQ profit *shrug* wtf would I know. <p><a href="http://osi.iwarp.com"><img src="http://osi.iwarp.com/osi1.jpg" border="0"></a><br><b>Osiryss</b> 60 SK of <b>TZ</b></a>

<br>
Talked to the head GM about it, he said he would "take care of it" and a week later they were both back to scammin with Elvenstar and Janze.<br>
