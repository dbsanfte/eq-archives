The graphic engine is a lot better than whatever BG1 uses but still it looks crappier. Voice acting for characters seems crappy, no depth.<br><br>From the start you are this great hero and you get missions that are impossible at that level and the first quest I got didnt seem to make much sense if you compare it to ADND. Kill 4 creatures to cure this plague. Great! Thats it, it doesnt give any more story... why those 4 creatures, why they are so special, why noone has made the cure so far blah blah blah. It has a lot of Diablo2ish cheesy feel when you play it.<br><br>Quests are linear, no creativity on your side is needed. Kill guy A, receive item X. Quests dont lead well into others. The world is drab, ugly, and full of non-memorable or over-cliche characters.<br><br>The combat blows as well. Target a guy, sit, stand and if you are a spellcaster you hit the spacebar a bunch of times. <br><br>I wasnt much of a fan of BG1 but their story was good and their multiplayer blew. Now they made the story shitty and tried to do good multiplayer? Too bad that the multiplayer isnt all that fun as well. There are cool tools but its not gonna be good until people come up with cool campaigns and the combat system doesnt really efavor any team play. Rules are hard ( might be cause I have no clue about ADND other than what I have read on the net ), things happen fast.<br><br>Why they sell a game for 50$ that relies on the players to make good campaigns is rediculous, besides how many people can make campaigns that are as good as BG2 or whatever. Not many or none. Many more people want to play a game than make worlds for it. There are no good mods for Morrowind or Dungeon Siege... why should there be any for NWN.<br><br>In short, this game blows and is at best mediocre. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000028><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub77.ezboard.com/umalastan.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Malastan</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>the Eyebiter</span><br>  Posts: 1053<br> <font color=#FFFF00>(6/28/02 3:46:18 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub77.ezboard.com/ftallonzektimes4735frm20.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=75.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Am i the only one who thinks NWN sucks?</span><hr size=1> <br>I think you are missing the point of the game.

Instead of moving figurines around and drawing out maps for the players, as a world builder, you can use the various tools from the game and SHOW them what they see, and instead of waiting on players to hemm and haw out of a situation, they have to act on the spot, and decide on what their next course of action will be.<br><br>If you are looking for the better version of EQ, then look to Shadowbane, or possibly Horizons.  I'll say this, however.  While I might have shelled out $55 for this game, at least I'm not still paying $10 a month and WAITING for the various gaming companies to &quot;balance&quot; the classes, add promised abilities in the game, and have them finally address constant bugs/glitches/cheats for a game that they were supposed to have had resolved before release.<br><br>Oh, and with this game, at least my friends and I can pick and choose whom we want to play with, versus having to put up with those that make the gaming experience unpleasant.<br><br><br>formerly Larlana Lavode <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#00000F><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub77.ezboard.com/urummol.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Rummol</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/globalBlack.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 2157<br> <font color=#FFFF00>(6/28/02 2:27:40 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub77.ezboard.com/ftallonzektimes4735frm20.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=75.topic&index=12>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Yea</span><hr size=1> But then the mods would have to be good which not many people will be capable of doing.

Nothing wrong with that, many people play just FPS and RTS and dislike CRPG's and WG's, others just play CRPG's and hate FPS's, etc.  <br><br>What is a little bit ignorant in your original post is judging a game from a genre that you don't like.   If you don't like CRPG's you'd be hard pressed to tell which ones are good and which ones aren't, just as I'd be hard pressed to tell which FPS's are good and which aren't because I don't like FPS's. <p>M.</p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000028><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub77.ezboard.com/uennder.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Ennder</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/globalBlack.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 1477<br> <font color=#FFFF00>(6/29/02 2:28:39 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub77.ezboard.com/ftallonzektimes4735frm20.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=75.topic&index=17>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Am i the only one who thinks NWN sucks?</span><hr size=1> Well if you don't like RPG's in general, then why would you liket this one you big dummy!<br><br>I think people have put all kinds of unfair expectations on NWN.  If sitting around playing a RPG with your friends doesn't excite you, you probably won't love NWN.  If you aren't a single player RPG fan either, you probably won't even like it.  If you are mostly an action game fan (like fat portugal) then I wouldn't expect you to like it much. <p><a href =http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=210569>Fraustkilicus, Halfling Paladin</a> </p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#00000F><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub77.ezboard.com/uretrievil.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Retrievil</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_bluespot.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Got Splurt?</span><br>  Posts: 2807<br> <font color=#FFFF00>(7/1/02 2:24:27 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub77.ezboard.com/ftallonzektimes4735frm20.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=75.topic&index=18>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://whitepapers.homestead.com/files/reticon.jpg h=185 w=120></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Am i the only one who thinks NWN sucks?</span><hr size=1> short answer for Rummol: yes<br><br><br>I'm finding it great so far just playing sp .. and im so looking forward to playing some mp games.
