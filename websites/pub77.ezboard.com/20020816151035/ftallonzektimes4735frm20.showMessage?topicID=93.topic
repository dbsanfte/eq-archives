I have created a CTF/TF (capture the flag/team fortress) Mod.<br><br>I'm pretty proud of it, but it needs some playtesting and a little ironing out. I'd appreciate any feedback or bug reports on it.<br><br>It will be up as much as I can have it available, IP Address is: 68.0.153.92 (port 5121). It'll be listed in the Action Channel as !Tactics Capture the Flag!.<br><br>Here's how it works, most of the code is focused on cheating/exploit protection, so there are some features along that line not mentioned.<br><br>On login, your player is stripped of all items and gold, your plot flag is set to false (until that bug is fixed next patch i assume), your exp is set to 66,000 (exactly level 12).<br><br>you are presented the choice of red or blue (i've coded autobalancing but i'm not sure if it's working yet). then transported to the appropriate base.<br><br>In your home area. there are 3 &quot;Drill Instructors&quot;. all 3 are identical. They give you choices of gear to pick from. if you escape from the conversation everything given is taken away and you start over, you can also talk to them again to change your choices. pretty much all gear given is equipped directly onto your character.<br><br>first set of choices are Armor: one of each type cloth through full plate. all are +2, and are colored red or blue depending on which team you picked.<br><br>second choice is primary weapon, any +2 weapon can be chosen as well as a set of +2 monk gloves, and a magic staff that gives a few bonus spell slots (1,2,3) for wizards/sorcerers. <br><br>third choice is to choose another weapon or a shield. again all +2<br><br>fourth choice is to choose a Kit. (Kit descriptions at bottom).<br><br>finally each character is given 2 cure moderate wounds potions and 2 +1 healer kits.<br><br><br>It sounds like a lot (and was a lot to code heh), but it only takes a few seconds to pick your gear and start playing.<br><br>the only other npc in the home area is the Blue/Red Gateway. this NPC will give you the option to transport outside to begin play, or to change team (hopefully with autobalancing).<br><br>the Battle Area is a '2fort' map using the rural tileset. <br><br>Features of the map:<br><br>1. Door back into 'home' area can only be used by the appropriate team and only if they aren't carrying the flag.<br><br>2. Flag. you can take the flag from the enemy base, it appears on your character. if you die on the way back it drops to the ground and can be picked up by another team member.<br><br>3. Fort Doors. fort doors are locked with a pretty high DC, they can be unlocked/relocked. or they can be bashed down. Fort Doors will open after taking 300 hit points of damage. will stay open for 60 seconds and then close and lock itself, another 300 damage will have to be done to open it again.<br><br>3a. Fort Doors part II, fort doors will transport their own teammembers outside/inside the base even when locked. there is also an alternate (one way) exit from each base.<br><br>4. beginnings of scoring system, 10 points per cap (for the team, and it broadcasts the name of the capper). i just fixed a bug in this so it still might be reporting wrong. next in line will be a 1 pt allotment per kill.<br><br>5. No resting in Battle Area, you can take the door back into your home area if you don't have the flag and rest/get more potions in there.<br><br><br>Kits:<br><br>Each Kit is a belt slot item that is equipped directly onto the character when chosen.<br><br>Spy Kit, Skill Bonus: Hide+5, Skill Bonus: Move Silently+5, Skill Bonus: Open Lock+5, Immunity: Mind Affecting Spells<br><br>Scout Kit, Skill Bonus: Listen+8, Skill Bonus: Spot+8, Haste.<br><br>Bard Kit, Cha: +2, AC: +1, Bonus Spells(0,1,2), Skill Bonus: Perform+6<br><br>Defense Kit, Con: +2, AC: +1, Regeneration+1, Skill Bonus: Discipline: +2<br><br>Offense Kit, Str: +4, Discipline: +4<br><br>Healers Kit, Wis: +4, Concentration: +4<br><br>Resistance Kit: Damage Resistance: Acid/Fire/Cold/Electrical: 15/-, Saving Throw Bonus: Universal+2<br><br>Archer/Finesse Kit, Dex: +4, Skill Bonus: Spot+5<br><br>Sorcerer Kit, Cha+2, Bonus Spells (2,3,4)<br><br>Wizard Kit, Int+2, Bonus Spells (2,3,4)<br><br><br><br>Try it out i think it's pretty good, after it's playtested and i've got the code stable and commented i'll release it, I'm also planning other maps for it, the next one will be a 'counterstrike' based map with hostage objectives.<br><br> <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000028><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A
