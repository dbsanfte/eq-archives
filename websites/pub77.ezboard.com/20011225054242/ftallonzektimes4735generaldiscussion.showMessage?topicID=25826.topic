<br>
In a nutshell, due to Verant's complete negligence of pvp/racewar and the attitude of the majority of the people on the server, we will be playing on TZ as if it were a guildwar rather than racewar server. Dark team members of our guild are allowed to group with players of the human, elven, and short teams. Members of the dark, human, elven, and short teams are all welcome to apply to our guild, if they can meet the requirements (good person, good player, unanimous vote). The objective of the guild (to have a good time with friends) remains the same, and nothing will be different about the conduct or character of its members - some of them just might have different colored names. <br>
<br>
The reasons and arguments for and against 4-teaming have been hashed out a million and one times on this board; I don't think anyone wants to read them again and I certainly don't want to waste time writing them. Suffice to say this is no longer a true racewar server, so there is no reason to war with other races. <br>
<br>
For the remaining dark guilds who want to stay true to the original &quot;vision&quot; of this server, you don't have to assume that we are your enemies. I think those of you who have known and talked with me the last 6+ months know that I am not a grief player; there are plenty of other things that I find fun besides ruining someone else's fun. So, you have my word that if you choose to remain on friendly terms with our guild and leave lights with a &lt;Sanctimony&gt; tag over their heads alone, we will not invulnerable heal against you, use darks to track your movements, or any of the multitude of complaints most darks have against four-teaming. I have no desire to do these things to the people we have worked with and respect, and I hope that you in turn will respect our decision if not join our cause. Perhaps we can change TZ into a true guild vs guild server rather than the unbalanced, unsupported, and obsolete team vs team system it currently is. <br>
<br>
Of course, it is your decision. In the end, all of us are just here to have fun, and that's all that matters.<br>
<br>
~ (had to add that since no post on TZT seems complete without it)<br>
<br>
Have fun and see ya in Norrath,<br>

The dark team was fragmented by differences of opinion. High level dark guilds tended to try to be more professional than light guilds, they had high standards and very specific policies. <br>
<br>
I never wanted this but if the rest of the one team darks didn't see this coming then maybe they should open their eyes. <br>
<br>
Months ago in Nox Noctis I watched applicant after applicant turned away for little or no reason. I watched the number of players in the guild online dwindle as people played twinks. <br>
<br>
When someone finally put forward the option of merging Nox with other guilds I was stunned by the number of people who said no for no apparent reasonl! Nox was withering away and people would have rathered watching it die than creating something new. <br>
<br>
I don't know what it is, but the dark team's vitality is gone. IMO this should never have been necessary. A widespread merger should have been implemented months ago. Sanctimony, Exordium, the old PKs, Fist of innoruuk were too small to do anything big PvE wise, and they got bored. Plain and simple. Now I know there are a select group of darks who say they don't want to do anything big PvE wise, but they DO NOT represent the majority of dark players and it has been the dominance of that perspective that has killed the dark team, not pande and not DAoC. <br>
<br>
There have been and are enough high darks to create one guild strong enough to take on Pandemonium. They simply won't do it. It sad that it is easier for Sanc to ally with lights than it is to ally with their own teammates.<br>

<br>
if you dont believe me, look at all the @#%$ that happened when they got together to take down an epic mob like rage or severilous.  i think there were a dozen different plans drawn up by each guild as to how loot should be divided. <br>
<br>
and they called PDM greedy lootwhores.....<br>

<br>
I hope that the dark team remains undiluted within the guilds of eXo, lex and FoI. However, I can no longer see the future as a clear line. For these guilds to remain undiluted, they must fight against unbelieveable odds. I do not wish Sanctimony luck, for they do not need them. The path has already been forged for them to walk down. They are followers. The ones who truely need luck in this case are the pure orange team guilds. <br>

For some reason, Tools: Eulogy keeps playing in my head.. well &quot;not all martyr's see divinity, but at least you tried.&quot; RIP WoZ, for now you are truely dead and what you stood for is forgotten.  <br>

edit: at least that's what his sig said.. haven't played in a few.<br>
<br>
edit2: in any case, my point was that the high level game is a very enclosed system. everyone knows everyone else. im sure half of em know people in pande and are probably good friends with them. the fact that they specifically haven't done crossteaming doesn't mean that it is any more difficult then single teaming. in fact, it is easier because they have less people who are trying to kill them (to say the darks in sactimony I mean)<br>
