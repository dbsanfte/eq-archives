I wanted to spend a moment posting on TZ Times, as I am currently doing with all light guilds that I have url addresses for.  Let me start by introducing myself and AA for those of you that are unfamiliar with us/me.<br><br>AA is one of the oldest light guilds on TZ.  As a matter of fact, we are 2nd oldest only to KotWR.  We are have never allowed darks or x-teamers into our guild, and have been a sanctuary for the light races even during the darkest times of the server.<br><br>Personally, I have been in the guild since its inception, and although I have played mainly on SZ lately, my greatest loyalty is always to TZ since it was the home of my first real character.  Recently, I decided to start playing more on TZ, and I have noticed some disturbing things not only on TZ as a whole, but within AA as well.<br><br>The two greatest challenges facing all of us right now seem to be 1) where did the hell did all the x-teamers come from?  When I stopped playing TZ regularly the only x-teamers were Pande, and everyone looked at them with disgust.  And 2) Why is there no &quot;real&quot; light unity on the server.<br><br>It is because of both of these things that I am addressing you today.  What I would like to propose is that we make a concerted effort to group together more, and try to bring the light guilds into unison.  I am going to be making this same effort with as many honorable light guilds as possible, in order to form a loose coalition for a common purpose...defend our lands, and help us to all grow in stature.  Right now I think we do an adequate job when grouping but I believe we can so much more…I envision light only chat channels, web pages and completely controlled zones.<br><br>One thing I am keenly away of also, is that we do not lose our unique identities as we do this.  I am not suggesting that we all merge to form one large guild, but rather that we all work together as common allies.<br><br>I look forward to hearing from you in game, and I invite you to post on our website so that we can learn about your guild and your values and traditions.  In game, I will probably be playing either Koolcat or Zayis, and I look forward to hearing from you.<br><br>Take care,<br>Koolcat <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000028><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub77.ezboard.com/umcshortie.showPublicProfile?language=EN>McShortie</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 20<br> <font color=#FFFF00>(4/6/02 8:09:18 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub77.ezboard.com/ftallonzektimes4735guildsoftallonzek.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=562.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: ALL LIGHT GUILDS READ!!!</span><hr size=1> The light alliance was formed from neccessity, when you played.

An X-teamer is one who guilds/groups with people who are not on his or her team. There are only a handful of non X-teaming light guilds out there, i.e. Short Unity and Retribution Reborn.

SO the only justification I can have is that (tongue incheek) my side is the only right side in this game.  I chose the light races to be the ones I would fight for, I am to nice to be a bad guy, to be honest.<br>As far as the gang rape allusion, I think that someone needs to see what happens when I a cleric of brell runs into at least one or two darks at my level and goes down in 30 seconds.  sheesh I feel like i been spit out for breakfast, and I cannot recall how many times I have run into more than that at one time and not lived.  Gate does get interrupted once in a bit.<br>I do not know if they gloat after.  It does not matter to me what they do after, I loot and scoot.  So what do I care what they think about defeating a light.  Getting ganked is just part of the game.<br>I have seen the ruleset for SZ, I was not sure I could deal with the rules after being on Tallon for so long.  You do have a point though.  I will however, still not go 4 team, and neither will Archaic Arbitrators, while I am leading it.<br>I do not think to be honest that lighties are superior just right.  I could care less what the &quot;newbs&quot; think.  We can still get our epics and have fun playing this game.  Some said that once the sever started going 4 team that the light guilds would fold, there are several that have not and I do not believe they will.<br>remember to have fun and just don't be lame and we can continue to play. <p>"Character is what you are in the dark" and when no one is looking!<BR>Archaic Arbitrator's Leader with an eye on Justice and the Family of Archaic Arbitrators.</p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#00000F><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub77.ezboard.com/uteeowe.showPublicProfile?language=EN>teeowe</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 2<br> <font color=#FFFF00>(4/9/02 7:22:44 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub77.ezboard.com/ftallonzektimes4735guildsoftallonzek.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=562.topic&index=8>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: ALL LIGHT GUILDS READ!!!</span><hr size=1> Toldek, et.al.-<br><br>/ooc-<br>I couldn't agree more.  I like the good v. evil character of Tallon; I choose TZ over Vallon because I read VZ was more team v team, while TZ was more dark v. light.<br><br>I readily recognize that dark v. light is imperfect when it comes to dividing up teams, since many lights are evil and many darks play good or at least choose agnosticism.<br><br>The environment is set up as good versus evil too.  This makes it seemingly inconsistent to play PvP against, say,  elves in Norrath when dwarves have an alliance against them.  If shorts are at war with elves and humans why can I trade in their cities with little no faction adjustment work?  This is the main problem with TZ as it exists today.<br><br>When I was a DM in D&amp;D as a much younger man, I disallowed evil player characters.  I believe then as now that fantasy role-playing ought to be heroic.  Worshipping Bertox or Inny is far from heroic.<br><br>I play a Dwarf Paladin as my main.  I avoid grouping with SKs and necros.  I protested loudly when my former guild, lron Legion, invited a human Shadow Knight.  When the guild leadership changed hands, and other policy changes that I disagreed with were made, I left to start a new guild.  &lt;i&gt;New Justiciars&lt;/i&gt; is new and small, but rewarding.  We DO NOT allow evil characters, so no worshippers of Bertox, Inny, Cazic or Rallos.  No SKs or necros are allowed of course, since they must be evil.  We are even discussing allowing agnostic darks, but have yet to do so for fear of being accused of being 4-teamers.  Others have asked me how can we do plane raids if we have no necros?  To be honest I haven't given this much thought, but I expect we'll make it ok; it will make raids more challenging, but possibly more fun for it.<br><br>Why don't I play on Sullon?  Because its more than good v. evil.  There is also a neutral team and the dynamics don't make for good roleplay.<br><br>Summarizing, TZ's racial PvP is out of alignment with PvE.  Good v. Evil is what I am trying to roleplay, and TZ seemed the best, yet imperfect, choice.  Sullon's rules and neutral team make it a less perfect choice for me.<br><br>Lighties, or more precisely, non-evil characters unite!<br><br>Hunt safely!
