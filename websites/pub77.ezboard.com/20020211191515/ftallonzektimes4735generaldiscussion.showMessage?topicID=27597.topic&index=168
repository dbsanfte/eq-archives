<br>
I'm not sympathetic to the prisoners who are at the center at this debate.  What I'm concerned about is the precedent that will be set if the U.S. military gets to carry out secret trials against these people.  Not only does that give our military the go ahead to seize, try, and punish &quot;enemies of the state&quot; without the checks and balances of the press and the civilian judicial system, not to mention, other countries will feel much more free to capture, try, and punish U.S. citizens in secret military tribunals of their own.<br>

The precedent you describe and the possible consequences are indeed bad Malwae, but it could be worse. Israel assassinates suspect terrorists without any form of capture or trial, secret or otherwise. I mean.. think about it.<br>

Curious choice of words there that underscores your point of view. It may serve your purpose of an argument to call every Taliban a terrorists; however, they are not Al Qaeda.<br>
<br>
The Taliban have the right to be treated as POW's according to the Geneva convention until such time as it can be proven they do not qualify. <br>
<br>
I wonder if we'll see even more come out of what happened in that fortress with the hundreds of prisioners that died there. Some found bound with their hands behind their back.<br>
<br>
That one is still being looked at, but the clear violation of the Geneva convention in America's treatment of Taliban soldiers does nothing to clear the air.<br>
<br>
Now considering that, since you are simply a citizen of the US I suppose that means you don't understand the full impact of what it is for the US to commit war crimes and claim to do them in the name of protecting the world.<br>
<br>
Thanks, but no thanks.  Britain doesn't need that taint.<br>

<br>
Alot of you, especially the &quot;flag waving&quot; americans, seem to be confusing the diffrence between the Taliban and the Al'Qaeda. Those prisoners are a mixture of the two. <br>
<br>
There is absolutely NO grounds for not according the Taliban prisoners POW status. They were the armed forces of the government of Afghanistan (the american govt may not have recognised it, but other countries had, they were for all intents and purposes the legit rulers of the country, and their armed forces should be treated no diffrently than any other countries armed forces).<br>
The Al'Qaeda prisoners are the terrorists, there POW status is more open to debate, thou from what formerEQplayer has posted I personally interpret it as they should be treated as POW's under the Geneva Convention.<br>
<br>
The Taliban were not actively helping Al'Qaeda that anyone has been able to prove, beyond sheltering them and letting them have there camps in the desert etc, mostly because they were fairly sympathetic to the cause.. They wern't actively funding them or anything like that. I know that in the eyes of most of you, thats enough to shoot em all, but hear me out. <br>
<br>
On similar grounds to that, the UK should be dropping bombs on America. It's a well known fact that the IRA solicts donations all across america, and fairly decent sums of money get shipped back to them. The American government officially frowns on this, but unofficially does SFA about it. No one would dispute that the IRA are a terrorist organisation, the US Dept Of State officially classes them as such, yet they have not stomped out this funding (I havn't seen anything in the news, but they may have done something about this situation post sept 11th?)<br>
<br>
While no American likes(liked? they seem to be fairly past tense now) the Taliban (cept for maybe a few muslim radicals), I think that if you put aside your anger and rage at the Sept 11 attack, and at least tone down your flag waving, you should hopefully be able to see where I'm coming from with this..<br>
<br>
I do have some sympathy with the blind hatred and patriotism that some of you have been showing, because I'm guilty of it myself on occasion, being a fairly ardent nationalist. But even with some with my rather extreme views on life, I can try and see the other point of view most of the time, I'm really hoping you can see what i'm getting at here without posting another &quot;@#%$ all you america haters&quot; posts :-) :-)<br>

I guess the big issue is determining whether or not the Taliban soldiers should be considered terrorists or not. They gave safe haven to terrorists, allowed them to construct and make use of training camps on their soil, refused to hand them over after the attacks on September 11, and then fought along side them when the U.S. came to take them by force. Do the above actions make them terrorists? Thats not an easy question to answer. They did not perform any acts of terrorism, but they did support terrorists, to the point of fighting with them. Personally, I am not sure how I would answer that question, if my answer counted. My own feelings could taint my decision, because I am an American.<br>
<br>
Yes, I am patriotic. I served for ten years in the U.S. Navy, and I am proud of it. I consider my country to be one of the greatest. I can say that without feeling ignorant, because I have been fortunate enough to have traveled to 23 other countries, across four continents, (8 of those countries I lived in for 3-6 months at a time). I am not bragging. I am pointing out the fact that my point of view comes from alittle experience, (truth be told, I enjoyed Germany and Iceland the most, out of all my travels). <br>
<br>
At the same time, I am not some blind flag-waving fool. I know hat the U.S.A. is far from perfect. I cannot stand my government most of the time, because the Republicans and the Democrats who make up of government seem to get almost NOTHING accomplished, due to bickering and finger-pointing, and personal agendas that do not help the country at all. <br>
<br>
Again, I will ask: How are the prisoners being treated unfairly?<br>

The Taliban prisoners should be treated as PoWs - held for the duration of the war (please don't kid yourself that it's anything but) to prevent their further participation, then liberated.  The Al Qaeda prisoners on the other hand are terrorists...the same rules don't apply to them, though justice still needs to be served...an accusation of this level of crime requires solid evidence.<br>

---------<br>
The Taliban didn't fight alongside Al'Qaeda as such, it was more that the Al'Qaeda fought alongside them when the US invaded Afghanistan.  The Taliban had minorly supported them, but not &quot;Actively&quot; as already discussed. They asked for proof before considering handing them over, the US said No, sod off, give them to us now or were going to bomb you back to the stoneage. When the US attacked, the national armed forces (IE the Taliban) fought back, they we're assisted in fighting back by Al'Qaeda. I know this is sort of a fine line here, but until the US attacked Afghanistan, the two forces were not fighting together.<br>
<br>
---------<br>
Again, I will ask: How are the prisoners being treated unfairly?<br>
---------<br>
They are not being treated as &quot;Standard&quot; prisoners of war. IMHO there is no ifs, buts or maybes about it, the Taliban should be treated exactly the same as any other prisoner of war is. I cant say I've ever seen/heard of POW's being held chained, gagged, blindfolded, and earmuffed before.. Hell Iraq might have tortured POW's in the gulf war but even they didnt do strange things like this :-) There is more room for movement on the Al'Qaeda, but if as it appears they are governed by the Geneva Convention, then they too should not be subject to these &quot;cruel and unusual conditions&quot;, but treated as standard POW's<br>

The impression I got was that these people were being treated more like maximum security high risk serial killers who are dangerous even when confined. <p><img src=http://members.home.net/atsila/pictures/malsig3.jpg></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000028><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub77.ezboard.com/utheodanofstaedwall.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Theodan of Staedwall</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 19<br> <font color=#FFFF00>(2/3/02 3:26:31 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub77.ezboard.com/ftallonzektimes4735generaldiscussion.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=27597.topic&index=180>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: This is not meant to be any form of american bashing, k </span><hr size=1> I think the common perception is that American soldiers are taught it is their duty to escape and harass the enemy however they can.<br>
<br>
Sounds like they would fall under maximum security too.  They may be the &quot;good guys&quot; but a well trained marine is more of a threat then a malnourished soldier from a third world country with considerably less training in unarmed combat.<br>
<br>
The real reason they are subjecting them to the treatments the Taliban are getting .... they shame them, they make it impossible for them to return to their fundamentalist brethren because they have been shamed in their religion.<br>
<br>
Simmiler to what the nazi's did by shaving the heads of Jews and tattooing them.  Not saying the US = Nazi Germany, just that these techniques are not new.<br>
<br>
Those prisioner are going to be more inclined to give over information when any chance of reuniting with their brethren has been forcably removed from them.<br>
<br>
Maybe those US marines guarding them really are deathly afraid of those prisioners.  Maybe the Taliban are some super soldier 10x better then a US marine and should be guarded 10x more then any other country should guard a US Marine POW.<br>
<br>
I doubt it, and I think you all know it too.<br>
<br>
Unless you really want to say that a 3rd world grunt is 10x more of a soldier then a US marine.<br>

What about the training of the Taliban?  Are they are more dangerous then a US marine?  For that matter, is one of Bin Laden's &quot;trained&quot; terrorist more dangerous then a US marine?<br>
<br>
Because if it's purely because they are dangerous that opens the door to the expectation that from now on every captured US soldier should be treated the same.<br>
<br>
You can't have the best soldiers in the world and then claim they are all perfect little kittens when taken prisioner.<br>
<br>
Maybe you are saying it is the severity of their crime that means they shouldn't be allowed the rights we expect others to give US soldiers.<br>
<br>
Were the rank and file soldiers of Nazi Germany more or less &quot;evil&quot; then the rank and file of the Taliban?  Nazi Germany was commiting genocide on a HUGE scale, yet when we took their soldiers as prisioners they were still afforded the protection of the Geneva Convention.<br>
<br>
Maybe it's all about the US doesn't expect to have any of their own taken prisioner so there is no longer a need to honour the agreement.<br>
<br>
That kind of short sighted thinking can really bite one in the ass later.  The treatment of the Taliban prisioners is shameful and a black eye on the world stage.<br>
<br>
Take the slightly negative press and coverage you are getting in the states on this issue and multiply that a hundred fold.  That is what the rest of the world sees.  The news coverage in other countries is not looking at this through patriotic rose coloured glasses.<br>
<br>
This is exactly why America gets a bad rap around the world.  Claims of rightousness then disregarding international agreement when it does not suit their personal intrest.  Like I said, the rest of the world doesn't look through the same patriotic rose coloured glasses.<br>
<br>
I'm sure you won't find much disention in &quot;Fortress America&quot;, don't mistake that for the other 15/16ths of the worlds view.<br>

That would be an incorrect statement. U.S. Military members are taught to escape and reveal no information. They are not instructed to 'harrass' anyone while confined.<br>

Please explain their malnutrition, unless of course you are referring to their state of health prior to their capture. They are being well-fed.<br>

That is one heck of an assumption... How exactly are the Prison Guards shaming them? If the prisoners feel shame, than it is their own convictions doing it for them. You are beginning to make some baseless accusations and assumptions. I am more than willing to listen to you or anyone about anything, so long as they have some sort of evidence to go along with these claims.<br>

Or maybe there is cause for worry due to the possiblity of suicidal tendancy?<br>

Gildis,<br>
<br>
Thank you for your answer. That makes sense, and I am in agreement. The Taliban soldiers themselves should be given POW status. My question was directed more towards those who are making claims of physical mistreatment.<br>
<br>
Lias, if you keep making sense, I will have to ban you ;-)<br>
