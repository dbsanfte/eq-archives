How do you justify building your whole paradigm of the world on falacious concepts which form the &quot;post-modern&quot; era as they call it. <br>
<br>
theroy of evolution, freudian theroy, political/social evolution (particularly in regards to democracy/capitolism as being highest form of evolution), all western medical practice, and of course the concept of good and bad (in either a moral or amoral sence).<br>
<br>
All these things have great impact on how we view everything we see, and yet most are outright rediculous (some having been disproven, some stupid from the outset, some disprovable with some thought and research).<br>
<br>
Free thought is not a matter of reaction to some percieved enslavement.  Instead it's a matter of objectively attacking your paradigm at random, and yet it seems that increasingly the only things that are attacked in our belief structure are those things which stand in the way of us erecting monuments to our own greatness; those monuments necessarily are as disgusting as we are.  And yet being a free thinker becomes more popular by the minuet... if only I could manage to fit it into some stylish clothing line for this fall.<br>
<br>
Finally my story for the day:<br>
<br>
Friend's mother was in a book club.  All women in it were well educated and experienced in the world.  One day they were discussing their latest bood, &quot;To Kill a Mockingbird&quot; and they were unable to recall the writer.  Of course my friend's mom finally remembered, but when she revealed the author's name the rest of the club laughed at her.  Finally after some discussion they took a vote; the result of the vote was very wrong,  but the voters all felt quite smug because they voted on an author, different than the one my friend's mother chose.<br>
<br>
Why do I tell this stupid little story?  Because it really happened,  and because it continues to happen daily on a political/cultural, and personal level.  We all use ideas which simply aren't true,  and construct a world around them... the world is equally ficticious becuase our foundation is wrong.  If you want to think freely, realize truth and be unbiased, then you have a long way to go--further than anyone so far has gone because the first thing to attack is yourself (excepting maybe unrecorded monks of various religions who have made such an attack their life). <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000028><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub77.ezboard.com/uastitious.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Astitious</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Griefer of TZT admins</span><br>  Posts: 3481<br> <font color=#FFFF00>(6/28/02 12:58:34 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub77.ezboard.com/ftallonzektimes4735generaldiscussion.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=32750.topic&index=25>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.thespark.com/askjesus/graphics/jesus_3.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: ...</span><hr size=1> Get a clue for once and shut the fuck up, Persequi.

My paradigm of the world can change with facts. I guess if it doesn't have some spooky mysticism, it isn't good enough for you? I could care less if evolution were disproven. I have no emotional attachment to it. I'm interested in the truth and nothing would ever make me except anything in it's place. Why don't I accept creationism? For two reasons.<br>
<br>
1. It's fucking moronic.<br>
2. Everyone advocating it has been out for power and greed.<br>
<br>
I do have a spiritual side but that's personal and it would be silly for me to share it as it has no bearing on reality. I meditate often but I consider that a mental exercise and far removed from superstition.<br>
<br>
I also do not, nor have I ever believed that popular consensus = truth. Truth = truth. Maybe you should study objectivism. I am a free thinker because I am free from any guilt in using reason. Most devout believers are afraid of reason and often attribute thoughts to demons. Anyway done ranting. <p><IMG SRC ="http://astitious.homestead.com/files/Dagarn.jpg"><br>

Considering the crux of your arguement was that I was advocating creationism by saying evolution is proven wrong by science, I will excuse the rest of your post.<br>
<br>
You obviously aren't free thinking.  Because evolution is proven infaliably wrong, you immediately jump to creationism.  You use the fact that creation is mystical to prove that evolution is true.  So, you claim that since one thing is impossible, another must be true, without even stoping to consider that there might be more than 2 sides to a coin.<br>
<br>
I had hopes, but I am disappointed in you.  For that, I withdrawl from the conversation.

<br>
------------------------------------------------------<br>
&quot;Fact: Marijuana &gt; Alcohol.<br>
<br>
Nobody ever died from marijuana. And if it were legalized, it would turn drunken abusive family members into stoned couch potatoes. It would also create many more jobs than alcohol ever could.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;It makes me furious when the Bush administration blames pot smokers for supporting bin Laden when the President need not look beyond his own father. Who is to blame for 9/11? Our politicians.&quot;<br>

I am by no means the most objective person. We all make biased and inaccurate statements, but I find it slightly comical that on one hand in this thread he states how important objectivity and honesty is while making these very same statements in the same discussion in the stretch of about 5 replies.<br>

How is evolution proven infaliably wrong? And even if it were, the argument for creationism would not be strengthened. I merely stated that evolution is the best possible explanation at this time as creationism is moronic. <br>

Alexcia - The Bush (Sr) administration had more to do with Osama bin Landen than any drug user in the U.S.. Bush (sr) was head of the CIA at one time and no doubt had connections during the Reagan years. We all know who put Osama where he is, trained him, and provided funding.<br>

Um would that not be the people who flew the planes into the building?  Although George Bush Sr. was a pilot, I sure didn't see him as a suspect in this crime. <p>Garrot <BR>

<br>
thanks for agreeing zeebo, someone else can see the b.s. quality of his first paragraph.<br>
<br>
<br>
efrim... do you roast them or deep fry them? i like to eat them smoked.<br>
<br>
and i'm not anti pot-legalization. i've smoked my share and would rather like being able to go to the store to pick up a 20 dollar pack of joints for those special occasions. It was just the way he wrote the first paragraph of the article that pissed me off. I drink beer almost every weekend, and guess what? <br>
<br>
i've never hit my wife (other then horseplaying). or my kid (except to discipline, and that's spanking not hitting like the guy is referring to). So basically i just debunked the whole guys article in the first couple of sentences. It shows he is a non-biased author which leaves little credibility to his writing.<br>
<br>
You'd have never guessed i wouldn't mind pot being made legal, but it wasn't the point i was trying to make. Hell if they quit wasting money on &quot;drug wars&quot; concerning weed, slapped a 21 year old age limit on it and put it in quicktrip next to the beer, think of the money our government could make.<br>

If someone is going to take the risk of bringing drugs accross the border, it sure as heck isn't going to be something like pot with it's low profit margin per volume compared to coke.<br>
