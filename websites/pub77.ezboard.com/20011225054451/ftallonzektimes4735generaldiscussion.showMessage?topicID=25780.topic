Tell me this:  What will more cross teaming solve?  Down the road you will only make things worse.  If by some chance the Light Alliance falters (it already has -- due to their own incompetence not cross teaming) even more than it already has it will do no good.  Explain to me why you want to end the last big Team?  Hmmm?  The Dark Team.  The main team who did not cross team.  It makes absolutely no sense at all.  I can understand a one-teaming dark saying they want it to end... but for a cross teamer to ask them to end it... why?  What would YOU gain?  More members for your guild?  (all 4-team guilds)  More cross teamers in general? (Just about everyone non-dark and non-LotU.)<br>
<br>
*shrug*  I just find it strange.  It will solve nothing in the long run.  It will only make things worse.  You think becoming 4 team will make things less blue?  Who are you trying to fool?  It must be yourself, because it isn't fooling me.  Do you honestly think that you will break up friendships that are already formed having friends fight friends?  Do you know how much I have to deal with this problem with the Liberation?  Do you have any idea how many members leave because their friend decided to make an Elf or a Human?<br>
<br>
Fools!  All of you!  You will accomplish nothing.  It will only make things more blue.  It will kill off what little PvP is left.  You think by making things &quot;Guild Vs. Guild&quot; will help?  How long till alliances form?  Hmmm?  Oh, and believe me... they will form.  Pretty soon you will see one big huge light alliance that includes darks.  This server will look like Rallos Zek.  Where their are guilds designed to hunt down and kill anyone who even DARES attempt to PK.<br>
<br>
*shakes head in disgust*<br>
The only way to solve these problems is if more people join and form one team guilds that are aggressive.  It is the only way you can destroy the light alliance.  The only way you can ensure that alliances between teams are not formed.  It is the ONLY way you can ensure that PvP stays alive.<br>
<br>
However, I know many of you will not choose this road.  Mostly because you are weak.  You want to choose the easy way out, instead of standing up for what is right, instead of fighting for what SHOULD BE yours.  You are weak bluebies.  You may deny it all you want, but in the end it is true.  <br>
<br>
And before PDM and all those that kiss their ass (most people here) post saying &quot;PDM IS NOT BLUE!!!2111`~~``!@@1&quot;  I respond with this:  No, PDM is not blue... currently.  However if the majority of people on the server begin to become 4-teamers they will eventually slip into blueness, unless they KOS every other guild.  Which won't happen.  Eventually rival guilds will begin to show up.  Guilds that may or may not be aligned with each other, but never-the-less they will be against PDM.  You will have PDM members who have friends within those guilds, who will not want to kill them, and will want to become allies with that guild.  You will have PDM members wanting to do raids with that guild, you may even have PDM members joining with that guild to do a raid.  Eventually their will be some type of an alliance formed by the members of PDM.  Perhaps a non-spoken alliance, but an alliance by the members none-the-less.  Just imagine the internal conflict that will arise when a PDM member attacks another PDM members friend.  Imagine the pressure PDM will have if one of those members threatens to leave (for the sake of argument lets say it is someone like Gylen), this will eventually force the alliance to officially form.<br>
<br>
Lets assume now, that PDM is able to stick to their guns and keep their guild fighting against everyone else.  Rival guilds will form, they may or not be allied.  PDM may start to lose members to those guilds.  (Go back up and read the thing about friends.)  PDM's moral will begin to decline, and you will see a domino effect of friends going to join friends in GuildX.  And if you lose a important member, may the gods help you, moral will come crashing down and you will see tons of members who looked up to that member flocking behind him/her.<br>
<br>
For the above reasons that is why 4 Team guilds are doomed to fail to save the server.  Because guilds compete to be the best guild, and do their best to draw members.  You may see similar struggles with your own guilds currently.  Lights may see it with other Light Guilds.  (Think of all the lighties going to join Heritage and DO, etc.)  Darks may see it with other Dark Guilds... This is common sense.<br>
<br>
In the end you eventually become a melding pot.  Because everyone got shifted around so much everyone has a friend here, and a friend there... causing all sorts of problems.  This will result to blueness, and again... this is why you will FAIL.<br>
<br>
And, once again, this is why One Teaming is the ONLY solution to permanently destroy the Light Alliance and keeping PvP on the server.  So for all of you thinking that you can pull it off by cross teaming.  Go ahead and try, but mark my words... a year from now you will be reaping the fruits of what you have sown.  And for those of you who will join cross teaming guilds because you want the easy way out, or you want loot, then I spit in your face and wish you would get the hell off Tallon Zek you cheapen it with your presence. <p><CENTER>

<BR>
They said we'd never get past level 20, nor get out of Steamfont, and we did.<BR>
<BR>
They said we'd never be able to hit 30, as well. On April 8th, 2001, we had a 2+ hour raid in Neriak Commons, the heart of the Dark Elf city.<BR>

Although PDM are Yarens ahead of anybody atm, to have 2 guilds with the power to take over what zones they want (1 guild owning Sebilis is just sick btw) would invigorate this server. Hell 3 or 4 guilds would be even better.<br>
<br>
Having 1 guild pound the crap out of everyone and win 100% of the time even gets boring for that guild, I would imagine.<br>

<br>
You talk about facts, but they’re about as hard-coded as the server is.  Your opinions are not facts.  They’re YOUR OPINIONS.<br>
<br>
In your original post you talk about how the server is going to progress like you’re @#%$ Nostradamus, and while you may be correct you make the mistake of saying (paraphrase) “omgomgomgomgomg that’s so wrong.”  Ever considered that maybe that’s  the way that people want this server to go?  I’m not saying that I agree with it, or that you’re even correct, but you’ve got to get past the idea that what *you* want is what *other* people want.  <br>
<br>
You’re one person out of several thousand on this server.  Verant has implemented a rules set that allow for the possibility of cross-teaming.  Some people choose that route.  That doesn’t make them wrong for doing so, and pretending that they are would be about as ridiculously weak as me calling you a bluebie for one-teaming.  Different strokes for different folks.  Posting this kind of crap is like when someone shows up at my door trying to get me to change religions.  Wtf?  *slam door*<br>
<br>
Also, cross teaming isn’t an exploit, I don’t know where you came up with that one.  You call us all cheaters for crossteaming… ok, so, people that use different strategies than you do are cheaters?  That’s about as ridiculous as Maxem saying he won’t scoot from people that use golem wands (yes that happened).<br>
<br>
As far as Pandemonium being loot whores, and the light alliance getting stronger…. Heh.  You want to see ToT4?  Put SotG on one side of Iceclad, and put DO on the other.  Now plop Lozidal down in between them.  Watch the ensuing action, and then tell me what you think about a) loot whores and b) the light alliance.<br>
<br>
I hope that LOTU does continue to exist on TZ.  I even hope that they thrive, they certainly made leveling up Kylt in LOIO more enjoyable.  But please, please, keep your opinions of the way I should play to yourself.<br>

<br>
There is absolutely no point to a light alliance when the dark team is no longer a threat to non-dark team players whatsoever. Pandemonium is successful because they are self sufficient, more guilds like this who have decent member levels and organisation and you will see more PvP on high level TZ.<br>

For example he came up with the hypothesis that when the universe reached the end everything would revert and time would go backward. He claimed that we would live our lives a 2nd time backwards. We would un-die, and in the end be un-born, however this was incorrect. He made what was actually a simple mistake. You see the model he used for the universe had set boundries, it was too simple. <br>
<br>
When the science world proved him wrong he realized his mistake he took it with stride and admitted his mistake, but they didn't run around saying &quot;Omg! Stephen Hawking goofed he must me dumb.&quot;<br>
<br>
K? Room for thought? Maybe? <p>Balaff Dishwasher<BR>

<br>
as for the server going 4-team..well it's too early to tell,and if the transaction does take place, then certainly it won't be in an instant, who know tho..i have always been in vehement protest of the big sin of X-teaming..but i've known so many who have gone to pdm, seen the success of those who do, and seen the realisation that those who do aren't necessarily all assholes (hell, everyone in there can't be a Tzuten can they?)<br>
<br>
what's my stance on this?  i'm not too sure, most likely i will go with those i am friends with do..i play the game for fun, not to be a chore...and i will pk lights even if i do 4 team <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#00000F><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub77.ezboard.com/uvanayr.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Vanayr</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 649<br> <font color=#FFFF00>(12/10/01 11:15:25 pm)</font><br>     <br>Community Supporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: .</span><hr size=1> Good lord, where is a link to that &quot;Welcome to last week!&quot; pic when I need it?<br>

Gratz Merala, you not only got on the dead horse and beat it but proceeded to @#%$ it up the ass and then kick in the mouth a few times for not licking your nuts while it put out.<br>
<br>
The anti pdm/blubie/lootwhore torch has been passed around on tzt more times than a goatskin flask at a blue oyster cult show, and unfortunately, it's starting to taste like @#%$.<br>
<br>
Here are some facts for you:<br>
<br>
1 - PDM is here, and were not going anywhere.<br>
2 - To play the high end game (no, not mistmore) you need people who know what the @#%$ they are doing<br>
3 - To keep those zones on this server, you have to know how to PvP<br>
4 - None of us really care what you think of us, but this is sure entertaining to read.<br>
<br>
Now, let’s press on shall we?<br>
<br>
I can just see you shaking your fist at the monitor, keys taping so hard they echo down the hallway as you type your post.  Your like Jerry McGuire writing his opus.<br>
<br>
I hope you and the fish are happy cause that’s all that cares atm.  Peg, gratz man.  You’re the goldfish...<br>
<br>
4 teaming will not &quot;save the server&quot; nor will it kill the &quot;light alliance&quot;.  This server is about playing the game, not playing the way LotU wants us to think they are &quot;hard&quot; for leveling up a 12-17 pk twink and backstabing people in CB trains.  LotU is coming along well, and the fungi wearing twinks in your guild with seb cloaking dirks are a real chalange to level.<br>
<br>
Hey, look at it this way.  You have people that are an epic encounter for a small guild in GFay... lol<br>
<br>
Get some perspective folks.<br>
<br>
We will now return you to PDM's regularly scheduled server ownage. <p><BR>

What direction has this thread taken? It had nothing to do with PDM (sure, I mentioned them but it wasn't about them) and now that is all there is...<br>
<br>
Fine. The thread is too far gone to be fixed, so if you want this thread to be about PDM? So be it. <br>
<br>
It is obvious to me that PDM is a guild that needs to have attention constantly. Are you attention starved in real life? You act as if everything you do has major implications on the server, as if it is some major accomplishment. Ohhhh. Wow! PDM has just killed another Uber Mob. Everyone drop to their knees, and tell them how great they are! <br>
<br>
I wonder what would happen to your guild if no one paid any attention. There would probably be a mass suicide of PDM members. I can see it now... PDM members meet in Real Life in some secluded place in Iowa like some Religious Cult and all drink poisoned Cool Aid. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :lol --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/laugh.gif ALT=":lol"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
I hope you realize that everything you do is being done on Blue Servers. And they are doing it just like you did it.<br>
<br>
Show me a Dark Guild that kills a Uber Mob and I will give them congrats. Show me a Human Guild, Elven Guild, or Short Guild who does a Uber Mob and I will give them congrats as well. You know why? Because they did not turn their backs on their teammates. Because they did something that isn't normally done / has never been done before. <br>
<br>
No, I don't fault you for cross teaming. I can careless. It doesn't effect me that much. Play however you like. But don't come to TZT acting like you are hot @#%$ because you cross team. You aren't.<br>
<br>
I would enjoy seeing your guild moved to a blue server for a month. I would enjoy watching you all go to their message boards and brag. You know why? Because they wouldn't care. They would pay you as much mind as we pay to the Darkstar Sisterhood.<br>
<br>
Yes, you have good leadership. I never said you didn't. Yes, you have SOME skilled members. But you also have the largest guild on the server as well as (estimating) 80% of the level 60 people. If a guild your size couldn't get something accomplished you would be a true clusterfuck.<br>
<br>
But on the note of leadership -- that isn't why people join your guild. People join your guild for the following reasons:<br>
1. So they can get high level loot.<br>
2. So they don't have to worry about you killing them.<br>
3. Did I mention loot?<br>
<br>
Someone tell me why I am going to start an argument with PDM? It is pointless. It will just go around and around. Not to mention 98% of this board kisses PDM's ass. Either because they have friends in the guild (don't want to upset them), scared shitless of them (<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :rolleyes --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/eyes.gif ALT=":rolleyes"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> ), or are members of the guild themselves.<br>
<br>
So in closing... well there is no closing. Except for this:<br>

They said we'd never get past level 20, nor get out of Steamfont, and we did.<BR>

They said we'd never be able to hit 30, as well. On April 8th, 2001, we had a 2+ hour raid in Neriak Commons, the heart of the Dark Elf city.<BR>

<br>
Instead I'd just like to highlight something you said really quick:<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> That is because Darks have developed &quot;safe&quot; zones in which they attempt to hide and gain experience in piece. It is good and bad at the same time. As a team they have deteriorated<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Regardless of the truth of the matter asserted, who the @#%$ are you to pass judgement?  Does your team have something to show that puts you above them? Does your &quot;team&quot; have some great leadership that the dark team doesn't?  Who deteriorated? The Dark team? How about LotU? Where's Quintain? Where's Ivvy? Where's Totenkopf? <br>
<br>

<br>
The darkstar sisterhood gets paid more mind than Liberation of the Underfoot sir.  And shall we compare the &quot;mind&quot; paid to the &quot;deteriorating&quot; guilds with the mind paid to your long-dead and-now-rotting guild?<br>

<br>
I like PDM in away, they represented TZ great in ToT3. Whenever I meet a PDM in game they're usually really nice or whatever. I've been epic rezzed quite a few times by PDM Clerics, and in other times where odds were stacked far against me in PvP matches PDM has helped me out (especially Lenard, thx Lenny).<br>
<br>
Plus PDM doesn't hide behind xteaming by claiming lighty rp'ing.<br>
<br>
Some members on PDM are somewhat addicted to attention, but that can't reflect the whole guild.<br>
<br>
PDM prolly won't vanish in my playing time, someday I'll prolly get in range to some of them (barely I assume). Then again maybe not, but if so I will fight them just as I fought anyone else.<br>
<br>
PDM has some great people, they also have some shitpricks, just like any guild.<br>
<br>
On the negative for PDM they tend to over-react a bit and sometimes come off as hypocrits. This thread wasn't about them, but they made it about them, and no matter how many times they kept saying they didn't care about Melara's opionion they had 5 posts from PDM members retorting any of Melara's opinions.<br>
<br>
Overall I like PDM okay, beats all those uber-blue guilds IMO at least /shrug.<br>
<br>
I have the feeling I'll get flamed somehoe for posting this, but doesn't really matter to me. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :\ --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/ohwell.gif ALT=":\"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p>Balaff Dishwasher<BR>

I think Rummol summed this up perfectly, thx info~<br>
<br>
EDIT:  And before you call me a PDM asskissing bitch, let me tell you I am as KOS as everyone else, I hunt them down when I see them in zone (yes, I die, shut up), and I'm not an app nor can I ever see myself being one, I haven't the cajones for it, and the majority of my friends are non-PDM.  I would have a hard time KOSing them all, but that's my deal.  Most (NOT all) PDM members joined to be with friends who were already guilded, what fun is a game such as EQ if you can't be with your friends?  And who gives a damn if some self rightious disenfranchised pompous ass gnome doesn't think that it's &quot;right&quot;?
