If you wish to know something of the ideals we follow, then read on...<br>

<br>
<font color=red><i>As you walk down the twisting corridor it ends abruptly at a single door. You slowly turn the handle and before you is a room with no furniture of any kind. The only thing visible is a detailed ornate tapestry that adorns the entire far wall. It is covered with scenes of battle and carnage mixed with those of dark worship and sacrifice. Upon peering closer you see the images are actually made of different colored text. With morbid curiosity you begin to read the script...</i></font><br>
<br>
<b><u>The Shadow Guard Charter and Rules</u></b><br>
The guild's primary function is to role-play evil in a manner constructive to the enhancement of the role-playing environment in Norrath. This includes slaying the lesser races and to work against them constantly and participating in the guild events of the Shadow Guard and our allies. It is the aim of this guild to give the "good" guilds of Norrath an evil to strive against. For those interested, please keep in mind that your faction with many of the "good" races will be affected adversely. We feel this is one of the points to playing evil.<br>
<br>
Secondly, the guild is sworn to protect the Kingdom Of Neriak and Nektulos Forest from foreign intrusion. This also includes the protection of the cities of Grobb, Oggok, Cabilis, and the Danak Shipyard as per our alliance with the evil races of these areas. <br>
<br>
Finally, the Shadow Guard exists to give like-minded players, whose role-playing is of a high caliber, others with whom to build camaraderie and friendship. <br>
<br>
<b><u>Membership</u></b><br>
Membership is open to any of the four evil races who is interested in our guild, who is a role-player, role-plays well, and agrees with our four statutes listed below in our rules. <br>
<br>
<br>
<u><b>How to become a Member of the Shadow Guard</u></b><br>
Anyone interested in joining our guild is instructed to seek out our members and role-play with them. We are always watching for others who will prove worthy of taking up our banner and word will quickly spread among the guild of those who we are observing. If you abide by our strictures and your role-playing impresses us you may be invited to a guild event or sought out by an officer. The officer may just interview you or charge you with a small quest or direct you to hunt and journey with members of our order that are of similar level.<br>
<br>
It is required that all potential members be of the 16th rank or greater before they are inducted. This does not mean that those of less than the 16th rank that are interested cannot interact with us and become known to the Shadow Guard. If you do not quite meet our minimum level requirement yet, fear not! Show us who your character is anyway, show us that you uphold the ideals of this organization you wish to join. Thus, when you do attain the 16th order in your chosen profession, you can be inducted immediately. <br>
<br>
At such a time that you are approved by the officers and the guild votes yay, then you will meet with Lord K'Kidrak or another member of the Primary Triumvirate and be inducted in the next ceremony we hold. The key is to be patient. Prove your diligence and sincerity in wanting to be part of what we stand for. We like to get to know your character some before you become part of our guild.<br>
<br>
Best of luck, and may darkness cover you! <br>
<br>
<u><b>Rules of the Shadow Guard</u></b><br>
<br>
Each player must keep in mind that their actions now reflect upon all of us. Everything you do positive or negative is now attributed to the Shadow Guard. <br>
<br>
Understand that this is an evil guild but it is also a role-playing guild. One, in which, we may be taunting the enemy, foiling their plans, stalking and slaying them and all the while congratulating each other ooc on some great role-playing. <br>
<br>
For that to happen we need to maintain high ethical gaming standards and these will be enforced. One of our purposes it to role-play evil in a way conducive to an enjoyable role-playing environment for all. In doing that, we shall lead by example and try to be a role-model for others to emulate.<br>
<br>
The rules we follow: <br>
<br>
1. There shall be no use of profanity. <br>
<br>
2. Training any creatures or guards upon other characters is strictly forbidden. <br>
<br>
3. Corpse camping is forbidden. You must allow the deceased to loot their corpse and leave the area safely. If they do not leave the area immediately after gathering their belongings, you are free to hunt them again. This also applies to those on a corpse run, unless they act aggressively and initiate confrontation leave them be. If they initiate a conflict, then their protection is null and you may slay them at will.<br>
<br>
4. No zone line camping. This refers to the practice of waiting at a zone point so that you can attack your enemy for several seconds before they completely zone. <br>
<br>
5. No "lameness" of any sort will be tolerated. If the Council is informed that a Shadow Guardian was behaving in a less than honorable manner, the matter will be investigated and appropriate action will be taken. <br>
<br>
6. No crossteaming will be allowed among the Shadow Guard. This refers to the casual joining of forces with one of our sworn enemies. Note, that this is also the be moderated and used in conjunction with item 2 below. <br>
<br>
7. When dealing with irksome players, do not use the /ooc and /shout channels for arguing or shouting matches. Several players exist on the server for no other reason than to cause headaches for others. Spamming the text box will most likely not sway the guilty party and it won't win you any supporters. Once again, we strive to set an example for other players and the best solution is often to just walk away. <br>
<br>
Things we wish to encourage among our members: <br>
<br>
1. Staying IC (In character) as much as possible. <br>
<br>
2. Respect and Courtesy OOC (Out of Character) Things like helping someone retrieve their body even if your character might not. <br>
<br>
3. To be a Shadow Guardian means to swear loyalty to your brothers and sisters of the guild before all others. One way we can show that is to aid each other in acquiring many of those much sought after items that make survival so much easier. If you get an extra item, see if any guild members will buy it from you before selling it outside the guild. If you can afford to, give a no longer used item to a lower ranking guild member. Hand me downs are very much appreciated by many who would have spent hours trying to obtain them otherwise. Group together to obtain your goals. If the guild comes together to help you get something you are expected to come together when someone else needs help. The more teamwork we have the better off we all will be. <br>
<br>
4. Group with others not of the Shadow Guard as well! The only way that the other denizens of Norrath will come to know us and what it is we stand for is if you group with them. We are not here to be reclusive and only group internally. <br>
<br>
5. Stopping to role-play often with anyone who wishes to role-play with you. This is very important for your stopping and role-playing with someone many times will be their only impression of us so make it a good one. <br>
<br>
6. Helping out those Tier'Dal, Ogres, Trolls, and Iksar much younger and less experienced. This usually means stepping in and saving them if they are about to die or guiding them to their guild hall, etc. It might not seem much to us, especially if you are higher level but those little actions mean a lot when you are low and just starting. As Shadow Guardians we must seek to care for our people. Let us let that reflect in our role-playing.<br>
<br>
7) Slow down...don't be in such a rush. Enjoy the game! <p><font size=4 color=red><i>
