I'm sure Bamtin was a good guy and you should stop using him as a way to attack Tulli and stir up trouble. I'm sure he would resent being used as a pawn to win a little war on TZT. <p><IMG SRC ="http://astitious.homestead.com/files/Dagarn.jpg"><br>

--Astitious<br>
<br>
As I've said before, Astitious, everyone on this board writes a huge amount of spinned bullshi.t, and this is just another example.  Say what you'd like about what I write or what anyone else writes, but I think I've brought up Bamtin only when Tulli asked why I didn't like him as well as now, which is in response to some very offensive trash written by Elvenstar and Rummol.  I've no problems with people asking others who Bamtin was, how he died, whatever, but I have a big problem with people like Elvenstar, Rummol, and Tulli saying the things they're saying.  It's a lack of basic respect for human life that, were the tables turned, would have these people up in arms and typing furiously.  If people can't show a basic respect for the dead, then I'll use whatever means I have at my disposal to make sure that they do.<br>
<br>
&quot;There have been lots of people in my life who have died in the past year, to think that bamtin is Mahatma ghandi and everyone should know and respect his legacy is just being cenile.<br>
<br>
To add: Id like to think tulli was banned for giving RL threats, accompanied with being an indecent human being. <br>
<br>
As for what rummol said, or anyone else &quot;pissing on bamtin's legacy&quot;, It's opinion and whatever else it derives from. Personally, I wouldn't say that about someone who died, especially someone who was a good guy, but everyone is entitled to their opinion. For all you know, bamtin could have slept with Rummol's hot spanish girlfriend before he died. It's not fair, and incredibly biased to ban people just because you have a THA admin (even though she's a sweetypie ;p).&quot;<br>
<br>
--Aaeni<br>
<br>
First off, I spoke to the admins in general, not one particular admin, and your accusation of bias is in pretty poor taste (but where else can you make such baseless accusations and be looked upon as normal, Aaeni?).  Second, I think we can all safely assume that Bamtin didn't sleep with Rummol's girlfriend.  Third, I don't think that anyone has said that Bamtin was Mahatma Ghandi, and whether or not he was is completely beside the point; I've already said that I would've written the exact same letter were it about Rummol or Elvenstar, and I meant it.  Gal said that Tulli was banned because of what he wrote about Bamtin; I'm asking for the same rules to be applied across the board.<br>
<br>
&quot;Actually, Tulli was banned for what is a somewhat longstanding series of warnings. It wasn't just as simple as banning him over remarks about Bamtin. He has been warned dozens of times for different things in the past few months and he continues to push the limits.&quot;<br>
<br>
--Alexcia<br>
<br>
Yes, I understand that, Alex, but according to Gal, he was finally banned because of what he wrote about Bamtin.  If this is true, then apply warnings accordingly.  What Elvenstar and Rummol wrote is as offensive and full of bullshit as what Tulli wrote.  If you think that their conduct is any different and doesn't warrant a banning or warning, please explain why.<br>
<br>
&quot;May I bring this and many other fine jewels attention to the admins, since Sumi is trying so hard to take a high horse without an ass to sit on.&quot;<br>
<br>
--Ionic<br>
<br>
Hey Ionic, nice try, but cutting and pasting my message from  Rummol's thread just proves the point further.<br>
<br>
&quot;Weren't you a moderator on this board for a short while before you got removed because you were a biased little @#%$ head living out your insecurities on this board trying to dictate what people can write. Go back to your oh so great &quot;real life&quot;. It sure sounds fun from what I know and keep in mind that I tend to get the last laugh in because I'm smarter than any of the fucks posting on here.&quot;<br>
<br>
--Rummol<br>
<br>
Threatened much lately, Rummol?  No, I was never a moderator on TZT.  You may not post about your friends IRL (if you actually have any outside of EQ), but if you had a basic amount of human decency, you would respect the dead.  Is that too much to ask?  RESPECT THE DEAD.<br>
<br>
&quot;The reason I made the decision to ban him was he had been warned previously about his behavior... and frankly I think bringing up Bamtin and being disrespectful to his memory once again was just stepping over the line.&quot;<br>
<br>
--Galianine, in &quot;Tulli's Banning&quot; post.<br>
<br>
If you are so de-evolved that you feel the need to write shi.t about a dead person, just don't post.  It's offensive and it's one thing--just one thing--that the people of TZT don't need to read.<br>

Tulli was in fact given not one but several warnings about his behavior and actions on TZT. Other people have also been issued warnings as well for similar offenses. <br>
<br>
Tulli was banned by me for two reasons... threatening people with RL threats and insulting Bamtin's memory, as well as knowing that he had received several warnings already about those very same issues. <br>
<br>
No one ever said that Tulli was going to be permenantly banned from this board... in fact I have been talking to him via email. I will be reinstating Tulli's priviledges this week... there is no rules that he must follow... he has freedom to speak as he wishes. I only suggested that freedom of speech comes with responsibility.. the responsibility to treat others with respect and decency.<br>
<br>
I'm surprised that you have taken up Tulli's cause Sumi... but I admire your vigilent monitoring of the rules here. Those who call us nazi admins are far from the truth. Rarely is anyone banned unless its for trade forum violations.. in fact this is the first time Ive banned someone for anything that was not trade related. So much for being power hungry<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
Being an admin is a responsibility.. its like walking along a narrow ledge... no matter which side you fall off on when it comes to making a decision... half of the community will support you and half will flame you (witness the various Tulli threads). There is no way to keep everyone content.. some people want the board moderated more vigilently and all non-related topics deleted... some want no monitoring at all. As admin I do not operate in a vacuum but try to weigh the needs of everyone involved as I make decisions.<br>
<br>
I try to admin as fairly as I can.. and yes there is some margin for interpretation. The world is not black/white even though we wish it so. There are many values of grey. I do feel though that I am open to feedback and suggestions from the community of TZ... for it is my community also. I'm glad that people feel they can discuss our differences freely here. I do read them and take them into consideration... unlike the Nazi reputation <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
Tulli will be back this week for those who have been following this closely. What path he chooses when he returns is his to decide. <br>

If you're going to issue a temporary banning because of what Tulli did, then you should either ban or warn the two people quoted at the beginning of this thread, or else state why their behavior is perfectly acceptable while Tulli's was not.<br>
