We accept all classes within those races who are 10+ in level.<br><br>Our rules are as follows:<br>1.  No corpse camping.<br>2.  No bind rushing.<br>3.  No experience killing.<br>(Exception to the first three rules:  If someone has done this to you, then you should do your best to collect proof, then you have the right to return the favor in kind.  This is considered 'Eye for an Eye' and is condoned by the Liberation.  Members who disagree with this do not have to participate but must realize that other members will.)<br>4.  Must obey the guilds officers and leader.<br>5.  Must never group with a tall for the purpose of gaining experience.  (This excludes ports and binds.)<br>6.  Must not 'smack talk' in shouts.  (Exception to this is smack talking in good humor.  For example saying: 'Elves are the weakest race on Norrath and will be destroyed!' is considered good humor whereas 'Elves are nothing but fags that like to get @#%$ up the ass' is not.)<br>7.  Must not beg for items or money.  Asking for assistance is fine, but doing it constantly WILL get you removed without any questions asked.<br><br>If you agree to the above rules and are interested then you may follow this link:<br><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://pub22.ezboard.com/fliberationoftheunderfootfrm5">pub22.ezboard.com/fliberationoftheunderfootfrm5</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--><br><br>Click on &quot;New Topic&quot; and enter in the following information:<br>Name:<br>Level:<br>Class:<br>Race:<br>E-mail:<br>Time Zone:<br><br>Then answer these questions in the same post:<br>Where did you find out about the guild?<br>Explain what you think LotU is about.<br>What do you wish to contribute to our guild?<br>What times do you normally play?<br>How many hours do you estimate you play per-week?<br>Is this an alternate or main character?<br><br><br>Once you have completed that click &quot;Add Post&quot;, and someone (Hookk more than likely) will do their best to see that you are processed and added to the guild.  <br><br>Here are a list of officers:<br>Hookk<br>Pheelmi<br>Melara<br>Shaitans<br>Phaon (can port)<br>Saqqara<br>Zapdaboom (can port)<br>Lilcori<br>Balaff<br>Orffis<br>-------------<br><br><br>Now.  For my part of this post where I tell you more about the guild.<br><br>You may be asking yourself:  <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>  &quot;What can the Liberation of the Underfoot offer me that other guilds cannot?&quot;</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>The Liberation can offer you far more than any other guild on Norrath.  We offer friendship, family, and being apart of a greater cause.  You will find no other guild in EverQuest as devoted and as close knit than the Liberation.  We <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i>  ARE</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> family.  We celebrate our success together, failures together, and our lives together.  We die for each other, cry for each other, and work hard to see that each other are successful in their hopes and dreams.  It is impossible to find another guild that is as good as we are.<br><br>However.  It comes with a price tag.  The Liberation of the Underfoot can only depend on each other.  If you join us you <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i>  will</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> become part of the family, because you can depend on no one else.  If you are a Melee, Cleric, or another class that has trouble soloing you may find this guild to be extremely difficult.  It will be frustrating but as others can attest, it isn't impossible.  You will often find yourself looking for a group but discover there is none to be found.  The Liberation works hard to try and correct this problem, but it is not an easy task.  Our suggestion to you is:  Actively seek out shorts that are not part of the guild, but are in your level range.  Attempt to get them to join our cause.  Hopefully by doing this you will have a small group of people to group with when you log on.  <br><br>Another question you may be asking yourself:  <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>  &quot;How many members does the Liberation currently have?&quot;</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>Well it is impossible to give an exact number.  However a good estimate would be around 50 active members.  You must remember that our guild is a guild of extreme difficulty.  Many people find that it is too difficult and decide to leave.  This is fine, but the question is:  Can you handle it?  This is a question that can only be answered though experience.<br><br><br>Another question frequently asked:  <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>  &quot;Is the Liberation of the Underfoot just a PK guild?&quot;</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->  The answer to that is a resounding &quot;NO&quot;.  We are far more than just a PK guild.  We are attempting to do our best to strengthen the short team and make them proud.  We accomplish this through helping non-guilded shorts and PvE and PvP accomplishments.  We are constantly doing our best to improve grouping skills and techniques for PvE accomplishments.  We have at least one PvE raid per week, which is advertised on our message board.  Balaff is our raid coordinator.<br><br>Do you have questions not listed above?  Post them here, and they will be added.<br><br>In closing the Liberation is one of the most unique and successful guilds on Tallon Zek.  Many people said we would never make it, but almost two years of success has proved them wrong.  We have faced many challenges that the normal player could never dream of, and have over come each obstacle we have faced.  Nothing can hold the Liberation down or back from success, and you can guarantee that we will be around for years to come. <p><CENTER><IMG SRC="http://images.freepichosting.com/2001-11-11-5-5-53-6936.gif"><BR><IMG SRC="http://images.freepichosting.com/2001-11-11-5-5-53-1224.gif"><BR>No one said One Teamin' was easy.<BR><BR></CENTER><B>-~-</B><BR>ALL HAIL THE LIBERATION OF THE UNDERFOOT!<BR><BR>Visit our message boards at: <A HREF="http://pub22.ezboard.com/bliberationoftheunderfoot">http://pub22.ezboard.com/bliberationoftheunderfoot</A><BR>Stop by and say hello!<BR>  (Currently has no pop-up adds and runs allot faster than TZT. :p)</p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub77.ezboard.com/umelaratz.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Melara TZ</A> at: 12/17/01 5:38:42 am<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000028><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub77.ezboard.com/umelaratz.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Melara TZ</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 1315<br> <font color=#FFFF00>(12/17/01 5:49:51 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub77.ezboard.com/ftallonzektimes4735guildsoftallonzek.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=483.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Liberation of the Underfoot (CURRENT)</span><hr size=1> bump <p><CENTER><IMG SRC="http://images.freepichosting.com/2001-11-11-5-5-53-6936.gif"><BR><IMG SRC="http://images.freepichosting.com/2001-11-11-5-5-53-1224.gif"><BR>No one said One Teamin' was easy.<BR><BR></CENTER><B>-~-</B><BR>ALL HAIL THE LIBERATION OF THE UNDERFOOT!<BR><BR>Visit our message boards at: <A HREF="http://pub22.ezboard.com/bliberationoftheunderfoot">http://pub22.ezboard.com/bliberationoftheunderfoot</A><BR>Stop by and say hello!<BR>  (Currently has no pop-up adds and runs allot faster than TZT. :p)</p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#00000F><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub77.ezboard.com/ustabaronitz.showPublicProfile?language=EN>StabaroniTZ</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 17<br> <font color=#FFFF00>(12/17/01 4:50:41 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub77.ezboard.com/ftallonzektimes4735guildsoftallonzek.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=483.topic&index=2>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Liberation of the Underfoot (CURRENT)</span><hr size=1>  no exp killing? lol maybe you should have a lil talk with phaon about snaring people who are ktiting dwarves in bb <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000028><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub77.ezboard.com/ubalaffdishwasher.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Balaff Dishwasher</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>133t c4st3r k!113r</span><br>  Posts: 658<br> <font color=#FFFF00>(12/17/01 5:13:49 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub77.ezboard.com/ftallonzektimes4735guildsoftallonzek.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=483.topic&index=3>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Liberation of the Underfoot (CURRENT)</span><hr size=1> Bah, I've been there with Phaon helping him kill dorf campers when he snares dorf kiters.

If I am wrong, you may correct me.<br><br>Answer me this:  Do you honestly expect someone NOT to snare a Druid in Wolf Form?  Snare is a very effective spell in combat, as I'm sure you know.  Not snaring a Druid in Wolf Form could be a mistake, as he/she has the ability to escape quickly.<br><br>Kiting Dwarves is another matter.  You were in Butcherblock, a short controlled zone, and on top of it all you were killing Dwarves a Short Race.  Did you honestly think that a Liberation member would stand idly by as you butchered his/her kin?  I don't think so.<br><br>In closing let me make something clear:  Snaring someone is not exp killing.  Experince killing is YOU losing experince while in combat with a guild member.  And there are two types of Exp killing intentional and un-intentional.  Intentional would be a LotU member snaring you while kiting and making SURE you died TO THE DWARVES.  Un-intentional would be you fighting a LotU and agroing a mob then dying to it during the fight.  The first is punishable and the second isn't.  Each case is looked at by the officers and delt with as we see fit.  (Which is far more than you can say for most other guilds.) <p><CENTER><IMG SRC="http://images.freepichosting.com/2001-11-11-5-5-53-6936.gif"><BR><IMG SRC="http://images.freepichosting.com/2001-11-11-5-5-53-1224.gif"><BR>No one said One Teamin' was easy.<BR><BR></CENTER><B>-~-</B><BR>ALL HAIL THE LIBERATION OF THE UNDERFOOT!<BR><BR>Visit our message boards at: <A HREF="http://pub22.ezboard.com/bliberationoftheunderfoot">http://pub22.ezboard.com/bliberationoftheunderfoot</A><BR>Stop by and say hello!<BR>  (Currently has no pop-up adds and runs allot faster than TZT. :p)</p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000028><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub77.ezboard.com/ustabaronitz.showPublicProfile?language=EN>StabaroniTZ</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 18<br> <font color=#FFFF00>(12/22/01 3:52:27 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub77.ezboard.com/ftallonzektimes4735guildsoftallonzek.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=483.topic&index=5>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> ....</span><hr size=1>  So ure saying you do promote exp killing?
