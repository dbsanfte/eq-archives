You people complain about what we do, personally I have never CCed anyone or XP killed anyone, and yet people have tried to xp kill me on many occaisions some of the people really don't even hate me, just the guild in general, also people have threatened to CC guildmates.<br>
Everyone posting here so far are people who are mad at us, but every post is about what we have done to you people no one comments on how a lot of it (nearly everything I have taken part in myself) is reciprocation (sp?) for what people are doing to us!<br>
Just because we are a pk guild everybody hates us, it's a freaking pk server! Yes we x-team so I can understand some pure light guilds hating us. I just wonder if you people ever considered that your reaction to us might be what promts us to act against you.<br>
And you people talking about us having no class, and being immature, explain to me what we do that is so much less mature than the person who shouts Avengers of the Kilt s0x0rs. You only complain about us because you happened to encounter us, there are just as many immature people outside our guild as inside it, you people yourselves would never admit that you could do someting immature you are so egotistical that you look down on anyone who doesn't agree with you and call us immature!<br>
On this very thread someone claimed we were cross dressers! and WE are the immature ones??? Besides making fun of kilts would be insulting to all the barbarians in EQ and a whole lot of scottish people, but no, it doesn't matter about them. Just as long as you insult us it doesn't matter who you offend, great show of class and maturity there!<br>
You people are so hypocritical, you only see what you want to see, you don't think before you act you criticize people for having differing ideas and points of view.<br>

Yes, I was a bit immature. Forgive me.<br>
<br>
And yes, every guild has at least one lamer, but what frustrates me is that all the ones in your guild I have run into so far are extremely lame. Daminoth, Aranea (hi elf chanter, dont remember how to spell her name exactly) and some others are very pathetic. If you guys have anyone who manages the &quot;who gets kicked&quot; decisions, I would gladly email SS's to them.<br>

Hmmm. Isn't that a little immature and broad? I had fun pking with several of your members until the bard and hi elf chanter started bind rushing after i asked her to scoot. <br>

<br>
  I am sure you remember me.  We have tusseled several times before.<br>
  I will agree, most of your members seem to be alot of fun.  <br>
<br>
  With that said, I have two suggestions.  The first is make sure you tell people what they are in for.  Remember your wizard friend, when I fought you and he?  He said some not so nice things while we were fighting.  Truth, it really didnt matter to me, but he acted like he couldnt understand why I would be attacking you two.<br>
<br>
  The second, you do have bind rushers.  I think you will remember the necro when you, the necro and the rogue were attacked by me and the druid.  We killed that necro.  Or, rather, my faithful Blob did.  And when the rogue wanted a one on one fight with me and him, I agreed to it.  And you and the necro started attacking.  Ok, fine, you never died.  the necro did.  And when I sent you a tell, what did I say?<br>
   &quot;tell your necro friend the next time he/she dies, dont come for the body right away, I wont let him/her near it.&quot;  <br>
   You and the rogue both basically told me screw you.  Really it was more of a &quot;If you corpse camp her, we will get you&quot;<br>
<br>
   So, the short of it, dont let the people in your group be lame, and then come here to defend them.  And make sure the people in your guild know what they are in for when they join. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#00000F><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub77.ezboard.com/uwbbelal.showPublicProfile?language=EN>WB Belal</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/anim_1.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 195<br> <font color=#FFFF00>(2/18/02 11:28:19 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub77.ezboard.com/ftallonzektimes4735generaldiscussion.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=28425.topic&index=12>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: AoTK</span><hr size=1> Eldowin,<br>
Don't assume everyone hates you because you're in a PK guild.  This is a PK server, remember that.  Alsoknow that Teuvic himself is in a PK guild.<br>
<br>
That being said, a guild's reputation is decided by it's weakest member.  For the sound of things, and I'm not making judgements, SS are necessary, but from the sound of things, you've got some bad eggs in your guild.<br>
<br>
PK guilds are fun, no doubt about it.  But when some members bindrush, CC and trash talk....don't expect people to treat you nicely, even if you yourself never have done any of those things.<br>

<br>
I have no clue about if anyone will be ejected, as many people have said a SS would be more conclusive, after all my first char I ever made once attacked an iksar standing alone on the FP docks then backed off realising the iksar had 7-8 levels on me, and some FP guards promptly jumped on the iksar out of nowhere, the iksar died and accused me of xp killing, I hadn't done it intentionally the guard had just come to my rescue or something, it was actually a reasonable delay before the guards attacked, but I was accused of xp killing for it, so obviously my view of what happened was different from their view since them and 5 other people I never even saw sent me tells saying I had been reported /shrug.<br>
<br>
anyways moral of the story take SS and complain to guild leaders, don't over generalize, we are hated for xteaming and pking, but many of us aren't bind rushing, xp killing, CCers.<br>
<br>
Apparently some of us may be. I just don't like the generalization that all of AoTK are CCers and such, hate us for xteaming if you like, but most likely if more than one person was doing this it was because they were firends who had been leveling together and were trying to look out for each other so even if a group of people attacks you in gfay it doesn't mean the rest of us chilling on luclin have any plan of CCing you.<br>
<br>
Also the comment on people hating us for being a pk guild wasn't directed at teuvic, but rather towards anyone who has been pked by us in a fair and reasonable manner and still complain (yes they exist and are very numerous)<br>
<br>
And DesertRatEQ (I think I know who you are but I'm not sure, fought several people with that that druid can't remember if deadfx was wiz or mage) BTW I don't recall actually threatening anyone when I was told my guildmates would be CCed, I believe (unless I'm mistaken) that I said not to get so angry about being pked, but I may have said I would defend him which of course I would, but it was the rogue I believe who threatened to counter CC, although I must say sandrat did threaten CCing before I ever heard my guildmates mention it, he also complained to me that my guildmates &quot;sucked&quot; for teaming up on him /shrug honestly I don't care I have been teamed up on many times it happens and as one person who was teaming up on me said, they are just looking out for each other (I attacked him in that instance so that was more than reasonable) but either way sandrat can be mad about getting ganged up on, but no one in our guild appreciates him threatening to CC a guildmate. Also whether you are Deadfx or someone elseyou guys are cool, never had trouble since deadfx appologized for almost xp killing me the first time he attacked me and eguardo. if you are someone else, my bad so many people I know heh... trying to remember, if you post again say who you are.<br>
<br>
On the other hand I see the problem with bind rushing, but threatening to CC will not win you sympathy, if you leave the part about CCing out it sounds less menacing, and might get a different response, then again maybe not. No one's perfect, and no one wants to stand around not looting their corpse, the problem with bind rushing is people not leaving when they loot really, but with no corpse you can't do much except maybe trade in the bazaar. As for the one on one fight with the rogue I was not aware you were going to go one on one, and apparently neither was the necro, so we assisted as good guildmates would under other circumstances, I believe he did tell us to lay off but that was after we had jumped in.<br>
<br>
And yes WB Belal well spoken on the guild issues, I wish it weren't so, as that is one of my major complaints but it is true, several reasonable people, even some I have grouped with before have become adversaries once we set foot in the netherbian lair and Marus Seru, the fights originated it seems from other people but being friends to some and guildmates to all of these people I became part of the fight. In the nexus and bazaar some people become much friendlier people, but as you said the actions of others reflect upon us all.<br>
<br>
An excellent example of what WB belal is saying is illustrated in Obliviar Tilde's post, personally I have no clue about Zoggo and xzenox so that didn't mean much to me, and I have no control over what the people do in MM since I rarely ever go there. But obviously Obliviar has made a generalization about us all because he encountered some people he did not get along with.<br>
<br>
Also Obliviar the comment on them zoning into a train shows lack of thought on your part probably mroe than theirs, as obviously you cannot see trains on the other side of zones, and because of the delay of zoning they cannot be certainwhat awaits them when they do get over, a train they saw could leave, but a new one could come in. obviously you were wrong here if we followed the logic that you use to prove that we are &quot;ghey&quot; then you are a moron, which if this is wrong just goes to show what happens when people make assumptions in the heat of anger.<br>
