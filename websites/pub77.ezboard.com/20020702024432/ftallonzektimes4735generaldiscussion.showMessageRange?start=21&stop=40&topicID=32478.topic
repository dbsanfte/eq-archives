I'm not mad at her at all.  During her whole flipping out session I never got angry, never yelled or anything.  Because well lets see ummmm I don't get that emotional.<br>
<br>
&lt;&lt;Maybe there is a lot more bothering her than a silly electric bill, stress? work? school? boyfriend? loneliness? nothing on tv when she has 150 channels? Are you pissing on the toilet seat again?&gt;&gt;<br>
<br>
So since she may have things bothering her its ok for her to be more emotional than a man but that doesn’t mean woman are more emotional than men?  I don't understand.  If I am pissing on the toilet seat she has no right to be upset considering she should use her own bathroom not mine. <br>
<br>
&lt;&lt;Or maybe she is psycho but i would appreciate if you didn't designate all women as falling into the overemotional category because of one distraught roommate. You displayed yourself as being emotional by posting on the TZT board in anger about women in general.&gt;&gt;<br>
<br>
Again I never posted in anger.  I posted this here because of the last couple of threads that where HERE already about this topic.  Where did I claim I have no emotions?  Or that women where overemotional?  All I said was that women where more emotional than men.  Don't put words into my mouth.<br>
<br>
Yes she is a hottie.<br>
<br>
And no there will be no sex.  She has a boyfriend and I have a girlfriend.<br>
<br>
No she doesn’t have quite as much money as I do.<br>
<br>
I think she is a good roommate.  I certainly wouldn't want to take the chances of getting a worse one by looking for a new one.  I've had guys and girls for roommates and she is no worse than any guy I've had to room with.  Overall I've been happy with most of my roommates.  I've been really blessed in that department.<br>
<br>
Also I make this statement.  I do know more than one girl, every single one I have meet is more emotional than I am.  I cannot say the same for every guy I know.<br>
<br>
Also who said women being more emotional than men was a bad thing?  Sure sometimes they flip out for no reason, but overall I don't think it’s a bad thing.  I need my girlfriend to have some emotions for me sometimes.<br>
<br>
Living at home?  No thanks.  My mom is more emotional than most women I've meet (I love her though).  Plus she lives in a dump of a town.<br>
<br>
Since my sample size is too small let’s have a poll.  Who here thinks the majority of women they have meet are more emotional than the majority of men they have meet?<br>

If you truly did not post in anger, then i apologize for that as well.   However, imo, your posting sounds angry or maybe just highly agitated.  There is definitely different tones in different words, punctuation, etc.  <br>
<br>
It does bother me, however, that so many feel it is necessary to stereotype women into being more emotional than men.  (It also annoys me when people stereotype men into being insensitive)  I could go into a whole rant about society and blah blah blah and how it has conditioned men and women both into falling into certain roles, but that has been argued for generations and i doubt a resolution or agreement will be reached on this board.  <br>
<br>
In my personal experience, i have seen all sorts of people get easily emotional and i prefer to believe it has to do with whatever is happening in that particular man/woman's life rather than their gender.  I also have met many people, men and women who never show emotion.  I actually find that kind of sad.  <br>
<br>
Hon, the pissing on the toilet seat was a joke, haha, funny =)<br>
I find humor is great in almost all situations.   <br>
<br>
Anyway, a couple people here have offered great suggestions for you to try and i hope you get your troubles resolved.  /wave<br>

<br>
women just want a provider and men just want a bauble.<br>
<br>
how about... girls are not good at math... This is very untrue always was - as to why this stereotype was enforced for so many generations is really anyone's educated guess .. It was false and it was unjustified - Just because for whatever cultural or other reason an idea is embraced does not make it valid  or truthful. (grain or otherwise.. ill explain)<br>
<br>
It was true that girls were not good at math because  1. not educated 2 not educated in math 3 also another stereotype was weighing in on this that their minds just could not comprehend such equations 3. that the danger of  learning this would be that the womb would shrink thus impairing childbirth a woman's primary and only function - at the time)4. eventually we forgot all the shrinking womb stuff but the sterotype stayed. .-BUT this stereotype was put to rest being proven false...  You see a stereotype/label  while true in a grain (i.e. some truth)- there is a possibility that grain is irrelevant enough that when embracing the whole that very grain becomes an out right lie (not to mention is could be based on opinion in the first place )...It largely depends on a limited frame of reference which could be totally off base due to a number of fallacies as I have just explained above (and in the fallacy list mentioned in the earlier post).<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
all generalizations are essentially lies and can easily encourage lazy thinking. It's easier to group things and necessary to a certain degree, however, <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>   we should often question why we believe what we do and keep enough of an open mind to realize many things are subject to change. </b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
<br>
so thank you, quintain, for opening the way for this lengthy explanation of which you were most certainly aware and were in no way attempting to be misleading... you were certainly aware of the dangers in building a solid foundation on something so easily subject to many fallacies... In fact, im certain you were trying very hard to be enlightened and explain in your very best and short-of-time way that we should all be aware of why we believe what we do.   And were in no way enforcing your opinion that women should go in to the kitchen to cry out their mood swings and bake you pie.<br>
<br>
one last note... for those of you who need a paragraph break come back later<br>
<br>
<br>
I would like to point out that superstitions die hard. Racism is a form of stereotype based on a belief of superiority for example ( i would like the empirical truth on that one - and anything you come up with will be a thinly veiled shroud at that). We are many years beyond such notions as to all the implications and inferences that racism brought with it but it is very strong in parts of the world the heat and the frustration from the wake of such thoughts are very powerful and prevalent and justly so. <br>
<br>
welcome to the deprograming room my friends, while. we attempt for years to come to continue to  prove that women are equal to men in reason and are just as capable of irrational behavior and feelings as a man and not more or less so. we have many things to UNLEARN. The information is here  to be embraced but the killing of the demon will take many more years im sure. <br>

1. A conventional, formulaic, and oversimplified conception, opinion, or image. <br>
2. One that is regarded as embodying or conforming to a set image or type.<br>
<br>
Opinions are not generally fact.  In my opinion, Nidan was angry when he started  this post, that does not make it fact.   Stereotypes are based on general observation of what is around you.  So if, let's say Bob, lived in a little town where 99% of the green eyed men in town ate taffy all the freakin time, Bob might come to the conclusion that most or all green eyed men in the world eat taffy all the freakin time.  <br>
<br>
Ned, who lives in a town a few miles South notices 95% of all the redheads in town go to the porn store twice a day.  Now Ned thinks redheads are just perverts cause Ned himself does not believe in porn.  <br>
<br>
Then of course we can't forget the blondes, they're all ditzy and girls that like sex are sluts and minorities pick fruit and southern people all love fried chicken and everyone in the Middle East is evil.  These are all generalized stereotypes and they may sound ridiculous to you and i but they are believed by quite a few.  <br>
<br>
My point being that stereotypes are not generally true.  Some larger stereotypes may be close to hitting the nail on the head but i think it is much easier to just judge each person and situation individually then live with prejudgement and STEREOTYPES and possibly miss out on a chance to meet and befriend some great people.  <br>
<br>
As for them being disproved.....where shall we start?  Thought we were working on the what was it, ah yes, woman are more emotional than men stereotype **grin**.  <br>

I believe that we are talking about this definition of stereotype vs the first.<br>
<br>
An example of this type of stereotype: Black people (those of the African descent) have curly hair.<br>
<br>
Now, does this state that black people have only curly hair and that straight hair is impossible?  No.<br>
<br>
Does it say that non-black people cannot have curly hair?  No.<br>
<br>
It is simply an observance based upon perceptual evidence gathered unconsciously throughout your life.<br>
<br>
Stereotypes are necessary in order to simplify conversation so we do not have to point out all the damn exceptions to the rule in order to not offend someone.<br>
<br>
If you see a stereotype being used, ask yourself if that description describes you.  If it doesn't, don't worry about it...it isn't anything to get in a rage over (CYPRIENE).  It is just a generalization.<br>
<br>
Just like someone claiming that all Irish men are drunks....now, I'm Irish, yet I do not get offended at this statement simply because I know that I'm not a drunk...but I also can see evidence to where this is true in racial folklore.<br>
<br>
If you get offended over stereotypes, then you want to be offended, no more, no less.   <p><center>Quintain<BR>Dark Consortium</center></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000028><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub77.ezboard.com/utulli.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Tulli</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/anim_1.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>hated globally</span><br>  Posts: 1453<br> <font color=#FFFF00>(6/21/02 6:12:09 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub77.ezboard.com/ftallonzektimes4735generaldiscussion.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=32478.topic&index=36>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: ....</span><hr size=1> /cry<br>

Q - rage? i saw no rage here from me. your being mislead by my pic maybe i should change it. and no one disputed that part of the *stereotype* ..it was the other part maybe you should reflect on that a bit (*see cyps post above). and tell someone effected by racism for example that they just want to be offended by it why dontchya. and why dont you tell someone who is a victim of rasism that there is some truth to it... that it's not entirely groundless that there is truth in there. i think you'll be kicked in to the dirt on that one just my opinion. being accused of being subhuman isn't too cool and should be addressed. myths should be dispelled when they are indeed myths =D that's what is happening her good sir.. being accused of being a drunk is funny. end of story.<br>
<br>
c.<br>
<br>
edit :eewps only on paragraph cant have that.<br>
<br>
don't over look the seriousness of said stereotype. curly or straight hair effects nothing. however, if you being hired or not hired back in the early days of this country based on a groundless stereotype as to your ability to be reliable versus a drunk that would be serious. Likewise the potential harm that can arise from ignoring racism ... ugh. why? It's serious and effects quality of life.<br>
<br>
also, the potential harm ( and occuring issues)from allowing a myth of overemotional, less rational invade the definition of the female gender hinders her in many ways. such as being reliable and competent in a political position of any real significance... all the way to her being taken seriously and not blown off in her intimate relationships.. These myths going unattended brings harm <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub77.ezboard.com/ucyprienetz.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Cypriene TZ</A> at: 6/21/02 7:33:19 am<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000028><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub77.ezboard.com/uagrul.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Agrul</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 1758<br> <font color=#FFFF00>(6/21/02 7:37:03 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub77.ezboard.com/ftallonzektimes4735generaldiscussion.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=32478.topic&index=38>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: ....</span><hr size=1> Tulli, quit wasting my air.<br>

Thanks.<br>
<br>
As for the actual conversation..<br>
<br>
&quot;If you see a stereotype being used, ask yourself if that description describes you. If it doesn't, don't worry about it...it isn't anything to get in a rage over (CYPRIENE). It is just a generalization.&quot;<br>
<br>
Fuck.  I agree with Quintain.<br>
<br>
With one small addition:  Generalizations are, by nature, at best educated guesses when put on so large a scale as that in question, and in this situation, nothing more than educated guesses based on far too small a data range given the magnitude of the statement.<br>

This, this is fun i think =)  Speaking about stuff i believe in and a little debate (maybe argue) with others, it's all good.  <br>
<br>
Hmm..the 2nd definition...i would have to disagree with you there Quintain.<br>
 2. One that is regarded as embodying or conforming to a set image or type.<br>
<br>
This to me translates more into a someone, let's say a jock.  A jock is supposed to (keep in mind now, this is just an example stereotype) be stupid, spit alot, be buff, get laid frequently, kick ass in sports, etc..  Someone that tries to embody these traits and is conforming to what society supposedly expects of him is in fact: <br>
<br>
2. One that is regarded as embodying or conforming to a set image or type.<br>
<br>
So i guess if you find a woman who does her damnedest to be more emotional than any man she ever meets, this too would fall into the range of definition 2.<br>
<br>
Agrul, I am sorry, but i have to disagree with you too sweetie, perhaps i am emotional today **sweet smile**.  I think that generalizations are more assumptions than educated guesses.   Educated guesses are more like..ok, i know that mini mart is to the South East somewhere, so i'm guessing that if i take Walker St. South a block or two and then take Jenkins Rd. to the East for about 4 blocks I should be able to find it.  Assumptions and generalizations are more along the lines of damnit, every man i have ever known has plunged tampons...all men must be tampon plungers!! You are 100% correct though that in this instance, this assumption was  **quote mode** based on far too small a data range given the magnitude of the statement. **quote off**  You really are very good with words =)<br>
<br>
Mern hon, you make the best apple pies i've ever had!! **hug**<br>

<br>
**** some hasty generalizations are not harmful - some effect the quality of people's lives. Understanding the difference is crucial. It is good to question why you believe what you do and understand how easy it is to have incorrepreated many over-looked and unchallenged fallacies in your belief systerm. Ideas and beliefs that exist are not correct just because they always have existed and therefore must be correct. i.e racism &lt;looks back to the 50's and further back still&gt;. <br>
<br>
Being put down because of your race or sex is not a positive way to live life. That is why we all work so hard to change hasty generalizations, etc. If the impression that everyone in Brazil eats a certain kind of food exists. that truly effects no one's quality of life but racism and sexism does. We are not spliting hairs on calling short people vertically challanged and being over-sensitive in the least im sorry you see it that way. We are truly here dispelling a myth that again effects a huge portion of a woman's(and therefore a man's) life - directly.. Stereotypes that are ungrounded and proven so should be dispelled. We make many generalizations as people and as a community. We supposedly use this as a shaky outline and then do away with it as it is proven inaccurate. We don't ignore them - though some stereotypes are truly insignifigant. This is not one of them. (for reasons stated in earlier posts )<br>
<br>
 A good majority of womens right's are less than 100 years old. That is not enough time to dispell and myth and put it to rest. Certainly not in light of the worlds long history.  dispelling this myth and reinforcing equality and respect  in the equation is a positive move for humankind. (enlightenment and truth not to mention quality of life is good)<br>
<br>
I'm rather sorry that you feel it is of no signifigance and that you are blind to the many issues it causes/effects .<br>
<br>
sterotypes can lack truth  and just be rooted in cultural superstion. They can equally effect the quality of a persons life. To over look that is to be willfully ignorant.<br>
<br>
so, please quit practicing your witchcraft. =) This is not an issue to be minimalized or oversimplified - it is about bringing truth and enlightenment to humankind.<br>
