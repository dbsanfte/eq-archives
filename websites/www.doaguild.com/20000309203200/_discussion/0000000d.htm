  Oh no..  do we have a hider in our midsts?!  
<p>
  I just have concern.  Everyone has a friend or two that they would like to see in DOA.  Hell, I know of at least 30 ppl that I would love to see in DOA..  The trend is going in our direction.  Seems like all the other guilds are folding, or at least losing lots of members, while we are growing.  It has finally happened, seemingly, that all the quality people have gathered in the same guild, leaving the ass's for the other guilds.  Hypothetically, say MoY disbands..  just for instance.  We would certainly want to take their best, most active members in with us..Maybe 5 or 6.  Now we are up to 30-32..  Then say some of the better independants see how we are succeeding, and they want to join..  are we going to decline entrance to BIG independants that want to join?   Now we are up to 40..  
   I guess my question is..  where do we draw the line where we can be small enough that EACH member gets attention for gear, and just friendship.  I honestly don't know if Kvasir was joking when he said he couldnt keep up with everyone these days.  
    These are just some concerns, and some things to think about before the situation gets out of hand, and our 40th member says..&quot;Kvasir who?&quot;
    btw kv.. :)  this is not a slam on you.
