<left><font face="Comic Sans MS">We hosted a weekend long raid on the Plane of Sky.
Many of our friends were able to attend.
I know guilds from DOA, OOL, OSW, and Elvar were repersented, probably others I'm overlooking.
We cleared several islands, developed methods to recover folks that fell out of the plane, and had a great time.
Since the Plane is quest oriented, loot other than quest components was a little light, but what dropped was exceptional.
We got a great Enchanter bracelett and an equally great Bard belt (grats to Meyusa and Lago) and we all got some quest components towards getting future goodies.
Mechanical problems cut things short Sunday morning, but Timgar deserves kudos on a well organized raid and providing everyone with a ton of fun.<p>

<left><font face="Comic Sans MS">We had a fantastic day in the Plane of Fear Sunday.
DOA along with friends from OOL, OSW, and some others I'm sure I'm forgetting, broke into fear early Sunday morning and completely cleared the zone in about 4 hours.
A couple of deaths on break-in, and an occasional single death here and there were all the fatalities we experienced.
Loot was not as generous as we would have liked, but a Cleric Belt, Shammy Belt, Several SK pieces, several Ranger pieces, a Druid Bracer, several pieces of Cryosilk, and several misc. goodies droped and were appreciated.
Either the calendars are no longer respected or posting over a month in advance is not enough as some folks saw fit to come n earlier in the week and kill off Cazic Thule and the Dracoliche.
Or maybe they were just scared and fled the zone : ).
Thanks to all that helped on a beautifully executed Fear trip, and congrats to Vessa for such great organization.</font></left><br>

<left><font face="Comic Sans MS">Pball put together an incredible raid into the City of Mist to reach a mob for his epic quest, which Pball was able to successfully speak with.  Many friends from all over Norrath attended, including members OoL and OSW.  A lot of loot dropped including a MOSS(Vessa), a Springwood Club(Hastur), two Ornate Rune Shields(Nords and Sornil), a Sainy's Claw(Lago), a Wu's Trance Stick(Shinoki sp?) and a large number of high level spells.  All of this bounty was awarded on a "need before greed" basis, and if no class was attending that could use or need, then the items were randomed to all present.<p>

I would like to point out that although a few died while travelling to the City of Mist...absolutely no one died while on the hunt!   <p>

Kudos Pball!</font></left><br>

<left><font face="Comic Sans MS">This past Saturday (November 11) Pball put together one great Hate raid.  DOA was joined by OOL, OSW and other friends.<p>

The break-in went extremely well with no deaths whatsoever on the break-in!<p>

A lot of great gear dropped including:<p>

Rogue Breastplate, greaves, boots and weapon<br>
Enchanter Robes<br>
Cleric Gloves, Vambraces,Helm and Boots<br>
Bard Bracers, Greaves and Martune Rapier<br>
2 pair of warrior gloves<br>
Shaman Breastplate, vambraces and shield<br><p>

I believe two Paladin epic quest items dropped, and a Rogue epic item was found in Maestro's lair.  So much gear dropped I am sure I forgot something :) Congrats to everyone who got an item!<p>

Although Maestro went bad on us, I think everyone involved had a fantastic time.  Thanks Pball!</font></left><br>

The full blown version has some features that Vessa was already requesting, so I've installed and configured the registered software. We now have a private members only forum. I will be giving DOA'ers direct access to the private areas as soon as you register (just post a message and it will walk you through the sign-up procedure). To access the private areas right away, use the password we use in the Everquest chat rooms for our guild meetings. After you register and I set your access level, you will not have to use this special password. </font></left><br>

DOA invaded the Efreeti Lord again scoring 5 pairs of Golden Efreeti Boots!!!!. A little accident marred an otherwise perfect trip, but still it was a huge success. The recent trip to the Froglok King was long on experience and Crown of the Froglock Kings, but no luck on the Mithril Two Handed Sword. Nailed 2 more Ancient Cyclops in OOT, one right after server updates. DOA is poised to invade the planes in a big way. At level 46+ or nearing it we have Vessa, Kodiak, Tsun, Clair, Vencent, Pball, Tassic, Hawkk, Blasttar, Nords, Lohy, Qwestlin, Holten, Beldwin, Deadstone, Bruiser, Hippod, and I may have overlooked a few. Even with some of those on the same account, looks like we can field 15 or so, not too shabby.   </font></left><br>

On a personal note I'd like to thank Clair, Kcin, Darkwyrm, Vencent, Opheliany, and everyone else that has helped out on the COF and Cleric quests. Major congrats to Blasttar (Hawkk's Wizzie) on level 50 and Nords on level 49, we'll be ducking Ice Comets left and right now <g>. Been some major leveling with Deadstone, Qwestlin, Lohy, and others my crummy memory is failing me on too. Give me a hard time over this guys so I can get everyone mentioned. With all the hard work you guys are doing and all the great new people coming in, I can't see much we can't accomplish. If we can keep our traditional closeness and camaraderie, I believe we can be a bright and shining example of how guilds should work. IRL update, as far as I'm concerned the third annual DOA Labor Day brouhaha is a go for Labor Day weekend. Get with me for any information you need on travel or whatever. Also, I've been asked several times when we are invading New Orleans again. I'm up for it and ready when you guys are!!!! </font></left><br>

We had a wildly successful Efreeti Lord trip turning up 8 pairs of Golden Efreeti Boots!!!! Special thanks to all our friends that helped out. We're looking at a camping trip for the tanks next, maybe the Froglock King for Crown of the Froglock Kings and Mithril Two Handed Sword. Send in any suggestions. Note that Bertox Town hall no longer schedules Dragons or the Efreeti (effective 2/7/00). That's why our scheduled hunt did not appear on the calendar. Have some more screenshots to post. Hopefully will get those up sometime this week. Another protracted Fear hunt went on last eek. Lots of folks got gear (the DOA participant got a Thorny Vine Bracer). The Dracolich and Cazic Thule were both vanquished and Cazic dropped our servers first Crimson Robe of Alendine. </font></left><br>

<left><font face="Comic Sans MS">Prophecy, The Company, and DOA (well 1 DOA'er <g>) killed Lady Vox in Permafrost this evening. Prophecy has this dragon down to a science and all went very smoothly with few deaths. DOA may have been sparsely repersented, but we did get the killing blow on Lady Vox! Check out the Scrapbook for a few screenshots. </font></left><br>

<left><font face="Comic Sans MS">Our Mistmoore hunt was a success. The silly Ranger only got everyone killed once (possibly a new record). Several Nightshade Wreaths, quite a few Cape of the Midnight Mist, a Lute of the Gypsy Princess, and a Mistmoore Battle Drum were aquired. A few days ago a joint effort of Pont, Company, DOA, and friends dropped  Innoruuk again. We were also present during some of the nearly week long total domination of the Plane of Fear. One lucky DOA Ranger aquired a Fluxbladed Axe, Thorny Vine Gauntlets, and Thorny Vine Boots. Thanks to Ascendants for the great job breaking into the zone, the tireless effort keeping it broken, and the invitations to participate. </font></left><br>
