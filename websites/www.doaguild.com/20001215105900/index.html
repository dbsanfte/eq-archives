<left><font face="Comic Sans MS">Pball put together an incredible raid into the City of Mist to reach a mob for his epic quest, which Pball was able to successfully speak with.  Many friends from all over Norrath attended, including members OoL and OSW.  A lot of loot dropped including a MOSS(Vessa), a Springwood Club(Hastur), two Ornate Rune Shields(Nords and Sornil), a Sainy's Claw(Lago), a Wu's Trance Stick(Shinoki sp?) and a large number of high level spells.  All of this bounty was awarded on a "need before greed" basis, and if no class was attending that could use or need, then the items were randomed to all present.<p>

I would like to point out that although a few died while travelling to the City of Mist...absolutely no one died while on the hunt!   <p>

Kudos Pball!</font></left><br>

<left><font face="Comic Sans MS">This past Saturday (November 11) Pball put together one great Hate raid.  DOA was joined by OOL, OSW and other friends.<p>

The break-in went extremely well with no deaths whatsoever on the break-in!<p>

A lot of great gear dropped including:<p>

Rogue Breastplate, greaves, boots and weapon<br>
Enchanter Robes<br>
Cleric Gloves, Vambraces,Helm and Boots<br>
Bard Bracers, Greaves and Martune Rapier<br>
2 pair of warrior gloves<br>
Shaman Breastplate, vambraces and shield<br><p>

I believe two Paladin epic quest items dropped, and a Rogue epic item was found in Maestro's lair.  So much gear dropped I am sure I forgot something :) Congrats to everyone who got an item!<p>

Although Maestro went bad on us, I think everyone involved had a fantastic time.  Thanks Pball!</font></left><br>

The full blown version has some features that Vessa was already requesting, so I've installed and configured the registered software. We now have a private members only forum. I will be giving DOA'ers direct access to the private areas as soon as you register (just post a message and it will walk you through the sign-up procedure). To access the private areas right away, use the password we use in the Everquest chat rooms for our guild meetings. After you register and I set your access level, you will not have to use this special password. </font></left><br>

The loot included a Druid shield, several Magician pieces, Enchanter arms, and Cleric pieces for our side. Inny was kind enough to give up a Bryarzephyr, Bloodmoon, and a Diamond Rod.

I think we need to re-think how we are doing this (or even if we wanna try bringing in a second/later squad). Vessa is taking a group to a Naggy hunt Wednesday night, if you are in that group, you HAVE to be there and ready to go. Please get with Vessa and make sure you know when and where.

DOA invaded the Efreeti Lord again scoring 5 pairs of Golden Efreeti Boots!!!!. A little accident marred an otherwise perfect trip, but still it was a huge success. The recent trip to the Froglok King was long on experience and Crown of the Froglock Kings, but no luck on the Mithril Two Handed Sword. Nailed 2 more Ancient Cyclops in OOT, one right after server updates. DOA is poised to invade the planes in a big way. At level 46+ or nearing it we have Vessa, Kodiak, Tsun, Clair, Vencent, Pball, Tassic, Hawkk, Blasttar, Nords, Lohy, Qwestlin, Holten, Beldwin, Deadstone, Bruiser, Hippod, and I may have overlooked a few. Even with some of those on the same account, looks like we can field 15 or so, not too shabby.   </font></left><br>

On a personal note I'd like to thank Clair, Kcin, Darkwyrm, Vencent, Opheliany, and everyone else that has helped out on the COF and Cleric quests. Major congrats to Blasttar (Hawkk's Wizzie) on level 50 and Nords on level 49, we'll be ducking Ice Comets left and right now <g>. Been some major leveling with Deadstone, Qwestlin, Lohy, and others my crummy memory is failing me on too. Give me a hard time over this guys so I can get everyone mentioned. With all the hard work you guys are doing and all the great new people coming in, I can't see much we can't accomplish. If we can keep our traditional closeness and camaraderie, I believe we can be a bright and shining example of how guilds should work. IRL update, as far as I'm concerned the third annual DOA Labor Day brouhaha is a go for Labor Day weekend. Get with me for any information you need on travel or whatever. Also, I've been asked several times when we are invading New Orleans again. I'm up for it and ready when you guys are!!!! </font></left><br>

We had a wildly successful Efreeti Lord trip turning up 8 pairs of Golden Efreeti Boots!!!! Special thanks to all our friends that helped out. We're looking at a camping trip for the tanks next, maybe the Froglock King for Crown of the Froglock Kings and Mithril Two Handed Sword. Send in any suggestions. Note that Bertox Town hall no longer schedules Dragons or the Efreeti (effective 2/7/00). That's why our scheduled hunt did not appear on the calendar. Have some more screenshots to post. Hopefully will get those up sometime this week. Another protracted Fear hunt went on last eek. Lots of folks got gear (the DOA participant got a Thorny Vine Bracer). The Dracolich and Cazic Thule were both vanquished and Cazic dropped our servers first Crimson Robe of Alendine. </font></left><br>

<left><font face="Comic Sans MS">Made a little change to the guest book to keep the comments in a seperate file. This should keep me from accidently wiping out the entrys when I update (grin). Will be adding some goodies from the recent POF hunt soon. Don't forget Aly's Mistmoore hunt scheduled for Saturday morning. I bet we can set up several shifts and keep this hunt going quite awhile. Also please try to make the meeting Sunday afternoon.</font></left><br>

<left><font face="Comic Sans MS">DOA, Pontificate Lusus, The Company, Prophecy and friends ruled on the Plane of Hate last night. Only a few deaths on initial break in and only ONE massive death train all evening culminated in the death of the Maestro of Rancor. He dropped a Kelin's Seven Stringed Lute: Stringed Instrument. +9 dex, +15 char, +9 agil Bard only (congrats Bozco), Mempo of Likato: Effect of Ultravision. Wt. 0.1. magic, lore, no drop. Monk only (congrats Weirleader), and 2 spell research components. Several pieces of Cleric gear dropped, A Darkmetal Holy Water Sprinkler: Damage 16, Delay 29. +4 wis. Wt. 7.5. Paladin only (all the paladins present already had, so it was unclaimed), and Enchanter sleeves (Congrats Clair). I think the sleeves are the Enchanter only replacement for Cryosilk and are Int +7 Hp +15 Cha +3 Sv Fire +9, I'll get the name and verify the info tonight. The major accomplishment of the evening, THE RANGER ONLY DIED TWICE!!!! (grin)</font></left><br>

<left><font face="Comic Sans MS">The DOA server hosted mailing list is operational. It is news@doaguild.com. A little easier to remember than the old one huh? Vessa and I (Holt) also have email addresses set up on the web server. holt@doaguild.com and vessa@doaguild.com. Please email to either of us with  addresses to be added to the mailing list or any other guild/web-page related information. <p>

Together with Pontificate Lusus and The Company (and Clair from Prophecy), DOA participated in the first slaying of Innoruuk, The God of Hate on  Bertoxxulous server. The loot from the God was a little sparse (Wand of Diamonds [10/30 1HB casts diamond skin, wizard], Wand of Souls [necromancer], Dawnchaser Spear [11/25 piercing, bard], A Scythe [ 30/42 +10 int,shadow knight no SKs on the trip, didn't get the name of the item], page [enchanter research item]), but a great time was had by all. <p>

Ascendants, Arcane Dominion, and assorted others have taken the Plane of Fear and slain Cazic Thule. They 37 hour ordeal climaxed with the slaying of a god, but was quickly anticlimaxed by everyone being slaughtered by mobs that had regenerated during the fight. I believe one Rainbow shield was looted off of Cazic before everyone was killed. Major congrats to all those involved in the second slaying of a god on Bertoxxulous server. <p>

Ascendants, Arcane Dominion, The Company, DOA, and a host of others participated in the second slaying of the dragon Nagafen. 2 Cloaks of flame, an Orb of Tishan and a Selo's drum were looted. This was the first dragon hunt in which DOA participated. <p>

Hawkk is the first DOA to score a pair of SSoY's. Congrats! </font></left><br>
