<P><B>Polzin Mrid</B> - The Hole - (Location 210, -50, -350) in a garden </P>
You: 'Hail Polzin Mrid!'
<BR>Polzin Mrid: 'Yes, young one? 
<BR><BR>You give Polzin Mrid Jeb's Seal.
<BR>Polzin Mrid: 'Jeb has spoken with you already, excellent. Tell me are you ready for the test of the phantasm? 
<BR>You receive Jeb's Seal back.
<BR><BR>You: 'I am ready for the test of the phantasm'
<BR>Polzin Mrid: 'It will be simple, go collect these items and return them to me. Head of a serpent, essence of a ghost, essence of a vampire, and sands of the mystics. Do so and you will receive the last of the pieces. Be sure to combine them in a sack first. Just ask and I will provide you with one. 
<BR><BR>You: 'What is the <A href=polzin.html#ser>head of a serpent</A>?'
<BR>Polzin Mrid: 'Serpent is probably not an accurate term form what you must return to me. It is actaully the reminants of a spirit. The spirit is one which was erradicated long long ago by the Iksar. I believe they were called the Shissar. You may need to travel to the Iksar city to learn more about these creatures. 
<BR><BR>You: 'What is the <A href=polzin.html#gho>essence of a ghost</A>?'
<BR>Polzin Mrid: 'You don't have to look for to find roaming spirits. One in particular though has more meaning then the other sorry souls trapped here. You see, Kindle was a dear friend of mine. I came in search of him when he stopped writing. Wel....look at me now. I fear that I have succumbed to the same fate as poor Kindle. 
<BR><BR>You: 'What is the <a href=polzin.html#vam>essence of a vampire</A>?'
<BR>Polzin Mrid: 'The essence of a vampire is just that. Only the most powerful of these creatures will possess what you need. 
<BR><BR>You: 'What <a href=polzin.html#san>sands of the mystics</A>?'
<BR>Polzin Mrid: 'They are sands that were imbued with the magical might of the mystics. Mystics use a ritual involving their own blood to create a powerful bond with the sand. One will need to search the shores. 
<BR><BR>You place the Head of the Serpent into an Enchanter's Bag.
<BR>You place the Essence of a Ghost into an Enchanter's Bag.
