</FONT><HR>Sarevoc of the whole group who left i was sadest to see you leave, i know you personaly did care for DOA.  The only words of addvice i could give you at the time were wait it out. I also dont have an officer tag but neither did most of the people who were playing at the time.  DOA's officers were burnt or enjoying there summer it happens at times to most guilds.  If any mistake was made it was not setting up a council who had charge while they were away, but the Thruth i that was even taken care of untill nords cable went down totaly out of the controll of the rest of us leaveing us officerless.  As far as people ignoring you.. that was all missunderstood like many things.  Sure you were all new to the tag but people were all doing there own thing "Leveling UP" as i was strongely encourageing untill officers came back.  When we get in full swing raids happen offten some people feel they dont have time to get exp... Not haveing officers has hurt DOA number wise but those who are sticking around FINALY are progressing exp wise.  You will be missed no matter how little you think we cared..<P>As far as bashing nibk's apology Well eliath did that enough for everyone, and lost a great deal of my respect in doing so.<P><-----Loooks back on imm's post and "quote"<P>Respect is not given its earned.<P>------------------<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#800080" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://www.doaguild.com/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=1&topic=000494.cgi&ReplyNum=000010&forum=General&TopicSubject=Re.+Nbiks+post+to+SOH+site...">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#dedfdf">

</FONT><HR>My post has obviously been misunderstood.  Personally, I found Nibk's apology very sincere (so backoff varl... /jk).  However, I don't believe it was directed to me so much as others in SoH.  My post was intended to clear up my reasoning for leaving.  I'm sorry if it was offensive in any way but to say that SoH left the guild strictly because of the Chardok raid is just wrong.  You say I should have stepped up and taken the role of leader instead of begging for others to do something.  Well, that is much easier said than done.  First of all, I am not an officer so no one feels that they should listen to me, just as I don't feel I should be obligated to listen to another non-officer.  Without designated leadership, there will only be chaos.  Second, on several occasions, I did try to step up and get things organized anyway, but as stated earlier I am ignored almost constantly.  Being completely ignored was one of the biggest reasons I had for leaving.  I know sometimes you get in tell hell and can't talk to everyone but you could at least say "one sec" or "busy".  If you didn't like my idea, then speak up... tell me my idea was stupid... tell me your idea.  I want to be part of the team and not ignored like some newbie begging for pp.  If any of my posts have offended anyone I am truly sorry that was not my intent.  I wish nothing but good things for DoA and hope that things continue to progress.<P>------------------<BR>Sarevoc  -56 Revenant-<p>[This message has been edited by Sarevoc (edited 08-29-2001).]</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#800080" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://www.doaguild.com/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=1&topic=000494.cgi&ReplyNum=000008&forum=General&TopicSubject=Re.+Nbiks+post+to+SOH+site...">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#dedfdf">

</FONT><HR>I hate to pick at someone's post, but another thing that bothered me was Sarevoc saying he begged someone to take initiative. This comment isn't singularly pointed at Sarevoc but at everyone, when the time comes, you have to be willing to pony on up and take charge. Lord knows it is much much easier to let somebody else take the reins and drive, but it's just cruel to always dump that responsibility on the same person. Organizing a raid is a terrible job. Unless it goes off to perfection you will never hear a kind word thanking you for doing it. You will get hateful tells from people you have to turn away for various reasons. Every decision you make will be questioned. Masaging all these egos and hurt feelings and cajoling people into showing up and dealing with all the delays....then you have to actually lead the raid. <P>------------------<BR> Opportunity should be equal, must be equal, but achievement must remain individual.  ---<I>Drizzt Do'Urden</I></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#800080" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://www.doaguild.com/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=1&topic=000494.cgi&ReplyNum=000007&forum=General&TopicSubject=Re.+Nbiks+post+to+SOH+site...">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#f7f7f7">

</FONT><HR>Respect is being lost atm..<BR> <BR>Bringing the chardok raid into this whole thing is just like makeing up a reason to leave. When you join a guild you join the guild for its ups and downs.  DOA was in its low point at the time. "Which it is comeing out of strong".  There was plenty of people who showed up to chardok, easily enough to get the job done, but it was called off so everyone left. Many people made alot of extra effort to be there on time and were. There is no doubt in my mind that it would have been successful, but things happen.<BR>Not everything is perfect nor are people. You left DOA because of certain things that were being dealt with, and are being fixed. Saying you left DOA because of lack of effort or help is a joke.  You cant expect people to do everything for you, you have to rise up and take new chalanges.  You were somewhat new to DOA but there is no reason any of you could not have taken the leadership role it was badly calling out for in its time of need.  Being "THE" leader and Acting like a leader are not so differernt.  Remember that next time the going gets rough, and things are not falling in place for you. Maybe then you will know What it means to rise up to a chalange.<P>As for nibk yes he lashed out and it was not just.  What more can he give than an apology?  It took alot more of a man than most to even post what he did, and after you all left POG he felt very bad and wish to corect his mistakes.  The way you treated his apology makes me sick i for one know he ment every word, and for you to shrug it off and ask for more is just pathetic. <P>At times the easy way out may look good, but where is the chalange?  Items are not the only rewards in EQ.<P><BR>Respect is never given it is earned. <P>------------------<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#800080" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://www.doaguild.com/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=1&topic=000494.cgi&ReplyNum=000006&forum=General&TopicSubject=Re.+Nbiks+post+to+SOH+site...">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#dedfdf">

</FONT><HR>As for why SoH left DoA, It was NOT only because of the failed Chardok raid.  I cannot speak for everyone but my personal reasons for leaving were simple.  Lack of leadership and direction.  Heck, we tried to do raids without a single officer on-line.  The whole point of joining a guild is to work together to accomplish common goals.  It is the duty of the officers (in my opinion anyway) to keep the guild motivated and informed.  I posted on the boards begging for someone to take the initiative but once again I received no response.  I seemed to be getting ignored a lot.  After most of my friends had left, I had no reason to stay.  I was not "taking the easy way out" as some have stated.  I fail to see how returning to a smaller guild is an "easy way out".  Easy way out of what?<P>------------------<BR>Sarevoc  -56 Revenant-</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#800080" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://www.doaguild.com/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=1&topic=000494.cgi&ReplyNum=000005&forum=General&TopicSubject=Re.+Nbiks+post+to+SOH+site...">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#f7f7f7">

</FONT><HR>I can only speak for myself, but I was there at the proper time that the raid was announced and was ready to rock and I know a lot of key DoA personel were there as well.  The other guild (Glory's Path) beat us to the punch and the raid was called.  I myself had a birthday party to go to that night so I know I wouldn't be able to attend the second one that was called at 4:00pm my time so I would hope you would understand.<P>As I'm sure most DoA's would tell you, I have never denied someone help with their epic with one exception of where I was gonna help Elephi get his piece from KC and was asked to join a DE corruptor raid.<P>These things sometimes happen and we can't always get what we want when we want it, but we move on.  I am very sorry to see Fjorn, Eliath and Orrek go to SoH as I believe they were needed very much in our guild and I loved hunting and talking with them as I did quite often.  I personally just get sick of people throwing in the towel everytime something doesn't go their way.  It's a game after all, lets just have fun and try to kick as much ass as as possible.<P>Not sure why I posted, maybe I just wanted to have another post under my belt.  lol<P>/em shakes his moneymaker!<P>Immy<P><P>------------------<BR>Immortious Sureblade<BR>Champion of the 53rd Season<BR>Defender of Kaladim<BR>What doesn't kill me will surely be dead when I get done with it!</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#800080" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://www.doaguild.com/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=1&topic=000494.cgi&ReplyNum=000003&forum=General&TopicSubject=Re.+Nbiks+post+to+SOH+site...">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#f7f7f7">

</FONT><HR>You can take this as you like it, but you are leaving out a HUGE piece of information about Chardok. Well before the time to arrive there and be ready to go Fjorn announces in guildchat that some other group has already gone in and intends to camp the mobs we were going after. THAT STATEMENT ends that raid, period. I had characters binded there, I rebinded where I was hunting, I'm sure anyone else with two neurons to rub together did the same. All the melee types caught rides out. Hours later when that group that beat us there wipes out, you call for another raid on Chardok. This raid is MUCH different. It's spur of the moment with ZERO chance for any preparation. I'm sorry, but the chance of raid deep into Chardok comming together at the last minute is slim at best. AND EVERYONE KNOWS it's darn unlikely to come together, so few people are going to spend 45 minutes working their way back out there. There is a monumental difference in heading out there and camping the night before or early in the morning before a planned raid and dropping whatever groups you've gotten into and running back there. Plus you can add in the spectre of the folks that got wiped out getting their courage screwed back up and going back in while we're all in transit.<P>The reason you see poor turnout on many of these raids is that those planning them just assume the raid fairy is gonna show up and wave it's magic wand and make the people you need show up. You have inexperienced raid leaders posting about a raid and just hoping that enough people will show up. That is a severe discourtsey to the people that do show for your raids when they wash out.<P>You have to speak to the key people you need and, as much as humanly possible, make sure they are going to be there. You may need to get to the site hours and hours early to try and make sure anyone else showing up knows you are going in. You may even have to make some contacts with people in other guilds so you can let them know when you are planning to raid.<P>Thre are some raids that fail because a given guild just wont support them, but the majority of the time the responsibility belongs to the raid organizer. The correct response to a failed raid is figure out what you did wrong, not wave your hands and walk out because your guild wont support you.<P>------------------<BR> Opportunity should be equal, must be equal, but achievement must remain individual.  ---<I>Drizzt Do'Urden</I></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#800080" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://www.doaguild.com/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=1&topic=000494.cgi&ReplyNum=000002&forum=General&TopicSubject=Re.+Nbiks+post+to+SOH+site...">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#dedfdf">

</FONT><HR>Now... I'd like to address a few misconceptions it seems...<P>Now Let me explain why we left... As a whole I found the guild to be a very nice group of people.... But during you transition stage with the oldtimers leaving for greener pastures we helped on many epic raids....<P>Now Fjorn had set this raid up 2 weeks prior to Chardok.. and everyone claimed they would be there to help.... 30 mins after posted raid time only 16 people were logged in... out of those 16 5 (including the SOH'ers that had come to DOA) showed up.... <P>So when you make claims that we insulted the guild or talked smack know your facts.. I have NEVR spoken ill of DoA to anyone.. As a whole you were all nice people.. Hell but the lack of support offered but asked of on epics made me a tad dissappointed... Fjorns is easier than mine is.. and more desireable by a guild... So when I see that level of support ofr him I came to the personal realization that I would NEVER get mine with the guild.. No offense intended but alot to be taken by that statement I'm sure...<P>As to Help Nibk I like you.. but I have known Orrek almost a year now... He never screws over anyone.... That's more my style... so if he says he did'nt see the request to invis ya he prolly missed it... But again.. when you apologize try to make it at least sound sincere... I find the apology given on our site as hollow as it seems to have been written...<P>Just my two cents...<BR>-Eliath<P>P.S. this dosen't change my mind in as a whole DoA is a good group of ppl in my book..... Nibk owes Orrek a bit more of an apology IMHO tho...<P>------------------<BR>The damn inkie!!!</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#800080" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://www.doaguild.com/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=1&topic=000494.cgi&ReplyNum=000001&forum=General&TopicSubject=Re.+Nbiks+post+to+SOH+site...">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#f7f7f7">

</FONT><HR>Subject:  My most humble apologizes <BR>Posted By:  Nibk Vonlifebreath Guild Member<BR> <BR>Posted At:  8/27/01 10:08:42 am  <BR> <BR>Open mouth, insert hairy foot.<P>My most humble apologies to Fjorn, Orrek, and anyone else in Sons of Hate that I may offended! <P>First of all, when you guys left DoA, and I heard what you had to say about the guild and why you left, I took it very personally. I try my hardest to be there for anyone who needs me and I thought I had done that. So I thought I was getting bashed right along with the rest of the guild and it is hard for me to keep quite when I have such strong feelings about something. I said some things to Fjorn and Orrek that was not appropriate and for that I apologize. I also have a great respect for the 2 of you and have enjoyed grouping with you. I hope to be able to group again some time soon.<P>Now for Orrek! I apologize humbly to you for cussing you in PoG yesterday. There is no excuse for it. I had been in PoG all day and was tired and frustrated. I misunderstood your intentions and instead of just waiting to find out from you what happened I blew up at you and for that I am most sorry. You have been nothing but nice to me and what I did to you was un-excusable. I hope that you except my apology and hope that you do not hold anything against DoA for my actions.<P>I salute you all and hope to see you in game very soon<P>Nibk (Nibbles} VonLifebreath<BR>52 Vicar of Brell<P><BR>Edited by: Nibk Vonlifebreath at: 8/27/01 10:11:06 am<BR> <BR><P>------------------<BR>The damn inkie!!!</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#800080" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://www.doaguild.com/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=1&topic=000494.cgi&ReplyNum=000000&forum=General&TopicSubject=Re.+Nbiks+post+to+SOH+site...">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr></table><table border=0 width="95%"><TR><TD valign=top align=left><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><P>All times are CT (US)</FONT></td><td align=right valign=top><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><A HREF="http://www.doaguild.com/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum1&number=1&thisthread=000494&go=newer"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next newest topic.">next newest topic</ACRONYM></A> | <A HREF="http://www.doaguild.com/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum1&number=1&thisthread=000494&go=older"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next oldest topic.">next oldest topic</ACRONYM></A></font></td></tr>
