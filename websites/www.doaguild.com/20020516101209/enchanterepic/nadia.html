<P><B>Nadia Starfeast</B> - Firiona Vie (-3870, 2525, -75)</P>
You: 'hail Nadia Starfeast'
<BR>Nadia Starfeast: 'Hello my dear. I am quite pleased to make your acquaintance, perhaps even charmed. 
<BR><BR>You: 'I need a sack.'
<BR>Nadia Starfeast: 'Take this sack and combine the items I requested in it. Then return it to me. 
<BR>You receive an Enchanter's Bag.
<BR><BR>You: 'What gems?'
<BR>Nadia Starfeast: 'I have prepared some gems that you will need to trap the essence. You will need to force a diamond, sapphire, ruby and emerald onto special creatures to obtain their essence. 
<BR><BR>You: 'What <a href=nadia.html#dia>diamond</A>?'
<BR>Nadia Starfeast: 'Here is the diamond that I have prepared for you. Its only purpose is to trap the essence of a particular book worm. If you should fail in your first attempt. Do not worry, I will provide you with another. 
<BR>You receive A Dull Diamond.

<BR>Nadia Starfeast: 'Here is the sapphire that I have prepared for you. Take it and give it to the one referred to as the Golden Faerie.

<BR><BR>A Dull Sapphire
<BR><img src=dullsap.jpg alt="Dull Sapphire" height=124 width=308>
<BR><BR>You: 'What <A href=nadia.html#rub>ruby</A>?'
<BR>Nadia Starfeast: 'Blood red is the ruby that I have given you. The city that you must travel to has no sun, but still a day and night. And at night, the mist could suffocate one. Tis the fate of poor Jaxion. 
<BR>You receive A Dull Ruby.
<BR><BR>A Dull Ruby
<BR><img src=dullrub.jpg alt="Dull Ruby" height=122 width=310>
<BR><BR>You: 'What <A href=nadia.html#eme>emerald</A>?'
<BR>Nadia Starfeast jumps. Eeekk... a scorpian. I thought they rid this area of these critters. Those things give me the creepers. Take this emerald and be on your way. 
<BR>You receive A Dull Emerald.

<P><B>A Spectral Librarian</B> - Kaesora (85.19, -415.31, 98.46)</P>
<img src=librarian.jpg alt="A Spectral Librarian" width=196 height=415>
<BR><BR>You hand the Spectral Librarian a Dull Diamond.
<BR>Spectral librarian: 'You have no idea what it is like to be trapped in this place. Take your precious little stone and leave this place.'
<BR><FONT color=#bbbb00>You gain experience!!</FONT>
<BR>You have received an Enchanted Diamond.
<BR><BR>An Enchanted Diamond
<BR><img src=encdia.jpg alt="An Enchanted Diamond" width=312 height=122>
<BR><BR>When you Charm the Spectral Librarian and give it the Dull Diamond it returns an Enchanted Diamond and then gets upset and turns into an Enraged Spectral Librarian.
<BR><BR><B>Enraged Spectral Librarian</B>
<BR><img src=enraged.jpg alt="An Enraged Spectral Librarian" width=320 height=446>
<BR><BR>You do NOT have to kill this Enraged Spectral Librarian to get it's essence.  If you do kill it, it turns into 3 cute little Freed Souls
<BR><BR><B>Freed Souls</B>
<BR><img src=freed.jpg alt="Freed Souls" width=320 height=281>
<BR><BR>The Freed Souls cast nasty AE fire spells and are immune to fire damage, but only have about 1 hitpoint each.  :)
<BR><BR><A href=aftermath2.jpg><img src=aftermath1.jpg border=0 alt="Aftermath of the Enraged Spectral Librarian" height=240 width=320></A>
<BR><BR>It is quite easy to get into the Library.  Basically you enter Kaesora, cast invis, go straight forwards, drop down the hole with levitate, don't go all the way down, just head forwards onto the ledge in front that you can see. Face directly away from the door, enter the room with the 3 spiders and turn right and go thru that door. Directly behind the door there is a secret wall, go through that and then *just* before you hit the corner, cast invis undead. Follow the passage going down until you come to a large area with a building. Inside that building is the Spectral Librarian, or the Tortured Librarian. Not sure on which one is the place holder, as the Tortured Librarian dropped a Kunzar Cloak, so perhaps he is the rare and the spectral librarian is the place holder.
<BR><BR>On a side note, if you go up to the 2nd floor of the Library you can also pick up a piece of the Medallion needed to enter Veeshan's Peak.

<P><B>Faelia Goldenwing</B> - Skyfire (1550, -1000)</P>
<img src=felia.jpg alt="Felia Goldenwing" height=171 width=240>
<BR><BR>Enchanted Sapphire
<BR><img src=encsap.jpg alt="Enchanted Sapphire" width=311 height=123>
<BR><BR>She's a tiny Chromodrac.  Skyfire is exactly like Trakanons Teeth. Consider Faelia to be the Skyfire version of the Froglok Forager/Hunter spawns. With a druid/ranger you can pull the funky spawns and eventually you will get her. All of these spawn near the Burning Woods zone and people who camp that area see her dozens of times a day. Mobs there will agro her and kill her soon after she pops.

<P><B>Wraith of Jaxion</B> - City of Mist (<A href="mailto:prof_vulture_man@hotmail.com">mail me the loc</A>)</P>
<img src=jaxion.jpg alt="Wraith of Jaxion" height=344 width="269">
<BR><BR>Enchanted Ruby
<BR><img src=encruby.jpg alt="Enchanted Ruby" height=118 width=281>
<BR><BR>The Wraith of Jaxion spawns at the final building (the one that the last reaver and Neh'Ashiir spawns in). The wraith has a placeholder, and it goes around the building. Keep killing everything in that last building once you have cleared the reaver, and the Wraith of Jaxion should spawn eventually.

<P><B>Impaler Tzilug</B> - Overthere (-91, 814, -502)</P>
<img src=tzilug.jpg alt="Impaler Tzilug" width=386 height=296>
<BR>A named Scorpian with five (5) guardians, his level varies around level 50. 
<BR><BR>You hand Impaler Tzilug a Dull Emerald.
<BR>Impaler Tzilug: 'Your bidding has been done, now leave this land and never return.'
<BR>You recieve an Enchanted Emerald
<BR><FONT color=#bbbb00>You gain experience!!</FONT>
<BR><FONT COLOR=#BB0000>Impaler Tzilug hits YOU for 185 points of damage.</FONT>
<BR><BR>Enchanted Emerald
<BR><img src=enceme.jpg alt="Enchanted Emerald" width=313 height=123>
<BR><BR>If your Venril Sathir faction is high enough you may not even have to charm Impaler Tzilug, though if you do this he will attack you after returning the Enchanted Emerald.  However if it's not here's one strategy I have heard. Have a cleric run up to the guardians under the effect of Divine Aura.  Being Invulnerable (s)he can "tank" while you mesmerize/enthrall/entrance the guardians, charm Tzilug, hand him the emerald, and get out.</TD></TR></TABLE>
<BR><BR>Another strategy for charming Tzilug is to have a druid pull him by casting harmony on his guards to get him alone.
<BR><BR>Yet Another strategy is to just cast Rune on yourself, run in Flux, AE Mes, charm and get out.
