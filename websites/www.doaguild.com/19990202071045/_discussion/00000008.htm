<p> Perhaps I am speaking out of place, since I am relatively new to DOA, but I think we
need to concern ourselves with our guild growing too quickly. I feel it is important to
have strong bonds with your brothers, willing to risk life and gear to help in a crisis.
You MUST learn to trust your guild mates, especially your healers. And these two things
are so much easier obtained if you a have a strong, small, tight knit group. At Thursday
meeting Kvasir said. &quot;Damn, I can't keep up with everyone anymore!&quot; I understand
the reason for class leaders, and it was a great idea, but I feel it doesnt make it
acceptable to get too big. If we have a 15-18 person guild with REGULAR active members we
have plenty to have a good mix of classes. We have plenty to do some of the more difficult
lairs. With each additional member you add, i sorta feel you take away the importance of
every current standing member. And if you feel less important, you aren't going to put
100% into the guild, like MOY or SRD, who was recruiting anyone and everyone of the
street. This is nothing personal against the newer members of DOA. Just some opinions from
a pally :) Flagg___DOA</p>

<p>Well....
<p>
1)  My response was to the useless, degrading remarks about Stumpy.  You should be responding to the &quot;Re:  Stumpy is....&quot; NOT &quot;Re: MPGN)  But, you wouldn't KNOW that because;
<p>
2)  The Test message board seems to be interfering with the Forum board.   Seems like the source coding is in serious need of some modifications, no???  Hence why my 2 cents worth against empty-headed bashing go mixed up with statements of blunder.  AND;
<p>
3)  Nobody invited me in to comment.  This site is left wide open to alternated life forms such as &quot;non-drakkar&quot; types such as myself.  By that, you have simply invited the rebuttal.  If you don't like it, then employ some security measures to keep out the &quot;riff-raff&quot;.  Its not hard to do.  All thats required is that you apply yourselfs to constructive activities like building web sites instead of the dubious dilligence of blowing away fairy princesses with machine guns.
<p>
Take THAT!!!</p>
