<p align="left"> After a short few hours of trials and very positive feedback,
I ordered the registered version of the forum software we were testing. The
full blown version has some features that Vessa was already requesting, so 
I've installed and configured the registered software. We now have a private
members only forum. I will be giving DOA'ers direct access to the private areas
as soon as you register (just post a message and it will walk you through the 
sign-up procedure). To access the private areas right away, use the password
we use in the Everquest chat rooms for our guild meetings. After you register 
and I set your access level, you will not have to use this special password.

<p align="center">&nbsp;</p>


<p align="center"><strong>Apr 18, 2000</strong></p>

<p align="left"> I've installed new forum software and have it working. Please play 
around with it and let me know what you think.

DOA was invited to go play on the Plane of Hate Monday night.
Two forces went in, picked opposite sides, cleared the mobs, and met in the
middle to kill Innoruuk. The loot included a Druid shield, several Magician
pieces, Enchanter arms, and Cleric pieces for our side. Inny was kind enough to
give up a Bryarzephyr, Bloodmoon, and a Diamond Rod. A good time was had by all.
Thanks Iila for inviting us. Good job Neuroth and Iila on organizing the hunt.</p>

<p align="center">&nbsp;</p>

<p align="center"><strong>Apr 17, 2000</strong></p>

<p align="left"> DOA and friends had a very successful expedition to the Plane
of Hate Saturday. An otherwise great experience was marred by some hunt
scheduling problems, but hopefully those will all be corrected for future trips.
A big thank you to all our friends that came along to bonk bad guys and congrats
to those that won some planes goodies. Pending any email votes still to be
received, Njall, Zhyla, and Ramja welcome to DOA. Divanna and Pyrge have applied
for DOA membership and have been/wiil be temp tagged, please look for them in
Guildchat and introduce yourselves.</p>

<p align="center"><strong>Apr 4, 2000</strong></p>

<p align="left"> DOA intruded on the Efreeti Lord yet again scoring 2 pairs of <a href="http://everquest.allakhazam.com/equipment/graphics10/Golden_Efreeti_Boots.html">Golden
Efreeti Boots</a> and 2 <a href="http://everquest.allakhazam.com/equipment/graphics10/Djarns_Amethyst_Ring.html">Djarn's Amethyist
Rings</a>!!!!. Again, an otherwise fantastic trip ran into problems trying to
bring a second wave of DOA'ers in to play. I think we need to re-think how we
are doing this (or even if we wanna try bringing in a second/later squad). Vessa
is taking a group to a Naggy hunt Wednesday night, if you are in that group, you
HAVE to be there and ready to go. Please get with Vessa and make sure you know
when and where. Have some new pictures that have been sent in, I'll try to get
them online soon.</p>

<p align="left">A big welcome to three new official members, Clair, Vencent, and
Tsunaron. Deadstone has been on a roll in Lguk, scoring 2 SSOYs and an SMR. DOA
invaded the Efreeti Lord again scoring 5 pairs of <a href="http://everquest.allakhazam.com/equipment/graphics10/Golden_Efreeti_Boots.html">Golden
Efreeti Boots</a>!!!!. A little accident marred an otherwise perfect trip, but
still it was a huge success. The recent trip to the Froglok King was long on
experience and <a href="http://everquest.allakhazam.com/equipment/graphics10/Crown_of_the_Froglok_Kings.html">Crown
of the Froglock Kings</a>, but no luck on the <a href="http://everquest.allakhazam.com/equipment/graphics3/Mithril_2_Handed_Sword.htm">Mithril
Two Handed Sword</a>. Nailed 2 more Ancient Cyclops in OOT, one right after
server updates. DOA is poised to invade the planes in a big way. At level 46+ or
nearing it we have Vessa, Kodiak, Tsun, Clair, Vencent, Pball, Tassic, Hawkk,
Blasttar, Nords, Lohy, Qwestlin, Holten, Beldwin, Deadstone, Bruiser, Hippod,
and I may have overlooked a few. Even with some of those on the same account,
looks like we can field 15 or so, not too shabby.</p>

<p align="center"><strong>Mar 02, 2000</strong></p>

<p align="left">Its been a busy 2 weeks. We've admitted several new members (welcome
Opheliany and Artanis), had some luck in Lower Guk in the Lord room (congrats to all the
new SSOY weilders), and have an important meeting Sunday to take a final vote on several
terrific new members. On a personal note I'd like to thank Clair, Kcin, Darkwyrm, Vencent,
Opheliany, and everyone else that has helped out on the COF and Cleric quests. Major
congrats to Blasttar (Hawkk's Wizzie) on level 50 and Nords on level 49, we'll be ducking
Ice Comets left and right now &lt;g&gt;. Been some major leveling with Deadstone,
Qwestlin, Lohy, and others my crummy memory is failing me on too. Give me a hard time over
this guys so I can get everyone mentioned. With all the hard work you guys are doing and
all the great new people coming in, I can't see much we can't accomplish. If we can keep
our traditional closeness and camaraderie, I believe we can be a bright and shining
example of how guilds should work. IRL update, as far as I'm concerned the third annual
DOA Labor Day brouhaha is a go for Labor Day weekend. Get with me for any information you
need on travel or whatever. Also, I've been asked several times when we are invading New
Orleans again. I'm up for it and ready when you guys are!!!!</p>

<p align="center"><strong>Feb 14, 2000</strong></p>

<p align="left">Happy Valentines day! We've had a fantastic run on camps lately.
Congratulations to all the DOA'ers that got <a href="http://everquest.allakhazam.com/equipment/graphics6/Shining_Metallic_Robes.htm">Shining
Metallic Robes</a> over the last few weeks. We had a wildly successful Efreeti Lord trip
turning up 8 pairs of <a href="http://everquest.allakhazam.com/equipment/graphics10/Golden_Efreeti_Boots.html">Golden
Efreeti Boots</a>!!!! Special thanks to all our friends that helped out. We're looking at
a camping trip for the tanks next, maybe the Froglock King for <a href="http://everquest.allakhazam.com/equipment/graphics10/Crown_of_the_Froglok_Kings.html">Crown
of the Froglock Kings</a> and <a href="http://everquest.allakhazam.com/equipment/graphics3/Mithril_2_Handed_Sword.htm">Mithril
Two Handed Sword</a>. Send in any suggestions. Note that Bertox Town hall no longer
schedules Dragons or the Efreeti (effective 2/7/00). That's why our scheduled hunt did not
appear on the calendar. Have some more screenshots to post. Hopefully will get those up
sometime this week. Another protracted Fear hunt went on last week. Lots of folks got gear
(the DOA participant got a <a href="http://everquest.allakhazam.com/equipment/graphics3/Thorny_Vine_Bracer.htm">Thorny
Vine Bracer</a>). The Dracolich and Cazic Thule were both vanquished and Cazic dropped our
servers first <a href="http://everquest.allakhazam.com/equipment/graphics4/Crimson_Robe_of_Alandine.htm">Crimson
Robe of Alendine</a>.</p>

<p align="left">Added some screen shots to the scrapbook, thanks Kodiak and Tiigeress for
the pictures. Added a Member Profiles section. Eventually this will have full member
information. While it's being developed and information is being colected, the Member
Profiles page will contain a gallery of member pictures. DOA'ers get those pictures sent
in ASAP. </p>

<p align="left"><a href="http://www.prophecyguild.com/eq">Prophecy</a>, <a href="http://company.mpguild.com">The Company</a>, and DOA (well 1 DOA'er &lt;g&gt;)
killed Lady Vox in Permafrost this evening. Prophecy has this dragon down to a science and
all went very smoothly with few deaths. DOA may have been sparsely repersented, but we did
get the killing blow on Lady Vox! Check out the <a href="scrapbook.htm">Scrapbook</a> for
a few screenshots.</p>

<p align="center"><strong>Jan 11, 2000</strong></p>

<p align="left">Our Mistmoore hunt was a success. The silly Ranger only got everyone
killed once (possibly a new record). Several <a href="http://216.155.25.102/equipment/graphics3/Nightshade_Wreath.htm">Nightshade Wreaths</a>,
quite a few <a href="http://216.155.25.102/equipment/graphics6/Cape_of_Midnight_Mist.htm">Cape
of the Midnight Mist</a>, a <a href="http://216.155.25.102/equipment/graphics9/Lute_of_the_Gypsy_Princess.html">Lute of
the Gypsy Princess</a>, and a <a href="http://216.155.25.102/equipment/graphics9/Mistmoore_Battle_Drums.html">Mistmoore
Battle Drum</a> were aquired. A few days ago a joint effort of Pont, Company, DOA, and
friends dropped&nbsp; Innoruuk again. We were also present during some of the nearly week
long total domination of the Plane of Fear. One lucky DOA Ranger aquired a <a href="http://216.155.25.102/equipment/graphics6/Fluxbladed_Axe.htm">Fluxbladed Axe</a>, <a href="http://216.155.25.102/equipment/graphics3/Thorny_Vine_Gauntlets.htm">Thorny Vine
Gauntlets</a>, and <a href="http://216.155.25.102/equipment/graphics3/Thorny_Vine_Boots.htm">Thorny Vine Boots</a>.
Thanks to Ascendants for the great job breaking into the zone, the tireless effort keeping
it broken, and the invitations to participate.</p>

<p align="center"><strong>Jan 5, 2000</strong></p>

<p align="left">Made a little change to the guest book to keep the comments in a seperate
file. This should keep me from accidently wiping out the entrys when I update &lt;g&gt;.
Will be adding some goodies from the recent POF hunt soon. Don't forget Aly's Mistmoore
hunt scheduled for Saturday morning. I bet we can set up several shifts and keep this hunt
going quite awhile. Also please try to make the meeting Sunday afternoon.</p>

last night. Only a few deaths on initial break in and only ONE massive death train all
evening culminated in the death of the Maestro of Rancor. He dropped a <a href="http://216.155.25.102/equipment/graphics8/Kelin's_Seven_Stringed_Lute.html">Kelin's

accomplishment of the evening, THE RANGER ONLY DIED TWICE!!!! &lt;g&gt;</p>

<p align="center"><strong>Dec 29, 1999</strong></p>

<p align="left">The guest book was not functioning. This has been corrected and I've
redesigned it a little to be less cumbersome. Hopefully I'll be able to restore the old
comments from backups I have stored somewhere &lt;g&gt;</p>

<p align="center"><strong>Dec 28,1999</strong></p>

<p align="left">The DOA server hosted mailing list is operational. It is <a href="mailto:news@doaguild.com">news@doaguild.com</a>. A little easier to remember than
the old one huh? Vessa and I (Holt) also have email addresses set up on the web server. <a href="mailto:holt@doaguild.com">holt@doaguild.com</a> and <a href="mailto:vessa@doaguild.com">vessa@doaguild.com</a>. Please email either of us
addresses to be added to the mailing list or any other guild/web-page related information.</p>

<p align="left">Together with <a href="http://24.72.22.158/">Pontificate Lusus</a> and <a href="http://company.mpguild.com">The Company</a> (and Clair from <a href="http://www.prophecyguild.com/eq">Prophecy</a>), DOA participated in the first
slaying of&nbsp; Innoruuk, The God of Hate on&nbsp; Bertoxxulous server. The loot from the
God was a little sparse (Wand of Diamonds [10/30 1HB casts diamond skin, wizard], Wand of
Souls [necromancer], <a href="http://216.155.25.102/equipment/graphics10/Dawnchaser.html">Dawnchaser</a>
Spear [11/25 piercing, bard], A Scythe [ 30/42 +10 int,shadow knight no SKs on the trip,
didn't get the name of the item], page [enchanter research item]), but a great time was
had by all.</p>

<p align="left"><a href="http://ascendants.cjb.net">Ascendants</a>, <a href="http://prime-fe1.lvcablemodem.com/hlrzr900/arcane">Arcane Dominion</a>, and assorted
others have taken the Plane of Fear and slain Cazic Thule. They 37 hour ordeal climaxed
with the slaying of a god, but was quickly anticlimaxed by everyone being slaughtered by
mobs that had regenerated during the fight. I believe one Rainbow shield was looted off of
Cazic before everyone was killed. Major congrats to all those involved in the second
slaying of a god on Bertoxxulous server. </p>

<p align="left">Ascendants, <a href="http://prime-fe1.lvcablemodem.com/hlrzr900/arcane">Arcane
Dominion</a>, <a href="http://company.mpguild.com">The Company</a>, DOA, and a host of
others participated in the second slaying of the dragon Nagafen. 2 Cloaks of flame, an Orb
of Tishan and a Selo's drum were looted. This was the first dragon hunt in which DOA
participated.</p>

<p align="left">Hawkk is the first DOA to score a pair of SSoY's. Congrats!</p>
