I've spoken with some other folks who have used them without any problems, and also with some others who had issues with their service. All I'm doing here is relaying my experience and you can make your own decisions about using them or not.


I needed to purchase a new video card, power supply, and an extra stick of ram in order to play EQ2. The video card particularly was a rush priority since I couldn't play EQ2 at all without it. I had decided to purchase an nvidia 6800 GT-based card.

buy.com listed the item as in-stock with 1-2day shipping. I placed the order and requested express shipping. On their order status page they claim to go through three steps.

payment processing (verify your credit card info), sent-to-warehouse, and shipped/on-order

The reserve hold for the entire purchase was immediately placed on my debit card (although they don't actually submit charges until an item ships). The ram and power supply shipped immediately, but for some reason the video card item remained in the 'payment processing' step rather than going to the warehouse for fulfillment.

I had two different sets of email communications with their CS reps (dontbuy.com doesn't have telephone customer support... it's email-only) trying to find out why the order hadn't been sent to the warehouse, and all I got was "we're still processing your order".

A week later they finally sent the order to the warehouse but by then the item was out of stock (or else it was out of stock to begin with and their inventory system is so fouled up they can't keep their numbers straight) so the item went into back-order status.

Since I needed a card ASAP to play EQ2 I emailed to ask them when they expected they would receive a fresh supply and be able to fulfill my order. It turns out they have no way to tell when they expect to receive back-ordered goods (no tracking of their own inbound orders).

So I cancelled the item (I thought), and sent an email asking them to remove the reserve hold on my debit card so I could go buy a videocard somewhere else. They confirmed that they had received my cancellation request, and said they would not remove the hold but that I would have to wait for the bank to automatically expire it (3 business days for my bank) when they failed to submit a charge.

I took some cash out of savings to buy a card at the local Bestbuy, and eventually the hold did roll off my debit card freeing up the cash in my checking account. And I thought the whole debacle was over. Until today.

I got an email from (don't!) buy.com that my order had finally shipped, hurray!! Only what had shipped was the item I had cancelled nearly a month ago, and they had already charged the debit card the $400 for the item. So now that cash, which was supposed to be going for Christmas gifts, will be tied up until the shipment gets returned to them and they get around to crediting the account.

Which event I expect will occur coincidentally with pigs flying out of my butt.

Their response to my rather hasty and very aggro email today -- the 10th or so email I've had with them regarding this order -- was 'sorry but we can't cancel items that are on back-order'. What a crock of horsepucky.

Bottom line is they have zero control over their supply chain, their customer service stinks, and if you do ever have any problems with an order you're basically SOL.

Anyway, based on this personal experience I will not ever be doing business with them again. And I just thought I would share my little trials in case it might help someone else avoid suffering the same kind of problems I have been having dealing with this vendor.
