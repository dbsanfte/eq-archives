<p>&gt;Perhaps I am speaking out of place, since I am relatively new to DOA, 

<p> Nosir, everyone's voice is important. Even paladins. 

<p> &gt;I feel it is important to have strong bonds with &gt;your brothers, willing to
risk life and gear to &gt;help in a crisis. 

<p> That certainly is one of our strengths. {{Hey Flagg! Played with any Kragens nekkid
lately, hehe}} 

<p> &gt;At Thursday meeting Kvasir said. &quot;Damn, I can't &gt;keep up with everyone
anymore!&quot; 

<p> He is a barbarian, don't expect too much memory there. Besides, I'm pretty sure he was
kidding. 

<p> &gt;I understand the reason for class leaders, and &gt;it was a great idea, but I feel
it doesnt make &gt;it acceptable to get too big. 

<p> TOO BIG is definatly a problem, true. But we have 27 members, 7 of whom aren't around
or are in bad standing with the guild. (I think thats correct). 20 members really isnt a
lot, I think we're in pretty good shape now. Your warning not too expand too rapidly is
wise of course. My point is that we are at a pretty godo point now, and i think there is
room for a handful of additional, quality poeple. 

<p> &gt;If we have a 15-18 person guild with REGULAR &gt;active members we have plenty...
to do some of &gt;the more difficult lairs. 

<p> For the longest time that was the intent, but due to RW issues, people vanishing, etc.
we often found that we lacked the numbers online at any given time to do many lairs. So we
decided grow. So we added some new members and we gruesome. &lt;g&gt;. 

<p> &gt;...MOY or SRD, who was recruiting anyone and &gt;everyone of the street. 

<p> We are still quite picky in our standards. 

<p> &gt;This is nothing personal against the newer &gt;members of DOA. Just some opinions
from a pally &gt;:) Flagg___DOA 

<p> Congrats to Flagg for having the first post!
