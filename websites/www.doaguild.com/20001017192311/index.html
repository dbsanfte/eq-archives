<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">Been too long since the last update. We've
had several very successful planes hunts (kudos to Pball and Vessa), been
blessed with</font>
<br><font face="Comic Sans MS">some new additions to our family (YEA!!!
Iostream, Obsidia, Sshatz, Dunncan, Jarlaxis and the others that I will
feel terrible for</font>
<br><font face="Comic Sans MS">overlooking), and have some terrific new
prospects. If you are not receiving email from our mailing list, please

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">After a short few hours of trials and very
positive feedback, I ordered the registered version of the forum software
we were</font>
<br><font face="Comic Sans MS">testing. The full blown version has some
features that Vessa was already requesting, so I've installed and configured
the registered</font>
<br><font face="Comic Sans MS">software. We now have a private members
only forum. I will be giving DOA'ers direct access to the private areas
as soon as you</font>
<br><font face="Comic Sans MS">register (just post a message and it will
walk you through the sign-up procedure). To access the private areas right
away, use the</font>
<br><font face="Comic Sans MS">password we use in the Everquest chat rooms
for our guild meetings. After you register and I set your access level,
you will not have to use this special password.</font>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">I've installed new forum software and have
it working. Please play around with it and let me know what you think.
DOA was invited</font>
<br><font face="Comic Sans MS">to go play on the Plane of Hate Monday night.
Two forces went in, picked opposite sides, cleared the mobs, and met in
the middle to</font>
<br><font face="Comic Sans MS">kill Innoruuk. The loot included a Druid
shield, several Magician pieces, Enchanter arms, and Cleric pieces for
our side. Inny was</font>
<br><font face="Comic Sans MS">kind enough to give up a Bryarzephyr, Bloodmoon,
and a Diamond Rod. A good time was had by all. Thanks Iila for inviting
us. Good</font>
<br><font face="Comic Sans MS">job Neuroth and Iila on organizing the hunt.</font>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">DOA and friends had a very successful expedition
to the Plane of Hate Saturday. An otherwise great experience was marred
by</font>
<br><font face="Comic Sans MS">some hunt scheduling problems, but hopefully
those will all be corrected for future trips. A big thank you to all our
friends that</font>
<br><font face="Comic Sans MS">came along to bonk bad guys and congrats
to those that won some planes goodies. Pending any email votes still to
be received, Njall,</font>
<br><font face="Comic Sans MS">Zhyla, and Ramja welcome to DOA. Divanna
and Pyrge have applied for DOA membership and have been/wiil be temp tagged,
please look for them in Guildchat and introduce yourselves.</font>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">DOA intruded on the Efreeti Lord yet again
scoring 2 pairs of Golden Efreeti Boots and 2 Djarn's Amethyist Rings!!!!.
Again, an</font>
<br><font face="Comic Sans MS">otherwise fantastic trip ran into problems
trying to bring a second wave of DOA'ers in to play. I think we need to
re-think how we are doing this (or even if we wanna try bringing in a second/later
squad). Vessa is taking a group to a Naggy hunt Wednesday night, if you
are in that group, you HAVE to be there and ready to go. Please get with
Vessa and make sure you know when and where. Have some new pictures that
have been sent in, I'll try to get them online soon.</font>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">A big welcome to three new official members,
Clair, Vencent, and Tsunaron. Deadstone has been on a roll in Lguk, scoring
2 SSOYs</font>
<br><font face="Comic Sans MS">and an SMR. DOA invaded the Efreeti Lord
again scoring 5 pairs of Golden Efreeti Boots!!!!. A little accident marred
an otherwise</font>
<br><font face="Comic Sans MS">perfect trip, but still it was a huge success.
The recent trip to the Froglok King was long on experience and Crown of
the Froglock</font>
<br><font face="Comic Sans MS">Kings, but no luck on the Mithril Two Handed
Sword. Nailed 2 more Ancient Cyclops in OOT, one right after server updates.
DOA is poised to invade the planes in a big way. At level 46+ or nearing
it we have Vessa, Kodiak, Tsun, Clair, Vencent, Pball, Tassic, Hawkk, Blasttar,
Nords, Lohy, Qwestlin, Holten, Beldwin, Deadstone, Bruiser, Hippod, and
I may have overlooked a few. Even with some of those on the same account,
looks like we can field 15 or so, not too shabby.</font>

<p><b><font face="Comic Sans MS">Mar 02, 2000</font></b></center>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">Its been a busy 2 weeks. We've admitted several
new members (welcome Opheliany and Artanis), had some luck in Lower Guk
in the Lord room (congrats to all the new SSOY weilders), and have an important
meeting Sunday to take a final vote on several terrific new members. On
a personal note I'd like to thank Clair, Kcin, Darkwyrm, Vencent, Opheliany,
and everyone else that has helped out on the COF and Cleric quests. Major
congrats to Blasttar (Hawkk's Wizzie) on level 50 and Nords on level 49,
we'll be ducking Ice Comets left and right now &lt;g>. Been some major
leveling with Deadstone, Qwestlin, Lohy, and others my crummy memory is
failing me on too. Give me a hard time over this guys so I can get everyone
mentioned. With all the hard work you guys are doing and all the great
new people coming in, I can't see much we can't accomplish. If we can keep
our traditional closeness and camaraderie, I believe we can be a bright
and shining example of how guilds should work. IRL update, as far as I'm
concerned the third annual DOA Labor Day brouhaha is a go for Labor Day
weekend. Get with me for any information you need on travel or whatever.
Also, I've been asked several times when we are invading New Orleans again.
I'm up for it and ready when you guys are!!!!</font>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">Happy Valentines day! We've had a fantastic
run on camps lately. Congratulations to all the DOA'ers that got Shining
Metallic</font>
<br><font face="Comic Sans MS">Robes over the last few weeks. We had a
wildly successful Efreeti Lord trip turning up 8 pairs of Golden Efreeti
Boots!!!! Special</font>
<br><font face="Comic Sans MS">thanks to all our friends that helped out.
We're looking at a camping trip for the tanks next, maybe the Froglock
King for Crown of the Froglock Kings and Mithril Two Handed Sword. Send
in any suggestions. Note that Bertox Town hall no longer schedules Dragons
or the Efreeti (effective 2/7/00). That's why our scheduled hunt did not
appear on the calendar. Have some more screenshots to post. Hopefully will
get those up sometime this week. Another protracted Fear hunt went on last
week. Lots of folks got gear (the DOA participant got a Thorny Vine Bracer).
The Dracolich and Cazic Thule were both vanquished and Cazic dropped our
servers first Crimson Robe of Alendine.</font>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">Added some screen shots to the scrapbook,
thanks Kodiak and Tiigeress for the pictures. Added a Member Profiles section.</font>
<br><font face="Comic Sans MS">Eventually this will have full member information.
While it's being developed and information is being colected, the Member
Profiles page will contain a gallery of member pictures. DOA'ers get those
pictures sent in ASAP.</font>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">Prophecy, The Company, and DOA (well 1 DOA'er
&lt;g>) killed Lady Vox in Permafrost this evening. Prophecy has this dragon
down to a science and all went very smoothly with few deaths. DOA may have
been sparsely repersented, but we did get the killing blow on Lady Vox!
Check out the Scrapbook for a few screenshots.</font>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">Our Mistmoore hunt was a success. The silly
Ranger only got everyone killed once (possibly a new record). Several Nightshade</font>
<br><font face="Comic Sans MS">Wreaths, quite a few Cape of the Midnight
Mist, a Lute of the Gypsy Princess, and a Mistmoore Battle Drum were aquired.
A few</font>
<br><font face="Comic Sans MS">days ago a joint effort of Pont, Company,
DOA, and friends dropped&nbsp; Innoruuk again. We were also present during
some of the</font>
<br><font face="Comic Sans MS">nearly week long total domination of the
Plane of Fear. One lucky DOA Ranger aquired a Fluxbladed Axe, Thorny Vine
Gauntlets,</font>
<br><font face="Comic Sans MS">and Thorny Vine Boots. Thanks to Ascendants
for the great job breaking into the zone, the tireless effort keeping it
broken, and the invitations to participate.</font>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">Made a little change to the guest book to
keep the comments in a seperate file. This should keep me from accidently
wiping out the</font>
<br><font face="Comic Sans MS">entrys when I update &lt;g>. Will be adding
some goodies from the recent POF hunt soon. Don't forget Aly's Mistmoore
hunt scheduled for Saturday morning. I bet we can set up several shifts
and keep this hunt going quite awhile. Also please try to make the meeting
Sunday afternoon.</font>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">DOA, Pontificate Lusus, The Company, Prophecy
and friends ruled on the Plane of Hate last night. Only a few deaths on
initial break in and only ONE massive death train all evening culminated
in the death of the Maestro of Rancor. He dropped a Kelin's Seven Stringed
Lute: Stringed Instrument. +9 dex, +15 char, +9 agil Bard only (congrats
Bozco), Mempo of Likato: Effect of Ultravision. Wt. 0.1. magic, lore, no
drop. Monk only (congrats Weirleader), and 2 spell research components.
Several pieces of Cleric gear dropped, A Darkmetal Holy Water Sprinkler:
Damage 16, Delay 29. +4 wis. Wt. 7.5. Paladin only (all the paladins present
already had, so it was unclaimed), and Enchanter sleeves (Congrats Clair).
I think the sleeves are the Enchanter only replacement for Cryosilk and
are Int +7 Hp +15 Cha +3 Sv Fire +9, I'll get the name and verify the info
tonight. The major accomplishment of the evening, THE RANGER ONLY DIED
TWICE!!!! &lt;g></font>

others have taken the Plane of Fear and slain Cazic Thule. They 37 hour
ordeal climaxed with the slaying of a god, but was quickly anticlimaxed
by everyone being slaughtered by mobs that had regenerated during the fight.
I believe one Rainbow shield was looted off of Cazic before everyone was
killed. Major congrats to all those involved in the second slaying of a
god on Bertoxxulous server.</font>

DOA, and a host of others participated in the second slaying of the dragon
