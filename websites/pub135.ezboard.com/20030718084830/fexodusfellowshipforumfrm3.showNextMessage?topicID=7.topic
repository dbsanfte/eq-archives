The path lead to a steep hill, with jagged rocks sticking out here and there, with no set pattern.  The hill it’s self appeared to be about 400 meters to the top.  The hill by its self wasn’t unusual, but rather what seemed to be a cave entrance, is what struck me as odd.  It was carved, it would seem, from the solid rock held within the hillside.  Overall, the hill seemed to possess a magical aura.<br>
           <br>
      I tip toed up to the hole, ever so cautious, I’d heard of men who had foolishly walked up to caves and gotten their heads ripped off, and wasn’t going to chance it.  Ever so carefully, I slide my eyes closer to the cave.  Finally I could see down the cave, and felt foolish, there was nothing dangerous there, not even a cobweb, which I thought to be odd.  Upon further inspection, I noticed, this cave was used very often, as if it was a path to some place.<br>
        I crouched back, and sat down.  This must be the way to the town, I thought, as I pulled out a text to refer to quickly.  I looked over the tabs I placed throughout the book, and choose the one I was looking for.  Ah, yes, here it was…”upon a hill lies the entrance to the fair city of the Little Folk, the hill is tall in the standards of the Little Folk, but more of an obstacle to other races.  The entrance it self is nothing spectacular, just a cave. But if you inspect it further you can see how carefully it was sculpted out of the earth…”<br>
        Well, the only thing left to do was to walk through.  I stood up, stepped into the cave, and then remembered something.  If I was going to be seen, I better not look like a hideous freak of nature.  I removed my cloak, my chain mail vest, and the cap.  I then took out my fancy vest that a girl from Fionia Vie gave to me once, after, well…  I grinned at myself, put some hair gel in my hair, then put on my sunglasses.  Satisfied with my appearance, I walked onwards.<br>
        The cave had a serious problem with it, there was a crack running the length of it, as if the stress from the weight was winning over the strength of the cave ceiling.  That wasn’t my problem though.  All I had to do now was find the guy, kill him and take the head back to the old man.  Hopefully the guy will be easy to find my girl from back home in Kelethin was expecting me home soon.  I put my thoughts to rest as I began to exit the cave.<br>
        What wonders beheld my eyes left me in complete awe, until one of the little hobbits spoke to me.  Still amazed at what I saw, I didn’t reply, which made the hobbit gaze at me as if to say “well?”<br>
 After spitting out what were attempts of words, I finally fell upon a word that my mouth could form.<br>
        “Ahja, beha, ahh, Howdy!”<br>
        “What might we be searching for, now?” the hobbit questioned me.<br>
        “Err, hmmm, bar?”<br>
        “Ah, we gots us one of those!  Finest in the land some say, course better watch ya pockets in there, some of the quickest fingers dwell in that place.  But the ale, ahh the ale is the best surely!”  The hobbit explained to me.  “Say, why don’t have pick up ya jaw off the ground before me scare crow rip it off ya head, and follow me?”<br>
        The hobbit was referring to which I was amazed at, for before me stood a scarecrow.  What was different from another scarecrow was this one was walking about a small little patch of a garden.  “Errr, are you sure?  I could wander around this place until I find it, I wouldn’t want to take you away from your daily duties.”  I told the hobbit trying to get away from his attention.<br>
        “Why yes I am sure!  Its not often strangers other than druids wander into this town, and gudoos to the hobbit which finds that stranger first and bares him to the town!”<br>
        “Well if you insist.” I said with the cheesest grin.<br>
True to what he said, the hobbit paraded me in front of the town’s people, while on the way to the bar.  This was quiet different from what I had planned to do, but being the rogue that I am, I played it to my advantage.  I took in the face of ever hobbit I saw, searching for my target.  I began to notice that these hobbits had many different types among them.  Some taller than the rest, and stout, which seemed to be farmers, others shorter than the rest, and wielding swords and shields, so I assumed the local militia.  Going by city hall, I became under the scrutiny of many druids, some that I had seen back in the Commonlands.  This made me only grin.<br>
Now my hobbit guide lead me towards the tallest building in the town, which read “Fool’s Gold”.  This I assumed to be the local, bar and inn.  It appeared to be in need of a fresh coat of paint, but who was I to tell a owner that he needed to fix his place up a bit, then ask, “oh can I get a room?” it just wasn’t my place in life.  The door stood ajar, which a tarnished spittoon held open.<br>
         “This be the place my new found friend, may you find it suitable to your drinking needs, the owner’s name is Gibbon, if you need anything from him, just ask, he is the only hobbit in this place who doesn’t tell the tales of other men.” The hobbit assured me.<br>
         “Thank you good Sir, may Tunare bring flourishing crops to your field.” I said with a smile to the hobbit.<br>
         “Aye!” he replied as he wandered off to probably tell his friends more about how I had gotten here.<br>
          I now used my rogue skills to slide into the bar quietly.  As I stepped into the bar, a musty, stale air hit me like a bag of doorknobs to the nose.  A dark figure far across the bar then noticed me as I sniffed the air.  Not wanting to draw attention to me, I stopped trying to be sneaky and walked over to the stool next to the figure.  As I sat at the bar table, I eyed the room about me.  In the middle of the room, four hobbits sat about a table near the fire.  They seemed to be enjoying their ale and story telling, which large outbursts of laughter now and then.<br>
           I now spoke to the figure. “You notice me while I sneak, not only is the unusual, but odd in a place like this, what shall I call this town anyway?”<br>
           “Ah, the question of the ages, River Vale is its name, and any rogue notices the work of another brother, especially in the home of rogues.”<br>
          “So it is true what I heard, many quick hands dwell in this place?”<br>
           “Aye, if that is what you wish to call them, I would prefer unseen hands though, for that describes them better.”<br>
             “Why the garb, this seems like the safest of towns, safe enough to not hide in the darkest corner of the town with the darkest clothing, even when in fear of life and limb.”<br>
              The figure turned away from me, as if in fear.  Unknown to him, I had recognized him.  What luck had I, to wander into the pub first off and to find my target.  Since he had no other words to tell me, I stood up, and walked over to the owner.  The owner was a short fat little hobbit, with the hairiest feet I had ever seen, truly in need of shaving.  I exchanged a few words with him, and platinum, and ended up with a room for a couple of nights.  He handed me a key, and I strode up to my room.<br>
        The room was simple, a small window, a wooden table, a chest, and a bed.  On the table there was a key for the chest, which I quickly took, and unlocked the chest.  Then I grabbed a candle from my bag, placed it on the table.  A swift breeze blew in through the window, and lapped at my hair, and I smelled the crisp cool smell of rain in the air.  I leaned out the windows, and was about to pull the shutters closed when below me out walked a hooded hobbit, which continually glanced about him as he walked away from the inn.  I grinned happily to myself and closed the shutters to the window, seconds before a rain began to drizzle on the town.<br>
        What luck I had, Bristlebane truly takes care of his favorite rogues, I thought to myself as I lay on the bed for a bit of rest.  I made plans in my mind for the money I was to earn from this.  After nightfall and the town had closed, I would sneak in, find out where my hobbit lived, sneak into his house, remove his second favorite body part, and make for the Commonlands during the night.  With even more good luck, I would be back in Freeport with the head by noon tomorrow, with 600 platinum burning a hole in my coin sac, while heading over to turn in the head for an additional 300 platinum.  The old man wouldn’t have a clue before it was too late and he himself was lost before my spear.  I sighed to myself in complete bliss and I dozed off into a dream.<br>
