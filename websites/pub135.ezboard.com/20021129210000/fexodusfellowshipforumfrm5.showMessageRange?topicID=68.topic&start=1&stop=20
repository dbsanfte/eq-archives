While the document remains largely his, there are substantial modifications to deal with known changes since the last update of his doc, as well as the specifics of the raid we are planning. Note that the buffs list is almost certainly in error, and I?d love to see corrections to that before raid time.<br>
<br>
Lady Vox Raid<br>
<br>
LEVELS 45-52 for main attack/heal parties<br>
       53+ for Support<br>
       We MAY take clerics as low as 39 with CH if no other choices present themselves, but understand up front that this is seen as substantially less than optimal due to AoE fear issues.<br>
<br>
SPECIAL CONSIDERATIONS: An unbuffed Magic Resistance of 50 and a Cold Resistance of 100. The higher the better.<br>
Vox?s AOE Cold and AOE Fear are devastating. AC should be willingly sacrificed as needed to get those resists up ? your AC is meaningless if you?re already dead from the AoE?s.<br>
<br>
Peridots are spendy, and  will be supplied for Clerics/Chanters by the primary beneficiaries of the raid (Sing, and others as may be deemed in need by the raid leader).<br>
<br>
LOOT DISTRIBUTION: <br>
White Scale, if dropped, goes first to Sing for his epic. Additional white scales if dropped (sometimes there are two) be rolled on by other bards attending. If there is none, it will be looted, sold, and proceeds distributed to the vaults of the participating guilds in a proportional fashion.<br>
Other Vox items will be rolled on using the bid and Raid Leader rolls method limited to usable or highly preferred classes. Additional bid points may, at the RL?s sole discreation, be awarded to certain classes for some items in order to deal with class preferences on an item. Under this plan, toons can determine which items they wish to ?bid? on. When they bid, they are assigned a number by the RL. The RL then offers a last call, and makes a role between 1 and the number of bid points in play. Whoever has the assigned number that matches the role wins. The winner receives no further loot from the main kill. The losers are allowed to bid again only after all other users have used up all their bids. Again, you must be of a class that can use the item in order to bid on it.<br>
<br>
Travel:<br>
Three travel times will be arranged to span over the day before and the hours immediately before the raid. All travel to the site is expected to be completed by 30 minutes before raid time. If not enough people have arrived by that time, the raid will be cancelled. If others wish to attend, they will need to find their own transportation, and the raid will not wait for them.<br>
<br>
ITEMS OF NOTE<br>
1. Vox is a level 55 Dragon with Cleric spells.<br>
2. Vox's most deadly weapon is her AE cold breath and AE fear spell. Wear as much MR/CR gear as possible; sacrifice all other statistics (yes, even AC) to get these as high as possible.<br>
3. Check your resist gear. If you don't have much, consider acquiring:<br>
2xPlatinum Peridot Ring (AC4 CR10), <br>
Cloak of the Icebear (AC8 HP10 CR20),<br>
Rune Boned Fork (MR10 CR10 FR10), <br>
Crown of the Froglok King (AC12 CR20 FR20), <br>
Velium Round Shield (AC15 CR10), <br>
Gnomish Environmental Suit (AC9 FR10 CR10 PR10). <br>
<br>
There are a wealth of other items available, so check the bazaar.<br>
 <br>
4. Many of the mobs in Permafrost have high cold resist - including Vox, use fire based spells where possible for minimum resists.<br>
5. In order to cast any spell on Vox - YOU MUST BE WITHIN HER MELEE RANGE.<br>
6. Let me say this again: In order to cast any spell on Vox - YOU MUST BE WITHIN HER MELEE RANGE.<br>
<br>
THINGS YOU CAN DO AHEAD TO HELP THE EXPEDITE THE PROCESS:<br>
1. Get your MR/CR gear ready in backpacks so that it is ready to equip quickly.<br>
2. Check with friends if they would like to attend raid. Lining up some backups can make the difference in going ahead versus rescheduling a raid. We are inviting toons from 5 guilds to this raid, but finding toons in just the right level range is a challenge, so, if you have friends in that range and they are interested, have them sign up, and we?d be glad to have them.<br>
3a. If you are nice enough to get there early (say the day before) Kill Ice Giants. 3 are located outside Permafrost and others are inside the zone. All yield decent experience and loot even for low 50s.<br>
3b. Get CR bracers. The Ice Goblin King has &quot;Symbols of Loyalty to Vox&quot; bracers AC7 CR7. They aren't lore, so opportunists often stock up on them and sell to others before the fight. If someone on this raid is such an opportunist, they?ll be booted from the raid and reported to their guild.<br>
3c. Get CR leggings. Elite Goblin Guards occasionally have AC8 CR5 legs, but anyone at the levels of this raid should be able to do better.<br>
3d. If you don't have one, get a weight reduction backpack off Goblin Archeologist.<br>
3e. Stay in the area and build factions. Kill Black Burrow gnolls for druid &amp; Qeynos factions. Collect teeth, and turn in 4 at a time to female warrior near PvP area in Halas for barbarian factions.<br>
3f. Camp in Qeynos Hills for the Fishbone Earring or the Glowing Black Stone.<br>
<br>
SPECIFIC PLAN<br>
ALL: /JOIN EFVox<br>
Clerics and Melee group memebers: /JOIN EFVoxHeal<br>
Note that this channel should only be used if you need a<br>
  heal from outside your group or if you are a cleric that <br>
  needs to communicate with external healers.<br>
RL and Group Leaders: /JOIN EFVoxLeads<br>
<br>
STAGING PHASE<br>
1. When you are in Everfrost or Permafrost, report in to the Raid leader in the time period of 1 hour to 30 min before raid, please report in in the format of:<br>
&lt;toon name&gt; &lt;class&gt; &lt;level&gt; &lt;Exact location&gt;<br>
2. The raid leader may tell if the raid is short of certain classes. Check with friends if asked.<br>
3. Turn off anonymous and role when you show up. I will not necessarily know the levels and classes of all toons attending, and I need to be able to know what I have. I will be taking notes as people check in, but I need this fallback please.<br>
4. Assemble near Goblin King for temporary groups. Please have a map handy ahead of time.<br>
5. If you are looking for action while waiting, kill Ice Giants. These are all on random timers and yield decent exp and loot. STAY CLOSE FOR START OF RAID!<br>
6. It may take a while for the raid leader to work out final groups and the attack plan, especially if the raid is short of people in critical areas (clerics, enchanters, bards, nukers). PLEASE BE PATIENT!!!!<br>
<br>
<br>
KILLING VOX'S GUARDS PHASE<br>
1. Once enough people are present, final groups will be assigned.<br>
2. Unless you are being directed to pull, stay in the King Area.<br>
3. The main and secondary assists will be named. Create a hotkey for each.<br>
4. While Sing is the raid leader, a backup leader will be named in case of LD or other problem. Take instructions from either leader.<br>
5. Form into final groups. Write down all members on paper for future reference (with so many people, it may be difficult to target someone with a mouse, so just use the &quot;/target [name]&quot; command). Remember the F1-F6 keys to target inside your group, and consider hotkeys if you will need to target people outside your group.<br>
6. The Pullers will begin pulling the guards from Vox's chamber to the groups. This phase is often tricky and the puller may die from inadvertent Vox agros. All these mobs are on an approximate 4 hour timer. There will be<br>
a countdown on each of the guards as they are killed (i.e., Pulling guard 1 of 5). When the last guard is killed, the groups will move to the safe spot in the hallway just to the west of Vox's chambers. Once this phase starts, please do not go afk.<br>
7. The raid leader will announce &quot;Prepare to move&quot;.<br>
8. The raid leader will announce &quot;Move&quot;. All groups will move to the waiting area near the lair. If you have never been to the safe spot, DO NOT RUN AHEAD. There are invisible pit traps that will result in a quick death in<br>
the pits below.<br>
9. Nuking casters will bind in the camp spot, so that in death, can mem critical spells and jump back into the fight. 10. We will go through the entire attack plan and buffing information at this point. <br>
The two key things to stress are: <br>
(1)        NEVER PUSH VOX ON A WALL <br>
(2)        IF YOU FALL INTO PIT, STAY THERE AND DIE.<br>
<br>
BUFFING PHASE<br>
1. A list of casters will be named #1-14 and will correspond to the buff number.<br>
2. Go to your graphic and filter options and turn everything off or to minimum (spell effects, level of detail, damage shield messages, etc). With this many toons and spells going off everywhere, lag may be terrible, so insure yourself by turning off everything you don?t absolutely need.<br>
3. All non-buffers will be stripped of all buffs.<br>
4. Once stripped, all buffers &amp; all bards will disband from the groups.<br>
Temporary buffer groups will be formed. This group will move slightly up the ramp to be easier to find. (Clarity should be kept on all buffers and teamed with bards. If there are 2 or more necros, keep chloro and bard singing mana/heal so that the necros can pump mana).<br>
5. The raid leader will call out a group to get buffed. This group should move to the buff groups and get all of the buffs listed in the next step.<br>
The RL will a peridot to the cleric and the enchanter when ready for those buffs.<br>
6. The buffs will be done in mana/time order to maximize buff time.<br>
#01 caster - 1 junk buff (e.g. resist fire)<br>
#02 caster - 1 junk buff (e.g. resist poison)<br>
#03 caster - 1 junk buff (e.g. resist disease)<br>
#04 caster - 1 junk buff (e.g. ultravision) - rangers may want to do &quot;call of sky&quot; for stun proc.<br>
#05 shaman - talisman of altuna - HP238 (250mana - 72min)<br>
#06 shaman - stamina - STA37 (~100HP) (100 - 63min)<br>
#07 cleric - symbol of naltron - HP525 Peridot (315mana - 54min)<br>
#08 cleric - shield of words - AC32 (300 - 72min)<br>
#09 cleric -  Group Aego ? AC69 HP1300 Peridot (2000 mana ? 150 min)<br>
#10 enchanter - rune IV / V - DMG620/700 Peridot (350mana - 110min)<br>
#11 enchanter - group resist magic - MR55 (200mana - 36min)<br>
#12 enchanter - haste / clarity - (185mana - 16min/75mana - 27min)<br>
#13 druid - circle of summer - group CR45 (150mana - 36min)<br>
#14 druid - chloro (200mana - 15min)<br>
#15 open - for bard resist song<br>
7. Note: depending on classes attending, necros can also do resist cold and druids could do resist magic.<br>
8. Once buffed, the group should move slightly past the buffing group, disband, and camp out. Log into an alt and rejoin EFVox. Wait here until someone gets on and says everyone should log back.<br>
10. Once everyone has been buffed, the temporary groups will buff themselves and recover mana.<br>
11. Someone will tell EFVox that the attack will start momentarily. Give group leaders 30 seconds head start.<br>
12. When you log back in - turn on WALK. Vox will cast fear, and it is best to be walk mode. If you have run mode on and vox fears you, you may wind up in the bear pits.<br>
13. Reform final groups.<br>
14. Any class that has a pet should summon one.<br>
<br>
ASSAULTING VOX<br>
1. Only the raid leader and/or backup leader will shout attack instructions.<br>
Smooth raids are ones where everyone knows what to do and follows instructions.<br>
2. RL: &quot;Everyone move to rock!&quot;. Everyone moves up to the rock entering her chamber.<br>
3. RL: &quot;Prepare for attack on the count of 3!&quot;. Bards should start to play either Elemental Rhythms with a drum (which should add approximately 71MR, 71CR, and 71FR depending on level and drum used).<br>
4. RL: &quot;Main tank groups attack!&quot;. The main tank groups (1-3) will rush Vox, activate disciplines (if you have them), surround her, and attack. Bards will not attack with hand-to-hand (insignficant melee damage and Vox ripostes can cause significant damage). The safest place for a bard to fight will be directly below Vox's stomach near her hind legs. If lag is minimal and it is possible, twist Guardian Rythms ( 71MR and 10AC), or other buffs.<br>
5. Healers for the tank groups will remain near the rock entrance.<br>
6. If for any reason, you get feared and find yourself in the pits, stay there and die. Do not bring more mobs to the fight.<br>
7. A major key to killing Vox is to not push her onto a wall. IF VOX GETS PUSHED ONTO A WALL SHE WILL STAND THERE, HEAL HERSELF, AND SUMMON PEOPLE.<br>
Those that are between Vox and the nearest wall should not taunt. If you are near the wall and are the current agro, move away from the wall. Please watch for any yells to GET AWAY FROM THE WALL ? if you see a yell, think about it and make sure it?s not you we?re yelling at!<br>
<br>
10 SECONDS INTO FIGHT (some agro built onto MA)<br>
8. RL will shout: &quot;Enchanters dispell now!&quot;. Every enchanter should run to Vox and dispel two times to remove all her buffs (REMEMBER TO STAND WITHIN MELEE RANGE!). Vox has the old-world max of 32k hitpoints, and the dispells should remove her cleric buffs and will effectively reduce her hitpoints. Each enchanter should tell EFVox &quot;Dispelled&quot; once two successful dispells are complete.<br>
9. Once finished dispelling, enchanters should immediately begin mana sieving her, and continue to sieve until Vox is dead. If lag is not creating a problem, bards can twist in Denon?s Dissension (remember that Psalm is the #1 priority, do not let it fall out of the twist for so much as a second!).<br>
10. RL: &quot;Debuff now!&quot;. Once all dispells are done, the debuffs should come.<br>
Shamans should immediately begin to attempt to slow/debuf Vox and should inform EFVox only of successes (&quot;Slowed&quot;, &quot;Malosied&quot;, etc). If any 53+ characters are present on the raid, they can attempt to attack/debuf/slow at this time. <br>
11. Necros should avoid spells that turn Vox into a skeleton. This makes it very difficult to find the mob with so many people.<br>
12. Healers should remain near the rock until needed. If there is only a single person in the group taking damage, they should move back to the rock and get a heal. This allows the healers to stay out of Vox's breath range.<br>
If a number of people have taken damage, the healer should come to the group. The safest place for a healer to stand is behind Vox outside breath range.<br>
13. Healers should pay particularly close attention to the bard in their group. Bard resistances are preventing an enormous amount of damage, and bards have the fewest HP of all melee/hybrids. Bards are the only class that will not come back to the rock for healing if they are the only one taking damage. Bards are keeping groups alive, keep them alive.<br>
14. Healers/Paladins should call out in EFVox any LoH or CH.<br>
15. Necros should pump mana to clerics and nchanters.<br>
<br>
AT 60% HEALTH:<br>
16. RL: &quot;Pets attack now!&quot;. Pets are called in to attack.<br>
17. RL: &quot;Tash now!&quot;. 1 enchanter should Tash Vox and should tell EFVox &quot;Tashed&quot; if successful. If Vox agros and stays agroed on the enchanter, they should not be healed (hate will be transfered to healer and healer will die). Heal the enchanter if they live. If agroed, the enchanter can use this opportunity to pull Vox into the center of the room. The Chanter shouldn?t wind up with the agro, but, if you do, then follow the rules here please!<br>
18. RL: &quot;Stun now!&quot;. Everyone begins chain-stunning, bashing, and slamming Vox. Although, stuns will not actually stun her, it will interrupt her from<br>
casting heal spells. Continue to stun her until she is dead. Vox is a cleric AI and will attempt to Complete Heal herself. If she does get one off, it is not the end of the world, it will only heal approximately 5k of hitpoints, but let?s try and avoid that, eh?<br>
<br>
AT 50% HEALTH<br>
19. RL: &quot;Nuke now!&quot; Nukes and casters will be called in. REMEMBER TO GET WITHIN MELEE RANGE OR YOUR SPELL WILL NOT LAND. Caster classes that cannot cast stun should nuke as well. Nuke until Vox is dead.<br>
20. RL: &quot;Reserves Attack now!&quot; Any melee groups held in reserve should attack<br>
21. If a caster dies, memorize critical spells and rejoin the fight. All rezzes will be done when Vox goes down.<br>
22. If a bard is nearly dead and cannot be healed (which should only be if healers are OOM, they can move to center of room and suicide with Denons Desperate Dirge (Vox targeted) for 300+ damage.<br>
<br>
AT 20% HEALTH or there about (depends on #of wiz?s)<br>
23. RL: &quot;Wizards Nuke now!&quot;. Wizards are called in at 20% health for nuking.<br>
24. Continue to mana seive, interrupt, and nuke Vox until dead.<br>
<br>
VOX DEATH<br>
1. Vox's corpse should not decay for 30 minutes until after she dies.<br>
2. The group leader of the killing group should inspect the body and tell the raid leader which items are present. <br>
3. No one else should inspect the body please. The raid leader will loot and distribute items unless they are NODROP.<br>
4. All resurrections will be performed at this time. Temporary groups may be assigned with clerics &amp; bards to minimize time. Any bodies from pits will be recovered at this time as well. Bards and Necro?s will be the first rezzed so they can provide mana for additional rezzes.<br>
<br>
THE LOOT (note, I will be reordering this some)<br>
1. Book of Scale - paladin fiery avenger<br>
RL discretion depending on who shows for the raid.             Pally?s who have significant work done on their epic will be given preference of some form, but the ultimate winner will be roll based.<br>

Weighted Guild roll. Numbers will be assigned in a weighted fashion (based on number of toons in attenddence) to all the invited guilds. This will be considered loot of the attending guild rather than an individual (this is very handy for bad wipeouts, or may be sold for the guild warchest at their sole discretion).<br>

The first member of an invited guild who has a bard to the point in their epic where they have everything they need except for this and Trak, will be given this scale.<br>
12. White Dragon Hide ? White Dragonhide cloak quest more info to be decided on later for this one.<br>
<br>
MISCELLANEOUS NOTES<br>
It is possible for a level 53+ player to directly assist in a Vox fight, but it is moderated by getting expelled by Vox (other than buffs prior to a fight). If you get placed on her hate list, you will be expelled.<br>
1. Casting a spell on Vox will cause you to get expelled. The spell may or may not land. I?ve heard stories both ways. The people that I most trust would tend to indicate that nothing about the spell lands, but I guess it can?t hurt to try. Others believe that spells that cause waves of damage appear to work ? subsequent to the first wave.<br>
2. Healing people fighting Vox will result in an expulsion. The heal will generally take, lower level heals (non-CH) will sometimes allow you to cast more than one prior to expulsion.<br>
3. Getting too close to Vox may result in an expulsion. The agro radius is quite large.<br>
4. Some groups have used CoH (Call of Heros) to heal people. Since CoH wipes a persons hate list, someone can be summoned, have CH cast on them, and return to the fight. Since the hate list was cleared with the CoH, the<br>
healer is not placed on hate list. Other raids have used CoH to quickly return higher level characters that were expelled (healers for example). The later approach seems like an exploit to me, so I intend to shy away from that.<br>
5. We WILL, however, use 53+ characters to keep any respawned ice giants from bothering the Vox group. We will also take advantage of those high levels who provide high level buffs (Aego, C3 in particular) plus high necros and bards that wish to help with mana generation.<br>
<br>
<br>
This plan will certainly change some over time as we approach the raid date, so please reread things one last time the night or morning before the raid.<br>

My original plan was to do Naggy two weeks later. Currently, that is still my plan, but I'm willing to consider other notions. Note that Naggy is much less likely to actually be up because he is taken down far more often. For the naggy raid, my thought had been to have the Scalekeeper in the Hole be the fallback. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#00000F><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub135.ezboard.com/bexodusfellowshipforum.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=passac>Passac</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 8<br> <font color=#A8A8A8>(10/10/02 10:31:35 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub135.ezboard.com/fexodusfellowshipforumfrm5.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=68.topic&index=4>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Vox October 26th, 12:30 Eastern</span><hr size=1> Count me in.

 I have 3 chat boxes:<br>
1. Melee (tuned down just so it's my hit amount, and the amound I'm getting hit and names of those missing)<br>
2. Game messages/guildchat/ooc/shout/auction in one big one (and for the raid guildchat will go to the one below)<br>
3. Group tells/and private tells<br>
<br>
With this setup I haven't lost any messages yet that I know of, even in long fights.<br>
<br>
Now this may not be the best setup for everyone else, but for me it fits...tailor it to your own need.  I'm sure this isn't the best way for me, but it's what I've found works so far.<br>

Vox has a 30min corpse timer, so rezzes should be going on even while we're figuring out the loot. The end result should be that everyone should be there before Vox &quot;disappears&quot;.<br>
<br>
As a side note, Naggy is going to be a lot tougher to find up, so Chimera and I are talking about doing that one as a pickup raid using whoever we can find online at the time. This is going to be tough given the level restrictions, but we're going to take a crack at it.<br>

Aego does not stack with Shield of Words or Symbol of Naltron.  If you go with the setup you have, you're thinking of heroism/resolution.  Aegolism is a combined heroism, symbol of marzin and ac buff so you can replace those 3 buffs with aego.  I looked up the different buffs and the best ones to go with (if available) are natureskin (druid hp/ac/regen), bulwark of faith (cleric ac), and symbol of marzin (cleric hp) for the melee and possibly use potg (druid hp/ac/mana) instead of natureskin for the casters.  Despite Aegolism being more popular, the druid buffs and cleric symbol/ac buffs result in more overall hp and ac in addition to a mana or health regen.  Aego takes up less buff slots and lasts a lot longer though which is probably why it is more popular.  If you don't have a cleric with group aego, but you do have a druid with potg, then definately use the druid buffs. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub135.ezboard.com/bexodusfellowshipforum.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=angeliqe>Angeliqe</A> at: 10/17/02 12:36:14 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#00000F><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub135.ezboard.com/usingsang.showPublicProfile?language=EN>SingSang</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 721<br> <font color=#A8A8A8>(10/17/02 1:11:53 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub135.ezboard.com/fexodusfellowshipforumfrm5.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=68.topic&index=12>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.exodusfellowship.com/Sing-B.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Vox</span><hr size=1> Good to know Angel.

Chanaluss Neiton here. Ive done vox 3x (led once), and 14 naggy raids (joint led 3x and led once)<br>
<br>
If you need any help sing, ill be glad to do so. <br>
<br>
depending upon my schedule i will try to make this.... but im pretty sure it will end up being partially pickup....not to worry though. 40 peeps (if half of them didnt fall in the pits) can take her out....<br>
<br>
summary of my last vox raid (hehe)<br>
<br>
-Led by me<br>
-40+ people initially....first time leading so it was kinda slow<br>
-lost a ton of peeps before we got there<br>
-lost half of the peeps including MA into the pits<br>
-Got Vox down to 7%<br>
-attempted to try again after corpses were recovered<br>
-had to moderate the channel and end the raid due to a flame war going on between 3 people, 1 of which not even from povar. <br>
<br>

ill see what i can do =)<br>
