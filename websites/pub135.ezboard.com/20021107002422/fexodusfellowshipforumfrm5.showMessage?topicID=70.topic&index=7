Most guilds POP in and check if Phinny is up and he's KILLed in like 30 minutes or faster, depending on how FAST you can rally the troops. Phinny is all about quickness, he's up gather your tank, cleric, enchanter, druid, wizard, and MAGE as FAST as you can get over there before someone else beats you to him. It takes about a group of 55+ toons to take out Phinny. Kill the cleric seahorses first, they can't be mezed, but now my NUKES land for partial HITS, and Theft of Thought lands on them after TASHing them. When Phinny comes he brings his friends too, like all 3 of them. You can MEZ these seahorses, but they do need to be spread apart so the enchanter can MEZ them, they will CH Phinny which is a BUMMER if that happens, so keep them MEZed.<br>
Phinny does dispell it seems the one who has the most AGGRO, mainly the TANK, the TANK should have a Enduring Breathe item on him. Phinny goes down FAST after the ADDS are MEZed and all attention now is the BIG FISH to FRY.<br>
<br>
He is FUN and quite doable for EF, if you need HELP Sing do a who's all PB and most of us will come to HELP you out. He's dropped the Kedge backbone twice now that I've been there and the one on Zin is for Expresso's EPIC.<br>
<br>
I mean today Cromme, Eradikate, Phlesh and Zinfindale did some of Zin's EPIC MOB fights. Tangrin a HUGE monkey in Field of Bone, BEAT the living daylights out of Cromme, Cromme was stunned most of the fight, if not for Phlesh's thorns I don't think the Tangrin would of died. I think the Tangrin did 24K damage from Phlesh's thorn's. Eradikate was at 5% mana and Cromme went into that battle without AEGO. Phlesh and Zin had partial HITS with our NUKEs, Zin HIT him for the highest was like 195 and Phlesh HIT him with frost like 704 damage. The Tangrin did leave a impression on Cromme that day, he's one TUFF monkey.<br>
<br>
We tried to HELP Zendor with the corrupted Brownie he went POOF on us when we got there in Lesser Faydwer. Then to Lava to KILL Ejah for Boyah a 60 level monk. Then to the plane of Air to KILL Gwan. To Frontier Moutains and down into the lair of Droga (some goblins) to KILL Trunt. Boyah only had his final fight with Vorash and the Deep to spawn Xenovorash, which I had to go to work by then.<br>
<br>
This morning at 1AM PST we got Tyrobi his monk EPIC and other druids going on thier EPICs too. Sometimes you need to give people a push towards thier EPIC's. HELL PAG got part of his EPIC piece in COM and he was LD at the time, when we killed that ghost girl for her torch. We were there looking for Jade Reavers but only got two Black Reavers, a GUILD before had cleaned out the place.<br>
<br>
Sunday after COM we went to HOT(Halls of Testing) and got a chain tunic(Karia), leather arms(Chimera), leather headband(Faldaraa), plate arms(Cromme), silk arms(Casta), silk headband(Zinfindale) and Eradikate had(plate legs) but we all needed our gems now, LOL. Some days things fall into place when others like Jade Reavers don't happened. You always should have a backup thing to do as a GUILD. Our GUILD days are Sunday and Tuesday, but when we are on, if you ask we have come for people I don't even know. Casta would say are you up to VS, I would say count me in. Then 3 manaburning wizards take him out no problem, wizards are crack fiends I swear and I'm just thier supplier, Cromme and Eradikate were there also to see VS go down in like 3 seconds. Now they taking that away from wizards to do, which is GOOD, NO more farming of HIGH level MOBS, you have to work for it now.<br>
<br>
Just ask us and friends we will come, unless its a EPIC MOB fight in FEAR. Alot of EPIC parts are on Phinny. I can remember when Phinny owned us all. Its NICE to know I don't die now at every battle now with Phinny. I used to TOT, recant magic, slow him, maybe 3 times to get SLOW to land on him, then it would be to late, Zin would have AGGRO and be buffless, be drowning or beaten to death. ENDURING BREATHE item is a must have, no worries about drowning at all, just remember to put it on you.<br>
<br>
Send us a tell Sing and make it FAST because he will go down in 30 minutes or less. We have druids the most class in our GUILD and can get to DC in 10 minutes and be at Phinny in 15 minutes. Phinny is all about timing, you have to be faster than others to get to him and all it takes is a GOOD 6 TOON group.<br>

Volgor is no more.  He is still a toon on my acct.  But I traded a lot of his good gear for an RBG for my warrior and to help out a guildie.  Boeing our enchanter needed better gear and I wanted the RBG so we traded 24k in Volgor's stuff, wasn't much stuff, for the RBG.  So now Volgor is a second class toon who won't be dueling anymore unless to teach others how to defeat a necro, except Cobo he will try to claim ultimate victory when it was a lesson.  But on the upside if you want, I will go and DMF everyone before you go in so you at least have that.  I am going to write Volgor's goodbye story on our message boards (well not much of a goodbye as more of a see you once-in-awhile story.) <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000028><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> Syllabus astralwalker</span><br> <span class=usertitle>Unregistered User</span><br>   <font color=#A8A8A8>(10/15/02 7:56:27 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub135.ezboard.com/fexodusfellowshipforumfrm5.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=70.topic&index=10>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Phinny take 2</span><hr size=1> i'm in i'll be bringing Megat this go around though as we had a shortage of tanks,+ i have neglected my Ranger duties long enough!..<br>
