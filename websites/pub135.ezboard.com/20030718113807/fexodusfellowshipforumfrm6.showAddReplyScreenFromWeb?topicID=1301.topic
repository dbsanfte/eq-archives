class=title>   Interesting Read.</span><hr size=1> This is supposedly the most accurate info about the sleeper to date that I have found. But it makes for a good read if you follow this kind of stuff.<br>
<br>
THE SLEEPER<br>
<br>
I would just like to start by saying I have never even entered Sleeper's Tomb or most other high end zones in the game. In fact, I don't even have the beginnings of this or most any other key. This is all information that I have compiled from various sources. Much of it from the official moderated forums, press releases, and information from Sony, and much of it by consensus and &quot;proof&quot; on reliable fan sites.<br>
<br>
I am tired of reading many different things about the Sleeper that are ENTIRELY inaccurate and are only loosely based in reality. So here is all the accurate information I know about the Sleeper along with rumors and their resolution if any.<br>
<br>
First of all, the Sleeper has never been killed on any server. I don't care if your friend's cousin's neighbor's guild killed it, because they didn't. Believe me, if he had ever been killed, even if the loot was never posted for fear of nerfing, it would have made big news on the big EQ fan sites like Allakhazam and Casters Realm. Also, Verant has (in the past, at least) been in the business of congratulating people on major events. So you can get that idea out of your head now.<br>
<br>
Second, it never will be killed. Once spawned (and despawned), it was confirmed in a developer's panel at a Fan Faire, that he will not come back. To paraphrase: &quot;This was designed to be a one time encounter that affected the entire world after it happened. The desired effect wasn't intended to be so negative and we hope to have encounters of this type in the future that will create a more positive effect upon completion.&quot; The only other world affecting event that I know of since then is the Protection of the Cabbage Quest. After it's initial completion (by Xanthe who now has an earring bearing his / her name) the quest was made more feasible so other players could get the spell. Now you're thinking, OK, so if it's been tried, it can never be killed, but what if it hasn't been tried yet? I don't know. I was under the impression that it had been woken on every server, but can't confirm this, and could believe that some servers would still have a sleeping sleeper. However, with the recent upgrade to Sleeper's Tomb the Sleeper is no longer a part of the zone, and the zone is now &quot;Kerafyrm's Lair&quot;. Boys and girls, it's too late.<br>
<br>
<br>
Rumors<br>
Rumor: The only time anyone came close to killing the Sleeper was when &quot;random popular to bash guild&quot; on &quot;sometimes correct, sometimes wrong&quot; server used an exploit to kill him. (There are many different versions of this floating around various message boards).<br>
Fact: Not true. Whether or not anyone has even put a dent in his health will only be known for sure by the people who did so, and any developer's who looked at the log. The guild websites I looked at for some of the guilds who woke him only showed him with full (or maybe 99% of his) health standing amongst a pile or two of corpses. The exploit referenced in this rumor refers not to the Sleeper, but to the third Warder.<br>
The guild Conquest (not Fires of Heaven, Afterlife, Triton, or any other extremely powerful guild) was accused of using an exploit when fighting the third Warder. They were accused of having their raid under the bridge where the warder could not reach them while their main tank built aggro on the dragon without doing damage, so it couldn't start summoning. Only bits and pieces of this were ever released to the public so I'm giving only the confirmed &quot;facts&quot; as released by Sony.<br>
Conquest claimed no such exploit was being used (but defended it by saying people do the same thing to Vox) and that their Main Tank had no way of building sufficient aggro. They lost the fight because their clerics built too much aggro and got summoned and roasted. The fight was not stopped, but they lost. Some time later, when GMs were present and discussing their exploit (read: scolding them) they &quot;accidentally&quot; spawned the Sleeper (for the first time anywhere) and he loaded with the wrong model (a giant human male, there were screenshots of this that were at first called fake by Sony, then later they admitted that the wrong model loaded, they apologized for their false accusation in a Press Release.)<br>
The guild was disbanded and all it's members suspended and two memebers were banned as they had previously been warned from similar exploitation.<br>
This fight did not directly involve the Sleeper at all, that just makes the rumors sound more intriguing, and it took place in Sleeper's Tomb in an attempt to wake the Sleeper.<br>
<br>
Rumor: The sleeper can't be killed.<br>
Fact: Probably not. By this I don't mean it's impossible to kill him. There have been many strategies offered about doing massive damage quickly. Most of these strategies have obvious flaws. But does the Sleeper even actually take damage? Maybe not. Perhaps he's like the King in the old Ultima games, as soon as you hit him, he has full hit points again. This debate has gone on a long time, and there's no answer to it, and maybe there never will be. Only the developers know for sure. And they're not talking. Maybe they'll tell us someday, but in the meantime, just accept that we'll never know.<br>
<br>
Rumor: But someone told me GM's death touched him repeatedly and it didn't even dent his health.<br>
Fact: First of all, GM's have the power over the game. They're basically Gods. They manipulate all code that decides whether pixels &quot;live&quot; or &quot;die&quot;. When the GMs &quot;accidentally&quot; spawned Kerafyrm. It wasn't long before they killed it. If a GM were to decide that it wanted to &quot;chain Death Touch&quot; Kerafyrm and not kill him, they could. Are the rumors true about a GM doing this? Once again, there has been no proof, or even a reasonable claim that this has happened. When something didn't exist, it often doesn't leave evidence that it didn't, and that's the best proof it never happened.<br>
<br>
Rumor: The sleeper has 2 billion hit points.<br>
Counter rumor: The sleeper couldn't have 2 billion hit points, because EQ can not support that large of a number.<br>
Fact: OK, a signed long integer can be between -2^31 and 2^31-1. That is -2.14 billion to positive 2.14 billion. An unsigned integer can be between 0 and 4.28 billion. EQ can easily support 2 billion hit points.<br>
&quot;I know that, but does he have that many?&quot; Maybe, but doubtful. The only people who will ever know are probably bound by an NDA.<br>
Let's just pretend, for a moment, that the Sleeper does have 2-billion hit points. For a raid consistantly doing 1,000 damage per second, it would take them about 22 straight days to kill the sleeper. Does he have this many hit points? Maybe, if so, then you can bet it was because they never wanted him dead.<br>
<br>
Rumor: The Sleeper is the child of Vox and Nagafen<br>
Fact: False. The Sleeper is (according to Lore) the child of two different colored dragons, and therefore, had all the powers of both, he is not the child of Vox and Nagafen. There has never been anything mentioned about Kerafyrm being their child, and each have official histories that do not place them as the Sleeper's parents.<br>
It has become unofficial lore that Vox and Nagafen were seperated and punished because they fell in love and it was feared they would mate and produce another sleeper. However, they're both still virgins (unless you count the countless rapings they've offered over the past 3+ years.)<br>
Here is the Official history behind Nagafen as chronicled by Verant in EverQuest Atlas: The Maps of Myrist (page 293): &quot;Cast out of the Ring of Scale for reasons that still remain unclear, the red dragon Lord Nagafen has resided for centuries in the fiery depths beneath the LavaStorm Mountains.<br>
As Chronicled within the annals of the devout followers of Erollisi Marr known as The Maidens of the Rose, Nagafen, true to his dragon nature exacted a toll in maidens from the people of Qeynos, forcing them to transport one maiden a year across the continent and leave her in his cavern dwelling. This went on for many years, until a pious and beautiful maiden named Erollette - a novice in the temple of Erollisi Marr, the Goddess of Love - was selected. When Erollette sank to the ground before Nagafen, she uttered a final prayer to her goddess, asking only that her sacrifice be the last the maidens of Qeynos must endure.<br>
Her bravery and selflessness touched the goddess, who took pity on her. As Nagafen prepared to dine, Erollisi used a golden thread to sew Nagafen's heart to his stomach, twisting his pangs of hunger into pangs of love for Erollette. Under the enchantment, he could not bear to eat her, or anything else - he was lovelorn after all. So he grew hungrier, but the more he starved the more his heart swelled in his chest and the bigger his body became, until he was so huge he could not leave the confines of his cave. He begged her to stay with him, but seeing the dragon was helpless, Erollette rejoiced and returned home to report the good news and dedicate her life to worship.&quot;<br>
In the original Official EverQuest strategy guide (and the Kunark guide, p. 181), it was hinted that the ice giants were attempting to unite Lady Vox with Lord Nagafen (with the help of some greedy barbarians) but no mention of their past was made.<br>
<br>
Rumor: When he's spawned, he travels to SkyShrine and kills Yelinak.<br>
Fact: At first this seemed fake to me, but after research and finding pictures of Kerafyrm inside the entrance of ShyShrine, this appears to be true. Below is a warning shouted by several dragons in Temple of Veeshan which says basically get out of Skyshrine.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Rumor: When he's spawned, several other NPC's accross the world shout something unusual.<br>
Fact: True. At least Vox and Nagafen spout some drivel about their freedom at last. Oddly enough... they still get beaten down by mid-level adventurers on a weekly basis.<br>
<br>
Rumor: He can Death Touch the entire zone.<br>
Fact: Don't be stupid. I have never seen any reliable source that even makes the claim that he Death Touches the entire zone. In addition to that, logic would not dictate that he should do this. Even if the encounter was designed to be lost, there would be no incentive to not at least make it fun.<br>
Whereas Death Touching is feasible, it is usually reserved for Gods, which the Sleeper is not. Although I have heard no reasonable claims that he has Death Touch, he probably does. However, he would not &quot;Death Touch like a machine gun.&quot; And likely has at least a 30-60 -second Death Touch cycle like other Death Touchers such as Cazic Thule.<br>
<br>
Rumor: He is a crystalline dragon, like Veeshan.<br>
Fact: False. He is a Prismatic Dragon.<br>
<br>
Rumor: After he spawns, the warders no longer spawn and it is impossible to get Primal Weapons.<br>
Fact: False and True. True that the warders no longer spawn, but it is still possible to get Primal weapons, albeit much more difficult. With the revamp of the zone, Prismatic weapons (instead of Primal) now drop which are comparable in power to Primal.<br>
<br>
Rumor: You're full of poop, Rozzl. You don't have a clue what you're talking about.<br>
Fact: Do some research... and read the first paragraph. Everything here is what I have been able to find and verify (or verify as unverifiable) or have stated the reasoning behind the &quot;facts&quot;.<br>
<br>
Rumor: There is some long quest involving ________ (The floating Sword in Vex Thal, The Sword of Truth from Lord Inquisitor Seru, The Truthbringer, Veeshan, you pick.) That gives you a weapon that will kill the Sleeper.<br>
Fact: I don't even want to dignify that rumor by answering it. But no, there is no evidence to point to any of these wild and unbased speculations, but they are an amusing read.<br>
