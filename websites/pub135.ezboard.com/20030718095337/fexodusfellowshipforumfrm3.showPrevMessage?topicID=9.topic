Upon hearing the second knock, I regained my senses, and jumped out of my bed, grabbed a dagger which I had placed by the bed, and made for the door.  Carefully and steadily I grasped the doorknob, and began to turn it.  Again there came a knocking upon the door, and still I did not heed to the knocking.  I glimpsed through a slight slit in between the door and the door jam, and gazed into an eye.  Startled I swung the door open, while thrusting forward my dagger towards the being, which now fell down in an attempt to dodge my blow.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “Woah! Stand down for heaven’s sake!”<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp I stopped in mid swing of my second thrust, and looked at who was before me, it was none other than my target.  What a fool, he came before me in the middle of the night, the best time to quietly go about my work.  “I’m sorry, I thought you where trying to jump me or something, come on in.  So what’s up?”<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “Well, you wished to know why I was dressed as I was.  At the time I was wondering the same of you, for it has been years since some one like you has passed through.  My mind has been made up now and I know you are yet, another young rogue fresh on the prowl to take out such a small weak looking target, is this not true?”<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “Partly.” I responded not sure yet where this hobbit was going with the conversation.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “So it is so.  Then let me begin my story, for I am sure you are uneducated in it, or else you would not be here.  Back beyond your time, as I see, since you are still in youth, our lands here, the hobbiton area, was under attack from the goblins of Clan Runneye.  I was young then myself, no more than fourteen seasons, when I was kidnapped by the goblins and forced into slavery in their dirty cave.  Prior to being kidnapped I was sneaking around on of the goblin encampments, practicing as my trainer had told me, for I to be becoming a rogue.  After thirteen years of laboriously tunneling for the goblins, I saw a chance to escape.  One of the goblins that were watching over me fell asleep, so I crawled over to him, grabbed his key chain, and undid my bonds.  One of the other people near me, pleaded with me to take him with me.  He was a spy sent by the Freeport Militia, and a career rogue.  I would have done it, but the goblin began to wake, so I tossed him the keys, and ran as fast as I could out of the cave.  After a couple of hours I finally returned to Rivervale, the guards eyeing me as if I didn’t belong.  With help from my trainer I was able to slip back into normal life, or so I thought.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp It was about a year later that the first of your sort came around looking for my neck.  He was killed by one of the city guards as he attempted to assassinate me, and in his last words he told me who he was sent by, the spy from the cave.  He was mad by the fact that I didn’t help him out of the caves, and figured I had no right to live since he barely lived.  Since him there have been countless others seen in the Kithcore Woods making way towards our city, most failing, but you didn’t, as three others haven’t before you, until they meet me in a fight.  So I offer to you as chance to leave, without disgrace, and with your head still attached to your body.”<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “I must assure you, I came with different intentions than what you assume, but no less grievous to you.  For I came to help restore the pride of an old rogue, who now walks upon a staff, and he once came to take your head, and failed in the woods. Being that my only motivation is monetary, I can easily be persuaded from doing what I came for, but I do not humor you with offers, for I see you have learned much, and have much to teach if it can be tapped”<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “I see you are wiser than you look, but how can I trust you while my back is turned, how much is my head worth to you?”<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “If you wish to know, 900 plat,” I responded.  “But, I am willing to let you pay me back for my loss by teaching me what you know.  Being elven, I always quest for further knowledge, and being roguely I can deal with my loss by making it up some where else, I give you my promise on my mothers name that you shall not be killed by my hands.”<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “Then I will accept your promise and teach you.”<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp This is how my friendship began with Feepun Gatherto, halfling rogue of Rivervale, stout hobbit of war.  He taught me skills in scouting, poisons, theft, and taught me the ways of Kithcore forest.  He taught me how to use my charismatic ways to gain a buck or two and not just a gathering of women in every town.  We became drinking buddies, and not once did we question each other’s intentions.  We traveled far and wide upon the lands of Norrath in search of better markets and better fights, and there was no one who could take us down.<br>
