<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>While this thing is really focused on Q and Angel's epics, the royals are also involved in other epics. I know that we have Gorgd wanting the queen for the warrior epic, but since we are staying for the king twice, we should have time to do the queen again and fulfill another warrior's epic - so, the question is, what other warrior is working on thier epic. If we don't come up with one, then I or someone else will want to loot her again for a future MQ with someone.<br>
<br>
ALSO: The prince - who we need to kill on our way to the overking - is needed for the chanter epic: Do we have two or even one chanter actually working on thier epic? Mowgli? Boe? Who?</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
Well, with this recent influx of relatively high toons into the Fellowship and CoS, the horsepower of their combined forces has gone over at least one or two thresholds in terms of mob capability.<br>
<br>
With this in mind, I thought I would give a rather late going away party for myself and a &quot;reverse going away&quot; present (there the departer gives something to those left behind) to Qural and Angeliqe.<br>
<br>
Both of them are two kills from their epics - the Overking in Chardok, and Ragefire. Of those two, Chardok is the much tougher animal to organize and complete, plus it has to be done before you have all you need to spawn Rage.<br>
<br>
TO DIGRESS FOR A MOMENT: Having epic clerics around is a MAJOR alteration to your guild's raid capabilities. It means that an entire raid force can go from wipeout to fully rezzed and medding mana back up in just 5-15 minutes depeding on the raid force size. It also means your clerics can rez mid battle without the risk that the mana drain will leave them unable to heal someone in battle. In a nutshell, it's huge. The list goes on.<br>
<br>
OK, so here's the deal:<br>
<br>
WHEN: February 8th, 6:30PM Eastern<br>
WHERE: Chardok zone lineWHAT: The Chardok Royals<br>
WHO: 24 (no more, no less than 18 )     52+ toons. <br>
<br>
GOAL: Take down the Chardok Royals (at least to the Overking) not once, but twice. They are on a two hour spawn, so we'll remain in Chardok waiting on the respawn. This will be the final piece for both Qural and Angel (assuming they can both make it, otherwise I suspect I know another cleric or two that will be happy to step into the void) before they trigger Rage, kill him, and get their epic. Assuming this goes well, we'll have to schedule up Rage right away and do him twice too. lol.<br>
<br>
SECONDARY GOALS:<br>
<!--EZCODE LIST START--><ol><li>Take out the queen if there is a warrior there that is working on his/her epic</li><li>Continue to grow in our learning and tactics</li><li>Take out the Iksar Betrayer for the monk epic (if he's up, and he won't be)</li><li>Get &quot;phat lutz&quot;</li><li>HAVE FUN</li></ol><!--EZCODE LIST END--><br>
<br>
If you are planning to attend, please SIGN UP by responding to this thread or chatting with me in game. The level 52 floor on this is HARD - I won't budge on it because of significant aggro issues. Also because of aggro and fast repops, we will take 24 max on this. We need 24 or so to get the job done, so we want 24, but we'll try it down to as few as 18 depending on class balancing. 52+ is the first issue, class balancing is also a signficant concern.<br>
<br>
I will post a guide - including maps - to what we will be doing at least one week ahead of time. I would very much appreciate those who sign up looking that guide over prior to raid time.<br>
<br>
This is a VERY doable raid for EF and it's allies. Let's see a great turnout to support Q and Angel. When (not if) we pull this one off, the stage will be set for doing Rage and for moving the other high clerics through their epics if they so choose.<br>

<br>
This first time around the &quot;planned&quot; beneficiaries (they have to show for it obviously), are Q and Angel. Angel is hard to schedule at the moment for various reasons. Q was looking for something mid to late afternoon CST. Keep in mind that this is going to be a 4 hour raid if it goes smoothly. Longer if there is a wipeout. I am more than happy to move this one back a couple of hours if folks like, just realize that it's going to get quite late for East Coast folks if anything goes wrong.<br>
<br>
Yes, the overking is a 65 mob, and is doable by less than the 24 we'll take in. Of the mobs we're doing, the Queenie is the tough one (there is NO point in this raid that will be cake however).<br>
<br>
A few notes....<br>
I would like to have exactly 4 clerics on this one. A 5th would be &quot;OK&quot; (we'd add a second to the MA group). <br>
We need one high rogue (anything above the 52 level floor on this is fine) with max lockpick skills. Aoe nukes are big on this raid. <br>
I'd like to see 2-3 chanties there (this raid is multi-mob battles throughout). <br>
I'm will be looking for a FD puller that's done or at least seen this done before. If you know someone that matches this description, go ahead and ask them if they are willing to come along (I have one person that I will ask, and I'm hoping that Ursi or Angel know someone). <br>
Not required, but again preferable, would be  a tank that's done this one before too. I'll check with Krug, but I think he's meets this description or has at least been there for it, so if he can make it, we'll be well set there (plus there are some very capable backups now - woot!). <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000028><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub135.ezboard.com/bexodusfellowshipforum.showUserPublicProfile?gid=angeliqe@exodusfellowshipforum>Angeliqe</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 149<br> <font color=#A8A8A8>(1/13/03 12:42:21 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub135.ezboard.com/fexodusfellowshipforumfrm5.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=125.topic&index=5>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Charkdok Royals - Feb 7th, 5PM Eastern 52+</span><hr size=1> I recently got an invite to a royals raid and despite the fact Sing was planning one, I decided to go to learn how it was done.  They offered to stay the 2 hours for a repop and get me a piece also.  I got there and was shocked to discover that we only had 10 people and no FD puller.  I asked them if they had ever done this before and every said no, LOL.  Well, I knew this was going to be interesting.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   They wanted to do the Prince, Queen and King twice.

We easily made it into the library with few deaths.  Then wiped because of a freak train.  The second attempt, we went for the Prince first and managed to kill and loot him, but died to the 10+ adds we got...just too much for the enchanter to handle.  Third attempt, we went down and actually made it all the way to the king...yes he is 65+, red to me.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   We never stood a chance on that battle because the plan was to invis and float down the pit trap into the lair, then the chanter would mez everything but the king.  There are 8 mobs in the king room besides him and a few wandering back and forth in the halls.  That was one fast wipeout because at least one mob (not the king) saw through invis.

In theory, I'm going on a Chardok raid on Saturday. They are currently light on toons though, so we'll see. In either case, I've continued to research this one (anyone who's done raids with me knows that I'm a research nut - have to be since we've done so many raids where no one had done it before. lol).<br>
<br>
FOR FOLKS PLANNING TO ATTEND THIS RAID: Please remember to sign up. Signups are a MUST for this one, as I really, really need to know what I have. Remember, we're capping at 24. If you show up and there are too many people, then those that signed up and were told they are &quot;in&quot; go first, and, if we don't have what we need from that, we'll go by:<br>

One thing on this though:<br>
<br>
The Royals are done just about <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>every</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> Saturday by usually a couple of guilds over the course of the day. The result is that we may have to wait in line a bit. Everyone needs to remember why we are doing this and remain patient. If someone has just started, we'll see whether they are doing them once or twice and decide from there. If they are a ways in, we'll just follow them down a bit and let the low to mid 50's crowd enjoy what is really not bad xp at all - they continue on in. Basically, if we have to wait, I'm thinking we'll wait at the bridge and see if we can pick a monk up their pipe. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000028><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub135.ezboard.com/bexodusfellowshipforum.showUserPublicProfile?gid=gorgd>Gorgd</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 110<br> <font color=#A8A8A8>(1/28/03 1:11:48 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub135.ezboard.com/fexodusfellowshipforumfrm5.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=125.topic&index=11>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Charkdok Royals - Feb 7th, 6:30PM Eastern 52+</span><hr size=1> You updated it amazing.

This is the most important EF raid ever.  I will stay for as long as I can - I might have to leave early to get some sleep - just to learn how to do it.<br>
<br>
This one is important so clerics get epics and make our raids run smoothly.  This is the raid that should be our main priority. <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top">  Page  <b>1</b> <a href=http://pub135.ezboard.com/fexodusfellowshipforumfrm5.showMessageRange?topicID=125.topic&start=21&stop=34>2</a> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub135.ezboard.com/fexodusfellowshipforumfrm5.showPrevMessage?topicID=125.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub135.ezboard.com/fexodusfellowshipforumfrm5.showNextMessage?topicID=125.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a self href=http://pub135.ezboard.com/fexodusfellowshipforumfrm5.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=125.topic&index=20><img src=http://www.exodusfellowship.com/add-_reply.jpg border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub135.ezboard.com/fexodusfellowshipforumfrm5.emailToFriend?topicID=125.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub135.ezboard.com/fexodusfellowshipforumfrm5.threadControl?topicID=125.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/black_default/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands</a><br> <a href=http://pub135.ezboard.com/fexodusfellowshipforumfrm5.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=125.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub135.ezboard.com/fexodusfellowshipforumfrm5.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=125.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub135.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="exodusfellowshipforumfrm6">The Grand Hall<option value="exodusfellowshipforumfrm5">Event Planning<option value="exodusfellowshipforumfrm3">Tales of the Fellowship!<option value="exodusfellowshipforumfrm10">Epic Quests<option value="exodusfellowshipforumfrm4">Exodus Classifieds<option value="exodusfellowshipforumfrm8">The Vault<option value="exodusfellowshipforumfrm13">Tradeskiller's Anonymous<option value="exodusfellowshipforumfrm11">Out of Character<option value="exodusfellowshipforumfrm12">Applications<option value="exodusfellowshipforumfrm7">The High Council Chambers<option value="exodusfellowshipforumfrm9">Officers Lounge</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#A8A8A8>- </font><a href=http://pub135.ezboard.com/bexodusfellowshipforum>Exodus Fellowship Forum</a><font color=#A8A8A8> - </font><a href=http://pub135.ezboard.com/fexodusfellowshipforumfrm5>Event Planning</a> <font color=#A8A8A8> - </font><a href="http://www.exodusfellowship.com">The Exodus Fellowship</a><font color=#A8A8A8> - </font><br><br>  <br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 7.240<br>Copyright ©1999-2003 ezboard, Inc.</center></body></html>
