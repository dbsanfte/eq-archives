It was not a bad movie but it didn't have as good of a plot as the first one and too much action that seemed almost thrown together. <br>

I still enjoyed it though, except getting a headache from all the movement on the screen.<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

Then, Return of the Jedi renewed the faith of Star Wars in people and the trilogy later went on and two new (rather crappy) movies were made.

Empire Strikes Back was not only far superior to that Ewok infested piece of kiddie crap, but also superior to the original Star Wars in many ways.  It had the most character development, in ROTJ there was almost none.  The swashbuckling Han Solo was so toned down, that I barely recognized him.<br>
<br>
Empire took what Star Wars gave us and built upon it admirably and with a little more maturity.  And who can forget the greatest shock of all?  <br>
<br>
&quot;Luke, I am your Father!&quot;  That line sent chills down my spine when I saw it in the theater.<br>

...and as far as the Special Editions go...  GREEDO DID NOT SHOOT FIRST!<br>

Liked it quite a bit.  Looks like they spent alot of time trying to give us something new, going deeper into the Matrix universe. It was also nice to see the human city of Zion.  Some of the fight seems seemed a little long though, it doesn't seem like it takes very long until you start to get desensitized to the amazing fight scenes... Maybe it's just sensory overload.  All in all though, a very good flick.  <br>
<br>
I liked it so muck I went out and got &quot;The Animatrix&quot;  While this is my first foray into Anime, I liked it.  Especially the shorts &quot;Final Flight of the Osris&quot; and &quot;The Second Renaissance 1-2&quot;<br>
<br>
Back to Star Wars!  Yes Greedo shooting first in the special edition was a travesty.  I also did not appreciate seeing Jabba the Hutt's cameo, since it adds nothing to the story and takes away from the shock of seeing him in Jedi.  There is a big online campaign to try to get George Lucas to release the original versions when he finally releases, Star Wars, Empire and Jedi on DVD.  He has repeatedly stated that he has no interest in this and that the Special Editions are now the definitive versions of the movies.  Until the Super Special Editions come out anyways.<br>
<br>
Good thing my favorite of the original 3, Empire Strikes Back, suffered the least amount from the tinkering.   And I still have my original version Laserdiscs!<br>

Anyone start tearing into SW:G yet?<br>

It seems to me that the negatives are all related to some revamping the Devs need to do to the game and should be fixed.  I hope to play at least to the space expansion, then we'll see how well that goes.  <br>

Anyone else looking into SWG?  If so, any idea what galaxy (server) you're wanting to play on?  Here's the list, I think there are now 3 beta servers...but not sure, I think Ahazi is one of them.  I'll have to be on an east coast server being that I'm just one timezone away.   <br>

its about 70% of the way to where eq was when it was released..   but smoking jawa's with a blaster is satisfying but other than that.. <br>

Greatest Sw's movie imo.  As for matrix?  I think that the first was good and will stay that way for me, fight scenes were pretty much a first in movies.  Alas once you start seeing the same type of fight scenes in movies like Charlies angels, it somehow looses something.  I will wait for it to come out on Dvd..hehe. <p>Hail to the King!  -Ash</p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top"> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub135.ezboard.com/fexodusfellowshipforumfrm11.showPrevMessage?topicID=81.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub135.ezboard.com/fexodusfellowshipforumfrm11.showNextMessage?topicID=81.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a self href=http://pub135.ezboard.com/fexodusfellowshipforumfrm11.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=81.topic&index=10><img src=http://www.exodusfellowship.com/add-_reply.jpg border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub135.ezboard.com/fexodusfellowshipforumfrm11.emailToFriend?topicID=81.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub135.ezboard.com/fexodusfellowshipforumfrm11.threadControl?topicID=81.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/black_default/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands</a><br> <a href=http://pub135.ezboard.com/fexodusfellowshipforumfrm11.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=81.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/ultimate/subscribe.gif width=20 height=20 border=0 alt="Click to receive email notification of replies"> Click to receive email notification of replies</a> <br>  <a href=http://pub135.ezboard.com/fexodusfellowshipforumfrm11.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=81.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/ultimate/unsubscribe.gif width=20 height=20 border=0 alt="Click to stop receiving email notification of replies"> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies</a> <br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub135.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="exodusfellowshipforumfrm6">The Grand Hall<option value="exodusfellowshipforumfrm5">Event Planning<option value="exodusfellowshipforumfrm3">Tales of the Fellowship!<option value="exodusfellowshipforumfrm10">Epic Quests<option value="exodusfellowshipforumfrm4">Exodus Classifieds<option value="exodusfellowshipforumfrm8">The Vault<option value="exodusfellowshipforumfrm13">Tradeskiller's Anonymous<option value="exodusfellowshipforumfrm11">Out of Character<option value="exodusfellowshipforumfrm12">Applications<option value="exodusfellowshipforumfrm7">The High Council Chambers<option value="exodusfellowshipforumfrm9">Officers Lounge<option value="exodusfellowshipforumfrm14">Fellowship Lodgings</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#A8A8A8>- </font><a href=http://pub135.ezboard.com/bexodusfellowshipforum>Exodus Fellowship Forum</a><font color=#A8A8A8> - </font><a href=http://pub135.ezboard.com/fexodusfellowshipforumfrm11>Out of Character</a> <font color=#A8A8A8> - </font><a href="http://www.exodusfellowship.com">The Exodus Fellowship</a><font color=#A8A8A8> - </font><br><br>  <br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 7.245c<br>Copyright ©1999-2003 ezboard, Inc.</center></body></html>
