It was written by Vllad, one of our older guild leaders, hope you enjoy it.<br>
<br>
------------<br>
<br>
Quoted from Vllad:I have been asked alot recently on Iggles history. I gave a short account before but today I will give the entire account of Iggles, it is long but if you read it all you will have a good idea about where your guild comes from.<br>
<br>
History:<br>
The guild was created near the begining of Vallon Zek in the early fall of 1999. It consisted of mainly Trolls, with names like Shmiggles, Diggles, Squiggles, Quiggles, Wiggles, Ziggles, Slamz etc. Hence the name, Da Bashin Iggles. At first to get in the guild you needed to have an Iggles name but they soon ran out of them heh. That is when I ran into them back in 1999. <br>
At the time I was the leader of Mercenaries of Darkness (MoD) I ran into these Iggles in Oasis. Both the Iggles and MoD were set up exactly alike and our views were the same. We were on Vallon Zek for Pure team play. Iggles being a small guild with only 20 members or so we formed a Strong bond that tied the two of us together for the next Year. <br>
As Iggles grew in Age a new enemy came to our server that started to bring it down. Crossteaming: You see alot of players from blue servers had come to Vallon because of low population, they formed Crossteam guilds that consisted of all 4 teams. At first the concept seemed unique but it wasn't long before it grew like a cancer. <br>
The conflicts began when they started using all 4 teams to exploit pvp. Their DE Clerics would heal their lights when we tried killing them. Their Evil Team members would box our melee's in Dungeons while their LIghties cast on us with out being able to get to them. This type of exploits led to a war that raged for the next year. <br>
Iggles swore to remain in the minority and remain a pure team guild. They swore that they would try to do everything they could to stomp out this Crossteaming and would prove to those that said Single Team guilds will not survive to do anything big. <br>
Iggles claimed they would pvp in Dungeons (Frowned upon at the time) and would even pvp on the planes if they could. They were mocked and called just some crazy assholes and people even went so far as to say they would never make it to 50 playing pure team. <br>
By the time Iggles reached Guk Age the dungeon was full of Cross teamers. You have to remember this is Pre Kunark and Guk was the only place to go (Sol B was over run by lighties) post 40.<br>
The Iggles were committed to kicking these cross teamers out of Guk. Every night we went to guk and attacked them over and over. We were out lvled and out guned but the Iggles stuck to their committment. Not only did they stick to their committment but they tried to do it with Honor. We where trained and exp deathed constantly (Against the rules on Vallon) but they didn't give up. Everytime they saw the enemy in Guk they attacked them even at risk of dying themselves. The worst of these enemies was a guild Called Prophets. <br>
The Iggles phylosophy was if we can't have Guk be pure team evil no one will have it at all. This lead to many battles in the Lord room. Iggles took lvl 25's down there in their fanatic battle to stomp out the Prophets. People thought Iggles were crazy for fighting in Dungeons but their resolve paid off. Eventually after a month solid of pvping the Cross teamers Gave up and the Phish went somewhere else. <br>
You see this is what sepparates Pvp enthusiast and phish (Blue players). With enough resolve a Phish will feel his time not well spent if he isn't lvling. An Iggle feels it is well worth his time if he is killing his enemy. That is the single greatest thing that made Iggles unique. <br>
After Iggles alone had helped clear guk, their reputation was growing. For Most other Evil guilds with exception of a few cowed down to the higher lvl Prophets. Those exceptions were Black Sun(BS)/MoD/Minstry of Hate(MoH) and Dark Light Brigade(DLB). Iggles had paved the way so other evils could use Guk as a haven. <br>
This also lead to many other forms of fanatical types of fighting. For example: Igglestreatment(tm). This was the way Iggles dealth with Bind Rushing and people who refused to leave a zone after defeat. Since their was no exp loss some people would just refuse to leave and attack you over and over again. <br>
Iggles would track these people and call in the guild find these people (Casters mainly) bind point. At which point we would kill the person over and over and over again. People tested Iggles resolve by quite frankly saying they refused to leave and would ever leave. They would go watch T.V. or what ever but they would never bow to Iggles. <br>
Iggles showed their resolve by spending hours killing a person. I once sat for 3 hours killing a guy in Cazic alone. Eventually it never failed, they left. Iggles vowed that they would never give in and never quit. They would spend their evenings teaching people what true resolve is. <br>
<br>
After months of this people began to leave Iggles alone and let them do what ever they wanted. They learned that we would go to any length to push our style of play on anyone. Prophets continue to out lvl us and although we still had many fights they in general tried to keep some distance between us. <br>
When we had reached Planes age the long Prophets/Iggles was finally was coming to a boiling point. We had been camping PoH for 4 days and had many of us camped and bound up on the North wall. On our 5th day when we logged in Prophets had showed up and had been breaking Hate for sometime. They had camped themselves on the South wall. <br>
We asked them to leave but they mocked us as Phish do and told us that we would have to share this Plane and their was very little we could do about it. Even as I told everyone to put on their pvp gear even Iggles didn't think we would ever go so far as to pvp on a Plane. The results could be a complete disaster. This could even result in permanent loss of bodies. <br>
<br>
But dress the Iggles did. <br>
<br>
We were out lvled but we had numbers on our side. We moved along the West wall and prepared to find them and crush them. After so many hard long fought battles apparently the Prophets did head our words and they knew more then we did ourselves that YES the Iggles would pvp on a plane for the right to keep it when everyone else on the server thought it mad. Everyone else on the server cowed to them and gave up plane raids rather then risk the chance of pvping on them. However this was not everyone else this was Iggles! Prophets new we would come for them and they were prepared.<br>
As Squiggles and I Lead the charge down upon them we later addmitted at the insanity but at this point their was no turning back. We swooped down on them and All Iggles there that day who were not Powered lvled, Who had earned all their gear on their own, who had learned the hard way how to do things, who were not in it for the Loot but the experience of being apart of something better. In the very most important fight and the one they risked the most, Iggles fought better then they had ever fought before. The Prophets were crushed and their bodies were laid to rest on the wall of Hate. <br>
Prophets expected us to never let them have their bodies back but Iggles being better then them let them CR under the understanding that they never again interfer with our Plane raids again.<br>
<br>
Iggles went on to accomplish a great many things pve wise but as time went on and the crossteaming got worse staying a pure team guild became so very hard. Kunark made things even harder for pure teamers to stick together as our numbers dwindled. Leading this crusade wore on Vllad and Squiggles and they decided to hang it up. As they vanished so did Iggles. <br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
After a long rest word surfaced of a new place Iggles could call a home. This place was called Sullon. All of us old pure team leaders. Streen (BS) Vllad (MoD) Jarbauq (DLB) and Squiggles (Iggles) got together and decided this was a place we would start fresh. Only this time we would do it together. Iggles was reborn again. <br>
However on the first night of the server our old enemy had finally struck the final blow. Many old Prophets had known of our eventual departure and knew we were coming to Sullon. To get their final revenge and being the wankers they are, they logged into sullon created alot of the old Iggles names so that we could not have them. They mocked us on the first night but this did not stop us. <br>
We will continue on for the guild name is all that is important. Slamz and Fervid went to the newt team but all around you are the Iggles of old, they might not carry the old Iggle name but they are here among you. <br>
<br>
Famous Iggle Slang:<br>
<br>
The following slang are words that specifically are from Iggles that have become famous amoungst other non Iggles users, most of wich have no clue where they came from.<br>
<br>
FeF: <br>
This means Fuc n Fags. <br>
<br>
This famous saying came from one of our many slain lighties. His name was Mercenary, He was a human Sk and one of the worst slime we ever had on Vallon. Your's truley finally got him banned. <br>
One night after taking some major Igglestreatment Mercenary was lying on the ground with no hit points after being Disease Clouded so that he couldn't bind rush us anymore. While Lying there he looked up at us and said &quot;Fuc n Fags&quot;.<br>
Of course we took a screen shot and it kept us entertained many months afterwards. Of course we Iggles started using that term, and FeF has been with us ever since. <br>
<br>
Igglestreatment: <br>
It is the dutyful treatment dealt out to wankers. It is the killing of a person over and over again to teach them a lesson. Usually done at ones bind point.<br>
<br>
Phish:<br>
This is a term for blue players on a pvp server. Just ask yourself, what is it that swims in the big BLUE sea? Phish.<br>
<br>
Wanker:<br>
This one is self explanitory. <br>
<br>
Blizzied:<br>
This is when someone zones and then pulls the plug to get away and not be killed. This is named after the most famous of people who used this tactic on a regular basis to get away from Iggles. Blizzy.<br>
<br>
What is an Iggle:<br>
<br>
I hope the above gives some history and some examples of how the Iggles lived on EQ but the most important question is what is an Iggle?<br>
<br>
An Iggle is someone with complete resolve to play and do things his way regardless of what Verant or the mainstream players say can and will be done. <br>
An Iggle is not someone who cowers to anyone nor gives up when the odds seem long. He is into to only one thing, forcing his will apon others and achieving victory threw these means. <br>
An Iggles attention span is long for he see's the big picture. For example: If someone Blizzies on you, you wait at the zone as long as it takes for them to log back in even if that takes 2 hours. If your enemy won't let you in a zone, you kill him in it until he leaves, whether that takes 5 hours, 5 days or 5 months. You care little for your exp/loot or well being, you care only for what the long term goal is. <br>
You will bind camp someone in shifts if you have to in order to teach someone the hard lesson of never mistreating an Iggle. <br>
At the same time an Iggle will never start cheapened play but will finish it off with the most harsh of tactics if need be. An Iggle plays fairly and will keep his honor but those that play with out honor must be punished to the fullest.<br>
<br>
An Iggle will do that which is considered insane and crazy. An Iggle will be militant but at the same time have fun. Most importantly an Iggle will slap you when you have been foolish but crush those outside of Iggles that dared touch you. We are honest but diciplined, we like our members to be tough and self sufficent. Hand outs are for the weak, bribes are for the unloyal and fanaticism is not something that is learned, it is something that you are. <br>
An Iggles is someone that says &quot;I bet I can go with out blinking longer then you can&quot; and will not blink until his eye's bleed just to prove he can. <br>
<br>
This is an Iggle<br>
