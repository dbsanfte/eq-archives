I will ammend this top post as new rules come in that I think are appropriate.<br>
<br>
1.) LISTEN to the raid leader.  There is ONE raid leader. And ONLY one raid leader.  Leaders from the previous raid do not count.<br>
<br>
<br>
&quot;Do not give orders unless you are the raid leader. If you have a suggestion, send a tell to the raid leader.&quot; <br>
<br>
<br>
2.) Be on time.<br>
<br>
3.)  Send as few tells to the raid leader as possible.  Believe me, he/she is overwhelmed with them.<br>
<br>
4.) If you need to leave early, let the raid leader know.  If you can only play to x'o clock -let the raid leader know up front.<br>
<br>
<br>
5.)  Do not gate out of a bad situation unless instructed to by raid leader. If you can only play til x'oclock - the raid leader needs to know before hand.  /q IS NOT the same as gate.<br>
<br>
6.) Try to be bound as close as possible to get back to zone for corpse summon if need be.<br>
<br>
7.) Help out by bringing peridots coffins for your personal needs.<br>
<br>
8.) EXPECT TO DIE.  Do not expect great loot everytime.  Hang in there, eventually , you will get the loot you deserve.<br>
<br>
9.) DO NOT CRITICIZE the way people play in public channels/forums.<br>
<br>
10.) If you are raid leader , please make sure everyone is grouped or at least invited into the raid who will be participating.  Do not leave someone who meets the raid requirements out of the raid.<br>
<br>
11.)  Try to sympathize with the raid leader.  Remember, raids are hard - especially your first raid or your first time attempting to raid a new place.  The raid leader is doing the best he or she can to make dozens of people happy and achieve a goal.  Not an easy task.<br>

This will mean that you will target the same mob as that person that you are assisting, but NOT turn on autoattack. Once the mob is targeted, do NOT attack the mob until called for by the MA.<br>
<br>
Set up a hot key to assist your MA. Example: Gorgd is named the MA for the raid you are on. Set up a hot key like:<br>
<br>
/assist Gorgd<br>
<br>
By using this, you will not have to target Gorgd before you assist - just hit the hot key and you've got it.<br>
<br>
Set up a SECOND assist key that is just play /assist. Use this to assist the SA or some other named toon if the MA should go down or if the RL or other assigned person calls a split.<br>
<br>
<br>
AS AN ASIDE: If you turn /assist off, and you only turn on auto-attack when the MA calls for it, then you'll find that you will never be the one to break mezz. A recent patch now makes it very, very clear who broke mezz, so save that egg on your face. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000028><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub135.ezboard.com/bexodusfellowshipforum.showUserPublicProfile?gid=enchantermowgli>EnchanterMowgli</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 5<br> <font color=#A8A8A8>(2/11/03 9:51 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub135.ezboard.com/fexodusfellowshipforumfrm6.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1079.topic&index=3>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Gorgd's ( and friends') RAID RULES!</span><hr size=1> O.K.<br>
<br>
First let me say that I was probably responsible for at least one of Gorgd's comments about people &quot;gating&quot; out of raid.  When we were overcome by the king last Saturday when we got Qural's item, I was rezzed as one of the first few.  Shortly thereafter a couple of mobs respawned and attacked us.  I had very low mana, and after trying an unsuccessful mez  I gated out with my last mana.  Those of you have have raided with me know how fast I drop dead in a combat.  Doing so saved me 80pp for a coffin..I was frankly suprized that I made it out alive.  I generally get much less than 80 pp on a raid, and I had all ready died once that raid.<br>
<br>
I had no reason to believe that anyone else would heal me--other recently rezzed people had little mana also. So I gated.  I would do so again in similar circumstances rather than just stand there and die.<br>
<br>
So I wanted to bring up some of my concerns about raids also, since I have apparently been targeted for criticism.<br>
<br>
1)  I have been on about 10 guild raids.  At first I thought to myself that &quot;it was O.K. that I lost plat and exp on a raid, because I was learning how to go on raids&quot;.  The problem is that before I can lead raids to get the items I need, I need to learn about the spawn times, difficulty levels, etc that generally you only get by doing the raids.  If there are no high level enchanters in guild, the chance of doing raids to get those items, and therefore learning what is required...is very low.  I would be suprised if anyone in guild has &quot;/played&quot; time longer than Mowgli, even toons several levels higher than him.  <br>
<br>
2) I thought that I was helping the guild on these raids.  Yes I have made mistakes (pressed wrong spell key for example).  But I am trying to learn and become better.  Ocassionally though, I expect that I will gain experience and/or platinum whenever I go on a raid.  I am not a sacrificial lamb to be used by others--if that is what is expected, please tell me now so that I may find another guild.<br>
<br>
Be Safe.<br>

<br>
I don't think people want you to stand there and DIE. It sounds like maybe it wasn't a very SAFE spot to REZ people or respawns are happening. Common thing to do after a WIPE OUT is REZ a warrior to take on MOBS if there around. Then to the enchanter and other TOONS.<br>
<br>
As for paying for your coffins, I RAID in the Planes now so its pretty easy to do your CR at the Graveyard or where you bit it. When I did go on RAIDS with my GUILD or other GUILDS, the common thing to do was split the coffin costs between the GUILDS. PB has its own TOON that holds coffins for us, if we need more we get more. GUILDS that RAID together split the LOOT, gems, junk weapons, and let the TOONS that need a upgrade roll on it. So your GUILD on a planned RAID should pay the cost, but I don't know if EF has a cash bank like PB has. We have our own CASH TOON, that sells the EXTRA items members don't use. Because all GUILDS need money to function. Maybe your GUILD doesn't have this now, but your all getting up there on levels and will soon be heading out to the harder zones. Some farming of HIGH level MOBS will soon begin and the cash flow will come in, if the item is not needed by a member.<br>
<br>
Being in a GUILD is all about helping one another. Sudhana our level 56 Necromancer has fallen in LOVE with me, LOL. I have given him my Plane of Storm book(8INT 8WIS 7 saves verses everything 25HPS 25MANA), Cazic Thule book(8INT 8WIS 35HPS 35MANA), Netted Kelp Robe(10INT 20 save verses fire), and other stuff I made for him. His equipment for a level 56 Necro plain out SUCKED. His account was down for 8 months and he lost all his items. I still have to work on his TOON for the benfit of our GUILD. He's leveling FAST and is 2 full yellows away from 57. So I'm gonna save what money I can and HELP him buy the stuff he needs. OH I did tell SUD I wanted that PoS book back when we replace it with something else. I LOVE the graphics on that thing and plus the saves.<br>
<br>
Dying is just part of the game and I HOPE you don't hold anything against people if you die. I would be level 65 and some AA points by now with all my DEATHS on RAIDS and just plain stupidity.<br>
<br>
Just remember to bind near where you RAID at. The faster you get back, the quicker things can get rolling again.<br>
<br>
I HOPE some of this helps you MOW. I know I've tried to HELP you with your upgrades before. I just can't do everything. A lesson I try to tell myself every day. SUD is my pet project now. So I go out and KILL PoN stuff and sell what I can for cash. LOL, we sold off of 3 TOONS PoN, PoI, and PoD junk that got us 12K in cash. It cleared up some of their bag slots.<br>

      Solo/kiting for exp<br>
      Grouping for exp<br>
      Questing<br>
      Raiding for other than the above<br>
      Etc. (ie tradeskills, getting drunk...)<br>
<br>
 In a raid, I usually go down healing a long time before the call to evac is sounded, so I've found having succor mem'd is a waste of spell spot, but if I'm told to keep it handy by the raid leader, it's there.  Point is I come expecting to die, it's part of a massive campaign.<br>
<br>
Mowgli's right, the only way to gain knowledge and experience of raiding is to go on them.  You guys should remember that we are all as diverse in EQ as we are in RL.  We bring a little of that diversity to our raiding - for better or worse.  The more a group raids, the more they know each other's quirks and reactions.  I can't multi-task well anymore (I'm old) and usually halfway thru a raid my eyes are seeing double (bifocals).  I rarely use my mouse to cast spells in raid, it's all hotkeyed.<br>
<br>
For me, I've played 56 levels mainly solo or in a three-member group (Mowgli, Rivin and me).  I'm now learning how to expand my player skills into large group dungeon fighting and it's been a stuggle to know where I fit there.  Some nights I'm all thumbs and feel I can't do anything right, others I feel like a veteran.  I'm sure many of us feel this way.<br>
<br>
These raid guidelines are helpful.  It gives us a place to start and keeps order during the raid.  I've been going to the Kael raids on Wednesday nights and I just want to say I think we're really getting it all together; it's a big difference from when we first started.  But I do ask you guys who are a little sharper at this game to have some patience with us slow learners.<br>

I'm totally against gating though...especially on a big raid.  I've been on some crazy raids in my 1.5 years playing EQ.  A few weeks ago i was in ToV on Liny and i died 6 TIMES - i lost a total of 1.5blue XP that night, even w/ 96% clickers.  ALOT of other ppl died too....clerics, chanters, shammys etc....all these can gate....but its just something you dont do.  This is more directed towards Cobo, not Mowgli (i understand he made a mistake....hey, we all do...i've made some stupid ones too).  I know I yell at peeps sometimes on raids, and i apologize...thats just me, i like stuff to go smooth.  The only reason i do this is to teach....not scold or bring down.  I just try to make ppl understand how/why they made the mistake.  I hope you all can understand why i do that since the recent uprising of these events.  End the end it is a game....but lord knows some people take it seriously, and dont like it when ppl make silly mistakes.<br>

<br>
Gorgd and I are meeting in game on Saturday.  Exodus, if there is anything you would like me to discuss at this meeting, please email me at arathainkelvar@yahoo.com.<br>
<br>
Hopefully our guilds can come to an understanding, and we can work together on some pretty FUN stuff.<br>

<br>
I have seen multiple issues recently  that I think these cover:<br>
<br>
10.) If you are raid leader , please make sure everyone is grouped or at least invited into the raid who will be participating.  Do not leave someone who meets the raid requirements out of the raid.<br>
<br>
11.)  Try to sympathize with the raid leader.  Remember, raids are hard - especially your first raid or your first time attempting to raid a new place.  The raid leader is doing the best he or she can to make dozens of people happy and achieve a goal.  Not an easy task.<br>
