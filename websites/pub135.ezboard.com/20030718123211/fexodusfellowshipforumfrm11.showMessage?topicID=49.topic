~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br>
<br>
So there I was.....minding my own business in The Overthere, when all of a sudden I see the message: &quot;d00d sow plz&quot;. <br>
<br>
Of course, my natural instinct was not to answer, since I thought the clueless newb (hereafter referred to politely as &quot;the petitioner&quot;) must have been poorly informed at best. <br>
<br>
Boy was I ever wrong. <br>
<br>
I switch out of 1st person into an external camera, and what did my wandering eyes behold? Only myself and the petitioner. <br>
<br>
So I says to myself....&quot;Self? You need to edumacate this fella!&quot; <br>
<br>
(Keep in mind what the overall setting looked like: There I was, in skeleton form, carrying a scythe, FLOATING IN MIDAIR IN A MEDITATING POSITION, with a LARGE dark-brown skeleton named &quot;Gibober&quot; standing behind me. Ummm....No, skippy, I'm not a druid or a shaman.) <br>
<br>
I say &quot;Wish I could, bro, but I don't have SoW. I'm a Necromancer.&quot; <br>
<br>
The Petitioner says, &quot;$#*&amp;@#$ ****, sow me already! it's for a cr&quot; <br>
<br>
Feeling as if my feathers had been ruffled a bit, I do a &quot;/who all dumbass&quot; (um..pardon..I meant &quot;/who all petitioner&quot;) <br>
<br>
This is where I discovered the &quot;/who all&quot; bug. Certainly it must have been a bug, right? There's NO WAY IN CREATION the dumbas...err...petitioner could have been a level 31 Dark Elf Wizard, right???? RIGHT????? /em begins to cry like a little girl. <br>
<br>
Well, needless to say, I couldn't have been any more shocked than if my pet began dancing an Irish Jig. I quickly begin the arduous task of maintaining my composure, while deciding how best to deal with this tricky situation. <br>
<br>
I say, &quot;Necromancer's can't cast SoW&quot;. <br>
<br>
Petitioner says, &quot;Bull@#$%! you cast a spell while you were running and you sped up! i couldn't catch you until you sat down! if you're not going to sow me just say so you dont have to be a **** about it a$$hole&quot; <br>
<br>
Yes I know....he didn't use any punctuation in that last sentence. <br>
<br>
I say, &quot;I have JBoots.&quot; <br>
<br>
He says, &quot;what are they&quot; <br>
<br>
Before I have a chance to pick my chin up off the floor.... <br>
<br>
Petitioner asks, &quot;can you buff my hps my hp sux&quot; <br>
<br>
I say, &quot;I can't buff you, dude. I'm a necromancer. I only have one buff that you would probably want.&quot; <br>
<br>
He says, &quot;yeah the one you won't give me ****&quot; <br>
<br>
Ok. Time to have fun with the hopelessly clueless. <br>
<br>
I say, &quot;Why do you need a sow?&quot; <br>
<br>
He says, &quot;i need to get to burned woods to hunt. sumbody said its perfect for my level&quot; <br>
<br>
Yep. That's what he said......&quot;burned woods&quot;. <br>
<br>
I say, &quot;man are you ever in the wrong place.&quot; <br>
<br>
He says, &quot;?&quot; <br>
<br>
Apparently he found the &quot;question mark&quot; key conveniently located nearby other various and sundry communication facilitators. <br>
<br>
I didn't answer him. <br>
<br>
He repeats, &quot;??&quot; <br>
<br>
Found it twice...good for him. <br>
<br>
He repeats, &quot;???&quot; <br>
<br>
Having an IQ greater than plantlife, I sensed a pattern forming. <br>
<br>
I say, &quot;You are NO WHERE near Burned Woods.&quot; <br>
<br>
He says, &quot;my friend told me it was in kunark&quot; <br>
<br>
I say, &quot;Yeah, the operative word there is 'WAS'. There was a major patch a couple of months ago after a bunch of complaints were filed about 'static content'.&quot; <br>
<br>
He says, &quot;?&quot; <br>
<br>
I say, &quot;!&quot; <br>
<br>
He says, &quot;?&quot; <br>
<br>
I say, &quot;,&quot; <br>
<br>
He says, &quot;***&quot; <br>
<br>
I say, &quot;no, already have some.&quot; <br>
<br>
He says, &quot;????&quot; <br>
<br>
I don't respond. <br>
<br>
He says, &quot;so where the @#$% is burned woods&quot; <br>
<br>
He lost the question mark button again. Probably popped off when he was sniffing his feet. <br>
<br>
I say, &quot;Well, THIS week it's south of Freeport. It changes with every patch, since they began randomizing zone locations.&quot; <br>
<br>
My guild is hysterical at this point. And I haven't even told them the ENTIRE story yet. Just snippets. <br>
<br>
He says, &quot;@#$% i just got off the boat&quot; <br>
<br>
I say, &quot;You don't need the boat.&quot; <br>
<br>
He says &quot;why&quot; <br>
<br>
I say, &quot;You're a wizard!&quot; <br>
<br>
He says, &quot;how you know that&quot; <br>
<br>
I say, &quot;I did a /wh...nevermind....the important thing is you have teleportation spells.&quot; <br>
<br>
He says, &quot;oh yeah the green ones&quot; <br>
<br>
I nod. <br>
<br>
I say, &quot;Yep. The 'green ones'. Pretty nice how you have them grouped by color.&quot; <br>
<br>
He says, &quot;thx&quot; <br>
<br>
I say, &quot;How'd you think about doing it that way?&quot; <br>
<br>
He says, &quot;they were all @#$%## up when i got this char&quot; <br>
<br>
I say, &quot;Sit down and mem the spell 'Fay Gate'.&quot; <br>
<br>
He says, &quot;why&quot; <br>
<br>
Question mark key is on the ground in front of your chair, guy. Mixed in with your collection of boogers. <br>
<br>
I say, &quot;It's going to put you within spitting distance of Burned Woods.&quot; <br>
<br>
He says, &quot;how do you know&quot; <br>
<br>
I say, &quot;All patch messages come with a zone connection map.&quot; <br>
<br>
He says, &quot;oh&quot; <br>
<br>
I say, &quot;Ok. You have it memmed now?&quot; <br>
<br>
He had just stood up after what I assumed was meditating/looking at his spell book. <br>
<br>
He says, &quot;yeah&quot; <br>
<br>
I say, &quot;Ok. Cast the spell and let me know when you get there.&quot; <br>
<br>
Dumba...errr....Petitioner begins to cast a spell. <br>
<br>
A LONG time goes by.....ok, maybe 5 minutes <br>
I still haven't heard from him. <br>
<br>
Getting curious: <br>
<br>
I tell petitioner, &quot;Are you there yet?&quot; <br>
<br>
No reply. No reply at all. [Yes, I'm a Genesis fan... ] <br>
<br>
Obviously he's there, or my tell wouldn't have gone through. <br>
<br>
I tell petitioner, &quot;Hit the 'r' key to reply to me.&quot; <br>
<br>
He replies, &quot;i'm here now where do i go.&quot; <br>
<br>
Right idea....wrong punctuation mark. Oh well. &quot;C&quot; for effort. <br>
<br>
I tell petitioner, &quot;Ok, do you see a hotkey on the screen that says 'Sense Heading'?&quot; <br>
<br>
He replies, &quot;no&quot; <br>
<br>
I reply, &quot;Hit the arrow buttons one by one until you see one.&quot; <br>
<br>
It was a guess, but an educated one. <br>
<br>
He replies, &quot;found it&quot; <br>
<br>
I reply, &quot;Click on it.&quot; <br>
<br>
He replies, &quot;north&quot; <br>
<br>
I reply, &quot;Ok, you need to head east along the path. Keep going until the path turns north. When it forks to the right, take the right fork.&quot; <br>
<br>
He replies, &quot;ok&quot; <br>
<br>
Who knows, maybe the guy who sold his account on Ebay worked his Felwithe faction up. <br>
<br>
He replies, &quot;sumbody told me i shouldnt be here cause i'm a dark elf&quot; <br>
<br>
I reply, &quot;They were roleplaying.&quot; <br>
<br>
He replies, &quot;oh hehe @#$%@#$ morons ;P&quot; <br>
<br>
Priceless. Utterly priceless, I tell you. <br>
<br>
I reply, &quot;Where are you?&quot; <br>
<br>
He replies, &quot;i see something now. looks like a castle&quot; <br>
<br>
I reply, &quot;Run into the castle as fast as you can. The guards might give you some trouble, just keep running.&quot; <br>
<br>
Yeah...damned conscience started kicking in. <br>
<br>
A fairly long period of time passes. Not sure how long, but longer than I was expecting. <br>
<br>
I tell petitioner, &quot;What happened?&quot; <br>
<br>
As if I didn't know.... <br>
<br>
He replies, &quot;my spells are gone!&quot; <br>
<br>
I reply, &quot;What happened?&quot; <br>
<br>
He replies, &quot;i died why&quot; <br>
<br>
I reply, &quot;Oh man! Did I tell you to run east or west?&quot; <br>
<br>
He replies, &quot;east ***???&quot; <br>
<br>
I reply, &quot;Yikes. My bad. You should have run west.&quot; <br>
<br>
He replies, &quot;?&quot; <br>
<br>
I reply, &quot;So where are you now?&quot; <br>
<br>
He replies, &quot;how can i tell&quot; <br>
<br>
I reply, &quot;Look right after you see 'Loading please wait'. It should tell you 'You have entered [zone]'.&quot; <br>
<br>
He replies &quot;it doesnt say [zone] there.&quot; <br>
<br>
After smacking my head against my monitor.... <br>
<br>
I reply, &quot;What does it say in place of [zone]?&quot;. <br>
<br>
Get this.... <br>
<br>
He replies, &quot;Burning Woods&quot; <br>
<br>
I nearly fell out of my chair! I couldn't have PLANNED it that way! <br>
<br>
He replies, &quot;is that the same as burned woods&quot; <br>
<br>
I reply, &quot;No, but you're close. Start running south so you can get your corpse back.&quot; <br>
<br>
He replies, &quot;i have to get my corpse back?????&quot; <br>
<br>
/ignore petitioner <br>
<br>
<br>
Moral of the story: EBay...Just Say No! <br>
<br>
Out of sheer curiosity, I took him off ignore later to find out what happened. <br>
<br>
I tell petitioner, &quot;How's it going?&quot; <br>
<br>
He replies, &quot;***? where you been&quot; <br>
<br>
I reply, &quot;been afk, sorry.&quot; <br>
<br>
He replies, &quot;got my corpse back. some dude rezzed me.&quot; <br>
<br>
My conscience somewhat eased... <br>
<br>
I reply, &quot;Really? Cool! Where are you now?&quot; <br>
<br>
He replies, &quot;iceclad ocean&quot; <br>
<br>
I scratch my head a few times. <br>
<br>
I reply, &quot;Why Velious?&quot; <br>
<br>
He replies, &quot;the guy that rezzed me told me burned woods was in western wastes this week&quot; <br>
<br>
I don't recall exactly how long it took me to stop laughing. I stopped breathing shortly before my dog dialed 911. <br>
<br>
He replied, &quot;@#$%&amp;* wouldnt sow me either. what is that sh#$ gold?&quot; <br>
<br>
That's what finally killed me. I'm writing this from the afterlife.  <p>Ow stop hitting me. I said stop hitting me!! Gorgd has killed his brain cells.
