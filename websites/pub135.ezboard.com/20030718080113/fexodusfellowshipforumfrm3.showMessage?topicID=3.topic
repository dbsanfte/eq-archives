The winds seemed to come from the west, but then they would change directions and come from the north.  The air smelled of an incoming rain.  Being a wood elf, I always planned for events like rain, so I pulled out my cloak, but being a crafty rogue, I pulled out my sunglasses which I stole from the ogres of Timorous Deep, and then grinned as I placed them on my face.<br>
  As I passed the druids, they frowned at me as if I didn’t belong in the midst of nature.  The forest loomed ahead, like a monster from the ancient texts.  They called the forest by the name of Kithcore, a friendly name for a vicious place.  As a youngster I learned to fear that place, but as an adult, I merely laughed at its hidden dangers with ignorance.  I stopped my trek for a brief moment, and deeply inhaled the air.  I knew in the back of my mind that that would be the last time for a long while I would smell familiar air.  It wouldn’t be my first time that I left familiar lands to venture into the world, but no doubt, this would be the most dangerous.  I slowly exhaled finally, and stepped forward once again.  <br>
As I entered the woods, the rain that I knew was upon me, began.  I removed my sunglasses, no longer in need of them with the woods blocking all the sunlight.  I looked left, then right, checked for others, pulled my cloak tighter, then vanished before any unseen eyes.  From the texts I had managed to find, I knew it would be wise to use my trade skills, for the horrors held within these woods seem to have rarely let any descriptions leave the woods.<br>
I thought back to the night I decided to do this quest, back to the old man in the bar.  The man claimed to have once been a great assassin.  His kills had taken him all around Norrath he said, until he was hired to kill one man.  His only failed kill.  He spoke of his target, a short stocky man, with large hairy feet, and no facial hair.  Then he admitted a bitter truth to me.  A truth that no rogue likes to admit.  He said he never made it to his target, not once even saw his target.  He then uttered a curse to a forest so treacherous that even a rogue could not pass freely without care.  I laughed at the man and quickly asked him a question.<br>
“Old man, do you speak of the Kithcore woods?  I mean, I’ve heard stories, but I grew to believe them just wives’ tales to scare little kids.”<br>
“Oh yes, that would be what I speak of, but those stories are far from being lies, and weigh on the side of truth.  You see this cane boy, how do you think I got this cane?  I may be an old man, but I didn’t lose my agility from age, oh no, it was them woods.”<br>
“Well sir, I do not know how you got it, maybe you stole it from one of your victims, and added it to your ‘appearance’ so you can infiltrate places better, I know I would do that.”<br>
“Boy! Do not speak with such stupidity!  I got this cane because of those woods.  There’s things in those woods so horrid they send chills down the spine of the bravest of brave men with the largest following backing them.  Things even 70 strong men could not handle.  To have survived with just this cane as my reminder, I thank Bristlebane for, but to have this cane to remind me of my failure hurts my pride every time I glance at it.”<br>
“I do not mean to be rude sir, but are you saying that no man could make it through those woods, because you couldn’t?  You claim to be a rogue, I can see your battle scares which elude to this being true.  Perhaps you would like to make a little wager.”<br>
“BAH! You’re a foolish boy!”<br>
“Sir, I may be respectful to you, be it merely out of moral reasoning, for I respect my elders, but I am the farthest one can get from foolish, and take offense to being called foolish” I spoke these words carefully as I tightened my grip on my spear.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “If you must act like this, then speak on, what do you place upon the table?”<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “For starters, being a wood elf, I must contradict my trades beliefs, and be morals.  Which is why I propose at not possible lose to you, to return the head of your target to you so you can retire with some pride left over.  If I fail, you’ll never see me again.  But, uh, the price of the head would be 600 plat.”<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp The old man choked on his beer.  “ You twearp!  Do you even know the price of that man’s head is?  Just 300 plat!  You’d be taking the spoils. No way would I agree to that.”<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “Oh, but the way I see it you can die a bitter old man, or live a nice life in retirement with respect amongst your peers, sure you’d lose money, but you could still have your pride.  Well, never mind, who was it that sent you on this job, oh yes, Texh Fedor, I guess I will give him the head and claim the 300 plat.”<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “You measly little, fine, you win, I shall laugh at your funeral, be warned, my friends are numerous.” <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “So are mine old man, so are mine,” I said with the biggest grin I could muster.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp The memory invigorated me; nothing like screwing an old man out of 300 plat can make a rogue any happier.  I grinned again at how I placed the man in the worst predicament ever.  The man couldn’t make the trip anymore to do the job.  If I did complete the job, I could claim the bounty and make him look like a wimpy never has, or I could sell it to him, he would keep his reputation, and I would be 300 plat richer than I would if I claimed the bounty.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp I continued my walk along the trail, slowly and with precise steps.  I trudged up the trail, leaving deep footsteps in the muddy trail.  The rain began to fall harder, I could only tell because of the size of drops grew, common to the increase of water being filtered by the tree branches.  The larger raindrops splattered nosily on the mud of the trail, with a continuous noise almost symphonic.  My heart rate began to quicken; something was near me, watching my moves, but what?  I crouched down, and began searching the landscape for a set of eyes.  Looking forward for a long while my eyes adjusted to the stillness of the woods, I could see the crow about 700 meters away in the upper most branches of a tall sturdy pine.  I dismissed it from the possible suspects, and continued to study the woods, while listening intently.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Then I heard it, a quiet squashing noise, off to my left.  I turned my head to the direction, and waited for the next movement.  I had to wait awhile, but it did come, and I was glad almost, but angry as well.  Approximately 1000 meters away, an undead creature of some type unknown to me, hid behind a tree, it’s raggedy clothing and toe, or what was left of it’s toe, exposed to my view.  He was silently stalking me.  I pulled out my map and compass and began to chart my location within the woods, while keeping the creature in the corner of my eye.  I determined my options, I could run for it, and risk getting the attention of more of these undead creatures or I could kill this one and hope no others come to aid it, or I could ignore it.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Then an idea popped in my head.  I pulled out a mirror from my satchel, and began walking, keeping the mirror with an image of the creature.  I was right; he walk was the same as those I had previously fought in my travels.  He walked with the legs of a corpse, stiff and bow-legged, there would be no way he could out run me if I ran for it.  I also had to assume there where others like him and I couldn’t risk them seeing him chasing me.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp I finally made my decision.  I quickly raised my spear into a ready position, spun on my heels, and made a bluff charge towards the creature.  The creature stood like a man caught with his pants down in an opera house as I ran towards him.  My heart began racing me legs to reach the creature, or so it seemed as it pounded in my chest.  The old man was right, I realized, when a chill went down my spine as I thought about what I would do it the creature wanted to fight and not run.  But my fears were unneeded, as the creature turn and ran in panic. Being a rogue I wanted to make sure he didn’t want to follow me anymore and raised me spear up high.  I gripped my spear with both hands and plunged the spear down into the back of the creature as hard as I could.  The creature groaned in agony as it fell towards the ground.  It’s shoulder rammed into the ground and I could hear the sound of snapping bones as the creature groaned again.  I realized I could end this madness now, and again raised my spear high, grabbed it with both hands, and slammed it down into the back of the creatures head.  The skull gave way like butter, and a mass of black slimy substance splattered from the splintered skull.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp I let out a deep sigh, for now I had to make sure I didn’t get a bit of the black substance on any part of me, and also clean my spear.  I sat down and began to set about my task, slowing checking every inch.  Finally satisfied I was clean; I drove me spear into a mud puddle and moved it around in the mud.  I continued until I decided it was clean enough so that an animal could not smell the decaying mass on my spear.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp My plan had failed, but that didn’t matter, the creature was dead now and couldn’t bother me now.  Something unnerved me though, how had this creature seen me, and why was it following me, on obviously superior being.  I shook my head free of my concerns, and again, trudged onward.  Again, I left deep, yet precise footsteps in the mud.<br>
