<!--EZCODE HTML START-->          <h3>Introduction:<br>
Of Allies and Enemies…</h3><!--EZCODE HTML END--> <br>
As I write this, we are fast approaching the one year anniversary of our humble Fellowship, and lately I have done a lot of reflecting on the beginnings of our Guild.  I look back fondly on the past year and see that we have grown into a family of friends that really cares about each other and loves adventuring together.<br>
<br>
If you are like me, you have made some good friends in Norrath.  Our guild is proud to call Primal Blood and Circle of Shields our allies, and we are friendly with a number of other guilds.  Hopefully soon we will be adding more to our list of official allies.  But there was a time when our guild was an enemy to another guild.  Not by our decision, but by their leader's.  I personally had a bounty over my head and was to be killed on sight if I was spotted lurking in the lands of what once were my former brothers and sisters (not an easy thing to do on a non PVP server!).<br>
<br>
To understand how this happened is to tell the story of our very creation. And to go back several months before The Exodus Fellowship was born. The origin of our guild cannot be told without telling the story of another guild. A guild that many of our Fellowship’s founders had come from.<br>
<br>
For now, and for future members of The Exodus Fellowship I will attempt to chronicle our story and to tell you of the turbulent times we faced.  Though it was not always that way...<br>

From Whence We Came…</h3><!--EZCODE HTML END--> <br>
It all started for me back in February of 2001 (sorry, I don’t know the Norrath date!). I had been away from Norrath for awhile, and decided to visit it’s lands once again, for what I thought might be the last time. Other worlds had taken up my attention of late and I thought my time in Norrath was coming to a close. As I was wandering the treetop platforms of Kelethin, wondering if I should give away what meager possessions I had, I heard a call ring out from below the platforms. <br>
<br>
The voice was coming from someone named Xellosx and he was calling out for the local citizens to join him in the formation of a new guild. Early on in my life, I had belonged to a group known as The Guardsmen of Norrath. I had liked the sense of family that they had offered. Strangers united in a common cause to help one another, with no expectations. Unfortunately, after several leadership changes their ranks had dwindled until finally they disbanded. Anyway, remembering the sense of family I had with GoN, I thought it might be fun to get in on the very beginning of a new guild.<br>
<br>
I met Xellosx down at the bottom of the lift where several people had already gathered. He was a druid of about the 16th season. Fairly young to be running a guild I thought, but I was only a few seasons above him, and it was the quality of the leader that mattered to me, and not necessarily the years of experience. I asked Xell a few questions about the guild and about himself. He told me that his full name was Xellosx Darketernal and that he and his “brother” Erdrix Darketernal had come from another guild called The Valor of Virtopia, but that guild had grown too big and were no longer a friendly place to be. Now they wanted to start a new group that would always be willing to help each other when in need. <br>
<br>
That seemed reasonable to me. I then asked him if our new guild would have a website, so that when we were not in the world of Norrath, we could still communicate with each other, and it would also serve as a place where visitors could get to know us and what we were all about. He assured me that it would, and that Erdriix, who would be co-leader of the guild, was an “expert” in a strange language known as HTML. Armed with his knowledge he would be able to create such a site. It all sounded pretty good to me, and so I accepted his invitation to join The Eternal Stormcallers. Less than a week later, the powers that be made it official and we were on our way… Xellosx was named Leader, Officer Erdrix was to be considered Co-Leader and would have the official Leadership passed to him when Xell would be away for extended periods. And a Paladin named Gustur was also made an Officer.<br>
<br>
After a week or so, I had asked again about the site, and/or a message board so that we could at least plan events a little more easily. Our members just seemed to be roaming the countryside randomly with no real purpose. I was assured that the site was being worked on and that it would be available soon. It was either because of my enthusiasm or maybe perhaps to shut me up, that I was made an officer of the guild. Proud that I had advanced so quickly and impressed that Xellosx and Erdrix recognized my worthiness I relaxed a bit. I was sure that Erdrix would debut our site any day and it would be something our new and growing group would be proud of.<br>
<br>
Another week had passed and still nothing. I had managed to speak to Erdrix and he admitted to me that he hadn’t yet had the time to work on our site. We hadn’t had any guild events because there was really no way for us to communicate and get organized. I then took it upon myself to create a message board for us. I also informed Xellosx that I might be able to lend a hand in the creation of our website.<br>
<br>
Xellosx’s first message on our new board:<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>          <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i>          “Hey everyone. Your fearless leader here, just thought I'd leave a little message. Thanks to Kamdar for putting this board together. We have great plans in store for ES, so stay tuned and make sure you stick with us as we go through all these changes. The webpage production is still in it's planning stage, as Kamdar and Reztius are both likely candidates to work on it, with Gustur as Graphical support I believe. I would like to ask that all members, when posting, leave their emails as I plan on sending out guild announcements and updates. Not much else to say, but keep up the great work all of you.”</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--></b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
What great work? We hadn’t done anything yet! And as far as our leader being “fearless” I had yet to see him in action, because we did not have our first raid yet! I couldn’t help but notice that Erdrix, the Master of HTML was no longer listed as working on the site. I contacted the others that were mentioned in the post about the website. They gave me their blessing to try to get something up as soon as I could. I wrote to Xell, asking him if he could come up with some opening line for the front of our site. He told me he would get right to work on it. Days passed and again, nothing. And so our website debuted and on the front of it were these words, that I wrote…<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>          A storm has been brewing…All manner of hideous creatures have been marching on the land. A rising flood of Orcs, Goblins, Zombies and Spectres have been encroaching on the once peaceful lands of Norrath. Once thought to be merely legends, the Ancient Sarnak have also returned to wreak havoc upon the unsuspecting and the innocent <br>
Not being able to turn their backs on the coming threat, two brothers known as Xellosx and Erdrix Darketernal formed a fellowship. An alliance made up of many different races, all dedicated to returning the land back to the peaceful inhabitants of Norrath. These brave heroes do not fear the coming evil. They welcome it. For the sooner the threat is met head on…The sooner the storm will be over.</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
It was not a literary masterpiece, and it had not even come from our leader, but he approved it, and the site soon went up, with a portrait of Xellosx and Erdrix right on the welcoming page.   It was still missing things like a Charter and a Code of Conduct… but all of our members were listed and it was a place to start. We were still a very small group of less than 20, but we steadily started to grow. Two notable members that would play a part in the future soon joined our guild. Arrwen, a lovely female Ranger (and who just happens to be Arri’s Alternate), and a Druid named Ienoldar.<br>
<br>
And at last, Xellosx announced our first raid….<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>          <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i>          “Ok folks, you have all gone on and on about a raid, well here it is folks. Due to many suggestions, i have made Crushbone the first raid we will hold. It will be held On Saturday, March 30'th at 9:00 eastern time. If you miss this, i don't want to hear any complaints. A guild leader has alot to do. I, along with my officers are doing all they can to make ES the greatest guild ever. Also, ALL RAIDS, WILL be posted here.. so make sure you check the board often.<br>
Thats it for now.<br>
Your fearless leader,<br>
Xellosx Darketernal”</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--></b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
Everyone was expected to attend! Gustur had posted a very impressive strategy for us on the board and we were all looking forward to handing Emperor Crush his own head. At least the 8 of us that showed up for the raid were excited. Our fearless leader was not one of them. After we had waited about 45 minutes for him or Erdrix to show up, we decided to go in without either one of our leaders.  The Raid did not go well.  After several deaths a few took off for other less deadly areas and Gustur, upset by how the raid had gone, handed in his resignation and left the Stormcallers forever.<br>
<br>
That night on the message board a little imp ranger known as Cairpre, who had been one of the few of us that had shown up for the raid left a rather scathing post about the failure of our first raid. He also took delight in pointing out that our leader was not there. Xellosx responded with venom in his voice… “If you must know I had a *%$!ing family emergency!” He ranted on for a little while, mostly lambasting Cairpre, and how it was too bad that Gustur left but it was none of his concern.<br>
<br>
I, however, was concerned. For the first time I really wondered if Xellosx was fit to be a leader...<br>

The Gathering Storm</h3><!--EZCODE HTML END--><br>
Two of the finest friends I have made in Norrath are an Ogre Shaman named Burak, and Wiggam, a Dwarf Paladin.  While of completely different statures, and races for that matter, both are big of heart and honor.  Both were in their 20’s when I came across them and neither had belonged to a guild yet.  Burak had friends in Mensa D'Morte and although Wiggam was far away from their minimum age of 45, he had his eye on The Guardian Lords.  Somehow, I had talked both of them into joining the Stormcallers though it wasn’t easy!   Wiggam took the most time feeling us out.  I knew that when he joined a guild, he was serious… he wanted it to be for good, and he wanted it to be the only guild he would ever join. When I got them on board I was pretty happy.  <br>
<br>
Things were also going well for Arrwen and Ienoldar.  Both had made Officership (at my request) and were becoming fine members of our guild as it continued to grow.  Arrwen’s husband, Sinclair joined us as well as Ien’s wife Angeleena.  <br>
<br>
We had planned another raid on Crushbone and this time Xellosx had shown up.  He invited another “brother” by the name of Varden Darketernal to join us.  This time the raid went quite a bit smoother under the Paladin’s watchful eye.   He was somewhere in his mid 30’s and although he had the power, he did not intrude, but offered aid when it was needed.  He wore the banner of Xellosx’s former guild, The Valor of Virtopia.   After we put the hurt on Emperor Crush and Ambassador D’Vinn, we called the raid over and toasted our success.  As far as I know, that was the last raid that our fearless leader ever attended.<br>
<br>
Xellosx would often disappear for weeks at a time, from both Norrath and the messsage boards.  He would not answer his mail and Erdrix, who I learned was not a real brother, but did know him for several years of adventuring, could not locate him.  During one of the earlier disappearances Erdrix was going to travel the four or five hours to Xell’s house to see what had happened.   Then Xell would show up again and be rather evasive as to his whereabouts.  He would inevitably say now its time to get back to the hard work of running this guild.  <br>
<br>
Let me tell you a little something.  I never saw Xellosx work hard.   After many requests for a Charter and a Code of Conduct, there was still nothing.  I showed Xell a couple of examples from other guilds.  He said, “These are fine!  All we have to do is change a few of the names!”   That wasn’t exactly the way I wanted to do it, but at least it was something.<br>
<br>
One of Xell’s problems was that he would never follow through.  He would say, “Big things are coming!”  but they never did.  He would talk of holding officer meetings, but none were ever scheduled.  All the while he would constantly remind the members how hard he was working for them.<br>
<br>
When he was around the message boards, I couldn’t help noticing that he had a rather condescending attitude toward the members.  He would often snap at people, and more than once I had suggested that he may want to be a little kinder in his posts, that the members should not see their leader become angry. Sometimes he would agree with me and other times he would accuse me of always taking the side of others.  Which I must admit… I often did.  I guess I felt the general membership needed a bigger voice.  Someone that maybe had a little more influence than they did.  This would especially happen with Cairpre, who knew just how to push Xell’s buttons.  Cairpre was a young lad, barely starting adolescence and very immature.  Xellosx was much older, but you would never know it by listening to their conversations.   Cairpre was booted out of the guild on a couple of occasions by Xell, when he would lose his temper.  More than once I came to the aid of Cairpre and spoke on his behalf.  The final time Cairpre had made light of the Darketernal name and that was the last straw for Xell.  Carpre was disbanded and would never be allowed back in again.  He publicly apologized several times to Xell, but to no avail.  Before he disappeared from the halls of the Stormcallers forever, Cairpre had thanked me for the times I stood up for him and gave me a gift.  An Icy Blade that I still carry to this day.<br>
<br>
While Xell continued to do very little work, he had a few requests of me.  First off, I was to get an ICQ account so that we could get instant messages.  Next he created a Hotmail email account that all Officers would use.  We were told the password and from now on we were to use that email for official guild business.  This made little sense to me.  I did not see what was wrong with our separate emails.  In addition, our website already had a chat room.  But even with all of these lines of communication, Xellosx was not an easy man to get a hold of.  Especially when he pulled one of his disappearing acts.<br>
<br>
During one of our instant messaging sessions, I had the following conversation with Xell…<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>     <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i>     Xellosx: Just so you know another one of my alts is Zelas, I had guild leadership switched to him.. so I will be on that character for a while now... I have to start him over, so put him as a level 1 Half Elf Warrior.  I plan on leveling him to Xellosx's level in just a few days in Kunark... All that needs to be said is that my main character for right now is Zelas.   Anyways I need to go, get back to you soon... in 15 or so...<br>
<br>
Kamdar: Wait, Xellosx is still the leader, correct?<br>
<br>
Xellosx: Leadership has already been passed to Zelas. which I am going to use from now on. Or for a little while at least, leadership can be passed back and forth to my characters, by the way.<br>
<br>
Kamdar: Our guild leader is gonna be a level 1?   I think for the sake of continuity you should keep it the way it is.<br>
<br>
Xellosx: He will be leveled and ready soon. he has a ton of new equipment as well.<br>
<br>
Kamdar: This is really going to cause havoc with the members not to mention the website, I wish you wouldn't.<br>
<br>
Xellosx: How so? I will let all know that Xellosx = Zelas…  not a big deal..  I plan on playing both characters, Xellosx is an officer and Zelas is now leader... so people will get used to it in no time.  Also,Erdrix will now be playing his warrior, Ragna.<br>
<br>
Kamdar: What about the front page of the website with the pictures and descriptions of you and Erd as leaders…. or the leaders title at the top of the members page?<br>
<br>
Xellosx:  Leave it as it is... its not important, because Xellosx is still to be considered leader, I am only saying I will be playing Zelas a bit.. as long as people know that Zelas=Xellosx then theres no problem.<br>
 <br>
Kamdar: Guess I will need a new picture of the new leaders, I don't really like this but you are the boss....I think it is confusing for continuity sake....Why don't you ask the other officers what they think?<br>
<br>
Xellosx:  No you dont need a new picture man i will put Xellosx back as leader in a week or so.. no one even needs to know.. infact ok Xellosx is still to be considered leader...<br>
<br>
Kamdar: Signing off....Later.<br>
<br>
Xellosx:  Eh, are you mad?<br>
<br>
Kamdar: Nope just a little confused....NP!<br>
<br>
Xellosx:  The picture doesnt need to be changed, nor does the page Xellosx is leader I am just playing a different character for a little while.. nothing has changed I was just informing you of my new character for a little while..<br>
<br>
Kamdar: It will be done on the web page in about an hour  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :p --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":p"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->     <br>
<br>
Xellosx:  lol all you need to do man is add Zelas to my alts section thats it. heh...</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--></b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
Well, it appeared that I got him to do a complete turn around… Here I was trying to build a history for us and Xell was immediately trying to re-write it!   It was a very small victory…I eventually changed Ragna to the Co-leader and made the front page description a little more generic sounding.  I also replaced the picture of Xell and Erdrix with one of an approaching storm.  As it turned out, that picture would become very prophetic.<br>

“All Will Be Revealed…”</h3><!--EZCODE HTML END--><br>
A couple of weeks before the Cairpre incident, Ienoldar had asked me if I thought of breaking away and maybe starting our own guild. I had told him that I had put so much into this guild that it felt like mine and I wanted to see if we could make it work.  But the idea had already occurred to me and would bounce around in my brain for some time.  After, Cairpre was ousted, Ienoldar left a post on our website.  <br>
<br>
“The time has come when I have to make a stand.   For the past months I've been thinking about staying or leaving the Stormcallers. And as of today I have made my decision to take the final step out of the guild. Don't misunderstand me, I love you guys with all of my heart and I really enjoyed being out in the field with you.  But the guild is too unorganized for my taste   There is no planning what so ever from the leader before the raids.  Most of the times we don't even have a leader at the raids.   I really like you as a person Xellosx but you must admit that you failed as our leader.   I want to through a BIG thank you to all of you Especially Kamdar who have been putting in tons of hours on the web design to keep the guild together.  Best of luck to all of you in the future.  The Stormcaller has left the building.”<br>
<br>
Cairpre , who was still keeping an eye on our board , then chimed in with “Xell this will prolly make you NEVER wanna let me back in the guild but as Ienoldar has stated  you have failed as a leader to us, you hardly ever show up at the raids, your never on, and well your mean.....Xell if I were you I would hand over my position as guild leader to someone more capable of doing the job.”<br>
<br>
Xell’s responded as eloquently as ever,” You are dumb....I haven’t failed anything... let the people who doubt go.. and Cairpre you will never ever be a leader or an officer to any guild... they would kick you out faster then I did... I'm right here.. what now huh?”<br>
<br>
I was a little shocked by Ienoldar’s sudden departure, though it was not totally unexpected.  I had hoped that when or if it came time to leave, that several of us would plan ahead and do it at once.  Now one of the Officers had already left.  Also, Ien had been my first recruit and I was saddened to see him leave.<br>
<br>
While all this was going on, Officer Arrwen had been quietly beefing up our ranks with some of her good friends.  She invited Arathain, Cobo, Niarki, and her brother Wamphyre into the guild.  Little did I know that every one of these new members would play an important part in our future. However, at present, they were all a little too new to be considered for our now vacant officer position.  <br>
<br>
And so, at my request, Wiggam Wauggam stood before Xellosx and several of the other officers of the Stormcallers.  Including myself, Erdrix and Eilonen were there.<br>
<br>
The discussion turned into more of an interview of Xellosx, as Wiggam wondered if he really wanted to be an officer, serving under him.  “What are your plans and goals for our guild?” Wiggam asked. <br>
<br>
Xellosx responded with, “My plans will all be revealed within due time”<br>
<br>
“Sounds like you are being evasive.  Why so dark and mysterious?”<br>
<br>
“Yes, I am dark, but it is really none of your concern.”<br>
<br>
The conversation went on like that for some time.  Wiggam was putting Xell through his paces!  At one point he even called him a little twisted.  Erdrix leaned over and whispered in Xell’s ear, “Wigs acting like a dick to you, yes..but his intentions are valorous... and you know it.”   <br>
<br>
Xellosx was obviously becoming annoyed.  After the meeting he had a discussion with me. <br>
<br>
“Kam, I am not too pleased”<br>
<br>
“Because Wig has concerns and questions?” I asked.<br>
<br>
“Oh its so much more then that Kam.... I don't appreciate people trying to rival me  ...I don’t appreciate being threatened.. and I sure as hell don’t like attitude directed at me.  Even Eilonen just commented on Wiggam, and Erdrix wasn’t too happy either.”<br>
<br>
I must have missed something…”What threats?  He was asking about goals and intentions of the guild, was he not?  Isn't it wise to know what one stands for?”<br>
<br>
Xellosx responded, “Kam, it almost seems like you don’t believe me.  Do you have any resentment towards me Kam? Honestly?”<br>
<br>
I ignored the resentment question and countered with “Do you like blind followers...or people that have opinions, and mutual respect?”<br>
<br>
“We have no blind followers in our guild.” He said flatly.<br>
<br>
“Truthfully I have been worried about the future of the guild.  Sometimes I have felt like the only one working at it.” I said.<br>
<br>
Now it was Xell’s turn to ignore my statement, “Come on Kam you are older then I am, surely you could tell what he was trying to do...”<br>
<br>
I played dumb, ‘I am sorry, maybe its the beers, but no, what was he trying to do?”<br>
<br>
“In my opinion, and that of Eilonen and Erd, he was trying to one up me every step of the way.” Since Eilonen and Erd were no longer in the room, Xell had no problem speaking for them.  <br>
<br>
“All I know is that he took his time deciding whether to join this guild...I think it was an important decision for him.  If we cannot talk frankly, then we cannot talk at all.”<br>
<br>
Xellosx countered, “Frank is one thing, being a dick is another.”<br>
<br>
“I do not think he was being a dick, from what I saw all his questions were valid.”<br>
<br>
“Yes they all were.. but Kam thats not even what I am talking about man, it was the attitude, the feeling you get... he had to use all these bigass words and try and one up me, twist my words around.  He'll never match me!”<br>
<br>
“I also feel you were being a little cryptic....’All will be revealed...’  Huh?”<br>
<br>
“Dude he was being the same way I wonder how you could only notice me when everyone else seemed to have noticed him.  The nerve to call me dark and twisted... even if I am dark and twisted .. sheesh”<br>
<br>
“You did kind of admit it, as I remember!”<br>
<br>
“Of course I did.. I'm not going to lie... but wtf.,.,.”<br>
<br>
I was starting to get tired of this conversation and thought I would try to wrap things up. “So, do I assume you would not want Wig as an officer?”<br>
<br>
Xell surprised me with “No, as an officer he would be great... as a friend of mine... Hah!  I don’t think so!”<br>
<br>
“That’s what makes guilds interesting.” I said.<br>
<br>
Xell agreed, “Yep... I have a feeling ES is going to get ALOT more interesting soon.”<br>
<br>
I did not say anything, but I couldn’t help but think that he was right.  And although Wiggam turned down the offer of promotion, things were indeed going to get real interesting.<br>
<br>
Xellosx then headed back to the message board…” Some of you seem to think I enjoy arguing, however you couldn’t be more wrong. I work hard in whatever time I have on ES, I want to make a great guild here.  I don’t especially like removing anyone, or seeing people leave. I already know for a fact the opinions of some of you..(even my officers) and that’s fine. But the doubting and testing me has to go.  I also find it annoying to be undermined, and being told what to do and how to do it. We are all on the same team here, under the same flag.  We're supposed to be tight like a family, but I can see that we have a ways to go before that happens.”<br>
<br>
A couple of days later Ienoldar apologized for leaving the Stormcallers and told Xellosx, “I realize how much the Stormcallers really meant to me  And Xellosx you actually showed me that you are willing to fight for this guild to be number one.  Needless to say I regret that I quit the guild.   So Xellosx, if you ever can forgive me and need someone to stand up and fight.  I'm here and I'm willing to make our dreams come true.”<br>
<br>
Xellosx welcomed Ien back with open arms and went back to his hard work of running the guild.  Essentually that meant inviting former members of Valor of Virtopia into the Eternal Stormcallers.  Varden and Ashamen were instantly named Co-Leaders.  Charleena was made an Officer.  <br>
<br>
All of them had the last name Darketernal.<br>
<br>
I guess Xellosx’s ultimate plans for the guild were finally being revealed.   The Darketernals were running the show, and they were all strangers to us.<br>

Seeds of Discontent</h3><!--EZCODE HTML END--><br>
Burak and Wiggam were like the Angel and Devil on my shoulders. They were the Ying and the Yang.  That Ogre would always be giving me evil ideas, while Wig tried to be the voice of reason. But all three of us were good friends.  I was hunting with them in The Overthere and the conversation was turning to our options.  <br>
<br>
Burak was filling my head with thoughts of rebellion, “The Ogre in me says that you start a new guild and website. Incorporate the stormcaller tag in the new name like Stormcaller Elite and use the Stormcallers website to point to the new site… That should chap their ass!   <br>
<br>
This sounded very appealing to me.  Oh, what I wouldn’t give to see the look on Xellosx’s face as his guild was slipped out right from underneath him.  He would flip his lid!  Of course Wiggam pointed out that it was not a very honorable way to do things and I should be more up front about it, if I intended to leave.  He also asked me if I wanted to start all over again, after the hard work of building both the website and the guild.  After all, wasn’t I trying to take a breather?<br>
<br>
You see, I had recently stepped down as an Officer.  I had told the others that I did not have enough time to put into the game and I had to focus on other things.  This was partially true.  But it was also true that I did not feel like serving as an officer under Xellosx and the rest of the Darketernals any longer.   I also wanted to see if our leaders would step up to the plate now that my role was diminished.  Maybe they would start leading their own guild. <br>
<br>
I also I felt unappreciated. Xellosx kept me as an Officer, as one Darketernal after another was put in the ranks of Leader.  I felt taken for granted.  He would just send me an email or instant message that would say, “Add the latest Darketernal to the Leaders section!”   They were new to the guild and none of us knew anything about them.  This did not sit well with me.  I told Xell that I would keep up the website as best I could, but I would not be able to be around as much.<br>
<br>
And now, as I stood there on the slopes at the edge of The Overthere, the discussion went on.  Burak and Wiggam essentially said that whatever I decided, they would back me.  I could tell though, that they were both clearly conflicted.  The big guy still had real life friends in Mensa D'Morte that were constantly trying to lure him over.  Wiggam thought that as long as we could just hang out and hunt together, that what went on in the rest of the guild didn’t really matter that much.  I decided not to do anything rash.  Maybe we could give it just a little more time.<br>
<br>
                       _____________________<br>
<br>
<br>
A few days later Arathain announced that he wanted a raid.  Rather than wait for the Leaders to set one up, which they had yet to do, I suggested that he try to get one going himself.   “I would suggest you just go ahead and schedule one, see if people sign up, and maybe you will get a decent turnout. Bungleneck did this and it turned out to be a fairly decent raid. We have had others though with dismal turnouts. It seems to be quite an endeavor to get a large group of us together.”<br>
<br>
Varden joined the discussion, “Well to go on a raid for the sake of raiding is no good.. We need a goal here. Is there something we are after? Need an item? Want to rescue a holy relic of some sort from the vile clutches of Soandso?” <br>
<br>
Probably spurred on by my suggestion, Arathain went ahead and set up the raid.  It was to be a raid on Runnyeye, Sunday, July 1, 2001.   I was glad he set it up and hoped all would go smoothly.  After all, why should he wait for the leaders to set one up?  As far as I could see they were sitting on their hands.  Sadly, this was the first raid that I would be unable to attend, and I hoped all would go well.   Unfortunately he had an extremely low turnout.  <br>
<br>
The next day Arathain posted the following, with the header: “Another Failed Raid Attempt,” <br>
<br>
“Well, so much for that. Only Cobo, Arrwen, Wamphyre, and myself showed. There were other people online at the time, but we were the only ones able to make it, I guess. We decided 4 people didn't constitute much of a raid, so we cancelled.”<br>
<br>
Xellosx responded with “Keep in mind that this raid was not organized nor planned by any of the leaders. Saying &quot;another failed raid attempt&quot; does not apply to this situation. Also, I believe the post by Varden clearly states that having a raid just for the sake of going on a raid isn't such a good idea. Had this been more planned out, it might have been more successful. If anyone has an idea for a raid, feel free to submit one. I think however, that a goal for a raid is needed, instead of having one with no purpose.”<br>
<br>
Tactful, as usual.<br>
<br>
Arathain quickly answered, “The purpose, Xell, was to try and have a guild event, where some of the members could get together and get to know each other better. I would think that this would be an ideal reason for a leader to attend an event. I have kept up with what's going on in the guild, and have posted on many occasions, but have yet to do anything for or get anything out of the guild outside of the message board. And frankly, I would like for the guild to be a little more organized and social. So I tried to help this along. I did not originally plan on organizing the raid, nor did I want to, but when I asked for one, none of the leaders seemed interested in organizing one, and I was told to go ahead and schedule it. I would have thought that the leaders would have tried to support their minions, and maybe help organize (or at least try to attend) any guild function, even if it was &quot;not organized nor planned by any of the leaders&quot;. I mean, I know of 3 leaders that were in Norrath at the time and only Arrwen showed up. But it doesn't matter anyway, because it wasn't planned by the leaders, so it doesn't count, I guess. So I suppose I'll just keep my nose out of things and wait for the &quot;leaders&quot; to do something.”<br>
<br>
Cobo tried to remain calm, “You both have really good points, why dont we just try it again soon?<br>
<br>
Several members also added their input, but to my surprise, it was Varden Darketernal that tried to put things in perspective.  “Lets not get all bent out of shape here, throwing condescending remarks at people will not solve any problems. First of all try to remember we are just a baby guild, and not all of our kinks have been worked out. Secondly it is not the intention of the guild leaders to reign supreme and not let members have minds of their own. Everyone counts here, no exceptions to that rule.”<br>
<br>
Arrwen echoed Varden’s thoughts, “Thank you Varden. Well put.”<br>
<br>
Varden started to seem like a Darketernal that I might be able to deal with.  I wrote to him asking if he could possibly explain the whole Darketernal thing to me, since I was apparently out of the loop.  I also voiced my concerns over Xell’s lack of follow through on anything.  And I asked what had happened to Ragna (formerly Erdrix).  He was still listed as a leader but no one had seen him for several weeks. It had reminded me of Xell’s old disappearing acts.<br>
<br>
Here was his response...<br>
<br>
&quot;The issue of Ragna is that he has been out of the country for awhile, I personally am not sure when he is going to return but Xellosx is more in contact with him.<br>
“Now as far as leaders go, the guild is sponsored by House Darketernal, which is headed by myself. House Darketernal is not just in Everquest but in many many places and has been around for about 5 years and also does not exist only in the cyber realm. Since the guild is sponsored by House Darketernal, all of the family have been given leader status, which means all are of equal standing in this guild. Now as far as who is in charge overall it should not matter. Now as far as leaders are going our.. structure is going to change soon. Instead of just having &quot;leaders&quot; and &quot;officers&quot; we will be having a council of elders which will probably be 1 high level character from every class in our guild. The leaders will stay in place as sort of like uh... being at the top of the pecking order. Which means when people outside of the guild are upset they can yell at us. The leaders will still be on the highest level ! but the decisions will be made by the elders and all elders whether they are leaders.. or officers or whatever will have a say. Also it is good to have more than one leader as it keeps everyone in check including the leaders. <br>
“As far as follow through.. don't worry my friend, but also stay patient. We are trying to do something no one else has done and hopefully it will work, but we need to make sure we got it right before we introduce it to the guild.<br>
“I admit, we need to pick up our room a little here as rearrange the furniture...maybe even remodel the entire damned house but, hey we will get it done.. the more help we have.. the quicker we will get it done.”<br>
<br>
<br>
Well, I was happy he answered me so quickly and openly, but I was also not very pleased to hear that the guild that I helped create was “sponsored” by some previously unknown entity.<br>
<br>
Later that day Xellosx again responded to Arathain’s raid and the discussion that followed, “It was not my intention to be &quot;harsh&quot; with Arathain, although it appears we both were with each other. I apologize, however i would not like to see this happen again, on anyones account.. We're all a family clan, not supposed to be enemies. At any rate, if you want it you wil get it. Now for the GOOD news.....The leaders will plan a raid, just to show that we are not slackers ^_^<br>
We have a rough job just keeping the guild running, but sure we'll take yet another job and supply you all with a great raid. =-)&quot;<br>
<br>
Somehow Xell can come off as apologetic and condescending at the same time.  And he was kindly going to give everyone a raid, even though it might interfere with his busy schedule… Oh Boy!<br>
<br>
Needless to say I was less than impressed.  And I finally decided that it was almost time to make a move.<br>
<br>
                          _____________<br>
<br>
<br>
That night I was back in The Overthere with Wiggam and Burak.  I told them what I intended to do.  Wiggam still thought that I may be acting hasty.  Burak said he was behind me.  But I knew his heart was in another place. I thanked him for his friendship and loyalty, then I told him that he should really go with Mensa D'Morte.  I knew that was where he wanted to be.  He offered me his alternates Nymwasob and Elaam and I gladly accepted their allegiance. <br>
<br>
Now with Wiggam seeing that “The Three” would no longer be in the same guild.  He had his own thinking to do.  Paladins are men of honor.  When he pledged himself to The Eternal Stormcallers, it was not a thing he took lightly.  It was something that he intended to do only once.  Still with far off dreams of The Guardian Lords in his eyes, he promised to go down this road with me… at least for a little bit, to see where it would lead. <br>
<br>
As the night drew to a close we made camp, with the knowledge that things were going to change.  And for what I was planning, I knew that I was going to need more help.  Before I turned in, I shot a letter off to Arrwen.  It was probably the briefest letter I had ever written.<br>
<br>
“One question...” it said, ”Will you follow me if I start a new guild?”<br>

<br>
Yes brothers and sisters,  I confess. <br>
It was I who gave little Cairpre the ammo. <br>
Dorketernal was the spur under his saddle. <br>
 <br>
I remember the anguish over whether to go with Kam ( EF), Wig ( GL ), or Scott (Mensa). <br>
I remember watching the paths the three guilds took. <br>
Put all three on hotkeys and watched the rosters.<br>
I checked the message boards.<br>
<br>
The things I learned from all I watched.<br>
   <br>
A website with a message board is key to holding a guild together.<br>
A designated place for like or similar levels to play together and grind is essential to grow a guild.<br>
If more than 6 are there, two groups need formed.<br>
Everyone in guild is invited and welcomed ( even necros ).<br>
 <br>
I am still the clown who did not train in channeling for like 30 levels.<br>
I do not know to this day if I should be proud of it, or just amazed, embarrased  ( too many toons to track all the skills ).<br>
Amused is what I settle on.<br>
Laugh at yourself.<br>
 <br>
I miss Kam bein on as much as he used to be. <br>
I miss the old guildies.<br>
Even the two faced backstabbers that we remember.<br>
I remember I told you so. <br>

The Eye of the Storm</h3><!--EZCODE HTML END--><br>
“Welcome. If you've come this far, you probably know why you're here.”<br>
<br>
Those were my first words in the secret chamber that we had come together in (actually a hastily created message board).  I had dubbed it “The Eye of the Storm” and we referred to ourselves as The Secret Society of Stormcallers.  We were essentially, a guild within a guild.<br>
<br>
Officers Arrwen, Ienoldar and Eilonen  (as his alternate Tomani) were there. <br>
<br>
Arrwen had recruited Arathain, Cobo, Niarki, Wamphyre and a few others that had not yet joined any guild, Tanluin, Chonn and Herbdiva.  Ienoldar, had brought in his wife Angeleena as well as Bygdogg and Genene. And of course, Burak and Wiggam were there.<br>
<br>
It was fairly late in the evening, and by the time I would stop talking it would be after midnight.   But when I had started to speak, it was still July 4th.  The date did not escape me.<br>
<br>
I cleared my throat and went on. “We have come here to discuss our future with The Eternal Stormcallers and what our options might be.  As you know, I have not been very pleased with our leader Xellosx, and find it harder and harder to serve under him. I have been troubled by what I consider his lack of any of the really good qualities a leader should have.  I do not like the way he addresses his fellow guild mates on the message board. It is often in a condescending and not very respectful tone. <br>
<br>
“He seldom follows through on his plans. He has only shown up for one guild event. And he never informs the officers what his ultimate plans for the guild are.  Although several times he has referred to some master plan and all will be revealed in time. As far as I can see his only plan is to keep adding more leaders to the top of the members list with the last name of Darketernal.  I then told them of the recent letter I had received from Varden.  The one explaining the whole Darketernal sponsored guild thing. <br>
<br>
“Ok,” I went on, “Besides the fact that none of us knew this about the Darketernals going in, it is still rather insulting to see name after name added to the leaders without us knowing a thing about these guys. Varden appears to have a cool head and a much better disposition than Xellosx, and so far I have not had any problems with him. Except of course the continued secrecy of whatever it is that they think they are planning.  There is more I could complain about at this first meeting, but I think you all know what I am talking about.  So what do we do? <br>
<br>
“We can just ignore the leaders, hang out with our usual buddies and try not to let them have an impact on our lives in Norrath.  We can quit and join another guild or forget about guild life altogether.  Or we can try to create something on our own, for ourselves with nothing to do with The House Darketernal. <br>
<br>
“I think I am for this last idea. But it would be starting all over again. We may want to keep the guild small at first, and only accept people in that we genuinely like and respect, and enjoy adventuring with. It may be awhile until we could have big guild events, but we could try for smaller ones. There is nothing wrong with a small guild, and I guess it just depends on what you want from it. <br>
<br>
“If we do decide to create a new guild many things will have to be discussed. How will the leader be determined?” I had earlier expressed my thoughts to Wig and Bur that I was unsure if I was cut out to lead myself.  One of the reasons I had stepped down as an officer was because of pressures outside of Norrath. As a matter of fact I had joked with Wiggam that my ultimate plan was to create a new guild just so he could be the leader!  I was only half joking though,  I had always thought that Wiggam had the makings of a true leader.&quot;<br>
  <br>
I continued on, “Will there be one leader or a council?  Should leaders have terms? Should there be elections? What would we call ourselves?”  Should it be something with the Stormcaller name in it, like Stormcallers Elite, Stormcallers Forever, or maybe name it after our secret chamber, Eye of the Storm?  Perhaps others felt differently and would like to rid themselves completely of the word.  Anyhow, please tell me how you feel, and remember, do not speak of this in Guildchat, or to any Darketernals. For now I would prefer this to remain between us few conspirators.”<br>
<br>
Burak explained to the others that he was joining Mensa.  But that two of his alts would be here for the ride.  Then he said, “There are more people not happy with the situation than you can believe. I am constantly getting tells about some absurd comment or another by Xellosx.  As an organizational comment, our leader should be an elected official. One that understands that Kamdar has the power to commandeer the website that we all check. I would like to nominate Wiggam to be our leader. He has shown all the qualities that being a leader are all about. He enjoys attending events and does not gate out at the first sign of trouble. He has been available to help anyone of us in need.  However it shakes out, I would kill to see Xellosx face when he checks the website to find that it now points to a new guild.”<br>
<br>
Arrwen went next, “My thoughts would be not to elect Leaders as they can never be removed. I think the leader should be kept as management purposes only. Where we would rely on our officers for support and later elect them if that is what we desire.  To begin with I think we should decide on set officers. Wiggam certainly would be a choice of mine as well. I think Kamdar since you maintain the site and have a great history with everything you have done, you are my choice as leader. I would if given the task prefer to have Arri (her Alternate and Main character) as an officer as opposed to Arrwen. I have other ideas for people as officers. But first let's see where their interests lie.”<br>
<br>
“I would have no problem being the leader,” I said. “At least for the beginning. But eventually I would want someone to take over for me. We would obviously need someone who would be good at rallying the troops and who would have fun and creative ideas for events we can do together.  I believe Wiggam fits this bill as well as others. I am aware that once leadership is passed onto someone it cannot be taken away and can only be passed on voluntarily by the present leader. This would be bad if we got someone in there that abused or mishandled their power. So it would be important that we get someone in there we all trust.”<br>
<br>
Others agreed that Wiggam or I would be good choices for a leader.<br>
<br>
Wiggam then spoke up, “Let me start by saying I didnt want things to go this way. I think any thoughts of leaving the guild should be discussed in the open with all of the Eternal Stormcallers. But in loyalty to Kamdar and Burak I have to let you folks know what I think.<br>
<br>
”If we are not happy with the way ES is working out, then no one should feel bad for leaving and starting over, or joining another guild. I’m not sure I feel the need to leave ES, but I would rather play with Kam or Bur than just about anyone I’ve met in the game so far.  I feel I am capable of ignoring Xell. To be honest I feel he has no &quot;Real Power&quot; over anything...especialy me. But I will lend all my strength to Kam and Bur in their decisions. Bur is going to another guild. And thats the best option for him... May your path be strong friend.  Kam’s thinking of starting another guild, thats fine too. Yes Kam would be a great leader. But I don’t think he wants to put that kinda time and energy into this right now? If you want I’ll be some kinda &quot;leader&quot; but we would make it so anytime a majority wanted leaders could be changed.  All this stuff would be determined before ever starting a new guild.  All I’m looking for is a regular group of six or so people I like, to play Everquest with, to adventure with and to grow with. If I need to leave this guild to do that I will.  If I have to lead another guild to do that I will.  If I have to have words with Xell to keep us together then I will.  The Paladin just looks for worthy comrades.  And he will do what he needs to find them, keep them, and share with them”<br>
<br>
Arrwen said, “Wiggam, I understand how you feel and I think that is very noble of you to be up front and honest with ES. I on the other hand want to make sure all of my ducks are in a row before I approach ES with the fact that I am leaving. You are right I can easily ignore Xell. When I joined the guild we were all younguns and I felt close to many guild mates. I even liked Xell.  But I also didn’t know I was joining a family of Darketernal's. Now there is a level 6 leader Darketernal, new to the guild. I never agreed to any of these new leaders nor have I ever gotten the chance to get and know them because they all sort of pop up out of nowhere. One day they aren't a member of the guild, the next they are a leader.  The leader is someone that I think should be agreed upon. They hold the ultimate power of the guild. That's why I think I would be happy with this new guld using the leader only for management purposes (at least in the beginning) and having the guild utilize its officers. Let the officers plan raids, social events, invite members etc. The leader can take care of anyone who would abuse such powers.  Although with us all starting out small and familiar I dont believe anyone would abuse such powers.”<br>
<br>
Arathain spoke up, “First let me say, I'm in. Like Wiggam, I also tried to ignore Xell, but as most of you know, wasn't too successful. Anyway, I don't think we should keep Stormcallers as the name. Just cut out, and be done. As far as a leader, I would vote for Kam, if he has the time to devote. If not, I will definitely support Wiggam. I don't think the leaders should have terms. I think we should put someone in and leave them.  I liked being a Stormcaller very much, but it seems all my reasons for liking it are starting a new guild!!  So, I follow, without hesitation.”<br>
<br>
Then Ienoldar let us know his thoughts. “I think you all know how I felt before, when I quit The Stormcallers.  I have for a very long time been unhappy with the way the guild is working. It is very unorganized, and yes lately Xellosx have been more interested in getting his so called family members in the guild than doing something for the members.  I have discussed this issue with Kamdar before and I was even back then ready to start a new guild.  The one and only reason why I came back to ES again was you guys, I always enjoyed having such good friends out in the field.  As far as leader I agree that Wiggam is a very good choice, and he have proven this more than once.  Of course Kamdar is a very good choice as well.  The two are just full of energy and ideas and that’s what we really need.  But I think we should take this slow.  Before we start the guild we should set the rules together and make sure that everybody agrees to the decisions.  The name though...Stormcallers Elite sounds really good, so does Eye Of The Storm.&quot;<br>
<br>
Cobo then expressed concerns that maybe Burak’s idea of pointing the Stormcaller’s website to our possible new site was maybe not such a noble endeavor.  He thought it would be mean and would not support it.<br>
<br>
Arrwen agreed with him, “We don’t want to appear to any that may not know of our feelings that we are A-holes. We are just several disillusioned members that have a good amount of energy to change our feelings from disillusioned to focused. And that focus is a guild that we can be proud of. Where there are no oddities or secrets. Of course &quot;all will be revealed&quot; later!” she joked.<br>
<br>
Burak was humbled, “You are right. It was mean spirited of me to suggest it in the first place. BUT, the look on his face would have been priceless.”<br>
<br>
I too felt a little humbled. I loved Burak’s idea when I first heard it, but now realized that Cobo and Arrwen had an excellent point.<br>
<br>
Chonn, who I learned was father to Cobo, Arathain and Niarki had been taking it all in.  Now he spoke up, “I am not a member of any guild, but have three children in the Stormcallers so I was considering joining them. If my children go - and they seem to be interested, I would support your efforts. I do not know how much help I can add to your guild. My time is truly not my own. But I enjoy the game, love to explore and map, and for as much as I can be on-line, I will give 100% to the group. <br>
<br>
“In the matter of breaking away from the old group and starting a new one: I suggest that you avoid poking your finger in the other guy's eye. It's a temptation, and people are annoyed, but don't start the new with animosity towards the old. It flavors everything you do. Don't mimic their name - do something different to reflect your needs. Fellowship has been mentioned: Consider “Fellowship of the Light” “Legion of Force” or “Band of Buds.”  But don't begin the new with malice toward the old.”<br>
<br>
I think it was then that I realized how wise this barbarian was.  And also how wise, noble and thoughtful all of these other folks were too.  I was honored to be in such good company.<br>
<br>
Others then offered their support and also their own suggestions as to what we should be called.  For it appeared that we were going to move forward with this endeavor. <br>
 <br>
It wasn’t a bad start at all.<br>
<br>

Whispers in the Dark</h3><!--EZCODE HTML END--><br>
Soon after Burak decided to join Mensa D’Morte he posted a message on The Eternal Stormcallers message board announcing that he had left the guild.<br>
<br>
Varden responded, “Well I must say this is a shock.  Burak,  though we only fought together in The Overthere one time, it was a great time.  I know not the reasons why you left, but I am troubled that you have. I can only wish that you should stay with us, but I know too that sometimes one must go their own way.  It was very difficult for me to leave my old guild to come here but I knew it was the right thing. So I hope this is the right thing for you.<br>
If not .. do come back my friend.&quot;<br>
<br>
Arrwen/Arri followed up, “Peace be with you. I would also like to bid my farewell to the guild. Best of luck in your endeavors. Goodbye ES.<br>
<br>
If the Darketernals didn’t know that trouble was on the horizon before, this would surely start them wondering.<br>
<br>
Meanwhile back in “The Eye of the Storm”, names were flying back and forth as to what our new name would be.  I had submitted several ideas, most of them had included the word “storm” in them, i.e. Eye of the Storm, Elite Stormcallers, Stormcallers Elite, Stormcallers Forever, Storm Callers, Storm Slayers and the never popular Stormcallers: The Special Edition!<br>
<br>
I also came up with, The New Dawn, Guardians of Forever and Guardians of Light<br>
<br>
Tanluin liked The New Dawn, but also offered up Eternal Ring.  Burak suggested The Shortbus Kids! Everyone had suggestions and we were coming up with quite a list.  Among them were…<br>
<br>
The Rising Storm<br>
Eternal Light<br>
Fellowship of Light<br>
Guardians of Light<br>
Guardians of the Eternal Light <br>
Circle of Light<br>
Circle of Fire <br>
Exodus<br>
Rings of Future<br>
Rings of Luclin<br>
Rebels of Kunark<br>
Eye of the Tiger<br>
Belly of the Beast<br>
The Secret Storm<br>
The Edge of Night! <br>
<br>
And my new personal favorite, <br>
Stormtracker with Doppler Radar!<br>
<br>
Cobo was not fond of any of the names with the word ‘storm’ in it.  “I dont want to be reminded of ES every time I log on. Renegades or Rebels or something along those lines would be appropriate.”  Then he changed the subject,  “How long before we form up? We should be discussing this other stuff in our first guild meeting! FREEDOM!”<br>
<br>
But, while Cobo and many others were expressing their enthusiasm in getting this thing going as soon as possible, Wiggam thought that we might be moving too fast.  <br>
<br>
He wrote me a letter:<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> ”Hey friend, <br>
<br>
I have to write this so you know where I'm coming from. All this talk of a new guild is moving rather quickly I think. <br>
I really think you ought to give the Darketernals a chance to answer any challenges before moving to another guild. I don't like Xell you know that. But since Varden has come over, he has been replying to many messages in a positive direction. I feel you/we/I should let them know we didn’t sign up to be Darketernal lackeys. That putting anyone in charge you want (without any consideration or communication to or for others ) is not the way to go. That a guild has to be a true honest family, not a plaything for the family. That there needs to be more communication in the process.<br>
 <br>
Now I know you feel you have voiced some of those concerns in the past. That you feel Xell is controlling and reckless. I know you think you will just receive the same flak and don't really care to try again. I know you don't like how Xell treats people. All this is very true and you have good reasons to feel that way. But there is something to be said for giving the guilty a chance to realize their errors. Not Xell so much as I think Varden might step up to the plate. With the reality of a lot of members moving on outta ES they just might start being a little bit better. If not at least your were honest and tried to reconcile things. You can leave without any hard feelings.<br>
<br>
Now about me.... I gotta be honest... I’m having a hard time thinking about leaving the Stormcallers. I dont like Xell. But like I said earlier Xell doesn't affect me either. I think Varden may be the leader this guild needed. And that’s really funny because I don't like Varden on an ego level. He's a higher level Pally and that stings Wiggam ( See I can be petty too ) But I think he wants what’s best for the Stormcallers. He posted a sincere message about Burak leaving.....wishing he wouldn't go. Again no one gave him a chance to fix the problem and so he was caught off guard. Maybe he is not aware of all the concerns in the guild. I think Xell would take a back seat to him.  Remember we did agree to stick with this...no matter how hard it got. Got into this knowing there would be growing pains. Began this knowing there would be lessons to learn and hardships to overcome. Has everyone (and I know you have ) put enough work into this to really say &quot;Hey it failed so sorry...lets start again.<br>
<br>
Let me end this by saying I will follow you whereever you go. I do this because I feel you would probably do the same. My loyalty is to my friends not a &quot;named group&quot;. If you want to start a new guild it has to go even slower than this one did. Everyone has to know ahead of time what to expect. <br>
<br>
Everyone will be required to work hard at it and participate. And I think everyone must realize this and truly understand that before you would start a new guild.&quot; </i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> </b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
That letter got me to thinking, Wiggam had raised some valid points.  He was also not fond of the idea of sneaking off like thieves in the night.  Thinking that I needed to discuss things with Wiggam face to face, I entered Norrath with the hopes of finding him.<br>
  <br>
An hour later, I was in a second floor room in North Freeport, with Wiggam, Varden and Xellosx.  Before the meeting both Wig and I had relayed to Varden about what we thought were some of the problems. I told him of my disappointment as to the way Xell had been conducting himself. He listened to every word and agreed with me that Xell may not be the person for leading the Stormcallers.<br>
<br>
Now, as Wig and I stood before two of the Darketernals, Varden started to lay out new plans for the guild and said that he would be posting something on the Eternal Stormcallers Message Board shortly. Xellosx basically stood there in the meeting and kept his mouth shut.   Varden was clearly in charge.<br>
<br>
I encouraged Varden to make his post as soon as he could.  That the future of the guild was in danger and he needed to act quickly.  He promised me he would.  Then we all shared a drink and went our separate ways.<br>
<br>
I then went back to The Eye of the Storm’s board and told my fellow conspirators what had transpired.  With Wiggam’s permission, I shared his letter with them.  I urged the others to look for Varden's post, and offer their honest opinions and feedback. “Without getting mean, if you can help it!” I said.  “I do not want us to resort to the same curt and tense replies that some of us were subjected to.  When we first entered this chamber, I said it was to discuss our options. Little of that has been discussed and it seems we have been on a runaway train. I thank you all for your friendship and loyalty to me. But maybe we should give this thing with The Eternal Stormcallers another chance. If there is anyone that is angry and or disappointed with me for having brought all of you to the edge, and now maybe asking you not to jump, please understand that I really want what is best for us. And I hope you all feel the same way.”<br>
<br>
Many did not care to wait for Varden’s post.<br>
<br>
Arathain was the first to vocalize his feelings, “Well, if the two people we were discussing possibly being the leader of a new and better guild are wishy washy about it, maybe it's not such a good idea. However, I have done all the contemplating necessary to realize that ES is not good for me. With all of this going on, I was excited for the first time in a long time about possibly being a part of a group in EQ. My decision is this: there will be a new guild. This new development may set us back a little while, but I am in no rush. Arathain has gone solo before.  I will continue to check the message board until either a new guild is started, or until via political alleys, the House Darketernal manages to squash our little rebellion. Ultimately, I would like to see as many of you join with me in a new, and better guild.  Kamdar - I still look to you for guidance and direction, but you need to make your decision. I'll follow you anywhere but back into the clutches of the House Darketernal.”<br>
<br>
Then, Arri told me where she stood. “Kamdar, I am sorry you are feeling that things have progressed too fast. I have been away for the last couple of days and came back to a lot of posts. The last post we were voting on names for a new guild and this post we are reevaluating the situation. I have been reevaluating the situation for quite some time. I do not feel that this has been progressing too fast for me. I think from many of the previous posts that several others do not feel that it has been progressing too fast for them either. I understand your desire to reflect. I know you want to make the decision that is best for you. My decision is to start a new guild. I am not happy about many things in the guild at the moment and time will not change my mind. <br>
<br>
“The most recent annoyance to me is the explanation of Darketernal and how it has existed ....blah blah blah. You know what I am talking about. I do not like the fact that people from that club, cult, or whatever it is can join the guild and become an instant leader. A lvl 6 is a leader now. (because of his name) I did not join the guild knowing that we were part of another groups scheme.<br>
 <br>
“I want the guild to be individualistic. I want it to grow with its own purpose. ES has changed way too much for me and this change has been brought on by the dark Eternal. I do not like it. I normally welcome change but the change I welcome comes from evolution, not forced.<br>
 <br>
“Anyways these are my thoughts. Kamdar I will respect any course you choose. I will not follow you if it is back into the clutches of ES.  If We start a new guild or if I wait to join another guild, I do not know. But, you can count on me for retreat.”<br>
<br>
Niarki, Cobo and Wamphyre echoed their comments.<br>
Others waited for his post.  The next day it was there for all to read…<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i>  “IMPORTANT GUILD CHANGES!! Everyone please read and respond.<br>
<br>
Hail Stormcallers,<br>
<br>
It is no secret that lately their have been some problems with the guild in general.  I personally would like to apologize for these problems and assure you that the leaders, officers, and myself are working on solutions to these problems as quickly as possible. I ask you to please be patient as we struggle through this difficult time.” </i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> </b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
He then went through some of his planned changes.  He announced that ES would become a roleplaying guild.  He encouraged us to develop our characters and become creative.  He said that we would also develop an Initiate Program for new recruits.  This would make sure that we would be getting good quality members.  He also laid out new plans as to how the leadership would function.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> ”Now here are some things that will require everyone’s input. The idea of a council was introduced in the past. Now how this would work. First of all there has been some strange feelings towards house Darketernal as being the only leadership body.. House Darketernal is simply a banner.. This guild is an extension of the ideal.. its a family without forcing everyone to carry the surname of Darketernal. So with this council we will give the leadership back to the rest of the family in the form of the council.<br>
<br>
This is how it will work. A member from each existing class in the guild will be selected to represent that class. I will sit as overseer of the council. All things would be decided and voted upon by the council. If a deciding vote is needed I will cast the final vote. As overseer and official leader I reserve the right to veto..however my veto can be overruled by a 3/4ths vote from the council.<br>
<br>
As far as the rest of the Darketernal family is concerned they will sit as advisors or will also be allowed to be council members. Make no mistake!! I do not want a bunch of politics going on!! I hate politics.. but I also hate Tyrants.. and I will not become one in this guild nor will any other of house Darketernal.<br>
<br>
What would be looked for in a council leader is someone who is knowledgeable with the class, who plays well, knows the world of Norrath well, and can guide others of the class. <br>
One of the other points of interest that Kamdar and Xellosx brought up were inter guild awards.. like medals of Valor or badges of honor and so on.<br>
<br>
I also thought about special ranks awarded to members of each class. This is just something that would help add roleplay to the guild and make things a little more interesting.<br>
Right now that is everything I have. I want to stress that I am aware of some of the troubles in the guild. Rest assured we are working on them but I also need everyones help. This is your guild my friends. I want everyone here to be friends and communicate and interact with each other.. not just yell over guild chat.. but actually get together and chat over a brandy or go fishing together.. and of course fight evil together.<br>
<br>
In the effort to inspire roleplay and guild interaction there will be a meeting in the near future in North Freeport town hall. It will be held in guild chat but I would like everyone to be there in person. It's nice to see everyones face. This is still being planned out and it will also preceed a planned raid which will follow a few days after. Myself or one of the leaders/officers will post a time and any changes in plans etc. This will be an event in roleplay so please be in character.<br>
<br>
Now everyone I know you have concerns. I would like everyone to know that I will listen to any troubles that you may have, and will do everything in my power to help. One thing I hated in my old guild was being neglected... I would watch people start up at level 1 and then in a matter of a month was level 50 while I moved up 2 levels. I hated that... no one would group with me.. no one would help me get my corpses.. no one lifted a finger. I also hate losing friends. When I first started EQ and joined my old guild I had many many friends to help me out.. but one by one they all left for one reason or another.. but I stuck with my guild.. As I watched my friends level 20 times above me.. and slowly lost contact with them. I do not want either of those things happening with us.. So I will take the time for everyone who needs an ear.. or a helping hand.. I hope this example will also be followed. If I have to cross two continents to get your corpse out of unrest.. I will do my best to do just that.. and you have my word on it.<br>
<br>
Friends help each other.. family help each other.. and that is how I see you guys. So if you have anything you need to talk about email me or send me a tell in game.  If you have any other good ideas for the guild post below along with you comments to this post, or email me or the other leaders/officers personally. I look forward to everyone’s input.<br>
<br>
I wish you well mighty Stormcallers.<br>
Varden Darketernal”   </i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> </b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
I was impressed with the way Varden had handled himself.  Obviously he had put a lot of thought and reflection into his comments.  Most of all, he sounded sincere.  If only things had been like this from the beginning, we would not be where we were now.  My decision was weighing heavily upon me.  Should I give this man and the rest of the Stormcallers one more chance?  Certainly, building a new guild from scratch was not going to be easy.  As much trouble as the Eternal Stormcallers had been, it felt like my guild and I felt responsible to some degree about it’s future.<br>
<br>
Ienoldar was the first to respond to Varden. “Looking forward to seeing the results of this. It all sounds very good to me.  And I must say after only being with us for a short while Varden you sure made a very good impression so far.  I hope we all can raise our swords together and fight for this to make it the Ultimate Guild.”<br>
<br>
That came as a bit of a surprise.  It would not be the last time that I was to be surprised by this druid either. Several hours later I would finally make my own decision. <br>
 <br>
Before that however, many of us had gathered in the ES chat room.  Trying to discuss our future.  We were narrowing down the names for the new guild as well as making plans for the official guild forming.  We would have to meet in an EQ created chat room and we would need 10 of us in there to get the new guild name approved.  We would then have to wait a day for confirmation, and then we would need to come together in Norrath for the final step in becoming a new guild… if that was indeed what we were doing…<br>
<br>
Although Ienoldar had pledged himself to Varden and The Stormcallers, he still appeared to be on the fence.  If he left our little insurrection, he would most likely be taking his wife and their two friends with them.  Wiggam also appeared to be wavering, as he wanted to see if Varden could make this thing work.  Most of the others stood firm. <br>
 <br>
With a lot still up in the air and nothing really settled, most of us said goodnight and left the chat room.  Wiggam and Ienoldar stayed behind.  I re-entered the chat room under the name of Xellosx.<br>
<br>
“WHAT THE HELL IS GOING ON HERE?” I shouted!<br>
<br>
Surprised, Wiggam said, “Just whispers in the dark, friend.”<br>
<br>
I couldn’t go on with the charade any longer, I told them it was really me.  They fell silent at first, not knowing what to believe.  After a little more convincing they both breathed a sigh of relief when they realized it was indeed me.  It was a cruel little joke on  my part, but I hadn’t laughed so hard in a long time!  I’m not sure they saw the humor in my prank, but seemed to take it with a nervous chuckle.  I apologized for my shenanigans and said goodnight again, leaving them to their thoughts.  Then I headed to the Stormcaller’s message board.<br>

It was time to announce my intentions to Xelllosx and Varden…<br>

Posted by Kamdar Entil'Zha on 7/8/2001, 11:46 pm , in reply to &quot;IMPORTANT GUILD CHANGES!!!: Everyone please read and respond.&quot;<br>
<br>
<br>
Varden,<br>
<br>
Your ideas are good. And I think you are the best thing to happen to this guild in a long time. I only wish you arrived earlier. I believe the time has come for me to move on. Last week I put into motion plans that I cannot easily turn my back on. I intend to start a new guild. It is not something I do lightly. But I really think I need a new beginning.<br>
<br>
You don’t know how much being an important part of this guild has meant to me, and it has been tough to let go. I appreciated you contacting me yesterday and prodding me into telling you what I thought was wrong with this guild. When I shared a drink with you and Xellosx yesterday I started to have hopes that this may be avoided, but me and some others are on a different track now, and there is no turning back.<br>
<br>
<br>
Xellosx, <br>
<br>
I know that you love this guild and want the best for it. I know we have had our disagreements on occasion, but for the most part I felt I could always speak my mind with you, without fear of repercussion. Unfortunately there are many others that have not been treated as kindly. I don’t think you mean to come off as harshly as you do, but I think you have a lot of growing to do before you can truly become a good leader. <br>
<br>
One thing I have learned is to always keep the lines of communication open. When people are treated harshly they tend to shut down, and that is probably what has been happening to many in this guild. <br>
<br>
I wish there to be no hard feelings between The House Darketernal and myself and I hope you, Varden, Ragna, and the rest of your brothers and sisters have a long and successful run.<br>
<br>
This Stormcaller has left the building.<br>

<br>
<br>
I had totally forgotten that those were Ienoldar’s last words when he originally left the Stormcallers a month ago.  Time would tell if my resignation would be more permanent.  It was getting late. Relieved that I had finally got it out in the open I turned in for the night.  When I awoke the next morning there was a message from Varden.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> Well Kamdar,<br>
<br>
I must say that this comes as a surprise. I had foreseen that you might leave but I did not think it so soon. I can only beg you to stay my friend. I can honestly say that we... I need you. You are the backbone of this guild. I can not promise that it will be easy and it will always be fun.. but I do promise that if we make this thing work it will be truly rewarding. It is sad to see you go this way.. and especially now when we need you the most. I urge you to reconsider and help us make this guild amazing.<br>
<br>
But I can not force you and you if anyone deserve all things that are good. You have done more than your share already, and with very little appreciation in my honest opinion. Each must go their own way... just as I did in coming here. Rest assured your name will not be forgotten in our halls, and always will you be welcome at my side and always will you be welcome back here.<br>
<br>
Whatever you chose I know it will be for the best,<br>
<br>
Varden Darketernal</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--></b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
<br>
Arrwen/Arri went next, short and to the point… “I am behind Kamdar. Peace. Best of luck.”<br>
<br>
I imagined Varden was starting to see the guild unraveling before his eyes.  He quickly responded. “Arrwen,  It seems as if this has been thought of for a long time now...I must say I am disturbed indeed. I cannot say I know you very well but from the emails and post, I know that you too are a concerned individual. I must say also I am sorry to see you go. This is most discouraging.  Perhaps these changes are too little too late. However, in my time I have always thought that if something was worth doing.. it was worth doing well. I beg you to reconsider. I am not one to set everything in stone without everyone's consent or not listen to anyone. But then you don't know me.. so why should you trust me?  I can only offer my time to hear your concerns and that is what I have tried to do since my coming here. My offer still stands. Again I beg you to reconsider. Please Arrwen we need you here.  But like I said to Kamdar, as a friend I must be understanding as well and I am sure that what you decide will be for the best, and a place of distinction will be here for you always.  I am truly sorry that things have come to this, I hate to see friends broken up amongst themselves as well as hard feelings, and I know there are some, I am not blind.  I wish you well in what ever path you take.”<br>
<br>
I have to admit, I was starting to feel bad for one of the Darketernals.  Varden was showing a lot of class, something that had been missing from the Eternal Stormcaller leadership from the beginning.  It seemed that he really wanted to work things out.  When I had gotten home that evening there was a letter from Varden waiting for me.<br>
<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> Kamdar,<br>
<br>
        I know you have already set your wheels in motion, and I really wish you had told about this before you did it, but that can not be changed.. you really didn't know me that well. I have seen you fight hard for the best in this guild. I know you love it, and to be honest If I have to give up my spot and give it to you in order for you to stay.. I would do it. It's not the position that is important it is the people and the friends. If you want a new guild, then I offer you this.. let us work on it together.. we can break it all down and start from the beginning. Just tell me what you want and we will find out what everyone else wants and we will make it happen. No nitpicking about who is in charge, no secret family only leadership, just friends working and playing and having fun with each other.<br>
<br>
       Please I ask you do not run out on us all. If we need to start from scratch then lets do it. You and I and everyone else. I respect you a great deal my friend.. and to be honest I would follow you. You are a leader. I beg to hear your ideas and not to run out like this. I promise you that I am here to support the ideas you have. Give ES and I one more chance. I give you no reason to trust, only my word that I will do my best. I await your response.<br>
<br>
With Highest Regards,<br>
Varden Darketernal</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--></b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
<br>
I was becoming more impressed with Varden by the minute.  My heart started feeling a bit heavy.  I did not want to hurt this man.  I went to “The Eye of the Storm” board and told the others of Varden’s email.  I asked them, “If Varden offers me leadership of the Eternal Stormcallers, does that change anything for any of you?  My loyalty is to you and not the House Darketernal. Whatever you want...I am with you.”<br>
<br>
Wiggam was the first to respond, “I think it changes alot! Think friends, someone is so sincerely worried and saddened about you guys leaving that they would do something of great measure to change that. You claim to lack leadership.... I say you now have it. You claim to lack organization,. I ask how hard did you all really work. You claim you want more open-ness and direction.... I say it's coming. And one more, YOU said YOU would join a beginning guild and help it grow.... I say &quot;and your thinking of leaving?&quot; In the end it doesn't matter what I say. I'll tell you though.... I still believe.”<br>
<br>
Arri followed with, “The decision is yours. I can not turn back. I stand firm with my decision. Kamdar you are obviously still not sure. SO dont persue starting a new guild. You need to really know what you want. Like I said I will not hold a decision to go back against you. I am tired of trying to reconsider, when I do not want to reconsider. My mind was made up a long time ago. The going back and forth is tiring. Please make a decision and stand firm.”<br>
<br>
She then took a softer tone, “I dont mean it to be harsh. I don’t want you to feel forced into a decision. That's why I said to make up your mind.  I really think you should stay with ES. I think that is where your heart is. You wouldn't be so torn otherwise.”<br>
<br>
Sure I was torn.  Here was a man that I thought might very well turn the leadership of the Stormcallers over to me, just to save the guild.  I had lost Burak to another guild (though he was still promising me his alternates) and now my other closest friend in Norrath, Wiggam, was probably going to stay with the Stormcallers.  And there were others…<br>
<br>
Ienoldar’s wife, Angeleena went next, “Kamdar, this does change things. Look guys that wasn't Xell that wrote that it was Varden and it looks to me like he's taken charge now. Maybe we all should slow down and give this guild another chance.  It changed my mind so long as this guy is on the up and up we will find out if it's bunk. How long can someone throw BS before being figured out?  If it is just bunk we know we can start anew later on.<br>
<br>
It was looking like Ienoldar would also stay with the Stormcallers and their friends were making their thoughts known.  Bygdogg had posted back on the Stormcallers board, “I am all for the changes that were proposed here. I believe a guild should be about helping each other and having fun. You have my and wife’s support.”<br>
 <br>
Things were starting to look dim. But Arri’s group remained unmoved.  Back in “The Eye the Storm” Arathain, referring to the Stormcallers said, “I'm out - but I think you and Wiggam should probably stay. If you get discouraged later, you can always join us then.”<br>
<br>
The decision for myself was made.  I wasn’t going back.  I had been through too much, and it was time to start anew.  But, I did feel I owed Varden something. He needed to know why I was doing this.  I sat down and wrote him a long letter detailing my frustrations.  I told him everything.  From Xell’s disappearing acts, his abuse of power, his treatment of others.  And most of all his lack of ever doing any actual guild work.  From raids to our Charter and Code of Conduct… he was involved with none of it.  Zero.  Zilch!  This was never his guild. It was mine.  And now it was time to give it up.<br>
<br>
Varden wrote back to me…<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> Noble Kamdar,<br>
<br>
           In light of this letter I must say I cannot blame you. You have been wronged a great deal as well as many others. Xellosx came to me.. wishing me to be in the guild several times and to leave my old Guild Valor of Virtopia. My Elder brother and his wife run that guild and to them I hold the highest love and respect.  However their’s was a large guild and I was not high on the priorities list .. and well I felt useless. So I saw this guild that little Xellosx and Ragna put together. I saw some things going on that disturbed me.. so rash decisions made.. and some slacking for the most part.. so I spoke to Xellosx about it.. and well he talked me into it <br>
since I had experience in leadership before (very long story).<br>
<br>
          I did not agree with his set up.. his politics, his methods or his actions. Knowing Xellosx for many years now I knew it was useless to try and tell him, otherwise a philosophical debate would have started. So I decided to lead by example. Xellosx seeing his errors simply said.. &quot;I am giving you official guild leadership.. is that ok?&quot; I said &quot;Yes for now”. He was a little taken aback about that but I told him to let it be and not to worry about it. The truth is I do not want to lead. Never really did. I just wanted to come in to the guild and be around some people that wanted to be around me, and that is what I got. Everyone paid attention to me. But then I started seeing all the things happening.. reading between the lines and such. So here I am.. a guild leader. (forgive me I am rambling on now)<br>
<br>
           I knew your qualities as a leader right away. The work you put into the web page alone was truly inspiring. I can only apologize for your treatment and I do really understand what you are doing. In all honesty it should be you in my place right now. You deserve it more than I that is for sure. But of course you must go your own way now.. and to be honest.. if I were not in the position I am in.. I would probably follow you as well. <br>
<br>
           Perhaps in time old wounds will heal. I will do my best to fix what went wrong, not let these mistakes occur again. I will keep your name on my friends list.. and I would consider it a great honor to fight alongside you. My best wishes and prayers go with you brother Kamdar.<br>
<br>
With Understanding and Highest Regards,<br>

<br>
I have to tell you, I had a lump in my throat.  That letter meant a great deal to me.  It also made me feel that I was doing the right thing.  I would move on with the rest if they would still have me.  For a time they had looked to me as a leader.  Now, I was starting to feel like one.<br>

A Fellowship is Born</h3><!--EZCODE HTML END--><br>
“I can't believe I just found out about this” Wyndlancer, a Druid of the 33rd season exclaimed.  “It's great to know that many more feel the same about ES that I have since I joined, there's no organization and really no activity. I look forward to starting new, and it's great to see many of the names that I would gladly fight to the death in a group with.&quot;<br>
<br>
Wyndlancer was a welcome sight indeed.  Our numbers had been dwindling and I was starting to worry that we may not have enough folks to start the Fellowship of Light as we were calling ourselves at the moment.  Varden had managed to stop many of our co-conspirators from defecting with his announcement of the new ideas he had for the Eternal Stormcallers.  Another one of our recruits, Tomani, had announced that he would be out of town for a month, and would probably be joining us upon his return.  At my last count, that would be six of us that would not be there for our formation.  <br>
<br>
Yet, what was becoming our core group, Arri’s followers would not be swayed.    Back in the forum of the Stormcaller’s, Arathain was the next of us to officially announce his intent to leave.  “I am joining Kamdar, Arrwen, and others in the task of starting a new guild. Good luck, everyone, I'll see you out in the field.”  <br>
<br>
As far as the Stormcaller leadership was concerned things must have started to look dim. Varden spoke up, “As the below posts say many are beginning to leave us. I must say it breaks my heart truly. If there is something I did wrong, or if there is something I did not do at all. I am sorry. If it is the changes I posted about, then I will retract them... give me suggestions on what you want.  I can understand why you who are leaving are doing so. But at the same time, I have heard you speak of friendship and devotion and family. I offer that here and if I have to retract all my suggestions so that we all can plan new ones then I will do just that. I must say also that I have become greatly discouraged but I am not one on giving up. We can do this thing if we want it. I would hear all you have to say and I will work hard with you to make this a great guild. I ask only for the chance to prove myself.” <br>
<br>
Again, I was feeling a little guilty and somewhat sorry for this new leader of the Eternal Stormcallers.  If only he had been there in the beginning, many of us would not have passed the point of no return.  <br>
<br>
He continued, “If I can do anything to change your mind, tell me and I will try with all my power to do it. I ask you please not to give up on us.  As leader I am your servant, what I do I do it for you.  Please, I beg you stay with us, help us, and together we will make this the best guild ever. Do not give up on us.”<br>
<br>
Arathain answered, “Don't take it personally. Some of us are just ready to move on. Your ideas sound good, and I think they will work well. I have a feeling that you will be a good leader, and ES will thrive under your direction. I truly hope so. At any rate, you will lose plenty of people over time, but hopefully you will gain more. Don't take it personally.  Good luck! I think you are headed in the right direction.”<br>
<br>
Then Arathain tried to lighten things up a little, “Maybe sometime our guilds could get together and declare war on the Legion of Little Folk or something.”<br>
<br>
Varden seemed to appreciate Arathain’s attempt. “Ha-ha!” he chuckled, “Legion of little folk! That sounds grand!”<br>
<br>
Although Varden’s mood seemed to lighten somewhat, I felt the need to speak up. “Varden, I believe you to be a noble and honorable Paladin and a good leader. Your ideas sound great and we may even try to incorporate them into our new home. Trust me. It is nothing you have done. And I don't believe there is anything you can do.  The time has just come for some of us to move on.  I hope there are no bad feelings, and I hope we get the chance to share another drink or two.  Perhaps we can even come together for guild events. Hopefully we will be formed by the end of the week.”  Then I attempted my own stab at levity, “So keep your eye out for....Stormcallers: The Special Edition!  Just kidding the real name is going to be...Stormcallers Part Deux!”<br>
<br>
Ienoldar made his position official, as he wished me farewell.  “It hurts to see a brother go.  I wanna thank you for all hard work you have done for us Kam.  Neither that or you shall be forgotten.  I wish you and your new crew all the best, and that your wishes may come true.  Farewell brother.”<br>
<br>
Then finally another Darketernal spoke up.  Surprisingly, in his own way, Xellosx kept it civilized.  “I saw this coming.  i am lead to believe this has been thought of for quite some time. But anyways ...good luck on whatever you guys do. Maybe we can at least form an alliance, and work together eh?  Let me know what you all think. But eh... heh,  I ask to please not use a guild name like ours.  There will only be one band of Stormcallers, and we're it baby.”<br>
<br>
Then Xell even tried to lighten things up in his own way. “Send in your coat sizes, I have some gifts for you, they are nice and red!  Just kidding!  Good luck friends, stay safe, and see you in the field.”<br>
<br>
Trying to keep it light, I came back with, “Is Stormcallers: The Next Generation, different enough?”<br>
<br>
Then referring to his lame “Red Coats” joke I said, “As for those red coats, would they be bloodstained tunics perhaps? You are too kind, sir!”<br>
<br>
He answered back, “No they are not bloodstained tunics!  Ever hear ‘the Redcoats are coming, the Redcoats are coming!?’ That’s what they are heh!” <br>
<br>
His little joke of the “Red Coats” didn’t really make much sense to me.  I knew what he was trying to say, but he had it a little backwards.  After all, the “Red Coats” were the British.  We were the ones claiming our independence!   In the interest of keeping the peace, I decided not to try to correct him on that one.  After all, I had seldom seen Xell so reasonable.  He also expressed his dislike for my latest name suggestion.<br>
<br>
As for what our real name would be, we were still narrowing it down back in the “Eye of the Storm”.  We had to come to an agreement fairly quickly.  We were supposed to meet that night in an EQ created chat room to submit our name and have it approved.  For the moment we had settled on the Fellowship of Light.  It was a combination of two of our current favorites, “Fellowship Exodus” and “Circle of Light”<br>
<br>
Herbdiva was quite fond of Fellowship Exodus.  After all, “Exodus” meant to go forth, and that was certainly what we were doing.  I however didn’t think that “Fellowship Exodus” fell trippingly off the tongue.  But I had to agree that we were indeed a Fellowship.<br>
<br>
But after having slept on it the night before I was really starting to like the word “Exodus”.  <br>
<br>
“I'm still not crazy about the word Fellowship before it” I said. “It just sounds funny to me. What about Mass Exodus?  Or just simply Exodus?”  It was determined that we would make our final decision in the EQ Chat room that night.  <br>
<br>
Fortunately other guild matters had not been so difficult for us to sort out.  We agreed that both Arri and myself would be considered co-leaders.  I would hold the actual title, but with all that Arri had brought to this, she deserved the position as well.  However, according to the folks that run Norrath, there can only be one official Guild Leader.  I guess since I had started this little party, the others were willing for me to be the first to be honored with the official position.  Actually with all of my previous doubts, I was surprised they still looked to me as a leader.  We also decided that all officers would have equal say in the decision making process.  Everything would be determined by a majority vote.  I relied on Arri’s recommendations to get several officers out of her group.  At the time we were going with Arathain, Cobo, Tanluin and Wamphyre.  I also said that I thought Wyndlancer would prove himself worthy.  <br>
<br>
Now it was time to meet in the Chat Room we had created to get our guild approved.  One by one we signed on, hoping that there would be the ten that we needed.  A couple of the troops were unable to make it, though Burak had showed with two of his alts.  And although Ienoldar had pledged himself to the Eternal Stormcallers, he was there as well to help us get our start.  I was most grateful.  <br>
<br>
We had the ten that we needed.  Between us, we decided to go with simply “Exodus” for our name.  Everyone gave their approval and I was whisked away to the guild creation area, where I had to fill out the forms!  I had no idea whether the others were still in the chat area or had been bumped out, but I was now on my own.  <br>
<br>
After I had filled out the form, I hit a little snag.  I was informed that “Exodus” was taken!  It must have been on some other server, because I had done a check on our home of Povar.  Now what was I going to do?  The others were gone and it was up to me come up with the name.  I remembered liking the word “Fellowship”, but hating the way it sounded before the word “Exodus” so I switched them around and submitted “Exodus Fellowship” I then logged off and would have to wait for an approval via e-mail.  I logged off and went to bed.<br>
<br>
The next morning, I checked my mail and to my surprise, we were approved!  The next thing we would need to do is gather ten of us in Norrath, and wait for a GM to come and make us official.  We were starting to get excited that we were seeing the light at the end of the tunnel.  Many of us wished we could do it that night, but thought we had better wait one more day to get as many people informed as possible.<br>
<br>
Now that they were officially committed others went to the Stormcallers’ forum.  They kept their messages short and sweet. <br>
<br>
“I am joining Kamdar as well. Thank you for everything. See you in the field!” Cobo said.  <br>
<br>
Niarki followed with “I am leaving to join Kamdar and others. I hope there are no hard feelings.”<br>
<br>
Apparently, Xell was experiencing some hard feelings as things started to get ugly.  “Ok I can see Kamdar leaving, Maybe a few others. But when I learn that (name withheld) is persuading as many Stormcallers as possible to join this new guild, I have to think to myself,  “How low can (name withheld) possibly go?”  This is the most underhanded, sneaky and downright dirty thing someone can do. To think I was going to form relations with this new guild.  I am far too disgusted to possibly do so.  The last thing I am going to say to (name withheld) is keep this up... and you shall have the rest of the ACTUAL Stormcallers a swords reach away from you.  Ugh, this makes me nauseous... pardon me while I lose my dinner out the window.”<br>
<br>
Well I had no idea who “name withheld” was, but it seemed the days of acting civilized were drawing to a close.  Xellosx had also sent me a rather abrupt ICQ message demanding that I turn over the administrator ship of the forum over to him.  In the past I had always avoided this.  I was afraid that he would cut through and edit the forum to his own liking, deleting posts at his every whim.  I was never anxious to give up one of my true powers I had in the Stormcallers, but now I supposed it would be inevitable.<br>
<br>
Trying to hang on to some mode of decorum, I said, “Xellosx, this whole thing was my idea, if you want to blame someone blame me. Everyone in this guild has free will and is able to make up their own minds. As far as I know, no one was begged, bothered or cajoled (much anyway) into joining us. Let me tell you, though that if this action was not taken many would have left anyway. This is a way to keep a lot of us together.”<br>
<br>
“Let me also tell you that because of your guilds recent announcements of changes many of your members have decided to stay with the Stormcallers. Several of these, are good friends, and I respect their decision.  I wish you would respect ours. I myself was quite torn and had to do much soul-searching. From your latest post though, I can see that I have made the right decision, and it feels as though a great weight has been lifted from my shoulders”.<br>
<br>
I then brought up the issue of the forum, “I got your email and ICQ message requesting turning over admin of this message board. I had already sent an email to Varden telling him that I will transfer administrator ship over to you guys as soon as I can. I think I will wait a few days though, so that everyone that wants to can have their say, without the messages being wiped.”<br>
<br>
Then I couldn’t resist, “As for your little joke about Red Coats, yeah, I got it the first time. I was just trying to turn the other cheek. If you ever want to grow as a leader, I suggest you do the same. Also I believe the Redcoats were the British soldiers that the Colonies were trying to break away from.”  So much for my not correcting him!<br>
<br>
“I harbor no malice torward you Xell, and I truly wish things had turned out differently. I don't know some of the other Darketernals well, but I have recently come to realize that Varden is a good and noble man, and I think he can lead you folks into a bright new future. It will just be without some of us.  I did not mean to hurt anyone's feelings during this and I hope we can all be civil with each other. It has just come time for some of us to move on...to go forth.”<br>
<br>
Arathain joined in, “No recruiting was necessary. Besides, a vast majority of the people leaving all know each other in real life and we made this decision before Kam even said anything, so it would have happened anyway. Good luck - don't foster any hard feelings, it's pointless. I would like our guilds to work together, because it would be much more fun.”<br>
<br>
Then Wamphyre spoke up, and for the first time let the Eternal Stormcallers know who we were about to become. “Hail Exodus Fellowship!  All that wish to leave the clutches of the Darkfraternal do so. We are all capable of making our own decisions so if your grudge lies with any specific it lies with the majority. So I suggest you watch your tongue sir.”<br>
<br>
Xellosx snapped back at the Iksar Shaman, “Watch your own tongue, for if you insult my family again you won't have a tongue to watch, got it?”<br>
<br>
Arri quickly followed with, “He wasn't insulting your family. Only you, Xell. It is thee who should watch thyne tongue.  All we wanted was peace, not your venomous replies and accusations.”<br>

“Oh give me a break,” Xell said. “Like having my last name twisted into Darkfratneral isn't insulting.  Maybe you need your eyes checked. And another thing I find to be interesting is how you and your little rebel clan seem to think I am harsh and even mean to members.  Haha, it's funny but you guys are even worse. posting all this junk on the board like this. Anyways I am done wasting time with you.  Don’t even bother to post a response I dont even want to read it.  Stay off this board.”<br>
<br>
Then changing his tone, Xell posted again, “There are no hard feelings at all.. my only problem is that i received word from several stormcallers that you and others tried to solicit them into joining you.. those who want to thats fine but dont try and convince others who are happy to stay as Stormcallers. And also, since you are leader of this new guild, do me the favor and keep the badmouthing members mouths quiet.. i dont want any problems to arise between any of us.  Again no hard feelings and good luck.”<br>
<br>
I responded, “Just as I have always encouraged for this message board, our members will always be free to speak their minds, though I prefer it to remain civil. And I am not trying to be mean about this but, I think you really need to work on your sense of humor. Try not to be so thin skinned. We should never take ourselves so seriously that we can't enjoy a laugh at our own expense.  The only soliciting I have ever done was to ask people if they were happy with the guild.  If they replied yes, I dropped the subject. No one's arms have been twisted. However I will go public here now and say, anyone who is not happy with The Eternal Stormcallers will always be welcomed by us.  No arm twisting, no bribes.”  Then jokingly I added, “But, I have shiny new weapons here for anyone that jumps ship!”  I admit I was getting a little feisty, but it had been a long time coming.  Underneath my words, I posted a picture of our new banner.  Having decided our name the night before, I had whipped it up rather quickly and was anxious for it to be seen.<br>
<br>
Needless to say, Xellosx was not pleased. “Revolting!  Just when I thought it couldn’t get any worse I see your rebel clan's banner on our site.  Gee, thats a nice touch, and how grown up of you to do so.” <br>
<br>
“No harm was meant, Xellosx” I said.  “You really need to relax. You are making this much more difficult than it needs to be. Flying off the handle is only causing you to look bad in front of your members. You, yourself run the risk of becoming our best recruiter.”<br>
<br>
In my own defense I added, “No malice was meant by me putting our banner up. Truthfully I thought you would have been relieved that we are not called Stormkillers, Son of the Stormcallers, or anything else with the word storm in it. We really wanted to leave without causing much trouble. Believe me if I wanted to I could have slapped our banner on the top of this Message board and have the Eternal Stormcaller website call up our new site instead of the Stormcallers. I have not done this, nor do I intend to.  I have told Varden that I will keep the website up for a month. He can email me articles for the news section if he wants and I will get them up as soon as I can. This should give you folks a little time to regroup and get a new page up. You are also welcome to any graphics, logos etc that you want to take from the current site.  Please Xell, for the sake of your guild, take a breath and calm down. It will all be over soon.”<br>
<br>
“Oh for Tunare’s sake!” Xell exclaimed.  “Your best recruiter? No I think not.  See the Stormcallers back me on this.  I am not the one who needs to take a breath and calm down. I have been calm throughout this.  I am just frankly upset by the way this is going.  Tired of the insults and the like.  I should post the harassing emails I have been receiving and see what results are given.  I agree on one thing,  it WILL be all over soon.  For the well being of the rest of us here at ES I hope.   Kam, you need to stop over reacting and trying to make things bigger then what they really are.  The only people who agree with you is your little rebel clan.  I have discussed this with many ES members and they are saying the same things I have.   Your efforts to shame me or us are not working.  Although I gather it is more so directed at me. Heh, even when you were ES, you have done the same thing, and it has worn on me rather thin.  I, along with the Stormcallers will continue to concentrate on us and not you or the little rebel clan.  So I ask that lets just leave it at this.  The last post about this incident... no more posts on it.. no more anything.. do your things, we will do ours...alright?  Sheesh... it's a good thing I set up a new message board.”<br>
<br>
Two minutes later he posted a follow-up.  “Ahem.  I do wish to say thank you for the allotted time given to keep the site up. It is appreciated.”<br>
<br>
I seriously doubted he was receiving any emails.  I had a feeling that he might be slipping a little more from reality.  I answered back as calmly as I could.  “I am disheartened to hear that you have been receiving harassing emails. I do not know where they are coming from, but I would urge this practice to stop.”  <br>
<br>
Having been watching all of this, Varden decided it was time to step back in.  “Well this is certainly come to arms length fighting. Despite what either party says you guys are baring your teeth and they are stained pink with blood of your previous victims.  I must say I have seen some bad things happen here. I have seen friends at each others throats.  No matter how delicate or innocent you make it sound, you guys are fighting it out.  There is obviously some bad blood here and it needs to be worked out.<br>
<br>
“Xellosx, I will not point out anything to you here where everyone can see but Kamdar speaks the truth. You would do well to take his council on many things, including how to be a leader. Kamdar, you are just and noble but you seem to still harbor some bad blood. Both parties are very quick to point out each other’s flaws, but very reluctant to point out their own.  As I see it both sides are right and wrong. I should not even have to explain, because deep down both parties should already know, but you are human so you deny it to yourself and see yourself as right only. <br>
<br>
Varden continued, “As far as true Stormcallers go.... I fear I am not one of them. I am Virtopian.  Even though my people turned their back on me many times,  that is what I am. It is there that I learned to be who I am.  Since coming here I have met friends, enjoyed playing the game, felt wanted, even needed. Those are perhaps the greatest feelings a person can ever have. But now, I see disunion, avarice, name calling, and revenge.  I even heard my family name,  the name I created to symbolise something be insulted. Well what is in a name anyway? Call me what you will.  But in the end, what will you have?  Maybe you would have won, but at what cost?<br>
<br>
“Who knows?  All I know is that I came only wanting to be a part of something special. Now I am made to fix something.  To pick up a mess.  And now I see friends fighting.  Perhaps I was lonely and ignored in Valor of Virtopia but never was I subjected to such a strife as this.  In all honesty and sincerity, take a look at yourselves and see what you have done. Forget about being right or wrong and take a good look.  Yes it is only a game, but we are still people.<br>
<br>
“Know now that he who was made your leader is now thinking of leaving the Stormcallers. I have seen very little good come from this and I believe both sides need to take a real close look at themselves.  I am reminded of one of my favorite quotes: ‘A friend is someone who knows everything about you and likes you anyway!’  Friends do not do the things I am seeing here. A friend is someone who makes you a better person.  Because of them you are better. Someone like that deserves every benefit of the doubt possible.  Who cares if you are right when it costs you a friend?   At any rate.. I chose no side in this matter. Both of you are no less wrong than the other.<br>
<br>
“Kamdar as I said you a truly a noble man, but you lack tact, perhaps Xellosx needs a better sense of humor but, to point that out will only create more hatred.  Also Xellosx may be flying off the handle about this, but I can not blame him. He is seeing something he created fall apart.  How would you feel about that? I might just feel the same way he does.”<br>
<br>
Varden’s words were stinging a bit.  Actually I was watching something I helped create fall apart too.   Things had managed to get out of control rather quickly in the forum, and I was starting to feel somewhat ashamed.<br>
<br>
Varden went on, “Xellosx, you need to listen well to people. From what I know Kamdar has literally beat down your door to move on things in this guild. You must take the role of leader. You also need to have more patience. I taught you long ago about controlling your emotions. Kamdar has done a great deal for this guild and in my honest opinion if you wanted help with running the guild, you should have looked to Kamdar and not me. I would follow Kamdar, think about that.”<br>
<br>
I responded, “Gulp! Well, I'm almost speechless. Thank you for your words Varden, both critical and complimentary. I will take them to heart. The only thing I can say is that I truly hope that we can someday put this bad blood behind us and come together as allies. They say time heals all wounds...  I hope it is not just a saying.”<br>
<br>
I also wrote a letter to both Xellosx and Varden apologizing for allowing things to get so out of hand.  I told them both that I had nothing to do with any harrassing emails and that I posted to my own people that no such activity was to be tolerated.  I expressed a hope that we could all come away from this without any more hurt feelings.  Xell and Varden seemed to both agree.<br>
<br>
Xellosx posted next…<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>     “After hearing that post.... I am uncertain as what to do.  My first instinct is to continue the fight for what I started so long ago. After also reading that my good friend, and brother for over five years is uncertain as to staying, it sways me.. almost to giving up. But, I will not do so.  Even if I am the ONLY ONE IN THE GUILD LEFT, I will not give up.  I will fight for my beliefs and for all those here at the Stormcallers now. So you know... the dispute that has been at our throats has ended.  We have come to a peacefull solution, and even to regaining our friendship.  Still, I know that a lot of people did not like the posts we have posted.. but I apologize for it..and I am sure the others do too. I am curious, who here will stand by my side and fight for the Stormcallers... fight for the Stormcallers to remain Eternal!<br>
<br>
Who here will do so? Anyone that will .. show your support and post your thoughts at this time.  I could certainly use to see that i am not alone...and that I have brothers and sisters out there in arms... and friendship, who will fight their hardest for us...and not give up.<br>
<br>
I am still pained by what took place... and I realize my share of the mistakes...and humbly ask that everyone forgive me, if it is in their hearts to do so...I only pray....that we survive to tell these stories and remember them,, never to forget...and build from them, learn from them... and grow stronger from them. I know I have. My friends, please stand by my side and fight....fight for a worthwhile cause...fight for the Stormcallers and all we represent...it is needed now more then ever.<br>

Grief Struck Soldier of the Eternal Stormcallers<br>
Friend to the Exodus Fellowship”</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
Several folks then answered Xell’s plea.  Pledging themselves to both him and the Eternal Stormcallers.  It appeared the damage control was finally starting to work for them.<br>
<br>
Back in our own “Eye of the Storm” forum Cobo also agreed that we should let things with the Stormcallers settle a bit.  “Look, I love a good war but now I think we have all stated our opinions and should let the heat die a bit, ignore him is my advice. Then we can kill them all in a surprise attack! Just kidding (sorta) Anyway, Kamdar is the man! I am impressed with Kamdar and Wamp! (He is so pissed!) Arri rocks too! Hope we have enough &quot;little rebels&quot; there tonight!”<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
A few hours later our big moment was fast approaching.  We were gathering in the tunnel in the East Commonlands, awaiting a Guild Master to grant us our guild status.  We were becoming somewhat anxious as there were not the required ten of us present.  Something had come up in the real lives of several of the others, and we were unsure if there would even be ten of us when the GM arrived.  Arri had gone out into the Northern Desert of Ro to see if she could round up one or two more.  <br>
<br>
She came back with a Dark-Elf Rogue named Danmann, and a Barbarian Warrior named Torakon.<br>
<br>
Burak’s alts Elaam and Nymwasob had shown up soon after.  Cobo, Niarki, Tanluin, Chonn, Herbdiva and Wyndlancer were also present.  <br>
<br>
To my utter surprise Wiggam had come running up through the tunnel and greeted us.  He said he had come to wish us well.  I had the feeling that he would have laid his axe next to our swords if we were low on recruits, but by my count we now had twelve.  And so Wiggam the Paladin Dwarf of the Eternal Stormcallers stayed to bear witness to the birth of a new guild.  <br>
<br>
Anticipation was mounting as we were waiting, but the butterflies that had been fluttering in my stomach were gone.  This was going to happen.  <br>
<br>
Soon a dark-haired man dressed in black entered our circle.  He introduced himself as Teliesin Lifebringer and asked who was to be our leader?  Several folks shouted out “Kam!” and with my heart filling with pride I walked up to Teliesin and bowed before him.  <br>
<br>
“I am to be the one,” I said, barely being able to contain the excitement in my voice.<br>
<br>
Teliesin waved his arms, and as if by magic the banner of the Exodus Fellowship appeared above my head.  Cheers rang up from the others and steins were raised in triumph.  Teliesin bid us good luck and farewell and I soon went to my first duty of inviting the others into the guild.  Arri, Cobo, Tanluin and Wyndlancer were promoted to officership.  I would have to catch up with Arathain and Wamphyre later.  <br>
<br>
It was a good time!  As the night wore on toasts were made and Ales were shared.  Sometime later after the effects of the alcohol had dissipated several of us decided that we should head to the Lavastorm Mountains, so that the ememies of Norrath could feel the wrath of our new Fellowship.  <br>
<br>
It had been quite a storm that we had weathered and we had not seen the last remnants of it.  But now a new day had dawned. We were both figuratively and literally moving forth and heading toward that light at the end of the tunnel. As we slowly emerged from the cave, we could see that the dark clouds had parted and the Norrath sun shown brightly on our shoulders.<br>
<br>
It felt damn good.<br>
