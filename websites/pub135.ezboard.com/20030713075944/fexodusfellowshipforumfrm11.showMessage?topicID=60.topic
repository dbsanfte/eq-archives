Maybe I won't delete it this time.....<br>
<br>
Basically, it was on recent events here in the US and abroad.<br>
I logged off EQ only to see reports of ANTI-French slogans and graffiti on the news.  Not exactly what I'm itching to see.<br>
<br>
I just thought I'd share a couple things with you guys and maybe put my mind at ease. I know we have some people from EF that are in the US military and for that I say thankyou.  I support you guys where ever your are or may be going.  I dont' want to get into an arguement about whether our leaders are doing the right thing. I just wanted to bring attention to our own attitudes.  <br>
<br>
Some but not many of you know that I was actually married in France a couple years ago.   My (was to be wife) and I were both Americans (both in college) and thought this would be a wonderful way to start off our lives together.  It is a beautiful country with very nice people, but has a reputation of rudeness.  I have to say New York city doesn't have a reputation for helpful people either. I just think you will find all sorts of people where ever you go.    I'm saying all this just in hopes of asking you guys to see that we are in need of more than our own safety and well being.   We need the support of these other nations.  They are not our enemies.<br>
<br>
    The first time I was over to Europe I was actually travelling through Hungary and that region.   It was when we were sending bombing raids down to Yugoslavia.  I remember staying with a hungarian couple eating dinner and you could hear the NATO planes flying over head from the base in Germany to their targets about 150 miles to the south of where I was.  There were &quot; 'Nazi sign' = Nato&quot; graffittied on billboards.  I remember getting really nervous walking past a crowd of protesters. <br>
        Shortly there after when bush was elected and we backed out of the green house gas emissions treaty.  This brought more anti american political feelings through out the world.   I remember reading &quot;F_ _ _  Bush&quot; and other such slogans on bathroom walls in Ireland.  <br>
      I like to think of myself as someone who values other cultures and other perspectives.  I enjoy talking to people about ideas, and especially foreigners and their first impressions of the US.<br>
This is an amazing country we live it. Built buy all nationalities.<br>
I just  hope to soften any any anti-world ideas that some of you might have.   Wasn't sure what else to say...Please don't encourage vindictave and hateful acts against other nationalities.   always a pleasure <br>
cheers,<br>

This is what happened 3-18-2003 at around 5PM PST(rush hour traffic). About 60 protesters came down the main street of downtown called Broadway. 10 people dressed in white sheets covered with fake blood lay down in the middle of traffic and start screaming. With containers they start tossing fake blood everywhere in the streets. One young man with the protesters started splattering fake blood on the NBC windows. He got me with his backlash of fake blood. The Director of Security and me, got him, couldn't find a cop at the time to press charges, and let him go, told him to leave and don't throw the fake blood anymore. Ok minutes have past by, people still dying there fake deaths in the streets. Then I guess the living family members come in, with fake plastic babies in their arms and carry out their DEAD. The DUMBSHIT does the toss the fake blood against the windows again. 3 cops are on him in no time flat. He gets arrested and a NBC producer files charges. This protesting group heads to the Horton mall and finally they go home.<br>
<br>
I have nothing against protesting peacefully but when you HIT me with fake blood(I'm talking ruining a $200 blazer and white shirt) and start messing with property, you're going a little to far. I believe in freedom of speech, but there's a point when you cross the line.<br>
<br>
Its gonna get worse tomorrow, from what the police say. Federal building will be HIT first then maybe the NBC building. I LOVE America but some people in it take things way too far.<br>
<br>
Just thought I would share my day with you.<br>
<br>
Do I want WAR, no. I have friends in the military and will support them 110%. They don't want to go either, they don't have a choice though. They go when their commander and chief tells them too.<br>
<br>
I'm sure KAM or others have some stories to tell from their cities they live in.<br>

<br>
There are some folks in Portland that have the plan of, when the first bombs drop, shutting down the city by completely clogging the streets and deliberately blocking traffic. When the &quot;leader&quot; of this movement was asked &quot;What about when someone needs and ambulance, fire truck, or police officer, and it doesn't make it through because you have the streets shut down full of people?&quot; Her response was &quot;Oh, that won't happen.&quot;<br>
<br>
I work in a building that has a fire station 4 blocks away, and is next to the bus mall (the ambulances often use the bus only street to avoid traffic). I can tell you that one or both of the two of those is moving through by my building once every 1 to 2 hours. While the protesters say &quot;obviously we would move if an ambulance came&quot;, they clearly are ignoring the fact that they will likely have blocks worth of cars parked in the street, and that those simply <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>can't</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> move out of the way for the ambulance quickly. They are also ignoring the fact that they will be losely doubling the number of people downtown (thus roughly doubling the potential need), and creating a high stress situation (increasing the likelihood of certain afflictions such as heart attack and asthma).<br>
<br>
I'm a huge believer is people's rights to largely say and do most anything - provided that the things said and done do not infringe on other people's basic rights and/or saftey. I know some folks are thinking that the protester organizers for this one should be arrested immediately (and preemptively) on racketeering charges (by my translation of racketeering law, this actually would be a plausible arrest). I think that's a little extreme, but I also think that, were they to begin actually doing this, I would be all of that, and that the punishments should be harse. Frankly, if they do something like that, and someone does indeed die because of it (not &quot;likely&quot;, but definitely a possibility), I would be completely supportive of charging all the organizers with manslaughter for deliberately and knowlingly performing acts which they knew could lead to the severe injury or death of others. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#00000F><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub135.ezboard.com/bexodusfellowshipforum.showUserPublicProfile?gid=arathainkelvar>ArathainKelvar</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Guild Leader</span><br>  Posts: 1025<br> <font color=#A8A8A8>(3/19/03 1:27 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub135.ezboard.com/fexodusfellowshipforumfrm11.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=60.topic&index=4>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.exodusfellowship.com/Arathain_small.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_thumbsdown.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: in San Diego today</span><hr size=1> Quote of the day, made by a columnist in D.C.:<br>

At 5PM PST the protestors started gathering again at the Federal Building downtown. At first their was only 20 SD police that I could see. At around 6PM PST their were like 250 protestors at the Federal Building. Banging their drums and holding their signs. At around 6PM PST they all took off, heading east down Broadway. The protestors got to 5th and Broadway they all sat down in the street blocking traffic. After fives minutes they got up and went down 5th street towards the bay area. Well after a hour or so around 715PM PST. The president told the nation it started, the WAR. At 730PM PST I was called over to 101 West Broadway(SBC Building) because the protestors were back. WOW, talk about back. There were alot but I think all the 100 police officers in roit gear made them be GOOD little boys and girls. It looks like San Diego Police force is not gonna kid around anymore. I have never seen 100 police in full roit gear, it was a sight to see, and I job I don't envy doing. The last 20 officers, carrying rubber bullet guns, gas lauchners and full mask, body armor, WOW I thought the war was in our own streets.<br>
<br>
GREAT to see San Diego Police do a wonderful job keeping people in check. Its gonna get worse before it gets better though. It was very NICE to see the professional way they took control of the situation. Tomorrow is another day however.<br>
<br>
I HOPE everyone is SAFE and SOUND in their own homes. SORRY to here about all the troubles in Colorado with the snow ins.<br>
<br>
TAKE CARE all<br>

<br>
now saddam has already killed hundreds of thousands of people most from his own country i might add has invaded nother country and once again we stepped in the diffrence this time he was still alive and once again prepairing to do it again his elite guard he brings all together and kills couple of them just to keep them in line is has connections with terriorist of all kinds and was basicaly in on 9  11 is this someone you want to be in power when his own people begged us to get rid of him last time we were there i think now it is time for a change and we started it <br>
<br>
repercusions is what happens when another higher powered country doesnt like the ruler of diffrent country and desides they want to oust them eh. oh almost forgot when this is over we still aint done korea is nuking up we have a base already there and that tension is getting high. what are they thinking since we also told them to disarm are they gonna prepair even harder while we take care of saddam are they really willing to use the 3 confermed nukes they have this is a very interesting time in the world and cant say its either good nor bad i just hope everything works out for the best and america shines on <br>

   Leaving the professional politics aside.  I just want to comment on what &quot;free speech&quot; really means.  <br>
   Most people believe that it means   &quot; HEY!!  I can say &quot;A-N-Y-T-H-I-N-G&quot; that I want to and nobody can do anything about it!! &quot;<br>
    This is a tenet of our Bill of Rights, one of the rights almost every one of us prizes about all else.<br>
    In real life however,we must add the line  &quot; and based on what you say, the others with &quot;free speech&quot; can and WILL judge you and act accordingly.&quot; <br>
<br>
  Based on this, lets look at current French relations.<br>
I think most folks could agree that, stereotypically at least, Americans think that the French are a rude and obnoxious, smelly people...  And the French think of Americans as arrogant and self centered.<br>
   Once Jaques Chirac openly opposed the U.S.A. before the United Nations and promised a Veto of ANY resolution which the U.S.A. would or could put forth, the American public (at least the more outspoken parts) decided that since Jaques wouldn't give the US a chance, we would respond in kind.<br>
  With this stereotype already in place, it is easy to see why much of the American populous (again, at least the more outspoken parts)  are banning/boycotting  French economic products and in general are flaming the French.<br>
  Jaques spoke his part and despite his freedom of choices and opinions, he was judged harshly.<br>
<br>
     Popular country musicians, the &quot;Dixie Chicks&quot; lead singer, Natalie Maines, utilized her right to free speech and told her audience that she was &quot;Ashamed that George Bush was from Texas&quot;.   While she had the RIGHT to say that without US Government persecution, The Dixie Chicks CD's are not currently getting any airtime on MANY of the nations radio stations and in one case, a Houston, Texas radio station is collection thier CD's in a Dumpster and will be mailing the CD's back to the group when they return home from thier European tour.<br>
<br>
Sorry for the rant, but I've heard an awful lot of people  (mostly demonstrators, and from both sides) whining about how they have &quot; Free Speech&quot; ..  In reality they do have rights to Speak freely, but I wish that they would also remember that so does everyone else..  And if you're an idiot and open your mouth to say the wrong thing at the wrong time, rest assured, people for better or worse will judge you and you will pay the social consequences even if you're within your rights.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
All that being said...<br>
 Iraq     <br>
       IMHO, I believe that the current war in Iraq was and is the only way to remove Hussein from power.  It needed doing, he was/ is a mass murderer. <br>
   Some tout the &quot;Cost of War&quot; and protest about all the &quot;lives that will be lost, both in our troops and Iraqi civilians&quot;.  I agree, the cost will be grave.  But what about the &quot;Cost of Peace&quot;?  Would we stand by for over 12 years and let Hussein kill his own people, and let thousands of Iraqi's die so that we Americans can stay at home?<br>
  Yeah, if we hadn't got involved, our soldiers wouldn't be in harms way..  We could wait Sadaam out, eventually, he would be selling chemicals or biologicals to the highest bidder, and our civilians would pay the price.   Either way, folks die, war isn't pretty.<br>
 I do not, however, agree with the political steps taken to begin this War.  Now that it is upon us, I do support it, reguardless of how we arrived here.<br>
      I do not believe that Al-Quaeda and Sadaam are linked.  At least not beyond financial ties and possibly the purchase of weaponry.   Al-Quaeda is not Sunni Muslim, yet they are primarliy Muslim.  Saddam came from a primarily Sunni upbringing but has declared himself to be Athiest and the mass killing of the Kurdish sect of muslims in the Northern reaches of his country was done with Sarin and VX gases. ( Both are chemical weapons of mass destruction.)<br>
<br>
As for Other topics, <br>
<br>
       Protesters for or against this war...  If you feel strongly either way, show it..  If that means sit in's or peaceful protests, then go for it.  Do not however, endanger other Americans by your short sighted actions.<br>
    What does blocking a street gain you?  Some lil old lady who supports your cause, may have a heart attack..  If you block the street and ambulances cant get to her..  You are responsible for manslaughter.<br>
      Break the law, you go to jail..  Throw a bottle at a cop?  Set something on fire?  Destroy property? ..  I hope you get to spend alot of time behind bars...  that is uncalled for.<br>
<br>
     The French..  IMHO, the French people, more or less, aren't any better or worse than we are.  The French government, most noteably, Jaques Chirac, has made some very poor political choices.  If you don't like them, let him know it.  But why slam the French public?  What does it gain you when it's thier leaders who are the idiots? <br>
<br>
  The Dixie Chicks..  Hmm .. Natalie Maines and company make good music, but thier lead singer lacks tact...  I wonder, in dollars and future sales, just how many THOUSANDS of dollars that one comment has cost thier group..  I hope they think it was worth every penny.<br>
<br>
    I like my Steak medium rare, my Miller lite cold and in a bottle, Everquest anytime of day or night, and prefer briefs to boxers...  <br>
<br>
 Thats about my opinion on everything, I'll shut up now..  If you liked it, great, if not, I hope you got a good laugh.. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

It gives me an enormous headache when the populous makes up their mind and voices their opinion with little to no education fueling the decision.  The fact is, any schmuck can get on television or write an article and post it online without knowing anything.  My jaw dropped when I found out that a large portion of the US believes that Sadaam was directly responsible for 9/11.  And, what's worse, it seems that the less the education on a subject, the more outspoken a person is.  <br>
<br>
France is still the #1 tourist destination for the US.  Point is, we like France, despite all the stereotypes.  Unfortunately, France appears to have an importance complex, and seem to be attempting to trying to prove themselves a key player.  I believe it backfired.  <br>
<br>
As much as we value our freedom of speech, I find it humorous when we turn visciously on those who express theirs.  But that is the way it works, I suppose.  <br>
<br>
Hearing on the radio that French's Mustard (British Company) was possibly facing boycott sent me straight for the aspirin.  I mean, come on, do your research before you start a boycott, please.  <br>
<br>
And don't believe everything you hear, no matter where it came from (remember, the news is typically left-wing and very biased).  You know the saying, &quot;the good guys always win&quot;?  Remember who writes the history books.  The losers, good or bad, aren't typically around to publish history.<br>
<br>
FYI, I believe we could have done much better foreign relations wise, but I think that had I been in charge, we would still be at war.  It seems to me a necessary evil.  I feel that we will only know the right decision in time.<br>

After 6 years in the military (including 13 months in Vietnam), I returned home only to be called baby-killer, etc. At least the troops coming home now will be better recieved.<br>
<br>
I was in a band that did a lot of protest rallies after I was discharged. I felt that that was a stupid war and, since I felt I had earned the right, I did a lot to to protest our involvement.<br>
<br>
The current situation is not even close to the same as Vietnam. Saddam, IMHO, is a waste of oxogen and a threat to anyone who doesn't agree with him.<br>
<br>
I've always been an advocate of turning the other cheek but I only have 2. Slap them both and we have a problem.<br>
<br>
Push comes to shove, if it's a choice between you and me, I choose me. It's the same with nations. <br>
<br>
I wish all our troops well and hope as many as possible return home safe and sound.<br>

I just wish the powers that be could just put on some 16 oz. gloves and settle it in the ring. <br>

Just want to add my 2 cents worth now.<br>
<br>
I believe in this Country I live in and love being an American. I can't see how anyone could live in the ways they do in other countries. It just blows me away, and makes me very proud to know that we as Americans do not.<br>
<br>
I strongly believe in our Military, and what they do, sacrifice, and die for. They are the real heroes here. They make it happen for all of us to get up in the morning, head out to work everyday. Anyone in the military I hold in the deepest respect for.<br>
<br>
As far as everyone protesting, war, the French, is in my mind a cowards way out. How sad to see our men and woman fighting for OUR country and see these cowards holding up signs saying &quot; give peace a chance&quot;. OMG do they know just how horrible they look? What kind of message are we sending? Yes freedom of speech, but for the love of your country STOP and grow up. Volunteer someplace, put yourself to better use.  As for French Fries and French's Mustard, they will always be that to me, I am way to old to start calling them anything else. Yes, I was upset that France did not help us out,but hey WE did it!!! They had their reasons for not, it was not all French people that said no, it was their rulers. And someday if they need the US you all know WE will be there for them. Right or wrong!<br>
<br>
People who are doing this are just plain COWARDS!<br>
<br>
Last word from me is:  I am PROUD to be an AMERICAN!<br>

It's always a mistake when history if forgotten, because then we doom ourselves to repeat it.  'Kaiser Bill' and Hitler are so easily forgotten by the French?  I know that America, as a nation, was chastised for showing up late to these fights for right.  &quot;Why didn't you come and help when we asked after Hitler took Poland?&quot;, they said.  &quot;Couldn't America have done anything to save the jewish being killed?&quot;, they said.  Saddam taking Kuwait and persecuting a religious group within his own country is a different matter, I suppose.  Damned if we do and damned if we don't, eh?<br>

First off, hat's off to Gil. Nam was the first war where our troops fought for our country and our country didn't support them...not just the populace, but the government itself denied so many benefits.  We sent young boys over, eager to fight for freedom and brought back burnt-out men, old before their time from seeing things they should never have seen.<br>
<br>
Second.  Thallus, I agree with your post.  We are a nation of other nationalities.  I think that says it all.  My father was in on the liberation of Paris during WWII, from what he described then about their attitude that day and compare it to what we read about today, I'd say they haven't changed, why are we getting so upset?<br>
<br>
I can only hope that our protests and demonstrations don't get out of hand as they did in the sixties.  It was hard coming home from work and turning on the TV to see people getting off the bus in Chicago only to be beat on by police in the heat of the moment or to see four young college students shot and killed for speaking up with over-enthusiasm.  And equally hard watching the war from our arm-chairs.<br>
<br>
The Constitution gives us freedom as a right, it's our responsibility to use it wisely.<br>
