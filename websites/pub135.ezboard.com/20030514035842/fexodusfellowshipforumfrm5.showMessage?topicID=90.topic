What am I talking about? Well, I'm talking &quot;Dragonscale Friday&quot; - a date in which I will be killing not one, but two dragons in the same day (now, how many peeps can say that, eh?).<br>
<br>
Assuming that they are both up (odds not bad on a Friday on Povar), we will begin the day by taking out Vox, and will then run through ports over to Lava, and immediately begin taking down Naggy.<br>
<br>
A full FAQ wll be published on this in the next couple of days with specific looting information, etc.. For now:<br>
<br>
LEVELS: 45-52 on main attack force<br>
           53+ for support (looking for 1 well balanced support group. I intend to work them hard, so they WILL be in the looting.)<br>
HOW MANY: No less than 24 in assault groups, and no more than 30. If we have too many, we will &quot;cut&quot; some as RL's sole discretion, but largely based on class needs, resist grear, level, PoP enablement (if we start cutting folks, and there's only one or two that can't use the Raid feature, thatwill be a factor - the raid window is just too useful to be ignored. That said, I'm expecting there to be enough that *don't* have PoP, that this should be a non issue) and &quot;need&quot; for specific loot on the raid. If the &quot;cut&quot; people choose, they can hang as alternates for a time. I'm going to pick no bones about it - if you have a problem listening, I'm going to boot your tail from the raid. We have a lot to do for one event, so in the interest of everyone else's time, you create any problems, and you're gone. Sorry, but it's simple as that. <br>
LOOT: yes, Sing is calling one scale from each mob. He's the RL, and is also fronting the cash for virtually everything, and will be &quot;at risk&quot; should the raid somehow fail or otherwise need to abort. Estimates on this little venture is about 500-1000 plat in cost to me even if we fail. They may not drop any scales, on the other hand, they may drop more than one. All other items are OPEN and Sing will be tossing in a few &quot;extra&quot; items to make up for the scales someone. Non-scale other than nodrop loot will be rolled on at the end of the EVENT (leave early, forfeit roll - I don't find it fair to those that stick it out to have the early 'lucky' folks bail on them - if you can't stay, then don't come, sorry). Sing will not be rolling on ANY loot unless neither dragon drops a scale, in which case he will take a roll along with everyone else.<br>
HOW LONG: Plan it much line a planes raid - 5-6 hours total. Likely slightly less if folks are on time and listen, perhaps slightly more if people don't. I intend to focus heavily on our main targets, so the 53+ support group will be doing some of the clearing to keep things moving.<br>
WHAT SHOULD I BRING: Sing will be supplying most everything for the raid, but he doesn't recommend that you have one coffin on hand &quot;just in case&quot;. At the moment, I would suggest that it be a &quot;Jade Inlaid Coffin&quot; (the expensive kind) for safety, but I will be trying to get a 58+ Necro in the support group, in which case a &quot;tiny inlaid coffin&quot; should suffice. Sing will NOT be supplying coffins this time around. In general, they should not be necessary if you listen to directions. Note that it's unlikely that anyone who LISTENS will actually need a coffin, but those that fall down the pits at the wrong time..... <br>
WHAT ELSE SHOULD I KNOW: <br>
Be on time please. When we have enough to go, we go. If you're not there tough. Unless there is only 1 or 2 class specific needs we have, I do not intend to do any pickup recruiting that day. If we get more than 15 minutes past start without enough peeps accounted for to make the raid, raid is cancelled. We're going to maket his as painless as possible folks.<br>
Please Listen!!!<br>
At Raid time, I will be having a reminder run through of the raid plan and looting plans. Please pay attention and don't pester me afterward with &quot;when are we going? How is loot done? Are we roling yet?&quot;. If it sound terse, it's because I've RL'd before. lol. Rest assured that we will roll at the time specified earlier in this document.<br>
Having I mentioned &quot;PLEASE LISTEN!!!&quot; yet?<br>
One more thing: If you have a wealth of Naggy or Vox experience that you want to share - that's simply great! Please do so before hand by sending me a tell in game or droping me an email (singsang @ mail.com). At raid time, there is one and only one raid leader please. If you see a critical mistake I'm making, use your judgement on whether to tell me about it, but realize that there will likely be 5-10 other folks around that have done Vox or Naggy before, and they too will be telling me they have all the answers. I appreciate the help - I really do - but I can't run a raid with 10 people sending me tells telling me what I'm doing wrong or what I should be saying/doing. Understand?<br>

This is an open Event, please tell all the 45+ toons you know about it. Also, please feel free to post links to this ezboard thread in other forums. Getting enough 45-52's in one place at one time is a real challenge, so I need to get the word out. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub135.ezboard.com/bexodusfellowshipforum.showUserPublicProfile?gid=singsang>SingSang</A> at: 11/29/02 3:15:04 am<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000028><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub135.ezboard.com/bexodusfellowshipforum.showUserPublicProfile?gid=chanalusneiton>Chanalus Neiton</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 8<br> <font color=#A8A8A8>(11/18/02 8:03:19 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub135.ezboard.com/fexodusfellowshipforumfrm5.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=90.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Dragonscale Friday - November 29th Noon Eastern</span><hr size=1> Ill try to make it. <br>

<br>
So buy some cheap resist gear (you should only be taking the AE, not melee) and get in the fight - geez. A DRT has +8 on all saves for example, only runs about 20pp - I may even have an extra lying around. See it all off after you've done the battle that lets you say you've done two dragons in one day.<br>
<br>

That's it as a &quot;just in case&quot;. I'd like a 58+ necro because it sharply reduces costs. Certainly not a requirement though since we'll have some SK's around.<br>
<br>
When I last did Vox, the people in the pits where a huge time waster. I would have left them there until after Vox was dead, but we were short handed enough that we needed everyone. Having a necro would have made life relatively easy - the raid would have been just fine. Live and learn.<br>
<br>
If we don't get a 58+ Necro (hard find), then that's a slot I don't care who fills. I certainly wouldn't mind seeing a couple of 52- necros for their special talents during the raid.<br>
