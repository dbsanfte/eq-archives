Some of them are pretty funny.<br>
<br>
For example, I got a tell from an irate mule because a member of Exodus (don't remember who) put their bazaar trader in front of her while she was trading.  This was right near the SH side bank (where everyone's crowded in).  She was blaming this person for 9 hours of afk trading resulting in no sales.  She even wanted compensation from the guild.  I had a lot of fun with that one.<br>
<br>
Another time, and I won't mention her name unless she says it's ok, but I got a complaint that an EF toon KS the grimling runner.  This guy was freaking out.  He said, &quot;She's been sitting there asking me if I wanted it but pretending she doesn't hear my response.  Finally she just killed it and looted it.&quot;  Well, knowing the EF toon in question, I was a little skeptical.  I was talking to her and she seemed horrified at the thought of KSing him.  &quot;I asked him several times if he wanted it and he didn't reply!&quot;  I asked them to talk to each other and work it out.  I get a tell later from this guy saying that she sent him a tell but she won't respond to any of his tells, that she's pretending to be afk or something.  Meanwhile, the EFer tells me that he won't respond to any of her tells.  I almost busted a gut laughing when I realized she had this guy on /ignore.  They later worked it out, not sure the details on that, but he had very nice things to say about her when it was all over.<br>

After buffing and medding up the warrior pulls one mob.  Once the mob was at 80% cham tries to slow the mob...gets aggro....dies.  The cleric did not even attempt to heal...no big deal (shrug it off).  The warrior and I continue to melee the mob down.  The warrior gets to 20% hp and asks &quot;CH?&quot;<br>
<br>
no reponse from the cleric, the warrior gets to 10% and asks &quot;ARE YOU GOING TO HEAL ME?!?!&quot;<br>
<br>
The warrior dies and i end up killing the mob...not a single heal thrown out the entire time.<br>
<br>
After the mob died and we had two group members down we ask the cleric what his problem is and why he didn't heal.<br>
<br>
He says,&quot; WTF, don't call me noob, its not my fault the WARRIOR can't take hits!&quot;<br>
blah blah blah he says &quot; whatever i'm leaving, get your own f'ing rezes.&quot;<br>
<br>
cleric leaves the group, cleric gates...<br>
<br>
well that was fun, just thought i'd share my experiance with the servers best....<br>

I turned the pouch into the Rallic Pack Pattern which isn't NODROP and gave it to him in the end and he was happy. Of course, we didn't get into WHY he ended up on my ignore list....<br>
<br>
Learned my lesson about the ignore list though, hehe. Now I'll clear it every once in a while. Today's annoying OOC'er may be the guy you are trying to converse with tomorrow...<br>

Well, down at the bottom anyway.  I was fighting with my pal Burak and he had to log off.  Before he did, he told me how to get out of there.  &quot;Just follow that tunnel up to the top&quot;<br>
<br>
So I start soloing and get in a little deep...  I start heading up the tunnel.  Not realizing I'll run into some beasties on the way.  <br>
<br>
After I pulled a little mini train to the zone line I got a very unfriendly tell from a guy that didn't appreciate my exit.  I apologized, but he demanded to talk to my guild leader.<br>
<br>
I was the guild leader at the time.<br>

Toon &quot;disgruntled&quot; sends me a tell.  she asks if I am an officer.  I say technically no, but my main is.  Demands I log in main.  I do.  Meanwhile I already got a tell from a certain monk alt that was in the guild.  I know the person that is the main and am already behind them 100%.  Get Big ash on she verifies that I am an officer and starts griping that a monk in DSP trained her lvl whatever druid that she was PLing...ps disgruntled is a lvl 65 wizzie from a &quot;ubah&quot; guild.  I get them both in a channel to discuss it.  Monk says simply that he just pulled a train inside the hopper caves, Fd due to the pull and then noticed there was a crowd inside the cave.  The hoppers jumped on the &quot;ubah's&quot; and thier lil druid that they wanted to PL died.  In the meantime the EF monk even jumped up and tried to help.  Didn't work.  So this ubah wizzy who I will call disgruntled starts to /ooc rude stuff.  So the monk does back.  Then the wizzie starts to pull everything in the cave and kill it so monk can't get one mob.  Long story short I backed the guildie, even when disgruntled 'threatened&quot; that her guild would now blacklist EF meaning no buffs, rezzes etc.  Was quite funny.  She even demanded that I immediately disband the monk of suffer the consequences.  Needless to say I didn't disband anyone and have had a few rezzes from her guild.
