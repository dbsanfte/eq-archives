Rather than play today, I decided to put a little something up in the News section.  The last time I went way off topic in the NEWS was Sept 11th.  I guess there are some things that are just impossible to ignore.  <br>
<br>
Now, unfortunately we will have another &quot;Where were you when&quot; moment to add to our collective consciousness.<br>
<br>
For me, I logged on EQ to get a port down to GF so I could be ready for the Plane raid later today.  Arathain popped on and said in Guild speak &quot;Have you seen what's on the TV?&quot;  Without even saying hello, I logged off and headed upstairs with a feeling of dread as I turned on the tube.  My first thoughts were &quot;Did we go to war?  Another terrorist attack?&quot;  But as soon as the TV came on, I was reminded of another horrible day 17 years ago.<br>
<br>
I guess we can never take space travel for granted.  Just when it starts to seem run of the mill we are once again reminded how dangerous and costly it can be. <br>

But I have high hopes: This is the *only* manned vehicle lost on re-entry in nearly 30 years. The ISS is currently manned, and this means that there will be a positive impetus to develop a way around the problems caused by the breakup of Columbia. (No, they're not stranded, in case you're wondering - but frankly I'd rather suffocate on my own CO2 if it was a choice of that or a ride in a decades-old Soyuz capsue, heh). <br>
<br>
In it's history, NASA has proven time and time again that they have had a better safety record than any airline, and probably a better launch and recovery record than even Vandenberg, where the classified launches happen.<br>
<br>
I am sure that we will hear much about the 7 scientists that met their valiant end in a superheated scorch across the atmosphere but there will be that much more of a dogged determination to finish the next generation of spaceflight &quot;cargo trucks&quot; and move beyond this tragedy.<br>
<br>
Columbia is gone, long live Columbia.<br>

Also the years on some of these shuttles are like what 20 years OLD. That's alot of stress on the frame from take off to rentry. We do need space flight to find NEW advances in techology and medicine. We also need some NEW and updated shuttles too. Where the money would come from this of course is us the taxpayer, but I rather pay the taxes then have people's DEATHS, because of OLD equipment. Some way they would have to find a way get the 3 astronauts off of the International Space Station. If not our own space shuttles, maybe from Russian supply missions.<br>
<br>
Those 3 people in space are probably feeling very lonely right now. Thinking about I just want to be done with my time now and get off this station. The question for them right now is How? It took 3 years after the Challenger to begin NEW shuttles flights.<br>
<br>
Atlantis is ready, not too OLD of a shuttle( newest one is Endeavor, I think ), check it over throughly, plan ahead more for safety reasons(have the arm and camera extension to check if the shuttle does have damage from blast off or rentry. They didn't have it on the Columbia. Something to fix ceramic tiles or extras aboard with the right glue for space.), extra fuel, the right airlock for the International Space Station. Alot happened with the Columbia, that should change again the way we go into space.<br>
<br>
Having the ability to repair damage or connect to the space station could have saved those people. Also having the fuel to do it with. Like I said this will change for the better the ways we go into space. Things should be planned if there happens to be a problem in space. Extra parts on the shuttle or the space station. I mean if you look how much airplanes and cars break down, the space shuttle program has done real well. We just have to have the ability if needed to HELP the shuttle get back down from space if damaged. Be it on the space station or the shuttle itself.<br>

<br>
I read an article on Sunday saying something to the effect of &quot;If the damage did occur on launch, then they were doomed from the beginning because they had no way to get home.&quot; That's a bunch of hoey at this point in space development.  I believe that NASA very much has kept an eye on safety (something they didn't really have before Challenger), but I really have to wonder why a space walk wasn't planned to go out and take a look at the damage. I can think of perhaps 5 or more different options to get them the heck off that shuttle if it wasn't going to be repairable up there. <br>
<br>
All that said, I think this need to be disected in every way, but I also thing that it's important that we remember that this is dangerous business, and once we're certain that the mechanisms are in place to make things are safe as they reasonably can be, we need to get them back into action and moving again.<br>
<br>
BTW: My understanding of things is that the issue wasn't one with stress. The tiles stripped away from the fuel cell (they are redone every launch), and struck the shuttle wing. The believe is that they damaged a bunch of the heat tiles on the shuttle itself. After that, it was a matter of time in reentry before the heat stressed/melted things and changed the aerodynamics such that the shuttle would be literally shook apart. Even though what broke loose from the fuel cell is actually fairly lightweight and pliable, think about *anything* impacting something else at those speeds. I guess we saw the results. /sigh<br>
