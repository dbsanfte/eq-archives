****************Upstairs Comp<br>
********************|<br>
DSL -&gt;DSL Modem -&gt; Router (non wireless) -&gt; Router (Wireless) -&gt; Air waves -&gt; My Comp with wireless reciever network card<br>
<br>
I think my problem is that the two routers aren't talking, cuz I'm not seeing the &quot;link&quot; light lit up on the wireless one.  The connection between routers goes from the &quot;1&quot; slot (non-wireless) to the &quot;WLAN&quot; slot on the wireless.  Also, can I ping the wireless router from my comp?  or do you have to be directly connected?  I want to test whether my comp is communicating with the router.<br>
<br>
Looking for suggestions, and suffering from withdrawl.<br>

<br>
Let's see now.....<br>
<br>
Use the config app for your wireless card, you should be able to clearly see whether you are making contact with your wireless access point (WAP) or not. Also, if your system is being assingned an IP address (assuming your using DHCP), then you know that you are not only connecting with the WAP ok, but with whichever router is reponsible for DHCP services. To check if you've been assigned an IP address, just go to a DOS box and type ipconfig.<br>
<br>
Since you've gone with a double router configuration (I use a wired router, and a simple, not router style, WAP), make sure that only one of them is configured as a DHCP server. This double router business would be my #1 suspect for problems since you're essentially double filtering routing. You have the distinct possibility of conflicting address ranges inside and outside the second firewall/router.<br>
<br>
From your wireless system, you should be able to ping either of the routers unless one of them filters the ping port (10 I believe).<br>

<br>
I did a ping 192.168.1.1 (my wireless router) and got no response.  Will it send out a signal if it's not connected?  Somehow I doubt it.  <br>
<br>
I can't access the wireless router from my browser either, tried that.<br>
<br>
I'd love to cut the first router and go to one router, but that puts me at risk of botching her connection.<br>
<br>
Using an assign IP automatically approach, both computers are set this way.  <br>
<br>
Didn't try the ipconfig yet.  Don't think I'll have a gateway, since I'm not getting a signal from the router.<br>
<br>
My card is set up correctly, I'm pretty sure, and it's giving me a little network icon on the taskbar that says the router's unplugged from the network.  Does this mean it's getting a signal and knows the routers aren't talking?  Or does it do this when it's not getting a signal also?<br>
<br>
Basically, as you can probably guess, I know just enough about this stuff to make me smart enough to screw things up, but not enough to fix it.<br>

i took the simple way around the network problem and decided to go with out a router. i use a netgear switch and i have no trouble i have 3 computers hooked up to it. you may want to try a switch instead of 2 routers.<br>
just my 2 copper.<br>

<br>
You are pinging 192.168.1.1 - which you indicate is the wireless router. As it happens, that is also the default address for the wired linksys router. What I'm wondering is whether you have an IP conflict going on.<br>
<br>
The problems here are, however, multifold. First, there is the possibility of an IP conflict (both routers using the same IP address). Even beyond that, the issues here are pretty complex because both routers are going to be attempting to use the standard private class C network range (192.168.1.1 - 192.168.1.255). I believe that this is technically doable, but the wireless router may have an issue with it because it sees the same address rangers on both sides of the router.<br>
<br>
Both routers actually have two separate IP addresses assigned to them. The first is it's external IP (the IP address the rest of the world sees your network by). The second in the internal IP address (the one that your private network sees the router by.<br>
<br>
In a normal, single router configuration, the router will be assinged an external IP address that is either &quot;fixed&quot; (your ISP gives it to you and you type it in - it then stays that address permanently) or obtained from your ISP via their DHCP server. This is the one and only address that all of the outside world sees regardless of how many computers you have set up on your internal network (they all share that IP address as far as the outside world is concerned).<br>
<br>
On the internal side, the router has a fixed address. That address is, for almost all private networks, 192.168.1.1 because that's the default most any router manufacturer will set it to (it is the beginning of a standard &quot;Private Class C Network&quot; range. The router will usually, by default, be set to act as a DCHP server, and have a range of addresses set up as a pool to dole out on request to systems on the internal network. Essentially, when you start up a system on the network, they, if configured to use DHCP will look for a DHCP server on your network (which will turn out to be the router), and request an IP address. The router will give them an IP address to use for a period of time (the reservation period), and remove that IP from the list of available IP's until the reservation expires (usually in a few days). Your system will periodically refresh the subscription and either keep the same IP (usually the case), or, in some instances, be assigned a new one.<br>
<br>
All addresses in this private IP range are what are called &quot;non-routable&quot;. What this means is that all the systems that are in this range and all &quot;behind&quot; the router can see and talk to each other, but nothing outside the router will see them and, even if they did, they would refuse to route any data from them. If they need to make an external request (to the internet for example), then the router sees that internal request, and makes the request to the outside world substituting its own external address in the place of the requesting system's internal IP. When the response comes back, the router recognizes who the request was for, and passes it along to the correct internal system.<br>
<br>
What we have in your case is a router within a router. In your case, all the things that I've described above as being &quot;external&quot;, are &quot;external&quot; to the systems connected to your wireless router, but are &quot;internal&quot; to all the systems connected to your wired router - essentially it has to run through two hops.<br>
<br>
There would seem to me to be three ways to address this:<br>
<br>
1. Remove the &quot;wired&quot; router from the equation. Your wireless router should have several ports for wired connections too, and this would just simply things very, very much. You would need to change things so the wireless router is connected to your ISP via the WAN port on the router. Your wired systems would be connected to the LAN ports on the wiredess router. Your wireless systems would obviously connect via the airwaves. The wireless router is handing ALL routing for your network - just one thing to deal with instead of two. This would be what I would consider the &quot;preferred&quot; way of doing things by a fairly large margin based on what you seem to have for goals.<br>
2. Assuming your DSL modem/bridge/router (whichever you have) has more than one port on it (they almost all do), connect both routers directly to the internet. You'll need request an additional IP address from your ISP (if you're using fixes) for the additional connected or just configure it to get it's external address via DHCP if that's the way you get IP's. This one makes for a relatively simple fix, but it also means that your wireless based systems are going to be on a different private network that the wired ones (meaning they won't be abel to &quot;see&quot; each other, and that you won't be able to share things like printers across the network without some real complex setup work).<br>
3. Maintain the same general network topology, but change one or the other private network (probably the wired one) to use a different private network range (The Private Class A range runs 10.0.0.1 and up with a 255.0.0.0 mask). This is much more complex to set up, and will require some additional learning on your part (you don't have to become a full computer geek, but you will have to get some on you - lol).<br>
<br>
Again, my strong advice is to take option #1. This will put you far more squarely in the camp of &quot;the way it's usually done&quot; and will therefore leave you a much larger pool of folks that can help you finish getting things fixed. I can probably help walk you through what you need for any of these setups, but the later 2 in particular are non-trivial and it may take a while and a lot of exchanged. #2 will probably not take very long to get basic operation going, but will take a while to deal with all the fallout issues (like how to you manage to print if you're on the wrong network from the printer).<br>
<br>
Sing<br>
<br>
PS: Oh. If you chose the straight switched notion, you're going to need a pulbic IP address for each of your systems. It also means that you'll be &quot;wide open&quot; in terms of the range of <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>possible</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> hack attempts. Doesn't mean you'll get hacked, but it does mean that you'll have many more ways with which you could potentially be hacked. Also, your wireless router probably does not have a bypass mode that skips the router side (if it does, then we may be able to simulate #1 a little different wawy), so you would lose your wireless.<br>

Ash: I haven't done too bad with all of Linksys stuff with the extreme exception of their wireless cards (that go in each PC) - those are simply TERRIBLE.<br>

The WAP units were and continue to be reasonably well thought of - originally, they were the only once with a reasonable adapter for going with an high gain attenna. They were very nice for that use. For cards, the Orinoco's rule - I also hear good things about the NetGear stuff. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#00000F><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub135.ezboard.com/bexodusfellowshipforum.showUserPublicProfile?gid=arathainkelvar>ArathainKelvar</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Guild Leader</span><br>  Posts: 962<br> <font color=#A8A8A8>(3/3/03 5:53 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub135.ezboard.com/fexodusfellowshipforumfrm11.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=54.topic&index=8>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.exodusfellowship.com/Arathain_small.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Anyone know anything about wireless networks?</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :rant --><img src=http://friedman.virtualave.net/ikonboard/emoticons/rant.gif ALT=":rant"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->    @$%@&amp;#@&amp;@%#!#!#%!*&amp;@^$#%!#  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :splat --><img src=http://www.exodusfellowship.com/smiley_splat.gif ALT=":splat"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=431525" target="top">What should I upgrade next?</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000028><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub135.ezboard.com/bexodusfellowshipforum.showUserPublicProfile?gid=singsang>SingSang</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 1464<br> <font color=#A8A8A8>(3/3/03 6:43 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub135.ezboard.com/fexodusfellowshipforumfrm11.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=54.topic&index=9>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://66.93.39.18/images/Singthumb.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Anyone know anything about wireless networks?</span><hr size=1> Hmmmm.

Taking the wired router out of the mix is going to be my first step. The next option is to segment the network - determine how to config one router to bind to 192.168.2.1, and the other can stay on 192.168.1.1. I am quite certain Sing is right that you have IP conflict going on, but also bear in mind that because they are both routers and not hubs or switches, they are responsible for doing DHCP handouts of other IP addresses from the SAME range. A switch is a little smarter because on most equipment, they can handle those multiple segments all at once.<br>

I bribed a guy to come over and fix it for me, I knew I was in good hands when I mentioned it was supposed to snow again on Tuesday and he said, &quot;Yeah, double-u tee eff&quot; (WTF).  <br>
