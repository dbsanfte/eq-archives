This is written by the guild leader of Capulus. She has two 65's and a 61 - one of the 65's being a cleric of course. Capulus is a guild losely the size - perhaps even slighly smaller - than EF. I'm not positive that they have a single cleric main, but they do carry around a army of botted clerics. Despite their size being smaller than usual for the task, they recently took down Vindi by themselves. I've watched them work, and they put together some pretty effectve healing chains - especially when you realize that ever single cleric is being run by someone trying to run another toon. This guide explains some of the principals of CH chains and the way they go about implementing them. I know that EF is growing in a manner that will require more and more of this, so I thought I'd toss it out there for your reading pleasure. I make a note at the end of at least one change that EF would want to make given that they have living breathing clerics as opposed to those that run on hot keys pressed from a user at a near by system.....<br>
<br>
<br>
Remember, this is verbatim as written by Meeka (65 Coercer. Her cleric is Ceyria, 65 Archon. She also has a 61 Virtuoso).<br>
<!--EZCODE HR START--><hr /><!--EZCODE HR END--><br>
'm being reminded that not all the clerics here have done much chain healing, and it would be helpful if I mumbled about some of this stuff. I don't promise to be coherent, I've had my nose in graphics all morning. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
At a guess, everyone here is familiar with a complete heal chain. It's used when we fight a mob that has high dps (damage per second). You have a group of clerics casting complete heal every X seconds on the MT. The number of seconds between heals depends on the MT's hit points vs. the mobs DPS against him. For example, if a mob's dps is 1k, and your tank has 7k hps.. in 7 seconds, your tank is dead. Having a 5 or 6 second complete heal chain for this will ideally heal your tank when he's down to 1k or so hps. It leaves room for fizzles, human error, etc. You can also see why it's so important to have other healers (clerics, druids, shaman, paladins) assigned to do &quot;burst&quot; healing during the fight, to give fast heals to keep the chain solid.<br>
<br>
An added element to this is that if you are using a defensive warrior to tank this mob, the mob's dps against him is drastically different while he's defensive and when it drops. Meaning that you are either going to have to switch tanks when it drops, or speed up the chain to compensate. Unless mana is going to be an issue, it's much much easier to pick up the pace, IMO. That will be determined on a mob by mob basis, of course.<br>
<br>
Hotkeys are your friends. When I request a complete heal chain for something I am running, I will want to see these hotkeys used. Capulus runs it's chains on cleric bots, so hotkeys are essential for us. It's not likely that it's a person just playing a cleric, they're probably on another toon at the same time. At the time of my writing this, our clerics are botted by: enchanter, enchanter, bard, shadowknight, shadowknight, wizard, and I don't know which of short squad actually bots Ironhealer.<br>
<br>
When I run a chain, I am going to set up a seperate channel for the healers and the potential tanks should be in there as well. By healers I mean clerics, druids, shaman, paladins, anyone else I'm missing that will be expected to help heal if needed. The channel name will always be:<br>
caphealers:cap<br>
I think I'm going to set this to autojoin on my computers as well. Unless I'm insane, the command to do that is /auto caphealers:cap<br>
<br>
I want the CH chain to report to this channel, so the hotkeys below should reflect the channel number, not /rs (changing it now). The defensive warrior should give us a 10 second warning before defensive drops, and that should go to this channel. Basically, any healing information should go to this channel only. I'd recommend making this channel the brightest, most obnoxious color possible, and giving it a seperate chat box wtih a nice big font. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
Clerics should have a permanant hotkey bank just for complete heals. You should have a hotkey for each complete heal chain from 2 to 9 seconds, just in case. For ease, I'm going to assume that complete heal is in your second slot in the following example. It doesnt' have to be, but make sure that your /cast key is set for your complete heal. I'm also assuming that the caphealers channel is channel 1. Your hotkeys should be set up like:<br>
<br>
2 second chain:<br>
line 1: /cast 2<br>
line 2: ;1 Complete Heal %t [next cleric] in 2<br>
line 3: /cast 2<br>
line 4: /pause 15<br>
line 5: ;1 [NEXT CLERIC] START NOW!<br>
<br>
3 second chain:<br>
line 1: /cast 2<br>
line 2: ;1 Complete Heal %t [next cleric] in 3<br>
line 3: /cast 2<br>
line 4: /pause 25<br>
line 5: ;1 [NEXT CLERIC] START NOW!<br>
<br>
4 second chain:<br>
line 1: /cast 2<br>
line 2: ;1 Complete Heal %t [next cleric] in 4<br>
line 3: /cast 2<br>
line 4: /pause 35<br>
line 5: ;1 [NEXT CLERIC] START NOW!<br>
<br>
5 second chain:<br>
line 1: /cast 2<br>
line 2: ;1 Complete Heal %t [next cleric] in 5<br>
line 3: /cast 2<br>
line 4: /pause 45<br>
line 5: ;1 [NEXT CLERIC] START NOW!<br>
<br>
6 second chain:<br>
line 1: /cast 2<br>
line 2: ;1 Complete Heal %t [next cleric] in 6<br>
line 3: /cast 2<br>
line 4: /pause 55<br>
line 5: ;1 [NEXT CLERIC] START NOW!<br>
<br>
7 second chain:<br>
line 1: /cast 2<br>
line 2: ;1 Complete Heal %t [next cleric] in 7<br>
line 3: /cast 2<br>
line 4: /pause 65<br>
line 5: ;1 [NEXT CLERIC] START NOW!<br>
<br>
8 second chain:<br>
line 1: /cast 2<br>
line 2: ;1 Complete Heal %t [next cleric] in 8<br>
line 3: /cast 2<br>
line 4: /pause 75<br>
line 5: ;1 [NEXT CLERIC] START NOW!<br>
<br>
9 second chain:<br>
line 1: /cast 2<br>
line 2: ;1 Complete Heal %t [next cleric] in 9<br>
line 3: /cast 2<br>
line 4: /pause 85<br>
line 5: ;1 [NEXT CLERIC] START NOW!<br>
<br>
Once the complete heal order is given, please update the appropriate keys to show the name of the cleric after you. For example.. complete heal order is Ceyria, Vaea, Kantar, Kleria, Juhel, and it's a 6/3 chain (meaning it's a 6 second chain til the warrior's defensive drops, then it jumps to 3 seconds). For the 6 and 3 keys, at least, Ceyria needs to change both occurances of &quot;next cleric&quot; to &quot;VAEA.&quot; Still need to write down the order of the chain, and Ceyria needs to be aware of if Juhel doesn't start the heal when Kleria calls for it, so that she can jump in there. If both clerics hit the hotkey at the same time, the one who isn't supposed to be healing should duck out and let the clerics know.<br>
<br>
The pause is shorter to give half a second reaction time to the next cleric. Clerics are also encouraged to count along with this, just in case the cleric before them hit the wrong hotkey. It shoudl be apparent by the number of seconds given in the second line what key they are using, but in the battle there is no guarantee you will see it. Just watch for the cleric before you to heal, and count. For some reason, I count more steadily when I tap my foot.. take that for what it's worth. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
Fun things can happen. You can get interrupted during your CH. Having a key handy to press to alert the channel ;1 Ceyria's Heal INTERRUPTED! is not a bad idea. However, if you are mid pause, you can't use hotkeys, so be ready to hit that key once the pause is over (when your second message goes off). Keep a solid burst heal up (nothing tops Supernal Remedy or Supernal Light for this) and as soon as you have gotten back on your feet, be ready to burst heal along with the backup healers to cover the next cleric's CH.<br>
<br>
The tank can get OOR (out of range). This happens if the melee don't control the push while fighting a mob, and normally ends in devastation and wasted mana. There's reasons we need the mob to remain stationary and keep the melee in a nice surrounding pattern. Pinging a mob in the high end game will likely wipe your raid. No pressure, casters!<br>
<br>
You could fizzle your complete heals. There are two castings of it there, be sure to keep ready to manually hit the spell gem again if that happens.<br>
<br>
It's essential to pay close attention at the beginning of the cycle. Clerics have been known to go LD, and the clerics remaining may have to change the CH order. Be very aware of what the order is.. write it down and keep it handy. If you see that a heal isn't started by the cleric before you when it's supposed to.. take over. Also, once in the chain, you may need to adjust it either up or down. Be ready to listen to the cleric running things, and be ready to change to a different hotkey if needed.<br>
<br>
Along with your CH hotkeys, you will need to make targetting hotkeys for all the potential tanks. If you lose the MT in a battle, it's hell. Make a key for each potential tank. /tar NAME<br>
Nothing fancy, but it's the fastest way to target the next tank in line to keep them alive.. unless they happen to be in your group.. since F keys are easier. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
I'll add more later as I think of it. But this is the promised start. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :p --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":p"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<!--EZCODE HR START--><hr /><!--EZCODE HR END--><br>
<br>
For EF, you would probably want to take the pause out of it and count manually - keeping the &quot;next cleric start&quot; button separate. At least, that's what I'm told.<br>
<br>
I'm sure there clerics here know much, much more about this than I do, but I found it an interesting read for me given my up and coming cleric, and, frankly, just in knowing &quot;what's involved with all that&quot; even if I didn't have one. <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top"> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub135.ezboard.com/fexodusfellowshipforumfrm6.showPrevMessage?topicID=1385.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub135.ezboard.com/fexodusfellowshipforumfrm6.showNextMessage?topicID=1385.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a self href=http://pub135.ezboard.com/fexodusfellowshipforumfrm6.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1385.topic><img src=http://www.exodusfellowship.com/add-_reply.jpg border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub135.ezboard.com/fexodusfellowshipforumfrm6.emailToFriend?topicID=1385.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub135.ezboard.com/fexodusfellowshipforumfrm6.threadControl?topicID=1385.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/black_default/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands</a><br> <a href=http://pub135.ezboard.com/fexodusfellowshipforumfrm6.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=1385.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/ultimate/subscribe.gif width=20 height=20 border=0 alt="Click to receive email notification of replies"> Click to receive email notification of replies</a> <br>  <a href=http://pub135.ezboard.com/fexodusfellowshipforumfrm6.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=1385.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/ultimate/unsubscribe.gif width=20 height=20 border=0 alt="Click to stop receiving email notification of replies"> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies</a> <br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub135.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="exodusfellowshipforumfrm6">The Grand Hall<option value="exodusfellowshipforumfrm5">Event Planning<option value="exodusfellowshipforumfrm3">Tales of the Fellowship!<option value="exodusfellowshipforumfrm10">Epic Quests<option value="exodusfellowshipforumfrm4">Exodus Classifieds<option value="exodusfellowshipforumfrm8">The Vault<option value="exodusfellowshipforumfrm13">Tradeskiller's Anonymous<option value="exodusfellowshipforumfrm11">Out of Character<option value="exodusfellowshipforumfrm12">Applications<option value="exodusfellowshipforumfrm7">The High Council Chambers<option value="exodusfellowshipforumfrm9">Officers Lounge<option value="exodusfellowshipforumfrm14">Fellowship Lodgings</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#A8A8A8>- </font><a href=http://pub135.ezboard.com/bexodusfellowshipforum>Exodus Fellowship Forum</a><font color=#A8A8A8> - </font><a href=http://pub135.ezboard.com/fexodusfellowshipforumfrm6>The Grand Hall</a> <font color=#A8A8A8> - </font><a href="http://www.exodusfellowship.com">The Exodus Fellowship</a><font color=#A8A8A8> - </font><br><br>  <br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 7.245d<br>Copyright ©1999-2003 ezboard, Inc.</center></body></html>
