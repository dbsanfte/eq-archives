<br>
<br>
<br>
NEW TIME: Charkdok Royals - Feb 7th, 630PM Eastern 52+<br>
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
 While this thing is really focused on Q and Angel's epics, the royals are also involved in other epics. I know that we have Gorgd wanting the queen for the warrior epic, but since we are staying for the king twice, we should have time to do the queen again and fulfill another warrior's epic - so, the question is, what other warrior is working on thier epic. If we don't come up with one, then I or someone else will want to loot her again for a future MQ with someone.<br>
<br>
ALSO: The prince - who we need to kill on our way to the overking - is needed for the chanter epic: Do we have two or even one chanter actually working on thier epic? Mowgli? Boe? Who?<br>
<br>
Well, with this recent influx of relatively high toons into the Fellowship and CoS, the horsepower of their combined forces has gone over at least one or two thresholds in terms of mob capability.<br>
<br>
With this in mind, I thought I would give a rather late going away party for myself and a &quot;reverse going away&quot; present (there the departer gives something to those left behind) to Qural and Angeliqe.<br>
<br>
Both of them are two kills from their epics - the Overking in Chardok, and Ragefire. Of those two, Chardok is the much tougher animal to organize and complete, plus it has to be done before you have all you need to spawn Rage.<br>
<br>
TO DIGRESS FOR A MOMENT: Having epic clerics around is a MAJOR alteration to your guild's raid capabilities. It means that an entire raid force can go from wipeout to fully rezzed and medding mana back up in just 5-15 minutes depeding on the raid force size. It also means your clerics can rez mid battle without the risk that the mana drain will leave them unable to heal someone in battle. In a nutshell, it's huge. The list goes on.<br>
<br>
OK, so here's the deal:<br>
<br>
WHEN: February 7th, 6:30PM Eastern<br>
WHERE: Chardok zone lineWHAT: The Chardok Royals<br>
WHO: 24 (no more, no less than 1 52+ toons. <br>
<br>
GOAL: Take down the Chardok Royals (at least to the Overking) not once, but twice. They are on a two hour spawn, so we'll remain in Chardok waiting on the respawn. This will be the final piece for both Qural and Angel (assuming they can both make it, otherwise I suspect I know another cleric or two that will be happy to step into the void) before they trigger Rage, kill him, and get their epic. Assuming this goes well, we'll have to schedule up Rage right away and do him twice too. lol.<br>
<br>
SECONDARY GOALS:<br>
<br>
Take out the queen if there is a warrior there that is working on his/her epic<br>
Continue to grow in our learning and tactics<br>
Take out the Iksar Betrayer for the monk epic (if he's up, and he won't be)<br>
Get &quot;phat lutz&quot;<br>
HAVE FUN<br>
<br>
<br>
If you are planning to attend, please SIGN UP by responding to this thread or chatting with me in game. The level 52 floor on this is HARD - I won't budge on it because of significant aggro issues. Also because of aggro and fast repops, we will take 24 max on this. We need 24 or so to get the job done, so we want 24, but we'll try it down to as few as 18 depending on class balancing. 52+ is the first issue, class balancing is also a signficant concern.<br>
<br>
I will post a guide - including maps - to what we will be doing at least one week ahead of time. I would very much appreciate those who sign up looking that guide over prior to raid time.<br>
<br>
This is a VERY doable raid for EF and it's allies. Let's see a great turnout to support Q and Angel. When (not if) we pull this one off, the stage will be set for doing Rage and for moving the other high clerics through their epics if they so choose.<br>

For the King probably not. The Queen, OH YEAH, usually a paladin pins the Queen to the back wall. LoH's on himself and he gets everyone's AGGRO, about 11 MOBS. Main TANK goes in and starts whacking on the Queen. 2 enchanters AoE MEZ everything else. One at each wall to cover all the ground. Enchanters should have their AoE stuns up too.<br>
<br>
After you BREAK the camps its pretty easy to hold. A rogue is required to open the door to the Chardok Royals also.<br>
<br>
I work Friday the 7th so I'm out, unless my brother wants to take Zin there. If he went there he would most likely take the Prince out for Zin. Been down there 4 times and have yet to go toward the Prince. Its always the King and Queen.<br>
<br>
Also there's a pit trap that will AGGRO almost everything in the King room if you have SoE and floating slowly downward. Did a GOOD WIPEOUT on that once. I think its at the library room with the staircase, behind the stairs on the right is a pit trap, stay left or you DIE.<br>
<br>
Its a FUN camp and HARD to get to the actual camp. Its worth it though in the END.<br>
<br>
Just make sure you are with 2 enchanters.<br>

<br>
The royals are on a two hour timer, so they'll either be up, or be &quot;close enough&quot; that we can wait on them. Friday's raid is not likely to run into a major problem with it being camped. It's possible that someone will already be down raiding them, but it's unlikely to be more than one, and you have a good chance of being able to wait it out.<br>
<br>
Saturday's raid is much more likely to run into something of a &quot;line&quot;, which can happen at the Royals. You'll have someone down doing them, someone fighting their way down, and a group at the entrance waiting their turn. It doesn't happen every weekend, but it happens semi-regularly. Only time will tell what we'll have for competition on getting to the mob. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000028><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub135.ezboard.com/bexodusfellowshipforum.showUserPublicProfile?gid=ursimajor1>UrsiMajor1</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Administrator</span><br>  Posts: 876<br> <font color=#A8A8A8>(2/7/03 7:42 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub135.ezboard.com/fexodusfellowshipforumfrm6.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1053.topic&index=7>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.webdesignbyursula.com/ursi_5.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_exclamation_mark.gif" align=absmiddle>  General confusion about raid</span><hr size=1> Ok there is a lot of confusion from key players on the raid date.<br>

That's Saturday.<br>
<br>
Angel has added an <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>additional</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> one back at the original (albeit mistaken) time.<br>
<br>
So, what you have:<br>
<br>
Sing RL (the original raid): Saturday at 6:30PM EASTERN.<br>
Angel (another one, only first): Friday at 6:30PM EASTERN (last time I heard anyway)<br>
<br>
I will repost on groups today, but, as of this moment, we do not have what we need for Saturday - I don't know how Angel is doing recruiting wise.  We are still in need of clerics (Q committed a month or so ago, but I haven't heard a commitment from him on this since then, so, ATM, I only have Ursi and Angel as relatively sure things in my mind). We need at least 3 if we go with just 18, and 4 if we go with any more than that. We will NOT do the Queen unless we have a particularly strong 18 (doesn't look like it ATM), or the full 24 we were originally looking for. We also only have one 55+  tank (Sindee), and I would definitely like to see another tank in the SA roll (We'll use Gorgd, and I'm sure he'll do great, but I really would like to see someone even higher than Sindee in the MA slot and Sindee move to SA). Last, but not least, we do not have a Rogue, and we need one that's 200+ lockpick.<br>
<br>
Essentially, if this doesn't look a lot closer by the end of the day, I'm going to call the Saturday raid. Angel will have to make that judgement for the Friday one.<br>
<br>
Now, all the date confusion is my fault, very sorry about that. Hopefully we can still get this together and make it happen. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#00000F><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub135.ezboard.com/bexodusfellowshipforum.showUserPublicProfile?gid=angeliqe@exodusfellowshipforum>Angeliqe</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 159<br> <font color=#A8A8A8>(2/8/03 4:33 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub135.ezboard.com/fexodusfellowshipforumfrm6.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1053.topic&index=10>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_exclamation_mark.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: MOST IMPORTANT EF RAID EVER</span><hr size=1> Friday's raid went with 25 people average lvl 56 to start out with.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   We made it all the way to the overking with little mishaps, but due to people having to leave, we were down to 18 when we finally got there.  No monk for FD pulling, so we decided it would be too hard for a necro to pull, hehe.  Had everyone run into his room and tried to mez things.  Was down to one lvl 60 enchanter who refused to use AE mez, so she only had one mob mezzed by the time I needed to heal the MA (lvl 57 warrior).  Long story short, I got agro, I died.  Mobs do not hit hard.  Only 110ish for average and 188 from the king himself from my experience, but I got nuked several times for 600-1200 and I just don't have that many hps for 4-5 mobs like that, lol.  I think the king was reported at 60% from the last person standing.  Definately need more than one enchanter mezzing, use ae mez/stuns or some type of FD pull.  He is not a hard mob, but is highly magic resistant.  I recommend slowers not waste time trying to slow him and slow the other mobs instead.  If you have time and mana, then try to debuff the king and slow him. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000028><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub135.ezboard.com/bexodusfellowshipforum.showUserPublicProfile?gid=singsang>SingSang</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 1409<br> <font color=#A8A8A8>(2/8/03 5:45 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub135.ezboard.com/fexodusfellowshipforumfrm6.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1053.topic&index=11>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://66.93.39.18/images/Singthumb.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_exclamation_mark.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: MOST IMPORTANT EF RAID EVER</span><hr size=1> Notes from the guide I had written, but haven't be able to get up:<br>
<br>
AoE Mezz is everything. If the chanter isn't willing to AoE mezz (that is, do their job), then leave them at the door. End of Story.<br>
FD pulling of that room is generally considered wildly difficult to impossible. Is true with the queen too.<br>
King is a relative wimp if taken alone (as you have already surmised). Need to tash and OOS him (55 bard for the later) early and nuke the heck out of him.<br>
If your AoE mezzes fail, then you're in AoE attack land.<br>
Oh, and as to multiple chanters - you need that anyway when you go to do the queen. The mobs are too spread out to get them all with one cast, so you need to have two chanters pick the mobs on opposite sides and AoE mezz with them as the target.<br>
<br>
ANGEL: Can you take over this raid? I've had something come up and am unlikely to make it back on in time - indeed, I may not be back on today at all. I'll check briefly in about a half hour or so, and if I haven't heard anything, I'm going to call this one since it doesn't not really have enough peeps anyway (figure with you, however, that you may be able to gather up the other needed classes).<br>
