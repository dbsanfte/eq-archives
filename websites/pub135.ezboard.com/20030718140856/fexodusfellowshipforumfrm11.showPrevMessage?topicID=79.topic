Dan my brother's friend from German is staying with us and he calls my bedroom the MINI Blockbuster. Why go there when Mike has it all. I also have about a thousand VHS tapes. Dan plays Xercez and Bendere on EQ. He's always watching a DVD when playing EQ on the dining room table. 6 computers at the house now. A whole group of mostly level 65's or level 59 TOONS.<br>

  The Justice League has been my favorite comic ever since the wonderful years of Maguire and Giffen. God, you could not beat that. I mean you had heroes acting like real people- for example Booster Gold ( a second stringer ) wondered aloud when  he was emptying the garbage, why Batman never had to take out the trash <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->     <br>

They would say while touching each other to active their powers, &quot;Wonder Twins powers active&quot; then say form of a tidal wave, shape of a eagle. Hey having about 20 thousand comic books you learn a thing or two about Super Heroes.<br>
<br>
Now Rore if your talking about Guy Gardner as a Green Lantern. Boy I LOVED it when Batman put that JERK into place. Hal Jordan the REAL GREEN LANTERN in my book, DC Comics made him EVIL, its about when I stop buying comics. Too expensive and losing Heroes that you like Hal Jordan and Barry Allen(the only real Flash)(in the NEW DVD movie Catch me if you can). Now DVD's take all my money.<br>
<br>
My favorite Super Hero of all time Captain America, AKA Steven Rogers, from Marvel Comics. DC Comics, I would say Barry Allen as the Flash. Second choices from Marvel Iron Man, AKA Anthony Stark, RICH boy, funded the Avengers, which CAP and Iron Man were a part of. From DC Comics Batman, AKA Bruce Wayne, the man with too much money to know what to do with it all.<br>
<br>
MAN, I like going to Best Buy when the NEW movies come out and getting stuff like the Superfriend Challenge on DVD or the NEW X-Men videos. Nothing better than watching the stuff you used to like as a kid. Now my nephew is totally into Batman, the Superfriends and the X-Men. Uncle Michael corrupting his nephew at so young a age as 5 years old. Now if only he could learn to play EQ alittle bit FASTER, we could have another level 60 tank in our GUILD. LOOK OUT Norrath, Luclin, and the Planes here comes Markyogg, LOL.<br>
<br>
I HOPE he nevers gets into the garage and fine all my comic books. He doesn't take care of his own stuff to well. He could OBLIBERATE my entire stash of comics.<br>
<br>
TAKE CARE EFers<br>

<br>
Yep, I've been a Trekker since the early seventies.  When they started releasing the various versions on DVD I had to have them.<br>
<br>
I have even gone as far as designing new cover art for the DVDs because I and some other nuts have found the original Paramount packaging to be rather wanting!<br>
<br>
If you're interested, they are featured on <!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.hometheaterforum.com/images/coverart/index.html" target="top">this page</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--> and also <!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.dvdcoverart.com/dvdcoverart/search.php?dowhat=search&amp;keywords=Easton&amp;mod=and&amp;iso=Authors" target="top">here</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--> at <!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.hometheaterforum.com/htforum/index.php" target="top">Home Theater Forum</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--> and <!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.dvdcoverart.com/dvdcoverart/" target="top">DVD Cover Art</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--> respectively.<br>
<br>
As for comic book obsessions...  I started reading them around the same time.  When Peter Parker's girlfriend Gwen Stacy died after falling off that bridge at the hands of the Green Goblin I was hooked!  I read mostly Marvel back then.  In addition to Spiderman, I also was fond of Captain America, Iron Man and the Fantastis Four.  I never got into the X-MEN!  I also picked up the occasional Superman and Batman, though back then the stories were rather lacking.  As I got older, I bought less and less, but still stayed pretty much up to speed on Spidey and was there thru his wedding with MJ, the death of Aunt May and that awful clone saga.  I thought I was out after they brought back Aunt May and the Green Goblin.  Then they brought in the writer/creator of Babylon 5 and I was back in. No surprise,  B5 has been another favorite show of mine.<br>
<br>
There were a few periods when I wasn't buying any but then would get sucked back in,  For instance, about 10 years ago we did a news story (I work at a TV station) on the death of Superman.  The guy at the counter gave me a free issue and I have been buying Supes ever since.  Although I do not care for the Manga style art they have been doing the last few years.  Or the fact that they make his chin so big, he looks like Jay Leno!<br>
<br>
Way back in those early days I learned to draw pretty well from them, and at one time thought I was gonna be a comic book artist!  Seeing what they can do now is absolutley stunning, and I could never come close to the talent that is out there now.<br>
<br>
Well, that's enough nerdy ramblings for now,,,  It's off to work.<br>

Captain Kirk, Mr. Spock, Doctor McCoy, Scotty, and Sulu could do almost anything. They could get out of any trouble. Poor security officers though DIE way to much as its my profession now. I did like Star Trek Deep Space Nine better than the Next Generation or Star Trek Voyager. Getting the Defiant on Deep Space Nine helped out alot.<br>
<br>
Having Deep Space Nine attacked by the Klingons then losing it to the Gamma Quadrant aliens was KICK @$$#. Worf, Chief Miles O'Brien and other Star Trek now and then show-ups did alot of HELP for Deep Space Nine.<br>
<br>
Seeing the Borg get their @$$ WHIPPED by those living aliens was SWEET on Star Trek Voyager. I remember HIGH fiving my BRO when that was first on. Borg ships getting BLOW to pieces by one ship, that was so AWESOME a sight.<br>
<br>
Never did get into B5, I did watch it from time to time. Now Space 1999, I have the complete DVD set. Waiting for the Lost in Space complete set to come out. I've still yet to buy the complete seasons of any Star Trek series. I'm not ready to spend that kind of money yet. Like $119 at Best Buy, their usually the cheapest price in San Diego.<br>
<br>
I haven't bought any comics in years. I might start up again when my nephew can take better care of things. I remember my first comic book in 3rd grade. I won it for going around the class room, beating everyone on math answers. I got the #1 issue of Spetacular Spider-Man, its was abuse by myself and younger brothers back then. I still have it, the cover is LONG GONE and its faded to orange. What do you expect from a 8 year old boy and his younger brothers. That issue got me HOOKED way back when.<br>
<br>
Some day I'll get back into the comic book collecting thing, but that's way later on.<br>

Nice to talk Trek with you.  While Picard became my favorite Captain (Stewart is an awesome actor) It was DS9 that became my favorite of the modern Star Treks.  I loved the continuing story line and the way the characters actually grew and developed.  As much as I loved Next Gen when it came out, you could basically play those episodes in any order and it wouldn't matter much.<br>
<br>
While I enjoyed many of the 2 part Voyager episodes, it seemed like a step backward to me.  As far as the current Enterprise...  well the jury is still out, but I think they need to get a few new writers in there.  The stories are seeming way to predictable.  Of course with 27 seasons and 10 movies...  maybe new ideas are getting hard to come by<br>
<br>
Live long and prosper,<br>

As a actor I don't think you can get any better than him, Anthony Hopkins comes close.<br>
<br>
I'm told X2 ROCKS, my brother and Dan went to watch it. They had Woverine actually killing people in it, but no bloody gorey stuff, like when a person actually loses a arm from Adamantium claws.<br>
<br>
William Shattner will always be my favorite Captain. Captain Sisko my second, I like Captain Picard but was always alittle to tight, until the end of the series. Captain Kirk always BROKE the rules or bend them to his way of thinking. It took Captain Picard awhile to get into this line of thinking. A starship Captain has not only the fate of his crew in his hands, but the mission also. So you do what needs to be done to get everyone out of it ALIVE, then have the Space Time police come see you or Starfleet Brass boarding your ship.<br>
<br>
Patrick Steward ROCKS though.<br>

Picard lived a whole lifetime on another world and it was an acting tour de force.  He also did a really fine job when he was being held hostage by the Cardassians in &quot;Chain of Command&quot;<br>

<br>
Looking forward to seeing Matrix and the Hulk come out this month.<br>
<br>
I saw X2 this weekend, can you say Dark Phoenix saga beginning with the next movie. Nightcrawler was a BAD @$$, I've never seen him port so much in my LIFE. Nightcrawler wasn't even in control of himself while he did all that mischeif. Wolverine babysitting? that was a BAD choice, here kid have a beer. J/King. It was a GOOD movie, but I'm still waiting on the Sentinels to come in and start taking names.<br>

Carrying 70+ boxes of comic books weighing from 40 pounds to 10 pounds from the garage to the new shed my brother built. Can you say lower back PAIN. I'm sore to my biceps down to my calves. Plus theres more to come, we're not finished yet with it. My brother has to install some shelves so we don't have the boxes collasping in on themselves. Some comics are in boxes and others are in plastic containers. Anything from a ATAT to several hundred action figures can be found in that shed. I have the whole Star Fleet in there too.<br>
<br>
What's FUNNY is my brother thought he could put other things in that shed. I told him you have got to be kidding. My comics and action figures alone took the whole right side of his garage up. Needless to say that that 10' X 8' shed is pretty much filled up. I'm proud to say that he didn't injure himself this time on his second attempt on a shed. The first one he impaled himself with a drill, trying to drill through a metal angle. This was for a friend years ago. Got himself right between the thumb and index finger, the webbing and tissue around there. He called me at my Mom's saying &quot;BRO can you take me to the hospital.&quot; I asked him &quot;What happened?&quot; He said &quot;I drove a drill bit through my hand.&quot; Then it went on about he couldn't pull his hands apart. He had been holding them together for to long a time and they stuck together from the blood. I told him to &quot;run his hands through some hot water and I'll be there as fast as I can. His first shed wasn't very weather proof. It started leaking in about two years and all because it was a plain flat roof.<br>
<br>
This time he stuck to what he knew about. He worked in sheet metal for 7 years. He made a metal shed, angled the roof on it. He weather proof the hell outta it. He put sheet rock in it to absorb moisture and retain heat. After all the rain San Diego has had in the few months of this year its held up well.<br>
<br>
Next is his attempt to create a workshop in the garage. To get out of his BAD EQ habits, YEAH right that will stop it. Saying he needs to work on home improvement.<br>

Id love to get my hands on those comic books. <br>
<br>
I got into collecting comics rather late in life, but I have a love of DC and Marvel. Black Window and Silver Sable as well as Domino were some of my favorites!!!!!!!!!!!! *Sigh* I prolly only have a box or two of comic books at this point, but at least I got addicted. Im also very much into graphic novels. I love Neil Gaimans (sp??) Sandman and Death stories... go ENDLESS!!!!!!!! <br>
<br>
As for being a Trekkie, well I have to say that like Zin, I am a fan of the Old Star Trek, I love watching Capt Kirk and the gang. Trouble with Trebbles is one of my favorite episodes. I dig the movies as well. But I can say that I dont collect the way Kam and Zin do - I just cant afford it. Although I do have a growing collection of McFarlane toys that are NBO's!!!!!!<br>
