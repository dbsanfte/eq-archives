</span><hr size=1> It was a sunny day, with clouds whisking by the sun as quickly as they appeared.  The winds seemed to come from the west, but then they would change directions and come from the north.  The air smelled of an incoming rain.  Being a wood elf, I always planned for events like rain, so I pulled out my cloak, but being a crafty rogue, I pulled out my sunglasses which I stole from the ogres of Timorous Deep, and then grinned as I placed them on my face.<br>
  As I passed the druids, they frowned at me as if I didn’t belong in the midst of nature.  The forest loomed ahead, like a monster from the ancient texts.  They called the forest by the name of Kithcore, a friendly name for a vicious place.  As a youngster I learned to fear that place, but as an adult, I merely laughed at its hidden dangers with ignorance.  I stopped my trek for a brief moment, and deeply inhaled the air.  I knew in the back of my mind that that would be the last time for a long while I would smell familiar air.  It wouldn’t be my first time that I left familiar lands to venture into the world, but no doubt, this would be the most dangerous.  I slowly exhaled finally, and stepped forward once again.  <br>
As I entered the woods, the rain that I knew was upon me, began.  I removed my sunglasses, no longer in need of them with the woods blocking all the sunlight.  I looked left, then right, checked for others, pulled my cloak tighter, then vanished before any unseen eyes.  From the texts I had managed to find, I knew it would be wise to use my trade skills, for the horrors held within these woods seem to have rarely let any descriptions leave the woods.<br>
I thought back to the night I decided to do this quest, back to the old man in the bar.  The man claimed to have once been a great assassin.  His kills had taken him all around Norrath he said, until he was hired to kill one man.  His only failed kill.  He spoke of his target, a short stocky man, with large hairy feet, and no facial hair.  Then he admitted a bitter truth to me.  A truth that no rogue likes to admit.  He said he never made it to his target, not once even saw his target.  He then uttered a curse to a forest so treacherous that even a rogue could not pass freely without care.  I laughed at the man and quickly asked him a question.<br>
“Old man, do you speak of the Kithcore woods?  I mean, I’ve heard stories, but I grew to believe them just wives’ tales to scare little kids.”<br>
“Oh yes, that would be what I speak of, but those stories are far from being lies, and weigh on the side of truth.  You see this cane boy, how do you think I got this cane?  I may be an old man, but I didn’t lose my agility from age, oh no, it was them woods.”<br>
“Well sir, I do not know how you got it, maybe you stole it from one of your victims, and added it to your ‘appearance’ so you can infiltrate places better, I know I would do that.”<br>
“Boy! Do not speak with such stupidity!  I got this cane because of those woods.  There’s things in those woods so horrid they send chills down the spine of the bravest of brave men with the largest following backing them.  Things even 70 strong men could not handle.  To have survived with just this cane as my reminder, I thank Bristlebane for, but to have this cane to remind me of my failure hurts my pride every time I glance at it.”<br>
“I do not mean to be rude sir, but are you saying that no man could make it through those woods, because you couldn’t?  You claim to be a rogue, I can see your battle scars which elude to this being true.  Perhaps you would like to make a little wager.”<br>
“BAH! You’re a foolish boy!”<br>
“Sir, I may be respectful to you, be it merely out of moral reasoning, for I respect my elders, but I am the farthest one can get from foolish, and take offense to being called foolish” I spoke these words carefully as I tightened my grip on my spear.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “If you must act like this, then speak on, what do you place upon the table?”<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “For starters, being a wood elf, I must contradict my trades beliefs, and be moral.  Which is why I propose at not possible lose to you, to return the head of your target to you so you can retire with some pride left over.  If I fail, you’ll never see me again.  But, uh, the price of the head would be 600 plat.”<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp The old man choked on his beer.  “ You twearp!  Do you even know the price of that man’s head is?  Just 300 plat!  You’d be taking the spoils. No way would I agree to that.”<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “Oh, but the way I see it you can die a bitter old man, or live a nice life in retirement with respect amongst your peers, sure you’d lose money, but you could still have your pride.  Well, never mind, who was it that sent you on this job, oh yes, Texh Fedor, I guess I will give him the head and claim the 300 plat.”<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “You measly little, fine, you win, I shall laugh at your funeral, be warned, my friends are numerous.” <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “So are mine old man, so are mine,” I said with the biggest grin I could muster.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp The memory invigorated me; nothing like screwing an old man out of 300 plat can make a rogue any happier.  I grinned again at how I placed the man in the worst predicament ever.  The man couldn’t make the trip anymore to do the job.  If I did complete the job, I could claim the bounty and make him look like a wimpy never has, or I could sell it to him, he would keep his reputation, and I would be 300 plat richer than I would if I claimed the bounty.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp I continued my walk along the trail, slowly and with precise steps.  I trudged up the trail, leaving deep footsteps in the muddy trail.  The rain began to fall harder, I could only tell because of the size of drops grew, common to the increase of water being filtered by the tree branches.  The larger raindrops splattered nosily on the mud of the trail, with a continuous noise almost symphonic.  My heart rate began to quicken; something was near me, watching my moves, but what?  I crouched down, and began searching the landscape for a set of eyes.  Looking forward for a long while my eyes adjusted to the stillness of the woods, I could see the crow about 700 meters away in the upper most branches of a tall sturdy pine.  I dismissed it from the possible suspects, and continued to study the woods, while listening intently.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Then I heard it, a quiet squashing noise, off to my left.  I turned my head to the direction, and waited for the next movement.  I had to wait awhile, but it did come, and I was glad almost, but angry as well.  Approximately 1000 meters away, an undead creature of some type unknown to me, hid behind a tree, it’s raggedy clothing and toe, or what was left of it’s toe, exposed to my view.  He was silently stalking me.  I pulled out my map and compass and began to chart my location within the woods, while keeping the creature in the corner of my eye.  I determined my options, I could run for it, and risk getting the attention of more of these undead creatures or I could kill this one and hope no others come to aid it, or I could ignore it.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Then an idea popped in my head.  I pulled out a mirror from my satchel, and began walking, keeping the mirror with an image of the creature.  I was right; he walk was the same as those I had previously fought in my travels.  He walked with the legs of a corpse, stiff and bow-legged, there would be no way he could out run me if I ran for it.  I also had to assume there where others like him and I couldn’t risk them seeing him chasing me.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp I finally made my decision.  I quickly raised my spear into a ready position, spun on my heels, and made a bluff charge towards the creature.  The creature stood like a man caught with his pants down in an opera house as I ran towards him.  My heart began racing me legs to reach the creature, or so it seemed as it pounded in my chest.  The old man was right, I realized, when a chill went down my spine as I thought about what I would do it the creature wanted to fight and not run.  But my fears were unneeded, as the creature turn and ran in panic. Being a rogue I wanted to make sure he didn’t want to follow me anymore and raised me spear up high.  I gripped my spear with both hands and plunged the spear down into the back of the creature as hard as I could.  The creature groaned in agony as it fell towards the ground.  It’s shoulder rammed into the ground and I could hear the sound of snapping bones as the creature groaned again.  I realized I could end this madness now, and again raised my spear high, grabbed it with both hands, and slammed it down into the back of the creatures head.  The skull gave way like butter, and a mass of black slimy substance splattered from the splintered skull.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp I let out a deep sigh, for now I had to make sure I didn’t get a bit of the black substance on any part of me, and also clean my spear.  I sat down and began to set about my task, slowing checking every inch.  Finally satisfied I was clean; I drove me spear into a mud puddle and moved it around in the mud.  I continued until I decided it was clean enough so that an animal could not smell the decaying mass on my spear.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp My plan had failed, but that didn’t matter, the creature was dead now and couldn’t bother me now.  Something unnerved me though, how had this creature seen me, and why was it following me, on obviously superior being.  I shook my head free of my concerns, and again, trudged onward.  Again, I left deep, yet precise footsteps in the mud.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
After another hour of my tediously slow walking, I approached the likes of which I had never seen before.  The path lead to a steep hill, with jagged rocks sticking out here and there, with no set pattern.  The hill it’s self appeared to be about 400 meters to the top.  The hill by its self wasn’t unusual, but rather what seemed to be a cave entrance, is what struck me as odd.  It was carved, it would seem, from the solid rock held within the hillside.  Overall, the hill seemed to possess a magical aura.<br>
I tip toed up to the hole, ever so cautious, I’d heard of men who had foolishly walked up to caves and gotten their heads ripped off, and wasn’t going to chance it.  Ever so carefully, I slide my eyes closer to the cave.  Finally I could see down the cave, and felt foolish, there was nothing dangerous there, not even a cobweb, which I thought to be odd.  Upon further inspection, I noticed, this cave was used very often, as if it was a path to some place.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp I crouched back, and sat down.  This must be the way to the town, I thought, as I pulled out a text to refer to quickly.  I looked over the tabs I placed throughout the book, and choose the one I was looking for.  Ah, yes, here it was…”upon a hill lies the entrance to the fair city of the Little Folk, the hill is tall in the standards of the Little Folk, but more of an obstacle to other races.  The entrance it self is nothing spectacular, just a cave. But if you inspect it further you can see how carefully it was sculpted out of the earth…”<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Well, the only thing left to do was to walk through.  I stood up, stepped into the cave, and then remembered something.  If I was going to be seen, I better not look like a hideous freak of nature.  I removed my cloak, my chain mail vest, and the cap.  I then took out my fancy vest that a girl from Fionia Vie gave to me once, after, well…  I grinned at myself, put some hair gel in my hair, then put on my sunglasses.  Satisfied with my appearance, I walked onwards.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp The cave had a serious problem with it, there was a crack running the length of it, as if the stress from the weight was winning over the strength of the cave ceiling.  That wasn’t my problem though.  All I had to do now was find the guy, kill him and take the head back to the old man.  Hopefully the guy will be easy to find my girl from back home in Kelethin was expecting me home soon.  I put my thoughts to rest as I began to exit the cave.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp What wonders beheld my eyes left me in complete awe, until one of the little hobbits spoke to me.  Still amazed at what I saw, I didn’t reply, which made the hobbit gaze at me as if to say “well?”<br>
 After spitting out what were attempts of words, I finally fell upon a word that my mouth could form.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “Ahja, beha, ahh, Howdy!”<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “What might we be searching for, now?” the hobbit questioned me.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “Err, hmmm, bar?”<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “Ah, we gots us one of those!  Finest in the land some say, course better watch ya pockets in there, some of the quickest fingers dwell in that place.  But the ale, ahh the ale is the best surely!”  The hobbit explained to me.  “Say, why don’t have pick up ya jaw off the ground before me scare crow rip it off ya head, and follow me?”<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp The hobbit was referring to which I was amazed at, for before me stood a scarecrow.  What was different from another scarecrow was this one was walking about a small little patch of a garden.  “Errr, are you sure?  I could wander around this place until I find it, I wouldn’t want to take you away from your daily duties.”  I told the hobbit trying to get away from his attention.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “Why yes I am sure!  Its not often strangers other than druids wander into this town, and gudoos to the hobbit which finds that stranger first and bares him to the town!”<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “Well if you insist.” I said with the cheesest grin.<br>
True to what he said, the hobbit paraded me in front of the town’s people, while on the way to the bar.  This was quiet different from what I had planned to do, but being the rogue that I am, I played it to my advantage.  I took in the face of ever hobbit I saw, searching for my target.  I began to notice that these hobbits had many different types among them.  Some taller than the rest, and stout, which seemed to be farmers, others shorter than the rest, and wielding swords and shields, so I assumed the local militia.  Going by city hall, I became under the scrutiny of many druids, some that I had seen back in the Commonlands.  This made me only grin.<br>
Now my hobbit guide lead me towards the tallest building in the town, which read “Fool’s Gold”.  This I assumed to be the local, bar and inn.  It appeared to be in need of a fresh coat of paint, but who was I to tell a owner that he needed to fix his place up a bit, then ask, “oh can I get a room?” it just wasn’t my place in life.  The door stood ajar, which a tarnished spittoon held open.<br>
“This be the place my new found friend, may you find it suitable to your drinking needs, the owner’s name is Gibbon, if you need anything from him, just ask, he is the only hobbit in this place who doesn’t tell the tales of other men.” The hobbit assured me.<br>
“Thank you good Sir, may Tunare bring flourishing crops to your field.” I said with a smile to the hobbit.<br>
“Aye!” he replied as he wandered off to probably tell his friends more about how I had gotten here.<br>
I now used my rogue skills to slide into the bar quietly.  As I stepped into the bar, a musty, stale air hit me like a bag of doorknobs to the nose.  A dark figure far across the bar then noticed me as I sniffed the air.  Not wanting to draw attention to me, I stopped trying to be sneaky and walked over to the stool next to the figure.  As I sat at the bar table, I eyed the room about me.  In the middle of the room, four hobbits sat about a table near the fire.  They seemed to be enjoying their ale and story telling, which large outbursts of laughter now and then.<br>
I now spoke to the figure. “You notice me while I sneak, not only is the unusual, but odd in a place like this, what shall I call this town anyway?”<br>
“Ah, the question of the ages, River Vale is its name, and any rogue notices the work of another brother, especially in the home of rogues.”<br>
“So it is true what I heard, many quick hands dwell in this place?”<br>
“Aye, if that is what you wish to call them, I would prefer unseen hands though, for that describes them better.”<br>
“Why the garb, this seems like the safest of towns, safe enough to not hide in the darkest corner of the town with the darkest clothing, even when in fear of life and limb.”<br>
The figure turned away from me, as if in fear.  Unknown to him, I had recognized him.  What luck had I, to wander into the pub first off and to find my target.  Since he had no other words to tell me, I stood up, and walked over to the owner.  The owner was a short fat little hobbit, with the hairiest feet I had ever seen, truly in need of shaving.  I exchanged a few words with him, and platinum, and ended up with a room for a couple of nights.  He handed me a key, and I strode up to my room.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp The room was simple, a small window, a wooden table, a chest, and a bed.  On the table there was a key for the chest, which I quickly took, and unlocked the chest.  Then I grabbed a candle from my bag, placed it on the table.  A swift breeze blew in through the window, and lapped at my hair, and I smelled the crisp cool smell of rain in the air.  I leaned out the windows, and was about to pull the shutters closed when below me out walked a hooded hobbit, which continually glanced about him as he walked away from the inn.  I grinned happily to myself and closed the shutters to the window, seconds before a rain began to drizzle on the town.<br>
What luck I had, Bristlebane truly takes care of his favorite rogues, I thought to myself as I lay on the bed for a bit of rest.  I made plans in my mind for the money I was to earn from this.  After nightfall and the town had closed, I would sneak in, find out where my hobbit lived, sneak into his house, remove his second favorite body part, and make for the Commonlands during the night.  With even more good luck, I would be back in Freeport with the head by noon tomorrow, with 600 platinum burning a hole in my coin sac, while heading over to turn in the head for an additional 300 platinum.  The old man wouldn’t have a clue before it was too late and he himself was lost before my spear.  I sighed to myself in complete bliss and I dozed off into a dream.<br>
