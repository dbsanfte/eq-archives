Currently, I'm working on a fairly detailed battle plan for Vox (though I wanted to to Naggy first, I have better research currently on Vox strategies).<br>
<br>
For those of you that want to attend this, a few notes:<br>
<br>
You won't be able to engage Vox or heal those engaged with Vox during the battle if you are level 53 or higher. This, BTW, does not mean that you shouldn't show - you can buff us ahead of time (casters), help with rezzes afterwards (clerics), and even participate in battle by keeping stray mobs away and even possibly do the killing blow for us (you will be dumped out of zone, but the blow often still lands).<br>
<br>
With this in mind:<br>
<br>
If you are almost 53 come the end of October timeframe, consider spending some xp in AA points if you want to be able to directly participate in these raids (after you ding, it's too late).<br>
On the low end try and get to NO LESS THAN 45. HIGHER IS BETTER.<br>
We will not have enough 45-52 peeps, so I will definitely be inviting our allies plus at least one more guild (most likely Belain and/or Easy Riders).<br>
The tentative dates at the moment are October 26th for Vox and two weeks latter for Naggy.<br>
<br>
Loot rules will be out with the full raid plans in about a week or so.<br>
<br>

<br>
High level group for killing the FGs/IGs and other nasty things in the way plus buffs.<br>
<br>
Buffs usually go, 4 crap buffs (pr, dr, cr/fr, see invis), shaman buffs (stam, hos), cleric buffs (aego or hero/ac), chanter buffs (clarity/speed), mr and cr/fr.  Everyone camps as soon as they have all of their buffs and are full mana, logs in an alt and joins the raid channel.  Once everyone has buffs, they log back on.<br>
<br>
Main tank group consisting of a main tank (lvl 52 warrior with the highest possible ac/hps/mr/cr/fr), one bard, one cleric and 3 pallies.  This group goes in first before all others and the main tank starts attacking first.  The paladins take turns using LoH on the main tank so that he does not have to run to clerics for a heal.  They pull the dragon to the back of the lair.  Clerics and casters stay near the bridge/door.  When melees get to 50 percent, they turn off attacks, wait to loose agro if they have it and back slowly to the clerics.  If they have agro and cannot loose it, they stand and die.<br>
<br>
No one is allowed to sit, hehe.  A lot of people on these dragon raids have no clue what they are doing, so be as specific as possible when handing out instructions.  You have to be in melee range in order to land spells.  Make sure casters know that.<br>
<br>
If you are 53+, you will be banished as soon as you are in sight of naggy/vox.  The only exception is if someone else is above you on their agro list.  For corpse runs in the lair, just have a 53+ monk or rogue go in with sneak.  They will not see you if you are not directly in front of them.   If they do see you, you will just get banished instead of dieing.  Having a 55+ mage is good for CoH to get him back from the zone line to the prep room easier.<br>
<br>
High level clerics can help out greatly by running in with the main group and getting off one complete heal before being banished.  If they bind in the prep room before the raid, they can then gate back and get off another few heals.  I did this for vox and it was pretty fun.  By the time I ran in for the 3rd time, all the tanks were dead, hehe.  As long as you do not attack or cast, you will not be banished if there are people in the room under 53.  Might be a good idea to have a shaman go in just after the main group and attempt to slow.  One of my friends had an idea to have a few mana burning wizzies to see if they could kill vox, but it wouldn't work unless you had someone under 53 tanking the dragon first.  Pretty much any caster over 52 can go in and help out to some extent.  Melees just can't stay in the room long enough to cause any real damage.<br>
<br>
A lot of naggy/vox raids will lower the level limit for clerics to 39 because we get complete heal at 39.  This is NOT a good idea.  All casters should be just as high as the melees.  Why?  AE fear is a pain.  Resisting it depends a lot on your level.  At 52+, I almost always resist it from naggy and vox and I have the same MR I had when I was 40ish and on these raids.  Lower level clerics will just get feared and not be able to cast anything or worse fall into the pits.  I was on one vox raid where I was pretty much the only cleric.  There were 3 in the beginning, but one left just before the raid started.  I was lvl 52 and the other one was 42.  I saw the 42 cleric run out feared in the beginning and never saw him again.  That left only the druids and me.  We were lucky to win that time.<br>
<br>
Have someone that knows the way mark it with dropped items like summoned food for vox.  If you loose most of your raid force because they fall into pits, you will fail.  Also, when pulling the terrors, make sure people are not inbetween the terror and the ramp.  They blow you across the room if you have agro and I have seen people knocked up the wrong ramp and into pit.<br>
<br>
For vox, mana sieve is nice, but not completely necessary.  Have everyone carry a shield if not a large race and use bash.  You can switch out weapons once bash pops up if you have good hotkeys.  Also, chain cast stuns on her.  She is immune to the stun effect (does not stop her from hitting), but it will interrupt her spells.<br>

<br>
This agrees with much of my research so far. The pathing issue is a major concern to be because of the pits. I don't know what's at the bottom of the pits for Naggy, but for Vox the answer is pretty simple - you fall in a pit, then just take your lumps (and your death). We'll get to the rez when the mob is dead.<br>
<br>
I'm hoping to have at least one other bard there for resists. I will go in with the MA group for that reason. I will be defering the attack calls to someone else - ideally someone who has done a raid of the mob in question before.<br>
<br>
Again, a full plan will be along in the next week. This will likely be the most detailed raid plan most of the guild has ever seen... <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  Basically, I'm doing everything in my power to insure success for the group, so expect detailed roles of every class, group, and level, plus specific timings of attacks, etc., etc., etc.. This will be the master plan, but it will, of course, be adapted for who exactly shows up.<br>
<br>
These two raids will be something of a warm up. Sometime a little beyond these two raids we'll have a multi-guild raid on a special version of a 65 mob. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000028><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub135.ezboard.com/ucobokelvar.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Cobo Kelvar</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 487<br> <font color=#A8A8A8>(9/26/02 2:13:04 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub135.ezboard.com/fexodusfellowshipforumfrm6.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=672.topic&index=3>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.webdesignbyursula.com/the_skulls.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: A little advance warning</span><hr size=1> Hmmmm.<br>

As Ursi has said, it will be a long time before EF raids a 65 mob. I have to agree if we're talking a EF only raid.

VOX seems much harder because of her CH, she's a cleric. Dragon FEAR and dispells are BAD. Some GOOD tips are BARD songs first because they refresh, hopefully if the BARD's not FEARED and running off. They will save you on some debuffs not all though.<br>
<br>
BARD haste song<br>
BARD resist song<br>
ultravision<br>
resist poison<br>
resist disease<br>
beauty buff from a shammy or enchanter<br>
DEX buff<br>
HASTE buff enchanter or shammy<br>
STA buff<br>
Talisman of Kragg 350 HPS buff<br>
circle of seasons fire and cold resist<br>
group magic resist<br>
C3<br>
AEGO, 1100 HPS buff don't lose this one<br>
one open slot for a cleric heal, U might need it, remember you can only have 15 buffs and dragon FEAR will take one away. There's other buffs you can use as well, just take what you can get. REMEMBER AEGO should be your last buff guard it well. 13 CRAP buffs then AEGO, everyone in the group must remember this, its the most important buff of all, you lose it you will most surely DIE. I did call you surely.<br>
<br>
Warriors if you got a instant click buff item use it. It will save your buffs. One GOOD thing to remember if your not moving and you get FEARED you won't run off CRAZY like. If you at 50% LIFE get out dragons go after LOW health TOONS, clerics are healing the MT mostly, give them a break and save your LIFE as well. Let the MAIN TANK call for the ALL ATTACK and for when CASTERS and DOTTERS start to do thier thing. DOTTERS are GOOD at like 80% LIFE, they shouldn't get AGRRO. CASTERS is more like 50% to 40% LIFE by then a few TANKS might be down.<br>
<br>
Also some GOOD spells to have on MAIN TANK are the magician's DS, it does damage and gives fire resist too. The enchanter's 52 level spell Trickerster's Augmentation, it gives 15 fire resist and procs a 70 point damage and adds AGGRO to make NAGGY or VOX MAD. Also Boon of the Garou would be GOOD on VOX RAIDS, it procs a 28 life drain or more depending on the level and if a warrior has a TOD to SLOW VOX or NAGGY down his AGGRO will be complete, if he SLOWS them down WOOT, WTG. TASH might HELP the warrior with a TOD to SLOW them down but do it at like 80% LIFE, watch that AGGRO. Enchanter's TASH will do WONDERS for enchanter's lifespans if done to early(I know this from EXP).<br>

LOOT is the HARD part everyone wants something, a scale, cloak of flames, something. Let the RAID LEADER decide who rolls for what and what TOONS can use the item. Everyone should know the RAID LEADER hands the LOOT out before going in. If the RAID LEADER is DEAD you wait for the REZ. RAID LEADER is a TUFF and RUFF job and with multiple GUILDS even worse. OH and please take care of the cleric that gives you AEGO its not cheap for AEGOing 30 to 40 TOONS, remember they came to HELP and should be repaid for thier kindness in willing to come and HELP out.<br>
<br>
MAIN POINT is to have FUN and KILL the MOB be it NAGGY or VOX. Also use the channel system for the RAID it works wonders if a cleric is feared have another cleric up and HEAL the MT, its a LIFESAVER some times, it might even be a druid with a HEAL whoever can SAVE the MT do it. He's the STRONG POINT you keep him alive and AGGRO on him and you will most likey WIN the day.<br>
