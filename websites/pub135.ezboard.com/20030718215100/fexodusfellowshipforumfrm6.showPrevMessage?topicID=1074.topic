I downloaded the7 minute video and looked at all the screen shots ect ect.  it looks insane.  The engines and stuff they are useing to make this game look as close to life as possible are crazzy, many of witch have never been used by the gameing industy yet.  Even so the system requirements dont seem to be much worse than what they are now.  <br>
<br>
What are the game's requirements?<br>
Operating System: Windows 98/2000/ME/XP <br>
Processor: 733 mhz<br>
RAM: 512 MB<br>
Video Card: DirectX 8 compliant. Pixel shader and Vertex shader compatible hardware with 64mb of texture memory (eg: GeForce 3)<br>
Sound Card: DirectSound compatible audio hardware<br>
<br>
That being said will what i see be anything like what i see on the web page?  From the video i have downloaded and the pics i have seen it looks more like what we saw in the movie Final Fantasy than any game i have ever played.  Provided that is true, i dont see how my computer, witch far excedes the requirements for the new game will look anything like what ive been shown.  Does anyone have any imput as to what upgrades need to be made if any to make the game look as good as it can?  will actual game play look as good as they say it does?  <br>
        If you havent seen them yet, take a look.  before i looked i was one of those &quot; forget eqII and stick with EQI&quot;  but after looking at what ive seen i dont know if that will be the case.  <br>
what are your thoughts?<br>

Everyone will be starting from scratch.  It has some farmiliar things in it.  all the old places and as many more new.  There will be many more differant aspects to EQII that are not present in EQI.  Charactors will be defined later in the lvling rather than at the first of the game.  In other words  you grow your toon and weave his path as u see fit.  there will be another catigory of charactories set up as only tradeskill toons.  not designed to fight but just create stuff.  you will be able to have homes, anything from an apartment to a castle.  These places are 100% customizeable. bla bla bla.  I think there will still be a big fallowing in EQI because again it is a completely different game.  EQI will still be as we know it.  they will still upgrade it as often as they do now with expantions ect ect.  I will not see EQII be the death of this kick butt guild.  If i need to be the first person on EQII i will astablish EF as an extention of us.  This could be a great move for SOE or a really stupid one.  only time will tell.<br>

<br>
Mostly anyway....<br>
<br>
EQII will see several very predictable events, and several that are just guesses:<br>
<br>
1. EQII comes out, a very healthy number of people rush off to check it out. This is both a bummer because we will all have friends leave, but also cool because certain zones will become far less crowded.<br>
2. Within a week, you see some other friend leave because &quot;I have a RL friend that is playing EQII, and they say it is just too kewl!!!!&quot;. At the same time, some old friends start returning saying that it just wasn't for them for whatever reason.<br>
3. Over the course of the next 6 months, things begin to stablize on who's going and who's staying. The number of new players in EQ SHARPLY declines because those that don't know either game are don't have RL friends to steer them are going to assume that EQII is somehow better. Despite the stabilization, you continue to see some come back and some go away - just in lesser numbers. EQ slowly begins to fade, but it is a process that takes years rather than months, and has as much to do with there being more and more MMRPG choices rather than just EQII - more choices = people being spread across more games.<br>
<br>
What I don't agree with is the expansion pack thing. I think that we'll continue to see expansions, and I think that we're almost certain to see the old world rework that has been rumored for a while. I just don't think we'll see expansions at quite the same rate.<br>
<br>
As to your system Mac: No, you're not going to see that level of detail on your system. They are using the not quite yet release GeoForceFX to drive those graphics, and the FX is a MAJOR leap in graphics technologie for shaders/pixelators, etc.. You're going to see great graphics no doubt (have you looked at the new Frogluk graphics yet?), but it won't be the kind of texturing you're seeing in the EQII clips.<br>

A newer chip to drive it should be out in March sometime, and probably won't really hit the streets until April - that will be the one you want.<br>

EQ simply will not sunset for years after EQII is released. Simply - I don't think the return on investment for POP and Ykesha development is going to go into the black anytime soon, but the reality is that two EQs are better than one, and they will both be healthy revenue streams - I'm sure many people will play both, all the time. Software doesn't just shut off.<br>

<br>
I am actually excited about both games, but certainly don't look forward to losing the friendships and camaraderie we all now share.  I have even been wondering if we could carry the guild over to include other games (can you say Exodus Alliance anyone?). <br>
<br>
SWG will be EQ set in the Star Wars universe and folks will be able to be anything from a mercenary to a Jedi.  It's made by many of the folks that developed EQ.  I sure would like to see SOE offer subscribers who want to play both, a deal on the monthly charges.  I mean, how many games can people afford?  And now SOE seems to be competing with itself!<br>
<br>
From what I hear EQ2 will be different in some other ways as well.  I believe they intend to go back to the original 3 continents and they will be much bigger.  Traveling across the lands will cover huge expanses and bank items will not transfer.  So people may have to set up some kind of convoys to safely carry their belongings from place to place, if they intend on changing their home base.  Horse will be more prevalent and homes to keep all your stuff in may also be available.  Though it scares me to think how much they will cost!<br>
<br>
If these things indeed are still planned, it should prove to be a bit of a different game and I think I may welcome some of the changes.  Some of you may think I'm crazy, but I think the ease that we can all travel to the farthest reaches of Norrath and Luclin is a mixed blessing.  The world may have many more places to visit, but it just doesn't seem that big anymore.  I remember my first boat ride and how excited I was to see a new land (even if it was Erudian!)  The first time I made it to Rivervale from Qeynos under my own power seemed like quite an accomplishment to me (there were a couple of failed attempts, but I had a great desire to see the land of the Halflings!).  I then moved onto Freeport and that city eventually became my new home.  <br>
<br>
Now, I think travel is just too easy.  I would wager that there are players in their 40's and beyond who do not even know how to get from Qeynos to Freeport without some kind of a teleport.  I know, who needs to waste all that time traveling, right?  There's leveling to be doin!   As I say, to me its a mixed blessing, the world used to seem much more immerse to me.<br>
<br>
Anyway, that's probably one of the reasons I will welcome EQ2.  I also can't wait to see the new graphics in operation.  I recently checked out the beta of Asheron's Call 2 and you could see reflections in the water.  It was pretty sweet.  I hope EQ2 will be able to accomplish that, and more.<br>
<br>
But for now, I think we need to get the most out of our time together.  Let's have as much fun as we can.  Maybe a bunch of us will move on at some point... maybe we'll move on together...  Maybe we'll form The Exodus Fellowship Part Deux with Hiking as our leader!  Who knows what the future will bring.  But, if we have a desire to, we will find a way to stick together.<br>
