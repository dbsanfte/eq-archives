I had done a little enquirment and had heard that 48 was too low to get a group there, but, as a bard, that it would probably happen anyway.  So, I do an almost laughing shout of &quot;48 Bard LFG&quot;, and turn on the lfg sign. No replies - no surprises. lol.<br>
<br>
So, I slide over to the other side of the graveyard and ask if that group minds if I just sit and watch. np comes the reply from two of them, so I watch for just a bit. Sunddenly comes a toon turing around and looking at me twice, and, yep, in comes the invite. I politly thank them for taking on a charity case, and the fun begins. The drops STUNK for the mobs we were pulling (gnarled treants, vunerable spiders and blackbirds). I was the low toon at about 8 levels below the next lowest, and with two over 60. xp would be classified as &quot;good&quot;, and would almost certainly have been &quot;GREAT&quot; for someone in the low to mid 50's, and not bad beyond that. The occasional bat was blue to me, and everything else was red.<br>
<br>
The aggro was the most interesting thing. I was definitely getting some level related aggro when meleeing. I was, however, only in danger about 3 times and never died. Image Sing's surprise however when he took his first ever quad at about 250-350 a pop - OUCH. Got hit once for 425 or  so. Most of the time, aggro was very managable, and I actually did contribute to the group - successfully backing up roles in all sorts of different ways - was easily the most challenge I've seen as a bard in a very, very long time. Mana, resists, cantana, DoT, haste, slow/snare (mine's combined) - they all showed up mixed in quite frequently last night. WOW. This and melee too much of the time. FUN TIMES.<br>
<br>
Couple of notes: A 48 bard is underpowered there, but I would almost agree with the assertion that I've heard that a bard is about the only thing likely to get picked up in the planes at 48. The versitility and the mana were the reasons I got invited (that and just plain mercy case). Personally, I'd say low 50's minimum for most classes, and 55+ minimum for true tanks (heavy aggro folks). I can see rangers and moks doing fine there a few levels sooner. Clerics would probably get picked up if they are high enough to get there (46+) - 49+ almost for sure I would think.<br>

<br>
Nobody wants a 90% rez.  And I dont like recruiting any class under 55.<br>
<br>
The cleric's rez is their strongest asset - shammys/chanties are the most in demand with their incredible slows then probably bards.  I am reluctant to recruit chanties under 59 - when their mez is resisted- the add will usually attack them or me if I have healed someone. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#00000F><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub135.ezboard.com/bexodusfellowshipforum.showUserPublicProfile?gid=singsang>SingSang</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 989<br> <font color=#A8A8A8>(11/15/02 2:31 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub135.ezboard.com/fexodusfellowshipforumfrm3.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=24.topic&index=2>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.exodusfellowship.com/Sing-B.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Fun in PoN</span><hr size=1> Hmmm. Good info as always.<br>
<br>
Indeed my slows (my combined slow/snare) was landing on most mobs most of the time. It was seriously invaluable when our Shammy LD'd once, then was OOM, then had to log. The haste was critical when the chanty LD'd and didn't come back. You get the drift - I was a busy bard.<br>
<br>
I was basically kidding when I went LFG, and was pretty surprised to see the invite. Felt bad for those first several minutes while I was trying to feel my way through what was working for me. Was good times in the end tho.<br>
<br>
My closest call with death came on a major overpull from our tank. It was his first trip to the planes also, and he grabbed two trees and one of those super killer blackbirds at once. We were getting some major slicing and dicing, then an add, and our 61 chanty was having problems getting it all under control. No evac, tho evac was called (doesn't work there perhaps?). Fortunately, we were already at graveyard, and most of us zoned easily. Two died, but at least one was because it was also her first time there, and she hadn't taken the time to find the zone out (I had first think). She died about 20 feet from it with no clue where it was. Oops.<br>
<br>
Like I said - good times though. Actually, some of the best group fun I've had in ages. Only other particularly fun group I've had recently was Atat, Perinn, Thallus and I in KC with a few comers and goers (including one that literally fell asleep at his keyboard, so we ultimately wound up disbanding him. He suddenly moved about 10 minutes later and was one seriously embarrased chanty - lol). <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000028><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub135.ezboard.com/bexodusfellowshipforum.showUserPublicProfile?gid=arathainkelvar>ArathainKelvar</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Guild Leader</span><br>  Posts: 640<br> <font color=#A8A8A8>(11/18/02 4:49 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub135.ezboard.com/fexodusfellowshipforumfrm3.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=24.topic&index=3>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.exodusfellowship.com/Arathain_small.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Fun in PoN</span><hr size=1> I had a lot of fun as main tank in PoN for a group of 2 clerics (thanks god, lol) including ursi, a 61 chanter, 60 mage, and 61 necro.  As was my first time up there, I pulled what looked like a good target, which turned out to be a druid mob (fish thing).  Was dead before I got back to camp.  Tough zone, but I do believe some lower levels could help if the rest of the group is pretty well balanced and relatively high level. <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top"> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub135.ezboard.com/fexodusfellowshipforumfrm3.showPrevMessage?topicID=24.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub135.ezboard.com/fexodusfellowshipforumfrm3.showNextMessage?topicID=24.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a self href=http://pub135.ezboard.com/fexodusfellowshipforumfrm3.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=24.topic&index=3><img src=http://www.exodusfellowship.com/add-_reply.jpg border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub135.ezboard.com/fexodusfellowshipforumfrm3.emailToFriend?topicID=24.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub135.ezboard.com/fexodusfellowshipforumfrm3.threadControl?topicID=24.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/black_default/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands</a><br> <a href=http://pub135.ezboard.com/fexodusfellowshipforumfrm3.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=24.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/ultimate/subscribe.gif width=20 height=20 border=0 alt="Click to receive email notification of replies"> Click to receive email notification of replies</a> <br>  <a href=http://pub135.ezboard.com/fexodusfellowshipforumfrm3.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=24.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/ultimate/unsubscribe.gif width=20 height=20 border=0 alt="Click to stop receiving email notification of replies"> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies</a> <br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub135.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="exodusfellowshipforumfrm6">The Grand Hall<option value="exodusfellowshipforumfrm5">Event Planning<option value="exodusfellowshipforumfrm3">Tales of the Fellowship!<option value="exodusfellowshipforumfrm10">Epic Quests<option value="exodusfellowshipforumfrm4">Exodus Classifieds<option value="exodusfellowshipforumfrm8">The Vault<option value="exodusfellowshipforumfrm13">Tradeskiller's Anonymous<option value="exodusfellowshipforumfrm11">Out of Character<option value="exodusfellowshipforumfrm12">Applications<option value="exodusfellowshipforumfrm7">The High Council Chambers<option value="exodusfellowshipforumfrm9">Officers Lounge<option value="exodusfellowshipforumfrm14">Fellowship Lodgings</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#A8A8A8>- </font><a href=http://pub135.ezboard.com/bexodusfellowshipforum>Exodus Fellowship Forum</a><font color=#A8A8A8> - </font><a href=http://pub135.ezboard.com/fexodusfellowshipforumfrm3>Tales of the Fellowship!</a> <font color=#A8A8A8> - </font><a href="http://www.exodusfellowship.com">The Exodus Fellowship</a><font color=#A8A8A8> - </font><br><br>  <br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 7.245d<br>Copyright ©1999-2003 ezboard, Inc.</center></body></html>
