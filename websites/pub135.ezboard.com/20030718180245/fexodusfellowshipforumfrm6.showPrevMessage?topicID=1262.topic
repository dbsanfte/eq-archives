<br>
Here are my suggestions for melees on how to not break mez unless they are designated to do so. Please feel free to add any tips. <br>
<br>
1. Find out who the MT (main tank) or MA (main assist) is and make an assist key. <br>
<br>
2. Find out who the SA (secondary assist) is and make an assist key. This is in case you have to split tank mobs or MT goes down.<br>
<br>
3. Turn off auto attack, /attack off. I see this breaking mez more than any other single factor. If mez is broken before MT has aggro from taunting, guess who gets smacked? <br>
<br>
4. Let the MT engage, break mez and cement aggro. After mez is broken, I usually let the MT smack away for a couple of seconds to help the aggro, lol. That way only one peep needs to be healed from melee dmg. If I steal aggro, I stop attacking, fd in my case, to let MT reestablish. <br>
<br>
5. Hit the assist several times during battles with multiple targets. There are times when the MT will change targets. As support, you have to be on your toes when it happens and trying to figure it out only by looking or clicking is not going to work very well. <br>
<br>
Other tips - <br>
<br>
1. Pay attention to mob positioning. Do not shove mobs over ledges or railings or through walls or doors. They aggro more mobs and you know the rest. Stop attacking and reposition. This works best if MT calls it, but called or not, don't be a party to the offense and let the MT know they need to call it. <br>
<br>
2. Watch for enrage. If you see a mob enrage or see it announced, be sure you are behind the mob or move behind the mob. If you can not get behind or to the side, you will need to assess the situation as to whether you keep attacking or stop and let others finish it. You can take alot of damage and die from an enraged mob very quickly since they riposte on every hit. <br>
<br>
<br>
Breaking mez at lower level encounters is not a big deal, especially with c3 on board and a zone close by. This makes it easy to instill poor melee habits with few consequences. But at higher level encounters, those poor habits will have disastrous effects on you and your party/raid. <br>
<br>
Everyone makes mistakes. Battles in tight quarters with lots of mobs breathin on ya can be confusing to us who are int challenged. Practice the above simple steps and you will make far fewer of them.  <br>
<br>
Be safe. <br>

<br>
A few things I'd add:<br>
<!--EZCODE LIST START--><ul><li>You can assist by simply doing a &quot;/assist &lt;name&gt;&quot;. You do not have to target first. I've seen some folks say to use /target and then /assist - this works just fine, but you'll find it to be just slightly slower in getting the final target due to the separate commands. This usually isn't an issue, but I've seen it take a second or two in laggy situations.</li><li>Keep an assist key available that is NOT pretargeted to anyone in particular. You will find times in raids where your MA goes down and, for whatever reason, your SA is not the person to assist either. In such a case, you need to be ready to adjust quickly. This is a &quot;last resort&quot; kind of thing though.</li><li>Some things CAN be done to a mezzed mob without breaking mezz. As such, you'll find that your MA may turn and face a target, target it, but just stand there for a bit letting the mezzed mob sit for a moment. The MA may well be just stretching their fingers after mashing taunt so many times, but more likely they are waiting for the mob to be occluded, slowed, snared, tashed, malo'd or whatever - not to mention giving a large raid force time to catch up with them on targeting. This is why setting your assist to off (use &quot;/assist off&quot; )  is very important.</li><li>Most of the time a slight pause before joining the MA's attack is sufficient. If it's a dicey raid where you want to be more certain, have the MA set up a hot key that says something like &quot;You may now help a %t meet it's end&quot; or whatever - under this plan, folks should not attack until they see the message. Now, that said, keep your wits about you. Sometimes the MA will start and then receive a tell or just see something that distracts them and forget to send the message. Give them plenty of time to give the message, but if you find yourself 20 or 30 seconds in and no message, then, by all means, attack away unless you've been specifically told not too.</li><li>Unless your the MA, turn off any taunts you might have. I know a lot of melee combine their taunt in with another key (such as kick) - don't forget to remove that.</li><li>As Mnim indicated, don't be afraid to back up just a tad and to stop attacking if you grab unplanned aggro. Many non-warriors have aggro reducers available too (bards have a unresistable song for it, plus there are some aggro reducing weapons available. Rangers and SK's have spells, monks FD - I don't know whether Pally's have anything in that camp or not).</li></ul><!--EZCODE LIST END--><br>

Work on this stuff even in your simpler fights/raids. Tease each other mercilessly about it - it builds both character and skills. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :lol --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/laugh.gif ALT=":lol"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub135.ezboard.com/bexodusfellowshipforum.showUserPublicProfile?gid=singsang>SingSang</A> at: 4/14/03 5:47:59 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#00000F><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub135.ezboard.com/bexodusfellowshipforum.showUserPublicProfile?gid=thearrowolfs>The Arrowolfs</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 61<br> <font color=#A8A8A8>(4/14/03 12:32 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub135.ezboard.com/fexodusfellowshipforumfrm6.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1266.topic&index=2>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: class discussion - melee (mez)</span><hr size=1> Okay, I've been waiting for this to come up from melees.<br>
<br>
Something was wrong with mez in Chardok on Saturday.<br>
<br>
Idylla broke mez three times nuking.  This is how I play her nukes.<br>
<br>
Each time I was using a Single Target, DD fire based spell called Char.  I use this spell in raids because it is not a line of sight. (I've cast it on a mob when my back was to it tho not in Chardok on Sat.)  Each time I cast this spell it broke mez.  Casting my Magic based DOT did not break mez.<br>
<br>
1) The mob is at 80 PCT or less. On Saturday it was usually 50 or less because I had no pet after it broke mez earlier.<br>
<br>
2) Hit Escape key to clear target<br>
<br>
3) Hit MA Hot key. (auto combat is turned off)<br>
<br>
4) Cast spell.<br>
<br>
I have never broken mez using this spell before, but hadn't used it on a raid since the patch.<br>
<br>
Another reason mezzes were being broken could possibly be that Sindee/Enhmet was maybe changing targets all the time and I nuked the mob I assisted.  (Remember, my assist was fresh and the mob was below 80 PCT. The only delay was the cast time.)<br>
<br>
Also, pet broke mez once during the raid.  Pets can't break mez anymore, they see a mezzed mob as an illegal target.  There is a slight chance that pet had been casting on a mob it had on it's hate list prior to the mez and the cast finished after the mez, but general consensus with the mage chat channel is once again the patch.<br>
<br>
BTW, don't mod rod after rez til you have lost your rez affects, patch has bugged this and you can die no matter what your hp show.<br>

So maybe there is a bug or something in the join.  Also just to raise our spirits a bit more on our Chardok raid misfortune, MoS wiped out in the same exact fashion that we did.  MT fell in the trap, millions of mobs came pouring out, mega wipe.  Was a bit tied up atm so I didn't get to find out what thier clean up method was to stay down there but they were able to somehow stay in there for cleanup.  So sindee your flogging is postponed, for now. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   <p>Hail to the King!  -Ash</p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#00000F><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub135.ezboard.com/bexodusfellowshipforum.showUserPublicProfile?gid=djuna73>Djuna73</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 9<br> <font color=#A8A8A8>(4/14/03 1:24 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub135.ezboard.com/fexodusfellowshipforumfrm6.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1266.topic&index=4>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: class discussion - melee (mez)</span><hr size=1> A slight aside to this topic...<br>

It is good to see everyone offering up very good advise to make us better and stronger at raiding and tactics.  And doing it without casting blame is even nicer to see.  (especially since I was to blame for wipeing out the whole raid.)  LOL.<br>
<br>
From a tanks point of view we did great once we got rolling.  We held the library like the uber guild we are.  I think that Chard may be bugged, but follow the rules posted and things should go very smooth for the most part.  When I am MT/MA I try not to switch mobs once I am engaged.  I won't say that it never happens but it dosent very often.  I really can't think of any reason off the top of my head why I would switch mobs anyway.  Alot of times I will stand in front of the next mob for a few seconds before engage.  I am taunting the mob durring this time to try to get the argo before I break the mez.  Chanters like that when us tanks do that.  I taunt four times and then I will send out my inc message to let everyone know that I am engaging.<br>
<br>
For what its worth I think the Chardok raid went very well up untill the point I fell into the pit to meed the King.  He was not happy to see me.  LOL   Keep up the great work everyone and thanks for the beatdown at the party yesterday.<br>

I'm going with it being a pathing issue, which may be why pets and arrows break mez.  I know that arrows are bugged in more than one zone.  <br>
<br>
I also know for a fact that Rivin was not always shooting arrows when he broke mez and that he WAS using his assist key with combat turned off.  Hehe, I looked over his shoulder.<br>
<br>
My point is that we need to factor broken mezzes into our raids until VI decides to fix it.  We lose a lot of DPS if we don't have pets and ranger arrows.<br>
<br>
The point here is TEAMWORK.<br>

<br>
it is much faster, and easier for them to get your corpse than for them to rez 70% of the raid, less mana is involved, and more fire power is ALIVE still, you should have sacrificed yourself for the benifit of the raid. how is it faster and easier...Ash summons corpses, its his trade skill, he's sort of a necrophiliac., or you send a rogue in. If the clerics or other healers healed you, they should have zoned via gate /q or succor, when you fell, you should have been cutt off from the group and sacrificed or CoTH.<br>
<br>
Ultimatly, why was a CoTH mage not grouped with the MT/MA, sindee should have never had a chance to pull that train, and shouldn't have tried, she should have asked for CoTH and been grouped to begin with, with the mage...CoTH MAge, Cleric, MT/MA, should always be together.<br>
<br>
Secondly, from experience yesterday Griss expressed the same mez issue that Idylla is, while grouped witha  enchanter, her nukes broke mez on a mob that wasn't even effected....SOE made a boo boo...<br>
<br>
thirdly.. Sindee, when the wipe acured, you switched mobs, idylla stayed on the mob the raid was killing, when u returned with the train u were no longer on it, and were on a different target, Bad mojo! never switch mobs even when it or you dissapears, the only person who gets to switch mobs is the ST/SA(secondary tank/ Secondary Assist)<br>
<br>
Ultimatily, you guys need to keep your minds open to new methods, and always strive to work together, find out what the other classes have as abilities, and use them. IE...<br>
<br>
monks have FD, however it no longer clears agro, mages have CoTH which clears agro, solution, monk FD's, mages CoTH's, monk comes out alive <br>
<br>
warriors have alots of hp, bad pull, run your butt off away from the the raid while mage casts CoTH, see how big of a train you can make safely and laugh, CoTH clears agro when 200ft out of dungeon and 100ft in dungeon away from the mage<br>
<br>
Pull singles in a raid, if chanters aren't busy mezing they can give melee's speed, and nuke, and give clarity out.<br>
<br>
don't fear death, death always clears agro, and with 96% rez, you make up your exp loss by the next kill.<br>
<br>
Finaly...Djune for your question, you are correct in certain situations..a ranger with endless quiver and trueshot dis does the most DPS, period, sorry Cobo <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  so when the mob has no chance of being in the wall, step back and fire away, but keep in mind, arrows are line of sight so and npc that is between u and the mob has a strong chance to be hit by your arrow instead of your intended target.<br>
<br>

I am not usually one to defend myself but I feel that now is one time that I have to.  So here goes.<br>
<br>
You stated:   <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>i would have to ask you one question Sindee, i was watching during the wipe in chard, why on earth did you come back to the group when u fell down and got tons of mobs on you?</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
My answer:  I did not come back to the group after I fell in the pit.  For one thing I was dead in about 3 seconds, I died like a good warrior on the floor at the kings feet.  Secondly with all those mobs hitting I dont think I could have moved anyway being stunned every nano-second.  I have sacraficed myself many times for my friends and will continue to do so.  <br>
<br>
You Stated:    <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Sindee, when the wipe acured, you switched mobs, idylla stayed on the mob the raid was killing, when u returned with the train u were no longer on it, and were on a different target, Bad mojo!</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> <br>
<br>
My answer:  When the wipe occured I did not switch mobs. And I never returned with a train.  I was naked and in Shadow Haven at the time. As I said in my earlier post I do not switch mobs once I am engaged unless there is a very very very good reason to do so.  The whole time in Chardok that day I never once switched from a mob that I was engaged with period!  I may not know everything about being a MT but I do know some things and I did not just grow out of the Jum Jum patch in Rivervale.<br>
<br>
Some things went bad that day but alot of things went good as well.  I owned up to the fact that I blew it by falling in the pit and I learned from that expirence.  But dont blast me when 1. you werent there and 2. you have never hunted with me in the past so you dont know what I am capable or not capable of.<br>
<br>
Sorry to rant but I had to say what I was feeling.<br>

On another note, I saw exactly what happened in Chardok.  Sindee fell to the King, then a gazillion mobs came running right through the door...after the 'Sindee has been slain message'.  Not her fault, Khaba.  She did what she was supposed to be doing, and did it well.  We all learned and will do better next time.

<br>
When Sindee fell into the pit if she was healed by anyone they had agro - whether she lived or died.  When she died they rose to the top of the hate list.<br>
<br>
This happened on the raid we were on when Q got his epic piece in Chardok.  A 65 BL (wish I could recall his name) was in Karmyn's group while she was healer.  I popped a chloro on him after he fell into the pit. He knew what happened and immediately sent a tell to me to /q. We both died, but we were saved from the wipe till I believe the next pull when the rogue pulled the wrong mob. <br>
<br>
I guess hindsight being so clear, next time our MT trips and falls into the pit we need to come up with some form of communication.  I really wish you guys would let me try out CoTH; been itching to call the hero :<br>

<br>
1. Break Mez<br>
2. Aggro Mobs by proxity.<br>
<br>
If you saw either of these, then there was a bug.<br>
<br>
Also, just something to temper what you saw: Just because you say a &quot;has broken mezz&quot; message doesn't mecessarily mean that the person named actually broke mezz. You can get that message also if you are beating on a mob that's had certain stuns cast on it (not necessarily for the purpose of mezzing).<br>
<br>
I freaked when I had that message show up on me twice in a row the last time I was in Chardok on Royals, but I was later reassured that I just happened to be the lucky winner of the &quot;who struck next&quot; contest after one of the chanters stunned the mob to interrupt their casting.<br>
<br>
Oh, and on the recovery without summoning? They probably had a cleric camped out either before the wipeout pull or perhaps successfully camped during the battle in question. If the room was clear of any mobs that are usually there, then the wipe out mobs would leave the room empty allowing the cleric to log back in. Also, I've been on more than one raid were we wiped other than a FD necro. The FD necro did a quick necro rez of a epic cleric (in some cases, they had to do a quick log and then log back in to clear aggro), and a full recovery was complete in as little about 5 minutes (longer in some cases of this). One of the reasons that Necros rule (though I wouldn't necessarily call them &quot;King&quot; <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :lol --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/laugh.gif ALT=":lol"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> ). <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#00000F><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub135.ezboard.com/bexodusfellowshipforum.showUserPublicProfile?gid=mnim>Mnim</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 9<br> <font color=#A8A8A8>(4/14/03 8:16 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub135.ezboard.com/fexodusfellowshipforumfrm6.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1266.topic&index=14>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   melee</span><hr size=1> I just want to clarify.

<br>
It was not meant to be an inference about what went wrong (right?) or who did what while we were in Chardok. It definitely was not meant for casters. I just noticed some melees struggling to obey the shouts &quot;stop breaking mez&quot; and thought I would add my 2cp.<br>

Thanks Sing, you suggested some things I hadn't done and will incorporate into my thinking.<br>
