I am currently browsing the strats for the General battle, will let you all know what i come up with.  It seems this fight will deffinately have to be a multi-guild raid since we don't have enough 50+ in my opinion.  <br>
<br>
Just a note on the this weapon.  the 15 damage on this weapon will add about 50 points to my average backstab.  putting my highest possible at near 475 - 500.  Wouldn't that be nice for some raid DPS eh?<br>
<br>
Well, i'll let you all know what i find out for General strats.<br>

Would like a Tank with defensive (55) at the least.  Would love to have Warm there to slow, as his is probably most effective.<br>
<br>
If we fail I am not sure if he despawns or how long he will stay up.  I haven't seen any info on that.  if indeed he does despawn after a failure then I would have to start all over from the beginning.  But there is a good chance that he will stay up for  like 24 game hours at least if not stay up till he is killed.  I will read more strats when i get home from classes today and will post everything i find that would be beneficial.<br>

<br>
Here is the excert and probably the best strat for killing the general i've read yet:<br>
<br>
<br>
----------------------------<br>
The dark elves in the house are KOS to everyone. They are also all level 55+, and are highly dangerous. If you give the Sealed Box to any of them, General V`ghera will immediately spawn inside the house (and he will probably kill you). General V`ghera is a level 63 shadow knight, casts several dangerous spells, hits for over 200, and has a 500 damage lifetap proc, as well as a huge harmtouch. He also has around 32,000 hit points.<br>
<br>
As a result, the best way to kill him is to, before spawning him, first clear out most of the house so that there is only one dark elf left. BE SURE your pullers leave ONE of the dark elves behind, otherwise you will not be able to turn in your Sealed Box to spawn the General! There is debate over whether Coercer Q`ioul or Brigadier G`tav is the best choice, but Mizchif of Fennin Ro pointed out the following (copied from an old, long-since deleted post on The Safehouse):<br>
<br>
<br>
The one major disagreement I have with that guide, having watched it both ways in the last two weeks, is that I agree with the poster above that you're far better off to leave the Brigadier as the last named DE in the cabin, NOT the Coercer.<br>
<br>
(1) From where the Brigadier stands, you'll be out of the General's line of sight when he spawns and hence will have time to re-hide.<br>
<br>
(2) If you leave the Coercer up, you have to pull her out of the cabin to do the turn-in, or the General WILL see you when he spawns and you're dead for a fight you'd much rather be present at. The debuff pull/wait for her to rebuff on the way back routine is just way too cute and complicated, IMHO<br>
<br>
(3) Plus there's the risk of aggro from the Coercer turning to buff her pet at the wrong moment, or the pet aggroing on you<br>
<br>
(4) Plus, as pointed out above, you will want to kill the Coercer for her robe drops, and it's bad manners to not leave at least one named DE up in case someone else is doing a raid within the next 8 hours<br>
<br>
(5) Plus the Coercer is an easier kill than the Brigadier (chanter vs warrior)<br>
<br>
(6) Plus the Coercer will buff the General if she gets the chance, while the Brigadier doesn't buff. <br>
<br>
<br>
I agree with everything there EXCEPT point 4: When we did my General raid, the Brigadier himself dropped a Kedge robe when he was killed, and the Coercer did not. Most raids will probably kill off the final DE once the last rogue has gotten his General's Pouch, so for the purpose of getting the robe, it doesn't matter which one you save for last. However, the safety and reliability issues for using Brigadier G`tav vs. using the Coercer are all valid, and as such, the Brigadier is probably a better choice.<br>
<br>
You will need a force of around 30 people to kill the General safely. It should be a good mix of tanks, nukers, healers, etc. This force should begin assembling at the Highpass Hold zone border area (in Kithicor) at around midnight game time. The reason for this is so that by the time it is 8 am in game, all of the wandering undead in Kithicor will have despawned, and your rangers will be able to start individually pulling the dark elves from the house, to your waiting raid party, who will dispatch them. The rangers, if they are high enough level, can actually start doing this before the undead despawn, since they can simply bring the undead with them (none of the wandering undead in Kithicor are particularly powerful, and are no threat to a large party of level 50+ people).<br>
<br>
Once the DE house is cleared (EXCEPT for Brigadier G`tav, or whichever DE you choose to leave behind), everyone in the party should move to the road north of the DE house, at approximately +1100, +2600. Be sure that they do not run near the DE house on their way there. The party should then buff up and get ready to fight.<br>
<br>
(From this point, I will refer to the Brigadier as the last DE, even though you may use someone else.)<br>
<br>
At this point, only Brigadier G`tav should be inside the house. The rogue who has the Sealed Box should sneak-hide, move into the house, stand BEHIND the Brigadier, and give him the box. Due to the Brigadier's positioning, and where General V`ghera spawns (he always spawns IN the house, regardless of the location of the dark elf you hand the box to), the rogue SHOULD have time to re-hide before the General notices him. At this point, the waiting ranger can solo-pull the General over to the raid party, while the rogue sneaks away from the house, and goes to join the party.<br>
<br>
WARNING: If any roaming mobs aggro you while you are attempting to hand in the Sealed Box to the Coercer or Brigadier or whoever, you may very well lose it -- if you hand an item to an aggroed mob, it will poof. So make sure there are no mobs nearby (use F9 if necessary to get a look at the surrounding area) when handing in the box.<br>
<br>
Once the General is dead, loot the General's Pouch off his corpse. This pouch, like Stanos' Pouch, is NOT a container, so you may put it safely inside a backpack. The General will RARELY also drop the Cazic Quill. If he does, congratulations! You are DONE WITH THE QUEST -- you should now have the General's Pouch, the Cazic Quill, and the Jagged Diamond Dagger to give to Stanos (see step 10, below). However the reported drop rate for the Quill is roughly 1 in 10, so don't expect him to drop it very often. (If he does not drop the Quill, refer to the &quot;Cazic Quill Subquest&quot; section below for details on the alternate method of obtaining the Quill.)<br>
<br>
A common practice is for several rogues to have a &quot;General party&quot;, which basically means that they all turn in their Sealed Boxes one at a time, causing multiple General V`gheras to spawn. Once the first general is dead, the next rogue moves to the house again, hands in HIS box to Brigadier G`tav, the ranger pulls V`ghera again, and you kill him again. Repeat this process until all rogues present have their Pouches. (Note that if you take a long while, the nightly undead may start spawning, so your group will have to keep an eye on them -- a common practice is to have the enchanters keep the undead mezzed during the General fight, so that the undead can be picked off afterward.)<br>
<br>
If the Brigadier aggroes on someone, you will not be able to give him the Sealed Box until he loses aggro. The usual method is to have an enchanter charm him so that he is aggroed on nobody except the enchanter, and then to mez and mem blur him over and over until it takes, and he forgets what he's doing. If you kill him, then no other rogues get to turn in their boxes until the dark elves start respawning (8 or 24 hours, depending on who you believe)! However once all the rogues are done with their boxes, you may freely kill him, for there is a chance that the Brigadier will drop the Robe of the Kedge (see the &quot;Cazic Quill&quot; subquest, summarized at top and detailed below)!<br>

If in the case that we wipe while attempting the general.  He will despawn after 30 minutes of no action.  So if we wipe, we just have to have a monk attack and fd, or someone attack and take a death or whatever before the 30 minutes is up.  You can keep him spawned indeffinately this way.<br>
