Awhile back, I offered some basic raid training assistance to get people used to leading their own raids. Some great things came of it - Valathia became an aspiring, up-and-coming, ambitious young raid leader, and I got to meet lotsanew friends from CoS.<br>
<br>
This is a great basic skill to have. If there isn't an experienced raid leader on line, and your rare spawn is up - you may very well have to take charge.<br>
<br>
While raid leading isn't my forte - xp grinding is - I am MORE than happy to get you started. Basic stuff inviting people on the raid, giving directions. Makin sure everyone accounted for, loot, etc. How to yell - just kidding.<br>
<br>
I would like to see people get involved with some easier raids - maybe some of the beastlord ones for Empere's epic, the corrupt brownies for druids, heck - ask Arathain if you can lead Kael with him there to co-lead.<br>
<br>
Any interest? <p>I never said I wasn't crazy.</p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000028><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub135.ezboard.com/bexodusfellowshipforum.showUserPublicProfile?gid=arathainkelvar>ArathainKelvar</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Guild Leader</span><br>  Posts: 1476<br> <font color=#A8A8A8>(7/2/03 11:04 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub135.ezboard.com/fexodusfellowshipforumfrm6.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1520.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.exodusfellowship.com/Arathain_small.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Raid training</span><hr size=1> Kael was designed to get some gear and learn raid skills.  It's a perfect place to lead/colead a raid if you are up for it.  It's really not that hard, and if I'm on I'm always happy to walk people through the commands and such.  <br>
<br>
The most important thing in leading a raid is to be LARGE AND IN CHARGE.  People who have been on raids with me know I spam stuff and sometimes in all caps so that I know I'm heard.  It's hard to get left behind when all of the sudden your screen fills up with &quot;MOVE UP&quot;, lol.<br>
<br>
If you aren't in charge, people will start giving orders that they think are best, but maybe not what you want.  Or contradicting orders.  Even if you don't know if you have the best solution, it is best 99% of the time to be firm and follow through with it.  Be open to suggestions, though, but ask those suggestions to come as /tells.  That way they won't be misconstrued as orders.<br>
<br>
Another thing that is VERY important is that the raid leader is responsible for everyone on the raid.  That means he/she makes sure the raid stays together long enough to get everyone's corpses.  Even if people can't help on the corpse runs, they should stay, unless real life calls.  You never know if we'll end up having to fight our way to the corpse.  Hold rolls on loot until everyone is back from death or LD.  Be one million times more concerned about the people than the loot.  With one exception:  completion of the raid GOAL &gt; all.  For example, get the toon rezzed so they can loot that epic piece before the corpse rots even if it will cause a total wipeout.  THEN you recover and grats on a successful raid.<br>
<br>
I've copied this over from the info section:<br>
<br>
RAID GUIDELINES<br>
<br>
The raid you plan should be for your level or lower. <br>
<br>
Ensure attendance by advertising your raid (Guild MOTD, News section, Calendar and forum) and planning far enough in advance for word to get around. <br>
<br>
Plan only one raid at a time. This reduces confusion and allows others a chance to plan raids. You can plan multiple raids and announce them, however they should be far enough apart to allow others to squeeze in their needs. <br>
<br>
Have clear goals and announce the goals to the raiding party so that everyone is on the same page. <br>
<br>
Announce how to handle loot prior to raid. Need before greed, alpha, first loot first serve, or magic dice rolling. <br>
<br>
Create chat channel with a name easy to spell or know (Example: /join Brewer {gnoll brewer raid in Blackburrow}) <br>
<br>
Choose group leaders who you know will conduct themselves well with you, or that you know personally <br>
<br>
Establish &quot;safe spots&quot; when moving to the raid area. Healers need to med to keep their mana. Oh yea, no mana, no heal. Same with other casters. <br>
<br>
Make sure everyone knows not to pass you unless running to next safe spot, and stand where people shouldn't pass. <br>
<br>
Know the area very well before you get there. Study maps on eqatlas and print them out. If possible, scope out the area before the raid. <br>
<br>
Explain politely how to use necessary things such as /assist and not to break mez to people who don't understand. Try to be patient with people who are following the rules and trying. <br>
<br>
You have the option to remove people from the raid who are transgressing or going against your commands in the raid. <br>
<br>
You are not required to wait for people who are late nor send them guides. This choice is at your discretion. <br>
<br>

<br>
I say &quot;minor&quot; cause these are just some things to consider. Every raid is different in need and attendance, so you adjust accordingly. Some of the items here are seemingly inconsequential to the main fights of the raid itself, but can really speed the overall raid process (and even the departure) a lot.<br>
<!--EZCODE LIST START--><ul><li>Can the healers responsible for certain people &quot;see&quot; who they are responsible for? It's easier if they are in the same group. Just keep in mind the other needs of the group (example, you may have several clerics assigned to the MA and or SA, but having 5 clerics grouped with the MA doesn't necessarily make sense if the MA group has other needs for communication, or if the clerics in question are on a timed CH chain anyway).</li><li>Does every group have a porter/evac'r? Sometimes you want to just &quot;get out&quot; when you've reached the raids goal - you can deal loot later if need be. Also, a quick evac of even a large raid force can sometimes save the raid hours in CR time.</li><li>&quot;Well Balanced&quot;: For a raid, you should judge this more on whether the &quot;raid&quot; is well balanced rather than the groups. Instead of melee, melee, caster, chanter, cleric, bard/melee/caster on every group, you may want to remix things for better communication or to maximize effect. For example, as a bard, we tend to fall into a certain mode of songs. I'm melee centric, caster centric, or &quot;raid party&quot; centric in what I'm playing. If I'm melee centric, then I'm going to be playing a ATK/STR/DS song, a overhaste, and a resist/DS song most likely - possibly one more depending on lag. If that's the mode I'm in, then the more melee's I have in with me the more effective those songs (and therefore my toon) are (keep the need for a healer in mind tho). If I'm in total raid mode, then I'm probably doing AoE mana and AoE resists. That means I'm down to 1-2 songs that are group focused, and therefore who I'm with doesn't matter quite as much. If I'm caster focused, it means I'm probably doing two types of mana songs to really push it, and that means stacking more casters in my group means mana goes to that many more casters (again, making that bard that much more effective) - just let the bard be the &quot;protector&quot; melee for that group. If you're doing a CH chain, it may be best to group all those clerics to facilitate them communicating. Yes, they can use a channel, but being in the same group means that the only group chatter they here is from folks that have essentially the same job as they do (they will be more focused). You may want your chanters together for the same reason.Point is, think at a raid level, not just the standard &quot;4 well balanced groups&quot;.</li><li>Your main cleric may or may not be best grouped with the MA - depends on whether you're using a CH chain (in which case they may be better in a all cleric or all cleric plus one bard group for communication reasons) or otherwise why they are the main cleric. The cleric with the biggest mana pool may be the best choice for the MA - even if they are not the main cleric (usually, your main cleric will be the one with the knowlege to tell you want cleric should be grouped with the MA).</li><li>Remember that many classes do much more than you may realize. Learn the other classes so you know how to leverage them in varying circumstances. For example, necro's can be a DPS machine. They also can be a secondary &quot;full tank&quot; of mana for nukers and/or healers. They are there for more than just summoning your corpse after the wipe out. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :lol --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/laugh.gif ALT=":lol"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  Druids are very, very flexible members, but are often thought of as only backup healers or someone that ports you out later. Well, they add some very nice buffs, they should be DS'ing the MA, they have some very nice nukes (our 61 crits for 2k plus), and they can add pets (charmed or summoned) for still more DPS. How do you want to use them today? Mages, Bards, Shammy's, Chanters, and SK's are other commonly misunderstood classes. Chanters have to juggle haste, mezzing, slowing, etc. - do you have more than one? Split assignments on who's taking care of what. Mages do more than CotH. Bards do more than play mana song folks (they can be DPS Machines when you take into account overhaste, ATK bonuses, Damage Shields, etc.). Etc., etc., etc..</li><li>The toon with the most HP/AC is NOT necessarily the MA. Ask yourself whether they will be able to hold aggro or not. What kind of hate can they generate? How does that *balance* with HP/AC? The LAST thing you want is a mob that's ping ponging - it wastes mana, it kills people (while the clerics try and catch up with who has aggro), it wipes raids. How is their resist gear BTW? Do you want your MA to be one taking damage from BOTH spells AND melee? Maybe you do (concentrated healing), maybe you don't (drop too fast to manage the heals).</li><li>How much healing do people need? Thing about who's most likely to get aggro other than the MA. I know you covered the MA for healing, but who's watching the chanter? Who's watching the caster that nuked a little early or a little too often? Who's watching EVERYONE that took that AoE? Most of all, who's watching your MAIN healers? Lots of MA's die when their healer has to take the time to heal themselves - that shouldn't ever happen.</li><li>Will the MA be the MA for the entire fight? It's not uncommon on very long battles (say Vindi or Tormax) to have a warrior with Defensive MA, but to switch aggro deliberately when defensive runs out (to an SA that goes defensive). What does this mean to who's grouped with who?</li></ul><!--EZCODE LIST END--><br>
<br>
These are some of the things I think about anyway. I'm sure there are more that I do (and some I should be but don't know to) that I haven't even thought about here. Frankly, I'm still learning the RL game myself. Every raid I attend I analyze for what's going on. What's working well, what isn't. If the RL does something I don't understand, I generally will ask them why later so I can consider that in future raids of my own. Every RL I run into has something new to teach me - pretty much every raid I do.<br>
