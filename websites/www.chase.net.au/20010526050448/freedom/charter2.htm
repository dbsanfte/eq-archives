              <li>Guildmeetings are in various locations throughout Norrath depending 
                on your lvl. This evening is <i>dedicated to your guild</i>. After 
                we have a guild meeting we will do an invasion. Let me give you 
                an example. Levels 10 through 25 may all meet at Befallen or another 
                spot picked out for that lvl within the guild for there meeting 
                place that week. Lvl 25 and up may have there guildmeeting at 
                SOL A, or somewhere else designated for there invasion. Both designated 
                spots will meet and wait for the guildmeeting over guildchat. 
                After the guildmeeting they go on there invasion. These meetings 
                will be held every other Sunday evening. Officers will meet at 
                7:30, regular meeting is at 8:00 (all times Central). <i>These 
                meetings are manditory, no exceptions</i>. I know everyone has 
                a different schedule that is not the issue.  The issue is <i>if 
                you are online then you will be at the meetings</i>.</li>
              <li>There will only be role play talk in guildtalk. We do not feel 
                everyone needs to hear how your day was. You have your friends 
                and you can send them a tell. So, please keep guildchat, exactly 
                that.</li>
              <li>There will be no speaking badly of another guild member publicly 
                in guildchat. If you have a problem with someone in the guild, 
                tell an Officer, Sgt, or the Guildleader and they will deal with 
                it. Anyone who is trying to report someone from the guild for 
                doing something wrong should be directed to an Officer, Sgt, or 
                Guildleader. This will keep a lot of the rumors down.</li>
