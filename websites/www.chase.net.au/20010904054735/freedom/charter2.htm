              <li>There will only be role play talk in guildtalk. We do not feel 
                everyone needs to hear how your day was. You have your friends 
                and you can send them a tell. So, please keep guildchat, exactly 
                that.</li>
              <li>There will be no speaking badly of another guild member publicly 
                in guildchat. If you have a problem with someone in the guild, 
                tell a member of the high council and they will deal with it. 
                Anyone who is trying to report someone from the guild for doing 
                something wrong should be directed to an high counciller. This 
                will keep a lot of the rumors down.</li>
              <li><font color="0">Anyone who is reported for doing wrongs will 
                be dealt with on a case by case basis. There are some things that 
                will need to be addressed in council and others that I will deal 
                with at the time the issue is raised. </font></li>
              <li><font color="0">There will be no zone recruiting for our guild. 
                We feel that the best quality people will come by word of mouth. 
                If there is someone you are fighting with and you like them then 
                send them <a href="http://pub55.ezboard.com/bfreedomfightersofbrell">here</a>. 
                We want quality above quantity.</font></li>
              <li><font color="0">We feel it is necessary to try to play this 
                as much like roleplay as we can. In saying this when you sign 
                up to be a Freedom Fighter, you agree to our punishments and decisions 
                in a roleplaying manner. Despite our current society this was 
                not the way it was back then. We really want to have fun in the 
                guild, but keeping within roleplay, I must say that <i>my word</i> 
                is final judgment <i>no questions</i></font></li>
