              <li>Dueling is permitted in the Freedom Fighters. We are aware many 
                like to do it for fun. Nobody will be caught killing just to kill. 
                ie..picking on people, hazeing and such evils. We live off the 
                creed of a Paladin and we must act as such. All punishments for 
                offenses will be dealt with on a case to case basis.</li>
              <li>There will be no kill stealing in the Freedom Fighters, except 
                in areas which are considered a &quot;free for all&quot;. Anyone 
                caught kill stealing will be punished, and possibly dismissed 
                from the guild.</li>
              <li>You may have as many characters in the guild as you like. We 
                feel if we have several different classes in the guild it only 
                makes us stronger. There need not be any interview for this, just 
                find an officer and tell them who you are. Sorry, no dark races 
                until rule 4 has been met.</li>
              <li>Dark races maybe allowed into the guild after much work and 
                dedication. If a dark race wants to join the Freedom Fighters 
                they must first prove themselves worthy. All dark races in order 
                to come into the guild must be amiable to the factions with the 
                guild. ie....North Freeport, Kaladim or Felwithe.</li>
              <li>There will be no drinking at guild meetings. It distracts from 
                trying to take care of business. There will be no weapons at guild 
                meetings. It is not necessary to go through bowing to everyone 
                at the guild meetings. They are informal in that manner. Just 
                say hello and that is fine.</li>
