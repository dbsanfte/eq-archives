            <p>Freedom Fighters are the essence of the name: we fight for freedom 
              from the evil that walks this vast land, of which none is worse 
              than our own Freeport Militia. The good people of Norrath are under 
              constant assault from the forces of evil which desire to rid the 
              world of people like ourselves. There are many challenges to be 
              faced and met by the Freedom Fighter.</p>
            <p>We are not the hardest guild to get into, but hopefully, we will 
              be the most united. I feel, and it is my dream, that we all work 
              as one unit to achieve a common goal. You may ask, &quot;What is 
              that goal?&quot;. The goal for Freedom Fighters is to help the needy, 
              heal the hurting, have compassion for their fellow man, but in the 
              same breath do everything in our power to spread light to each corner 
              of Norrath - destroying the evil that walks our land.</p>
            <p>In order to do this, we must know each of the other Freedom Fighters. 
              This is not to say that each Freedom Fighter must attend an invasion, 
              a fair or event to remain a Freedom Fighter but in making this guild 
              great we must be united. A guild is only as good as its members.</p>
            <p> We each must think about the challenges that lie in front of us. 
              There will be zone invasions. There will be dragon hunts. There 
              will be trade fairs, duelling contests, races, giveaways, and a 
              variety of group things on the agenda in the coming weeks, months 
              and years. It is our vision to have a fun, exciting, role playing 
              game that people look forward to being a part of.</p>
