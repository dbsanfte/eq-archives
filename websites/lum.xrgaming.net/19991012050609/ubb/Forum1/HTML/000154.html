</FONT><HR>I know you must get a million e-mails just like this, but I thought I'd send another because hey... maybe if you get more you will do something about it. I know you guys already know about everyone wining that there is no room for houses. And it's true. You should just give the people what they want, more room for houses. In my opinion, you should just do another patch like theo ne beofre which made it so you could only have one house per character, except this time it would be only one house per account. And make it so that the owner of the house can make all of his other characters friends of the house too. That would solve many problems right there.<P>I am also sorry to see these recent patches/rules, etc. that have basically (sorry about the language) screwed new players. I am talking about the housing problem and the no unattended macroing policy. Don't get me wrong, I'm all for no macroing. BUT... what are new players supposed to do when there are tons of veteran players who have already macored their characters many hours. It makes it hard for the newer players to catch up. So why not make new shards for new players, so everyone on the shard can start out with the no macroing policy so everyone will be even. I don't know all the details on what it takes to open new shards (time, money, etc.) but come on, 10 bucks a month from over 1200,000 people, and growing every day equals a lot of money. I think it should be possible to make some more shards. And not just shards in foreign countries either. I would like to see some shards in the U.S. also.  <IMG SRC="http://lum.xrgaming.net/ubb/smile.gif">  Thanx for taking the time to read my opinions. But PLEASE do not send me a generic response that says something like "We appreciate your ideas, and will take them into consideration." Please give me some REAL feedback. Like are they're any plans to fix housing? If so, what are they? Any plans for new shards for new players? If so, when will they be coming out aproximately? These are the thngs that players want to know. They need answers... I know your not worried that too many people will quit because twice as many new players will sign up. That is why newer players need to be accomidated for. By the way, I played UO for quite some time, then quit. But I am most likely going to come back when I move out to go to college and get a good computer and a fast connection. (Both necesities in UO) heh heh  I mean 10 bucks a month is great cheap entertainment when your a poor college kid.  <IMG SRC="http://lum.xrgaming.net/ubb/biggrin.gif"><BR>I know this was long, but hopefull my ideas will be considered and things will be fixed by the time I start playing again.<P>Thanx a lot for your time, and I hope to get an informative response from you soon. <P>Oh ya, almost forgot, is anything going to be done about the rate skills go up, because without unattended macoing they go up REALLY slow. I mean I like the whole idea of working hard to get your skills up, but you've got to admit, this is a little rediculous. People spending 8 hours to get .1 skill, etc. <P>Well enough rambling, you must be getting sleepy reading this, and probably dread getting e-mails like this.<P>Thanx a lot,<BR>my name here. :P</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ffffcc" face="Tahoma, Verdana, Arial, Helvetica">IP: <A HREF="http://lum.xrgaming.net/cgi/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=1&topic=000154.cgi&ReplyNum=000000&forum=General+Discussion&TopicSubject=E-mail+sent+to+OSI+concerning+housing,+macroing,+etc.">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#333333">

</FONT><HR>Krazi -<P>I'm not OSI - but I can tell you a couple things about your letter.<P>Housing is a mess, always has been a mess, and quite likely - always will be a mess. But, that said - It's SO much better than it used to be.<P>We ran a little site back when housing had yet to be addressed - many good ideas got kicked around.<P>One was 'off the map' housing. Some kind of place where even if it was to YOUR own house, you could go that wouldn't clutter up the rest of Britannia.  Hell, I don't care, call them suburbs. I was personally told at that time (at a luncheon) that this COULD NOT be done do to the infrastructure of the game. Course,at the exact same time, I was told the exact same thing about contents not downloading to you for every house you passed until you went over the steps. As you probably know, this WAS done, and quite well, and helped with lag considerably.<P>This is not a new concept at all, a lot of text based RPG's have private areas for each user that are basically not in traveled areas, i.e., 'off the map' so to speak.<P>As to new players having a harder time - they will ALWAYS have to catch up. Don't look at UO as a race, or a competition, look at it as a virtual framework in which to live. Does a child have an unfair burden because it's parents were born 20 years before he was? It's much the same difference. UO is a PERSISTENT world. Elder players having more, being able to do more - evens out (well except for houses as you noted) once a character gets their skills up.<BR>Some people look at hitting GM in something as the 'end'. I look at it as the beginning of my adult life - at THAT point, you have matured your character to the point in something where you are a fullfledged adult in the community.<P>Already on Seige Perilous - there are a few GMs - One I know in particular is a smith. This took a coordinated effort between over 20 people to get to this point in that amount of time....but guess what, some people are screaming their heads off it's somehow 'not fair'. <P>Fair isn't what you can accomplish thru cooperation or hard work being more than what someone ELSE is willing to invest. Fair is them having the same opportunities to do the same exact thing.<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ffffcc" face="Tahoma, Verdana, Arial, Helvetica">IP: <A HREF="http://lum.xrgaming.net/cgi/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=1&topic=000154.cgi&ReplyNum=000001&forum=General+Discussion&TopicSubject=E-mail+sent+to+OSI+concerning+housing,+macroing,+etc.">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#222222">
