  <font size="2">(Originally posted to the <a href="http://boards-cgi.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/forumdisplay.cgi?action=topics&amp;forum=Gameplay&amp;number=4&amp;DaysPrune=10&amp;LastLogin=">official

  </font></b></font></p>
<p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">As Abashi said about exp in a recent 
  post:</font></p>
<blockquote> 
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;It's not a matter of time, 
    it's the fact that I've chosen not to answer this question. I'm sorry that 
    the people here disagree with that decision, but there is information that 
    you should find out on your own, and all of the bumps in the world won't change 
    that.&quot; </font></p>
</blockquote>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">He finally challenged us to &quot;find 
  out on our own.&quot; Well, we did, and here are the results. </font>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">First, some basics. For convenience, 
  I will use the terms 'mob' and 'NPC' interchangeably. There is no difference 
  as far as exp goes.</font>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">1. The exp given by every mob in 
  the game = (mob level) * (mob level) * X. </font>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">There are four major catagories of 
  mobs, 'newbie' (levels 1-4), 'low' (level 5-6), 'outdoor' (level 7+), and 'dungeon' 
  (any level). The category determines the X value, which are as follows: </font>
<blockquote> 
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Outdoor: 75<BR>
    Dungeon: 80<BR>
    Low: 100<BR>
    Newbie: Varies by zone. Anywhere from 103 to 114 have been recorded. </font></p>
</blockquote>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Therefore, every mob gives a fixed 
  amount of exp, assuming it is in normal exp ranges (blue to red). Starting in 
  the low-mid levels, mobs that are one level green give 50% of the exp that they 
  should. Once into the mid levels, mobs that are two levels green start giving 
  25% of the exp they would if they were blue or higher. </font>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">This only covers solo, non-pet combat. 
  We'll get to pets and grouping later. </font>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">2. The exp required to gain a level 
  is determined by a character's race, class, and level range. </font>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">This is fairly obvious, but what 
  we really want to know is what the formulas are and what the values are for 
  each race/class/level range. I'm not going to get into the details of just *how* 
  these figures were derived, but suffice it to say it was a lot of testing, recording, 
  and experimenting, and analyzing of usually hidden data in the game. </font>
<blockquote> 
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The total exp required to complete 
    level X = X * X * X * C * R * L, or X^3 * C * R * L. </font></p>
</blockquote>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">As Abashi has stated, we see that 
  exp gain is not linear. Once again, no big surprise, but we really want values 
  for these variables (R = race, C = class, L = level range), so here they are: 
  </font>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">R VALUES<BR>
  --------<BR>
  Barbarian 105<BR>
  Dark Elf 100<BR>
  Dwarf 100<BR>
  Erudite 100<BR>
  Gnome 100<BR>
  Half Elf 100<BR>
  Halfling 95<BR>
  High Elf 100<BR>
  Human 100<BR>
  Ogre 115<BR>
  Troll 120<BR>
  Wood Elf 100 </font>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><BR>
  C VALUES<BR>
  --------<BR>
  Bard 14<BR>
  Cleric 10<BR>
  Druid 10<BR>
  Enchanter 11<BR>
  Magician 11<BR>
  Monk 12<BR>
  Necromancer 11<BR>
  Paladin 14<BR>
  Ranger 14<BR>
  Rogue 9.05<BR>
  Shadow Knight 14<BR>
  Shaman 10<BR>
  Warrior 9<BR>
  Wizard 11 </font>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><BR>
  L VALUES<BR>
  --------<BR>
  Levels 1-29: 1.0<BR>
  Levels 30-34: 1.1<BR>
  Levels 35-39: 1.2<BR>
  Levels 40-44: 1.3<BR>
  Levels 45-50: 1.4 </font>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><BR>
  Here we have the data that everyone wants, the actual exp penalties/bonuses. 
  Assuming the base value for the race multiplier is 100 (a reasonable assumption), 
  we see that Humans get *no* exp bonus. Actually, the only race with an exp bonus 
  are Halflings, with a 5% bonus. </font>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The numbers for the class multipliers 
  aren't much of a surprise with the exception of the Bard (which is apparently 
  considered a hybrid class), the Monk (who seem to get a penalty for not needing 
  fancy equipment to be a melee class), and the Rogue (who get a bonus because, 
  well, they kind of suck). </font>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The L values don't really come into 
  play until looking at how exp works for leveling (in particular hell levels), 
  so we'll get into that next. </font>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">3. Hell levels really are a mathematical 
  consequence, more of a &quot;bug&quot; or shoddy programming than a &quot;feature&quot;. 
  </font>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Abashi has stated that as the exp 
  curves change, the game forces characters to make up the difference in the exp 
  they should have gotten on that curve up to that point. To everyone's surprise, 
  he's actually right. It helps to look at some actual exp tables at this point 
  to see the &quot;hell level phenomenon&quot; in action. Unfortunately, I can't 
  make tables in this post so it's kind of hard to show it here, but I will show 
  show excerpts from a table. </font>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">We'll use a Human Warrior in this 
  example. </font>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Assume he's level 1, starting with 
  0 exp. </font>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">To complete level 1, he needs a total 
  of 1 * 1 * 1 * 100 * 9 * 1.0 = 900 exp points, a difference of 900. </font>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">To complete level 2, he needs a total 
  of 2 * 2 * 2 * 100 * 9 * 1.0 = 7,200 exp points, a difference of 6,300. </font>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">To complete level 3, he needs a total 
  of 3 * 3 * 3 * 100 * 9 * 1.0 = 24,300 exp points, a difference of 17,100. </font>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">... </font>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">To complete level 27, he needs a 
  total of 27 * 27 * 27 * 100 * 9 * 1.0 = 17,714,700 exp points, a difference 
  of 1,896,300. </font>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">To complete level 28, he needs a 
  total of 28 * 28 * 28 * 100 * 9 * 1.0 = 19,756,800 exp points, a difference 
  of 2,042,100. </font>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">To complete level 29, he needs a 
  total of 29 * 29 * 29 * 100 * 9 * 1.0 = 21,950,100 exp points, a difference 
  of 2,193,300. </font>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Now, he's level 30, the first hell 
  level. L changes to 1.1, and we see the (not so surprising) results. </font>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">To complete level 30, he needs a 
  total of 30 * 30 * 30 * 100 * 9 * 1.1 = 26,730,000 exp points, a difference 
  of 4,779,900. </font>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Then, we're back to semi-normal leveling. 
  </font>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">To complete level 31, he needs a 
  total of 31 * 31 * 31 * 100 * 9 * 1.1 = 29,493,090 exp points, a difference 
  of 2,763,090. </font>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">To complete level 32, he needs a 
  total of 32 * 32 * 32 * 100 * 9 * 1.1 = 32,440,320 exp points, a difference 
  of 2,947,230. </font>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">To complete level 33, he needs a 
  total of 33 * 33 * 33 * 100 * 9 * 1.1 = 35,577,630 exp points, a difference 
  of 3,137,310. </font>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">To complete level 34, he needs a 
  total of 34 * 34 * 34 * 100 * 9 * 1.1 = 38,910,960 exp points, a difference 
  of 3,333,330. </font>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Now we're at hell level 35, the L 
  changes to 1.2, and we see the results again. </font>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">To complete level 35, he needs a 
  total of 35 * 35 * 35 * 100 * 9 * 1.2 = 46,305,000 exp points, a difference 
  of 7,394,040. </font>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">To complete level 36, he needs a 
  total of 36 * 36 * 36 * 100 * 9 * 1.2 = 50,388,480 exp points, a difference 
  of 4,083,480. </font>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">To complete level 37, he needs a 
  total of 37 * 37 * 37 * 100 * 9 * 1.2 = 54,705,240 exp points, a difference 
  of 4,316,760. </font>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">and so on up to 50. </font>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><BR>
  This tells us a few things, the main one being that progressive hell levels 
  aren't all as bad as they're made out to be. The exp required to get level 31 
  is roughly 2x what would be expected, but the exp required to get 36 is rougly 
  2.1x. At 41 it's roughly 2.15x, and at 46 it's only around 2.2x. </font>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">So, while this shows that hell levels 
  really are just a &quot;bug&quot; with the formulas, the progressive severity 
  of the effect is minimal. However, the &quot;hell level phenomenon&quot; could 
  be eliminated if non-linearity were spread out. One way of doing this would 
  be to have exponentially increasing multipliers over the entire 30-50 range. 
  For example, the 30 multiplier would be something like 1.001 (to account for 
  the large range beneath it), 31 might be 1.003, 32 at 1.01, etc, slowly increasing 
  to 1.1 at 35. It would gradually but exponentially rise to the 1.4 level at 
  45, and ideally (mathematically, it wouldn't make the players very happy), beyond 
  45, to 50 and beyond. This would keep the 30-45 range basically the same but 
  make the 46-50 range much harder, and by the time players hit 60, things start 
  getting a little ridiculous with the exponential growth at this time. </font>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">But we're getting off the point here, 
  which is how exp works in the current game.</font>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">3. Pets do not take a fixed amount 
  of exp when solo. </font>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Surprise, surprise! Pet exp penalties 
  do not work *at all* like Verant claims. If a pet class, for example a mage, 
  is fighting blue mobs with a pet and the pet does less than 50% of the combined 
  damage done between the mage and pet, the mage gets 100% of the exp. If the 
  pet outdamages the mage and the mage gets credit for the kill, the mage gets 
  50% of the exp. </font>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">This works for blue through red mobs, 
  but when dealing with green mobs of any kind, if the pet outdamages the mage, 
  the mage gets no exp. If the mage outdamages the pet, though, he gets the normal 
  green exp, be it 50% or 25%. </font>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">4. There is no group exp bonus. </font>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">This might have already been discussed, 
  but there is no extra exp tacked on to the total exp from a mob by nature of 
  a group getting the kill. The &quot;group bonus&quot; is another way of saying 
  that a good group will be able to fight more creatures with less downtime than 
  if the group members fought solo, thus increasing each member's rate of exp 
  gain. </font>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">5. Group exp is not based on level 
  (within reason). </font>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The exp gained by each group member, 
  as long as each member is reasonably close in level to each other, is computed 
  by proportionally dividing the exp per kill by the total exp of each group member. 
  There is no accounting for the level of each person when determining the split, 
  unless certain people in the group are far too low level (a level 50 and a level 
  20 for example). This leads to a few direct conclusions: </font>
<ul>
  <li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">People in hell levels do not take 
    a disproportionate split of a group's exp.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Classes will larger innate exp 
    penalties do not take a disproportionate split of a group's exp.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">People with larger innate exp 
    penalties level slower than their groupmates, even when fighting the same 
    creatures. They gain exp at the same rate and will have the same total exp 
    after fighting the same creatures together, but each one will be at a different 
    level or at least a different percentage into a level with the same amount 
    of exp points.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Certain classes need to play more, 
    outside of their normal groups, to keep up with their regular groupmates. 
    A Troll Shadow Knight will need to play *a lot* longer than the Halfling Warrior 
    he normally groups with to remain at the same level over any signifigant amount 
    of time.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Someone who is grouped with another 
    who is slightly lowerl level but fighting things that are green to the higher 
    level person and blue to the lower level one is still taking exp from the 
    group. Therefore, the high level person isn't just &quot;helping&quot;, he's 
    stealing a lot of exp which isn't going anywhere because the mob is too low 
    level for him to gain anything. </font></li>
</ul>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">6. Pets take no exp in groups. </font></p>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">No matter what they do, how many 
  there are, and how much damage they put out, we can not find any cases where 
  pets take *any* exp away from a group. It's possible that there is some way 
  for pets to take exp from groups, but in every sort of normal fighting in Everquest, 
  it simply does not occur. </font>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">7. Exp loss on death is a percentage 
  of a character's total exp. </font>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">This is fairly obvious to anyone 
  who has died in a hell level. A character loses a percentage of their total 
  exp, and the percentage of loss increases either in relation to the total exp 
  as the total increases. This is roughly equivalent in a mathematical sense to 
  a table of percentage of exp loss per level with increasing values, but there 
  is insufficient data collected at this time to determine either the actual implementation 
  or the actual percentages. However, at very low levels the percentage is around 
  1%, slowly increasing to somewhere around 10% at high levels.</font>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">That's about all I can think of saying 
  about experience at this time that isn't already established knowledge. I cannot 
  take credit for most of the collection or analyzing of the data reported here, 
  and must extend a deep thanks to our friends at HackersQuest, both for their 
  powerful tools used to collect and process this data and for their public forums 
  where the data was compiled and discussed, and many of the conclusions expressed 
  above were drawn. </font>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Despite Verant's half-hearted attempts 
  to stop the work, the task of uncovering the secrets of EverQuest continues 
  to progress. For some of us, there's more to EverQuest than hitting 50, twinking, 
  and item farming (even though many of us who use these tools, including myself, 
  have done all three). We want to learn the details of the workings of the game, 
  which Verant sees fit as being a bannable offense should they find out. Figuring 
  out the rules behind the game is much more interesting than using the tools 
  put out by HackersQuest to &quot;cheat&quot;, but by Verant's definitions, knowing, 
  or even working to figure out the rules, is cheating. Hacking items, looting 
  corpses, duping money, and altering spells is cheating, none of which can be 
  done with the public HackersQuest tools. Knowing the rules of the game is not. 
  </font>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I hope this post was helpful in answering 
  some long-standing questions about exp penalties, splits, pets, and other issues 
  that should have been addressed a long time ago but are still a source of confusion 
  in game for many of the players. </font></p>
