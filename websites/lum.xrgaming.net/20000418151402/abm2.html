      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><i><font size="2">This is the 
        second in a five part discussion on current problems and proposed solutions 
        in </font></i></font><i><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">massively 
        multiplayer online role-playing games (MMRPGs).</font></i></p>
      <p><font face="Arial"><a href="abm1.html"><b>Part One: Who's Here, Anyway?</b></a></font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">We began part one of this essay 
        with an exposition of the members of the community of online gamers. The 
        next step is to see what happens when those members interact with one 
        another. Predictably enough, they decided to kill each other. </font> 
      </p>
      <P><font face="Arial">The trailblazer in managing the expectations of many
disparate &quot;pressure groups&quot; has been Ultima Online, which has been
operating continuously since the summer of 1997. </font><font face="Arial">An outside observer 
could draw out the stages in UO's maturity by what its participants have 
complained about.</font></P>
<P><font face="Arial">In the first few months 
of UO's release, the complaints were related to infrastructure - a bug-infested 
program and game-crippling lag. These problems were eventually, if not resolved 
(lag and bugs are still with us to a much lesser extent), reduced to the point 
where they no longer dominated the game.</font> </P>
<P><font face="Arial">At this point the main 
complaint became rampant player-killing (PKing). After some false starts, the 
Reputation system brought PKing down to a manageable level (it, like 
infrastructure issues, continues to be tweaked).</font></P>
<P><font face="Arial">We can mark the point in 
UO's timeline that PKing was brought under control as when UO began to flourish 
as a community environment. The player archetypes that I described in part I 
began to develop, and conflicts developed between the two. Before the Reputation 
system, for example, there was no conflict between Roleplayers and PKers, 
because the PKers would simply annihilate the Roleplayers on sight. (Some make 
the case that there were two player archetypes before this - PKers and "Antis", 
or Anti-PKers, but many, including myself, hold that they were simply two sides 
of the same coin and there was no appreciable difference between the two 
groups.)</font> </P>
<P><font face="Arial">Once the other groups 
could survive and develop, their communities grew. Player-built towns developed 
for Roleplayers, the T2A expansion was introduced for Hunters, PKers and Lewters 
learned the intricacies of "blue PKing". Guilds became more important,  and 
coalesced around the player archetypes that they supported. Another defining 
point in this process was the Housing patch, which made property have value 
again as houses became securable, and guilds sought out what property they could 
possess as bases of operation and status symbols.</font> </P>
<P><font face="Arial">As the development team 
continued to stamp out game-unbalancing bugs rapidly, &quot;Xsploiter&quot; web sites 
either died out, went into remission (<A 
href="http://www.uoshack.com/">http://www.uoshack.com/</A>, <A 
href="http://www.xsploitz.com/">http://www.xsploitz.com/</A>) or shifted into 
more of a commentary on the UO community (<a href="http://uo.drtwister.com/">http://uo.drtwister.com/</a>, <A 
href="http://lum.xrgaming.net/">http://lum.xrgaming.net/</A>). These sites helped (or, if you prefer, 
caused) the development of the next point in the UO community's timeline - 
serious dissatisfaction with "law enforcement" - the various UO support 
organizations - gamemasters (GMs) and counselors (Cs, or &quot;smurfs&quot;).</font></P>
<P><font face="Arial">This dissatisfaction was borne out when an Ultima Online
GM was discovered to be creating virtual properties (first houses and castles,
and then UO gold in huge quantities) and selling them on eBay for personal
profit. (The entire story is reported in exhaustive detail <a href="darwinfiles.html">here</a>.)
No one was really surprised (and in fact, the writer actually predicted some
months back that this exact event would eventually occur.)</font></P>
<P><font face="Arial">Everquest, by contrast, began only this past spring. The
developers of Everquest had more than enough feedback from the UO community as
to exactly what was wrong with online enforcement, and it was made clear that
the order of the day would be zero tolerance. </font></P>
<p><font face="Arial">Unfortunately, this lasted only a few weeks. The quality
of online support rapidly deteriorated, and, like Ultima Online, the level of
support personnel was kept dangerously low&nbsp; - currently around 1 GM per
1500 players. However, this has not yet resulted in the level of dissatisfaction
as it has in Ultima Online. Why is this?</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial"><b>Perception has been managed. </b>Many Everquest players
are veterans of Ultima Online, and they switched to Everquest, in many cases,
after being burned by UO Support. They expect better, and since support is
usually invisible, they believe that it <i>is </i>better until proven otherwise.<i>
</i></font><font face="Arial"> </font></p>
<P><font face="Arial"><b>The level of support is higher in Everquest. </b>While
Everquest also usually has one GM per server, there are fewer players per server
in Everquest (1200-2000). </font></P>
<P><font face="Arial"><b>GMs in Everquest are percieved as being more
accountable. </b>A GM never appears invisibly in Everquest: they appear as
characters within the game (GM Dunnik, Veeshan's head GM, appears as a 50th
level dwarf cleric in blue platemail.) They can be targeted with all the usual
communication tools available to players such as /tell and /who. The 'ivory
tower' perception is lessened (even though GMs will almost always ignore direct
/tells). </font></P>
      <P><font face="Arial">However, Everquest is still at the dealing-with-bugs 
        stage of its development, and the reaction of the support staff as more 
        bugs are discovered that directly impact players is not encouraging. As 
        the EQ support staff become more overwhelmed with these calls, player-vs-player 
        victimization (harassment, etc) is often ignored. While early in Everquest 
        support staff blanketed the few servers online and were known to boot 
        players for such &quot;crimes&quot; as not acting in character, today 
        the UO support staff actually has superior coverage of their areas of 
        responsibility. This is due mainly to creative server programming - players 
        who file harassment complaints, for example, also invisibly send a non-alterable 
        record of their recent past, so it can be quickly verified. </font></P>
      <P><font face="Arial">This is where we are 
today. Out of the email that I receive as a result of editing the
lum.xrgaming.net site (not including "Lum You Rock" or the more occasional "Lum 
You Suck"), I'd say upwards of 9 out of 10 emails are complaints about UO 
Support. Of course, this is a self-selecting sample (the web site is a professed 
"rant" site, after all), but other mailing lists and message boards also exhibit 
an extremely high ratio of complaints about UO Support versus other 
game/community issues.</font></P>
<P><font face="Arial">Law enforcement - and the 
selective application of it - is an issue in our world as well, and we can 
derive lessons from one to bring to the other.</font></P>
<P><font face="Arial">Let's take New York 
City. (I'm sure many New Yorkers reading this will flame me unmercifully for 
bastardizing the politics of their city, but oh well.) I recently visited the 
city on business, and the difference between today and the early 80's when I 
last visited was as night and day. Literally - I could walk around Manhattan and 
Times Square at night, and ride the subway, and not feel as if I was taking my 
life into my own hands. The city felt much safer. The streets weren't clogged 
with homeless people and panhandlers, police were numerous and very visible, and 
Times Square, where I was staying, had been cleansed of its various X-rated 
peepshows and parlors. I only saw one hooker, and she looked pretty harried. 
(Not that I was looking, mind you.)</font></P>
<P><font face="Arial">New York was cleaned up 
of crime by the principle of "broken windows" - if a building has a broken 
window, it is a sign of lawlessness, and real lawlessness follows. Cleaning the 
broken windows - the panhandlers, the homeless, the prostitutes - creates an 
atmosphere of intolerance to lawlessness, and fosters an atmosphere by which a 
community - the business community of Times Square, in our example, can grow and 
flourish.</font> </P>
<P><font face="Arial">Unfortunately, the 
application of force is often messy. Ask <A 
href="http://www.nubeing.com/torture.htm" target=_blank>Abner Louima</A>. Or <A 
href="http://www.csmonitor.com/durable/1999/04/12/fp10s1-csm.shtml">Amadou 
Diallo</A>, if a <A 
href="http://www.amnesty.it/AIlibtop/1996/AMR/25103696.htm">strike force of 
storm troopers</A> hadn't pumped 41 bullets into him, eliminating this unarmed 
immigrant's threat to the common welfare.</font></P>
<P><font face="Arial">Unfortunately, justice 
in New York is applied selectively. A white businessman from out of town 
wandering aimlessly around Manhattan (say, me) is unmolested. If I were black, 
or Latino, I suspect those friendly police officers would have been somewhat 
more suspicious of me. Even if they don't consider themselves racist, they've 
been trained that members of minority groups are more prone to commit crimes. 
Which of course they are, since have-nots tend to have a proportion of those who 
prey on the haves, and thanks to our wonderfully egalitarian society, there seem 
to be a great many nonwhite have-nots. Form follows function, and bullets follow 
assumptions.</font></P>
<P><font face="Arial">This isn't just a New 
York problem - my home of Little Rock is one of the most racially polarized and 
crime-prone cities in the nation, and the two are undoubtedly related. I 
certainly wouldn't wander around downtown Little Rock at night; the police 
aren't as <I>efficient</I> as those in New York.</font></P>
<P><font face="Arial">Right about this time 
(or actually, probably 4 paragraphs ago, I'd guess) you're asking what the hell 
this has to do with Ultima Online. UO is at a point 
in its community development where the enforcement of its justice system is 
significant. (No one cared what the GMs did when lag and bugs prevented one from 
even playing, for example.) And its justice, to correct very real problems 
within the community, is being applied selectively and with overwhelming, 
capricious force.</font></P>
<P><font face="Arial">The question the 
community faces is the same question New York, and by extension all of us face - 
is the cleaning up of crime - the cleansing of the broken windows - worth the 
cost? Was my safety in Manhattan worth the rape of Abner Louima? The murder of 
Amadou Diallo? At what point is the spending of this coin worth the 
cost?</font></P>
<P><font face="Arial">Let's look at how 
justice is applied in Ultima Online.</font></P>
<P><font face="Arial">Whenever outside 
intervention is deemed warranted, the player files a complaint/makes a request 
via UO's help menu. Depending on how the player files that request, the help 
request is routed either to the Counselor queue or the GM queue. At any given 
time there may be 5 to 50 Counselors and Senior Counselors responding to requests in their queue per 
shard; there is almost always only 1 GM per shard responding to request, and
sometimes 1 GM spread out among 2 shards.</font></P>
<P><font face="Arial">A Counselor responding 
to a request in the queue has very little power of resolution. Until recently, 
they could only penalty-box ("jail") the person actually calling them, which 
while avoiding abuse of power didn't make a whole lot of sense from the 
application of justice standpoint. They may now jail or teleport anyone 
present in a limited fashion (rumor has it this has already been abused as 
well); however most of the time if a situation cannot be resolved amicably the 
problem is referred to a GM.</font></P>
<P><font face="Arial">GMs are trained to 
"triage" calls; calls regarding abusive players have a high priority so that 
they can be caught in the act. A GM will then, if they take the call, appear 
invisibly in the area and observe the situation. If necessary, they can then 
effect any solution up to and including blocking of the offender's account. If 
deemed necessary, a player can be banned from UO after internal review of the 
offender's record.</font></P>
<P><font face="Arial">That's the theory. It's 
a nice theory, isn't it? Problem is, it doesn't work. Here's why.</font></P>
<UL>
<LI><font face="Arial">THE NUMBER OF LAW 
ENFORCEMENT PERSONNEL<BR>The policing ratio in UO is 1 per 5000 (rough 
estimate). The result is predictable - overworked and rushed GMs, and a move to 
"deputize" unpaid volunteers, opening up the system to further abuse.</font> 
<LI><font face="Arial">THE TRAINING OF LAW 
ENFORCEMENT PERSONNEL<BR>Again, I won't rehash the various GM horror stories, 
save one below that summarizes everything I've discussed. Suffice it to say that 
the GM staff has been proven to be less then professional in conduct and 
demeanor. There are a few exceptions, but only a few.</font> 
<LI><font face="Arial">THE ATTITUDE OF LAW 
ENFORCEMENT PERSONNEL<BR>One constant in the many complaints about GMs has been 
their attitude. The few GMs who have not exhibited a poor attitude have emerged 
from the UO community itself, and have more motivation to police the community. 
Most GMs see the job as just that - a job, and have an ill-disguised scorn for 
those they supposedly protect.</font> </LI></UL>
<P><font face="Arial">The following is an 
illustrative tale that recaps all three of these points, and is one that I can 
confirm personally.</font> </P>
<P><font face="Arial">A player had a problem 
with their house on Great Lakes. I believe it was a two-story, and that the door 
was bugged (this was when doors occasionally acted oddly). That player put in a 
page to a GM to see what could be done about it. Note that these pages are only 
one line in length and a true explanation of any problem via this medium is 
fairly impossible.</font></P>
<P><font face="Arial">The GM appeared, 
invisible to the player, and without any discussion or consultation with the 
player deeded the house. "Here's your house deed. Good luck!", the player 
recieved via a "/tell" (a one-way form of communication between GMs and 
players).</font> </P>
<P><font face="Arial">The player was 
infuriated. She only wanted to know if something could be done about the door. 
Now she was stuck with her personal belongings littering the forest floor, and a 
house deed she had zero chance of re-placing (this was after the Housing patch, 
and the house was placed before, so it could not be simply placed again.) She 
paged the GM again, trying to explain in one line exactly how her playing 
experience had been totally destroyed in 30 seconds, and, um, could she have her 
house back, please?</font></P>
<P><font face="Arial">The response - can we 
all say it together, class? - "Sorry, I cannot help you with that."</font></P>
<P><font face="Arial">"Sorry, you cannot help 
me with that? YOU DID THIS!"</font></P>
<P><font face="Arial">"Sorry, I cannot help 
you with that."</font></P>
<P><font face="Arial">The player cancelled her 
account. Can you blame her? And this was in essence a victimless interaction. 
Imagine this sort of interaction in the midst of personal conflict.</font></P>
<P><font face="Arial">A large part of the 
problem is that GMs often appear invisible when they do their job, out of fear 
that the players will descend upon them en masse. Even though they are almost 
always on screen when talking to a player (it's much easier to target a player 
onscreen then typing in their location numbers) the player often feels as if God 
had shouted to them from the mountaintop and then left - leaving their own cries 
unheeded. It's pretty dehumanizing, and serves to reinforce the image of UO 
Support as a heedless, blind entity.</font></P>
<P><font face="Arial">Contrast that with the 
other folks at OSI. The main authority figures in UO - Designer Dragon, the 
programming team, the project managers - are pretty well liked and respected. In 
part, this can be explained by their accessibility. It's hard to escape Designer 
Dragon. He's <I>everywhere</I>. The programmers often post on development 
bulletin boards, responding to ideas presented even in the place of withering abuse from the few malcontents targeting anyone affiliated 
with OSI. The GMs, in contrast, rarely appear, and when they do their 
responses are almost always &quot;corp-drone-speak&quot;, which only helps in their 
dehumanization.</font></P>
<P><font face="Arial">Every police officer is 
also a public relations officer; and GMs are no different. Their actions shape 
their perception. Every time they fail, it will be made public, and they will be 
held accountable. This is a fact of life, in reality and within the game.</font></P>
