</FONT><HR>Background info: The Luxoft Clan is based on the pacific shard (my home), and is composed of somwhere between 10 to 30 characters, all played by only a handfull of people. One of the most well known of this clan is Clerist, who is played by a foul mouthed sixteen year old kid with a reputation for blurring the lines between in character and out of character when he sees fit. He is an attention starved liar, who turns to foul language when his own inarticulate english skills fail him. <BR>According to what little I've gathered, a week or two ago he faked his own death IRL, and had his brother play along with it to convince every one he knew he had failed in his fight against cancer.<P>Why am I posting this? Simple, really. Every now and then you come across such a pathetic display of human nature that it would be a crime not to showcase it for others to see. THIS is one of the many reasons I refuse to have children. Thank you OSI, for bringing the idiots together in one giant melting pot.<BR>-----------------<P><BR>The truth <BR>by Me, the worlds biggest ***hole. <BR>                                                                            posted 8/2/99 12:19:39 AM <P><BR>Listen, I am Chris Grills. Player of Clerist Luxloft, not dead, very much alive. Except I am in the hospital, but its<BR>for surgery reasons.<BR>I am the worlds biggest prick for lieing to everyone like that, maybe if I was a liar I could of just let this thing<BR>continue. But the sad fact is, I am not.<BR>Now, Kyle is my brother, and he did help me put on this little game for awhile. <BR>The reason you ask?<BR>Well, after a HUGE fight with some people I thought were friends. (Once again me losing my temper for some<BR>stupid reason, making a mess bigger than it already was and causing alot of pain to them and me) I tried to<BR>explain the reason I was so tempermental, but they just said I had problems and poked fun and tried to tell me<BR>stuff about life. Well, after everyone made it very much clear that I was an asshole and not liked, I decided "I role<BR>play in a game, why not role play real life as well?"<BR>So, thats what I did. I made up some bogus story with the help of Kyle and tried to get restarted as a new<BR>person.<BR>Problem number 1...<BR>Seems even my enemys wanted to send their heart filled sympathys, and some even wanted to come to this<BR>make believe funeral. Well, I couldn't keep lieing.<BR>Problem number 2...<BR>My friends were feeling so bad about it, even my really close ones. Such as Phoenix, Dameon, Will, and<BR>Marissa. Some people started thinking badly about themselves because of the horrible way I left. I couldn't have<BR>the people I cared about and trusted feeling so bad.<BR>Problem number 3...<BR>I am not a liar. The said fact is I am very honest, thats why my opinion in game sometimes really makes people<BR>angry.<BR>I know everyone is gonna hate me, and I betcha nobody is gonna speak to me for a long time. I guess its time I<BR>moved on anyway, I feel like such an asshole for putting that many people through that much pain.<P>My deepest apologies go to those who were actually hurt deeply by this. I guess I learned you really never know<BR>how much you like something, until you don't have it anymore.<BR>I probably will be leaving Skara, for those of you who wish to keep in contact I will be very happy. Dameon, Will,<BR>and Marissa. I know I hurt you 3 the most, and I feel terrible about it. Maybe we should talk.<P>Signed,<BR>Royal asshole<BR>---------------------------------------<BR>This was posted on the Skara Brae message board.

</FONT><HR>I've seen this before. Not in UO, of course, but in a few MUCKs and MUSHes I've frequented over the years. It's an old story, as the "wizards" of those old-school MMORP/NRPGs will tell you. They have to deal with that crap all the time, and they don't get paid for it!<P>My favorite story was the one where a guy was playing a female character who supposedly was dying of leukemia and couldn't pay for the treatments, and managed to sucker other players for money. Then "she" died. Only the guy was playing another character, a male, whose player profile information listed the same address as the female character.<P>The wizard I know did all the research and basically nailed his ass to the wall. The worst punishment she could dole out to this dork was to change the guy's password on both characters so he could never play them again.<P>Only less than a year later, he was back as yet another character. Go fig, while he was banned, some of the people who gave him money were trying to register him a new character.<P>So the question becomes: who's the stupid one? The one who faked dying or the schmoes who believed he was dead?<P>Me, I believe that everyone's dead. Including myself. We all have yet to prove that we have lives.<P>J.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ffffcc" face="Tahoma, Verdana, Arial, Helvetica">IP: <A HREF="http://lum.xrgaming.net/cgi/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=1&topic=000137.cgi&ReplyNum=000001&forum=General+Discussion&TopicSubject=When+Ultima+Online+And+Really+Stupid+People+Collide...">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#222222">

</FONT><HR>Some folks are immature, some are sick, some are both.<P>Over a year ago, a similar incident happened on test center - with a character that although I was not 'close' to, I had seen quite often and knew. <P>Not only was the 'she' a 'he (not that uncommon), but supposedly 'her' family had contacted her friends online thru 'her ICQ' list to inform them she had been found raped and murdered.<P>Now, this was not a child - he was a grown man - and he was not a 'dude' ingame either, he was a very well respected roleplayer. One of the few males I have ever witnessed convincingly carry off a female part - that says a lot right there. A lot of guys try it, real female players can USUALLY pick them out right away - and most male players aren't far behind in the spotting.<P>Anyway - 'she' had quite a large group of friends, had been a regular on the shard for a long time. Many of them contacted police officials in the town - newspapers, funeral homes. In the end it was all a hoax.<P>Why would any human want to put another thru that? People DO get raped, people DO get murdered, people DO make friends and attachments online.<P>Why would anyone want to cause that kind of grief to another human in real life?<P>Some very sick and twisted folks out there.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ffffcc" face="Tahoma, Verdana, Arial, Helvetica">IP: <A HREF="http://lum.xrgaming.net/cgi/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=1&topic=000137.cgi&ReplyNum=000006&forum=General+Discussion&TopicSubject=When+Ultima+Online+And+Really+Stupid+People+Collide...">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#333333">

</FONT><HR>I hate to see you say that because some kids are stupid and imature is why you will never have kids.  <IMG SRC="http://lum.xrgaming.net/ubb/frown.gif"> I'm a 17 year old male, but I have none of the qualities that you talked about "Clerist" having. Not all teenagers are jerks and have foul mouths. <P>I give all the credit on how well I turned out to my parents. Because they are great parents, myself and my two siblings have turned out to be smart, polite, hard working people. So don't give up on having kids just yet. Just because there are many jerks out there, doesn't mean everyone is. I think it mostly depends on the parents of the kid.

</FONT><HR>Geeze, this wasn't supposed to get deep, I was just poking fun at an idiot I happen to hate. I am inclined to agree with you Krazi, not all kids are bad, but most are inexperienced. This inexperience in combination with unpoliced time on the internet seems to foster a very volatile personality, consisting of a bad attitude, decayed social skills, and poor grammar. I would argue the same is true of rap, too. Maybe I'm just bitter.<BR><P>------------------<BR>--Mourne</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ffffcc" face="Tahoma, Verdana, Arial, Helvetica">IP: <A HREF="http://lum.xrgaming.net/cgi/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=1&topic=000137.cgi&ReplyNum=000008&forum=General+Discussion&TopicSubject=When+Ultima+Online+And+Really+Stupid+People+Collide...">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr></table><table border=0 width="95%"><TR><TD valign=top align=left><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Tahoma, Verdana, Arial, Helvetica"><P>All times are ET (US)</FONT></td><td align=right valign=top><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Tahoma, Verdana, Arial, Helvetica"><A HREF="http://lum.xrgaming.net/cgi/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum1&number=1&thisthread=000137&go=newer"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next newest topic.">next newest topic</ACRONYM></A> | <A HREF="http://lum.xrgaming.net/cgi/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum1&number=1&thisthread=000137&go=older"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next oldest topic.">next oldest topic</ACRONYM></A></font></td></tr>
