It's controls are set for the year 1996.  The place?  Austin TX.  Mr. Peabody wants to take you to start of the Ultima Online project.<P>With all you now know, what are you going tell RG about how to make UO?<P>The dev team thinks the time machine is really cool.  They'll implement anything you think will be a good idea.<P>Your mission?  Give them a grocery list of things that will make UO a better game in the year 1999.<P>Here's my list;<P>A)  Raph is allready warning folks that people in a virtual world are assholes.  I need to impress upon them that the problem will be worse than they suspect.  Much, much worse.  I will tell them that they *must* start off with a zero tolerance policy twoard the idiots.  Dupers?  No leanancy, no amnesty.  Give 'em the boot....and their little dog toto too.  Yeah, they'll lose that 10 bucks a month, but it'll keep two people from quiting, and convince two more people that the game is worth buying.  That's a net profit in my book.<P>B)  Take the people responsible for the skill system and give them a good beating.  I'll then pour water on them, get on on thier feet and give them another savage beating for good measure.  Then I'll discuss RoT, and clue them in to the notion that people do not like having to click on the same thing a million times....and those that do are not the kind of people fit for polite society.<P>C)  OSI will be putting out wantads thanks to me.  They'll be looking for storytellers, who will be responsible for creating involving storylines and quests.  These story tellers will be empowered to make changes in the landscape.  The game will still involve baking bread, but damn it, there *will* be adventures for all who wish them.<P>D)  GMs will be hired from the ranks of grumpy men who sit on park benches in austin throwing things at the squirrels.  Most of them will be ex-cops with a real bad attitude.  We will never be friendly with them, but at least we know they will be fair and not easily corruptable.  The kids who were hired in the "real" timeline will be shipped from school to one of Kathy Lee Giffords sweat shops instead of the comfy GM jobs they now hold.<P>E)  The early days of UO were a blood bath.  It's easy to look fondly upon them as the "good old days of the dreads" but they were only good days for the dreads doing the killling.  The bloody first days are what still fuels the PK debate, and what led to the attitude of the general public that UO is a 2-d quake.  PKing is a needed element of the game, but it needed to be toned down.  Thanks to the time machine, I'll be able to do that.  Perhapos with the proper foundation set, stat loss would eventually be able to be phased out. (point A tells me otherwise, but I'm an optomist!)<P>F)  UO will eventually make 1.5 million a month.  Take an extra few months to improve the infrastructure.  If you have to, push it back to Q1 1998.  UO has allways recieved bad press instead of the "journalistic" blowjob that EQ gets.  Let's fix that now.<P>G)  Lord British must die.  If someone isn't going to activly play Lord British, than a new king must be found.  Someone who won't become a running joke.  An Ultima game has a king who's part of the story...not one who does his "where's waldo" immitation.<P>H)  Did I mention a zero tolerance policy on cheats and assholes?  Good.  I need to say it again.<P>I)  One more time won't hurt.  Kick the fuckwads out NOW before they become a problem.<P><BR>That's my list.  I now turn the time machine over to you good folks at Lums.  Go nuts guys and gals....and racoons.<P><P>------------------<BR>The Great Bob<BR><A HREF="http://greatbob.uoboard.net" TARGET=_blank>Siege Perilous Comics</A> <BR></FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#000000"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Tahoma, Verdana, Arial, Helvetica">Spoonbender</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Tahoma, Verdana, Arial, Helvetica">Good question.  <IMG SRC="http://lum.xrgaming.net/ubb/smile.gif"><P>The twink factor is certainly one that would need to be emphasized. Duping, MASS murdering, NPKing, and scamming has to go.<P>I'd tell them everything they ended up nerfing so that they either start it out that way, or do it better this time around.<P>Muling is a problem because it renders the justice system useless.<P>The housing boom would need to be warned about. Housing and item restrictions from day one would be necessary.<P>The skill system... well, I think Bob said it all.<P>Don't throw a useless second CD full of more land out there when there is so much that needs to be improved in the current world.<P>I'd also offer them a warning that if they don't have 100% details about any idea or plan that they are kicking around, then keep it to themselves. I am so sick of hearing "Where's Necromancy?" only EVERY UO board that now I DON'T want it just to spite everyone that won't let it go. I'd also tell them to ignore thier competition and just concentrate on their own product.<P>.... oh, and anyone with alternate caps in their name is banned :P</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#000000"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Tahoma, Verdana, Arial, Helvetica">Ithaqua</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Tahoma, Verdana, Arial, Helvetica">1. Institute RoT or something similar for all servers from day one. <P>2. Balance combat so that mage/swordsmen on horseback aren't possible or feasible.<P>a.  Horses should take bleed-through damage, maybe 25% the damage of done to the owner... This is so horseback mage/swordsmen who can constantly greater heal will eventually be on foot and thus easier  to catch.<P>b. all stats should have an effect in determining actual hp/int/stamina. like what was on SP initially. This would give pure warriors and pure mages a much-needed advantage, and screw our tankmage friends.<P>c. Greater Heal would be  NERFED. It would take about 5 seconds to cast, and require additional mana based on amount healed. 11 mana + 1 extra per 2 hp healed.<P>d. Recall/gate would have casting time increased to a VERY long time. ~10 seconds.<P>3. I would include true continuity with past ultimas.<P>No pizzas. No katanas. No "french" bread.<P>No Bronze Ore, either. Duh, OSI. Duh.<P>It would not take place in some ambigious world taking elements from ultima 3-5  or so and combining them in a mishmash that can't possibly support a plot.</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#000000"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Tahoma, Verdana, Arial, Helvetica">Sky</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Tahoma, Verdana, Arial, Helvetica">Sequential Moongates!!!</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#000000"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Tahoma, Verdana, Arial, Helvetica">KoF_is_k3wl</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Tahoma, Verdana, Arial, Helvetica">Noto/Rep system.<BR>There's bound to be a way to put those 2 together in a nice way with 1 color for the nice guys(red), the bad buys(blue), the thieves(grey) and the ones that just performed a criminal act.<P>Thieving.<BR>Not to nerf it, but to actually make it an enojoyable experience.
