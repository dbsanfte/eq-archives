    VIEW </b></font></p>

  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Here's an email you all might find 

    interesting, from Kevin &quot;Darwin&quot; Roseler's wife Alysha. As I keep 

    annoyingly saying, no matter what you may think about what happened (and you 

    can read what <i>I</i> think below) there always is another view.</font></p>

  <blockquote> 

    <p> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Let me preface this by saying 

      that this is the last statement of any kind I intend to make about this 

      topic. A question draws out an answer, that only raises another question. 

      It won't end, until someone stops it. Do I hope this letter will stop this 

      madness? Yes. Do I truly anticipate that it will? No. </font></p>

    <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I've played UO myself for a year 

      now. I purchased the game at full price. I paid $10 a month to play it, 

      just as every one of you has. No GM ever touched my account for any purpose 

      other than to robe my former Test Center Counselor, Compassion. I am entitled 

      to my player's perspective and opinion. I think what The GM Formerly Known 

      as Darwin has done is an atrocity to the game as a whole. The players now 

      trust GMs that much less. They feel all GMs are corrupt. They are questioning 

      OSI's ethics and screening processes. It just is reflecting very poorly 

      on Dear Ole OSI. </font></p>

    <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I have been married to Kevin 

      Roseler for four and a half years now though. I am obligated to love the 

      man through thick and thin. Do I condone his course of action? Are you kidding 

      me? No, I am not about to sit here and say "Oh, but he is a fine upstanding 

      man with a heart as good as gold. Just look past the mess and see the man" 

      I love him, but yes, he screwed up...royally. Is he sincerely sorry he did 

      what he did? Eh, I wish he was, but as he said, if he had it to do again, 

      he just might. Is he sorry he got caught? I guarantee you he is. </font></p>

    <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Now, really, is what he has done 

      illegal? No charges were filed. He didn't steal copies of the game and sell 

      them. He created something from nothing and someone bought it. That sounds 

      wrong, right? Well, the selling part wasn't even the illegal part! The fact 

      that he acquired the money by abusing his company given powers was the terminatable, 

      but not illegal, offense. It was wrong and he acknowledges that, but lay 

      off the talk of corporate embezzlement and fraud, will you? If a woman snags 

      her hose and uses a drop of company glue is she going to be charged with 

      company embezzlement? Of course she isn't! Hasn't she taken something that 

      belonged to the company and used it for her own personal gain though? Get 

      real people. If a man has company papers in his briefcase bound by a company 

      paper clip, then goes home with them, is he going to be hung out to dry 

      like a thief? That's pretty stupid isn't it!? He has taken something that 

      belonged to the company though. Where do you draw that line? Sure, I am 

      speaking of actual, tangible things that are as stupid as they come, but 

      isn't creating something from nothing really just about as stupid? "He has 

      put the UO economy out of balance" Tell me just how that is going to affect 

      you John Q. Public. As I said, I played the game and never once did it affect 

      me. </font></p>

    <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">There is one last thing I would 

      like to address. First and foremost, Kevin's eBay spendings and sellings 

      really shouldn't be any of your concern. Since they have become public knowledge, 

      let me just say that the computer parts were purchased by and for his Mommy 

      Dearest in an effort to build a computer so she can keep in touch with her 

      little boy, NOT that it is any business of yours, however. Oh, and the Mickey 

      Mouse salt and pepper shakers are for me. Many of you will of course take 

      this with a grain of salt, but I am a woman of my word. Kevin really did 

      do this as a favor to a friend. He helped the friend and still has the friend. 

      He lost the job, but will find another. We are getting phone calls at home. 

      Kevin is receiving hate mail. I've even received requests for authorization 

      on my ICQ list for interviews with the infamous GM Darwin. All I have to 

      say is, this too shall pass. </font></p>

    <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I am not writing this to defend 

      Kevin. I am not writing this to bash him either. I am writing to point out 

      a few simple facts. </font></p>

    <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Kevin screwed up. OSI DID fire 

      him as soon as they found out. He is NOT the first GM to ever be fired. 

      As Lum said, this was bound to happen. If this 'crime' had not been committed 

      by Kevin, it would have been committed by someone else soon enough. Kevin 

      does not have a dime to show for this. </font></p>

    <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">What more can I say? Nothing 

      I said was so mind numbing as to really open anyone's eyes or alter any 

      opinions. Truthfully, I don't REALLY care what you think anymore. I was 

      always told that not everyone is going to like me all of the time and there 

      isn't going to be anything I can do to change that. The same goes for Kevin. 

      Such is life. That said, I will close. </font></p>

    <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Sincerely, <br>

      Alysha Roseler <br>

      (That is pronounced "rose" {as in the flower} "ler")</font></p>

  <p><font color="#FFFF00" size="3" face="Arial"><i>06/29/99 10:00 PM </i><b>THE 

    EVOLUTION OF UO - DARWIN, eBAY AND YOU</b></font></p>

  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Busy day.</font></p>

  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Most of you have responded, some 

    quite eloquently, here and elsewhere about Darwin generating and selling UO 

    gold on eBay. I posted them in exactly the order I recieved them, and it's 

    interesting to see how opinion gradually shifted as time went on.</font></p>

  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">What's my opinion? Well, contrary 

    to popular belief, I didn't go out for drinks with him after the interview. 

    He didn't seek me out, I went and found him. We had Twister's expose of the 

    eBay files, we had the standard OSI corpspeak we'll-make-everything-better-now 

    press release, what we didn't have was, um, why he did it. So I asked.</font></p>

  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Why have I been making such a big 

    deal out of all this? Simple..<b>. if anything could destroy UO, it would 

    be this. </b></font></p>

  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I'm not being sensationalistic, 

    I'm stating the facts, plainly. I've ranted on about how the incompetence 

    of the UO support staff has had a chilling effect on the way the game's community 

    has evolved. Here's <a href="abm2.html">a particularly long riff </a> on that 

    theme. </font></p>

  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Now we have hard, concrete evidence 

    that despite all the carefully announced checks and balances on the power 

    of GMs on the game world, we have one particular and not especially unusual 

    GM that cloned money and castles and sold them for real money. </font></p>

  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">This is a big deal. This isn't 

    Twister's latest rant, and for once he actually happened across a real news 

    story, and all respect/props/whatever-gangsta-slang-you-prefer to him for 

    breaking it. This is real. This is a hard, concrete example of the corruption 

    that has infected UO.</font></p>

  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">One family's already suffered for 

    it. I know, I've talked to them. You can take the moral high ground about 

    law and order all you want - there's a guy right now who's out of a job because 

    he didn't. And you know, &quot;I was helping a friend&quot; ain't gonna cut 

    it next month when rent comes due. That's far more of a punishment then any 

    biting words I could ever post.</font></p>

  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">His coworkers aren't too happy 

    either, I imagine. Who can blame them? Who trusts a GM, now? I mean, shit, 

    what <b>else</b> could come out? One thing that came out of the interview 

    that no one really commented on was how some GM (I was told by a couple of 

    folks it was GM Boo) just unilaterally deleted Nighthawk's tower immediately 

    after he was banned, out of spite. That's just fucked up. That's punishing 

    a player and, more importantly, those co-owners of that tower who may <b>not 

    </b> have been banned, because Nighthawk writes a widely read <a href="http://www.wtfman.com/jov/">web 

    site</a> on how to be a nasty player. That is so fucked up, it is unreal. 

    OSI can blather on about community online development relations all they want, 

    but when people start getting the smackdown for what they say and write <b>outside 

    of the game</b>, that is wrong. Wrong. Wrong. And what happened to all that 

    GM logging? How was the deletion of Nighthawk's tower logged? &quot;Player's 

    tower deleted, I didn't like him very much&quot;? They said over and over 

    that his tower wouldn't be replaced (must be that &quot;No rolling back of 

    GM spiteful fuckups&quot; clause in the TOS), and then, according to Darwin, 

    he <b>did</b> get his tower replaced, and money besides, as a reward for being 

    a snitch. Nighthawk said he didn't, and your choices for who you can believe 

    range between a recently disgraced and fired GM and a PK who used to hang 

    around with <a href="http://www.wtfman.com/mcd/">Ronald McDonald</a>. Mmmm, 

    role models.</font></p>

  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">You got a bunch of kids, most under 

    the age of 25, working for internship wages, apparently poorly supervised 

    (didn't anyone <b>notice</b> Darwin spontaneously generating castles in odd 

    places?), that hold an enterprise that generates over a $1,000,000.00 a month 

    in revenue hostage. You'd think at some point, someone at OSI would rent a 

    clue. I'm sure many of us would be happy to lease them out at reasonable rates.

  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">[Lum] Is that keep in the screenshot

  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">[Nighthawk] No. I have no idea 

    who owns the &quot;Japanese Hall&quot; that claims to be mine. I'm geniunely 

    clueless in that regard.</font></p>

  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">[Lum] Were you compensated for 

    your ingame losses? With what?</font></p>

  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">[Nighthawk] No, with the help of 

    a friend (Charley) we purchased a tower in game about a week ago. I'd had 

    many many people come up to me and tell me they heard about that purchase, 

    so it's pretty much common knowledge that Charley got me back on my feet.</font></p>

  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">[Lum] Did anyone ever explain to 

    you why your tower was deleted?</font></p>

  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">[Nighthawk] No, outside of the 

    interview you had with Darwin, I've not had an explanation of why my tower 

    was deleted. Well, except that they said they would not replace it - they 

    certainly said that a lot. </font></p>

  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I think we can safely assume that 

    GM Darwin's eBay dealings are not the only funny things going on with the

      Well, that was certainly new to me. I remember seeing a house and a tower

    <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Oh, did I mention the posted

  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">As expected, you had a lot to say 

    on the Darwin interview, and it isn't even daylight yet. <a href="darwincomments.html">Check 

    here</a> for comments sent to me on the story. I'll continue to update that 

    page as more comments come in.</font></p>

  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">One brief comment from me: just 

    because I posted Darwin's side of the story does not mean I am his &quot;buddy&quot; 

    or that I even approved of what he did. I sought out his view of what happened 

    because it was worth knowing. Obviously he has his side, Twister has already 

    posted his view, and I'm sure OSI will no doubt have something to say (even 

    if it's &quot;no comment&quot;). However getting the (ex, in this case) GM's 

    view in a situation like this as opposed to OSI's view or our own bitching 

    is <i>extremely </i>rare, and I think you'll agree it was an interesting read. 

    I'm sorry if it wasn't the usual dehumanizing &quot;ALL GMs SUCK A ROOT&quot; 

    sort of thing, but as I said, there are actual people behind all of this, 

    and sometimes it's worth a look through someone else's eyes.<a name="darwin"></a></font></p>

  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Now, far be it for me to interrupt 

    a good Twister rant, but there are actual people involved in this story, not 

    just the usual conspiracy theories. Actual people, like Kevin &quot;GM Darwin&quot; 

    Roseler, with a wife and young child, trying to make ends meet while working 

    on the digitial frontier that no one, especially including his bosses, have 

    any clue of how to navigate. Actual people like &quot;Nighthawk&quot;, the 

    webmaster of Joy of Villany, who, after rousing the UO community to defend 

    his being banned over a racial slur, found a way to get his lost keep back. 

    Actual people like you, who wonder if the police in your virtual community 

    are on the take or merely lost in an incestuous feedback loop.</font></p>

  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Let's hear what Kevin himself has 

    to say. I know asking the actual person involved his thoughts on the matter 

    is a radical departure for online news stories these days, but what the hey, 

    I like to be different.</font></p>

  <p> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">[Lum] Why don't we start with 

    your take on what happened? </font></p>

  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#CCCCFF">[Kevin] Ahh, where 

    to start... well, most of what the little jerk said was true.. there is no 

    denying what I did. A really good friend of mine was and is going through 

    a very very rough spot in life... he is having marriage troubles... and needed 

    to get out of debt fast in order to try and save his marriage.</font></p>

  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">[Lum] Well, was there ever anything 

    said about eBay to GMs?</font></p>

  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#CCCCFF">[Kevin] well,, 

    kinda a long time ago, like when that first account was sold. I mean I knew 

    if I was caught that I would be fired. But, if I had to do it all over I would 

    do it again... a friend needed me and I stick by my friends. Now that being 

    said, there is the thought that I got something out of this.. well I did, 

    I helped a friend and did not make a dime. There are so many that are never 

    reported. I mean, I am sure all the GM's have done, none were caught for it 

    while I was there (10 months the day they fired me)</font></p>

  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">[Lum] Were any GMs fired for tampering 

    with the game world in the past?</font></p>

  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#CCCCFF">[Kevin] A couple 

    of GMs were fired for getting, err, personal with counselors. You see, they 

    had a rule that we could have no relations outside of business with any UO 

    player. Total bullshit if you ask me. </font></p>

  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">[Lum] Did the story Dr. Twister 

    told on his web page about your GM call re the blue thief have anything to 

    do with your being terminated? </font></p>

  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#CCCCFF">[Kevin] ahh that 

    was bullshit... and you know that Vader is him right? Nah, it had nothing 

    to do with me losing my job, this was not about job performance. Anyway he 

    was also a counselor... Twister backwards was his counselor name. </font></p>

  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">[Lum] Well I guess that pretty 

    much proves that the Counselor program needed better screening... </font></p>

  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#CCCCFF">[Kevin] Aye.. yes 

    it needs much better screening. </font></p>

  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">[Lum] Do you think the temptation 

    of virtual assets being generated and sold for real-world cash occurred to 

    OSI at any point? </font></p>

  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#CCCCFF">[Kevin] When that 

    first account was sold, they warned us about it and said not to do it. But, 

    the lure is always there... I mean, I am sure others GM's have done it or 

    are doing it. </font></p>

  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">[Lum] Would it be too nosy to ask 

    how much you were paid as a GM? </font></p>

  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#CCCCFF">[Kevin] Nah, we 

    make $10 an hour, and I had been there 10 months the day I was fired and was 

    still a temporary employee.</font></p>

  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">[Lum] I realize most of the GMs 

    at OSI are still friends of yours, but do you think they are adequately trained 

    and staffed? </font></p>

  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#CCCCFF">[Kevin] Trained? 

    Yes.. staffed... no, I mean there are times when there is one GM for 2 shards... 

    that makes response times crappy and slow, there should always be one, perhaps 

    two on some shards, ie. Atlantic, Great Lakes, LS, Pacific and maybe Chessie 

    and Cats... </font></p>

  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">[Lum] Do you think OSI will penalize 

    any of the people that you sold real estate to? </font></p>

  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#CCCCFF">[Kevin] I would 

    hope not, and here is a good one for you. Know the Nighthawk guy? Anyway, 

    he was supposed to be banned for calling someone a Jap or something... anyway, 

    someone from upstairs ie. the dev team or the community people said to unban 

    him since he had all his friends protest. While this was happening, after 

    he was banned, one of the Lead GMs deleted his tower and other items, so when 

    he was unblocked, he had nothing. He is the one that actually turned me in. 

    What does he get for all this? A placed Castle and much more... I heard over 

    5 + million gold. You can see how strict they are about racial harassment 

    there. </font></p>

  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">[Lum] I always thought his tower 

    disappearing was somewhat fishy. So Nighthawk turned you in, and OSI rewarded 

    him with a placed castle? </font></p>

  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#CCCCFF">[Kevin] Yes, he 

    turned me in... he looked up all my auctions online, not that I was being 

    to careful or anything, and then emailed them saying that a GM may be selling 

    items on Ebay and then they (Origin) called or emailed eBay and found out 

    for sure... and then I was fired. Again, I am not upset or mad with OSI about 

    my my termination as it was my fault, just the way it was handled and now 

    this bullshit letter they post on the site... that is just plain classless 

    </font></p>

  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">[Lum] Do you think OSI thought 

    the reason for your termination would never have been made public? It strikes 

    me that they're trying to protect themselves. </font></p>

  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#CCCCFF">[Kevin] Yes, I 

    think they could cover it up and hope nothing came out. I knew it would be 

    public soon enough as Twister's little pet, Shai'Tan emailed me saying he 

    knew all about it. I think OSI, thought they could cover it up by firing me 

    and then posting this bullshit letter on the page, but I knew it would be 

    out soon enough as Twister knew what was up. </font></p>

  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">[Lum] Well I think we've pretty 

    much covered everything... is there something I missed that you'd like to 

    add? </font></p>

  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#CCCCFF">[Kevin] Umm, well, 

    yes, if you can add this to the end or something... </font></p>

  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">[Lum] Speak clearly into the microphone... 

    </font></p>

  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#CCCCFF">[Kevin] To all 

    the players in UO, it was my pleasure to serve you and help you in the game. 

    I know a lot of you hate me. Well, not hate me personally but the GM persona 

    of me, and for that I am sorry. But, you must understand there is very little 

    the GMs can actually do. That said, I am sorry to all the GMs, PDs and all 

    the players. What I did was very wrong and I have no excuse. All I can say 

    was that I was helping a friend that needed help. Would I do it again? I am 

    not sure, but my guess is yes. Thanks again and farewell all. </font></p>

  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">[Lum] Thanks for your time, Kevin. 

    </font></p>

  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">One thing is clear - GM Darwin 

    no longer works for OSI. Everything else is pretty much up for grabs on this 

    story. There are a GREAT many ethical questions raised by this interview, 

    and the issues behind it. Kevin's &quot;crime&quot;, if that, is so arcane 

    that it's doubtful a judge could even understand it, much less rule on it, 

    is that he profited from his position as a GM to place virutal houses, castles 

    and other realty that could not otherwise be placed in the virtual reality 

    enviornment of UO.</font></p>

  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">That much is clear, and obviously 

    profiting from his position as a GM was wrong. As OSI will no doubt state, 

    as I have stated in the past, when this happens, as the rules of the game 

    become open to the interpretation of those with the most money or the most 

    influence (much like American society in real life, actually), those who have 

    neither suffer for it.</font></p>

  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">And yet. When OSI gave Nighthawk 

    a placed castle in lieu of 30 pieces of silver, how was what OSI did different 

    from what GM Darwin did? Are those rules of the game more &quot;open to interpretation&quot; 

    by the people who run it as opposed to those who must police it?</font></p>

  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">It's all corrupt, and Darwin is 

    by far not the only guilty party. And don't even get me started on Twister.</font></p>

  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Everyone's favorite Friend In Space, 

    <a href="http://www.drtwister.com/ultimaonline/uo-indx.html">Dr. Twister</a>, 

    posted over the weekend about how OSI may be monitoring use of UOE. Here's 

    my thoughts. I have quite a few, so go grab a beer, because this is a big 

    ol' old school rant from the Lummster.</font></p>

  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">It would be trivally easy for OSI 

    to determine if you were using UOE, since, like every other program, it leaves 

    an entry in your Registry to save your preferences and such. (It's stored 

    under &quot;Kowlesoft Software&quot;, I believe.) Any program could check 

    for these registry entries, and encoding such a check would be trivial.</font></p>

  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">That being said, will OSI ban you 

    for having UOE on your machine? Let's look at some history.</font></p>

  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Remember Starcraft? Really popular 

    game, really well done, really widely pirated. Blizzard (who are all basically 

    a bunch of pirates and hackers themselves, and I mean that in a good way) 

    knew this would happen and put in a serial number on every CD which was matched 

    to a database when you logged into battle.net to play online, which at the 

    time was fairly revolutionary. </font></p>

  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Of course, the guys who pirated 

    Starcraft were slowed down by this scheme for all of twenty seconds, and included 

    a handy serial number generator that allowed anyone using a pirated copy to 

    &quot;roll their own&quot; serial number and jump online. Only problem with 

    this was that, of course, if someone went to the store, bought Starcraft, 

    and logged into battle.net, there was now a chance that someone beat them 

    to their own serial number. </font></p>

  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">This did not amuse Blizzard, and 

    their response, for whatever reason, was to <a href="http://headline.gamespot.com/news/98_04/22_bnet/index.html">download 

    huge chunks of every user's Windows registry that logged into battle.net</a>. 

    They later stated that they did this to try to get the user's identity from 

    their Netscape and Internet Explorer entries (whatever they use for an email 

    address, etc.) There was nothing to actually prevent them from doing this 

    technically. Legally was a different story... and <a href="http://headline.gamespot.com/news/98_04/29_blizz/index.html">they 

    got sued</a>. Blizzard <a href="http://headline.gamespot.com/news/98_07/14_starcftwo/index.html">settled 

    out of court</a>, but needless to say, every game developer was watching, 

    including OSI. who of course has their own <a href="http://headline.gamespot.com/news/98_03/09_uo/index.html">very 

    special legal history</a>.</font></p>

  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Given all that, why don't we examine 

    the UO Terms of Service (which I've <a href="uo/tos/index.htm">helpfully mirrored</a>, 

    since the UO web site is lacking both a search engine and, as best as I can 

    determine, a linkable copy). Section 5(c) states</font></p>

  <blockquote> 

    <p><font face="Comic Sans MS">You acknowledge that you do not have the right 

      to create, publish, distribute, create derivative works from or use any 

      software programs, utilities, applications, emulators or tools derived from 

      or created for Ultima Online unless specifically authorized in writing by 

      Origin Systems. </font></p>

  </blockquote>

  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Pretty cut and dried (and why in 

    the hell a legal document uses Comic Sans as a font, I'll never fathom.) But 

    what's interesting is this next part, section 5(e):</font></p>

  <blockquote> 

    <p><font face="Comic Sans MS">You understand that you have no expectation 

      of privacy regarding the communications you make on the Service, and that 

      all communications made by or received from you may be monitored by Origin 

      Systems representatives. You hereby consent to the extraction of hardware 

      system profile data and any data related to operation of the Software through 

      the Service from any computer that logs on to the Service using your Account.</font></p>

  </blockquote>

  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Things that make you go <a href="http://www.cdnow.com/cgi-bin/mserver/SID=787980206/pagename=/share/ensotrack2.html/pop=1/UPC=7464470932/disc=01/track=03/source=ENSO/ra.ram">hmmmmm</a>. 

    Now, this may very well be just legal butt-covering in the wake of the Blizzard 

    lawsuit... or maybe it's just preparedness. Only the dev team (or more probably, 

    their lawyers) know for sure.</font></p>

  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Now, unlike certain other <a href="http://www.drtwister.com/ultimaonline/uo-indx.html">less 

    responsible web sites</a>, I'm not suggesting <a href="http://uoss.stratics.com/hall/war/messages/92883312212944.html">dragging 

    OSI into court every time a GM looks at you sidewise</a>. I'm a firm believer 

    in the <a href="http://www.nowandzen.com/zen/firthinwedol.html">Shakespearean 

    method</a> of tort reform. However, even if OSI *could* download and inspect 

    your registry (which they can, as I showed above), and assuming a lawyer does 

    not immediately float into the programmer's den there and intone &quot;THOU 

    HAST LOST AN EIGHTH!&quot; when they do it (which they won't, as I showed 

    above), what does it really prove?</font></p>

  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">They aren't confirming that you 

    are USING UOE by this method, merely that you INSTALLED it. I'm pretty sure 

    a whole lot of people, up to and including GM Lord British, have installed 

    UOE. If for no other reason, just to see what other idiots could do to YOU. 

    While the <a href="uo/tos/index.htm">TOS</a> pretty clearly states that you 

    can't install or use any 3rd party utilities unless OSI sends you a registered 

    letter (it has to be &quot;</font><font face="Comic Sans MS">specifically 

    authorized in writing by Origin Systems</font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;, 

    remember) the fact is that this TOS was hidden in a web document on OSI's 

    web site that took me six minutes to find (I timed it) and I am, as you all 

    know, the <a href="http://www.sphere.ad.jp/ninja/eng/enter/nin-life/lifedata/life5.html">Web 

    Search Ninja</a>. It would take mere mortals at LEAST ten minutes. And as 

    we all know, <a href="http://www.webcom.com/emmetth/tb/problem_player.html">enforcement 

    is nine-tenths of the law</a> in the wild and wooly world of UO, as <a href="imthelaw.wav">GM 

    Judge Dredd would say</a>. It's theoretically possible that you could be banned 

    for installing UOE, but enforcing it would be an entirely different beast 

    entirely.</font></p>

  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">There is one other possibility, 

    and that is that the UO client has been patched to detect what if any other 

    processes are running alongside it. This is also pretty easy to do, although 

    not as falling-off-a-log easy as checking the registry to see if UOE was installed. 

    It's pretty easy to guess what would happen if GMs COULD detect if UOE were 

    running... everyone running UOE would be banned. So either this hasn't been 

    done, or (more likely, given the rumors out of OSI) it has but they are waiting 

    on the OK from legal to begin the executions.</font></p>

  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Of course, if you actually are 

    worried about OSI finding out if you use UOE, you are <a href="http://www.themushroom.com/legit/e399/e3day2.html">a 

    complete and total loser</a> anyway. Now that UOA has been approved, and many 

    not-quite-as-approved hacks to re-enable continuous macroing are out as well, 

    the only people who use UOE with UO are those who are too cheap to actually 

    fork over a lousy ten bucks for a software program. Two words - blow me.</font></p>

  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">It could be worse. In EQ, the solution 

    was to just not <a href="http://www.deja.com/getdoc.xp?AN=483564886&amp;fmt=text">allow 

    you to use any third party utilties while EQ is running. Like, say, Windows</a>.</font></p>

    DARWIN LEAVES OSI AFTER BEING REVEALED AS ACTUALLY BEING DR TWISTER </b></font></p>

  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">GM Darwin <a href="http://www.mwcyber.com/forums/testcenter/messages/32339.html">posted 

    on the Gate Traveller board</a> that he was leaving OSI. Although he said 

    he was leaving of his own will, another comment that all his accounts, including 

    his personal account, were blocked suggest otherwise. This is the same GM 

    Darwin that Dr. Twister accused of &quot;tampering with evidence&quot; after 

    being called last week. Any connection?</font></p>

  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Speaking of press releases, you 

    know, we haven't heard anything from LadyMOI lately. You don't think... no, 

    she can't... well maybe... I hate to admit the possibility, but she may be 

    seeing another website. There, it's out. But we can take it, we're a mature, 

    strong website, and <a href="http://www.celineonline.com/">our heart will 

    go on</a>. Maybe this new &quot;director of external relations&quot; (god, 

    that sounds so Borg) will be more careful with our web-based affections. <a href="http://www.asiaworld.org/">Only 

    time will tell</a>. </font></p>
