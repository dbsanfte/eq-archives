Mostly just sits in front of its monitor and drools<BR>over some pornsite.<P><BR>   Typical dialogue:<BR>      U: "Machine no work."<BR>      S: "What's wrong with it?"<BR>      U: "Machine no work."<BR>      S: "Ok. Which machine do you use?"<BR>      U: "Machine no work."<BR>      S: "Right, I heard you. Where is your machine?"<BR>      U: "Machine no work!"<BR>      S: "*sigh* I'll come with you back to your room."<BR>      U: "Machine no work?"<BR>      S: "Go back to room."<BR>      U: "Go back. Room."<P><BR>   Frequency of appearance:<BR>      *Much* too often.<P><BR>   Suggested treatment:<BR>      Kill.<P>The Mumbler on the Treshold<BR>---------------------------<BR>Appears at the sysadmin's doorstep and speaks very, very softly.<BR>Sometimes it's possible to get it to speak up a little. Very often,<BR>it'll go away at the slightest provocation.<P><BR>   Typical dialogue:<BR>      U: "mumblemumblenetscapemumblemumblemumble"<BR>      S: "Excuse me?"<BR>      U: "mumblemumblemubleservicepackmumble"<BR>      S: "Sorry, I can't hear you."<BR>      U: "...can't start Netscape..."<BR>      S: "Try clicking on the Netscape icon."<BR>      U: "mumblemumblemumblemumblemumblemumble"<P><BR>   Frequency of appearance:<BR>      Much too often.<P><BR>   Suggested treatment:<BR>      Kill.<P>The Rabid Guesser<BR>-----------------<BR>Barges into the sysadmin's room and starts spouting nonsense, usually<BR>in a quite aggressive fashion. Has picked up a technical term or two<BR>somehow, and blames everything on those terms.<P><BR>   Typical dialogue:<BR>      U: "You have to do something about the collisions on the SCSI<BR>          channel!"<BR>      S: "What?"<BR>      U: "It can't go on like this, you must fix it, now!"<BR>      S: "What was the problem again?"<BR>      U: "The SCSI doesn't work, that's what. And it's slow."<BR>      S: "How can it be slow if it doesn't work?"<BR>      U: "I don't know, you're the expert, not I."<BR>      S: "What's the problem?"<BR>      U: "It's slow. Didn't you listen when I told you?"<BR>      S: "*What* is slow?"<BR>      ...and so on until the sysadmin grows tired, follows the user to<BR>      its workplace and discovers that it has pulled the network cable<BR>      out of the workstation. Why it started talking about SCSI is<BR>      never revealed.<P><BR>   Frequency of appearance:<BR>      Much too often.<P><BR>   Suggested treatment:<BR>      Kill.<P>The Economist<BR>-------------<BR>This is a *really* nasty one.<P><BR>   Typical dialogue:<BR>      U: "So, what are the options for the new server?"<BR>      S: "Well, first we have the Dungheap MT. It's larger than our<BR>          computer room, needs the Niagara Falls to power it, it's<BR>          ugly, it laughs evilly if you get too close to its console,<BR>          it reeks of brimstone, Greenpeace and Exxon have made a<BR>          joint statement cursing the moment it was created, it's<BR>          illegal to import to most of the civilised world, it has a<BR>          habit of sending nasty email to CEOs, its mother was a<BR>          hamster and its father smelled of elderberries. And it<BR>          doesn't do what we need anyway. Secondly, we have the<BR>          Frotzpock 3000. It's small, elegant, doubles as a coatrack,<BR>          draws its power from the Earth's magnetic field, it sings<BR>          cute little songs, spreads happiness wherever it goes,<BR>          cleans the floor, washes the dishes, rubs your back, reminds<BR>          you of your wife's birthday, does everything we need<BR>          perfectly and without error and it only costs $5 more than<BR>          the Dungheap."<BR>      U: "Ah, the choice is clear, then. We go with the Dungheap MT."<BR>      S: "WHAT?!"<BR>      U: "Well, you *did* say it is cheaper, didn't you?"<P><BR>   Frequency of appearance:<BR>      A handful per company, usually.<P><BR>   Suggested treatment:<BR>      Take off and nuke the site from orbit (it's the only way to be<BR>sure).<P>The Firm Believer in Trade Magazines<BR>------------------------------------<BR>May be difficult to tell apart from the Common Idiot, but the<BR>differences will be apparent if it ever ends up in a discussion about<BR>what sort of equipment to purchase.<P><BR>   Typical dialogue:<BR>      S: "...so you see that the Frotzpock is the natural choice for<BR>us."<BR>      U: "I read a very bad review of the Frotzpock in a trade<BR>          magazine. The reviewers had great problems opening the box<BR>          it came in."<BR>      S: "Well, that won't be a problem for us. I *do* know how to<BR>          open cardboard boxes."<BR>      U: "They much preferred the Dungheap 89. That one didn't need<BR>          any stupid box, it just oozed in under the door."<BR>      S: "Er, the Dungheap doesn't even do what we need the new<BR>          machine for."<BR>      U: "...and DungUser Magazine said that the new version's father<BR>          only smelled *slightly* of elderberries!"<P><BR>   Frequency of appearance:<BR>      Much too often.<P><BR>   Suggested treatment:<BR>      Kill.<P>The Incessant Talker<BR>--------------------<BR>Appears at the sysadmin's door, starts describing some sort of problem<BR>and just never stops.<P><BR>   Typical dialogue:<BR>      U: "Hello I hope I'm not interrupting you I have this problem<BR>          you see I can't print pictures from Netscape anymore even<BR>          though I could do that yesterday and the day before and even<BR>          the day before that but not last Wednesday for some reason I<BR>          think it may have had something to do with the blackout that<BR>          day don't you printers don't usually work very well without<BR>          electricity do they neither do computers for that matter I<BR>          couldn't log in at all until the power came back I must have<BR>          tried at least a million times I think well maybe not quite<BR>          that many but ten thousand at least my keyboard was all worn<BR>          down so I couldn't see what it said on the keys any more so<BR>          the day after I went down to Office Supplies to get a new<BR>          one and they said I couldn't just get one I had to fill in a<BR>          form first have you heard anything that stupid don't they<BR>          realise that I'm very important to the company and do a lot<BR>          of valuable work here without me nothing would get done I<BR>          tell you and of course I told them in no uncertain terms but<BR>          they just wouldn't listen to me and kept insisting that I<BR>          needed that stupid form so in the end I went to get a form<BR>          but discovered that in order to get the form you had to send<BR>          a mail to someone and I couldn't send mail since my keyboard<BR>          didn't work can you believe that eventually after two days I<BR>          managed to type out the mail using only my nose you can't<BR>          believe how hard that was it took almost a whole day and<BR>          after I sent the mail I was told that I didn't really have<BR>          to send it anyway since our departement has a stack of those<BR>          forms lying in the tray between the printer and the copying<BR>          machine so I went over to Bob and asked him hey Bob do you<BR>          know where we keep the printer and the copying machine and<BR>          he told me that he thought they were being repaired at the<BR>          moment so I couldn't use them anyway but I told him that I<BR>          weren't going to use them I just wanted to know where they<BR>          were so that I could go here and get..."<P><BR>   Frequency of appearance:<BR>      Much too common.<P><BR>   Suggested treatment:<BR>      Let it be. It's fairly easy to ignore, and as long as it's there<BR>      no other users can get in.<P><BR>The Fixer<BR>---------<BR>Suffers from the delusion that it is capable of fixing problems by<BR>itself, thus turning mishaps into fullblown disasters. Often<BR>masquerades as a sysadmin.<P><BR>   Typical dialogue:<BR>      U: "The mailserver was running slowly, so I thought I'd have a<BR>          look at it. I saw that it was really busy relaying mail, so<BR>          I thought I'd remove some old processes that nobody used any<BR>          more. But as soon as I killed this really old process called<BR>          'init' the machine crashed!"<P><BR>   Frequency of appearance:<BR>      Much too common.<P><BR>   Suggested treatment:<BR>      Kill.<P><BR>The Drone With The Write-Once Brain<BR>-----------------------------------<BR>A fact once got stuck in its brain. Since then it uses said fact for<BR>everything.<P><BR>   Typical dialogue:<BR>      U: "My machine is slow. There is a large process running on my<BR>          system. Kill it."<BR>      S: "Um, that's your X server. Do you *really* want me to kill<BR>          that? And it's not really that big, it's just fake memory."<BR>      U: "Yes. Kill it."<P><BR>      <Next day><P><BR>      U: "My machine has crashed. There must be a large process<BR>          running.

There must be a large process<BR>          running. Kill it."<BR>      S: "Don't you think it'd be better to call the fire brigade?"<BR>      U: "Yes.

I hope I'm not interrupting you?"<BR>      S: "Not at all. What's the problem?"<BR>      U: "It's the BogoGraphics package. I'm trying to use one of the<BR>          new functions in version three, but I can't get it to work.<BR>          I've checked that there is enough memory, the permissions on<BR>          all the files look correct and I installed it exactly<BR>          according to the instructions in the README file. I do get<BR>          an error message. It's not very informative, but I wrote it<BR>          down for you anyway. I tried looking it up in the manual,<BR>          but it's not there.
