In case you actually have a life, the UO dev team announced their plan to "clean up Britannia", aka reduce item counts on the shards, yesterday. This has been the stuff of rumors for weeks, and one of the most draconian solutions that was rumored, having items in houses decay, is the one Origin chose. <br><br>The basic impact of this? <b>All items outside of locked down containers will be deleted from your house.</b><br><br>Gordon the Tyrant, posting on our message board and elsewhere, hinted that houses would see more storage/lockdown capability. Sunsword also stated:</p><blockquote><p>The lockdown system is going to be revised to allow more secure containers and to allow you to lockdown generics.<br><br>I'm looking into the possibility of taking weight limits out of secure containers.<br><br>I just wanted to let you know that we aren't just going to "turn on" item decay without making some changes to storage first.</p></blockquote><p>Krelin, posting on the COB Dev Board, had this to say:</p><blockquote><p>First, I'm not setting policy, or telling you what we're going to do. (I haven't been very involved with the item decay design & imp, but I do have some thoughts on it; especially as it effects server performance)<br><br>So, first let me give you my thoughts (again, just THOUGHTS :) on the hard limit idea: By hard limit, I assume that you mean don't even allow someone to exceed the maximum number of items (whatever that limit is) per house. This essentially means that if I'm crafting away and I create that one item that exceeds to total limit of my house, I have no place to put it, even temporarily. I'm basically stuck with the item, or forced to leave it on the ground outside my house, until I can either get rid of some of the OTHER items in my house, or figure out what the heck to do with it. Remember the "limit" is still the same either way. The "hard limit" way just means that we impose an artificial boundary that can't be exceeded no matter what. The "decay" way means that we give you a certain amount of storage that you can use no matter what, and if discard things on the floor of your house (or otherwise not "secured" whatever that term means), they eventually go away, just as things discarded on the ground outside your house eventually go away. I think the "decay" solution seems more realistic, less arbitrary, and more convenient. (again, I'm not telling you what's going to happen, or what's been implemented, as I don't know for sure. These are just My Personal Opinions (tm))<br><br>To your second point, yes. I know that the team considers a large portion of what is posted here, and it all factors into what we eventually design and implement.<br><br>To your third point, your assumption is wrong. Any item count reduction measures we take (and have taken recently) are design _primarily_ to enance the EXISTING service. Certainly we have an eye on the performance issues involved in bringing new land and new housing into the world, but that is secondary to the issues we are facing right now.<br><br>Just to give you an idea of the problem, there were approximately half as many objects (peak; and objects include a lot of things) in the world (for most shards) as of about May, than there are right now. We've nearly DOUBLED in about 5 months!!! That's a lot of objects. A whole lot. And a lot of them have been created in the last few months, but the reality is that right now there aren't enough "forces" at work to get rid of these objects or incentivise you to get rid of them, and so you store them (it's human nature), ALL OF THEM. Note that this increase in objects does NOT coincide with a similarly dramatic increase in active players at peak times (more shards spread more players out, so that one shard's peak is generally the same over the last few months). That means that the same number of players are accounting for twice as much junk. :)<br><br>So what does all this mean to you? This means that each time the world "heartbeats" it processes a huge amount of data (not all of the items in the world on every heartbeat, but a portion of them). And as the data in the world grows steadily, the time required to "heartbeat" the world grows steadily. You perceive this as lag. Additionally, each object in the world must be backed up at some interval. The longer a backup takes, the more you will be "warped" if the world crashes. Also, longer backups mean longer downtimes (as the backups must be processed at startup). Finally, and perhaps most importantly, longer backups mean more LAG; because backup processes run on the same machines the world processes run on, backups suck CPU that could otherwise be used for cool monster AI and other useful features.<br><br>So, those are my thoughts on the situation. Again, this post is NOT intended to describe the solution to item count. I don't know what the solution is. I just know what the problem is. :) Our goal is NOT to hurt you guys in any way. Our goal is to enhance your gameplay by making our service run better, longer, and more stably, while continuing to enhance overall gameplay. Certainly given infinite resources it would be much more fun to have a totally infinite world (and that was the original design for UO, I suspect). But the truth is, the world _should_ be finite, because the resources are.<br><br>Anyways, thanks for listening to my rant, and know that we're listening to yours as well. :)</p></blockquote><p>On the player side, the responses have been... well... somewhat heated, as the impact of the proposed changes sunk in. Many guilds realized that shared housing would soon become useless for their member's storage needs. Other players would be impacted as well, such as this one who writes:</p><p><blockquote>this new patch for items to decay in houses that aren't locked down, what about things you cant lock down??? Hanging herbs, furs etc., things we use to make our houses more pleasant environments. It's going to drive me out of business as a bulk reg seller and interior decorator. I am in Australia so don't hunt or pvp, I get my enjoyment in the game from other ways. I am not sure who to approach in UO but I have attached some pics of why its going to affect me, these are from jobs i have done in 2 different shards. Sure. let's reduce items, but not this way! Well enough of my ranting, not too coherent hehehe but see <a href="decorator.html">the pics</a> and if you could perhaps bring them to someone in UO's attention as an example???</p></blockquote><p>Another player writes on the Dev Board:</p><p><blockquote>If I am reading this correctly, then it is true that items in locked down containers will decay. So this means we are going to be limited to 400 stones worth of stuff that we can keep in our house, plus 400 stones in the bank. Thats 8000 ingots total for a miner, 8000 regs for a mage, 800 blank scrolls for a scribe, 800 empty bottles for an alchy, and that means any of these chars cant have anything else. What if you have ALL of these types of chars. It absolutely isnt fair, I would rather play 4 hours a day and have 20 hours worth of backup then to have to play like this. Its just plain stupid. Calandryll posted yesturday that stackable items werent the problem, so why are we being penalized. We dont get credit for throwing them away, but if we dont toss them they will decay afterwards anyways. If another system is going to be implemented that will allow for no weight restrictions then I would assume that it would have been posted on the In Development with this junk. Why is there a weight limit anyways if items are the problem. My 60K ingots are worth more to me then 125 items worth of made armor, yet i can keep the 125 pieces of armor or a choice of 4000 ingots, its totally not fair.</p></blockquote><p>I'll keep you up to date on any developments, and keep emailing me and posting your thoughts on our message base (see link above).

Well, <a href="http://update.uo.com/indev.html">the other shoe</a> has dropped. Items in houses that are not locked down will decay (a polite term for "going away").<br><br>According to Origin's update, items in locked down containers will not decay. However, the code that's currently in place on Test Center is actually decaying items in containers, locked down or not. <br><br>Is there some reasonable, non-insane explanation why this is being implemented instead of some sort of housing maintenance? With the shortage of housing, almost every normal, non-l33t player is forced to rely on shared housing, whether with their guild or just with other friends. <b>This update will punish them for playing by the rules.</b> <br><br>Meanwhile, the crackheads who speculate in UO real estate and log on merely to click on their house sign continue to do their thing, laughing at those foolish enough to actually play the game in the manner which it was intended.<br><br>This stinks. Basically, unless you own a house of your own, your storage will be limited to what can fit in your bank. Good luck if you're red. (Of course, reds are used to bending over and taking it from Origin anyway.) <br><br>So much for a persistent world.<br></font></td></tr></table><br clear=left><br><a name="newsitem938632546,71461,"></a>

Adrick comments on the new Stockpile Ticket System:<br><br>I am very upset about this ticket thing.  I dont care if it's a one time deal.  I have never kept stuff for no other reason than I could - apparently OSI is now saying thank you to all those players who did by giving them free stuff - the best of which is newbie status on one item.  So In other words thanks for hoarding - here is your prize go kill some people with the vanquishing sword and never risk losing it - just our way of thanking you for the long time warps, excessive lag when our severs are backing up etc etc.  To the rest of you who didn't hoard - well you just don't get nothing at all - no stuffs for you.<br> <br>Excuse me, those who hoard ought to lose 20% upon death and the rest of us who havent, don't, don't ever want to, consider it rude and selfish should have catapults to antihoard the shard and those who are destroying it.  <br> <br>I have not gotten this upset over something in UO since reputation - I cannot understand the mindset at OSI.  If there are that many people who will quit if their rare death robes decay then UO is a scavenger hunt not Ultima Online and ought to be marketed as such.<br> <br>Its time to simply say NO - you cant have all that stuff - give it back or be destroyed.  Send out the catapults of house destruction.  Sign me up to man one - Ill get you 10 min backups and less lag.<br> <br>Adrick<br></font></td></tr></table><br clear=left><br><a name="newsitem938630998,45212,"></a>

Pretty neat stuff... it's rare that our little milieu is taken so seriously (well, outside of my Posting-Real-Soon-Now series of essays). Here's an excerpt:<br><br>==<br>Ultima Online&#8217;s dynamic conflict (or virtual violence) system is more than just group interaction and demarcation of territories. While there can be conflict between guilds, conflict more often occurs at the individual level. In a society where there are little societal laws and enforcement measurements, violence occurs across the UO landscape. Having to deal with murderers, thieves, and monster spawns is something of daily occurrence. This situation is an integrated component to Ultima Online &#8211; the programming for Ultima Online provides the possibility for those to follow the path or fear and conflict, even in some cases master it. It does in ways provide a realistic comparison to that of realspace &#8211; for those to follow a relatively free decision-orientated path within certain parameters set by society. <br><br>An outcome of conflict is that it creates diversity. Social identity can arise from this conflict. The idea of being a &#8216;red&#8217; and the impacts of being a red or anti-pker creates a social identity. Groups form around this conflict to form guilds of player killers. As Jabri notes, when formed as a group, they demarcate the territory that they reside in. This is quite evident on the Siege Perilous shard with the ORCS &#8211; a guild that role-plays as a race of Orcs. They have marked a territory of their own, an AI Orc fort, and the surrounding landscape around them (located North West of the X-roads, north west of Britannia). All know that if they pass through this territory, they face a likely chance of meeting a red Orc. And one can expect it won&#8217;t be a healthy encounter for the traveler. Many will go around these red territories to ensure that they do not encounter any reds. So one can see that there is this social identity, group formation, and conflict as a source of migration/population mobility from player conflict. <br></font></td></tr></table><br clear=left><br><a name="newsitem938550689,60247,"></a>

From our message board, Tal'Mah'Ra posts the following:<br><br>First off I have a good buddy who has worked on Electronic Arts projects across the board (He has been there a while). He doesnt play UO but he has played previous Ultima Games. Now... He is a Graphic Artist out here in Vancouver and he is working on UO2. (and I had no idea EA Canada had eployees working on the UO2 Project until about last week).<br><br>Anyway, S.O.P. for Origin is to basically tell their graphic artists next to nothing about the game or the environment. My friend knows the following:<br><br>His job is to draw 2 characters... one beheading the other.<br><br>That pretty much sums up about how much he knows about UO2, and he is WORKING on the project. Now from his conversations with other co workers who are hard at work on the project the current landmass 'projected' for UO2 is nothing more then concept right now. Though admitedly he (like every other GA team member) is not entirely in the know. There is nobody at his workplace who has done any work on the landmass.<br><br>I suspect if the picture is in fact an authentic picture of the UO2 landmass as St. TwiTster suggests then it is nothing more then concept art (of which 70% of which never sees the light of a consumers monitor). <br><br>Incidently given the standard 'art to pilot video' time frames from EA / OSI. And knowing that the current video is in the works... we can pretty much expect to see some form of a UO2 video clip floating around in less then 3 months.<br><br></font></td></tr></table><br clear=left><br><a name="newsitem938550266,33934,"></a>

Dr. TwisTer is certainly posting lots of UO2 info. The community consensus seems to be that it's all faked (and badly faked at that).<br><br>I haven't been able to get comment from Origin on whether or not the material in fact is legit. Rumor has it when you ask Calandryll about Dr. Twister, he replies "T2A? That's an expansion for UO, isn't it?". Then he runs away. <br><br>However, I've been told that the material Twister is posting, while once accurate, is now old news.

This rule insures that players will be more careful during gameplay, and the game experience will be far more realistic."<br><br>Character Psychology<br><br>"...Due to the intensely realistic gameplay of Middle-earth, players will be assigned a psychiatrist for psychoanalysis at the end of each gaming session. This will insure that players will be able to function normally in society after such an intense virtual experience."<br><br><br>Character Binding<br><br>"...upon entering the game newbies will be tied up and beaten into submission by veteran players frustrated by the permanent death rules. Eventually they will be released but only after paying their first 3 months of subscription fees."<br><br><br>Non-spell casting humans<br><br>"...The design team recognizes that magic IS NOT REAL, and therefore will not be represented in the game. Players will be able to perform card tricks and slight of hand, light off stink bombs, etc. but under no circumstances will we endorse any of that pansy spell casting hoo hoo in the game."<br><br><br>Realistic hobbit strength<br><br>"...Hobbits are a bunch of wimps and we know it. Hobbits in the game will hardly be worth playing due to their diminutive size, weakness, and lazy attitude, but we will put them in anyway because they are in the books. They should be easy to kill and that will be good for a laugh."<br><br><br>Elf population limitations <br><br>"...elves breed like rabbits and we just can't have that.

I know, I know. I shouldn't be giving him so much attention. Then again, I watch Jerry Springer once in a while too.

YOU did, not me. I haven't done anything as "Senith" in months.<br><br>"Yes, she likes my site, thank you for asking."<br><br>I didn't ask. Or care, actually.<br><br>"It's called humor. Look it up."<br><br>Explain how comparing an employee of a gaming company to a Party of Five regular is funny? See me laughing? No.<br><br>"Huh? This is one of those paragraphs you have to be on drugs to understand, I think."<br><br>It wasn't all that complicated, and for someone who postures themself as being so "educated" and "intelligent", I thought you'd be able to understand it easily...but here, let me simplify it for you: you are so wrapped up in yourself you think statements made about other people (in this case, Iron Will) are actually directed at you. Is that "simple" enough for your brain to digest, or shall I pass you the LSD? A quick foray into Psych 101 and English 102 would make that sentence pretty elementary...<br><br>"BURN IRONWILL! SOAK HIM IN FLAMING ACID! HAVE WEASELS CHEW OUT HIS EYES! Is that better?"<br><br>No, I never said scream his name either. I said "let it go". I just wonder why you aim your fire at me, when all I did was do the same thing you would have done: made some nasty comments public. Just like<br>you're doing now, with my last two e-mails. Your criticism is pretty hypocritical.<br><br>"Actually if you read the comments on the first story, they did enjoy reading that one."<br><br>If you really believe that they respect you for taking their praise and shoving it down their throats, you may be a little more confused than you pretend.<br><br>"Naw, it just plops in my mailbox right regularly."<br><br>Is that right? How many times is "right regularly"? Once a month? Twice a month? I wonder why people still bring it up...could it be because people like you continue to flaunt it like it's a battle flag for your cause? Maybe if you'd shut your mouth and quit talking about it for five minutes, people would forget it and let it go.<br><br>So here I am, once again, saying the same thing: let it die, and use something else to climb your way into the arms of every desperate child looking for leadership.<br><br>-"Ex-Senith"<br><br>===<br><br>OK. One thing jumped out at me, in between the attempts to talk down to me and trying to appear intellectual by adding levels of reference (for example, "Party of Five regular" instead of "Neve Campbell").<br><br>He doesn't get it. <br><br>He is still completely clueless as to what happened. He thinks he did nothing wrong. Hell, he probably thinks he should still be a smurf.<br><br><i>All I did was do the same thing you would have done: made some nasty comments public. Just like you're doing now, with my last two e-mails. Your criticism is pretty hypocritical.</i><br><br>Um, no. Let's backtrack: Senith sends an IRC log to St. TwisTer (patron saint of honesty, nobility and dupe bugz) in which GM Ironwill makes an ass of himself. GM Ironwill is then busted back down to... well, something else (rumor has it he soldiers on as a regular shard GM under a new alias). Pretty standard stuff, we see it pretty much on a weekly basis.<br><br>Here's the good part. Senith then wonders why no one at OSI likes him any more. He feels left out of the "elite" (that he himself refers to in reverential tones in the chat log - and for the record, I think Ironwill was 100% dead smack right on in his assessment of those idiots) on the Test Center. He sends more email to Twister, complaining about how UO sucks now because no one listens to him.<br><br>He turns his domain (destard.com) into some sort of weird plot to overthrow Origin's ownership of UO (You know, I really wish I was making all this up) and posts as much confidential material as he can lay hands on (which isn't much, basically the counselor's guidebook and some ways in which counselors and GMs can appear to take damage in game).

Got this note this morning. Got some comments afterward. BOY do I have comments afterward.<br><br>===<br><br>Subject: A Reply You Won't Reply To<br><br>Just a suggestion...<br><br>You may want to stop using six month old stories in attempts to garner attention for yourself.<br><br>It's beginning to look desperate.<br><br>I haven't done anything that needs mention in months, and it's kind of disturbing you still cling to MY mistake as the big fallacy, rather than the other side of the incident. Maybe all that fantasizing about LadyMOI has gone to your head, but if you remember<br>correctly, I wasn't the one insulting everyone involved with the game you're so obsessed with.<br><br>I'm just the one that decided other people needed to hear about it, just like you do, every time you post something controversial or derogatory about someone else. If I shot off a long string of obscenities at you, more than likely you'd post it on your page and pass me off as another fanatic disillusioned with his place in UO subculture. But no one would brand you as the bad guy; no, they'd offer you a Celebrity Chat on Stratics, post a link to you page on every subsite they own, and make sure to kiss your ass every opportunity they get.<br><br>But should I expect a negative celebrity to attempt to see a different side of his narrow opinion? No, I don't think so...<br><br>So I'll leave you to continue to dredge up old news in an attempt to give yourself that much longer in the UO limelight. I just hope when the karma comes around (no, I'm not talking about something you get from killing a data string in a video game), your name isn't continually dragged through the mud to make other people come out on top.<br><br>-"Senith" (and no, I don't use this name anymore)<br><br>==<br><br>OK. I think I understand about 75% of this letter (I'd understand more but I'm off the drugs now).<br><br>First. Using Senith as Durga's Dream Date was a joke. No one seriously expected to win a Dream Date with Durga (and yes, I keep repeating that phrase because I'm fond of the alliteration), thus I chose the most infamous of the ex-smurfs, ex-Senith. It was humor. It should not require this much explanation, but obviously some people are somewhat slow. (I blame our educational system.)<br><br>Second. I was not "recycling a six-month old story in a desperate attempt to garner attention for myself." I linked to the first Senith story since there is a good chance that someone who has not religiously followed this site and/or the UO community for the past 6 months has no earthly idea who now ex-Senith is. Reading anything else into that is, um, pretty damned obsessive (or at a minimum self-indulgent).<br><br>Third: I don't fantasize about LadyMOI, save that she send me more dirt on UO2. Let's get one thing real clear for the slow readers (I'll wait while you catch up - it's hard reading with your lips moving, I understand) -- I am married. Happily. LadyMOI lives in another state. Unlike most of you, I understand that these two things (well, pretty much either one independently of each other) preclude any sort of relationship. I also am under no illusions that LadyMOI has any interest in me other then gaining good publicity for her company. That's what she does. For a living. Professionally. As in "working relationship". As in "you don't hit on women you work with, you mo-ron". For all of you with a clue, I'm sorry that I have to spell this all out, but as I said, we obviously need to make some time for the slow readers to catch up.<br><br>Fourth: Regarding "shooting off long strings of obscenities." Ultima Online is a game for adults. It is rated "M". That means Mature (yet another in those long series of ironies I enjoy about this game). This website is also for adults. Occasionally I will use foul language. If you don't like it, fuck off.<br><br>Fifth: "But no one would brand you as the bad guy; no, they'd offer you a Celebrity Chat on Stratics, post a link to you page on every subsite they own, and make sure to kiss your ass every opportunity they get.". I thought being labelled a Celebrity by Stratics was such a joke, I made references to my transformation to a Puff Daddy-esque monstrosity for MONTHS. And if you don't believe me, ask my posse; they've been told to agree with anything I say. And, as regular readers of this site have undoubtably picked up on, I publish flames such as this far more often than ass-kissing. <br><br>Sixth: Just like the first time ex-Senith was a news story, I've spent WAY too much time on this. Just remember this - I don't make any money off this site, I don't really keep track of how many people show up, and I couldn't care less what you think. All this site is, is a long drawn out screed of my opinion. If you don't like it, well, you know, it's a big Internet out there, and I'm sure you can find other sites to go to.

Well, Dr. "No one scoops us! NO ONE! You hear me? NO OOOOOOOONNNNNEEEEEE!" TwisTer opened up a new <a href="http://uo2.drtwister.com/">UO2 site</a>; with a promise to make a fresh start and "not fight against OSI regarding a game that hasn't been released yet", along with a few muttered imprecations like these:<br><br><i>Several of you waited hours to see the official word, however as many of the visitors to my site noticed, there was really nothing new announced that we already didn't know about. <br><br>There are several more items that I have covered over the course of the past 8 months concerning UO2, yet I continued to get slammed for publishing false rumors. They all came true.</i><br><br>So basically, Twister wants Origin to treat him like a real, legitimate web site. You know, interviews, press release, access to developers, the works. <br><br>Of course, maybe if he wants that, he should tell his wacked out minions to quit posting brain-damaged ways to dupe by creating as much server lag as possible. It's a fair guess that Origin is not amused by sites that explain how to fuck up the shards. Maybe it's just me, but I don't think that's the way to impress folks.<br><br>He also posted a possible UO2 logo as a "l33t exclusive". Looks nice, but I'm reminded from a quote by Gordon the Tyrant that I didn't include in the interview:<br><br><i>Lum: By the way, can you guys shoot me a copy of the logo before I post the interview?

Today Electronic Arts' ORIGIN studio is<br>preparing to raise the bar one more time with Ultima Online 2 (UO2), currently under development. <br><br>"We've learned a lot about online entertainment over the past two years since we launched Ultima Online," said Jeff Anderson, vice president of development at ORIGIN and executive producer for UO2. "But, most important, we learned that we are not just making 'games' any more. We're building virtual worlds that will offer new ways for people to interact, socialize and adventure on the Internet." <br><br>Like the original Ultima Online, community building will be a top priority. UO2 will feature a full suite of community building tools including robust communication software, a comprehensive party/guild system, diverse player-owned property and detailed character customization to ensure that a thriving community emerges.<br><br>Ultima Online 2 will also captivate players with its remarkably realistic 3-D graphics engine and beautiful animation (created with state-of-the-art motion capture technology). Players will experience an online world filled<br>with richly detailed environments, deadly creatures, bizarre technologies and mysterious lands where they can adventure, role-play and build communities. <br><br>"One of our primary goals is to make Ultima Online 2 fun, exciting and accessible," said Starr Long, UO2 producer. "We're implementing an intuitive interface and easy-to-use tutorials to give players a jump-start on their adventures. We're also designing UO2 around extraordinary fiction, artwork and animation which will make UO2's virtual world in a different class from the competition." <br><br>Ultima Online 2 will also feature monsters and characters conceptualized by Producer/Director Todd McFarlane, creator of the award-winning HBO animated series, Spawn. ORIGIN is partnering with Todd McFarlane Entertainment to create an action-figure line of products based on the Ultima Online 2 world.<br><br>More information on Ultima Online 2 can be found on the Internet at http://www.uo2.com.<br><br>While Ultima Online 2 is still at least a year from completion, its groundbreaking predecessor, the original Ultima Online continues to grow and develop. The product that redefined the massively multiplayer genre currently has more than 134-thousand active subscribers paying $9.95 a month to participate. UO is now played in more than 50 countries located in every time zone. A global server network (17 production servers) and support staff are now co-located on three continents (North America, Asia, Europe). Plans are currently underway to grow Ultima Online's service even larger. In the next six months, ORIGIN will be rolling out a series of exciting new feature upgrades for current players and new players alike. <br> <br>Earlier this year, Ultima Online's popularity rose to new heights as players began to buy and sell UO accounts on Internet auction sites such as eBay. Some players have purchased UO accounts for as much as $3,000.  <br><br>ORIGIN Systems develops and publishes state-of-the-art entertainment software. To date, the company has released more than 60 titles, including the award winning Ultima, Wing Commander(tm), Privateer(tm) and Crusader series of games.

OK, before I start, let me set a few ground rules. I think you all can agree that I am far from "an OSI tool". When Origin screws something up, chances are good that thirty seconds later I've got a profanity-laden update posted exactly where the dev team can shove the poorly-tested-ridiculously-thought-out latest patch. <br><br>OK. Admit I'm right? Screw you, I don't care what you think anyway. That being said:<br><br><b>Lay off the goddam dev team.</b><br><br>In the past few hours, the peanut gallery (I can call y'all that, I got a big ol' box of peanuts right HERE) has just jumped up and down shaking that moistness out of their pants as they yell the mantras. "WHERE'S NECROMANCY? WHERE'S ALCHEMY? WHERE'S MY PK SWITCH? WHERE'S PLAYER RACES? YOU GUYS LIIIIIIIIIIEEEEEEED!"<br><br>Well, let's look at what we got. The specifics - new lands (come on, ONE of you say Britannia is too big and new lands would be somehow bad), new monster AI and new party system (OK, so they're going for the EQ market, they'd be idiots not to), and new smurfs (yeah, that one had me going yippie skip too, but someone needs to justify Durga's existence).<br><br>No new potions? No differently colored spells? Excuse me while I don't give a shit, OK? According to Sunsword's postings on the Dev Board, they've brainstormed a way to expand the world WITHOUT A NEW CD. Chew on that one, dewds and dewdettes... more land. no CD.<br><br>Run out of room on that continent? Don't worry -- we'll make more!<br><br>Of course, I'm sure there's other limiting factors -- server capacity chief among them, I suspect -- but think about it. Patches that include the equivalent of a new T2A. Remember how we all were when T2A came out? We didn't really give a crap about ostands and titans and all that happy horseshit, there were <i>new places to go</i>. The orc fort. The oasis. Terathan Keep. Sure, you probably know every centimeter of all those now, but wait until Serpent's Isle gets patched in.<br><br>And the other side of it... non-PvP zones. I admit, I will be surprised if the Dev team actually pulls this off in an exploit free manner. Everquest sure screwed it up. But that points out something very, <b>very</b> important that all of you are missing.<br><br><b>The Dev Team gets it.</b><br><br>Face it... the majority of you vets are in it for PvP. Monster AI is boring as hell... nothing can match the thrill of taking down a thinking, scheming human being. And UO, right now, is the best persistent-world implementation of platoon-level combat. REALLY. Right now all you ex-militaries are nodding your head and going "Yep." Because the things that win wars in real life - coordination, planning, training and equipment - win wars in UO. This is not to say that UO is somehow so realistic that it's good training for World War 3 or something... but the very <b>lack</b> of balance in UO PvP is what makes it more real than the competition, more exciting. You <b>can</b> be better. You can dominate. You can conquer. In EQ, by contrast, you can get to Level 50. Woop.<br><br>And the Dev team understands that this is one of UO's strong points, why it attracts the kind of player that is still playing <b>two years</b> after release, and has the kind of passion to spend perfectly good time reading crappy sites like this one. You think the Dev team wants to nerf PvP? Hell no! That would kill the golden goose! Without PvP, UO becomes like EQ, only without as much eye candy.<br><br>They get this. That's why they are getting those who <b>aren't</b> interested in PvP the hell out of your way. When that happens - I'm calling it here first - <b>kiss stat loss buh-bye.</b><br><br>But to get those who don't want to be PKd every thirty seconds out of our way, there needs to be more room. The old refrain "if you don't want to be killed by PKs, stay in town" is horseshit, and everyone knows it. No one plays UO to stay in Britain inhaling the fresh fumes of DewdZilla at the bank. Given that choice - being cattle or being prisoners - most people with sense will take the third, unspoken choice and not play. This, while possibly not bothering you, bothers Origin quite a bit, I'd guess.<br><br>So, what do you want, no more stat-loss or pretty pink potions? Think about it...

Following is a press release from the Gnomes of Austin. My comments are in <i>snooty italics</i>.<br><br><b>Coming Soon for Ultima Online: The Next 6 Months</b><br>Origin is incredibly excited to be able to announce to you the latest plans for Ultima Online. Over the next 6 months, we will be expanding and improving UO. As features become ready, they will be rolled out to the existing playerbase in regularly scheduled updates.<br><br>We&#8217;ve detailed an assortment of our plans below, and will be providing extensive information on each as they are implemented over the next six months.<br><br><br><b>Land Expansion</b><br>  While the specific details of these lands are still being formalized, they will undoubtedly bring new opportunities for housing and adventuring.<br><br><i>...and new opportunities to put new UO boxes on store shelves. Undoubtably before Asheron's Call's launch. We've seen this before, haven't we, boys and girls? Oh well, no matter WHY a new continent is implemented, it's still all good.</i><br><br><b>Options for PvP</b><br>  The addition of this land will allow us to geographically separate play styles within UO, meaning we can create areas for engaging, adventuring experiences without the element of player versus player combat. There will, of course, still be plenty of room for player versus player combat. In fact, PvP will be expanded and improved in the future.<br><br><i>...hmm. Obviously we'll need to see details of this. Picture T2A as a guard zone.</i><br><br><b>Party System</b><br>  A party system is being designed to allow group adventuring. We plan to allow you to easily share profits and resources with your party while hunting.<br><br><i>Wonder where they got <b>that</b> idea.</i><br><br><b>Improved Monster AI</b><br>We will be upgrading monsters with an improved AI to enable them to react to players in new ways, in addition to making them more challenging to defeat overall.<br><br><i>Nice theory, but can it be pulled off? We'll see. UO's current monster AI is such a joke, though, that pretty much ANYTHING would be an improvement.</i><br><br><b>Increased Veteran Player Volunteer Programs</b><br>  We expect to have over 3,000 trained Counselors, Companions and Seers in place by February 2000 to support and enhance the world of UO. Interesting in joining us? Visit our Counselor Application area for details.<br><br><i>I'd be more impressed if they said they were hiring more GMs.</i><br><br>In addition to these upgrades, we&#8217;ve planned a variety of other smaller improvements and systems for UO and will release details on these as they are finalized.<br><br><i>Included among those are Necromancy and Alchemy, which will be released in time for Ultima Online: The Fourth Age.</i><br></font></td></tr></table><br clear=left><br><a name="newsitem938029035,37091,"></a>

Taken from a multipart interview at <a href="http://www.cdmag.com/">http://www.cdmag.com/</a> - these are just the bits that relate to MMRPGs, you might also want to check the full detail for information on U9 and Ultima history.<br><br><i>On the state of UO:</i> It's a huge success. But I look at it and think it's a baby-step. There are a lot of things that are brilliant about the game, but a lot of its edges are coarse. We can do a much better game. <br><br>Origin has found itself in a unique market-leadership position. But there are a bunch of people who have realized this, and there are tons of fantasy role-playing games on the way. We keep track of them on our [internal] Ultima Online II website, and there are like over 100 massively multiplayer games coming. The vast majority are enthusiast projects that won't probably amount to much, but Sony [with EverQuest] and Microsoft [with Asheron's Call] are pretty damn big companies. <br><br>I think EverQuest is a great game, and it's doing very well, but it came out almost two years after Ultima Online, so there are some things that they've learned from us or invented on their own and done better. But I still think we measure up pretty well. Asheron's Call will be almost three years post Ultima Online, and I think it's a strong game too. <br><br>We are the majority of the market at this stage, and that obviously can't last; however, EA Sports has to work really hard to stay as the top sports line, and Origin will have to work just as hard to be the top massively multiplayer company. There's a really unusual opportunity that's not unlike us getting into the business in the first place 20 years ago. Eventually we needed to consolidate as part of Electronic Arts, but we're one of the rare survivors of getting on top early and staying there. And we're in the same situation with massively multiplayer games, and we owe it to ourselves to stay there. <br><br><i>On PKing and life lessons:</i> For example, in Ultima Online one of the big debates how to handle player killers. It would be easy for us to stop them&#8212;we could turn it off. And by the way, I've been tempted many times, because it's such a political issue.<br><br>However, rather than turn it off, I actually think it's better to make it have realistic repercussions. Going back to the bank robber example, you don't go murder people, and while there may be a lot of reasons, one is because there are serious, serious downsides. So I think it's better to make a game where you make those repercussions realistic. But I don't think every game needs to be made like this. I think it's fine to go play Diablo and waste everything in your path. But I think it's an opportunity missed, for me, to not make it such that killing another person is a bad thing not just because of the moral issues but because of the ethical issues involved with living in a society with other people.<br><br><i>On the infamous lawsuit that took place during UO's first year:</i> Ultima Online did have problems, but even if didn't people would have had opinions about every feature we put into it. It's like the real world. You have opinions about the laws of the country, and you can democratically vote. Most people don't think their vote counts, but even if they don't believe this they know they have the ability. They also know they can go to their neighborhood association to get the trash pickup changed. So on the smallest micro local level, people know they can affect change. The community leader can affect the city, the city leaders affect the country, etc. So there's this continuum of bureaucracy between an individual and the government that lets both entities communicate with each other. <br><br>Well, we created this virtual world and had hundreds of thousands of people come to live there, and there was no bureaucracy. They all knew Lord British&#8212;he's the creator, he's responsible&#8212;so a funny thing happened. Since there was no organization, people started sending me their opinions. But of course it's impossible to respond to hundreds of thousands of people, so people would hear nothing back. So they presumed we didn't care, were doing nothing, weren't listening, were unaware of problems that were causing them great strife. <br><br>Which of course was not true. We had the entire double team [of Ultima Online and Ascension members] working on the game for the year after it was released. Now we're down to a normal team. But until the infrastructure and bureaucracy evolved&#8212;game masters, counselors, senior players&#8212;people were extremely angry. <br><br>So it was an interesting sociological experiment, but I really believe we were doing everything we could do in our power to keep the game as high quality as possible. <br><br><i>On what Garriott learned from UO:</i> You never really know how hard it is to launch a virtual world until you do it, and now that we know how hard it is, we'll be more cautious. <br><br><i>Interviewer: Even EverQuest, which was able to learn from your mistakes, had a problematic launch. </i><br><br>Right. And, by the way, we thought we were in a race to the market with those guys, and they took nearly two more years. I had Electronic Arts breathing down my neck, saying "Oh my god, you're gonna lose it. They're going to get out first and be the market leader and the race will be over." So the pressure to get out because we had to was high. In hindsight, never ship a game until we're done with it. I learned the lesson with Ultima VIII, you'd think I would have learned it for Ultima Online. <br><br><i>Interviewer: What about the people that claimed there were problems in the betas that were carried over to the final product?</i><br><br>I don't think we thought we were shipping with fatal bugs. However, there were pretty good odds we'd ship with things people didn't like or we'd discover balance problems. <br><br>There is clearly a huge volume of bug complaints that are really just design issues. And we might agree, and change them over time. And as with reality, any new law can be exploited. Things emerge that were utterly unforeseen, and every time you change a law, someone finds a way to use it to their advantage. <br><br>For example, we thought towns would be safe. The first thing that happened was we had roving bands of carpenters who'd go around and build immovable chest-of-drawers that would surround people in the streets. They'd run off laughing, and the person in the middle, who wasn't a carpenter, was stuck. <br><br><i>On Everquest:</i> One of the things they did better is their combat and magic has a more visceral quality, which is a big plus. However, it isn't really a massively multiplayer persistent world. It's more of a fantasy Quake with a persistent character. <br><br>While there are some things we can learn from them, Ultima Online got slammed by the press for things that at least we attempted, and no one faults [EverQuest] for omitting it from their virtual world. It's really just a level-up game, and as fun and successful as that may be, it's not what I'm trying to build.<br><br><i>On Century 11 opening up a real estate office in Arirang:</i> I was in Korea last week watching a bunch of people playing Ultima Online in a gaming hall, they spend all of their time amassing real estate. That's their whole point in the game. I look at that and say, "I never intended for that to be in the game." That's an emergent behavior that I never foresaw. Those people could care less about the philosophical underpinnings of the world. </i><br><br><i>On Richard Garriott's next online game</I>: Starting over from scratch, that's a scary thing, and until I started getting into it, I wasn't sure I could do it. However, I have a game design over there in that folder [points across the room] that I've been working on for about two months now, and I now have regained confidence, so to speak, in myself. It's another big research problem, but I'm a devout believer that through intelligence and hard work, you can craft extremely strong fiction and content. <br><br><i>Interviewer: Is it an Ultima, or is it a different franchise?</i><br><br>What I know how to do is Ultima, so in its heart it's Ultima. In its clothing, we haven't decided what it is. It does not involve a character that's named the Avatar, it does not involve a fundamental planet called Britannia, but it is a virtual world you can explore thoroughly with lots of interactive objects, NPCs you can interact with in great detail, but it is fictionally not related. The virtues are not in it; however, it has an extremely strong commentary. So fundamentally it is an Ultima, but with a new angle. <br><br><i>Interviewer: But it probably wouldn't be an Ultima? </i><br><br>Well, what's interesting is my code name for it right now is the Roman numeral ten, or X. There are a variety of reasons in the fiction why that is relevant, but another reason I like it is because it comes after Ultima IX. That in my mind is a clear message to the people that are playing Ultimas that this is the tenth game.<br><br><i>Interviewer: With Origin's new role in Electronic Arts being focused on online play, and Ultima Online being a non-narrative, massively multiplayer game, can you do a story-based game online? </i><br><br>It's hard, but I have the answer, I believe. Let me give a description of the problem, and then my answer. By the way, I'm not going to give away some of the specific mechanics because it's an easy answer that we obviously want to be first to market with. <br><br>  <br>As I look at the strengths and weaknesses of solo play and massive multiplayer, the greatest thing about the solo game is it's a story for you. You get to be the hero, and every feature we put in the game you experience as if it were created for you and you alone. <br><br>On the other hand you do it alone, and few people that play an Ultima don't wish they could take a buddy with them. We debated whether to have Ultima IX allow up to four real players on the whole quest in a full cooperative game through the story. Marketing was all over it, players wanted it, but it just became an impractical technical impossibility, so we didn't do it. But most people want that kind of experience; however, they don't want 10,000 other people racing to the same goal. BR><br>On the other hand, the real strength of an Ultima Online is those other people. You can trade with them, you can build a house, the world is constantly evolving and changing. It's a fabulous world. But it's a terrible way to deliver a story. Even if we try to generate quests, everybody knows about it once five people have done it. We couldn't even invent enough quests for every thousand people. So it's a practical impossibility to create the same story experience in an Ultima Online-type setting. <br><br>  <br>So with X, I've put these two types of games together. For example, you start the game in what I call a homestead&#8212;a place to build your house, hang the head of the dragon you just killed, or meet up with friends and trade. When you want an adventure, instead of doing it like Ultima Online, where a thousand people are ahead of you and a thousand people are behind you waiting to do the same adventure, imagine that the adventures are individual Ultima games with multiple people. You go on these adventures that are custom-crafted from anywhere from solo player to massively multiplayer and everything between. The adventures could be like Quake Arena, where it's every man for himself. Or they could literally be solo-player Ultima IV, where you go on that adventure alone. <br><br><i>Interviewer: So in a sense, it would almost be like the chat room meeting area linking to a series of varied full games? </i><br><br>Exactly. I believe you can do all of this at once. The setting I want to use as a wrapper is not like "here's the chat room, now we enter the holodecks." I'm creating a reality into which each adventure actually fits. <br><br>===<br><br>Again, this is only a small part of the full, multipart interview at <a href="http://www.cdmag.com/.">http://www.cdmag.com/.</a><br></font></td></tr></table><br clear=left><br><a name="newsitem937950967,15022,"></a>

Apparently Ms. Mulligan had a somewhat stormy meeting with the rabble last night. Here's a recap, from someone who wishes to remain anonymous for obvious reasons. (The salient points in the letter have already been confirmed from two other sources.)<br><br>===<br><br>As I'm sure you've already heard, there was a meeting in the Seekrit E-Leet OSI IRC Seerz channel last night. Well, there's one every Monday night, but there was a special guest last night. Yes, Durga, aka the Super Top Ultimate Professional Interest Director (you find the acronym).<br> <br>Only two things were actually going to be discussed, first one, they don't want seers working on the shards they spent years getting to know, since that might actually make them more effective and useful to the community and we can't actually have seers that do something to help the shards that inspired their love for the game. It also brings up that dreaded 'abuse' word, which, being the honest and trustworthy sorts we happen to be in the seer program, we don't really worry about. BUT, it comes down from above, that our newly-less-esteemed leader has been doing this for many systems, and that this is the only way to do it. So let it be written, so let it be done.<br> <br>Of course, that's the minor issue. A little fluff to spice up the real meaty question. Open applications for Seers. Yes, I said it, they want to put a public application on the web, and should someone apply (only have to be over 18 for this one folks, have to be over 25 to telestorm, but you can spawn drakes and gold at 18) they are now run through the hoops.<br> <br>Hoop 1 - Someone actually reads the apps to remove well known losers. So if your account was flagged for something, you can give up now. Or you can get another account, that one will be clean.<br> <br>Hoop 2 - Take the r33t Seer IRC Training courses, with such advanced topics as "IC and OOC : What it means to me", and "Event Design for Dummies vols 1 and 2"<br> <br>Hoop 3 - ingame tool training on the TC! Yeah, give them powers with no experience. Bah, who cares, it's just TC anyway... right?<br> <br>Hoop 4 - Group and Individual event... on TC. If you cannot find players to play in your event, players will be provided by the Interest program at no extra charge. (Note : There will be more and vastly different classes of players on normal shards, this is really only to teach you that .pl != .ps)<br> <br>Hoop 5 - BS your way through a personal interview with an IGM, who has a large number of interviews to do after yours, and probably is tired, hungry, or just sick of interviews.<br> <br>Hoop 6 - Congratulations, should you pass, here's your robe, diploma, and full access to all Seer powers, have fun on _____ shard.<br> <br>Now, I don't know about you, but the current seers were a bit nervous about something so blatantly idiotic as this. I mean, look at the companion program. To quote, there were only 20 incidents out of 1200. This statistic provided by Durga him/herself, it may or may not be completely accurate. That's only one out of 60! Wow, .66 percent is a pretty good rating... until you consider that even one rogue seer with full powers will be an abuse incident the likes of which hasn't been seen yet. It's like setting a balloon full or red dye in a kindergarten classroom, and telling them not to touch it... then after they behave for a week, leaving them alone for a few hours. Remember, these are some of the most creative - and creatively dangerous - people in UO.<br> <br>But they are getting powers second only to GM's with 3 IRC classes, a TC class, two mini-events on TC, and an IRC interview. Just wait, there will be one smooth-talking imbecile, and they'll float through the classes. Maybe it'll even be everyone's favorite Doctor... Access Granted... self destruct in 5... 4... 3...<br> <br>And let's not even mention... oh wait, let's mention it. These decisions were already final before the IRC chat even began, and the entire 'discussion' was a sham, built out of pretty sparkles and pixiedust to blind us and make us smile and think happy-thoughts. The meeting fell victim to Volunteer PR. Everyone got a nice song and dance, and seers dropped out of the chat like they were being hit with RAID - Green Robe formula. Although it was amusing to see one mis-statement almost get a good 70% of the seers to quit on the spot.<br> <br>But, she is much more experienced, and better in every way - so that means she knows best - that was pointed out several times. Of course, after 2 months in UO as a player, she easily outranks the seers that have been doing this on the only game of this scale ever created to this date. It's not like they've been filling a new and unique role or anything, we're just insta-DM's, ready to provide simple canned quests for the mass public. Well, at least we are in her eyes.<br><br><br></font></td></tr></table><br clear=left><br><a name="newsitem937919341,67532,"></a>

As can be expected, any time I post a story with the word "counselor" in it, my in box fills up. The latest story on Queen Durga of the Blue People is no exception - right now it's running about 50-50 between people taking me to task for mocking a brave, <i>brave</i> woman and counselors saying <i>Damn, I bet we're gonna get some interesting calls now...</i>. More on this later.<br><br>Right now the subject is eBay sales and the game companies who love them. Specifically, an article in a trade publication about real-world spinoffs and what OSI is planning on doing to facilitate them, available <a href="http://newmedia.com/NewMedia/99/08/realworld/Profit_Play.html">here</a>. A salient quote:<br><br><i>"It's one of those exciting, humorous, scary things we didn't anticipate," says Ultima's creator, Richard Garriott. "This is the first truly tangible, measurable liquid exchange between a virtual and a real economy."<br><br>Parent company Electronic Arts was concerned that Origin didn't try to get a piece of the auction action. But, Garriott explains, the "total amount of money exchanged compared to our business is negligible," and he didn't want to alienate players by "trying to squeeze a few more dollars out of them." Instead, Garriott's programming team plans to add a feature to Ultima Online (UO) that would enable further e-commerce by letting players evaluate their virtual holdings so they can set fair real-world prices.</i><br><br>Another interesting and false snippet from the article is the description of a typical hardware setup for a shard - "7 <B>high-end PCs</B> plus a RAID hard drive array". Um, yeah, I'm sure that OSI goes to Costco and picks up a few Pentiums off the shelf any time they want to install a shard. In truth the last shard that ran off a standard PC was Abyss and we all remember how high-performance THAT was.<br><br>On the subject of eBay exchanges, I read elsewhere that based on the going rate of sale on eBay, the UO gold piece is worth more on the market than the Italian lira. I'm sure this amuses the Italians to no end to know that their currency is outpaced by a virtual construct.<br></font></td></tr></table><br clear=left><br><a name="newsitem937900124,64742,"></a>

The new required reading for all of us rude homophobes and spineless bottom feeders at Lum the Mad, Inc. (LUM on NASDAQ) is <a href="http://www.happypuppy.com/columns/bth/">Biting the Hand</a>, by Jessica Mulligan, aka Durga, aka the Most High Senior of Senior Counselors (MHSOSC to use the current pseudo-military terminology in fashion at Origin), which is mainly a somewhat off-key variation of the lamented and presumed late <a href="http://www.gaminginsider.com/">BitchX</a>.<br><br>Ms. Mulligan has been remarkably quiet, save a <a href="http://http://cob.xrgaming.net/intdurga.html">puff-piece interview</a> on CoB, notable only for a brave announcement that <b>hundreds</b> of new Seers were due to be enlisted (which is pretty hysterically funny, considering that OSI can't find the time to support the 20 or so they have already), but his/her column (apparently she switched genders at some point, which, to quote Seinfeld, there is, um, nothing at all wrong with that) has run for quite a while now, and it has a few snippets of interest. I'll quote them for you here, since happypuppy.com has been scientifically proven to, after long periods of exposure, turn you into a Pokemon. Take notes, class, there <i>will</i> be a test later.<br><br>First, of course, there is the warm glow of her hiring:<i><br><br>In one sense, there is some news in my personal life that will have some small effect on my writings here. If you haven't heard already, I took a job with Origin Systems, Inc. Yep, that's right, OSI, the folks who publish Ultima Online, the massively multiplayer game that I've taken to task more than once here and elsewhere. My own personal task at OSI will be to reorganize the volunteer programs, institute new ones and generally bring my experience to bear to help UO's customer service become a world-class operation. <br><br>Don't think I've missed the delicious irony of the situation. It's one thing to be separated from the situation while making pertinent, if pithy, comments; it is quite another to be told, basically, to put up or shut up. So now I am ensconced in Austin, Texas, Live Music Capital of the World, working with my crew to figure out how to make it a reality. Hey, how the heck did that happen? <br><br>I was seduced, I tell you. Gordon Walton, VP online services, and Jack Heistand, formerly CEO of TEN and now the head of OSI, sang me a siren song of support and glory and hope. They raised me to the mountaintop and tempted me with visions of incredible game service, intelligently and compassionately managed. They painted a glorious picture of what could be, if only we worked together. <br><br>And I was a weak vessel. I saw their visions and I was tempted. I wavered. I contemplated and ruminated, I anguished over it night and day.... <br><br>Okay, okay; I lie like a cheap rug. I went for it like a taxi-dancer getting a marriage proposal from the Aga Khan. I caved like it was sale time at Christian Dior and they were dangling a platinum card before my eyes. I put up the same amount of resistance that a gold-digger does in accepting a diamond necklace, i.e., none to speak of. <br><br>Come on; how often does a professional get a chance to work with the largest online game community in the known galaxy? Or to work with some of computer gaming's top-tier designers and innovators, people of the likes of Richard Garriott, Raph Koster and Rich Vogel? Or skilled online veterans such as Gordon and Jack? </i><br><br>Ah, memories. Too bad she doesn't work with Raph and Rich anymore; presumably Richard still puts in a day or two at the office occasionally. The honeymoon was shortlived of course, once she discovered homo dewdicus on the message boards: <br><br><i>And somehow, I just know this column is going to have little or no effect on them. Far from it; they'll take it as a badge of honor. After all, these people think nothing of being foul-mouthed, dishonest, racist homophobes on a daily basis. What's a little criticism from a transsexual columnist who'd like to think most people aren't foul-mouthed, dishonest, racist homophobes? I guess I'm just gay that way </i><br><br>Ms. Mulligan has been gay that way for a while, judging from her column on the same subject a year ealier:<br><br><i>And why is online gaming such a wasteland, Jessica, when just three years ago we all expected to be rich as Croesus because of it? I&#8217;m glad you asked, my friend. There are several reasons why, but certainly one of the most poignant has to be the way the disgustingly low class of today&#8217;s online gamer drives away the people who might actually spend some cash to play. <br><br>Let me give you an example of what I mean by "low class." Drop into any of the free online gaming sites, such as mPlayer or Microsoft&#8217;s Internet Gaming Zone. Just entering a chat lobby at one of these sites garners you a significant chance of viewing some variation of the following exchange: <br><br>Player One: Shut up, you pussy faggot! <br><br>Player Two: Eat sh**, dumba**! <br><br>Player One: F*** you, faggot! <br><br>Player Two: No, f*** you! <br><br>Player One: No f*** you, sh**-eating faggot-dork-loser! <br><br>And so on. Granted, you could sit in a lobby for half an hour and not see such. Or you could hit several lobbies and see it in every one. I see it happen often enough to grate on the nerves. I also happen to be a male-to-female transsexual, so use of the word &#8216;faggot&#8217; especially grates, not to mention the other Anglo-Saxonisms. <br><br>As one might guess, the players most often resorting to this kind of infantile name-calling are not very far out of diapers themselves, the 12 year old to 16 year old &#8216;demographic.&#8217; They hang out on mPlayer and IGZ because, of course, those services are free. They&#8217;d probably rather hang out where the really cool games are, such as Kesmai&#8217;s GameStorm or Simutronics&#8217; Playnet, but that takes a credit card and who wants Mom and Dad to know just exactly what they are doing with that educational Internet thingamabob, anyway? <br><br>In a way, I lay this type of behavior at mPlayer&#8217;s door. You get what you pay for, and they were the first to panic at the lack of paying subscribers and turn their service free. And, as naturally as toast falls to the carpet peanut butter side down, in rushed the unsocialized young kids who can&#8217;t afford to pay and, apparently, aren&#8217;t getting any home training in manners or courtesy. Not to say that some supposed adults don&#8217;t do this, too, but the preponderance of my experience with it has been from kids. <br><br>Again, you get what you pay for. If the consumers are willing to pay for the development of quality online games, we could see a Renaissance in the industry. If many or most of the consumers aren&#8217;t willing to pay for such development, then we&#8217;re likely to be stuck with two kinds of gaming services. Patronizing one type will be those willing to pay for quality games and a safe haven from the rude little monsters of the world. Patronizing the other will be all those unwilling or unable to pay for online games and willing to settle for second best. The digital country clubs and the cyber-slums, if you will. <br><br>And if you don&#8217;t agree with me, you&#8217;re just a great big dork-loser. So nyah! </i><br><br>So how has this warm and cuddly columnist/community commissar/lecturer in tolerance of alternative lifestyles impacted our fine, <b>fine</b> volunteer program?<br><br>Well, judging from my email in-box, by walking into situations that she has little to no knowledge of, having not technically actually played UO, I'm told -- understandable, there's a lot of kids and other folks who haven't tried switching genders yet on those servers -- and basically informing the folks who've been in the trenches trying to make the programs they're involved in work that they are without a clue, and from now on things will be done Her Way.<br><br>Of course, if you have a problem with that, you're a crude, crass homophobic male oppressor type. Oh well, I should probably quit now, since, as she put it in her very first column, <i>As the old Croat proverb says, "Tell the truth, then depart quickly."</i><br><br>By the way, Jessica, in case the happypuppy.com gig falls through, I hear TwisTer is always looking for new updaters.<br></font></td></tr></table><br clear=left><br><a name="newsitem937882782,51751,"></a>

Here's a note I recieved on the new Companion program. (No, I'm not a companion, I already do enough work pro bono.)<br><br>===<br><br>Strangely enough, I haven't seen Lum rant about UO's customer disservice program lately. Don't tell me Lum has not joyously joined the ranks of Companions about to be let loose onto the unsuspecting general public?<br><br>Don't tell me you're not itching to introduce a few dozen potential k3wld33ds into their brave new world? You're not? Well, neither am I. Not anymore anyway. Not after reading the Program Guidelines and manuals and finally finding out a thing or two about a program designed to be the ultimate in bad customer service through the exploitation of cheap and unskilled volunteer labor.<br><br>"Teams" of companions (visions of oxen under the yoke) have begun training last week. I was assigned to one of the B teams along with a handful of other European players. My SC eventually got around to mailing us the companion guidelines and then told us that, incidentally, while he wasn't really sure he had that right, well, he may be wrong entirely, better ask Bodi, could all be a rumor, but... there would be no Companion Program on the European shards for the time being. Come again? No, there will be no Companion program on the European shards for the time being. Nor will there be anything like it on the Asian shards. But we could freely choose which US shard we would like to work on...<br><br>Errrrrrr, let me put on my thinking cap here: Does that mean that OSI was recruiting European players to waste their online gaming time and money - we don't have unlimited local calls, remember? - to help newbies overseas and thereby enhance the company's image on shards those players don't know or care much about rather than have them help launch UO in Europe where there is a growing customer base that could profit from the accessibility update that introduced the program?<br><br>Yes, exactly. Why, that's brilliant! Or maybe not? Guess someone is going overboard with their non-disclosure agreements. Guess that piece of information was so s3kr33t that even the SCs couldn't be told right away, much too s3kr33t anyway to include in the original announcement.<br><br>Listen up, folks, in case it had escaped your attention: there is a landmass, a rather huge one at that, to the east of the American mainland. It's called Europe. People live there. A lot of people. And there is a landmass, a rather huge one at that along with a good many islands, to the west of the American mainland. It's called Asia. People live there. Many, many more than you ever imagined. Some of them play UO. Why, yes, they're even paying money to do it. Ah, but then you knew about the money part - you're actually counting it as we speak? Then why the F**K, I ask you, why the F**K don't you treat them as customers and not like a virtual immigrant abor force? CAN WE GET SOME FREAKING RESPECT HERE?????<br><br>Maybe it was a good thing that I haven't signed and mailed out my written agreement with OSI - I don't really expect to sign that thing anytime soon. If ever... And I haven't even said anything about compaion "duties" yet.

UO is too big.<br><br>It's got too much stuff. Just ask the dev team. Waaay too much stuff. Those Alphastations or whatever they host the servers on are just creaking updating H0K1ll3r's reg stash every morning.<br><br>So the dev team is hot on the trail of ways to fix it. I hear new rumors of what's planned almost on a daily basis. This tells me that probably they are ALL true and over in Austin, they're tacking ideas on a dartboard and aiming particularly pointy-headed GMs at them seeing what sticks.<br><br>Well, here's some really, REALLY basic ideas on how to reduce UO's item database. You guys in the Dev Team don't need to thank me or anything; just keep making those k00l sig files we all love.<br><br>Many of these suggestions involve changing cherished paradigms and other game rules we all know and love. Uh, change them. It's for the best. I also assume that stackable items are stored as one item. If they aren't, um, there's a REAL big change you can do right there.<br><br>(1) Spellbooks. A full spellbook takes up 65 items - 64 spells and the container. I suspect any mage worth their salt has a full spellbook. <br><br>Create a new item called "complete spellbook". Shade it grey so that it looks different without needing to add new artwork to the client. (Of course, new artwork wouldn't kill us, guys. Really. I download 30 MB in patches all the time on my piddly dialup modem. But let's fix things first.) Do a test every time a spell is scribed into an incomplete spellbook to see if it turns into a complete spellbook.<br><br>This cuts down the item count by 64 for every experienced mage and also makes full spellbooks a better saleable commodity on vendors.<br><br>(2) Potions. They need to be stackable. In the past it's been said that potions aren't stackable because their effect is variable.<br><br>Change it. The effect of having 200 potions multiplied by 100,000 people removed from the game world is worth losing a little garnish in game mechanics. It won't kill people to know that that GH potion heals 40 points. Really. We won't mind.<br><br>(3) Monsters. Go up to a server line sometime, by the ocean. Laugh at all the landlocked monsters stuck in the ocean flailing around. Note the lag you experience while you laugh. Wonder what it's like on server lines that aren't as accessible.<br><br>Solution - one-time monster wipe, possibly followed up by regular wipes. This will also eliminate creatures trapped in houses. Wah. Some coding wizardry would have to be done, I imagine, to preserve things that are stabled, but I imagine the dev team is up to it. In an ideal world, monster spawn would actually be coded so that they didn't spawn in the middle of the ocean or mountains or stuff, but let's not get TOO ambitious here.<br><br>(4) Housing. Too goddam many houses, full of too much stuff.<br><br>Solution - housing maintenance. Even a token amount will eliminate the log-in-refresh-house-repeat-until-sold-on-eBay. Further maintenance will make houses rarer and probably only owned by guilds; a system that is working pretty well on Siege.<br><br>(5) Rethink secure container storage (houses and banks). Weight should be unlinked from secure container storage; instead allow a given item count, and allow stacks to count as a single item. This will break fiction in allowing people to store thousands of ingots in a bank box. Newsflash - the UO fiction is pretty much shredded already. (How many GMs do YOU know that stay in character? Or even know what the term "in character" means?) <br><br>With this change implemented, many people will not even need houses. It will also encourage storage of large stacks of items instead of many smaller stacks. (I can only hope the UO programmers were not braindead enough to make stacks stored as 2 byte signed integers, but I suspect they did exactly that and item stacks will be limited to 32,767 items. Oh well. Better than nothing.)<br><br>No magic wands, but hey, every little bit helps. You could also eliminate item count significantly by wiping Great Lakes. <br><br>Only kidding. I think.<br></font></td></tr></table><br clear=left><br><a name="newsitem937804436,70915,"></a>

As Mu so eloquently updates, Archery's Call <a href="http://mu.ranter.net/asheron/acrants.html">officially sucks now</a>.<br><br>I tried a little Archery's Call this weekend before the PC blew up in my face (note to self - never install Windows 2000 ever, ever, ever again), and as Mu noted, archery just owns.

All my AC playtime has consisted mainly of wandering through spacious vistas looking for crap to kill.

Bleah.<br><br>I also played EQ for a few hours since Verant won't cancel my account until it runs out (I bet if they actually sued me they would probably cancel it immediately though) and was bored in a few hours.
