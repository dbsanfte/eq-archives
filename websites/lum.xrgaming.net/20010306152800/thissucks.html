      <p>When I started this site, I did so to have some fun and poke some fun 
      at the industry. I had never seen a &quot;fake gaming news&quot; site, and figured, 
      &quot;Since I've never seen it, I guess I'll just have to make it.&quot;</p>
      <p>I was waiting for my flight to depart Atlanta, and I came up with the 
      above idea. But what could I call it? It'd be like The Onion, which is, in 
      my opinion, the funniest Internet site there is, but it'd be about games. 
      </p>
      <p>Hmm. What would be good?</p>
      <p>After a few seconds, it just came to me. &quot;Ricky Martin.&quot; Perfect. It'd 
      be a tribute to The Onion, while being Mario's power-up. I wouldn't have 
      to worry about lawsuits because if The Onion is fake, Ricky Martin would 
      obviously be too.</p>
      <p>To this day, I still get hate mail for &quot;ripping off&quot; The Onion. Yeah, 
      The Onion is so good that it can parody others, but cannot be parodied 
      itself. If people don't like this site, I don't give a shit. Really. There 
      are a million other sites out there. Go.</p>
      <p>Now, about a year later, I have been accused of stealing graphics and 
      HTML from The Onion.</p>
      <p>This site was 100% designed in Macromedia <a href="http://www.dreamweaver.com/">Dreamweaver</a>. All the images used 
      herein are thought to be either public domain, or they fall under the 
      &quot;fair use&quot; clause, or they were taken by our staff.</p>
      <p>Monday, I found that a &quot;competitor&quot; to Ricky Martin, <a href="http://www.nationalgamereview.com/">National Game Review</a>, used 
      one of <a href="http://www.themushroom.com/legit/e399/e3babes13.html">our 
      images</a> in one of <a href="http://www.nationalgamereview.com/99.6.6/moree3.html">their 
      stories</a>.</p>
      <p>I once did a <a href="http://www.themushroom.com/mush0122/unfriendlyuser.html">parody</a> 
      of Iliad's <a href="http://www.userfriendly.org/">User Friendly</a> comic. 
      I took some of his images, took the words out, and typed in my own.</p>
      <p>Hours later, I was emailed by Iliad, who very politely asked me to take 
      them down. I did. I asked him why me doctoring his images was wrong. He 
      explained that if he lets me do it, then he has set a precedent, and then 
      virtually anyone can use his images without paying him. If we draw the 
      images ourselves, however, then we're fine.</p>
      <p>So we did.</p>
      <p>Now, I'm worried about the same thing Iliad was worried about. So, I 
      sent the guys at NGR the following email:</p>
      <p>
      <blockquote>Date: Mon, 7 Jun 1999 13:40:48 -0700 (PDT)<br>From: Kevin

      <p></p>
      <p>
      <blockquote>Hey guys,</blockquote>
      <p></p>

        at<br>http://www.nationalgamereview.com/99.6.6/moree3.html</blockquote>
      <p></p>
      <p>
      <blockquote>It was stolen directly from our Web site, and you have no 
        permission to<br>use it.</blockquote>
      <p></p>
      <p>This is what I got in return:</p>
      <p>
      <blockquote>howdy,</blockquote>
      <p></p>
      <p>
      <blockquote>we'd like to take it down, but its just too hilarious. Let 
        me introduce<br>you to the 1997 case Polydorous vs. 20th Century fox. in 
        short - &quot;While<br>broadcasters and filmmakers often obtain clearances 
        for images and<br>likenesses to avoid libel conflicts, the appeals court 
        ruling indicated<br>these are not legally required in the case of 
        fictional treatments.&quot; <br><br><a href="http://www.freedomforum.org/speech/news/971121a.asp">http://www.freedomforum.org/speech/news/971121a.asp</a></blockquote>
      <p></p>
      <p>
      <blockquote>As our friends in Degeneration X like to say, suck 
      it.</blockquote>
      <p></p>
      <p>
      <blockquote>your friends,</blockquote>
      <p></p>
      <p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>-NGR</p></blockquote>I'd like to think my letter was pretty 
      professional. Theirs was, until they said &quot;suck it.&quot; It's a bad idea to 
      use that term when someone you disagree with may want to take legal action 
      against you.
      <p></p>
      <p>So, I went to the site they cited, and sent a letter to their contact 
      person, asking how they could steal from me legally. I read the paragraph, 
      and it didn't seem to make sense to me. I got this reply:</p>
      <p>
      <blockquote>Mr. Murphy:</blockquote>
      <p></p>
      <p>
      <blockquote>Your e-mail was forwarded to the First Amendment Center's 
        research<br>department. After reviewing the case Polydoros v. Twentieth 
        Century Fox<br>Film Corporation that National Game Review references we 
        believe it to be<br>inapplicable to your situation. This case deals with 
        invasion of privacy by<br>appropriating a person's name or likeness for 
        commercial purposes. </blockquote>
      <p></p>
      <p>
      <blockquote>The situation you describe falls more into the copyright 
        area. I suggest<br>the book &quot;How to Use Images Legally,&quot; by Scott 
        Tambert. You can e-mail him<br>at Scott@PDImages.com

        Tambert has spent<br>many years researching the use of images and should 
        be able to answer your<br>question.</blockquote>
      <p></p>
      <p>
      <blockquote>I also suggest you contact the American Institute of Graphic 
        Artists<br>(http://www.aiga.org) &lt;http://www.aiga.org)&gt; . They

      involved.</blockquote>
      <p></p>
      <p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>Tiffany Villager, Research Manager</p></blockquote>So, I kindly 
      forwarded those comments to NGR, who still have not commented on it. 
      <p></p>
      <p>Then, I get an email from a fan of ours asking what we did to <a href="http://www.oldmanmurray.com/realnews.wc">Old Man Murray</a>. I went 
      to their site, and saw some them bashing us. It was just last week that I 
      had a pretty friendly email exchange with one of their staff! In their 
      trashing of us, they accused this site of stealing HTML from the 
Onion.</p>
      <p>This is what I wrote to them (and notice they didn't print this 
      letter!):</p>
      <p>
      <blockquote>It's really disappointing to me that I had some friendly 
        e-mail exchanged<br>with Erik last week and then you have to go and 
        blast Ricky Martin this<br>week.</blockquote>
      <p></p>
      <p>
      <blockquote>First off, NGR's satire of us is fine. They can run satire 
        of us all day<br>and all night long. Neither my staff or I have any 
        problems with that.</blockquote>
      <p></p>
      <p>
      <blockquote>What we do have a problem with is their use of our image. 
        They can run a<br>pic of whomever they want, as long as they legally own 
        the pic, or they<br>have permission from us.</blockquote>
      <p></p>
      <p>
      <blockquote>They don't. </blockquote>
      <p></p>
      <p>
      <blockquote>I did a parody of Iliad's User Friendly comic strip a few 
        issues ago. I<br>blindly took his art and used it on my site, changing 
        the words to the<br>comics.</blockquote>
      <p></p>
      <p>
      <blockquote>I was contacted by him within a matter of hours. He asked me 
        to remove<br>the comics, because I didn't have the right to use them. If 
        he let me use<br>them, then he sets a precedent, and then anyone else 
        could use them.<br>That's bad (for him.)</blockquote>
      <p></p>
      <p>
      <blockquote>He told me that if we draw them ourselves, then we are 
        legally in the<br>right. That's good.</blockquote>
      <p></p>
      <p>
      <blockquote>So, I took down the comics, had them drawn, and uploaded 
        them a few days<br>later.</blockquote>
      <p></p>
      <p>
      <blockquote>I do not see why I'm getting blasted by your site for 
        defending my<br>intellectual property rights. And you're reporting news, 
        so you can use<br>the picture. </blockquote>
      <p></p>
      <p>
      <blockquote>As far as the similar look of Ricky Martin and the Onion, 
        well...I did all<br>of the graphics and HTML of Ricky Martin myself, so 
        I can legally use all<br>of it.</blockquote>
      <p></p>
      <p>
      <blockquote>As for your comments on Rob Budrick's article, I'm not him, 
        so I can't<br>speak for him. He wants to write legitimately one day (and 
        I will be<br>writing for a big publication really soon), and his point 
        was that<br>companies at E3 are there for publicity, so why would they 
        be pricks to<br>anyone? </blockquote>
      <p></p>
      <p>
      <blockquote>Thank you for your time, and I really hope you can see our 
        side on this,<br>even if you disagree. </blockquote>
      <p></p>
      <p>After thinking a bit, I sent this:</p>
      <p>
      <blockquote>While it is ok that you are using the picture from our site, 
        it's not OK<br>that you have libeled my staff and I.</blockquote>
      <p></p>
      <p>
      <blockquote>Please remove the line that says, &quot;Actual Unfunny 
        site:<br>Ricky Martin (not even the stolen html is as nice.)&quot; as none of 
        the HTML<br>is stolen. The site was 100% created in Dreamweaver, with 
        some tweaks<br>done manually, by me.</blockquote>
      <p></p>
      <p>
      <blockquote>I feel like a prick, but I know my media law, and you cannot 
        say that The<br>Ricky Martin steals HTML without solid proof. And if you 
        view the HTML source<br>for both pages, they look radically 
      different.</blockquote>
      <p></p>
      <p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>&nbsp;</p></blockquote>I knew I was inviting them to make fun of me and 
      this site, but I didn't care. Isn't it weird, how NGR steals from me, yet 
      *I'm* accused of stealing?
      <p></p>
      <p>Finally, just a few minutes ago, I got this from NGR:</p>
      <p>
      <blockquote>Howdy!</blockquote>
      <p></p>
      <p>
      <blockquote>This was not a smart thing to put on your site (ed's note: 
        they are referencing <a href="http://www.themushroom.com/legit/e399/fearandloathingate3.html">this</a>):</blockquote>
      <p></p>
      <p>
      <blockquote>&quot;Ahead of me were a bunch of hacks from one of our 
        competitors, the<br>National Gaming Review. They were young and 
        frightened-looking. They<br>weren't ready for this kind of official 
        treatment. They looked around<br>nervously, like they knew they weren't 
        supposed to be in the same company<br>as such distinguished luminaries 
        such as PC Gamer, Next Generation and<br>yours truly.&quot; </blockquote>
      <p></p>
      <p>
      <blockquote>Its incorrect, the youngest person with us was 24, and the 
        'frightened'<br>bit is hilarious. You don't go to a conference with NGR 
        unless you've got<br>brass balls. Its also incorrect in that everybody 
        with us preregistered,<br>thus we didn't have to print out our badges. A 
        pretty clear case of libel<br>by your definition. As soon as your site 
        put this up about us, it the<br>became open season. The only thing that 
        is funny about you is the way in<br>which you feel that you can write 
        anything you want, and use pictures from<br>anyone you like, yet you 
        freak out so horribly when we use one picture<br>from your site and when 
        Old Man Murray says you stole the Onion's HTML. </blockquote>
      <p></p>
      <p>
      <blockquote>Do you honestly believe I am afraid that you will get the 
        law involved in<br>this? Here's your case: after Ricky Martin put up a 
        bunch of incorrect and<br>generally slanderous things about our staff, 
        NGR took one of your pictures<br>for use in a story about how game 
        companies use models to lure pathetic<br>people to their booths. The 
        picture taken is the most perfect example of<br>this phenomenon I could 
        even think of finding. We cropped the picture to<br>remove as much of 
        Burdick's face as possible, then blurred out the rest.<br>I'm sure a 
        jury will award you millions.</blockquote>
      <p></p>
      <p>
      <blockquote>You placed an article about &quot;how nobody treated us with 
        respect at E3,<br>even though you were VERY professional at the show&quot; 
        between multiple scans<br>of floor ponies with very professional 
        captions underneath like &quot;Say<br>cheese, honey. She's the only Eidos 
        girl who hasn't made Playboy. We are<br>still baffled as to why.&quot; If you 
        can't comprehend why this is hilarious, I<br>suggest you get out of the 
        humor business. Considering you guys attempt<br>to make fun of people in 
        the industry, its pretty awesome how worked up<br>you are getting when 
        somebody makes fun of you.</blockquote>
      <p></p>
      <p>
      <blockquote>Fucking with National Game Review is a really really bad 
        idea, I hope you<br>have learned your lesson. In either case the picture 
        will stay up forever<br>and ever as a little reminder to you and yours. 
        The more you attempt to<br>annoy us into taking it down, the more 
        determined I will be that it stays<br>up.</blockquote>
      <p></p>
      <p>
      <blockquote>As a close to this episode, I feel I must quote a good 
        friend of mine<br>with, &quot;suck balls, palsy sow.&quot;</blockquote>
      <p></p>
      <p>Well, obviously, we were not libeling them because that whole article 
      was full of half-truths. It's not our fault you have to have a 
      reading-comprehension above most third graders to understand what's going 
      on.</p>
      <p>So, why have I written this? Well, I feel a need to defend this site. 
      Our writers do a damned good job, I think. And we're the only satire site 
      headed by a true journalist (just ask any of the other webmasters where 
      they got their Stylebook, and see if they even know what you're takling 
      about.) </p>
      <p>We've been accused of stealing ideas and bits and pieces of other 
      stories as well. Rest assured, it's never happened. I've had my work 
      stolen before, and I know what it feels like. Neither my staff, nor 
      myself, would ever do that to anyone else, ever.</p>
      <p>The other thing is that I wanted to show you how unprofessional 
      everyone else is to us. I will admit, I've let my emotions get the better 
      of me in some of my email exchanges with NGR and OMM, but only after 
      they've been completely unprofessional with me first. </p>
      <p>Obviously, both NGR and OMM have no respect for copyright or libel 
      laws. That's sad, because when they want legitimate work, they won't be 
      able to get it. But then again, if we, like Edd Schneider at NGR, didn't 
      use our names on this site, we might be more tempted to disregard others' 
      intellectual properties.</p>
      <p>So, I wanted to let all of you who got here from OMM know the truth. 
      I've tried to balance it here. I think I've presented both sides of the 
      argument, and I really want to know what you think. Drop me a line, only 
      if you can be halfway intelligent about it. </p>
      <p>It's really discouraging. I didn't start this site to make enemies, I 
      did it because I genuinely wanted to show my love for this industry and 
      the people in it, and I show my love for people by making fun of them. It 
      may be twisted, but it's me.</p>
      <p>So, there's the whole story. Now, I'm getting back to my life for a 
      while.</p><!-- #EndEditable -->
