      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><i><font size="2">This is the
      first in a five part discussion on current problems and proposed solutions
      in </font></i></font><i><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">massively
      multiplayer online role-playing games (MMRPGs).</font></i></p>
      <P><font face="Arial">Let's begin our discussion with a few archetypes of
      online game players. 
You may fit in more than one; hell, I suspect I fit in all of them.</font></P>
      <P><font face="Arial"><B>The Combatant: </B>This player sees his preferred
      game (almost always, UO) as a test of skill. He is, almost without exception, interested only in the 
PvP aspect of the game; the AI of the monsters in UO are a joke and he sees 
nothing "fun" about standing on a cliff and EV'ing demons all night. (He tried
      EQ, but returned it three days later.) He doesn't 
consider himself a PK, although there may be times when he has killed players in 
dungeons who thought he was. He's a hunter; and the best hunters always seek the 
most dangerous prey. </font></P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><font face="Arial"><B>What does the Combatant think is 
good about the game(s) he plays? </B></font></P>
<P><b><font face="Arial">UO: </font></b><font face="Arial">The Combatant is almost always in a guild of other players, 
people he considers friends and spends a good deal of time with, inside and 
outside the game (IRC, ICQ, face-to-face get-togethers, etc.). By co-operating 
with his guild mates, and acting as a coordinated team in battle, in a 
persistent, constant test of skill against hundreds of other like-minded 
individuals, he feels that UO offers a playing experience unlike any other on 
the market today. The recent Siege Perilous shard (a special shard designed for
veteran players with especially difficult combat and economy aspects), the
Combatant feels, was tailor-made to what he looks for in an online game, and
despite the subsequent problems it is almost always the shard he plays on
exclusively, to the point of giving up well-established characters on other
shards.</font></P>
<P><font face="Arial"><b>EQ</b></font><b><font face="Arial">: </font></b><font face="Arial">The Combatant
found very little to like about EQ. It wasn't his game. </font></P>
<P><font face="Arial"><B>What concerns the Combatant about the game(s) he plays? </B></font></P>
<P><b><font face="Arial">UO: </font></b><font face="Arial">The main concern of the Combatant right now is probably the reputation 
system, which he feels unfairly victimizes those who engage in PvP. While the 
guild and chaos/order systems attempt to repair the damage the rep system 
inflicts, the guild combat interface is byzantine to the point of 
ridiculousness, and chaos/order battles almost always devolve into who has the 
most allied "uninvolved" healers. Many combatants exploit the rep system to 
report murders whenever possible, so as to deny their opponents time in game. 
With the new strictures against macroing, the Combatant is concerned that he is 
being shunted towards the Red PK/stat loss door against his 
will.</font></P><P><font face="Arial"><b>EQ</b></font><b><font face="Arial">: </font></b><font face="Arial">The Combatant
was unhappy with EQ. The PvP system was generally poorly thought out, and the
level limits on who could attack who encouraged newbie killing while limiting
true guild to guild combat. Due to EQ's harsh restrictions on co-existing 3rd
party programs such as IRC and ICQ, the Combatant finds EQ's guild structures to
be sorely lacking.&nbsp; What information has been released about Tallon Zek
(the new &quot;Race War&quot; PvP server) does little to convince him that EQ
has a place for him.</font></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><font face="Arial"><B>The Lewter: </B>This player wants 
to win. The score is kept in many ways: number of houses/castles, the best
equipment possible, cash on 
hand, reagents, whatever. She seeks to gain "lewt" with a minimum of effort and 
fuss. Since players always carry more "lewt" then monsters, players are thus her 
target.</font></P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><font face="Arial"><B>What does the Lewter think is good 
about the game(s) she plays? </B></font></P>
<P><b><font face="Arial">UO/EQ:</font></b><font face="Arial"><B> </B>The Lewter doesn't think about the game that much. "It's Just A 
Game" The Lewter may well be in a guild, but her ties to the guild usually 
aren't as strong as other player types.</font></P>
<P><font face="Arial"><B>What concerns the Lewter about the game(s) she plays? 
</B></font></P><P><b><font face="Arial">UO: </font></b><font face="Arial">The Lewter is quite unhappy with the rep system, since the penalties for 
killing another player are now greater then the benefit of the lewt that he 
carries. The Lewter feels that he is unfairly targeted by OSI; when the Lewter 
was a thief, thieving was nerfed; then the ping-pong murder counts made Blue 
PKing impossible. The Lewter talks quite often about quitting 
UO. The Lewter was distinctly unimpressed by Siege Perilous' release, since
there is no way to rapidly build a character to mastery.</font></P><P><font face="Arial"><b>EQ:
</b>The Lewter is generally happy with EQ, although the recent Lore Item patch
put something of a dent in her spawn camping. Although the design of EQ means
that she is hunting monsters now exclusively instead of players, this hasn't
even registered with her - to her, that is just where the most lewt happens to
be.</font></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><font face="Arial"><B>The Roleplayer: </B>This player 
sees the game that he plays as a role-playing game. He is almost always in character and can be at 
times indistinguishable from an NPC.</font></P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><font face="Arial"><B>What does the Roleplayer think is 
good about the game(s) he plays? </B></font></P>
<P><b><font face="Arial">UO:</font></b><font face="Arial"><B> </B>The Roleplayer is almost always a fan of the Ultima game 
series and enjoys the immersive factor of a persistent Britannia. He is also a 
veteran of paper-and-pencil role-playing games and seeks to transfer that 
experience to this new and experimental milieu, which almost always involves 
participating in/running quests. The Roleplayer often seeks to become a member 
of the UO support team so that he can facilitate these quests ("become the 
dungeon master").</font></P>
<P><font face="Arial"><b>EQ: </b>The Roleplayer on EQ is almost always a
disaffected UO Roleplayer. He moved to EQ because of the PK switch which
prevented random victimization. </font></P>
<P><font face="Arial"><B>What concerns the Roleplayer about the game(s) he
plays? </B></font></P>
<P><b><font face="Arial">UO:</font></b><font face="Arial"><B> </B>The Roleplayer is angered by those who seek to interfere with his game, 
be it by attacking them when they have no desire to engage in PvP or by simply 
standing around during quests making smart-alecky OOC comments. The Roleplayer 
feels that OSI spends entirely too much time catering to PvP players (spending 
development efforts on combat systems, etc.) and not nearly enough time 
developing the underlying plot structures behind the game and the mechanisms for 
carrying these out.</font></P><P><font face="Arial"><b>EQ: </b>The Roleplayer is
concerned about the lack of drama and persistence within the EQ world. Although
Norrath has a rich background story, this is almost completely ignored by
everyone else within the game, a fact which vexes the Roleplayer to no end (some
have resorted to hectoring other players unmercifully in /shout channels to
&quot;keep it in /ooc&quot;). The Roleplayer is almost always interacting more
with the game system itself (especially as manifested in the Quest system) then
with other players. </font></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><font face="Arial"><B>The PK: </B>This player sees the game as 
an arena that she can dominate. She is strong, others are weak, and she has no 
problem with showing the results of this equation in action.</font></P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><font face="Arial"><B>What does the PK think is good 
about the game(s) she plays? </B></font></P>
<P><b><font face="Arial">UO:</font></b><font face="Arial"><B> </B>The PK is without fail in a guild of other players (solo PKs tend 
to die quickly). The "brotherhood" of this guild relationship is similar to that 
of the Combatant, albeit not as well organized usually, since PKs tend to target 
those who don't fight back. Many PKs (although by no means all) take a perverse 
enjoyment from causing pain and suffering to other players. The PK is attracted
to Siege Perilous because of the lack of stat loss, although the hunting grounds
aren't as rich since most on Siege Perilous are experienced Combatants.</font></P>
<P><font face="Arial"><b>EQ: </b>The PK generally isn't that fond of EQ, since
the PvP switch protects most of those who are weaker than she. The pvp only
servers (Rallos Zek and Tallon Zek) are somewhat better, although the weak pvp
system within EQ serves as a deterrent here as well.</font></P>
<P><font face="Arial"><B>What concerns the PK about the game(s) she plays?</B></font></P>
<P><b><font face="Arial">UO:</font></b><font face="Arial"> Two words: rep system. The PK also feels that the Roleplayers in UO are unfairly 
the "favorites" of the GMs and OSI. Because of this, many PKers target 
Roleplayers whenever possible (it helps that many Roleplayers have little or no 
PvP fighting skills) and the hatred Roleplayers feel towards those that PvP is 
increased. Because of recent punitive measures towards PKs (including the mass 
banning of a particularly antisocial PK guild) many PKers are discussing leaving 
UO en masse or already have.</font></P><P><font face="Arial"><b>EQ: </b>The PK
dislikes most of EQ's pvp systems, especially level limits. The looser level
limits on Tallon Zek may be of help to her here. Overall, however, most PKers
who have left UO for EQ have eventually returned to UO. </font></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><font face="Arial"><B>The Hunter: </B>This player enjoys 
fighting monsters ("PvM"), usually as part of a group.  </font></P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><font face="Arial"><B>What does the Hunter think is good 
about the game(s) he plays? </B></font></P>
<P><b><font face="Arial">UO:</font></b><font face="Arial"><B> </B>The Hunter enjoys the cooperation involved in building characters 
and taking on the strongest monsters. The introduction of T2A probably saved 
thousands of Hunters from leaving UO out of boredom, as most Hunters now band 
together to take on the strongest creatures there (Terathan Keep, Ice Dungeon, 
etc.) Many Hunters are in guilds although quite a few Hunters operate 
solo.</font></P>
<P><font face="Arial"><b>EQ: </b>The Hunter thoroughly enjoys EQ. Everquest has a PK-switch in 
place that prevents Hunter victimization and Everquest in general is optimized 
for the Hunter style of play. By now he has a group of friends of approximately
his level with whom he hunts on a regular basis. </font></P>
<P><font face="Arial"><B>What concerns the Hunter about the game(s) he plays?</B>
</font></P>
<P><font face="Arial"><b>UO: </b>The Hunter dislikes being attacked by PKs/Combatants while hunting; his 
skills are usually not as finely tuned as the other two groups and thus takes a 
beating at their hands, losing the valuable equipment he was using in the 
process. (Lewters especially love to take down a group of Hunters for this 
reason.) Many Hunters have left UO for Everquest.</font></P><P><font face="Arial"><b>EQ:
</b>The Hunter is in general happy with EQ, although the overcrowding at popular
spawn points (&quot;camping&quot;) is an irritating problem. The Hunter
generally is familiar enough with the game to avoid the worst campgrounds,
however.</font></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><font face="Arial"><B>The Merchant: </B>This player is a 
vital part of the economic system of her preferred game (almost always UO), be it via operating vendors, working 
trade skills, or (often) both.</font></P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><font face="Arial"><B>What does the Merchant think is 
good about the game(s) she plays? </B></font></P>
<P><b><font face="Arial">UO:</font></b><font face="Arial"><B> </B>UO is without a doubt the only game in town for the Merchant. 
No other online system offers such a comprehensive system of player-driven 
economic supply and demand. The Merchant may have tried Everquest briefly, 
attracted by the presence of a PK-switch, but quickly returned to UO as 
Everquest's trade skills are in an extremely primitive state.</font></P>
<P><font face="Arial"><b>EQ: </b>There is almost nothing to attract the Merchant
to EQ beyond the existance of a PK switch which prevents her victimization.</font></P>
<P><font face="Arial"><B>What concerns the Merchant about the game(s) she plays? </B></font></P>
<P><font face="Arial"><b>UO: </b>The Merchant wishes PKs/Lewters would just LEAVE HIM ALONE while
she 
mines/lumberjacks/whatever. She is tired of being virtual cattle. If Everquest 
ever improves its economic/trade skill system there is a very real possibility 
the Merchants will abandon UO en masse...</font></P><P><font face="Arial"><b>EQ:
</b>...however, there is very little chance of this ever happening. The Verant
dev team is openly hostile to Merchants. Profitable trade skills are viewed as
&quot;loopholes&quot; which are quickly closed. There is currently no trade
skill which does not heavily penalize the Merchant financially, and there is no
logical reason save roleplaying for any character to use any of them.
Interestingly, the Merchant is the only archetype actually warned away in the
game's advertising -- early print ads for Everquest began with &quot;If you want
to bake bread, play Ultima Online...&quot;, with the unspoken assumption that
few would want to do so.</font></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><font face="Arial"><B>The Socialite: </B>This player 
plays to meet new people, make friends, and interact with them 
online.</font></P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><font face="Arial"><B>What does the Socialite think is 
good about the game(s) he plays? </B></font></P>
<P><b><font face="Arial">UO/EQ:</font></b><font face="Arial"><B> </B>Socialites are often Roleplayers as well, or associate with 
them often. The Socialite enjoys meeting people in the popular in-game social 
haunts (player taverns, etc.). Often the Socialite takes online friendship 
offline, and  there have been many real-life weddings facilitated by UO</font></P>
<P><font face="Arial"><B>What concerns the Socialite about the game(s) he plays? </B></font></P>
<P><b><font face="Arial">UO/EQ:</font></b><font face="Arial"><B> </B>Not much (if he is
PKed, he can still talk as a ghost), although he 
finds most of the other archetypes somewhat rude.</font></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><font face="Arial">So we have seven completely different 
player groups, all of whom have completely different reasons for playing, who 
are often at cross purposes with each other. No wonder we can't stand each other 
in game!</font></P>
<P><font face="Arial">So the question would be - how do we 
keep EVERYONE happy and peaceful. I think to look at the answer to this, we need 
to look at the real world, since online games often act as a mirror - a broken mirror, but a 
mirror - to our own world. Here's a long thought piece from a friend with some 
experience in the matter on crime and socialization --</font></P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I><font face="Arial">Here are my opinions on some of the 
issues you have just brought up.<BR><BR>1) Online 'relationships': These can 
remain in game (in character) or they can extend beyond that realm into reality. 
I know people who have met online and are happily married. I also know some 
terrible stories of online relationships. My belief is that it is much easier to 
have the ability to turn off and on a 'relationship' when it is over a computer. 
It is a lot less complicated to carry on these types of relationships and often 
(despite how individuals feel) there is a lot that you cannot get to know about 
the person on the other side (idiosyncrasies). I have several close online 
friends who I know a lot about. Even so, online forums really only allow for a 
limited degree of communication (For instance there is no 'online' body 
language). In many cases these people enjoy the anonymity and convenience of 
being online.<BR><BR>As one last comment in this regards: it is much easier to 
do little nice things for people online then in real life (take sending a card 
for example). A lot of little differences add up quickly :-)<BR><BR>2) 
Socialization Online: It is easier to come to know others (and even grow 
'close') because of several social differences between the environments. These 
differences are:<BR><BR>    a) Common interests: (we are all on computers :-P)
IRL: you may not find a common grounds as easily and thus it is harder to meet 
people.<BR><BR>    b) Anonymity: I can log on under a different name and behave 
totally differently. My actions as 'another person' would not really reflect on 
me due to the anonymity of being online. I can pretend to be anyone. In fact I 
could be a female and nobody really knows it (except for my ToM friends who have 
met me in real life). For instance my girlfriend prefers to play male characters 
because she finds it is easier to be treated normally online.<BR><BR>    c) 
People are bolder: they are willing to often break the 'shell' of 
uncomfortability that sometimes with holds them in real life. This in many 
respects relates to the above point.<BR><BR>    d) Smaller communities: Many of 
us are used to existing in very large communities (cities and the like) where 
you can go down town and not see anyone you know. An online community is not 
like that in some respects. They are most often a lot smaller. Take a shard like 
Great Lakes, there must be 30,000 different people (not characters) that play on 
Great Lakes. Everyone knows someone that knows you *grin*. I cannot go anywhere 
on Great Lakes without running into someone I know. Now these smaller 
communities allow for greater socialization. For instance crime rates in smaller 
communities are significantly reduced per capita to larger metropolitan 
areas..<BR><BR>So my final comment in reply to your statements is an explanation 
of 'crime' and why it is so much higher per capita in an online forum then in 
real life. It really has very little to do with consequences or punishment and 
crime. Detailed studies show that 10% of people are true 'honest' people who 
would never (ever) commit a crime even if they could get away with it. 10% of 
people are true criminals, they will commit an offence in hopes of getting away 
with it because that is their mentality. 80% of people are opportunists: where 
they normally would not commit a crime unless an opportunity presented itself 
where they strongly felt they could get away with it. Many people are good 
people in nature and not criminals by any means. Yet they still fit into this 
80% opportunist category. It is a difficult thing to admit, but let me give you 
an example here quickly:<BR><BR>Someone receives a dozen boxes of cookies for 
their company. On the sheet it says "12 boxes of cookies" but when they make a 
physical count there are 14 boxes of cookies. Its not a big deal, the cookie 
company over shipped the boxes of cookies. 2 boxes of 'missing' cookies are not 
worth tracking down in the system and it isn't your companies fault that your 
supplier over shipped you. You open up one (or 2) of the boxes and share a few 
cookies with your friends.<BR><BR>It is almost as if it is a socially acceptable 
crime. Another example would be speeding. People will speed if they think they 
can get away with it. If they believe they will be caught they will not 
speed.<BR><BR>Now I have said all this to point out that in games like UO the 
opportunity exists. In fact it exists so often that it has almost become the 
social norm (this is where things become interesting, more on this in a bit). So 
in reality, due to the nature of an online forum 90% of the people you come 
across will have a certain degree of 'criminality' to them. If someone found the 
front door to my house (in UO) unlocked, I bet you 9 out of 10 people would loot 
the house. They don't know me, its my fault I left the door unlocked etc etc. So 
while there are many advantages to an online forum, people seem (and often are) 
more shallow towards each other. The mentality is dog eat dog and the 
environment will always be like this as long as the 'opportunity' 
exists.<BR><BR>Sorry if my rant went on for too long. 3 1/2 years of criminology 
waiting to escape here. If I could offer 1 piece of advice to a company that is 
considering creating an online environment. I would suggest that they hire a 
criminologist to review this very situation and come up with some solutions that 
address these issues:<BR>- Anonymity<BR>- Opportunity<BR>- Community<BR>- Online 
Penalty<BR><BR>No truly successful society will ever exist (online or not) until 
someone can address these issues and offer solutions in regards to them. I 
suspect we could come up with a reasonable set of ideals and solutions for the 
above listed issue's if that was something that we as a group were interested in 
chasing (be forewarned this is a HUGE task).<BR><BR>As Raph Koster said in reply 
to my essay on Anonymity and crime (back about this time last year) "I agree 
with you, its a tough nut to 
crack"<BR><BR>-Tal'Mah'Ra<BR></font></I></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><font face="Arial">And, from the other side, here's 
another example, posted without judgement;</font></P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I><font face="Arial">IDIOCY IN ROLEPLAYING - OVER 
ABUSIVE GMS - TOO GODDAMN MANY ROLEPLAYING FANATICS</font></I></P>
<P><I><font face="Arial">Lately there was a Quest involving 
a GM played character who was killed by some kind of evil force and taken over 
in a new form. On a sunny Tuesday afternoon, I was going to the YMCA of Sonoma 
to pick a fight with a few of the local goers... {Hey I pk and I admit it, get 
over it} When I got there I saw a few guys entering a gate I followed.. well I 
was greeted by this ugly bastard {GM} who was playing this Dark One character... 
well his roleplaying fanatics attacked me. 12 or so of them jumping me 
constantly. Regardless of odds against me, I was having a ball. These idiots 
were going gray attacking me, so he easy kills. They were all Mace fighters, and 
I being a GM Fencer/Tactics/Master Hiding, made quick work of these idiots... 
well after these pinheads all died.. I proceeded to kill the GM played 
character, who is invincible. {lol yeah right} After I waxed him I proceeded to 
collect my loot from the corpses. Well some of the more idiotic roleplayers got 
mad saying I looted then, when a lovely thief managed to beat me to the punch. I 
was then placed as a outcast to all of the RolePlayers of UO and pretty much 
everyone on Sonoma. Yeah you know who I am now don't you? Darklight of the MBR 
guild. So I go to the YMCA to explain what happened and these jerks kept 
attacking me, and if you know the YMCA pretty well, you know guards aren't far 
away. They just kept comming and so did the guards {and the loot}  Then these 
quote unquote fanatics called me immature, and a grief player, as well as 
spineless, because I refused to leave guards when they all challenged me to a 1 
on 1 fight.. and I mean all of them. Every single guy there.  now momma didn't 
raise no fool, there was no way in hell I was going to leave guards.  Well after 
several deaths and the  death of my horse.. I eventually was killed.. awww pity 
me. But out of it I got a ton of resist and parry from these idiots.  After a 
while the Owner of the YMCA comes out to talk to me.. I explain my story to them 
that I was a guy who fell into a quest with a ton of idiots. {I didn't put it so 
bluntly though} She apologized as did I. And we all kissed and made up.  But 
still I am being hounded by these morons who actually think they can beat me 
with their expert mages and master swordsman.. *Sigh* Some people will never 
ever ever learn.<BR><BR>- Darklight</font></I></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
