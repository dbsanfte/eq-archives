        of Mondain, an evil/roleplaying/pvp guild that is established on several

      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>Crime and Punishment</b></font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Our society's criminal justice 
        system has been based upon this theory. Some people believe that punishments 
        are a little on the weak side; others believe a little on the harsh side. 
        The fact is that a fairly well (and yet still imperfect) system is in 
        place today that draws a correlation between punishment and crime. Before 
        we begin this topic, I would like to qualify an analogy for everyone. 
        OSI is a police force; in every regard the description of OSI's GMs in 
        fact make them one of the first operational 'virtual' police forces. After 
        the comparison is made between the two, we will equate the offense of 
        macroing to real life offenses that we believe are similar. Then we will 
        also draw the similarities and differences between the punishments of 
        these real life offenses, and macroing in Ultima Online.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>OSI has its own police force</b></font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">A police force is a recognized 
        body that enforces and protects the 'laws' of society. Ultima Online is 
        a community and thus has its own social norms. These social norms in many 
        regards reflect real life society, though in a few ways they differ (see 
        Lum's write-up on the <a href="abm2.html">broken mirror</a>). OSI implements 
        rules (Laws), and they additional enforce these rules. OSI is the governing 
        body of the Ultima world and like all governing bodies they hire policing 
        forces of the world they govern (a la GMs). In real life, police use their 
        discretionary powers to decide for each situation what is acceptable within 
        the law. In effect GMs fulfill this role within UO today. GMs are OSI's 
        police force; GM's ensure that the rules and conducts of Ultima's governing 
        body (OSI) are adhered too.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>Macroing vs &quot;Real Life&quot; 
        offenses</b></font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The social norms for our virtual 
        society are drawn from those of our real life society. To best understand 
        where unattended macroing falls in the scale of reasonable crimes and 
        offenses, we must attempt to closely compare macroing to a common offense 
        in today's society. When you are macroing you are effectively automating 
        a task that was intended to be manual. In effect, you are artificially 
        accelerating the advancement of your character. You are 'speeding' in 
        the virtual world. Macroing gets you somewhere faster. To some degree 
        it affects those around you, and in some cases it negatively affects those 
        about you (as was seen in macro-mining). All of these aspects relate to 
        someone speeding on one of today's highways. It seems as though as many 
        people macro as those who speed. It is fairly common knowledge that the 
        majority of people speed in real life (70% of people in fact speed regularly). 
        Speeding is an offense in most states and provinces of North America. 
        Macroing is an offense within the Ultima world. These two offenses are 
        likely as closely related as any virtual and real life offense could be. 
        Speeding in our society is a social norm, so is macroing. It is a socially 
        accepted offense in most cases. Though it is an offense none the less.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>Punishment and Crime</b></font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Having a fairly similar comparison 
        between an online offense and virtual offense we can see the disparity 
        of their punishments. When you speed you are fined, if you speed again 
        you are fined again. Depending on where you live, if you continue to speed 
        and get caught (6 or 7 times) your driving license can be placed under 
        probation. This process continues for some time to establish what sort 
        of driving record someone has. On a scale it would appear that someone 
        who speeds is more then an inconvenience to others about them. Speeders 
        in fact, place the lives of those around them at some degree of risk. 
        Higher speeds increase the risk to those about you. Macroing is more of 
        an inconvenience and perhaps less severe of an offense. Though as with 
        speeding, we see an offence and understand the possibility of punishments 
        when caught. When someone is caught for macroing, they are suspended from 
        Ultima Online for a 24-hour probation period. Upon their second offense 
        they are never allowed to play Ultima Online again. Now given the nature 
        of the offense, this punishment seems severe. Macroing is a rather victimless 
        offence, as is speeding in many cases. Yet the punishment for macroing 
        is swift and severe. To quote a famous criminologist, "the punishment 
        must fit the crime". In this case our social norms dictate that the punishment 
        for macroing is too heavy handed for the offense.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>What we think vs What they 
        think</b></font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">When you are pulled over by 
        a police officer, you often find yourself asking, &quot;Don't you have 
        something better to do?&quot; This is exactly the case with OSI GMs banning 
        people who macro. While the GMs have an intense workload, they have to 
        add macroers to their list of 'criminals'. Many police officers see speeding 
        as an individual's choice to break the laws. The laws are known, signs 
        with posted speed limits are in place. Despite people's offense to proclaim 
        their innocence, there are not many excuses that legitimize speeding. 
        This is also how GMs perceive macroing. We have all been warned not to 
        do it. Yet 70% of us still continue to insist upon breaking the law. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Their line of thinking is that 
        after they catch and ban 10% of us people will stop macroing. Many of 
        us think that we would rather macro 'carefully' and reduce the risk of 
        being caught. Everywhere you go the majority of people you talk to will 
        tell you to macro carefully. The same goes for speeding. When people are 
        young they speed everywhere. Like the fools they are, they blow right 
        through nicely identifiable speed traps oblivious to the 4 police cars 
        sitting in plain sight. As they get older and pay off a few hefty fines 
        they quickly realize the difference between a smart speeder and a foolish 
        speeder is about 3 years and 500 dollars. The question of never speeding 
        again is almost never asked. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">OSI's position is exactly that 
        of our traditional police forces. Break the will of the macroer (or speeder). 
        </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">However, Americans (and those 
        evil Canadians, thank you South Park) are a very stubborn breed who are 
        used to getting their way. One man cannot break the will of a thousand; 
        it's simple mathematics. OSI cannot and will not ever catch or ban enough 
        macroers to break the will of those who choose to remain and macro. North 
        American police forces will never abolish speeding. Any attempt to do 
        so will fail miserably and bitterly only causes a rift to be formed between 
        the policing force and the public.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>What to do</b></font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Many years of study and frankly 
        billions of dollars have been spent on coming up with a solution to this 
        problem. Not even OSI's budget is big enough to solve this problem. If 
        they did come up with a viable solution to this problem they would quickly 
        find themselves sought out by law enforcement agencies around the world. 
        The solution is not to alienate the general masses while attempting to 
        resolve or reduce the problem. Fines against a socially accepted offense 
        will reduce that the offence to some degree but not significantly. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The more heavy the fine, the 
        greater the rift between the governing body and those they govern. The 
        key is to make speeding (or macroing in our case) counter productive. 
        There is an extensive paper written on this subject that was followed 
        and adhered to by an New Zealand police force. In order to make speeding 
        counter productive you remove the benefits from speeding. People speed 
        to thrill seek and/or to save time. In one district of New Zealand (my 
        apologies to the NZ'ers out there but I don't recall the place from memory), 
        they catch and fine speeders (it's a modest and reasonable dollar fine). 
        Then they give the individual 2 options. Drive to the police station and 
        pay the fine immediately or it increases dramatically. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Well it likely takes 30 minutes 
        out of someone's life to drive to the police station and pay a 45 dollar 
        fine. Yet if they fail to pay the fine within the following 24 hours it 
        becomes a 500 dollar fine. Of course 99% of people pay the fine within 
        24 hours. The key here is not the fine but the inconvenience of the 30 
        minute trip to the police station to pay the fine. Within 6 months of 
        this traffic fine system being implemented, the speeding rates were reduced 
        by approximately 30%. Now while that may not seem like an incredible amount, 
        it stands as the most dramatic affect on speeding rates within the world 
        today.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">If I were OSI what I would 
        do is make macroing counter effective. How would I do this? </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Well, I wouldn't ban people 
        for starters. Banning players is quickly developing a rift between OSI 
        and their 'tax payers'. In fact most systems of punishment for a crime 
        of this type will cause undue friction between GMs and their player base. 
        A system needs to be in place where macroing is made counter productive 
        to some degree. In order to advance this line of thought I will list 3 
        possible solutions to accomplish this goal.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">1) Stay as we are and ban players 
        in increments. (good) <br>
        a. - 1st offense is a warning <br>
        b. - 2nd offense is a 24 hour ban <br>
        c. - 3rd offense is a 72 hour ban <br>
        d. - 4th offense is a 1 week ban <br>
        e. - 5th offense is a permanent ban </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">2) Reduction in skills and 
        or stats (better) <br>
        a. - 1st offense is a warning <br>
        b. - 2nd offense is a 1% reduction in top skill <br>
        c. - 3rd offense is a 5% reduction in top skill <br>
        d. - 4th offense is a 5% reduction in all skills <br>
        e. - 5th offense is a permanent ban </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">3) Ultima Lore Quiz (Best) 
        : a number of random ultima lore questions. Multiple choice (if you get 
        an answer wrong it tells you the correct answer and makes you select the 
        correct multiple choice answer before you continue to the next answer) 
        <br>
        </font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> a. - 1st offense is 
        a warning <br>
        b. - 2nd offense is a 25 question multiple choice <br>
        c. - 3rd offense is a 50 question multiple choice <br>
        d. - 4th offense is a 100 question multiple choice <br>
        e. - 5th offense is a 100 question multiple choice (and will continue 
        to be 100 questions for each following offense).</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">How this works: People caught 
        macroing will not be able to log onto the game until their penalty-boxed 
        character has filled out their quiz. The quiz itself is ultima related 
        and depending on how many questions you have to answer will take from 
        10 minutes to an hour of your REAL LIFE, non-macroable time. (Use the 
        tinkering menu and have the boxes to check the answer appear in slightly 
        different locations). Macroing becomes counter productive. If you have 
        to answer a 1 hour questionnaire every time you log it is likely you will 
        macro less. Again abolishing macroers is not the goal here. Making macroing 
        less appealing and productive is.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I hope this is taken seriously 
        and by the kind of response this essay elicits from Origin, we should 
        be able to tell how seriously they take this issue. In some regards this 
        author can understand the needs for some people to macro. Though I can 
        additionally understand OSI's policy of wishing to reduce the number of 
        people macroing. I hope we can find a solution before too many more OSI 
        customers are turned away. </font></p>
