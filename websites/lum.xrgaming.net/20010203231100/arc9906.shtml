  for June 1999</font></b></font></p>
<p><font color="#FFFF00" size="3" face="Arial"><i>06/30/99 7:30 PM </i><b>EVOLUTION 
  IN ACTION</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><i>&quot;You're just loving this, 
  I bet. This is what you've dreamed of. All Eyez On Me, hey Lummy?&quot;</i></font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">You know, the plan was to phase out 
  all this UO bullshit. I mean, I don't even <b>play</b> Ultima Online any more. 
  I re-installed it on my hard drive the other day so I could try out some UOAssist 
  <a href="http://www.growealth.com/chartrack">character tracker plugin</a>. Haven't 
  logged in since. No real cause or crusade to it, just enjoy EQ more at the moment. 
  Most of my friends, and more importantly the woman I live with, are in EQ right 
  now, not UO. And these are, at the core, basically social experiences.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Why does this web site exist? Well, 
  a couple of reasons... I like to write, mostly, and this beats muttering to 
  myself as I walk down the street. On a more altruistic level, I saw the need 
  for a voice for those players in games like UO or EQ who weren't being listened 
  to by the mainstream &quot;don't-publish-anything-that-might-piss-OSI-off&quot; 
  news sites or the &quot;Look!-The-GM-banned-my-account!-It's-a-CONSPIRACY!&quot; 
  rants most of the bug sites have devolved to now that there are few actual bugs. 
  Later, I thought it would be cool to do a sort of quasi-underground no-holds-barred 
  community news reporting thingy. But mostly, because I like to write. It's a 
  selfish thing.</font></p>
<p><i><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;I think you're on the verge 
  of doing a Big Thing badly...&quot;</font></i></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Then the Darwin fiasco broke, and 
  all of a sudden I got to play reporter. I think the funniest thing about it 
  all was that more than one person thought the interview was a parody. Sorry, 
  guys, I'm not that good a writer, portrayals of human frailty like that usually 
  have to come naturally. It's been a different web site the past couple of days. 
  And I'm sure the guys who make those ad banners up top were happy about it; 
  click the little graph button at the bottom of the page and you can check out 
  the big ol' spike in hits the site got. Woo hoo. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Unfortunately, the point I missed 
  while I was trying to ram it into <b>your </b>head was that it was all about 
  people, and the mistakes they make. My mistakes, my biases and prejudices, got 
  to creep right in there along with those Matt Drudge-like Special Bulletin Reports.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Overall, it's a simple story. Boy 
  finds way to twist his responsibilities for personal gain, boy gets caught, 
  boy gets fired, boy whines to Flavor-Of-The-Month-Website about how it was all 
  for someone else's benefit. Pretty cut and dried, really.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I guess in my imitation of an unbiased 
  reporter, I didn't emphasize clearly enough what I actually thought about the 
  whole thing. Someone who emailed me about it put it best -- </font></p>
<blockquote> 
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><i>You're so right about this Lum, 
    I totally understand how this will destroy UO. Who's going to trust a GM now? 
    So many jokes will be made of this like "What took the GM so long? Oh, his 
    auction on eBay was closing." GM's thought they had trouble getting respect 
    before? They will NEVER be respected now. The ones who are trusted will now 
    have shadows of doubt cast over them. </i></font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><i>And it's all the work of one 
    man. To paraphrase Dennis Miller: You're a punk, Darwin. A bad guy. Go to 
    hell. </i></font></p>
</blockquote>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I know it probably <b>never</b> seems 
  like it, but I care about the UO-EQ community (and yes, it's really one large 
  amorphous entity, trust me on this one). A lot. 98% of my social life is there, 
  and the rest is either work or email. (Yeah, sad, isn't it. Look at your own 
  life before you start throwing any stones.) I do not want to be the catalyst 
  of its corruption, and yet I look over the past couple of days and wonder... 
  how did I help? What did I accomplish here?</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The mainstream sites -- UO Vault, 
  Stratics, etc.. -- ignored this whole thing completely, and that was probably 
  the correct response. Yeah, a GM got fired. Not the first time, not the last. 
  Twister posted his bit, and that no doubt surprised anyone. Twister probably 
  cares about the community, too, oddly enough. I don't think he actually thinks 
  about the consequences of what he posts, but the fact that he's kept after this, 
  day after day, for the past year or so, speaks volumes. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Consequences. Good word, really. 
  What damned Darwin, more than the auctions, more than the Mickey Mouse salt 
  shakers, was the refusal to accept the consequences of his actions. &quot;But 
  it was for a friend&quot;, &quot;The other GMs do it too&quot;, &quot;It wasn't 
  hurting anyone, really&quot;. Rule one - there is no such thing as a victimless 
  crime. The more fake money that flows into the UO system, the less value those 
  who actually strive for wealth and worth in game recieve. Why do I keep screaming 
  for a shard wipe? Because of those dupers and cheaters who have keeps and castles 
  full of millions of reagants and suits of armor they never earned, they'll never 
  use. The system is corrupt; this is only the next step in the list.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">It's not OSI's fault.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">God damn, that was harder to write 
  than I thought. But it's a simple truth. No system of accountability, no supervision, 
  no training can counteract the ability of one determined person to defeat the 
  system, and that's what happened. When they found out about it, they fired him. 
  End of story. Trying to use this as a hobbyhorse to cavail about all the wrongs, 
  real or percieved, in the way OSI runs their damned game makes a mockery of 
  any valid point I may try to make.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">As for the excuse, and that's what 
  it was, that he was helping a friend made it all better... well, let me tell 
  you a story.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Ten years ago, I was pretty poor. 
  As in, if I screwed up my accounting, I ate Ramen noodles for a month, and if 
  I screwed it up any further, I would be heating them in the street somewhere. 
  Fresh out of college, no real work experience, bouncing around dead end jobs, 
  still white-knuckled from a bounced speed habit (yeah, that's another great 
  story that hopefully will never get told here), just basically a stupid kid 
  trying to get ahead in the world.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I had a friend, who worked in the 
  same place I did at the time, a large faceless department store. He was an assistant 
  manager there. I would bitch at him from time to time about how I wasn't paid 
  enough, couldn't pay my bills, phone was about to get cut off, yadda yadda yadda.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">One day all my bills started coming 
  back with notices that they were paid. I wasn't the one who paid them.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Some of them were big. Real big. 
  Hundreds of dollars big. I was 3 to 4 months behind on most of my bills, and 
  BANG they were all magically gone. I did some calls and found out out it was 
  my coworker who had paid them. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I called him and asked about it, 
  and he said he was sick of hearing me bitch.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">There was no way he could have afforded 
  to do that on what he made... it wasn't much more than I. And I told him so.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;Don't be stupid, Scott.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I told him to shove his stolen charity 
  up his ass. He was quite surprised, and then offended. What, I was too good 
  for his money?</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Well, yeah. I was.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Of course, I wasn't too good to actually 
  pay the money back myself, or even tell my employer what happened. There are 
  limits to everyone's goodness, I guess.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">But I can tell you, from personal 
  experience, Darwin wasn't doing his friend any favors.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">What does that have to do with anything? 
  Not a damned thing. Just an interesting story, that's all. About consequences. 
  Sometimes we have to bite the bullet and face up to what we reap when we sow.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Tomorrow there will be other rants, 
  other idiotic updates about nothing in particular and especially not about GMs 
  and eBay. Just remember to keep it in perspective, believe nothing of what you 
  read at face value, and that it's all fun and games until people get involved. 
  </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Take care, everyone.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFF00" size="3" face="Arial"><i>06/30/99 5:00 AM </i><b>ANOTHER 
  VIEW </b></font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Here's an email you all might find 
  interesting, from Kevin &quot;Darwin&quot; Roseler's wife Alysha. As I keep 
  annoyingly saying, no matter what you may think about what happened (and you 
  can read what <i>I</i> think below) there always is another view.</font></p>
<blockquote> 
  <p> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Let me preface this by saying 
    that this is the last statement of any kind I intend to make about this topic. 
    A question draws out an answer, that only raises another question. It won't 
    end, until someone stops it. Do I hope this letter will stop this madness? 
    Yes. Do I truly anticipate that it will? No. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I've played UO myself for a year 
    now. I purchased the game at full price. I paid $10 a month to play it, just 
    as every one of you has. No GM ever touched my account for any purpose other 
    than to robe my former Test Center Counselor, Compassion. I am entitled to 
    my player's perspective and opinion. I think what The GM Formerly Known as 
    Darwin has done is an atrocity to the game as a whole. The players now trust 
    GMs that much less. They feel all GMs are corrupt. They are questioning OSI's 
    ethics and screening processes. It just is reflecting very poorly on Dear 
    Ole OSI. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I have been married to Kevin Roseler 
    for four and a half years now though. I am obligated to love the man through 
    thick and thin. Do I condone his course of action? Are you kidding me? No, 
    I am not about to sit here and say "Oh, but he is a fine upstanding man with 
    a heart as good as gold. Just look past the mess and see the man" I love him, 
    but yes, he screwed up...royally. Is he sincerely sorry he did what he did? 
    Eh, I wish he was, but as he said, if he had it to do again, he just might. 
    Is he sorry he got caught? I guarantee you he is. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Now, really, is what he has done 
    illegal? No charges were filed. He didn't steal copies of the game and sell 
    them. He created something from nothing and someone bought it. That sounds 
    wrong, right? Well, the selling part wasn't even the illegal part! The fact 
    that he acquired the money by abusing his company given powers was the terminatable, 
    but not illegal, offense. It was wrong and he acknowledges that, but lay off 
    the talk of corporate embezzlement and fraud, will you? If a woman snags her 
    hose and uses a drop of company glue is she going to be charged with company 
    embezzlement? Of course she isn't! Hasn't she taken something that belonged 
    to the company and used it for her own personal gain though? Get real people. 
    If a man has company papers in his briefcase bound by a company paper clip, 
    then goes home with them, is he going to be hung out to dry like a thief? 
    That's pretty stupid isn't it!? He has taken something that belonged to the 
    company though. Where do you draw that line? Sure, I am speaking of actual, 
    tangible things that are as stupid as they come, but isn't creating something 
    from nothing really just about as stupid? "He has put the UO economy out of 
    balance" Tell me just how that is going to affect you John Q. Public. As I 
    said, I played the game and never once did it affect me. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">There is one last thing I would 
    like to address. First and foremost, Kevin's eBay spendings and sellings really 
    shouldn't be any of your concern. Since they have become public knowledge, 
    let me just say that the computer parts were purchased by and for his Mommy 
    Dearest in an effort to build a computer so she can keep in touch with her 
    little boy, NOT that it is any business of yours, however. Oh, and the Mickey 
    Mouse salt and pepper shakers are for me. Many of you will of course take 
    this with a grain of salt, but I am a woman of my word. Kevin really did do 
    this as a favor to a friend. He helped the friend and still has the friend. 
    He lost the job, but will find another. We are getting phone calls at home. 
    Kevin is receiving hate mail. I've even received requests for authorization 
    on my ICQ list for interviews with the infamous GM Darwin. All I have to say 
    is, this too shall pass. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I am not writing this to defend 
    Kevin. I am not writing this to bash him either. I am writing to point out 
    a few simple facts. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Kevin screwed up. OSI DID fire 
    him as soon as they found out. He is NOT the first GM to ever be fired. As 
    Lum said, this was bound to happen. If this 'crime' had not been committed 
    by Kevin, it would have been committed by someone else soon enough. Kevin 
    does not have a dime to show for this. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">What more can I say? Nothing I 
    said was so mind numbing as to really open anyone's eyes or alter any opinions. 
    Truthfully, I don't REALLY care what you think anymore. I was always told 
    that not everyone is going to like me all of the time and there isn't going 
    to be anything I can do to change that. The same goes for Kevin. Such is life. 
    That said, I will close. </font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFF00" size="3" face="Arial"><i>06/29/99 10:00 PM </i><b>THE 
  EVOLUTION OF UO - DARWIN, eBAY AND YOU</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Busy day.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Most of you have responded, some 
  quite eloquently, here and elsewhere about Darwin generating and selling UO 
  gold on eBay. I posted them in exactly the order I recieved them, and it's interesting 
  to see how opinion gradually shifted as time went on.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">What's my opinion? Well, contrary 
  to popular belief, I didn't go out for drinks with him after the interview. 
  He didn't seek me out, I went and found him. We had Twister's expose of the 
  eBay files, we had the standard OSI corpspeak we'll-make-everything-better-now 
  press release, what we didn't have was, um, why he did it. So I asked.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Why have I been making such a big 
  deal out of all this? Simple..<b>. if anything could destroy UO, it would be 
  this. </b></font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I'm not being sensationalistic, I'm 
  stating the facts, plainly. I've ranted on about how the incompetence of the 
  UO support staff has had a chilling effect on the way the game's community has 
  evolved. Here's <a href="abm2.html">a particularly long riff </a> on that theme. 
  </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Now we have hard, concrete evidence 
  that despite all the carefully announced checks and balances on the power of 
  GMs on the game world, we have one particular and not especially unusual GM 
  that cloned money and castles and sold them for real money. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">This is a big deal. This isn't Twister's 
  latest rant, and for once he actually happened across a real news story, and 
  all respect/props/whatever-gangsta-slang-you-prefer to him for breaking it. 
  This is real. This is a hard, concrete example of the corruption that has infected 
  UO.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">One family's already suffered for 
  it. I know, I've talked to them. You can take the moral high ground about law 
  and order all you want - there's a guy right now who's out of a job because 
  he didn't. And you know, &quot;I was helping a friend&quot; ain't gonna cut 
  it next month when rent comes due. That's far more of a punishment then any 
  biting words I could ever post.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">His coworkers aren't too happy either, 
  I imagine. Who can blame them? Who trusts a GM, now? I mean, shit, what <b>else</b> 
  could come out? One thing that came out of the interview that no one really 
  commented on was how some GM (I was told by a couple of folks it was GM Boo) 
  just unilaterally deleted Nighthawk's tower immediately after he was banned, 
  out of spite. That's just fucked up. That's punishing a player and, more importantly, 
  those co-owners of that tower who may <b>not </b> have been banned, because 
  Nighthawk writes a widely read <a href="http://www.wtfman.com/jov/">web site</a> 
  on how to be a nasty player. That is so fucked up, it is unreal. OSI can blather 
  on about community online development relations all they want, but when people 
  start getting the smackdown for what they say and write <b>outside of the game</b>, 
  that is wrong. Wrong. Wrong. And what happened to all that GM logging? How was 
  the deletion of Nighthawk's tower logged? &quot;Player's tower deleted, I didn't 
  like him very much&quot;? They said over and over that his tower wouldn't be 
  replaced (must be that &quot;No rolling back of GM spiteful fuckups&quot; clause 
  in the TOS), and then, according to Darwin, he <b>did</b> get his tower replaced, 
  and money besides, as a reward for being a snitch. Nighthawk said he didn't, 
  and your choices for who you can believe range between a recently disgraced 
  and fired GM and a PK who used to hang around with <a href="http://www.wtfman.com/mcd/">Ronald 
  McDonald</a>. Mmmm, role models.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">You got a bunch of kids, most under 
  the age of 25, working for internship wages, apparently poorly supervised (didn't 
  anyone <b>notice</b> Darwin spontaneously generating castles in odd places?), 
  that hold an enterprise that generates over a $1,000,000.00 a month in revenue 
  hostage. You'd think at some point, someone at OSI would rent a clue. I'm sure 
  many of us would be happy to lease them out at reasonable rates. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Everquest customer support is having 
  problems too, by the way. Lots of high level characters got &quot;lost&quot; 
  the other day. Whoops.</font></p>

  in that regard.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">[Lum] Were you compensated for your 
  ingame losses? With what?</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">[Nighthawk] No, with the help of 
  a friend (Charley) we purchased a tower in game about a week ago. I'd had many 
  many people come up to me and tell me they heard about that purchase, so it's 
  pretty much common knowledge that Charley got me back on my feet.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">[Lum] Did anyone ever explain to

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">[Nighthawk] No, outside of the interview 
  you had with Darwin, I've not had an explanation of why my tower was deleted. 
  Well, except that they said they would not replace it - they certainly said 
  that a lot. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I think we can safely assume that

  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Anyhow, I wandered around to the 
    front of the castle and clicked on the sign and was told the sign read "Japanese 
    Hall" </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Now, Nighthawk got banned for saying

  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Oh, did I mention the posted sign

</blockquote>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Meanwhile, older buildings that were

  there is the thought that I got something out of this.. well I did, I helped 
  a friend and did not make a dime. There are so many that are never reported.

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#CCCCFF">[Kevin] ahh that 
  was bullshit... and you know that Vader is him right? Nah, it had nothing to 
  do with me losing my job, this was not about job performance. Anyway he was 
  also a counselor... Twister backwards was his counselor name. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">[Lum] Well I guess that pretty much 
  proves that the Counselor program needed better screening... </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#CCCCFF">[Kevin] Aye.. yes 
  it needs much better screening. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">[Lum] Do you think the temptation 
  of virtual assets being generated and sold for real-world cash occurred to OSI 
  at any point? </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#CCCCFF">[Kevin] When that 
  first account was sold, they warned us about it and said not to do it. But, 
  the lure is always there... I mean, I am sure others GM's have done it or are 
  doing it. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">[Lum] Would it be too nosy to ask 
  how much you were paid as a GM? </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#CCCCFF">[Kevin] Nah, we make 
  $10 an hour, and I had been there 10 months the day I was fired and was still 
  a temporary employee.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">[Lum] I realize most of the GMs at 
  OSI are still friends of yours, but do you think they are adequately trained 
  and staffed? </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#CCCCFF">[Kevin] Trained? 
  Yes.. staffed... no, I mean there are times when there is one GM for 2 shards... 
  that makes response times crappy and slow, there should always be one, perhaps 
  two on some shards, ie. Atlantic, Great Lakes, LS, Pacific and maybe Chessie 
  and Cats... </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">[Lum] Do you think OSI will penalize 
  any of the people that you sold real estate to? </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#CCCCFF">[Kevin] I would hope 
  not, and here is a good one for you. Know the Nighthawk guy? Anyway, he was 
  supposed to be banned for calling someone a Jap or something... anyway, someone 
  from upstairs ie. the dev team or the community people said to unban him since 
  he had all his friends protest. While this was happening, after he was banned, 
  one of the Lead GMs deleted his tower and other items, so when he was unblocked, 
  he had nothing. He is the one that actually turned me in. What does he get for 
  all this? A placed Castle and much more... I heard over 5 + million gold. You 
  can see how strict they are about racial harassment there. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">[Lum] I always thought his tower 
  disappearing was somewhat fishy. So Nighthawk turned you in, and OSI rewarded 
  him with a placed castle? </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#CCCCFF">[Kevin] Yes, he turned 
  me in... he looked up all my auctions online, not that I was being to careful 
  or anything, and then emailed them saying that a GM may be selling items on 
  Ebay and then they (Origin) called or emailed eBay and found out for sure... 
  and then I was fired. Again, I am not upset or mad with OSI about my my termination 
  as it was my fault, just the way it was handled and now this bullshit letter 
  they post on the site... that is just plain classless </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">[Lum] Do you think OSI thought the 
  reason for your termination would never have been made public? It strikes me 
  that they're trying to protect themselves. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#CCCCFF">[Kevin] Yes, I think 
  they could cover it up and hope nothing came out. I knew it would be public 
  soon enough as Twister's little pet, Shai'Tan emailed me saying he knew all 
  about it. I think OSI, thought they could cover it up by firing me and then 
  posting this bullshit letter on the page, but I knew it would be out soon enough 
  as Twister knew what was up. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">[Lum] Well I think we've pretty much 
  covered everything... is there something I missed that you'd like to add? </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#CCCCFF">[Kevin] Umm, well, 
  yes, if you can add this to the end or something... </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">[Lum] Speak clearly into the microphone... 
  </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#CCCCFF">[Kevin] To all the 
  players in UO, it was my pleasure to serve you and help you in the game. I know 
  a lot of you hate me. Well, not hate me personally but the GM persona of me, 
  and for that I am sorry. But, you must understand there is very little the GMs 
  can actually do. That said, I am sorry to all the GMs, PDs and all the players. 
  What I did was very wrong and I have no excuse. All I can say was that I was 
  helping a friend that needed help. Would I do it again? I am not sure, but my 
  guess is yes. Thanks again and farewell all. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">[Lum] Thanks for your time, Kevin. 
  </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">One thing is clear - GM Darwin no 
  longer works for OSI. Everything else is pretty much up for grabs on this story. 
  There are a GREAT many ethical questions raised by this interview, and the issues 
  behind it. Kevin's &quot;crime&quot;, if that, is so arcane that it's doubtful 
  a judge could even understand it, much less rule on it, is that he profited 
  from his position as a GM to place virutal houses, castles and other realty 
  that could not otherwise be placed in the virtual reality enviornment of UO.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">That much is clear, and obviously 
  profiting from his position as a GM was wrong. As OSI will no doubt state, as 
  I have stated in the past, when this happens, as the rules of the game become 
  open to the interpretation of those with the most money or the most influence 
  (much like American society in real life, actually), those who have neither 
  suffer for it.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">And yet. When OSI gave Nighthawk 
  a placed castle in lieu of 30 pieces of silver, how was what OSI did different 
  from what GM Darwin did? Are those rules of the game more &quot;open to interpretation&quot; 
  by the people who run it as opposed to those who must police it?</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">It's all corrupt, and Darwin is by 
  far not the only guilty party. And don't even get me started on Twister.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Everyone's favorite Friend In Space, 
  <a href="http://www.drtwister.com/ultimaonline/uo-indx.html">Dr. Twister</a>, 
  posted over the weekend about how OSI may be monitoring use of UOE. Here's my 
  thoughts. I have quite a few, so go grab a beer, because this is a big ol' old 
  school rant from the Lummster.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">It would be trivally easy for OSI 
  to determine if you were using UOE, since, like every other program, it leaves 
  an entry in your Registry to save your preferences and such. (It's stored under 
  &quot;Kowlesoft Software&quot;, I believe.) Any program could check for these 
  registry entries, and encoding such a check would be trivial.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">That being said, will OSI ban you 
  for having UOE on your machine? Let's look at some history.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Remember Starcraft? Really popular 
  game, really well done, really widely pirated. Blizzard (who are all basically 
  a bunch of pirates and hackers themselves, and I mean that in a good way) knew 
  this would happen and put in a serial number on every CD which was matched to 
  a database when you logged into battle.net to play online, which at the time 
  was fairly revolutionary. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Of course, the guys who pirated Starcraft 
  were slowed down by this scheme for all of twenty seconds, and included a handy 
  serial number generator that allowed anyone using a pirated copy to &quot;roll 
  their own&quot; serial number and jump online. Only problem with this was that, 
  of course, if someone went to the store, bought Starcraft, and logged into battle.net, 
  there was now a chance that someone beat them to their own serial number. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">This did not amuse Blizzard, and 
  their response, for whatever reason, was to <a href="http://headline.gamespot.com/news/98_04/22_bnet/index.html">download 
  huge chunks of every user's Windows registry that logged into battle.net</a>. 
  They later stated that they did this to try to get the user's identity from 
  their Netscape and Internet Explorer entries (whatever they use for an email 
  address, etc.) There was nothing to actually prevent them from doing this technically. 
  Legally was a different story... and <a href="http://headline.gamespot.com/news/98_04/29_blizz/index.html">they 
  got sued</a>. Blizzard <a href="http://headline.gamespot.com/news/98_07/14_starcftwo/index.html">settled 
  out of court</a>, but needless to say, every game developer was watching, including 
  OSI. who of course has their own <a href="http://headline.gamespot.com/news/98_03/09_uo/index.html">very 
  special legal history</a>.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Given all that, why don't we examine 
  the UO Terms of Service (which I've <a href="uo/tos/index.htm">helpfully mirrored</a>, 
  since the UO web site is lacking both a search engine and, as best as I can 
  determine, a linkable copy). Section 5(c) states</font></p>
<blockquote> 
  <p><font face="Comic Sans MS">You acknowledge that you do not have the right 
    to create, publish, distribute, create derivative works from or use any software 
    programs, utilities, applications, emulators or tools derived from or created 
    for Ultima Online unless specifically authorized in writing by Origin Systems. 
    </font></p>
</blockquote>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Pretty cut and dried (and why in 
  the hell a legal document uses Comic Sans as a font, I'll never fathom.) But 
  what's interesting is this next part, section 5(e):</font></p>
<blockquote> 
  <p><font face="Comic Sans MS">You understand that you have no expectation of 
    privacy regarding the communications you make on the Service, and that all 
    communications made by or received from you may be monitored by Origin Systems 
    representatives. You hereby consent to the extraction of hardware system profile 
    data and any data related to operation of the Software through the Service 
    from any computer that logs on to the Service using your Account.</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Things that make you go <a href="http://www.cdnow.com/cgi-bin/mserver/SID=787980206/pagename=/share/ensotrack2.html/pop=1/UPC=7464470932/disc=01/track=03/source=ENSO/ra.ram">hmmmmm</a>. 
  Now, this may very well be just legal butt-covering in the wake of the Blizzard 
  lawsuit... or maybe it's just preparedness. Only the dev team (or more probably, 
  their lawyers) know for sure.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Now, unlike certain other <a href="http://www.drtwister.com/ultimaonline/uo-indx.html">less 
  responsible web sites</a>, I'm not suggesting <a href="http://uoss.stratics.com/hall/war/messages/92883312212944.html">dragging 
  OSI into court every time a GM looks at you sidewise</a>. I'm a firm believer 
  in the <a href="http://www.nowandzen.com/zen/firthinwedol.html">Shakespearean 
  method</a> of tort reform. However, even if OSI *could* download and inspect 
  your registry (which they can, as I showed above), and assuming a lawyer does 
  not immediately float into the programmer's den there and intone &quot;THOU 
  HAST LOST AN EIGHTH!&quot; when they do it (which they won't, as I showed above), 
  what does it really prove?</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">They aren't confirming that you are 
  USING UOE by this method, merely that you INSTALLED it. I'm pretty sure a whole 
  lot of people, up to and including GM Lord British, have installed UOE. If for 
  no other reason, just to see what other idiots could do to YOU. While the <a href="uo/tos/index.htm">TOS</a> 
  pretty clearly states that you can't install or use any 3rd party utilities 
  unless OSI sends you a registered letter (it has to be &quot;</font><font face="Comic Sans MS">specifically 
  authorized in writing by Origin Systems</font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;, 
  remember) the fact is that this TOS was hidden in a web document on OSI's web 
  site that took me six minutes to find (I timed it) and I am, as you all know, 
  the <a href="http://www.sphere.ad.jp/ninja/eng/enter/nin-life/lifedata/life5.html">Web 
  Search Ninja</a>. It would take mere mortals at LEAST ten minutes. And as we 
  all know, <a href="http://www.webcom.com/emmetth/tb/problem_player.html">enforcement 
  is nine-tenths of the law</a> in the wild and wooly world of UO, as <a href="imthelaw.wav">GM 
  Judge Dredd would say</a>. It's theoretically possible that you could be banned 
  for installing UOE, but enforcing it would be an entirely different beast entirely.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">There is one other possibility, and 
  that is that the UO client has been patched to detect what if any other processes 
  are running alongside it. This is also pretty easy to do, although not as falling-off-a-log 
  easy as checking the registry to see if UOE was installed. It's pretty easy 
  to guess what would happen if GMs COULD detect if UOE were running... everyone 
  running UOE would be banned. So either this hasn't been done, or (more likely, 
  given the rumors out of OSI) it has but they are waiting on the OK from legal 
  to begin the executions.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Of course, if you actually are worried 
  about OSI finding out if you use UOE, you are <a href="http://www.themushroom.com/legit/e399/e3day2.html">a 
  complete and total loser</a> anyway. Now that UOA has been approved, and many 
  not-quite-as-approved hacks to re-enable continuous macroing are out as well, 
  the only people who use UOE with UO are those who are too cheap to actually 
  fork over a lousy ten bucks for a software program. Two words - blow me.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">It could be worse. In EQ, the solution 
  was to just not <a href="http://www.deja.com/getdoc.xp?AN=483564886&amp;fmt=text">allow 
  you to use any third party utilties while EQ is running. Like, say, Windows</a>.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">btw i met drtwister at e3 
  and he is really really fat. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Now look, people. First off, if you 
  check the pictures from Britfest, you will plainly see that the only porn star 
  I will ever hope to resemble is Ron Jeremy. Sending me shocking exposes on &quot;drtwister 
  is really really fat&quot; does nothing for me except make me wonder if he has 
  a copy of that grapefruit and vodka diet I haven't tried yet. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Second, I know this is probably logical 
  thinking on the order of brain surgery for many of you out there, but for many 
  folks, especially those who aren't strung out on ritalin and lithium doled out 
  by &quot;really busy&quot; teachers at elementary school, the lifestyle that 
  is spending 14 hours a day at a computer keyboard (and sometimes more for those 
  of us who actually work on a PC as well) does not lend well to a fit and trim 
  physique. There is also the fact that the folks most attracted to social online 
  experiments are usually those who failed the first social online experiement 
  (aka real life) and have retreated to the Magical Land Of Make Believe where 
  they can frolic amongst the posies and people named Galadriel.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">So have fun, nuke and root and PK 
  to your heart's content, but if some cute little wood elf babe in EQ starts 
  telling you what a total hot lucious fantasy she is in real life, do some critical 
  thinking (no, it doesn't hurt your head when you do it) and wonder why the hell 
  a total hot lucious fantasy would be doing scamming virtual sex online. </font></p>

</font> 
<div><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Hello Dr. Twister, OSI people, 
  and all of the UO players out there. I apologize for the mass mail - just wanted 
  to get this to all OSI I could think of and all important UO sites. This letter 
  is written to Twister, but sent to everyone because this is getting out of hand.</font></div>
<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><br>
</font> 
<div><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Twister,</font></div>
<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><br>
</font> 
<div><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I am an avid player of UO and visit 
  your website often. However I enjoy your website not for the content of UO material 
  you bring, but to watch your own hypocrticial styles clash in an attempt to 
  try to bring &quot;news&quot; to the UO public.</font></div>
<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><br>
</font> 
<div><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">You won't print this on your site 
  and probably won't even respond to it, because it will discredit you faster 
  than you have tried to discredit Origin Systems, the designers, the programmers, 
  the Game Masters, and the very game which you have been enraptured by. I only 
  hope you have the balls to not only go on reading this but to respond to ALL 
  of us, because you have trapped yourself this time for good. Due to this I have 
  added several people on OSI and within the community to read and pass this along 
  because the hypocrisy ends now.</font></div>
<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><br>
</font> 
<div><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Only a couple of weeks ago, you 
  glamorized a specific GM for being courteous and helpful to a player named Vader. 
  That was pretty cool and different for a change, and good to see because all 
  of the GM experiences I have had were helpful and found a resolution to the 
  problem at hand. I wish more people would come to their defense, because anyone 
  that has ever had to work in customer service knows how hard it is to deal with 
  the public.</font></div>
<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><br>
</font> 
<div><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In any case this Vader guy now 
  says that since he has a problem with the game, that not only was the GM on 
  duty that night (Darwin) useless for not finding out the problem, but the GM 
  that you mailed (Llano) in searching for answers is unhelpful as well, despite 
  his very specific detail in what actually happened with the problem.</font></div>
<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><br>
</font> 
<div><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">This leads me to one of two conclusions: 
  1) you are not nearly as smart as you think because you eat the crap that Vader 
  sends you or 2) you are Vader on Baja (and hence still not as smart as you like 
  to to think). I am inclined to think #2, as you are rarely as passionate and 
  adamant about a subject's views. Your hints in the &quot;mails&quot; that Vader 
  sends are about as subtle as a jackhammer.</font></div>
<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><br>
</font> 
<div><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I am not writing about the issue 
  that happened in the game - Lord knows there are still numerous bugs in it. 
  However you refuse to accept the the service provided by OSI, which is where 
  I have a problem. OSI's customer service got to the problem, saw there was nothing 
  wrong, told you that it was a result of the game's designed systems, received 
  your ranting and condescending mail, replied, offered different ways this could 
  have happened, told you that this would be reported, and then apologized for 
  not being able to interfere and take off a murder count (note: you vehemently 
  have wanted GMs to remain out of the game and never interfere). In addition, 
  if you know anything about or any other software product on the market, when 
  bugs like this are reported, they are isolated, tested, re-tested, tried to 
  be replicated, and then fixed if found. I would bet that this happened (ever 
  heard of a patch to fix something?)</font></div>
<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><br>
</font> 
<div><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Gee that's pretty shitty and unacceptable 
  service for something that never happened.</font></div>
<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><br>
</font> 
<div><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">When all this is said and done, 
  they probably will spend about five or six total man-hours working on a bug 
  that you reported that really wasn't ever a bug at all. Damn, you yourself question 
  and wonder why it is that no events are run or things gets don't get fixed at 
  OSI - look in the mirror, jerky. Its got a lot to do with stupid asses like 
  you bitch about things in the game that you don't understand, question how it 
  was ever done, rip support for not giving you what you want, and thusly end 
  up hogging up more OSI resources than a Microsoft product.</font></div>
<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><br>
</font> 
<div><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Let's do some simple scary math. 
  One Twister/Vader on each shard. One Twister-size incident each week. Five man-hours 
  per Twister incident. Fourteen shards. Five x 14 = seventy man hours spent on 
  issues that really aren't even issues at all by the OSI staff. That's almost 
  two full-time employees' full work week dedicated to making sure that he is 
  happy. I don't know about you, but I'd rather let the people over there work 
  on events, quest engines, fixes, and new features.</font></div>
<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><br>
</font> 
<div><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">You think you are helping UO, Twister? 
  Think again. They should ban you just on the principal that you are costing 
  them way more money than what you are paying.</font></div>
<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><br>
</font> 
<div><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I highly, highly suggest that you 
  really look at what it is you are doing. You have a lot less vision than you 
  would like to think, and are so narrow-minded that anything besides what you 
  &quot;see&quot; you simply refuse to believe. I would think that the very fact 
  that 99% of us in UO have had fantastic UO and UO support experiences should 
  make you think otherwise, but then again maybe we all need to think about who 
  we are talking to.</font></div>
<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><br>
</font> 
<div><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Let me recap it all if you couldn't 
  comprehend what I have said...</font></div>
<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><br>
</font> 
<div><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">1) You have stated that you never 
  want GMs to interfere with the game. Yet despite a result of a game that was 
  proven to happen for reasons other than what you think, you want them to hop 
  in and give you anything you want. *hypocritical*</font></div>
<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><br>
</font> 
<div><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">2) GM Llano provides quality support 
  and is your GM of the Year!! Two weeks later on finding out that your character 
  has no problems at all, he is an ineffective employee in customer support for 
  quickly and efficiently resolving the issue. *blind by your own wants*</font></div>
<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><br>
</font> 
<div><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">3) GM Darwin has previously provided 
  good support, which you have posted before. Now Darwin is a real loser for going 
  to a situation, seeing that he couldn't get involved with it, and telling you 
  directly that this is a result of a game function. *ignorant*</font></div>
<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><br>
</font> 
<div><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">4) You state that Llano is Iron 
  Will. Um who cares both of them kick ass for me (all of them kick ass actually) 
  and both have helped me and others. I don't know if he is or not (and could 
  care less), but let's see how everyone likes it when they know YOUR alter ego 
  Twister/Vader on Baja. *plain stupid*</font></div>
<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><br>
</font> 
<div><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">5) Your stance on PvP - while you 
  would hate for PvPers to be eliminated and don't want them to be ruined, you 
  couldn't stand the fact that you ruined someone else's day by MURDERING them, 
  and that they subsequently reported you for a legitimate murder. *the pot calls 
  the kettle black*</font></div>
<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><br>
</font> 
<div><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">For the GMs, designers, OSI people, 
  and guys in the UO community that have made it this far down, know now that 
  your game not only kicks ass, but allows for all players to play as they want. 
  You have given me and my family (yup thats right - three accounts here :)) more 
  hours of fun than we could ever get out of $30 spent anywhere else. We like 
  it, our friends like it, and everyone we run into likes it.</font></div>
<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><br>
</font> 
<div><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">For Twisty/Vader - sorry dude, 
  you have lost it. OSI isn't perfect, but who is in your mind - Bill Clinton? 
  You hold them to a higher standard only because you are so embroiled in what 
  goes on, you created a persona that only feeds your ego and blinds your vision. 
  If I were you I would seriously re-evaluate what it is you are doing in game 
  and out of game. Personally, I'd like you to go to Everquest just so you can 
  let the rest of us have support when we actually NEED it.</font></div>
<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><br>
</font> 
<div><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Thank you OSI for all that you 
  do for us - MOST of us appreicate it. For all of you out there that are touched 
  by the game, let OSI know about it thru mail, phone, chats, and posting. I am 
  tired of seeing lamers make noise when 99% of us are having a grand old time.</font></div>
<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><br>
</font> 
<div><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">A grand old thanks to those that 
  work on the game and the players that make the game,</font></div>

  my own widdle server Veeshan, there was a GM-run event where a really large 
  guild slew a dragon, which is actually a big deal, unlike in UO where dragons 
  are often victims of drive-by energy vortexes. The odd thing about this was 
  that one of the brave dragonslayers was a certain 50th level ranger named Aradune. 
  You might know him out of game as Brian &quot;When do I get the damn 50th level 
  Shadowknight&quot; Hook's new boss, Brad McQuaid. A few people had problems 
  with the game's producer joining up with the guild <a href="http://www.firesofheaven.org/foh/index.htm">FoH</a> 
  and swatting the most powerful mob in the game (kind of like Designer Dragon 
  joining SiN and r0xxing Kazola's). His response, on the <a href="http://boards.vaultnetwork.com/wwwthreads.pl?action=list&amp;Board=eqgeneral">only 
  message board</a> Verant deigns to acknowledge); </font></p>
<blockquote> 
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><i>I did not cheat and I used a 
    level 50 ranger who was equipped with decent OBTAINABLE level 50 items. I 
    know for a fact that I made no statistical difference in terms of the outcome

  <p><i><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">And I RP'd the event as well

    where staff will take part in events. They are monitored, and their activity, 
    the rewards they give out, etc. are approved by me or someone close to me.

  <p><i><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">As for FoH or any guild being 
    GM twinked or given special favors... we don't tolerate that. People can indeed 
    be fired for that. And as for them abusing... let me just say that FoH has 
    been and probably will continue to be one of the most watched groups of players 
    in the game. I feel bad for them in a sense, because there is almost always 
    a GM watching them, visible or invisible, noting their progress and tactics. 
    But it simply makes sense because they are high level and encountering aspects 
    of the game first. </font></i></p>
  <p><i><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">If there are (and there will 
    be) special events in the future, either Verant planned or player created,

    this game to be fair and to not use favortism. </font></i></p>
</blockquote>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Rumor has it that a certain GM named

  For those unfamiliar with the term, &quot;twinking&quot; is the practice of 
  giving new characters a leg up, such as a 1st level fighter in EQ clanking around 
  in rubicite plate. Of course, he was almost as unpopular as another certain 
  GM named after the proponent of evolution, as a certain Doctor named after common

  more players will be cognizant of the world of role playing and more advanced, 
  refined RPG systems will make their way on line. EQ is not the end goal for

  clear-cut question like "is use of <specific program> legal", you'll get 30

  their underlings that it is legal while other SRCs assure *their* underlings 
  that it isn't. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">I remember a two-month 
  period where people would debate whether or not EZMacros was bannable, and despite 
  tempers flaring, no GM ever said anything one way or another. When they finally 
  did, instead of saying "it's legal" or "it's bannable", they would quote sections 
  of the user agreement which where either irrelevant to the subject or just plain 
  unhelpful. When asked what their statements were supposed to mean, they never 
  elaborated. In fact, when someone pointed out that Support's "moving target" 
  approach to what is and isn't legal was irresponsible, the SRCs came in and 
  silenced debate as only a group of volunteer "authority figures" can. </font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">

    <b>Well, why would UOA get approved if last target wasn't legal?</b><br>
    It was approved... I think Tug limited the range last target works with it.<br>
    <i>The dev team is putting last target into the client, aren't they?<br>
    <b>But guys, a GM told a player it was still bannable.</b> <br>
    </i>Bah, it was on Dr. Twister's page, don't believe it. <br>
    <i>Right.</i> <br>
    <b>The topic in channel last night was &quot;LAST TARGET IS STILL ILLEGAL&quot; 
    <br>
    <i>Well who set that topic?<br>
    </i></b><i>I'm not sure.</i><br>
    <b>We need to find a GM and get the word on this.</b> <br>
    Well, if they approved UOA surely they would have noticed if last target was 
    working.<br>
    <i>The web site says last target is illegal. If it's legal now they should 
    update the web site.<br>
    </i><b>OK GUYS LISTEN UP - GM Aradune told me that using any feature of UOA 
    is legal now; use of UOE and UOP is still a bannable offense<br>
    <i>Damn it, I wish he'd just say &quot;Last target is legal&quot;<br>
    </i></b><i>He did. He said any feature, that includes Last Target<br>
    <b>I just want a GM to say UOA, last target, and legal in the same sentence.<br>
    </b></i><b>How will people know if it's UOA or UOE? You know that's the next

<p><font color="#FFFF00" size="3" face="Arial"><i>06/11/99 2:30 PM </i><b>BAD 
  PKERS! NO DOUGHNUT!</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">A couple of folks emailed me asking 
  what I thought about Sir Adrick's statement on <a href="http://www.drtwister.com/ultimaonline/uo-indx.html">Dr. 
  Twister's</a> that pvpers were being specifically targeted for harassment bans.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">As corporate policy? No, I don't 
  think so... if OSI wanted to get rid of pvpers as a policy, it would be as simple 
  as a pvp switch, or making everyone who turns red die horribly, or something 
  similarly draconian. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">However. This policy is being enforced 
  by people. People as a general rule are imperfect, and the UO GMs are pretty 
  good cases in point of this theory. Those GMs generally despise PKers, because 
  most of the calls they recieve are from victims of PKers. Thus they are going 
  to be particularly hardass towards persons who are active in PK guilds, write 
  for PK/evil/bug pages (you think they don't monitor these web sites? Think again, 
  bucko... it's part of their <i>job</i>; OSI hits this particular web page daily. 
  You think the Mushroom War confused <i>YOU?</i>). While there is no written 
  memo from Rich Vogel or Raph Koster saying &quot;OK, we want you to ban 50 PKers 
  a day until they get the message&quot;, there's no <i>need</i> for one. Contrary 
  to popular belief, GMs do occasionally have minds, and those minds are minds 
  of their own.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">So what needs to be done about this? 
  Well, a list of &quot;what you can't say&quot; won't work, since of course it 
  is impossible to list all possible obscenities in every language (and if so, 
  I can always make up new ones). Dr. Twister notes two things in an <a href="http://www.drtwister.com/ultimaonline/uo-indx.html">atypically 
  rational rant</a> below Adrick's; (1) UO is rated M for Mature, and the user 
  agreement every user signs off on (without reading) states that a user is either 
  over 18 or under the consent of a parent or guardian, and (2) the obscenity 
  filter defaults to ON. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Both of these are good points, but 
  ultimately faulty. The second relies on a piece of programming work that is 
  even more faulty then most failed attempts at obscenity filters... hope you 
  don't ever need to say the word &quot;harassment&quot; in game! The first, and 
  more crucial, is that basically only adults should be playing Ultima Online, 
  and adults can handle obscenity.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The issue isn't obscenity or maturity; 
  the issue at hand is harassment, and how it is defined by those in the field 
  tasked to eliminate it. Right now, harassment is defined <i>very</i> loosely; 
  an active player that I know (and a roleplayer, not a PKer) was given a warning 
  for saying the word &quot;rape&quot; in a sentence to a friend, in the middle 
  of a forest. Someone overheard him and reported him. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">One could argue, with some justification, 
  that were the player red instead of blue, he would have been penaltyboxed or 
  possibly even banned. That's still not the issue though... the issue is that 
  the GM, when taking the report and examining the server logs that track everything 
  we say or do in UO, didn't immediately bitchslap the twink making the report. 
  </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">There is harassment in UO. A <b>lot</b> 
  of it. And pvpers/pkers are guilty of a great deal of it. (Of course, if what 
  PKers say/emote after a kill bothers you, by all means don't ever get on a Quake 
  server - even the server messages are likely causes of banning in UO.) But harassment 
  generally requires that someone be harassed.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Take the MDK saga for example. Here 
  was a guild that made as its raison d'etre making a certain roleplayer miserable. 
  They chased her, stalked her, said bad things to her, and they did some things 
  in game as well. This is clearly harassment and they did, individually, deserve 
  banning. (Collective banning is a whole other subject, but we've been there 
  before. Check the old rants, I don't remember exactly where.) There was a victim 
  in this case; someone was prevented from enjoying the game they paid for because 
  a group of kiddies decided to be dicks.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Now, there is a difference between 
  that and someone saying the word &quot;rape&quot; or &quot;jap&quot; or even 
  *gasp* &quot;fuck&quot; to a friend. <i>There is no victim here</i>. Even if 
  someone walks by and overhears, say, Lum saying to Tal, &quot;Fuck this, I'm 
  going shopping&quot;, they are not being harassed. If they are so overly sensitive 
  that seeing the word &quot;fuck&quot; bothers them, they need to turn on their 
  obscenity filter/log off/grow a clue. It is quite likely that if you walk past 
  me in real life and I am talking to a friend, I may very well use language that 
  you would disapprove of. I should change this behavior in UO? My conduct should 
  be held to a higher standard in a <i>game????</i></font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">There are some grey areas here. If 
  I made a point of going to East Brit bank and telling an accomplice about how 
  I'm sick of all these nigger gangster PKs, my conduct would be unacceptable. 
  I am, simply put, acting like an asshole in public. At some point, this makes 
  the environment unacceptable and steps should be taken to throw me in jail like 
  the punk bitch I am. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The problem here, and a problem that 
  the GMs seem uniquely braindamaged in resolving, is that judgement calls are 
  required. There is no set standard, no list that you can print out and tape 
  next to your computer monitor, that says &quot;This is not acceptable behavior.&quot; 
  At some point you have to just use common sense and say &quot;OK, that's over 
  the line, yer outta here.&quot; Major league umpires in baseball. Hell, even 
  minor league umpires do it on occasion. And an umpire is not a bad role model 
  for GMs to follow. They may get dirt kicked on their shoes on occasion, but 
  you know what? It's part of the job. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Got this interesting note on Japanese-American 
  relations on Hokuto:</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">I've been playing on Hokuto 
  for a long time now, since Day 1 the shard came up (early January I think). 
  Since I'd say a good 1/2 of the population can not speak english it did make 
  life rather complex. But hey, the free land, housing patch, low population, 
  and lack of dupers made the move from Catskills to Hokuto a joyous one. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">When the shard first came 
  up, Americians were greatly feared. You walk into a dungeon and start speaking 
  english and everyone runs. I had to paralyze a few people just to say hello, 
  and they took that the wrong way... They starting trying to mana drain me and 
  other crazy stuff, and they couldn't kill a newbie if they tried. The first 
  month I literally ran into not one Jap PK. Not one.  </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Eventually I got know a 
  few of them and they were pretty cool. On japanese time, looting, kill stealing, 
  and pking was almost non-existant. A few good months went by and then it happened... 
  the land filled up and no one could build anymore towers or large houses. Guilds 
  were formed and players were powerful enough to begin pking. The change was 
  almost overnight and it reverbirated though out the whole shard.  </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">The meek little Japs suddenly 
  turned into Grandmaster Mage PKs with guilds of 20-30 players who attacked in 
  organized groups. I can tell you for fact Hokuto has a higher GM Mage ratio 
  than any other shard. Those Japs are methodical! Americian PK developed too, 
  but here usually miner killers or solo PvPers who had short lived careers. Look 
  on the bounty board, why are 17 out of 20 pks Japs all with over 500 kills each? 
  Players fueded over land rights and it quickly devoloped into an us vs them 
  situaltion. The guild USA did not help either. It was a guild with over 200 
  Americians that killed solo Japanese players on sight all the time.  </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">The situations has now 
  become common place. Though USA is now gone, Americians are ill trusted and 
  some even get killed on sight for an US guild title. To make a long story short, 
  here is what I hear all the time. "I won't cheat you, I'm Japanese" and Goddamnit, 
  they are right. I can trust a Japanese guy to make fair trades or not loot my 
  corpse when I die. I can let a group of several of them I barely know in my 
  Tower and I ~know~ they will not take anything. Try that on Pacific.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">This brings up issues, as <a href="http://www.gaminginsider.com/">BitchX</a> 
  might say, if she ever updated any more.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">We can safely say now, beyond any 
  reasonable doubt, that the GMs are on a quest to make the People's Republic 
  of Everquest look like a flaming liberal bastion of free speech. I can understand 
  their side of it; there basically has been no enforced code of conduct within 
  UO for what, years now, and the dev team finally gave the support team the tools 
  to do the job, aka the server-side journal entries such as the one referenced 
  above. I guess this devolves into &quot;be careful what you ask for&quot;; we've 
  all bitched about foul-mouthed juvies running amuck in Brit, and corporations 
  are notorious for not having much toleration for grey areas.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">There is also some hostility between 
  Japanese and American players. I haven't seen much of it before because I rarely 
  played on West Coast shards in UO. On EQ, where all the &quot;shards&quot; are 
  located in San Diego, there's much more of a Japanese presence. Americans dislike 
  Japanese players because they can't be bothered to speak in English and often, 
  they feel, use their preventative cocoon of language to killsteal and do other 
  antisocial things within game. (Plus it's difficult to group with someone who 
  speaks in mostly consonants.) I can't really comment on how Japanese players 
  feel, since I speak about 5 words of Japanese. (If any Japanese players are 
  reading this and <a href="mailto:lum@webtoys.net">care to comment</a>, I'll 
  post it as a followup.) UO GMs have remarked in the past that Japanese shards 
  are completely a different animal from a support standpoint; while calls on 
  Western shards are usually of the he-said-she-said personal interaction problem 
  variety, calls on Japanese shards are 99% &quot;GM I AM STUCK&quot;. They don't 
  HAVE personal interaction problems; they are capable of behaving themselves 
  in a group environment. Or they are capable of self-policing. Or whatever.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">This whole discussion dances nicely 
  around the whole racism thing; I'm sure there are Japanese assholes and American 
  saints. But AS A GROUP Americans are poorly organized racist foul-mouthed retards 
  and Japanese are highly organized, insular, kill-stealing commando teams. And 
  I find the whole phenomenon interesting. I would love to group with Japanese 
  players in EQ, but my language skills aren't up to the task. But the whole experience 
  of walking up to a group of elves and hearing them talk amongst themselves in 
  what could be Elvish for all I would know the difference is one of those future-shock 
  moments; the world really <b>is</b> at our doorstep now.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Speaking of clueless gaijins, Dr. 
  Twister posted <a href="http://www.drtwister.com/ultimaonline/uo-indx.html">a 
  rant</a> about how the dev team isn't working on anything in UO. About 3 or 
  4 hours after the dev team, um, posted on<a href="http://support.uo.com/c_issue.html"> 
  what they were working on</a>. Now, I personally think that the dev team has 
  a few more priority items to complete before encapsulating the UOA feature set 
  in UO, but hey, that's just me; however, there actually IS a dev team, and they 
  aren't the UO2 dev team. I know, I talked to someone on the UO2 dev team over 
  a year ago, they are definitely a seperate group and it's going to be a very 
  different game. So cut DD some slack. They're trying. Of course, when they give 
  us what they ask for, it usually ends up with popular webmasters being banned 
  for saying dirty words, but that is, as always, the price of progress.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">I was on the small bank roof in Trinsic when I 
  overheard some guys talking about how they had a ton of lvl 1 maps.&nbsp; I 
  asked them if they would sell some.&nbsp; We agreed to a price of 1200 gp ea 
  for 100 maps, and he gated me to his vendor, where all the maps were in the 
  corner of his bag. I started buying them, checking the price of each one as 
  I went.&nbsp; Well&nbsp; sure enuf, there was a map for 80,000 gp. I left, stored 
  what maps I had&nbsp; and then came back.&nbsp; The scammer's name is Quinten 
  and he said &quot;I like&nbsp; screwing people&quot;.&nbsp; I paged a GM and 
  told him what this scammer was doing, and after several pages back and forth 
  describing the scam GM Darwin kept the stance that &quot;that's not really a 
  scam, more just being rude&quot;.&nbsp; Huh?&nbsp; If that's not a scam I don't 
  know what is!&nbsp; It was obvious to me that he understood what Quinten was 
  doing...&nbsp; Anyways I didn't press the issue.&nbsp; I was just amazed at 
  the lack of good judgement GM Darwin showed in this matter.&nbsp; I've seen 
  posts where scammers are punished and they're made to stop their scams, so I 
  wonder if Quinten was just a friend of the GMs. (This on PACIFIC)<br>

<p><font size="3" face="Arial">I know the Earth is going to fly off its axis now,

  part of doing business in the great social experiment of UO. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="3">There are scammers in EQ too, but since it's so 
  hard to actually travel anywhere, you tend to hear about them all in your area 
  eventually. (Speaking of which, don't trust Battyrider on Veeshan. In fact, 
  PK him early and often, since he's red.) This is probably another sign that

<p><font face="Arial"><i>(FullDisclosureNote: The person who sent me this was 
  our guild's GM. We were a roleplaying guild on Great Lakes who moved to Sonoma. 
  After we left the guild referred to took over our &quot;blessed&quot;, in other 
  words uniquely-decorated, keep and proclaimed themselves our successors. There 
  is no love lost between the two groups, thus the harassment described. Anyway, 
  on to the dish.)</i></font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">The situation: A GM blessed building was being 
  used to ban (and thus trap) then PK several players. There had been at least 
  3 people slain already in this ban-trap fashion. The GM added decorations allowed 
  for an exploit where anyone who was banned was also automatically trapped. Tensions 
  were high as a group of blue innocents stood outside the building conversing 
  with the PK's inside. I, like many others, walked inside the building, and was 
  instantly banned and trapped.&nbsp; In addition to this the foul language, verbal 
  taunts and sexually crude references seemed overly present from a couple of 
  the decorated buildings patrons.<br>
  <br>
  I (like several others) paged a GM. More specifically for the comments directed 
  at my person (not my in game character) and the general crap that was going 
  on. With 20+ outraged people outside the building... the PeeKay's didn't dare 
  gang bang any more trapped people. Doing my best (in the heat of the moment) 
  I attempted to squish an explanation of what was going on in 40 characters (the 
  limit for paging a GM).<br>
  <br>
  About 20 minutes later a GM appeared (GM Elowyn) who unbanned myself and 4 or 
  5 others from the building and then teleported us off of the trapped spot. Then 
  in the following 30 seconds the GM deleted the 2 pillars (part of the blocking 
  exploitation) and vanished. Fact is you can still be trapped there... there 
  is a fence and once you are banned you<br>
  cannot walk anywhere... (building on 2 sides of you, fence on the 3rd and steps 
  on the fourth). Now, what are the problems with this picture?<br>
  <br>
  First off the GM never addressed the ban-trap exploitation of a supposedly public 
  building. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">Or how about the fact that this GM blessed location 
  was intended for role-playing and not insta-ban mindless Player killing.<br>
  <br>
  Next how about my original harassment call? In 30 seconds the GM clearly read 
  20+ minutes of text? The never addressed or messaged anyone... they showed up... 
  removed 2 out of the several obstructions and vanished in OSI style.<br>
  <br>
  Finally, what about the next person who was killed (only 5 minutes after the 
  GM left).<br>
  <br>
  Well as usual with OSI you swallow your lumps and carry on. Only today you don't... 
  because you get a nice letter in the old email in box 'you got mail'. It says 
  if you use the Harassment paging option again your account will be punished 
  (gee thanks... I've already been a victim once guys).<br>
  <br>
  This coming from a GM who didn't read any logs, didn't attend the scene for 
  more then 30 seconds. Didn't fix the PK exploitation. Didn't address the misuse 
  of a GM blessed building, didn't ask anyone there any questions. It is pretty 
  simple really... I was being harassed (And when you are harassed... trust me 
  you will know) and I properly used that paging feature only to have OSI throw 
  it back in my face. Who is the GM (who spends 30 seconds on the call) to say 
  who is or is not being harassed when they spend no time on the call? How can 
  he legitimize anyone's claims when he asks no questions? How can anyone explain 
  this in 40 characters or less?<br>
  <br>
  Well I am not the only one it turns out. Several people 'got mail'. And well... 
  not surprisingly enough several people are extremely pissed off that a GM who 
  really didn't spend any time investigating or resolving the issues at hand. 
  They pretty much said 'don't page me or I can have your account banned'. The 
  whole attitude is disgusting.<br>
  </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">There was a fair contingent of players who were 
  not only subject to the untouchable exploitation of several KewlDewds who happened 
  to have bought up (yes you heard it right.. they bought it for cold hard UO 
  cash) a GM decorated building!&nbsp; and hey.. anyone who comes to take a look 
  see (all the nice decorations and wow.. neat a statue!) can be easily banned 
  and firewalled to death (you cant recall because you get banned into a nice 
  warm firewall just waiting to kill you, your spells get interrupted and you 
  are a super easy kill.. wow * flex * you da man Mr. PeeKay!!!).<br>
  <br>
  So the solution is to send the victims a good old letter saying 'page us again 
  with this option and your account will be banned'&nbsp;&nbsp; great guys.. well 
  done.. the PeeKays are laughing it up as you make a total joke of yourselves...<br>

  NEWS FROM UO FOR ALL THREE OF YOU WHO STILL PLAY</font></b></p>
<p><font color="#FFFFFF" face="Arial" size="3">According to DD, the reason why 
  the Patch Server threatens to ban you from UO for daring to page GMs - thanks 
  to the new logging system, UO *automatically* sends a dump of your server-side 
  log to the GM whenever you helpfully page hitting the &quot;harassment&quot; 
  button.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Arial" color="#FFFFFF">Whoops.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Arial" color="#FFFFFF">He also said that 90% of the harassment 
  calls GMs take are bogus. Woo woo! (By the way this was all on Usenet. Props 
  to <a href="http://www.deja.com/">Dejanews</a>.)</font></p>
<p><font color="#FFFF00" size="3" face="Arial"><i>06/04/99 8:30 PM </i><b>THINGS 
  THAT MAKE YOU GO, &quot;Hmmm.&quot;</b></font></p>
<div><font face="Arial">Not much going on. I promised some deep thoughts from 
  my UO time, and here they are:</font> 
  <blockquote> 
    <p><font face="Arial"><i>&quot;Damn, you make a LOT more money from tailoring 
      than anything else.&quot;</i></font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><font face="Arial">So if you're doing anything else - mining, tinkering, 
    fishing, PKing, adventuring, programming, sleeping... quit it and go make 
    a new character with 50 tailoring. Oh, and I think I can safely say, without 
    a certain Utility That Dares Not Speak Its Name tailoring is also the most 
    boring thing one can ever do, and that includes listening to Celine Dion.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial">Speaking of Celine Dion, has Canada EVER had decent musicians? 
    I mean, the closest they came in my humble opinion was Rush, and I just can't 
    work past Neil Peart's butt obsession. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial">In Everquest news, Verant hired Brian Hook to lead their 
    programming staff. There's an <a href="http://www.voodooextreme.com/articles/interview_hook2.html">interview</a> 
    with him up already on VoodooExtreme, but if you live under a rock and never 
    heard of these little game called Quake II and Quake III, he worked on those. 
    Now, can you imagine Origin going out and hiring programming staff of this 
    caliber? No offense to the guys there (Pandemonium in particular seems to 
    be eager to <i>actually fix the client</i> which is kind of overdue) but Origin's 
    hiring policy is hiring really young guys who want to break into the gaming 
    business, already play UO, and have been pestering DD or the GMs for jobs. 
    Hmm. On the other hand, OSI is actually one of the sanest gaming companies 
    in Texas to work for; some of them are <a href="http://www.dallasobserver.com/1999/011499/feature1-1.html">just 
    sad</a>.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial"> Anyway, Mr. Hook (or &quot;Grandmaster B&quot; as he 
    likes to be called) had an interesting thing to say about EQ in particular 
    and multiplayer RPGs in general:</font></p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p><i><font size="2" face="Arial">Here is a problem I see with a LOT of genres 
      in gaming -- they appeal to a niche, sometimes a very hardcore niche, but 
      instead of trying to break out of that niche, game companies cater to that 
      niche and attempt to have the largest piece of that small market possible.&nbsp; 
      I think this is actually going in the WRONG direction.&nbsp; Take a situation 
      where EQ completely dominates the on-line RPG market -- what then?&nbsp; 
      That's probably a user base of MAYBE 500K users.&nbsp; I think that's shooting 
      a little low.&nbsp; I don't think it should be a case of &quot;EQ kicking 
      UO's ass&quot; or &quot;AC kicking EQ's&quot; ass, I think that some of 
      these games should GROW the pie THEN take a larger piece of it.</font></i></p>
    <p><i><font size="2" face="Arial">My wife is a perfect example of this.&nbsp; 
      She is not an avid game player -- she played Myst and Riven, but really 
      didn't have the coordination or mindset to excel at a game like Quake.&nbsp; 
      She started playing EQ because I did, but even then I had to help her through 
      the first four or five levels of play because there is a lot of stuff that 
      EQ's designers assumed about the player that simply weren't true, e.g. that 
      they came from a MUD, MOO, or RPG background.</font></i></p>
    <p><i><font size="2" face="Arial">I'm not saying that &quot;dumbing down&quot; 
      genres is the answer, but I do believe that MANY game genres -- first person 
      shooters, RPGs, flight-sims, military sims, real-time strategy -- could 
      go to greater lengths to make their games more approachable to players that 
      don't have a lot of experience in those genres or do not have the benefit 
      of friends that can show them the ropes when starting out.</font></i></p>
    <p><i><font size="2" face="Arial">I'm pretty familiar with games, yet I made 
      many crucial and stupid mistakes with my human shadowknight in EQ. Now, 
      keep in mind that I had never played UO or EQ before I created that character, 
      so when it said &quot;you are hated in most lands&quot; that was interpreted 
      as &quot;prices will be higher from merchants&quot;.&nbsp; It wasn't until 
      after I had spent a LOT of time getting to level 10 (and when you first 
      start out,you don't know how to power level to level 10 in a few hours, 
      so that took me a week) that I learned about the joys of being Killed On 
      Sight.&nbsp; Part of this is because up until level 10 I didn't go anywhere 
      but Blackburrow and Qeynos.</font></i></p>
    <p><i><font size="2" face="Arial">I could easily see someone investing that 
      time to discover &quot;Hey, the SK just isn't for me, I don't like being 
      killed and universally hated, but you know what, I just don't have time 
      to build up another character&quot; then trashing their character and disabling 
      their account.&nbsp; This doesn't serve either the game developer's or the 
      player's best interests -- the former is losing a customer, and the latter 
      is missing out on a great game experience and/or has wasted a lot of time.</font></i></p>
    <p><i><font size="2" face="Arial">I also made some pretty significant purchasing 
      blunders. &nbsp; I bought a store bought weapon (axe) because its specs 
      were better than my tarnished longsword, but I had no idea that I should 
      have been saving up for a mino axe instead.&nbsp; I bought leather armor 
      instead of patchwork or saving up for banded.&nbsp; I bought a small lantern, 
      then large lantern, before realizing I should just buy a lightstone. Granted, 
      for some players, this learning experience is the fun part.&nbsp; For other 
      players -- the ones with limited time -- they'd like to maximize their time 
      adventuring as opposed to killing fire beetles and gnoll pups so that they 
      can save up enough money for a helmet.</font></i></p>
    <p><i><font size="2" face="Arial">You can NOT take for granted that a player 
      is going to make all the right decisions early AND is willing to spend an 
      indefinite amount of time making up for poor decisions later.&nbsp; Nor 
      can you assume that they have access to fan Web pages, newsgroups, or friends 
      that know how to play the game. This is particularly important for a subscription 
      model of game.&nbsp; With a non-subscription game, you have to worry about 
      returns, and that's it. With a subscription model, you have to worry about 
      returns AND maintaining a loyal subscriber base.&nbsp; So even if you made 
      that sale to someone, you have to prove to them that their time is well 
      spent playing that game, which means making mistakes somewhat recoverable 
      and also by holding their hands at earlier levels while they learn the ropes.&nbsp; 
      There is a common base of knowledge that most players have by about 9th 
      level, especially specific to a character class or race, that could easily 
      be imparted at early levels through their guild master or via simple quests.</font></i></p>
    <p><i><font size="2" face="Arial">Training missions, on-line help, chat servers, 
      good documentation, and strategy guides all go towards making the early 
      levels less painful.&nbsp; Some people adopt the attitude that your first 
      character is a throw away character that you use to learn about what NOT 
      to do, and this simply isn't a tenable solution if you want to expand past 
      the hardcore market of a hundred or two hundred thousand users.&nbsp; If 
      you want to entice and retain the casual gamer -- someone that plays for 
      an hour or two a night, at MOST -- then you need to make the game more approachable.&nbsp; 
      This doesn't mean making the game weaker or &quot;dumbing it down&quot;, 
      it simply means making some stuff that is obvious to hardcore gamers slightly 
      more obvious to the casual gamer.&nbsp; It means teaching newbies the basics 
      of the game with as little frustration as possible.&nbsp; I've met 5th and 
      6th level players that didn't know how to do group say or trade.&nbsp; I've 
      also met 1st level players wandering around the North Karanas because they 
      didn't know better.</font></i></p>
    <p><i><font size="2" face="Arial">Unfortunately, hardcore players and power 
      gamers rail at the thought of a game possibly being &quot;dumbed down&quot;, 
      but that's because they have the experience or time to learn a game's intricacies, 
      and they need to keep in mind that the vast majority of game players just 
      can't devote their lives to a game.</font></i></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><font face="Arial">Thank GOD someone is saying this. One of my longest beefs 
    about UO and now EQ is that they are both aimed at losers with no lives. Someone 
    on disability or suspended from junior high, who is online 23 hours a day 
    doing nothing but powerlevelling his character is already 50th level on EQ, 
    after having 3 castles in UO. We're supposed to compete with him? Or just 
    let him own the game? Bleah.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial">OSI has said that their development efforts currently 
    are aimed at making UO more newbie-friendly; hopefully they'll read the above 
    and take it to heart.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial">Or failing that, just hire John Carmack to work on UO2.</font>
</div>
<p><font color="#FFFF00" size="3" face="Arial"><i>06/02/99 3:30 PM </i></font><b><font face="Arial" size="3" color="#FFFF00">A 
  MODEST PROPOSAL</font></b></p>
<div><font face="Arial">I know, I know, I said I was quitting UO. It's like smoking, 
  I've quit UO so many times I'm an expert. OK, but here's some ideas I've gotten 
  from the vacation.</font> 
  <p><font face="Arial">One of EQ's best features is its pvp switch. It's not 
    perfect, but the environment fostered is far saner then the rep system in 
    UO. It has convinced me that PKing in UO is probably its worst feature. Considering 
    that I used to *be* a PK, it's something of a paradigm shift. But running 
    around EQ, you find that without the economic incentive for players to die 
    and be looted, you see much less k3wldewdness, and more willingness to help 
    each other.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial">The rep system should be tightened in UO. How? Some very 
    simple rules.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial">No stat loss for reds, UNLESS their victims are blue. 
    If they kill a blue, they take stat loss IMMEDIATELY, not upon death. So basically, 
    everyone gets 5 free PKs, then either they behave and fight willing combatants 
    or their characters go into the toilet.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial">Blues cannot be looted by players. (Monsters may loot 
    them freely, however.) Reds can be looted freely by anyone. If a corpse is 
    blue, only its player can open it up. Seems simple enough. (Also make the 
    blue decay time a lot longer so they have a hope of getting there.)</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial">If you implement these two rules, UO will become a VERY 
    different game.</font>

<p><font size="3" face="Arial">So I'll fire up UO this evening and see if it still 
  holds any attraction for me. Who knows, I might even have a thought or two while 
  doing it. Hell, I might even post about it. YOU NEVER KNOW.</font></p>
<p><font color="#FFFF00" size="3" face="Arial"><i>06/01/99 2:00 AM </i></font><b><font face="Arial" size="3" color="#FFFF00">HEY, 
  I UPDATE MORE OFTEN THEN BITCH-X</font></b></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="3">Clearing out the decks, let's work through some 
  <i>issues</i>.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Arial">An annoying number of people have sent me bitchy 
  mail saying basically I was responsible for their computer being infected with 
  BackOrifice or something because I posted a link to UONude. OK. Those of you 
  with a clue can pretty much recite what I'm going to say from memory... just 
  go ahead and skip down to the picture of Uma Thurman. Can't miss it.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="3">OK, for the rest of you nimrods...</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Arial">(1) I am not fucking responsible for your computer. 
  You are. You know, the dopehead that's sitting in front of the screen drooling 
  right now. That's YOU. You are the one who actually controls what appears on 
  your screen. I know it's a hard concept to grasp, but work with me here.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="3">(2) If you do not have a constantly updating virus 
  checker on your PC, you have no business on the Net. Get the hell off. I'm sick 
  of reading about losers who open programs total strangers send them in the mail 
  and find out their next month's phone bill has $79,003.82 in calls to a sex 
  line in Bulgaria. As far as I'm concerned, if you don't take proper care of 
  your machine, you DESERVE to be ripped off and have your hard drive wiped. It's 
  evolution in action, baby.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Arial">(3) I didn't download UONude. Hell, I don't even 
  look at pictures of naked women on the net. For some reason, and I know this 
  may be just totally outside the limits of imagination for a lot of you, I prefer 
  actual naked women. They tend to be a little more interactive, and some of them 
  are better conversationalists. If you did download UONude hoping to see little 
  pixilated penises and breasts swaying in the breeze as everyone's mules run 
  by in town, you need to turn the computer off, breath deeply several times, 
  walk outside, stand in the middle of the road, and let the next car run you 
  the fuck over, just so there's no outside chance of you ever breeding and polluting 
  the gene pool with your chromosomal code. Failing that, go out and date an actual 
  woman. (Women may feel free to replace this with men, in fact preferably other 
  men reading this, assuming they stop drooling.) You might find yourself playing 
  online games a HELL of a lot less. Whoulda thunkit?</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Arial">Just so you are absolutely sure what a woman is, 
  should you decide to go out and risk actually meeting one and talking to one, 
  below is a picture of Uma Thurman. Thank you, and get the hell out of my yard. 
  </font></p>
<p align="center"><a href="http://www.windworld.com/mwalker/"><img src="http://stormcat.simplenet.com/uma040.jpg" alt="Uuuuuuuuma." border="1" width="320" height="240"></a></p>
<p><font face="Arial">OK, now that we lost the drooling idiots (they clicked on 
  the Uma picture hoping to see pictures with her face badly pasted on some nudie-mag 
  scan) let's break down what's going on in UO, why I really don't care, and what 
  else I'm up to.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">Dr. TwisTer (see, I remembered the correct capItaliZaTIon 
  of HiS NaME) posted a letter from an Anonymous Gamemaster saying that basically 
  the Dev Team is giving up on UO and working on UO2 now. Here's my thoughts on 
  the subject...</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">(1) No GM is ever going to write Dr. TwisTer -- they'd need 
  to learn how to use email first.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">(2) The Dev Team isn't going to tell the GMs why they're 
  not working on UO.&nbsp; That is something like Bill Clinton sending an email 
  to the postal sorters in Pawtucket on why he's still bombing the crap out of 
  Serbia.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">(3) The Dev Team is actually still working on UO, as you'd 
  know if you downloaded Pandemonium's latest client. It may not be player races 
  and necromancy, but hey, what is. Oh yeah, in EQ you can be a drow necromancer, 
  not that has anything to do with it.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">Speaking of EQ, I still suck at it. I'm a 5th level Druid 
  on Veeshan, which means I'm just high enough in level to REALLY suck... can't 
  cast any decent spells, can't hold my own in melee any more, I just suck. Oh 
  well, I'm holding out for 9th level when I get better spells. See, it's like 
  crack. Just one more hit on the pipe, baby. On Rallos Zek (otherwise known as 
  the PvP server or the Server that's Not Candyland) I gave up being a drow because 
  the drow newbie zone is wayyyyy too crowded and started a troll named Lummy. 
  If you see Lummy be nice to him, because he's not very bright and also because 
  he likes to hurt people a lot. Trolls are like that.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">Maybe later I'll comment on why there's nothing to bitch 
  about in the People's Republic of Everquest, when the political officers aren't 
  looking over my shoulder. Really, it's a good example of why sometimes harsh 
  strictly enforced rules actually work once in a while. Kind of like adulthood, 
  but with minotaur axes.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">Also picked up Birth of the Federation, a Star Trek strategy 
  game. Yes, I am a trekkie, deal with it (at least I don't have uniforms or anything). 
  In MY personal version of the Federation, the Prime Directive is giving the 
  beatdown to those annoying Ferengi. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">More later, it's real late and I should probably go to bed 
  and get up and go to work and all that good shit. See? The page isn't dead! 
  Just sort of zombiefied and without focus, just the way you like it.</font></p>
