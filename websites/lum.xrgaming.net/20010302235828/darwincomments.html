<blockquote> 
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> I just want to tell you that I 
    had the priviledge of knowing GM Darwin, and he was one of the coolest people 
    in the UO world. What he did was wrong, but he did it for a noble reason. 
    Call him Robin Hood if you want. Anyway, I want to put to rest any arguments 
    about Darwin's character, he was a kind, cheerful person, and friendly person. 
    Also, if what he did isn't evidence of his character, I dont know what is. 
    He risked losing his job, and possible lawsuits (although there arent any) 
    to help a friend in need. How can you have a better friend than that? </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">-- Nemesis</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Truthfully, I commend Kevin for 
    his honesty and loyalty as a friend. But on the other hand, that is extremely 
    wrong from a moral perspective. If I'm not mistaken he's young, so I can understand 
    the mistake. I'd hate to think about putting that on my resume though :P I'm 
    sure that the references won't be all that forthcoming from OSI when it comes 
    time. Definitely an interesting turn for online games. I'm wondering what 
    laws might be able to be set from issues similar to these. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">-- Marduk</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> This makes me sad...very sad. 
    Man sometimes I wish I didn't know or have an idea what went on behind the 
    scenes at OSI. 10 Months as a variable/temporary employee at $10 an hour must 
    be really hard, I feel for the guy. Now I think I understand why they sat 
    apart and aloof at the last Dev Luncheon I went too. At the same time he really 
    makes me mad for abusing his power...might I have done the same thing...perhaps 
    man its a tough call. I do know that when I ran a ROM 2.4 Mud long ago I used 
    to twink my own characters :(. I think all this will cause is GMs to be much 
    more careful about this. I doubt it will ever stop... </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">-- Relanor</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> You sure do have a nice way of 
    shedding light on situations. Nice interview... </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">-- Dr. TwisTer</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> This amount of corruption leaves 
    a taste in my mouth that can only be compared to the taste of blackstrap molasses. 
    That warm, gooey, almost sludge-like quality that was entrancing with pancakes 
    and butter, but after biting down makes you wonder where you dumped the oil 
    from your Ford's last jiffy-lube. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">It's sick, too bad the pancakes 
    were buggy, it might've been a decent meal. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">When I watch the Fox network, I 
    can see all manner of police shows. I can see actual policemen on the job, 
    dealing with irate, incoherent people. Of course, under the camera these men 
    do seriously appear to be tackling the daunting task of making sense of events 
    as recanted by people in such a state of panicky thoughtlessness as to make 
    you wonder how they find the bottom of a toiletbowl with their piss when the 
    policemen aren't around. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I'm going to make the assumption 
    that your interview with Mr. Roseler was real, and not satire. I hope I'm 
    being neither presumptuous, nor dense. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><i>[Kevin] Ahh, where to start... 
    well, most of what the little jerk said was true.. there is no denying what 
    I did. A really good friend of mine was and is going through a very very rough 
    spot in life... he is having marriage troubles... and needed to get out of 
    debt fast in order to try and save his marriage... </i></font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><i>...well,, kinda a long time 
    ago, like when that first account was sold. I mean I knew if I was caught 
    that I would be fired. But, if I had to do it all over I would do it again... 
    a friend needed me and I stick by my friends. </i> </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">A small, trite word comes to mind 
    while reading that..... oh yes, it's "Moron". Now, I will not get into the 
    argument that Christ started so long ago by asking the first person who hasn't 
    gone against the virtues to cast the first stone paver. Certainly we've all 
    done something on the job that could be classified as misuse of resources/position 
    that could cause the systems that we work for to take disciplinary action. 
    Whether it be arriving 5 minutes late back from lunch, or miscalculating your 
    travel miles on your car, we've all done it. That's not disturbing, and it's 
    probably as old as the hourly wage. What's disturbing is Mr Roseler stating 
    quite clearly that he would, "Do it again." </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">This world that he (now) was god 
    in is a place where hundreds of thousands of people come for a level playing 
    field. And this loser, believing that dishonesty at work is somehow the better 
    method of supporting his friend, would twice violate a game that all of us 
    expect to be a fair game, a virtual world of steadfast laws? Who is it better 
    for when people think so selfishly as to discount the experience of thousands 
    of people, so as to make a pathetic amount of cash to help a friend who's 
    been a little loose with their checkbook? <b>The personal financial troubles 
    of one person are not worth the destruction of the trust of thousands of people</b>. 
    You're poor, your friends are poor? So what, shut up and and stop the fucking 
    whining. It's called welfare, I've lived with it, so have millions of others. 
    It's not a bruise that you can't tell your next girlfriend about, it's almost 
    a badge of honor to have been poor and maintained your sense of humor. What 
    Darwin did was wrong, he killed and yet he would do it again? Move over counselor 
    rennovation, lets talk about rennovating the GM screening process. If the 
    people hired to police this game decide that profit is more important than 
    keeping the game fair for everyone, AS IS PROVEN BY THE REACTION TO NIGHTHAWK'S 
    WHINING, then the game is simply revealing itself for what it was... diablo 
    2.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Welcome to Diablo 2. No, cheating 
    doesn't come in easy-to-swallow/download tablets... instead you must use your 
    powers of bardic persuasion to entice the gods of the land into placing your 
    duped buildings for you, that is if you can pry them away from the html of 
    eBay.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">-- Rainman</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">This whole incident is just another 
    saga in the battle between the players and OSI. The trust is broken further 
    each time, and now no player will probably ever trust a GM, ever. This also 
    goes to show that Darwin is likely a selfish asshole. How can one do this 
    in the first place let alone say they would do it again? How can a few extra 
    bucks be worth viloating the trust of thousands of players....no, people? 
    Thats not exactly right. Neither should OSI giving nighthawk boat loads of 
    items, although this is a greater justification for that. It was a replacement 
    for his lost earnings, not a personal ebay ticket. Would have been easier 
    to just keep him banned. Although thats another story there. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">As far as twister goes, OSI needs 
    to exercise one of their commandments on his ass, Thou shalt be terminated 
    ("Further, Origin Systems reserves the rights to terminate the Service at 
    any time without further obligation to you."). The world could be a happier 
    place.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">-- Inherent</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> How to start this off? Heres a 
    thought. TwisTer is one immature little fucknut. Why? Because of a GAME, an 
    ONLINE GAME, an INTERNET(and very stressful at times) FORM OF ENTERTAINMENT, 
    he cost someone their job. As you can tell simply by reading his posts as 
    of late, hes been fed up with OSI, claiming everyone who doesn't give him 
    the help HE feels he deserves, is fucked up. Normally I just shrug off TwisTer's 
    bullshit, but this time it hits really close to home. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">GM Darwin has always been one really 
    nice guy. At Jhelom bank, in Catskills, he one time dressed up the town cryer 
    in a pirates outfit, and gave the bankers neon colored hair, just for a laugh 
    with a few players. I had the opportunity to talk to him, and hes pretty understanding, 
    and a really cool guy. Now I'm not going to start some sob case story, but 
    you get the point I'm trying to say, I hope. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Bottom line - TwisTer should of 
    just blew off his steam and let things go. But no. Thats not TwisTer's style. 
    He pry got dozens of E-mails saying "d3wd u shuud get bak at him", and, as 
    we all know TwisTer the show-boat LOVES to "give the readers what they want", 
    he went off and spent countless hours and got someone fired who was simply 
    trying to help a friend of his. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In my eyes, the real man here is 
    Darwin. He didn't just disappear, he stated loud and clear what he did, and 
    why he did it. At least he has the balls to admit what he did was wrong. TwisTer 
    on the other hand, is one little boy who needs to grow up and mature to the 
    level of realizing when a game is a game. I don't care how blue the thief 
    was, it wasn't worth digging up dirt on a GM who, even though he did something 
    wrong, was one of the damned best GMs out there. Oh well, as we know, TwisTer 
    only cares about two things: Getting # 1 on his top 100 list, and "doing the 
    UO audience a favor". Heres a favor he can do for me; He can take his thumb, 
    shove it up his ass, and rotate. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">-- Rankal</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Subject: *looks at ring in Lum's 
    nose*</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Well Lum...I got to admit, that 
    was a nice interview. Kevin sure did make himself look like such a good guy! 
    You all share a beer afterwards? You know...I really like the part about him 
    doing it for his friend....and that he didn't get dime one! How noble Kevin! 
    You know for a strugling parent with a friend with such HUGE financial debt...I 
    just dont know how you managed to do <a href="http://cgi3.ebay.com/aw-cgi/eBayISAPI.dll?MfcISAPICommand=ViewBidItems&amp;userid=imagine691&amp;completed=1&amp;all=0&amp;rows=25">this</a>. 
    Looks like his "friend" was in dire need of several computers and all kinds 
    of cool shit....I bet that 19" flat screen saved the marriage eh? What a hypocrite..... 
    Lum....I expected better from you.... </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">-- Brules</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I was thinking about all this GM 
    Darwin mess and I gotta say the more I think about it the more I'm amazed 
    it's taken this long for something like this happen. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In my opinion with the amount that 
    GMs are paid, combined with the potential benefits they can reap from abusing 
    their powers, the GM Darwin kind of abuse is inevitable and if anything will 
    accelerate. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Lets examine a hypothetical GM. 
    Now GM Kewl is a 22 year old college student working at OSI for spending money 
    at college. Now he gets paid $10 an hour. Assuming he works 40 hours a week, 
    which is probably an too much, but just for arguments sake we'll go with the 
    standard 40 hour work week. So before taxes he's pulling in $400 a week. $800 
    a month. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Now lets say GM Kewl has the oppurtunity 
    to set up an operation in which he creates UO money and deeds in exchange 
    for RL dollars. Now GM Kewl is a sneaky bastard and has no desire to get busted 
    like the altruistic GM Darwin. So he goes to great lengths to conceal his 
    identity and what he's doing. He has a dorm friend sign up for an account 
    and uses that one from a dial out service instead of the schools internal 
    network. Useing his friend's account he networks with other players, maybe 
    gets in contact with the powerplayer, kewl dood, UOP usin element that doesn't 
    give a damn about the rules. Then he uses his GM char to creates tons of cash 
    or regs or rare items or whatever for the rule breaker friends in exchange 
    for cold hard RL cash. Either that or he could just go the ebay route but 
    be smart about it. I doubt he'd get caught. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Then you have a situation of a 
    guy making $800 a month, probably much less than that, pulling in over 1k 
    in a weekend. How can you expect at least some of the GMs not to fall for 
    this kind of temptation. When a kid can pull in up to 6 or 7k a month if he's 
    good, and all he faces if he gets caught is the loss of a crappy $10 an hour 
    job he could replace in two seconds with his computer skills. I mean that's 
    really serious money. Especially for someone in college. Hell that'll keep 
    the cheap beer and pizza coming non stop all year, or pay for a car, or an 
    apartment, or tution, ect. This is just too much money for the GMs not to 
    cheat. OSI either needs a network of NARCs in the game to catch the GMs or 
    a Internal Affairs type organization that keeps tabs on the GMs. Of course 
    considering they won't even pay $10 an hour for a couple extra college kids 
    so there is a GM on every shard all the time, I don't think my ideas are gonna 
    be implemented soon. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Not matter what GMs are gonna cheat. 
    OSI just has to find a way to contain them. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">-- Nicademus</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> ok...i dont think TwisTer did 
    anything wrong posting about darwin, or any other gms or osi...i expect it... 
    but...the thing i question, is why he sounded so pissed? or why anybody would 
    be so pissed?...if TwisTer found a way to dupe castle deeds, him and all his 
    freinds would be rich in game..and at least a couple would think the words 
    Ebay..and get a little cash in real life... ..now look heres a guy with a 
    way to get that gold in game...and he thought Ebay...as far as i can tell 
    hes no diffrent then TwisTer... and yes a lot of other players would do the 
    same thing..this meens YOU...really ask yourself..put your self in the position 
    that Darwin portrayed himself to be in...would you risk your job to help a 
    friend? what if you thought you could do it without getting cought? hell what 
    if there was no friend and you just saw a way to make cash? you're looking 
    at temptation here...i mean look at the world we live in...where a lot of 
    people are convinced that money is the only way to gain happiness...</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">-- Grim</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Criminals *always* have 2 things 
    to say. They either deny all connection with the crime, or they have some 
    sort of bleeding-heart justification for it. I'm wondering if Darwin didn't 
    work at UO, but worked at say...a bank - would he steal 7k from the vault 
    to fund his noble "Robin Hood" scheme? </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I'm sorry. Darwin broke the trust 
    of thousands of people, and permanently damaged the reputation of the remaining 
    UO staff. For that he should never be forgiven, and for that - he should never 
    work in this industry again. Clearly, this guy has no sense of morals and 
    proper behavior. I shake my head at the failure of his parents to instill 
    the basic tenants of right vs wrong and "the end does not justify the means". 
    I once had a high opinion of Darwin, but he showed himself to be a man of 
    no class and his "hey I put my head on the block for a friend" excuse just 
    sounds like all the voices coming out of the penetentary windows. "I needed 
    to buy food, so I robbed the QuickieMart!" please. How insulting.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">-- Bob</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Some Monday you had there - Revealed 
    Twister's Identity as well as the fact that he used to be (may still be for 
    all we know) one of those pathetic blue robe wearing souls! Also got that 
    interview with Kevin, which is kind of the point of my writing. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I've read some of the replies you've 
    received, which only inspires me to write more. The majority of people seem 
    to be pulling behind this guy which can only make me wonder WHY??? Besides 
    for the fact that we live in an overly liberal country I can see no reason 
    why anyone would side with a criminal - and thats exactly what he is! </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"I'm going to say this one more 
    time..." (quote included for all you damn liberals out there) The guy STOLE 
    from the company. His reasoning behind it is irrevelant. It is my feeling 
    that OSI should prosecute this guy for theft - or even worse, contact the 
    IRS anonymously concerning unclaimed wages on his behalf - that'll teach the 
    fucker! </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">It is impossible to feel sorry, 
    or even wose, look up to someone who feels a sense of contempt for his employer 
    for only paying him 10$/hr (which is a bit more then I made while working 
    full time to pay for college tuition and what-not) and decides to take it 
    in his own hands to generate an additional salary (regardless of its use) 
    for himself! Now, as one of your repliers earlier indicated, we all cheat 
    in some way or another but there is BIG fucking difference between stealing 
    a coke out of the company refrigerator without putting the .50 in the soda 
    fund and ripping off nearly 8 THOUSAND DOLLARS!!! </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Now do I see OSI in the same light 
    as before? Well pretty much so. Its common knowledge that there is favoritism 
    in the game and probably a little bit of corruption here and there, but in 
    light of the recent story I believe OSI has a responsibility to all of us 
    that kick in 10$/month to procecute this slimeball as (and many of you liberals 
    might not see it this way) by flooding the market with his "fool's" gold he 
    inadvertantly lowered the value of the rest of our gold that we earned through 
    honest channels. Once again I feel compelled to include another liberal favorite... 
    "Its the Economy Stupid!". </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Take it how you will Lum, but don't 
    ever feel sorry for the criminal! May the prick rot in some Texas jail!</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">-- Cynic (part of that vast right-wing 
    conspiracy)</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">There are comments on here from 
    people who say that the guy was real nice etc etc and was just helping out 
    a friend. This just has to be the most lame stuff I have ever read. The guy 
    was a crook, a thief a real life scoundrel. After he gets caught he 'comes 
    clean' and this somehow makes him OK? LOL </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">And this poor soul only gets paid 
    10 bucks/hour ? Ah, my heart bleeds. I mean, its such a real hard job is it 
    not. Cruel OSI. I mean, GM on a GAME should earn you what ? 50K, 100K year 
    at least. Tell the people who have to work in McDonalds about this poor guys 
    hard life. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">As to how he was detected and the 
    rewards or not given to this Nighthawk character ? Well, all I can say is 
    SO WHAT ? BIG DEAL. Please tell me how it effects other players. All the people 
    complaining are just bitching or plain jealous. I don't play on his shard 
    but I COULD NOT CARE LESS.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">If it was not for all the lamers 
    that go out and buy accounts/gold etc on ebay for real money then this would 
    not have happened. I personally do not think that real money should be allowed. 
    Its one thing to use virtual gold via UOMarket to buy things, another to use 
    real life cash. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">A final comment. Sure I bitch big 
    time bout bugs in the game. I admit that. But, I get on with playing the game. 
    I do not get jealous over other people. And in my opinion that is what a lot 
    of this is all about. Nighthawk got his reward. You might think it unfair 
    or whatever. Just get on with playing and forget it. If it has a direct effect 
    on you then all well and good. But please, save me the in game morality issues. 
    Real life is more important, and what Darwin did was a real life issue. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">-- Mick</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I read the Darwin Saga and the 
    whole thing sent my <b>Spidey-Sense</b>® tingling. For the love of all that 
    is Holy, does GM Darwin expect me to believe that what he did was anything 
    but total and utter bullshit? Everything out of this kid's mouth is self-serving 
    crap. It's not bad enough that he stole from the company he worked for. Or 
    that he got caught because he worked over a customer so bad that the guy actually 
    made it a mission to bring him down. Now we're supposed to get all weepy because 
    OSI doesn't get tough on harassers, and because one of his friends is on the 
    outs with the missus (maybe if he stopped playing UO so much, his marriage 
    might be in better shape, but I digress). </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">If you take a snapshot of Darwin 
    and examine it from a distance you see a young individual who's idea of working 
    is getting paid 10 bucks an hour to play a video game. You would think that 
    a sane individual, when faced with the hardships life is certain to dish out, 
    could think up several legal ways to earn extra money before deciding that 
    stealing from his company was "a-okay." I guess nothing expresses friendship 
    more than fucking over someone else, cause hey, your pal deserves it more. 
    Everyone needs to realize that what Darwin did was illegal, immoral, and worst 
    of all, just fucking lazy. What a lazy bastard. Your friend needs you man, 
    go show some balls and get a part time job at Dairy Queen to help him out. 
    </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I know that we all hate OSI and 
    nothing would please us more than to see the collective whole slide under 
    a gas truck and taste their own blood. I also understand how easy it is to 
    take the side of a hard working, underpaid employee over that of the rich 
    corporation who's only concern is raking in the dough. But we are smart enough 
    to understand that both those concepts are stereotypes. Individual people 
    have good opportunities to earn the money they need to survive, and businesses 
    can't let anyone steal from them for any reason, regardless of how much money 
    they pull in every quarter. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Darwin, this Bard would ask that 
    if you look back at this and learn anything, please realize that your friend 
    was in need of your help. Stealing dishonored him, you, and the validity of 
    his struggle. Remember that the hardest of times are the moments that define 
    who we are. When the chips are down, it's not time to cave in, it's time to 
    show everyone what you are really worth. I look back on the last three years 
    of my life and see the hardships I had to endure. My dad had heart surgery, 
    my mom died unexpectedly and I lost my job. Brother, let me tell you, nothing 
    brought out the best in me more than all the crap I've had to endure. I can 
    look back and see how much stronger, wiser, and confident I am for having 
    experienced it. Don't cheapen the events that unfold to determine who you 
    are by giving up. You may not acomplish all your goals, but the main goal 
    should be the struggle itself. In the end, that's what's going to matter. 
    </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">And to everyone else reading who 
    wants me to lay off Darwin and attack OSI, the real enemy, I ask that you 
    consider this: Nothing sold more copies of TSR's Dungeons and Dragons than 
    a copy of the players manual and several blood stained character sheets being 
    found next to a group of teens who offed themselves. The more of a stank we 
    make out of the ongoing Soap Opera that is Ultima Online, the more money these 
    people are going to rake it. Things seem in disarray, but bet your paycheck 
    that somewhere there is a smoke filled boardroom where people in suits are 
    laugh. I understand that we all enjoy rants, and controversy...and that's 
    normal and human. Just realize when you complain publicly that you're perpetuating 
    it. Like I am right now. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">-- Samwise</font></p>
  <p> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Now about this Darwin guy - I 
    hate to say it, but it's time for you to bring out the hot pinchers and bamboo 
    needles. He claims he was doing what he thought was right. So let's examine 
    the ethics of his statements, and see how close he came: </font></p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><i>Don't you go taking advantage 
      of my master because his servant's no better than a fool. You've spoken 
      very handsome all along, put me off my guard, talking of Elves and all. 
      But handsome is as handsome does we say. Now's a chance to show your quality.<br>
      - JRR Tolkein, LOTR </i></font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Ethics 101: Friends, Love, and 
    Marriage <br>
    "here is no denying what I did. A really good friend of mine was and is going 
    through a very very rough spot in life...he is having marriage troubles... 
    and needed to get out of debt fast in order to try and save his marriage." 
    </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">First of all, I hate to say it 
    but if your relationship is breaking up it ain't purely because there's no 
    money. Didn't you ever see Bill Murray in THE RAZOR'S EDGE? He was working 
    as a coal miner and hardly had enough money to buy those 16 books a day he 
    read in seedy bars but he and his woman were HAPPY. The Ingalls had some rough 
    times, like the time the bank was going to foreclose on their farm, but it 
    only brought them closer together! So don't give me crap about how you're 
    saving your friend's marriage by giving him the proceeds of your larceny, 
    and don't delude yourself about that either. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">However, I don't see an ethical 
    problem with giving a friend money, I just think it's stupid to think it's 
    going to save his friend's marriage. I'm not willing to let him use the marriage 
    as an excuse, but I am willing to ignore it. So let's just skip the rest of 
    that and say that Kevin had a friend who needed to get out of debt fast. So 
    he abused his power to make that happen, and he said he would do it again 
    because he thought it was the right thing to do. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">It's not. I refuse to believe Kevin 
    had no other means to help his friend than to lie and cheat. This was just 
    the easiest way for him to do so - easy if you don't have any moral considerations 
    about stealing from your employer. I think maybe if your friend has no place 
    to live, or needs a kidney or an abortion, or doesn't have enough food to 
    eat, you could be excused for helping them. But not to just get them out of 
    debt or save a foundering marriage. And even then, if you are going to do 
    something wrong to help someone you don't get to cry foul when you are caught 
    at it and must pay the price for what you have done. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">ETHICAL FALLACY #1: Thinking the 
    ends justify the means. Maybe they do, maybe they don't - it's often a gray 
    area. What is NOT gray is that the ends are never an EXCUSE for the means. 
    You are responsible for your actions, regardless of what high-minded purpose 
    they were for. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">OTHER COMMENTS: <br>
    "But, if I had to do it all over I would do it again... a friend needed me 
    and I stick by my friends" - I stick by my friends, too. But sticking by your 
    friends is being there for them, offering them an ear to bend or a burger 
    to eat or a place to crash. Maybe offering your advice, too, although that 
    tends to fuck things up almost as bad as offering them money. Sticking by 
    your friends is NOT stealing from your employer to help them pay their VISA 
    bill. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Ethics 102: Rationalization <br>
    "There are so many that are never reported. I mean, I am sure all the GM's 
    have done, none were caught for it while I was there" <br>
    "But, the lure is always there... I mean, I am sure others GM's have done 
    it or are doing it." <br>
    Lots of guys speed - so sure, just tell that to the traffic court judge - 
    just say "Your honor, I see thousands of people speeding every day and NONE 
    OF THEM got caught! This isn't fair!", then rip up the ticket. You don't get 
    to weasel out of doing a Bad Thing by pointing out others are doing the same 
    Bad Thing without being held accountable. It doesn't work that way. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Doing something wrong is doing 
    something wrong. Kevin might be claiming Origin's response was out of line 
    with his actions - I think he should consider himself lucky that he's not 
    being sued or charged over this. Lum, you seem to think it's a pretty arcane 
    and unenforcable "crime" - I think you know as well as I that Origin got taken 
    to the tune of 8 grand and if they were serious they would have no trouble 
    at least recovering that in a civil case. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"He is the one that actually turned 
    me in. What does he get for all this? A placed Castle and much more." <br>
    "You can see how strict they are about racial harassment there" <br>
    "ahh that was bullshit." <br>
    "and now this bullshit letter they post on the site" <br>
    "Total bullshit if you ask me." <br>
    Again, lots of guys are idiots, or do things the wrong way, or are full of 
    bullshit. I think, though, if I had just betrayed the trust of thousands of 
    people while lying to my company and stealing from them I'd be concentrating 
    more on apologizing and less on going on the warpath. I see lots of idiots 
    every day, the world seems to be full of them. I'd love to punch a few of 
    them out, or barring that maybe undermine the integrity of their company by 
    profiting from abusing my position. It wouldn't make doing either of those 
    things right. When you've done something wrong, it doesn't make it right that 
    you did it to someone who was a lummox or a jerk. And it only makes you look 
    like an asshole to consistently and constantly bad mouth the people you either 
    betrayed or who caught you in your betrayal. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">ETHICAL FALLACY #2: Rationalizing 
    one's actions by pointing to those of others. As the saying goes, if a million 
    people say an untrue thing it is still an untrue thing. You cannot rationalize 
    doing something that is immoral by doing something immoral, and you cannot 
    lessen your own faults by pointing out faults in others. Ethical behavior 
    is not a zero-sum game. </font></p>

    "I am not upset or mad with OSI about my my termination as it was my fault,

    from Lord British as you were escorted out by security? This is a nice boilerplate

    it. Nice try, no cookie for you. </font></p>

    "Now that being said, there is the thought that I got something out of this.. 
    well I did, I helped a friend and did not make a dime." <br>
    "All I can say was that I was helping a friend that needed help." <br>
    Let's look into this. Kevin's reported e-bay id, imagine691, sold UO merchandise 
    exclusively for a total of $8,163.89 over the month from 5/20 to 6/20 (who 
    knows how much longer he would have gone on if he had not been caught?). Over 
    the same time period he was the winning bidder on e-bay in $4730.75 worth 
    of merchandise, mainly computers and electronics. In April he also spent $1500.00+ 
    on items. And that's just the stuff he WON, he BID on about a dozen other 
    auctions during the period he was, as a last desperate resort, selling UO 
    gear to save his friend's marriage. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The question is: did Kevin do this 
    because what his friend's marriage REALLY needed was not money but a couple 
    of PIII systems with big-ass monitors? Maybe his buddy's wife was going to 
    leave him if he didn't get her those Mickey Mouse salt shakers? Is Kevin a 
    hero, or just a greedy little shit looking for an easy buck to get a faster 
    computer? </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I've looked into this and it seems 
    imagine69, or tolky@austin.rr.com (alternatively known as tolky@onr.com, tolky@texas.net, 
    SirTolkein@aol.com, and ICQ# 5368579) was the one doing all this buying and 
    selling, and that this is the same as both Kevin Roseler and GM Darwin. Dejanews 
    searches on these addresses show a stance on cheating and getting caught that 
    is, well, kinda ironic. But that, as Kevin's literary namesake might say, 
    is another story. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Anyway, maybe Kevin was helping 
    a friend, but it seems pretty likely he either was helping himself at the 
    same time or he kept his "new computers" budget separate from his "friends 
    in need" budget. I'm not going to make any firm accusations, but it's my guess 
    Kevin should have learned by now you can get caught lying and cheating. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">ETHICAL FALLACY #3: If you got 
    somewhere tough by lying, just get out with more lying! Lying is, y'know, 
    BAD, nnokay? </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">OTHER COMMENTS: <br>
    "I know a lot of you hate me." - I'd never heard of Kevin before this and 
    I haven't played UO in over a year. But DAMN if he's not the one guy who's 
    manage to make me think LESS of Origin and it's customer support so far this 
    month... </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">SUMMARY: <br>
    Bad monkey! </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">" Would I do it again? I am not 
    sure, but my guess is yes." - thank god you're not going to get the chance, 
    Kevin. Let's just hope you get a better handle on right and wrong before someone 
    puts you in a position of responsibility again. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Kevin has said what he did was 
    wrong and that he doesn't have issues with being fired. At the same time he 
    says he would do it again and claims he was doing it to help a friend. A few 
    people have said he was a cool guy and he turned bankers' hair neon-colored 
    (possibly while he was one of the one or two GMs responsible for a shard?). 
    Other people point the finger at the system or the folks that turned him in. 
    </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I've heard people saying Kevin 
    is a "real man" and a loyal friend for what he did. No, I'm sorry, he is just 
    a stupid kid who tried to make an easy buck. Kevin was placed in a position 
    where he had the trust of thousands of people, and where he had real power 
    to affect their level of service and their experience in an endeavor they 
    were each paying money each month for and investing untold hours in. He abused 
    that power and betrayed their trust for profit. It doesn't matter what he 
    did with the money, and even so it seems pretty obvious his stories about 
    a friend in need are almost total hooey. And he says he would do it again. 
    </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Kevin blew it, folks. He should 
    not be admired. He should be ashamed of what he did, and contrite. And he 
    should learn from his mistake, because next time it might be his family or 
    friends he fucks over, and he might do some real damage. And all of you gullible 
    cheerleaders out there better be careful before you turn him into a martyr 
    and make a greedy, lying, kid who got caught doing a bad thing and then tried 
    to weasel out of it this month's poster child for ethical behavior. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">FINAL COMMENT: Kevin, on Dejanews: 
    "You know... iT's the fuckers like your sorry cheating ass that ruin this 
    game... ;/ Get a fukcing clue will you? I mean why do you have to cheat? Is 
    it to ruin others gaming time? I would just really like to know... " </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I'd like to know, too, Kevin. Did 
    you figure it out yet? </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">-- Rick</font></p>
  <p> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Darwin was a thief, plain and 
    simple. He had a job getting paid $10 an hour to work on a game that we pay 
    to play. Everybody feels they should be paid more for the job they do but 
    using company assets to make extra money on the side is wrong and illegal. 
    I would love to have a job doing that kind of work for $10 an hour. By using 
    inside info and power to make more money from people by cheating others and 
    stealing from the system is unjustifiable. Trying to turn it into an American 
    have-have not issue is like saying since you are driving a better car than 
    I am, I should have the right to take you car and use it for my own needs. 
    In fact I have a friend that needs to go to the doctor's office, so since 
    that is a noble thing I am doing to help a friend, it should be ok with you, 
    right? </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">His buddy needed money? His buddy 
    can try working and going to a credit counselor. If his marriage is in trouble, 
    a marriage counselor might be more helpful than taking money that Darwin stole 
    in the first place. There are free counselors out there that do a great job 
    helping people out of the hole. It just involves taking some responsibility 
    for poor financial decisions. Darwin should have directed his friend to a 
    resource that would have actually helped his friend learn not to repeat his 
    mistakes instead of scamming others including his employer. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I cannot see feeling sorry for 
    Darwin because he has a wife and child. I am a wife and have children. My 
    husband and I try to teach our kids that stealing is wrong. Period. No excuses. 
    </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Darwin's use of his friend as an 
    excuse for committing a crime, blaming OSI and trying to pass the buck on 
    to Nighthawk is cowardly and immature. He is a GM that abused his power and 
    was stupid enough to have a scam he knew he could get fired for running openly 
    on the Web. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Somone commented that because he 
    is young, it is understandable. His age is not a factor, his lack of character 
    and integrity are the issue. If he is truly only 22 years old, he should have 
    considered himself lucky that he had a job making that much. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">-- AD</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Most of the talk has been about 
    player relations and GM trust, etc. But many people don't realize the broader 
    issues of the Darwin story. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Origin would've released pretty 
    much the entire story by now, but they want to cover their asses. And they 
    got a good reason, too. Origin isn't stupid. They know perfectly well the 
    players know the entire story by now, that isn't the reason they haven't released 
    anything. The reason is simply because they don't want this to turn into a 
    nation-wide story. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Think about it. The fact that Ultima 
    Online accounts are selling so much on eBay isn't just limited to Origin's 
    player base. I saw a few articles in Newsweek, The Washington Post, and USA 
    Today about it. Origin I'm sure loved this, because it showed people how good 
    Ultima Online was. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">But now you have this Darwin thing. 
    If three major National news organizations published articles on accounts 
    being sold, nothing would stop them from posting this stuff on Darwin. Probably 
    wouldn't make the headlines, but it would be there. And these are huge newspapers, 
    think of all the gaming magazines, internet sites, etc. This WOULD make their 
    headlines, and would give Origin a terrible image. But Washington Times and 
    Happy Puppy most likely don't visit Dr. TwisTer and your page regulary. The 
    gaming sites, however, probably do keep tabs on OWO.com. And the large commercial 
    entertainment sites probably keep tabs on the other gaming sites. And Newsweek 
    and USA Today probably keep tabs on the commercial gaming sites. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">What am I getting at? Pretty much 
    a blown-up scandle for Origin if word gets out about this past the UO player 
    base. This is definately not good for Origin. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">This probably also has a connection 
    with why all they did was fire Darwin and haven't really made any public actions 
    about it besides that. While they could probably bring it to court, they won't. 
    Most of all because the case would probably get dismissed, but also because 
    again they want to keep this as low-key as possible. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Here's something else to think 
    about...Dr. TwisTer is part of a larger gaming site called GameHut, and I'm 
    sure they know about Darwin... </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Okay, damn, that took a long time 
    to write. Anyways, Dr. TwisTer is slowly getting his server back up after 
    the move to wherever the hell GameHut moved his servers, so thats all I have 
    to say. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">-- Ishamel of Catskills </font></p>
  <p> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I got bored, so after reading 
    all the complete bullshit surrounding this story, I decided to just do some 
    old fashion number crunching. Now I don't care what Darwin and his wife say, 
    because if he truly felt what he did was wrong then there would be none of 
    this "I did it for a friend." That's like saying "Yes, I stole this man's 
    wallet, but let me tell you why." To say your are wrong and then give excuses 
    is nothing but a tactic to bring people to your side. What is really being 
    said by Darwin is "Yes, I'm wrong from your point of view, but look at it 
    from my point of view...." To add to the fact, the two defense stories sound 
    so cooked. "I did it for a friend in trouble," and "All the purchases on eBay 
    were for his mom." Next will be "Ok, honestly, I didn't want it public, but 
    I did it for my son because he needs an operation." I don't mean to sound 
    like an insensitive bastard, but there is to much sympathy invoking going 
    on with these excuses to believe it. To borrow a phrase from a friend of mine 
    when talking about the Kosovo conflict, something just doesn't add up. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">But numbers always add up, and 
    that brings me to the point of this. I don't care who you are, in personal 
    finance there are two cashflows: incoming cash and outgoing cash. Under that 
    idea, I added up all Darwin's eBay sales of UO goods and all his purchases 
    made on eBay after the first UO item sold: <br>
    <br>
    Total eBay Sales from UO Items: $8163.89 <br>
    Total eBay Purchases after 6/1: $4750.75 <br>
    ------ <br>
    Funds Remaining: $3413.14 </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Whichever way you cut it, whoever 
    the computer parts, salt shakers, and whatever bought on eBay were for, and 
    whether or not he helped his friend, it doesn't matter. Over a 3 week period 
    he took in roughly $8200 and spent $4800. Technically he may have not have 
    gotten a dime from his eBay sales. He could have already had $4800 to begin 
    with, and directed the money from eBay to help his friend. But if he HADN'T 
    sold stuff on eBay, and being the good guy he makes himself out to be, the 
    $4800 he hypothetically had otherwise would have gone to help his friend, 
    thus he wouldn't have been able to buy all the computer stuff "for his dear 
    old mom." </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I would be willing to bet he had 
    auctions ongoing through eBay when OSI busted him. This probably would have 
    pushed his little intake up to $10K. God knows if eBay is the only auction 
    site he sold stuff on. You're so right about this Lum, I totally understand 
    how this will destroy UO. Who's going to trust a GM now? So many jokes will 
    be made of this like "What took the GM so long? Oh, his auction on eBay was 
    closing." GM's thought they had trouble getting respect before? They will 
    NEVER be respected now. The ones who are trusted will now have shadows of 
    doubt cast over them. And it's all the work of one man. To paraphrase Dennis 
    Miller: You're a punk, Darwin. A bad guy. Go to hell. </font></p>

  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Hey there Lum, hows life in Ultima 
    90210? I havent seen this much shit stirred up since 'who shot JR' was the 
    question of that day as pertains to THINGS THAT DONT MATTER like online video 
    games and television shows. Some people need to stop obsessing over this (except 
    you because you make me laugh, in a ha ha kind of way) GM Darwin did this, 
    OSI is covering up that, Dr Twisted is really the Chinese spy who is stealing 
    secrets from the United States and plans to use the secrets to blow OSI out 
    of the water if Vador's murder count isnt reversed, ya know, shit like that. 
    I know your a middle aged guy who probably gets a kick out of all these teenagers 
    who are so hell-bent over a video game. While our first ammendment is slowly 
    being taken away 'the leaders of the future' are concerned about a guy who 
    held a meaningless job (in the grand sceme of things) making gold as a side 
    business to help his friend (or so he says). First of all, WHO CARES? If you 
    have been playing this game for more than 16 minutes you know shit like this 
    goes on (unless your a roleplayer) and let it go with the attitude 'as long 
    as its not happening to me it doesnt matter' unless your dr twister who makes 
    his personal mission to try and sink OSI and everyone attached. Ill be blunt, 
    GMs have done things for me, GMs have done things for A LOT of people I know. 
    GMs decorated a large brick that belonged to a guildmate of mine because it 
    was a GM's mothers. GMs do things they 'arent supposed' to do on a daily basis. 
    Granted Darwin's scheme went a little further than giving a guy black hair 
    or placing a fountian on the porch of a large smithy, like $7,000 further, 
    but thats not really the point, the point is stuff like this goes on every 
    day and has gone on since the begining of Ultima Online and MU's. For fucks 
    sake it even went on in those paper and pencil RPGs when you would finish 
    up for the day take you character sheet home, with nobody watching you add 
    a couple points of wisdom here and a point or two of strenght there and everything 
    was kosher. Anyway Real World is on MTV now and I have to go watch it because 
    its funny and amusing, like you. I dont know if this made sence at all, my 
    point really when I read about congress passing ammendments to the constitution 
    to slowly limit my rights (more so than already) it kind of makes me think. 
    What if everyone that plays UO and takes the time to write you or twister 
    or UO vault a full page about how shitty UO is and how much it could be imporved 
    took the time to write about how shitty America is and how much it could be 
    improved then mabey things would get better. hmm I lost myself on that last 
    one, and your making me miss my fantasy world on MTV. Thanks you for reading, 
    if you got this far. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Oh yeah I forgot to add if I were 
    GM Gunganine Ebay would be covered with gold and houses I made. Take a poll 
    on this question please... As a teenager did you ever steal ANYTHING from 
    an employer? be it a cheese burger if you worked as a whopper flopper or a 
    coke if you worked at a grocery store. Im not condoning stealing, or saying 
    I rip off my employer as an adult but as a teenager employed at a grocery 
    store I did, on occasion 'borrow' a coke and forget to pay for it here and 
    there. Even taking an hour lunch insted of a 45 minute lunch is stealing. 
    Let he who is without sin cast the first stone. I would wager dollars to donuts 
    that 75%+ of the people (including OSI employees) who read your have done 
    or are currently doing the same thing. Or mabey not and Ill burn in hell alone 
    for eternity, well me along with the Back Street Boys. </font></p>

  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Let me start by saying I have 
    never played UO. I have worked as a GM in another online game, and currently 
    enjoy playing Everquest. Reading through these points and counterpoints regarding 
    what Kevin/Darwin did, I had a 3rd person observation I wanted to make. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">People are trying to use the extreme 
    examples of embezzlement or the taking of an employer's paper clips to put 
    what was done in perspective. Both are poor examples at best. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">A company whose product is a massively 
    multiplayer online game is very different than most other companies. Their 
    product has to continually prove itself to its customers. The moment a customer 
    quits having fun, regardless of the reason, they will quit purchasing the 
    product and move on to something else. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Most people that play games like 
    UO want there to be a level playing field, an assurance that for their monthly 
    fee, they have the opportunity to stand on equal footing with everyone else 
    in the game. What Kevin did severely disrupted this game integrity. Now there 
    is a perception that the staff is corrupt, that there is no level playing 
    field. This disgusts many people, and will lead to their general displeasure 
    with the product. Displeasure with a product in turn leads to people canceling 
    their accounts, thus lessening OSI's profits. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Kevin did not reach into the till 
    and snatch $7000 while no one at OSI was looking. The money he recieved would 
    never have been seen by OSI in any case. But, he didn't just steal a paper 
    clip, either. While not being the only problem OSI has with UO (from what 
    I've read), this event tarnishes OSI's and UO's reputation as a company and 
    product respectively, which stealing a paper clip does not. It also adds to 
    customer's displeasure with the game, pushing them closer to the point where 
    they give up and take their business elsewhere. </font></p>
