Richard Garriott isn't the only person leaving Origin.  We're told twenty other members of his court have been asked to leave as well, twenty other faceless developers, twenty whose names we don't know and whose situation we're almost ignoring, unless we're circling vultures from Verant, Wolfpack, and Reakktor.  Make that nineteen unknowns.  We know we're losing Firedog.<br><br>Firedog didn't frequent the <a href="http://boards.xrgaming.net/cgi/cob/devboard.cgi?view">Dev Board</a>, and was thus one of the lesser-known UO developers.  But while he was staying away from the chaos of CoB, he was helping smaller groups -- <a href="http://www.unitedtamers.com/">tamers</a> and <a href="http://uo.stratics.com/alchemy/">alchemists</a> in particular.  I can't itemize what he did for tamers, since I was never involved in that group, but he was the alchemy community's greatest benefactor.  He posted regularly on our message board, looking for input on ideas and for information on problems.  He visited our IRC channel during many UOHoCs, not only for the same reasons as he read the board, but to simply get to know us.  He set up a whole special testing area for us on Test Center, and he visited us there as well.  And to this day, he's the only developer I've ever seen attend in-game events as himself (the <a href="http://uo.stratics.com/alchemy/community/events/party-info.html">Lake Superior Alchemy Festival</a>, specifically).<br><br>This implies a lot of dedication to me.  No other developer has worked so hard for any single part of the Ultima Online community.  And even though we're not all tamers and alchemists, we're still collectively losing out.  We're losing because we no longer have a developer working so hard on any single facet of the game.  We don't have one working so closely with any facet of the community.  We're missing Firedog's example of community interaction for the whole team.<br><br>I hope somebody took notes.  I want to see other developers acting as representatives for small groups; I want to know that such groups are getting attention at all.  I don't want a dev team who gets its daily Dev Board digest from Calandryll and calls it "community involvement."  I want one that gets its own hands dirty and actually communicates and builds relationships with the players themselves.  We've lost the part of it that did.<br><br>Goodbye Firedog, and good luck with your future.  I hope you find opportunities in the MMORPG industry; a single-player game wouldn't allow the virtues of yours I've seen to come out.  Remember that gaming is infinitely more rewarding than making word processors.<br><br>Let's move forward.<br></font></td></tr></table><br clear=left><br><a name="newsitem954538655,71361,"></a>

Against everyone's better advice, I keep reading <a href="http://azile.tradespot.net/">Azile's</a> site. Must be that masochistic streak of mine, but every so often I just need to go somewhere where literally every single update is somehow skewed to portray me as long-winded, a sell-out, an idiot, a roleplayer (the PK's worst epithet) or, usually, all four. Finally today, however, we got past the pissy one-line begrudging links and got down to brass tacks. So let's go into detail, shall we?<br><br><font color="#77FF77">Just how much OSI ass do you kiss man? Cause if some disgruntled employee sent you the email, then so fucking what. That is OSI's problem with the employee who leaked it, not you for posting it. Then again, if they just send off private internal email discussing employee firings and their 12 month plan to you for your own consumption, then we sorta gotta question how you got in so good with OSI. I mean, who are you fighting for anyways? The players or OSI?</font><br><br>I could mention sarcastically that there's <a href="http://uo2.drtwister.com/">no precedent at all</a> for Origin fucking with web sites who publish internal/confidential memos, but I won't. We'll get back to this later.<br><br><font color="#77FF77">Carelessness and thoughtlessness? Hey Lum, it is "publish or perish" for larger volume sites like yours. We all know this. It was hot news, you got it, it was exclusive and you posted it. When I want to hear or read about the nitty gritty latest breaking scandal or shit hitting the fan, I don't read Stratics Lum...I read you. Since when did you start pulling punches and wanting to fake it? When did you decide to sell out?</font><br><br>You know, if this really was a "publish or perish" site, I wouldn't have pulled half the memo later. If this really was a "publish or perish" site, dedicated to the "shit hitting the fan", we wouldn't post 40,000 word essays that would hopefully make someone think instead of insanely titter. <br><br>So what the hell is this web site? Well, Azile thinks:<br><br><font color="#77FF77">WE don't give a rats ass that OSI is pissed that you printed something they would rather have kept in the closet. And now your "future actions can convince them otherwise"? LOL. Give us a break. Are we now to listen to the things you say knowing that everything you post, your considering how that "future action" is being used to "convince them otherwise"? <br><br>How about you start trying to convince US that your otherwise not a fricken ass kissing sell-out that is now trying to make amends to your eternal masters at OSI so they once again start thinking your the bomb. This is fucking OSI we are talking about here. Give me a fucking break already!</font><br><br>Here's a clue and a nickel.<br><br>The clue: this web site isn't about kissing Origin's ass. I'm sure plenty of other websites in this great community of ours do a fine enough job of that without my help. And frankly, what little "official Origin input" we get into the site I suspect dried up as of yesterday. Which bothered me for about a minute.<br><br>It's not about kissing ass, it's about kicking it. When this site is at its best, it's in (a) pointing out problems, and (b) fixing them. Stat loss in UO is one example. eBay sales in all games is another. Obviously neither one is fixed. However, it's far more likely that, through our efforts and those of other sites in the <i>community</i>, what results from this brainstorming is, ultimately, of use to whoever chooses to use it - Origin, Turbine, Wolfpack, Verant, whoever.<br><br>Now, we can either choose to help improve these games, or we can choose to tear them down. The latter is always the easiest choice. It's the choice that gets you hits and makes you popular with your friends. It makes you look cool. <br><br>But that's not what we're about. Not any more. After I took the world's shortest month-long vacation last year I decided that. <br><br>So we'll still keep serving up huge dishes of commentary, opinion, and the occasional actual news story on a somewhat constant basis, no matter what the corporate opinion of the month is regarding us. And to be honest, and I think I speak for all of us at LumCorp, we'll keep doing it regardless of how many folks visit, or how many sites link to us, or how many designers deign to drop by, simply because we are wordy bastards who like to write on the web.<br><br>So "who are we fighting for"? Ourselves, really. And if you like what you read and think perhaps we're fighting for you too, feel free to stick around. I promise it will continue to be a hell of a ride.<br><br>By the way, Azile, the nickel is so you can call someone to get fucked.<br><br><b><a href="http://lum.xrgaming.net/ubb/Forum2/HTML/000203.html">Tune in tomorrow, when we see who we can piss off next!</a></b><br></font></td></tr></table><br clear=left><br><a name="newsitem954532971,90220,"></a>

Posted by The Hanged Man on our forum. I couldn't say it any better.<br><br><font color="#77FF77">Richard Garriot is a visionary. His ideas vary with some good and some great. However a while back he came up for the idea for adventuring in the world of Ultima which was Alkabeth. Over time the land evolved and became a living breathing place. It was unique because it wasn't stolen from literture or legend. The lands had their own culture and lore. The civilizations of the Gargoyles and Serpent Isle were not just something shoved in a player's guide and ignored like Norrath. They were fleshed out interesting cultures with their own logic and ways. Ultima had its own lore, cultures, and even a system once for determining what sort of person you are. However with the introduction of Ultima Online things changed. For years the rich history and background were supressed and exiled to the pages of the Ultima Dragons while UO's culture was as deep and thought provoking as a game of Gauntlet. Now after years of neglect suddenly the ultima lore is supposed to appear in the game and the players are supposed to care. A land devoted to the pursuit of becoming a better person through the virtues is now a land of trash talking and life without value.<br><br>Richard Garriot should be remembered in Ultima for his successes. He helped make some of the most interesting games with a good background. Now we move into the Ultima Future. This is a future where the players have been ignorant of the history of the land for years. This is a future where the people responsible for the game don't know of a King Wolfgang or a Sun Gem. This is an Ultima where Lord British doesn't make famous the best of the best . Its a land where the scum of the scum are acknowledged with ratings on city message boards and the true heros of the land tread in anonymity. Its a land where people are killed for compassion and looted for valor. This isn't the land of Alkabeth or Sosaria but a dark image in a cracked mirror. Its better to remember Lord British for all his triumphs and not his defeats. He was a visionary and yet also a player as well. He was one of us in the land of Sosaria.<br><br>A while back I thought the events being run really sucked. Rather than whine about it I decided to do something. I volunteered to help author events and I work on submitting quality events that I wished were run before. On the way from being a disgruntled player to being a novice event writer I had the fortune of discovering the lore of the original Ultima Games. I was fascinated and read through all the lore I could find. The lands had a breath and a life to them like books I had read on Narnia, Oz, Sanctuary, and other places of fantasy. Yet this treasure of lore that infused the original Ultima series was hidden away like a gold nugget under a boulder. I think that the Ultima Series are the true heirloom of Richard Garriot and the others who worked on the Ultima series. OSI has created a corporate fast food Ultima. As I travel the lands I don't see a land of virtues instead I spend my time reporting people acting out sex with animals, future klansmen, and ebay hungry exploiters. The stranger never came to this land beause its not worth him saving it. I thing its good that Richard Garriot can now go and create new lore rich legacies for people to enjoy before the players sit amongst Pepsi Ads at their local tavern or fill out credit card information to own a tower. Reading the old lore of the land is a reminder and a tribute to what Richard Garriot accomplished. Not even a profit focused CEO can take that away from him. </font><br><br><b><a href="http://lum.xrgaming.net/ubb/Forum1/HTML/002936.html">The original thread</a></b><br></font></td></tr></table><br clear=left><br><a name="newsitem954524665,96437,"></a>

From Calandryll (<i>He</i> still loves us anyway, no doubt because we're one of the few sites never to accuse him of wearing a dress) comes word of this posting to In Concept:<br><br><font color="#77FF77"><b>Murderers and Statloss</b><br><br>Currently we are considering two designs regarding murderers and statloss and have placed them here to elicit your feedback.  If after reading this document you'd like to send feedback to us, please click the link below.<br><br><b>Statloss and Murder Counts</b><br><br>Once a murderer takes statloss, his short-term murder counts are reduced to four.  This will allow the player to regain the lost stats and skills through normal game-play without having to take another statloss if they die.  Note that "perma-red" status will still remain active and if a character "ping-pongs" between four and five murder counts a total of five times, they will be permanently "red".  Under this system the long-term murder counts may need to remain in effect to avoid the issue of "blue PKs".<br><br><b>One-Time Reprieve</b><br><br>If a murderer joins any faction, he will receive a one-time reprieve.  His short-term murder counts will be immediately reduced to four.  This will be a one-time reprieve, hence any murder counts given to the character after joining a faction cannot be removed through this method.  <br><br>If you'd like to send us your feedback on either of these designs, please <a href="mailto:inconcept@uo.com?subject=Murderers">mail us</a>.</font><br><br>The one-time reprieve we've seen alluded to before by Sunsword.

Myschyf is one of my favorite authors - really. I've been reading her rants and reviews for a few years now, on various online venues. Certainly the coverage of the departure of Richard Garriott from OSI needs no amendment or footnote, but as newspapers often employ several pundits to cover angles of the same story, I am compelled to offer this as a tribute to a man who, if there was a heaven for dreamers, would certainly be one of it's saints...<br><br><font color="FF77FF">"I really wanted to come up with something much more meaningful...something that would create a lasting image."<br>-Richard Garriot <a href="http://www.gamespot.com/features/ultima/"><i>(Gamespot.com)</i></a></font><br><br>The news creeped out from various outlets, and the actual facts surrounding the event are far ranging. But one thing is certain: Sosaria has lost a king. We may never learn what <i>project X</i> really was, or what Richard Garriott's vision for this new venture would be. Certainly it would be something that would make our jaws drop. For nearly thirty years, it was what he did best. And while the last few installments of Sosaria may have stumbled upon technology, the story told to us by it's creator is one that I will look back upon with fond recollections. Time will erase the broken interfaces and unfinished code. Years will wash away the blemishes. It is our nature as a species to be generous and kind with our memories, and there will come a day when each of us recalls fondly old friends like Iolo, Dupre, and Lord British - and we will smile.<br><br>The driving force behind all artists, be they sculptors, musicians, or writers, is that inner desire to share ourselves with others and to have some minor effect upon them with their craft; to cause them to think, to feel, and to walk away changed by it. Certainly in that regard, none could question the success of Richard Garriott, nor can anyone ignore the silence he now leaves behind in the hallways of Origin Systems, Inc.<br>We shall remember you fondly, dear Theoden.<br><font color="FF77FF"><i><br>Out of doubt, out of dark, to the day's rising <br>he rode singing in the sun, sword unsheathing. <br>Hope he rekindled, and in hope ended; <br>over death, over dread, over doom lifted <br>out of loss, out of life, unto long glory.</i> <br>-J.R.R.

I have something to confess here: I am a terminal ubergeek. (No, <i>really</i>?) And it's all Richard Garriott's fault.<br><br>When I was growing up in the late 70's, the science lab in our high school had a TRS-80 Model 1. I managed to singlehandedly piss off everyone else in the school who wanted to play Asteroids or Space Invaders on it by convincing the teacher that I wanted to, you know, learn how to program. So after school, every day, I sat at it, for months, with a dogeared BASIC reference in one hand and some RPG rules in the other, trying to craft the Ultimate Game.<br><br>So did Richard Garriott. Only he sold his. (Probably as well I didn't, since most of the time it didn't work.)<br><br>In 1984 I graduated from high school. My graduation present was a shiny new Atari 800, complete with huge whirring floppy drive. One of the first programs I got for it was Ultima 2. I think I played it and its sequel for around 3 years or so. Sure, there was no plot whatsoever to speak of and the combat mechanics were unbelievably dorky (you basically got on a boat and parked outside Europe and blew away anything that came toward you). Ultima 2 and 3 is probably a large part of why I dropped out of college. (I mean, come on, COBOL punch cards or sitting in a forest waiting for Dawn to show up. You make the call.)<br><br>Most people thought Ultima 4 was the bomb, but truth be told I didn't care for it much. (The fact that I was still only halfway through Ultima 3 when it came out probably helped.) No.. for me, it was Ultima 5. That I can still say is probably one of the most unbelievable games I had ever played. Y'see, it was the first one that actually had plot... had things happen for a reason. The kid in Yew who pleads with you as you leave not to leave him. The death of Iolo (Hey! I can't res him! He's... DEAD!). And yes, I blew up the world using Mondain's skull. Probably not the best of omens. <br><br>Things changed. Origin's corporate philosophy became "don't just push the envelope of PC hardware, rip the envelope into small tiny bits" around Ultima 6. My idea of upgrading PCs meant trading in the Atari 800 for a Commodore 64, so I was left behind for the next few years. In the interim I got into the local BBS scene, wrote a lot, pissed people off, the usual.<br><br>Around the time I finally updated to a PC (in 1995 or so -- don't laugh) Ultima Online was being talked up pretty hot and heavy on Usenet (being an ubergeek, I called a BBS in California long distance to read Usenet, and got fired from my job for it). Seemed pretty cool. In fact, since BBSs were busily being shredded by the juggernaut called "Internet" at the time, it actually seemed like, well, a virtual community. <br><br>When UO finally came out, I actually bought it first for my new wife, because I felt guilty about always buying myself games. "Look, hon, here's a game where you can bake bread instead of making things go boom." A week later I got my own copy. A year later I started a website. (No, not this one. Believe it or not this is actually the second ORPG website I've done.) <br><br>I'm sure we'll see a new gaming company pop up somewhere shortly with someone who may or may not be called Lord British still at the helm. So, yeah, Ultima 9 was a big pile of goo, and Garriott had almost nothing to do with UO aside from the rare token appearance, and his latest interviews had the air of someone who really needed to get out and breathe actual oxygen, but you know, I think he's earned being weird. I mean, looking back at my life, the degree to which it has been shaped by his work is, well, frightening. And I'm not even that much of an Ultima fan.<br><br>Good luck, and good fortune to everyone else busily sending out resumes today.<br></font></td></tr></table><br clear=left><br><a name="newsitem954486841,27430,"></a>

Man today it must have really really sucked to be an OSI employee.  Black Thursday.  A day remaining employees and the recently unemployed will remember for a long time.  None of us know the entire story and frankly, I don't want to know.  I'm just not that morbid.  What I do know, with absolute certainty, is that it sucks to be laid off.  Regardless of how employable you are or how good the job market is, unemployment bites a big one.  Unless you have scads and scads of cash in the bank but even still... it is never good to be told you aren't wanted.<br><br>I know a lot of us thought Richard Garriott had more than a few screws loose upstairs.  At best a man lost in his dreams without a hook to bring him back down to earth.  At worst someone completely out of touch with reality.  Nonetheless he built some kick-ass games in his times.  Games that were so compelling and so well-liked that when UO and U9 proved to be a dissapointment people felt betrayed.  Theres a lot to be said for that and a couple of years of being a fruit loop or giving fruit-loopy type interviews doesn't negate all that he accomplished.  He accomplished a lot.  One hundred sixty thousand people accounts are active in UO today.  Two hundred thousand people signed up to play the beta almost three years ago.  All this born of some amazing games that captured players hearts and minds and made them want more.  Would that all companies could make a series of games that were this successful.  So kudos and a fond farewell to Richard Garriott as he drives off into whatever venture that whacky imagination of his takes him into.  <br><br>To the rest of you leaving OSI I wish you the best and speedy re-employment if such is your desire.  If you worked on UO then my thanks for your contribution to a game we all love. Some of us even love it enough to hate it and to continue to comment on it years after we've left.  If that isn't a sign of respect I don't know what is.  <br><br>If you are one of those people posting that its about time, that those who are leaving deserve it or saying any assortment of stupid shit about this... just chill out ok?  This probably wasn't much fun for anyone involved and its a safe bet that a whole bunch of people in Austin are going home with heavy hearts tonight.  This event is not a good thing.

Sadly, as part of the events you witnessed today, we will be losing a member of the team. I'm going to let him announce his departure on his own. He's been a great contributor and it's always difficult to see a team member leave. On the bright side, we will also be gaining new members. Once again, the UO Live team will be larger than it ever has been. This talented team is still extremely excited about UO and upcoming changes. The UO Community is more active and vibrant than it ever has been.<br><br>I believe there are damned good reasons for that. First, the game rocks. Second, our players rock.

In fact, you will probably see a lot more of me in game (perhaps as Firedog, and perhaps not), and I'll still be around on the boards and the onelist.

From an internal source at Origin, we were forwarded the email Jack Heistand, CEO of OSI sent to all Origin employees.

We learn from the<br>> past and we leverage our strenghts.  This next year presents challenges<br>> throughout all of EAWorld.  Every studio and publishing entity has been<br>> challenged to focus and reduce spending.<br>> This is a transition year in the games business.  This happens every 5<br>> years with the introduction of new hardware by the market leader.  This is<br>> particularly challenging because we are wanting to invest and being the<br>> transition to online as well.  So what does this for OSI?<br>> <br>> As we ponder how to get maximum benefit for our planned spending, it is<br>> clear to me, that we simply cannot fall into the trap of trying to do too<br>> much with too few resources. EA is prepared to invest 16mm behind Origin<br>> and the Ultima businesses.  This investment is one  of the top 2 franchise<br>> investments EA is making worldwide.  With that said it is not prudent for<br>> us to deploy precious resources behind the web based games and Privateer.<br>> These projects are well conceived with talented people behind them.<br>> However we do not have the resources to meet what the teams require to<br>> realize their vissions.  Moreover, with respect to Privateer we find<br>> ourselves with 2 products in EAWorld in development positioned right at<br>> each other.  <br>> <br>> As an organization a greater focus is required.  That focus will involve<br>> tightening our belts and concentrating on our core business...the worlds<br>> of Ultima.<br>> Here are the major changes:<br>> <br>> Richard Garriott will be leaving OSI.  Richard's contribution to OSI has<br>> been great and his legacy as the creator of Ultima is a tremendous<br>> responsibility for us to inherit.  There are few promoters, if any, that<br>> parallel Richard's ability in that area.  As Richard and I discussed his<br>> vision of what he wanted to do -create new large properties, OSI simply<br>> could not pursue those endeavors.  Wishing Richard only the best and all<br>> life has to offer as he embarks on his new challenges.<br>> <br>> In addition our workforce will be reduced by 20.  The goal has been to<br>> minimize the reduction in development personnel and reduce administrative<br>> spending in a prudent fashion.  We will work as passionately and<br>> dilligently to find those individuals affected by this reduction,<br>> opportunities within EAWorld or within their specific area of expertise in<br>> Austin.  Every individual will have a senior manager as a sponsor to help<br>> them identify and evaluate opportunities.<br>><br>> I know that the last few weeks have been taxing and these are difficult<br>> changes to absorb right away.   We have the talent, passion and a laser<br>> beam focus to execute the most strategic component of EA's online plan.<br>> As we move forward we will prove to the world what we already know--we are<br>> the best in the PSW business, bar none.</font><br><br>Continuing to follow the story as it develops.<br></font></td></tr></table><br clear=left><br><a name="newsitem954458645,23015,"></a>

Your e-mail has been received and I will personally read and respond to each as quickly as time permits.  Origins Systems Inc. and it's parent company Electronic Arts Inc. failed to meet a March 29, 2000 deadline to justify it's actions in what I believe can only be described as "Theft of the Consumer".<br><br>Who am I and what's this all about?<br>   My name is Betty, I live in Kalispell, Montana and I am one month away from graduating from the University of Great Falls with a degree in Business Management.  My strong dedication to customer service and satisfaction along with years of college has landed me a position with the worlds largest  retail outlet.  During my 15 month internship I have been dealing with product complaints and customer service issues and that's where Ultima Online comes into play. Not only have I received complaints about this product, I too was banned from Ulitma Online simply because my nephew, who was banned, had his account on my credit card.<br><br>What's in it for me?<br>   Unlike most, I was able to get through to the UO Admin and my account is under review and most likely after two years of playing without any problem<br>I would have gotten my account back, however,  if I accepted my account back and played on as if nothing happened I would not be true to myself and my friends.  As I move forward with my career, this is a great opportunity to add something to my portfolio that reflects my strong dedication and convictions to you, the consumer!<br><br>What I think is going on!<br>   With limited space on each shard, and as most of us know that the shards are full already due to the server lag and stability problems we have all experienced, and yet they still aggressively market their product, something has to give. Origins Systems Inc. has apparently chosen to find any reason possible to ban account holders and as a result allow room for more copies of their product to be sold.  Their own actions point to this, we have all noticed the recent changes in their policies all leading to the ability to ban accounts more easily along with removing the phone support for these issues.<br><br>   I have received hundreds of e-mails from people since I started this project on the evening of March 29th!  I am shocked at the magnitude of what<br>is going on and it is time to put a stop to this!  It is time for you, the consumer to speak out and be heard.<br><br>What is in store for Ulitma Online?<br>1)  I have already successfully had this product removed from Wal-Mart shelves and efforts are underway to stop all retail outlets from selling this product.<br><br>2) A formal complaint will soon be filed with the FCC, I am hoping to reach a goal of 1,000 e-mails from banned account holders to accompany it.<br><br>3) We are looking into the possibility that other methods may be used in an attempt to recover monetary value for former account holders in the near future.<br><br>4) A formal complaint to the Better Business Bureau will be sent early next week.<br><br>   Everyone tell your friends to pass this along, we need as many former account holders involved as possible. Contact the store where you bought your copy and file a complaint about the product. Go to <a href="http://www.bbb.com">http://www.bbb.com</a> (Better Business Bureau) and file a complaint.  We may end up loosing the battle but if we do nothing we will surely lose!<br><br>   I can't promise you that you'll get your account back or ever receive a dime for what you have lost however, I can promise you this, you will have my dedication to see this through and every possible method will be used to see that nobody else will fall victim to this poor customer service policy again!<br><br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>   The views and opinions contained within the letter are that of my own and may or may not be correct in part or in whole to the actions of the parties involved! This letter is not accusing Origin System Inc. or it's parent company Electronic Arts Inc. of any wrong doing.

Actual reputable news organizations <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/library/tech/00/03/circuits/articles/30wedd.html">are reporting</a> about weddings in and out of UO.

"Ultima is a very social and ethical world, so people tend to believe that who they are online is similar to who they are offline," he said. <br><br>Doug Davis, a psychologist and professor at Haverford College who is researching the psychology of online gaming, said the connection goes deeper. "Ultima has this tremendous involvement that gives players the feeling that they get an immediate glimpse into who people are," he said. "People quickly feel that they are learning something important about each other as they play the game." <br><br>That, indeed, was the Morrells' experience. "You can put on a face, but your true self always shines through online," said Mr. Morrell, who was known as Flint in the game. He said he was attracted to Ms. Sartore's intelligence and altruism. Ms. Sartore, known as Tess to other players, said she fell in love with Mr. Morrell's generosity. <br><br>"He was always so helpful to other characters," she said. "He gives money or armor to poor characters. He is always willing to stop and help anyone."</font><br><br><a href="http://lum.xrgaming.net/ubb/Forum2/HTML/000194.html"><b>UO is a very social and ethical world.

We're told that Origin's vast volunteer corps is carefully monitored for abuse.  I suppose they're prepared to look harder now, after a <a href="http://update.uo.com/fyi.html">new plea</a> for more free labor:<br><br><font color="#77FF77">The Ultima Online Counselor program is seeking applications for Counselors on the Siege Perilous and Formosa shards [...] As Siege Perilous is a unique shard, we do prefer that applicants for these positions have experience playing on the shard. Formosa applicants should be bilingual Chinese/English speakers. Because of these requirements, <b>we have relaxed program rules for Counselors on these shards, and do allow them to play on the same shard where they hold a Counselor position.</b></font><br><br>One of the biggest moves forward of the Great Volunteer Program Reform was to prohibit players from holding robed volunteer characters on their home shards.  Reason?  The volunteers would be less likely to abuse their "powers" because they would have no reason to further their own ends -- no close friends to work for, no enemies to work against, etc.  They wouldn't be on anybody's side.<br><br>In a perfect world with perfect people, we'd know we could trust our boys and girls in blue to behave themselves.  However, it's been proven over and over again that we can't expect such ethical behavior from most people, more so in the MMORPG community.  There are too many petty people out there;  too many use the volunteer program to gain personal power rather than satisfy an altruistic desire to help others.<br><br>If Origin needs support on Formosa so badly and if they really care about abuse, they should hire their own people to counsel until they get legitimate volunteers.  And I can see Siege's already-fragile politics fracture even more when some well-known player becomes a counselor there as well -- his or her identity couldn't be concealed for long.  Trust that volunteer to be an impartial outsider?

Our crack ninja spies have gotten a hold of the latest design document for UO. Have fun, kids!<br><br><b>ULTIMA ONLINE: REFORMATION</b><br><i>Player vs Player Enhancement Specifications</i><br><br>Changes to combat skills and weapons to increase the diversity and tactics in player vs. player combat (PvP) and combat as a whole. Note that many of these changes are related to each other. It is important to consider all of the changes together, rather than looking at one change by itself. Be sure to read the entire document carefully. <br><br><br><b>Archery</b><br>The archery skill will be significantly resturctured to make it more realistic and more effective in Player vs. Player combat.<ul><li>Current archery weapons will be replaced. Their replacements will be Handgun, Shotgun, and Plasma Rifle.<li>The damage and rate of fire of these weapons will be increased significantly.<li>Archery will be renamed "Gunnery" and Bowcrafting will be renamed "Gunsmithing".<li>Smithing of guns will require iron ingots. Creation of ammunition for guns will require sulfurous ash for handguns and shotguns, and valorite ingots (which will be renamed "plasma core") for plasma rifles. This will counterbalance the insta-kill nature of plasma rifles. We think.<li>All NPC rogues, wizards and paladins will carry shotguns and plasma rifles. All NPC beggars and seekers of adventure will carry handguns.<li>Players who continue to use bows and arrows in this new environment will be laughed at upon logging in (the laughter will be implemented in a future sound patch)</ul><br><br><b>Poisoning</b><ul><li>You will not be able to heal a poisoned character. You can, however, encourage the character and give them moral support as they die painfully.<li>A new poison, anthrax, can be found on sheep when slain. Anthrax may be dropped in a fountain in any town. All NPCs and PCs within that town will die within the next ten minutes.<li>Plasma rifles may not be poisoned.</ul><br><br><B>Parrying</b><br><br>The chance to successfully parry a melee attack and the amount of damage absorbed upon a successful parry will now depend on the type of shield the character is using, his/her parry skill, his/her intelligence and dexterity, the clothing he or she is wearing, the length of hair selected upon character creation, whether or not that character is in a guild, how much food the player has eaten recently, and the mood of the character (this is a server-side value). <br><br>The rumors that damage being parried is simply a random value from 0 to 100 are false.<br><br><b>Lumberjacking and Axes</b><br><br>The lumberjacking skill will provide a special move, "Off With His Head", when using the executioner's axe. This special move will instantly kill the lumberjack's opponent, unless the character in question is red (since it is the opinion of the dev team that red characters rarely require the use of their heads). The higher the characters lumberjacking skill the more chance of the move taking effect, up to a 15% chance for 99.9 lumberjacking. At Grandmaster lumberjacking, the chance is 20%. <br><br>In the future we may implement the continuation of play as a headless, with similar stats and skills to other headlesses.<br><br><b>Two-handed Weapons</b><br><br>Any melee weapon that requires two hands to wield will gain a special attack. The type of special attack will depend on the type of weapon used. These special attacks will only work against player characters, not against monsters or animals. <ul><li>Mace Weapons: "Skull Crusher" - the head of the opponent is caved in, resulting in 50-90 points of damage and a permanent loss of 50-90 Intelligence.<li>Sword Weapons: "Lionheart" - the opponent is beaten down by approximately 32,000 sword strikes. We hope to be able license the Final Fantasy 8 animation for "Lionheart" for this special move. It is hoped that lag will not be increased by 7 or 8 "Lionheart" animations on screen at once.<li>Fencing Weapons: "Gay Blade" - the opponent is paralyzed by laughter at your bringing such a useless weapon class into PvP. This paralyzation is non-resistable and non-interruptable. Especially by those damned trapped boxes.</ul>Upon a successful hit, there will be a small chance to inflict one of the special attacks. The base chance to inflict one of the special attacks is 20%. A high intelligence will give a small bonus towards the chance to execute a special attack up to a total chance of 30%. If you are using a plasma rifle, none of these apply, since you can pretty much kill anyone onscreen at will. We like plasma rifles.<br><br><b>Hitting and Intelligence</b><br><br>Currently, melee weapons check for whether a hit is successful or not in the beginning of the swing animation. This will now be scaled based on intelligence. The higher your intelligence, the earlier in your swing you hit. At very low intelligence, you will never swing at all, but simply stand there like a worthless simp and ask "George, can we see the rabbits now?" over and over.<br><br><b>Armor Changes</b><br>Armor ratings and dexterity penalties will be modified. The table below illustrates the changes: <br><br>Power Armor 40 AC/-22 DEX<br>Kewl Mail 28/-12 <br>Bilbo's Ring 22/-6 <br>Studded Leather Bondage Suit 16/0 <br>Leather Bondage Suit 13/0 <br>Bone Thugs N' Harmony Outfit 30/-15 (additional absorption of Gun damage)<br><br>Additionally, leather armor will not cause any meditation or stealth penalty, although occasionally large women with whips may take an unhealthy interest in you.<br><br><b>Recall</b><br><br>Recall is gay and will be removed. [Young] players will be allowed to cast recall, but a sound clip of an annoying child yelling "Thou Art Gay!" will play whenever recall is cast.<br><br><b>Ride-able Animals</b><br><br>The exploit that allows a ride-able animal to be refreshed after becoming fatigued will be addressed. Animals will now tire based on the weight of the person riding them. Additionally, animals will eventually require food, attention and love. No, not that kind of love.<br><br><b>Wrestling Moves</b><br><br>New attacks with the wrestling skill. <ul><li>"The Claw" - Player picks up a chair from his backpack and slams it over the head of his opponent, stunning them for 1-5 seconds.<li>"The People's Elbow" - Player prances gaily about the screen, pointing out his inherent superiority to all passers-by. Since he is prancing gaily, he may now cast Recall.<li>"The Twist" - Player marries Vince McMahon's daughter in a stunning reversal of fortune. Opponent is dumbfounded for 8-12 minutes.<li>"The Scrivener" - Player hires a scribe to write a best-selling book about his or her life. Fight is halted as the player walks around rubbing his chin trying to remember what in his life anyone would remotely care about.</ul><br><br>Tune in tomorrow for part two of this Special Secret Document, which explains while Begging, Forensic Evaluation and Cooking will soon become valuable PvP skills!<br><br><b><a href="http://lum.xrgaming.net/ubb/Forum2/HTML/000190.html">Makes sense to me.</a></b><br></font></td></tr></table><br clear=left><br><a name="newsitem954279710,12712,"></a>

Such things as Superior Healing going to 6.5sec casting delay, Spirit of Wolf losing 15% of its speed, Clarity giving less mana regeneration, Snare going to a 4 second casting delay, Lay on Hands and Harm Touch both chopped by a third. <a href="http://eq.castersrealm.com/viewarticle.asp?Article=1106">Fun stuff like that</a>. Needless to say, <a href="http://eq.castersrealm.com/forums/Forum3/HTML/000612.html">folks were a bit pissy</a>.<br><br>Brad McQuaid then said "<a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/028668.html">A-ha!

A troll modification to the test server...<br><br>Sure it was a joke (Maybe - it really remains to be seen and there is certainly lots of pre-history indicating that it might not be) but can't Verant see the resentment present on the *collective* boards across all EQ sites?

I was reading a site called <a href="http://www.crackednuts.net/woac/">Women of Asheron's Call</a>.  Figuring this was going to be really good, or really bad, I decided to poke around a bit.<br><br>My first reaction was "this site has some interesting information and content".<br><br>The second reaction was <b>"am I a Woman of Asheron's Call?"</b>.<br><br>I started playing female characters in Ultima Online about halfway through my association with that game.  I don't play <a href="http://lum.xrgaming.net/ubb/Forum1/HTML/002828.html">digi-sluts</a>, <a href="http://lum.xrgaming.net/kofMaiAnimated8.gif"> dominatrixes</a>, or <a href="http://www.mattelmedia.com/barbie/rapunzel/">helpless maidens waiting for a hero</a>.  I play characters that happen to be female.  My experience is that I am more likely to be treated as a human being than <a href="http://search.corbis.com/default.asp?s=dog+race&l=dog+race&b=3&v=1&a=3&p=2&r=9&m=1">competition</a> needing to be <a href="http://WWW-DB.Stanford.EDU/~mmorten/propaganda/wwii/russian--50/rwwii001.jpg">crushed</a>.  More importantly, it's interesting to play a fantasy game and be what you cannot be.  If there was a role-playing game that allowed you to simulate working eight hours a day in an office job, or that allowed you to pretend you were posting long-winded rants on the internet, or one in which you did things like changing the cat box, doing laundry, and paying bills, it wouldn't appeal to me - these are things I can do.  <b>"I don't need to play it, I live it!  Experience the adventure of my life!  Delusion Online, the first offering of MyIPO.com!"</b><br><br>This being a fantasy game, I think we're supposed to have a vivid enough imagination that we're willing to live up to the hackneyed clich that "nobody on the internet knows you're a talking frog unless you tell them".  Taking that as a given, I can play a well-adjusted female in a game, and be a well-adjusted man outside of it.  I don't play to flirt or to start meaningful love relationships with anyone.  For that matter, I don't play games to talk about real life.  I can do that at my leisure outside the game, be it on the net or off it.<br><br>So to get back to the point:  I am a Woman of Asheron's Call, and I am a man.  If you can't deal with that, that's your problem.  Hopefully when I send them my entry for their <a href="http://www.crackednuts.net/woac/closet/index.html">Fashion Parade</a>, they'll be open-minded enough to agree.  [Page is Netscape unfriendly, works in Internet Explorer]<br><br>Sadly, the invented domain MyIPO.com actually exists.  At least it's not an e-venture where you sell yourself for stock.<br><br><a href="http://lum.xrgaming.net/ubb/Forum2/HTML/000187.html">"Delusion stock falls 5 and 3/8ths after low first quarter health issues."</a><br></font></td></tr></table><br clear=left><br><a name="newsitem954193596,26018,"></a>

While most threads on our forum these days make me re-read <a href="http://www.soci.niu.edu/~critcrim/uni/uni.txt">Ted Kaczynski's theories</a> with an eye towards implementation (just call it my "Wild Nature") a few comments on the board lately have leapt up and slapped me with a fish. <br><br><font color="#77FF77">I was a full time scammer in the game for a while. It got me kicked out of numerous guilds, and I even looted a guild house I was in because I found out there were going to kick me. I must say it was the most fun I had ever had in the game.<br><br>I must say that scamming houses is easily the most lucrative business in UO. I made about 100k a week. It was also fun to see the rich people get brought down a level, proving that money does not equal intelligence.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-- "Joe"<br><br>My best scam? Probably stealing gm made katanas and go to bank and yell "GM made deadly poisoned katana's for sale 600$" made quite a fortune on that one and I made it up myself.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-- "Quake Dude"<br><br>Well, I gypped exactly 24 people out of there things in uo so far. I will post a picture on some of my gypps, as they're quite funny. I take the pic when the deed is in the window, and he has his window checked, so ya know it's real, at school now, and the teacher seems to be staring at me, so I will post later.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-- "AnGeL oF DeAtH"<br><br>My favorite thing to do used to be to spar with a friend right inside the guard-zone of Moonglow. Newbies would run up and stare at us. hehe I'd ask "Hey NewbieX want to spar?" "Sure!", he'd say. "Ok, just say 'I wish to spar thee.' and attack me while the words are still on your screen. Don't worry about the noto query... that's a bug they are fixing.", I would reply. I have several killed this way. Admittedly, it was cruel, but it was a way to get back at the newbies who yelled "I WAS JSUT PKED PLZZ GIVE ME SOME GOLD" all day long.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-- "Shogun"<br><br>Guess what my son did the first week he had an AC account all to himself? He put one of those expensive Mattaker robes for sale on EBay and sold it. That's not so bad in itself but he stole the robe in a scam. You see, I never said that he could not scam in games. In fact, he has been a big time scam artist in every game he ever played in. He's lightened up as he's grown older because he's starting to be interested in having online pals but still, he stole it in a game, and sold it in real life, making it like selling stolen goods in real life to me.<br><br>So here is my dilema. The AC account is going, that's for sure. Do I buy him a UO account knowing that he might be selling stolen and scammed loot from UO on EBay with my funding? Do I refuse to buy him UO and watch as he funds it with EBay? Or do I buy him the account and try to exert my influence on him as a role model instead of a father. See, there is this thing about being divorced. You just can't tell your kids what to do all the time because after a while they simply stop comming over to the house. Anyway, it's not really such a big deal because this is about the absolute worst thing he does. He realizes that online gaming is simply gaming and although he often daydreams about gaming he doesn't he doesn't act out his gaming fantasies in real life.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-- "Stormer"</font><br><br>There really is a dichotomy at work here. On the one hand, you have people trying to build a real online community - they work there, they play there, they fight there, they socialize there, mainly they <b>live</b> there. Due to UO's more holistic world simulation that is where you'll find most of these folks, although there is certainly a community in Asheron's Call and Everquest as well.<br><br>On the other hand, you have people who think the first group are just fucked up in the head. It's a <B>GAME</b>, they say. If you are so wrapped up in a game, you need therapy, you need to go outside and breath real air. Not coincidentally, a large part of these "in a community against our damned will" folks are PKs in UO. Not only PKs, but PKs who <i>specifically target the first group</i>.<br><br>The problem is less severe in EQ and AC, because you have to <b>work</b> at being a grief player in those games -- and in Asheron Call's case, the game itself is too young for the community members to really work up a good hatred of each other. Well except for Leafcull and Darktide. Sure, you can kill steal and pull trade scams and whatever, but the players of Ultima Online are <b>literally at war</b> with each other. You see it reflected in almost any UO-related message base (including ours), you see it just walking around in game. <br><br>As UO prepares to roll out its less-filling tastes-great not-a-mirror Renaissance expansion, it's worthwhile to look at how those warriors will adapt in the "consent lands". Take this rather overt declaration of war, for example:<br><br><font color="#77FF77">Do you truly believe I cannot bother you if you put me on ignore? I surely hope not, or you are more of a "newbie" than the thing under your name implies. There is this game called LevelQuest, I mean ummm... Everquest, (there I go with name calling again) adn in this game of happy go lucky-ness there is no PKing. But wait, hark I hear someone whining there too, oh yes they are whining about people camping spawns. And in LevelQuest, people camp and camp and camp and camp and camp and camp and camp and camp, and so on. I got money that says I can camp kills better than you. I think I'll start a character on Napa just so I can follow you to whereever you go to hunt and do more damage than you to it, loot it, get the fame, and then laugh at you (more to myself I guess since you put me on ignore when you thought it was cool). All of a sudden you are not making any money, you;re wasting regs, and I bet cause you're a whiner you call a smurf or a devil to come assist you cause you think I am harassing you. BUT I AM NOT, and they say, "I cannot assist thee!!!" over and over. All of a sudden you want ot pk me, but you CANT, so I keep on stelaing kills, and laughing silently to myself.<br><br>Once again if there were only a dozen sick depraved sociopaths etc and the rest of that hoopla that you said, then we wouldn't need new lands now would we. Oh yeah, and there wouldn't be a classifcation out there called "grief" players either, if htere were only a dozen of us. <br><br>Show me where in the TOS, exact phrase, that it says that I cannot camp a spawn, place my twenty pets in the way of your placing a castle, etc. I have tried to place a two story before and had to wait hours for all the ghosts, animals, etc.. to be gone. People were calling counselors and GMs left and right, and they always said, "I cannot assist thee" or "your call has been forwarded to a counselor".<br><br>I mean honestly, oh and in EQ. There's no camping? How do you figure? It has been two months since I watched a friend play but there was camping then. <br><br>I will not be staring at "a cannot connect screen". I don't macro anymore, I already did that; plus now what's the point. I have my five houses on one account, I have my XsploitZ, my bugs. Just looted a tower about an hour ago (thanks for friending me PN). <br><br>PKing is not illegal and in fact according to recent UOHoC logs and battlevortex conversations with DEV they see them as integral parts of the game. <br><br>what's my point? My point is, I don't violate TOS by doing what I want in game. Which happens to be giving you people grief. Outnumbered in the general UO population, sure I am, outnumbered on this site by even farther bounds. Do I care? Not really. Notice I still post what I want and when I want. If I were the only grief player left, and all my friends had quit I would still do it.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-- "Temptress"</font><br><br>The war continues; it just moves on to other fields of battle. <br><br>What bothers me in all of this is the utter amorality being expressed here. I'm not talking about the PK who whacks you for your lewt. That's part of the game in UO. Many people don't think it should be (thus the advent of UO:R) but a great many PKs are not amoral maniacs seeking to cause pain to the people behind the screen.<br><br>But the problem is that a great many <b>are</b>. They are part of the community, too - the nasty, brutish part we sweep under the rug of civility in real life. Online they see no need to hide the more asocial parts of their nature - the parts that see nothing wrong with scamming someone hours' worth of work simply because they can. That see nothing wrong with taunting a kill with their percieved inadequacy. That see nothing wrong with the most brutal, ugly, evil sorts of racial and sexual slurs that would get you instantly fired in almost any workplace in America. <br><br>That see nothing wrong with being an animal.<br><br><font color="#77FF77">Has anyone looked at the bigger, more logical picture?<br><br>People becoming attached emotionaly to a goddamn computer game. People spending thousands of dollars to have a "complete" virtual life.<br><br>Has anyone even considered that maybe these folks so attached to a fucking game are the real people with the fucking problem?<br><br>How many complete losers would contemplate suicide if OSI shut UO down tomorrow? I would suspect 2% since thats a easy number thrown out with nothing to back it up.<br><br>When I kill a player in game, if they get all worked up about needing another 30 minutes to get back to where they were then thats just too goddamn bad. If I need to recover from statloss it will take weeks.<br><br>This isnt about statloss, this isnt even about people with no life being emotionally attached to a fictitious world. (which in my eyes is a true sociopath) its about confused people. So confused that they still havent addressed the fact that Trammel exists.<br><br>Trammel is for people that dont want pk's!!! Get the clue?<br><br>I can't kill you there, you are safe there.<br><br>Go there, hoard your such valuable items so in real life you feel as though you accomplished some amazing feat.<br><br>Meanwhile I will continue to crush, kill, and generally be a thorn in anyones side that crosses my path wielding GM weapons and armor, or casting 8th circle spells. <br><br>For I am the hungry wolf and all of them are one big flock of furry edible sheep. Who are nothing more to me then dinner that night.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-- "Maligett"</font><br><br>Ultima Online achieved a great many "firsts", but here's one you won't see in any press release - it is the first mass market game that attracts people who want to victimize others. Not win, not dominate --- victimize. It imposes no limits on the strong harvesting the weak. Unlike other games which spend uncounted hours of design time trying to achieve a balance between player types -- look at the arguments on Quake web sites on the merits of various weapons, for example -- in UO, it is common, it is commonplace, for players of wildly superior ability, character skill set and equipment to slaughter those whom they feel they can.<br><br>And those are the <b>good</b> guys -- the ones playing by the rules. Maligett may be a big old wolf looking for sheep to abuse, but he does so within the game's intended mechanics. UO was <b>designed</b> for that. <br><br>What then, of the looter? The scammer, the wise guy who sticks a greater heal for 50,000gp on his vendor, the exploiter who knows all the latest tower breakin tricks. Thanks to measures taken in the name of wolf control - stat loss mainly - these virtual vermin are far more commonplace than the wolves. They're the same folks who sat outside town waiting for newbies to gank. They adapted. <br><br>Every so often it's noted that this ... this digital sociopathy, as termed by someone who was flamed vehemently for her trouble, affects those who affect it. It takes a very special kind of person to, as I read once, break into a roleplaying community's tower, methodically destroy everything within, not bothering to steal anything, and then, when one of the woman owners comes home, kill her and gloat to her ghost. <br><br>Something is wrong -- something is broken. Both in the game and in the player. And in the community that sees this as normal accepted behavior. Everything you do reflects you. The games you play, the characters you portray, the rants you write. You can only be human by well, being human. <br><br>Because the war is not over -- it's never over -- and running back home to Trammel won't solve a damn thing. And you can't code morality, as Everquest is finding out as its guides are flooded with complaints of people not Playing Nice. <br><br>The only people who can fix this are other people. People who won't make me ashamed to log into UO, to read my own message base, to be a human being. <br><br>You, basically. <br><br><i>"You dare to imply the son of Duke Leto Atreides is an animal?"<br>"I do more than that, young one. I dare to imply that you are human."</i><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-- Frank Herbert, "Dune" (quoted from memory, probably badly)<br><br><b><a href="http://lum.xrgaming.net/ubb/Forum2/HTML/000186.html">The flames start on the right, dear</a></b><br></font></td></tr></table><br clear=left><br><a name="newsitem954181980,50800,"></a>

Just a few hit and run items, most related to our gimped forum.<br><br>First off, of course, is the invasion of Singapore.

John "Superfly" Smedley visited the ShowEQ gang in IRC yesterday, giving out job offers, shilling his new games and patting everyone on the back on a job well done. This is roughly akin to Richard Garriott showing up on irc.drtwister.com and giving Dr. Twister a Hi-howaya. You have to respect the man's cajones, even while wondering at his everything else. Here's some quotes (go <a href="http://eq.castersrealm.com/viewarticle.asp?Article=1071">here</a> for the whole chat log)<br><br><font color="#77FF77">I do want to let you guys know that despite the fact that we're changing it every time we patch, we aren't patching because of it. We're not that bored ;) Besides, it's kind of fun.. we patch.. 2 hours later you fix it ;) <br><br>---<br><br>Today was a rather amusing day. We've been watching for a long time. I hate to say it, but a lot of people aren't very subtle in their use of ShowEQ.<br><br><i>What's proof in showEq bans?</i><br><br>Well.. immediately going after certain spawns is a pretty good indicator that most of these rocket scientists go for.<br><br>---<br><br>We make money on this game.

After banning him, of course.<br><br>---<br><br>We have looked at ShowEQ pretty close. 2 days ago we were really impressed actually. Got a smile out of our server programmer. Well. liked is perhaps the wrong term, but we were impressed with the speed at which you guys figured it out. The statistical method was impressive. I would love to talk to him [Megaton, the ShowEQ coder] sometime.<br><br>---<br><br>We thought of an amusing way to screw with you guys. Different encryption on a per server basis.

Some people like nothing better than to disparage others, even when there's no real reason to do it.  Case in point:  the names people have been coming up with for the Promised Not-a-Mirror Land, Trammel.  Players angry about ... something ... are putting entirely too much effort into thinking up "insulting" names for the consent lands; their imaginations have come up with such monnikers as Barney Land, Carebear Land, Queer Land, Candy Land ... "UO with its balls cut off," as one person eloquently stated.<br><br>I just don't get it.  You don't really see future new lands residents referring to Felucca as anything but "the PvP lands" (unless they're arguing over Trammel names on our message board, in which case they start spouting such things as "Nazi Sociopathic Quake Player Land" in jest).  And the Trammel citizens haven't been making comments on the gender and sexual orientation of the Felucca populace.  I wouldn't be surprised to see it, though.<br><br>What are you people angry about?  Why start calling each other's land masses all the demasculinizing putdowns you can come up with?  What are you trying to prove?<br><br>It's nothing to do with the lands themselves, if you think about it; it's just part of the timeless "PvPer vs. RPer" debate we've always had to deal with before and will always have to deal with in the future (see Lum's Thursday update for more perspective on the validity of the "teams").  But <i>really</i> ... what are you accomplishing in the battle with these silly names?  Are you winning a skirmish?  Are you making progress in the war?  No ... you're not doing anything at all.<br><br>Let's be civil, just this once.  You call Trammel "Trammel," or "the consent lands," and we'll call Felucca "Felucca," or "the PvP lands."  Is it really that difficult to get along, or do we need to continue pulling each other's hair and making comments about each other's mothers on the playground?<br><br><a href="http://lum.xrgaming.net/ubb/Forum2/HTML/000183.html"><b>Nitpick with me.</b></a><br></font></td></tr></table><br clear=left><br><a name="newsitem953929391,76610,"></a>

There was a UOHoC last night. Sage Thunderlips has the full lowdown since I was busy driving my car at 5mph with a blown transmission through downtown Little Rock at night. I suspect he had more fun.<br><br><font color="#77FF77">(From the UTB board) Chat tonight was very informative on what we can expect on house placement in the new lands. The entire chat will be posted at UOHOC usually within 24 hours. Here are some of the highlights. <br><br>House placement in the new lands. I was actually very surprised by what they will be doing. They will be doing house placements in stages. First only castles will be able to be placed. This time period will last for 1 to 2 days. During this time no other houses of any kind except castles will be placeable. Then comes Keeps. The placement period for keeps will be 3 or 4 days. Towers. They mentions that they expect that towers will be able to be placed for about 1 week. Large houses. Large Bricks, 2 stories and Smithies will last for about another week. After this time period all houses will be able to be placed. Also it should be mentioned that they stated that there are at least a few new house designs that will be available. No details as of yet except for they stated that they will be of a couple different sizes.<br> <br>(My take) As it is now, only about 12 castle spots exists per shard so I image they will all be gone in the first 15 minutes.  Worse, 8 of them are on ice isle so I can image tamers deliberly blocking spots with blue pets (and you can't do one damn thing about it on barney land). Personally I think they should just have a random lottery for house placement in the new lands.  <br> <br>Another note worthy item is all of the original rare items will spawn on new land opening.  I imagine all of those will be gone within 20 minutes as well, but let me know if you looking for something in particular and I can give you the location.  I know about where everything spawns.

Every so often, I just get a random moment of clarity. I'm sure many of you do, as well... that moment where you just suddenly look up and, as light shines from the heavens and a harp can be faintly heard in the distance, you say softly to yourself, "What the hell am I doing, anyway?"<br><br>Supposedly this is a web site about online roleplaying games. Or online murder death kill games. Or online fluffy bunny meadows. OK, I have no goddamn earthly idea what this web site is about. (looks up at icon o'the week) Maybe it's about Star Wars? I don't know. Maybe I should just start posting rants on how Boba Fett could kick Boss Nass's ass or something. <br><br>The core problem of each and every one of these games we supposedly cover are that people are involved. Individually, people are generally noble and good. Collectively, people are a powerful argument for the uncontrolled proliferation of very nasty biological weapons. And some of you <B>are</b> very nasty biological weapons, judging from recent posts on my "hmm maybe I should just replace the damn thing with Barney videos" message base. I mean, one of the most active topics on the message base right now is oral sex. Jesus. Maybe I should just start posting random pictures of Jenna Jameson and Strom Thurmond - together again for the very first time - I mean, it's better then yet another interminable 900 message post about stat loss.<br><br>Stat loss is giving me a fucking headache now. The very concept just makes me hurt. Not the concept of stat loss, the concept of everyone <b>talking</b> about stat loss. The fact that, hey, there might actually be some <i>issues</i> here involving the current implementation of responsibility for in-game actions has just been buried in a tidal wave of shit. On one hand you have the cuddly dread lords saying that goddamn it, they should be allowed to just kill who the fuck they want because the roleplayers got their land and we don't have our land and it's just not fair and goddamit I'm holding my breath until I turn brown. On the other hand you have the equally cuddly "roleplayers" (and by the way, diving a playerbase into "killers" and "roleplayers" is just an entirely new means of insanity that also makes blood want to spurt uncontrollably out of my eyes when I start to think about it) who are all pissy that their world might ever be so slightly altered and who the hell made <b>them</b> move their quite illegally placed player towns anyway and why the hell couldn't those icky PKs just be the ones to move and leave them the hell alone because they never bothered everyone and no one has any right to interfere with their game anyway, including the monsters.<br><br>My solution is simple. Remove all players and let the NPCs fight it out. I have never heard a fucking NPC whine like you players. Oh, sure, they may yell about paying their taxes and no guards ever showing up, but they certainly don't fire up web sites and petitions and twice-a-minute postings on whatever message base might accidentally attract the attention of a Holy Apostolic Red Named Personage. NPCs are remarkably well behaved. They require very little maintenance. They don't actually pay money which could be a problem for funding ORPGs but I think this is a problem that can be eventually worked out. eBay may be involved. This solution is already working quite well for Everquest, as NPCs are the only ones who can actually play the damn game.<br><br>Failing that, I think we should have an ombudsman for all ORPGs. Said ombudsman would have the power to, at will, remove internet access from any person, at any time, for any reason. For obvious reasons I think I should be this ombudsman. I promise only to use these powers for good, unless otherwise motivated.<br><br>Jesus, you people make my brain hurt. Stop it. Grow a clue.

Ever wonder how many licks it takes to get to the center of a tootsie roll tootsie-pop? I know I have. If I ever <i>really</i> needed to know the exact count I'll just ask Trazal Memornix, who was kind enough to send me the following Geological Survey of Sosaria.

Out of sheer boredom, I decided to figure out exactly how large the world is. It is alot smaller then I would have thought.<br>First of all, the world of Sosaria has to be measured. Thanks to the wonderful utility <a href="http://uo.stratics.com/uoam/index.html">UO Automap</a>, I was able to do this. Using the unit of game tiles the world comes out to 5120 by 4095 tiles, not including T2A or dungeons, since they are underground. Doesn't sound like alot.<br><br>Multiply those together, and you get whopping 20,966,400 tiles. That sounds a little better. So the game world has over 20 million possible places you can be standing. Of course mountains and water are included in that, but there are still alot of places you can be.<br><br>Next, I take into account that when a character is standing in one spot, they take up only one tile. Being an average 6-foot tall person, I figure I would take up about the same amount of space as my virtual self. While standing, I take up a space that is about 2 foot by 1.5 foot, but for the sake of ease, we will say 2 foot by 2 foot.  4 square feet is what I use, so 4 square feet is what we will call a tile.<br><br>Now, this is where things start to get interesting. We know that the world is 20,966,400 tiles big. We know that I (an average size person) takes up 4 square feet. Simple multiplication will get us to the number 83,865,600. That is the size of the world, in simulated square feet, we play in.<br><br>Let&#8217;s take a mile. One mile is 5280 feet long. One square mile contains 27,878,400 square feet. Simply dividing 83,865,600 by 27,878,400 you get a miniscule 3 square miles. Assuming that the world is a sphere, as it is represented, the diameter would be a little under 1 mile.<br><br>To give you a comparison of size, here are some common places.<br><center><br>Walt Disney World - 47 Square Miles<br>Austin, Texas - 225 Square Miles<br>Rhode Island - 1,045 Square Miles<br>The Moon - 14,670,000 Square Miles<br></center><br>Granted, with the new lands coming, we will have 6 square miles to play with, but as it stands, the world we play in is much smaller then some people&#8217;s back yard.<br></font><br>Class dismissed.

I swear - this is the last stat loss article I'm posting in, god, probably forever. But this makes a good final word.<br><br>Here's a statement from Calandryll, Origin's Online Community Coordinator, that is one of the clearest statements on Origin's current thoughts about player killing and its consequences that we've heard in quite a while, made in response to a PK (Alice Cooper of J-D) who sent in a reasoned appeal against stat loss. Since I feel this is such an important statement and don't want to take the risk of taking any of it out of context, I've decided to quote it in full. Let's just cut straight to the chase.<br><br><font color="#77FF77">You bring up some very interesting points...actually, you seem to have two points.  One that stat-loss is not needed (at all or as much) because of the consent only lands and two, that the anti-macro code will make it difficult (in your estimation, impossible) to recover from stat-loss.  I'll do my best to address each point.<br><br>First the consent lands issue.  We disagree that stat-loss is not needed simply because we are opening consent only lands.  As I stated in the post that Lum copied, we don't see the two lands as opposite sides of a coin, one where everything is happy and safe and the other where might makes right. The design of these two lands is not intended to shuffle off players based on their play style to different lands.  Players should feel comfortable traveling to both of the lands depending on what exactly they wish to do that day.  Both lands should be dangerous, but we do not wish to create a wasteland of chaos full of murderers with no (or little) consequences for their actions.<br><br>The point of the enhanced PvP lands is not to create a place where players can murder with impunity.  In fact, the real point of these lands is PvP with consequences.  The two major types of PvP that will occur on Felucca (PKing and Faction system) both have consequences.  The consequence for being in a faction means you will be hunted by other factions, you have to maintain a certain kill count to keep your rank and status in the faction, etc.  The consequence for murdering innocents is stat-loss.  Being a murderer should not (and will not) be easy.<br><br>Your second point is that when a PK dies, he will have an impossible time recovering from stat-loss.  With the new anti-macro code, one cannot regain skills lost when staying in the same location (such as a house).  In order for anyone to gain skills (PK or not) they have to move around and gain through normal gameplay.  So in effect, yes, the system has created a very dangerous situation for the stat-loss PK.  If he chooses to go out into the world to regain his skills, he is still subject to stat-loss again.  Some would argue that while they think there should be penalties for murdering, the current combinations of systems (stat-loss and anti-macro code) make it too much. Others would argue that is the price to pay for being a murderer, that is the price for killing a player who has no desire to be in PvP at all.   Currently we are debating that very issue (which is why I asked that players continue to debate it) but at this time, we don't have any specific plans to change anything.  I need to make that clear because I most certainly do not want to set up a false expectation within the PK community. But as I said, we are discussing the implications of stat-loss taking into account the new anti-macro code. If (and I stress the word IF) anything did change, more than likely it would not be in the upcoming publish at this point.  Right now, we have no plans to change anything.<br><br>I would like to make sure you know that I do intend to pass this e-mail around to the team.  In fact, I did see your post on Lum's in response to my comments and forwarded those along as well.  We've been reading and discussing the stat-loss posts since even before the official announcement was made to keep it.  PKing and stat-loss are two very emotionally charged issues that many players (on both sides) feel very passionately about.  I strongly believe that everyone's voice should be heard on this matter, whether they are a PK or not.  <br><br>Also, since you cced Lum on this, I figured I'd go ahead and answer the questions he posed on his front page with regards to PKs. <br><br><i>Do you see being a PK in UO as a "valid style of play"?</i><br><br>Yes.<br><br><i>Are the new features of UO:R designed to reduce "classic" PKing (reds destroying everything they see)?</i><br><br>If you mean, do we want to get away from the old dread days when players were afraid to leave town and PKs dominated the lands killing innocents with virtually no consequences for their actions...then yes.  Actually that was the point of stat-loss and the rep system more than UO:R.  The features in UO:R (such as Trammel) give those who do not want to be involved in non-consensual PvP a choice.<br><br><i>Would you like to see PKers continue to play UO? </i><br><br>Yes.<br><br><i>Would you like to see them continue to play UO as PKs?</i><br><br>Sure...with the consequences of doing so (right now, that means stat-loss).<br><br><i>How do you feel about the statement "with these changes, there is no way to be evil in UO"?</i><br><br>I'd disagree with that statement.  I think players can play evil without killing innocents over and over again.  In fact, the faction system will provide a context for players to play evil if they really want to.  In addition to that, we will be running fiction in conjunction with the faction system to give even more meaning to them.  If a player wants to continue to PK despite that system, they can do so, but the consequences for doing so will remain.</font><br><br>Well, there you have it. It doesn't get any clearer, folks. Basically, if you don't want to play under stat loss, welcome to Siege Perilous. The dev team is aware that reds are going to have a very hard time of it recovering from stat loss. Whether or not this will change anything is debatable.<br><br>Here's some more reading.<br><br><a href="http://azile.tradespot.net/">Azile's declaration of war on everyone not a murderer</a><br><br><font color="#77FF77">A war against all whiny little bitchs out there everywhere.

From the <a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/024438.html">EQ Gameplay Forum</a>, here's a sneak preview of the new Kunark class descriptions. Woot!<br><br>---<br><br>Warrior - The warrior is the unparalleled master of weapons in the game. A warrior can also wear the best of armors in Norrath. Unfortunately, the warrior requires a change of pants every 5 days because the butt of their pants wears out due to sitting for 30 - 60 minute periods of health recovery. It should be noted that reinforced derrier gear is a recommended piece of apparel for all classes in Norrath.<br><br>Paladin - The paladin is the knight of noble cause. They are the best <br>defensive class in all of Norrath. Unfortunately, they can't kill anything, but they can certainly heal themselves multiple times. They also have the ultimate ability to taunt the mobs they can't hit and stick their tongues out at them with extreme grace.<br><br>Shadow Knight - Shadow Knights are the dark fallen knights of Norrath. They are hated by most of the citizens of Norrath. For various inventory shortages, Shadow Knights cannot currently do any melee damage. When the new inventory arrives (somewhere around the time that Mayong Mistmoore comes back from visiting Jimmy Hoffa) they may or may not actually be able to do melee damage. They also have the ability to syphon life off their prey. They can do it twice. Then their mana is drained and they have to recover. On the upside, Shadow Knight pets, at the highest levels, can solo giant rats without even dying, thus keeping the Shadow Knight alive to continue their escapades.<br><br>Rogue - The rogue is the dirty scoundrel of Norrath. They have the ability to backstab monsters (once, before being bludgeoned to death) and they can pick the pockets of their prey (once, before being bludgeoned to death by their party.) They also have the ability to poison their victims through a vastly complex poisoning system. Unfortunately, rogues cannot use poison often, due to large shortages in the poison supply to Norrath.<br><br>Monk - The monk is master of hand to hand combat in Norrath. With a wide variety of non-weapon skills, they can out damage most other classes. They are also master pullers. Unfortunately, the monsters in Norrath have been retrained at the "Innoruk School of Feign Death Exploitation" and a monk utilizing his skill on monsters that have attended the ISFDE will see through this tactic and decide to have Monk Livers for dinner. The added benefit of playing a monk is that you won't need to do any questing for your character. We have eliminated this requirement by keeping the monk quests to a relative minimum.<br><br>Bards - The bard is the charismatic singer of Norrath. They have a wide variety of extremely useful songs that can help a party do unbelievably helpful things such as teleport 10 feet away! The bard is the most well-liked class of all the classes in Norrath, especially by the monsters.  The monsters love their singing so much, they give the bard a wonderful slap on the back whenever they sing. Due to limited inventory, many of the bard instrument shipments were intercepted before reaching Norrath, so bards will have to stick with their low level instruments until the enhanced ones arrive.<br><br>Rangers - The ranger is a master of the outdoors, second only to the druid. The ranger is almost the master of the bow, but due to class changes, they are outmatched by their warrior counterparts. The ranger is almost the master of dual wield, 4th only to monks, warriors, and rogues. Rangers are a light, nimble fighter, able to dodge and parry against a mob with the utmost of precision, especially up to the middle levels, when their dodging and parrying abilities are mastered. Rangers are almost the best tanks in all of Norrath, with their armor class only bested by monks, warriors, paladins, bards, and shadowknights.<br><br>Necromancers - Necromancers are the outcast magic users of Norrath. They are hated by most of the denizens of Norrath. Fortunately for Necromancers, they can usually kill all of the denizens of Norrath without having to get any assistance. The Necromancer is the master of damage over time spells. Unfortunately, the monsters of Norrath were forced to attend the "Cazic Thule School of DoT Reduction" which assisted the monsters in damage mitigation of these spells. The Necromancer pet is one of the most feared pets in all of Norrath. Recently, those pets were sent on a week long vacation to "The Vasty Deep" and when they came back, they had forgotten many of the skill they previously had. The Necromancer is the master of soloing, and they prove that on a daily basis.<br><br>Magicians - The Magician in the master of summoning in Norrath. They can summon such useful items as a Sword of Runes! If you party with a magician, you will never want to leave Norrath, lest you lose that sword. The magician has a series of pets, all of which carry unique abilities. Recently, the magician pets attended the "Veeshan School of Hard Knocks" and relearned the skillful art of dual wielding! Immediately afterward, they went on vacation with the Necromancer pets, and forgot how to use some of their melee skills.<br><br>Enchanters - The Enchanter is a master of buffing and debuffing in Norrath. They can be classified, also, as the biggest drug dealers in Norrath. An Enchanter can provide crowd control and can significantly enhance a party through the use of speed spells. The Enchanter is also the master of enchanting bars of metal. With this skill, they are also one of the potentially richest classes in all of Norrath. The Enchanter pet is a fearsome yet frail pet. Their pets ALSO went on vacation and lost skill recently.<br><br>Wizards - The Wizard is the master of direct damage spells in all of <br>Norrath. Provided the Wizard has ample debuffing support, they can cast spells that do upwards of 1250 damage to a single large bat! They are the masters of magical travel, able to teleport parties to such popular locations as Greater Faydark, Western Commonlands, and Northern Karana. The Wizard can also provide themselves with superior damage absorption. A Wizard chain casting their greatest direct damage spells is only limited by the amount of damage they can absorb from the monsters they are attacking. With a good melee class in the party, the wizard will only get hit a few times by the monster before the melee class can regain the monster's attention. The Wizard is generally regarded as the most rounded class in all of Norrath, but is scheduled from some improvements in the near future.<br><br>Druids - The druid is the master of the outdoors, Dwarves, Gnomes, and Freeport Guards. They are the master of animals, able to lull an animal almost every time they attempt to! They can apply damage shields to deter future monster involvement with them, and they can apply significant buffs to enhance their role in Norrath. They are also one of three classes in Norrath that can change into a wolf! In addition to all of these benefits, the Druid is also a master of magical travel and will only charge you nominal fees to teleport you wherever you want to go. The Druid is also the master of spawn locations, able to retrieve rare and exotic items from far off lands for you, for a nominal fee.<br><br>Clerics - The Cleric is the master of healing in Norrath. The Cleric has buffs, healing, and direct damage spells that make it a well-rounded class. They can also summon a warhammer! Their class specific quest armor is some of the most eye pleasing armor that will ever done the bags in one's bank account. The Cleric is a high commodity in dungeons, able to heal a party member to full health and only get bludgeoned to death sometimes. The Cleric also has the class-specific ability to ressurect dead bodies and restore some of their lost experience. And they won't usually have to run too far to get to the body, although sometimes it requires a short trip across Norrath, paying the druid only a nominal fee.<br><br>Shamans - The Shaman is the master of buffing in Norrath. They are also second only to Necromancers in the damage over time spells. The Shaman will improve the overall performance of a party through the use of buffs, improving the party almost 2 percent! They have significant healing abilities, and can even summon a wolf elemental pet! The Shaman is the best tank-mage class in all of Norrath, able to stand toe to toe with a monster and only die sometimes. The Shaman is also the master of foot travel in Norrath. The first time you see a Shaman running through one of the wonderous areas of Norrath with a mere four or five monsters in tow, you will marvel at this ability. The Shaman can also debuff monsters, and only get resisted by those monsters most of the time.<br><br>So choose your class. When you do, make sure you put your bonus points into  appropriate statistical skills to enhance the class. We won't go into which skills do what. Once you play for a while, we'll let you decide whether you  chose the right skills or not.<br><br><br></font></td></tr></table><br clear=left><br><a name="newsitem953672644,3961,"></a>

Alice Cooper is in a bit of a bind.<br><br>No, not because he hasn't had a hit record in over a decade. This is the other Alice Cooper, guildmaster for <a href="http://members.aol.com/mephjdd/uo.html">J-D</a>, the folks who bring you fast, friendly service with a smile as they kill you. J-D is a murderer guild, otherwise known as "Red PKs", and shortly to be known as "extinct", for reasons we've gone over already in brutal detail.<br><br>J-D recently held an in-game protest on Chesapeake, which consisted of as many people as possible peacefully cramming into Lord British's eternally empty throne room. (You know, I think the only time that place is used is for protests. Oh, and when expansions need to get sold.) GM Lint and GM Perkons showed up, and Alice stated his case against stat loss and how it would destroy his guild. The GMs told him that that was somewhat outside a GM's jurisdiction, and told him to make his case on the <a href="http://boards.xrgaming.net/cgi/cob/devboard.cgi?view">CoB Dev Board</a>.<br><br>He did that today. Or tried to. I'd link to his message, but it doesn't exist. He tried posting it three times. The first two times it was deleted. The third time it actually stayed up, probably because the moderators missed it, but was ignored by Calandryll, who was replying to topics before and after that post, and eventually scrolled off into the chaotic void of CoB Dev Board cries. He then tried to repost his message, but was deleted. He then asked why his posts were being deleted, and <b>that</b> post was deleted.<br><br>Now before you write this off as just another stat loss whine of which you see 900 a day on every UO board in existence, bear in mind - the GM told him to post it. He told him to post it on the CoB dev board. Alice did this, and it was deleted. Alice would be at this point quite justified in thinking that he was pretty much screwed no matter what he did.<br><br>Now then. Here's the problem. There obviously is a significant part of the UO community (even if only 5%, as Tyrant noted, 5% of 150,000 is significant) that is feeling slighted by the UO community in general and the UO "leadership" in particular. The problem is that they feel as if they are shouting into a vacuum. So far the only official statements on stat loss and UO:R have been these:<br><br><font color="#77FF77"><B>Calandryll, March 19</b><br><br>As far as what should and should not be posted here on the Dev board, that is up to the CoB admins. If players want to post their feelings and opinions on statloss, they are welcome to do so, wherever the CoB admins deem the appropriate place to post. I'll read the posts and forward the thoughts and opinions of the players to the team, regardless of the issue, whether it is stat-loss or any other feature.<br><br>I don't see how posting that we are not removing is not helping. In fact, I think that is a far cry better than misleading you into thinking we might remove it. We have no plans to remove statloss at all...and I'll continue to say that so long as it holds true.<br><br>As far as the in-game protest, well I was not there so it's hard for me to comment on it. I can say that if we feel the service is being distrupted, then the appropriate action will be taken to ensure that it is not. We provide many different ways for players to post their opinions of the game, from replying to the messages here, the suggestions@uo.com box and of course my e-mail. All of those are much better ways to get your point across than an in-game protest.<br><br><B>Calandryll, March 14</b><br><br>And I appreciate and encourage debate [regarding stat loss]. But I also don't want to set false expectations. I wanted to make sure people knew that their ideas and suggestions were being read however.<br><br><B>Calandryll, March 14</b><br><br>The two lands are not opposite sides of a coin. Simply because one land is a consent only area, does not mean the other land is the free-for-all area where everyone has consented to all forms of PvP. <br><br>The enhanced PvP area is enhanced by virtue of the faction system. I know some may not be interested in that system, but it is a PvP enhancement nonetheless and it is a huge system. <br><br>Really the enhanced PvP area is about consquences for PvP actions. In the faction system, you get ranks and take cities. With PKing, you get murder counts and stat-loss. The enhanced PvP area was never designed to be a free-for-all PvP area. We could call it the PvP Consequence lands I suppose. :)<br><br><B>Sunsword, March 3</b><br><br>I am considering some options for reds to perhaps become "un-red" ONCE.<br><br><B>Sunsword, March 2</B><br><br>Your concern is a "target poor environment", yes? I don't think you'll have to worry. The PvP Enhanced area is going to be a blast. Announcements to come on it. There will be plenty of folks there trying to take control of Britannia's cities and siege the enemy strongholds.<br><br><i>Further on, same thread (I assume the respondenet replied that he wanted unwilling targets)</i><br><br>Okay, now I'm finding it hard to sympathize. I'm not really worried that I'm removing newbie targets from predators...</font><br><br>And that's all she wrote folks. By my count, that is about a 1:10,000,000 ratio of dev team responses to stat loss postings.<br><br>(Many thanks to Newton Dragon for maintaining the <a href="http://www.moongates.com/uj.exe?devarchives+0+0">Update Journal Dev Archives</a>, which keeps track of these posts.)<br><br>What's clearly needed - and not forthcoming - is <b>a clear statement of philosophy</b> from the UO dev team on PKing. Specifically, are they really trying to drive PKs from the game? Are the punitive measures going in place to deter red PKs intentional? If so, proposing countermeasures seems kind of futile, you'd think.<br><br>I sent this email to Sunsword, Toad and Runesabre back on 3/6, when this hoofrah first started escalating to insane levels.<br><br><font color="#77FF77">The PK community is up in arms over the continuation of stat loss in the enhanced PvP area. I think a couple of philisophical "statements from the mountaintop" would be clarifying:<br><br>Do you see being a PK in UO as a "valid style of play"?<br><br>Are the new features of UO:R designed to reduce "classic" PKing (reds destroying everything they see)?<br><br>Would you like to see PKers continue to play UO? Would you like to see them continue to play UO as PKs?<br><br>How do you feel about the statement "with these changes, there is no way to be evil in UO"?</font><br><br>To date, I haven't recieved a response, which will probably not surprise those of you who mailed basically the same questions.<br><br>It's not a matter of communication -- the message has been shouted so much, you can't hear it any more for the racket. It's a matter of leadership. And so far, <b>we're not seeing any</b>.<br><br>Of course, the other alternative is that, to quote another ORPG, it's time to Play Nice. Change your playstyle, whether it be to factions, or PvM, or just being a prick while remaining blue. If that's the case, <b>it needs to be communicated.</b> Clearly. Plainly. It's only fair, both to the people who are red, and to people who might become red in the future.<br><br>I mean, the intent wouldn't be to drive away 5% of UO's customer base, would it? That's $75,000 a month. And when expressed that way, it's not insignificant by <b>any</b> measurement.<br><br><b><a href="http://lum.xrgaming.net/ubb/Forum2/HTML/000178.html">*You see Lum sigh as he opens yet another thread on the subject*</a></b><br></font></td></tr></table><br clear=left><br><a name="newsitem953663054,64696,"></a>

You have been warned.</i><br><br><font color="77FF77">Wellhung: Hello, Sweetheart. What do you look like?<br><br>Sweetheart: I am wearing an expensive red silk blouse, a black leather miniskirt and high heeled boots. I am tan and very buffed. I work out everyday. My measurements are 36-24-36. What do you look like?<br><br>Wellhung: I'm 6'3" and about 250 lb.. I wear glasses and have on a pair of blue sweatpants I just bought at Walmart. I'm also wearing an old T-shirt, it's got some barbecue sauce stains on it...and it smells kind of funny.<br><br>Sweetheart: I want you. Would you like to screw me?<br><br>Wellhung: OK<br><br>Sweetheart: We're in my bedroom. There's soft music playing on the stereo and candles on my nightstand. I look up into your eyes and I'm smiling. My hand works its way down to your crotch and I begin to feel your huge swelling bulge.<br><br>Wellhung: I'm gulping. I'm beginning to sweat.<br><br>Sweetheart: I'm pulling up your shirt and kissing your chest.<br><br>Wellhung: Now, I'm unbuttoning your blouse. My hands are trembling.<br><br>Sweetheart: I'm moaning softly.<br><br>Wellhung: I'm taking hold of your blouse and I'm sliding it softly off.<br><br>Sweetheart: I'm throwing my head back in pleasure. The cool silk slides off of my warm body. I'm rubbing your bulge faster now, rubbing and pulling.<br><br>Wellhung: My hand suddenly jerks spastically and tears a hole in your blouse. I'm sorry. <br><br>Sweetheart: That's, OK. It wasn't really too expensive.<br><br>Wellhung: I'll pay for it.<br><br>Sweetheart: Don't worry about it! I'm wearing a lacy black bra, my soft breasts are rising and falling as I breathe harder and harder.<br><br>Wellhung: I'm fumbling with the clasp of your bra, I think it's stuck. Do you have scissors?<br><br>Sweetheart: I take your hand and kiss it softly, I reach behind my back and undo the clasp. My bra slides off. The cool air caresses my breasts, my nipples are erect for you.<br><br>Wellhung: How did you do that? I'm picking up the bra and inspecting the clasp.<br><br>Sweetheart: I'm arching my back. Oh baby I just want to feel your tongue all over me.<br><br>Wellhung: I'm dropping the bra. Now I'm licking your, you know, breasts. They're neat!<br><br>Sweetheart: I'm running my fingers through your hair. Now I'm nibbling your ear.<br><br>Wellhung: I suddenly sneeze. Your breasts are covered with spit and phlegm.<br><br>Sweetheart: WHAT?<br><br>Wellhung: I'm so Sorry. Really.<br><br>Sweetheart: I'm wiping your phlegm off of my breasts with the remains of my blouse.<br><br>Wellhung: I'm taking your sopping wet blouse from you and throwing it in the corner of the room.<br><br>Sweetheart: OK. I'm pulling your sweatpants down and rubbing your hard tool.<br><br>Wellhung: I'm screaming like a woman! Your hands are cold! Yeee!<br><br>Sweetheart: I'm pulling up my miniskirt.

But this one's a bit different. Hang with me for a second here.<br><br>There's a game called Game. It has no rules. Cool, huh!<br><br>Game has 4 players. They are called A, B, C, and D. (They had somewhat unimaginative parents, you see.)<br><br>A doesn't like Game because he doesn't know how many points he has or what level he is. He thinks the whole thing's kind of silly and logs off.<br><br>B starts walking and doesn't stop, intent on finding out if Game has any walls or features of any kind.<br><br>C tries to keep up with B and strike up a conversation.<br><br>D then logs in and kills both B and C. Game over.<br><br>The developers are a bit unhappy with the way Game went, so they make a new build of Game. This one has an island, on which there spawns 4 orcs.<br><br>B is disappointed because the island is so small.<br><br>A starts fighting the orcs.<br><br>C tries to console B about the island being so small.<br><br>D then logs in and kills A, B, and C. Game over.<br><br>The developers begin to see a pattern. Game v3.0 launches with (drumroll) a PK switch. (Oh, and another island.)<br><br>A keeps fighting the orcs, since they drop 30 quatloos every time they die.<br><br>C looks at the orcs. Hmm, green. She wonders if there's a good place on the island for a tavern.<br><br>B starts chopping down trees, so that he can build a boat to the other island.<br><br>D then logs in and finds out he can't kill anyone. WTF? He then starts calling C a slut and a whore, which makes her cry. He then kills the orcs really fast before A can. B tries to ignore D but D keeps tripping him every time he brings logs back from the trees for his boat.<br><br>The developers are not happy. No, not at all happy.<br><br>Game 3.5 comes out, with Game Master support 24/7.<br><br>The second C comes on, she reports D for harrassment. D then logs on and feigns ignorance, saying that his playstyle is sanctioned by Game since he could kill people in v1.0 and v2.0 and it was taken away from him with no compensation at all. GM E is kind of confused, since he just started yesterday, and asks A and B what's been going on. B just shrugs and keeps building his boat, but A confirms C's story (whether or not C is in fact telling the truth is irrelevant for purposes of this discussion). E puts D on a 24 hour ban. The next day D logs on with another account and makes C cry again.<br><br>The developers begin to drink heavily.<br><br>Game 4.0 is now out, with a special PvP-Enhanced Zone (the third island). Unfortunately, D is the only one in the zone, and he gets bored quickly with no one to kill. He swims over to the first island and uses Gamekill, a hack he downloaded from the Internet, to kill A, B, and C.<br><br>C writes to Game Monthly, saying that The Game Company has created a hellhole of festering cruelty that no sane person would ever want to experience.<br><br>B keeps plugging away, building his boat. <br><br>A is tired of killing orcs, and begins to really get pissed off with C's carping. He downloads Gamekill too, and kills her.<br><br>D is encouraged, and makes a guild website called "A-D" where they spend most of their time posting how much they want to kill that C bitch.<br><br>The developers are now quite drunk, and new development on Game has ceased.<br><br>B built his boat, and sailed off to the second island, where he was promptly ambushed by A and D and killed.<br><br>C joined Game's new Volunteer Program, and is now Special Operations Counselor in charge of Shard Affairs C. She informs A and D that their playstyle and exploiting will no longer be tolerated.<br><br>A and D post on their website that C probably slept with E to get her position. F divorces E.<br><br>B starts his own website, which consists mainly of maps of the three islands. <br><br>C spends most of her time IRC now, warning people about the dangerous places in Game and how to avoid them.<br><br>Meanwhile no one is actually playing Game. This bothers the developers when they sober up. Game 5.0 is hurried to market, with a shiny new box announcing 6 new islands and a great Army-level system designed to channel player aggressiveness. <br><br>A jumps onto the new island and gleefully slaughters the new monsters from a distance at no danger to himself. <br><br>B publishes his new guidebook, "You got Game?", with detailed maps of all the new islands.<br><br>C is on hand to greet new players, warning them to watch for D and other exploiters.<br><br>D is tired of being called an exploiter just because he wants to kill people. He feels oppressed and hemmed in by the game mechanics (maybe because he is). He holds a protest on Island 6 which A attends out of solidarity and C because she's reporting on it for GM E. GM E is fired shortly thereafter for selling maps of the islands to B for his new book and is not replaced.<br><br>The developers are despondent that the Army system they spent months developing is being completely ignored. Suddenly they are fired and a new dev team is hired.<br><br>Game 6.0 is released, with no rules.<br><br>A jumps on and he and B look for the new monsters.<br><br>C logs on with her player character to see if any of her friends are on.<br><br>D then logs in and kills A, B and C.

Submitted for your approval, this is what to look for in the coming months from the ORPG industry.<br><br><b><a href="http://www.shadowbane.com/">SHADOWBANE</a></b><br><br>Developed by Wolfpack Studios, publisher to be announced. An ORPG where you play to crush, not bake bread like those other sissies.<br><br>Still without a publisher (they were supposed to announce one last week), and a recent <a href="http://sb.drtwister.com/interviews/int-warden-induetime.shtml">interview</a> published by Dr. Twister's site made some wonder if the core game design wasn't still up for grabs (one week there's combat-related trade skills, the next week there isn't, one week it's a deep diplomatic/military sim, the next week its a fragfest of 0wnage). Then again, this could also just point out the fact that, for all the posting the dev team has done on various web boards, very little of the game design itself is actually known at this point. Still, this PvP-friendly ORPG has a rabid fan base and plenty of hype. <br><br>Assuming a publisher is found, Wolfpack is targeting an August 2000 release date. Both Windows and Macintosh versions are planned.<br><br><b><a href="http://www.anarchyonline.com/">ANARCHY ONLINE</a></b><br><br>Developed and published by Funcom. A persistent mission-based RPG set in the far future.<br><br>Anarchy Online is set 30,000 years in the future (not 30,004 or 29,998, 30,000) where a struggle between the evil Omni-Tek megacorp and the brave Rebel Alliance is set to determine the future of the next 30,000 years or so. AO is a 3D 1st person game, and those who have seen its engine rave about its detail and how it blows away everything else on the market. Of course, that engine hasn't actually supported thousands online in the same room yet, either. <br><br>AO's developers promise both a PvP element to the game (since players choose a "team" when creating a character) and a robust mission-based quest system. Looks pretty interesting and should appeal to a lot of folks who so far haven't been interested in medieval fantasy ORPGs.<br><br>Anarchy Online is planning Windows and Linux versions, and is set for a Fall 2000 release. <br><br><b><a href="http://www.uo2.com/">ULTIMA ONLINE 2</a></b><br><br>Developed and published by Origin Systems, a "Persistent State World", or complete world simulation akin to Ultima Online 1 set 200 years after the first game.<br><br>The UO2 dev team has been under a Cone of Silence ever since the game's announcement last year, which no doubt was embarassing when the only information the community could gleam of the game was from some <a href="http://www.spawn.com/toyfair2000/catalog/uo2.figures1.html">really bitchin' dolls</a>. Thankfully, we're beginning to see some information about the actual game as opposed to its auxilliary toy marketing schemes. We should know quite a bit more once PC Gamer is allowed to run their S00per Spec1al 3l33t 3xclusiv3 and the Cone of Silence is lifted a bit more.<br><br>UO2 will be a 3D 1st person/3rd person over-the-shoulder hybrid akin to Asheron's Call's default view, with 3 seperate player races representing the past, present and future of Britannia. (Pause while every "reputable" web site pretends to be discovering these details for the <a href="http://uo2.drtwister.com/">first time</a>.) As with the new UO:R expansion, instead of a PvP switch play styles will be segregated geographically. The skill system will be based loosely on Ultima Online's skill system, although far more tree-based implying that although there will be no player classes, specialized character archetypes will be possible. Player housing and a fully working in-game economy are also promised. The whole project is really quite ambitious (we've never seen player-placeable housing in a 3D ORPG environment yet, for example) and it'll be interesting to see how much of what's promised can be pulled off.<br><br>No official release date for UO2 has been announced; some press releases have mentioned Winter 2000.<br><br><b><a href="http://www.mythicentertainment.com/gamescamelot.html">DARK AGES OF CAMELOT</a></b><br><br>Developed by Mythic Entertainment. No publisher yet announced although Mythic has many games you've never heard of, such as "Godzilla Online" and "Starship Troopers Online" already on Kesmai and AOL.<br><br>Set shortly after King Arthur's death, players can be either the stalwart British, the wild Norseman, and the, um, Celtic Celts. These teams cannot attack one another but can band together and invade the other two. (A newbie area safe from all that sturm und drang is promised, as well.) Looks to be a fairly deep, combat heavy ORPG, although little is really known at this point aside from a few impressive screenshots and an exclusive relationship with the <a href="http://camelotvault.ign.com/">Vault Network</a>, which I guess means I can't talk about this game any more. Damn you all to hell!<br><br><b><a href="http://www.lucasarts.com/static/pr/star_wars_online.htm">STAR WARS ONLINE</a></b><br><br>Developed by LucasArts and Verant, published by Sony. You know, it's Star Wars!<br><br>Check the story published earlier today for what little details we have on this one. Slated for a 2001 release.<br><br><b><a href="http://www.artifact-entertainment.com/horizons/">HORIZONS</a></b><br><br>Developed and published by Artifact Entertainment. A fantasy ORPG that is not EQ, AC, or UO.<br><br>Horizons is most notable for its developer, David Allen, consistently breaking the "thou shalt not speak badly of thy competition" rule all other ORPG developers follow.<br><br><font color="#77FF77">Ok... we get a lot of questions about how is this going to be done, how is that going to be done. I'll give a little hint as to how we are going to be able to pull all of this off. We are not taking 2 years to build our engine, then try to slap a game to it in six months, then add another 25% to the world a year later in an expansion. Meanwhile consistently conclude our beta while players are paying for the game. <br><br>We are going to have some cool race unique weapons. NO TECH WEAPONS LIKE GUNS. We are not going to go down the same BORG MEETS ORC road that UO2 is.<br><br>Unlike EQ, AC, and UO, we do NOT have some bonehead company breathing down our neck telling us how to do things, forcing us to release before we're ready, or anything like that.<br><br>We actually plan on releasing an incomplete game, hoping that the players will beta test it for us (after paying a fee of course), while ignoring their requests, and boasting that we're the best thing on the market. Of course in the end, we won't change the game enough to reflect what people want, but will keep it as addictive as we can so we can get their money.</font><br><br>So, if Horizons tanks, it looks like we can probably find a spot for Mr. Allen here at LumCorp. But his views on other games aside, what exactly is Horizons? We're not sure, except it's a 3D 1st person fantasy ORPG that most definitely is not Everquest, Ultima Online or Asheron's Call. Other then that, I guess we'll find out in 2001.<br><br><b><a href="http://www.atriarch.com/">ATRIARCH</a></b><br><br>Developed and published by World Fusion. A, um, game.<br><br>Atriarch is an aggressively unique ORPG, set on an <a href="http://www.atriarch.com/worldofatriana/species/species.html">alien world</a> that's far more hard-sf than anything else on the market. Instead of media-friendly Wookies and Elves, you have Unarras and Cavalons. The world backdrop is pretty detailed already, and will either be its strongest selling point or its biggest turnoff, depending on how much effort you like to put in understanding what's going on around you.<br><br>Another unique feature of Atriarch is its generational character system. Instead of dying, becoming a ghost, and resurrecting at a helpful shrine or bind point, "dead is dead". Characters can instead "respawn", somewhat literally actually, as their offspring. (The whole reproductive process is asexual, which dodges a few fun issues nicely.)<br><br>One of Atriarch's strongest points in its favor would be Serafina Pechan, an, um, unique individual. We're lining up an interview with her so you can judge for yourself if the gaming industry is ready for her. Here's a brief quote from one of her design diaries posted on <a href="http://www.gamespy.com/articles/atriarch3_a.shtm">Gamespy</a> (Arc is just listed as "Arc, World Fusion's Chief Architect"):<br><br><font color="#77FF77">Serafina: Ya, real-time strategy. Players can fight in huge battles... <br><br>Arc: Hmm... <br><br>Serafina: And build up massive armies... <br><br>Arc: Uh... <br><br>Serafina:...and engage in war campaigns fighting for control of the empires. <br><br>Arc: Do you realize how large you're making this game? <br><br>Serafina: So?</font><br><br>Gotta love top-down management.

Multiple races will be fully and equally supported by government mandate and a new federal subsidy insituted for the benefit of newbies. The USA Online project will be developed by Verant, distributed and sold at retail by Sony and available for play exclusively online at The Station@sony.com (www.station.sony.com).<br><br>     The partnership brings together three of the foremost entities in the interactive entertainment industry. Verant, creator of EverQuest, the most successful massively multiplayer online game to date, is recognized as the leading creator of persistent gaming universes. EverQuest currently boasts more than 200,000 customers, 120,000 of whom play daily. Sony Online Entertainment produces and distributes online games and gameshows targeted to mainstream consumers and game enthusiasts, including EverQuest.<br><br>      "The combined expertise of Verant, Sony, and this Administration will bring to players an incredibly dynamic online experience worthy of our forefathers" says Bill Clinton, president of The United States. "The immensity and richness of the American culture lends itself ideally to a project of this nature. Hillary and I look forward to getting closer to every American in this new, exciting format."<br><br>     "USA Online" will be a phenomenon that transforms the online experience for all participants," says Lisa Simpson, president of Sony Online Entertainment. "It is a great addition to the blue chip brands our audience has come to enjoy at The Station. We are delighted to work with the United States and continue our close association with Verant Interactive."<br><br>     "We couldn't possibly ask for a better universe in which to create a massively multiplayer experience, " says John Smedley, president and CEO of Verant. "America offers such an incredible amount of depth and detail that we'll be able to create a place for fans to feel right at home. This project is going to be incredible!"<br><br>     "I look forward to excercising even greater control over our new partners in this exciting venture", says Brad McQuaid, Vice President of Verant and Producer of the new title. "I believe that Verant has demonstrated much needed leadership in the area of population management and I intend to continue this tradition by bringing order to the American states." Among the innovations planned for this release, McQuaid stated that "There will be strict adherence to our highly successful name policy. Violators who choose frivolous, non-American names will be given a warning and then banned after a second violation. And you can kiss goodbye obvious  exploits that have enabled some to get rich at the expense of others. We will be looking closely at any attempt to profit or to gain experience without appropriate levels of pain and frustration."<br><br>     When asked why the American government agreed to participate in the venture, President Clinton stated "We were intrigued and impressed with Verant's ability to exercise control over areas that, frankly, have eluded our congressional leadership. We were particularly impressed with their approach to crime. Rather than institutionalizing costly bureaucracies to handle morally bankrupt philosophies like "punishment" or "rehabilitation", Verant has come up with a surprisingly simple approach that prevents killing or stealing from taking place in the first place. This Administration has been asking for just this type of leadership for a long time, and now comes the opportunity".<br><br>     With the President's cooperation, Verant has announced a plan to amend the Constitution of the United States to conform to its standard EULA (End User License Agreement). Participants will click "I Agree" every morning when they rise or be given the option to leave the country. According to McQuaid, "User polls have consistenly demonstrated that most online users would vote against the Bill of Rights if offered the chance. We are here to give them what they deserve".<br><br>     About Verant<br><br>     Verant Interactive is an independent development studio that develops cutting-edge online games.

Some folks threatened to <a href="http://pagn.net/uoasia/">take Australia's shard away from them</a>. <br><br><font color="#77FF77">Ok A lot of you guys must be wondering why must they move the server here , instead of having new one . Main Issue are .<br>1 . A lot of Countries Don't have a straight connect to Australia . But Singapore do .<br>2 . Oceania (told by EA Singapore ) Only has 300 players in it.<br>3 . I will work closely with the lovely people in EA Singapore to make the server restart , and remove the database .(means Server start from Scratch , too bad for the Australians if that were to happen .<br>4 . I will get to work with GM's Closely =P</font><br><br>Well, damn, that explains it. Since Oceania only has 300 players on it (even though I'm pretty sure I was mailed this story more than 300 times) we should just move it to Singapore, and wipe the shard while we're at it, so Singapore-dude can be a GM. Sorry, mates!<br><br>Apparently the collective Australian players, whom we all remember as exceedingly charming and <b>polite</b> folks, reacted somewhat badly to this.<br><br><font color="#77FF77">Its very interesting to see the lvl of maturity OF SOME Aussies gamers, with non-constructive criticism, childish moronic behaviour, spewing of un-necessary vulgarity and acted like some 12 yr old PK!<br><br>We value constructive criticism and suggestions not pure F**K, SCREW U, motherf**ker mails especially from fellow gamers and fellow UO players that once i have cross path, chatted and venture together in the ole' UO Servers.<br><br>The petition is to bring local Servers into Singapore. So that player in the South-East Asia region will be having lass lag and can play in peace.<br><br>Singapore has awesome infrastructure in the region. We have bad ass fat pipes alsmost covering all over the regiona ACCEPT australia and vice-versa.<br><br>I have spoken to Ed Hogan and a few EA representatives about Hosting Oceania in singapore a good few months ago when it all started, but eventually the server goes to Australia. Thats good news for aussie playes. <br><br>NOW the local players here wanted their own server to called their owned. Our own world and our own town. By not moving Oceania or anything, we just want our OWN SERVER.<br><br>Its up to EA or Origin decision to either move Oceania over to Singapore or give us a spanking brand new servers.</font><br><br>Yes, those are the <b>only two choices Origin has.</b> I guess the "play with insanely high ping times for two years until you wear down Origin into submission with an endless stream of petitions" option wasn't available.<br><br>Finally, light was shined into eyes or something, because we see this update:<br><br><font color="#77FF77">We have decided to petition for our own shard , and not move Oceania , as Oceania Serves New Zealanders and other small island around the region. And Thus , We are deciding to Petition For Temasek ! Thats what we hope to call it .<br><br>Sorry For the Misunderstanding to all Australians . And I also hope that you Mates will Support Us !</font><br><br>Well, as we all know, small islands (like, say, Singapore) must be supported at all costs. Never mind the somewhat large island called "Australia". In fact, let's just look at the figures involved, shall we:<br><br><b>Austraila</b>: 19 million people<br><b>Singapore</b>: 3.5 million people<br><br><b>Australia</b>: Thriving Western democracy that has really gotten over the whole oppressing-the-aborigines thing, honest!<br><b>Singapore</b>: Evil <a href="http://www.gov.sg/">Eastern city-state</a> tyranny that <a href="http://www.state.gov/www/global/human_rights/1999_hrp_report/singapor.html">outlaws the importation of chewing gum and swearing</a>.<br><br><b>Australia</b>: Speaks English! Always a plus among us dumb Americans who can't be bothered to learn other languages. Hell, some of us never even learn English and just communicate via grunting and hand gestures.<br><b>Singapore</b>: Well, they speak English too. But they also speak Chinese, which obviously makes this a <b>COMMUNIST PLOT</b>. I suspect Li Peng is involved. Note that Taiwan has a UO server. <b>This is not a coincidence.</b><br><br><b>Australia</b>: Mel Gibson, who really impresses my wife. A lot.<br><b>Singapore</b>: <a href="http://www.geocities.com/TelevisionCity/Network/7421/ccmgal.htm">Chew Chor Meng</a>. "Personally, I feel that Chor Meng can't act that well. Perhaps his cheeky, witty and cheerful image is too deep seated within me." This is from his <b>fan site</b> for god's sake. If we don't watch these folks they're likely to reconstruct N'Sync from spare parts.<br><br><b>Australia</b>: <a href="http://www.deadheart.org.uk/">Midnight Oil</a>. Loud bald leftists always impress me. However, Australia is also responsible for <a href="http://www.kylie.co.uk/">Kylie Minogue</a>, so it's pretty much a tossup here. Plus both of these websites are actually in the UK. What's up with that? Doesn't Australia have any web servers? Oh, they were all moved to Singapore.<br><b>Singapore</b>: <a href="http://www.mnemonicgroove.com/">Mnemonic Groove</a>. They have an mp3 online in case you stupid Americans that can't even speak English never heard of them, so you can grunt for it the next time you're in an record store. "It's no wonder they can already rub shoulders with bands like Hootie & the Blowfish and Edwin McCain or even get themselves through the gates of the Playboy Mansion." Damn, I'm impressed.<br><br>So I think the record here states clearly that <b>all future UO shards should be placed in a real country. Like, say, America.</b> You know, we did technically invent UO. If we're going to start moving shards, just bring the boys back home. If you agree, be sure to communicate your wishes to your nearest Congressperson using grunting and hand gestures.

Believe it or not, we actually have more information about Verant's new Star Wars Online than UO2 now, thanks to an article published in <a href="http://www.usatoday.com/life/cyber/tech/review/games/cgg155.htm">USA Today</a>. Here's the salient points:<br><br>* Contrary to everyone's worst fears, SW Online will <b>not</b> be part of the "Episode One" franchise, but will be set just before the first/fourth movie (the counting scheme depends on how obsessive a fanboy you are). Of course, this also means that you can't camp the Gungan spawn, which would provide endless joy for all. <br><br>* The game will launch with Tatooine and another, unnamed planet and approximately 100 zones total. Players cannot play the roles of "name" characters (which means no Jedi Knights or Dark Jedi, since at the time given for the game there was only one of each) but play "bounty hunters, rebel soldiers, mercenaries, and courtesans" (!) in such locales as Mos Eisley Spaceport. Knowing ORPG players, this will give an entirely new meaning to "a wretched hive of scum and villany." <br><br>* The article implies, although doesn't outright state, that SWO will be based heavily on the Everquest "<a href="http://www.dikumud.com/">feelin' like a Diku!</a>" game system (note the reference to zones, for example). On the other hand, John Smedley emailed the scarily-already-up-and-running <a href="http://swvault.ign.com/">Star Wars Vault</a> with the following: <br><br><font color="#77FF77">Second, don't read anything into words like "zones". We've been working on some truly awesome next-generation technology here at Verant, so terms like "zones" will really end up meaning vastly different things then they have in EverQuest.</font><br><br>(In a related development, <a href="http://www.uo.com/">Sunsword</a> was last spotted repeating "It's not a mirror" over and over into something very much like a mirror.)<br><br>We'll cover as much Star Wars Online news as we can before we finally say the hell with it and get back to arguing about stat loss in UO.<br><br><b><a href="http://lum.xrgaming.net/ubb/Forum2/HTML/000171.html">Search your feelings, you know it to be true...</a></b><br></font></td></tr></table><br clear=left><br><a name="newsitem953403239,89887,"></a>

Over on the <a href="http://boards.xrgaming.net/cgi/uo2/devboard.cgi?view">Crossroads UO2 development board</a> Ubiq (the lead designer for UO2) and Cynthe (the OCRAP lady for UO2 -- think Calandryll in drag) have developed the <a href="http://uo2.xrgaming.net/">the question of the week</a>.  This is where they ask you, the gamer who hopefully has a clue, a question about what you would like to see in some facet or another of game design.  Then they either incorporate the ideas or they don't -- no promises.  But still its nice to be asked.<br><br><a href="http://boards.xrgaming.net/uo2/devboard/messages/3393.html">This week's question</a> is about monster AI.  "...[Y]ou see a slime/party of orcs/lich/pirate, you draw your sword, you walk stealthily towards them.... what happens next?"  Well this question has got me to thinking about monsters, monster AI, and mostly monster-driven economies, which we are all used to thinking about as separate things but I don't think they are. <br><br>As I walked around Yew this morning trying to kill, but doing more running away from, the mondo-spawn and enjoying my burst hour I was attacked, as we all are these days, by a few thousand mongbats.  Those things are worse than cockroaches and you know they all have about 12 gold on them. They must be marsupials.  Either that or I'm hacking them apart and pulling gold out of their innards, which is a little too grizly for me to get into.  It leads me to thinking about what I must have to do to get those magic weapons out of the terathans.<br><br>Now I'm not asking for realism here.  I'm dressing up in steel armor and fighting orcs, ettins, gargoyles and casting magic and making a pretty decent living at it to boot.  I think we can all agree that this isn't real.  But an economy driven by phat l3wt off monsters is... well... strange.  To say the least. <br><br>We're all used to monsters without much of a clue wandering around and having l3wt -- phat or otherwise -- on them.    Sometimes I think a more interesting reward might be some sort of a title and a damange bonus -- you know you kill 100 orcs you get the title Orcsbane and 20% damage bonus against orcs.  Not such a nifty thing for orcs but when you think of dragons the reward is a bit more substantial.  Of course this doesn't work as long as one can stand on a ledge and throw purple llamas at dragons.<br><br>Then there's the Fraternal Order of Monsters -- at least that's what I look at it as.  They don't attack each other -- only us.  Why zombies have signed a pact of nonagression with giant spiders who have a pact of non agression with ogres, etc. is beyond me but here we have it -- or at least we appear to have it.  The little animals of the woodlands have signed a similar non-agression pact with each other.  I have this vision of Bambi and Godzilla making paw-prints on a piece of parchment covered with indecipherable script.  But really I know when UO first came out I thought it was pretty cool that wolves and grizzlies would attack adventurer's and other animals.  That sort of fell by the wayside somewhere along the way though.<br><br>I know it sort of sounds like I'm calling for smarter (definitely) and more realistic (heh -- whats that) monsters, but in reality I think I'd like more logical monsters.  And I'd like to see a game that sort of breaks out of this mold of wandering monsters that ignore each other, attack players, and have lewt.  So anyway what do you folks think?

This expansive network will provide AboveNet customers with exceptionally fast and reliable connectivity to the Internet.

Roleplaying.  What is it?  Is it pking as many people as you can in the name of some evil power you've made up?  Is it sitting in your house <a href="http://www.kaaos.com/hedron/newstuff/rpsnobs.htm">baking bread</a>?  Is it speaking in<a href="http://www.renfaire.com/Language/insults.html">Elizabethan</a> <a href="http://www.renfaire.com/Language/index.html">English?</a> Is it the forces of good over evil?  Exactly what is this thing called roleplaying?  How do you define it?  Is it one of those things you just know when you see it?  And why am I asking all these questions of you now anyway?  Can't I see you've had a hard day at work, have a headache and don't really want to have a real discussion about this?<br><br>Well I don't care that you've had a hard day at work because <a href="http://lum.xrgaming.net/ubb/Forum1/HTML/002625.html">I'm</a> <a href="http://www.evil.com/welcome.html">evil</a> muhahahahaha.  Sorry, got carried away there for a moment.  Actually what brought this about was <a href="http://cos.xrgaming.net/library/interviews/balseraph03032000.shtml">some development guy</a> discussing Darth Vader in his <a href="http://cos.xrgaming.net/apocrypha">new colum</a> and the <a href="http://boards.xrgaming.net/cos/apocrypha/messages/70.html">responses</a> to it on both the <a href="http://cos.xrgaming.net">COS</a> boards and <a href="http://lum.xrgaming.net/ubb/Forum1/HTML/002601.html">our board</a>.<br><br>I, myself, am a little unsure of what roleplay is at times.  I know I'm classified as a roleplayer by the majority of folks out there.  When I met the ShadowClan Orcs on conversational grounds at Destiny's party, I interacted with them as if they were really orcs -- I think.  I mean if it was really an orc I suppose I would have pulled out my bow and tried to shoot it -- not asked it for an ale in a clean glass, if you please.  And wouldn't they have tried to shoot me?  Does speaking in Orcish constitute roleplaying?<br><br>I know when I'm not roleplaying.  When I'm out hunting stuff for skill.  Yet if I run into someone that wants to roleplay I'll usually play along ("Stop right there! Your money or you life!" "Eeek! Please, no, don't harm me Sir!  I am but a poor peasant girl on the way to the market to fetch eggs for my father's supper.  Have pity on a poor peasant."  "Die biatch! Corp por" -- ok so hopefully it ends better than that -- even in UO).  I think I know when someone else is not roleplaying ("r u a grl in rl"?).  I also have the most fun in UO when I'm interacting with others in a some manner that suggests a 'role' that doesn't get overly excessive.  I once had a roleplayer tell me I couldn't do this: :)  in the game because it wasn't 'roleplaying.'  He insisted I use *smiles*  -- I don't know this person anymore.  Nor do I think using official emoting makes one a better roleplayer than one who uses time worn symbolism to do the same thing.<br><br>But with all this talk about what roleplay is and is not, I wonder -- can we define it?  Or is it something like the Congressman said about pornography: "I don't know what it is but I know it when I see it."  Which, of course, would mean rather that one man's roleplaying is another man's kewl dood.  And, with <a href="http://www.shadowbane.com">Shadowbane</a> backing off its "I play games to crush" statement and telling us that it will be the greatest thing since sliced bread for roleplayers, (to be fair, -- they always did.  Look for the 'Feature Characters' section in the many FAQs) it seems that everyone now wants to be a roleplayer.  Indeed, in reading all the boards recently I feel like I'm in the middle of Roleplayers 'R Us.  People roleplay mass murderers, bakers, elves, carebears, orcs, angels both rising and falling, evil incarnate, good incarnate, captured princesses, heroes both rising and falling, bread both rising and falling -- oops sorry.  No, no one is rping bread I just got carried away.  <br><br>I know this article is link-heavy but please do take the time to check them out.  I think that the majority of these links are relevant to the discussion -- especially the different boards and threads I linked to.<br><br><b><a href="http://lum.xrgaming.net/ubb/Forum2/HTML/000165.html">So lets discuss it.

Why are you doing this? <br><br><b>Later that afternoon . . . . . . . . . . . .</b><br><br>Calandryll posted this on our board:<br><br><FONT color="#77FF77">Let me try this from a different angle. It is a bug, nobody will argue that (actually, you can't, hehe). The moment we say "it's ok to use this bug because it does not hurt anyone" is the moment we create a major gray area...a gray area that DID exist in UO's past and one we never wish to return. Now, what happens if we say its ok to use it, then someone DOES figure out a way to harm other players with it (which as I said above, they already have). Suddenly we are forced to retract our original statement or worse, start putting in clauses for when it is ok to use this bug and when it is not. I hope you can see where I am going with this. <br><br>Keeping things as black and white as possible not only makes things more clear for the players, but also keeps things more clear for us. Using bugs in UO is not permitted.<br><br>Again, as I said above, we have talked about porch lockdowns as a feature, but nothing is planned yet. If/when (and please not[e] the "if") we did, then by all means you could lock down items on your porch. But allowing players to use a bug and circumvent a system to do things they should not be to do, under the assumption that it does not harm anyone (and again as I said, players can use this to harm people), would be rather irresponsible on our part.</font><br><br>Well said, Cal and good points.  I still think a better solution should have been to see that something was very popular and take steps to integrate it -- rather than saying "its a bug -- stop using it."  And yes, I do realize you have to take a hard line stance when it comes to bugs.  Lets hope the development team brings back this very popular 'feature' sometime in the near future.<br><br><a href="http://lum.xrgaming.net/ubb/Forum2/HTML/000161.html"<b>Bring back porch lockdowns biatch!</b></a><br><br><br></font></td></tr></table><br clear=left><br><a name="newsitem953149113,65743,"></a>

OK, we've bashed on the PK quite a bit here at LumCorp. I think we've proven to everyone's satisfaction, using samplings of current opinion, polls, messages from the Dread Days, Powerpoint presentations, and dwarf goat sacrifices, that unrestricted PKing is bad, and just getting rid of stat loss is worse. Now for the other side of the coin.<br><br>Player-killing is currently at an <b>ideal level</b> for the game's success. While it is <b>possible</b> for someone to be killed when in a "danger zone" (outside of town, currently), it is <b>unlikely</b>, since stat loss has kept being Red as the domain of the truly dedicated.<br><br>However, the just implemented skill system changes <b>cripple the Red</b>. It will be nearly impossible to recover from stat loss. As Alice Cooper of <a href="http://members.aol.com/mephjdd/news.html">J-D</a> on Chesapeake put it, <br><br><font color="#77FF77">So as you can see, you cannot gain skills or stats if you are inside a house, standing in one spot, or using the same animals over and over again. The ONLY way to gain skills/stats now is to actively play the game. For a stat loss red this is almost impossible. Are there any bugs, tricks or loopholes? I don't know yet. If we can locate large enclosed areas of land (between blocked off houses) maybe we can work on some skills there safely. But as it stands now, once your stat loss reds dies once or twice, the party is over...<br><br>...we will attempt to adapt to the changes, but if it becomes impossible to PK i'm sure many of us will quit UO. I personally will continue to PK on Chesapeake no matter what happens, and I hope that most of J-D will also. Even if it comes down to us running around with no skills or stats, and having to use scrolls, potions - whatever, we will continue to PK the best we can.</font><br><br>J-D has always been the sort of PKs that are <b>needed</b> in UO. They do not harass players. They do not go after miners or lumberjacks. They go where the skilled players are, like dungeons, or Trinsic during the recent event, and hang on to the territory as long as they can, taking on all comers. In fact, until now they've been <b>supporters</b> of stat loss - they understand that PKers have to be rare and with a risk to the PK. When they stand up and say, "It's time for a change", I listen. You should, as well.<br><br>The reason stat loss has worked up until this point is that it is actually thinkable to recover from, yet not so trivial as to be meaningless as a penalty. The UO:R changes escalate the stat loss penalty to <b>make recovery unthinkable</b>. If you see a red fighting a grizzly bear or some such, well you pretty much have a neon light over his head saying "Kill me and destroy my character even further!"<br><br>While revenge is always fun against the sort of dorks who've made life miserable for most of UO the past three years, the fact is that <b>very few grief players are Red</b> now. They're the noto-PKs, the bank theives, the blockers and looters. They'll adapt again once UO:R comes out, like any other fungus. We're not talking about them right now. We're talking about the small, very small minority of stat loss reds who are playing the game the right way. They want to continue to. For whatever reason, the factions aren't for them. Again, not today's topic (and I'm about as hardcore a faction booster as you can get and not actually have a cubicle inside Origin). What can we do to preserve the stat loss red?<br><br>There's an interesting proposal bouncing around Vortexland called "Angel Island" that is <a href="http://www.adamant.uoguilds.com/000326.html">worth a look</a>. With some modifications, this can be an alternate solution.<br><br>First, for this sort of thing to be implemented, the ambitiousness needs to be ramped downward. There aren't that many stat loss reds, and Origin isn't going to devote resources to designing UO:R version 2 for them. Any proposal that works needs to be accomplished with as little coding as possible. This sort of elegance also keeps possible exploits to a minimum. (Reds? Exploiters? Say it isn't so!)<br><br>However, <b>I like the concept.</b> The idea of stat loss is to take the offending character out of circulation for a not inconsequential period, whether through waiting out the red count as a ghost or taking the stat loss and rebuilding the character. The initial problem with this is that the waiting process isn't very fun for the waiting person; although it is a consequence of the player's actions, the fact is that player is paying $10.00 a month for the privilege of suffering punishment. The current problem, of course, is that with the ever escalating antimacro jihad, waiting out stat loss is no longer a solution. Origin's response, to work off the counts during regular play, isn't an option, unless you <b>like</b> dying to waves of opportunistic notoPKs for some reason. <br><br>So let's work this idea some. First off, we don't need a new island -- we already have one. It's called Buccaneer's Den. It's already a "Red Town", complete with a bank.<br><br>Now, we know that the tech exists within the UO code to disable recalls and gates in a given area (try recalling to a bank some time). So we can shut down recalls and gates within Buc's. You would also have to disable access to boats for offending characters. Once you do that -- well, there really is <a href="http://images.amazon.com/images/P/6305173966.01.LZZZZZZZ.gif">No Escape</a>. Buc's Den is a pretty big place. There's no guards - but there's a bank, NPC vendors, and even a set of underground tunnels. Lots of room to play out your own personal Lord of the Flies.<br><br>So here's the deal. You die as a murderer - you don't die. You are <b>CAPTURED</b>. You are dumped in the middle of Buc's Den, naked. You have a sentence, based on your murder count. You stay there until it's worked off. (Online, not off... no sense in just allowing you to switch to working your mule until your sentence is over, is there?)<br><br>Now there's nothing stopping you from hitting your bank box, or from others to meet up with you and equip you. But you aren't going anywhere. And there's lots of folks who probably have a few bones to pick with you. And I'm sure antiPK guilds would love to have some scores to settle. And if you're a kewldewd, hell, most of the inmates will probably start to kill you over and over on principle alone.<br><br>Something even cooler... just disable recalls and gates ENTIRELY within Bucs Den. All access via boat (which remember, the inmates can't access). So if those Antis want to raid Bucs? They do it the old fashioned way. Storm the boats!<br><br>Now see? You take the PKs off the streets, and create another dimension to the game, and have some fun in the process. <br><br><b><a href="http://lum.xrgaming.net/ubb/Forum2/HTML/000160.html">Fun is good.

<b>From the office of Marginally related news too strange to ignore:</b><br>Leading Internet Scientist predicts end of mankind within 2 generations.<br><br>Sometime today, Wired magazine is supposed to release the 24 page article by Bill Joy, co-founder of Sun Microsystems, in which he predicts the <a href="http://www.stud.ifi.uio.no/~haakonhj/Terminator/index.cgi">downfall of the human age at the hands of "advanced technology".</a><br><br>This doomsday prediction is not unique to Bill Joy. He shares this viewpoint with other far-seeing minds such as <a href="http://www.redacted.com/manifest.txt">Theodore Kaczynski</a>, <a href="http://religioustolerance.org/dc_jones.htm">The Reverend Jim Jones</a>, and <a href="http://www5.zdnet.com/yil/higher/heavensgate/">all the members of Heaven's Gate</a>. Together, these people warn us that technology is a tool, and like any tool man has created - will ultimately be used for mankind's destruction.<br><br>What is it that *really* scared Mr. Joy?<br>The same thing that nearly killed Captain Picard, Riker, Geordie, and yes, even Data - the <a href="http://www.shadowcove.com/arcadian/pitifavd.wav">Nanites</a>. Tiny, microscopic sentient machines who operate at the cellular level, performing tasks and routines assigned to them by their manufacturers, like the <a href="http://www.shadowcove.com/arcadian/borguser.wav">Borg</a> for example. It was once thought that the Borg inducted new candidates by means of welding and grafting <a href="http://www.uo2.com/images/warrior.jpg">UO2 style equipment</a> to the human form, but recent discoveries (i.e. Season Seven of Next Generation) revealed that The Borg do, in fact, use Nanite technology to transmorph inductees at the cellular level. Bill Joy calls it <font color="FF77F">"...a replication attack in the physical world."</font> He also equates this potential for destruction to the rampant infestation of swamps by mosquitoes. To paraphrase, <i>"There's so many of them!! Get them off me!!! Get them off!!!! Auuuggghh!!"</i><br><br>When asked what we can do to save humanity, Bill Joy replied, <font color="FF77FF">"Sun Microsystems has always struggled with being an ethical innovator."</font><br>Note to self: When Sun deploys SkyNet, get a woman, a boy, and an engineer to help me stop them.<br><br><b><a href="http://lum.xrgaming.net/ubb/Forum2/HTML/000158.html">Talk with me if you want to live</a></b><br></font></td></tr></table><br clear=left><br><a name="newsitem952991987,28401,"></a>

It's official - Origin wants you to be a dex monkey. The changes to the skill system allow S00perFlyFast increases to melee skills, tactics, and stats, while anything else that takes actual thought (like, say, Magery) is stuck around 80. Which, not coincidentally, is a good level of Magery for a dexer. <br><br>Now, that's not all! In addition to skill gain fast enough for you to qualify as a <a href="http://www.geocities.com/Area51/Underworld/1888/main.html">Bob</a>, you get valuable prizes! You can do double damage, s00per-paralyze your opponents, cause them to lose mana, hell, pretty much you get a certificate written out in your character's name, that says "I can r0x mages". You can just show it to prospective opponents, and they'll drop dead. Trust us, it saves time.<br><br>Now, I'm not one of those absolutists that think that my character is somehow devauled since I had to macro for three months to get my guy up to fighting trim and these newbies don't have to. The less time spent being a newbie the better. Still, one wonders how much a deterrent stat loss really is, considering how quickly skills can be gained on a new character. Die, delete char, make new one. Now ALL Pks can be Bobs!<br><br>I'm fairly confident Origin is seeing the massive havoc wreaked on the skill curve and will make it once again insanely difficult to gain .01 anatomy at some point in the future, so make your dexer now!

Excellent article posted on Gamasutra: <a href="http://www.gamasutra.com/features/20000309/mihaly_01.htm">Constructive Politics in a Massively Multiplayer Online Roleplaying Game</a>. This has always been a subject near and dear to my heart; once you get to 7x GM/Level 50 the REAL game begins.<br><br><font color="#77FF77">The first and most important thing that you must consider when creating a political system is that it must have meaning. It's not enough to, for instance, set up an electoral system and create some offices to be run for. If the system has no meaning to the player-citizens, then any power that officeholders have over the citizens will serve no purpose except irritating and angering the citizens. You must create perceived benefit for the player-citizens.</font><br><br>And again, in a note that will carry some weight for those playing UO:<br><br><font color="#77FF77">There are really two emotions that we want to arouse in the players to accomplish the goal of comradeship: fear and the elation that comes from overcoming challenges. It's important to understand that by fear I don't simply mean the fear one feels when one looks out ones window in the morning to see Mongol hordes thundering towards that lovely little picket fence in your front yard that you spent last weekend painting. I also mean the fear of humiliation; the fear that comes when your hated rival bests you at something you both care about. <br><br>The most obvious way to create this sort of unifying threat, which has numerous real-life parallels, is hostile foreign militaries. Creating a military system for your statist governments is a topic too complicated to go into here, but suffice to say that as long as your military system has potentially real negative effects for the citizenry of the victim political organization, and provided that the victim citizenry doesn't feel totally powerless to combat the threat, and further provided that there are perceived positive benefits to being a citizen (public services, etc), external threats can be a fantastic way to gel a citizen base into a viable sub-community within your MMORPG. Fear is a powerful motivator. This fear can be useful, even when the object of the fear triumphs. Providing that a certain hope of eventual success remains among the citizenry, the siege mentality that can come from being beaten can really bind people together. </font><br><br>I hope all you Ultima Online and Shadowbane developers are taking copious notes. There WILL be a test later. Tune in later, when I present an objective implementation of the ideas presented in this thesis. I like to call it "Ultima Online Faction System 2.0".<br><br><b><a href="http://lum.xrgaming.net/ubb/Forum2/HTML/000155.html">The politics of dancing... the politics of oooooh, feeling good!"</b></a><br></font></td></tr></table><br clear=left><br><a name="newsitem952969129,47702,"></a>

The masses have spoken, and they want MORE GAMING NEWS! LESS UPDATES ABOUT UPDATES! LESS SEXISM! MORE BREASTS!<br><br>Well, no breasts here (I'm at work, thus surfing them up would be, um problematic) but let's try some gaming news. Specifically, let's bash Verant again. It's fun and easy, much like beating up on the neighborhood gimp. You know it's wrong, somewhere vaguely in the back of your head where your conscience fell out back in 1987, but you keep doing it. Well, I do, anyway.<br><br>Rogues are not happy in Everquest. This is because other players have <a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/024997.html">finally figured out</a> that rogues, being thieves, steal things. Specifically, rogues have a skill, called Pick Pockets, that steals cash from a monster. When the skill went in, it used to steal cash and items from a seperate pool than the loot dropped by a monster in combat (sensibly enough, since if the rogue actually stole from party members, that would cause even more alienation then trying to play one of the most gimped-up classes in EQ). However this lead to such weirdness as rogues filching heads and hearts of still-breathing monsters and then being able to turn them in for valuable prizes.<br><br>Verant recognized that someone was actually playing the game contrary to the <a href="http://eq.castersrealm.com/viewarticle.asp?Article=917">One True Holy and Apostolic Vision</a> and nerfed Pick Pockets. Henceforth the loot rogues gained from Pick Pockets would come from the party's loot pool. Verant's answer to the quite natural reaction this caused was "well, you should, you know, <a href="http://eq.castersrealm.com/viewarticle.asp?Article=942">trust your rogue</a>. Oh, and I thought you said money in EQ was worthless anyway!". <br><br>So, we have a class that depends completely on the kindness of strangers for its advancement. But that's OK, because Verant knows what's best for you, since, as Brad McQuaid so elegantly worded it in the interview that set my wife off for an entirely different reason:<br><br><font color=#77FF77">...people who play 8 hours a day for months, earn a 50th level character, and then email me about how EQ sucks and the design is horrible...</font><br><br>You see, it's not just the women he looks down on.

I was going to post this on the thread in response to LOH's update about female wood elves in EQ.  Then, as I began to write it, I started to wonder if there was even half a brain among the lot of you.  I mean there are some people who actually made well thought out responses to that thread, both for and against.  It is not required that you agree with LOH in order for me to consider you intelligent.  But some of the responses to that article make me wonder if some of you even have enough brain power to actually be stupid -- much less intelligent.  Anyway I thought I would post this out here and see what kind of responses <i>I</i> got.  Although with what I'm expecting I am not sure if my psyche can handle the blow when I find out what the readership of this site is actually made of.  <br><br>Have I insulted you folks enough yet?  No?  Well read on.<br><br>You know I've read so much shit about women, seen so many insults, heard women cast down and objectified and put down simply because they were women -- both in game and in gaming forums.  Some actual quotes from in games and on boards:<br><br>"Come here baby I want to make you my bitch"<br><br>"Shut your cunt hole bitch unless I tell you you can open it"<br><br>"Do you really bake bread in real life? If you do I want to make you my bitch"<br><br>This is just a small random sampling off the top of my head.  If I went back and took the things off the LOH thread alone I could write a novel.  This stuff is said and thought regardless of whether or not LOH actually has the temerity to express an opinion on the appearance of woodelves or if I have the gall to have a little fun with the SB folks and ask for equal time in the way of an inccubus (which btw is all I ever wrote about -- that some of you took it the wrong way is your own goddam problem).  Yet none of you seem to have a problem with that.  Caramon Fey can say one of the things above (yeap he did -- and I actually think highly of Caramon -- but the statement shows a little insensitivity) and none of you say a word.  But good god let LOH call you a pig and you get ALL bent out of shape.  What the fuck?  Are you really that insecure?  Did it really hurt that much?<br><br>I find it surprising that otherwise thinking humans (I'm giving some folks the benefit of the doubt here) come up with these asinine insults (and I use that term loosely) that they must pull out of their collective and individual asses (i.e. looks like shit, smells like shit, must be shit).  <br><br>Where do you get off saying Lum is doing this for hits?  Are you nuts?  What did you think happened here?  Lum and LOH got together one night and said "Gee honey, the site's hits are a little low this month -- why don't you write a feminist piece about wood elves and we'll see how many of those rabid idiot men that read my site you can anger into irrational responses."  Now I would be busting a gut right now if they actually did that and you losers were actually that predictable.  That would just be funny as hell.  But come on now.  Be real.  Did the thought that LOH just might have her own opinion and the freedom to express it never cross your mind?  What is it you think Lum should do -- keep his wife on a leash?  Gag her?  Chop off her hands in an attempt to keep her away from the keyboard?  Is this really your opinion of women?  If so, LOH probably has a point, y'know?<br><br>I'm sure we are all aware that women in various other countries are oppressed more fully than artists who are forced to draw sexy, half naked wood elves to jack up purchases for the company they work for.  If you would like, I'd be happy to write up a piece on female circumcision in parts of Africa or even the terrible plight of females in Afghanistan.  Just one question though.  When was it you got the idea that this was a mainstream news site reporting on world events?  I was just curious because you know it really had never occurred to me that this site was equal with, oh say, www.cnn.com.  I'm happy you give us those sort of credentials.  Perhaps I should stop working as a sys admin and try for a job as a reporter.  Whaddaya think?  <br><br>Then there are those of you who are upset because LOH has written before on this subject.  Well excuse the fuck out of her.  How many updates have I written about UO?  How many has Lum?  Many more both singularly and together than LOH has written about female wood elves in EQ.  Not that quantity matters or anything -- as has been said before -- if you don't like it, don't read it.  But its hurled around on this thread like its the ultimate insult.  Huh?  You can't do better than that?  I fear for our readership.<br><br>Last but not least we have the fat and ugly insults.  Geesh guys -- I'm sure we are all crushed when some idiot we don't know who doesn't write particularly well posts on our message board that we must have written a particular update because we are either fat, ugly, or a lesbian.  This isn't confined to gender issues, btw.  Every goddam time I post an update someone writes Lum and tells him he should let that fat, ugly bitch write on his site.  You know I could probably write an update about how all men are gods and that my wildest fantasy is to stay at home all day fucking and sucking and baking bread for one and someone would write Lum and say he shouldn't let that fat ugly bitch write updates.   Oh yeah man, I'm wounded.  Cut to the core.  I'm sure LOH and Lietgardis are as well.  <br><br>You people need to go somewhere and purchase some better insults if this is the best you can do.  I'm serious.  I've seen some AWESOME flame wars in my time.  This thread wasn't one of them.  So what the hell is going on here?  Not only can you not discuss something intelligently but you can't even pop forth with something better than: yer fat, ugly, stupid, this isn't real news and you only did it for hits.  Oh yeah and we aren't pigs.  Actually you are right.  You aren't pigs.  Calling you pigs would be an insult to pigs everywhere.  Pigs are actually pretty intelligent animals -- among the most intelligent as a matter of fact.  I'm going to start another thread.

From the gurus at GameSpot comes a quote that made me chuckle, and even may explain why UO had such a difficult time in those early days of it's release:<br><br><font color="FF77FF">"Origin had stumbled onto the success of Ultima Online. It was not planned. UO was forecast at 15,000 subscribers and two shards. I think those numbers are ten times greater, still, two years later. It makes about $1.5 million a month."</font><br><br>The quote is attributed to "a former Origin Employee." Unfortunately for some of my detractors, unless you provide legal name, date of birth, blood type, and mailing address of anyone you quote, it is filed under "L" for Lie.<br><br>But looking past that, the quote is very revealing in that it just might explain a great deal about the history of Ultima Online, and even some of the problems that linger to this day. Why is in-game support handled by hundreds of "unpaid" volunteers? Why was UO so darned lagged and unstable in it's first year? Why do animals line up with "kill me" signs at the server lines?<br><br>Maybe - just maybe - OSI was totally and completely unprepared for the massive army of customers that swamped them. The forecast had called for rising waters and what they got was a tsunami.<br><br>Picture it this way: You work in an office as a hardware technician. Your boss informs you that 2 new employees will start on Monday. So you configure two computers and two telephone lines for them. Monday comes, and you learn that there was a typo in the memorandum. Not two new employees, but <b>two hundred</b> new employees. In such a situation, any solution that managed to get all two hundred of them working and productive that same day would be looked upon as a miracle.

OK, OK, OK, OK. I think the reason the faction system proposal hasn't really taken off in UO is that it's still wedded to the incredibly lame as hell in-game fiction for UO, which even BNN is pretty much ignoring now. So I've redone the factions so that they more properly reflect the balance of power in UO. You can thank me later.<br><br><b>THE MERRY MEN OF MOONGLOW</b>: These good folk would like nothing more then to be left alone, peacefully emoting *Jerrold Darkeye thoughtfully strokes his chin* at each other in an unbelievably arcane soap opera that four people understand. As pretty much everyone in the Moonglow faction will move to Happyland, this will make their taking part in the faction warfare system difficult, although since most Moonglow'ers have a total skill count of 350 or so, 100 of which is Cooking and 50 of which is Forensic Evaluation, they were probably never really in the top tier of combatants anyway. However, since most Moonglow players also have a Counselor, Seer or Elder character anyway, the point is really kind of moot.<br><br><b>KICKIN' YO' ASS ALL DA WAY TO OCCLO, FOOL</b>: Numbers are on this faction's side. Also, they can pretty much count on every character on the shard named "Mule". However, even though every Occlovian has GM Swords, GM Parry, GM Magery, GM Resist, GM Healing, GM Anatomy and  GM Tactics, they have been crippled ever since the monsters were given AI. You can usually see 3 or 4 Occlovians now running screaming from an ogre, yelling "no fair dude they go round rocks now".<br><br><b>CROSSROADS OF BRITAIN</B>: This faction consists of people who have played since Day 3 of the Alpha (when the first UO shard was actually still running on Richard Garriott's Palm Pilot) and who know literally everything about how UO is managed and have no problem whatsoever telling you how it should be improved, over and over again. Although these are some of the most skilled players in UO, they are inherently crippled by being too busy waiting for Calandryll to post a response to actually play UO.<br><br><B>SCREAMING AMAZON HELLBITCHES FROM COVE</b>: These are some of the deadliest opponents available to the faction system. However, they can be crippled by brutal infighting between the "Let's Use Men For Everything They've Got" subfaction, the "Men Are All Evil And Must Be Gelded" subfaction, and the much more numerous "Um, I'm Really a Guy" subfaction.<br><br><b>WE'RE JUST MINERS FROM MINOC</b>: Although usually having 100 STR, most folks in this faction are just trying to mindlessly mine some ingots, whom they turn over to their other character named "Smithy" or "Smitty" or "an evil bastard", who then cranks out the GM plate for their real characters in other factions. Thus this faction is actually one of the best protected ones out there.<br><br><b>PASS THAT WACK VESPER NIGHTSHADE, DUDE</b>: Members of this faction all write web pages that <a href="http://lum.xrgaming.net/">constantly</a> <a href="http://www.thechosen.com/">reference</a> <a href="http://www.battlevortex.com/">each</a> <a href="http://uo.drtwister.com/">other</a> <a href="http://www.graphicsmasters.com/uo">in</a> <a href="http://uopg.uoguilds.com">an</a> <a href="http://users.erols.com/enter/LBE">act</a> <a href="http://greatbob.uoboard.net/">of</a> <a href="http://azile.tradespot.net/">bizarre</a> <a href="http://www.mastersage.com/">mutual</a> <a href="http://www.wtfman.com/">masturbation</a>. Thus they are way too busy to actually play UO. However, their wrath were they to actually play would probably be fearsome, what with all the bile saved up.<br><br><b>THE TRINSIC VOLUNTEERS</b>: Those brave men in blue, green, red, and whatever other colors the robes come in now, of course have the most powerful faction, although they are occasionally struck with fits of powerlessness (especially when summoned by someone asking "dood can i place a house here"). With the ability to spawn multi-GM-level Balrons and unbelievably powerful yet <a href="http://lum.xrgaming.net/ubb/Forum2/HTML/000092.html">woefully non-communicative main plot characters</a>, the Trinsic boys, girls, and off duty GMs are really the ones to watch in this matchup.<br><br><b><a href="http://lum.xrgaming.net/ubb/Forum2/HTML/000151.html">Now, isn't that a bit more involving than Minax vs. the Sages?</a></b><br></font></td></tr></table><br clear=left><br><a name="newsitem952916495,65908,"></a>

I watched a pretty cool movie on USA today that didn't involve breasts. Thank god it had no breasts, because if I had, my wife, whom you all have unilaterally decided is the incarnation of Susan Faludi since she commits the cardinal sin of expressing her own opinion, would have beaten me senseless for commiting the sin of adultery in my heart, at which point I probably would have suffered stat loss, since as most of you know I'm a Red in real life. <br><br>Huh? Oh yes, the movie. Called "<a href="http://us.imdb.com/Plot?0110678">No Escape</a>", it was basically an Escape from New York ripoff where a bunch of prisoners are thrown on an island and made to fend for themselves. (Trust me, this post will achieve some relevance soon, I think.) Lance Henrikson was a father-like figure (helpfully called "Father" for the slow learners among us) and Ernie Hudson played the same role Ernie Hudson always plays in movies. Together they ran Happyland, where everyone got together and drank fake ale and sang Christmas carols. (The fake ale and carols, unfortunately, I'm not making up.)<br><br>Unfortunately, Happyland was under siege by Those Darn Dreads, a bunch of feral outcasts whom a charismatic leader (we'll call him Fear, since I can't remember his name in the movie) united with the express purpose of storming Happyland and killing everyone, because, as far as I could tell, Fear was really sick of the goddamn Christmas carols. <br><br>Luckily, salvation arrived in the form of Ray Liotta, who basically kicked everyone's ass, including the Warden, who came onto the island for no apparent reason save for the hero, who just happened to be a helicopter pilot, to fly away and let everyone live happily ever after, except for the Warden, who got PKd, and Fear, whose head exploded messily.<br><br>Now what am I trying to say here? That "No Escape" looks suspiciously like "Waterworld", down to everyone wearing dopey conch-shell armor? Well, yeah. But really, let's just ditch the lame metaphors entirely (except for Fear's head exploding, of course) and get down to brass tacks.<br><br>Basically, everyone in UO is pissed right now. <br><br>PKs are pissed because Origin is gently ramming a crowbar up their ass (inability to macro skills in houses/stat loss not going away/Happyland allowing all their victims to run away and hide).<br><br>Roleplayers are pissed because Origin is basically calling them on their shit and allowing them to choose between being true to the "plot" and staying in Dreadville and fighting it out, or running away to Happyland where life is beautiful and safe and no one will ever threaten them again, and they're mad because they want their plot line to happen in Happyland (where, presumably, the final battle between Minax and Sir Geoffrey will be fought out using backgammon).<br><br>Mages are pissed because dex monkeys can do about 975 points of damage a second now, unless they score a critical hit in which case they might do slightly more.<br><br>Dex monkeys are pissed because now with the new skill patch one can create a full-power ready to go dex monkey in about 34 seconds (less if Magery is left at 90) and now they really are nothing more than point click and go specials.<br><br>Fear is pissed, because I keep referring to his head exploding. In response to my constant exploding of his head, he's decided to prove that players can be trusted with the removal of stat loss by killing everyone in game he sees.<br><br>Ireland is pissed because there's this really, really bad movie involving St. Patrick on Fox Family right now. St. Patrick, in the movie, is a jedi knight, but I can't figure out if he's on the light or dark side because he has the Vader choke grip, but he can also go all translucent and let swordsmen not hit him. Christianity and Malcom McDowell are both rumored to be involved.<br><br>Men are pissed because my wife posted a story about how all men are scum. For some reason this was taken seriously, except by the men who really are scum.<br><br>(Ireland isn't technically in UO, but I'm pretty sure Fear and men are.)<br><br>I think the answer belongs in movies. There was this <a href="http://us.imdb.com/Title?0107333">really, really bad movie</a> that I need to find and sell online so that you can all see it, because it has the best line ever uttered in movies - "Teach me to be devastating! I want to be FURIOUS!" It also had a little girl who literally kicked everyone's ass.<br><br><b><a href="http://lum.xrgaming.net/ubb/Forum2/HTML/000150.html">As movies grow closer and closer to videogames, we gain more and more wisdom thereby.</a></b><br><br></font></td></tr></table><br clear=left><br><a name="newsitem952885908,28312,"></a>

<i>I&#8217;m not bad &#8211; I&#8217;m just drawn that way.</i><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-- Jessica Rabbit<br><br>Just when you thought it was safe to start staring at wood elf butt again &#8211; Mr. Brad &#8216;Vision&#8217; McQuaid goes and does an interview with Computer Gaming World &#8211; and unfortunately I read it. Blame Mark Asher for asking this question &#8211; and Mr. McQuaid for the boneheaded answer:<br><br><font color="#77FF77"><i>First, the women in Everquest are so&#8230;.well, let&#8217;s just say they take full advantage of the 3D engine. What gives?</I><br><br>Brad:  I&#8217;ve asked Rosie Cosgrove, Everquest&#8217;s Lead Artist about this many times&#8230;eventually she candidly told me that if she could really be an inhabitant of Norrath, that&#8217;s how she&#8217;d want to look. Who am I to argue with that? (That they also appeal to males ages 14-30, who compromise perhaps more than ninety percent of our demographic, is purely coincidental).</font><br><br>Sure it is Brad cough cough. Give my frackin arse a break &#8211; pullleeeezzze.<br><br>Let&#8217;s dissect this cute little answer shall we?  First we will assume that good old Rosie really is a female &#8211; from birth. I know, assumptions get you in trouble &#8211; but there isn&#8217;t enough room to go into that issue alone if that&#8217;s not the case.  Ok &#8211; we have a genuine female &#8211; working in a predominately male field. Now &#8211; Mr. &#8220;I am the vision&#8221; McQuaid has to ask MANY TIMES?  EVENTUALLY? What were her first answers? <br><br>Next he goes to say, who am I to argue with that? Well &#8211; YOU&#8217;RE THE LEAD DESIGNER, BRAD &#8211; obviously that was the answer you were looking for so you could shift the heat off.  Shame on you.  200 years ago in the South &#8211; if you had walked up to a slave and said, &#8220;We take pretty good care of ya, don&#8217;t we boy?&#8221;, you&#8217;d have probably gotten a &#8220;Yes, massah&#8221; for an answer. Guess it was their fault for not speaking up sooner.<br><br>Now, we get to the real answer behind the pathetic justification. Brad thinks that all males 14-30 enjoy looking at scantily clad females. Is he wrong? Hell no,  lots of males do. I would take exception to EQ being 90% male, I sure seem to run into more female players than that. Anyway, what this translates to, using his figures, is that we feel free to use the models of 10% of our customers for the titillation of the boys. The fact that some males feel this is an insult to their intelligence seems to be lost in there somewhere.<br><br>The next question &#8211; why would women be offended being turned into sex objects?<br><br>Well let&#8217;s look at this supposed answer. Don&#8217;t ask me why, I keep having visions of poor Rosie under a bare bulb being beaten with rubber hoses till she gives the &#8216;right&#8217; answer, but corporate evil is usually more subtle than that.<br><br>She would like to look that way. Ok, maybe. I might also &#8211; on rare occasions. My next question would be does Rosie play like a normal player &#8211; and does she have to put up with the nearly constant string of lewd remarks and innuendoes from the males we have wittingly or unwittingly been put here to &#8216;service&#8217; by our appearance?<br><br>Why does this attitude occur? Well men are pigs &#8211; just ask the honest ones. Not all men &#8211; but a lot of them, poor things, they really can&#8217;t help it &#8211; it&#8217;s a genetic defect. They are also conditioned for right or wrong to think that a female in immodest attire is seeking male attention &#8211; and ya know what &#8211; that is usually correct. That conditioning makes them very confused when it&#8217;s not the females CHOICE to look like that &#8211; when the female only wants to be treated as an equal gamer and isn&#8217;t looking for gifts &#8211; or attention &#8211; or protection &#8211; or anything starting with cyber. Male gamers that pick the female avatar as a TACTICAL strategy &#8211; to get stuff &#8211; to get aid by playing into that very stereotype, further confuse the issue. A side note to this &#8211; if you are well aware of underage boys playing your game, Mr. Brad, you&#8217;re not doing them any favors &#8211; they are confused enough already about male-female relations.<br><br>There is a word for females that use their feminine wiles to garner money and favors &#8211; and Mr. Brad &#8211; there is also a word for men that use women as sex objects to line THEIR own pockets. <br><br><b><a href="http://lum.xrgaming.net/ubb/Forum2/HTML/000149.html">A choice would be nice...</a></b><br><br></font></td></tr></table><br clear=left><br><a name="newsitem952727343,35198,"></a>

<p>Reading the boards and checking my email, one would think that the new UO expansion is some sort of horrible punishment being visited upon the UO player base. With the clean sweep of one patch session, PKs will be savagely neutered, and player-run towns will be savagely torn apart by those same neutered PKs. You&#8217;d think those two thoughts couldn&#8217;t co-exist, but you&#8217;d be <a href="http://home.sprintmail.com/~astronomer/documents/doublethink.htm">wrong</a>.</p><p>Contrary to <a href="http://www.battlevortex.com/">popular belief</a>, we here at LumCorp do have opinions on all this. Hell, we have at last count 6 megabytes of opinions online. Just search through them in that happy little box over to the right. And last time I checked, we haven&#8217;t been at all shy about sharing them with you, the viewing audience, which last time I checked my statistics, made up about 1% of all current UO customers. So here are my opinions, once again, on the topics everyone seem so worked up about. In fact, since I&#8217;m in such an expansive mood, I&#8217;ll even solve everyone&#8217;s problems, hopefully in time to adjourn for a flagon of fake ale.</p><p>An epiphany struck me as I thought about this today. The PKs and the player run towns &#8211; both in an uproar. They really are all the same topic. That topic is control.</p><p>At first glance, you would see the self-proclaimed Mayor of Moonglow and the Murderer Muffaletta as diametrically opposed creatures, but they&#8217;re really not. They both have the same goal &#8211; that of controlling your game. They want you to play the way they have decided is the <i>correct </i>way to play the game. And they are oh, so unholy pissed that what little control they have is going away.</p><p>The Murderer Muffaletta is an easier case. No one likes murderers. They are rude, uncouth, and speak in words of three letters or less. So it&#8217;s easy to just kiss them off. And, in large part, this is justified. Being a murderer is not a lifestyle option. Being a murderer is not being a member of an oppressed minority. Being a murderer is not a character class you choose when making a new character. It is the result of choices that the player behind the character makes. One of UO&#8217;s main problems in the first year of its life was that there were no consequences for those actions.</p><p>Adrick over at <a href="http://www.battlevortex.com/">Battlevortex</a> has been a very vocal advocate of those murderers. His response is that stat loss is unfairly punitive. Well, duh. Punishment is punitive. The entire point of the exercise is to dissuade the players from randomly murdering each other. Adrick and the rest of Those Darn PKs have been very adamant that stat loss is unfair, but have been curiously silent as to what the replacement for that penalty should be.</p><p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; someone else might say, &#8220;setting foot in the Enhanced PvP lands&#8221; (as opposed to the Gimped PvP lands) &#8220;is tantamount to consenting to be killed.&#8221; No. The old lands are not turning into Abyss, and they are not turning into Siege Perilous. This no doubt disappoints many of you. But the fact of the matter is that, with a revamping of the Order/Chaos/Guildwar system that everyone involved sees fit to ignore completely for some reason, the rules in the old lands are the same as they always have been. There will still be PKs, and they will still be in numbers too large to ignore, yet too small to make playing the game impossible. The sky is not falling, the world is not coming to an end, and Siege Perilous and Cool Test Center (is it still called that?) are still there for those who don&#8217;t want to bake bread, but play games to crush.</p><p>But that&#8217;s a problem for many reds. They don&#8217;t want responsibility. They don&#8217;t want it to be difficult. That&#8217;s why they&#8217;re PKs, for God&#8217;s sake. Being a PK is the quickest way to wealth in the game. Human beings have the best loot. It&#8217;s a simple thing to understand.</p><p>Which then makes a possible replacement for stat loss present itself &#8211; <b>after a person becomes Red, they may no longer loot any grey or blue corpses. </b>No loot, no PKs. This won&#8217;t stop minerkillers and it won&#8217;t halt Noto PKs, but it will control the PK for loot phenomenon. Will it make the PK problem worse or better? Who knows. The brutal fact is that stat loss, unfair as it is, does have the benefit of actually working for its intended purpose &#8211; keeping the PK population under control. It&#8217;s really doubtful that the UO dev team will disassemble something that works, especially considering the amount of things that don&#8217;t work. And frankly, operating under stat loss is probably a better deal for the PK then operating without loot. You know, without loot, those Corp Por regs become a bit rarer (well, except for the 99.99% of PKs with blue mules.)</p><p>Actually, what is really crippling PKs with the new changes aren&#8217;t so much the thought of stat loss as the fact that you can no longer safely spar up your skills in a house any more. No more safe Red macroing. That is a sea change for the Red, and many of them understand this already. The PKs are about to become the hunted, fleeing through the wilderness hoping that their pursuers never find them &#8211; oddly enough, very closely akin to the life of a murderer in reality.</p><p>The rumor floating around now is that Sunsword is hinting of a Red Amnesty &#8211; a one-time-only chance for reds to lose their murder counts, and rejoin the rest of humanity in Trammel fighting opposing factions, or Felucca (or as I like to term it, &#8220;Happy Fun Land&#8221; since I can&#8217;t spell Fellucca) slamming fake brews. Of course, very few would actually seriously take that chance and then remain blue, but it&#8217;s a gesture that in my opinion needs to be made. </p><p>You see, there&#8217;s this thing called the faction system. It hasn&#8217;t gotten much press with the usual suspects lately. Most blues think it&#8217;s part of that icky Enhanced PvP stuff they are running away from as fast as they can. Most reds think it&#8217;s, to use PK/junior high school argot, &#8220;really gay, dude&#8221;. But the faction system is the most exciting thing introduced into UO since&#8230; well, ever. It makes Order/Chaos look like a bunch of silly townfighters. It makes guildwars look like a pack of idiotic gang bangers. Screw fighting for gold and regs&#8230; try fighting for political power. You know, like the big boys do in real life. You think Reds should be allowed in Britain? Fine. Take over Britain. (You can have it, that place is a pit anyway.)</p><p>But so far an embarrassing amount of folks regard the faction system as anathema. The hard core PKs see it as a roleplaying thing. The hard core roleplayers see it as a PK thing (since most hard core roleplayers misspell PvP &#8220;PK&#8221; whenever they are able to utter the phrase in Olde Anglish) What&#8217;s really funny is that most of those PKs post on message boards &#8220;this is so gay! I can&#8217;t wait for Shadowbane dood!&#8221; when Shadowbane is built around a very similar faction system as its complete reason for existence. One can only imagine the Shadowbane message boards in 2001. &#8220;this game is so gay. Remember UO? We could r0x0rs whoever we wanted! This game sux my nadz!&#8221;</p><p>And PKs aren&#8217;t the only ones ignoring the faction system. The player run towns, with a few noble exceptions, are screaming bloody murder that they want to get the hell away from it as quickly as possible. They are demanding special exemptions, that their carefully constructed empires be moved magically en masse to the Happy Fun Land, or in <a href="http://www.cyboards.com/servlets/CyBoard?I=44&amp;A=vm&amp;O=824">one extreme case</a>, just making the old lands Happy Fun Land with a flip of a PK switch. (I guess the Reds currently in Happy Fun Land get to fall down and migrate as ghosts or something. Hope they don&#8217;t own any houses.)</p><p>This sickens me. All of these player-run establishments claim to be run by role-players. Well, guess what. There&#8217;s a plot now. And it&#8217;s in your face. And people are going to die. And this is the best thing to happen to this game in, again&#8230; ever, and your collective response is to say &#8220;Hmph!&#8221;, pack up and leave.</p><p>Well, good riddance. I&#8217;m not planning on spending much time in Felucca anyway. I&#8217;ve got a career as a ruthless dictator now! &#8220;Today Occlo, Tomorrow Sosaria!&#8221; Minax wants YOU, babe. So if the thought of someone with an actual reason for being hostile and aggressive makes you piss your pants and run away, buh bye. I can understand player establishments wanting protection from random PK attacks, but there won&#8217;t be that many any more. Just ask the PKs, they&#8217;ll be <i>glad</i> to tell you exactly how far they are taking that crowbar up the butt.</p><p>So, the player run towns, again, with rare and noble exceptions, are demanding special treatment. This should surprise exactly three of you (and don&#8217;t worry, that [young] tag will wear off soon). They are insisting that, since they&#8217;ve, you know, given so much to the community and stuff, they should, you know, get to be grandfathered. As in having every single house they own be magically zapped to Happy Fun Land.  I&#8217;m sure every GM in Austin right now is going &#8220;Uhh&#8230; we gotta do WHAT?&#8221;</p><p>Well, that&#8217;s just bullshit. I&#8217;m sorry to say this to such self-declared pillars of the player community, but you do not have an inherited hammerlock on property rights simply because you were the best at sucking up to a Green Robed Freak. There are HUNDREDS of player-run groups out there who are aching for the chance at running a player community &#8211; no doubt as a response to the political backbiting and corrupt double dealing that goes on in the ones already &#8220;blessed&#8221; (sounds of old-school Seers puking here) &#8211; and they&#8217;re to be told &#8220;Sorry, you can&#8217;t have a town in the new lands, either, because, you know, Happy Fun Land is already taken by the Bozarkian Mage Tower Incorporated. But you can still stay in Desolate Wasteland! We&#8217;re too good for it, but it should suit you nicely! Got to go bust it strictly for the players now! Bye bye!&#8221;</p><p>(If you can&#8217;t tell by the above, hypocrisy bothers me. A lot.)</p><p><a href="http://www.thechosen.com/">Jinx</a> has a lot to say about this as well. It&#8217;s recommended reading. He makes the not inconsequential point that a community is not defined by some sort of holy goodness, but merely by being a grouping of people. Everyone is in a community, whether that community be a tavern or a PK guild. Do PK guilds get to move their mules&#8217; towers, too?</p><p>Now, I acknowledge that there are some folks who have been waiting for the One Holy Apostolic PK Switch since the dawning of time (or at least the dawning of UO) and really, <b>really</b> want to move. They don&#8217;t want to fight people, they don&#8217;t want to have to defend themselves, they just want to slam those fake ales. In <a href="http://www.mud.co.uk/richard/hcds.htm">Richard Bartle&#8217;s incredibly insightful paper</a> that everyone including me keeps telling you to read over and over again, they are &#8220;hearts&#8221;, or socializers. Happy Fun Land is made for hearts. They should have a chance to go there.</p><p>But not as easy as they&#8217;d like it to be mind you. Here&#8217;s my suggestion.</p><p><b>Leaders of communities recognized by the people of the shard, as nominated by GMs, Seers, Elders, and news reporters of UO Vault, Crossroads of Britannia, and UO Stratics, will have the opportunity to detail which houses of their community may be transferred to the new lands. Each house so moved must be public, and open to all for the benefit of the community. There will only be a very limited number of communities that will be moved for each shard, and they must have a valid, sound reason for wishing to be transferred (such as being a place of socialization more suited for Felucca than Trammel.) and such a transfer must be viewed by all concerned as being in the best interest of the player community as a whole.</b><b></b></p><p><b>Those houses&#8217; ownership are transferred to the lead Seer of that shard. The leaders of that community may be friended to each house so that they can make use of the banning and co-ownership functions of housing. They will no longer have ownership of that community, but stewardship. If the leadership of that community fails in its duties to the community, whether by active misuse or benign neglect, the houses will be taken from those leaders and placed in the hands of stewards who that Seer feels worthy of the responsibility of maintaining a community.</b></p><p><b>All communities in the future that seek IGM/Seer enhancement must also follow these guidelines. After UO: Renaissance is opened, no communities will be moved in the future, nor will GMs or Seers at any time allow houses to be placed illegally or at the expense of other players.</b></p><p>Again, it&#8217;s an imperfect solution, but save growing cojones and defending your home or trying to beat the land rush, it&#8217;s all we got, folks. </p><p>In the end, it&#8217;s all about control. Whether someone denies you the right to place your own house in the new lands because they have some unspoken prior right as the landed nobility of UO, or whether someone simply denies you the right to exist (or at least to see the game in color), there are an awful lot of self-appointed arbiters of how you should play UO.</p><p>And you know what? They&#8217;re all wrong. You go do what you want. Just stay the hell outta my yard. Which, as soon as the Faction System goes in, will be most of Occlo. And Nu&#8217;jelm is looking nice, too. </p><p>And if you are running a player community that has the vision and courage to stay in a changing, uncertain world, you have my respect. And if you&#8217;ve read this page for any length of time, you know that is a rare thing indeed.</p><b><a href="http://lum.xrgaming.net/ubb/Forum2/HTML/000147.html">I&#8217;m sure you all have something to say.</a></b><br></font></td></tr></table><br clear=left><br><a name="newsitem952653002,90851,"></a>

Ahh pity the poor PK.  Stuck in desolate Felucca, stat loss lurking behind every 5th murder count, unable to travel to glorious Trammel, unable to find victims unskilled in fighting, unable too... well do anything really.  Except keep on PKing.  Against people that <i>just might know how to fight back</i>.  The life of a PK is tough indeed.  <br><br>All sarcasm aside, it might be.  (haha fooled ya didn't I?  You thought I was going to rant about how kewl it was that PKs are screwed.)  There really is something that disturbs me about all this and I just can't quite put my finger on it.  It isn't stat loss.  I really can't see what the problem is with stat loss.  I mean its lame and fictionless -- there's no doubt about that.  But as a penalty it just doesn't suck that much (mostly cause its way easy to avoid and especially so with long term counts gone).  Besides, as Spanner_Monkey said somewhere on our new, improved and even more gimped blackboard, the idea of mass murderers, virtual or otherwise, complaining about penalties for their crimes is ludicrous.  He's right.  It is.  So no it isn't stat loss that is bothering me.<br><br>I think its that, with the exception of a few player-run towns that might possibly be screwed and might not (I haven't quite made up my mind there), ALL the new changes seem to benefit the non-PKers.  I mean the PKers didn't get anything.  Oh yea -- no long term murder counts.  Sort of a backhanded consolation prize for taking it up the ass.  Because they really have I think.<br><br>Don't get me wrong here -- I don't like PKs as a rule.  I like grief PKs even less than I like other types of PKs (i.e. those that use PKing as a way to fund their playstyle) and think that they are generally a waste of bandwidth.  Now PVPers I respect -- a lot.  So lets make that distinction clear.  Still there's this inherent unfairness of it all that bothers me.  Yeah, I realize no one ever said it would be fair and that life ain't fair and that neither is UO and all that kind of good stuff.  But its my rant and if I want to rant about the unfairness of it all well I guess I can do that.<br><br>So lets look at the changes.  PVMers get to fight monsters and other than people looting their kills they basically get worry-free playtime.  And parties.  Resource collectors (miners, lumberjacks, etc) have incredibly easy now.  Other than the occassional monster that might catch them at their trade, death is not a concern for these people now.  Player run cities aside, RPers are basically in the same boat.  Death just doesn't have to be a concern for these people now.  And they get parties.  Merchants.  Man these people have got it MADE!  Make their wares in complete and utter safety, transport themselves to the front steps of their house in Felucca, restock their vendors, collect cash, and leave.  Making a profit off RPers, PVMers, PVPers, and PKers alike.  All their old houses secure in Felucca. All the old shops completely safe.  I wonder what they will do with all the money they are going to make now.  Its not like there's a lot to spend it all on in the game.  Maybe they will sell it on ebay.  PVPers make out too.  They get factions.  <br><br>What did the PKer get?  They got no more long term murder counts.  But look at what they lost.  They can't go to Trammel.  So that's 1/2 of the world now closed off to them.  They lost their victims (its hard for me to care about this one but if I were a PK I guess I'd be mad about that).  AND people from from Trammel can come over and make fun of them and charge high merchant prices, etc etc.. but they can't do the same.  It just doesn't seem right. <br><br>I think maybe if there was a way for two people to engage in 'anger PVP' (so this would be concentual) without having to go to factions or guild stones (what a pain in the tukus that would be just to fight one other person you happened to get pissed at that day) the PKs might be more able to deal with getting shafted so often.  I find it hard to fathom that in a world where it is openly acknowledged there are an abundance of 'anti-social players' it is so friggin hard to enter into consentual PVP without the risk of stat loss.  So maybe the developers might consider this type of a toy for 'the other half.'  You know...the black sheep.  Those folks we keep locked up in the closet and only let them out if they want to risk stat loss or go on a stone.<br><br>I dunno.  Maybe we shouldn't care.  Maybe PKs have given up the right to have treats (you know by virtue of them being mass murderers and such -- or maybe by virtue of failing to take responsibility for their actions).  Then again maybe not.  I torn.  Its real easy to shrug and say it doesn't concern me and why should I give a shit anyway.  *I* am not being shafted.  Its real easy to say haha they deserve it.  Its real easy to say go play another game.  Its a little harder to look at it from the other perspective.  I mean, these people love this game too.  These people have spent years building things here too.  There is community among the PKs.  PKs have multiple accounts, lots of houses, almost three years invested, what makes their investment less than mine?  The fact that their playstyle prevents mine?  EVERYONE's playstyle affects others.  There's no getting around that.  If you tame everything on ice isle in an attempt to raise your taming and I come along after you and want to do the same thing -- I can't (well I think they've made it so you can gain skill from previously tamed pets but before you couldn't).  If I pick up all the regs in Yew and harvest all the veggies then you have to wait till they respawn -- or go somewhere else.  If I EV all the dragons in Destard then you have to wait for respawn.  I could go on but you get the picture I'm sure.<br><br>I don't know.  Maybe if we all tried to see it from the other guy's point of view we could stop all these rant site wars and go back to whats really fun -- bashing OSI.  Can't we all just get along?<br><br><b><a href="http://lum.xrgaming.net/ubb/Forum2/HTML/000145.html">What do you guys think?</a></b><br><br></font></td></tr></table><br clear=left><br><a name="newsitem952635078,66471,"></a>

You don't need to know what stats do. Who told you what stats do? The manual? We're patching the manual. Knowing what your characters can do is contraindicated by our Vision.

So there.</font><br><br>-- Abashi, <a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/020212.html">talking about another game entirely</a><br><br>As the debate over stat loss finally dies down, to be replaced by the furious screams of angry PvP-hostile players pissed that they may <a href="http://boards.xrgaming.net/cob/devboard/messages/4980.html">actually have to, you know, move</a>, let's take a look at Siege Perilous, otherwise known as "That Bad Place Without Stat Loss".<br><br>Adrick is absolutely right -- if you want the ability to kill indiscriminately, Siege is the way to go. The system discourages grief players, while allowing huge guilds to own parts of the landscape and have free-wheeling large scale battles that are as close to "the dreamy days of Dread vs Anti" as anything you're likely to see, both then and now. <br><br>So why hasn't the PvP and PK communities embraced Siege en masse? Well, the grief PKs don't have many victims on Siege since pretty much everyone there is capable of fighting back. However, it's obvious that the dev team are intent on making the grief PK an endangered species anyway. So I'll say what Sunsword et. al. won't -- fuck 'em. (Well, the latest series of changes pretty much said that already in so many words anyway.)<br><br>So that leaves the PvPer who, for whatever reason, doesn't want to participate in the faction system. Been burned by Order/Chaos, doesn't trust Origin's track record in keeping things exploit free, has a religious objection to stat loss, just thinks the word "Minax" is gay, whatever. The answer is, of course, to go to the dedicated PvP-only shard. In EQ it's Rallos Zek, in AC it's Darktide, and in UO it's Siege Perilous. <br><br>Now, why isn't Siege just overrun with gleeful slayers of the deserving, given the lack of stat loss? Simple. RoT - Rate over Time - Runesabre's Attempt To Kill Macroing v1.0.<br><br>Yet the development team is in the process of implementing 2.0 - otherwise known as "Killing Macroing without Making Newbies Ram Their Face Into A Brick Wall 800 Times Really Hard". It accomplishes the same goals as RoT - it kills macroing, rewards normal, natural playstyles as opposed to artificial tweak-the-system gaming. <br><br>So why is RoT still on Siege Perilous?<br><br>Siege is becoming more and more the red-headed stepchild of UO - almost all of the UO:R changes are just being ignored or undeployed there. The new skill system is one change that needs to go in.<br><br>I strongly suspect that the current Siege community would be very, very strongly behind this move. Removal of RoT would make the shard much less newbie-hostile (and by newbie I mean new characters, not new players) while the ban on merchants buying items still causes developing characters to be either dependent on guilds or really, really good. Twinks are usually neither.<br><br>Its time has passed. <B>Rate-over-time on Siege needs to go.</b><br><br><b><a href="http://lum.xrgaming.net/ubb/Forum2/HTML/000142.html">What do you think?</a></b><br></font></td></tr></table><br clear=left><br><a name="newsitem952527249,10075,"></a>

With the cannonball volley ended and the smoke beginning to settle, the players of Ultima Online are beginning to slowly creep out from under shelters and fox-holes to assess the latest bombshell from the dev team. We asked them for salmon steaks. They gave us tuna fish sandwiches. First reactions were to cry foul, gnash teeth, and beat ourselves about the head and neck with our keyboards. But if you sit back and actually look at what is going to happen in the pre-Skynet era of Sosaria (Ultima Online I), you'll see that while it is no salmon steak, tuna fish really isn't all that bad.<br><br>We asked for secure house deals and secure pet sales.<br>You got classic versus modern and proper versus improper.<br>We asked for shared karma and loot.<br>You got the proposed party system<br>We asked for more houses, PVP with a purpose, and a reduced "twink presence."<br>You got Moon Base Alpha.<br><br>Debates over whether "Enhanced PVP" should equate to "duty free mass murder" (i.e. removal of statloss) notwithstanding, when you stop the closed-eye, covered-ear protesting - what you see might not be as bad as you think it will be. Sure, the role-playing community must decide whether to <a href="http://msnhomepages.talkcity.com/timessquare/theereport/13thwarrior_review.html">tough it out and defend themselves against the hordes</a>, or <a href="http://www.shadowcove.com/arcadian/house.wav">blow up Walnut Grove in a final 2-hour TV movie</a>. At first this looks like a very hard decision to make, but I think people are just getting too upset far too easily (myself included). "Enhanced PVP" is still Consentual. The Faction war is a participants only escapade of combat, and if you are <b>not</b> in a faction, and someone murders you, you still report a murder, they still get a murder count, and they still can suffer statloss. Unfortunately, the <a href="http://www.battlevortex.com">narrow minds within the PK community </a> don't agree with OSI. They think that just by setting foot in "Enhanced PVP" areas, you are giving your consent to being hally whacked while walking to town - so they argue that statloss should be removed. Ummkay. Lets remove the <i><b>ONLY</i></b> consequence of murder from the game. Sorry, Charlie.<br><br>The only problem I still have is the explanation being dribbled out about how the new lands are not a mirror of the old lands. I guess that depends on <a href="http://www.c-span.org/guide/executive/investigation/video_text/">what your definition of the word <i>is</i> is.</a> I do <i>understand</i> why several members of the dev team (and the community relations empire) felt it was necessary to throw smoke screens at us, but guys: "No Comment" is so much easier an answer to defend. Instead of trying to noodle out a tongue-in-cheek explanation of why the lands are mirrored and pointing out how the minutiae of the land is altered to a degree, don't you think it would be easier to just say "No Comment. If I answer that, it can have an impact on upcoming plot developments." It isn't an answer, but then it isn't intentionally misleading either. One thing you have going for you right now is your integrity. It is absolutely <i>imperative</i> that people trust you. There is a line in the movie "The Freshman" where a young boy is speaking to an old Mob Kingpin.

In response to the Shaman nerfing we reported to you earlier today, Abashi writes on the official EQ forum:<br><br><font color="#77FF77">Hello all,<br>We just got out of our tuning meeting for this week. I did want to talk a bit about the Shaman changes that occurred on Test last week, and let you know about our plans for the production servers:<br><br>Strength: Last week we changed this spell on test to limit its effect and bring it in line with other 49th level shaman stat buffs. However, today we decided to leave it as it is on the production servers. <br><br>Togor's Insects: Despite the fact that information was changed in the spdat.eff file, the maximum effectiveness of the spell didn't change. This is another case where something that was previously controlled in code was moved to the spell database.

Well, kudos to Verant, they patched it so instead of it not working it's merely hideous expensive and impossible to make money with. Then again, that describes the rest of the trade skills in Everquest, so no surprises there.<br><br>As Verant tests the new spells for the expansion (go <a href="http://eq.castersrealm.com/kunark/spells/">here</a> for an updated list) high level Shamen on Test center noticed that the spells they <b>already</b> have weren't working as well.

Actually he writes letters.  He may also speak but I don't have any personal experience with that.  In any case, I received these words of wisdom in my mailbox and have his permission to post them here so that everyone may benefit.  Pay particular attention to point #1 as it addresses exactly how to adjust your stats once your skills are maxxed out.  <br><br><FONT color="#FF9999">You have plenty of ways to control the stats you gain.  The fundamental premise is that you gain stats when you gain skill.  You can't choose to NOT be smart yet still learn Anatomy no more than you can choose to be weak yet do lumberjacking all the time.<br><br>Stat gain has changed in this publish since the last publish so it will make it a tad more difficult for characters already in the works but here are the tools you have to work with.<br><br>1) You can use any GM skill to gain its appropriate stats if you have it marked up.  Conversely, if you have a GM skill you DON'T want to gain stats from you simply lock that skill.  <br><br>2) If the skill you are using is not a GM skill, then, you only have a<br>chance to gain stat when you actually learn skill.  This is why you gained INT from Anatomy despite fighting for a couple hours.  Your weapon skills did not improve, hence, their corresponding stats did not improve.  If you don't want INT raising while fighting due to Anatomy gain, then lock Anatomy and you won't gain any INT from the passive checks.  Course, you then won't gain Anatomy either.<br><br>#2 is the new change and is to prevent stat macroing.  Since you can no longer macro learning skills, by tying stat gain to skill gain, its implied then that you can't macro stat gain either.  At the same time we enhanced the rate of stat gain tremendously.  The overall affect then is that stats go up faster at the beginning of character development and then slow off towards the end till you reach a GM skill or two then you can use those GM skills to continue to modify and maintain your character's physical makeup using the skills you have selected for that character without having to resort to taking up OOC skills ( i.e., a Paladin doing snooping to get his/her DEX up ) to fill in the holes.</font><br><br><b><a href="http://lum.xrgaming.net/ubb/Forum2/HTML/000132.html">Continue the discussion on the skill/stat changes here.</a></b><br> <br><br><br><br><br><br></font></td></tr></table><br clear=left><br><a name="newsitem952312891,81264,"></a>

A day or so ago, MSN Zone had a series of chat sessions setup at GameCon 2000 with several gaming designers. Looking over the list, I picked the 3 that I thought might have the best information towards ORPGs specifically. While not limited to that genre - that is the one I have an interest in - and I wanted to hear from the big dogs themselves.<br><br>So, never being the shy one, I asked this question&#8230;<br><br><b>What is your take on women in gaming - are there any games/virtual worlds in the pipeline that in your estimation would appeal to the more mature and/or female gamer - and what responsibility do you think gaming companies have, if any, on the ever increasing spiral of violence and gore in games that are quite often played by young people. Do you think gaming companies should look at what literally thousands of people spend hundreds of hours absorbed in - and ask if this is healthy?</b><br><br>Here are the responses from the 3 most likely candidates.<br><br><i><b>Chris Taylor</b> - Gas Powered Games President/Designer of Dungeon Siege <br>Enjoy mystic fantasy role-playing games? Come meet Chris Taylor, one of the creators of Total Annihilation and The Core Contingency. Learn about his latest and greatest project -- Dungeon Siege. </i><br><br>Chris@Zone> good question... let me think about it...<br>Chris@Zone> I said to myself before I started on Dungeon Siege that I wanted my sister to play it...<br>Chris@Zone> It was a goal that has been hard to achieve due to the nature of an RPG...<br>Chris@Zone> I definitely would love to make a game that is fun for both men and women, but unfortunately that's a tough one for me.<br>Chris@Zone> I agree that companies have to recognize that gore and violence isn't something that everyone wants but ultimately it is driven by consumer taste.<br>Chris@Zone> I have been playing games all my life and I feel pretty good, but hey, there's no telling what will happen! :)<br><br><b>Adory> in media circles - of which games are only a part - isn't the spiral feeding itself?  Where do we say - enough? Desensitization to violence - and even violence towards women is in the media a lot these days.</b><br><br>Chris@Zone> I think it has to be driven from the consumer side, and ultimately demanded, that there should be more games that are less violent.<br>Chris@Zone> The whole thing is a tough issue to put it lightly.<br><br><br><i><b>Tony Zurovec</b> - Digital Anvil Producer/Director for Loose Cannon <br>Come meet Tony Zurovec, producer and director for Digital Anvil. He was one of the core programmers for the Ultima series as well as the highly acclaimed Crusader: No Remorse</i><br><br>Tony@Zone> I'm sure someone somewhere is designing games that would appeal, on average, to a predominantly female audience.  I myself pretty much design games that I want to play myself, and then just hope that other people will like it enough to buy enough copies..<br>Tony@Zone> ...so I can do it all over again.<br><br><i><b>Jordan Weisman</b> - Microsoft Creative Director for the Games Group <br>Designing the look and feel of games is Jordan's job. You've probably already seen some of his excellent work in MechWarrior, Red Planet, Star Trek and many more. As Creative Director for the Microsoft Games Group, see what new ideas Jordan is envisioning for upcoming games!</i><br><br>Jordan@Zone> From a personal perspective I have tried to concentrate in games that are about heroes in fantasy vehicles to avoid a one to one correlation with the real world and real violence.<br><br><b>Adory> what about women gamers - our role seems to be brushed aside - if not outright denied we exist by many companies</b><br><br>Jordan@Zone> I have always thought that strong female characters are much more interesting then the classic princess that needs saving . . .<br>Jordan@Zone> But I do admit that the worlds that these strong female characters exist in are designed to appeal primarily to males . . .<br>Jordan@Zone> It is a difficult chicken and egg type problem because many have tried to create games to "appeal to women" and have failed terribly. The only large-scale successes have been the Barbie software from Mattel. .<br>Jordan@Zone> Crimson Skies for instance is set in the very romantic era of the 1930s and done with a very Errol Flynn type sexy feel. It is an airplane action game - but the setting may have some appeal to women.<br><br>I freely admit - this is NOT the sort of question they expected from a nice light little fluff chat - I blindsided them. I do appreciate all three taking the time to answer off the cuff.<br><br>Now - if anyone out there wants one woman&#8217;s take on the issue - feel free to read on. Otherwise, I'm sure someone somewhere is still debating stat loss.<br><br>Let&#8217;s get a couple things out of the way up front. I am about to go into great length on what some consider stereotyping. I am NOT stereotyping - I am archetyping. Stereotyping is what gaming companies have done for so long - and that&#8217;s part of the problem. Stereotyping is when you try to fit all obviously recognizable members of a group into a mold with easily identifiable criteria - by sex, religion, color of skin, age etc. All men are testosterone laden cavemen - all women are weak, helpless, need protecting. All Jews are cheap. All blacks are lazy. All people under 15 are spike haired ill-mannered louts.<br><br>Good - have I offended enough people yet?  Thought so, you can see why stereotyping is bad. For starters - stereotyping is almost without fail about negatives.  While obviously some people in those categories MAY indeed fit the stereotype - it is patently unfair to lump everyone together based on such criteria. Typing people is indeed necessary when dealing with mass numbers - but stereotypical classifications are an extremely poor database sort. Database sorting however IS crucial - the sort criteria are the problem.<br><br>Archetyping. Ok, what the hell is the difference? Well, the criteria. In many instances, especially when talking about MMORPGs, which is what I intend to primarily focus on in this article - the criteria is motivations. Motivations can only be loosely associated with stereotypical models. Get down to archetyping by motivation - and everyone is served better. Archetyping crosses gender and age boundaries. It&#8217;s also a lot more work, because you have to understand the people that fall within it - and WHY they have different motivating forces.<br><br>You see, when I lodge the complaint that women are underserved in gaming - I am lodging the complaint on behalf of more than just female personages. I am lodging it on behalf of all peoples that fall into the archetype that are looking for the things that would be higher on the priority list of (most) women - this includes a lot of men - and people of all ages. Well, first, lets look at the whys. Bearing in mind - this excludes a lot of female players that DO enjoy playing the way things are now - within the current gaming philosophies out today. There are some. For some, we&#8217;ve simply had no alternatives. Since female players are considered a minority (whether true or not) in gaming circles - then a large portion of that archetype must not be being served with the archetype most games are designed for.<br><br>Gaming companies are primarily staffed by young male designers. Young males can be stereotyped as testosterone driven action cravers. Therefore - the priorities they assign to games they create are full of things that blow up. In games where that is the sole purpose - that&#8217;s fine. We are talking MMORPGs here - not Quake. We are talking about what many hope someday to be virtual worlds. Since gaming companies are still stuck in stereotype mode - the priorities they assign are action first - everything else is an afterthought.<br><br>Let&#8217;s establish a few criteria for an archetype that will cover most women, more mature folks (temperament here, not age), folks who are not primarily into blowing things up. Yes, we exist - and yes - we too are gamers. Our desires do not invalidate the desires of other archetypes. And no - not all females are going to fall into this set of motivational patterns, just as all males do not fall into the current ones.<br><br>Priorities are what this is about. It&#8217;s not about right and wrong, it&#8217;s about what&#8217;s important to a gamer in terms of weighting priorities. You have an option of a hamburger or cheeseburger for lunch. Neither is WRONG - what is your preference. It&#8217;s having the option there that is key. You get a choice - if both are not on the menu - it&#8217;s a poor menu. Gaming companies have taken the stance that oh, MOST of our customers (untrue BTW) like hamburgers - so we don&#8217;t need to offer cheeseburgers.<br><br>Not all &#8216;women&#8217; are going to agree with the statements below. But then, not all men appreciate the current attitudes either. One does not preclude the other. In the genre of virtual worlds - EVERYONE is served better with a richer, deeper, fuller world whether they choose to personally participate in that side or not.<br><br>What do <b>I</b> want to see in virtual worlds? Well, as a 40yr old female gamer - here is <b>MY</b> wish list.<br><br>Socialization is important to me. It&#8217;s what forms and maintains communities. It allows me to interact with the person behind the pixels - vs. will my trained set of pixels beat their trained set of pixels.  <br><br><b>I</b> also want ways that my own skills can shine thru my character - my OWN creativity - my OWN talents - not just character built skills. This could be thru crafts, careers and even games. The industry has identified women as being a huge part of online board/card type games - there is nothing wrong with adding depth to a world with games within games.<br><br><b>I</b> am more into intellectual challenges than physical challenges.<br><br><b>I</b> am more into creating than destroying. I like to build rather than tear down. Whether it be in crafts - community building - whatever - adding something rather than taking away.<br><br><b>I</b> want to let my alter ego <b>live</b> in a virtual world/society vs all the direction and focus of the game being on skill building/leveling.<br><br><b>I</b> want my character to be as unique as possible - I don&#8217;t particularly like having a few hundred twins running around.<br><br><b>I</b> resent my character models being window dressing for male eyes. Female characters should absolutely have options of more moderate appearance and dress as an option.<br><br><b>I</b> want my virtual life to have some meaning - some context - something that means something past existing or racking up a score. Long-term goals that are attainable thru dedication not tedium. <br><br><b>I</b> want as much care an attention paid to social and nonviolent activities as is paid to PvP and PvM activities. <br><br><b>I</b> want societal rules that respect and protect people that aren&#8217;t into violence - rules that dictate appropriate and inappropriate behavior - a playbook that everyone can look at and go - yeah - society DOES have to have rules to exist, it&#8217;s the price we pay for having a society. I also want swift, evenhanded justice to those that step across those clearly defined lines. There is also that issue about being responsible for your actions thing.<br><br><b>I</b> want the contributions I make to mean something - make a mark - be memorable - be sought out.<br><br>Notice - a lot of these overlap. With the possible exception of not wanting to be a pinup girl for men - most of these cross gender and age lines. Also notice that a lot of these are more about atmosphere and attitude - than game mechanics. This is by no means a complete list - but it&#8217;s a start.<br><br>Designers are starting to get a clue - they have a long way to go. They have the &#8216;blow things up - slay things&#8217; down cold - now they need to start turning their attentions to the rest of the things that make a world go round. At its heart - if there is no home and hearth to protect - what are the fighting types fighting for?<br><br><br>Although I found it humorous that Jordan Weisman said&#8230;.<br><br>Jordan@Zone> It is a difficult chicken and egg type problem because many have tried to create games to "appeal to women" and have failed terribly. The only large-scale successes have been the Barbie software from Mattel. .<br><br>Female gamers are a little deeper than playing with Barbie dolls. Now - as a child, I had Barbie dolls - they stayed stuck in the corner 99.9% of the time. Once I got to an age I took an interest in designing clothing - I made clothes for them for awhile - but I think that was much more closely linked to my desire to create - than play with dolls, they were simply my pattern dummies. And there IS a Barbie doll syndrome in these games - both from the creative aspect - and from the desire to be individuals - this is by no means a female only phenomenon.<br><br>Game designers are, of course, free to ignore the above. After all, servicing adolescent males is a multibillion dollar a year industry. They would, however, be interested in figures that show that over 50% of American homes now have an internet-connected computer, many of which probably are owned by women. <br><br>And if you think that activities for women don&#8217;t attract men, you&#8217;ve never been to Ladies&#8217; Night at a nightclub, either.<br><br><b><a href="http://lum.xrgaming.net/ubb/Forum2/HTML/000134.html">Imagine - an online RPG where the women really are women!</a></b><br><br></font></td></tr></table><br clear=left><br><a name="newsitem952301762,27817,"></a>

Rune(I do not require food, sleep or a social life)Sabre!<br><br>True to his word, the skill system was tweaked whilst we all lay snug in our beds and visions of way kewl skill gain danced through our heads.  I bounded out of bed this morning and made my way to the computer before I had even finished that first cup of joe, excited to be a test subject.  I saddled up my trusty steed, girded on my massive broadsword of power and something else that raises my tactics over 100, grabbed my worthy bow of power and something else that raises my archery over 100 and headed over to the area southwest of the Justice Shrine where monsters and reagents grow together and as one on trees, houses, the ground and everywhere else you look.  The spawn in this area is nothing short of overwhelming.  <br><br>The character I was playing is skill capped and has 100 swords, 98.x tactics, 97.x archery, 81.3 anatomy and then some other lesser points in tracking, healing, poisoning, etc.  Over 100 points in other skills are set to 'down' so the character does have room to gain skill.  Here's what I noticed:<br><br>1) Anatomy shot up pretty rapidly for the first hour I played and, while it slowed down after that, it still continued to go up.  However, I gained one point of intelligence during the two or so hours I played.  I see this as a pretty major problem.  I had no way of controlling that stat gain.  I was whacking critters with sword and bow and one would think this would have been enough to offset any gains that gaining anatomy would have linked to intelligence.  Yet it was not.  This is a fighter character and due to the practice of poisoning, healing and anatomy she has 80+ intelligence at the expense of dexterity.  I think we really need a way to control or lock our stats -- linking them to skill usage is not going to work.  Or at least, IMHO, it does not work now.  <br><br>Furthermore lets say you have a character that is 100 in sword, tac, archery, etc, and only needs, oh say, 20 or so more points in anatomy to become 7x GM.  You gain the 20 points of anatomy but in so doing you lose 15 points of strength to intelligence as a result.  Do you now have to resort to artificial methods of stat management (i.e. exploiting some bug, regardless of how innocuous)?  I really think stat management needs to be addressed.<br><br>2) I only gained .1 in tactics and nothing in archery.  This could be due to the type of critters I was fighting or due to the fact that the sword raised my tac over 100 and the bow raised my archery over 100.  However, I've gained archery with that bow before.  Its one of my favs (and I wish it was repairable -- I'm going to have to throw it out soon).  <br><br>3) I didn't gain any magic resist even though this character's resist is only in the mid-40's and I fought enough specters, shades and orc mages to have gained at least .1.  However, yesterday when I was testing I was able to gain resist by casting on myself.  In my house.  The same spell.  On the same target.  Over and over.  I thought we weren't supposed to be able to do that anymore.<br><br>4) How does one raise healing these days?  I know you need to let it get down as far as you dare before you attempt it but if you do that while fighting monsters it has this nasty tendency to make you dead instead of more healthy.  Especially the way things spawn these days.  I can't just stand in my house and drink poison anymore due to the anti-macroing code.  So whats a poor bleeding warrior to do?  Resign herself to quaffing potions?<br><br>Let me say in the face of all these complaints that I like the new skill system 100 times better than the old one -- but that isn't saying a whole lot. But there is still a lot of tweaking that needs to be done.  It seems like the system is good for some skills, not good for others.  But kudos to Rune and the rest of the development team for heading in the right direction.<br><br><b><a href="http://lum.xrgaming.net/ubb/Forum2/HTML/000132.html">What skills did you test this weekend?</a></b><br> <br></font></td></tr></table><br clear=left><br><a name="newsitem952299927,37789,"></a>

As many of you know I've been playing on Great Lakes since shortly after UO went gold.  Therefore today I had the joy of mucking around with the new skill system with all my old characters.<br><br>I have many characters who are ALMOST GM in many categories and who are also at the 700 skill cap.  These characters have been around for a while -- so you know, my mage doesn't have high meditation or eval because meditation wasn't invented and eval was a useless skill when the character was born.  I never was good about remembering to set up macros before I hit the sack so, by and large, most of my characters -- ok ALL of my characters -- need a fair amount of work.  (heh -- I said work.  If that isn't a telling statement right there I don't know what is.)<br><br>Well I have to tell ya -- after fooling around with my old characters all day long I'm less impressed with the new skill system than I thought I would be.  Skills that are less than approximately 80 go up with amazing speed -- and they go up even faster if you are moving around and actually playing the game.  My mage went from 45 med to almost 60 today in his first hour of play and I wasn't even trying during the last half hour.  I was out killing things and too busy to really pay much attention.  <br><br>On the other hand, I took a character (on a different account) out later in the afternoon whose skills were all 85 or better.  In 2 hours of game play I didn't gain one point of anything.  She's a dex monkey -- 97ish archery, 100 swords, 92ish anatomy, 98ish tact... you get the picture.  I was hoping to get another one of her skills to GM -- ANY of them -- didn't matter to me much which.  She's at the skill cap but I've set several of her skills to go down (she's still got 40 carpentry to lose from back when you practiced carpentry to gain strength -- yet another telling statement) so she SHOULD have gained .1 of something.  I tried crossing server lines, logging in and out, taking large amounts of damage, taking my armor off, putting it back on, fighting elementals, fighting orcs, fighting stuff in-between -- no luck. <br><br>I'm tempted to say that this patch is perfect for working up a disposable, stat-loss dex monkey or encouraging a new player to get started -- but not much else.  I was under the impression that the development team wanted to make macroing obsolete and undesirable.  If, however you're a veteran with skills to cap off -- I'm just not seeing how it meets that goal.<br><br><b><a href="http://lum.xrgaming.net/ubb/Forum2/HTML/000132.html">My friends all have Porsches, I must make amends</a></b><br><br></font></td></tr></table><br clear=left><br><a name="newsitem952140938,59040,"></a>

You're sick of hearing from me, right? Well, listen to these calm, soothing voices of reason. It helps to listen to classical music while reading these. I recommend <a href="http://lum.xrgaming.net/redoctober.mp3">this piece</a>.<br><br><font color="#FF9999">Well let's see what we have gone to now. <br><br>A) Let's segregate the reds so they can't enter the new land area. Hmm, I thought there were laws against this somewhere... you know white schools, black schools..blacks in the back of the bus.<br><br>B) Let's continue to impose restriction after restriction on them until they basically quit because after all we said that we won't "restrict" any style of play since it adds to the realism of the world. So, let's see, why have a red character now. 1) You can no longer loot houses because they are 100% secure ("We never intended housing to be 100% secure") 2) You can't enter the new lands 3) You will continue to face statloss 4) If you die and take statloss if you happen to die again you get statloss AGAIN even if you didn't kill anyone else. 5) The only people you will be able to attack are the ones hunting for you. And if you win you get statloss counts and if you lose you take statloss.<br><br>C) The only reds you see these days are the ones that hang around in houses outside the city trying to bait people into attacking them and then running into their house and trying then kill the person. I'm sure that was the entire intent of having a murderer/dread lord.<br><br>Come on OSI you have no more reason to have statloss. The only people who are for it are those people who aren't good enough at PVP to defend themselves. And they now have their own little happy valley which they can be 100% perfectly safe and never have to live in fear again.

They are the fastest at pointing the finger at others an accusing them of whining when they are the most guilty of it themselves. Um, why do you care who departs for the Consent-Only Land? Why are so vocal and whiny about "others" departing for the Consent-Only Land when you yourself have no interest in it? Why do you cry so much about monsters not being real challenges and that PK'ing is the only way to go to have fun then complain about people who are not interesting departing for the Consent-Only Land? Answer is clear, its all a smoke screen to cover what you really want. You want to find players who are easy to kill and have more loot on them to take then monsters. Do you see any seaonsed PvP/Guild Warfare people complaining about the departures to the Consent-Only Land? Answer is NO! All you hear are the whiny PK's who are complaining that all their cash-cow tradesmen, miners, and etc. are departing to an area which is out of reach of them.

Last night I went to a birthday part on Seige Perilous.  This wasn't just any old party though.  This was a shard-wide birthday party for Senior Counselor Lady Destiny.  It was held in the valley right outside the doors to Wrong.  You can view the pics I took <a href="http://lum.xrgaming.net/beginning.jpg">here</a>, <a href="http://lum.xrgaming.net/lag.jpg">here,</a> <a href="http://lum.xrgaming.net/conversation.jpg">here</a>, <a href="http://lum.xrgaming.net/gettingstarted.jpg">here,</a> and <a href="http://lum.xrgaming.net/daparty.jpg">here</a>.<br><br>Now let me speak here for a moment about the relationship between the counselors and the players on Seige because it truly is unique among all the other shards of UO.  Because it is a veteran's shard the 'newbie' questions are much fewer and farther between.  You can almost always find a counselor in the Britian Counselor's Guild -- sometimes even more than one.  Lady Destiny and most of the other counselors have been at every wedding, party and other RP events I've been to on Seige.  They are polite, courteous, eager to help and usually helpful.  I think you'll find many of the Seige Players agree with this assessment.<br><br>So it was no surprise to find 120-150 people at last night's party.  The invitation was made almost shard-wide.  The turnout was incredible.  This, however, in and of itself, isn't news.  <br><br>What IS news and what is particularly apropos given the talk about reds and statloss, is the amount of people from the different PVP guilds there.  Setup began at about 7pm EST and I showed up around 9.  Shadowclan, UDL, GC, CE, VJ and TAK were there doing the setup.  Not fighting, not arguing, not horsing around and sparring -- but actually making tables, benches, chairs, lanterns, candelabras -- laying out food, and, gasp!, roleplaying. Thats right they were all cooperating and having a great time putting on an event for someone we all like and respect.  <br><br>What is even more notable is that, with one brief exception when someone gated in with thier blue dragon for some unknown reason, there were no deaths and no fighting until midnight.   Even the dragon incident was roleplayed -- the orcs all got their bows out and started plinking away while yelling "fuud! fuud!" (apparently some elf had been trying to feed them vegetables). A few orcs died and were ressed without much fanfare.  The dragon was taken away.  Other than that there were NO other incidents until midnight when the party was breaking up and the reds could not contain themselves any longer.  But even then -- they didn't start pking.  The moved off to the side and started fighting amongst themselves.  One could hardly blame them -- a veritable feast of willing opponents all in the same spot.  If I were a pvper I would have been fighting right beside them.<br><br>When I read all the hoopla concerning the new faction system and the concern coming from those who are upset about stat loss remaining in the game and compare that with last night one word springs immediately to mind -- responsibility.  Why does the no stat loss system on SP work?  Because PVPers take responsibility for their actions.  I am a merchant who must walk almost everywhere.  I am rarely pk'd these days.  Why not?  Because people know I'm a merchant and they leave me alone.  They know I can't compete, won't present a challenge, and don't want to fight.  Which is not to say that people don't get pk'd on SP because they do.  I imagine my Lum 'fame' gets me out of more than a few tight spots.  <br><br>However it leads me to believe something I've always wondered about.  Would we ever have had to have stat loss in the first place if PKers had just been responsible about their actions?  No.  Would we have it today if they were willing to be responsible?  No.  Would they even be upset about this if they were willing to be responsible?  No.  The people upset about stat loss don't want to take responsibility for their actions.  They want to kill whoever they want, where ever they want, as many times as they want, for whatever reason they want.  For some reason they think they should have the right to behave like this even though they comprise the smallest group of payers and, therefore, make up a smaller portion of OSI's profit.  <br><br>If I don't want to be pk'd I should stay in town.  Or in Barneyland.  Why?  Does this mean 1/2 of the game should not be available to me?  I can't go see the critters and lands that are in that 1/2 of the game and if I try you'll fry my lilly white ass?  If I, and other people that don't wish to pvp, comprise more than half of UO's paying customer base, what possible reason does OSI have for denying me 1/2 of the game?  I think this is what more than a few people are failing to understand.  If you want to be irresponsible with respect to the majority of customers, you are going to have to suffer the consequences.

Just read BV's latest sets of <a href="http://www.battlevortx.com/">updates</a>. While made before the latest of my Never Ending Bashing Of Reds series, I think some clarification is called for in response.<br><br>You want me to put on my Tan Death Robe and give my unvarnished opinion as opposed to some wacko attempt at journalism? Fine. May be the last time anyone ever asks for <B>that</b>, but here goes.<br><br>I used to play a red. I used to kill people. For every reason given below. Well, I don't think I was ever a twink PK, but every other reason. Whether because I was playing my role and someone offended the memory of a long dead <a href="http://www.mondain.org/">crazed wizard</a>, or because I just wanted a quick adrenaline hit that whacking people in the bottom of Shame brings you, I killed people. Not only that, I was a dex monkey, so as any old schooler would tell you, I not only killed people, I killed them in an extremely cheesy manner (OK, so I really just enjoyed watching people's UOE AutoRecall macros go off and fail). <br><br>Now, I'm not under any illusions here. No one ever walked up to me and said "Oh, please, would you kill me? It would help make my gaming experience complete." Most folks went to great lengths to avoid being killed. That's why I carried a dagger with deadly poison on it, so that they wouldn't have that option. And of course, trying to roleplay evil in UO nicely tends to have its own <a href="http://www.mpog.com/kos/thug1.html">problems</a>.<br><br>As P. J. O'Rourke, a man I can only ever try to be as funny as, once wrote, this is all starting to sound like a support group for Great Danes who want to stop mauling children. Rex: "Ya know when ya get a little baby in yer mouth and they kinda move to and fro and you have to bite down just a liiiitle bit?" Spike: "Ya! Ya! Ya! Ya!" Rex: "Yeah, we shouldn't do dat." <br><br>I don't think PKs should go away. I think they should be rare. If everyone's a PK blowing away everyone else that moves, you don't have a virtual world any more, you have a clickfest - a really slow version of Diablo. There is a place for PKs in the world - just not <b>much</b> of a place. And statloss is a braindead, stupidly punitive, 30 megaton nuclear warhead of a penalty. That works. <br><br>Take Siege Perilous, for example. No stat loss. Yet the place isn't overrun with twinks. Why is that? Well, Siege isn't very twink friendly. Even though the lack of stat loss may be attractive, RoT and the inability to make thousands of gold by mass escorting or macroing skullcaps or whatever (all of which migrated to the other shards since -- gee) has inhibited the twink factor. There still are grief players... but it's manageable.<br><br>Now look at Test Center. Another place without stat loss (well, if you can set your own stats at a whim stat loss is kinda meaningless) and instant character building. And the place is grief player heaven. You can't walk three steps without bumping into D3WD5 1 through 12 inclusive. <br><br>What's the answer? Well, I don't know - these long drawn out articles are my version of trying to brainstorm until we find one. But until then, as long as I read the latest whining about the "pissy newbies" on the Dev Board before it's moderated out of existence, yes, I'm going to be embarassed I ever was red, and you're going to see less of Death Robe Boy and more of Pissy Journalist.

The red community of UO (and yes, there is one) is in an uproar. For the Promised Land has a nice, big &#8220;No dogs or Reds allowed&#8221; sign on it.<br><br>As the details of the new &#8220;Enhanced PvP&#8221; lands filter out of Origin, it has finally hit the Reds of UO that their kind is not to be encouraged in the New Order. PvP does not mean PK&#8230; so many people have said this for so long, now it seems that Origin finally believes them. The new faction system is already under attack in the usual places for being &#8220;a sop to roleplayers&#8221;, as if every new addition to UO has to be either &#8220;For PKers&#8221; or &#8220;For Roleplayers&#8221; The question among reds is &#8220;what&#8217;s in it for us? Where is OUR land?&#8221;<br><br>Sorry folks. PKers don&#8217;t get their own land. You see, being a PK isn&#8217;t a lifestyle choice or a valid way of playing the game. Being a PvPer is. Being a PKer isn&#8217;t.<br><br>A PvPer sees the new faction system and immediately says &#8220;Cool!&#8221; and begins plotting the conquest of their shard. A Pker doesn&#8217;t see the victim that they can prey upon, so immediately thinks they are being left out (which of course, they are). <br><br>You see, the unspoken part of the PK equation is that there has to be a victim. Just like good Catholic boys need bad Catholic girls if they ever expect to get beyond second base, the PK requires a victim to be a PK. If there is no victim, there is no PK. <br><br>So what the Pkers are complaining about is that their victims are being taken away. They can&#8217;t kill the  miners any more &#8211; they&#8217;re in Barneyland now merrily actually daring to enjoy themselves. They can&#8217;t fight the factions because, you know, that would be gay and stuff (plus they might lose). The victim of the PK is gone. The oxygen of the PK is gone. What we are hearing now are choking noises.<br><br>Some of those choking noises come from Dread Lord Adrick. He said, in a post on <a href="http://www.battlevortex.com/">Battle Vortex</a>, <br><br><font color="#77ff77">End this opportunistic no balls approach to pvp and let us make our own fiction. Keep the newbies and uninterested out of it but make the rest accountable for their actions. Get rid of this fool idea stat loss and let us play again the way we want. Miners and lumberjacks should do their thing in pvp- lands, let us do our thing in the pvp+ lands</font><br><br>Now, as I&#8217;m sure Dread Lord Adrick will tell you in four part harmony with Dread Lord Fear accompanying on percussion, stat loss is not an acceptable way to make Dread Lords accountable for their actions in their eyes. Fine. I&#8217;ll buy that.<br><br>Except.<br><br>Except.<br><br>If there is no penalty for Pking &#8211; which, remember, requires victims &#8211; you don&#8217;t get murder counts off of the willing, you don&#8217;t get murder counts off of opposing factions or guilds &#8211; you get them from <b>murdering other people without their consent</b> &#8211; then, as UO: The Sociology Experiment proved in 1998, everyone will be a PK, because it&#8217;s no fun to play the victim. <br><br>So... unless Dread Lord Adrick has a hidden cache of victims somewhere, there's a flaw in this argument. Without victims, you don't have PKing. Without PKing, stat loss isn't a problem, because people who don't PK don't suffer stat loss. My prediction is that there will be far fewer actual reds &#8211; PvPers will join the faction system, where opposing factions cannot give murder counts, and PKers will find that their human spawn points have dried up. Because the hidden class of the PK world &#8211; the victim &#8211; is going away.<br><br>UO is changing. What was once a world of gang warfare, where guild A beats on guild B for no apparent reason followed shortly by looters from guilds C and D, becomes closer to UO&#8217;s original design of a virtual world, with groups of fighters based around centers of power, be it physical, economic, or both.<br><br>UO is no longer the Gangsta&#8217;s Paradise, and it never will be again.

The next part of UO:R was <a href="http://update.uo.com/design_175.html">announced</a>, and it's a big one, folks. Go read it NOW.<br><br>Back? Good. For those of you who can't follow instructions, four factions are to be established in the "Enhanced-PvP area". Those factions can take over the cities of Britannia, in a sort of Capture-the-Flag UO game.<br><br>If taken to its logical conclusion, this is the backbone for a revitalization of Ultima Online. Up to this point PvP in UO has either been PK attacks on innocents to gather resources, or guild-based "gang wars". The system announced today actually gives player combat in UO a viable context -- imagine the forces of evil storming Trinsic, like the recent event. Only those are other players, not endless orcs. And the battle's resolution is dependent on the players involved, not a preset script.<br><br>Take this even further. The faction system promises that players will actuall be allowed control over the economic aspects of the city itself. What happens if on one shard, a faction is dominant? If, say, the forces of Minax take over <b>the entire shard</b>. The other factions may, if they're wise, gang up and try to overthrow their rule. But on another shard, Lord British's forces hold sway over most of the world. And on another shard, it's a see-saw battle, with the advantage to no side at all.<br><br>You want immersion in the world? Even if you're not into pvp - imagine having to read the Town Cryer website just to find out where it's safe to peddle your wares. <br><br>Obviously, there's a <b>lot</b> of issues raised by these concepts, and just as many possible exploits raised by them. But whatever happens, Ultima Online just got a great deal more interesting... for everyone. <br><br><b><a href="http://lum.xrgaming.net/ubb/Forum2/HTML/000124.html">Discuss the implications of the new system here</a></b><br></font></td></tr></table><br clear=left><br><a name="newsitem952041779,11040,"></a>

In the extreme cases where someone doesn't materialize after 4 or 5 tries, we would usually teleport them to this Island and for some reason they appear.

The long and short of it is, we used the Island to transport people that we were helping, only because no one else could interfere with our work.

Lots of good feedback on my "Mother, Please" piece. Took me over two weeks to write, and it still feels incomplete.

No recall/gating for aggressors, no blue mules for reds, etc. Someone else posted the thought on CoB of murder victims being given one-shot runes that home in on their killers.<br><br>This is all well and good, but it doesn't really cut to the heart of the matter. The problem is that, well, there's a fairly large subset of the playerbase that plays <b>solely</b> to make people miserable. The grief players.<br><br>Before rep/stat loss, they were PKs. When rep/stat loss went in, they were Noto PKs. As the noto system was fine-tuned, they turned to looting. I have every confidence that, given a world which <a href="http://update.uo.com/design_174.html">step by step attempts to eliminate every possibility of looting and noto PKing</a>, these grief players will find some way to be assholes.<br><br>It happens in <b>every</b> online game, not just UO. EQ is supposedly as hardcore anti-grief player as you can get. It was designed that way. And in EQ people kill steal, they training mobs onto unsuspecting victims, and at higher levels simply deny you the chance to actually play by controlling the high level zones for themselves. People will find the quickest, easiest way to be an ass.<br><br>Adrick and Fear, the "Battlevortex Boyz", as Arcadian Del Sol termed them, have made themselves the spokesperson for the Misunderstood Red, the Dread Lords misty-eyed with memories of The Perfect Game, cruelly stolen from them in the dead of night. <br><br>Yet, let's boil down the argument, shall we? They want stat loss for murders to go away. Rephrased: they want the ability restored to kill without consequence.<br><br>You see, stat loss is the consequence for an action. If you kill someone in game without what the rules see as proper justification, your victim has the option of giving you a murder count. To avoid stat loss, avoid that action. It's a simple concept -- so simple that Noto PKs have mastered it.<br><br>Now then, what behavior is punished by stat loss? Let's break it down into a few categories:<br><br>(1) "Serial killers" - people who kill anyone, anytime for any, or no reason.<br>(2) PKs - people who harvest resources for profit. Those resources happen to be other players.<br>(3) <a href="http://klaknak.everquest.gamestats.com/nuggets/charter.shtml">Nuggets of Justice</a> - people who feel the need to smite idiots, regardless of some silly k'nigget rules system. (Note - my Reds usually fell into this category)<br>(4) Roleplayers - yes, roleplayers occasionally feel the need to kill people as part of some <a href="http://www.mondain.org/cgi/library.cgi?action=read&topic=10114150942">bizarre ongoing saga</a>.<br><br>So the question then is - given these four typical reasons for a Red to be Red, which of these behavior types do we want to suppress, and which do we want to encourage?<br><br>Well, I think we can all agree that serial killers are bad. Stat loss encourages serial killers to have <a href="http://www.geocities.com/Area51/Crater/8139/disposable_red.html">characters that suck</a>. So in this case stat loss works. It introduces consequences for behavior that we all agree should be discouraged.<br><br>Roleplayers, on the other hand, are good. Everyone should be a roleplayer. If you are not a roleplayer, your character should be destroyed. Well, OK, not really. And I don't think Origin thinks that, either, PK conspiracy theories notwithstanding. Regardless, player death in a roleplaying environment should not be penalized with stat loss. In this case stat loss doesn't work. It is a penalty for behavior which shouldn't be penalized. However, if you talk to most red roleplayers, they don't have a problem with stat loss. It may be a pain in the ass personally, but they (a) understand what unrestricted murdering was doing to the UO community, (b) tend by their "roleplaying" status to be pillars of said UO community, and (c) are all playing Siege Perilous now anyway, so don't really care what happens to you.<br><br>Next, we come to the Nuggets of Player Justice - the person who has a halberd and sometimes just <a href="http://www.mpog.com/kos/dewdz.html">can't help but use it</a>. This is the Grey Area -- basically, justifiable homicide. You can't code justifiable homicide into a rules system. The problem is really that there's no way in-game to give someone a fat lip. You can't bop someone on the head and have it have any meaning. You can either ignore someone or kill them. This is why the developers say they decided on the number of murder counts they did... if you killed 4 people in 40 hours of play, that was considered normal and healthy. (Hopefully they don't see this as happening in real life. "Your honor, I've only killed 2 people this week, so I should be let go.") <br><br>Given that rationale, stat loss works because player justice is removed from stat loss. Of course, if you kill too many people, well, then you've moved beyond Player Justice to Player Killing and fall under the last category that I've avoided until this paragraph.<br><br>PKing is a valid playstyle in UO. In fact, it is the most profitable, unless you happen to have a GM Fisherman. The most brutally efficient way of gathering resources in UO is to have someone else gather them for you, then kill them. Now, the question is - is this something to be encouraged, or discouraged?<br><br>The rationale of "the Battlevortex Boyz" is that PKs are necessary - without them there is no risk. <b>It's a public service!</b> Without risk, the game is boring. Barneyland, Candyland, whatever. <br><br>It's nice, in theory. Now, who wants to be the victim?<br><br>What? No one wants to play the victim? Come on, people, it's a necessary part of the game! Can't have wolves without sheep for them to prey on! Where's all the victims?<br><br>Oh, they went to the consent-only lands? Or games with PK switches? Whoops.<br><br>As a perceptive reader posted in response to the last story:<br><br><font color="#77FF77">The GREAT OLD DAYS DEPENDED on a MASS of HOPELESS INNOCENTS being readily killable by a few hardcore players. It was that which made the PK's stand their ground when attacked and made sure they had masses of loot to lose.<br><br>In fact NO GAME will produce this sort of dynamic ever again simply because the only reason the HOPELESS INNOCENTS even played UO with its lack of protections was the lack of any alternative.</font><br><br>The sheep banded together and told God "defang the damn wolves already!". And God looked down, and said "OK."<br><br><b><a href="http://lum.xrgaming.net/ubb/Forum2/HTML/000119.html">Continue the discussion</a></b><br></font></td></tr></table><br clear=left><br><a name="newsitem951980443,32747,"></a>

Damion Schubert, posting as "Ubiq", had some things to say in a <a href="http://www.nethergate.com/cgi-bin/UltraBoard/UltraBoard.pl?Action=ShowPost&Board=Gen&Post=34&Idle=20&Sort=0&Order=Descend&Page=0&Session=">thread at nethergate.com</a> about the economy of ORPGs.<br><br><font color="#77FF77">Virtually any game with any level of persistence has an economy built into it. These economies may not necessarily be realistic, in terms of 'how does an alligator hold gold coins anyway'? However, they are extremely realistic in terms of answering to the core principles of supply and demand - trade is brisk for items and services that are hard to acquire, moreso if these items are actually required to cast a spell or perform an action. Examples include colored sandals and housing locations in Ultima Online, and it has evidenced itself as the Auctioning of Spawn Camping Rights in other games.<br><br>On a couple of occasions, I've witnessed a game where gold became quickly devalued overnight - usually through the use of a dupe bug. In these cases, players are quick to abandon the gold standard and use some other rare, controlled non-dupable item in their daily transactions. This is an entirely realistic reaction to a problem that has been known to happen in real life. <br><br>Understanding the economics of the MMPRPG that you're making is pretty important if you want to have any luck at all channelling player behavior towards behavior you find desirable, and away from behavior that you don't. In our case, our goal is to find ways to increase the demand for craftsmen so that adventurers need their services more, without making life a total pain in the rear for those adventurers. =)</font><br><br><b><a href="http://lum.xrgaming.net/ubb/Forum2/HTML/000122.html">Well yes, but how much does a robot arm cost?</a></b><br></font></td></tr></table><br clear=left><br><a name="newsitem951973385,48227,"></a>

Let's talk about penalties. Specifically, as our test case, stat loss for murderers in UO.<br><br>Ultima Online did not launch with stat loss, or even the concept of murderers. You were free to do whatever you wished, whenever you wished, to whomever you wished. <br><br>The result? <a href="http://www.battlevortex.com/">Some would have you believe</a> this was the golden age of Ultima Online, when Dread Lords and Great Lords battled the good fight in the streets and all was well with the world. Unfortunately, as Peter Smith wrote on <a href="http://www.cdmag.com/Home/home.html?article=/articles/014/141/local_echo.html">cdmag.com</a> in 1998:<br><br><font color="#77FF77">The idea was a good one. Create a world, populate it with creatures, with an ecosystem, and with the skeleton of an economy. Then turn it over to the players to rule as they see fit. That was one of the basic tenets of the Ultima Online design team. A hands-off policy.<br><br>It failed, of course. To be sure UO is still in operation, but the vibrance is gone from the world and my guess is that, though it is less than a year old, it is already seeing the twilight of its existence. Oh, it will survive until one of its serious competitors (Microsoft's Asheron's Call or Sony's Everquest being the most likely) drives the final nail in its coffin. And even then, as Origin Systems Inc. pulls the plug a devout few will fume and curse at the loss of the world of which they've become so much a part. <br><br>It didn't have to be this way. OSI came so close to hitting the mark that it gave us a glimmer of what could...no, what will be, when someone gets it right. But they erred in their judgment of us, the gaming community. They gave us too much credit - assumed that we were honorable people who would play within the rules set forth, rather than strive so hard to twist them.</font><br><br>Luckily for Origin's bottom line, shortly after this article was written the Notoriety and Reputation patch was implemented. For those two of you unfamiliar with UO, this penalized player killers by implementing "stat loss"... player killers were defined as "murderers" using a reporting system, and if a player died with too many murders on his record, his character lost a significant portion of stats and skills. In a skill-based game like Ultima Online, this is one small step short of simply deleting the character in terms of the gravity of the penalty.<br><br>This redefined the style of grief players, and not necessarily for the better. While a small hardcore minority of players continued to play as "reds" subject to stat loss if they were unlucky enough to die, most "k3wld3wds" became that particularly vile subspecies of player known as the "Noto PK". These players rode the edges of the Notoriety system, continuing to be as antisocial as ever, but in "accepted by the rules" ways. They wouldn't attack you and kill you outright -- unless you crossed a guarded door. Or cast a field spell they could run into. Or whatever else was the noto exploit flavor of the month. <br><br>Players learned and adapted, and the UO developers learned and adapted, and the d3wds learned and adapted. The current favorite d3wd pastime is that of the "<a href="http://galad.drtwister.com">looter</a>", someone who simply waits for someone to die, cleans out their corpse, and leaves. Of course, if the looter can actually somehow expedite said mark's death, so much the <a href="http://galad.drtwister.com/uopics07.html">better</a>.<br><br>And of course, looters rarely suffer stat loss. There is no penalty for looting, or for noto PKing. You can, of course, simply kill the offending pimple in question. But they can then report you for murder, under the Notoriety system. Enough "player justice" and you become red, wondering when you will suffer stat loss.<br><br>So, the question then presents itself, is stat loss a failure? In some ways, yes, it does now serve to penalize those who actually play by the spirit of the game as opposed to the letter. But then, look at UO today vs UO in 1998, at the height of the "Dread/Anti" days. You literally could not set foot outside guarded territory without being slain. Literally. PKs would hide outside the gates waiting for some newbie foolish enough to try. People who complained about this rampant slaughter of the unwilling were told to "stay inside guard zones, newb" (then, as now, being a "newbie", or someone not obsessively playing the game for hours to achieve mastery of its mechanics, is considered some sort of insult). <br><br>This was rapidly killing Ultima Online. As the writer above noted, humanity in general wasn't ready to be trusted. They needed rules. <b>They were incapable of policing themselves</b>.<br><br>Let's look at the other side of the coin, from someone who's quite outspoken about the nature of statloss, Adrick of <a href="http://www.battlevortex.com/">Battle Vortex</a>. Here's what he has to say:<br><br><font color="#77FF77">Looking back on the long long time I have spent in UO I remember what was so fun about the game - <br><br>It was new - never seen a game like this before<br>It was hard - so much to do and figure out<br>It had good and evil - some people you knew were out to get you - some you knew were your friends<br>It had politics and community - guilds, antis, pks all kinds<br><br>Some people might take this the wrong way but If I had one single thing to do over again in the game - I would have continued to play the game as it was intended - taken stat loss and quit. The Siege perilous shard has been the only saving grace that has attracted my attention to continue playing.<br><br>When rep hit the game became a macro/cash game of nothing but maxing out a character amidst no danger and no global/all encompassing design. It digressed into twink city and lost its uniqueness as a game.<br><br>Since then I have been searching for a reason to exist in Ultima. I have found it on siege but even that lacks the timing of what we had going when rep hit. Rep was a huge slap in the face to me and my entire guild because as we understood it we were playing the game as intended. The idea that what we were doing was wrong or the incorrect way to play the game just bothers the hell out of me. Now I know the rep patch wasnt targeted specifically for my type of playstyle but it was a nuke and we all were casualties of that huge devastating patch.<br><br>So here comes the pvp- and pvp+ lands and my only question is why not just make half the servers pvp and half pvp-? Are they going to leave stat loss in? Will Siege prosper if they do?<br><br>My fondest memories of UO will always be February 98 till May 98 - that was when more fun could be had in one night than in years of playing hundreds of other games.<br><br>Bring back the fun OSI - bring back Dread Lords and let there be a true virtual world where ALL can play and have fun again. The players need a challenge - let them challenge each other again and let us make our own quests and fun.....</font><br><br>He has some good points. What behavior does stat loss seek to redress? What behavior does it inhibit?<br><br>"Player justice" is the one point most often brought up that is hindered by the existence of stat loss. If someone walks into Kazola's Tavern, say, and begins to verbally and obscenely list what he'd like to do to the female players present, really the only options are to (a) ignore him or (b) kill him. The Yew Militia don't make house calls. You can't give him a ticket. You could possibly page a counselor and have said player recieve a stern talking to. But really, your option is limited to (a) ignore or (b) kill. And if you (b) kill, you will get (c) reported. Too many times and you will be (d) red. Thus player justice is inhibited. <br><br>But let's take a serious look at this. How often did player justice take place in the "Dread/Anti" days? When someone killed off all the miners in Minoc, did a stern collection of vigilantes show up to police the premises? Uh, no. It's a dirty secret of the dread/anti days, but "Dreads" and "Antis" were often played by the same person. One red, one blue -- one white, one black. The "Anti PKs" were simply the Blue Team, who went after the Red Team. The people in the middle, the merchants, tradesmen and newbies who weren't equipped to exist in a free-fire zone, were ignored. No one raised the banner of resistance to save them, no one defended their activities, no one gave a shit. And most of them quit the game.<br><br>Myself included. I was one of those miners in Minoc, you see. I didn't start playing UO again until after the Rep patch made the game playable for a merchant, almost a year later. I didn't know of any guilds that were acting in my defense. There weren't any players who sought to make money off of defending merchants. In fact the only players I knew on a regular basis that weren't fellow miners were idiots like Rian Garn and Lord I who spent their game figuring out how best to make people miserable and quit. Nothing was ever done about them -- even when they exploited their way into my wife's house, killed her, killed her horse, put on her dress, and pranced around her corpse emoting rape messages. Even when GM Ironwill called them on the phone pleading with them to stop. Player justice? Hell, there wasn't even gamemaster justice. And these are the days that others wax nostalgic about, mind you.<br><br>The problem is that Rian Garn and Lord I could exist quite comfortably in the Reputation patch world as well. Presumably not as blatantly, mind you -- Origin has done a much better job of idiot control in the passing of years (and staff). But still, you have players who have as a declared purpose the desire to make others miserable, and drive them out from the virtual community.<br><br>Stat loss doesn't fix this. GMs can't fix this. Nothing can fix this. You can't legislate common sense or maturity. You can't name-filter the AzZmaSterZ out of the game. You can't make the Magic Rule that eliminates Noto PKs. <br><br>Stat loss doesn't work. Yet it's necessary.<br><br>Why is it necessary? Because of perception. There are <b>perceived</b> to be fewer PKs in UO. There probably aren't -- especially if you count Noto PKs, which I do -- but the <b>perception</b> is that the world has gotten better, a touch more civilized. The beast that is the player unleashed is at least somewhat curbed. He can still curse at you, he can still totally destroy any delusion of immersion in a role-playing environment, and he can still steal you blind when you're not looking -- but he can't outright kill you without penalties.<br><br>What we need to think about isn't how to get rid of stat-loss. It's here to stay, folks. What we need to think about is how to shift the penalties that stat loss represent off the backs of those who seek to play the game the way it was intended -- the Adricks, Fears, and Evocares over at Battle Vortex who want nothing more than the opportunity to fight the good fight without wondering what the hell counter is going to increment the wrong way and totally destroy their character. What we need to think about is how to penalize the punks who seek to ruin the game of others, while rewarding those who seek to build on other's works.<br><br>It's an impossible task, of course. <br><br><i>We've tried potions and waxen dolls, but none of us could find any cures,<br>Mother please, is it just a disease, that has them breaking all my laws,<br>Check if you can disconnect the effect and I'll go after the cause<br>No one will tell what this is about<br>But I will find out<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will.</i><br>-- "Moribund The Burgomeister", Peter Gabriel<br><br><b><a href="http://lum.xrgaming.net/ubb/Forum2/HTML/000119.html">So, what do you think?</a></b><br></font></td></tr></table><br clear=left><br><a name="newsitem951946087,26473,"></a>
