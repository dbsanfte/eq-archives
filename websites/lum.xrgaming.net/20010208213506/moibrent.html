  <p> 
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">[PvP] What exactly do you do for 
    Origin Systems? </font>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#CCCCFF">[LadyMOI] I am 
    the Online Community Manager.</font>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">[PvP] Wow! What does that mean? 
    </font>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#CCCCFF">[LadyMOI] Basically 
    that means that I establish relationships with the people who run the fansites... 
    I try to keep them informed of the latest changes to our website, and our 
    service. I look for new content for our website, for instance.. the spotlights 
    and the screenshots of the week.. the tips of the day.</font>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">[PvP] So you have a direct hand 
    in what sees the light of day on owo.com? </font>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#CCCCFF">[LadyMOI] Yes... 
    at the end of the day, I'm responsible for all the content on the site. But 
    I don't personally create it all. I also keep close tabs on what happens on 
    the fansite boards from day to day. Internally, I share with the other members 
    of the service what the hottest issue every day is.. and how the players are 
    reacting.</font>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">[PvP] You try to keep your finger 
    on the pulse of the player base? </font>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#CCCCFF">[LadyMOI] Exactly. 
    If the players care enough about it to talk about it, then it's important 
    for us to know it. </font>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">[PvP] How do you feel about fan 
    sites that deal with rumors, and rants? </font>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#CCCCFF">[LadyMOI] I think 
    they're highly entertaining! </font>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">[PvP] Do you feel the help or hinder 
    the selling of the game? </font>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#CCCCFF">[LadyMOI] Well, 
    I don't have any direct evidence on how they impact the sales... but... in 
    my opinion, it demonstrates a true passion for the game. There is a thin thin 
    line between love and hate, and at the end of the day, I would prefer the 
    extremes than some kind of ambivalent neutrality. </font>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">[PvP] Today's main story on the 
    website (the content of which you have a hand in creating) was in regards 
    to the termination of an Origin employee. Why run that story? </font>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#CCCCFF">[LadyMOI] There 
    is a great deal of trust that must exist between a company, its employees, 
    and its customers. We're dealing with a service here that is based on that 
    trust. Origin is unwilling to tolerate people who abuse that trust, and Origin 
    is committed to the continual improvement of our customer support. I've been 
    running a story every week on how we're doing that... I started with a story 
    about the upcoming patch, followed by the companion program, followed just 
    today by the new Ultima Messenger.</font>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">[PvP] But the Lead story for most 
    of the day read "Ultima Online Customer Service Employee Terminated&quot;.</font>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#CCCCFF">[LadyMOI] I ran 
    the story on the termination because I felt that it demonstrates how seriously 
    we take this committment to customer service. </font>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">[PvP] Don't you think that's a 
    little sensastionalistic? </font>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#CCCCFF">[LadyMOI] What 
    would your recommendation have been, had you been in control? </font>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">[PvP] That depends on what I was 
    trying to acomplish. If I was trying to get reader interest up for the day 
    I would leave it as is. </font>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#CCCCFF">[LadyMOI] My intention 
    was to make it as devoid of emotion as possible. </font>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">[PvP] If I were commenting on an 
    important company policy such as how seriously we take Customer Support.... 
    </font>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#CCCCFF">[LadyMOI] Oh, I 
    see where you are headed. No, I can tell you with utter authority that the 
    story was not run to generate hits. </font>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">[PvP] It seems more like you were 
    trying to make news, rather than report news. Okay, moving on.... </font>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#99CCFF">[LadyMOI] :) </font>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">[PvP] What Hollywood actress do 
    you most resemble? </font>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#CCCCFF">[LadyMOI] Hahah! 
    I'm told Neve Campbell. Her and... the girl that plays Joey on Dawson's Creek. 
    Katie Holmes. </font>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">[PvP] Have you ever seen Wild Things? 
    If so did the last scene make you uncomfortable? </font>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#CCCCFF">* LadyMOI cackles. 
    </font>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">[PvP] Okay... that's a stupid question. 
    </font>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#CCCCFF">[LadyMOI] *chuckle* 
    </font>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">[PvP] Have you ever wanted to sneak 
    in on Raph Koster while he was sleeping and give him a shave and a haircut? 
    </font>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#CCCCFF">[LadyMOI] Woah! 
    </font>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">[PvP] Don't answer that. My girlfriend 
    took over the keyboard for a second. I ran her off. </font>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#CCCCFF">[LadyMOI] You may 
    want to wait till you see a picture of me before wondering if I can criticize 
    anyone else. Really... my main focus at Origin is to help people understand 
    what we're doing here. </font>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">[PvP] Do you feel that Ulitma Online 
    will ever be free of the controversy that seems to make up it's existance? 
    Is that an image that Origin wants to distance from? </font>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">[<font color="#CCCCFF">LadyMOI] 
    There is a lot of stuff that we can't say, because of company policy, and 
    so forth. But there is a lot we can say, and a lot of good relationships we 
    can build, in a community that built itself. That's what I'm interested in. 
    ;) Controversy.... interesting question. </font></font>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">[PvP] It just seems you can't go 
    a week without one popping up. </font>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#CCCCFF">[LadyMOI] Ultima 
    Online is made up of vibrant, excited human beings. This is magic. I am constantly 
    amazed at what the members of this world come up with. Yes, people like to 
    discuss things rather vehemently. Human beings like a good conflict and they'll 
    center around them whey they occur... There are a lot of really wonderful 
    things happening in UO. But, people don't hang on to good news like they do 
    on bad news. </font>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">[PvP] Boy is that true. One time 
    this girl accused me of...well, danm! I'm trying to get out from under the 
    shadow of that. It was a dark time and I would rather not discuss it. </font>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#CCCCFF">[LadyMOI] heehee... 
    On our site, we're really trying to showcase the incredible player contributions... 
    the spotlights are all about that... and we only choose one or two stories 
    out of the hundreds we receive... We started giving out Lord British awards 
    recently... Every month we give out at least 4 awards to people who are making 
    a difference in UO.</font>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">[PvP] Why have you never spotlighted 
    the incredible contribution of the <a href="http://www.mpog.com/samwise/">Samwise</a> 
    Comic Strip and or <a href="http://www.mpog.com/pvp/">PvP</a>? </font>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#CCCCFF">[LadyMOI] heh. 
    Shameless plug? </font>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">[PvP] And would you have if I was 
    hosted by the UOvault. </font>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#CCCCFF">[LadyMOI] Actually, 
    I did put a proposal together for highlighting the comics creators. It's in 
    the channels now.. you may hear from us yet. ;) </font>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">[PvP] Do you ever catch one of 
    your graphic artists reading a screenshot comic, like...say <a href="http://www.mpog.com/kos/">Killed 
    On Sight</a> and then weeping uncontrolably? Don't you think it's unfair and 
    somewhat illegal for a person to take a screenshot, edit it and call it Cartooning? 
    </font>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#CCCCFF">[LadyMOI] Hrm. 
    If I were a lawyer I might be able to comment on that. There was that artist 
    who created "found art"... he just picked up old stuff and signed his name 
    on it. Like toilets. </font>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#CCCCFF">* LadyMOI shrugs. 
    </font>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">[PvP] Yeah, but he's considered 
    to be a real Cheeze-dick in the art community. Honest. </font>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#CCCCFF">[LadyMOI] Hah hah. 
    </font>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">[PvP] One last question and I'll 
    let you go </font>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#CCCCFF">[LadyMOI] OK. </font>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">[PvP] If I did a character sketch 
    of you, would you make PvP the official Online Comic of the Online Community 
    Manager? </font>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#CCCCFF">[LadyMOI] Would 
    you make me pretty? </font>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#CCCCFF">* LadyMOI grins. 
    </font>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">[PvP] Hell, I do sketches of myself 
    all the time and I make myself thin....why not? </font>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">* PvP takes bite of a cheeseburger 
    </font>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#CCCCFF">[LadyMOI] Hahah! 
    Well, we can definately see! </font>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">[PvP] Okay. Hey thanks for being 
    a sport. I know I get silly sometimes. </font>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#CCCCFF">[LadyMOI] That's 
    okay.. I like silly. I have been accused of being "indescriminately silly." 
    </font>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">And before we wrap things up, here 
    were the questions I sent to GM Darwin. GM Darwin has yet to answer these 
    questions.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">1.) What Hollywood actor or actress 
    do you most resemble? </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">2.) Did your sales on eBay help 
    your friend out of his situation? </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">3.) Does your friend know what 
    you did to come by the money? </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">4.) Was it his idea or your idea? 
    </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">5.) If your friend had come to 
    you and let you know that his debt had been payed through another means, would 
    you have cancelled the current auctions at eBay? If not, what would you have 
    done with the money? </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">6.) Have you ever xeroxed the front 
    and back of a dollar bill, glued them together, then tried to get tokens with 
    it at Alladin's Castle? That works! </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">7.) While you were a GM, did you 
    ever get any requests from players to help them place a house? When you told 
    them that GM's were not allowed to help with that, did you feel dirty? Did 
    you even appear to them in game when you responded? </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">8.) Tell us the best thing you 
    did as a GM where you DIDN'T get caught. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">9.) If, through abusing GM powers 
    afforded by your employeer in confidence, you could really stick it to Dr. 
    Twister, would you do it? Would you regret your actions later? </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">10.) One time I worked at Things 
    Remembered® in the mall. We engraved pens for people. If we messed up the 
    engraving we had to throw the pen away. We were not allowed to keep or give 
    away any of these ruined pens. If I told you I had a pen that read "Happy 
    Birthdag" would you think less of me?</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> This is Brent Sienna reporting 
    live from the field. <a href="index.html">Back to you, 
    Lum.</a></font></p>
