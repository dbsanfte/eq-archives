      <blockquote> 

        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Anyone ever noticed how when 

          USA attacked Iraq they didnt kill all the civilians... at least tried 

          not to... the problem here is that alot of innocents were also hit by 

          the ban... and what happened to the phrase innocent till proven guilty...? 

          </font></p>

        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">OSI has banned any account 

          that was playing of the Cybercafe called Mekka... and another Cybercafe 

          too... Problem doing this is... alot of people that havent even been 

          involved in anything illegal have been banned... 10-year old kids that 

          play on Sonoma and Great Lakes and other roleplayer shards are banned... 

          people that once visited the (in-)famous players of Mekka and BT-Cafe 

          and once played from there... have also lost access... This is OSI's 

          sense of justice... and trust me they cant ever prove who duped and 

          who didnt... we have all seen it done... but very few are guilty... 

          and OSI cant honestly think that we will backstab our RL friends...? 

          </font></p>

        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">What will they do then...? 

          Well... my guess is theyll use the good old gangster-method of : "If 

          in doubt...? Shoot em all...!" </font></p>

        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">If this is how OSI thinks 

          they can treat their players theyll end up broke... and if other players 

          thinks we deserve it all of us... I will surenly make them suffer too... 

          cause OSI bans everyone we talk to on IRC... and everyone we helped 

          in game... so dont be glad... be afraid... cause OSI is coming for you 

          next... </font></p>

        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">If u think hard about this 

          situation... itll remind you of a once notorious ruler and his ways... 

          This way of ruling the game is much like how Hitler ran Germany leading 

          up to WW2... </font></p>

        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Maybe ill get banned... maybe 

          i wont... but i DO have some guildmoney in bank... so ill be banned 

          for that...? Theyll ban everyone in SUN and everyone else for having 

          a ton of money...? Let me let u in on a secret... one of the reasons 

          that SUN/TeamDK/DeathJester players have allways been good... is that 

          we know the game inside out... we play alot... and we do our best to 

          excell at the game... unlike most of the roleplayers who are content 

          at speaking a funny language and generally not knowing if they can kill 

          a mongbat or not... On any shard moneymaking is easy... eventhough some 

          think they need to make a GM tailor to gain gold... Hey newbie... try 

          killing some monsters... like Air elementals... or Bloods... then u 

          can make 80k / hrs... And therefore u have a problem... </font></p>

        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">How can u be sure that we 

          duped...? If all SUNs members had been doing the Air Ele or Blood Ele 

          trick for 5 days... for 10 hours... that would be 5*10*80k... we would 

          all of us be the owners of 4 mio GP... therefore it aint hard to place 

          castles... </font></p>

        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I rest my case... and will 

          let OSI decide what to do... no amtter what they decide... i know they 

          have never even done anything the right way... so why do it this time 

          round...? </font></p>

        DISSENTING OPINION</b></font></font></p>

      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Here's someone commenting on 

        the SUN incident from the other side. I suspect most of you will disagree 

        with some of his points:</font></p>

      <blockquote> 

        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Number one, in my mind its 

          Origins fault there is a dupe. Why you ask? Well because they are stupid 

          and they always kiddy corner thier code. For example, thier magic fix 

          for animals going wild upon transfer is "transfer" is now "friend" its 

          the same code cut and pasted. Notice they didnt even attempt to fix 

          it until there was a way to "exploit" it to gain animal taming quickly. 

          They cant even fix reactive armor without somthing else related to the 

          spell re-breaking. Number two, this dupe has been around on Siege since 

          it first came up. Many people knew about it, only the idiots exploited 

          it to the max and got busted. (prime example is to why Denmark is not 

          a world power) I guarentee for the 30 people who were banned there are 

          50 more with over three million gold in the bank and many other items, 

          I promise. Number three, there are so many bugs on SP its not even funny 

          (unless you use them, then its a crackup). You think this was the only 

          dupe? There are at least six more item specific dupes around (among 

          other big bugs), none of which rely on the method used to dupe generic 

          stackables. Wonder how he got 30k arrows without this particular dupe, 

          hmmmm, mabey there is a way to combine feathers and shafts without using 

          the feather or shafts and placing 1 arrow in your pack. Macro that over 

          a couple days and you have a GM archer. All of these "new" bugs on Siege 

          were around at one point or another on the other public shards, OSI 

          just never retrofitted the old code. In addition you may want to reccomend 

          they check into thier billing software, I havent paid for UO in eight 

          months. They have bugs EVERYWHERE!</font></p>

        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In all video (and otherwise) 

          games there are the cheaters and the non-cheaters. I know most people 

          arent cheaters, thats only because theyve never been given the opertunity. 

          I dont know if you ever played Street Fighter 2 or games like that but 

          there were always where you could keep your opponent in the corner the 

          whole round and they couldnt do a thing about it. Eventually everyone 

          knew the method and it ruined the game. Then again it was fun while 

          it lasted. Kind of like the direction UO is going, this shard was supposed 

          to be a challange. The only challange it provides for a lot of people 

          is the challange of how to cheat the system. Insted of spending time 

          chooping wood or mining ore we spend hours figuring out exploits. </font></p>

        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I guarentee that if the population 

          of siege knew about this dupe, and knew they wouldnt get banned for 

          it 97% would use it. This game will never be bugless, therfore there 

          will always be cheaters. The cheaters always win, for every one cheater 

          that gets banned there are 50 more who can still login. </font></p>

          OSI can't prove we, your mom, Tom's father or ANYONE duped, you see 

          it's not possible for them to see whick STACKABLE items are duped and 

          which aren't, they know this, they are blocking our accounts until they 

          fix the bug, if we mention the word lawsuit that should be enough to 

          unban us since, according to what they can prove, no one ever duped

          of this morning...outta curiosity and since I had their irc channel 

          I hopped in it...took them a long while before someone realized that 

          I wasn't a part of the guild and kicked me but not before the below 

          was stated...now I don't care if anyone believes me or not...what's 

          cut and pasted below is EXACTLY what was said in chat directly cut and 

          pasted from it and NOT edited whatsoever...I went in there to find proof 

          for MYSELF and this was enough for me...I've since tried getting back 

          in but now I'm immediately kicked...hehe... </font></p>

        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">It was posted on the U.Hall 

          message board by a friend of mine who I sent the cut and paste to...I 

          myself e-mailed it to Callandryl who in turn asked for their irc channel 

          which I gladly mailed back to him...I just hope some of this has helped 

          and they're stopped...I'm sending this to you because on your webpage 

          it was asked what happened to their guildtower and such...well this 

          tells ya... </font></p>

        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The only thing I can say 

          that might help ya believe I didn't edit this is the fact that I know 

          no one in this guild whatsoever nor did I know any of their members...only 

          came across one to which I can't remember his name and told him I was 

          interested in their guild...he gave me the irc channel...upon talking 

          to the gm archmage he told me to come back after I reached 90 magery...until 

          then they only allowed those in they KNEW and TRUSTED...another thing...I 

          haven't even a clue WHAT language that is their speaking below...no 

          way I could possibly edit that...*LOL* <i>(It's Danish. Much of SUN

        that the immense wealth needed for such property purchases were generated 

        &quot;by trading with other players wanting things on other shards.&quot; 

        However, a castle would cost over 3 million gold, and it's doubtful there

      <blockquote> 

        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">You know.. It's been an interesting 

          read the last day and a half. I actually have learned quite a bit from 

          it. I'm not a real big "rage against The Man" kind of person, but I 

          can see a lot of that going on here, and I suppose that's inevitable. 

          </font></p>

        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I believe it's always good 

          to try to do things nicely the first time. A bit stronger the next time, 

          then get harsh if it's warranted. I'm more than willing (as you have 

          seen) to skip a step if I get a flack from someone (as in this case). 

          If that comes off as Draconian then I guess that's life. I much prefer 

          the gracious approach... there have even been times when I've had to 

          bite my lip while writing emails telling people to stop what they are 

          doing, because a part of me actually understands it and maybe even agrees 

          with it but it still has to be done. In the end though had I recieved 

          a response asking just "why.. what's wrong with this?" I would have 

          been more than happy to explain, but still firm about the end result. 

          </font></p>

        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Is my writing that email 

          going to get the Guide Manual taken down from everywhere? Of course 

          not.. but it is important to protect Copyrighted material. Read thru 

          the manual again and you will see a lot of the same information that's 

          up on our website. There are also some things that frankly I would have 

          prefered stayed internal.. most of which are commands guides use, etc. 

          The last thing I want is everyone asking to be "/buff"ed. I'm quite 

          sure most of you could understand this if you think about it logically.. 

          I also don't want every hacker in the world to have any starting points, 

          because we have better things to do with our programmers time. </font></p>

        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">At the end of the day, I 

          don't send out a lot of emails like that exchange with Lum. If that 

          2nd email seemed harsh, well.. guess what I'm human too and just maybe 

          spending time chasing down stuff like that can get frustrating. It would 

          be nice if people like Lum would maybe send an email saying "Hey.. someone 

          just sent me this and I'd like to post it, but I'm not sure if I should.. 

          it kinda seems a bit confidential" he would have gotten a really nice 

          response from me asking him not to and explaining my reasons. </font></p>
