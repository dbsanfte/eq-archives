<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><BR>

</font>

<div><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Hello Dr. Twister, OSI people, 

  and all of the UO players out there. I apologize for the mass mail - just wanted 

  to get this to all OSI I could think of and all important UO sites. This letter 

  is written to Twister, but sent to everyone because this is getting out of hand.</font></div>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><br>

</font>

<div><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Twister,</font></div>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><br>

</font>

<div><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I am an avid player of UO and visit 

  your website often. However I enjoy your website not for the content of UO material 

  you bring, but to watch your own hypocrticial styles clash in an attempt to 

  try to bring &quot;news&quot; to the UO public.</font></div>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><br>

</font>

<div><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">You won't print this on your site 

  and probably won't even respond to it, because it will discredit you faster 

  than you have tried to discredit Origin Systems, the designers, the programmers, 

  the Game Masters, and the very game which you have been enraptured by. I only 

  hope you have the balls to not only go on reading this but to respond to ALL 

  of us, because you have trapped yourself this time for good. Due to this I have 

  added several people on OSI and within the community to read and pass this along 

  because the hypocrisy ends now.</font></div>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><br>

</font>

<div><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Only a couple of weeks ago, you 

  glamorized a specific GM for being courteous and helpful to a player named Vader. 

  That was pretty cool and different for a change, and good to see because all 

  of the GM experiences I have had were helpful and found a resolution to the 

  problem at hand. I wish more people would come to their defense, because anyone 

  that has ever had to work in customer service knows how hard it is to deal with 

  the public.</font></div>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><br>

</font>

<div><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In any case this Vader guy now 

  says that since he has a problem with the game, that not only was the GM on 

  duty that night (Darwin) useless for not finding out the problem, but the GM 

  that you mailed (Llano) in searching for answers is unhelpful as well, despite 

  his very specific detail in what actually happened with the problem.</font></div>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><br>

</font>

<div><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">This leads me to one of two conclusions: 

  1) you are not nearly as smart as you think because you eat the crap that Vader 

  sends you or 2) you are Vader on Baja (and hence still not as smart as you like 

  to to think). I am inclined to think #2, as you are rarely as passionate and 

  adamant about a subject's views. Your hints in the &quot;mails&quot; that Vader 

  sends are about as subtle as a jackhammer.</font></div>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><br>

</font>

<div><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I am not writing about the issue 

  that happened in the game - Lord knows there are still numerous bugs in it. 

  However you refuse to accept the the service provided by OSI, which is where 

  I have a problem. OSI's customer service got to the problem, saw there was nothing 

  wrong, told you that it was a result of the game's designed systems, received 

  your ranting and condescending mail, replied, offered different ways this could 

  have happened, told you that this would be reported, and then apologized for 

  not being able to interfere and take off a murder count (note: you vehemently 

  have wanted GMs to remain out of the game and never interfere). In addition, 

  if you know anything about or any other software product on the market, when 

  bugs like this are reported, they are isolated, tested, re-tested, tried to 

  be replicated, and then fixed if found. I would bet that this happened (ever 

  heard of a patch to fix something?)</font></div>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><br>

</font>

<div><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Gee that's pretty shitty and unacceptable 

  service for something that never happened.</font></div>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><br>

</font>

<div><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">When all this is said and done, 

  they probably will spend about five or six total man-hours working on a bug 

  that you reported that really wasn't ever a bug at all. Damn, you yourself question 

  and wonder why it is that no events are run or things gets don't get fixed at 

  OSI - look in the mirror, jerky. Its got a lot to do with stupid asses like 

  you bitch about things in the game that you don't understand, question how it 

  was ever done, rip support for not giving you what you want, and thusly end 

  up hogging up more OSI resources than a Microsoft product.</font></div>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><br>

</font>

<div><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Let's do some simple scary math. 

  One Twister/Vader on each shard. One Twister-size incident each week. Five man-hours 

  per Twister incident. Fourteen shards. Five x 14 = seventy man hours spent on 

  issues that really aren't even issues at all by the OSI staff. That's almost 

  two full-time employees' full work week dedicated to making sure that he is 

  happy. I don't know about you, but I'd rather let the people over there work 

  on events, quest engines, fixes, and new features.</font></div>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><br>

</font>

<div><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">You think you are helping UO, Twister? 

  Think again. They should ban you just on the principal that you are costing 

  them way more money than what you are paying.</font></div>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><br>

</font>

<div><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I highly, highly suggest that you 

  really look at what it is you are doing. You have a lot less vision than you 

  would like to think, and are so narrow-minded that anything besides what you 

  &quot;see&quot; you simply refuse to believe. I would think that the very fact 

  that 99% of us in UO have had fantastic UO and UO support experiences should 

  make you think otherwise, but then again maybe we all need to think about who 

  we are talking to.</font></div>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><br>

</font>

<div><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Let me recap it all if you couldn't 

  comprehend what I have said...</font></div>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><br>

</font>

<div><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">1) You have stated that you never 

  want GMs to interfere with the game. Yet despite a result of a game that was 

  proven to happen for reasons other than what you think, you want them to hop 

  in and give you anything you want. *hypocritical*</font></div>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><br>

</font>

<div><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">2) GM Llano provides quality support 

  and is your GM of the Year!! Two weeks later on finding out that your character 

  has no problems at all, he is an ineffective employee in customer support for 

  quickly and efficiently resolving the issue. *blind by your own wants*</font></div>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><br>

</font>

<div><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">3) GM Darwin has previously provided 

  good support, which you have posted before. Now Darwin is a real loser for going 

  to a situation, seeing that he couldn't get involved with it, and telling you 

  directly that this is a result of a game function. *ignorant*</font></div>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><br>

</font>

<div><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">4) You state that Llano is Iron 

  Will. Um who cares both of them kick ass for me (all of them kick ass actually) 

  and both have helped me and others. I don't know if he is or not (and could 

  care less), but let's see how everyone likes it when they know YOUR alter ego 

  Twister/Vader on Baja. *plain stupid*</font></div>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><br>

</font>

<div><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">5) Your stance on PvP - while you 

  would hate for PvPers to be eliminated and don't want them to be ruined, you 

  couldn't stand the fact that you ruined someone else's day by MURDERING them, 

  and that they subsequently reported you for a legitimate murder. *the pot calls 

  the kettle black*</font></div>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><br>

</font>

<div><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">For the GMs, designers, OSI people, 

  and guys in the UO community that have made it this far down, know now that 

  your game not only kicks ass, but allows for all players to play as they want. 

  You have given me and my family (yup thats right - three accounts here :)) more 

  hours of fun than we could ever get out of $30 spent anywhere else. We like 

  it, our friends like it, and everyone we run into likes it.</font></div>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><br>

</font>

<div><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">For Twisty/Vader - sorry dude, 

  you have lost it. OSI isn't perfect, but who is in your mind - Bill Clinton? 

  You hold them to a higher standard only because you are so embroiled in what 

  goes on, you created a persona that only feeds your ego and blinds your vision. 

  If I were you I would seriously re-evaluate what it is you are doing in game 

  and out of game. Personally, I'd like you to go to Everquest just so you can 

  let the rest of us have support when we actually NEED it.</font></div>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><br>

</font>

<div><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Thank you OSI for all that you 

  do for us - MOST of us appreicate it. For all of you out there that are touched 

  by the game, let OSI know about it thru mail, phone, chats, and posting. I am 

  tired of seeing lamers make noise when 99% of us are having a grand old time.</font></div>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><br>

</font>

<div><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">A grand old thanks to those that 

  work on the game and the players that make the game,</font></div>

  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In the wonderful world of EQ, on 

    my own widdle server Veeshan, there was a GM-run event where a really large 

    guild slew a dragon, which is actually a big deal, unlike in UO where dragons 

    are often victims of drive-by energy vortexes. The odd thing about this was 

    that one of the brave dragonslayers was a certain 50th level ranger named 

    Aradune. You might know him out of game as Brian &quot;When do I get the damn 

    50th level Shadowknight&quot; Hook's new boss, Brad McQuaid. A few people 

    had problems with the game's producer joining up with the guild <a href="http://www.firesofheaven.org/foh/index.htm">FoH</a> 

    and swatting the most powerful mob in the game (kind of like Designer Dragon 

    joining SiN and r0xxing Kazola's). His response, on the <a href="http://boards.vaultnetwork.com/wwwthreads.pl?action=list&amp;Board=eqgeneral">only 

    message board</a> Verant deigns to acknowledge); </font></p>

  <blockquote> 

    <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><i>I did not cheat and I used 

      a level 50 ranger who was equipped with decent OBTAINABLE level 50 items. 

      I know for a fact that I made no statistical difference in terms of the 

      outcome of the battle -- I simply don't deal out enough damage as one player. 

      </i></font></p>

    <p><i><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">And I RP'd the event as well 

      -- it was Karana's will that Vox be slain (although I honestly thought we'd 

      die -- we'll see if Vox is so easily ambushed in the future :) </font></i></p>

    <p><i><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">So, anyway, EverQuest is a 

      game where staff will take part in events. They are monitored, and their 

      activity, the rewards they give out, etc. are approved by me or someone 

      close to me. </font></i></p>

    <p><i><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">As for FoH or any guild being 

      GM twinked or given special favors... we don't tolerate that. People can 

      indeed be fired for that. And as for them abusing... let me just say that 

      FoH has been and probably will continue to be one of the most watched groups 

      of players in the game. I feel bad for them in a sense, because there is 

      almost always a GM watching them, visible or invisible, noting their progress 

      and tactics. But it simply makes sense because they are high level and encountering 

      aspects of the game first. </font></i></p>

    <p><i><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">If there are (and there will 

      be) special events in the future, either Verant planned or player created, 

      we may involve ourselves. You'll have to trust us that we care enough about 

      this game to be fair and to not use favortism. </font></i></p>

  </blockquote>

  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Rumor has it that a certain GM 

    named after the Norse god of tricksters was indeed fired for twinking players 

    in UO. For those unfamiliar with the term, &quot;twinking&quot; is the practice 

    of giving new characters a leg up, such as a 1st level fighter in EQ clanking 

    around in rubicite plate. Of course, he was almost as unpopular as another 

    certain GM named after the proponent of evolution, as a certain Doctor named 

    after common natural disasters in Oklahoma can <a href="http://www.drtwister.com/ultimaonline/uo-indx.html">attest.</a></font></p>

  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Messr. McQuaid hit precisely the 

    point when he said &quot;You'll have to trust us&quot;. Most players do NOT 

    trust support staff, whether justified or not, in either UO or EQ. There has 

    certainly been enough betrayal of trust in UO (where the GMs are currently 

    busy on Dirty Word Patrol) and EQ will undoubtably be no different. Until 

    we make contact with the Wise and Good Space Aliens From Vega and hire them 

    in customer support positions, support staff will continue to be distressingly 

    human.</font></p>

  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Speaking of selling out the players' 

    trust, we have big news here at LumCentral. Keep your eyes focused on this

  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">VoodooExtreme posted <a href="http://www.voodooextreme.com/ask/askmenu.html">another 

    article</a> from Verant's most vocal new hire, Brian &quot;MipMap Me Baby&quot; 

    Hook. In response to someone saying that EQ's world isn't interactive/persistent 

    enough, he had this to say;</font></p>

  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">But in the end, I don't 

    think Verant is trying to address the tired old MUDder like yourself. A game 

    company can make their game arbitrarily appeal stronger to a hardcore audience 

    and in turn limit their audience even more. I think EQ is introducing a lot 

    of players that didn't play RPGs into the basic concepts, and in the future 

    more players will be cognizant of the world of role playing and more advanced, 

    refined RPG systems will make their way on line. EQ is not the end goal for 

    RPGs, it's actually just the beginning of making an old genre (the RPG) come 

    up to date with modern technology and appeal to a wide range of players that 

    may not have even played pen and paper RPGs.</font></p>

  <p> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Unfortunately, the log 

    you paraphrased is very typical of #uo-council. Even if you take a basic, 

    seemingly clear-cut question like "is use of <specific program> legal", you'll 

    get 30 minutes of debate where SRCs who have some sort of interest in the 

    subject assure their underlings that it is legal while other SRCs assure *their* 

    underlings that it isn't. </font></p>

  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">I remember a two-month 

    period where people would debate whether or not EZMacros was bannable, and 

    despite tempers flaring, no GM ever said anything one way or another. When 

    they finally did, instead of saying "it's legal" or "it's bannable", they 

    would quote sections of the user agreement which where either irrelevant to 

    the subject or just plain unhelpful. When asked what their statements were 

    supposed to mean, they never elaborated. In fact, when someone pointed out 

    that Support's "moving target" approach to what is and isn't legal was irresponsible, 

    the SRCs came in and silenced debate as only a group of volunteer "authority 

    figures" can. </font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">

  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">An informant (let's call him Deep 

    Spleen) sent me a log from #uo-council (The Official Ultra Secret Counselor 

    Chat Channel Where Mere Players Dare Not Go) where the counselors debated 

    whether or not using last target in UOA was actually a bannable offense. To 

    protect Mr. Spleen's identity (spleens have a lot of bile, y'know), here's 

    a paraphrase of the log. Note that while wording and some order has been changed, 

    the... atmosphere is exactly as written.</font></p>

  <blockquote> 

    <p><b><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">OK, is last target legal or 

      not?<br>

      <i>It's legal.</i></font></b><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><br>

      A GM said it was illegal.<br>

      <b>Well, why would UOA get approved if last target wasn't legal?</b><br>

      It was approved... I think Tug limited the range last target works with 

      it.<br>

      <i>The dev team is putting last target into the client, aren't they?<br>

      <b>But guys, a GM told a player it was still bannable.</b> <br>

      </i>Bah, it was on Dr. Twister's page, don't believe it. <br>

      <i>Right.</i> <br>

      <b>The topic in channel last night was &quot;LAST TARGET IS STILL ILLEGAL&quot; 

      <br>

      <i>Well who set that topic?<br>

      </i></b><i>I'm not sure.</i><br>

      <b>We need to find a GM and get the word on this.</b> <br>

      Well, if they approved UOA surely they would have noticed if last target 

      was working.<br>

      <i>The web site says last target is illegal. If it's legal now they should 

      update the web site.<br>

      </i><b>OK GUYS LISTEN UP - GM Aradune told me that using any feature of 

      UOA is legal now; use of UOE and UOP is still a bannable offense<br>

      <i>Damn it, I wish he'd just say &quot;Last target is legal&quot;<br>

      </i></b><i>He did. He said any feature, that includes Last Target<br>

      <b>I just want a GM to say UOA, last target, and legal in the same sentence.<br>

      </b></i><b>How will people know if it's UOA or UOE? You know that's the

      different.</b></font></p>

  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Be very afraid.</font></p>

  <p><font color="#FFFF00" size="3" face="Arial"><i>06/11/99 2:30 PM </i><b>BAD 

    PKERS! NO DOUGHNUT!</b></font></p>

  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">A couple of folks emailed me asking 

    what I thought about Sir Adrick's statement on <a href="http://www.drtwister.com/ultimaonline/uo-indx.html">Dr. 

    Twister's</a> that pvpers were being specifically targeted for harassment 

    bans.</font></p>

  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">As corporate policy? No, I don't 

    think so... if OSI wanted to get rid of pvpers as a policy, it would be as 

    simple as a pvp switch, or making everyone who turns red die horribly, or 

    something similarly draconian. </font></p>

  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">However. This policy is being enforced 

    by people. People as a general rule are imperfect, and the UO GMs are pretty 

    good cases in point of this theory. Those GMs generally despise PKers, because 

    most of the calls they recieve are from victims of PKers. Thus they are going 

    to be particularly hardass towards persons who are active in PK guilds, write 

    for PK/evil/bug pages (you think they don't monitor these web sites? Think 

    again, bucko... it's part of their <i>job</i>; OSI hits this particular web 

    page daily. You think the Mushroom War confused <i>YOU?</i>). While there 

    is no written memo from Rich Vogel or Raph Koster saying &quot;OK, we want 

    you to ban 50 PKers a day until they get the message&quot;, there's no <i>need</i> 

    for one. Contrary to popular belief, GMs do occasionally have minds, and those 

    minds are minds of their own.</font></p>

  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">So what needs to be done about 

    this? Well, a list of &quot;what you can't say&quot; won't work, since of 

    course it is impossible to list all possible obscenities in every language 

    (and if so, I can always make up new ones). Dr. Twister notes two things in 

    an <a href="http://www.drtwister.com/ultimaonline/uo-indx.html">atypically 

    rational rant</a> below Adrick's; (1) UO is rated M for Mature, and the user 

    agreement every user signs off on (without reading) states that a user is 

    either over 18 or under the consent of a parent or guardian, and (2) the obscenity 

    filter defaults to ON. </font></p>

  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Both of these are good points, 

    but ultimately faulty. The second relies on a piece of programming work that 

    is even more faulty then most failed attempts at obscenity filters... hope 

    you don't ever need to say the word &quot;harassment&quot; in game! The first, 

    and more crucial, is that basically only adults should be playing Ultima Online, 

    and adults can handle obscenity.</font></p>

  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The issue isn't obscenity or maturity; 

    the issue at hand is harassment, and how it is defined by those in the field 

    tasked to eliminate it. Right now, harassment is defined <i>very</i> loosely; 

    an active player that I know (and a roleplayer, not a PKer) was given a warning 

    for saying the word &quot;rape&quot; in a sentence to a friend, in the middle 

    of a forest. Someone overheard him and reported him. </font></p>

  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">One could argue, with some justification, 

    that were the player red instead of blue, he would have been penaltyboxed 

    or possibly even banned. That's still not the issue though... the issue is 

    that the GM, when taking the report and examining the server logs that track 

    everything we say or do in UO, didn't immediately bitchslap the twink making 

    the report. </font></p>

  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">There is harassment in UO. A <b>lot</b> 

    of it. And pvpers/pkers are guilty of a great deal of it. (Of course, if what 

    PKers say/emote after a kill bothers you, by all means don't ever get on a 

    Quake server - even the server messages are likely causes of banning in UO.) 

    But harassment generally requires that someone be harassed.</font></p>

  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Take the MDK saga for example. 

    Here was a guild that made as its raison d'etre making a certain roleplayer 

    miserable. They chased her, stalked her, said bad things to her, and they 

    did some things in game as well. This is clearly harassment and they did, 

    individually, deserve banning. (Collective banning is a whole other subject, 

    but we've been there before. Check the old rants, I don't remember exactly 

    where.) There was a victim in this case; someone was prevented from enjoying 

    the game they paid for because a group of kiddies decided to be dicks.</font></p>

  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Now, there is a difference between 

    that and someone saying the word &quot;rape&quot; or &quot;jap&quot; or even 

    *gasp* &quot;fuck&quot; to a friend. <i>There is no victim here</i>. Even 

    if someone walks by and overhears, say, Lum saying to Tal, &quot;Fuck this, 

    I'm going shopping&quot;, they are not being harassed. If they are so overly 

    sensitive that seeing the word &quot;fuck&quot; bothers them, they need to 

    turn on their obscenity filter/log off/grow a clue. It is quite likely that 

    if you walk past me in real life and I am talking to a friend, I may very 

    well use language that you would disapprove of. I should change this behavior 

    in UO? My conduct should be held to a higher standard in a <i>game????</i></font></p>

  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">There are some grey areas here. 

    If I made a point of going to East Brit bank and telling an accomplice about 

    how I'm sick of all these nigger gangster PKs, my conduct would be unacceptable. 

    I am, simply put, acting like an asshole in public. At some point, this makes 

    the environment unacceptable and steps should be taken to throw me in jail 

    like the punk bitch I am. </font></p>

  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The problem here, and a problem 

    that the GMs seem uniquely braindamaged in resolving, is that judgement calls 

    are required. There is no set standard, no list that you can print out and 

    tape next to your computer monitor, that says &quot;This is not acceptable 

    behavior.&quot; At some point you have to just use common sense and say &quot;OK, 

    that's over the line, yer outta here.&quot; Major league umpires in baseball. 

    Hell, even minor league umpires do it on occasion. And an umpire is not a 

    bad role model for GMs to follow. They may get dirt kicked on their shoes 

    on occasion, but you know what? It's part of the job. </font></p>

    GOD, HE'S POSTING EMAIL AGAIN INSTEAD OF WRITING</b></font></p>

  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Got this interesting note on Japanese-American 

    relations on Hokuto:</font></p>

  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">I've been playing on 

    Hokuto for a long time now, since Day 1 the shard came up (early January I 

    think). Since I'd say a good 1/2 of the population can not speak english it 

    did make life rather complex. But hey, the free land, housing patch, low population, 

    and lack of dupers made the move from Catskills to Hokuto a joyous one. </font></p>

  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">When the shard first 

    came up, Americians were greatly feared. You walk into a dungeon and start 

    speaking english and everyone runs. I had to paralyze a few people just to 

    say hello, and they took that the wrong way... They starting trying to mana 

    drain me and other crazy stuff, and they couldn't kill a newbie if they tried. 

    The first month I literally ran into not one Jap PK. Not one.   </font></p>

  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Eventually I got know 

    a few of them and they were pretty cool. On japanese time, looting, kill stealing, 

    and pking was almost non-existant. A few good months went by and then it happened...  

    the land filled up and no one could build anymore towers or large houses. 

    Guilds were formed and players were powerful enough to begin pking. The change 

    was almost overnight and it reverbirated though out the whole shard.   </font></p>

  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">The meek little Japs 

    suddenly turned into Grandmaster Mage PKs with guilds of 20-30 players who 

    attacked in organized groups. I can tell you for fact Hokuto has a higher 

    GM Mage ratio than any other shard. Those Japs are methodical!  Americian 

    PK developed too, but here usually miner killers or solo PvPers who had short 

    lived careers. Look on the bounty board, why are 17 out of 20 pks Japs all 

    with over 500 kills each? Players fueded over land rights and it quickly devoloped 

    into an us vs them situaltion. The guild USA did not help either. It was a 

    guild with over 200 Americians that killed solo Japanese players on sight 

    all the time.   </font></p>

  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">The situations has now 

    become common place. Though USA is now gone, Americians are ill trusted and 

    some even get killed on sight for an US guild title. To make a long story 

    short, here is what I hear all the time. "I won't cheat you, I'm Japanese" 

    and Goddamnit, they are right. I can trust a Japanese guy to make fair trades 

    or not loot my corpse when I die. I can let a group of several of them I barely 

    know in my Tower and I ~know~ they will not take anything.  Try that on Pacific.</font></p>

    own site</a>.</font></p>

  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">This brings up issues, as <a href="http://www.gaminginsider.com/">BitchX</a> 

    might say, if she ever updated any more.</font></p>

  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">We can safely say now, beyond any 

    reasonable doubt, that the GMs are on a quest to make the People's Republic 

    of Everquest look like a flaming liberal bastion of free speech. I can understand 

    their side of it; there basically has been no enforced code of conduct within 

    UO for what, years now, and the dev team finally gave the support team the 

    tools to do the job, aka the server-side journal entries such as the one referenced 

    above. I guess this devolves into &quot;be careful what you ask for&quot;; 

    we've all bitched about foul-mouthed juvies running amuck in Brit, and corporations 

    are notorious for not having much toleration for grey areas.</font></p>

  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">There is also some hostility between 

    Japanese and American players. I haven't seen much of it before because I 

    rarely played on West Coast shards in UO. On EQ, where all the &quot;shards&quot; 

    are located in San Diego, there's much more of a Japanese presence. Americans 

    dislike Japanese players because they can't be bothered to speak in English 

    and often, they feel, use their preventative cocoon of language to killsteal 

    and do other antisocial things within game. (Plus it's difficult to group 

    with someone who speaks in mostly consonants.) I can't really comment on how 

    Japanese players feel, since I speak about 5 words of Japanese. (If any Japanese 

    players are reading this and <a href="mailto:lum@webtoys.net">care to comment</a>, 

    I'll post it as a followup.) UO GMs have remarked in the past that Japanese 

    shards are completely a different animal from a support standpoint; while 

    calls on Western shards are usually of the he-said-she-said personal interaction 

    problem variety, calls on Japanese shards are 99% &quot;GM I AM STUCK&quot;. 

    They don't HAVE personal interaction problems; they are capable of behaving 

    themselves in a group environment. Or they are capable of self-policing. Or 

    whatever.</font></p>

  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">This whole discussion dances nicely 

    around the whole racism thing; I'm sure there are Japanese assholes and American 

    saints. But AS A GROUP Americans are poorly organized racist foul-mouthed 

    retards and Japanese are highly organized, insular, kill-stealing commando 

    teams. And I find the whole phenomenon interesting. I would love to group 

    with Japanese players in EQ, but my language skills aren't up to the task. 

    But the whole experience of walking up to a group of elves and hearing them 

    talk amongst themselves in what could be Elvish for all I would know the difference 

    is one of those future-shock moments; the world really <b>is</b> at our doorstep 

    now.</font></p>

  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Speaking of clueless gaijins, Dr. 

    Twister posted <a href="http://www.drtwister.com/ultimaonline/uo-indx.html">a 

    rant</a> about how the dev team isn't working on anything in UO. About 3 or 

    4 hours after the dev team, um, posted on<a href="http://support.uo.com/c_issue.html"> 

    what they were working on</a>. Now, I personally think that the dev team has 

    a few more priority items to complete before encapsulating the UOA feature 

    set in UO, but hey, that's just me; however, there actually IS a dev team, 

    and they aren't the UO2 dev team. I know, I talked to someone on the UO2 dev 

    team over a year ago, they are definitely a seperate group and it's going 

    to be a very different game. So cut DD some slack. They're trying. Of course, 

    when they give us what they ask for, it usually ends up with popular webmasters 

    being banned for saying dirty words, but that is, as always, the price of 

    progress.</font></p>

  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Still, watching Twister work himself
