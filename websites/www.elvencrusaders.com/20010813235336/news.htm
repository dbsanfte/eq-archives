who have been with us since the beginning and all of those that have joined since 
and are active members in the guild. </FONT></FONT></FONT></P>

    sins against the citizens of Norrath" or something similar. Seems "aggressive 
    anit pk" is a new phenomenon to the Pks. We are PVP we kill PKS and their 
    Guilds. (doesnt seem that difficult to understand to me)</font></p>
