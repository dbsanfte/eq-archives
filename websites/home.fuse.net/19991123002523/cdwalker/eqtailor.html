<br><font color="#006600">Just had a friend make me some today.. You need
both a smith and a tailor. Have the smith make steel boning (i made that).
Then the tailor uses the boning and high quality pelts to make reinforced.
the stats aren't that great, and it's quite difficult to make. Out of 30
attempts (tailor was 24 skill). We got one hat (2 more ac than leather)
and one sleeve (1 more ac than leather).</font><font color="#006600"></font>
<p><font color="#006600">Hats and sleeves require 2 steel bonings, and
one high quality pelt each. Boots, tunics and legs require 3 bonings each.</font><font color="#006600"></font>
<p><font color="#006600">Cost is crazy for the quality of the stuff (figure
is cost me 50pp for the 30 attempts). And it takes forever just to make
the supplys. combine ore to make bits, bits and molds to make file, file
and small brick to make boning.. Amazing waste of time, and my tailor friend
didn't even gain any skill.</font><font color="#006600"></font>
<p><font color="#006600">Might be better if you can find a higher skill
tailor.</font><font color="#006600"></font>

<p><font color="#006600">Obviously anyone can see this just is not worth
the effort when equipment with similar stats is able to be bought for far
cheaper and have magical bonuses attached as well. - Pepto (Lvl 16 Druid,
