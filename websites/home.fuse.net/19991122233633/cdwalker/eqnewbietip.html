<center><b><u><font color="#006600"><font size=+2>Immediately after starting</font></font></u></b></center>
<font color="#006600"></font>
<p><font color="#006600">SHOW NAMES -Go to options and turn on show PC
and NPC names. It makes monsters more visible and lets you know who is
near you.</font><font color="#006600"></font>
<p><font color="#006600">HOT KEYS -You will want to set-up hot keys which
is accomplished by clicking and holding the left mouse button on buttons
from the right and dragging the key to the far left bottom of the screen.
I suggest the war like commands you will use and run. These would be Melee
Attack, Slam, Kick, Punch but if you don’t have a bow don’t put Range attack
as a hot key.</font><font color="#006600"></font>
<p><font color="#006600">If you want to set more hot keys then the 6 or
8 it shows press shift+2 and you will see a second set. You can have 6
banks of 6 I believe. The keys 1-6 activate them depending on which hot
key bank is open at that time. I suggest Run, Sit, Camp, Persona (from
dragging the top icon on the left which handles inventory)</font><font color="#006600"></font>
<p><font color="#006600">SCREEN WINDOWS -Now you want to change Screen
Settings. Press F1. I like full screen with the chat window. Notice you
kept the hot keys on the left but lost the buttons on the right. that is
why I wanted you to set them up.</font><font color="#006600"></font>
<p><font color="#006600">FOR VISIBILITY - Turn of the lights and turn your
monitors brightness and contrast up as the EQ world is dark and this improves
visibility.</font><font color="#006600"></font>
<p><font color="#006600">PERSPECTIVE – Press F4 if you don’t like the perspective.
I like the starting perspective where it is in first person the most.</font><font color="#006600"></font>
<p><font color="#006600">TRAINING - As soon as you get in the game read
the notes in your inventory. Go to PERSONA and click on the notes. You
should have atleast 2 notes . The first of which is a note for your level
one training. Take the training note and deliver it to the appropriate
person. You may want to train in your primary weapon but it will rise on
it's own and it has a max for each level. you will advance about 5 points
per level and the max goes up 5 points per level. But you start with a
max of 10.</font><font color="#006600"></font>
<p><font color="#006600">BANK - Go find the bank now. Deposit the PK note
and whatever item your trainer gave you.</font><font color="#006600"></font>
<p><font color="#006600">DEATH -You will die frequently to begin with and
you don't want to lose items so store all but your weapon until level 2-3.
If you do die at these lower levels you leave all non-newbie stuff on corpse.
You lose no experience and you have &frac12; hour to reclaim stuff from
your dead body. But you get lost real easy.</font><font color="#006600"></font>
<p><font color="#006600">EQUIPPING - Best way to equip armor is to drop
it on your character that almost always works even when dropping a belt
on your waist doesn't. For now just keep your newbie weapon and deposit
everything else.</font><font color="#006600"></font>
<p><font color="#006600">BATTLE - You must of course click on the thing
you want to fight to target before you enter battle.</font><font color="#006600"></font>
<p><font color="#006600">When you fight if you have several options like
sword and a hand-to-hand option you can use BOTH AT THE SAME TIME. Same
goes for other skills like Harm Touch (shadow knight ability) and sense
heading. You can press 1-2-3-4 all at the same time and hone skills and
fight well at the same time.</font><font color="#006600"></font>
<p><font color="#006600">LOOTING - At the end of the battle immediately
hit the mouse button on it (I forget which) to loot it. You must be close
and looking down on it. Pgup &amp; PgDn make you look up and down arrow
keys move you. Space bar to crouch and jump.</font><font color="#006600"></font>
<p><font color="#006600">GROUPING IN A PARTY - You invite someone or the
invite you - a suggested hotkey</font><font color="#006600"></font>
<p><font color="#006600">when you are invited your invite hotkey changes
to follow you hit it and you are now in the group. Groups all gain the
experience and you can see their</font>
<br><font color="#006600">health levels. You can even be grouped over large
distances (like next to the guards while they fight and raise your exp
while you piss). Loot however</font>
<br><font color="#006600">is not split automatically unless you turn that
feature on and then I believe it is just the cash. That is under options
if you would like to turn that on.</font>
<br><font color="#006600">Once you are in a group the invite button turns
to disband and you hit that if you choose to leave the group.</font>
<br><font color="#006600"></font>&nbsp;
