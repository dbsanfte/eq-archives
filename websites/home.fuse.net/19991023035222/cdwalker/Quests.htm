size="6"><b>Known Quests</b></font></p>

<p><font size="2">Sorry but sometimes my info here is vague to
say the least. Almost useless but atleast you know which items
not to sell or give away....</font></p>

<p><font size="4"><strong><u>Ak'Anon</u></strong></font></p>

<p>Bugglepup - Mage guild the one guy asks if will kill Bugglepup
and retrieve his pellet. In beta I had the pellet but could not
get the quest, now i can get the quest but have not seen
bugglepup in beta, maybe there has to be high enough level people
in the zone for her to spawn. Around level 8-10 you will be able
to go out to the Steamfont mountains and kill Bugglegupp a
similarly leveled troll who frequents the area. Kill him and
return his item to the guildmaster and in return you will be
given a high level(29+) spell scroll which you can keep or sell
to a higher level player.</p>

<p>Clockworks - Warrior guild Talk to the lady (Jarah I think)
and talk about clockworks. She sends you to a guy all in armor
that has 2 quests. 1 involves the cargo clockwork and one is for
blackboxes.</p>

<p>TELESCOPE - Talk to the good Magician guild leader in Ak'anon
in the Library Mechcanica(sp?) I think his name is Todos, Todor,
or Todon. He is the only flesh creature in the room, the others
are all mechanical.<br>
I'm not sure what the factions are required to do it, but gnome
fighters cannot get the quest. Spellcasters of other races may be
able to.<br>
Hail him and follow the text cues till he gives you a note. It
has the names of 4 gnomes to visit and get telescope lenses from.
Hail them and say &quot;Do you have a spare lens?&quot;<br>
Fodin Frugrin - right outside Ak'anon in Steamfront in the
telescope building<br>
Trudo Frugrin - in another telescope building in Lesser Faydark
near the zone to steamfront<br>
Tindo Frugrin - To find the other one head from akanon towards
the mills. Just before the mill, turn left and follow the hills
on the left side, you will come to another observatory.<br>
This is where it gets really really funny. The person says
&quot;my brother has the lens, he was captured by mino slavers,
go search the mino caves for him&quot;. Now, in all my time in
beta i have not met ANYBODY who could search the mino caves deep
enough and live.<br>
Meldrath see's through invisibity and casts charm through walls.<br>
Phiz Frugrin - In Steamfront follow the mountains around to the
right from leaving the city gates. Far along the mountain are 3
gnome houses. After asking him for a lens he tells you it was
stolen by a dark-elf and taken to a Freeport bar and gives you a
note with the clues. I did not follow up on this part of the
quest.<br>
</p>

<p><font size="4"><strong><u>Erudin</u></strong></font></p>

<p>Peacekeeper staff - Cleric's Guild. is a staff useable only by
erudite clerics and paladins. The staff does 5 damage and has a
delay of 28. The only real advantage of this staff is that it
grants +10 charisma when held. If you accept the quest you will
be sent to the Tox Forest to search for an NPC. The NPC is in the
first hut to the right after you leave the city gates. He will
give you a staff and directions on how to continue the quest.
Basically you will be required to kill a Treant and bring back
the treant shards to the NPC. When you do so he will grind them
into treant resin and hand them back to you. <br>
You know must get the other required item to combine in with the
treant resin to create the staff. Go to the vault in erudin(the
bank) and talk to the banker on the far left. Tell him you are in
need of some vasty deep water. He will tell you that you need a
guild coin in order for him to give it to you. Now return to the
clerics guild and tell them that this NPC sent you to get a guild
coin. You will be given the coin. When you give it to the banker
you will receive the vasty deep water in return. Combine the
water and the resin in the staff and the end result will be a
peacekeeper staff.<br>
</p>

<p><strong><u>Tox Forest</u></strong></p>

<p>Darla Starfire/torch - female guildmaster (forget her name) in
the necro hut.&nbsp; She wants you to kill Darla Starfire, a
level 5ish npc who is supplying the hated Kerrans.&nbsp; Your

lucrative quest.For Erudites (clerics, paladins, and those who
follow prexus or quellious)</p>

<p>Kobold Shamans - first cleric guildmaster on the right wants
you to kill a kobold shaman (lvl 5ish mob) and give her its
paw.&nbsp; The reward is a couple of sp/faction/small xp.</p>

<p>Rungupp - necromancers hut. Talk to Marzius Denison (I think
that's his name) on the right side of the hut.&nbsp; He will tell
you to go kill Rungupp, a fippy-type NPC who runs around yelling
that he will kill all erudites.&nbsp; He's a level 6ish troll
shaman.&nbsp; Your reward for turning his head into the
guildmaster is a rusty dagger</p>

<p>Poachers - paladin who stands outside the cleric's guild wants
you to kill Poachers (lvl 4 NPCs who have names like Poacher Dell
or Poacher Smith) and return their heads to him for
2sp/faction/xp.</p>

<p>Orc belts &#150; North Freeport - building next to arena 2<sup>nd</sup>
floor Cain Darkmoor &#150; north Freeport/e commons OR Militia

(Small cash and XP as well as faction)</p>

<p>Newbie spoils &#150; East Freeport - Necro guild&nbsp; -
Abandoned building&#146;s basement (items found in west gate area
forget which)</p>

<p>Spy Mission &#150; East Freeport - Necro guild - sends you to
militia house at a inn near lake in far back West Commons to kill
a guy fishing and bring back a scroll for 2 gold to the militia
house.&nbsp; The necro guild gave us squat when we returned it.</p>

<p>Kill Smithy &#150; East Freeport - Necro guild - to kill a
local smithy.</p>

<p class="MsoBodyText">Minnow &#150; North Freeport - Celsar
Vestagon on the third floor of the Temple of Marr in
Freeport.&nbsp; Ask him about the Marr Minnow, and then about
exterminating the pirahna.&nbsp; He will give you a sack, and ask
you to put 4 fresh pirahna in it (not stacked, but 4 individual
pirahna).&nbsp; The pirahna may be found in the lake by the Hall
of Truth, just left of the bridge before you cross.&nbsp; There
will be one or two just in the water.&nbsp; You will have to wait
for them to respawn to get 4 pirahna, but it is worth it.&nbsp;
When you have 4 individual pirahna in the sack, hit combine and
it will give you the Full sack item. Give the Full sack back to
Celsar, and he will give you a potion of Disease Warding. &nbsp;
This may not seem like much at first, but it sells for about 8
gold, which is a load of change for a level 2 character.&nbsp; </p>

<p><font size="3">KARG Polar and Lupine Armor - Karg Icebear in
Everfrost will make you polar or lupine armor provided the right
materials and some compensation. Polar armor requires polar bear

armor is special armor derived from lycanthropes(werewolves).
Some lupine armor can be directly found on lycanthropes such as
the lupine armbands. Others must be gained by questing for Karg.
Lupine armor is excellent armor for all classes but especially
for monks and pure casters. It can be worn by all races and all
classes and it is extremely light. It is the same armor class
rating as leather but it's magical bonuses usually more than make
up for that. Lupine armor all gives magical bonuses. For example
the armbands grant +3 strength and +3 dexterity.</p>

<p><font size="3">Elixer - take an elixer to a certain warrior,

shoulderpads that you find off any of the Crushbone orcs. You
will be rewarded with a compensation and faction adjustment. I
have no idea what the long term reward is on this quest as I
haven't finished it. If anyone does know please drop me a mail.</p>

<p>I've smacked Blyle Bundin, the post abandoning guard 2 or 3
times now. I've taken his Axe &amp; given it to the trainer in
the pit. However, I have yet to get his head as loot. The quest
mentions returning his head. Anyway, returning the axe does
nothing. I've counted this off as broken, or am i missing
something?</p>

<p><b><u>Crushbone<br>
</u></b></p>

<p><strong>Screaming Mace </strong>(8 Dmg and 35 delay light
equal to greater lightstone and casts yaulp 18 sec +10 STR +22
AC).quest is one of the most fullfilling quest you can do between
levels 14-25. This quest can be done by a full party of level 14
characters, and can be done solo at around level 22-25 depending
on your class/race combination.</p>

<p>First thing that you need to do is go see the dwarven smith.
He is located in the small building that is near the mine area.
To get here from the entrance you must take a left and go across
the bridge. Once you cross the bridge just basically follow the
path. After you go down the hill you will see a building. Inside
this building is a jailor who you will have to kill. Then you
will see two dwarven smiths and an elven priest. Talk to the
middle dwarven smith(actually you can probably talk to either
smith but I always spoke to the one in the middle, so for safety
purposes speak to him). Tell him that you are here to set him
free and he will begin rambling about how he wants his freedom
but the taskmaster scares them, yada yada yada. Then ask him
about the king or emporer and he will speak of the high quality
ringmail that is worn by this beast.</p>

<p>There are several parts of this quest but you really only need
to concentrate on the final two(bracer of battle and dwarven
ringmail). Each piece that you find can either be kept or turned
in for the item that it returns depending on your class, race,
and needs.</p>

<p>The first mob that you might want to worry about is the
Taskmaster. He hangs out to the right of the castle near the
slaves. He seldomly spawns but when he does he has a chance of
carrying some magic <strong>+2 AC earrings</strong>. You can
either wear these earrings or return them to the dwarven smith.
If you return them to him he will give you a blade mold which can
be used for blacksmithy.</p>

<p>The second mob in this quest is the Instructor/Trainer. This
is a large orc who can be found training other orcs on top of the
large hill in the middle of the zone. He very rarely carries a <strong>Shiny
Brass Shield</strong> (10 AC +10 Vs Magic and light source). You
can elect to keep this weapon(a wise choice or a poor choice
depending on your class) or you can turn it in to the dwarven
smith in exchange for a sludge mold.</p>

<p>The third item that you will need is the one that will be the
most dangerous. You now need to kill the Emporer/King and hope
that he is sporting the <strong>Dwarven Ringmail Tunic</strong>
(strong as chainmail AC 12 lighter and grants +8 vs. heat, cold,
and magic) If you are a small race you might think about keeping
this item to wear on your person until you get a second one.
However you can turn this item in to the dwarven smith as with
the items above. This time he will give you a <strong>Dwarven
Mace</strong> (Dmg 8 delay 35). Not a bad weapon, however it's
just a stepping stone. The smith will also send you to go
speaking to the elven priest standing in the next stall. The
priest can enchant this mace for you(and turn it into the
screaming mace) but first you need to do something for her. She
wants you to kill the Warlord and bring proof of his death.</p>

<p>The fourth item that you need is the hardest one to get. You
need to find the Warlord. He can be seen patrolling the area from
time to time. He is a level 14 or so mob, but that isn't the
problem. The problem is if you attack him he is going to run and
bring help. So you must be careful to root him in place and then
try to take care of him before root runs out. If you are lucky he
will be carrying a <strong>Bracer of battle</strong>(same AC as
leather but also gives a bonus of +3 strength and +3 dexterity)
This is a fine piece of armor for this level, however it can also
be turned in. This time you will turn the bracer into the elven
priest rather than the dwarven smith. The priest will give you a<strong>
Prayer Cloth </strong>in return for the bracer. </p>

<p>Many players get to this step and think, what? What did I do
wrong. Well it is important to NOT give the priest the mace at
the same time as the bracer of battle. You need to give her the
bracer alone first. Then after she hands you the prayer cloth you
can give her the mace. When she asks, &quot;do you have something
else for me?&quot; then you can hand over the prayer cloth and
voila you get one shiny screaming mace.</p>

<p><font size="4"><strong><u>Oggok</u></strong></font></p>

<p>Lizard tails - warriors guild. Some full grown(not broodling) <a
href="../beastiary/lizman.html">lizard men</a> drop lizard tails
when they are killed. If you are a Craknek or wish to raise
faction with Crakneks then you can give the tails to Horgus at

woman in fools gold tavern.&nbsp; She sends you back to
Reebo.&nbsp; He gives you fresh carrots and you go back to

Drop it on him.</p>

<p>Ogre - Eloize or whatever the ogre on the hill directly in
front of the misty thicket exit has a quest about 5 gold and
something about a small foe. Getchen hangs near the gate area in
misty thicket and he is a friendly goblin.&nbsp; Must have an
associated quest. Maybe eloize dislikes getchen? I have no clue
but both are oddities maybe they are related?</p>

<p>Ol' Chomper - Hangs around the trout near the docks.
Eventually, he will show up and attack you. He is only a little
bigger than the trout so it will be hard to spot him. But once
you do and kill him, you can loot him to get a pouch. </p>

<p>Pirhana Teeth - pier near the lake. Near the pier or right
inside of the shop you will find Fiddy Bobbick. Tell him that
Wickystick sent you. He will inform you that the lake is infested
with Pirahna. For every pirahna you kill you will receive a
pirahna tooth. You can return this tooth to him for a cash
compensation as well as a faction adjustment.</p>

<p>Restuff Shakey - Reebo Leafsway. Get stuffing from scarecrows
in West Karana.</p>

<p>Shakey's new head - Reebo Leafsway. Can't help hear although I
have seen screenshots of Jack-O-lanterns.....</p>

<p>Nillipuss - Kill nillipuss he is lvl 15+ so he will be a
worthy adversary. However when you kill him he will often drop an
item. One of these items is a jumjum stalk. He has stolen these
items from vendors in Rivervale. You can return this to the
vendor and receive a faction adjustment</p>

<p><font size="4"><strong><u>Qeynos</u></strong></font></p>

<p>There is a guy named Vicus in Queynos (he is upstairs in the
building next to the Tin Soldier) and I did the &quot;/say Vicus
Hail&quot; routine. He then replied by saying that he was the
royal tax collector, all the while coughing and weezing. I then
asked him if he was ill, by typing &quot;/say Vicus are you
ill?&quot;. </p>

<p>Anyway, Vicus will then tell you that you that he wishes
someone would collect the taxes for him. I then said that
&quot;/say Vicus I will collect the taxes for you&quot;. He
agrees and then he gave me a box to collect the taxes in. You
also have to ask for the list of vendors, since he doesn't give
that to you until you ask. Then all you do is go to each vendor
on the list and type something like &quot;/say {vendor name} I am
here to collect the taxes in the name of Antonius Bayle&quot;,
and they will give you the taxes!</p>

<p>When you&#146;re done click on the combine button. When you do
that it changes the tax collection box to a &quot;full tax
collection box&quot;, which is a single item (not a container)
before you hand it back.</p>

<p>If you talk to him after talking to the Sayer chick, ask him
if he robbed the taxes from Mira Sayer. He will say yes and then
tell you to do something humiliating in return for the stolen
taxes in front of the staff of the Crow tavern . Enjoy. </p>
