        <p>AK was created in Santa Rosa, CA, 2000, when a few buddies decided 
          they were sick of the crap in stores, sick of the clothing kids wear, 
          sick of the art some of the artists these days slap together. We are 
          a small group of friends bound together by art and our artistic abilities. 
          Some of us draw, some paint, some tag. It is all art though, and the 
          purpose of ak is to aggressively destroy all that is fake, all that 
          is korrupt. We are the Anti Korrupt, we hold an Aggressive Knowledge, 
          our art makes use of All Kolors.</p>
        <p>There are many great artists around the world, quite a few can be found 
          at <a href="http://pub25.ezboard.com/bpolykarbonbbs">polykarbon.com</a> 
          (more links posted as we find more great art)</p>
