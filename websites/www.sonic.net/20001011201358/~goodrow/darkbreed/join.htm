<p>For those of you who are wishing to join our guild please read the following carefully.<br>
<br>
Our guild strives to keep in high regard our guild name throughout the world of Norrath.
We are an unselfish and honorable guild who take care of each other. Our goal first and
foremost is to have fun. Too many have lost sight of what this game is about I am sad to
say. We strive to be one of the best guilds while at the same time keeping a family
feeling by staying smaller. We have many allies and friends to call upon if we should want
to achieve something out of our reach.<br>
<br>
With our new recruitment policy in place, everyone shall follow the same steps to become a
member. First you MUST have a sponsor. That sponsor should have directed you to this board
where you will start your initiation period. Post up all you information about yourself
and any alts you wish to have join the guild. Name/class/lvl and other things about
yourself that would give us a good background of what kind of person you are. This
initiation period can range from anywhere from a few weeks to a few months depending on
how much you play and how fast you get to know other members in the guild.<br>
<br>
It's very important that you come and join us on our raids or join in groups so you can
fight with a wide variety of our members. There will be a guild vote at the end of this
trial period where only a majority vote will allow you in.<br>
<br>
Once you are voted in there will be a &quot;probation period&quot; of around one month.
This is to ensure both sides are happy with the agreement and are satisfied.<br>
<br>
The minimum lvl requirement is now lvl 25. We want only serious applicants as we are
looking for long term members for the guild. We are slowly growing and developing and
welcome all who want to grow with us. We do planes and know our way around most all of
Norrath. We pride ourselves on being able to do things with less people then ordinarily
required for the job.<br>
<br>
We will find acts such as KS'ing, ripping off people in any way, being offensive or openly
attacking someone in /ooc /shout /guildsay or by any other means a serious and ban able
offense. Defending yourself is one thing and venting some steam to the guild is
understandable when luck goes sour at times. But we are all mature enough to handle
ourselves in a manner fitting to the situation. If you are not mature enough to control
yourself then you won't fit in with our guild.<br>
<br>
So if you meet our requirements and feel our guild is for you then post your intentions
below and good luck to you. I hope to see you wearing our proud guild-tag soon.<br>
