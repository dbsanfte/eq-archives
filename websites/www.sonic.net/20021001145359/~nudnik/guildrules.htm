<p>Our guild is a level 40-60 guild although we do let twinks of level 40-60 
members in. We have guild camps a lot and it would be good if you are just 
joining or thinking of joining that you know you will be expected to join guild 
camps and raids as much as you can. Also one of our few rules is that <b>you 
can't go anon</b> this is just because when one of our members types /who all 
GUILD names of people who are anon will not show up, but if you are roleplaying 
they will show up so go roleplaying as much as you want.</p>
