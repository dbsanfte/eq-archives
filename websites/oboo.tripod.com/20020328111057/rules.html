Guild Rules</p>
<table width=90% cellpadding=1 border=0>


<tr valign=top><td><p>1.</td> <td><p>The Bears of Oboo demand that all guild members abide by Verant's Rules of Conduct.</td> </tr>

<tr valign=top><td><p>2.</td> <td><p>Members of the Bears of Oboo must, at all times, have as a primary goal the advancement of the Barbarian, Erudite, and other aligned races in their never-ending contention with humankind.</td> </tr>

<tr valign=top><td><p>3.</td> <td><p>Guild members should attempt to recruit new members for the Bears of Oboo by presenting prospects with Oboo literature, available on this Web page.</td> </tr>

<tr valign=top><td><p>4.</td> <td><p>Guild members should avoid grouping with Humans, Wood Elves, Half Elves, and High Elves whenever possible, and should not befriend them.</td> </tr>

<tr valign=top><td><p>5.</td> <td><p>The Bears of Oboo do not accept the invasion of our native lands, Everfrost and Toxxulia Forest, by Humans and Elves.</td> </tr>

<tr valign=top><td><p>6.</td> <td><p>Guild members shall not eat pork or rely on alcohol for spiritual fulfillment, though the occasional drink is acceptable. Fishcakes and muffins are the recommended diet of a Bear of Oboo.</td> </tr>

<tr valign=top><td><p>7.</td> <td><p>The Guild shall consist of Barbarians and Erudites only. It will never contain any Human, Wood Elf, Half Elf, or High Elf.</td> </tr>

<tr valign=top><td><p>8.</td> <td><p>Guild members are asked to keep their "anon" flags off, as it does not allow people to query for guild members. You should be proud of your guild, and want to have it appear in all queries.</td> </tr>

<tr valign=top><td><p>9.</td> <td><p>The Bears of Oboo do not use threats, bad language, or insults with any other players in game, regardless of circumstances. Though it is understood that problems will arise within the game, we ask that our Bears show restraint and maturity in the face of immaturity and disrespectfulness. You catch more flies with honey than with vinegar.</td> </tr>

<tr valign=top><td><p>10.</td> <td><p>When posting on public forums, Bears of Oboo should not engage in mudslinging, name-calling fights. Message Boards are one way in which our guild name gets out there, and The Bears of Oboo want to present a united face to the world, and civility will win us more respect than anything else we do. Though Bears are certainly encouraged to be vocal in public forums, we assume that they have been trained, through the discipline of the group, to exercize restraint and demonstrate maturity.</td> </tr>

<tr valign=top><td><p>11.</td> <td><p>We ask that internal disagreements are kept in-house until their resolution. If you have a problem with a guild member or part of the guild structure, we ask that you use our <a href=http://oboo.cybrick.com/ubbcgi/Ultimate.cgi>message board</a> to resolve them, or that you speak to an officer or to the offending party in-game before taking it to a public forum. We must present a uniform face to the world if we hope to attain our own freedom, and we operate under the firm belief that almost all disagreements within the guild can be resolved with open communication.</td> </tr>

<tr valign=top><td><p>12.</td> <td><p>Failure to comply with any guild rule may result in punishment up to and including standing in the corner for fifteen minutes.</td> </tr></table>
