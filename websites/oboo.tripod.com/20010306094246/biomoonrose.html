<p class=subhead>Biography of the Moonrose Sisters</p>
<p>
As told by Ellistyl Moonrose with information from various sources<br><br>

<b>The Beginning</B><br><br>

The Moonrose sisters were born in Halas. Their father was a shaman of the Tribunal and their mother was one of the Wolves of the North. They worked as guides for a southern trading guild, as a means of aiding Barbarians from their homeland venturing to the South. Late one season they were told of a late caravan bound for Qeynos that needed their assistance as guides. Against their better judgement, due to recent problems with the gnolls and orcs, they agreed. They left their two daughters, Lilu (age 4) and Ellistyl (age 2) with a shaman friend of theirs. Knowing that it was a bad idea, they left with heavy hearts for Qeynos.<br><br>

Enroute to Qeynos, the caravan was ambushed by orcs and everyone was slaughtered. Evidence left behind suggested that the orcs were working for a rival merchant guild from Qeynos. The two girls were told of their parent's death and became wards of the church. While training and studying at the church, eventually they learned the entire truth (what was known of it) about what happened to their parents.<br><br>

Nursing their growing hatred for the orcs and dislike for the Humans who had treated their family as pawns, the sisters awaited their full graduation from the Church of the Tribunal so they could repay both species in kind. Lilu graduated first, leaving Ellistyl and promising to return.<br><br>

<b>Lilu's Adventures</B><br><br>

When her training ended with the Tribunal, Lilu set out to right the wrong done to her family. For the sake of all Barbarians who had suffered similar fates, she quickly begin perfecting her abilities as a shaman. For many days and nights, Lilu hunted in the cold tundra of Everfrost, yielding her blade to all who helped destroy her family. One night, under the starry canvas of Everfrost, Lilu prayed to the spirits for guidance. As the smoke from her pipe filled the night air, the spirits came to her in a vision. The vision was of a strong and powerful bear who enveloped Lilu and shared it’s powers with her. Together, Lilu and the spirit bear fought bravely against many enemies all over Norrath. As the bear began to vanish, it’s shape changed into a figure Lilu immediately recognized, her sister Ellistyl. Coming out of the trance, Lilu wasn’t sure what to make of the vision.<br><br>

Many nights later, while taking her usual route through Everfrost, Lilu was met by a guild who, strangely enough, called themselves the Bears of Oboo. Instantly Lilu was drawn to this roving band of Barbarians and Erudites and eagerly accepted membership. With her days of fighting her battles alone over with, Lilu proudly fought beside her new brothers and sisters and quickly climbed the ranks to Lieutenant.<br><br>

While Lilu was standing in battle with her new brothers and sister, Ellistyl had also joined the guild. As she saw her prophesy fulfilled, Lilu felt she had finally fulfilled her destiny. Standing beside her sister, Lilu continues to fight for justice but now sees her new calling: to use her shamanic skills to help strengthen and protect all young Barbarians who have also chosen to fight for justice in Norrath. Staying close to her homeland, Lilu had taken pride in helping these fine young Barbarians and teaching them the ways of not only the Six Hammers but of her beloved Bears of Oboo guild.<br><br>

<b>Ellistyl's Adventures</B><br><br>

After Lilu's departure, Ellistyl spent the next 18 months waiting and worrying about her sister, who hadn't returned. Graduating at 18, Ellistyl ventured into Everfrost to aid her people and take what vengeance she could. Having spent several months doing this she met Lelleasha, who introduced her to the Bears of Oboo. Finding kindred spirits in this guild, she eagerly joined. Upon finding her sister also a member of the Bears, she was overjoyed to reunited with Lilu. Now, together again, they are biding their time and readying themselves to repay the orcs and Humans for the cruel hand they helped Fate deal to the Moonrose sisters. With their new family, their brothers and sisters in the Bears, behind them, it is sure to be a reckoning that will go down in legend and stories.</p>
