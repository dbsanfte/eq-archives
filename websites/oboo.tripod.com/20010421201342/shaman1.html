<p class=subhead>The Roles of a Barbarian Shaman</p>
<p>
I think the shaman is one of the most versatile characters in Everquest.  There are many different roles he can assume depending on the makeup of the group he is in.  I'll try to list each of the roles I've seen shaman successfully play, what the group consists of, and what spells the shaman should rely on.<br><br>

<b>The Buffer:</B><br><br>

In well rounded groups with one or more tanks and one or more casters, the shaman is best used as intended -- the group's buffer.  Keep STR, STA, AGIL, DEX, SOW, Inner Fire, Endure Magic, and Turtle Skin up on all tanks at all times.  Keep AGIL, SOW, Inner Fire, and Endure Magic up on all others.  Use the timer method to determine when buffs are needed: cast a buff on yourself first, then wait a minute and cast it on everyone else.  When your buff runs out, the others will run out a minute later.  They won't have to bother you asking for a new cast of it.<br><br>

Between rounds of buffing, use your remaining mana to keep everyone topped off on hit points and throw a poison DOT every once in a while.  Don't waste mana on direct damage spells in a group like this.<br><br>

<b>The Healer:</B><br><br>

Obviously, in a cleric-less group, you've got to spend most of your time and mana healing.  Cut buffs to SOW, Inner Fire and STR on tanks, SOW only on casters.  Heal often and heal early -- you can't keep up with damage piling onto a tank as quickly as a cleric can.  As soon as the battle is clearly under control (even if it's not close to being over), back off and sit your butt down to meditate.  This reduces downtime and makes you just as effective as a cleric who doesn't meditate in combat.  Be sure to tell your group that you are "medding through the rest of this one".<br><br>

<b>The Tank:</B><br><br>

In a group with all casters (or 1 other shaman and no tanks), you get to be the tank.  You are a good puller and you have the most hitpoints of the group in all probability.  Use your mana to damage the opponent while attacking.  You should pull with your poison DOT spell and continue to lay on the damage spells early in the fight.  This is important because it can be difficult to keep the enemy focused on you and off the more vulnerable casters.  If you hit him early and always stay within melee range, you have a better chance of successfully tanking for the fight.  If you need to taunt an enemy off your caster friend, stand next to the opponent while you heal your friend, or throw Disempower on your opponent -- those are usually better for taunting than direct damage spells.<br><br>

<b>The Blaster-Caster:</B><br><br>

This can be fun but it's not usually needed.  If you're in a group in an area that is a kill stealing haven (the orc end of Highpass for instance), you should use Spirit Strike with wanton abandon.  Work it out so that everyone in your group (casters anyway) throws one unresisted direct damage spell per opponent.  If this doesn't seem to be getting enemies for 51% of their health (needed to take the kill), have one or two guys throw a second damage spell.  It's a crappy way to play, but sometimes necessary.<br><br>

<b>The Soloer:</B><br><br>

Shamans belong in groups more than solo, in my opinion, but you can get by solo as well.  Kiting is the only way to go on this.  SOW yourself, then pick out your victim carefully (1 at a time!).  Throw your best Disease DOT on him from long range and then Root him as he runs towards you.  Next throw your best poison DOT on him.  Back up to max spell range again, and wait for Root to break or your DOTs to finish up.  Poison DOTs last 7 ticks (I believe around 45 seconds) and Disease DOTs last 3 times that long.  Reapply them as necessary.  Only close to melee range when you have to at the end.  If you're out of mana and the guy still has half health, you're probably not going to win.  Run earlier rather than later.<br><br><br>


There's my experiences about the roles of a shaman.  Chalk this up to the life and times of Oboo Cookiemonster, a level 27 shaman on Prexus.<br><br>
