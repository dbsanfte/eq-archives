<p class=subhead>General In-Game Tips</p>
<p>

This little guide contains general in-game tips for our Bears. This may be common knowledge to most of us, but I went an embarrasingly long time without them.

1. If you click on a stack of items, you get a little sliding bar that you can use to select just one. This has proven to be a very time-consuming process, especially when doing things like working on trade skills or turning in gnoll teeth in Qeynos. Instead, you can <b>Control-click</B> the stack, which will select just one. I've been playing EQ for months and just discovered this yesterday ... talk about a fearless leader.<br><br>

2. If you play without the full interface (by this I mean without the full windowed interface), you can still have a container "open" on the screen. Nice if you are doing things that require you to continually put things into your inventory, like Fishing. If any of you do that sort of thing that is. Also nice for repeated summoning. Can't take stuff OUT in that view, but I guess we can't have everything. I like to do it since I can't STAND looking at the grey tile all the time.<br><br>

3. You know when you're about to reply to someone with a long /guild or /party thing and someone else replies? And you don't want to repeat what they said but it's a big pain in the ass to erase the whole message in your little text bar? I find that the rate of repeat is sometimes painfully slow, and hence end up just repeating other people out of laziness or sitting there hitting backspace a million times in a row ... anyway, if you press <b>SHIFT+DELETE</B>, it will delete everything that you have in the little text bar.<br><br>

4. Also, if you press <b>SHIFT+Side arrow keys</B>, it will move your cursor around in the little text bar.<br><br>

5. Clicking <b>SHIFT+Up and Down arrow keys</B> cycles through your previously used commands.<br><br>

Hope this helps,<br><br>
