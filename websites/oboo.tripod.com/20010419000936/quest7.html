<p class=subhead>The Paw of Opolla Quest</p>
<p>
This is a quest for the Paw of Opolla, a very valuable shield-slot item that is useable by Clerics, Druids, and Shamen of all races.  It sells for an extraordinary amount of money (sounds like 3000-10,000 plat on the older servers), and is an absolutely outstanding item to have, as evidenced by the great stats:

</p>
<p class=normalindent>AC: 9, +5 Stamina, -5 Charisma, +9 Wisdom, +9 Agility, +5 mana, -5 Save vs. disease, weight 2.0</p>

<p> Before proceeding with the quest spoiler, I would like to make a few notes.  First, I think it makes a lot of sense for our guild to be running this quest as often as possible, as it appears all components but the Platinum ring can be found between West Karana and Erudin, being right around our little base of operations.  Second, it appears that the first six steps of this fairly lengthy set of instructions are not necessary, as all you need are the paw container and the four rings.  I've included the information because, well, people might find it interesting.  And now on with the instructions:<br><br>

<b>Step One:</B> In the Fish Ale pub in South Qeynos, there is a man named Micc Koter standing at the bar. His companion (whose name I forget) will occasionally mumble about someone "foolish going after the Paw of Opolla". When you ask the companion about it, he tells you to mind your own business, but Micc will tell him to behave.
<br><br><b>Step Two:</B> Ask Micc about the Paw of Opolla and he will tell you it is a magical item and it belongs to "some gnoll bitch".  He will offer to tell you where to find it if you buy him a brandy.
<br><br><b>Step Three:</B> Buy him a brandy. You may have to buy him two.  He then says that someone calling himself Caninel went to find it in the Plains of Karana.
<br><br><b>Step Four:</B> Go to Caninel. He is located in West Karana, along with two named gnolls, along the mountains near the border with North Karana.
<br><br><b>Step Five:</B> When you talk to Caninel, he will demand 3 gems before telling you about the Paw of Opolla (Moonstone, Bloodstone, and a Star Rose Quartz).
<br><br><b>Step Six:</B> Caninel will then tell you about how when the humans from Everfrost first met the Blackburrow Gnolls, the Shaman Opolla greeted them warmly and had her hand cut off by Gynok Molter. She placed a curse upon the Molter descendants, the last of which can be found in under Qeynos. Caninel then tells you to ask the last Molter descendant about the paw and also about the rings on the paw.</p>
<p class=normalindent>Or, you can just start in on the quest right here ...</p>
<p><b>Step Seven:</B> The descendant he is speaking of is Vin Molter. Find him in the Qeynos Aqueducts (might want to speak to <a href=biothryth.html>Thryth</a> about where to find him).
<br><br><b>Step Eight:</B> Vin Molter will demand 3 bottles of Khalish and a rat meat pie for the paw. He will deny any knowledge of the rings and say that his father probably sold them, mentioning his father's travels in Odus.
<br><br><b>Step Nine:</B> You can get the pie in Qeynos Hills or you can ask Cania if she would be kind enough to bake you one.  You can also kill him to get the paw container, though it will lower your faction with the merchants of Qeynos, but they all smell bad anyway.  He is around lvl 24-25.
<br><br><b>Step Ten:</B> The paw container is not the actual item, as it seems that the four rings activate its magic. You must find these four rings: platinum, gold, silver and copper.
<br><br><b>Step Eleven - Copper Ring:</B> The copper ring (+1 Stamina, -1 Charisma) is dropped by Priestess Mitty in Kerra Isle, who spawns every 18 minutes or so and drops this ring commonly.  Mitty is lvl 17, and all of her priestess friends heal her like hell, so apparently the best way to take her is to cast a spell and run to the zone, where you and some friends can beat on her in peace.  She has about 600 hit points, so she isn't impossible if she's not being constantly healed.  You reach Kerra Ridge by swimming out of Toxullia Forest.
<br><br><b>Step Twelve - Silver Ring:</B> You can find the silver ring (+1 Wisdom, -1 Charisma) on the bottom of the pool of razorgills in Blackburrow.  It looks like a dropped item (a bag) and spawns once per EQ day.  You can also get this off of Mitty, although it appears to be a fairly rare drop for her.
<br><br><b>Step Thirteen - Gold Ring:</B> The gold ring (+1 Dexterity, -1 Charisma) can be aquired from Mitty, again, though it is a very rare drop for her.  Apparently it can also be found on Gynok (see the next step) or in the pool in Blackburrow, but these rumors sound a little dubious.  People on the message boards insisted that the gold does in fact drop from Mitty, though it is a very rare drop for her and may result in a whole lot of camping her.  My impression of the quest is that this is the most difficult part of completing it.
<br><br><b>Step Fourteen - Platinum Ring:</B> The platinum ring (+1 Agility, -1 Charisma) is a loot item off of Gynok Molter in Befallen. He's a 25th lvl mummy that spawns every six hours at the very entrance of Befallen.  Apparently the platinum ring is a fairly common drop for him.  Killing Gynok is the only way to get the platinum ring.  As soon as you enter Befallen and turn to the left, move halfway down that hallway and meditate.  He spawns on the first bone as soon as you enter Befallen.  Once he spawns, he'll walk down the hallway and aggro you.  When he doesn't spawn, a placeholder will spawn every fifteen minutes, which you should kill.
<p class=normalindent>Note: Each ring must have +1 on some stat and -1 Charisma and must be a lore item.  You <b>cannot</B> use any other rings, as it will result in a total loss of what you've worked so hard for.  Once you have all four rings, make sure that they are the right ones.</p>
<p><b>Step Fifteen:</B> Place the four rings in the paw container and hit combine. You now have the Paw of Opolla!
