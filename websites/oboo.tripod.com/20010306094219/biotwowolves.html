<p class=subhead>Twowolves's Biography</p>
<p>

The Barbarian known by the name Two-Wolves-Howling-At-Midnight (or just Twowolves to his friends) was born by the light of a full moon in the frozen tundra of Everfrost Peaks, as a pair of wolves heralded his arrival. The oldest son of his nomadic tribe's medicine man, he was destined to follow in his father's footsteps and learn the ways of the spirit world. His father, Soars-With-Eagles, told him of the time of his forefathers, when Barbarians roamed free and far across the length and breadth of Antonica. In perfect harmony with nature, these ancestors followed the herds of game as they migrated through the plains of Karana, or peacefully plied the rivers and seas for fish. It was an innocent age, when the People and the Land were as one. It was before the coming of Man.<br><br>

The Humans came to Antonica and their stench spread. As they moved across the land, they spread what they called Civilization. This "civilization" seemed to the People to consist mainly of over-hunting game, strip-mining mountains, over-logging the forests and making war with each other. The People attempted to trade with them, only to be shunned, ridiculed, and cheated time and again. The People reacted by retreating, following the diminishing herds of game. In time, the Humans drove the peace-loving People farther and farther away from their ancestral lands, until all they were left with was land the Humans thought useless, the frozen lands of Everfrost. Here the People made use of the land and it's spirits to make a new home. The Humans laughed at the People, and made light of their ways. It was these intruders upon the land who first mocked the People, calling them "Barbarians". In prideful defiance, the People took this name as their own. And so it has been for ages.<br><br>

Twowolves heard this tale, and his eyes were opened. Along with the shamanic teachings of his father, he also learned to mistrust the Humans, and the Elves with them. The Humans mimicked the Elves and their culture, right down to the arrogance the Elves show to everything they do not understand. Never would he let his people be fooled into trusting the Humans or their idols, the Elves, again.<br><br>

As Twowolves neared the completion of his training, he began having strange dreams. Dreams of a darkly beautiful face, with hair as pure white as the snow of his homeland. She seemed to have the delicate features of the Elves, but with the deepest blue tint to her skin. Instinctively he knew though she was kin of Elves, she was like no other. Twowolves spoke to Soars-With-Eagles about his dreams, and together they contemplated them around the council fire. At long last, it was decided these were no mere dreams, but visions, sent by the spirits. Twowolves knew he must leave his people and search the length and breadth of Antonica for the beauty of his dreams. And so it came to pass that Twowolves left his tribe to continue wandering the tundra and traveled to Halas.<br><br>

Halas was the only permanent settlement of his people, not truly a city but a trading post where Humans would come to economically rob his people with false trades. It was there that he met Sotarsh, and with him Strako, Oboo, Lojki, and others like them. They each felt the same way as he did about the Humans and Elves. And so together with others, a band was formed, known as the Bears of Oboo. Together Twowolves hunted with his adopted tribe, and their numbers grew. Their trust in him also grew, and along with Sister Cania, Brother Dedrevian, and Brother Cyfrost, Twowolves was granted the honor of the rank of officer. It was the proudest day of his young life, but something still seemed to be missing. He still dreamed of Her, the dark elven beauty.<br><br>

So one day, Twowolves left his frozen home, along with Sotarsh, Lojki, and Strako, on a quest. Together they ran from one end of Antonica to the other, and still farther east they went, across the Ocean of Tears, to the land of Dwarves and Elves. The Dwarves, though different and strange, accepted him on the merits of his battle prowess, and granted him the magical Bloodforge Hammer. The Elves, however, snubbed him at every turn, when not outright demeaning and rude. So he left to return home, where he would meet Her.<br><br>

She was a striking beauty of a race Twowolves had never before heard of, called the Teir'Dal, or Dark Elves. She was beautiful, exotic and most of all, Her, the lady of his visions. Her name was Nanami, and she looked at him like no other woman ever had before. The Humans and Elves hated her and her people, so she couldn't be all bad. He met and traveled with her and another of her kind, Xixx, trying to learn about her and her people's ways. Soon, it was clear that she was indeed the one. He spoke with her about his visions at length, where she informed him that she too, had known he was searching for her. They soon fell madly in love, and were engaged to be wed. Blinded by the mad bliss of their love, the visions stopped. But still, the both of them know, the gods have a greater plan for the two of them. Twowolves and Nanami are confident they can achieve whatever task is put before them so long as they can be together.<br><br>
