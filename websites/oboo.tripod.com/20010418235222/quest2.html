<p class=subhead>The Langseax Quest</p>
<p>

Here are the best quest instructions for these warrior-only weapons: <br><br>

This is the quest for Langseax, a quest that must almost specifically be completed by a barbarian warrior or a shaman with good faction because it takes PERFECT faction with the Wolves of the North. Talk to Teria O'Danos on the docks of Halas and she tells you to bring her a shipment of Lion's Meat from West Karana.<br><br>

Go to West Karana and tell Milsa in the barbarian village "I will deliver lion's meat to Halas." Take the meat back to Teria and she will give you Lion's Delight, which you must give to Iceberg the giant Polar Bear. He is almost always by Tundra Jack's side and they usally hang out at Megan's Tower in EverFrost. Give Iceberg the meat and he will give you a sweaty shirt.<br><br>

Take the shirt back to WK and give to Frostbite, the dog at the fishing village. He will then lead you to one of two thieves in the hills. If you are lead to Basil, he is lvl 19. Pangan is the other bandit and he is lvl 23. Kill either bandit and loot their head.<br><br>

Take the head to Renth McLanis, a warrior trainer in the tavern in Halas. If you give him Basil's head, you will receive the Langseax, a one-handed magical sword that is 6dam 23del and WARRIOR ONLY. Pangan's head will get you the Langseax of the Wolves, a two-hander that is 19dam 44del, +5 STR +5 DEX. Good questing!<br><br>

[Note: An easy way to check your faction for this quest is to go to Renth and say "I will hunt the murderer." If he gives you more information about it, you have high enough faction to complete the quest. A great way to raise your faction is to give gnoll fangs to Lysbeth McNaff in sets of three. She is at the Pit of Doom.] <br><br>
