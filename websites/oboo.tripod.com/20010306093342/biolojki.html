<p class=subhead>Lojki's Biography</p>

<p>Lojki grew up in the same suburb as Strako X (Formerly known as Herbert Vanderstein, though he won't admit it). From a young age, Lojki was always up on the newest music, and consequently started playing guitar at an early age. He would sneak out of his house at night and go down to the local "sugar shack" and bring his guitar and sit outside on the steps and play along with all the blues Barbarian musicians.<br><br>

One night one of the musicians came out to have a smoke and heard young Lojki playing along with the band, he was so impressed that he invited Lojki to come and play with the band. From that night on, Lojki was down there playing with the band.<br><br>

Soon Lojki left home and moved to Halas. He played where ever he could, the Halas Vanguard, the Oasis, The Ice Spot, to name a few. He soon began to be known as Lojki "Red" cause his licks were so hot.<br><br>

Lojki and his "brothers" began to notice "vanilla" musicians sneaking into Halas to listen to the music that they played. At first Lojki didn't mind, till he went down to Qeynos one weekend and saw Humans and Elves all over copying his licks exactly, note for note.<br><br>

Lojki and a few other musicians started playing harder and faster, they created a style of music called Bop, which for a while white musicians couldn't understand or keep up with the licks. But as always they managed to copy it and take it back to Qeynos where they had the majority of the record contracts and radio airplay.<br><br>

Lojki and his crew kept trying to switch styles: cool jazz, hard bop, avante, free jazz. But always the Humans and Elves were a few steps behind just waiting to copy what they heard. Lojki finally fed up with this, decided that the only way to keep Humans and Elves from copying his music was to take up his hammer and start bashing on them.<br><br>

It was at this point in his life that he met up with Oboo and Strako again, who after their own inner experiences felt that they all shared a common hatred for the corruption and oppression by Humans and Elves. The banded together and created The Bears of Oboo.<br><br></p>
