<p class=subhead>Thryth's Biography</p>
<p>
Thryth is a Barbarian Lady (guy playing female character). She has strawberry blonde or light brown hair, depending on the weather. Her face is half painted with blue paint with a slash of blue on the opposite side. This lady ain't beautiful because she is a rogue. Her best skills are dexterity, agility, and strength.<br><br>

Citizens of Halas didn't like Thryth. Very much like the Thryth in the poem Beowulf. When lost and asking them for directions to Halas, she ended up in front of Blackburrow. A quick run through this cave and she was spending her first season in Qeynos.<br><br>

This larger city was much more to her liking. She did a few tasks for Unseen Hands and Bloodsabers, finding her self once again disliked -- this time by Qeynos citizens. While fleeing an embarrassing situation, Thryth found herself on a boat to anywhere. Well, she actually caught a few fish on the boat and docks while waiting around during the trip. Never believe what a rogue says.<br><br>

She got off the boat at the end of the line. Some place called Erudin that looked ready for one speaking Theives Cant and skilled in sneaking around. A strange gnome gave her some summoned food, water, and daggers. Thryth went to the Toxic (sic?) Forest to practice throwing them at snakes and smallish animals like that. That's how she passed her 2nd season among dark-skinned strangers; but, they were more friendly than the humans she had met. The citizens here have appreciated learning new languages she can teach; and, she has learned to speak Erudin.<br><br>

Now into her third season, Thryth has smuggled items from the Island of Odus to the big city of Qeynos under the disguise of delivering mail. She has found a small group of hunters who are also of her same level. They have been raiding a Kobold village across the river and next to the mountains. However, they usually die when the Kobold Shaman comes to help out the Watchers and Scouts.<br><br>

After making her fortune as a smuggler and in the Qeynos Sewers, she will return to Halas, cooking cold sandwiches while lurking inside a snow bank by the doc in front of the bait shop.<br><br>

If you see her, stop by and chat. She may have some nice beginners items for sale, trade, or as a reward for brave deeds and guild quests. (These might be Limestone rings, Rat Shaped rings, Alligator Earrings, Gold Necklaces, Order of Thunder Amulets, Gold Studs, Cloth Armor, and similar items found in the Qeynos Aqueducts under the city; but, sometimes not familiar to barbarians raised in Halas.) If needed, she may also be available as a guide for traveling around Qeynos and over the mountains to Freeport.
