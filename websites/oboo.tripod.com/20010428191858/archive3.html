Well, the most important news so far is that Taradin and Nananea have firmed up their wedding date, and it will be a little later than expected.  They are getting married on Saturday, April 15, at the Temple of Solusek Ro, and we're all very, very excited about it.  You can read about it on the <a href=events.html>Events</a> page.<br><br>

Speaking of which, the <a href=events.html>Events</a> page now has a calendar that has been added to it, the product of a fair amount of work that I had to do because I didn't really know how to get the damn columns right!  Anyway, it's there and ready to go, so please take a look.<br><br>

Have also updated the <a href=roster>Roster</a> page to reflect recent cell assignments for the new Bears.  Please take a look at the <a href=roster1.html>Cell Assignments</a> page if you're not certain what cell you're in.<br><br>

It clearly took too long to get this update out there.  Apologies to all the new bears, bears everyone!<br><br>

Well, let's see.  New stuff ... well, there isn't much new.  I would like to announce that the Bears of Oboo and the Reach of Oboo can now both be found hunting in numbers at a variety of different places.  Oasis, Sister Isle still, HHP, and the Karanas.  So, if you're having trouble finding a group you like, do a quick who all for the Bears and Reach, and you're bound to find someone else who wants to beat on stuff with big sticks.<br><br>

There are a few new guild members, and the roster page has been updated.  Not giving you a hyperlink on that word right now because I'm feeling pretty lazy.  At any rate, their cells have not yet been assigned, as we're having a little organizational chaos going on right now ...<br><br>

Speaking of which, you may or may not have heard that our beloved Cyfrost decided to leave us for a variety of complex reasons.  As it turns out, however, we can all rejoice, because it appears he will come back!  Oh, good old Cyfrost ... you can read about it on our <a href=http://oboo.cybrick.com/ubbcgi/Ultimate.cgi>Message Board</a>, if you'd like to know a little more about it.<br><br>

That's it for now.  Keep sending stuff in!  I'll eventually get around to posting it on our site!

<br><br><br>

Wanted to announce on this page that we have promoted Vallhallan to Lieutenant.  Congratulations, Vall, and thank you for always being willing to share a little slice of your funk ...

Well, some new stuff up today.  First, I've <a href=archive.html>archived</a> the news again, to give us a fresh start.  Maybe this time we can do what I wanted to do a long time ago, and ditch Toboo and Lojki and run this bad boy like a dictatorship!  Just kidding ...<br><br>

Also, a few more screenshots were added both to the <a href=screenshots.html>Screenshots</a> page and to the character profiles, which you can access from the <a href=roster.html>Roster</a>.<br><br>

That's it for now.  May be more updates coming later today, but I'm not certain about that ...
