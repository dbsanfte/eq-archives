<p class=subhead>Tips for Hunting in Everfrost</p>
<p>

Since Everfrost is our main hunting area at this point, I thought I would do my best to put down some thoughts on these hallowed stompin' grounds.<br><br>

For levels 8 - 14, I think the best place to hang out is the "icewall". You can reach it by going from Halas to Snowflake, and then hanging a right along the cliffs and hugging that wall without going up any canyons. You'll get to the corner of the zone and then you should turn left, continuing to follow the cliff wall. Eventually you'll hit a frozen river. The "icewall" is where the river hits the zone edge and forms an ice waterfall. If you stay right up against the wall, you have a safe place to rest and meditate.<br><br>

A backup pulling point, for characters that are slightly higher level is right outside the main entrance to Permafrost. The ice giants there won't attack if you stay outside the walls of the entrance (and don't meditate right next to the walls). You can pull from the area in front of you back to your party outside Perma. Note that you will occasionally get an orc wandering through the camp area, so be ready to handle that. Also, a named shaman outlaw spawns out there (I'm not sure what level but no higher than 15 or so). Kill him for his head and take it back to the shaman guild for a quest.<br><br>

From either spot, a puller can run out to bring baddies back to the wall where the group can beat on them. The typical creatures you'll find around that area are:
</p><p class=Normalindent>
Snow Leopards: level 6-8<br>
Giant Wooly Spiders: level 6-8 (weak poison)<br>
Snow Orc Troopers: level 8-10 (drop rusty weapons and wrath orc bands)<br>
Snow Orc Mountaineers: level 12-15 (same drops as trooper)<br>
Wooly Mammoth Calves: level 11-15 (drop small tusks)<br>
Snow Orc Shaman: level 13-16 (drop bronze weapons, rawhide and bands)<br>
Ice Bone Skeletons: level 11-13 (only hit by magic and magic weapons)<br></p>
<p>
You should note that everything there except the spiders and the mammoth calves are KOS if they con blue or higher to you. When pulling, you have to be very careful to avoid running past other baddies and picking up a train. SOW helps but isn't required -- if you don't have it, just jump a few times towards the beginning of the pull to get a head start.<br><br>

Don't bother the ice bone skeletons until you have at least 2 guys with magic weapons.<br><br>

Finally, if you do pick up more than you can handle, the nearest guard is the 1 guard station at the first major canyon heading up towards BB. The puller should run there to try to ditch whatever the problem creature is: note that you obviously won't make it there without SOW, but at least you're close to your default spawn point if you die. Try to stay along the zone wall so you can find your body again.<br><br>

One other thing: leave the wooly mammoths alone. You may be tempted because they look the same deep red on con that the shaman do (to a level 10), but they're actually right around level 25. They'll waste you and your entire party.<br><br>

Feel free to add tips to this thread, anyone!<br><br>
