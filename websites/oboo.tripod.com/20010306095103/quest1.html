<p class=subhead>The Bloodforge Hammer Quest</p>
<p>

Instructions for questing for a bloodforge hammer:<br><br>

The Bloodforge Hammer is very slow 2H blunt, but has excellent stats - and is rather valuable to sell as well. It also glows like a greater lightstone - making it a nice weapon for barbarian types.<br><br>

The quest starts in Kaladim, the city of the dwarves. However, it makes more sense for us to do this quest starting by killing Trumpy and then going to raise faction in Kaladim/turn in the head.<br><br>

Anyway - once your faction with the warriors guild in Kaladim is up to amiable - you can do this quest. (Kill crushbone orcs to raise your faction with these guys). See Byzel Bloodforge - he tells you a tale of woo about Trumpy Irontoe - and how he ran off on his sister - anyway, he wants his head, badly.<br><br>

Find Trumpy in Qeynos - in a tavern called the Fish Ale. Hail him and then ask him "Who is Sragg?" At this point, he'll walk outside. The best way to go from there is to wait until he's alone in an alley and then bash his brains out. A level 12-14 person should be able to handle him.<br><br>

Loot Trumpy's head and return it to the original guy in Kaladim. Lots of travel involved in this quest, but the weapon is worth it.<br><br>

Be careful that doing this quest repeatedly will make you KOS with the residents of the bar in Qeynos and the corrupt Qeynos guards. <br><br>
