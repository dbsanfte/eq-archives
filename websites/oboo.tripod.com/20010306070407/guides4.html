<p class=subhead>South Karana Hunting Guide</p>
<p>
This is a great hunting zone for levels 20 - 30, located just south of the North Karana zone.  The good MOBs to hunt here include Aviaks, Centaurs, Gnolls, and Treants.  To get to South Karana, cross the stone bridge from North Karana.<br><br>

The only real problem with this zone is the lack of nearby bind points for non-casters.  The closest bind points are Highhold Pass (you have to run through East and North Karana to get to South Karana) and the Arena (you have to swim through Lake Rathe to get to South Karana).  Highhold is closer if you're taking centaurs or treants, and Arena is closer if you're taking Aviaks.<br><br>

Kiting is a viable way to handle all MOBs here because there is lots of room to run around.<br><br><br>


<b>Aviaks</B> (level 18 - 31):  The easiest ones are the egrets, ranging from level 18 - 20.  The others (in order of difficulty) are darters (20-22), rooks (22-24), harriers (24-26) and avocets (28-31).<br><br>

The Aviak Treehouse is located in the southwest corner of the zone, around LOC -6800, 1150.  Many aviaks spawn in and around the treehouse -- groups camp out on the ground below the house and pull aviaks from the platforms down or aviaks wandering aviaks from the surrounding plains.  The top of the treehouse has room for 1 group, but there are 5 spawn points there and they tend to be tougher than the ones below.  Aviaks will help each other out if they see friends getting beat on.  One other note -- don't kill the named aviak at the top of the tree -- he's a merchant and he doesn't give experience.<br><br>

Aviaks are great because you can kill as many as you want and you never get KOS with them.  Dumb birds.  There is also an Aviak Vendor basically right on site and, though he won't sell to Barbarians, others in your group can sell loot that the aviaks drop right to him!  Aviak Avocets occasionally drop black pearls that sell for big money.<br><br><br>


<b>Centaurs</B> are located in a village in the northeast quadrant of the zone (around LOC 200, -2400).  They range from level 18 - 32, and are generally tougher than aviaks of the same level.  Centaurs will never KOS either, and you can sell the loot you get from them to a centaur merchant right there!  Centaur foals (18-20) are the easy ones, followed by shelties (22-24), archers (23-25) and chargers (28-32).<br><br>

The centaur village is set up with 4 houses all facing into the middle.  If you attack a centaur in a house, all of the others in that house (usually 3 or 4) will jump in to the battle.  The walls of the houses are bugged, so you can employ the following strategy to make things easier if you have a group with lots of casters:  Everyone should walk into the target house and select the first centaur to attack.  Then (before attacking), leave him selected and go around the back of the house.  On the count of three, everyone nuke the selected centaur.  The spells go through the wall, but they get hung up on the wall and they won't (usually) run around to melee you.  DOTs work really well here.  Once the MOBs are weakened, the tanks can actually go up to the back of the house and attack through the wall.  At this point though, the MOBs will hit you back.  They hit hard for their level, so watch out.<br><br><br>



<b>Treants</B> are located in the northeast corner along the zone edge.  There are two spawns right next to each other, both around level 24 and on a 5 minute cycle.<br><br>

Treants are casters, but aren't too strong for their level.  They are very slow, too.  They carry great cash loot -- usually between 4-8 pp each -- and they other pretty good experience.<br><br>

The one problem is that killing them gives bad faction with Qeynos Guards, so after doing them for a while, you'll have to kill some gnolls to make up for it.<br><br><br>


<b>Gnolls</B> are generally located in the area around the Splitpaw entrance, right in the middle of the zone.  I believe they range from level 24 - 30, but there are weaker ones wandering around the plains.  I don't have a lot of information on hunting them in South Karana.  Don't even think about going into Splitpaw until you're at least level 30.<br><br><br>


<b>The Hermit</B>, a level 20 MOB, spawns every three minutes (after he is killed) in his house at -5400, -2400.  Two tricks for hunting him: first, his front door is locked so you have to get him to come out of his house after you.  You can do this by standing next to the chimney and /saying "I will kill you." or by standing in the same spot and casting a player-based area effect spell (color flux for enchanters or an AE damage song for bards).  Then tear ass out of the compound area -- he'll be right on your heels and it's easier to deal with him outside than inside.  Next, killing him.  Kiting is an option (solo with a 21 or 22 level character or two 17 level characters work).  Toboo and a mage were able to handle him at level 17 by ping-ponging him between us with DOT and DD spells while letting our pets hammer away.  Toboo threw in a memory blur spell every once in a while during the fight just so he wouldn't get too pissed at either of us.<br><br><br>



A few other notes of particular interest to shaman: South Karana has a number of components for the Shaman-only armor quests.  You can get Bull Elephant Teeth, Treant Bark, and Charger Hoofs off MOBs there.  People will sometimes send /shouts that these items are available for loot at such-and-such an LOC.  Get there fast if you're close.<br><br>
