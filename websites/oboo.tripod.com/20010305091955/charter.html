The Bears of Oboo Guild Charter
</P>

<P>
<BR>
The Bears of Oboo is a neutrally-aligned guild, dedicated to the organization and mobilization of the great Barbarian and Erudite masses of Norrath. We believe that Humans and Elves take far central and oppressive a role in the world of Everquest. We further believe that the other neighbors, particularly the Barbarian and Erudite neighbors of Qeynos, need to stand as one and make our presence known to the Humans of Qeynos. We must impress upon them that they are our guests in Blackburrow, and that they can hunt gnolls only because we allow them to do so. We, the minority, need to take a stance of solidarity against the Humans, and let our oppressors know that they can no longer keep us down and oppressed. Stand up for your rights and let your voice be heard!

<BR>
<BR>

In the words of our brother, a scrawny gnoll, &quot;You filthy humans have ruined your own lands. You'll not ruin mine. A scrawny gnoll hits YOU for 8 points of damage.&quot;</TD>

Our central principles that we shall attempt to spread throughout the land with our guild as the instrument:<BR><BR></td></tr>


<TR valign=top><TD><p>1.</TD> <TD><p>That while our capital is wherever our people are, through a long history of oppression, the Humans and Elves have required us to centralize our government. We hereby declare Halas, our piece of the rock, a chocolate city if you will, the new capital of Norrath, a place where brothers and sisters can come together as one.</TD></TR>

<TR valign=top><TD><p>2.</TD> <TD><p>Qeynos is more of a Halas suburb, and a vanilla one at that.</TD></TR>

<TR valign=top><TD><p>3.</TD> <TD><p>Respect blackburrow gnolls, for it is obvious by their threads, large ring mail, that they have taste and style, and because they, too, fight against the oppression of humans and elves.</TD></TR>

<TR valign=top><TD><p>4.</TD> <TD><p>We want freedom. We want power to determine the destiny of our oppressed Barbarian communities.</TD></TR>

<TR valign=top><TD><p>5.</TD> <TD><p>The Barbarians are truly gainin' on the humans.</TD></TR>

<TR valign=top><TD><p>6.</TD> <TD><p>The Bears of Oboo support all Everquest rules of conduct.</TD></TR>

<TR valign=top><TD><p>7.</TD> <TD><p>We strenuously object to the guard brutality and outright racism exhibited by the inhabitants of Qeynos and Freeport. We will no longer stand aside as merchants refuse to sell to us and as guards refuse to help us, stealing our kills instead. We ask that our NPC merchants stop selling to humans who march into our lands, while merchants throughout Qeynos and Freeport will not sell to us and our kind.</TD></TR>

<TR valign=top><TD><p>8.</TD> <TD><p>Barbarians and Erudites who choose to share their guild tags with Humans and Elves are traitors to our cause. The Bears of Oboo believe, however, that these Humans and Erudites should be treated with pity, not with the hatred that we reserve for Humans and Elves.</TD></TR>

<TR valign=top><TD><p>9.</TD> <TD><p>James Brown is the Godfather of Funk.</TD></TR>
