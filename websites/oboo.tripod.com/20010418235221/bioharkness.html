<p class=subhead>Harkness's Biography</p>
<p>
Harkness comes from a nomadic tribe of Erudites, forever wandering the lands since their native land had been despoiled and overrun by Humans. His family had been displaced since the Third War of Human Aggression, where the Humans took over the hilly pastures where Harkness’s people once lived in peace with the bears and rats and wolves of the land. This area, now known as Qeynos Hills, has been overrun by rabid animals since the Humans, who have no sense of their place in the delicate relationship of all living things, took the land over.<br><br>

Harkess’s parents wanted a better life for him. Due to the great poverty that Harkess’s tribe historically endured, his parents left him, an infant in swaddling clothes, at the doors of a house in Qeynos. The young Human couple that had recently purchased the house took Harkness in, fed and clothed him, and enrolled him in the Qeynos Academy for Young Men.<br><br>

After living through three years of constant racial harassment, during which he cried himself to sleep every night, Harkness was expelled from the school. The charge to expel him was led by a the Coalition of Concerned Human Parents, whose reasons were a "distrust of racial impurity," and a desire to "remain true to the historical precedent of human-only enrollment at the Academy."  It was at this time that Harkness discovered that his adopted parents, who told him throughout his life that they loved him like a son, were infertile and using Harkness to accrue tax benefits and to allow them to bypass the zoning laws and continue to live in their suburban paradise.  Harkness’s adopted parents, sensing controversy in their white-bread suburban bubble, sold their adopted "son" down the river, sending him to live with foster parents in Erudin.<br><br>

His foster parents, however, taught him the history that the Qeynos Academy for Young Men was afraid to teach, about how the Humans had kicked Erudites out of their homeland by subversive means and lies, and forced them to set up their new hometown in a miserable bog. His foster parents, though destitute and always struggling to make ends meet, treated him with such love and instilled him with such pride in his heritage that Harkness decided he must devote his life to ending the oppression of the Erudites. Befriending his fellow Erudite, Toboo, Harkness entered the Bears of Oboo, and has since been sowing the seeds of discontent wherever there are Humans to be found.<br><br>

To finance the revolution that he was helping to start, Harkness took up smithing.  He can often be seen using the forges in Qeynos deep into the night, creating metal bits in an effort to eventually make banded and sell to unsuspecting humans.  He also hopes to one day outfit an entire Barbarian and Erudite army in banded, who will band together to recapture the lands that are by heredity owed to the Erudites.
