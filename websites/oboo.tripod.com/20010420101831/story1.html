<p class=subhead>Shouting matches</p>

<p>Hello, everyone.  This is Strako.  Just have my little log thingy running all the time and wanted to post some of the funnier shouting matches I've had with people, mostly in Halas, where I feel the history of funk is on my side.<br><br>

I just thought that some of them were pretty funny and that I'd post a few to keep us all amused.  Some of them make me humans look dumb, most of them probably make me look a little dumb ... anyway, I know that Cyfrost engages in similar sorts of shouting matches, and would encourage all Bears of Oboo to advertise your funk with the utmost pride.<br><br>
