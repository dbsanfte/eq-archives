<p class=subhead>Cyfrost's Biography</p>

<p>
Born in the city of Halas on March 15th, 3152; to Cyfrost I and Halley Manglewulf.  His father was a local shaman in the northern town of Halas, and his mother was a traditional woman tending to the household duties and raising the children.  Cyfrost was the first born, then came his sister, Omi; and then his younger brother McDermitt.  He was born in a time when Halas was prosperous.  The majestic lake that was nestled between the great northern town and the Everfrost mountains teemed with life, including fish, seals, walrus, and sea lions.<br><br>

The first years of his life we spent around the house with his mother and younger siblings.  He learned to respect his elders, as well as nature and the spirits around him.  His father began indoctrinating him in the ways and traditions of the Tribunal from an early age.<br><br>

When he was five years old, and only six months after the birth of MacDermitt, a dispute arouse involving the humans of Queynos and the Elders of the town.  Being a spiritual leader of the town, Cyfrost I was asked to help in mediating the discussions between the barbarians and the humans concerning fishing rights within the lake of Halas.  The council meetings held did not seem to be solving the problem of humans plundering the lake for fish and other natural resources.  Soon, the humans of Queynos and surrounding areas began slaughtering the sea lions, walrus' and the baby seals.  Cyfrost I, was called to war against the human incursion by the Tribunal.  A bloody six day battle occurred with many fatalities on both sides, including the death of his father Cyfrost Manglewulf I.<br><br>

Ironically, the gnolls of Blackburrow found this to be an opportunity which they could capitalize upon.  With both the humans and the barbarians fighting each other, the gnoll hoardes rose up from the burrow and began a blood bath of their own.  Killing both barbarians of the north, and humans of the south indescrimately.  Yet, this unforeseen event helped quell the human attack on the northern areas, and to this day Blackburrow is still a dangerous place to travel through.<br><br>

Having no skills of her own, and three young children, the Tribunal took the Manglewulf family under its wing, with the provision that Cyfrost II begun his tutelage in the ways of being a shaman like his father.  Halley reluctantly agreed to this proposition, not wanting to force her son to do anything he did not wish.  <br><br>

As Cyfrost II grew up in the Tribunal's care, he whole-hearted threw himself into his studies, and truly became concerned for the barbarian people of Halas.  He studied their history, and learned of many other trials and tribulations with the humans of the southern lands.  He heard stories of how barbarians were refused goods and services from merchants of Queynos, and when things were sold to them it was for a higher price.<br><br>

At the age of twenty-one, in the year of 3173 in the month of March, he was initiated as a full-fledge Shaman of the Six Hammers.  <br><br><br><br>



Currently, Cyfrost is twenty-three years of age, and has begun travelling the Everfrost Peaks and beyond helping and aiding the barbarians of Halas.  With his training from the Tribunal, he has dedicated himself to persuing injustice at every turn.  He has learned patience and knows that in the end the Six Hammers will fall upon any offender of the Tribunal.  He has become an enemy of the gnolls of Blackburrow, as he has slaughtered many of the young.<br><br>

He found a group of individuals of like-mindedness toward the human incursion within his northern homeland.  He fought along side Cania, gaining her trust and friendship.  Not long afterwards, he was invited into the Guild called the Bears of Oboo.  <br><br>

Shortly after becoming a member of the Bears of Oboo, and fellow guild-mate named Dedrevian took him to Queynos to help him with an errand.  Without realizing what they were there for, he found himself intermingled in a plot to kill a dwarf named Trumpy Irontoe.  Standing along side his guild-mate, he slew Trumpy and took his head.  Dedrevian, Cania, Strako and several others helped him travel to Kaladim to turn over Trumpy's head to the Bloodforge family for a reward.  In return he was given a magical hammer, known as the Bloodforge Hammer.  It has been his weapon of choice to this day.<br><br>

It was not long before Cyfrost proved his loyalty, trust and honor to the Bears of Oboo.  In doing so, he was quickly promoted to Lieutenant within the Guild.  He has not journeyed far from his homeland, preferring to stay near Halas and help the barbarian people as much as possible.  He has strived to promote the Bears of Oboo and their cause wherever he goes, and to right the wrongs brought upon his people.  <br><br>
