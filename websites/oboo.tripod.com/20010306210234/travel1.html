<p class=subhead>Halas to Freeport</p>
<p>

I know several among us have already made and survived the journey (although I hear Sotarsh had a close call in Highpass), but I thought I would quickly jot down a few notes about each of the zones in making that trip. **Note - You need SOW for this trip. For your sanity and safety, either know how to cast SOW or go with someone who does. It'll run out twice during the trip.**<br><br>

<b>Everfrost</B> - Obviously, head to BB. Watch out for those darn vengefuls.<br><br>

<b>Blackburrow</B> - Just run through and don't beat on any trains.<br><br>

<b>Qeynos Hills</B> - Hold your nose so you don't smell the humans! Just hang a left as soon as you exit the BB cave and stay along the zone wall until you hit a road. Turn left and follow it to the zone.<br><br>

<b>West Karana</B> - As soon as you exit the pass, turn right and follow the zone wall to the water. Visit with your friendly barbarian brothers at the fishing village. Then follow the water all the way (it's LONG) to the zone.<br><br>

<b>North Karana</B> - Continue to follow the water, going past a stone bridge. The bridge that you pass goes to South Karana, for future reference. You'll want to continue along the water until you can see a crowd of NPCs in the distance next to the water. This is a bandit camp -- they'll mess you up if you come near. When you can see them turn about 45 degrees to the left (heading northeast now) and run straight until you hit the water again. Then turn left and follow the water until you come to another bridge. Turn right and cross the bridge to East Karana.<br><br>

<b>East Karana</B> - Dangerous zone. Hang a quick left as soon as you get off the bridge. You'll spot some stone ruins up ahead... Turn right before you get too close to the ruins. Stay going that direction until you pass a camp on your left (bad guys there too). Stay going straight and you'll run into a little town. There's a guard here who will protect you a little. Catch your breath and then continue in the direction you were going but angle a little right to follow the edge of the hills on your left. Eventually you'll come to a road. Hang a left on that road and run ALL the way up the pass.<br><br>

<b>Highpass</B> - Another dangerous zone. It's best to find a map of it on the internet before you run through, but basically you'll want to run under the welcome sign, and then take your first left turn followed by a quick right. This will dump you out at the Highkeep Gate, where there are a bunch of guards waiting. Get bound here if at all possible. Highpass is a city zone, so anyone can bind you anywhere in the zone. Next, go straight out of the gates and up the ramp. Take your first left (carefully -- if you miss it you'll be dumped into a big-time KOS camp, where Sotarsh almost met his end, from what I understand) and follow the passage until you get to the other welcome sign. Go under it and around the corner until you can see the wide spot in the canyon. As long as there are people standing around fighting orcs, you'll be OK in running right through to the zone edge. If there are just a bunch of orcs standing there looking mean, you might as well camp and do the rest later. They'll give you a beat down you won't forget.<br><br>

<b>Kithicor Forest</B> - Another REALLY dangerous zone. If you can get a caster in Highpass to cast invisible on you, do it. Also, only go through this zone during the game day. Never the night. Bad things come out at night. As soon as you zone, follow the wall on your left the whole way across the zone. You'll pass a cave entrance to Rivervale and eventually you'll get to the corner of the zone. Turn the corner and a little ways in front of you is the canyon that leads to the zone exit. Follow it and thank your lucky stars you made it through.<br><br>

<b>West Commonlands</B> - Follow the zone wall to your left the whole way. You'll need to detour around 1-2 NPC camps -- you can see them from far enough away that you won't get attacked. Then zone to...<br><br>

<b>East Commonlands</B> - Follow the zone wall to your left most of the way. Again, you'll have to detour around 2 orc camps which you can see from a little ways away. When you hit a road that runs into a canyon on the left wall, turn right on the road and follow it to a T junction, where you'll bear left. Follow this road to the zone.<br><br>

<b>West Freeport</B> - Run straight from the zone edge to the town gate. Refer to the map in your manual to find what you're looking for. What, You Still Haven't Found What You're Looking For? Well, the dock is in south Freeport. Take the boat that leaves from there to get to Kaladim. If you are going farther onto Faydwer, you should probably get bound in Freeport so you don't have to make that run again. Once you do get to Butcherblock on the other side, you might want to get bound again to save yourself the long boat ride.<br><br>
