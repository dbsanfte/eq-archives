<p class=subhead>The Autobiography of Strako X</p>

<p>Strako X was born Strako Little, in Plainsville, a small suburb of Halas.  Strako exhibited early signs of intelligence and creativity, becoming an early favorite of his teachers even though he was a difficult child to manage, always asking difficult questions and getting into arguments with the other young Barbarians.<br><br>

With the general economic decline of the early 3700s, seen now by most economists as a result of increasing tariffs by Qeynos and Kelethin and the long-term results of poor social mobility throughout Norrath, the Wooly Fungus factory in which Mr. Little worked was closed down.  Strako’s parents were forced to sell their suburban igloo and, when Strako was eight years old, move into the rough ghetto of Halas (the shack near those fenced-up dogs).<br><br>

Once enrolled in the Halas public school system, Strako was faced with increasing poverty and ignorance, and watched as roaming Barbarian gangs harassed the hard-working people of Halas. Friends of his, armed with splintering clubs and patchwork zoot suits, fought off these thugs and drove them back to their Half Elf patrons.<br><br>

Shortly thereafter, Strako and two childhood friends formed the Bears of Oboo, a guild dedicated to the education and mobilization of the great Barbarian masses and named after the great mythical Oboo, who fought off the initial onslaught of the Human Hordes and stood tall among trains of scrawny gnolls. Originally filled with so much Barbarian pride that it blinded them to the truth, the three founders let hatred creep into their lives, and refused to get up or get down with anyone unless they wore a bear hat.<br><br>

Following the much-documented pilgrimage to Lavastorm, Strako realized the error of his ways and embraced all oppressed races. He still, however, cannot stand the stench of humans.<br></p>
