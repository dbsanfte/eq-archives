I think I got rid of all of the links to the non-existant old message board.  The new message board continues to pick up steam, and I've been pretty happy with it.<br><br>

Oboo sent in a new <a href=stories.html>story</a>, and Twowolves submitted two new <a href=screenshots.html>screenshots</a> of the Million Man March.  Enjoy!<br><br>

OK.  Hope all is well with everyone.  Oh, so you know, I think we're going to try and get a Bears/Reach hunting schedule up, with a night or two a week where you'll be guaranteed some hunting partners.  Have yet to speak to the Reach management about it, but will let you know when it gets worked out.

Well, the Million Man March was a <b>smashing</B> success, at least in my humble estimation of it.  Great turnout, high Human annoyance factor, and wonderful publicity for our cause.  The drunken nakedness that ensued afterward didn't hurt, either.<br><br>

I don't have time for a serious update right now, but have put up a <a href=screenshots.html>screenshot</a> of the event, and hope to receive many more from others in the next few days.  Will also probably be posting some sort of log of the whole event, as the log itself was pretty hilarious.<br><br>

Also, I've been continually updating the <a href=roster.html>Roster list</a> as changes happen, and don't always make announcements about it.<br><br>

The old message board is now down, as I've gotten everything from it that I needed.  Haven't had time to update all the links, but will do so soon.<br><br>

That's basically it.  Expect more updates later in the week when RL stuff is no longer keeping me down!  It's the man stepping on my head and complaining that his foot hurts.

As promised, the long-awaited <b>big update</B> has arrived.  Well, probably not awaited at all by anyone but me.  Anyway, I've just put in a bunch of Oboo-authored guides, and we should be about up-to-date on all member-written guides.<br><br>

The Million Man March has been publicized as much as we could on such short notice.  We should be on the Server calendar on Lanys.com as soon as they do their next update, and the server board admin on Stratics called this the first server event.  Anyway, it's also up on the news portion of the Stratics main page.  We think this will be the first peaceful demonstration of its kind, on any server, and we're looking for a huge Oboo presence, so please attend if you can.<br><br>

I feel like I've somehow managed to downplay the significance of the Reach of Oboo being tagged, as we haven't really talked about how to merge these two guild Websites, and as I haven't been able to play much at all since they got tagged.  If you're looking to create a second character, and were thinking about something like a Gnome or High Elf (shame on you!), then we hope you'll make a Dark Elf, Troll, or Ogre instead, and get to know our brothers and sisters in the struggle.<br><br>

Lastly, please continue to submit content to the site.  It is all very much appreciated.

<p>
<a href=http://www.lepimp.com>The Reach of Oboo</a> is tagged!  Wonderful, happy times for all of those opposed to human oppression!<br><br>

Having said that, the Bears of Oboo are dismantling their controversial Community Outreach Program.  As Yukyo has left to join Xixx (we will miss them both dearly), the Progam appears to have outlived its usefulness, and is therefore now defunct.  From this point forward, the Bears of Oboo will be Erudite and Barbarian only.<br><br>

Submissions keep on coming.  Please continue to check to see the bios, screenshots, and generally new material that comes in.<br><br>

The Million Man March is being scheduled for this Sunday, February 13, at 5:00 pm Eastern Standard Time.  Please report to Everfrost, at the ramp to Halas.  We will be leaving at 5:00 pm sharp.  Details of the <a href=events.html>event</a> will be given out at the time of departure, but this will be an event to harrass and humiliate Humankind as well as to spread awareness and knowledge as to our noble cause.  Unlike some more festive events, the March will be alcohol free ... anyone caught with booze will be sent to detention.

More news!  The hits keep coming!<br><br>
Well, I spoke with Xixx over the RL phone last night, and we discussed, among other things, a new domain name for the Oboo site.  One free from this annoying pop-up banner, which will be nice.  Anyway, looks like we'll be registered as bears.oboo.com, and the Reach of Oboo will be reach.oboo.com, but you're going to have to give us a little more time to work out the details.  We'll let you know as these things happen.<br><br>
Also, I'm working on bringing over the content from the message board.  I have added five new features to accommodate the new content: <a href=classes.html>Class Guides</a>, <a href=travel.html>Travel Guides</a>, <a href=quests.html>Quest Guides</a>, <a href=guides.html>General Player Guides</a>, and <a href=links.html>Links</a>.  These pages are not anywhere close to done, though they should be in better shape by the end of the week.<br><br>
In other exciting news, I hear that male Barbarians are finally going to get their shields!  From the horse's mouth (Gordon at Verant), the shields will show up when we get the expansion.

<p>
Sotarsh has been kind enough to host a <a href=http://oboo.cybrick.com/ubbcgi/Ultimate.cgi>message board</a> for the Bears of Oboo on his development server, as well as one for the Reach of Oboo.  Please note that, due to the improvement made to the interface, we will be using these new boards.  Please bookmark them accordingly.

News, news, news.  Xixx has started a Web page for the <a href=http://www.lepimp.com>Reach of Oboo</a>.  Don't bookmark this page just yet, as I'm not sure Xixx plans to stay with that domain name.  At any rate, as you all can see, it looks absolutely stellar.  Hmmm ... and then there's this Web page, which I'm writing in straight HTML while bored at work.<br><br>
Also, take a look at <a href=http://www.lanys.com>lanys.com</a> for a little preview of the publicity effort that Vyvyd has begun for the Barb raid on Crushbone, scheduled for a week from this Saturday.  It will be a lot of fun, and I'm sure Cania will bring some munchies for us all as we trek up highpass.<br><br>
Lastly, we have two bios and are waiting on screenshots from you all.  I'm not going to make announcements for every stupid little thing I add to this site, but take a look around at the framework we have right now for everything.  I think it's beginning to take form.  And, please, email me your submissions for the Website (I'm looking at you, Yukyo) at oboo@mailcity.com.

Hello, everyone!  As you can see, today marks a new era in the Bears of Oboo website.  I would still like to issue the disclaimer that I don't know anything about Web design or HTML, and that I'm sorry you all have to put up with the best thing that I can muster, which is, quite unfortunately, this page.<br><br>
At any rate, exciting news!  The Reach of Oboo, an allied guild, has been started by Xixx last night.  I believe she is now awaiting approval of the guild charter and then the email by a guide, but after that we should be good to go.  Clearly, once it's up, we'll have the link to their Website up here, or we may combine the two in this Web page in order to foster solidarity between the two.<br><br>
I would also like to remind everyone to go and check out Vyvyd's page, <a href=http://www.shiznat.com/vyvyd/>http://www.shiznat.com/vyvyd/</a>, which is devoted to a mainly Barbarian raid on Crushbone.

Guild stuff is going wonderfully.  Cania is baking up a storm, my Erudite character is starting the long trip toward being a smither, and Yukyo and Twowolves are living through the period of bliss and confusion that precedes marriage.<br><br>
As far as the Dark Elf question.  My understanding is that the sister guild, name still up to Xixxie-poo, will be petitioning for a tag soon.  Please take a look at the message board for more info on this discussion, and also for many other topics.  For instance, a new guild member, Vyvyd, is organizing a Barbarian raid on Crushbone in two weeks, and I imagine there will be a post there about the event pretty soon.<br><br>
Also, Congratulations to Cyfrost and Lilu for promotion to Lieutenant!  Thank you both for all of your energy and work.

Well, it hasn't been a quiet week with the Bears of Oboo, as one might guess from the lack of updates to the Website.  There hasn't been too much to report, however, except for some debate as to the future of our guild, which I think is a great thing, both to clarify our standpoint and to make Bears look deep into their funk and think about why they are fighting the good fight.<br><br>
The big news is that Twowolves and Yukyo announced their engagement last night, after everyone present apparently consumed about twenty Blackburrow stouts apiece.  Strako was, unfortunately, not present for the announcement, which sounds like it was a good time for all.  We are still awaiting word as to when the blessed day will be.<br><br>
And, finally, we've had a flurry of new recruiting activity, which is reflected in our updated <a href=roster.html>Members</a> page.  Please note that, while there is, indeed, strength in numbers, we want each Bear to be qualified and to feel welcome within our ranks.  Please make an effort to get to know the people for whom you are vouching, and to reach out and welcome the new Bears of Oboo.  If there is someone you don't know, please make an effort to get to know them.

Congratulations to Dedrevian for also being promoted to Lieutenant.  His late promotion was not an oversight on our part, but because we didn't have his email address at the time of promotion.<br><br>
We hope everyone is enjoying their time in the Bears of Oboo.  If you're having any sort of problem or concerns with the guild, please feel free to contact any officer about it or to post your concerns on our message board.  Power to the people!

Congratulations to Cania, Sotarsh, Toboo, and Twowolves!  By a consensus in the Ministry, those four Bears of Oboo have been promoted to Lieutenant, and will begin assuming leadership of the Bears of Oboo starting tonight.

Well, today we're introducing a news element to the Bears of Oboo Website.  Quick recap of the events of the last few weeks:
<br><BR>
The Bears of Oboo was originally conceived as Oboo's Bears, a Barbarian-only guild that stood for Barbarian solidarity and a return to the times before the Human and Elven influence on our people (the name Oboo's Bears a was rejected due to punctuation problems). Over the first few weeks of guild planning, however, it was decided to include Erudites as another oppressed race, who have incidentally been known to get down with the best of them. Then, in the recent past, the guild has been opened to all oppressed races with funk. This shift in our guild paradigm involves Oboo X's pilgrimage to the holy land, but that is a story for another time.<br><br>
The guild was approved and recruiting has gone very well. We have a great event planned for the near future, but are working on bolstering our roster and bringing even moremembers into our fold. We are happy to say that each of our members is quite funky.<br><br>
This Website, up from before the guild was approved, has been in a constant state of revision, and numerous new elements have been added, such as this News page. We have also added a members list, rules of the guild, a message board, and a contact information submittal form.<br><br>
The most recent new decision was to allow Dark Elves into our midst. This is because Dark Elves have proven their ability to bring da noise, and also because they have historically had the Man stepping on their head, complaining that his feet hurt.<br><br>
Currently we are discussing the promotion of several members to Lieutenant. Announcements will be made in the near future with regards to promotion.
