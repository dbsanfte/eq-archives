<p class=subhead>Oboo's Biography</p>

<p>Oboo was not so much born as he was delivered to the land of Norrath.  He was found early one morning floating on the raft on the lake of Halas and was brought in from the cold by a family of kind Barbarians.  They found a note explaining the origins of the young boy and, while it spoke of many familar places, no one in Halas had ever heard of the parents, two Barbarians named Oboo and Mirana.  They didn't offer any explanation about why they had abandoned the boy, but they did name the boy Oboo after his father, who seemed to be some sort of powerful tribal shaman.  The boy accepted his adopted parents but was always a quiet and introspective child.  He did always have a special relationship with the milk and muffin vendors of Halas, though, as they always greeted him warmly and favored him with free treats.<br><br>

Soon after his adoption, Oboo's adopted parents brought another young child into their lives.  This was an Erudite, abandoned among the ice goblin igloos.  They named him Toboo.  Oboo and Toboo bonded instantly, and would go everywhere together, tracking snow leopards from afar and playing tricks on snow orcs.<br><br>

As he grew to be a teenager, he would take long walks on the cold tundra to consider such issues of where he came from and what he was destined for.  The tundra always seemed more like home than any house or city, its fierce cold feeling more like a loving embrace than a blizzard.  As he grew older and older, he spent more time away from his adopted parents in Halas and out by himself on the icy fields of Everfrost.<br><br>

After 23 harsh winters had passed, he met two other young barbarians, Strako and Lojki.  The three spilled their first orc blood together not long after and thereafter were united by that experience.  They decided to form the Bears of Oboo guild in honor of Oboo's unknown father.  They decided that this organization was needed by the Barbarians of Halas to bring their united power to bear in the world.  The bitter early experiences of Strako solidified the idea that the guild should unite with the forces of Erudin in their struggle against Qeynos and it's Elven allies.<br><br>

Oboo met many wonderful friends as the guild grew in power and size, but he always had an empty place in his heart for his father, his namesake, and, in many ways, his inspiration.  Though the guild grew and continued to need his guidance, he became unable to ignore the call of his father and the true Barbarian spirit, two myths that are intertwined together for him.  It began to plauge him; Strako and Lojki would not see him for weeks at a time.  He began to roam farther and farther into the tundras, and even when we would return to Halas, his eyes seemed haunted and distant.  Worried for his soul, Strako, Lojki, and Toboo tried to follow him, but always lost him in the vast expanses of white.  When they asked him what was on his mind, Oboo would only answer with another question: "Oboo ... what exactly is an Oboo?"<br><br>

So he chose to depart from the homelands, not knowing where he would go, but sure that the answers to both his quests lay somewhere in front of him.  He assured his guildmates that he was not abandoning them forever, but would return from his pilgramage with the answers about the origins of his father, the guild's namesake, and enlightenment on the true spirit of the Barbarian.<br><br>

Before he proudly walked away from the warm fires of Halas, he asked that Toboo, his newfound Erudite cousin, who is wise in the ways of the world and the funk, take over his role as the Minister of FINE Arts.  Toboo nodded in respect and assured Oboo he would stay faithful to his friend's request.<br><br>

Then Oboo waved good bye to his friends and set out on his journey.
