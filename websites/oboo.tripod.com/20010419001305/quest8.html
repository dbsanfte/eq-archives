<p class=subhead>Beginner Everfrost Quests</p>
<p>

The following two Qeynos quests are relatively easy to run and can yield you some pretty reasonable rewards, with a little bit of time put in.<br><br>

<b>The Band of Rodcet Nife:</B><br>
Talk to Enic Ruklin at the Temple of Life and he will say he has to deal with a [problem]. It turns out a pesky barbarian and his dog Frostbite visit Qeynos on occassion. Frostbite has a tendency to eat the sacred Koalindl fish from the Temple. Enic must find Frostbite and retrieve the corpse of the fish. Frostbite can be found at the Barbarian fishing village in the Westren Karanas. Watch out! Ulrich McMannus is very fond of the mutt and will insta-kill you if he sees you harming Frostbite. Also, frostbite does not always have a fish on him when you kill him and killing him causes severe faction drops with several barbarian factions. Deliver the fish corpse and you will get some decent gold and sometimes a nice item as well (I have been told of prayer beads and a Band of Rodcet Nife, which is +3 INT, +10 Mana). A note on this. You can also complete this quest by killing Koalindl fish yourself or through a newbie mule character (which is the better method), taking the severe faction hit, getting killed by the guard, and turning in the fish corpse to Ruklin. <br><br><br>

<b>Cuburt, that wacky little cube of gel</B><br>
Guard Elron at the gate tower has lost his daughter in the sewers, and he wants you to find her. Unfortunately, she has been eaten by Cubert, a gelatinous cube. He usually spawns at location 160, -60. Kill Cubert and get her dress and return for experience, faction, money and a decent item, sometimes a Golden Locket, A Lore item that casts a courage spell with 5 charges. Or in the alternative, give the dress to The NPC standing by the bridge to the bank in Qeynos who works in the aqueducts and he will give you money and an item (usually a Golden Ear Stud, +3 INT earring). You can get Cubert to spawn faster by killing the rats and gelatinous cubes that spawn in his place.
