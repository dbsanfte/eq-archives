<p class=subhead>The Testament of Vanear Quest</p>
<p class=normal>
This is a quest for the Testament of Vanear, a shield-slot item useable by all.  It is a no drop, lore, magic item that gives the holder +10 Wisdom and +10 mana.<BR><BR>

<b>Step One:</B> Seek out Moodoro Finharn, who is at Crows in North Qeynos.
<br><br><b>Step Two:</B> Ask him about The Testament of Vanear.
<br><br><b>Step Three:</B> Give him 2 gold and you will receive a book which has to inventory slots and a combine button in it.
<br><br><b>Step Four:</B> Then, give him 4 gold until you get the Jester Card from him.
</p><p class=normalindent>Aside: Keep the Knights and give them to the dwarf on Erollisi Island for a reward of some kind (ranges from cloth to some pretty nice armor pieces such as blackened and bronze, and even dwarven mail). Sell all the other cards.
</p><b>Step Five:</B> Give the Jester Card back to him and he will give you page 34 of the Testament. You now need page 30. 
<br><br><b>Step Six:</B> You need to go to Highpass now. I will assume you are coming from East Karana, head toward the Kithicor zone. You will see water on your right with a bridge spanning it.
<br><br><b>Step Seven:</B> Swim under the bridge and go underwater. You will see an underwater tunnel on your right.  Swim through there and follow the right wall until you reach another underwater passage.  Swim through this short passage (note: Barbarians will have to duck a few times while swimming to get through this tiny hole) and you will come to dry land on the other side.
<br><br><b>Step Eight:</B> Run up and into the big open area. At the back of the big open area on the right you will see a forge where the NPC with page 30 spawns, Dyllin Starsine (he is wearing a Highhold Pass guard's uniform), a -20 mob. He has a 7 1/2 hour spawn cycle.
<br><br><b>Step Nine:</B> Killing him is easy, but the smugglers, who were green and light blue to a lvl 24, will aid him if they are close by. Root him and use direct damage to put him down quickly.
<br><br><b>Step Ten:</B> Get page 30 from his corpse.
<br><br><b>Step Eleven:</B> Place page 30 (from Dyllin) and page 34 (which you won betting with the quest giver Moodoro) in the Testament of Vanear container and hit combine.
<br><br><b>Step Twelve:</B> You now have a Testament of Vanear!
