<p class=subhead>Tips for Barbarian Warriors</p>
<p>

Though I'm not the expert on warrior tactics, I thought I might get a thread started. I've found that I've shared some of these tips individually with many of the warriors I've grouped with, so it might be nice to put them down in one place.<br><br>

1. For barbarian warriors, use Slam instead of Bash or Kick as your secondary attack. Bash requires a shield, which you don't always have. Kick is fine, but it does roughly the same amount of damage as Slam. Slam has the advantage of stunning opponents after level 20. When you're starting out, put 1 training point into Bash to get this started.<br><br>

2. Maximize all weapons skills, particularly 1H and 2H slash. I also keep piercing up to maximum for each level. You never know what great weapon might come along later in life, and if your skill for that weapon is way behind, you'll never be able to bring it up in time.<br><br>

3. Practice taunt always, when you're in battles that you know you can win. If you don't have it up to the max possible for your level, you may not be able to taunt a bad guy off your casters when you need to.<br><br>

4. Practice archery enough to be able to pull from a distance. Up close, you'll be able to do much more damage with melee.<br><br>

5. When pulling, if you're not SOWed, jump a few times at the beginning to get a head start on the bad guy. You'll hopefully get back to the group in better shape.<br><br>

6. Also when pulling... Watch your route back to the group carefully. In Everfrost for example, every pull should be and can be 1 orc/calf/spider at a time, as long as you don't run past another enemy of the same type. Give other monsters wide berth when you're on your way back with your quarry. If necessary, stop and wait for your pull to catch up before proceeding.<br><br>

7. Also when pulling... ALWAYS tell your group "Incoming" as soon as you start your pull. And if you're pulling a tough guy, check with your casters and healers about mana. These seem like obvious things, but I've been in many groups where it doesn't always happen right.<br><br>

That's all I can think of for now. Feel free to add to this list, or to start new guides for other classes.<br><br>
