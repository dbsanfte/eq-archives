Update on the Hezlan trial.<br><br>

-- Qeynos --<br><br>

At 6 pm yesterday at the Qeynos courthouse, the expected verdict of "Not Guilty" was handed down on the Guard Hezlan murder trial. <br><br>

The assembled forces of Oboo and their supporters were informed of the result moments later by messenger. The reaction was instant and vicious. Bands of rioters, led by Cania, Snowmaj, Twowolves, and Lilu, stormed southward and engulfed the Qeynos gates in a fury of veangence.<br><br>

Hezlan and his (uncharged) companion Gehnus, were brought down by the raging mobs quickly, and cries of vindication were heard throughout the city. Other guards quickly fell to the invading forces until Corporal Lancot responded to the situation at the gate after being warned by several citizens. The mob dispersed quickly at the counterattack of the guards.<br><br>

But the bloodlust of the mob of Oboo was not completely satisfied. Several demonstration leaders infiltrated the city this time, and distracted Corporal Lancot and Lt. Dagnarok by engaging them in lengthy conversations about gnolls. Vyvyd, Strako and Tanaman performed this dangerous task to prevent these defenders from re-joining the fray. Meanwhile, the rioters returned to the gate and took their full veangence out on the remaining guards. <br><br>

The Bears of Oboo spokesman, Maccoloch, addressed reporters after the mob finished defacating on the Qeynos steps: <br><br>

"Today we sought out to ensure that justice would be done. The court system, run by the man, did not give us justice. So took it upon ourselves to bring [Hezlan] that foul murderer to justice." <br><br>

"We respect everyone's right to 'get upah', and 'get on down', but Hezlan and the thugs who supported him did neither. That just doesn't fly with the Oboo." <br><br>

Maccoloch added, "Whaaaaaaaassaaaaaaaap now, Hezlan?" <br><br>

The rest of the Oboo then stumbled back into Qeynos Hills, blindingly drunk but chanting happily.
