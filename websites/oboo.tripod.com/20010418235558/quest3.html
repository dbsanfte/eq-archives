<p class=subhead>The Stein of Moggok Quest</p>
<p>

This is a great item for any of our Erudite brothers and sisters who use INT as their mana stat (mages, enchanters, wizards). By the way, it apparently sells for 250 - 300 plat, and it is apparently doable for a level 8 or 12 enchanter.<br><br>

<b>Step One</B> - Bind in East Freeport docks.<br><br>

<b>Step Two</B> - Get a Teleport to Tox Forest<br><br>

<b>Step Three</B> - Go to Blue Hawk inn at Erudin and buy Innoruks Kiss of Death, a LORE drink.<br><br>

<b>Step Four</B> - Give Kiss of Death to Sinnkin Highbrow at top of Erudin library, she will give you Erud's Tonic. <br><br>

<b>Step Five</B> - Take the boat to Qeynos. <br><br>

<b>Step Six</B> - Kill the Koadli fish in the large pond near Temple of Life. This is the hardest part of quest. The fish is level 1, but very fast, and if you attack it near the swimming guard he will kill you. You also get BAD faction with qeynos. My suggestion is to pay a newbie rogue like 5 to 10 pp to kill it for you, while you are ungrouped. Loot the fish corpse, and take the item called Fish Corpse. <br><br>

<b>Step Seven</B> - Gate back to FP docks, then take the LONG three zone walk to Rivervale. A teleport isn't needed, but definitely get a SOW. <br><br>

<b>Step Eight</B> - At Rivervale, buy 2 honeycombs from newbies for like 5 gp each, or kill bixies in Misty Thicket to get them. Take 30 gold and 2 honeycombs to the halfling woman in the left building in the Tagglefoot Farms, not sure of name, starts with a K. She will give you a Honeyjum. <br><br>

<b>Step Nine</B> - Gate back to FP. Buy a kiola nut for like a pp, or buy one for 3 gp in the Ocean of Tears sister island. Then go to Seafarers Roost in FP, the building to the left of the docks. <br><br>

<b>Step Ten</B> - Give the Kiola Nut, Tonic, Honeyjum, and Fish Corpse to the merchant there, named starts with a G. He will give you a recipe book. <br><br>

<b>Step Eleven</B> - Get a teleport to Feerot, Cazic Thule, or South Ro. Feerot is best. Walk to Oggok from Feerot, then find Clurg in the place. Meet and Drink Tew Buy, it is near the Metil and Lether armor stores. Give Clurg the recipe book, and he gives you the Stein of Moggok. <br><br>

<b>Step Twelve</B> - Gate back to FP, and congratulate yourself on a job well done. You can only hold one stein, so start a newbie mule to hold the stein unless you can sell it, and do the quest again.<br><br>

Bear in mind you will have to use your illusions accordingly, and only 12th levels can get into Oggok, unless you are a dark elf. Invisibility for traveling is a MUST, so stay invis the whole time. Alliance all the NPCs who give quest items, or else they might not give it, Clurg sure wont give it to you unless you are a dark elf. Bear in mind the recipe book is No Drop, which means you CANT have a party all get books and give them to you, so you can only do the stein quest once at a time. SOW is almost as useful as Invis, and i HIGHLY recommend having a SOW at all times, even if you have to pay 1 pp for it. <br><br>
