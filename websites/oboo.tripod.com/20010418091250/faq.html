<p class=generalhead>Frequently Asked Questions</p>
<p>
<br>
Due to a great number of misconceptions regarding the Bears of Oboo, the Ministry has compiled a list of Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ). We hope that this FAQ will help resolve any uncertainty that exists with regards to the Bears of Oboo.
<br>
<br>
<table width=90% cellpadding=1 border=0>

<tr valign=top><td><p><b>Q.</B></td><td><p>Who are the Bears of Oboo?</td></tr>
<tr valign=top><td><p><b>A.</B></td><td><p>The Bears of Oboo are a group of militant Barbarians and Erudites who oppose the systematic destruction of the Barbarian and Erudite cultures at the hands of Humans and Elves.</td></tr>

<tr><td><br></td></tr>
<tr valign=top><td><p><b>Q.</B></td><td><p>Who is Oboo?</td></tr>
<tr valign=top><td><p><b>A.</B></td><td><p>Oboo is a symbolic representation of the pride of the Barbarian race, applicable to Erudites in that we are all brothers and sisters but have been oppressed due against our will. The Honorable Minister Oboo is not the same as the Bears of Oboo. That name is a coincidence; Oboo is a common Barbarian name, meaning "He who stands tall amidst scrawny gnoll trains."</td></tr>

<tr><td><br></td></tr>
<tr valign=top><td><p><b>Q.</B></td><td><p>How do you pronounce Oboo?</td></tr>
<tr valign=top><td><p><b>A.</B></td><td><p>It's pronounced Oh - boo.  Emphasis on the "Oh."</td></tr>

<tr><td><br></td></tr>
<tr valign=top><td><p><b>Q.</B></td><td><p>Are the Bears of Oboo a cult?</td></tr>
<tr valign=top><td><p><b>A.</B></td><td><p>No. See the question "Who is Oboo?" above.</td></tr>

<tr><td><br></td></tr>
<tr valign=top><td><p><b>Q.</B></td><td><p>Are the Bears of Oboo racist?</td></tr>
<tr valign=top><td><p><b>A.</B></td><td><p>No. The Bears of Oboo are not racist, nor do we seek the destruction of all Humankind or Elvenkind. We do realize, however, that in our modern political climate, peace between our races is a unrealistic goal, and therefore a goal that we choose not to pursue. What we want is freedom for our people, the guarantee of ownership of our lands for ourselves and for our children.</td></tr>

<tr><td><br></td></tr>
<tr valign=top><td><p><b>Q.</B></td><td><p>If you don't like Humans, why don't you just leave?</td></tr>
<tr valign=top><td><p><b>A.</B></td><td><p>We didn't land on Norrath. Norrath landed on us! We refuse to accept our current situation as "the way things are," nor do we see leaving our native lands as a viable solution to a system of political injustice that we did not create. We consider it to be an absurd insult to our races to suggest that we should leave the lands of our great-grandfathers.</td></tr>

<tr><td><br></td></tr>
<tr valign=top><td><p><b>Q.</B></td><td><p>What exactly do you want, anyway?</td></tr>
<tr valign=top><td><p><b>A.</B></td><td><p>We want the freedom to educate our children in line with our culture and heritage. We want freedom for our people. We want the release of all Barbarian and Erudites held prisoner under Human law.</td></tr>

<tr><td><br></td></tr>
<tr valign=top><td><p><b>Q.</B></td><td><p>I keep seeing another guild out there, the <a href=http://www.lepimp.com>Reach of Oboo</a>.  Who are they?</td></tr>
<tr valign=top><td><p><b>A.</B></td><td><p>The <a href=http://www.lepimp.com>Reach of Oboo</a> is the sister guild to the Bears of Oboo.  We share the common bond of oppression, and have cultivated very similar ideas as to the origin of funk.  In an effort to remain pure to our cause, we allow only Barbarians and Erudites into our guild.  The Reach, however, which admits the ever-funky Trolls, Orgres, and Dark Elves, are considered our brothers, sisters, and very dear friends.</td></tr>

<tr><td><br></td></tr>
<tr valign=top><td><p><b>Q.</B></td><td><p>Which is better: to get up or to get down?</td></tr>
<tr valign=top><td><p><b>A.</B></td><td><p>In the interest of freedom, both physical and philosophical, we believe that this question is one that can be answered only within each Bear's heart and funk. We do not believe that anyone has a right to force another to decide between getting up and getting down.</td></tr>

<tr><td><br></td></tr>
<tr valign=top><td><p><b>Q.</B></td><td><p>I'm an Erudite and I'm smarter than any human in Qeynos. Am I really oppressed by them? I don't think that I'm oppressed.</td></tr>
<tr valign=top><td><p><b>A.</B></td><td><p>You're definitely oppressed.  Look at where you are. Sure, the history books say you left Norrath to create your own city, but who wrote the history books? Who is teaching your children? Look around you! When it's not pouring cats and dogs, you can't see a damn thing in all that fog. Wouldn't you rather have a piece of the rock, with a little sun? Plus, you should hear what those humans in Qeynos say about you behind your back.  They call you "nerd" and "dweeb" and "that pompous ass in the stupid-looking nightgown".  Are you going to let them get away with that?</td></tr>

<tr><td><br></td></tr>
<tr valign=top><td><p><b>Q.</B></td><td><p>What is this business with Temple No. 1 and Temple No. 2?</td></tr>
<tr valign=top><td><p><b>A.</B></td><td><p>Temple No. 1 is centered in Halas, the birthplace of the original Honorable and Great Oboo, king of Bears. It is the temple to which all Barbarian Bears of Oboo belong. Temple No. 2 is centered in Erudin, the home of Erudites, who bring much strength and honor into our ranks.</td></tr>

<tr><td><br></td></tr>
<tr valign=top><td><p><b>Q.</B></td><td><p>What is the structure of the Bears of Oboo?</td></tr>
<tr valign=top><td><p><b>A.</B></td><td><p>For an explanation of titles and ranks of the Bears of Oboo, please go <a href="ranks.html">here</a>.</td></tr>

<tr><td><br></td></tr>
<tr valign=top><td><p><b>Q.</B></td><td><p>What is all this "cell" stuff about?</td></tr>
<tr valign=top><td><p><b>A.</B></td><td><p>A <a href=roster1.html>cell</a> is the smallest unit of organization in the Bears of Oboo.  A cell is composed of seven to nine guild members, each being headed by a Lieutenant.  Each cell is intended to help increase organization of the guild, as well as to help make each and every guild member feel like they belong, and that they have an officer's ear at all times.  As there is no ordering people around within the Bears of Oboo, the cell is not intended as a heirarchical structure as much as one for organizational purposes.</td></tr>

<tr><td><br></td></tr>
<tr valign=top><td><p><b>Q.</B></td><td><p>How do I join the Bears of Oboo?</td></tr>
<tr valign=top><td><p><b>A.</B></td><td><p>Contact one of our officers in-game or fill out a contact sheet <a href="submit.html">here</a>.</td></tr>
