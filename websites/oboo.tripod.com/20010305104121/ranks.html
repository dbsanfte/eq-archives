<p class=generalhead>Explanation of Guild Ranks</p>

<p>
This section enumerates and explains the various ranks of the Bears of Oboo. For rank information of specific members, go <a href=roster.html>here</a>.

<p class=subhead>The Ministry</p>

<p><b>The Minister of Understanding and Knowledge</B> is responsible for the dissemination of knowledge and dropping of knowledge throughout Norrath. The Minister of Understanding and Knowledge is the guild leader of the Bears of Oboo.<br><br>

In a capitalistic world, where money rules side by side by swords, one must be ready to battle the financial oppression laid about our knecks of humans and elves. <b>The Minister of Da Loot</B> is the Guild Treasurer. He is responsible for collection of dues and maintaining the books for the Bears of Oboo. He is also ultimately responsible for answering grant requests and allocating funds to the appropriate areas of need.<br><br>

<b>The Minister of FINE Arts</B> is in charge of booty action and the funkification of the Bears of Oboo. If any Bear of Oboo misplaces his funk, the Brother or Sister should first report this loss of funk to the Minister of FINE Arts.<br><br>

<b>The Chief Booty Consultant</B> consults with the Ministry in all matters relating to booty.  This position is to be held by a Bear of Oboo who is just, objective, and righteous.  The Chief Booty Consultant may also bill by the hour.<br><br>

<br><br>

<p class=subhead>Temple No. 1 and Temple No. 2</p>

<p>

<b>Brothers</B> and <b>Sisters</B> form the cornerstone of the Bears of Oboo. They are the moral foundation upon which the guild relies. All new members of the Bears of Oboo, once accepted into our ranks, become a Brother or Sister of their respective temple. Temple No. 1 is for Barbarians and Temple No. 2 is for Erudites. All other races belong in our Community Outreach program.<br><br>

<b>Lieutenants</B> are the leaders of men. They should know, tutor, and aid the men in their temples. The Lieutenant must be able to make decisions, listen patiently, and assess situations free of bias. The Lieutenant must gain the respect, cooperation, and loyalty of his or her men, and must not cling to any lax or careless habits.  Each Lieutenant is in charge of a cell, whose happiness and education the Lieutenant is ultimately responsible for.<br><br>

<b>Captains</B> must intelligently anticipate all plans of work given to him by his superiors. He should show initiative and good judgement in the eyes of his men and superiors. There can be no more than three captains in a Temple at any given time.<br><br>

<b>The Messenger of Oboo</B> is the Living Word (logos) of Oboo the Messiah. The Messenger of Oboo is the ultimate theological authority within the Bears of Oboo. All questions regarding the nature of funk should be referred to the Messenger of Oboo.<br><br>

Each temple has as its leader a <b>Minister.</B> It is a Minister's responsibility to carry out the will of the Messenger of Oboo and the rest of the Ministry. He or she must mobilize and organize the members of his Temple, and should know each member of his temple. Each Minister will also take place in the decision-making process of the Ministry, though their home is in their temple.<br><br><br>
