The Githyanki

Githyanki is WNW of Medievia, immediately north of the cresent moon shaped
lake. It is near-ish to the Combs (Obsidian spire).

Good for lev15+ groups or lev25ish solo'ing. Some decent eq can be found.
Especially on Shool and Lord Gith (and possibly Warlock, but I'm always
blind after fighting him, so I've yet to pilfer his stinking corpse).

Careful of praying at "Bloody Altar" (near entrance), as mobs can and will
be there and kill you as soon as you rez (use altar in wilderness to SSE)

1 - "Before Temple of Gith" (entrance to Githyanki)
2 - Search (trapdoor)
3 - Training grounds
4 - Capt. of the Guard
5 - Search for exit
6 - Search for exit
7 - Ruby Dragon (Shool) not too tough
8 - Lord Gith (decent eq at times, nice xp)
9 - Executioner
10 - Magic Portal, enter and go up up.. kill princess for key. Have fun
     getting back (tricky portal)
11 - Gith Warlock (eq I dunno, I'm always blind after fight).
