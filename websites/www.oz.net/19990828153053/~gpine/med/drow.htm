Drow (Thalos)

Recommended lev: 10+ in a _good_ group (avoid yochlol/spiders), 20+ solo'ing
houses/mothers, 25+ Yochlol or spiders (solo).

Mobs of interest:
Spiders - in the pit. Great xp (1-5million) No eq. Very hard to kill all 10 of them.
NOTE: Spider pit is now a dt (death trap). You can't cast in it, and it's a Fire room.
Yochlol - Casts a lot, good xp (200-500k), lame eq, but sometimes pop's regen rings.
Houses and Mothers - Sometimes drows and mothers pop silver regen rings.
Masters - 100k xp or more, fairly easy
Weaponmasters - 200k xp or more, not too hard either
Termites - 70-80k bothersome mob
Commoner - 30-40k bothersome mob

Screw mapping Thalos, it's so messed up with exit-links I won't map it. Here's drow.

@ - the Western entrance to Thalos
1,2,3,4 - Houses
m - Mother Matron (throne rooms)
M - Master(s) pop here
W - Weaponmaster(s) pop here
t - to Thalos
A - Altar (pray-able)
Y - Yochlol
P - Pit (spiders)
