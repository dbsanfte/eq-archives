    OmaSpy is a CPK-watcher. One would use it when sitting around keeping an eye
    out for norty cpkers. One person runs it, others just connect to that person
    via chat. Simply <b>/chat [ChatNameOfPersonRunningIt] help</b> for info.<br>
    It's fairly self explainitory.<br><br>

    [<a href="OmaSpy.htm">xx</a>]&lt;--Click for more info/screenshots.<br>

    <b>Fixes/Changes:</b><br>
    Added: Alias "osw" to manually run "where/survey". Don't just do "where", use this alias as it does some needed routines for the instant-update spew.<br>
    Added: Lists; OmaSpyWhere and OmaSpyWhereLast (have to do with instant-update spew)<br>
    Changed: OmaSpyIt event for routines for instant-update spew when people leave/return to "where".<br>
    Changed: The 3 actions that control capturing info. They turn off/on as needed, as well as added routines for instant-update.<br>
    **The above changes were mostly made so that via instant-update spew you see when people leave or return to "where".<br>
    Added: Flag "MIA" to the main display, Missing In Action. These are the most probable threats. MIA is shown in red (dragon flags in grey, others in blue).<br>
    Note: People that flew off on a dragon will soon after be flagged as "MIA", if the dragon time is the lowest time that means they simply flew off and haven't been seen since, hence they aren't a threat. You can discard them if you want manually via the "osRem [name]" alias or "os Rem [name]" chat command.

    This'll help clean up the very messy "who" list spew on <i>Realms of Despair</i>.<br><br>

    Pretty basic script (working off a terrible mess from the mud). Calls are:<br>
    "whox &lt;normal perameters used for who calls&gt;"<br>
    eg: "whox all" or "who 5 20" or "who cleric"<br>

    Here's two screen shots of the before spew, and the after spew.<br>
    [<a href="images/rod-who1.gif">xx</a>]<-Click ..Before<br>
    [<a href="images/rod-who2.gif">xx</a>]<-Click ..After<br>
    Note, the after shot is a different who listing, did a "whox deadly".<br><br>

    <b>Re-Written</b><br>
    I totally re-wrote the script, goodgoddamn those titles in the display f'n BLOW. Those imms
    need to get coding and filter that crap out. It's a freaking WHO list. Some people have TWO f'n
    FULL lines of spew. I just want to know WHO's on, levels, important flags. Fuck the titles, I can see
    that crap with my eyes while walking around town. TWO FREAKING LINES. Does some friggin d00dz mentality
    drive them to display this crap, or what?. Mud still rocks, but my god that is some crap ass fucking code.<br>
    Was still a major pain to script been on it for 7 hours :p, and it errors out because of all the f'n spew
    it has to filter.
    I suggest setting your pager to 10-12, or doing small who calls. "whox 50 50" will definitely get
    some errors as MM tries to parse all this shit if you don't set up the pager. I'm on a 1.2Ghz/512mb ram,
    DSL box and I couldn't make it reliably parse, unless I used pager of 12. Still, for short who listings
    it does pretty good.<br><br>

    Again, this script is for Realms of Despair .. although probably would work on other muds using the same
    crap ass coded who functions. :p If I can script a cleaner who list goodgod I'd hope someone can code one!

    New ShowArray script. Was too lazy to just update the one below so here's a new
    one from scratch. Pretty similar but a little smarter. Wanted it with more control
    when defining what you wanted to see, but it was a pain in the arse.. anyway....<br><br>

    For single dimension arrays the call is:<br>
    showarray <i>ArrayName nRows</i><br>
    Where <i>ArrayName</i> is the name or number of the array, and
    <i>Rows</i> is the range of rows to show (minimum is row 1). You can restrict it to a
    specific row by using a negative number: showarray <i>ArrayName -nRow</i> eg: 
    "showarray MyArray -4" would only show Row 4's info.<br><br>

    For 2 dimensional arrays (rows and columns) the call is:<br>
    showarray <i>ArrayName nRow nCol</i><br>
    Like above just supply a value to the <i>nRow</i> and <i>nCol</i> perameters. eg:
    "showarray MyArray 3 5" would list out columns 1-5 of rows 1-3.<br><br>

    To specify a particular range in a 2 dimensional array use sarange:<br>
    sarange <i>ArrayName nRow xRow nCol xCol</i><br>
    Where nRow/nCol is the minimum range, and xRow/xCol is the maximum range. eg:
    "sarange MyArray 3 6 2 5" would show columns 2-5 in rows 3-6.<br>
    You can also specify a single cell by using pairs of values for rows and columns:<br>
    "sarange MyArray 3 3 7 7" would show row 3, col 7.

    Here's a database thinger I was working on, but a new MMOG game is out
    and I doubt I'll finish this anytime soon. It will store most all information
    on stuff when you ID it. You can then create sorted lists (potentially up to about
    2200 different ways to sort I think). This is UNFINISHED, but it does work pretty much
    as far as storing info and doing the sorting. Just no displaying functions.<br>
    There is a file, OIDDinfo.txt ("Build Notes" link) that has some little notes I kept while building this
    script. It's handy mainly because it lists out what array row/col the info is store at.
    As well it shows what sort # the field is. Script is fairly massive and confusing...<br><br>

    This is my oldest "big" scripts. I made this hmm in 1996 I think, and it was the
    precursor to my creation of Hero Hunt. Keep in mind, this is rather old and and written
    before MM had many of the commands and procs it has now. I did an "update" on it a while
    back (1998), just to add in color procs (before it used ansi color variables). It's a bit
    confusing but should work fine once you figure it out.<br><br>

    This script is run on a server, that is a second MM session (use a new port for chat if
    you already have MM running. To start a new chat port, start MM with the "L" perameter:
    mudmast l:[port], ie: mudmast l:3210 -- would start MM and use port 3210 for chat. Anyone
    that plays will connect to the stud poker server.<br><br>

    Auto-Magic is a menu selection for setting up spells that formation members can get

    spells use the 2 CAP letters, ie: "]BW" = breath water.  It's very simple to use.

    Track tick times and when spells will start fading. If you're not using my mmnewbie
    script, you'll might have to edit the baritems to fit your needs. Note: Tick timers
    might be illegal on some muds (it's questionable on Medievia). Calls are simple:
    "<FONT COLOR=#ff0000>tickon</FONT>" and "<FONT COLOR=#ff0000>tickoff</FONT>", and you
    need to "score affect" on occasion to keep the spell timer updated. If you run a startup
    alias/event/macro.. I'd suggest turning this off by default. This works primarily off
    changes in your mana, so the more often you spend 5mana on "c invis me" the more accurate
    it will be. It's set to 33 second ticks by default, but you might find adjusting the event
    time a little one way or the other helps out. It runs a 1 second event -- this may slow
    down MM a little. If so, you might set it to 3 seconds (at 33 second ticks) or 2 seconds
    (at 32 second ticks), etc..ADDED: Forgot to include the tickon and tickoff aliases.

    <font color=#ff0000>SEE WELL BELOW FOR THE DLL VERSION</font>, This one is purely a script version and

    logs most communication channels and is very handy to have. Originally written
    by Arithon, this is my hacked up version :). Stores Say(+whisper/talk/ask), Tell,
    Clan, Gossip, Shout, Chat and more. User defineable "buffer" (store last xx
    communications). Newest addition is I added in a "grep" routine. You can search
    the lists for a specific text and either just /showme it cgrep %0, or chat spam
    it ccgrep %0. Do: "<FONT COLOR=#ff0000>chloghelp</FONT>" for info -- the grep'r
    isn't in the help, to use it the call is basically "cgrep [List name] [string to
    search for]" .. ie: "cgrep Say Joe" .. will show you any logged Say, that has "Joe"
    in it. It is case sensitive so you need to get the list names correct "spamchat"
    will list out list names. FIXED: ccgrep alias (Again), if you have it already, do
    /unal {ccgrep %0} and /unal {cgrep %0}, then load in this script. ADDED: can search
    for multiple word strings The AmPm Times Stamp script is REQUIRED, so get it too.(see above)

This is NOT a "backstab notifier" (aka chat spammer). This stores information about your backstabs and covers every aspect that I'm aware of about how you're doing backstab-wise. "<FONT COLOR=#ff0000>bshelp</FONT>" for info. Latest update added in averaging your hr/dr/ac when you do a bs. Note: it comes preloaded with info, if you reset it, the display will be ugly until you have landed (or wiffed) a single, double, AND triple bs. Oh also in this is "emotebs" which is pretty stupid, and a rather spammy "spambs" (a 'detailed' say). This script auto-saves itself as "bslog.txt" after every 5th bs attempt, it's a little spammy but I can't help that. Whenever you start up MM, /read bslog.txt - so that this file loads the latest bs info. <FONT COLOR=#ff0000>REQUIRES the "Math.dll" file (see below)</FONT>
