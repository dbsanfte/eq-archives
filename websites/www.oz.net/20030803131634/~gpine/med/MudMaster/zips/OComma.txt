/showme {OComma will STRIP or ADD commas to a given string. Just call it with "OComma #", if the given number has commas they will be stripped. If the given number doesn't have commas then commas will be added. All output is in the var "OComma".@Chr(10)OComma 1234 ..would output "1,234".@Chr(10)OComma 1,234 ..would output "1234".@Chr(10)@Chr(10)Because MM Considers that "1,234" is NOT a number, I've avoided adding any checks to insure the supplied value is actually a number or not. So, because of that, it's possible to add/strip commas from alpha strings. OComma 7abcd2 = "7ab,cd2".}
