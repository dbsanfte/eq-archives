/alias {SPAM} {/showme {@AnsiBold()@ForeYellow()@Chr(10)Welcome to Mud-Master, this is a very basic setup to help you get going on medievia.@Chr(10)@Chr(10)@ForeWhite()You can type in "mmhelp" for basic help. Some things you will want to do or know about are:@Chr(10)@AnsiReset()1. Mud Master is CaSe SeNsItIvE, all commands must be entered correctly according to the case. Example, doing \@ansibold() would never work, because it's actually \@AnsiBold()@Chr(10)@AnsiBold()2. Mud Master uses a "command character" The default is the / (forward slash key). example: /alias {sh} {say hi}. The command character lets MM know that what follows is a command, not text to send to the mud.@Chr(10)@AnsiReset()3. Mud Master's scripting language (commands) are very powerful and can be @ForeYellow()very@ForeWhite() confusing at first. Don't get frustrated, there are many other players happy to help out with learning MM.@Chr(10)@AnsiBold()4. While MM runs fastest in a Full Screen dos session, many people find running MM in a window'd dos session works fine, and looks a bit nicer (sharper). Alt-Enter will swap you from Full Screen to a Window (and vs.vs.) the /mode 50 (or /mode 25) command can allow you to fit a lot more info into the window, and changing the window's properties' font size when @ForeYellow()windowed@ForeWhite() can help to fit more text to your screen.@Chr(10)@AnsiReset()5.
