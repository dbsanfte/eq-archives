I've started on something I've wanted to have for quite a long time. Course now I don't script much, but still wouldn't mind having this around.<br><br>

MM Edit -- a way to write scripts with some visual ques for particular parts of the script.<br><br>

Here's a couple screenshots of how it looks (or might end up looking anyway). As I typed in the script, MM Edit colors particular strings "on the fly". The image below shows some colorized scripting, formatted for use with <a href="mmsc.htm">MMSC</a>, which can be used to "compile" the file into a usable script file.<br><br>

And a little color picker allowing selection of key colors:<br>

<u><b>Beta Release</b></u><br>
If you'd like to fiddle around with MM Edit then feel free to do so.
It is in "Beta", and is yet unfinished. To install just unzip it and
put it in some directory somewhere and run it.<br><br>

If you want to save a colorized file, save it as an RTF file. If you
want to use it as a script file, save it as plain text (removes all
rtf info). Loading a previously created script works, but it won't
colorize it (yet).<br><br>

<b>Latest "version": v1.0.8 - 4Feb03</b><br>
<a href="zips/mmEditBETA.zip">Download the Beta</a> ~64k<br><br>

Missing the <a href="zips/OCX_Files.zip">OCX File(s)</a>? Get um here. Just toss them into your Windows/System (or /system32) dir.<br><br>

I removed the Mini Calculator from the app and made it a seperate application. If you'd like it, you can get it here:<br>
