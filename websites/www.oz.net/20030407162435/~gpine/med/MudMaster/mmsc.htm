<b><u>MMSC - Mud Master Script Compiler</u></b><br><br>

MMSC allows you to write scripts more like code. You can break down each command, and add notes.<br><br>

MMSC is "Beta", meaning it is NOT finished and is quite possibly buggy. I could use feedback on it, likes, dislikes, bugs, questions, etc. If you use it please comment so I know how it's working.<br><br>

<u>Included in the zip file is a sample script. The sample contains a lot of examples and comments, please refer to it for additional help. The sample is can be compiled just how it is, but I suggest you turn off the "Add Notes" option in MMSC.</u><br><br>

<b>Basic usage:</b><br>
Installing: Put it whereever you'd like and just run it. Under the File menu choose "Open..." and open up a script file. The script file you open must be written FOR MMSC to compile. Compiling already created MM scripts won't do much other than create a 0 byte file.<br><br>

After opening the source file, hit the "compile" button and MMSC will create a new file, in the dir where the source file was. The name of the output (MM ready) script is the same as the source file's name, but with ".MMSC" tagged on the end of it.<br><br>

<b>Commands in breif:</b><br>
<u>Adding notes:</u><br>
<font face=Terminal>
/~ <i>note spew</i><font face=Arial><br>
example:<font face=Terminal><br>
/~ This is a note<br>
/~ Below is a note inside a command<br>
/action {%0 says, 'hi'.}<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;/~ doing stuff below to get name of character<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;{<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;/var Name $0<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;}<br>
/*<font face=Arial><br><br>

<u>Ending a command statement</u><br>
After you've finished with your command you need to let MMSC know, you do that by putting a "/*" on a blank line after the command. Example:<font face=Terminal><br><br>

/Alias {xxy}<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;{<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;say Ooooh phat loot!<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;} {stupidaliases}<br>
/*<font face=Arial><br><br>

MMSC will reconstruct the lines, from "/Alias" up to, but excluding, the "/*". The above becomes: /alias {xxy}{say Ooooh phat loot!} {stupidaliases}<br><br>

You can add comments after the "/*".<font face=Terminal><br>
/var {MyVar} {100000}<br>
/* MyVar is really important, don't forget to /empty it when you burp.<font face=Arial><br><br>

Careful commenting with /*, /*'s MAIN purpose is as a flag for MMSC to know when to stop building a command string and print it to file. /*'s will add linefeeds to your output file, which is fine, just messy.<br><br>

<u>Streaming Lots of little things</u><br>
You can "Stream" commands. Handy for when you have lots of little commands to add to MM. Good example is variables, typically having tons. Using /& tells MMSC that all lines following are indivigual commands and each line should just be added to the output file -- Until a /* is encountered, then stop the process. You can toss notes/whitespace in between commands, but <b>each command must be one continuous line</b>. MMSC won't construct commands when it's streaming. You can add a comment after the /& as well, Example:<font face=Terminal><br><br>

/& I'm streaming a bunch of little things...<br>
/var {MyVar1} {1}<br>
/var {MyVar2} {2}<br><br>

/~ Next var is used by my uberduber script<br>
/var {UberDuber} {0}<br>
/~ Reading in my great script here...<br>
/read MySillyScript.txt<br>
/var {MyVar3} {3}<br>
/var {MyVar4} {4}<br>
/* (end of streaming here)<font face=Arial><br><br>

Why stream? Because if you don't then you need to add /* after every single command, and that includes vars. So Streaming is handy for lots of short commands that you don't need/want to break down into "code" style.<br><br>

MMSC strips all whitespace from in front of any line. So you can indent to your heart's content. You will want to possibly add trailing spaces though to make the compiled script look nice...<font face=Terminal><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;/~ Hey look a spaced out comment<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;/macro {F1}<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;{<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;shout AHHhhahhhhaha<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;} {stupidmacros}<br>
/*<font face=Arial><br><br>

Whitespace inside a command should be fine:<font face=Terminal><br>
/alias {MyAlias}<br><br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;{<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;/var Smart @Math(1+1)<br><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;}<br>
