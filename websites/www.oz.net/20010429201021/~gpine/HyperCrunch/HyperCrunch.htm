It will compress html files, removing unnecessary whitespace, and eventually optionally replacing unneeded and long tags with shorter varients that give the same affect. <br><br>HyperCrunch is in BETA, so don't expect perfect functionality, although it's working fairly well now (this page is most likely crunched, assuming the current version I'm working on works well enough anyway). <br><br>The purpose of HTML compression is three-fold. <br><br><u>Primarily to lower bandwidth useage</u><br>For example, a page I recently tested off a commercial game's web site, would save that site around 466 Megabytes of traffic per 100,000 page loads. That's just <b>one</b> page on the site. Multiply that by other pages and the heavy traffic and you'll note that there is a very high bandwidth savings rate given from simply compressing the html. <br><br><u>Decreased page load time</u><br>Contiguous html <i>will</i> load faster. Although "faster" is pretty relative to one's conception of "fast" as far as html load times go. Nonetheless, load times will be reduced. <br><br><u>HTML source code pilfering</u><br>The highly compressed HTML is much harder to read and understand. So your HTML is better protected against those that would steal your page's unique design layout. <br><br><b><big><u>Simple to use</big></b></u><br>HyperCrunch is simple to use. Everything is up front and visible. No digging around for options they're right in plain sight. (well if it gets too out of hand I'll move um to a seperate menu/form). <br><br>As it stands now (current version) Scripts (javascript and VBScript) will remain just as you created them. APPLETS and other tags are also preformatted to maintain integrety (until I can fully implement safe crunching on them, if and where possible.. <br><br>No help file, but it's pretty straight forward to use. Options have tooltips, so just pause the mouse over the text to view the tip. No registry setup, no install. Put HyperCrunch.exe wherever you want, locate your html file and crunch away. <b>Warning:</b> HyperCrunch is for "crunching" TEXT files, not binary files. So if you choose to crunch a binary or other non-text/HTML file then you have utilized HyperCrunch for something it is not intended for :p. <br><br><b>Screen Shot</b><br></td></tr><tr><td align=center><img src=hyp.gif><br><img src=done.gif><br></td></tr><tr><td><font face=verdana size=2><b><u>Version History:</b></u><br><br> <b>1.3.0b - Nov. 13th, 2000</b><br> - Added new Results form.<br> - Some minor fiddling around. <br><br><b>1.2.8b - Nov 11th, 2000</b><br> - Added more tags for replacement<br> - Added a bunch of tags for preformatting<br> - Restructured the parsing a bit more.<br> - More option checkboxes. I like them all up front and visible, but it might be a bit crowded. <br><br><b>1.2.6b - Nov 10th, 2000</b><br>err forgot to put in a new version number, anyway here's today's changes... <br>- Added more tags for replacement <br>- Added stripping comments option <br>- Redid some of the parsing routines, plus added a bundle more (for the new tags, etc) <br>- Added tooltips to the options for basic help about each one. <br>- 3 pages of to-do, down to 1 page.. UI and improved results output still in my brain but not in the app :p <br><br><b>1.2.6b - Nov 9th, 2000</b><br>- Added more tags for replacing, &ltSTRIKE&gt, &ltEM&gt, and &ltBLOCKQUOTE&gt <br>- Made each tag replacement option its own toggle. <br>- Fixed a couple minor things, plus made most controls tab-indexed for keyboard access. <br><br><b>1.2.4b - Nov 8th, 2000</b><br>- Got tired of trying to outsmart how browsers adds a space to carriage returned text. So a few extra spaces will show up where I'd rather remove them. <br>- Added an option to replace &ltSTRONG&gt tags with &ltB&gt <br><br><b>1.2.3b - Nov 6th, 2000</b><br>- Added Quotation Mark stripping (check box option). This won't affect preformatted tags, nor the &lt!DOCTYPE tag. <br>- Fixed some useless spaces that weren't being removed <br>- Fiddled with ideas for the UI, as it's pretty darn ugly as it is now. Also multiple file crunching, etc... But no real UI changes in yet. <br><br><b>1.2.2b - Nov 4th, 2000</b><br>- Once again a thorough restructuring of the parsing routines. Now it should be much easier for me to make additions to the parser. <br>- Pretty sure I have the parsing down, got rid of a lot of the little things, such as the problems with table cells. <br>- Added &ltSCRIPT&gt tag for preformating (no crunching). So now, &lt!--, &ltPRE&gt and &ltSCRIPT...&gt tags won't get crunched. <br><br><b>1.2.1b</b><br>- Added a progress bar, and some small internal changes. <br>- There's some known issues with tags messing up that are within table cells. <br><br><b>1.2.0b</b><br>Total restructure of the parsing routines. <br><br><b>1.0.0-1.0.xb</b><br>Lots of fuddling around. <br><br><b><u>Download HyperCrunch</u></b><br>HyperCrunch (BETA) is free for the taking. Again, it's BETA so expect potential errors. <u>HyperCrunch will <b>not</b> destroy, alter, or delete</u> the source file (original html file). And will output a new file in the same directory as the source file with the source file's exact name <i>plus</i> a second extension of ".HyP". <br>Example: You crunch c:\test\MyHTML.html. HyperCrunch will write a new file c:\test\MyHTML.html.HyP. <br><br><u>Only download HyperCrunch if you can understand and agree with these simple statements, restrictions and/or agreements:</u><br>1. HyperCrunch is BETA, which means it is <i>not</i> a finished product, nor free from errors. Using HyperCrunch.exe might result in the loss of data or other unforseen problems. By using HyperCrunch you hold harmless J. Gordon Pine from any damages that might occur from said use of HyperCrunch. <br>2. HyperCrunch comes with no expressed or implied warantees. Use HyperCrunch at your own risk <br><br>Download <a href=hypercrunch.zip>HyperCrunch v1.3.0b</a> ~28k <br><br>Please <a href=mailto:gpine@oz.net>email</a> suggestions, comments, bugs, thanks, <br>Gordy <br><br>p.s.
