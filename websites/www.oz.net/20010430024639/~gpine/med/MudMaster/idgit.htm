    Okie I'll assume you, not unlike me, are an idiot. So this guide is for you!<br><br>

    First, keep in mind there are two Mud Masters now, Aaron's original Console
    version, and Kevin's Mud Master 2000 (which is basically MM converted to a GUI). This
    install guide is for the console (DOS-session) version.<br><br>

    <strong>Download it</strong><br>
    Go get the <a href="http://www.mud-master.com/">files<a> off www.mud-master.com. Click
    the "Download" button and download the final release version, 2.6.1. Save that zip file
    to a temporary directory (folder) somewhere.<br><br>

    <strong>Make a home for it</strong><br>
    Make a directory where you want mud master to be. You can put it anywhere you'd like on
    your harddrive(s).<br><br>

    <strong>Put the files into the dir</strong><br>
    Unzip the downloaded file you got into the new folder you made for mud master.<br><br>

    <strong>Make a shortcut (batch file) for it</strong><br>
    Remember the full path name to the directory where mud master is, for example:<br>
    c:\games\internet\mudmaster<br><br>

    Open up Notepad, and type in the following, excluding the "------":<br>
    ---------<br>
    @echo off<br>
    DRIVE:<br>
    cd\PATH<br>
    mudmast<br>
    DEADSPACE<br>
    ---------<br>
    For the DRIVE, put the drive letter where mm is and a colon, ie: C:<br>
    For the PATH, put the full path, excluding the drive, ie: cd\games\internet\mudmaster<br>
    DEADSPACE -- Leave a linefeed (not a spacebar space) at the bottom of the file.

    Now, save that in your Windows directory, as "mudmaster.bat"<br><br>

    <strong>Make an icon on your desktop</strong><br>
    Now, right-click your desktop and select New->Shortcut->Browse .. and find the
    mudmaster.bat file that you just created in your Windows dir. To help speed up the search,
    in the browser window for the filename just type in "mudmaster.bat" -- be IN the windows
    directory.<br>
    Click Next, and give it a name, like "MudMaster" or "MyMudName" or whatever.<br>
    Click Next and pick an icon you'd like for it, then click Finish.<br><br>

    You'll now have an icon on your desktop you can use to start mudmaster, and MM will run
    fast off the bat file shortcut, but if you had just created a shortcut to mudmast.exe it would
    run slow.<br><br>

    <strong>Further tidbits</strong><br>
    keep the /sesson command in mind, this is how you connect to a mud:
    "/sess med medievia.com 4000" would connect ya to med.<br>
    You need a word after /sess and before the actual domain name+port,
    doesn't matter what the word it, this is an old emulation of tintin so
    grin and bear it.<br><br>

    If you want to organize your paths a little, make a few sub-directories off your main mudmaster
    dir.<br>
    Make a "scripts", "sounds", "upload", and "download" dir.<br>
    In MM do: "/scriptpath scripts", "/soundpath sounds", "/uploadpath upload", and "/downloadpath download".<br>
    Now all scripts you create will be written to the scripts dir. Any files you want to upload via MM's chat
    feature you put in the upload dir, versely any files you download from friends via chat will be in the
    download dir. If you use sounds, or use MSP sounds they will go into the sounds dir.<br><br>

    Set up a chat name, initially you have none -- /chatname OmaIsKing -- you can choose another name
    if you so desire, although that one is pretty damn nice.<br><br>

    /help -- use this command, a lot :p The final release version has help for all commands and procs, as
    well as the user guides and other info.<br><br>

    /default [filename.ext] -- use this to cause MM to open this file when MM is first started, this is your
    default script file. Naturally you might not have one, yet.<br><br>

    Scripts are best edited "offline", that is via Notepad or Wordpad (plain text), or other plain text editor.
    Check out "/help read", and "/help write".<br><br>

    I prefer running MM in a window, instead of full screen dos session. Simply hit Alt-Enter to swap from
    full to window, and vs. vs. If you use a window, click the window's little icon in the upper left corner,
    and hit Properties. Adjust the font as you'd like it, and under Misc make sure Fast Pasting is OFF. You might
    select the Idle Sensitivity slider to LOW., Quick Edit mouse OFF, Exclusive Mode OFF. Most important is
    the Fast Pasting, again OFF. If it's on and you paste, you'll lock up MM, and have to ctrl-alt-del it.<br><br>

    If you become confused, ask Aaron he's happy to help with stupid questions... yes happy happy...
