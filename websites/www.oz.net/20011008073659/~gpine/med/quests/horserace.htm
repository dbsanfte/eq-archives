<P>Horse Racing Quest...</P>

<P>This is new, so thinks are bound to change.</P>

<P>Basic idea is the players start in Tar Valon, using the unique &quot;gleaming
white stallion&quot; that is there. Once started (you're placed at the
stable in Tar) you race to the destination (random place somewhere in med).
There is an enrollment fee, 50,000 - and you can bet on enrolled players
(both enrolled and non-enrolled people may bet). So for players there's
3 potential pay offs, the winning pot (taken from the enroll fees) and
bets you've placed, and if you're racing, a small pay off from any bets
placed on you.</P>

<P>There are a number of commands:</P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00">help </FONT><FONT COLOR="#FFFFFF">- the always
present help spam<BR>
</FONT><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00">help betting </FONT><FONT COLOR="#FFFFFF">-
help spam on placing bets<BR>
</FONT><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00">enroll me</FONT><FONT COLOR="#FFFFFF"> - Before
you can enroll, you must Bank Transfer me 50k. I will MATCH all enrollment
fees so the pot grows.<BR>
</FONT><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00">mount up </FONT><FONT COLOR="#FFFFFF">- Places
you in a holding room (which exits to stables on startup) IFyou wish to
bet on yourself or other players, then don't &quot;mount up&quot; until
after you're all done betting (you have to give me money to bet)<BR>
</FONT><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00">dest </FONT><FONT COLOR="#FFFFFF">- show the
destination (where I'll be) and the current enrollment pot<BR>
</FONT><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00">who &lt;String&gt; </FONT><FONT COLOR="#FFFFFF">-
Find a player(s) enrolled in the quest via a specific string to search
for. You want to bet, but on who? Instead of me spamming 20+ names on quest
or telepaths, you can tell me &quot;who &lt;some string&gt;&quot; to search
for. The Search is CaSe SeNsItIvE Examples:<BR>
who J - would list anyone with a name starting with &quot;J&quot;<BR>
who gar - would list anyone with &quot;gar&quot; in their name<BR>
</FONT><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00">check &lt;Name&gt; </FONT><FONT COLOR="#FFFFFF">-
Check name is useful to see how many people have bet on a player. &quot;&lt;Name&gt;&quot;
must match exactly the mud name of the player. Note: the more bets on a
player, the better your pay out, if the player wins in the top 10.<BR>
</FONT><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00">my pot </FONT><FONT COLOR="#FFFFFF">- Used
by enrolled players, see how many players have bet on you, and your cut
of those bets (1/5th) This is what you will win, regardless of what position
you finish in. Simply just finish and win this amount.<BR>
</FONT><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00">bet &lt;Name&gt; </FONT><FONT COLOR="#FFFFFF">-
To Bet on someone, you must FIRST give me coins &quot;give xx coins Omawarisan&quot;.
Bets are anything from 5k-100k. After you have given me the bet, tell me
&quot;bet &lt;Name&gt;&quot; to bet on a player.<BR>
</FONT><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00">return bet </FONT><FONT COLOR="#FFFFFF">-
If you gave me coins for a bet, but have not yet selected a player and
wish to re-adjust or cancel it use this command.</FONT><BR>
</P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFFFF">IF YOU&nbsp;DIE, when you CORPSE just tell me
</FONT><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00">dead horse </FONT><FONT COLOR="#FFFFFF">I'll
reanimate you and give you a mount. You must be a Corpse and enrolled in
the quest.</FONT></P>

<P><BR>
<FONT COLOR="#FFFFFF">PAYOFFS:<BR>
</FONT><FONT COLOR="#00FF00">For Racers</FONT><FONT COLOR="#FFFFFF"> I'll
pay the top 10 finishers a sum of the total enrollment pot, naturally the
better positions earn more.<BR>
</FONT><FONT COLOR="#00FF00">For&nbsp;Racers:</FONT><FONT COLOR="#FFFFFF">
If people bet on you, you get 1/5th of the bets, as long as you finish,
regardless of your finishing position. You can even bet on yourself&nbsp;:p<BR>
</FONT><FONT COLOR="#00FF00">For&nbsp;Betters:</FONT><FONT COLOR="#FFFFFF">
I will pay betters who bet on any of the top 10 finishers. The more bets
on a player, the better your payoff. Your bet is a formula based off the
total bets placed on a rider, the riders position in winning, and your
bet amount. Naturally the more you bet, the more you might win.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFFFF">BETTING:<BR>
You can bet ONCE for any or all players enrolled in the game.&nbsp;Anyone
can place bets, racer or not! (If you are a racer you can bet on yourself
and any other competitors). Bets are 5k-100k .. any value in that range.
The more you bet, the more you might win back. Basically 1/5th of your
bet is given to the rider..(as long as the rider finishes). 4/5ths of your
bet is used in the math formula for bet payoffs. Your total bet amount
is also used in the bet payoff formula. You MUST&nbsp;be online to win.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFFFF">Riders be warned, if you haven't &quot;mount up&quot;'d
and the race starts, you cannot race! You &quot;miss the gate call&quot;.
If you dilly dally around trying to place bets and miss the final call
.. you're out (you can still win bets you placed though). I will quest
out warnings before &quot;opening the gates&quot;..</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFFFF">Races will always start in Tar Valon, but can
end anywhere in med that a horse might travel.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFFFF">Note: there are 2 horse types in Tar&nbsp;Valon,
Unicorns and Stallions.. You must use the STALLION. Arriving at the destination
mounted on anything other will prove fruitless. You MUST&nbsp;&quot;mount
up&quot; to race. No sneaking around with stallions beforehand.</FONT></P>
