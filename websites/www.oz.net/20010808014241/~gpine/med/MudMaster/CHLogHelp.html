<u><b>Channels Logged ("god" channels in italics):</b></u><br>
<b>te</b>ll <b>sa</b>y <b>fo</b>rm <b>cl</b>an <b>sh</b>out <b>go</b>ssip <b>im</b>mort <i><b>32 33 34 35 pr</b>ay</i> <b>to</b>wn <b>dr</b>eam <i><b>de</b>ath <b>mi</b>scinfo</i> <b>gi</b>ve <b>qu</b>est <b>ch</b>at <i><b>av</b>atar</i> misc1 misc2 misc3 misc4 misc5

<b>How to call the basic channel log:</b>
The key is the first 2 letters of each channel log (listed above). Each list is denoted by the first two letters of the list's name. (eg: say list = "sa"). You combine the first 2 letters with "list" so for the say channel log, to view its entire contents you do: <b>salist</b>
<br>
The exceptions are the god channels 32-35. The call is list+# eg:<b>list33</b>
<hr>
You'll note that each channel has it's own index number<br>
<pre>
0134 [02:49am][I Chatted] load the script up on wordpad and do a search/replace</pre>
"0134" is the unique index number. Each channel will maintain a continuous range, but they don't all start at 0001.<br><br>
So keep that in mind, because trying to spam out the first 10 says doesn't mean they are listed by index 0001-0010.
<hr>
Besides the xxlist spamming, consider "sh" as "showme" and "ch" as "chat to all". Then combine that with the 2 letters of the list, and with an optional "g" to grep (search for) a string. "greping" is a way to search for a string and show the resulting logs that might match the string. This is very useful for picking out key items to spam.<br>
The syntax is xxgzz <string to search for> where xx = sh or ch for showme or chatall, and zz = 2 letter channel<br>
eg: <b>shgte Joe</b> Would show any telepaths with "joe" in them.<br>
eg: <b>chgsa I am a tard!</b> Would chat to all any says with "i am a tard!" in them.
<br>
You can't "shsa" (showme says), the call to show them is "salist". But later I'll explain how you can see lists locally (showme).<br>
<br>
<b>Listing the logs to yourself.</b><br>
<b>xxlist</b> -- show me the entire log for a channel (eg: <b>salist</b>)<br>
<b>xxlist [value]</b> -- show the last xx logs. eg: <b>salist 5</b> = show me the last 5 says in the log.<br>
<b>xxlist #-#</b> -- showme the index range. eg: <b>chlist 50-76</b> (showme chat log indexes 50 through 76)<br>
<i>note: xxlist 20-20 would show just index #20.</i><br>
<b>shgxx [String]</b> -- search for a string in a log. eg: <b>shgdr Snore!</b> Find any dreams that have "snore!" in them.<br><br>
<b>Listing the logs via Chatall</b><br>
<b>chxx [value]</b> -- Chatall the last xx logs. eg: <b>chgo 5</b> chatall the last 5 gossips.<br>
<b>chxx #-#</b> -- Chatall an index range of a log. eg: <b>chsh 30-37</b> chatall the shout index range 30-37<br>
<b>chxx #x</b> -- Chatall an speific index number. eg: <b>chsa #703</b> chatall saylog index number 703.<br>
<b>chgxx [string]</b> -- Search for a string and chatall any matching logs. eg: <b>chgte You are an idiot!</b> Would chat to all any tell that has "you are an idiot!" in it.<hr>
There are 4 "miscellaneous" channels that you can customize. misc1-misc5. You can use these for whatever you want to log. You'll just have to make up the appropriate actions/aliases. You can also add things to existing lists. I have modified my own logs to store certain things that aren't in the script by default. For example, I made an action to put recieved mail spam into the "give" list. So I can review who sent me what via mail. You can change colors and such in the script to suit your tastes, or change the way things are stored. A good use for the additional miscX channel logs might be for storing things like who's looted what from a corpse. Nice for review and getting pissed off at people. :p<br>
The script is actually pretty basic. All commands are grouped as "ChLog" The DLL has limited internal help, <b>/calldll ChannelLog Help</b> for some confusing words from the King of hmm Muscles, Baalzebul.<br><br>
Enjoy!<br>
