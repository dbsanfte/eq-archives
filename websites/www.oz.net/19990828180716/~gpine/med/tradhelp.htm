<P><B>Trading Help (for the newbie)
<HR></B>Here are a few tips to hopefully answer some questions about trading,
and get you out there making that &quot;big&quot; money.
<HR><B>What IS trading all about?<BR>
</B>Medievia has an &quot;economy&quot; system. Throughout the land there
are a number of trade posts (usually near a major zone or city). Players
can purchase frieght carriers and supplies at these trade posts. Haul them
to another post, and sell them, hopefully at a good profit.<BR>
Trade is one of the main ways of making money on Medievia (the other being
selling equipement, and the last is working in the brothel in Trellor --
well that's what the Heros do anyway).<BR>
It is possible to lose money trading, but more likely to make something.
The amount varies, you might make 6+Million, or just a few coins. That
is the risk one takes on trade runs.
<HR><B>Is Trade easy?<BR>
</B>No, trading is a pain. Recommended levels are 20+, and invisibility
and sneak are almost necessary for the longer (and more hazardous) trade
runs.<BR>
Runs can take from about 10 minutes (short runs) to hours. All dependent
on the post you leave from, and the distance, and hazards of the wilderness
to the post you will arrive at.
<HR><B>What are the GOOD runs?<BR>
</B>This question always arises... The answer varies, as the economy changes.
The simple way to find a good run (but not necessarily accurate) is to
buy a newspaper, and 'read trading'. The more accurate way is to fly to
some posts, buy a mule and VALUE items from other posts (see below about
valuing). Just because the paper (or even valuing) might show a good run
available, you might do the run, only to find the value has decreased noticably,
and you make nothing. (being that other people may have beaten you to the
post). Trading is often somewhat of a race -- who can get what to where
first.
<HR><B>Valuing items<BR>
</B>There are two ways to find good runs, well 3. (the third being that
someone tells you about a good run).<BR>
1. Reading Trading in the newspaper.<BR>
2. Going to a post(s) and valuing items (the most accurate method).<BR>
Either way, you will see some values given. Here's how to do some simple
math to figure out what IS a good run.<BR>
First, check out my Trading info, and save that web page to file, print
it out for easy reference. <A HREF="http://www.oz.net/~gpine/med/trading.htm">Trade
info<BR>
</A>Now go to a trade post, and buy a mule (bring money foo!).<BR>
Then just type in &quot;value [item]&quot; ie: value silks. The post will
tell you how much the item is worth if you sell it AT the post you are
at.<BR>
The math is simple. Once you know the item, and it's value, just multiply
that by the maximum loadout (reference the trade sheet that I have online
for max loads per freight type).<BR>
Now you know the profit you would make hauling that item. If you used the
newspaper, just multiple that value in the paper times the loadout for
that freight type.
<HR><B>Where is an easy run for a newbie to do?<BR>
</B>The easiest runs are around Medievia. There are 5 trade posts in that
area:<BR>
1. Medievia's Trade Post<BR>
2. Eleven's Marketplace (closest post to Medievia)<BR>
3. Ranger's Cabin<BR>
4. Quiet Temple<BR>
6. Wizard's Cart<BR>
If you feel a bit braver, a good starter &quot;long run&quot; is Dark Army
(near the city of New Genesia (fly &quot;zone&quot; is &quot;New Genesia&quot;).<BR>
NOW, keep in mind, these posts are &quot;easy runs&quot; and the values
are usually terrible (you make little money). But, if you don't sell the
goods at Medievia, you probably will make more money. That is, buy something
at &quot;Wizard's Cart&quot;, and sell it at Ranger's Cabin (a medium run).
Medievia's trade post RARELY ever buys goods at a decent price. Running
goods from these local (to Medievia) posts, but bypassing Medievia's trade
post will usually get you more money. And you still avoid the deeper wilderness'
nasty critters.
<HR><B>What are differences or advantages in freight types?<BR>
</B>1. Horse: Will travel anywhere with you. Roads, trails, forest, swamps.
But holds the least amount of goods.<BR>
2. Mule: Holds a bit more than a horse, but is stubborn (might not follow
you on occasion). Also will NOT enter swamps and perhaps other terrain
types.<BR>
3. Wagon: The 2nd largest hauler. MIGHT travel on roads (trials) that a
covered wagon won't go on. (I dunno, and I'm too lazy to test it).<BR>
4. Covered: Holds the most, but will only travel on good ROADS.<BR>
!!Don't forget to SELL your freight type after you sell your supplies!!
<HR><B>Buying items<BR>
</B>Once you have a freight type (horse, etc), you can buy Multiple items.
It's simple, just &quot;buy [amount] [item]&quot; .. ie: buy 100 silks.
The same works for selling. It's AlWAYS best to sell in LARGE quantities,
as the value drops immediately after the sell. (sell 100 silks).<BR>

<HR><B>Abandoning Freight<BR>
</B>For various reasons you might wish to abandon your freight. This is
simple, you just type &quot;abandon&quot; and you no longer have control
of your frieght. You can also &quot;take [freighttype]&quot; (take wagon,
take mule) if you find an abandoned freight type. Keep in mind, abandoned
freight will be DELETED if the mud resets (crash, etc..)!!
<HR><B>Lost Freight<BR>
</B>On occasion you might lose your freight. Simply type &quot;score&quot;
and look near the bottom of your score. It will tell your the general direction
to, and how far from, your freight you are. IF YOU JUST DIED, OR THE MUD
CRASHED, and you have LOST your freight (not in sight, not on score). Just
Camp, Quit, and Re-Log in. This is a small bug in the code, but is simply
fixed if you camp, quit, and return.
<HR><B>What to expect along the trail..<BR>
</B>Depending on how far you're going, and your class, make sure you have
food and water, enough money to buy your freight, and buy a dragon flight
or 2 (just in case you have to fly out quickly, or call a dragon to defend
you). Visit the Medievia web page, and check out the MedMap .. it is very
helpful if you lose your way .. well you have to basically know the region
to understand the map..<BR>
As far as mobs go, if you stay near to medievia you will find the going
fairly easy. But get a ways away, and the critters get tougher and tougher.
Banelars, Abominations, Phantoms, Troll Lords, Renegade Wizards, Winged
Fire Devils, Evil Dragons, and more! But, typically only the furthest regions
are very harsh. The majority of the time you will find trade to be boring
(and a general pain in the butt -- just a lot of walking).
