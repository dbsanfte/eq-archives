    <b>plagiarism</b> n 1: a piece of writing that has been copied from someone else and is presented
    as being your own work 2: the act of plagiarizing; taking someone's words or ideas as if
    they were your own (source: <i>WordNet(r) 1.6, (c)1997 Princeton University</i>)<br><br>
    
    <b>copyright</b> noun : the exclusive legal right to reproduce, publish, and sell the matter and
    form<br>
    adjective : secured by copyright (condensed from: <i>Merriam-Webster's Collegiate(r) Dictionary</i>)<br><br>

    <b>theft</b> noun 1: the act of stealing; specifically: the felonious taking and removing of
    personal property with intent to deprive the rightful owner of it (condensed from:
     <i>Merriam-Webster's Collegiate(r) Dictionary</i>)<br><br>

    I have decided to remove myself, Omawarisan, from Medievia as a "quiet" protest over some issues
    that I consider worthy of needing resolution. While I'm still a supporter of Medievia, I believe that
    the copyrights of DIKU/Merc and any others that might be stuffed in Med's code base must be upheld and
    respected. This would require, in my belief, very little effort to resolve.<br><br>
    Either:<br>
    <i>Painless (albeit not without embarrassment) solution, and the morally right solution:</i><br>
    1. Per the copyright and license agreement of Diku, re-instate the credits and restruture "donations"
    to offline products
    (in following with the license agreement).<br>
    or<br>
    <i>Painful solution (due to having to actually do a lot more work), and also morally right:</i><br>
    2. Write the code from scratch. Thereby securing it as PURE Medievia code, protected by it's own
    legitimate copyright.<br>
    or<br>
    3. Legal evidence is presented by Medievia that <i>proves</i> that indeed Medievia IV contains no Diku
    code and is <i>not</i> a derivative work of Diku.<br><br>

    I would encourage everyone to check out the information found on these various resources:<br>
    USENET Newsgroup: rec.games.mud.diku<br>
    Web site: <a href="http://www.kavir.dial.pipex.com/med.html">KaVir's Site</a><br>
    Web site: <a href="http://home.jam.rr.com/slithytoves/kurt/Medievia.html">Cestus's Site</a>
    <br><br>

    Let me again say, I SUPPORT Medievia and wish it well, and in fact miss my friends, questing, and
    just simply enjoying the mud. But I stand firm that Omawarisan will not return there until a
    solution to this issue is found that satisfies Medievia and the Diku license holders.
    <br><br>

    So, why Did I (Oma) leave Med? Because there is overwhelming evidence that Medievia IV is not only
    a derivative of Diku, but contains stock and modified Diku code. All the while Mike Krause has
    ignored, avoided, or denied the issue. As well as not giving credit to the Diku authors PER the
    Diku license agreement.<br>
    My thought is simply to return the credit where credit <i>is</i> due. While I can't speak for the
    Diku team, I'm pretty positive that doing just that (giving credit) would make Diku more than happy.
    It is after all Diku's work at the <i>foundation</i> of Medievia.<br><br>
