Crime Underground

Mobs of Interest:
  Vonleige - tough (forget eq)
  Ankor - in hidden cell with lots of other mobs (forget eq)
  Recruiter - in "c" passage to north, and other places too. (bag of holding?)
  Black Gargoyles - in "c" passage, bags of holding, hard kills.
  Lots of sneaking thieves (hidden life)

a - one of the first rooms (a crate is in it). Have to kill a mob to get the
    crowbar (a key) in this area. Unlocking crate opens door to the C.U.
b- Vonleige's Study, have fun.
c - Going north are hard mobs, Gargoyles have bags of holding as may
    recruiter. Go too far north and you can't return south. You'll end up
    in Trellor (Trellor's sewer if I recall).
    Going south -- I forget if you can go south, so it remains unmapped.
d - hidden cell -- lots of norty mobs, including Ankor
