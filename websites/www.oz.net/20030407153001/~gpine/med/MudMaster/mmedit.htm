<img src="images/MMEdit.png"><br></center>

MM Edit is a little app for writing scripts for Mud Master. MM Edit is in <b>Beta</b> and is yet unfinished and definitely not free of bugs. If you choose to use MM Edit, you do so willingly and you accept all risks and damages that may occur from using this application.<br><br>

Some of the features in MM Edit:<br><br>
<b>Colored Text</b><br>
MM Edit will color, on the fly (as you type),  particular strings to help visually denote key parts of your script. The colors can be defined so you can choose whatever color setup you like.<br><br>
<b>Colorize Existing Scripts</b><br>
You can add color to an existing script file that wasn't written with MM Edit.<br><br>
<b>Script Compiler</b><br>
You can write scripts in "code" style, then compile them.<br><br>
<b>Command|Procedure|Other - insertion/help</b><br>
You can edit and add/remove/modify items that are placed in a list. Then insert these items into your script, and/or call up help about each item that is in the list.<br><br>
<b>Asc/Chr Tool</b><br>
A simple tool to show you the Ascii value of a given character, or show the character of a given Ascii value.<br><br>
<b>Ansi Proc inserter</b><br>
Tired of endlessly typing ansi proc strings into your display showmes? Just click a button to insert them.<br><br>
<b>Bracer Matching</b><br>
Find matching (or missing) bracers.<br><br>
<b>Bookmark</b><br>
Tired of scrolling around a big script, only to lose where you were last editing? Simply set a bookmark to easily return to where you left off.<br><br>

<u><b>Beta Release</b></u><br>
If you'd like to fiddle around with MM Edit then feel free to do so.
It is in "Beta", and is yet unfinished. To install just unzip it and
put it in some directory somewhere and run it. (Please READ the Install doc, and I recommend looking at the Changes doc)<br><br>

If you want to save a colorized file, save it as an *.RTF file. If you
want to use it as a script file, save it as plain text (removes all
rtf info).<br><br>

I removed the Mini Calculator from the app and made it a seperate application. If you'd like it, you can get it here:<br>
<a href="MiniCalc.htm">Mini Calc</a><br><br>

<a href="mmsc.htm">MMSC</a> - Link to the MM Script Compiler. (Note: MM Edit has the ability to compile "MMSC" style scripts, so this app isn't really needed anymore.)
