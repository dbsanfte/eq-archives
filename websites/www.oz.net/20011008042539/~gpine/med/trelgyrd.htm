<PRE>Trellor Graveyard and area out the west gate

Note: You need a boat for most of &quot;underground&quot;, there is a boat shop &quot;a&quot;.
Not much to note about this area, limited eq/xp. But Mamba Owl in Graveyard
is great xp (4million total) and very very hard (10,041hp/lev43 mob last time
and only time I saw it rep via a god chuckling over my rotten corpse :)
  Other mobs in Gyard aren't hard, some so so mobs around the boat shop/
  training area.
Exiting out at the &quot;x's&quot; can be fatal, as norty mobs abound outside of Trellor.

the &quot;/&quot; and &quot;\&quot; are up/down exits, the &quot;v ^ &lt; &gt;&quot; just try to denote exit
directions.
