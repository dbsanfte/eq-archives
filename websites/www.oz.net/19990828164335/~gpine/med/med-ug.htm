<PRE>Medievia Secret Undergound

Most mobs sneak (hidden life) and are aggresive. Good place for newbie
groups to explore. Some decent items for newbies-lev15 or so; bands (makes
you invis), bracelets, and lapis (sell for money at jewellery shop).
Perhaps the best money making place for newbies, until they start trade runs.

a - Exit Only, you can only exit from the underground here, not enter it.
b - Enter/exit at warehouse along Fisherman's Wharf (Crate) (south end of Med)
c - Enter only (from South Street at park) (&quot;main&quot; entrance to Undergnd)
