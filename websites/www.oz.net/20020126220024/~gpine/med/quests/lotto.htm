<P><B>Lotto -- </B>updated 21Feb, 10:47pm PST, new/updated info is highlighted
in <FONT COLOR="#FFFF00">yellow</FONT></P>

<P>Lotto is a way to spend a few coins in hopes of a nice payoff.</P>

<P>Basically when the game runs, you can buy 1 ticket. The ticket price
is 50,000 coins.</P>

<P>When you buy a ticket, I&nbsp;will match 1/2 the price of that ticket.
So if you spend 50k on a ticket, I'll toss 25k into the pot, for a total
of 75k. <FONT COLOR="#808000">UNTIL the pot is at or above 2.5M</FONT>,
then I will no longer feed 'bonus' money into the pot.</P>

<P>Once you buy a ticket, you can tell me &quot;<FONT COLOR="#808000">pick
x x x</FONT>&quot;, where &quot;x&quot; = <FONT COLOR="#FFFF00">a number
from 1-8</FONT>. eg: pick 4 4 8, pick 1 2 3, pick 5 5 5, pick 7 4 9.. any
order that you want. NOTE that numbers can repeat. So 5 5 5 is a valid
range. There is a <FONT COLOR="#FFFF00">1:512</FONT> chance to pick all
3 matching numbers. The numbers must match in exact order. ie: 1 3 5 =
1 3 5 // 5 1 3 != 1 3 5 // 1 5 3 = 1 3 5&nbsp;(One Match). Consider each
number a 'slot' .. if the winning numbers are 7 4 1, in the first 'slot'
if you have a 7, that is a match. etc.</P>

<P>After a bit of time, I'll no longer sell tickets, and will either 1.
Save the info for running the lotto at a later date, or 2. Run it to find
the winner(s).&nbsp;You do NOT have to be online to win. Payments will
come via bank transfers. You can verify if you won by reading the quest
board. Lotto winning info will be posted there. Note the dates of the post,
as there may be multiple lotto posts on the board.</P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFFFF">Winning information, including the start pot amount,
total pot amount, winning values, and list of winning players will be posted
on the Quest Board. The quest board is north of the bank in Med, upstairs
(in the quest shop).</FONT></P>

<P>Once run for the payout breakdown is like so:</P>

<P>1. Eliminate anyone that didn't match any numbers.</P>

<P>2. Find players that only matched 1 number. Reduce the Pot by the amount
payed out to 1 match winners. 1-match winnings are figured as: <FONT COLOR="#808000">[(LottoPot
/ </FONT><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00">9</FONT><FONT COLOR="#808000">) / NumberOfOneMatches]</FONT>
.. This is 1/9th of the pot, split by the number of 1-match winners. Say
the pot is 4,000,000. 12 players get 1 match. so: [(4000000/9)/12] = 37,037
payed out to each of the 12 1-match winners. One Match payouts will rarely
be at or above the cost of the ticket.&nbsp;It's possible that a 1 match
winner can be high, but this will be rare.<BR>
The pot is reduced by the amount paided out to 1-match winners.<FONT COLOR="#FFFF00">
If the payout to 1-match winners is less than 50k, the prize will be 50k
(due to bank transfer limit of 50k minimum).</FONT></P>

<P>3. Find players that matched 2 numbers. Like 1 match, but the formula
is: <FONT COLOR="#808000">[(LottoPot / 3) / NumberOfTwoMatches]</FONT>.
This is 1/3rd of the pot, split by all 2-match winners.<BR>
The pot is reduced by the amount paided out to 2-match winners.</P>

<P>4. Find players that matched ALL three numbers. The Entire pot, divided
by the number of players will ALL three matching numbers, is the award.
Formula for payment is: <FONT COLOR="#808000">LottoPot / NumberOfAllMatches</FONT>.</P>

<P>5. The remaining pot, if any, is checked. Omawarisan's money that he
put in is removed, if the value of the re-adjust pot is &gt; 1M, the pot
is saved over for the next lotto. If it's below 1M, it defaults to 1M for
the next lotto. In this way, it is very possible to see the pot grow over
time.</P>
