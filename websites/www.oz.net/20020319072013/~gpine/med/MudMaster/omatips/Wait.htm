<u><b>Wait. Wait! WAIT!! bah!</b></u><br>
Need a pause in your script? Former zMud users probably are familiar with #wait. It's a
handy command. If you don't know, here's what it basically does... Somewhere in your
script you want the process to pause for a length of time, then continue executing. Well
MM doesn't have such a command, although it's been asked for a number of times.<br>
But MM DOES have the ability to do this, and it's simple, very simple.<br><br>

You need a couple vars, nothing important. One's for a time stamp, another is just
for junk (temp).<br>
Then just a simple /while statement.<br><br>

/var {wtime} {0}<br>
/var {temp} {null}<br>
...in the script where you want a pause just add the following:<br>
[previous command];/var {wtime} {@Time()};/while {@Math(@Time()-$wtime)<=5} {/var temp null};[continue on with commands]<br><br>

Because /while is like an if and a loop, the /while process will effectively "wait"
for the given duration (in the above example for 5 seconds). Then the script will
continue on.
