races</P>

<P>Here's a quick explaination about the quests that I'm (Omawarisan) currently
running. You should know, there is a Quest (bulletin) Board in the Quest
Shop. It's just north of the bank in Medievia, upstairs. The Quest board
is something you ought to glance at on occasion. While I often write notes
upon it on a whim, and they can read a bit awkwardly, it is still the place
to get info when you're playing Medievia. </P>

<P><B>**Fishing Quest**</B></P>

<P>Silly as it is, there are times when a player just wants to unwind with
a jug of ale (water for you kids), some fishing line, and a few demented
friends and go fishing. The Fishing Quest is all about silliness, and started
as a joke late one night.. anyway... <BR>
</P>

<UL>
<LI>Required Levels: none<BR>
</LI>

<LI>Required EQ: fishing line (don't ask me where it loads)<BR>
</LI>

<LI>Location: Various lakes and streams throughout the wilderness of Medievia<BR>
</LI>

<LI>Scoring: Fish have random weights, score is total weight turned in.<BR>
</LI>

<LI>Time: 1 hour, best score at end of time wins.<BR>
</LI>

<LI>Prize: Winner gets Held or Line renamed (temporary), free Title change
for player too. <BR>
</LI>

<LI>Object: You catch fish, turn them in for scoring. Simple. You should
have a boat, or levatation, although I'll load a few boats just in case
you're stranded on water. There are a variety of fish you can catch, each
is worth so many pounds. You turn them in, and get a score of 1-MaxWeight
(it's random). This is the Wilderness, and some norty mobs float, so bewarned
-- you can die. <BR>
</LI>

<LI>Commands: (in tells to Omawarisan, unless noted otherwise) <BR>
</LI>

<UL>
<LI>enroll me - tells you to ensure that you have line<BR>

<P><B>**Mob Hunt Quest**</B></P>

<UL>
<LI>Required Levels: none<BR>
</LI>

<LI>Required EQ: none<BR>
</LI>

<LI>Location: entire wilderness of medievia, Omawarisan and the Duke are
in the Quest Shop<BR>
</LI>

<LI>Scoring: Various payment for mob corpses<BR>
</LI>

<LI>Time: 1 hour<BR>
</LI>

<LI>Prize: No actual &quot;winner&quot;, you keep what you earned. <BR>
</LI>

<LI>Object: The Duke of Trellor gets upset at all the hideous mobs which
roam about the wilderness. And at times he's willing to make payments to
valiant hunters for the corpses of certain mobs. Mob Hunt has you go out
and kill WILDERNESS mobs. There are currently 75 different mobs that are
valid 'kills'. Return the corpse to Omawarisan (give corpse omawarisan)
and you get some coins. The harder the mob, the better the payoff. There
is a special &quot;bounty&quot; mob, which is worth at least 50k, or double
its normal value, whichever is greater. Once the bounty mob is turned in,
a new bounty mob is selected at random. Even if the limit of a certain
mob type is filled, if it's the bounty mob, it's still worth a reward.
(There is a limit to how many corpses of each mob can be turned in, once
the limit is reached the Duke will no longer pay rewards for it). There
is no transporting of players.. you must return to the Quest Shop and give
Omawarisan the corpse on your own. No heals, no potions, etc... <BR>
</LI>

<LI>Commands: <BR>
</LI>

<UL>
<LI>Simply just give corpse(s) to Omawarisan. There is no enrollment. <BR>

<LI>score - see how much you have earned<BR>
</LI>

<LI>bounty - check which mob is the &quot;Bounty Mob&quot;<BR>
</LI>

<P><B>**Hero Hunt Quest**</B></P>

<UL>
<LI>Required Levels: Anyone Total Level 10+ may join<BR>
</LI>

<LI>Required EQ: none<BR>
</LI>

<LI>Location: the arena in med (new area is under construction) <BR>
</LI>

<LI>Scoring: Kill high level player = more points, Lower level = less or
minus points<BR>
</LI>

<LI>Time: 1 hour, best score(s) at end of time wins. <BR>
</LI>

<LI>Prize: Game prizes, per &quot;class&quot; (Single, Dual, Triple, Quad,
Hero) are: 1st-50k, 2nd-blue orb, 3rd-green orb. Total scores 'roll over'
in a &quot;Tournament Score&quot;. After 10 games, the top 3 in the Tournament
get: 1st-500k, 2nd-250k, 3rd-100k. <BR>
</LI>

<LI>Object: The object is the kill! It's a pk fest. You score higher if
you kill someone higher level than you, BUT the game takes both Level and
Total Level into account. Say you're a Single 26 (TLev26) you kill a TLev41
(that's higher..but it's only a Lev10.. Your score is based off the TLev
and Level, most likely a 26 killing a 10 (albeit a TLev41) probably isn't
wise. Titles denote player levels, so it's important to pay attention to
titles (NOTE: Due to new Title structure, this game is in limbo). Lower
Level players have a 'fun' attack, Suicide -- seek out heros and attack!
As the hero strikes you down, you decrease their score (actually not just
heros, just about anyone that's upper level will suffer!). <BR>
NOTE: This game is very scoring intensive, and I lag a TON due to the amount
of spam and math routines. Be patient with me. When you tell me a command,
wait at LEAST 20 seconds for it to happen. Spamming me only results in
my further slowing down. <BR>
Scoring is by &quot;class&quot;, I rank Top Overall, Heros, Quads, Triples,
Duals, and Singles. The main object is to be the best in your class. Top
Overall only really matters for the tournament score. The last person left
alive in the arena wins the &quot;Last Man Standing&quot; award (500pts).

get 5 kills on level 5 wins. The higher the level, the fewer rooms in it
(level 5 is only 4 rooms big). <BR>

<P><B>**Belt Championships**</B></P>

<P>Belt Championships are held by arrangement for 1 person. This quest
pits you against 12 mobs. You fight them 2 at a time. You are racing the
clock. There are areas in the quest shop where you can see the current
Champions (statues) and scores (tablets) per class (warrior, thief, mage,
cleric). Do you think you have what it takes to beat the best time? (I'm
not telling too much about this quest, you must just enroll and give it
a try to learn it). Know that it is not easy, lower classes will die quickly.
Recommended that you are HIGH level, and a multi. <BR>
</P>

<P><B>**Grudge Matches**</B></P>

<P>Grudge matches are simply way to bash in the head of that annoying person
in a &quot;controlled&quot; environment. There are 2 match areas. NPK and
CPK. It is up to you and your opponent which area you wish to use. Either
way, it costs 1 Million Gold (a bar) per player. Grudges are done by arrangement
(just ask me), and are currently just for 1 on 1 engagement (formation/team
grudges coming on day I suppose). When you enter, you're in a safe room.
I'll explain some stuff, etc. Once ready I'll transport you and your opponent
into the area. The survivor gets the gold (and looting if CPK). Mindlink
is available. </P>

<P><B>**PK Gold**</B></P>

<UL>
<LI>Required Levels: Level Restrictions vary per game. Fairly tight restrictions
usually. <BR>
</LI>

<LI>Required EQ: none<BR>
</LI>

<LI>Location: Uses Ladder Quest area, but all floors are open. <BR>
</LI>

<LI>Scoring: 200k for a kill, -100k for dying<BR>
</LI>

<LI>Time: runs until the pot runs dry<BR>
</LI>

<LI>Prize: you make money, you keep it. otherwise your lose :) <BR>
</LI>

<LI>Object: PK Gold requires 1 Million Gold (a bar) to enter. Your entry
'fee' is put into a pot. Naturally the more entries, the better the pot.
One entering your score is 0 (coins). Kill someone you get 200k on your
score, die you lose 100k from your score. NOTE: If your score is negative
(ie: -1300000) you do not &quot;owe&quot; anything, just your initial 1M
entry bar. A negative score only means it's that much harder to go positive.
When a player dies, the pot is reduced by 200k (the killers payoff). Once
the pot is at 0, the game is over. The pot is not reimbursed by the dying
person (who loses -100k). After the game, if you have won money, it will
be mailed to you. NOTE: If you leave the game (via &quot;med me&quot;)
You CANNOT return. Your score is saved though, so if you had earnings,
you will recieve them). <BR>

</LI>

<LI>kill me - enter the fray! <BR>
</LI>

</LI>

<LI>Prize: dunno yet, gold perhaps. Free titles for survivors<BR>
</LI>

<LI>Object: Up to four full forms (9 per form). Red, Blue, Gold, and Magenta
teams. Each team has a Captain. The object is to keep your captain alive,
while killing the other team's captains. When a captain is killed, that
captains team (and the captain) are elminated from the game. When a player
kills an enemy, the killer's captain gets a heal from me. Other than that,
there is no ingame interference from me. Anything goes in the zone. You
may break your team into small squads, or stay in a form of 9. Defend,
offend, both -- it's up to your team. Once dead your are OUT and cannot
return. One RULE: do NOT pick up flags. You may sac them (one's on the
ground). Do NOT hold, put in a bag, or drop your flag. The Flags identify
teams. <BR>

is selected at random -- you have no choice about who you fight. After
each round there is time to &quot;regroup&quot; and prepare yourself of
the next round. Players in each round are halved (duh, as 1/2 are elminated).
16\8\4\2\winner. COATS are NOT allowed, NOR are ELEMENTALS. Anyone caught

<P><B>**Totem Quest**<BR>
</B>The Totem quest is kind of like a scavenger hunt/clue-search. There
are special mobs, &quot;totems&quot; that do something when you kiss them.
Primarily it works by clues, that is, I give the initial clue to the first
totem, you find it, kiss it, get a clue to the next totem. The totem quest
great because it offers me a lot of potential things to do for each quest,
as no totem quest is exactly alike.</P>

<P>There are usually 10 totems per quest. The first few are fairly easy
to find (allowing newbies a chance at the quest. The further along you
go, the harder it might become to find the next totem. Players should expect
ANYTHING. NPK, CPK, lots of dragon flights, running round the wilderness,
need for special equipment, etc...</P>

<P>Some totems require that you have in your inventory a certain item when
you &quot;kiss totem&quot;! Others only require a kiss. Some totems might
be walking around a zone, while others are stationary.</P>

<P>When you succeed in finding a totem, you're given a Token (MAKE SURE
THAT YOU CAN RECIEVE ITEMS!! Clear up your inventory!!). Give the token
to me for prize money! This way, you can finish a few totems, and still
win something. Naturally the further you go long, finding harder totems,
the more money you get per token. Also, tokens drop if you die! So watch
out for pk'rs that want to take your tokens! IT IS YOUR RESPONSIBILITY
TO HAVE A CLEAR INVENTORY, MISSED TOKENS WILL NOT BE LOADED -- I have no
time to fuss about loading tokens for people that cannot manage their inventories!</P>

<P>Totem quests take anywhere from 1-4 hours or so.<BR>

<LI>Time: approx. 1 hour<BR>
</LI>

<LI>Prize: Keep any gold you make<BR>
</LI>

<LI>Object: General PK, but in an active zone (with mobs). Kill someone
and you get some gold. The higher the killed person's level, the more gold
you get. If mobs kill you, you'll get restored. So no real risk. </LI>
