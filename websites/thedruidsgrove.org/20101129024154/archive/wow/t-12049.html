<br />
The latest patch notes can always be found at http://www.worldofwarcraft.com/patchnotes/<br />
General<br />
<br />
    * Voice Chat - The new Voice Chat feature is now available in game. Players will need to go into the Options menu under Sound &amp; Voice to activate it. Volume sliders are available for the microphone, speakers, and game-audio fade (which automatically lowers the game audio when a voice communication is received), as is a “push-to-talk” setting. Right-clicking on a player’s name now includes the option to mute or unmute that player. Muting another player blocks all voice chat from him or her; the ignore feature now blocks both voice chat and text chat from that player.For the Voice Chat F.A.Q. visit the following links: http://forums.worldofwarcraft.com/thread.html?topicId=942815291&amp;sid=1 http://forums.worldofwarcraft.com/thread.html?topicId=1272012664&amp;sid=1<br />
    * Chat Channels- New Chat Channel controls and functionality are now available under the Chat tab in the Social window of the interface. The interface will now show the channels players are in or are available to them, depending on the area of the world they are in, along with the addition of new private channel controls.<br />
    * A new feature for reporting players as being AFK in battlegrounds by right clicking has been added. When enough reports are registered, a 60 second debuff will begin to count down. Once the timer is up a new debuff will appear that will prevent the player from gaining any honor while it is on. This debuff can be negated as soon as the player engages in PvP combat.<br />
    * Haste: Haste has been rebalanced. It has returned to the ratios from the launch of Burning Crusade. Melee attacks and spell casts will now benefit at identical rates from haste. This change results in a reduction in the benefit of haste for melee attacks and an increase in the benefit for spellcasters.<br />
    * Troll Berserk: The spell haste on this ability was incorrectly too high and has been corrected.<br />
    * Resilience Rating: The reduction to the percent chance to get a critical strike now also reduces the damage dealt by damage over time effects by the same percentage.<br />
    * Daze: Defense skill will no longer reduce the chance players have to receive the Daze effect when attacked from behind by enemies.<br />
    * Area Spells: In some cases guards in neutral areas would not aggro against pvp attacks from area spells. That is now fixed.<br />
    * Corrected the damage modifier calculation for Resilience when the attacker has bonus critical strike damage.<br />
    * Power Regeneration: Any effect which triggers a change in your rate of power regeneration (Mana, Rage, Energy, Focus) will now cause an immediate reward of some power at the old rate of increase, and then begin new “ticks” of power at the new rate approximately 2 seconds later. This was done to improve functionality of abilities such as Evocation and Innervate so that they did not have wasted “ticks”.<br />
    * Mac Movie Capture: the Mac client can now capture in-game video to QuickTime movie files using a configurable choice of codec, resolution, and frame rate. Two new entries have been added to the Key Bindings dialog for start/stop recording and for cancellation of a recording. For more detailed configuration options please see the Mac Options panel in game. Mac OS X 10.4.9 and QuickTime 7.1.6 or better are required. Not all machines have enough performance to smoothly capture video at high frame rates; end user experimentation will be required to find appropriate settings for each system.<br />
    * Pets are now affected by Paladin greater blessings.<br />
    * Kill Triggered Effects: Effects that trigger from killing your target will no longer trigger from killing your pet.<br />
    * Non-combat pets may not be selected as the target for spells or abilities.<br />
    * Non-combat pets now have the tag &quot;Companion&quot; instead of &quot;Minion&quot;.<br />
    * Being attacked by guardians, such as summoned Treants, will no longer automatically cause neutral guards to attack you.<br />
    * Meeting Stones can no longer be used to summon players that do not meet the level requirements.<br />
    * Damage and health leech effects always affect flying players even if they are immune to the rest of the spell’s affects while in flight. <br />
<br />
PvP<br />
<br />
    * Dueling players may not use a Lightwell that they didn’t create themselves.<br />
    * Battlegrounds<br />
          o Eye of the Storm: The points awarded from capturing the flag now increase based on the number of bases the capturing teams owns. <br />
    * Arenas<br />
          o Arena calculations have been modified. In addition, the penalty for smaller arena teams (2v2, 3v3) has been slightly reduced.<br />
          o Items that are indicated as quest items in their tooltips and have a &quot;use&quot; or &quot;equip&quot; ability will not work in PvP arenas.<br />
          o Players will no longer be able to change armor once an arena battle has begun. Changing armor will still be available during the one-minute prep time prior to the battle. Main hand, off hand and ranged weapon swapping in combat remains unchanged. <br />
<br />
Druids<br />
<br />
    * Cat Form (Night Elf) melee attack range was too short compared to Tauren Cat Form and other attack ranges. It has been increased.<br />
    * Cyclone: It is no longer possible to Cyclone two targets at the same time in the outdoor world.<br />
    * Cyclone: Paladin Auras, Trueshot Aura, and Aspect of the Pack will now be automatically reactivated when Cyclone wears off of a victim who had one of the abilities active.<br />

    * Entangling Roots: It is no longer possible to have more than one rank of this spell active on a player.<br />

    * Lacerate: The damage from this ability will now stack properly when two different characters are applying Lacerate to a target.<br />
    * Mangle: The duration remaining graphic will now display properly for Mangle after it has been refreshed on a target. It will also no longer sometimes apply the Mangle debuff to nearby targets when the Mangle victim is killed by Mangle.<br />

    * Tree of Life: The party aura from this shapeshift now extends the full 40-yard radius as stated in the tooltip. <br />

    * Aspect of the Pack: This ability will now cause party members to become dazed when struck while sitting.<br />
    * Aspect of the Viper: This ability has received a slight redesign. The amount of mana regained will increase as the Hunter’s percentage of mana remaining decreases. At about 60% mana, it is equivalent to the previous version of Aspect of the Viper. Below that margin, it is better (up to twice as much mana as the old version); while above that margin, it will be less effective. The mana regained never drops below 10% of intellect every 5 sec. or goes above 50% of intellect every 5 sec.<br />
    * Freezing Trap and Scare Beast duration against PvP targets has been reduced to 10 seconds.<br />
    * Hunter's Mark: The duration remaining graphic will now display properly for Hunter's Mark after it has been refreshed on a target, and will properly consume mana when recasting it to refresh its duration.<br />

    * Kill Command no longer affects the Hunter’s current target.<br />
    * Misdirection: Items used while Misdirection is active will now consume a charge correctly.<br />

    * Volley: This spell is now affected by area damage caps. Its bonus damage coefficients have also been increased. It also correctly consumes charges of Misdirection.<br />
    * Hunter Pets<br />
          o Raptors can now learn Dash. <br />

    * Blizzard: This spell is now affected by area damage caps. Its bonus damage coefficients have also been increased.<br />

    * Hammer of Wrath cast time reduced to .5 seconds, global cooldown reduced to .5 seconds.<br />
    * Illumination: Paladins will now correctly gain mana from this ability if they sit down to drink right after a healing crit, and receiving mana from this ability will no longer cause a Paladin who is sitting to stand up.<br />
    * Judgement: The Judgement spells will no longer cause triggered effects to go off twice.<br />
    * Redoubt: This ability can now trigger while the Paladin is sitting.<br />
    * Reckoning: This ability can now trigger while the Paladin is sitting.<br />

    * Seal of Righteousness: The tooltip for this ability has been improved.

    * Mind Control: Creatures immune to this spell will now cause an immediate error message rather than make it seem like the spell succeeded with no effect.<br />
    * Mind Control duration against PvP targets has been reduced to 10 seconds.<br />
