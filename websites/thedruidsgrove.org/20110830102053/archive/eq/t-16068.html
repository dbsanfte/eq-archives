&lt;NORMAL&gt;_____________________&lt;/NORMAL&gt;<br />
&lt;NORMAL&gt;&lt;/NORMAL&gt;<br />
&lt;NORMAL&gt;***  Highlights ***&lt;/NORMAL&gt;<br />
&lt;NORMAL&gt;&lt;/NORMAL&gt;<br />
&lt;NORMAL&gt;- AA Window Changes: The  AA window has been revamped and many of the AA lines have been consolidated to  make them easier to find.&lt;/NORMAL&gt;<br />
&lt;NORMAL&gt;&lt;/NORMAL&gt;<br />
&lt;NORMAL&gt;The biggest  change you'll notice when you first open the AA window is that there are only 4  tabs now - General, Archetype, Class and Special. The first three tabs are  fairly self explanatory and the Special tab will hold any AA that doesn't fit  into other tabs. For example, the &quot;Glyph&quot; (expendable) AAs will be on the  Special tab and various AAs that have been used for progression for several  expansions will live on this tab as  well.&lt;/NORMAL&gt;<br />
&lt;NORMAL&gt;&lt;/NORMAL&gt;<br />
&lt;NORMAL&gt;With the new UI, there are a  series of drop down menus you can use to view only certain sets of AAs.  Additionally, all of the column headings can be clicked to order the visible AAs  by that column in either forward or reverse alphabetical order. Finally there is  a &quot;Can Purchase&quot; button in the new UI that will narrow the list down to only the  AAs that you currently qualify to purchase.  &lt;/NORMAL&gt;<br />
&lt;NORMAL&gt;&lt;/NORMAL&gt;<br />
&lt;NORMAL&gt;In the past, new AAs have been created  that were pure upgrades to existing AA lines from previous expansions. These  added many ranks of similar abilities, each with its own name. To cut down on  the amount of data that each of the new tabs holds, many of those types of AA  lines have been consolidated into a single line. This should make it easier for  you to see where you are in a line without the need to search through multiple  tabs. You will still have all of the AAs you had previously, but their names and  ranks may have changed and you may need to recreate hotkeys for some of the  abilities in order to ensure you are using the highest rank's effect.  &lt;/NORMAL&gt;<br />
&lt;NORMAL&gt;&lt;/NORMAL&gt;<br />
&lt;NORMAL&gt;- Item Window Changes: The Item Window  has a new look and some helpful new functionality. We've changed the window to  be easier to read and you will now find a button in the middle of the window  that will let you toggle between the item's base stats and its stats with  augmentations. In addition, the name of the item will change colors depending on  if you can use it or not.&lt;/NORMAL&gt;<br />
&lt;NORMAL&gt;&lt;/NORMAL&gt;<br />
&lt;NORMAL&gt;- Triple  Attack has been implemented as a skill for those classes that had it innately  before. You will automatically receive the appropriate skill for your level with  this patch. Characters becoming eligible for triple attack after the patch can  receive it by visiting their guild  master.&lt;/NORMAL&gt;<br />
&lt;NORMAL&gt;&lt;/NORMAL&gt;<br />
&lt;NORMAL&gt;- Misty Thicket Revamp:  Halflings across the world of Norrath rejoice as the hills of Misty Thicket  flourish into a new  paradise.&lt;/NORMAL&gt;<br />
&lt;NORMAL&gt;&lt;/NORMAL&gt;<br />
&lt;NORMAL&gt;&lt;/NORMAL&gt;<br />
&lt;NORMAL&gt;***  Recently Reported Issues ***&lt;/NORMAL&gt;<br />
&lt;NORMAL&gt;&lt;/NORMAL&gt;<br />
&lt;NORMAL&gt;While some  of the other issues that were resolved in this update were reported via bug  reports, here are a few we'd like to highlight this  update.&lt;/NORMAL&gt;<br />
&lt;NORMAL&gt;&lt;/NORMAL&gt;<br />
&lt;NORMAL&gt;Issue: Guilds not able to send  guild wide emails with text in the body. &lt;/NORMAL&gt;<br />
&lt;NORMAL&gt;Summary: All of  the players in the guild are able to send in game mail messages to the entire  guild that have text in the main body. The email is sent, there is a subject  line, but none of the text entered in the body of the mail.  &lt;/NORMAL&gt;<br />
&lt;NORMAL&gt;Status: In-Game emails should now send correctly to guilds.  The maximum message size is now set to 4500 characters. The address list will  display &quot;Too many addresses to display&quot; if it is longer than 500 characters but  the message will still be sent.&lt;/NORMAL&gt;<br />
&lt;NORMAL&gt;&lt;/NORMAL&gt;<br />
&lt;NORMAL&gt;Issue:  Enchanter Epic 1.5&lt;/NORMAL&gt;<br />
&lt;NORMAL&gt;Summary: The Cryptic Page in Ocean of  Tears could no longer be located after the zone was  revamped.&lt;/NORMAL&gt;<br />
&lt;NORMAL&gt;Status: The note was moved to an island to make it  easier to find.&lt;/NORMAL&gt;<br />
&lt;NORMAL&gt;&lt;/NORMAL&gt;<br />
&lt;NORMAL&gt;Issue: Task - Pepe's  Got a Brand New Bag&lt;/NORMAL&gt;<br />
&lt;NORMAL&gt;Summary: NPC Rion is not giving the  correct item for the task 'Pepe's Got a Brand New  Bag'.&lt;/NORMAL&gt;<br />
&lt;NORMAL&gt;Status: If you ask Rion &quot;Where is Pepe?&quot; after you  receive the poison sac back from Rion, he will now properly give you the  doll.&lt;/NORMAL&gt;<br />
&lt;NORMAL&gt;&lt;/NORMAL&gt;<br />
&lt;NORMAL&gt;Issue: Black Wolf  Tooth&lt;/NORMAL&gt;<br />
&lt;NORMAL&gt;Summary: Players are unable to find the drop 'Black  Wolf Tooth' for an armor quest.&lt;/NORMAL&gt;<br />
&lt;NORMAL&gt;Status: The black wolf tooth  was added to other black wolves throughout the newbie areas of the  game.&lt;/NORMAL&gt;<br />
&lt;NORMAL&gt;&lt;/NORMAL&gt;<br />
&lt;NORMAL&gt;&lt;/NORMAL&gt;<br />
&lt;NORMAL&gt;*** Items  ***&lt;/NORMAL&gt;<br />
&lt;NORMAL&gt;&lt;/NORMAL&gt;<br />
&lt;NORMAL&gt;- Jagged Claws of Rending have  returned to being weapons built specifically to destroy Draz  Nurakk.&lt;/NORMAL&gt;<br />
&lt;NORMAL&gt;- Staff of the Hiveslayer and Wingcrusher now have a  type 4 socket type, instead of type 7.&lt;/NORMAL&gt;<br />
&lt;NORMAL&gt;- Darkfell Bow is no  longer bard useable.&lt;/NORMAL&gt;<br />
&lt;NORMAL&gt;- Twisted Staff of Temporal Paradox is  now useable by beastlords.&lt;/NORMAL&gt;<br />
&lt;NORMAL&gt;- Paza's Cursed Remains can now  be equipped in the ammo slot and cast time is reduced to 2  seconds.&lt;/NORMAL&gt;<br />
&lt;NORMAL&gt;- Type 13 and 14 Purity augments are available for  purchase from Trader Vallarines in Katta Castrum.&lt;/NORMAL&gt;<br />
&lt;NORMAL&gt;-  Augmentation solvents to dissolve (destroy) the purity augments are available  for purchase from Trader Difius in Katta Castrum.&lt;/NORMAL&gt;<br />
&lt;NORMAL&gt;- Bulwark  of the Firebringer and Buckler of Corruption are now monk and beastlord  useable.&lt;/NORMAL&gt;<br />
&lt;NORMAL&gt;- Twisted Staff of Temporal Paradox is no longer  dwarf useable.&lt;/NORMAL&gt;<br />
&lt;NORMAL&gt;- Increased stats on several Solteris  items.&lt;/NORMAL&gt;<br />
&lt;NORMAL&gt;- Increased spell effects on Solteris  items.&lt;/NORMAL&gt;<br />
&lt;NORMAL&gt;- Increased mods on most Solteris  items.&lt;/NORMAL&gt;<br />
&lt;NORMAL&gt;- Added one extra potion belt slot with Solteris  belts.&lt;/NORMAL&gt;<br />
&lt;NORMAL&gt;- Solteris items vendors will temporarily buy back  equipment for 100% of the cost.&lt;/NORMAL&gt;<br />
&lt;NORMAL&gt;- Changed augments in TBS  from Katta Castrum and the habitats to be useable in socket type 8 in addition  to socket type 7.&lt;/NORMAL&gt;<br />
&lt;NORMAL&gt;- Re-added the spell focus effect back to  Valorium Belt of Devotion that was mistakenly removed.&lt;/NORMAL&gt;<br />
&lt;NORMAL&gt;-  Increased the number of items summoned by Ton Po's Mystical Pouch and by Dusty  Worker's Soriz Pouch from 20 to 100.&lt;/NORMAL&gt;<br />
&lt;NORMAL&gt;- Slightly increased  charge amount on Pure Energeian  Orbs.&lt;/NORMAL&gt;<br />
&lt;NORMAL&gt;&lt;/NORMAL&gt;<br />
&lt;NORMAL&gt;&lt;/NORMAL&gt;<br />
&lt;NORMAL&gt;*** Quests  &lt;/NORMAL&gt;<br />
&lt;NORMAL&gt;&lt;/NORMAL&gt;<br />
&lt;NORMAL&gt;- Lowered the minimum players required  to attack Rallos Zek's final form in Plane of Tactics to 1 people.  &lt;/NORMAL&gt;<br />
&lt;NORMAL&gt;- Updated the valid zone for some older Ocean of Tears  quests to the new Ocean of Tears.&lt;/NORMAL&gt;<br />
&lt;NORMAL&gt;- The Goblin Dojo event  can now be started with 6 players instead of 12. &lt;/NORMAL&gt;<br />
&lt;NORMAL&gt;- Added  faction adjustments to several raids in Ashengate.&lt;/NORMAL&gt;<br />
&lt;NORMAL&gt;- The  Monk epic event in the Ocean of Tears will again spawn a reward  chest.&lt;/NORMAL&gt;<br />
&lt;NORMAL&gt;&lt;/NORMAL&gt;<br />
&lt;NORMAL&gt;&lt;/NORMAL&gt;<br />
&lt;NORMAL&gt;*** Spells  ***&lt;/NORMAL&gt;<br />
&lt;NORMAL&gt;&lt;/NORMAL&gt;<br />
&lt;NORMAL&gt;- To help balance the way healing  items work from class to class, healing-based AAs no longer work on heals cast  from items. Items that cast healing spells that are not castable by normal  players and were previously affected by healing AAs have had their healing  amount increased accordingly. &lt;/NORMAL&gt;<br />
&lt;NORMAL&gt;- The 30 second global cool  down on the bard song Brusco's Boastful Bellow has been changed to a 30 second  spell cool down.&lt;/NORMAL&gt;<br />
&lt;NORMAL&gt;- The spell cool down on Bind Affinity has  been removed.&lt;/NORMAL&gt;<br />
&lt;NORMAL&gt;- Long term heal-over-time (HoT) spells will  now display their messages after  zoning.&lt;/NORMAL&gt;<br />
&lt;NORMAL&gt;&lt;/NORMAL&gt;<br />
&lt;NORMAL&gt;&lt;/NORMAL&gt;<br />
&lt;NORMAL&gt;*** NPC  ***&lt;/NORMAL&gt;<br />
&lt;NORMAL&gt;&lt;/NORMAL&gt;<br />
&lt;NORMAL&gt;- Made Jala and Lyjak in Shar Vahl  less greedy in their merchant dealings.&lt;/NORMAL&gt;<br />
&lt;NORMAL&gt;- The Hatchet and  Redfang events in Demi-Plane of Blood will now drop back flag  items.&lt;/NORMAL&gt;<br />
&lt;NORMAL&gt;- Bark at the Moon and Rampaging Servant pets will  now enrage properly.&lt;/NORMAL&gt;<br />
&lt;NORMAL&gt;- Mage pets from The Serpent's Spine  will now spawn pre-equipped with a full set of Phantom Plate  armor.&lt;/NORMAL&gt;<br />
&lt;NORMAL&gt;&lt;/NORMAL&gt;<br />
&lt;NORMAL&gt;&lt;/NORMAL&gt;<br />
&lt;NORMAL&gt;***  Tradeskills ***&lt;/NORMAL&gt;<br />
&lt;NORMAL&gt;&lt;/NORMAL&gt;<br />
&lt;NORMAL&gt;- New Cultural Symbol  QUESTS have been implemented. At this time it is only the quests, and not the  other upcoming cultural drop changes. If you still have one of the old quests  they can still be completed. The NPCs will still respond. The target NPCs are  still up and still dropping the items as they were before. You just will not be  able to get the old quests any more as the NPCs will now only give out the new  quests.&lt;/NORMAL&gt;<br />
&lt;NORMAL&gt;- The recipe for making the unfired runed potion  vials used for throwing have changed. There are no new items, just a  reorganization of what is used in order to make them less expensive to create.  The Art of Delicate Throwing Things books have been updated with recipes that  match the changes.&lt;/NORMAL&gt;<br />
&lt;NORMAL&gt;- The alchemy potions Distillate of  Antidote X, Distillate of Immunization X, and Distillate of Regeneration X now  require Hypericum instead of Wormwood. You can find Hypericum where you would  find Wormwood.&lt;/NORMAL&gt;<br />
&lt;NORMAL&gt;- Fixed the naming on the pattern books to  match the patterns they make.&lt;/NORMAL&gt;<br />
&lt;NORMAL&gt;- Fixed the failure return on  some Fishy brewing.&lt;/NORMAL&gt;<br />
&lt;NORMAL&gt;- Fixed the Additive in the spell  research recipe for War March of the  Mastruq.&lt;/NORMAL&gt;<br />
&lt;NORMAL&gt;&lt;/NORMAL&gt;<br />
&lt;NORMAL&gt;&lt;/NORMAL&gt;<br />
&lt;NORMAL&gt;***  Missions ***&lt;/NORMAL&gt;<br />
&lt;NORMAL&gt;&lt;/NORMAL&gt;<br />
&lt;NORMAL&gt;- The task leader should  no longer change when the leader zones.&lt;/NORMAL&gt;<br />
&lt;NORMAL&gt;- Zhisza - Counter  Attack: All 3 major (named) mission targets will now return home when idle if  they have moved from their spawn location.  &lt;/NORMAL&gt;<br />
&lt;NORMAL&gt;&lt;/NORMAL&gt;<br />
&lt;NORMAL&gt;&lt;/NORMAL&gt;<br />
&lt;NORMAL&gt;*** AA  ***&lt;/NORMAL&gt;<br />
&lt;NORMAL&gt;&lt;/NORMAL&gt;<br />
&lt;NORMAL&gt;- Consolidated many AA lines. AAs  that were logical extensions of previous abilities have been consolidated into  single lines. For example instead of 5 different AA lines to increase critical  spell hits, there will now be 1 AA line with more ranks.&lt;/NORMAL&gt;<br />
&lt;NORMAL&gt;-  There are 4 new expendable AAs available:&lt;/NORMAL&gt;<br />
&lt;NORMAL&gt;* Glyph of Stored  Life - Stores some of your heath in a protective shield around yourself. Your  health is returned when your protection fades or is lost.&lt;/NORMAL&gt;<br />
&lt;NORMAL&gt;*  Glyph of Frantic Infusion - This ability increases the damage done by your pet  in three steps. The first step will increase your pet's minimum damage by 10%,  the next by 15% and the final step by 20%.&lt;/NORMAL&gt;<br />
&lt;NORMAL&gt;* Glyph of Angry  Thoughts - This ability increases the hate you generate by  30%.&lt;/NORMAL&gt;<br />
&lt;NORMAL&gt;* Glyph of Courage - This ability increases many forms  of damage.&lt;/NORMAL&gt;<br />
&lt;NORMAL&gt;- There are now additional ranks of the AA  &quot;Mastery of the Past&quot;. Ranks 4 through 9 will allow you to increase the maximum  level of spells that are immune to fizzling to the following levels: 61, 63, 65,  66, 68, 70. Note that the new Mastery of the Past AAs are tied to the level cap  increase expansions. Ranks 4, 5 and 6 are Omens of War AAs and Ranks 7, 8 and 9  are Serpent Spine AAs.&lt;/NORMAL&gt;<br />
&lt;NORMAL&gt;- Added Mastery of the Past to all  casting classes which did not have the AA previously.&lt;/NORMAL&gt;<br />
&lt;NORMAL&gt;-  Corrected issues with Touch of the Cursed in certain  instances.&lt;/NORMAL&gt;<br />
&lt;NORMAL&gt;- Spell Casting Deftness, Quick Damage, and Quick  Buff now work on spells with a minimum casting time of 3 seconds instead of 4  seconds so they are consistent with how spell casting foci  work.&lt;/NORMAL&gt;<br />
&lt;NORMAL&gt;- Alternate Abilities that are interrupted by player  death will now have their timers reset appropriately.  &lt;/NORMAL&gt;<br />
&lt;NORMAL&gt;&lt;/NORMAL&gt;<br />
&lt;NORMAL&gt;&lt;/NORMAL&gt;<br />
&lt;NORMAL&gt;*** Zones  ***&lt;/NORMAL&gt;<br />
&lt;NORMAL&gt;&lt;/NORMAL&gt;<br />
&lt;NORMAL&gt;- Misty Thicket Revamp: Halflings  across the world of Norrath rejoice as the hills of Misty Thicket flourish into  a new paradise.&lt;/NORMAL&gt;<br />
&lt;NORMAL&gt;- Buffs will no longer count down while you  are in the Guild Lobby.&lt;/NORMAL&gt;<br />
&lt;NORMAL&gt;- The entry orb into Solteris now  allows 85/15 entry into the zone.&lt;/NORMAL&gt;<br />
&lt;NORMAL&gt;- The Kerra Catfish,  thought to recently be extinct, have been found again and are breeding  strongly.&lt;/NORMAL&gt;<br />
&lt;NORMAL&gt;- Characters should no longer get stuck in the  geometry when Level of Detail is set to minimum in The Buried Sea  zone.&lt;/NORMAL&gt;<br />
&lt;NORMAL&gt;- The Ghost's Vengeance spell will no longer cause the  Ghost, Guardian of Razorthorn event to crash.&lt;/NORMAL&gt;<br />
&lt;NORMAL&gt;- The Atlas  entry for Ocean of Tears should now point to the new map.&lt;/NORMAL&gt;<br />
&lt;NORMAL&gt;-  Moved one of the fights with King Odeen away from the hot springs. Hopefully  this will improve performance for some players. Also reduced the number of NPCs  in the zone by about one  third.&lt;/NORMAL&gt;<br />
&lt;NORMAL&gt;&lt;/NORMAL&gt;<br />
&lt;NORMAL&gt;&lt;/NORMAL&gt;<br />
&lt;NORMAL&gt;***  Miscellaneous ***&lt;/NORMAL&gt;<br />
&lt;NORMAL&gt;&lt;/NORMAL&gt;<br />
&lt;NORMAL&gt;- A long and  outstanding projectile weapon problem has been fixed. Previously, if you shot an  arrow or a projectile spell such as a firebolt, the visual representation of the  projectile would actually hit its target after the player was notified of the  hit. Now it is syncronized such that the output to the player's chat window is  appropriately updated with the projectile hit information when the visual  representation of the projectile actually hits its target.&lt;/NORMAL&gt;<br />
&lt;NORMAL&gt;-  The /who command should now process quicker.&lt;/NORMAL&gt;<br />
&lt;NORMAL&gt;- The Tip  Window for Dragons of Norrath merchants should now show  correctly.&lt;/NORMAL&gt;<br />
&lt;NORMAL&gt;- Solvents that destroy augments now display a  destroy message instead of safely remove message.&lt;/NORMAL&gt;<br />
&lt;NORMAL&gt;- Drakkin  should now receive the level up messages directing them to new zones at level  20, 25, and 30.&lt;/NORMAL&gt;<br />
&lt;NORMAL&gt;- /melody now terminates for bards when they  get silenced. They should no longer get spammed with &quot;You can't cast now,  because you are silenced&quot; messages.&lt;/NORMAL&gt;<br />
&lt;NORMAL&gt;- Loot permissions are  now passed as part of corpse messages and are updated to the world when loot  permissions are changed except if a corpse is ported to another  zone.&lt;/NORMAL&gt;<br />
&lt;NORMAL&gt;- If a merchant has no items to sell, it will now use  the welcome that contains no item names.&lt;/NORMAL&gt;<br />
&lt;NORMAL&gt;- Armor should no  longer disappear after using illusions.&lt;/NORMAL&gt;<br />
&lt;NORMAL&gt;- Updating the price  of an item without changing the price will no longer increment item count in the  bazaar search.&lt;/NORMAL&gt;<br />
&lt;NORMAL&gt;- After attempting to invite a player that  does not exist or is not logged in, an error &quot;Player soandso was not found.&quot; is  now displayed in red text.&lt;/NORMAL&gt;<br />
&lt;NORMAL&gt;- The Link All button will now  wrap links onto the following chat line. This will allow a list of items spread  over multiple lines to be sent over chat channels. If the amount of text is long  enough that a link can't fit on the line without exceeding the text limit, only  the links that fit will be shown.&lt;/NORMAL&gt;<br />
&lt;NORMAL&gt;- You can drag corpses  through teleporters once again.&lt;/NORMAL&gt;<br />
&lt;NORMAL&gt;- When auto attacking an  NPC, characters will no longer lose a fraction of a second from the delay on  each swing.&lt;/NORMAL&gt;<br />
&lt;NORMAL&gt;- Faction losses/gains while shrouded (not in a  monster mission) will now affect your main character  appropriately.&lt;/NORMAL&gt;<br />
&lt;NORMAL&gt;- Players that camp out on a boat and use the  Return Home button should now get sent back to their home  city.&lt;/NORMAL&gt;<br />
&lt;NORMAL&gt;- Reduced the amount of push generated by melee-based  attacks.&lt;/NORMAL&gt;<br />
&lt;NORMAL&gt;- Corrected the error that was causing some items  to incorrectly display Damage Shield  Mitigation.&lt;/NORMAL&gt;<br />
&lt;NORMAL&gt;&lt;/NORMAL&gt;<br />
&lt;NORMAL&gt;&lt;/NORMAL&gt;<br />
&lt;NORMAL&gt;***  User Interface Changes ***&lt;/NORMAL&gt;<br />
&lt;NORMAL&gt;&lt;/NORMAL&gt;<br />
&lt;NORMAL&gt;- A problem  has been addressed and fixed regarding full screen mode. Previously, users would  experience &quot;bleed through&quot; where background applications would sometimes draw  through the EverQuest window in full screen mode, and where the mouse cursor  might periodically change to the background application's mouse cursor. This  mouse issue appears to have been fixed, and the &quot;bleed through&quot; of background  application drawing has been significantly reduced.&lt;/NORMAL&gt;<br />
&lt;NORMAL&gt;- GUI  handling of containers with an odd number of slots has been changed. The last  slot will be aligned with the container icon if it exists. This could affect  some custom UI skins.&lt;/NORMAL&gt;<br />
&lt;NORMAL&gt;- Using the escape key to close the  petition window should no longer cause a crash to desktop.&lt;/NORMAL&gt;<br />
&lt;NORMAL&gt;-  Froglok characters should now appear with their selected look after character  creation.&lt;/NORMAL&gt;<br />
&lt;NORMAL&gt;&lt;/NORMAL&gt;<br />
&lt;NORMAL&gt;- Changed  -&lt;/NORMAL&gt;<br />
&lt;NORMAL&gt;&lt;/NORMAL&gt;<br />
&lt;NORMAL&gt;EQUI_PotionBeltWnd.xml&lt;/NORMAL&gt;<br />
&lt;NORMAL&gt;EQUI_AAWindow.xml&lt;/NORMAL&gt;<br />
&lt;NORMAL&gt;EQUI_ItemDisplay.xml&lt;/NORMAL&gt;<br />
&lt;NORMAL&gt;EQUI_OptionsWindow.xml&lt;/NORMAL&gt;<br />
&lt;NORMAL&gt;EQUI_DynamicZoneWnd.xml&lt;/NORMAL&gt;<br />
&lt;NORMAL&gt;&lt;/NORMAL&gt;<br />
&lt;NORMAL&gt;&lt;/NORMAL&gt;<br />
&lt;NORMAL&gt;***  Previously Updated ***&lt;/NORMAL&gt;<br />
&lt;NORMAL&gt;&lt;/NORMAL&gt;<br />
&lt;NORMAL&gt;- Lowered the  hit point value for all of the adds spawned in the mission &quot;Counter Attack&quot; in  Zhisza.&lt;/NORMAL&gt;<br />
&lt;NORMAL&gt;- Reduced the hit points of several of the adds in  the mission &quot;Confront Emperor  Vaakiszh.&quot;&lt;/NORMAL&gt;<br />
&lt;NORMAL&gt;&lt;/NORMAL&gt;<br />
&lt;NORMAL&gt;&lt;/NORMAL&gt;<br />
&lt;NORMAL&gt;&lt;/NORMAL&gt;<br />
&lt;NORMAL&gt;&lt;/NORMAL&gt;<br />
&lt;NORMAL&gt;-  The EverQuest Team&lt;/NORMAL&gt;<br />
&lt;NORMAL&gt;&lt;/NORMAL&gt;<br />
