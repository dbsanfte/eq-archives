 <br />
For the last month or so, I can't find a single mob that it sticks too - I always get the &quot;does not meet requirements&quot; message.<br />
 <br />
What is the point of this spell? What are the requirements? (Spell description says level 75 or less, and of course I've tried those).<br />

 <br />
What's it take to make this land? Do Shamman's need to cast some other debuff first? Turn the mob into animal so we can turn them into Plant???<br />
 <br />
Or is it just we need to be grouped with them?<br />
 <br />
No Druids in my guild even bother memming this anymore, please, please, tell me what it's good for???<br />

This seems very sad to have yet another a wasted spell line like this. Does anyone know if SOE plans to relax the requirements for this? Seems like a nice debuff, I mean if it actually worked on anything...</div></div><hr />

 <br />
I believe if a shm lands feralize before you cast vines it blocks it the same way vines blocks itself after wearing off.  I'm not 100% on that one though.<br />
 <br />
Otherwise it used to land on icefall mobs and instanced hive spiders.  After a short whiel I gave up on it before getting to really test it out much more.</div></div><hr />

Fix it, for god's sake, and implement those cut spells like you said you were going to.  And replace the new regen with something useful, like you said you were going to...</div></div><hr />

I know that it has it's problems, and personally, I don't know what I would get rid of in my current spell line up to use it, but I said I would look into it.  <br />

The biggest is that on a raid mob, it hits once, wears off and can't be overwritten/reapplied  I say raid mob because typically trash mobs would die quick enough that the spell duration would never be exceeded.</div></div><hr />

The mages in my guild love it. Not to mention I have been able to get a crit nuke for 9.3k using it. :) <br />

I can get this spell to land on all the mobs in The Steppes. I load it and if it dont stick then I just unmem it.<br />

Icefall goblins it sticks on ....now if it wears off yes bummer but I group with Wizard 98% of the time and he told me last nite for sure the dd crits and regular hits were higher and my own dd was higher on equinox rk 2 ....also stick on oozes in Sunder same thing.....so it might not be helpul on raids but for the more casual player who groups with mages and wizards it owns......plus I read on the SK board that the Black Roots in Direwind it works on which is nice exp too (sk/druid combo using their plant spells).<br />
 <br />
I am sorry it doesn't help raiders much but I will be using all the time now (my evening group even has an extra wizard so its even more important for us to get in on mobs)<br />

<br />
Hearing what people have been saying, I'll have to try it some more.  Maybe I haven't tried it enough.  Either that or it only works on blue mobs or something.  I had the same problem with our stun before I learned it only works on level 75 and below mobs.<br />
<br />
Which makes this spell nice for casual players but useless for anyone who plays in areas like Ashengate.<br />
<br />
P.S. I just noticed this:<br />
(Spell description says level 75 or less, and of course I've tried those).<br />
<br />
<br />
Bah.  Ever since they upped the levels on trash mobs we have been screwed.<br />
<br />
Remember back in the day when you could have all your spells work on trash mobs?  Harmony and stun would work and you could nuke trash without having to debuff first?<br />
<br />
Frankly, the higher level you get in EQ, the less powerful you become.  It sucks.  Your spells get longer cast times and work on fewer mobs.  I would think that as you become higher level you should become more powerful, not less.  I mean what are we working for?</div></div><hr />

<br />
And if so, then does the shaman Feralize permanently turn a mob into an animal too?  That could actually be helpful!</div></div><hr />

<br />
Actually it switches to a bodytype which is not plant, nor animal, Which prevents it from landing a second time.  Prathun finally acknowledged the bug, and forwarded it to code.<br />
<br />
You can test this by changing an animal into a Plant with Skin to Vines, charming it with Beguile Plant, and once skin to vines wears off, being unable to charm it with either spell.<br />

 Based on feedback from the Druid community, Wildskin and Blessing of the Wild have been replaced on a one-for-one basis with Blistering Sunray and Sunscorch.  The old spells will be replaced with the new ones.<br />
 Based on feedback from the Cleric community, Rectitude and Cure Corruption have been replaced with Blessing of Purpose and Ward of the Dauntless.  Rectitude was swapped on a one-for-one basis with Blessing of Purpose.  However, because Cure Corruption is used by multiple classes the spell could not be swapped directly with Ward of the Dauntless, so clerics can simply no longer use the Cure Corruption spell.  Turning in a Rank III spell rune while you have Cure Corruption Rank III scribed will result in a copy of Ward of the Dauntless Rank III and a return of the spell rune.  Aside from that, Cure Corruption can be deleted from the spell book.<br />
 The statistics on the items created by Summon Aenda&#8217;s Trinkets have been improved.<br />
 The number of &#8220;procs&#8221; that Steeltrap Jaws can fire before fading have been doubled.<br />

B) Im pretty sure people with 25% foci would want something much better than 30% foci when theres stuff out there with much better  than that. The spell is crap.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You have Skin to Vines Rank II.<br />
<br />
You cast Equionx Burn Rank II.<br />
<br />
We take 5% and divide by half, to get the average percent increase to damage, so we use 2.5%.<br />
<br />
So we take 2861 Damage - that of EBII and * it by 1.025 to get...2932, the result is STVII added 72~ damage to the nuke.<br />
<br />
Now, lets assume some Wizard comes along and casts Ethereal Conflagration Rk. II, which deals 7041 Damage.  A 2.5% increase means it delt 7217 Damage, which was an increase of 176 Damage.<br />
<br />
Does an extra 2.5% average help out? Sure.  Is it super awesome game breaking noticable?  Not so much.<br />

It may not make quite as much difference as some of the other debuffs but it's definitely worth casting.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Skin to Vines will add likely less then 1k extra damage, and that is assuming a caster heavy group - prior to most mob's death.<br />
<br />
On a Raid, the differance can be far more dramatic for sure.<br />

Even if I were just a normal group, the spell would still suck and still get memmed as often as I mem it now, which is never. The spell still doesn't do all of what it was told to us on TSS beta that it was supposed to do, and still has issues with being reapplied to mobs after it fades. The spell sucks. If you are keeping this memmed over other, much, MUCH more useful debuffs, you are doing something wrong.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Riverwinter</div><div class="date">01-19-2007, 05:12 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">One of our officers did the math, a chain casting nuker tossing 2K or 4K nukes will get effectively one to two extra casts worth of damage after three minutes. Multiply that across the raid and it's significant, but missing a heal and losing a caster while you are Feralizing and Vining defeats the damage bonus advantage.<br />
 <br />
We plan on using it during raids when group healing is not an issue, and we have time to put it up, after all of the important debuffs get laid on. <br />
 <br />
In a group, three mins is still a long time. One of the reasons that Swarm DoTs are inefficient for general tank/healer/DPS groups is because the mob should not last as long as the spell. Likewise, S2V is not something I'd typically use as a group spell, cept for it's advantages of mana efficiency with certain Necro and Shadowknight spells that target plant types. <br />
 <br />
So overall, S2V goes in the category of nice to have if you have a couple of Druids in the Raid, but it's not something that's going in my everyday spell line up.</div></div><hr />

You cannot multiply that across the whole raid, last I checked, not everyone gets fire based nukes.</div></div><hr />

I didn't say that it worked for all Nukes, just like I also didn't say it gives a bonus to melees using slashing weapons. Multiply that across the raid too.<br />
 <br />
Personally I don't like the spell. It's got issues. I've given an example of a plain and simple but effective strat for it's use. Others are finding uses for it too. Some people want that itty bitty bit more damage, it makes them feel good. Just like most people will take that 96 rez over a 90, even though the difference is just one blue mob.<br />
 <br />
I also did not say &quot;across the whole raid&quot; You've misquoted me to promote your personal agenda, which is just to prove that the spell is totally useless. It isn't totally useless, it's just not what you want it to be.</div></div><hr />

Cast this just before the tank charges in and tell the wizard(s) to start blazing away. Wait for the tank to have good agro, of course:wiggle: .Other than that.....well everyone has their own personal preferences, I guess. Personally I find it a waste of a spell gem in any group situation. 300 mana cost? Why not just add another dot? It will do more damage in 30 seconds than this will in it's entire duration, regardless of if there is a wizard present or not. Not that big of an issue though, as it has it's uses, just not many.</div></div><hr />

The slashing bonus has never been on the spell since it went live, and in fact, I'm not even sure it was ever actually put on it during beta.</div></div><hr />
