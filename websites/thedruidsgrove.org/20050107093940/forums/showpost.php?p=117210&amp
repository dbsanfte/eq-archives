		<div>Ok, where to begin. This was a total 180 from all other experiences I have had with Sony. IMO, they are scared. As Chris, the EQ project manager, said to me in private, this is the first time when people leave, they have an alternative of somewhere else to go, in their opinion.<br />
<br />
The event was extravagant. They flew us all in, had free beer on the bus on the way to the game and hotel, everything in the hotel was free, meals, room service, the bar, movies, long distance, internet access, everything. They took us to the Padre game where we had the most expensive seats and even had the billboard welcome us during the 6th inning. We came back from the game to find a gift packet in our room with a Zboard Gaming Keyboard with EQ overlay and a bunch of other cool gifts, including a free CD key of Omens of War. Don't be too jealous of me =). <br />
<br />
The next day we took a bus to SOE after breakfast with the developers where they had a tent set up in the parking lot for a meeting. Smedley opened up with a speech that began. GoD was our biggest f-up yet, we are sorry and vow never to make that mistake again. Then the guy over GoD got up and apologized and said hate me. It's my fault and it will never happen again. They then answered a bunch of questions about various things, before breaking us up into tour groups. Smedley led my group and we went first to customer service where we toured the facility and walked around looking over GMs shoulders as they helped petitions. They explained how they have just instituted new software that should speed up customer service - we basically said we would believe it when we see it. There was a board up that said 55,355 people were playing EQ, 2,912 in Planetside and 35,000 something in SWG. <br />
<br />
We then went to Ops where we saw the guys who reboot the server before touring the server room. For you geek types, EQ is on Windows NT from 8 years ago while EQ2 and all the other games are on Linux. <br />
<br />
The server room is cool. Old servers were about 2 1/2 racks currently. Each server handles around 5 zones and with 300 zones in game, its cumbersome. They are currently installing Bladestrike servers which will shrink EQ servers down a ton. Only one server is currently on that now. They also have a backup diesel generator to keep the game going during power outages. Some of the servers are in a remote location so that if they go down someone has to drive over to that location to reboot them. The Bladestrikes will solve that issue.<br />
<br />
Next we went to the developers area. They had all the Epic artwork on the wall. One senior animator was working on a Chimera model that rocked and he showed us some of the Omens of War models. Smedley mentioned to us that they are going to start outsourcing a lot of the artwork so that they can concentrate more on content rather than art, as that takes up the bulk of their time.<br />
<br />
We also saw the developer's schedule. One of them is doing the druid epic tuning next week, another is working on the guild tribute system for OOW. They also are adding a new AA structure to the backbone which will make it so that they can add AAs much much easier. That just got finished so we should expect new AAs before OOW that are free.<br />
<br />
After that we broke off into 10-15 man groups for development discussions. They said who wants to go first and I opened up and said my peace first. Smedley, Travis (designed the final zone of GoD and Yxtta (who said he would change the BiC quest pieces off the primals), Shaun Lord (a developer), and Alan (brenlo) were in our group.<br />
<br />
I said first thing they need to fix is making it so a guild can raid together. They seemed to like my 85/15 rule with keys dropping off the end game bosses. They also mentioned wanting to create the guild as an identity. I explained that people come back and can't raid with the guild so they lose interest and disappear and they said they will fix this somehow guaranteed. Their precise way of doing it will be worked out in the future.<br />
<br />
I also mentioned with the lvl 70 cap they need to instance time cause it will be a nightmare. Smedley said, Can that be done to the developers.  They said yes, he said ok.  We will look into it.  Lots of other ideas happened as well.  Some they liked, some they didn't.  I suggested epic mount quests like dragons and underwater mounts, but they said they have issues with the global file.  They also said they can't fly cause of the geometry of the engine.  Brenlo pushed for halfling bards.<br />
<br />
After that we did lunch, I did the EQ2 demo instead. EQ2 is eye candy, wood elf girls have like 20 different hair models, even choosing flowers or butterflys in their hair. Personally, I wasn't impressed.  You make furniture and stuff although the mirror was really cool in your house.  It actually worked and had reflections as well.<br />
<br />
Back to customer service sessions where they explained their new customer service plan.  I asked if they were swamped and he said yes.  Average resolve time is like 33 hours but their new system will shrink that hopefully.  They also said they are instituting new software which will speed that up. There is a red flag that pops up on an account that gets over a certain amount of plat or has a lot of plat pass through it. They wouldn't give us the exact numbers for obvious reasons. These accounts are checked to see if they are legit. One thing to note is that you no longer have to stay online to get a petition answered. They are saved now as instant messages.<br />
<br />
Next another development meeting, this time Chris the project manager and Hobart, one of the head programmers, replaced Smedley and Travis.<br />
<br />
Hobart asked us if we would be interested in a DKP-type table next to the guild management tool that would allow us to keep track of attendance for everyone automatically. Everyone said yes. They asked us if we wanted housing. Most people said no. I suggested to Chris a guild banker where you could turn in items and withdraw tradeskill stuff and such. He liked that idea. They want to add a trophy house for guilds which shows which mobs each guild has killed. Lots of other ideas went around as well.<br />
<br />
After that we went to dinner at a bar where practically everyone but me got plastered and they handed out a paper with a lot of immediate fixes and a lot of promises to look at other suggestions.  <br />
<br />
Almost everyone came out of there very happy, including me, which was suprising as I was pretty cynical heading in. <br />
<br />
Other items of note:<br />
<br />
They promised to not go up and down with raid sizes.<br />
<br />
 I talked to a dev who went through an Ikkinz trial last week with a paladin tanking. After the paladin went splat, he looked into it. He told me he spent the last four days retuning them so a paladin can tank it.<br />
<br />
They said they are changing spell drops so that you can quest every one. They will still drop randomly but they are adding a quest for each individual spell. One good suggestion someone made that they liked is making it so that in instanced zones, only spells of those present can drop.<br />
<br />
New melee animations and new player models will be coming out by the end of the year. The DX9 collision crap was done cause they upgraded the engine so they can make better looking zones. They are also mentioned hiring an outside company to go back and redo all the old zones to bring them up to the new engine.<br />
<br />
They are adding solo LDON expeditions for every class so that people who only have an hour can log on and do experience immediately. <br />
<br />
They are considering adding a whole other line of abilities for clerics, like making them nuke for 6k on undead or stuff or make them turn into a warriortype when fighting undead so that more people will play clerics, but they had no definitive answers for that.<br />
<br />
One of the things people said is they want expansions to use old lore, we don't need new aliens and stuff, building storylines and flush out the current lore. They said ok.<br />
<br />
Smedley asked us if we wanted to see numbers of mana and experience and he said they would consider adding it as an option you can turn on.  They also said they would add it so you can see how much mana each person in the group has.<br />
<br />
They admitted this summit should have happened two years ago and they are now learning that they need more interaction with the players since we are the real power. They said they want to start doing a summit like this every six months or so. Another big fubar they mentioned is Uqua was finished. The problem is that it was designed for level 70. Originally they planned on adding two levels on the 5th anniversary of EQ and then 3 more in OOW. The developers then killed this idea. They said future expansions will have every encounter tuned by uber guilds rather than beta buffed randoms so they are ready when the expansion goes live.<br />
<br />
They admitted LoY was a rush job. One thing they are doing is adding a portal in PoK to LoY. That's how rushed it was, it didn't even get a portal (an obvious bug). <br />
<br />
Also one thing to note is that Omens of War only has one flagged zone, the rest is like Kunark where everyone can go everywhere.<br />
<br />
As far as GM events, they will be coming back. Test of Tactics, Best of the Best and other events will happen again for sure. They also are coming up with a more advanced Guild War system, including a specific zone for it. Hobart also mentioned a complete makeover of it with all kinds of events. I told him about the one we did with EOD where we had to kill the other guys GM, and he said "regicide, that's one I hadn't thought of, will make sure it gets in."<br />
<br />
They asked alot of opinions. A company has contacted Sony about developing a Magic The Gathering-type card game for EQ and since I was wearing a MTG shirt on Smedley asked my opinion. The common cards will be bought at vendors and rare cards will drop off of different mobs. This game can be played against people while in EQ waiting for raids and such.<br />
<br />
One suggestion Rich from Talisman made that they liked was a raid leader being able to move groups around from the raid window.  Murphy from BOTS had a good suggestion to combine the expedition and raid window so that you can see who logged without quitting expeditions.<br />
<br />
There was a ton more suggestions made and I thought it was worthwhile.    They seemed genuine anyway.<br />
<br />
