<br />
(05-31) 18:04 PDT Wichita, Kan. (AP) --<br />
<br />
Dr. George Tiller, one of the nation's few providers of late-term abortions despite decades of protests and attacks, was shot and killed Sunday in a church where he was serving as an usher.<br />
<br />
The gunman fled, but a 51-year-old suspect was detained some 170 miles away in suburban Kansas City three hours after the shooting, Wichita Deputy Police Chief Tom Stolz said.<br />
<br />
Long a focus of national anti-abortion groups, including a summer-long protest in 1991, Tiller was shot in the foyer of Reformation Lutheran Church. Tiller's attorney, Dan Monnat, said Tiller's wife, Jeanne, was in the choir at the time.<br />
<br />
Tiller's Women's Health Care Services clinic is one of just three in the nation where abortions are performed after the 21st week of pregnancy. The clinic was heavily fortified and Tiller often traveled with a bodyguard, but Stolz said there was no indication of security at the church Sunday.<br />
<br />
Tiller had in the past endured threats and violence. A protester shot Tiller in both arms in 1993, and his clinic was bombed in 1985. More recently, Monnat said Tiller had asked federal prosecutors to step up investigations of vandalism and other threats against the clinic out of fear that the incidents were increasing and that Tiller's safety was in jeopardy. Stolz, however, said police knew of no threats connected to the shooting.<br />
<br />
In early May, Tiller had asked the FBI to investigate vandalism at his clinic, including cut wires to surveillance cameras and damage to the roof that sent rainwater pouring into the building.<br />
<br />
In 1991, the Summer of Mercy protests organized by Operation Rescue drew thousands of anti-abortion activists to this city for demonstrations marked by civil disobedience and mass arrests.<br />
<br />
Tiller's clinic is fortified with bulletproof glass, and Tiller hired a private security team to protect the facility. Once outside the clinic, Tiller was routinely accompanied by a bodyguard.<br />
<br />
At a recent trial, he told jurors that he and his family have suffered years of harassment and threats and that he knew he was a target of anti-abortion protesters.<br />
<br />
Federal marshals protected Tiller during the 1991 Summer of Mercy protests, and he was protected again between 1994 and 1998 after another abortion provider was assassinated and federal authorities reported finding Tiller's name on an assassination list.If it were a Muslim extremist terrorist shooting a Christian, I bet half the federal government would be on the case.<br />
<br />
Funny how all those extremist Christian groups aren't labeled terrorists, even though they are far more dangerous to the general public than any Muslim will ever be.<br />
<br />
Yeah I know, I'm preaching to the choir here.</div></div><hr />

We had a relatively quiet 8 years from the right wing extremist crazies.  I think they were pretty content during the Bush years.  But now Limbaugh and the rest have a real target to go after, like they did with Clinton, and they're inflaming their listeners to acts of violence.  Not saying they're responsible, because some portion of their audience probably tends to act out violently anyway but this is how they show their general discontentment with things, by lashing out with explosives and guns.<br />
<br />
Frankly, I like the way liberals lash out better.  They go sit in trees for months on end and blockade ships and bring law suits.<br />
<br />
Hmmm... in the 60's it was the lefties that were the violent ones... well, except for the cops.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Three days after the killing of Kansas physician George Tiller, who performed late-term abortions, Fox News commentator Bill O'Reilly referred to Tiller the same way he had for years: &quot;Dr. Killer.&quot; As in &quot;Tiller the baby killer.&quot;<br />
<br />
O'Reilly says he was merely &quot;reporting&quot; what others had called Tiller. But O'Reilly often failed to say that he was &quot;reporting&quot; when using the word.<br />
<br />
The comments have sparked outrage from experts in ethics and hate speech who say the TV show host's use of such strong words may have played a role in Tiller's slaying last Sunday.</div></div><hr />

Fox News, also as of late has been joking of killing Obama. As if oh well, we haven't had a good political murder of a politcal leader in the United States in a few years.

Some of their rhetoric certainly characterizes Obama (through innuendo and selective editing of his quotes) as someone who is aggressively seeking to destroy America.  If a viewer was dumb enough to believe their crap and considered themselves to be patriotic, isn't it inevitable that the thought of killing Obama would cross their minds?<br />
<br />
Even some of their own think that it's getting out of hand...<br />

By PAUL KRUGMAN<br />

<br />
Back in April, there was a huge fuss over an internal report by the Department of Homeland Security warning that current conditions resemble those in the early 1990s — a time marked by an upsurge of right-wing extremism that culminated in the Oklahoma City bombing. <br />
<br />
Conservatives were outraged. The chairman of the Republican National Committee denounced the report as an attempt to “segment out conservatives in this country who have a different philosophy or view from this administration” and label them as terrorists. <br />
<br />
But with the murder of Dr. George Tiller by an anti-abortion fanatic, closely followed by a shooting by a white supremacist at the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum, the analysis looks prescient. <br />

Must be something about that mental state that finds it attractive.  I'm not saying all Republican's are paranoid, but it certainly seems to attract them.<br />
<br />
Actually, I will go so far as to say I think there's a low level of paranoia in most Republicans that you don't find in Democrats.   It manifests as a distrust of government, hawkish belligerence towards other nations and often times intolerance and distrust of people with differing values, races and religions.</div></div><hr />

One could argue, that many of the traditional ideologies never existed in the format it is being presented. This is one of the reasons homosexuality is such an issue, as it breaks the &quot;tradition&quot; of male and female marriage, as well as issues such as homosexuals in the military. Which is ironic considering the ideology of democracy is derived from ancient Greece, namely Sparta. Sparta was prone to homoerotic behaviors both militarily as well civic. They got along just fine for awhile before being eventually conquered. Hence, a reason I have a good laugh or two at their expense as they seek to preserve the tradition of democracy and so on.<br />
<br />
There are many other examples of this behavior easily verified by basic observations, backed up with historical facts, that are often ignored, for traditional ideologies with a slight spin, moderate spin, major spin on the facts of those ideas to support a viewpoint, if, not outright ignored.</div></div><hr />

So yes, they are terrorists, even though only a minority are violent terrorists like the ones mentioned in this thread.<br />
<br />
And Fox News knows full well that they're advocating terrorism.  For every &quot;let's kill Obama&quot; joke, I bet their ratings among rednecks in the South soar.

<br />
But they can say it indirectly, invite guests who &quot;accidentally&quot; let it slip, and manipulate the facts to appeal to the hate- and fear-mongers that are their viewers.<br />
<br />
The mainstream media certainly aren't saints in this regard, but Fox News takes it to a whole new level.  A dangerous level that will likely incite more violence by extremists.</div></div><hr />

Talk show hosts and comedians don't have an ethical responsibility to report the truth.  Journalists do.  Especially ones that go by the motto &quot;fair and balanced&quot; (yes, it is right there on the Fox News website, near the logo).<br />

<br />
<br />
I have no idea how much homosexuality was allowed and/or predominant in Sparta (*), but democracy (for very very! loose definitions of demos) was the government of choice in Athens.<br />
<br />
The demos part was limited only to men of sufficient age and wealth (**) so they could devote themselves full time to government. The unique (and democratic) part of it was that everybody who attained those qualifications had equal say. It still amounted to 2 or 3 pct of the population, same as everywhere else, but that fraction of the population was not determined by heriditary status nor by military might.<br />
<br />
<br />
Eri<br />
(* Sparta was a typical monarchy, where the only measure of worth was through its military. Because so many men were in the army they had a much higher percentage of slaves than other city states, and this led to them needing that army to keep the slaves suppressed. This also led to them being unable to field a prolongued war for fear of slave rebellions back home. Another interesting Sparta trivia is that the early English boarding schools were modeled after the romantic ideas of what raising young boys in Sparta must have been like).<br />
(** women, slaves, young men and everybody who had to work for a living need not apply. Also, politics were a dangerous arena and losing your powerbase with the other politicians could see you banished from your city, which was a lot more serious then than it would be now).</div></div><hr />

<br />
Sparta was rather interesting, something called lacnophilia or something or other, I might have to look it up. The Spartans evolved several times, as while it is true they had monarchs, at times those monarchs often held no political power and were merely Generals on the battlefield, accompanied by 2 or so ephors. Hence where alot of the constitionals of Sparta come into play, as it became, with modifications to structure of other constitutions in generally western societies. But, they easily compare to many of the modern aspects to western societies.<br />
