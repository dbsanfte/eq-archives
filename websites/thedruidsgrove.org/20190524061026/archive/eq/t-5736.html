Speaking in general that is, although LDoN might be a good way to imagine how it would turn out.<br />
<br />
I think Shaman would rank in at no. 1 with slows, stackable dots, heals, and decent pets.<br />
<br />
Bards would probably rock, as well as SK's.<br />
<br />
Mages would probably have a good go at it, with 6 uber pets equaling 12 damage dealers.<br />
<br />
Which would be the worst group?<br />
Warriors would probably be pretty sucky.  Rangers would do okay, I think.  Clerics would probably have a slow time at it, not hard, but slow.<br />
<br />
What do you think?</div></div><hr />

Beastlords would be better than shaman.  Their slow may not be as good as the shaman slow, but, it's not far off.  Add to that the Killer Pets they get and it's no contest.</div></div><hr />

If the group could only use their own buffs, then mana regen would suffer horribly for some classes, like Druids.<br />

Wizards might be good, if they all have the epic rune, they could theoretically burn stuff down and ping pong/rune so that healing would't be an issue :D <br />
<br />
And yeah, Necro's would definately pwn in the right setting.  Stackable dots, lifeburn every so often, heals (of sorts), very decent pets, harmshield, undead spells galore.</div></div><hr />

a group of beasts would just own.... there was a thread on their forums a while back where they did this.<br />
<br />
clerics would be slow<br />
<br />
chanters would be... kinda slow, depending on how they do things, and what is charmed.<br />
<br />
mages would own, see beasts, but things would go down faster, with more mana used, maybe some downtime. <br />
<br />
bards... wheres the dps? =P<br />
<br />
shamans dont fair so well on multiple single mobs, but one huge targets they own, so i dont think they would do that great, maybe normal group speed?<br />
<br />
warriors *laughs*<br />
<br />
shadow knights and paladins would do farely well, SKs more so i think, but maybe not. get to the boss and all 6 harmtouches would be groovy tho =)<br />
<br />
druids would be ehh.... kinda slow maybe. Our nukes are only as good as mages, but we dont have ubar pets in front of us. dots take too long. /shrug its a mixed bag.<br />
<br />
necro's would pwn ****, period<br />
<br />
rangers would fare pretty well im thinking, one tanks while the other 5 bow, they all heal in between.<br />
<br />
monks might do alright.. maybe. be slow tho<br />

rogues would have to get... inventive to say the least.<br />

<br />
Mages with their AA's can summon pets with like no mana costs. <br />
<br />
They deal most dmg, can tank a while till they are down. 6 Pets = ALLWAYS one pet allive till the other mages summoned a new one.<br />
<br />

It is true, 6 mages would probably put out the most damage, but they lack the overall utility.  If one thing go wrong with the six mage crew, they all die.  Necros can root, snare, mez and recover hit points and Feign Death.  They have the utlity to make it through the worst situations.</div></div><hr />

Heh.  The instant the 4th mage gets aggro (by attack pet, casting DD, or debuffing), the target will automatically ignore pet aggro.  With no reliable form of root (outside of the earth pet) and no ability to heal, six mages will turn into six corpses very fast.<br />
<br />
Necros, on the other hand, not only have pets, but have direct and over-time damage, root, snare, feign death, built-in mana regen, heal, mesmerize, res, and other utility spells.  And against undead, necros pretty much have it all, including slow.  A group of six necros would not only be very powerful in many different situations, but would also be self-sufficient, whereas the mages would be forced to seek PoK whores for KEI, buffs, resing, and what not.</div></div><hr />

Not true for summoned pets, at least the last time I checked.  Mobs only ignore _charmed_ pets when they have more than 4 things on the hate list.</div></div><hr />

They would be slower in melee unless they all summoned hammers but the main problem would be mana regen.  If all FT15+ capable it shouldnt be too much of a problem.   Pull a bunch,  6 hammers, PBAoEx6, 6x AoE heal.. repeat PBAoE or melee if needed.    they can kill 8 mobs pretty quick.   I know from experience that two druids, one wizzy, enc and 2 clerics make a heck of a PBAoE group so I think 6 clerics could pull it off. <br />
<br />
True they may not be the best group but don't underestimate them as a group dealing out damage.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Northerner</div><div class="date">11-27-2003, 06:25 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I thought about this one a little while given the present state of EQ and I am a little stumped.<br />
<br />
If no outside buffs are allowed, period, then I would lean towards 6 Shaman.  Mana regeneration is a non-issue.  CC is a non-issue and healing really is nothing to worry about.  The only control is damage output but a smart six-pack of Shaman will pull three to six and offtank (or selftank) while piling on the dots and such.  They would be suboptimal except that mana regeneration is so damn good.<br />
<br />
A nod would go to six Beastlords naturally and they might even be superior.  Against summoning Mobs they are a far better choice.  Still, although pet dps is far greater they are going to need to reclaim mana at some point, even with Paragon galore.  It's hard to say though, with Bst pets they could actually melee some (except perhaps the slower) and this could well be the better group.<br />
<br />
Outdoors, go with six Wizards or Druids.  Sure, mutiple-person quadding would be painful to coordinate but it still is going to work pretty well.  Mana regen (assuming no outside buffs) drops them down the pole a ways though.<br />
<br />
Another call might be the old six Necros or Mages.  Not interchangeable by any stretch, they still both boast amazing disposable pet dps and alternate skills that nest well together.  Six Necros was formidable before DoTs stacked, they should be fairly frightening now.<br />
<br />
Six Bards is an oddball one.  If one could coordinate six Bards for outdoor swarming/charm kites it would frankly be hilarious to see.  Even DoT kiting with six would be frightening.  Indoors though I would need to think dps would suffer in the end.<br />
<br />
Six Enchanters is curious.  If charmable mobs are in sufficent supply (a rarity indeed) then they are insanely potent.  Of course, so is a single enchanter though or a duo with a cleric and such.  Kind of a wildcard I guess.<br />
<br />
Six melee or hybrids is less fun.  Sure six paladins could do well but my presupposition of no outside buffs really wrecks all melee.  The only possible exception would be the briefly lived but entertaining six Warriors with Earthshakers and Rampage group.  That one would make one hell of an impressive kill before disbanding (or crashing the zone as happened in my one experiment in LDoN using a single warrior).<br />
<br />
Good fun game though, perhaps I'll think more on it.</div></div><hr />

Bards with Fungi tunics certainly...without it would require stacking heals, not sure if that works. If I could add one extra class I think a Druid. Druid could do DS, stack regen and make a main tank, heal, and evac. Bards dont get many Druid skills.<br />
<br />
1 Bard - pull &amp; basic CC / plus what skil allows<br />
2 Bard - Charm / Melee / Chant<br />
3 Bard - Heal / Haste / DS / Melee / Chant<br />
4 Bard - Slow / Debuff / Chant / Chant / Melee <br />
5 Bard Chant / Chant / Chant / Chant / Melee<br />
6 Bard Chant / Chant / Chant / Chant / Melee<br />
<br />
...but I dont know who stacking works for bards. Do chants and heals stack. Never had two bards in a group myself.<br />
<br />
Switch main tank duties as needed with aggro generating and aggro reducing songs.<br />
<br />
The more DPS needed just add more charms, or rotate a charmer or two as mana gets low,</div></div><hr />

All said, that's 12 very good melee, slow, a cast of paragon every 2.5 minutes, and everything else that comes in the BL package (DoTs, some DD, and light healing).<br />

True, I almost never use summoned pets and didn't realize that rule doesn't apply.<br />
<br />
However, I still wonder how a 6 mage group will deal with anything unexpected, when they have no real HP buffs or heals, no root, snare, or mesmerize, and not to mention no mana regen spells.  (Or does the &quot;six person group&quot; mean six people plus a billion buffs from different classes, and are we starting to count all sorts of exotic items?)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Where's the DPS someone said? Try about 800-1500 damage a tick, PBaoE on about 15-20 mobs.  Where's the healing? Try Wind of Marr + Nivs with a good lute, for about 90/tick regen.  Add PBaoE slow, PBaoE snare, and about 80DPS melee on top, and you are talking serious damage.<br />
<br />
Did this in velks a while back, clearing for a raid, pulled every spider in the zone, every single one, and killed all of them in less than a minute.<br />
<br />
Only problem is to keep DPS up, you need to pull a lot of mobs, and a lot of mobs, with only regen keeping the hp up on the group means you need to have a good deal of hitpoints, and going without virtue might give a bit of trouble.<br />
<br />
6 Level 65 bards, with full melee AA skills, and 4500hp-ish unbuffed or better would be able to clear a ldon normal in about 20 minutes tho.<br />
<br />
--Shamans--<br />
<br />
Shaman slow is the best, hands down.  65% isnt even close to being as good, neither is necro/chanter's 70%.  Add in AoE slow, Malo, and cripple, and you have a mob(s) so debuffed its almost not funny.  Shaman pets suck you say? Sure, they do, unbuffed....<br />
<br />
Level 61 Dog, with focus, feral avatar, AGL buff, Str buff (can stack if cast first), 60% haste, and 2 rusty weapons can do about 65 dps, which isnt too far off from other classes pets, tho shammy pets have far less hp, and tank far less well.  So buffed fully, a shammy pet can do some serious damage.<br />
<br />
Add in the ldon dots, which are plenty fast, a few nukes for 1k, and a few rain spells for a few thousand each, poison dots which are very fast too.  Plus, shaman can tank dang good, and have the fastest mana regen in the game, even while tanking, so there is no downtime.  <br />
<br />
Mages and beastlord would not have much time to med, with only pets holding aggro, as sitting would pull the mobs to them, if they sat relatively soon after a pull.  Necros would get owned rather fast on non-undead lacking slow and mez then.</div></div><hr />

I was there purely for Blessing of replen and dam shield.  They could have easily replaced me and not missed those.  Mobs died so fast.

You should remember that CiH clerics sport more hps and AC than most warriors on the server.  As a general rule, clerics aren't really afraid of death.  But being clerics, there really isn't a danger of anyone getting purple clubbed.  And if some of them have the cleric Time hammer, they won't need to heal at all (for those that don't know, the cleric hammer procs a lot and procs a group heal).<br />
