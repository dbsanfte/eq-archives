And her taking care of the mass genocide of turkeys for the traditional gluttony of the holiday season, yep......... check. While drinking her coffee, check, with her back turned check, and they made sure to pick that exact spot check. As 2 turkeys are being slaughtered.... check. With all the smack talk.... check. With how she is going to take care of all of us..... you gotcha.</div></div><hr />

<br />
And the angel of the Lord came unto me, <br />
snatching me up from my <br />
place of slumber, <br />
and took me on high, <br />
and higher still until we <br />
moved in the spaces betwixt the air itself. <br />
and he bore me unto a <br />
vast farmland of our own midwest, <br />
and as we descended cries of <br />
impending doom rose from the soil. <br />
one thousand, nay, a million <br />
voices full of fear. <br />
and terror possessed me then. <br />
and I begged, <br />
<br />
&quot;Angel of the Lord, what are these tortured screams?&quot; <br />
And the angel said unto me, <br />
&quot;These are the cries of the carrots, <br />
the cries of the carrots. <br />
You see, reverend Maynard, tomorrow is harvest day <br />
and to them it is the holocaust.&quot; <br />
And I sprang from my slumber drenched in sweat <br />
like the tears of one millions terrified brothers <br />
and roared, <br />
&quot;Hear me now, <br />
I have seen the light, <br />
they have a consciousness, <br />
they have a life, <br />
they have a soul. <br />
damn you! <br />
let the rabbits wear glasses, <br />
save our brothers...can I get an amen? <br />
can I get a hallelujah? thank you, Jesus. <br />
<br />
life feeds on life feeds on life feeds on life feeds on... <br />
this is necessary <br />
<br />
it was daylight when you woke up in your ditch. <br />
you looked up at your sky. <br />
that made blue be your color. <br />
you had your knife with you there too. <br />
when you stood up there was goo all over your clothes. <br />
your hands were sticky. <br />
you wiped them on your grass, <br />
so now your color was green. <br />
oh Lord, why did everything always have <br />
to keep changing like this? <br />
you were already getting nervous again. <br />
your head hurt and it rang when you stood up. <br />
your head was almost empty. <br />
it always hurt you when you woke up like this. <br />
you crawled up out of your ditch unto your gravel road <br />
and you began to walk <br />
and waited for the rest of your mind to come back to you. <br />
you could see the car parked far down the road <br />
and you walked toward it. <br />
if God is our father, you though, <br />
then Satan must be our cousin. <br />
why didn't anyone else understand these important things? <br />
when you got to your car, <br />
you tried all the doors, <br />
but they were locked. <br />
it was a red car and it was new. <br />
there was an expensive leather camera case lying on the seat. <br />
out across your field <br />
you could see two tiny people walking by your woods. <br />
you began to walk towards them. <br />
now red was your color and of course, <br />
those little people out there were yours too  <br />

It's like making a video of yourself giving food to a homeless guy to show what a nice guy you are, while another homeless guy starves to death in the background and you do nothing but smile.<br />

I wish more people hunted (humanely and sustainably), rather than giving money to the disgusting modern animal domestication industry.<br />

The only problem I have with Palin and hunting specifically is that she shoots endangered wolves and bears, simply because they are far better hunters, with their bare bodies, than she is with a gun.</div></div><hr />

The mother of the boy who knocked up Sarah Palin's 17 year old daughter gets arrested on charges, for laws which should not exist in the first place, and that denotes exactly what on Sarah Palin?<br />

I don't care if their teen kids f*ck.  In fact I think they should do it, and more often, as long as they don't do it irresponsibly (as they did) and stick me with the bill for their unwanted kid or treatment for their STDs.<br />
<br />
I also don't care if they get high (in the privacy of their own homes).<br />
<br />
But Sarah Palin and her Christian holier-than-thou allies care, railing against these &quot;sex offenders&quot; and pressing the idiotic &quot;war on drugs&quot;.  And all the while, they and their Christian families are the prime suspects, doing all these things.<br />
<br />
It's about hypocrisy, just like the turkey incident.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tudamorf</div><div class="date">01-08-2009, 01:52 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm just wondering, could Palin get any MORE clueless?<br />
<br />
http://news.yahoo.com/s/politico/20090108/pl_politico/17217Palin: Media goes easy on Kennedy<br />
<br />
Gov. Sarah Palin (R-Alaska) believes Caroline Kennedy is getting softer press treatment in her pursuit of the New York Senate seat than Palin did as the GOP vice presidential nominee because of Kennedy&#8217;s social class.<br />
<br />
&#8220;I&#8217;ve been interested to see how Caroline Kennedy will be handled and if she will be handled with kid gloves or if she will be under such a microscope,&#8221; Palin told conservative filmmaker John Ziegler during an interview Monday for his upcoming documentary film, &#8220;How Obama Got Elected.&#8221; Excerpts from the interview were posted on YouTube Wednesday evening.<br />
<br />
&#8220;It&#8217;s going to be interesting to see how that plays out and I think that as we watch that we will perhaps be able to prove that there is a class issue here also that was such a factor in the scrutiny of my candidacy versus, say, the scrutiny of what her candidacy may be.&#8221;<br />
<br />
Palin said she remains subject to unfair press coverage of her and her family.<br />
<br />
&#8220;Is it political? Is it sexism?&#8221; she asked. &#8220;What is it that drives someone to believe the worst and perpetuate the worst in terms of gossip and lies?&#8221;<br />
<br />
She observed that Katie Couric and Tina Fey have been &#8220;capitalizing on&#8221; and &#8220;exploiting&#8221; her.<br />
<br />
&#8220;I did see that Tina Fey was named entertainer of the year and Katie Couric&#8217;s ratings have risen,&#8221; she said. &#8220;And I know that a lot of people are capitalizing on, oh I don&#8217;t know, perhaps some exploiting that was done via me, my family, my administration. That&#8217;s a little bit perplexing, but it also says a great deal about our society.&#8221;<br />
<br />
The Alaska governor said that when she sees some of the coverage of her daughter Bristol especially &#8220;the momma grizzly rises up in me.&#8221;<br />
<br />
Looking back on the Couric interviews, Palin said she knew things were not going well after their first session and asked the McCain campaign to pull the plug on the remaining sit downs but insisted the campaign made her go through with the rest.<br />
<br />
&#8220;I knew it didn&#8217;t go well the first day, and then we gave her a couple of other segments after that. And my question to the campaign was, after it didn&#8217;t go well the first day, why were we going to go back for more?&#8221; she said. &#8220;Because of however it works in that upper echelon of power brokering in the media and with spokespersons, it was told to me that, yeah, we are going to go back for more. And going back for more was not a wise decision either.&#8221;<br />
<br />
Palin criticized Couric for the way CBS &#8220;spliced it together,&#8221; saying that &#8220;so many of the topics brought up were not portrayed as accurately as they could have, should have, been.&#8221;<br />
<br />
She also expressed frustration with Couric&#8217;s characterization of her since the interviews. After being shown a clip of Couric complaining to David Letterman that no post-election interviewer has asked Palin why she would not tell the CBS anchor what newspapers she reads, the Alaska governor responded: &#8220;Because, Katie, you&#8217;re not the center of everybody&#8217;s universe.&#8221;Caroline Kennedy just has no experience.<br />
<br />
But Sarah Palin is an outright joke.<br />
<br />
By the way, the daughter already gave birth, but I haven't heard of a wedding yet.  Doesn't the bible say that bastards go to hell and are excluded from the church for 10 generations?<br />
<br />
It's laughable that Palin can't see the irony in her own underage high school dropout daughter screwing another underage high school dropout (whose mother is an illegal drug dealer) without using birth control and having an unwanted pregnancy she can't abort for political/religious reasons.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Palin's points about the media?  Honestly, they were modestly tepid.  All things considered.<br />
<br />
<br />
It was nothing less of a 1000 person GGG bukkake scene that lasted 18 months.</div></div><hr />

<br />
(03-11) 16:42 PDT WASILLA, Alaska (AP) -- The engagement is off for the teenage daughter of Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin and the father of her baby. Levi Johnston told The Associated Press on Wednesday that he and Bristol Palin mutually decided &quot;a while ago&quot; to end their relationship. The 19-year-old Johnston declined to elaborate.So now when the political spotlight is off, the lie is revealed.  They were just two dumb high school dropout teens screwing irresponsibly, which is what it looked like from the beginning.<br />
<br />
The lying, hypocritical Christian bastards (literally, in this case) are exposed again.</div></div><hr />

<br />
&quot;It's just us not, me not being mature enough, or something, and having a kid and thinking ... it could be better — better for us to separate for a while,&quot; Johnston said.So he's mature enough to screw irresponsibly while underage, but not mature enough to man up and accept responsibility.<br />

(03-29) 10:48 PDT WASHINGTON (AP) --<br />
<br />
Sen. John McCain isn't committing to supporting his vice presidential pick, Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin, if she runs for president in 2012.<br />
<br />
McCain — the GOP's presidential nominee last year — says he wants to see who the other candidates are and what the situation might be.I hope Palin runs in 2012, and I bet, so does Obama.  It would take that party completely out of another election cycle, and drag down a whole bunch of their Congressmen in the process.</div></div><hr />

(04-03) 18:25 PDT Anchorage, Alaska (AP) --<br />
<br />
Police say Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin's sister-in-law is accused of breaking into the same home twice to steal money.<br />
<br />
Deputy Wasilla Police Chief Greg Wood says 35-year-old Diana Palin was arrested Thursday after she was confronted by the homeowner in the governor's hometown of Wasilla. She faces two counts of felony burglary and misdemeanor counts of criminal trespass and theft.<br />
<br />
Wood says tire tracks and shoe prints tied Palin to another break-in Tuesday in which $400 was taken. Police have not tied Palin to another burglary at the home last week.<br />
<br />
Governor spokeswoman Meghan Stapleton says Palin is the half sister of the governor's husband and the family has no comment.<br />

Unwed mother Bristol Palin is going to take part in a national campaign to help raise awareness for teen pregnancy prevention.<br />

The 18-year-old daughter of Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin has been appointed as a Teen Ambassador for The Candie's Foundation.<br />

Bristol Palin will participate in a town hall meeting Wednesday in New York.Note that the Candie's Foundation preaches abstinence, not real birth control.<br />

<br />
(06-12) 08:58 PDT New York (AP) --<br />
<br />
Sarah Palin says David Letterman owes an apology to young women across the country for his joke about her daughter.<br />
<br />
The Alaska governor appeared on NBC's &quot;Today&quot; show Friday, continuing a feud with the CBS &quot;Late Show&quot; funnyman over his joke earlier this week that Palin's daughter got &quot;knocked up&quot; by New York Yankee third baseman Alex Rodriguez during their recent trip to New York.<br />
<br />
Asked by Matt Lauer whether Letterman owed her daughter an apology, the former vice presidential candidate broadened it.<br />
<br />
&quot;I would like to see him apologize to young women across the country for contributing to kind of that thread that is throughout our culture that makes it sound like it is OK to talk about young girls in that way, where it's kind of OK, accepted and funny to talk about statutory rape,&quot; she said. &quot;It's not cool. It's not funny.&quot;<br />
<br />
Letterman has said his joke was about Palin's 18-year-old daughter Bristol, who is an unwed mother (no name was used). Problem was, the Alaska governor was traveling with 14-year-old Willow. Palin said it took Letterman time to think of the &quot;convenient excuse&quot; that he was talking about Bristol instead of Willow.<br />
<br />
Letterman said on his show Wednesday that he would &quot;never, ever make jokes about raping or having sex of any description with a 14-year-old girl.&quot; He said he was guilty of poor taste.<br />
<br />
Palin said Friday that it was time for people to rise up against Letterman's form of humor.<br />
<br />
&quot;No wonder young girls especially have such low self-esteem in America when we think it's funny for a so-called comedian to get away with such a remark as he did,&quot; she said. &quot;I don't think that's acceptable.&quot;Not to make this thread my personal anti-Palin blog, but here's some more Palin hypocrisy in action.<br />
<br />
Her underage daughter is irresponsible and promiscuous, and Palin lies about it for political gain.<br />
<br />
Now Letterman makes a joke that's totally fair game, and she complains about &quot;statutory rape&quot; (like her daughter and the &quot;fiancé&quot;), and women having low self-esteem (like girls getting pregnant at age 16 and dropping out of high school).<br />
<br />
And she wonders why she's the butt of most political jokes?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sorrian</div><div class="date">06-14-2009, 05:59 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Nobody should ever be used in a perverted sexual &quot;joke&quot; or any manner period, Tudamorf. Especially not children. They are most certainly NOT fair game. Short of murder or some other heinous act, I don't care who they are or what their children did. There are lines that you just don't cross. I know you have a hard time comprehending that, but I'll try to explain. You NEVER say anything derogatory about someone's mother, wife, or children. EVER.<br />
 <br />
What kind of twisted mentality must you have to believe it's ok, under ANY circumstance, to denigrate someone's child? You should be ashamed, but since you have no moral compass and your ethics only apply to republicans and christians you won't be. <br />

You're an idiot Tudamorf. I know that runs contrary to what you've always told yourself, but you really are. You have some mental dysfunction somewhere. You rationalize with irrational statements. You actually tried to argue that Palin's daughter, becoming pregnant by her high school boyfriend, somehow validated this joke about a middle-aged man impregnating one of the daughters. It doesn't matter which one, it isn't even close to the same thing. You've lost your mind! <br />
 <br />
Your defense of Letterman is dispicable. He knew exactly which girl he was talking about. Only a naive jackass believes otherwise.</div></div><hr />

Where were they when Rush Limbaugh announced that the Clintons “had a new dog in the White House” and then showed a picture of Chelsea Clinton?  IIRC, she was younger than 14 at the time.  Where were they when John McCain told his &quot;Why is Chelsea Clinton so ugly?&quot; / &quot;Because her father is Janet Reno.&quot; joke?   Oh, wait, I know where they were, they were laughing and telling the jokes to their friends.  Bunch of fvckign hypocrite douchebags.</div></div><hr />

(If a 15 year age difference makes it perverted, then John McCain is an even bigger pervert.)<br />
<br />
The key here, and in this entire thread, is the hypocrisy.  They defend the daughter when she's an irresponsible slut, then attack when someone calls her one.</div></div><hr />

The joke seems related as a dig towards Palin's abstinence only policy and the pregnancy of one of her underage daughters.<br />
<br />
quote&quot;Nobody should ever be used in a perverted sexual &quot;joke&quot; or any manner period&quot;<br />
<br />
Depends, many arts and entertainment result from such, like say American Pie series as an example. There was often a point to such humor, such as in the case of American Pie, learning and growing from their expriences sexually or otherwise as they transition into adulthood.  Wedding Crashers is another good one to look into. I believe Ron Jeremy has filmed a recent movie called One Eyed Monster, basic synapsis is Ron dies filming an adult movie, his penis runs off on a killing spree, it looks funny.<br />
<br />
Like I said the joke is more in line with what I said earlier, with Palin's abstinance only policy and her child who got pregnant.<br />
<br />
The general rule of whether it is socially acceptable to date or otherwise engage in sexual intercourse is half your age +7 years. A = age. A/2+7. In my case that would be 22. But, my own personel preference is above 23, but below 40. Pretty much, so the ladies I date have some time to goof around, finish education, find some jobs, etc. As below 23, I find the maturity level has a severe dropoff, which is understandable as women are coming into their own as a young woman, and that has some learning expriences that come with it. Above 40, I find it is more of a sexual relationship as often, it is just different interests from the generation gaps, so, neither one is very fulfilling in terms of long term relationships.<br />
<br />
Often, the slurs of cougaring and silverbacking come into play, as they are generally legal, just frowned upon socially.</div></div><hr />

The rest of your post is just as pathetic and easily dismantled, but I refuse to argue with you endlessly over this. You will never admit you're wrong no matter how obvious it is. No matter how much evidence is presented. That's why you either don't have any friends or what few you may have, just agree with you to shut you up.<br />
 <br />
Every post you make is nothing more than parroted liberal vomit. All one has to do is label something liberal or conservative and you are either for or against it accordingly. You judge nothing on it's merits. You decide by whatever flavor of the day rhetoric is regurgitated by your favorite pundits. I do thank you for one thing...everytime you open your mouth those, who are on the political fence and view this, are becoming more and more centralized ideologically. Your ultra-liberal (when it suits you) sociological stances have a repulsing property to them.</div></div><hr />

There is not much difference between 75 and 60, but there is a huge chasm between 30 and 15.So wait, your random numbers aside, you think it's perverted for a 33 year old man to be having sex with an 18 year old woman?<br />

So much so that a comedian should be censored for suggesting such a thing?<br />

There isn't anything necessary wrong with aiming it at the 14-year-old, but it wouldn't be as funny because she hasn't proven herself to be an irresponsible slut.  Yet.</div></div><hr />

It was &quot;a coarse joke,&quot;&quot;a bad joke,&quot; Letterman told viewers. &quot;But I never thought it was (about) anybody other than the older daughter, and before the show, I checked to make sure, in fact, that she is of legal age, 18.&quot;</div></div><hr />

Is that supposed to invalidate me? You'll have to do better than that. I can only suppose you're using the usual liberal targets of FOX news and Rush Limbaugh. I understand you can't find anything better to discredit the ideology so you go after these two. It's pathetic really, especially coming from the people who covet Rachael Madcow and Bill Maher.<br />
 <br />
By the way, I've never listened to Rush Limbaugh, outside of the few clips that were played on CNN. I NEVER watch FOX news. <br />
 <br />
So much for your theory...</div></div><hr />

<br />
(07-03) 13:09 PDT WASILLA, Alaska (AP) --<br />
<br />
Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin said Friday she is resigning from office at the end of the month, raising speculation that she would focus on a run for the White House in the 2012 race.<br />
<br />
&quot;Once I decided not to run for re-election, I also felt that to embrace the conventional Lame Duck status in this particular climate would just be another dose of politics as usual, something I campaigned against and will always oppose,&quot; Palin said in a statement released by her office.Yep, the state of Alaska just isn't good enough for this diva any more.<br />
<br />
Now we'll see a Palin/Limbaugh ticket (or something equally ridiculous) for 2012.  At least I hope we do (as does Obama, I suspect).  It would be the biggest defeat in all election history.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Panamah</div><div class="date">07-06-2009, 03:41 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Howard Kurtz dishes some dirt:Perpetual Palin (http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/07/02/AR2009070200901.html)<br />
&quot;The top McCain aides who had tried hard to work with Palin--Steve Schmidt, the chief strategist; Nicolle Wallace, the communications ace; and Tucker Eskew, her traveling counselor--were barely on speaking terms with her, and news organizations were reporting that anonymous McCain aides saw Palin as a 'diva' and a 'whack job.' . . .<br />
<br />
&quot;By all accounts, Palin was either unwilling, or simply unable, to prepare. In the run-up to the Couric interview, Palin had become preoccupied with a far more parochial concern: answering a humdrum written questionnaire from her hometown newspaper, the Frontiersman . . .<br />
<br />
&quot;Palin was coping not only with the crazed life of any national candidate on the road but also with the young children traveling with her. Some top aides worried about her mental state: was it possible that she was experiencing postpartum depression? (Palin's youngest son was less than six months old.) Palin maintained only the barest level of civil discourse with Tucker Eskew, the veteran G.O.P. operative who had been made her chief minder. A third party had to shuttle between them to convey even the most rudimentary messages. 'She started to hedge her bets,' the same McCain friend says. 'Frequently, she would be concerned about how something would play in Alaska. What? You're worried about your backside in Alaska when there are hundreds of millions of dollars being spent?' One longtime McCain friend and frequent companion on the trail was heard to refer to Palin as 'Little Shop of Horrors.' &quot;</div></div><hr />

Her quitting her governorship shows she's a quitter, can't take the pressure, whatever else you want to read into it.   And she's rejecting the executive experience that a lot of people feel is important for the office.   It probably dooms her political future for much of anything at all.</div></div><hr />
