Detailed Instructions<br />
<br />
A Note about Meg: Meg Tucter offers instructions about how to combine a piece of imbued royal velium with etching tools in a jewelry kit to make a tradeable version. This version is NOT something that can be used to make the set for the quest, so don't do it unless you don't need that piece for the quest. Etching it makes the piece tradeable and also makes it wearable by both plate and chain classes, where the original No Drop pieces are only wearable by plate classes. <br />
<br />
Basic Smithing Information <br />
The most basic smithing recipe uses a flask of water, a certain size and type of ore, and the right kind of mold for the item you wish to make. The most common kinds of ore are just plain &quot;ore&quot;, &quot;medium quality ore&quot;, &quot;high quality ore&quot;, and &quot;velium&quot;. Ore and medium quality ore are only available on vendors. High quality ore is available both as a drop and in limited quantities on vendors. Velium is only available as a drop. They all can come in small pieces, which are stackable, and small bricks, large bricks, and blocks, which are not stackable. You generally need to use one of the conversion recipes to turn your raw ore into bits, sheets, or folded sheets, which then go into the recipe for whatever you wish to make. <br />
<br />
When smithing you combine your ingredients in one of the stationary forges located throughout a city. (You may have heard of the infamous &quot;never fail forge&quot; located deep in Dalnir. It sounds too good to be true because it is. This forge will indeed never fail, but only works on the recipes for a certain quest, and cannot be used for anything else.) Simply put your ingredients into the forge and hit combine. Often when turning your raw ore into one of the prepared states (bits, sheets, etc) you may get back more than one when successful, so watch for notes about a recipe's yield when buying or collecting ore. You may also sometimes need one of the several different kinds of hammers that are sold by ore vendors. When a hammer is required, you will get it back whether or not you succeed at an attempt, so they can be reused indefinitely. <br />
<br />
You may also have heard of cultural smithing. Cultural recipes are those that can only be done by a person of the right race and can only be created in one of the special forges in that person's home city. The special forges cannot be used for regular recipes or by anyone who is not of the right race. If you try to open the forge but get a message saying that you cannot use that forge, it is because it is one of the cultural ones. There should also be regular ones elsewhere in the city, so keep looking. See the Smithing Recipes section for specifics about the various things you can smith. <br />
<br />
Velium Hound Fur: <br />
Velium Hounds are found out in Western Wastes. It seems that getting sufficient fur might not be as easy as it sounds. The zone seems to be extremely overhunted right now as everyone and their mothers try to get their fur, or worse, farms them to sell at exorbitant prices. Definitely bring a tracker or ten to help you beat the farmers to the wolves. (An example: just last night on the Karana server there was someone in West Wastes auctioning wanting to trade farmed furs for a hierophant's cloak. It is a revolting display of greed that makes my stomach churn.) The wolves share a spawn table with the other animals in the area so you could try killing other roaming animals. The only problem with this is that eventually all that is left are various creatures like cragwyrms that give Claws of Veeshan faction hits, so everyone leaves the zone until the next time the zone is reset. The wolves are not on any faction so the dragons don't seem particularly concerned when they see you killing them. If you are good faction with the dragons, you can probably ignore them. Just be aware that there is one dragon near the Temple of Veeshan zone which is on the Kunark dragon Ring of Scale faction, and one in the wyvern caves which appears to be on Guardians of Veeshan faction, to which everyone is kos. <br />
<br />
Velium: <br />
Get yerself back to Crystal Caverns or Velketor's! Remember your old buddies the orc miners and the crystalline spiders? They miss you! Go pay them another visit. If you still have an aversion from collecting last time, you can also try the various icy-looking golems in places like Velks or the Tower of Frozen Shadow or down the pit in Icewell Keep. The blocks are a new drop with this shawl, however, so it's possible they might not be in all these less used zones yet. There are extra recipes provided in the Overview of the Recipes up above so that you can convert the different kinds of velium that drop into the large bricks and blocks that you need. There is no need for you to use all of those recipes if you have enough large bricks and blocks. <br />
<br />
Coldain Velium Temper: <br />
You can acquire the temper you need for making folded sheets either by buying from the vendor in the Thurgadin Mining Company at 41, -111 in Thurgadin, or by making it yourself. It costs about 26pp each to buy, and about 6-15pp each to make, depending on whether you loot or buy your research components. Allspice can be bought from several different alchemy vendors around Norrath, including Hulda in the Thurgadin bank. Brown algae is available only from Blumblum Swigwater, one of the othmir in Cobalt Scar. Celestial solvent is only available from a few Poison Vendors in Luclin. There is a list of research components that work for celestial essence here. <br />
<br />
Unrefined Gems: <br />
These drop from the shimmering geonids in the Wakening Lands cave and from the wyverns in Western Wastes. They are No Drop. As far as the geonids go, only the shimmering ones drop gems. However, every single shimmering geonid drops one of the three gems, so you shouldn't have to kill the poor things for ages. Gems from them seem to drop in about the right proportions so you shouldn't have to kill dozens and dozens to get that last right gem unless you have an exceptionally unlucky streak. Regular geonids are placeholders for the shimmering ones, so you might also have to kill some of them to get spawns. You do take faction hits on all of the geonids. However, there are conflicting reports on how big those hits are. Some folks report that they got all their gems without dropping from indifferent, while others report that they were scowling by the time they were done. I myself went from indifferent to apprehensive with my first kill, with no prior hits to geonid faction. So...your mileage may vary. <br />
<br />
As for the wyverns, the burrowing wyverns seem to drop a gem every time like the shimmering geonids do. They also seem to sometimes drop off of huntresses and hunters. These are on Claws of Veeshan faction, but do not give faction hits when killed. As with hunting velium hounds, be careful if you are near the Temple of Veeshan, as there is a dragon on Ring of Scale faction around there, or in the wyvern caves, as there is a dragon on the kos-to-everyone Guardians of Veeshan faction in there. You might want to consider targeting the wyverns when you are killing velium hounds, to collect both ingredients and help refresh the spawn table at the same time. <br />
<br />
General Bragmur: <br />
You will find him to start the action bit at -3400, 9000 in Iceclad. His respawn is about 4 hours in case you happen to catch him shortly after someone else has killed him or completed the quest. Reports are that his pathing during the trek to the gnomes is a little flakey, he will sometimes disappear and then reappear as he is walking, so don't panic. It might be reassuring to have a tracker in case you lose sight of him entirely. Some folks have also reported that it helped to have someone who can feign, to agro the General and lead him back to the appropriate route in case he warps back to his spawn point or otherwise gets off track. He also sometimes seems to agro on members of your party even if they are not kos and did not do anything to attack him, so it may be good to have an enchanter at the ready with Memory Blur loaded. As you travel, you will encounter five waves of attack from the giants and their wolves, some harder than others. It sounds like three coordinated groups of 55+ are required at the very barest minimum. Remember that you will also be agroed by all the green wolves and giants and obnoxious dervishes that you encounter along the way. It might be smart to have a few folks as the designated greenie brigade to help keep them out of everyone else's hair while fighting the real attacks. Please give those nasty dervishes a whack for me while you're at it. You may also wish to walk the path through all of the locs indicated below, so that you know where the General should be going and are prepared for each fight. <br />
<br />
First Wave: (-3550, 7550) 4 Kromriff Tracking Wolves spawn and attack. These cannot be snared or rooted. Unsure about stuns or mezzes. The wolves are not difficult. <br />
Second Wave: (-2200, 7250) 4 Frost Giant Skirmishers spawn and attack. They hit for 178 max I believe and were again easily dispatched. <br />
Third Wave: (-1100, 5950) Commander Kvarid and 3 Frost Giant Skirmishers spawn and attack. (They spawn on the General.) They cannot be stunned, mezzed, rooted or snared. The Frost Giant Skirmishers are 55ish, and Commander Kvarid is 57. <br />
Fourth Wave: (1500, 2250) 5 Kromriff Tracking Wolves spawn and attack. <br />
Fifth Wave: (3700, 2650) Commander Vjorik and 5 Frost Giant Skirmishers spawn and attack. (They spawn on the General.) <br />
<br />
The various wolves and giants that you will fight during this process also drop some very nice gear. So far reported have been the: <br />
Snowchipper: 1HS 10/20, AC 5, str/sta/dex 5, sv cold 10, 3% to parry, weight 4.0, recommended level 51, war,rog,brd,shd,pal,rng/all<br />

NPC Text <br />
Note: There are two versions of the Runed Coldain Prayer Shawl. The first is the one you create during the seventh shawl quest, while the second is the one that you get back upon showing the first to any of a few different coldain involved in the eighth shawl quest. I have noted throughout the NPC text which version you can give to which coldain (of those who ask for it) and which version they will give you back. Those who accept either version will only give the Approved version back. Therefore, you can only summon the Dain ONCE, so you may wish to have all of the armor prepared beforehand so that you can be sure he will be up when you are ready to turn it in. If you give the Original to someone who only returns the Approved, you will lose your ability to summon the Dain at all. You can tell the two versions apart by holding it on your cursor and having someone cast the spell Identify on you (or cast it on yourself). If it identifies as &quot;Runed Coldain Prayer Shawl&quot;, it is the &quot;Original&quot; version. If it identifies as &quot;Approved by the Dain&quot;, it is the &quot;Approved&quot; version. <br />

[Give Dain Frostreaver IV: Runed Coldain Prayer Shawl (either Original or Approved)]<br />
Dain Frostweaver IV says, &quot;Ah Verdandi. I was hoping to see you. We require your skilled hand. The Armory is overtaxed preparing armor for the war that we are preparing to wage on the Giants of Zek. We need you to help by creating some Field Plate for a mission that is near to execution. Go see Loremaster Solstrin in the Hall of Ancestors, give him these orders. He holds the lore recorded on how to make the field plate.&quot;<br />

The first details how to make the basic armor, the other details how to begin [working with gemstones]. If the Dain is asking you for them you should place them in an [Issue Kit]. May Brell guide your hand friend, good luck to you.&quot;<br />
[Receive: Forge of Icewell Keep &amp; Precious Gem Study] <br />
<br />
You say, &quot;What about working with gemstones?&quot;<br />
Loremaster Solstrin says, &quot;Aye, gems are placed within the armor. Brell is pleased with this fusion of ore and gem. The combination produces a sturdy piece of armor. You will need some Etching Tools to work with the gems. If you ask Meg Tucter for a set, she should have some lying about.&quot;<br />
<br />
You say, &quot;What about the issue kit?&quot;<br />
<br />
Loremaster Solstrin says, &quot;The Standard Issue Kit is what we issue to soldiers at the beginning of their mission. I have this empty one here. Before I give it to you, could you show me your Runed Coldain Prayer Shawl? I would like to see how skilled you are.'<br />
[Give Loremaster Solstrin: Runed Coldain Prayer Shawl (either Original or Approved)]<br />
<br />

<br />
Meg Tucter says, &quot;Oh, really? There are not many that work in faceting gems. I am surprised to see your interest. You can have this old set of mine. If you are working with Royal Velium and want to give it to someone else, you can use these etching tools and your jewelers kit to engrave the piece for them. Be careful though, because once the armor is engraved you cannot remove it and it will be useless to the Dain. There is no need to return the tools, Talem recently made me a new sturdy set. Brell bless him.&quot;<br />

Dain Frostreaver IV says, &quot;After General Bragmur has equipped the armor you have created for him, give him these orders. He is a skilled diplomat and will need to reach the pirate Gnomes. We must enter into a pact with them. We will supply them with the velium that they need to build their silly gadgets, and they will take their ship back to Antonica and call for reinforcements from our ancestors. We hope they will accept this pact, after all Brell has been known to align himself with Bristlebane whom the Gnomes of Iceclad follow. You may be an important [factor] in their success&quot;<br />

Royal Forge of Icewell Arms Set.12 - Royal Field Plate<br />
===============<br />
The field plate of the Coldain Royal Armory is lightweight and good for any expedition where battle may occur. The following are the summarized steps of the process: <br />
<br />
1. To start you will need to first hammer out the folded sheets of velium that the armor is constructed from. Place a Block of Velium in the forge, as it become more malleable begin to hammer it flat with a Velium Smithy Hammer. When flat pour some Coldain Velium Temper onto the sheet. Fold the sheet over on top of itself and hammer it down flat once again. <br />
<br />
2. Now begin to work on the Velium Rings that will link the pieces of the armor together. To make a set of rings, places a large brick of velium into the forge and heat it up a bit. Take a metal file and file off small pices and shape them into a circular shape. Cool them in a vial of coldain velium temper to strengthen them. <br />
<br />
3. Take a break from the hot forge and prepare to fashion the soft fur padding which will be placed on the inside of the armor. The fur will serve as comfort and to keep the body warm. The softest fur is found from velium hounds. Take a patch of their fur and sew it into patterns that will fit inside the armor. Use silver thread to accomplish this. <br />
<br />
4. The preparations are now complete. You can now begin to fashion the armor. Use a Coldain Smithing Hammer to hammer the folded velium sheets into a plate mold. Once the sheet has been hammered into the mold. Begin attaching the velium rings to the outer areas of the armor that will connect to the other pieces. Then begin attaching the soft fur padding to the insides of the armor piece. For creating Bracer and Boots you need 1 folded velium sheet. For vambraces gauntles and helmet you will need 2 folded velium sheets. For the breastplate and greaves you will need 3 folded velium sheets to fill the mold. <br />

Now that the armor is created you can begin to set a gem within it. We have found three gems that when faceted will seem to add an aura that radiates from the armor. It is our firm belief that Brell himself is pleased with the fusion of Ore and Mineral and bestows powers unto the armor. Three different gems are used in the process of creating this armor: Diamonds, Emeralds and Sapphires. These are not normal gems that circulate through the economy; these are gems pulled fromthe raw ore and faceted to draw upon its powers. To facet the unrefined gem you will first need a set of fletching tools to chip away the raw edges. Place the gem firmly in your jewelry kit and slowly chip away at all sides until a nice smooth edge is formed. When you have finished with the lapidary place the piece of armor you wish to work on into your jewerly kit. Use your etching tools to farm a base for the gem to fit in. Then place the gem into the base you just created and you are finally done. The optimum effect of gems has been found as follows: Diamonds for the Breastplate and Greaves, Sapphires for the Vambraces and Bracers, and Emeralds for the Boots, Gauntlets and Helmets.</div></div><hr />

<br />
From Diggins' post below:<br />
<br />
We did the final part of the 8th shawl quest last night for Seryne Dipety on the Tunare server. Yes, the general is on Coldain faction and eats the kit and orders you turn into him. The general proceeds to take a nice long walk through Iceclad to the gnome pirate igloos after the hand in. Along the way, you have to fight off waves of level 50ish frost giant skirmishers and Kromriff tracking wolves that ambush you in groups of five each. I didn't take the time to parse any damage, but they seemed to be hitting in the 130s range. We got some nifty mid level items from these mobs too(AC 8 +5 wis/int +40 hps/mana +10cr +2%dodge neck item for instance).<br />
<br />
Overall, it was pretty easy and we had no casualties. I would suggest two groups of level 55+ people to keep the general alive during the ambushes and fight off the annoying trash mobs like snow dervishes. It's a pretty fun little event.</div></div><hr />

General Bragmur at neg3400 p9000 is on Dain faction so having people who are KoS to the dain help you isnt a good idea since he has a rather large aggro radius. =)<br />
<br />
[Fri May 10 00:04:40 2002] You say, 'Hail, General Bragmur'<br />
[Fri May 10 00:04:41 2002] General Bragmur says 'Please keep yer voice down I am busy here. If you do not mind I would ask that ya kindly leave.'<br />
[Fri May 10 00:04:52 2002] General Bragmur begins to put the armor, 'Finally the Dain has gotten word of my arrival here. I await his final orders before proceeding.'<br />
[Fri May 10 00:05:39 2002] General Bragmur says 'The final orders, follow me closely! I pray that the Kromrif have not learned of our plans to allign with the gnomes.'<br />
<br />
The General then heads out East at a decent clip. When we did it he was popping around alot. I think they made him despawn and respawn to get around some of the nastier landscape so dont have a heartattack if he suddenly disappears for a few seconds.<br />
<br />
[Fri May 10 00:07:28 2002] Commander Vjorik shouts 'The tracking wolves have found the Coldain! To the South West, Charge him!'<br />
<br />
This happens at about n3550 p7550 and 4 blue Kromrif dire wolves spawn and attack. They were fairly easy with the 3 groups of 60s we had there. After the fight the General heads to the north again. At n2200 p7250 right next to the stone building 4 Frost giant skirmishers ambushed the party. They hit for 178 max I believe and were again easily dispatched. After the fight the General heads northeast.<br />
<br />
At n1100 p5950 right next to another stone building 3 frost giant skirmishers and Commander Kvarid ambushed the convoy.<br />
<br />
[Fri May 10 00:17:46 2002] Commander Kvarid's corpse shouts 'Arghhhh! Though you have felled me your plans shall not succeed! Rallos will destroy you all for invading our lands!'<br />
<br />
Again the giants were easily dispatched and the Commander dropped a nice twink helm.<br />
<br />
18ac 5str 5wis 5int 20hp 20 mana 10cr effect: Velium Shards<br />
<br />
The General sets out to the northeast again and crosses onto the Tower of Frozen Shadows island next. At p1500 p2250 5 Kromrik tracking wolves jumped us and again were easily dispatched. We headed out again towards the pirate island and got our last ambush at the lone tree on the hill, p3700 p2650. Commander Vjorik and his 5 frost giant skirmishers went down in a heap and the commander dropped this. There were other stats but I didnt catch them.<br />
<br />

<br />
After that fight we crossed the iceflows to the 2 gnomes and saw this. =P<br />
<br />
[Fri May 10 00:31:31 2002] General Bragmur says 'Lo there gnomes! Tell me is your camp located nearby?'<br />
[Fri May 10 00:31:31 2002] Ratop says 'Yar ye scruvy bearded dwarf, just over tha hill there.'<br />
[Fri May 10 00:31:31 2002] Ritap says 'Arrrrrrrrrrr!'<br />
<br />
And finally we got to the pirate camp.<br />
<br />
[Fri May 10 00:32:50 2002] Captain Nalot says 'Hrm? Who is scuffin' around out here?'<br />
[Fri May 10 00:33:00 2002] General Bragmur says 'Greetings Captian Nalot, I have come to you with a proposition to make.'<br />
[Fri May 10 00:33:00 2002] Captain Nalot says 'Arrrrrr what is it ye want?'<br />
[Fri May 10 00:33:10 2002] General Bragmur says 'Well ya see sir, we have a surplus of Velium that we would not mind sharing with you for yer tinkerin' but would ask a favor in return for it.'<br />
[Fri May 10 00:33:10 2002] Captain Nalot says 'Velium eh? Well there matey lets hear what you have got to say!'<br />
[Fri May 10 00:33:20 2002] General Bragmur says 'I represent the Dain in this matter, we would like for you to use yer Icebreaker there to head to Antonica and bring reinforcements for the war that is preparing to ensue. We are needin' all the help we can get against the Kromrif.'<br />
[Fri May 10 00:33:30 2002] Adisson Stubblechin says 'Don't be thinkin' I was forgettin' ya, Nilham, ya spotty-faced salt licker. Remember, ya tell us where ya put our rum, an' we let ya out. Otherwise, ya have ta stay here!'<br />
[Fri May 10 00:33:33 2002] Avatar of Below 's voice echoes through the area. 'The efforts to help the Coldain and bring them together with the gnomes of Iceclad is quite impressive. There will be no doubt that they will continue to increase in power until they can overtake the Giants of Zek. Hey there, what is that on your shoulder?'<br />
<br />
I tried talking with him a bit but all I could make him say was this before I turned in my 7th shawl to him.<br />
<br />
[Fri May 10 00:34:50 2002] You say, 'What shawl'<br />
[Fri May 10 00:34:50 2002] Avatar of Below says 'So it is the sacred rune of the Coldain. Let me have a closer look at it.'<br />
[Fri May 10 00:34:52 2002] Avatar of Below glowers at you dubiously -- what would you like your tombstone to say?<br />
<br />
[Fri May 10 00:35:02 2002] Avatar of Below holds the shawl up close to one eye to look at the rune sewn into it. He smiles to himself and then drops it to the ground and places one hand on it. A bright blue glow starts to emanate in the snow, then there is a sudden flash! The Avatar has dissipated. All that is left behind is the Shawl lying in the snow, shimmering with a new power. Pirotess slowly bends down to pick it up, and is infused with a blessing from Brell.<br />
[Fri May 10 00:35:02 2002] General Bragmur says 'I must go tell the Dain of these events immediately!'<br />
[Fri May 10 00:35:02 2002] Captain Nalot scratches his head, 'Yar ya do that ya crazy Coldain.'</div></div><hr />

What is Dain faction needed for the quest?<br />
What is Coldain faction needed for the quest?<br />
<br />
I pretty much have full set of armor now (need one $^## fur) and Im set.  But since I was working on GoDS, I took a rather mean dain hit on his killing... I think Im down to apprehensive with him, and KoS to coldain.  Correcting later one will not be a problem, although I would like to know how high do I need it (in case General decides to eat the box), but the former one...I no longer have easy access to KT hit since he is heavily contested for, so getting dain faction up is a rather big problem.  So the question stands: How high is my faction is supposed to be for the turn ins? (BTW IIRC Avatar of Below is on Dain faction, or at least was conning same way as Dain when we did the shawl for a friend)<br />
