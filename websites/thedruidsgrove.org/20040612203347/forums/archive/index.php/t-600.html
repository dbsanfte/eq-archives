Am just wondering with the new patch and them fcking with the xp, and grp xp, anyone else feeling really useless and thinking about quitting? I mean I was sittin in PoT, PoJ, PoI, and PoD alternating about every 15min earlier today looking for a group, i finally said screw it and logged. Druids just dont have what it takes for people to want in a group, so just curious..who else feels these frusterations?<br />

Last night I grouped with friends, had some laughs and got 1.5 aa in about two and a half hours.  At 5-6% per kill I can get abit more than 1 AA in about the same time.  I can still solo when I'm feeling anti-social, I can group the rest of the time.  Gone are the days of me not wanting friends to join me because they would slow down my EXP.  It's actually given me a little more incentive to play again.</div></div><hr />

Nope (not thinking of quiting).<br />
<br />
don't let the door hit your backside on the way out. (hurry along I don't have patience for those that whine or make you won't have me to kick around sounds).<br />
<br />
Nothing rude about it - you haven't heard me when I'm rude (sort of like Bruce Banner when he's angry) <br />
<br />
Every time there's a nerf we hear a lot of people complain - no problem with that.  People should complain when something happens they don't like.<br />
<br />
On the other hand when something happens you don't like, don't stand there threatning to take your marbles and go home.  Just pick up your bloody marbles and go already.</div></div><hr />

I thought we had managed to get rid of all you folks who flame people for daring to complain about the state of the game.<br />
<br />
&quot;Whining&quot; as you put it, is what gets changes made.  Time and again its been shown.  If you don't bitch about things, Sony is content to let it sit there and fester.<br />
<br />
For 2 years druids were afraid to complain about their rapidly fading worth out of fear that we'd get nerfed even more.  All that did was get us completely forgotten by Verant.<br />
<br />
If you don't like reading posts about people who aren't happy with the game, don't read them.  Don't attempt to frighten off the complainers by subjecting them to ridicule just because you don't like it.  If it weren't for &quot;whiners&quot; you'd still be trying to heal with Nature's Touch and Renewal, wishing your epic could hit anything, grumbling that your best DoT was WD, wishing you could port to Luclin, trying to buff yourself with a group buff, and wondering why you were considered absolutly useless.<br />
<br />
If you're happy, good for you.  Cookies are on the left.  But don't knock others for voicing their dissatisfaction.</div></div><hr />

So I've been playing Jedi Knight II: Jedi Outcast on my second computer not connected to the internet and having a blast, and EQ has slowly been slipping into old memories...<br />

So, who knows what will happen when I get my comp back and log into EQ. Maybe I will feel I'm back home or it will have no excitement for me... Only time can tell. :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
I dont' usually say things like that.  But to be perfectly honest I have been thinking it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>brum15</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">I would not quit if I were you Luecifer.   However waiting for POP groups at 54 is kind of useless for most anyone.  I have a paladin at 52 and mage at 54.   I know that both of them will have to be closer to 57 or 58 before they will be preferred for groups even in tier 1.   And that will be  long time from now since my cleric and druid are both more important to me.<br />
<br />
At 54 seb is an awesome place for druids.  Dont know if you are in a guild or not but WW and TOV are also awesome places.  Give it a few more levels and the planes become friendlier.  Dont get me wrong I know druids have a harder time getting groups anyhow.  but at level 54 for POP it is not just the druid strike working against you, it is a level strike also.<br />
<br />
Even for just the factory in POI or for the hedge in PON if a 54 tank wanted to join us, they would definitly be last resort and never as the main tank.  POJ you should do just fine, POI stairs, POD at the rock to the left of lake(would be challenging healing on a multi pull though).  Problem is POI and POJ are always crowded on our server.  68 on our server in POJ the other nite and no it was not a guild raid or anyone doing trials.  If you have any good friends you could take your own group to PON.   Just be flexible til your level gets up a little higher.  It will be the same with teir 2 now.  Yes you can get in POS at 55 but dont expect to get groups there that low.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Kytelae</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">I think brum has it right. Most people would consider 54 too low to be useful in most of PoP. The game is full of places for you to play at that level though, so you might give that a try before you decide to quit. <br />
<br />
I do think anyone who doesn't enjoy the game, at least most of the time, might be better off doing something else. It is supposed to be entertainment, isn't it? As for me, no I'm not thinking about quitting. But I'm 58 and I've boycotted PoP from the beginning :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Keana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Aye, I would tend to agree, at 54, if you don't have your elysian gear, go to Umbral, get a new suite of Armor, Elysian is some of the best you can get outside the higher end zones.<br />
<br />
I spent there from 53-55, because of the armor and the EXP there is good, 1-4% per kill, depending on the con level.  Thats Solo.   Usually I'd hunt there in groups with other druids and we would stack the dots like mad.   5 druids grouped, we took out 4 skellys, it was chaotic, it was busy, and it was fun.<br />
<br />
Plus you can get several of your spells there, SoE drops there frequently.</div></div><hr />

<br />
yeah, but as soon as you hit 55 you're ready for tier 2 planes!   :p <br />

<br />
 Be Patient Luecifer at lvl 54 isn't too bad.but 55+ you will lack a few spells to really be effective until lvl 58 when you get some power back.<br />
<br />
 Wehn I'm fustrated at playing I like to do little quests or go to newb zones and buff people it takes my mind off of things.<br />

But no plans of quitting.<br />

With the new expansion coming out, and what is being promised, rather enthused about it really.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Panamah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Well yeah... not just thinking it, doing it.  Not because of the solo nerf but because I'm burnt out to a crispy crisp that's so crisp a mouse fart in my general direction would scatter my crispy brain like ashes in a wind.  Another raid, another boring experience slog.... that'd be the mouse fart I have to avoid.<br />
<br />
I did log in an managed to grind xp for 2 hours last night and I hated it.  I actually used the other computer to look up my mutual funds and was astonished to see not all the numbers are red any longer....<br />
<br />
I'll be back though, for LDoN.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Solice Farwalker</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">Aidon, I suggest you read the entire post.  I didn't &quot;flame&quot; the guy because he was complaining.  In the post I encouraged complaining.<br />
<br />
What I &quot;flamed&quot; about was the &quot;I don't like it so I'm going to quit&quot; types of post.<br />
<br />
If you don't like it and you're going to quit then do so.  I don't need to hear about it.<br />
<br />
If you don't like it and you want to bitch about it and try to get something done then that's a different story.<br />
<br />
Go for it!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Panamah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">Sometimes you just need to unload your frustrations and have some friendly ears to hear you, perhaps sympathize with you.  Whether or not this person is ready to quit or not they're frustrated with things.  I remember the Horse ducking thing just pissed me off no end.  On one level it was such a stupid thing it made me want to quit, on the other hand, I still wasn't ready to quit.  Being able to complain about it and knowing I wasn't alone in my frustration helped. <br />
<br />
Maybe a little more sensitivity is in order.  It seemed pretty hostile to me.  Like someone who is depressed might say, &quot;Oh I might as well just end it all&quot; and not really mean it, but they're expressing a despair about things.  If you tell them, &quot;Well just kill yourself and stop bitching about it&quot; that would be a pretty hostile thing to say.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Wiggume</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">Seriously bail. You will feel waaay better about it once you get another character leveled up. The druid class isn’t what’s stopping you. If it was just the druid you would have bailed already, by asking the question you show that. What’s holding you back is the time you put into leveling your druid and the power you have due to your level. <br />
<br />
Let it go. Its time wasted. Druids aren’t going to get any better. Heck look at GD, they can’t even agree on what’s wrong with them, many are even saying there is nothing wrong. <br />
<br />
I was in the same boat as you at the last druid nerf. I quit back then and when I look at the druid situation today I think 'wow i'm a #$@%# genius!' haha. If I had to do it all over again I would have quit before CH came out. That was a tease that kept me playing an obsolete class even after I realized it.<br />
<br />
/played is the only thing keeping druids in this game. Seeing a new Druid on Stromm server is like seeing Bigfoot. I heard someone saw a druid in Iceclad the other day, but it’s just a rumor at this point :P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>WyteNK</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">I quit every time I subscribe.<br />
<br />
Well, that is to say, I cancel my subscription.  I have a personal beef against the Columbia House mentality of &quot;Don't do anything and we'll ship you a product of our choice, isn't that excellent?&quot;.<br />
<br />
But that's not really an answer to your question.<br />
<br />
I think about quiting every time I get &lt;strong&gt;too&lt;/strong&gt; involved in this game.  I really have to balance my time;  it can get out of hand.  Therefore, the biggest contributing factor is timesinks in EQ.  Those lead to wanting to quit.<br />
<br />
Balance, it's all about balance...</div></div><hr />

I am a happy druid :) .<br />
<br />
I'm happy with the current game mechanics, happy with how I earned my 65 levels.<br />
<br />
Do you mind if I let it be known that there is not just constant whining and complaining in Norrath's land when it comes to druids ? No, really, do you ?<br />

I would think yes, being a good druid, that gets groups fairly easily and knowing how to play one, is the first service I can do the druid community. Not quite sure what you might have done so much more so far :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Luecifer of Prexus[/quote]<br />
I'm usually very comprehensive in RL when someone has difficulties, and/or feels discouraged by an obstacle.<br />
<br />
However, when I read such posts, it doesn't entice me to give any kind of support, or compassion. It's not like that the above poster is the first lvl 54 druid being frustrated about our broken 52-57 levels. Druids made it through before him, and continue to do it everyday. <br />
<br />
Second, blaming his inability to get groups (to get friends to group with him because he soloed his first 54 levels ?) on a patch that has brought major positive changes also seems ridiculous to me, hence my sarcasm. The patch certainly didn't make anything worse for druids looking for groups.<br />
<br />
Finally, I can agree with you to some extent that complaining is needed, if something is objectively wrong. Complaining made it so that we now have our CH, complaining has it made it so that we have now a better role in groups, yes, but that was... constructive complaining.<br />
<br />
I do not see any kind of constructive complaining in the first post, and forgive me if I flamed it, but I, as a druid playing since 1999, wish my class to get rid of that negative reputation of constant &quot;whiny b*tches&quot; ever since.</div></div><hr />

He might be a miserbale old git but don't doubt what he's contributed. Its certainly more than me and unless you're hiding behind that name and are one of maybe 2 or 3 other candidates, he's done more than you too.<br />
<br />
Nothing wrong with being happy with your druid. What you should remember though is that the reason you're happy with your druid now is largely due to those that weren't happy a long time ago. One of which you were talking to. :)</div></div><hr />

I realise I am a new member to this community, and I am most willing to give all the credits when it's due (even to Aidon).<br />
<br />
However you have to admit it is a hard thing to do with someone that comes down from their &quot;pedestal&quot; only to bully people around, &quot;not to flame when someone is whining&quot; because they are &quot;Sir Bitter Druid&quot;, all this while pointing madly at their post count as if we were measuring the size of their genitalia or validity of their points at it.<br />
<br />
In the case of the initial poster, not bringing up any constructive criticism, seemingly not really wanting to find a solution to his issue, what is the difference from an unoriginal whining troll that we will not hear about again ?</div></div><hr />

There was a guy my husband works with (in the Navy). The guy said &quot;I wish I had a knife so I could kill myself.&quot; Within minutes 10 or so people handed him a knife. For weeks, months, even a year afterwards, the guy still finds knives hidden near his living spaces. Under pillows. In his clothes... everywhere with regularity.<br />
<br />
I feel bad for this guy. But at least he hasn't committed suicide yet.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u40"><b>Autumn10</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p40">Hmmm, well at 54 the expansion should have actually opened things up to you more. More blues and such in zones that are more appropriate to your level. If you want to quit now you will REALLY want to quit once you get to 65 and get a bunch of AA. It's not rocket science, if you're not haing fun or enjoying your time in the game then maybe you should quit. Ultimately it's for you to decide.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Some of you that are 58+ seem to forget that it doesn't matter what you do, it's not so easy to get a group from 45-57.  45-50 it starts getting harder, after that it really starts getting hard.  As far as friends go, I have tons of friends online.  Most of them are now 60-65, and hunt in places where all my characters would be worthless.  To make it worse, only maybe one or two is on at the same time.  We all have different schedules, which makes it even harder to group with them.<br />
<br />
You could probably get another character to level 10 in the time it takes you to get a group as a 54 druid.  Best option seems to be to turn on lfg, do a shout or two in zones that you would like to group in, then go solo somewhere...or work on trade skills like you had said you started.  Eventually you might get a tell.</div></div><hr />

We have a whole section devoted to those who get(got) fed up and quit and post.<br />
It is called The Old Ones.<br />

And Hobbit, I just wanted to share some history with these new people in this thread.  I think that it is relevent on many levels to the discussions here now.(especially for our 2 EQDruids visitors).</div></div><hr />

That's one post that should never be lost /nod. (if nothing else its a thread with more posts than most forums have lol)</div></div><hr />

::p  peeks in and looks around::<br />
<br />
I have been playing for about 5 months and I just got my only toon - a druid - to 55 + 6aa (dinged baroness today). I have been hanging out..just reading for a couple of weeks and trying do decide if this would be a cool place to hang out and come for  information and some help every once in a while.<br />
<br />
I just wanted to say that the last 3 or 4 levels have made me want to just crawl under a rock and I have been pushing like mad to get to 58 just to feel semi-useful again. I have noticed that many of the posters on this board are over 60 and can find groups easily (or so I have read ) I KNOW you guys all made it through what I am going through now but it does not make it any easier....When I was in my late 40's being a druid was cool, I could get a group..and some of my friends even took me to hang out in PoJ with them.<br />
<br />
NOW...most of my friends are in thier 60's and I can't even stay alive where they go! I won't even ask them if they wanna hang out anymore because I can't provide any kind of benifit to the group..My heals suck, snare/root won't stick 80% of the time, no point in buffing with thorns..it does nothing and 99% of the time they have something better. So pardon me if I am a little down when I am forced to solo - which I hate (I have never kited/quadded and really don't want to) while everyone around me is grouping in the planes or seb or gunthak. I will NOT quit but I will never say that I haven't thought about it.<br />
<br />
Sometimes when it has been a while since you have been through the crap its hard to empathise any more....Im not whining and im not here to start trouble...just to find a friendly ear in a community of individuals that have been through it....My name is Koldriana, and I AM a druid</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u53"><b>Aidon Rufflefuzz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p53">50-58 aren't known as the &quot;dark levels&quot; for nothing.<br />
<br />
They truly suck.  Honestly, as boring as it is, your best bet is quad your way through em and get em done with asap.<br />
<br />
Every class has a certain level range where it sucks to be that class.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u54"><b>AegiusForever</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p54">*trying to stay slightly more on topic* ;) <br />
<br />
I don't see myself quitting anytime soon, but as a parallel, I will not be playing any more online games, either. Even as good as SWG looks right now (eye candy is about it, too, atm), I am passing on it all: EQ2, WOW, SWG. I think the mileage will vary from person to person, but when Eq goes away, so too will my online gaming addiction, LOL.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u55"><b>Menlaiene</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p55">It doesn't get any better.  58 is just a carrot.  Pickup groups will still take a cleric 7 levels below you or break up rather than take a druid, much of the time.  Yes, you'll be able to heal your friends, if that's what matters to you, although I strongly recommend a backup healer until you get nature's infusion.  Pickup groups will still be few and far between.  I thought the same thing....if I forced myself to endure the torture of soloing another level...and another level....and another level, I'd finally be able to get groups more than once in a blue moon.  It never happened, and finally I just told that carrot to go shove it.  <br />

<br />
That will never change.  Don't expect it to, until half the Druids retire and level up a Cleric.<br />
Hell, I have taken a cleric 7 levels below me as MH for my group.</div></div><hr />
