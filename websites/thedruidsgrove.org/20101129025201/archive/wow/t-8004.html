<br />
Before the Beta, drinking effects were mentioned as possibly turning all characters into a hot female. Will new effects/consequences be implemented aside from the slurring of text, and swaying when walking?<br />
<br />
No “hot female” effects, however you will experience the following after having a few too many drinks: <br />
If you are more than half way drunk, you will start hiccoughing up drunk bubbles occasionally. <br />
As you get more drunk, you start weaving when you walk. <br />
As you decide to get even more drunk, you start slurring your words in chat. <br />
For every 20% drunk you are, creatures appear one level lower than they actually are<br />
<br />
