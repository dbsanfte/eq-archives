The priests are wussies.  Once slowed they attain the covetted &quot;gimp&quot; status.  A shaman with slow and torporing the tank can kill these mobs.</div></div><hr />

I did them for a friend recently with 2 druids (60 &amp; 57), a War and a Shm.  Was serious overkill.  I think any 2 of us could have done it, but three for certain.<br />

Delar seemed most common, whereas Bjek and Grenk seemed more uncommon. I believe Bjek to have a spawn time between 24 and 72 hours.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bjond</div><div class="date">03-30-2003, 03:23 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">.. 58 monk and 58 druid.  All three were very easy fights, but then the monk had very nice resists and resisted all the wrath spells from the giants.  My monk was ally-'zek, so once the giants were well into death crawl, he camped out to rinse agro and dodge the faction hit.<br />
<br />
Note that you'll want the giant to be around 4% HP before you have any of your group camp out that want to preserve faction.  I camped my monk when the first one hit crawl at about 20% hp.  The giant instantly summoned my druid and started in on her.  Fortunately, she was able to channel chloroblasts and stay alive until the monk relogged and spanked the giant down to 4% before relogging again.<br />
<br />
I would not recommend a druid try this as the only healer without the level 58 druid-CH.  Also, I would recommend you fight them where you find them.  The potential adds are all small greens that are easily dealt with -- had to kill 3 panthers and a holgresh during one fight, but that was really quick.  DO NOT do any damage to them if you decide to pull.  They all summon.</div></div><hr />

None of them were slowed.<br />
<br />
As to spawn times, I've been checking WL multiple times a day for the last 10 days or so, and I have a suspicion that it's around 48 hours.<br />
<br />
As to tracking them from dragon ring, none of the three were on track from the ring for me. Had to run out into the zone a little ways towards PoG.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bjond</div><div class="date">04-02-2003, 08:47 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I did the quest back to back two days in a row.  The giants weren't up about 20H after I did the first glove, but they were up about 28H afterwards.  BTW, unless you as a druid have VERY good resists, be sure not to pull the gaints or be first on the agro list.  It's much better to fight them in place with agro on the resist-heavy character than to pull them.  Oh, and especially don't use snare to pull.  Snare generates huge agro for these giants.  They'll glue themselves to you.  I killed my druid on the second day by using her to pull, since the fights were so easy on the first day.  :( <br />
<br />
Delar is often trackable from the dragon ring, but he roams away from it, too.  The best spot to be sure to see them is the lake.  I've always had at least one on tracking from the lake.  They roam on a rough line from just within track range to the ring on up to the NE of the lake up near the N edge of the zone.</div></div><hr />
