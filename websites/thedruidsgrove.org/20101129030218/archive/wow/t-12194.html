<br />
The Gods of Zul'Aman<br />
<br />
      The stronghold of Zul'Aman has stood for millennia as the Amani trolls' seat of power and bastion of the fearless, cunning warlord Zul'jin.<br />
<br />
      Zul'jin has spent several years plotting behind Zul'Aman's walls. Furious at the Horde for allowing his hated enemies, the blood elves, to join its ranks, he eagerly embraced a scheme that the witch doctor Malacrass recently proposed: to seal the power of the animal gods within the bodies of the Amani's strongest warriors.<br />
<br />
      Now Zul'Aman's army grows more powerful by the day, hungry to exact vengeance in the name of its fearless leader, Zul'jin.<br />
<br />
Guild Banks Introduced<br />
<br />
      The Guild Bank is a shared repository for an entire guild and will be accessible through Guild Vault objects near existing banks. The Guild Bank will allow players with the appropriate permissions to store items and money for use by the rest of the guild. Permissions to withdraw and deposit money and items are controlled by the guild leader through the guild controls menu. The Guild Bank is divided up into separate tabs so that the guild leader may restrict access or group items into distinct categories.<br />
          o Up to 6 purchasable tabs each containing 98 item slots<br />
          o Permissions to view/deposit/withdraw per tab<br />
          o You may use your Guild Bank withdraw limits to pay for item repairs (now enabled on all merchants)<br />
          o Transaction logs of the last 25 actions within each tab, as well as money activity. <br />
<br />
Dustwallow Marsh<br />
<br />
      Dustwallow Marsh has seen many improvements with the addition of over 50 new quests and a new neutral goblin town called Mudsprocket located in the southern part of the zone. There is also a small quest hub featuring a crashed goblin zeppelin, to the east of Tabetha's hut. <br />
<br />
Leveling Improvements<br />
<br />
      Many leveling improvements have been made for the old world.<br />
          o The amount of experience needed to gain a level has been decreased between levels 20 and 60. In addition, the amount of experience granted by quests has been increased between levels 30 and 60.<br />
          o Level 1-60 dungeon quests have had their experience and faction rewards increased.<br />
          o Many elite creatures and quests in the level 1-60 experience have been changed to accommodate solo play. <br />
<br />
General<br />
<br />
    * The latest patch of World of Warcraft: The Burning Crusade shows a benefit on today's popular multicore processors like the Intel(r) Core(tm)2 Duo processor family. The enhanced patch has demonstrated higher frame rates by spreading the work across both processor cores.<br />
    * Zul'Aman is a 10-player, level 70 outdoor instance located in the Ghostlands. Players will be able to confront six new bosses including the Forest Troll Warlord Zul'jin.<br />
    * Guild Banks have been introduced. The Guild Bank will allow players with the appropriate permissions to store items and money for use by the rest of the guild.<br />
    * Experience: The amount of experience needed to gain a level has been decreased between levels 20 and 60. In addition, the amount of experience granted by quests has been increased between levels 30 and 60.<br />
    * All items have had their bonuses to Weapon Skill Rating converted to a new stat called Weapon Expertise Rating. Each point of Weapon Expertise reduces the chance for your attacks to be dodged or parried by .25%.<br />
    * Healing reduction effects will now affect all health drain spells and abilities (e.g. Mortal Strike will reduce health gained from Drain Life).<br />
    * Healing: Almost all items and enchantments that provide bonus healing now also provide a smaller number (approximately 1/3) of bonus spell damage. There are a few items and enchantments where this was not possible, such as random-stat items and Zul'Gurub enchantments, but this is now the case on virtually all other items.<br />
    * On Kill Effects: Items and abilities that trigger on killing an enemy will no longer trigger on using an ability that kills your pet.<br />
    * Weapon Skill: All items and abilities that granted weapon skill have been changed. In most cases, they were converted to expertise or expertise rating. Ranged attacks do not benefit from expertise, so ranged weapon skill has generally been replaced by critical strike bonuses or hit bonuses. In a few cases, talents have been changed to other effects to avoid granting players excessive amounts of expertise.<br />
    * A new flight path has been added to the Rebel Camp in northern Stranglethorn Vale.<br />
    * Flying units can see ground units and vice versa at any altitude.<br />
    * Players no longer gain the moving AOE radius bonus if they are jumping.<br />
    * Client spell cast requests are now sent to the server even if your player is already casting another spell. This eliminates the need for /stopcasting in macros to compensate for latency.<br />
    * Vendor Discounts: All vendors with an associate faction now give discounts at all levels above neutral.<br />
          o Friendly: 5% discount<br />
          o Honored: 10% discount<br />
          o Revered: 15% discount<br />
          o Exalted: 20% discount<br />
          o Quest givers who have available daily quests will have a blue exclamation point instead of a yellow one. <br />
    * Pets will try to get behind their targets when engaging in melee combat.<br />
    * You can now obtain a tiny Sporebat pet with exalted Sporeggar faction.<br />
    * An Azure Whelp pet now drops from the blue dragonkin in Azshara.<br />
    * If you are seated and try to use abilities that require you to be standing, you will stand up and use them. This can be disabled with: /console autoStand 0 .<br />
<br />
    * Racial Abilities<br />
          o Dwarf: Gun Specialization now increases chance to critically hit with Guns by 1% rather than increasing weapon skill.<br />
          o Gnome: Escape Artist cooldown increased to 1 min, 45 sec.<br />
          o Humans: Mace Skill now increases expertise with maces and two-handed maces by 1%.<br />
          o Humans: Sword Skill now increases expertise with swords and two-handed swords by 1%.<br />
          o Orcs: Axe Skill now increases expertise with axes and two-handed axes by 1%.<br />
          o Troll: Bow and Thrown Specialization now increases chance to critically hit with those weapons by 1% rather than increasing weapon skill. <br />
<br />
PvP<br />
<br />
    * Arenas<br />
          o The top ranked team of each battlegroup for each format will receive a new unique title for the end of Season 2 called &quot;Merciless Gladiator&quot;. <br />
    * Battlegrounds<br />
          o Daily quests have been added targeting a random battleground for that day. Look for Alliance Brigadier Generals and Horde Warbringers near your faction's battlemasters in all major capitals.<br />
          o Dropping the Flag in a battleground will now result in a debuff that will not allow you to pick up the flag again for 3 seconds.<br />
          o Druids who are shapeshifted when they receive the Restoration buff from battlegrounds will now correctly regenerate mana.<br />
          o Players will now be able to cast spells for free in the Battleground before it begins.<br />
          o Players will now be able to cast spells for free for a few seconds after being resurrected by a Spirit Guide in the Battleground.<br />
          o Alterac Valley<br />
                + Additional Warmasters no longer report for duty upon destroying an enemy tower. However, destroying an enemy tower still eliminates the associated opposing Warmaster.<br />
                + All Warmasters are linked to each other and their respective Generals and can no longer be pulled individually.<br />
                + Honor from capturing towers has been increased.<br />

                + Many NPCs in Stormpike and Frostwolf holds are no longer elite<br />
                + Bonus Honor in Alterac Valley is now only awarded during the battle for destroying enemy towers and slaying the enemy Captain. Upon conclusion of the battle, bonus honor is also awarded for intact towers, a surviving Captain, and for victory in the battle. The total bonus honor awarded should be similar to the previous total.<br />
                + The Horde and Alliance now have a limited number of reinforcements available in the battle for Alterac Valley. The number of reinforcements available is reduced upon player death, loss of towers, and death of Captain Galvangar or Balinda Stonehearth. In addition, all available reinforcements are lost upon the death of General Drek'Thar or Vanndar Stormpike. If a team is reduced to zero reinforcements, the opposing team wins the battle.<br />
                + Towers and Graveyards in Alterac Valley are now captured in 4 minutes (down from 5). <br />
          o Eye of the Storm<br />
                + The points awarded from capturing the flag in Eye of the Storm is now increase based on the number of bases the capturing team owns. <br />
          o Warsong Gulch, Arathi Basin, Eye of the Storm<br />
                + Additional bonus honor is now awarded upon conclusion of the battle. <br />

    * Feral Attack Power: Items that granted bonus attack power in Cat, Bear, Dire Bear, and Moonkin forms have been re-evaluated. In almost all cases, the attack power on the item has been increased. This change corrects an issue where feral weapon damage was not keeping up with other classes in its rate of increase.<br />
    * Feral Charge: It is now possible for the interrupt and root effects from this ability to be resisted separately.<br />
    * Force of Nature: This ability will no longer automatically break stealth on victims in its casting area. Nearby stealthed characters may still be attacked if they are too close to the summoned Treants.<br />

    * Sorting of auction house searches has been simplified so you can only sort by one column, and automatic sub-sorts have been created for those columns to be as useful as possible.

    * The Battle Map has been renamed to the Zone Map and can be turned on for any zone rather than just PvP objective zones. There is now a drop down in the world map screen that allows you to choose when the zone map should display.<br />

    * All players now have a tracking bubble on their minimap.

    * Corpses that belong to someone in your party, but that you cannot loot will say in the corpse mouseover who has loot rights on that corpse. This will help skinners who want to know who to talk to in order to skin their corpse, as well as master looters when special loot drops on a normal monster. Everyone will then see that there is a monster that the master looter has loot rights on.<br />
    * When an item drops that you cannot loot due to uniqueness or other factor, you will get a chat message letting you know what the item was that you passed rolling on.<br />
    * If a player is looting a corpse and there are one or more items on it that player cannot loot, the player will still be able to see those items (although not able to loot them).

In addition flight masters that you have not yet gotten the flight point for will display on the minimap as a green exclamation point.<br />
    * Npc's will display an icon on mouseover that gives a more specific indicator of their function rather than just a gossip bubble. Questgivers will now show an exclamation mark as their in game mouseover. Innkeepers will show a hearthstone as their in game mouseover and so on.<br />

    * If you get a message &quot;Interface action failed because of an AddOn&quot;, this means that an AddOn interfered with the Blizzard UI in some way. To diagnose this, enter the following into chat &quot;/console taintLog 1&quot; and restart the game and try to reproduce it. If you reproduce it, you can quit the game and search through the file Logs\taint.log for the word &quot;blocked&quot; and mail the log to the author of the AddOn listed there. Once you have done this you can turn off logging by entering the following into chat &quot;/console taintLog 0”<br />
