<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Panamah</div><div class="date">09-23-2003, 10:32 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok, maybe we can help out some of the people struggling in LDoN.  But it'll take a willingness to try things that are a little different.  Experiment and be ready to fail, but the greater reward is, when you learn something new you can increase your wins overall.<br />
<br />
Let's keep this geared towards the folks who are struggling.  Those of you multi-tanking 20 mobs and AE'ing can start your own guide!  :p                   <br />
<br />
&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:red;font-family:courier;font-size:x-large;&quot;&gt;Pulling in LDoN&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;<br />
<br />
&lt;em&gt;Time to Engage Next Mob (TENM)&lt;/em&gt; is probably the most important element in winning.  Lets look at the math.  Say you get a slaughter 60.  You have 90 minutes to kill 60 beasties.  If you picked a collection quest, you might actually need to kill more than 60, just depends on random factors.  Ok, you must kill a mob ever 90 seconds.  Sounds, easy!  But in practice, if you aren't killing that mob in under 1 minute, you're probably going to lose.  Even then, I've had groups that could kill fairly fast, but they &lt;em&gt;moved&lt;/em&gt; onto the next mob so slowly that they lost.<br />
<br />
If it takes you 1 minute to kill, 30 seconds TENM, then if you have one bobble, one small problem, one untimely death, you will lose the dungeon.  <br />
<br />
So, what is the answer?  More DPS?  Ok, that will help get that kill time down, but if your TENM is long, it might not be enough.  The answer is to kill in less than one minute and make sure TENM is very, very short.  Generally that means your pulling strategy needs to be sound and agressive and it  means you can't have med breaks, cyber breaks, long bathroom breaks and so on.  <br />
<br />
&lt;strong&gt;Who Pulls?&lt;/strong&gt;<br />
<br />
The answer is anyone with the skill and guts! But there are some factors to determine who good choices are.<br />
<br />
Tanks are probably the worst choice in most cases, unless you have 2 tanks in a group.  They will make very large pulls which a pickup group just can't handle well (typically). <br />
<br />
Bard:  A fabulous choice.  They can lull mobs and lull apparently lasts for 5+ minutes.  Someone described their tactic as:  Send in bard to lull everything, group runs into the room and fights the mobs where they stand, one at a time. <br />
<br />
Enchanter: Another amazing choice.  Enchanter method is usually:  Pacify room, pull one with tash, run back to group.  Mez it, root it (maybe).  Go pull again while the group kills.<br />
<br />
Cleric:  But clerics with Pacification can pull incredibly well.  Problem is they get hammered when the mob comes.  However, if you pull with Mark of K(arn/ings) it has SO little aggro that anything can taunt it off you.  I had a cleric pulling tonight, we had constant chain pulls, it was great.  Rarely more than one in camp.  And clerics have 2-3 get-out-of-jail cards in their invulnerability abilities in case a pull goes badly.<br />
<br />
Ranger: Using a combination of sneak pulls and root pulls you can lower the size of the incoming.  A really good ranger will follow up by snaring and root parking adds.  Truly, a ranger can replace an enchanter if they're good.  They should be going to pull the next before the mob in camp dies.  <br />
<br />
Wizards:  Wizards make good pullers too.  They're able to root park with snare, root and such.  With their self-rune, they're fairly sturdy.<br />
<br />
Paladins: Root pulls, but you have to be cautious.  Don't just root the mob in the middle of the room. There might be ones on either side of the door you can't see.  Try camera angles or use a rogue to tell you the layout or get you a target. You'll get big pulls, but with root, you can stagger them out some.  Also, if you're able you can continue to root mobs and move out of the way.  Also, don't necessarily pull with stun.  The mob just sits there for 10 seconds drooling and you're losing time.  Another paladin mentioned that stuns have a large &quot;aggro splash&quot; which might make for larger pulls than just running in and tapping something with your lance.<br />
<br />
Druids: They can pull too, about like Wizards do.  But they can be more fragile without the self-rune.  Druids, like any class with snare and root, can make awesome crowd controllers. <br />
<br />
Monks: If a monk is skillful at pulling, can minimize the size of pulls, won't obsess over single pulls, and will chain pull, then a monk is a great choice.  Sometimes monks fall into the trap of feeling they have to split every pull and this can take an unnecessarily long time.  You also need a fairly attentive tank to tag things off the monk.   Here's a very good guide to LDoN written by a monk: pub147.ezboard.com/fmonkl...1214.topic (http://pub147.ezboard.com/fmonklybusiness43508frm2.showMessage?topicID=1214.  topic) definitely worthwhile reading.<br />
<br />
Duo Pullers: This can be slowish, so don't rely on it unless you absolutely have to.  Enchanter or cleric pacifies and pulls.  Someone else stands ready to root the mob before it kills the puller.  Need someone with an attention span longer than a gnat's.<br />
<br />
No One: Some dungeons it's just best to charge a corner closest to the doorway.  Send in the tanks first, hug the walls, try not to aggro other mobs in the room.<br />
<br />
No One: If you have enough tanks in the group, off tank!  Count on your rangers, beastlords and others to do this.  Beastlords make incredible off-tanks, because they can slow too and slow=massive aggro. <br />
<br />
Everyone: Try to work it out so the tank isn't pulling and use chain pulls. There should almost always be a mob being  &lt;em&gt;processed&lt;/em&gt; to death. <br />
<br />
&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:red;font-family:courier;font-size:x-large;&quot;&gt;Mana Management&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;<br />
<br />
I've played 5 classes post 60 in EQ, so I'm not totally uninformed.   <br />
<br />
&lt;strong&gt;Got Mana?&lt;/strong&gt;<br />
<br />
Use it!  If you're sitting close to FM and not contributing damage then you're not contributing!  Hoarding mana for a disaster might lead to a disasterous loss.    <br />
<br />
&lt;strong&gt;Clerics&lt;/strong&gt;... omg.  I am a total backseat driver since a cleric is the one class I have played for all 4 of my years in EQ.  I have opinions. :p     First off, if you're without AA's, especially SCM and you're level 65, I mock you.  Go get some AA's.  Make SCM your first archetype choice.  Saving mana is so important.  After that, I recommend Divine Arbitration, that is such a butt-saver on large pulls and it gets you 0 aggro.  Get ALL your spells, at least the ones sold on the vendors and LEARN how to use them.  Look them up on &lt;a href=&quot;http://lucy.fnord.net/&quot; target=&quot;top&quot;&gt;Lucy&lt;/a&gt;.  Groups need you, they depend on you.  Don't suck.  Go read &lt;a href=&quot;http://gameglow.eqclerics.com&quot; target=&quot;top&quot;&gt;EQClerics&lt;/a&gt; and learn how to be a good cleric.  <br />
<br />
Speaking of saving mana, use Mark of Kings/Karn!  75 mana to prevent what can add up to a thousands of hit points of damage or more taken by people duel weilding from damage shields.  I had a cleric using a 1100 mana spell to heal up damage shield damage rather than spend 75 mana to prevent the damage in the first place.   Guess what, she was oom constantly... no friggin' duh!<br />
<br />
By all means, use Yaulp and hammer if you can spare the mana.  Load up nukes.  I'm pretty convinced that my groups where the cleric is attentive, knows WTF they're doing and are meleeing we do a hell of a lot better.  I think cleric DPS on undead meleeing is pretty significant, but I haven't parsed it.<br />
<br />
If you can't sit because of aggro, use Yaulp to regain mana.<br />
<br />
&lt;strong&gt;Enchanters&lt;/strong&gt;  Another class I see going oom all the time in LDoN.   It might be more mana effecient for you to do Pacify pulls and use your 50% slow (tepid deeds), keep your mana-sucking spells ready to drain casters.   50% slow is enough for any tank that isn't just horrible.  Tepid deeds casts much faster and uses only 100 mana.   If someone in your group can slow, bard, shammy, necro, beastlord, ask them to do it!<br />
<br />
Come on don't be a wuss!  Chain pull for your group!  It might be easier on the mana than trying to mez lots of adds.  Also, a lot of enchanters root their mezzed mobs so they don't bounce onto them when mez is broken.  <br />
<br />
Other enchanters recommend using Apathy if you must mez in the normal dungeons.  It should work on all the mezzable mobs (excluding bosses).  Sleep is more expensive.<br />
<br />
Also, keep Guard of Druzzil or GRM up.  I see people getting rooted, mezzed, and charmed that should have resisted it if you'd been keeping resist magic up.  Shame on you!<br />
<br />
&lt;strong&gt;Debuffs&lt;/strong&gt; Consider skipping debuffs.  Short fights really might not warrant the mana expenditure versus the occassional resisted nuke and insane aggro of some debuffs.  If your group is killing slowly, might make sense &lt;em&gt;if&lt;/em&gt; you can do it and manage your aggro.  If you're grouped with a shammy, just ask them to use their unresistable debuff.  <br />
<br />
&lt;span style=&quot;color:red;font-family:courier;font-size:x-large;&quot;&gt;Damage&lt;/span&gt;<br />
<br />
Nuke, don't dot!  In average groups (yes, I've timed the kills) it takes about 45 seconds to kill a mob.  In good groups, it takes 30 seconds.  In cooking groups it takes 15-20 seconds.  In slow groups, it takes 1 minute or more.  Most dots, especially the ones you cast from gear, just don't work fast enough to warrant casting.  Only dot if you're lowish on mana or unless you have REALLY fast acting dots.  Otherwise the mob is dead and you've done only a couple hundred damage.  <br />
<br />
<br />
&lt;strong&gt;No Ping-Pong&lt;/strong&gt;<br />
If you are nuking don't cause ping pong.  If you want to ride the aggro envelope, go stand right next to the tank, shoulder to shoulder.  You can be causing your group a lot of DPS loss if you make the mob bounce to you.  While your meleers go chasing it all over the room.  Your rogue is missing backstabs when you cause the mob to turn or run off, your meleer damage is reduced to 0 for N seconds.  And besides, it makes me hate you.  Try rains again.<br />
<br />
Use root situationally.  Most meleers aren't aware that you have rooted a mob (I am, because I use EQWatcher to alert me to the root message) if you root a mob it'll turn on the closest person causing the wrong person to tank, and possible loss of DPS from roguely sorts.<br />
<br />
&lt;span style=&quot;color:red;font-family:courier;font-size:x-large;&quot;&gt;Misc&lt;/span&gt;<br />
<br />
&lt;strong&gt;Warriors&lt;/strong&gt;, get some of those +aggro procs asap.  Even if they're the cheapie ones, you can upgrade later.   Don't taunt 3 times before breaking mez, that's just too slow.  You're adding a good 18 seconds to the kill time for each mob.<br />
<br />
For Pete's sake, use defensive or evasive when you have an enormous pull.  Don't wait until you're at 5% hit points.  You might survive, but the cleric will die trying to keep you alive.<br />
<br />
&lt;strong&gt;Meleers&lt;/strong&gt; Watch your positioning!  Don't push things up walls where no one can touch them and the rogues can't get to their back.  Don't push things into corners.  If you're not the MT and you got aggro, get rid of it!  Jolt, FD, evade, turn off auto-attack, whatever, just do it.  You're going to screw up DPS and cause the healers to sink a ton of mana into you.  Tanks, use sit aggro to move mobs if necessary.<br />
<br />
&lt;strong&gt;Pet Classes&lt;/strong&gt; Be ready to back off your pets when the positioning is so screwed up no one can hit the mob.  There's nothing more annoying than everyone backing off the mob, except the pet... waiting for the mob to move. <br />
<br />
<br />
&lt;strong&gt;Casters&lt;/strong&gt; Bind outside the dungeon for faster recovery.  Especially if you're in a marginal group and suspect things might go badly.  (I really need to take my own advise :p                 )  At the very very worst, bind at the camp!  If you have to run back from PoK, you suck.<br />
<br />
&lt;strong&gt;Loot and Scoot&lt;/strong&gt; Don't worry about resses until the adventure is over.  Leave something on the corpse.<br />
<br />
&lt;strong&gt;Buffing&lt;/strong&gt; Do the buffing before you accept the mission, unless you have a really short duration buff.  No reason not to do Virtue and most of the buffs early and be ready to zone in after accepting the mission.  It's stupid to have to med up outside the dungeon for 5 minutes because you didn't cast a 2-hour long buff 10 minutes earlier.<br />
<br />
Be in range for group buffs.  Sheesh... I can't tell you how many times I've logged on my shammy said, in group, &quot;Ok, come close, time for shammy buffs&quot;, cast the buffs and some doofus was chasing after a skunk or something.<br />
<br />
&lt;strong&gt;Do the Math&lt;/strong&gt;<br />
If you have to kill 60 mobs to win you need to kill a mob every 1.5 minutes.  Use alt-v to see how you're doing and adjust your technique if you're too slow.   Try to finish with a good 20 minutes left over, so if you have a wipeout or other problem you have wiggle room.<br />
<br />
&lt;strong&gt;Give Up&lt;/strong&gt;<br />
If you are on a slaughter 60 mission and during the first 20 minutes you haven't killed 15 mobs then it might be best to concede defeat and reform with a different group and not waste so much time on a loss. <br />
<br />
&lt;strong&gt;Stick to Slaughter X&lt;/strong&gt;<br />
<br />
Unless you have people you trust to work together well, I would only do slaughter missions.  There are too many things that can go wrong with the other missions and some of the simpletons that join pickup groups will do incredibly stupid things that will make you fail.  They will anyway, but at least you're reducing the number of possible problems to a smaller set.<br />
<br />
&lt;strong&gt;Beware of Assassinate if...&lt;/strong&gt;<br />
...you don't have anyone to pacify or any really solid crowd control.  Here's why.  In some of the missions the assassinate target can be surrounded by 4 or so mobs that are linked.  In fact, tonight in a group that was easily winning the dungeon, we lost the entire adventure because we couldn't easily kill the adds.  4 adds and the boss was too much.  In fact, we did manage to single out the boss, but it ended up Gating back at the end.  We just didn't have the juice to be able to unload so it wouldn't gate.  After that, we tried twice more to pull it, but the puller couldn't get it to work again and the group finally gave up.   That particular adventure had an assassinate target of The FleshSomething, it was a big nasty enchanter spider.   Other assassinate adventures can be quite simple.<br />
<br />
&lt;strong&gt;Leave the Boxes and Barrels and People Lying on the Floor Alone!&lt;/strong&gt;<br />
<br />
You can come back and play with them.  Actually though, it doesn't hurt for the MT to go beat up a person/thing lying on the floor IF they are full hit points.  It's the low hit point ones that turn into something ugly usually.  After the adventure is completed, you can play with the boxes and chests.<br />
<br />
&lt;strong&gt;Maps&lt;/strong&gt;<br />
<br />
Well, some people don't like 'em, but if you want Teh Win, you'd probably better use 'em.  Going the wrong way to reach a boss can pretty much guarantee you a loss with a less than uber group.<br />
<br />
&lt;strong&gt;Eyeballs&lt;/strong&gt;<br />
<br />
You can use those ever so handy bloodshot eyeballs to figure out how to break the next room, acquire a target for someone to pacify, and to go scout for the boss.<br />
<br />
&lt;strong&gt;Don't Follow The Rogue!&lt;/strong&gt;<br />
<br />
I've had this happen.  I'm scouting ahead for traps or the boss and someone follows me into a room full of mobs!  Doh!<br />
<br />
&lt;strong&gt;Someone Snare!&lt;/strong&gt;<br />
Just like in good old Kunark dungeons, the mobs can SoW themselves inside, being exempt from the rules that govern us.  Having a SoW mob run into a room of mobs is disasterous!  Make sure someone is snaring!  And that someone needs to pay attention to their resist messages.  I make my resist messages a bright red so I don't miss them.  I also use &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.eqwatcher.com&quot; target=&quot;top&quot;&gt;EQWatcher&lt;/a&gt; so when I do get a resist I hear a voice saying &quot;resisted&quot;.  That verbal prompt is oh, so useful!</div></div><hr />

That is by far the most efficient way for a druid to do dmg, but it does require a good tank (pref a high guild warrior with good hate procs).<br />
<br />
This method also works with multitanking, or pet tanking.  Get 2 or 3 mobs clustered together, one melee on each.  Rain them to hell.  Works great.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Here's my new rule - no pickup groups without:<br />
 a) crowd control &lt;strong&gt;OR&lt;/strong&gt;<br />
 b) cleric &lt;strong&gt;OR&lt;/strong&gt;<br />
 c) slow<br />
<br />
At level 62, I heal about as well as a level 53 cleric (Nature's Touch vs Divine Light) if one player is taking the hits.  If we get multiples and mobs start banging on casters, I'm going to lose people.  I can't heal fast enough to save them. :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Talura cwnZeylon</div><div class="date">09-23-2003, 12:46 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Would recommend avoiding low count collection missions. They look good on the screen, but when you hit the dungeon the drops are scattered over the same number of mobs that a higher collect would have...therefore you get a poor drop rate. Sucks to fail a mission by 1 drop and 10 seconds when your group's been tearing the dungeon up. It seems like the break point is around 28 items, but not sure.<br />
<br />
Also, on pullers I'd recommend a listing for sk's as they have no-damage agro spells (terror line), and a decent arsenal of fast-agro and sustained-agro spells. I've pulled using my shaman before...an interesting experience, and one I wouldn't hesitate to do again as long as I had a cleric backing me up.<br />
<br />
If you're losing due to PUGs, try to build a stable base of a couple of people you know/trust and add unknowns to fill in the gaps. IME half a group that works well together can compensate for the half a group that screws up.</div></div><hr />

Pacification works up to level 65.  On level 65 Adventures, all the mobs (except the greenies and pets) leave 30 minute corpses so that means they are level 55+.  I'd venture to guess that all the mobs are 56+ generally so that rules out Paladin pacifying.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Guythebastard</div><div class="date">09-23-2003, 03:11 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Good guide there - I read a lot of Electrae's (Panamah's Clr alt I believe) posts on the Cleric boards - generally sane and sage advise. <br />
<br />
Must say though, as someone who plays a monk and cleric as mains (usually boxed) the fact that you didn't even mention monks &lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration:underline&quot;&gt;once&lt;/span&gt;, even in the pulling guide, made my eyes bleed!!!<br />
<br />
About half the time my monk pulls and tanks, sometimes just pulls. Never bother single pulling unless clearing around a named, but FD is still a good &quot;get out of jail&quot; card if you get an overpull - say more than 3 mobs for most groups. A real key is to make your group keep moving with you for speed - I have even made a &quot;group move forward&quot; hotkey.<br />
<br />
When I'm 2 boxing, I'll bring my cleric up for a Pacification when there's a tightly packed group of mobs, and start throwing my monk's shuriken just as it's about to hit - works very well, but needs good communication between the person lulling and pulling.<br />
<br />
Have found druids an excellent choice for healing in LDoN btw, clerics are often overkill on the healing side and can sometimes be a bit backwards on adding their DPS when things are going well. <br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Quelm</div><div class="date">09-23-2003, 04:08 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">A few things:<br />
<br />
Avoid boxes until after the mission is complete.  4k AEs, mob-spawning traps, and curses are just some of the fun things to be found in chests.  If you're really lucky you might find a +6 aug of some sort.  Just remember where they are and come back later.<br />
<br />
Remember getting set up for the trials?  The same guidelines apply here.  Maximize mana regen by picking up kei+ and spiritual purity if you can.  Pick up mage items to cover any holes in your focus item lineup.<br />
<br />
Hard missions have some nice loot.  So nice, IMO, that folks with no elemental access should consider attempting hard missions for a shot at it, regardless of their chances of finishing the mission.  In 2 hard missions last night, I saw the following: <br />
dru/mnk/bst gloves with 17 ac, 85hp/mana and about 10 sta/wis/agi, <br />
a caster/priest range item with 65 hp, 100 mana, FT1 and more stats,<br />
a melee ring with 90 hps, 70 mana, regen II and stats,<br />
and.... a crappy 39/33? monk hammer with a rec. level of 65.<br />
<br />
Considering the point investments required to create items with similar stats, hard missions seem like a more efficient route towards gearing up friends and guildmates in LDoN.  The depth of the loot tables in the different themes will ultimately decide if this is the case.</div></div><hr />

If I cast a stun on the same mob, I'll pull the whole room. I think physical attacks have smaller 'splash' aggro than spells do. Of course, I have no idea if that even exists or if it's true or not, but it's pretty much the way I've been pulling.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I think there are 3 problems we have seen with monks pulling in LDoN are:<br />
<br />
  1. Time - FD Pulling seems to take more time then Pacifying, but it is probally a wash in a big room.<br />
<br />
  2.  Casters - They seem to load up some rooms with casters with the sole purpouse of getting the Monks.<br />
<br />
  3. Space - Without repops this is not really an issue if you can keep your group under control, but it still comes up now and again.<br />
<br />
I think  paci is the best option, but Monks will work in a pinch.<br />
<br />
On another note.<br />
<br />
I could not agree more, Slaughter missions are the way to go, unless you just get bored with them.  With slaughter missions you have the most control over what is happening.  All of the other ones have too many variables that boil down to luck.<br />
<br />
If someone dies, keep going while they are on their way back if it is at all possible.  Just make sure you know who is missing and someone knows they are covering another role.<br />

<br />
A Mage/Druid or Mage/Wizard combo can pull &lt;em&gt;extremely&lt;/em&gt; effectively if the Mage has tons of plat, and doesn't mind spending some extra mana.<br />
<br />
1) Druid/Wizard:  Snare 1 mob, start running for the group, but stay some distance away - don't let anyone aggro.<br />
2) Druid/Wizard:  Egress/Abscond (or whatever it is)<br />
3) Mage:  CoH the Druid/Wizard<br />
<br />
When the Druid/Wiz has been sucked back to the group, you've got a nicely snared mob all alone, as the other have wandered back.<br />
<br />
This method can often split very tough-to-split groupings quite easily.  If you pick your targets (ie: middle guys) then you can often pull the regular way the next round, cuz they're far enough away from each other.<br />
<br />
If you're close to the entrance you can do away with the CoH, just run back.   Meanwhile a tank/hybrid can snatch that snared mob.<br />

It's for the ones that can't make it through the easy mode.  As far as pulls go, a lot of the groups I've been in could barely, handle 3 mobs at once.<br />
<br />
Contasting that though, I was in a guild group tonight.  War, cleric (my 2nd box), rogue (me), Beastlord, 2 rangers.  My cleric never medded, nuked fairly frequently and had absolutely no problems with pulls of 3-4.  Because, I think, Divine Arbitration is the rule!  Can't wait until she gets CR. :p</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'm a paladin so the tanking section is from that perspective.<br />
<br />
&lt;strong&gt;Mission selection&lt;/strong&gt;<br />
If you are going with people you are unsure of, hold out for a slaughter mission to see how they do.<br />
<br />
If you haven't got a slower of any kind, don't do an assassination.<br />
<br />
I have had fairly good luck with collections of 28 or more.  (100% success on 28+ collect.)<br />
<br />
If you know who your with and you usually do well, go ahead and take a rescue.<br />
<br />
<br />
&lt;strong&gt;Group makeup&lt;/strong&gt;<br />
<br />
I like to try to work with what I get.  As you can imagine, it doesn't always work.<br />
<br />
You need damage output, healing, someone to pull.   Level 65 paladins can't pacify anything in the dungeons they will be going to.  Use root (preferably greater immobilize or if your lucky or rich the tunare one).<br />
<br />
&lt;strong&gt;General strategy&lt;/strong&gt;<br />
Use all your tricks.   I haven't had to swap my normal spell around as much as I do in LDON since I was level 30 when Cazic Thule was for level 30s.  I use remove curse, crusader's touch, pious might and my self haste quite often.<br />
<br />
A new trick I started last night was to coordinate with the cleric (if we have one) on heals.  I can dump a heal over time on a target and the cleric can land a direct heal.  The result is more healing and no one wasting mana which is what usually happens when I try to help out on healing.  I admit this was far easier since the player of the cleric was physically in the same room and I can just talk to her.<br />
<br />
For the love of all that is holy, snare those mobs.  In Takish there are a number of druid mobs and they sow (I guess they can cast it indoors where we can't) their friends.  Those things take off like wildfire at 10% and if I fizzle my stuns twice in a row and it gets around a corner, your going to have 10 kinds of hell coming back toward you.  Quite often I can stun the runner and we can kill it, but it only takes one mess up to put a dampner on an otherwise good run.  If you play with me, you might get used to not seeing a mob run because I have a stun key and I'm on the ball.  If you get a paladin that doesn't stun next time or just isn't as observant, your going to see what I mean about 10 kinds of hell.<br />
<br />
For the tank, have AC and HP.  I ride about 5k-6k hp.  If we are lucky and have both a shaman and a cleric, I can get just above 6khp.<br />
<br />
Help the slower out.  Sometimes there are three mobs in camp or the current mob is resisting.  Stunning the target is essentially like a very short duration slow.  I have one button I press that cycles my stuns.  If any of my stun gems are lit I can mash the button and one of them will go off.  This helps in many situations.  It stops casting (CH mobs are a real pain), it stops gating (another source of 10 hells), it stops runners, it grabs aggro, it slows the rate at which mobs hit.<br />
<br />
Do whatever you can to contribute damage.  If you have VOQ and Aura on and even with helping out with stuns and heals still riding at 100% mana much of the time, use that flame of light.  Don't forget to put on any damage shields you can.  I use the coldain ring 9.  Buy potions, ask the mage or druid or ranger for a ds.  Every little bit helps.<br />
<br />
Don't hit the trees or people lying on the floor.  Sure you can get a benefit but if you get a bad one it may make the difference between winning and losing.<br />
<br />
Don't touch the interactive objects.  When your done, you can but they still aren't worth it.  Have DA, crusader's touch and remove curse memmed.  Hit DA when the jack-ass of the group wants to fiddle with the chest and hopefully they will be done with their fun before it wears off.  Then you can cure/remove and heal everyone.<br />
<br />
OH, and don't overlook your healing wave.  It will help when you get to that room of 5 mobs and one resists a lull or they otherwise all come running.  With a KEI and Aura, you can cast quite a few of them.<br />
<br />
/disc holy when you get to the boss in an assassination or at some point during the other missions.  For a short time, you'll do a little more damage and every bit counts.<br />
<br />
We had a group where the cleric was swinging the hammer and using the hammer pet.  The shadowknight popped out his skeleton pet, the druid even used his little bear pet.  Everything counts.<br />
<br />
Avoid the Sunken Library on normal unless you know you can take 902 point hits.   Right now its bugged in that the first earthen defender is hitting for 902 points on a normal difficulty.<br />
<br />
Alright you don't have to avoid it, but know its coming and prepare.</div></div><hr />

The mob just sits there for 10 seconds drooling and you're losing time.[/quote]<br />
<br />
Well, a good paladin pulls with Cease (1 second duration) or Divine Stun (low aggro, 1 second duration). Follow up with a longer stun when the mob reaches camp to start establishing aggro.<br />
<br />
On the other hand, if you're pulling 2 mobs at once (I try to get 2 and only 2 on each pull), stun one with a longer duration stun (FoA) and then switch targets and hit the other with Cease/Divine Stun. Run back to camp and hit the one following you with FoA. This helps to get aggro on both before they are in camp.<br />
<br />
As mentioned, Pacify can't be used in 65th level dungeons, though it does work on some mobs in 60th level dungeons.<br />
<br />
Our regular experience group varies from 62nd to 65th level and from about 20 AA's to 180 AA's. We always get 65th level dungeons and they are a challenge to complete. However, I'm starting to preface that with the fact that we still take assassinate and rescue missions and have NEVER gotten an exterminate mission; I think that has something to do with why we perceive successes to be harder to come by than many other people. We've had only 1 outright loss where we couldn't even finish during the extra 30 minutes but have had 4 losses where we finished within 5 minutes of the timer going off (one was a collect mission where we got our last item about 2 minutes after the timer, one was a rescue mission where we needed, oh, 45 more seconds to get the stupid dwarf back to the zone).<br />
<br />
A couple of things we've been doing:<br />
<br />
If there's only 2 mobs, I can tank both with no problems. Three is a struggle, so we sometimes offtank it (let damage shield and ripostes work on it instead of just letting it sit there mezzed or rooted, when possible).<br />
<br />
If my druid is in the group, I have him DoT the adds but not the main target. In that case, the DoTs do get their full duration and I've yet to have one resisted. On the other hand, both Moonfire and Summer's Flame are resisted fairly frequently (he's 64 now) unless debuffed; the problem is that the time spent debuffing is time not spent doing damage, so I've given up on debuffing and just eat the resists that happen. (Dotting the adds requires a tank who can keep aggro on the extras, of course.)<br />
<br />
Against undead, it's worthwhile for a paladin to nuke with Deny Undead, mana permitting. One cast in a 45 second fight adds 14.5 DPS, which is really significant to most paladins.<br />
<br />
Your tip on mana management is well taken and it's a habit I'm trying to unlearn. I usually try to keep my druid's mana around 75-80% and parcel out the nukes, etc. on that basis but there are too many times where it creeps up to full mana (and my druid has only FT1 and MC2). I'm becoming much more willing to nuke away a chunk of mana in LDoN due to the fact that failing is bad, so saving for an emergency takes on a different light.<br />
<br />
I still very much feel like we're learning - the timer has introduced a new factor and requires new tactics (we don't raid, so steady experience over time has been the usual goal). It has shifted my AA strategy to the DPS side (already had Slay Undead and a few other offensive aa skills, but I had planned on focusing on healing for a while - now I'm anxious to scrape up all the DPS I can get).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ThicketTundrabog</div><div class="date">09-24-2003, 05:53 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Another suggestion. Get a map. They are especially useful for rescue and assassination missions. The mob spawn point is usually obvious. At worst, you clear a path through the zone (forget the dead ends) that will make your final run to the mob easy. When you kill sixty percent of the mobs, you will know which direction your rescue/assassination target is.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Leana Soulwarden</div><div class="date">09-24-2003, 05:54 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Your guide is pretty good.  I’d like to make some comments and recommendations.<br />
<br />
I am a 65 cleric, and I pull for about 2/3 of the groups I go with.  If I am pulling, then my low DPS will not be a significant handicap to the party.  Someone else, who would otherwise be pulling, can continue fighting, which is beneficial to the party.  By single pulling most of the time, I can conserve CC mana, and even cut down on the mana I would otherwise spend on healing.<br />
<br />
Pacification does eat a lot of mana, but I find I can generally pull and heal the group fairly well.  The risky part is when a roamer is parked in a doorway, or you have to step into a room to target the mobs close to the door.  Then, you sometimes get three pulls.<br />
<br />
Unless I am stunned, three pulls are not a problem, DB and DA provide ample escape mechanism for me to bring the mobs to the group and dump agro.  There are rare cases where I am stunned or my DB and DA are already used and I cannot clear agro.  Then I rely on Divine Arbitration to save me.  I can reliably tank one mob and can somewhat tank two for sufficient time for them to be mezzed, rooted, or slowed.  <br />
<br />
An important thing to know is how well your group can handle multiple pulls.  If your party can rip through three mobs at a time, there is no real reason to pacify every mob in the room.  Even if the group can only handle one at a time, generally 2-3 pacifies will break the room up so that every mob can be single pulled.<br />
<br />
If I am low on mana, I sometimes direct pulls instead and med.  “Pull right, then left, then middle when ready.” ---or--- “Pull at will.”<br />
<br />
Some other suggestions:<br />
<br />
Print off the maps.  Nothing is more frustrating as hearing the mob is NW of you not knowing whether to take the east or the south exit from the room in order to get to him.  With maps, you generally have a fair idea from the very beginning where the boss mob may spawn.  You can start clearing towards him from the start.<br />
<br />
Mission difficulty going from least to most is slaughter, assassinate, escort, collect.  I don’t mind doing any of the first three, and in fact like variety in my missions.  I resent losing a mission when you have killed 95% of the mobs in the dungeon, so I avoid collect.  If your group has decent DPS and maps, then escort is no more difficult than assassinate.  The advantage on assassinate is that if you run very low on time, you can pacify past some mobs without killing them.<br />
<br />
If you have plenty of time, clear the mobs on the way to your objective.  If you wipe, it is far safer not having mobs in the way.<br />
<br />
Allow time for a wipe on the boss mob when doing assassinate missions.  We had a group that started pulling his room with over 30 minutes to spare.  We wiped twice and won the adventure with under one minute left.<br />
Trackers are nice.  Some of the loot off named is nice, even for reasonably equipped players (non planar).  Trackers can tell you when a named is up.  Maps can be used to locate generally where the mob is.<br />
<br />
Don’t forget your mage when trying to find your target.  They can send out an eye to locate them.  Consider purchasing a few stalking probes if you are having difficulties location the boss mobs.  <br />
<br />
Sometimes rogues can scout, but traps add a risk factor for this type of scouting.<br />
<br />
Some people consider chests to be a waste of time.  I don’t.  But they are definitely something to deal with after you have won the mission.  Drops I have seen from chests include: 2 dex augments, 1 wis augment, 1 hp augment, 1 str augment, blue diamonds, black sapphires, and trinkets…  lots of trinkets.<br />
<br />
Get your trap spells when you can.  You can always augury a chest with no risk of setting off the trap.  It will tell you if it is in your domain to open.  If it is, you can open it with no risk.  If not, then someone else in your party may be able to open it with little or no risk.  If no one can open it, you can decide whether to open it or not.  Prior to doing that, ready your spells for recovery, 450 damage dots hurt a lot.<br />

ARGH! Druids can make good pullers too. Of course there's a few others that do it better because of the spells or skills they have available but it's possible.<br />
<br />
Druids actually kind of shine in LDoN as people have mentioned before. Why? Because of our much vaunted 'utility'. Gasp! Finally it comes into play. Druids heal well enough to be primary in these dungeons. I've only had a cleric in my group a few times out of 30 adventures so far. We really shine with our utility because we can add at least somewhat decent DPS along with the healing. Some of it depends on group makeup though. I wasn't able to add a lot of DPS in a group I had last night because it was mostly all rangers and a paladin with so-so defense. Only had one death because of a OOR bad pull. Last night was also the first time I ever had mana problems because of all the healing I was doing. Had to sit and med twice for a couple minutes. Druids can also do crowd control in a pinch with root/snare. I end up doing it a lot in fact if we have a bunch in camp, especially if there's one or two on me, hehe. SotW and RC are also your friends in LDoN, even though there are a couple curses that don't clear with one casting of RC.</div></div><hr />

<br />
In undead based dungeons such as mistmoore, I am usually in charge of slows on the undead mobs, which is often the bulk of the mobs. Necro slow is 70% at lvl 60, and equal to enchanter slow at level 60. I pull with slow as its cheap and necros never run out of mana. If it looks like multiples i just drop a mez on 1 so the other comes, then while fight is on i get rdy for mezx to break 30 sec later and for mob to come join in after slowing it while mezzed.<br />
<br />
Each fight I am usually out looking for the next pull as soon as the current one is about halfway down.<br />
<br />
Most important tip is to keep moving, don't wait for the puller to bring the mob to you, the grroup should always be in the room just before the room being pulled. Clear the room, move in, clear next room, move in, etc.</div></div><hr />

FD is real unreliable, especially around wanderers. I've heard some stories about monks getting up and 10 mobs rushing them. And trying to separate mobs with FD is just too slow for the most part, especially for groups that are like the ones we're concerned with here. I think probably monks might be able to do some sneak pulling though, and always abort if a pull is hugely bad. But... if they slow the group down too much be prepared to try something different.&quot;<br />
<br />
With all due respect, Panamah, you are way off here.  I have found that my monk can pull faster than, while just as safely as, any class other than bards in LDoN.  Enchanters would run a close third, with other pacify casters a tad behind that.  After that point, anyone who knows how to pull well can pull just fine.<br />
<br />
It's just a question of knowing what you are doing, like everything else in LDoN adventures.  People with poor group and/or dungeons skills will not be able to pull dungeons quickly or efficiently.<br />

Here's my freshly written monk guide on the subject ;)    ...<br />

The only time I don't debuff are the times when there's so much DPS you don't really have the extra time to debuff. Otherwise I think it's worth it. Those resists you get translate into a little med time here and there down the road because of the wasted mana so I think it's still more efficient to debuff first. Tak dungeons are even more efficient for druid nuking because of the lower casting time and mana of Destroy Summoned(for those high enough).</div></div><hr />

Nope.  It's 55 and up.  That's why Zordakilius Ragefire's corpse would poof in 8 minutes when he was spawnable in SolB.  He was always level 54 back then.</div></div><hr />

A caster that has LoS on you will stand there and unload every spell in its arsenal on you before running up to fight.  If you move out of LoS the caster will be forced to move up to where you want to fight it.  Standing still and plinking arrows at a caster while it chain nukes you is not an effective means of clearing a dungeon.  :)   (Ok, maybe if you have 4 Rangers in the party...) <br />
<br />
As for Monks pulling, I would say a lot of them have advantage in terms of player skill because they're used to being pullers.  However, FD is at best only a marginaly useful tool in LDoN.  If you're monk insists on FD splitting every pull, you're probably going to lose.  <br />
<br />
Oh, and the reason runners can be so bad in certain themes is because of SoS (Spirit of Shrew) which is the indoor version of SoW that came with the expansion.  Takis (Druids) and Ruk (Shamans) seem to be particularly bad for runners.  I haven't tried Guk yet, but haven't seen signs of SoS in either Mriagul's or Mistmoore (plus most mobs in Mistmoore don't run anyways).</div></div><hr />

<br />
The FD issue is controversial.  Maybe there's just too many bad monks out there.   But not only do you have to have a skilled monk puller, but an attentive tank that can tag off him or her.  I think any pickup group needs to do some quick evaluation of people's skills and make changes in their startegy if someone isn't playing up to snuff.<br />
<br />
But sure, a skilled monk puller that isn't pulling at a snail's pace and some how is avoiding lots of adds, is going to be welcomed in groups struggling to complete adventures in LDoN.<br />
<br />
In the old expansion NPC's got to use SoW indoors.  Only the players had the limitation. :(     I'd be surprised if in LDoN that is different.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I will admit, it takes less skill to make pacify work for a pickup group with little to no dungeon experience.  However, that's the beauty of LDoN...this glaring gap in skillsets may finally start to be rectified.<br />
<br />
You should still retract your monk FD comments, though.  If you read your guide, it's the only section that is rather obviously subjective and potentially biased.<br />
<br />
Maybe I need to head to safehouse and post about how rogues should not be invited to LDoN groups because they always set off traps that kill or cause long delays even when they are told to leave them til the end.  Oops, wait, only bad rogues do that :) , so I would never tar you with the same brush.<br />

<br />
I did modify the monk one because I read the monk's guide that and agreed, if the monk (or other FD'r) is good and experienced puller, they're an excellent choice for the job. <br />
<br />
My one admonition is that no matter who does the pulling, if they're being slow about it, they gotta either step it up or let someone else do it.  However, that was all covered in the monk guide.  Any monk that can perform to that level should be the defacto puller, for sure.<br />
<br />
It doesn't take a whole lot of skill to be able to pacify pull.  You've got to target a few mobs, cast pacify, then use your pulling spell.  Whereas I think it probably takes a fair amount of skill to pull well if you're a monk.  Skillz have been in short supply in some of the Pickup groups I've been in recently.  /sigh  <br />
<br />
As far as learning how to excell in LDoN, I think the PoJ trials and level 50-60 spent in Kunark dungeons taught me all that.  In PoJ you had to maximize your DPS.  In Kunark dungeons, you had tricky pulls and sometimes massive crowd control to deal with.   This is sort of a little like both of them put together.  Those that never set foot in a dungeon until LDoN are just not gonna be up to snuff for awhile.</div></div><hr />

I saa strategy on echanter. If your talking highlvl grp, dazzle do not work to low. Samme with erea mezz.<br />
Enchanters dutys in LDoN are usaly c (if dispelled) haste/slow/mezz,pet dps if chanter has the aa nedded for it and pos pacify if pulling.<br />
Reason why enchanters go emty fast is usaly couse thers to many mobs in camp at once.(often this cant be helped but somtimes it can)<br />
here are some info on mana use in a highlvl grp ( 60+ grp)<br />
<br />
mezz = 450 mana to keep each mob mezzed 1,5 min.<br />
C (if dispeled)= around 1100 mana.<br />
Haste if under lvl 65 and no epic=350 mana pr person<br />
Slow  =225 mana pr mob<br />
Absorbskin(if attacked)=400mana (chanters have little hp and must usaly use it.<br />
More if resisted offcourse.<br />
<br />
If u look at the nrs thers 1 major drain, thats mezz.<br />
If you got a monk in party use him to pull 1-2 mobs at the time. <br />
Thers no point in having a monk that runs into room get whatever he can and run back, (which extremly many monks do in ldon) Better to have had a higher dps class then and have tank just run into room.<br />
<br />
Speed is wery importent in all LDoN grps, but you can only kill as fast as you have dps to do. keeping sevral mezzed mob<br />
in camp wile u kill= waste of mana for chanter. Mana that chanter could have used on nukes if mobs are pulled singles.<br />

Also bst lord/necro/bard in team is smart to help on mana.<br />
<br />
A tank that has good agro is also much better, having chanter stand til mobs are down to 50% hp couse he cant sit and med since agro is to high= little med time.(root as mentioned is a good trick to here. Dont yell at your chanter for rooting if u melle, thers usaly a reason like this why and he knows its not preferd by melle)<br />
<br />
Chanters dont have many slow spells do, cuting down mana use on that much would mean going down to 40% ich haste insted of 70 but u goto do what u goto do at times.<br />
<br />
Its a fine line  in LDoN how many you should pul at the time to advance quicly.  Dont drain your chanter to 0om within 10 min, it can easly be done =) med time is costy.<br />
<br />
Bests advice i can give is make sure chanter and puller talk  with eachother, when chanter has much mana pull 2-3 mobs and dont waste time on getting 1, but when chanter is geting low pul singles til he gets up mana.<br />
<br />
Mezz is much more costy in mana then most think. <br />
If you are a puller and pull more then 4 mobs ever, i would have to say you have made an error and chanter can prob not deal with that many.<br />
<br />
Hope This helpes you and your team.<br />

I think Glamour of Kintaz should work though right?  125 mana.  That's a whole lot cheaper to cast than bliss at level 64 for 300 mana or sleep for 275.  Is there any particular reason you wouldn't use Glamour if it's cheaper?<br />
<br />
Tepid deeds is 50% slow and is only 100 mana with the advantage of (I have heard) being lower aggro and faster casting.  Therefore, you can sit and med sooner after slowing.<br />
<br />
I dunno, someone double check me.  I think enchanters should be using Glamour if mana is tight.  Use Tepid deeds if your mana is still tight.  <br />

<br />
The level limit for GoK is 57...are the mobs in level 65 dungeons really that low?  When I was 56 I saw some white to me in a high 50s, low 60s group so I'd imagine not everything in a 65 dungeon could be mezzed with GoK.  Most high level enchanters do seem to agree that apathy (225 mana, mezzes up to level 62) is the best choice.  I'd imagine sleep and bliss are a waste.<br />
<br />
In a good group, forlorn deeds (70% slow) is also a huge waste.  The mobs don't hit very hard and ideally they should be dead in 30 seconds or less.  I usually tash first because I seem to have resist problems otherwise, so it seemed that mobs were at 50% health or less by the time slow landed.  I switched to tepid deeds (nearly half the casting time and less than half the mana cost) and am much happier.  When multiple adds come I often don't have time to slow the main target at all and this doesn't seem to cause much of a problem.  Slow just isn't as important as in PoP.  <br />
<br />
Enchanters can also use Theft of Thought or Scryer's Trespass to gain mana.  Caster mobs seem common enough in the dungeons I've tried.  I'm only 57 but I haven't had many mana problems in LDoN on my enchanter. And I actually hope for more adds because that's what's fun for me.  <br />
<br />
A lot of people I know seem to have problems in LDoN because they are forming groups based on PoP rules.  LDoN is all about DPS.  And when you are talking about average equipped pickup people, you have to invite the best DPS classes you can find.  Inviting multiple tanks is inefficient, unless they have uber equipment or they are a paladin with slay3 in Mistmoore.  I cringe whenever I see multiple tanks in a group.  Also having both an enchanter and a shaman is inefficient, unless the enchanter has a charmed pet.  And personally I don't like having a charmed pet in a dungeon unless I have a cleric I trust.  <br />
<br />
Inviting classes who can add mana regen to the group will also help average equipped players to succeed.  You have to move around often, not sit on a wall medding as the mobs come to you. In addition to KEI, bard song, potg/9, beastlord crack, modrods and the necro group manataps all help a lot to keep you killing fast.</div></div><hr />

On Enchanters and Mezz.<br />
<br />
Nope levels are too high on mobs for GoK, have to use Apathy at least.  Even then if you can run into the problem of mobs being too high deeper in so Sleep is the best all purpose mezz for LDoN adventures and it is a mana pig.  Sytheres trespass helps a bit in keeping mana up as there is usually no shortage of casters to tap.  Unless you have lots of FT or Kitty crack, Bot9, Voq etc type uber regeneration, mana can become an issue quick if mezzing on every pull and slowing all with 70 pct slow.<br />
<br />
Pacification can save a whole lot of mana from mezzes.  The key is to keep ahead of the group.  Dont wait for the mob to be killed and the puller to look in the next room type to you that something needs to be pacified.  You should be looking there and already have the ones paced that need to be before the last mob is down so the puller (you or whoever) can just run to it or pull it with an arrow.<br />
<br />
Best situation of all however is to forgo the Enchanter (get crack before you come), bring a DPS class.  Use the Clerics pacification if you get the whole room who cares, evac.  With no respawn you loose what, about 20 seconds running back to the room?  Very different than evacing deep in seb where you have to clear your way back.  <br />
<br />
The other option is of course hoping to find one of the rare charmable mobs and having the Enchanter be a dps class.<br />

[/quote]<br />
<br />
Not really. Typical level 65 mission is kill 60 mobs with 15k hps in 90 minutes. That works out to 166 sustained DPS between all members of the group.  <br />
<br />
A single member of any DPS class can pretty much handle that by themselves, just as a single healer can handle all the healing and a single chanter/bard/monk/pacifier handle all the CC. All excess DPS does is let you finish early, or recover from a wipe. With more tanks/healers/cc you can avoid the wipe in the first place.<br />
<br />
So you need 1 tank, 1 healer, 1 DPS, 1 CC/puller and 2 spares. The job of the spares is to fill in wherever the group is weak, and to cover for anyone who goes LD/has to leave/turns out to be unable to play their class. Necros, druids, shamans, monks and beastlords make the best spares, but anyone who can fill 2 different roles (e.g. warriors or rangers who can tank and DPS) is ok. <br />
<br />
Follow that formula and a single dropout will never leave you unable to continue a mission again. Go with 1 tank 1 healer 1 CC DPSx3 and an early LD has a 50% chance of wrecking your mission irrecoverably.<br />

I can do 130-200+ dps a minute, probably average above 160.  But I sure as hell can't win a dungeon for a bad group.  Besides, 166 dps would take 1.5 minutes to kill something.  I find if you aren't killing a mob in under 1 minute you're going to lose because you have to factor in the amount of time it takes to get to the next mob.  That's time moving around the dungeon, pulling, etc.  And I think that's really where most groups fall down, is on the moving and pulling.<br />

The only time I don't debuff are the times when there's so much DPS you don't really have the extra time to debuff. Otherwise I think it's worth it. Those resists you get translate into a little med time here and there down the road because of the wasted mana so I think it's still more efficient to debuff first. [/quote]<br />
<br />
Well, let's apply some math to it instead of guessing (I'm curious myself).<br />
<br />
Assume you're using Summer's Flame and you have Ornate Gloves (average 10.5% mana savings, I believe) and a Mana Preservation IV item (5.5% to other spells, including Hand of Ro).<br />
<br />
Whether it's worth casting Hand of Ro depends on two factors:<br />
<br />
1. How many times you nuke each mob.<br />
2. How much of your damage is resisted.<br />
<br />
Let's take 3 cases: nuke each 3 times, nuke each twice, nuke each once.<br />
<br />
&lt;strong&gt;Nuke 3 times&lt;/strong&gt;<br />
3 SF + 1 HoR = 1109 mana for 5200 damage or 4.69 damage/mana<br />
3 SF = 953 mana for 5200  or 5.46 damage/mana<br />
<br />
That means that as long as mobs tend to resist 14% or more of your damage without hand of ro and zero percent when you do cast hand of ro, then it's worth casting the debuff.<br />
<br />
&lt;strong&gt;Nuke 2 times&lt;/strong&gt;<br />
2 SF + HoR = 791 mana for 2800 damage or 3.54 damage/mana<br />
2 SF = 635 mana for 2800 damage or 4.41 damage/mana<br />
<br />
If the mob resists more than 20% of your damage without HoR and never resists when you do cast it, then it's worth casting Hand of Ro.<br />
<br />
&lt;strong&gt;Nuke 1 time&lt;/strong&gt;<br />
1 SF + 1 HoR = 474 mana for 1400 damage or 2.95 damage/mana<br />
1 SF = 318 mana for 1400 damage or 4.4 damage/mana<br />
<br />
If the mob resists more than 33% of your damage without debuffing and never resists when you do debuff, then it's worth it to cast Hand of Ro.<br />
<br />
Now, I don't have any parse data to determine, on average, how often mobs in LDoN resist or how much they do resist (full or partial) when they do.<br />
<br />
I do know that spending 800+ mana per fight is hard for me to maintain, even if I'm not healing. If you assume even 1 minute per fight, you're spending 80 mana per tick to maintain that rate (if it's less than one minute &quot;per fight,&quot; then it is more mana per tick being spent).<br />
<br />
Anyway, it should be clear that the more nukes you can sustain casting (both because the fights are long enough and you can maintain the mana needed to do it), the more beneficial Hand of Ro becomes. In my groups even with relatively low DPS, I tend to cast 2 Summer's Flame per mob and sometimes less if I need to heal as well. Just based on my subjective experience, I'm not losing 20% of my damage to resists without casting Hand of Ro - I'm losing MAYBE 10%, but I'd have to parse it (which I'll try to do).</div></div><hr />

<br />
In the last normal difficulty assassination mission I did, the pick-up group I was in was working like a well-oiled machine with a warrior pulling and a cleric pacifying. It worked great for clearing our way back to our target with around 25 minutes to spare. The cleric would start off by pacifying a few mobs. Warrior pulls single. Mob is around 50%, cleric runs off to pacify to be ready for the next pull. Mob dies. Warrior pulls a single. Rinse, repeat. Using that arrangement, we were able to keep a quick, nearly constant rate of pulling up.<br />

Thats the eternal curse of the rogue, we are an excellent addition to a good group but we can never turn a bad group into a good group.<br />
<br />
You are right that realistically, you need to kill a mob in 60 seconds from engage to exp to be virtually sure of winning overall. But a single 150 DPS rogue can contribute 60% of the DPS needed to win. If the other 5 members do 20 DPS each, it's still a comfortable win. Of course, if they are brain dead idiots, you lose. Don't group with brain dead idiots twice.<br />
<br />
If a full group with a moderately-well-equipped hasted rogue in it loses, its not through lack of DPS. Whatever kept you from winning would probably have still kept you from winning if you had had 3 times the DPS.<br />

Of course only nuking without a debuff will beat out debuffing first IF the nukes land for full even without the debuff. It looks like your comparisons only take into account if the nuke hits full either way. If it doesn't then the efficiency(mana usage, dps) will drop for sure. I usually get in two nukes with a debuff. If you're only getting in one nuke a fight because your group has really good DPS then it probably isn't worth it. But with two or more nukes landing I would think it would be. You might not see the difference on every mob but overall you would if the inevitable resists are taken into account.</div></div><hr />

But our main problem wasn't so much pulling the boss as it was keeping it from gating back to the room we singled it out of.  Our druid was having a hard enough time keeping the tank healed that I don't think she could've spared any mana to unload on the boss.  However, we did have a wizard and a necro.

If it's likely to be resisted by the boss, then only normal mobs are likely to be hit by it.  If you allow enough room to egress before any of the mobs get within aggro range of the rest of the group, the boss should reset while several normal mobs stand around snared and unable to go back to their spawn points.</div></div><hr />

Side note: this is the kind of situation where quick evac AA's are useful (though not required) even if you have exodus. :)</div></div><hr />

Of course only nuking without a debuff will beat out debuffing first IF the nukes land for full even without the debuff. It looks like your comparisons only take into account if the nuke hits full either way. If it doesn't then the efficiency(mana usage, dps) will drop for sure. I usually get in two nukes with a debuff. If you're only getting in one nuke a fight because your group has really good DPS then it probably isn't worth it. But with two or more nukes landing I would think it would be. You might not see the difference on every mob but overall you would if the inevitable resists are taken into account. [/quote]<br />

No, what I used in the equations was not a chance of being completely resisted - if you read it again, it says the percentage of your damage that is resisted. In other words, take all of the instances you cast the spell and multiple by max damage. There's you denominator. Now take the damage you actually did. There's your numerator. That's the percentage I describe in my post.<br />
<br />
As I said, I don't have that parsed so I don't know what proportion of damage is being lost to resists. My subjective experience is that it's less than one third.<br />
<br />
Of course if you have multiple people casting fire nukes it makes a lot of sense to debuff, and the equations above would show that it's crazy not to debuff in that circumstance.<br />
<br />
Most of the time the mob just dies too fast. I completely understand that it's the &quot;long run&quot; that we're dealing with, which is where the &quot;percent of damage resisted&quot; figures into the analysis.</div></div><hr />
