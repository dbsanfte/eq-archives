Secrets of Ulduar<br />
<br />
    * Since discovering Ulduar in the Storm Peaks, adventurers have journeyed to the titan city to learn more about its mysterious past. Further exploration has revealed that the magnificent complex is above all a prison, intended to permanently confine the Old God of death, Yogg-Saron. This ancient horror has corrupted its guards, and now it is breaking through the last of its restraints. Faced with the peril of Yogg-Saron's imminent freedom, a band of mortals has made preparations for a sweeping assault on the city. Overcoming the legions of iron minions and towering defenses at the city's entrance will take tremendous strength, but even that great victory may not be enough to overcome the madness that dwells below.<br />
<br />
The Argent Tournament Begins!<br />
<br />
    * As the might of the Scourge wanes under the pressure of Azeroth’s heroes, the Argent Crusade have taken a foothold in Arthas’s back yard. Off the northeastern coast of Icecrown, the Argent Crusade have sounded the call for the most bold and brave adventurers of the Horde and Alliance to take part in the Argent Tournament. Representatives of all ten faction capitals, from Undercity to Exodar, have traveled to the tournament grounds to find champions among their heroes who will prepare for the inevitable battle against the enemy of all living beings, the Lich King.<br />
<br />
In Memoriam: Dave Arneson<br />
<br />
    * Blizzard Entertainment would like to dedicate Secrets of Ulduar in memory of Dave Arneson. We were greatly saddened by the news of Dave’s passing. His work, passion, and creativity helped give life to an entirely new genre of gaming, and our fondest memories of playing Dungeons &amp; Dragons continue to inspire us. Farewell, Dave, and thank you. You will be missed.<br />
<br />
General<br />
<br />
    * Due to significant talent tree revisions, all players will have their talent points reimbursed. Several new spells and abilities have been added for select classes. Players will need to visit their class trainer to learn new spells.<br />
    * All Ground Mounts may now swim without dismounting the rider. Flying Mounts still may NOT, and will dismount the rider upon entering water.<br />
    * The Argent Tournament, a permanent in-game event, has come to Icecrown. Players interested in taking part in this event should visit the Argent Pavilion located on the west side of the tournament grounds. Features include:<br />
          o New ways of gaining reputation with capital cities.<br />
          o All new daily quests, achievements and titles.<br />
          o New rare and epic items, tabards, pets, banners, faction shirts and mounts.<br />
          o Mounted combat, and much more to come!<br />
    * Players level 40 and higher will now be able to visit their trainer to pay a one-time fee and access the dual talent specialization feature.<br />
    * The achievement Brew of the Year has been removed from the Brewmaster meta-achievement. The achievement Brew of the Month has been added in its place.<br />

    * Applying a glyph no longer requires a Lexicon of Power. The same rules for switching between dual talent specializations now apply to switching glyphs and cannot be performed while in combat, Battlegrounds (except when Preparation is up), or Arenas (no exceptions).<br />
    * New music can be heard at the Argent Tournament grounds and in Ulduar.<br />
<br />
PvP<br />
<br />
    * Arenas<br />
          o Enemy Unit Frames: This feature is only available while in Arenas, with several options in the Interface Options.<br />
    * Battlegrounds<br />
          o Battleground quests “Concerted Efforts” (Alliance) and “For Great Honor” (Horde) now require an Alterac Valley Mark of Honor in addition to the current requirements. These quests now award more honor upon completion.<br />
          o Players will now be able to queue for battlegrounds from any location. Leaving a battleground will return you to the location from which you entered.<br />
          o Alterac Valley<br />
                + Drek’Thar, Vanndar Stormpike, the tower Heralds and Warmasters have received a hit point and damage upgrade in the level 80 version of Alterac Valley.<br />
          o Strand of the Ancients<br />
                + Capturing the Southern Graveyard will now automatically capture both the East and West Graveyards.<br />
                + Seaforium Barrels can now be looted while mounted, seen from anywhere in the zone, and found at the Central Graveyard.<br />
                + Teleporters can now be used while mounted and can now be seen from anywhere in the zone.<br />
    * Lake Wintergrasp<br />
          o Daily quests “Slay Them All!” (Horde) and “No Mercy for the Merciless” (Alliance) have had their PvP kill requirements reduced to 10 from 20. NPCs defending the fortress and south towers now count toward these dailies as well.<br />
          o The number of NPCs defending fortress has been increased.<br />
          o Siege Engines now have Steam Pressure as a resource type (replaces energy).<br />
          o The southern Siege Factories can be captured.<br />
          o The time between battles will be saved should a realm shut down. If Wintergrasp is active when a realm shuts down, the battle will restart from the beginning when the realm is once again live.<br />
          o Towers in Southern Wintergrasp now have more defensive cannons.<br />
<br />
Races: General<br />
<br />
    * Command (Orc Racial): Applies to shaman pets, and now correctly applies to death knight pets.<br />
    * Gift of the Naaru (Draenei Racial): The heal has been changed to an instant-cast heal-over-time.<br />
    * Stoneform (Dwarf Racial): No longer makes you immune to poison, disease and bleed effects for 8 seconds. Instead, using Stoneform will clear those effects when cast. Cooldown reduced to 2 minutes from 3 minutes.<br />
<br />
Classes: General<br />
<br />

    * Mana Regeneration: The amount of mana regeneration derived from intellect and spirit has been reduced by 40%; however, talents that allow for mana regeneration while in combat have been increased. As a result, in-combat regeneration for classes with those talents will stay the same, while out-of-combat regeneration will be lower.<br />
    * The shaman’s Fire Elemental and Spirit Wolves, mage’s Water Elemental and Mirror Images, and druid’s Treants have all gained avoidance from area-of-effect damage similar to what warlock and hunter pets already have.<br />
    * Taunts: All player or pet-generated taunts now have a shared diminish category. In addition, Taunt-type effects from pets and from classes other than death knight, druid, paladin, and warrior have been set such that bosses can be made immune to them while still affected by death knight, druid, paladin, and warrior taunts.</div></div><hr />

In addition, it will now only echo death knight spells whose primary purpose is dealing damage. This pet will no longer break stealth on nearby targets and attack them. Also corrected a bug making the effect last 8 seconds longer than intended.<br />
                + Death Coil: This spell will no longer sometimes cause the death knight to animate a swing twice.<br />

In order to end the effect, the player controlling the Risen Ghoul must right click on the unit portrait and dismiss the pet.

                + Beacon of Light: This spell no longer duplicates the heal on yourself if your target is currently immune to being healed due to being on a vehicle.

                + Blessing of Sanctuary: This spell can now overwrite a Greater Blessing of Sanctuary that has less than 10 minutes duration remaining.<br />
                + Blessing of Wisdom: It is no longer possible to have the icon for this spell and Greater Blessing of Wisdom active at the same time (which didn’t give any benefit, but was confusing).<br />
