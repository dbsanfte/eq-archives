Over 100,000 participants signed up for the stress test beta and connected to our servers to help us analyze performance under heavy loads. In conjunction with that, we ran a small contest as a means of allowing a large selection of dedicated stress testers to continue on into the closed beta test. The 720 players listed represent the winning stress testers. These characters achieved the highest level of experience for their race and class, per faction, on the server on which they were created. Congratulations! <br />
<br />
Blizzard has gotten around to posting the contest results for all to see.  Congratulations to all who won and welcome to the World of Warcraft Beta Test!<br />
