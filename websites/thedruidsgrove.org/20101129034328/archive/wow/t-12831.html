<br />
General<br />
<br />
    * All players will have their talent points reimbursed and will have access to new talents throughout their trees; this includes the 51-point talents. Several new spells and abilities have been added for all classes. Players will need to visit their class trainer to learn new spells.<br />
    * The Kirin Tor have made their move and so has Dalaran.Please watch your step around the crater that has been left behind!<br />
    * The Barber Shop has been implemented and you can now visit one of the Barber Shops in the major cities to change your appearance. Be sure to get your Shave and a Haircut!<br />
    * The all new Achievement System has been implemented and the Achievement panel can be accessed via the interface. While many achievements are not retroactive, we have done our best to credit as many as possible. Gamemasters will not be able to grant achievements for past accomplishements.<br />
    * Stormwind Harbor is now open for business.<br />
    * New towers have been added outside Of Orgrimmar and in Tirisfal Glades. Crews are currently at work to establish a new Zeppelin route to Northrend for your travel pleasure. Please no /spit off of the towers.<br />
    * A new entrance is now viewable in the Caverns of Time.<br />
    * Hit Rating, Critical Strike Rating, and Haste Rating now modify both melee attacks and spells.<br />
    * Spell casting and spell channeling pushback has been changed to the following:<br />
          o When casting a spell:<br />
                + The first and second hit will add .5 secs each to the cast time.<br />
                + All hits after the second will have no effect.<br />
          o When channeling a spell:<br />
                + The first and second hit reduces current duration by 25% of total duration each.<br />
                + All hits after the second will have no effect.<br />
          o Spellpower:<br />
                + All items and effects which grant bonuses to spell damage and spell healing are being consolidated into a single stat, Spellpower. This stat will appear with the same values found on items which grant &quot;increased spell damage and healing&quot; such as on typical Mage and Warlock itemization.<br />
                      # For classes which do not heal, they should see no change in the character sheet other than new tooltip wording.<br />
                + Healing characters will see their bonus healing numbers on the character sheet decrease, however, all healing spells have been modified to receive more benefit from spellpower than they received from bonus healing, with a net effect of no change to the amount healed by their spells. Some talents have had to be rebalanced to accommodate this change, but the amount healed will remain roughly the same. In addition, some talents will provide only healing spell power.<br />
