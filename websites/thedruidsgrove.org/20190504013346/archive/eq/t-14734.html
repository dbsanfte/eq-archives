 <br />
Matter of fact the last time i used one was soloing in my 20's and found that using the Targeted AE's worked better.<br />
 <br />
Do these actually have a place in group play?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Rain spells hit up to 4 targets (and you if your too close)<br />
4 mobs and each get hit once<br />
3 mobs and 2 will get hit once,1 will get hit twice<br />
2 mobs and each will get hit twice<br />
1 mob will be hit 3 times<br />
<br />
Just be sure the mobs are close enough together and watch your aggro, since the adds may not be getting taunted.<br />
<br />
They can be used effectivly soloing if you pull 4 mobs at a time, snare them, bunch them up close, kite and nuke.</div></div><hr />

Since when? Rain requires you to remain stationary, because you're &quot;concetrating&quot; on focusing the waves. Also the target area doesn't move just because the mobs do, so they will only be hit by the first wave. Rain spells have 3 waves (I'm not sure if some actually have 4).</div></div><hr />

Against 4+ mobs that are close together you will get 1 wave that hits 4 of the mobs, even if they are moving.<br />
<br />
I's been that way for as long as I can remember (so at least since last week :))</div></div><hr />

<br />
The number of waves is determined by the number of mobs within range of the spell, hitting a maximum of 4 times(thats 4 HITS not waves), all rain spells work this way i believe.<br />
I posted above how it works for each number of mobs.<br />
<br />
Also against 1 mob you do not need to remain stationary, just the mob does.<br />
<br />
I used to use them for quad kiting in Pofire, duo'd alot with another druid out there back during PoP days.</div></div><hr />

I suggest you check again then :)<br />
Cloudburst Hail (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/spell.html?id=9833&amp;source=Live). 1 target. 3 waves. Try it out, then come back :)<br />
Also, although it's quite a while ago I last used rains on multiple targets, I can say with 100% certainty that when I did (in the early PoP days) it did have more than 1 wave on a group of 4 mobs. I think it was 4 waves, however the 3 waves with Cloudburst Hail makes me doubt wheter it was 3 or 4.<br />
<br />
&amp;lt;edit&amp;gt;Seems it has been changed. Just tried 4 and it's only 1 wave now. I'm sure it was not always so though.&amp;lt;/edit&amp;gt;</div></div><hr />

I dont have cloudburst hail, since im not buying tss, but id bet it works same as the lesser rains. Lucy can't tell you everything about how a spell works.</div></div><hr />

Lucy can't tell you everything about how a spell works.That's not Lucy telling me, but me using it. I merely linked to it to make it easier for you and others to know what spell I was referring to.<br />
<br />
When grouping, and the mobs are susceptible to cold damage, I usually cycle between Cloudburst Hail (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/spell.html?id=9833&amp;source=Live) and Ancient: Glacier Frost (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/spell.html?id=5369&amp;source=Live) while waiting for Cloudburst Hail to refresh, so I have plenty of experience on how they work on single targets.<br />
<br />
Anyway, it doesn't matter whether I think rains were 3 or 4 waves, or whether it hit several times on multiple targets etc. I tested today in Skyfire where I took 4 mobs and placed them in a knot (like kiting) then rooted them all. Then I used Winter's Storm (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/spell.html?id=3436&amp;source=Live), and you're right each of the 4 only got hit once.</div></div><hr />

It wont hit any pets or other players(except yourself if you get too close), you can even target a player and cast it on them and it will just hit the mobs around them. Of course, charm always breaks at the worst times :)</div></div><hr />

winter's storm is not on the same timer as high level rains. heavy on the mana but rips mobs up in short order. esp pofire quads or ashengate singles.</div></div><hr />
