It's kind of amazing how klutzy people can be with the stuff they say and do when they're in public office.  Republicans, since absorbing the old S. Democrats, have been burdened with the stigma of tending towards racism.  So you might think they'd be a little cautious.Republicans who are vying to lead the national party offered a mix of reactions yesterday to the decision by one candidate for the job to mail out a music CD including the song &quot;Barack the Magic Negro.&quot;<br />
<br />
Chip Saltsman defended his actions, telling the Hill newspaper that the song -- and others on the CD, which was mailed to party members -- was nothing more than a lighthearted parody. But his rivals in the contest to chair the Republican National Committee said it carried an inaccurate message about what the GOP stands for.</div></div><hr />

You can watch Paul Mooney do a set for an hour and hear him spout &quot;ni**er&quot; 200 times, and &quot;wh*Tey&quot; 100 times, and laugh your butts off.  But if a white man says the same thing, he is a racist to you, some lynching redneck NAZI white supremacist.<br />

We all know that you read the NYT op eds, watch Rachel Maddow, and Keith Blabberman to pick up your marching papers.  Give us a break.</div></div><hr />

<br />
After the Jeremiah Wright incident, Wright gave a speech to a huge almost all-black crowd at the NAACP, where he said that black children don't do as well in school as white children because they're genetically incapable of learning as well as white children do in a classroom.  Seriously, I saw it myself.  And the crowd applauded him wildly.<br />
<br />
Yet when James Watson made a similar but more innocuous statement (http://thedruidsgrove.org/eq/forums/showthread.php?t=16323&amp;highlight=correctness), he was forced to step down in shame.<br />
<br />
Besides, they don't need a song; everyone knows the GOP stands for racism.  Just look at the election results in the south.</div></div><hr />

On the Klath Scale of Racism(tm), &quot;Barack the Magic Negro&quot; falls a lot closer to David Howard uses the word &quot;niggardly&quot; (http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/local/longterm/williams/williams020499.htm) side of the scale than it does cross-burning side.<br />

Have you read the Ehrenstein (http://www.latimes.com/news/opinion/la-oe-ehrenstein19mar19,0,5335087.story?coll=la-opinion-center) piece in the LA Times that supposedly inspired the song?</div></div><hr />

Or flying the rebel flag over the capital in Georgia.  When you've already got the taint of racism by your close association with the old racist south, it's just a really bad idea to try to turn it into humor.  If you can't understand that then you probably shouldn't be trying to be a leader in your party.  Even other Republicans seem to understand this.</div></div><hr />

Or Keith Blabberman, I'm sure his penis is so small that Rachel's clitorus would dwarf his manhood.  He would use a strap on too.  When you Liberals receive your marching orders, do you gag much?  Or do you just swallow, no questions asked?<br />

(not saying it is really that small, with as much testosterone and androgens that Maddow has coming from her/his gonads, I doubt it is all that small, in RL)</div></div><hr />

If you're a politician, the problem comes when you do something that pushes the grey areas of racism when your party has a history of racism.   Whether or not it is actually racist you should be astute enough to know that enough people will interpret it that way that you'll piss people off and stir up a bunch of negative press.  Unless you're actually trying to restrict the appeal of your party, it's a spectacularly dumb thing to do.   If the last election has demonstrated anything conclusively, it's that Republicans need to avoid doing things that restrict the appeal of their party.  Most of the leadership of the republican party understands this.  Those that don't are, well, Utterly tone deaf.</div></div><hr />

How racist is Jesse Jackson?   Establish a clearly defined rating system for me and I'll get back to you on that one.  In any case, Jackson really isn't all that respected by the media.  I've seen discussions on CNN about how he has been a ball-and-chain on his son's political career.  That doesn't sound like respect.</div></div><hr />

I don't think I EVER seen or heard a Black comedian who was NOT racist.  Besides Bill Cosby, of course.<br />

Can you name a Black comedian who is not racist?  Or was not, because I don't want you to exclude dead Black comedians.<br />

Michael Richards<br />

I doubt the dude I was calling out in the original post is a racist (overtly), but he sure as hell is tone deaf.  It's kind of obvious from the reaction of his own party that they think so too.  So let's get off the &quot;PC liberal&quot; thing. <br />
The PC Liberal thing is THE topic of this thread, whether you knew about it or not.  Or like it or not.<br />
<br />
The song you wrote the original post about is a parody of PC Liberals, the PC Liberal media, and black racists.<br />
<br />
You can call that tone deaf, all you like(and sure sounds like something you heard from Rachel Maddow).  I just wish I heard it sooner.<br />
<br />
It is satire, parody, which both have to be based in truth to be funny.  And the song is very very funny.  And finding someone in the upper levels of Conservativism(well those you posted) with a sense of humor just might be harder than you think.  I suppose they would not like JibJab either.</div></div><hr />

Republicans, since absorbing the old S. Democrats, have been burdened with the stigma of tending towards racism.  So you might think they'd be a little cautious.When you've already got the taint of racism by your close association with the old racist south, it's just a really bad idea to try to turn it into humor.If you're a politician, the problem comes when you do something that pushes the grey areas of racism when your party has a history of racism. Whether or not it is actually racist you should be astute enough to know that enough people will interpret it that way that you'll piss people off and stir up a bunch of negative press. Unless you're actually trying to restrict the appeal of your party, it's a spectacularly dumb thing to do.</div></div><hr />

You can tell a lot about people by their reaction or interpretation of it.  Have you even listened to it?  Do you 'get it'?  I don't think you have, or do.

I think you are wrong.<br />
<br />
People are drum headed when they use the word 'niggardly' or 'blackhole' or 'man hole cover', for crying out loud, it has already moved to the point of ridiculous absurdity.  <br />
<br />
That Political Correctness should be ridiculed, mocked, satirized, and parodied.  It should be provoked.  Additionally, you bring up the substance of inherited guilt, endemic of the Politically Correct Left.  That what one person was guilty of, that their ancestors, or even those not related to them, must also share the guilt of.  That is fallacious and absurd to rational thought.<br />
<br />
Evidence that it has gone too far is the reaction to that satire.  It is not rocket science, you are absolutely correct.  It is the opposite, it is the lowest common denominator prevalence, and the Left's blatant intolerance with those different than them.<br />
<br />
I don't know which party 'of racism' that you mean either way.  Are you talking individuals, groups, the Republican party, the Democrat part?  What?  The Republican party is the party of Lincoln.  The Democrat party has had, and continues to have its own racists, not just members but leaders.  During the hey day of Birth of the Nation type Clan activities, in the South, those hooded lynchmobs were NOT Republicans.  So, I don't know which party you are referring to.<br />
<br />
Your representative Black Politically Correct counsel man Wiley, I assure you is not a Republican, but extremely racist.<br />
<br />
Political Correctness, and all of their adherents, from neophyte to their popes should be ridiculed and mocked, and provoked.  For it is based on a lie, many lies and absurdities actually.<br />
<br />
To start:<br />
Guilt is not hereditary or transferable from one person to another.<br />
It is not transferable from one group to another.<br />
Words can not be chosen to be racist or unacceptable if one person uses it, and part of the culture or acceptable, if another person does.<br />
One owes no one restitution or retribution for another person's actions or words.<br />
One certainly does not owe any of those things, and violating those dogmatic doctrines do not denote stupidity(as several posters have mentioned) or unEnlightenment.<br />
That it is fair or valid for Political Correctness to be intolerant of those who don't follow the correct thought, newspeek, and mind think.<br />
That Political Correctness is devoid of racism, and the answer to racism, and everything not Politically Correct is racist.<br />
  <br />
<br />
One can violate Political Correctness intentionally(merely because it is absurd), that in and of itself can be valid social or cultural change.  You don't get to define the violators, activists, or protesters to it, only on YOUR terms, or under your own Bell Jar, at your drum head kangaroo courts.  You are not the only valid judge(and certainly not your programmers).  Political Correctness IS racist, if not out and out racism.</div></div><hr />

I am sure if you set them down with most Conservative leaders in front of a Monty Python movie, they would yawn, fall asleep, or walk out.  Or Will Durst, or George Carlin, Doug Stanhope, or Bill Hicks.<br />

William F Buckley on the other hand?  If he were alive.  Or Ronald Reagan?  Laughing their assess off.<br />
<br />
Bill Bennett?  Na, not even a guffaw.<br />
<br />
On a scale of evilness(as a detriment to society and freedom) from 1 to 100.  No sense of humor has to rate at 3 or a 6, at most.  Political Correctness, a good 73 or so.<br />
<br />

Hah, nice try.   It's obvious their comments are driven by more than simply not getting the joke.  <br />
<br />
In any case, if the joke is so hard to get and so prone to being misconstrued as racist that even the leaders of your own party are &quot;shocked and appalled&quot; and think it's &quot;so inappropriate that it should disqualify any Republican National Committee candidate who would use it&quot; then you're probably an idiot for mailing it out to anyone who aren't absolutely sure will get the joke.<br />

I commend the goal but question the judgement that led Saltsman to think that this was the right time for someone high up in the RNC to do the rocking.  Most of the talk from the RNC has been about trying to find broader appeal for the party.<br />
<br />
&quot;The 2008 election was a wake-up call for Republicans to reach out and bring more people into our party,” - Mike Duncan<br />
<br />
By the way, those Republicans who were &quot;shocked and appalled&quot; are either a) PC themselves, or b) have to appeal to their PC electorate.<br />
They are smart enough to realize that it isn't in a party's or politician's interest to alienate people when they are losing elections.  Doing so is dumb.<br />
<br />
It's the liberal PC media that recycled this old story because they had nothing better to say that day.<br />

What is he, a Libertarian?<br />
<br />
I bet you he is a member of the Democratic Party.  Which has more racism in its history, than any of their competitors.<br />
<br />
High ranking?<br />
Na, he is just part of the Liberal Mainstream Media.  A Black Jew who used the word Negro, and got a pass from the Left and the Politically Correct Gestapo. Ehrenstein is a critic, and op ed writer, in this case for the Liberal LA Times, he is not a song writer.  He is a critic of something, mocking something, deriding something, otherwise why would the LA Times write him a royalty check for turning in his inches.<br />
<br />
Which is the basis for the absurdity of the Left and Political Correctness.  A Black Jew can use the word Negro and is accepted, but Whites can not.  Why?  Because they are not Negros.  Only Negros are allowed to say Negro, everyone else is stupid and racist, or 'tone deaf'.<br />
<br />
If that kind of group think, goodthink, newspeek is the foundation of your so called Enlightenment(which the Left love to describe themselves with), I will chose the opposite.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It all seems rather contradictory to me, but that's no surprise given your history of PC doublethink.<br />
<br />
And yes, &quot;negro&quot; is considered derogatory today (if the speaker is not one, of course).</div></div><hr />

It was all over the news with plenty of liberal commentators condemning it for all sorts of reasons.  I can't remember all their names, but the very fact that the media made such a big deal of this non-issue shows you how strong the reaction was.Refresh my memory, what office was she running for?What difference does that make?</div></div><hr />

Uh huh.  You sound like Sarah Palin when Couric asked her about which newspapers she reads. <br />
<br />

Have you been reading the thread or are you so busy projecting your pet issues into the argument you don't even bother.<br />
<br />
This thread is about a politician who did something that anyone with half a brain would know would irritate people.  He did it at a time when the party he is a leader in needs to be attracting voters rather than driving them away.</div></div><hr />

I think we can take it as a given that he anticipated the PC reaction, and there is little point in discussing it.Uh huh. You sound like Sarah Palin when Couric asked her about which newspapers she reads.No, because that's a question only she knows the answer to.<br />

Unless you've been living in a cave recently (and your surprise that &quot;Negro&quot; is derogatory means that just may be so), you've seen all the liberal reaction to this song.  No, I didn't memorize all the names, bookmark links, and record CNN interviews that I was only half paying attention to.  If you really want to see it all, do a Google search, and you will find everything you need.</div></div><hr />

No, that's what you want the thread to be about.  <br />

I think we can take it as a given that this is not a smart time for a party that just got burned at the ballot box to be provoking people.  If you can't understand that then you're no brighter than Saltsman.<br />

I'm not doing your research for you.  Apart from a few blogs, just about all of the discussion I've seen on the issue is related to the reaction of various GOP people.</div></div><hr />

So you are saying that the only people who were 'offended' by the song were GOP leaders and people.<br />
<br />
At the same time you are saying that the GOP is stupid, alienating, tone deaf, and provoking, for being insensitive?</div></div><hr />

No, I'm saying that it's the GOP folks that seem to be getting the lions share of the press.  I don't see the massive outcry from the &quot;PC police&quot; that you and Tuda claim exists.</div></div><hr />
