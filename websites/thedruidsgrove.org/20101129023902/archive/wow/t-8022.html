It looks like a lot of work is going to be done on the servers this week.<br />
<br />
<br />
The World of Warcraft closed beta servers will be coming down for scheduled maintenance on both Thursday, October 14 and Friday, October 15. On Thursday, the downtime will begin at 6:00AM PDT and should last about four hours. On Friday, the downtime will begin at 6:00AM PDT and will last approximately ten hours. Thank you for bearing with us during this time! <br />
<br />
<br />
Ten hours!!! O.O They're either giving themselves a big window in which to get the job done or they're doing something major to the server.  Of course, the 10 hours tied in with the 4 hours the day before means they're doing something big.<br />

Sign-up and Account Creation Deactivation - Caydiem on 10/13/04<br />
On Friday, October 15, the servers that handle both sign-ups and account creation will come down in preparation for Web-infrastructure updates. If you have a beta key that you have not yet activated, we strongly recommend you do so before Friday. You will be unable to create a closed beta account once we deactivate these services. As always, thank you for being patient with us while we work to bring you the best experience we can deliver. <br />
<br />
<br />
Looks like more steps being taken to get ready for the Open Beta Sign-ups.  For anyone panicking about Open Beta being too soon and that the game isn't ready for release yet.... You're right!  But don't panic, the sign-ups have to take place first, then the Open Beta will start, so there's still plenty of time.</div></div><hr />
