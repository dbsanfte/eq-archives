Seriously....for risk vs reward there just stupidly hard imho.<br />
<br />
<br />
Time enabled guilds wipe on these regularly :/<br />
<br />
I also give you an example<br />
<br />
Hard single group regular drop augs are +7<br />
Raid ones (harder than any single group and more time invested)....augs are +7 !<br />

Your complaint is that the risk vs. reward for raids is too high in comparison to single group adventures.  Tudamorf's point is that SOE is more likely to reduce the reward for single group adventures than to increase the reward for LDON raids (or, alternatively, decrease the raid risk).</div></div><hr />

<br />
It was pretty hard, we lost due to not having enough time left, once we figured out how to win it.<br />
<br />
Was basicly 3 boss monsters had to kill them all same time, or they would regenerate all their hp back in like 0,5 secs, and start hitting for like 11 k.<br />
<br />
To win these raids, u need 6 very well balanced groups, there isent much room for screew ups.<br />
<br />
It pretty stupid the previus expansion, requires large guilds 80 + people roster to beat it (POP)<br />
<br />
My guild has and average of about 55 - 65 people online a night. We use a DKP system to award loot.<br />
<br />
So who is gonna get one of those 36 seats in the raid, and who is going to tell the rest sorry we doing LDoN tonight, cu tommorow.<br />
<br />
Most raiding guilds use some kind of DKP loot system, how about those who dident get a spot in the raid, should they get points anyway ?. What if something drop should guild use DKP system or ?<br />
<br />
We will most likely raid it only on freedays only. Its basicly a very nice idea where each guild can have a instanced target, no more @#%$ blocking. But should remove the 36 person cap, and adjust the dificulty to that.</div></div><hr />

Even if they removed the 36 player limit they would still be hard.  I think the devs may be too used to tuning for a group of 60+ players.</div></div><hr />

10-20   Augments plus 1<br />

And add 1 for a hard dungeon?  <br />

I am kind of guessing, but I have seen plus 5 augments, and that was in a group that I only got 34 AP (had a 59 group member plus some 61-63 people).</div></div><hr />

The raids are designed for a small guild since raid limit is 36 ? There is no way you can win that raid if you not ele /time equipped. Mobs hits for 900 + , tons of hp etc.. Even tough for ele/time geared people. Most top end gulds have members of 50 + . LDON raids only allow about half of them. what's the other half gonna do? SOE trying to break up large guild ? The loots sucks too.</div></div><hr />

The stupid part of the raids is that you can only take 36. That means you get to tell some people they are SOL. Not a fun position to be in and sure makes people not feel wanted. As much fun as picking 72 people to raid Time. The raids are so insanely hard that you get to pick your 36 holy trinity people to even have a shot. Fielding another raid of 36 of your second string is just asking for a CR. <br />
<br />
Ohh yes and the loot. Time level guilds are struggling with these and the only real item I have seen is a ring that was about elemental tradeskill quality.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">King Burgundy</div><div class="date">09-21-2003, 03:34 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I just wish there was some way in game to tell what you were getting into.  It seems there are definitely VT, Elemental, and Time class raids based on various comments on these raids.  Some raids seem to have all yellow and red mobs(Time), others are white and up(Elemental), and still others are mostly blue with an occasional white or yellow and of course the red bosses(VT).<br />
<br />
Its really silly to have to actually try each raid to determine what type it is.  Why would I even bother with a Time level raid for example, if I haven't been to Time yet?  Instead I get to take the chance and possibly zone into one and waste a bunch of peoples time with insta-death.  ;)</div></div><hr />

You usually get a few augments and an item or two of elemental level on the tougher ones.  On the few we've done we've netted some 50hp or mana augs.  They're not great for casters but honestly 50hp is as big an upgrade as going from an elemental to time piece.  For something that requires no flags or keys to do it's not that bad, but then again I'm a glutton for a challenge.<br />
<br />
That being said they could take off the death limits, or make them give vastly more adventure points (since they do have long respawns), or best of all just make raid points and adventure points different and make better items available only from raid points.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Loot sucks for what it takes to do them.<br />
<br />
IMO  36 people is TOO MANY.  Make it 18.   Scale it down so smaller raids can go have fun.   Big raid guilds do PoTime anyway.   It doesn't need to be another 72 person raiding zone/expansion.   I'd really like to see fun 18 person MAX raids and good quality stuff I would USE benefit from my time to raid there.   Sorry no...  +7 augs are crap really.    Rather depressing that you get +7 augs from hard ldon adv's and it being the same for LDoN raids is rather rude =/<br />
<br />
So, as it is now, I don't see bothering at all with LDoN raids.   I don't see dividing the guild into 36 people *EVER*.  It simple causes too much strife and politics within the guild.   <br />
<br />
Anyway,  LDoN groups are fun.  It's a nice passtime =D.</div></div><hr />

25-36<br />
37-48<br />
49-72<br />

In settings of normal and hard.<br />
<br />
The rewards (both AP and exp) and the challenge should be comensurate with the number of people you bring (ie, the larger the raid the better the rewards but the greater the challenge).<br />
<br />
So you have a few people on line and want to kill time with an 18 person raid on normal setting, your reward at the end maybe Tier 3 quality item(s).  If you go in with a 72 person raid on hard setting, your reward could be Time quality item(s).<br />
<br />
I realize there is still a lot of content for my guild to do but I still wonder how eager Time guilds are going to be about killing Quarm 6 months from now, which is how long it will be before we see new raid content aimed at the Time crowd.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Fayne Dethe</div><div class="date">09-21-2003, 07:59 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The 36 person limit was an idiotic idea from the get-go cause elemental/Time raids encourage 60+, and the raid difficulty of LDON is centered around such characters.  In addition, the Time/elemental type raids are so difficult that you have to hand-select the appropriate 36 people out of your guild roster and tell the rest that they are SOL cause they arent the right class.   This design just wont work to keep people addicted until the next expansion since you cant raid LDON as a true guild effort.<br />
<br />
They really need to have a greater selection.  As mentioned before, you need to be able to hand select the difficulty of the raid - VT, time, or elemental, and then the raid difficulty also needs to scale depending on raid size (and allow up to 72 people).  Also, how about a raid level below VT to let small guilds with around 18 players have some fun too.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">rahn rn</div><div class="date">09-21-2003, 09:43 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The baffling thing to me is that the response to concerns about a forced halving of the apparently recommended raid size was that any guild capable of fielding 72 people for a raid can simply split them into two groups of 36.  Huh?  One has to wonder if they're really so out of touch that they believe any guild that CAN field 72 people always has that exact amount (never more, never less, and all of proper equipment and class distribution to create a viable second raid), or if this is a poorly executed attempt to stop the continued bloating of required raid numbers.<br />
<br />
Hrm.  Personally I've never been in to the conspiracy theories people have about SoE trying to screw players over, so I'm inclined to go with the &quot;out of touch&quot; option.  It's hard to reconcile that with the fact that LDoN seems like a pretty solidly designed expansion otherwise, though.<br />

<br />
The MM one wasnt to bad really. We managed to get to the boss without to much problems. With a decent number of minutes left. Then the boss ...... ahum ... Lets just say .. One moment you are in .. Next moment you are at bind.<br />
This one wasnt to bad in my opinion really. Not sure what diffuculy raid this was. *<br />
<br />
After the MM, we went to Everfrost for the Miragul. Well, i can say 1 thing really .. WHERE IS MY VAR OF LUBE !!!!<br />
We heared there might be a death maximum per dungeon. So we counted allready in MM tho there we went rather nicely through. But well. When you hear a quote like this.. it makes you wonder what's going on:<br />
<br />
&quot;I think its safe to say this raid has no death count since we just passed the 96 deaths&quot;<br />
<br />
And at that time. we were about at the half of the raid. I think at the end (when the boss kicked us to bind) we had around 150 deaths.<br />
<br />
Then the ruj event we did, well. we just kicked ass. Monks managed to uh. train the hell out of us.. mini boss + close to 10 adds. Somehow we worked it and lived with minor casualties. We got to the boss rather quick here. Killed it with hardly any effort. And got i think 4 pieces of loot. They were for a time guild rather disapointing. I think 2 pieces went to recruits or a new member dunno anymore and 2 pieces rotted.<br />
<br />
* =&gt; As far as i know, there is no difference in normal and hard in raids. There is just 1 setting and changing it doesnt matter. <br />
<br />
The thing with raids for me. I would like to see some kind of way that people know which raid they are doign. Right now the smaller guilds who can manage to get a decent raid force going for a LDON raid get time difficulty raids where time guilds get pre VT difficulty raids. Not really the idea i'd guess.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I agree, but I guess this isn't really too big of an issue.  Once you try out every raid, you'll be able to easily determine which are too difficult and which aren't and avoid the ones that are impossible for you.  I've already seen a few write ups of the different events.<br />
<br />

Despite Sony saying these raids were geared towards 18-36 people, from what I've been able to tell it's pretty much shooting yourself in the foot if you don't fill all 36 people.<br />
<br />
I was sort of hoping that there would be raids that were specifically made for 3 groups (and only allowed 1:cool:  and there would be others that allowed 36.</div></div><hr />

The actual setting you choose doesn’t matter.<br />
<br />
As far as I know nobody has yet completed any of the Time difficulty raids so it seems a little premature to say that the risk/reward are out of line.  From the mission we won (which was presumably a VT level raid) the rewards would have been very good for a VT level guild, and didn’t rot for our Time level guild.<br />
<br />
Of course a VT level guild would have had extreme difficulty completing the raid, but no more so than a Time guild has with a Time level raid.</div></div><hr />

I experienced a hard level mob in the bugged sunken library dungeon.  We survived but wondered why we used so much mana all at once.  Then I looked at the me-hit list.  The &quot;an earthen defender&quot; was hitting for 920.<br />
<br />
So, drawing from the fact that this is what a difficult level mob hits for and from what I understand a raid level mob hits for at the least and given what I've seen linked and talked about on the boards, I'd say use your precious online time elsewhere.</div></div><hr />

BUT... remember that flexibility is NOT SoE's forte.  It was a HUGE stepping stone for them just to set up the instancing.  Perhaps they will offer some patches in another year or two that will let raids adjust to size when 36 is too many and 6 isn't enough.  Until then be happy for the instancing alone  :)  <br />
<br />
The raid size limit of 36 may not be a big issue soon.  Many PoTime enabled guilds are having huge problems with people leaving the game and have a tough time keeping up with the 60 or so needed to clear time (we have killed Quarm twice, once with 63 and once with 62 I believe)<br />
<br />
Anyway... it's good to have a wish list.  It gives the company a NEED to keep up with it's customers.  Just don't hold your breath or you WILL be disappointed.  Sony/VI has never done anything fast unless the players find a safe way to hunt.  :)   <br />
<br />
Oh!  Almost forgot!  LDoN raiding: <br />
My guild is Time enabled and our groups cut through the 1-group dungeons like a hot knife through butter.  One guild mate is trying to better his personal best which is somewhere near the 30 minute mark for a completed adventure.  We have tried three raids and have failed two of the three.  The challenge is a good thing, but it doesn't come until raiding time.<br />
<br />
I have a good friend who is a &quot;normal&quot; player (ie he doesn't live, breathe and eat EQ).  In the high 50s and with some nice equipment he bought (he had to actually BUY PP on e-bay type sales so that he could upgrade) he struggles through every dungeon he tries.  He is getting to hate LDoN because frustration is NOT fun and unfortunately, for the casual player without a guild, LDoN isn't cutting it.  Heaven help any group of players like this (or non-elemental guild) that tries a dungeon.<br />
<br />
There are more issues to LDoN than raid size, but when we can do adventures in 30 minutes yet can't win a raid with 36..... When &quot;normal&quot; players can't make it through a successful adventure without total frustration.... something is sorely out of whack.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tiniane</div><div class="date">09-22-2003, 06:35 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm really disappointed with the raids in LDoN.<br />
<br />
When I heard about them, I was really excited. I'm in a Guild that usually fields between 3 and 5 groups of people on a raid night. We're at the NToV/Tier1&amp;2 PoP level right now, and just starting to learn how contested Ssra can be /sigh.<br />
<br />
Anyway, the sound of instanced raids, aimed at our kind of numbers sounded really great :)  No content to fight over, raiding at times that suited us, etc etc.<br />
<br />
In reality, there are 2 things I don't like.<br />
<br />
1. Difficulty. We tried an Everfrost raid with 18 people, and failed dismally. We couldn't even get out of the zone-in area. In the total time allowed I think we killed 8 mobs, but I'd like to think that the dungeon mobs got a good number of adventure points for killing us :evil: <br />
<br />
2. Level limits. We're primarily a family guild, and like to include any members who want to come on raids. This means that we'll quite often have a few lower levels (high forties/low fifties) that enjoy coming along to raids with us. PoP flagging is bad enough, but LDoN simply will not allow these people to raid with their Guildies unless they level up.<br />
<br />
Having done some research, it seems we tried one of the harder dungeons, and I'm going to go back and try one of the &quot;VT-Level&quot; ones before giving up entirely.<br />

Huh?  What?<br />
<br />
Why don't you COMPLETE a raid before saying stuff like that.  Unless you think the very easy MM, Tak, and Rujarkian raids didn't give out enough reward.  (Time vs Reward will be fine on the MM one if you can open all four of the chests.)<br />
<br />
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Quote:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;hr&gt;IMO 36 people is TOO MANY. Make it 18. Scale it down so smaller raids can go have fun. Big raid guilds do PoTime anyway. It doesn't need to be another 72 person raiding zone/expansion.[/quote]<br />
Sure it doesn't need to be 72 person but PoTime is NOT enough for the large guilds.  We raid PoTime one, maybe two, day of the week.  PoTime guilds NEED these raids.  <br />
<br />
I think cutting the recommended raid size in half in one expansion is extreme.  I think the these dungeons would still be difficult with 48 people.  I also think 48 is more appropriate.  However, I am having a BLAST doing these raids.  <br />
<br />
I wanted raids that would absolutely kick a guilds ass the first couple times they did them.  Anyone remember their first fear raid?  Or the first time you stepped into ToV on your server?  Those places were rape for the first ones through.  LDoN raids bring that all back again.  <br />
<br />
We have tried almost all of the raids, and I don't know of any that seem impossible.  The Sarycuna (or however you spell it) boss in Miragul seems a tad overblown, but we won't know till we try it a few more times.  <br />
<br />
And these are quality raids.  They are well thought out.  So far there are 'tricks' to everything that makes the raids go from impossible to manageable.  Good stuff.  Really good stuff.<br />
<br />
Oh, and here is a list of raids and their apparent difficulty, though I am not sure on most of the stuff until the rewards are actually found. (ie they are completed.)<br />

<br />
You can also choose almost freely the difficulty, if you want more money or exp, traps or not, caster mobs or melee more, etc. <br />
<br />
Imposing restrictions instead of freedom of choice onto the users is bad computer tech policy... VR (virtual reality) should offer freedom, RL offers too many formalities and regulations already.<br />
<br />
Unfortunately, SOE has a tradition of trying to restrict people into limited 'visions' (sic), and old habits die hard...</div></div><hr />

Not sure of the exact timeing but instanced dungeons were supposed to be part of Planes of Power but it wasn't ready for prime time so PoP got jacked by it's removal (part of the reason for it's many balance problems at the beginning).  It was announced at E3 several months before PoP so it was something Sony had been working on for some time at that point.  <br />
<br />
While it may or may not be original, it really doesn't matter who had the idea if it's a good one.  Computer technology and hardware has come a long way since EQ was first designed and many of the things in EQ today were not even possible when it was first designed.  Many of the features of the current UI are from other games as well.  EQ was there first, and thus also has the problems of being the first.  The fact that they adapt and intergrate features of second and third generation on line games is a good thing in my opinion and part of why the game is still as good as it is.</div></div><hr />

I am in a small guild.  I don't mean small like we only have 30 people online at a time, I mean small like our roster has 20 mains in it total...maybe...it might be less than that.<br />
<br />
The current LD setup is 1. take a group of 4 - 6 or 2. put together a minimum of 18 people.  Less than 18 can't start a raid.  <br />
<br />
We are a family guild.  This means anytime folks are all on at the same time, we like to play together.  We hunt in raid all the time, our raid force frequently is only 9 people.  We don't want to split into 2 separate groups, we like playing together, and none of us have any problems with the xp loss due to being in raid mode (I'm talking the game mechanics of raid).  <br />
<br />
I think that between the level range restriction, and our normally small force, we could field a &quot;raid&quot; of maybe 12 if we were lucky.  Unless something has changed, 12 doesn't get you into a LD raid instance.<br />
<br />
I don' think this is the end of the world, we do other stuff instead, but it sure would be nice if a 2 group raid could go off playing together.<br />
<br />
So far I&quot;ve really enjoyed the dungeons and the hunts I've done in LDoN.</div></div><hr />

And AO had already gone commercial the year before (I think release was June or July 2001).  If the &quot;working on for some time&quot; relationship holds true, then the AO developers were &quot;working on&quot; instanced dungeons long before EQ.  Ultimatley, AO had instanced missions in the game 2 years before EQ.  <br />

If instanced dungeons were being thought about for PoP, the source seems clear.<br />

The people who have those original ideas (and intellectual property attorneys) likely disagree with you. :) <br />
<br />
<br />
&lt;strong&gt;EQ was there first, and thus also has the problems of being the first.&lt;/strong&gt; <br />

While EQ undoubtedly has been fun and successful, I don't think it can lay claim to being the &quot;first.&quot;  <br />

&quot;Adapt and integrate&quot; = &quot;copy&quot;  :) <br />
<br />
Not that copying is necessarily a bad thing, of course...</div></div><hr />

Huh?  Instanced areas is nothing new.  It has probably been in games (MUDs even) for decades.  This is in no way a brilliant concept.  It is just applying single player game principals to a MMOG concept.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The Realm had them in the mid 90's. (Sierra MMORPG) You had to stand in line and wait your turn. (limited amount of Instances available at that time) Was rather interesting to see 200 people in a single file line waiting for their chance to spawn their groups dungeon. (You just clicked the dungeon entrance to spawn your dungeon and warp your group in...Solo dungeons were available also) Eventually people got tired of waiting in line and would &quot;Dungeon Jump&quot; in front of others. GM's frowned on this and it was a sure fire ticket to &quot;GM Jail&quot; on the first offense. (1 real hour sitting in a room with no doors unable to cast) Repeated dungeon jumping would get you banned for a week or permanently if you continued. :)</div></div><hr />

I'm not a lawyer, so ymmv, but the way I understand it, you can't patent a concept, but rather the concept and the method of implementing the concept.  As long as you can show that the people who reimplemented the concept never saw the implementation details of the origial (AKA Reverse engineering) then it's not a violation of the law.  For example you can't patent the entire concept of backup software, but you can patent specific details (such as how data about the backups are stored) and implemntation you use to perform the backup.<br />
<br />
That wasn't really my point though.  My point was, at some point someone had the idea of using rubber air filled tires on their cars.  At the time it was a new idea but now days you can buy rubber tiers from whatever company you think is best.  <br />
<br />
In the long run, it will be the same with online games.  The ones who have the best feature sets, most fun and best implementation will be the ones people play, no matter where some of the base ideas for the game came from.<br />

I meant chronologicaly speaking in reference to Anarcy Online.  I.E.  EQ came before it by a significant time frame and was thus the problem was that it was based on older and slower technology that had smaller mass and volotile storage(hard drives and ram).  As time passed new technology was implemented for AO (Yes, muds had it first but AO was the first to implment it in a mmorpg).  As more time rolled by the everquest engine was brought up to be more in line with the new technolgoy (I.E.  Instanced dungeons in LDoN).</div></div><hr />

instanced zones are fun as you can better control 'you are in partially-yours woulrd now' experience (no KS, no running over, training etc).<br />
<br />
What is missed in LDoN is more flexibility of the design: we two (mewife &amp; me) will never buy it before it can also be scaled to duo and single play. Simply too restrictive for the benefit if we have to shout for group for any amount of time. <br />
<br />
Downtime is no playtime, and you better dont pay for it.</div></div><hr />
