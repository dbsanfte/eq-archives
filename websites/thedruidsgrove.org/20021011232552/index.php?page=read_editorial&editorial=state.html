<b>History's Lesson</b>
<p>
The <a href="http://pub13.ezboard.com/fthedruidsgrovefrm18.showMessage?topicID=87.topic" target="_blank">State of the Druid</a>, better known as "the druid petition," was originally published on March 18, 2002. Rough drafts had previously been posted on our forum for community input and peer discussion, so, in essence, the document's ideas date to one month earlier, and the sentiments contained therein, to the distant past. As with any sort of open letter or public expression, the petition was meant as a cumulative statement of issues that the most avid and most loyal druid players had with the class' immediate shortcomings. Contrary to popular belief, the class did indeed have problems &mdash; and still does although that's changing; any longtime player worth his or her salt recognized these problems instead of holding onto pre-Kunark ideas of an overpowered class.
<p>
It has now been five months since the petition was published to the EQ Live team's attention. What has happened to it and to our class since its appearance? It might be interesting to note some of the changes and what the future might hold.
<p>
First, a bit of background: The petition made quite a stir in two separate phases. Initially, the feedback from druids who continued to visit our Grove was very supportive and generally agreed with the points. As was expected, a number of druid players were more or less happy with the class and didn't see the need for such change, even for the intended target: the endgame. Public reception hit its peak then dropped off until Casters Realm picked up the news belatedly. Then there was quite a rush of posters, as our forum seemed to slow to a crawl and our staff worked to maintain organization. Some of the posters came at the community at point-blank range, concluding that the petition was selfish and greedy. However, most of the discussions turned out to be productive. Except one. Where was Verant's answer? Read on.
<p>
The petition drew so much public awareness that some of VI couldn't not know about its existence. In an indirect response, Absor went public to say that petitions were never really the right method of approach. In other words, just get to the point and leave the prose at home &mdash; we're busy! This public statement confirmed that the petition was known at least, and it even led to two Woody Hearn <a href="http://www.gucomics.com/d/20020412.html" target="_blank">/gu comics</a> in which one satirized the response with <a href="http://www.gucomics.com/d/20020501.html" target="_blank">a bit of office fun</a>. And let's not forget that looming ever so silently in the background was the enormous <a href="http://pub13.ezboard.com/fthedruidsgrovefrm30.showMessage?topicID=11.topic" target="_blank">caster balancing project</a> that the EQ Live team announced on February 27, 2002. If any time was appropriate for laying the cards on the table, this was it &mdash; our petition wasn't drafted out of the blue. In a period of increasing communication between players and the EQ Live team, the petition raised issues in an effort to get others to start thinking about ways to improve druids, which are essentially dualistic by design and hard to balance. The community succeeded in its goal, but the challenge remained because there was so much to be said about and done to caster balancing. The EQ Live team wasn't exactly responsive in the immediate term, but once progress was made with focus items, pet changes, and intelligence casters, they were able to be more communicative. And it's not over yet although direct word has been brief and to the point.
<p>
<br>
<br>
<b>Rome Wasn't Built in a Day</b>
<p>
<i>State of the Druid</i> can be summarized as the following points:
<p>
<li>Remove the 10% healing penalty for noncleric healers.<br></li>
<li>Change Nature's Recovery to 24 seconds with a shorter recast time.<br></li>
<li>Give druids a group heal.<br></li>
<li>Give druids an upgrade to Nature's Touch.<br></li>
<li>Create a single-target version of Protection of the Glades.<br></li>
<li>Improve the stacking properties of POTG and Aegolism.<br></li>
<li>Remove the snare from the epic's Wrath of Nature effect.<br></li>
<li>Upgrade Winged Death with an end-level DOT.<br></li>
<li>Allow druids to teleport to Luclin.<br></li>
<li>Fix Moonfire (and consider a cold debuff line).<br></li>
<p>
Out of those suggestions, ideas, or requests to improve the druid's situation in the endgame, the EQ Live team has followed up on a few as well as indicating more to come. First, the 10% healing penalty was removed. Druid players have unanimously supported this change although there may be one or two out there who thought this was a negative adjustment &mdash; you just never know! Second, the single-target version of POTG was introduced to the gameworld, albeit initially through a very intensive tradeskill quest, which was later revised after it had been solved. Anyone can do the short quest for Protection of the Cabbage. Third, teleports to Luclin that work from all Norrath were added for druids and wizards, and the storyline evolved to reflect that. Fourth, Moonfire was indeed changed as requested, and although there has been no indication of any cold debuffs, <a href="http://pub13.ezboard.com/fthedruidsgrovespells.showMessage?topicID=2795.topic" target="_blank">many players are actually happy using Moonfire</a>.
<p>
Some interesting developments seem to be in the making. These address healing and the way we do damage individually and collectively. For instance, there has been some evidence on Test and in the spell data, as shown by <a href="http://lucy.fnord.net/" target="_blank">Lucy</a>, that the snare component of Wrath of Nature may be on its way out. Does this have to do with the recent announcement by EQ Technical Director Scott Hartsman that the team is working on allowing multiple instances of the same damage-over-time spell from distinct individuals of a class? In a similar development, the team seems to be addressing the ways in which various buffs stack, which could be good news for those who prefer our mana regen component over something like Aegolism. The jury is still out on this, though. On the healing front, <a href="http://pub13.ezboard.com/fthedruidsgrovefrm30.showMessage?topicID=100.topic" target="_blank">reports</a> from ever-probing eyes on the Internet say that the Test server spell data file includes a new heal for druids &mdash; and it appears to be a rather significant upgrade. However, this is complete conjecture at this point, and it would be premature for anyone to assume that this will go live. In sum, three elements of remaining petition suggestions seem to be works in progress (emphasis on "in progress").
<p>
Last but not least, what's become of the remaining items? First, it is rather doubtful that Nature's Recovery will be changed to a 24-second duration as that would turn it into a heal-over-time spell like Celestial Elixir. Currently, NR stacks with Regrowth/Regrowth of the Grove. Also out of the picture is an upgrade to Winged Death. One can assume instead that a caster-balancing move translated into the change to DOTs and NPC movement such that moving NPCs would still take full damage from the spell. This was a reversal of long-standing nerf, and it's hardly anything to be negative about. Perhaps this isn't what druids were looking for, but one never knows if VI has plans to include a new DOT for Planes of Power. On a similar note, the issue of a group heal has also remained in the dark. The question is whether druids might receive such a spell in the new expansion or not at all.
<p>
In the end, our petition did make an impact. <a href="mailto:gwynhyfar_foxfyre@hotmail.com">I invite you</a> to prove that it didn't and that everything that has occurred since March has been a total coincidence or luck of the cabbage.
<p>

<b>The Dinosaur Speaks</b>
<p>
A while ago I encountered a rather bewildering druid player who told me that she didn't mind one bit if druids went the way of the dinosaur in EverQuest because they were overpowered from 1-50 as though pre-Kunark assessments could hold any water today. I couldn't have imagined a more stupid, a more self-negating comment because no one who cares to play a game for years, all the while investing much time into character development, would throw it all away without flinching or feeling some small amount of regret. If they were throwing it away, they'd either be ebaying but still getting something in return or they couldn't care less about the game and all the people who helped them. I came to the conclusion that this person belonged in the last category: She couldn't care less about the game or people who played it, and her druid was nothing to her.
<p>
Fortunately, the people who continue to play druids and the game designers don't agree with this kind of couldn't-care-less-throw-away thinking, or we'd all be doing something different for entertainment and jobs, respectively.
<p>
No class <i>deserves</i> to go the way of the dinosaur.
