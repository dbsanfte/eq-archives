<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gryz Goatstabber</div><div class="date">05-24-2003, 12:27 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">After PL'ing a lot, I've found what I believe are the absolute best spots.  I did my PL'ing with a poorly equipped 54 druid with no AA's, but usually had KEI on.  Also, the characters I pl'ed were also HEAVLY twinked melee's (IE, 400-500k in gear).  Your mileage may vary.  <br />
<br />
*Also, keep in mind if you do it this way you should end up with max or close to max skills by level 20 - 25ish, and from there on out you should be able to max them every level.  It may not seem that important, but the first time I did this was with a bard, and he hit a slump at level 35 when his weapons and defensive skills were like 90 - 100 when they should have been 170+.<br />
<br />
1 - 4: <br />
Make sure you start off with 5 points in whatever weapon skills you are doing.  Any newbie zone will work, but Gfay is easily accesible with the POK book and has an abundance of mobs.  I would recommend doing levels 1 - 4 without a DS, as you will get important skill ups.  It may take you an extra 15 - 30 minutes than if you would have gone straight to Unrest w/ thorns, but I feel it's worth it 10 fold.  Also, once you hit level 4, spend all the practice points you have availible to you in your weapon skill if you haven't maxed it.<br />
<br />
4 - 13:  Unrest.  DS, Share wolf form, Str, Hp buff, Regen.  You only need to hit each mob once for experience, so as soon as you've done a single point of non-DS damage, go find your next target.  Your old mob(s) will catchup with you at some point and kill themselves.  Please note that in wolf form you aren't KOS, which is very handy for the druid doing the PL'ing.  <br />
<br />
Once you hit level 13, I recommend doing this:  Grab as many trash mobs as you can in the yard, and pull them into a corner without a DS on to raise your skills.  I did defensive skill points 10 - 75ish here in about 20 minutes, and it was worth it.  Note that when I say as many mobs as you can, that 15 is a minimum and 25+ is preferred.<br />
<br />
13 - 24:  Paludal.  It's heaven.  Same style PL'ing as Unrest, and hopefully by level 24 you're all caught up on skills and still making decent leveling time.  I'd expect your total played at this point if all you've done is level and work skills to be 2 - 5 hours.  If this is your first time PL'ing, expect a learning curve as you learn to effectively 2box/PL.<br />
<br />
24 - 37:  High Hold Keep.  But don't waste your time on the goblins, go right for the gaurds.  This is the best experience spot I've ever seen, for any level.  It's ridiculous.  There are gaurds all along the first, 2nd, and 3rd floors.  You'll learn the lay out of them over time, and get it down to a cycle.<br />
<br />
At 37 things open up.  I always liked City of Mist because the undead don't run, but LGuk is a lot of funny and decent experience too.  You can ride CoM to 45ish, and Guk all the way till 50+.   <br />
<br />
By level 45 you should know about where you wanna head too, and a lot of your choices will be dictated by the class of character you're PL'ing, their gear, and the level/gear/AA of the druid that's doing the PL'ing.  <br />
<br />
Hope this added something that hasn't already been said.<br />

<br />
1-5 = make them level on their own ; )<br />
5-12 = Field of Bone, pit area working from PoK book area towards Kurns.<br />
12-15 = Kurns tower, basement where you drop down that hole, the Burynai's and icebone/charbone skeletons.<br />
16-20 = Paludal Caverns, run them around the patog and phlerg fiends near the HS zone around.<br />
20-25 = Mix of Najena and Marus Seru. Najena is awesome.  Hardly anyone ever there, just run around (make sure you know about the drop locations) killing the named mobs and gathering keys.  When you have the Najena key, just camp that little room, 19 minute timer for the mobs.  Kill Najena a few times; she's a cow anyway.  Marus Seru is very cool, but I had really wanted to kill Najena a few times, hee hee so went to Najena first.<br />
25-30 = Ghoulbane camp in Upper Guk is great, set up in the Lord's spawn room and just haev them pull the other rooms around there, goes by very fast and is awesome xp.  <br />
30-35 = Non-Hidden Echo Caverns is very awesome xp.  The underbulks, rocks, and fiends are awesome xp and work very well w/ snare pulls.<br />
35-40ish = City of Mist is amazing.  Mobs don't run so they keep slapping the DS, adds can be a pain, but over all it's very good if you just take stables or temple.  Keep 'em comming, snaring to pull.  Works very well.<br />
<br />
PotG, CoS, DS, Str, RotG was the line up for buffs, with chloro/NCH for healing and snares for the mobs so they don't run, though maybe a low lvl root so they keep bashing the DS is a better course.</div></div><hr />

<br />
My best location for early stage:<br />
<br />
Level 1-2 -- Newbie zone<br />
<br />
Level 3-12 -- Paludal Caverns (33% exp each single kill from 3 - 8 at least, which mean 3 kills per level and this is even faster then level 1, make sure your newbie did one damage b4 you throw your DS)<br />
<br />
Level 13-18 -- Paludal Caverns ( easy and fast kill, exp 3 - 5 %)<br />
<br />
Level 19 onward -- seem all red mobs will give approx 5% exp :p  maybe there is exp cap for high level...<br />
<br />
If using a druid to PL, you can choose anywhere you like and familar. Avoid caster type and healer type mobs make PL easiler.</div></div><hr />

<br />
1-12 : Bonechips/Crushbone Belts<br />
12-24 : Paludal... I started with fiends and just took as many blues and bandits as I could find<br />
24-30 : Zelniaks up to Large Zelniaks in Dawnshroud Peaks<br />
30-40 : Goto Great Divide and go into the first tizmak cave. Keep running and running and running until you see a huge room with 3 paths to different areas...Goto the right one where the gigantic room is with 6-7 tizmaks in one corner and 4 entrance tizmaks. If you follow the left wall of the room, you can med there with no risk after becoming KOS. The room is huge so theres plenty of single pull-able spawns. If you can't find the room, goto eqatlas.com and look up a map (find the biggest room in the cave)...Anyways, the spawns are so quick that once you take all of them, the spawns will already be regenerated. Easiest way 30-40 in a matter of maybe 1-2 days.<br />
<br />
I don't know where else...but i've tried Crystal Caverns, CoM, Overthere, DSP, and GD is THE best!</div></div><hr />

My fiancee has PL'd various toons of mine with his 62 druid, and it ALWAYS seems to be that, once the toon hits about level 22, the xp takes a serious nosedive. This isn't just because of level .. because once we manage to get the toon to about 35, we can hit the &quot;sweet spot&quot; zones and the xp starts flooding in! (ie : CoM)<br />
So, our conclusion .. we need a better place to hunt for levels 22 to 35!<br />
Here's some places we've tried :<br />
<br />
Paludal Caverns - WAY to overcrowded<br />
LOIO - Never enough mobs and/or xp is crummy<br />
Splitpaw - Only seems to be good up till 26 or 27 .. then drops-off suddenly<br />
Dawnshroud - Overcamped!<br />
Marus Seru - Crummy xp unless you can manage to take 30 mobs on at once<br />
Unrest - ugh .. unrest .. overcamped on our server<br />
DL - Yeti's (they're great mobs .. very few hp .. don't hit hard .. but there's just not enough of them to keep me busy!)<br />
OT - is where we seem to end up always getting stuck .. xp is really pretty crummy on a per-kill basis .. and plus, whenever he's not PLing, I group here .. it's bad enough having to spend 10+ levels here lol.<br />
<br />
We're on Tunare .. so unfortunately the great zones like CC are so severely camped that they're not even worth mentioning in the above list. <br />
<br />
SO! Anyone have any good suggestions that I haven't mentioned? or perhaps different mobs in any of the above zones?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">BriennaMonk</div><div class="date">07-26-2003, 02:38 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Are you sure CC is crowded?  I know it used to be that way on Cazic, but lately I hear that orcs are rarely killed.  Most people camp geos/spider.  The orcs are 4-5% per kill from level 23-28 and there's enough of them in the top hallway to keep you constantly killing.<br />
<br />
Once you get to 28 or so, I think the Tizmak caves are good from there.<br />
<br />
If CC is not available, try Mistmoore.  Just be sure to buff your powerlevelee (is that a word?) magic resist to help with the nukers and you'll get good xp there in the low to mid 20s without going too far in.</div></div><hr />

<br />
There's a new feature for memming spells where you right-click on an empty spell gem, and it brings up a menu of the spells you know, organized by type.  The sub-menus (where the actual spells are) also show the level at which the spell is acquired.<br />
<br />
Level 49 and below spells are castable on all players, regardless of level.  Once over 50, the spells have a level limit, roughly equal to 2/3s of the spell's level.  So if you're PLing a lowbie, you can choose the spells that are 49 and below.  For example, for &quot;skin&quot; buffs, that would be Skin like Diamond.<br />

<br />
I never used the spellbook icon, since I mapped the &quot;spellbook&quot; function to the &quot;=&quot; key years ago.  SO when custom UIs came out, I got a gem window that skipped the spellbook icon.  I haven't bothered to change my UI mod yet, so I can't use spell sets until I do.  I wish there was a way to initialize spellsets from a chat command.  They have a chat command to mem a spellset that's already defined.<br />

1-10:  Duh.  Anywhere.  Takes 15-30 minutes.<br />

30-40:  Lower Guk or Solusek B.<br />
41-55:  The Hole, zone in to tower area (don't go to the underground area, past the quest gnome).  Best XP you'll ever see for the low difficulty.<br />

1-12sh          Field of Bone/Kurn's Tower<br />
3low 20's   Paludal Caverns.  Find an unpopulated area, load up self and normal DS and snare pull all in sight.  Newbie toon does 1 AE to do damage and everything will die on the DS.<br />
mid 20's-44   Grimling forest caves.  Same as above.  Would pull 5 grimlings at a time.  If they got lucky, I'd have to heal myself once or twice.  Worked real well until low 40's and 44 it got slow enough to not be worth the time.<br />

<br />
First few levels are always best done in a newbie area in which ever zone you start in.  Its good to get these first few skillups against mobs that are hitting you<br />
<br />
6-12 I normally pull the camps in SRo, orcs, bandits etc.  DS the PL'd char and heal them - again working on skills.<br />
<br />
12-34 Iceclad Cougars <br />
<br />
I do this whole level range in the same zone, I find it easier to leave my char somewhere and logged on so I can port over and PL when I get spare time between raids/xp groups or whatever.  Cougars are good xp for their level, with a 65 druid I can pull all 14 that spawn on the northern most island in 1 go.  regen and ds and have them beat me, with 14 you'll need to run a little and heal maybe once or twice before they are low.  Once they get to about 30% I hit sotw and run my PL'd char in and aoe, at lower levels I got quite a few reists, but the aggro from healing myself is more than enough to be able to chain cast 5-10 aoes.  You might loose 1/2 in the early stages but at lvl 25+ you dont get many resists.  Obviously with a melee thers no aoe option so I have to restrict myself to pulling 5/6 at a time and hitting as many in the back as possible.  Sotw is by no means a must, but it does mean I can switch to my PL'd char without worrying about the my druids HPs, damage from 14 greenys adds up eventually and the mobs die faster thanks to the DS.<br />
<br />
Cougars are worth between 9% at lvl 12 down to about 2% at 35.<br />
<br />
From 35-44 is the difficult patch for me.  I dont have a zone im entirely happy with.  I can do 35-40 with the same tactics as in iceclad but with higher level mobs but its not as efficient as the mobs hit harder rockhoppers in DSP have been my choice being as I need the pelts for tailoring, but often other people are there unlike iceclad.  Grimling forest is an option im going to try next, maybe better and noone is ever xping there.  Might try the hole this time around too, ZEM there is the best pre pop.<br />
<br />
Once you get to the point the char you are PLing with can group with you there are lots of choices.  I would move to pop at 46+, maybe charm ravens in PoN again or quad kite.  They made this more difficult recently by increasing the level range of mobs that con light blue but its still pretty good xp over getting a group and grinding.  Being as I'm PLing a wizzy this time around, thier extra damage to quad kites should make that the best option.</div></div><hr />

I could still use thorns and the cleric has a nice PB ae so we'd munch 8-10 at a time.  When things got really boring and SoTW would pop up, I'd round up even more, pop SoTW on us both, and be glad to be alive when all was said and done.  At this point the clerics PB ae is decent enough you can do one of your own low level PB ae's to speed things up since they should be able to get in two shots of theirs.<br />

I used Kaesora near the library and then at Xalgoz for mid 20's to 35 for this character.  Given a choice I'll take undead mobs for pl'ing any day.</div></div><hr />

The beach was empty this morning though, not sure what it will be like if others are there as well.

Rockhoppers hit harder but being animals you can charm one and turn them against each other and break charm again before they die.</div></div><hr />

It wasn't worth the time it too me to kill things off.  <br />

I am starting to get the idea, with DS'ing my 62 Druid, until 30% then you say use SoTW.  What is SoTW?  Spirit of the Wolf?  <br />
<br />
Anyway, should I be meleeing with the Enchanter?  Casting on them?  Using my pet?  <br />
<br />
Any help would be great.  My goal as well, is to get her up to a level where I can group her with my druid to get her to 60 for a KEI bot.  =)</div></div><hr />

<br />
DS, regen and get your druids hps to the best you can.  Then let them all hit you for as long as you or they last.  If your running out of hps, kite them away a little and heal yourself.  Once they are getting low I would move in my wizzard and cast a couple of low damage aoes until i was failrly sure i had hit most of the mobs.  I then continue to let them beat themselves to death of my DS.<br />
<br />
SOTW is spirit of the wood, its an aaxp ability that adds to your damage shield for a short time, as well as having a nice regen effect so if you have a lot of greenys beating on you you dont take too much damage esp when your moving in your PL'd char to aoe.  The higher level the greenys the more you need to heal and will apprechiate the extra damage from sotw.</div></div><hr />

However playing in PoN seems to be the best place to PL a 46+ char.  I have a 51 cleric I will one day get to 65 - maybe.<br />
<br />
Charming either ravens or stalkers in PoN is very nice xp, the stalker camp starts to repop just as im finishing off the last of them, so its a nice constant source of xp.  As Im PLing a cleric I charm and buff up a pet, and then use the cleric to heal.  Her heals are better than mine andway, and it saves me enough mana I can throw in at least 1 nuke per mob without ever dropping below 80mana.<br />
<br />
Another fun group I had was in PoI, I was just playing there to see what the xp was like and a few people in their 50s asked to join me.  I ended up using my druid as a tank and cleric to heal with the others either slowing or adding damage.  It was just good fun to tank as a druid, and try as they might, noone was pulling aggro from me.  My druid's ac/hp are higher than my low 50s warrior who's wearing fierce heraldic so I was a resonable tank.  It dosnt feel so much like grinding out levels if your in a group.</div></div><hr />

<br />
1-20: Paludal, can get 2 chars (I PL 2 at a time) to 19 or 20 in less than 2 hours easy, with the ZEM of 160.<br />
21-30: Unrest, 3rd floor, then basement.  Still goes pretty quick, ZEM is 130<br />
31-40: Here's where I'm still looking for a great spot.  Been doing ToFS 2nd floor, I pull 6-9 at a time, let them go mostly OOM on me, then I pull them to the PLees.  Can do 50-60 mobs per hour this way, but with the lower ZEM (85), XP rate slows a lot.  I'm going to try bringing my level 32 clerics to Kaesora instead, I heard it has a ZEM of 110.<br />
41-50: The Hole.  With a ZEM of 100, it's almost as good as PoP, and the entrance mobs only have 2500 HPs.  If you can have a PLee with good AC, the XP just flies here.  All entrance mobs (about 14-16 mobs including the tower) are 38 or higher, so dark blue to level 51.  Massive constructs in the pit are all 41, so dark blue to a 54.<br />
<br />
After playing around in different areas, I no longer bring folks to PoP right at 46.  They can't get bonus XP until 51, and they can't help kill mobs, so you're just diluting the XP you get them.  In the Hole, they get all the XP, and at 2500 HPs, the mobs die quick =)<br />
<br />
Even at 51, they don't get bonus XP in PoP if you are too much higher than them (9-10 levels or so).  In that case, I find the Hole works well through 53.  At 54, then go to PoN for 1 level, then to PoS.<br />

20-50 Kedge - if you can get EB items on your toons, kedge has something like a 125% exp mod or so I've heard (if not 125 it would have to be close).  It would be rough in the 20's and you'd be healing a TON but the exp is still worth it, you could do the DS trick and/or zone trick here to avoid so much healing.  The first floor mobs hit around the 30's but can hit upto 100 if the &quot;named&quot; fish is up, but then you just kill it :p.  Once your 33ish all depending on the class your leveling, you can move to 2nd floor and stay there until level 47 or so iirc.  <br />
<br />
One nice feature of this zone is there are animals that druids can charm, nothing runs, and the first two floors are 100% melee.  Once you hit that 47 level or so you'll find yourself having to move to another camp where there will be casters.<br />
<br />
You could technically stay in kedge to 65 if you really wanted but I think it would be way slow after 55 or so.  I suggest to those that actually enjoy PLing to give kedge a shot.  It takes some getting used to as you have the Z axis to contend with but it is a ton of fun :)</div></div><hr />

Get your druid over to the Wakening Lands and blast every Holgresh you see.

<br />
12-20: Paladual, and hit the bugs as soon as possible, usually no one is killing them and they don't run or have annoying diseases like the fiends.<br />
<br />
21-30: Unrest/Sol A goblins/Sol A gnomes. The gnomes and clockwork gnomes are awesome exp and hit like wusses if you don't mind the faction hit.<br />
<br />
30-38: Sol B <br />
<br />
38-44: City of Mist (tried LoY zones here also, but was not as quick of exp IMO)<br />
<br />
45-50: The Hole, tried HS and Chardok for a change of pace, but exp is not as good as the hole<br />
<br />
50+: PoP <br />
<br />
This is the path I took with my paladin who is 51 now, levels are not exact, but basically when exp started to really slow down I would move on to the next spot and see if the exp per time was better yet.  I really enjoyed the Hole, especially since the revamp, and you can get some nice drops too while you are PLing.  The other thing I like about these zones is except for Paladual they are often completely empty which is perfect for PLing.  Sol A and B have people sometimes, most often other people PLing.<br />
<br />
Some places would pull a ton on the druid and the pally would hit each one, but tried to have the pally tank some each level to keep defense relatively maxxed and once we got to CoM, pally tanked pretty much 100% of the time, sort of the breaking point of being easier to heal the pally than the druid.<br />
<br />
For 50+, I have a 65 bst friend who offered to group with me in a zone that is green to him and not green to me and have his pet run around and kill everything :)  Other fun PL has been PoJ with a 60 druid and 65 rogue.  Since the rogue can assasinate most mobs in the zone it is very fast exp, even with all three grouped.  Otherwise, plan on grouping and grinding the rest.</div></div><hr />

<br />
There seems to be a lot of debate over how to PL casters efficiently.<br />
<br />
After 20 hours played, my enchanter dinged level 40.  At least 2 hours were spent in the bazaar gearing her up, and about 3-4 hours were spent leveling without the help of my druid (1-5) and practicing spell skills.  So I made level 40 in roughly 14 hours, in my estimate and I think I could have done it faster if I had followed the tactics that I used from 20-30.<br />
<br />
My main is a 65 druid, she is very well-equipped with plenty of well-spent AAs (well, in my opinion!).  I just say this because the technique I use may not be viable for a lower level/naked or poorly equipped druid.<br />
<br />
1-5: I did in Nektulos without any help.  I imagine if you bring your druid to the newbie zone and buff with SLN, thorns and regen you could do this really quickly.  The biggest drawback is the fact that thorns will KS your PLee and that damage takes out newbie mobs very quickly.  But as a caster if you chain pull with a low level DD you would be fine.<br />
<br />
5-20: Paldual Caverns (sp?) : Yes, it's crowded -- but you won't be hunting in the bandit camps and at least on Druzzil that's where most people seem to be hanging out.  Buff the PLee AND the PLee's pet if they have one and fight your way in.  Pull monsters with a spell or make sure you hit them for a pt of damage in melee.  Grab *everything* but make sure you fight in deeper to get yellows.  Since I was an enchanter I'd buff the pet, pull a monster and when the pet was engaged I'd already be moving on to pull/tank some more on my own.<br />
<br />
The best hunting in here (IMO) are the phlarg/potog fiends.  From 9/10 to 13/14 the phlarg fiends in the huge cavern with the lake are amazing.  You can work on 2-4 at a time with a pet out.  They're also fairly easy to train onto a pet.<br />
<br />
14-20: I ran out onto the narrow walkways that surround the lake that the bandit camps are off of.  There was nobody else up here, and there are two full caverns of Potog Fiends plus the numerous spawns on the walkways themselves.  The way I did this was, once again, letting the pet and the enchanter tank.  HOWEVER, the next time I try PLing a caster it may work better to just stand the caster in a safe corner and round up 3-4 Potogs at a time with the druid.  Then, the caster would just have to fire off a low dmg DD on each one and sit back and enjoy the EXP.  Your druid will have better thorns and be able to kill twice as fast as the lowbie.  Once you hit 20, head to Unrest.<br />
<br />
20-30 Unrest Basement: Unrest is deserted on my server.  I buffed up my druid and my enchanter and set up shop in the basement.  The corner right before the stairs at the end of the hall leading to the basement is nearly 100% safe.  In 10 levels there I got maybe 3 roamers, and a fully buffed caster can tank a single with no problems.  Leave the caster in the corner and go round up some mobs with the druid.  If they won't jump you (they all jumped me at 65 so this shouldn't be a problem) just sit next to them and they will.  The optimal amount of mobs on the druid at any given time is 3-4.  My druid's health never dropped below 90%.<br />
<br />
Just have the caster damage them (until 24 some may be too red so you have to step in and smack them) and enjoy the exp!<br />
<br />
I left Unrest at 30, but I imagine you could go to 32-34 if you really wanted to.  Last night I scouted out Kaesora, and it seems like a reasonable place to go from 30-40.  Your only limiting factor is the fact that even a very well equipped druid is going to reach a point where they can't tank the mobs (they start hitting too hard).  I believe the tactic that I described could be used to take a caster to 45, MAYBE 50 if you could find a steady supply of lower level mobs (low blues to the PLee).<br />
<br />
30-40: Kaesora! I went all the way down to the church/Xalgoz's area.  There are plenty of pulls and the experience was great.  At this point the druid is having to toss heals on herself, which is disappointing but not completely unexpected.  I walked out with level 40 under my belt in essentially three long evenings of playing plus the component I needed from Xalgoz for a key to Howling Stones.  Xalgoz himself is a little high to be an effencient PLing mob, so I usually just root rotted him with the druid.  Chances are your PLee won't be able to resist his spells, so be careful with him! The healers in Kaesora are also annoying but not enough to detract from the overall EXP.<br />
<br />
Enjoy!  From 40-50 I'm not sure how realistic it is to have the druid tank. The saving grace is that since I play an enchanter I can toss a clarity on her and MAYBE if she has enough mana to keep healing herself it will prove to be efficient but I just don't think so at this point.  I think my tactics from here on out are going to be buff up my boyfriend's (Necro) pet and have the druid just babysit him and the enchanter.  Probably not going to update this until we hit 50, and only then if we actually &quot;powerlevel&quot; to get there and I find a good place to do so.  Next stop, City of Mist! <br />
<br />
40-46: The EXP and ability to effectively PL has REALLY slowed down here.  I stuck it out in Kaesora simply because with the zone exp modifier and the ease with which the druid can tank the mobs, it was just as quick as anything else out there.  My only other suggestion would be to charm kill, but I still think Kaesora is faster.<br />
<br />
Post 46: I'm now grouping the enchanter with the druid and charm killing in the planes.  I'm guessing this is how I'm going to PL the rest of my levels.  I hope this guide to the ever-tedious caster PLing helped a few of you out.  If you start on a Friday night you can get a caster to 46 over the weekend.  My only &quot;hangups&quot; were the occasional raid with my guild (as my druid) and the fact that I'm PLing TWO casters (my boyfriend's necro and my enchanter) and we also managed to run across the Ancient Cyclops, and by the time my enchanter had JBoots and I ported to SRo, it was up again. Lol.  Yay! :)  If anyone has any suggestions or questions, please let me know! :)<br />
<br />
Edit: One thing I neglected to mention -- root the werebats and tentacle/dark terrors.  Otherwise they will occasionally make a run for it.  But most of the monsters (undead) will just stand there and kill themselves like the good fodder that they are! Happy hunting!<br />
<br />
2nd Edit: Added information for levels 30-40, as well as corrected my play time.  I was accidentally quoting the time played on my boyfriend's Necro when in reality my time /played was lower than expected.<br />
<br />
3rd Edit: Added information for levels 40-46.</div></div><hr />

40-46 you should head to velks (druid bard and PLee). none of the character will be grouped (don't group the PLers) Have a bard load all thier AE dots, then have them start at the upper spider camp and train all the mobs to the bottom. Reccomended late at night when little or no people are in zone. pull to zone in, have the bard stand in the corner and play all songs. the PLee should PBAoE once (mojo sticks work great). after AEing the PLee should head to the bottm of the ramped area so they don't get mass attacked. When the bard see the mobs getting low or accidently kills one, he zones! this will leave 10-20 mobs at zone in low, moving slow, and dieing every 6 seconds from dots. the bards zones back in and plays the AE slow dots once more to finish off any resistant and slow moving mobs and zones back out. This results in nearly 1/4th a lvl if pulled right, med up mana between pulls, and lvl as nessasary.<br />
<br />
46-52 now you can GROUP (bard PLee, druid outside the group) with your PLee, take your little plee to lguk. Again use a bard, the bard and the plee can run around lguk dead side just playing all AE dots. split it up in to 3 large AEs, safehall to frenzy, frenzy to lord, and the other side of safehall. I think at my tops speed I was gaining a lvl every 90 to 120 minutes. you can squeeze up to 54 outta Lguk but its slowes down too much.<br />
<br />
Still trying to figure out 55-60, the quickest route... anything thats at elast 1.5% or better per kill..... not looking to swarm kite either.</div></div><hr />

What worked great for my enchanter was to AE the elementals with Gravity Flux at the entrance while the druid was porcupining them. They give the druid a fair beat down even at 65 with some AAs but while wedged into the corner you can channel NI heals off to keep you standing and of course pop SotW if things get really out of hand. To get and keep aggro initally use Bonds of Tunare several times and that with the heals should keep the mobs off the enchanter. Once you get the technique down you can probably get 4 lots of 5-6 mobs dropped before the entrance mobs repop. Note that the elemental crusaders are very annoying here as they constantly heal themselves. Best just to nuke them down with the main after the others die to save time.<br />
<br />
I found at 52 most of the elementals are lt blue and the xp has really dropped off so I have pursued other avenues to varying success. Parking the enchanter on a wall in PoD while my druid uses a charmed rat to chew through goos, rats and larvae is steady xp and relatively safe.</div></div><hr />

4-20 Paludal Caverns - DS/SLN/Regen and go...heal as needed but you can run through all the patogs and stuff easily (start with muck skimmers and grime tunnelers and move up).  It's best to stay away from the camps since there are usually groups<br />
<br />
20-24 Marus Seru - DS the druid and pot9, pull 50 mobs to the PLee and heal yourself to get agro.  Then either AE with the PLee once if you can, or tag all of the mobs (harder to tag em all though)<br />
<br />
24-30 Splitpaw is the best.  Here you can train the whole first level to the druid, using same DS/HP buff method and either AE the mobs or melee tag<br />

30-45 City of Mist.  Same tactics<br />
<br />
45-50 Spirocs...same thing<br />

50-55 tag along with the druid in PoN who quads<br />

<br />
Classes w/o Point Blank AE's (IE all but Necro, Wizard, Bard, Cleric, and Druid)<br />
1-4 - Field of Bone (anything)<br />
4-13 Kurns Tower (skeletons only)<br />
13-20 Paludal Caverns (Patogs or Bandits to start with, then bandits)<br />
20-30 Unrest Basement (anything in the basement, hags can be hard to deal with)<br />
30-35 Tower of Frozen Shadow (5th floor wedding party - they have low hp and dont hit to hard, the lvls fly. if you clear it kill the golems till repops happen)<br />
35-50 City of Mist (can stay in the stables area. can net about a lvl every 35-45 min until about 43, then it takes about an hour a lvl.)<br />
<br />
Now for classes with Point Blank Area of Effect spells<br />
<br />
1-20 Paludal (start near hollowshade and work your way. stick to patogs once lvl 13 or 14)<br />
20-30 Mistmoore (stick to the ground and front of the castle, closer to the castle you get, harder the mobs get)<br />
30-50 City of Mist (pull ent and stables area, however many the druid can handle at a time)<br />
<br />
(Incase you arent sure how PBAoE spells work for powerleveling this is what you do. you pull a train with the druid WITHOUT ds on (can be anywhere from 1-100 mobs as long as you can tank them with the druid). sit to lose some hp and heal yourself to get aggro. once you have aggro have the person let their PBAoEs fly. (if they get resists cast another, keep doing this until you think all the mobs are hit) then cast DS on yourself and sit (if needed) so the mobs kill themselves. - this is THE FASTEST way to powerlevel, PERIOD.)<br />
<br />
50-55 are my hardest places to level and am yet to find a place to my liking. once they hit 55 (or sooner if you get them flagged) head to Plane of Storms and let them leach while you charmkite loroks. will be 65 soon.</div></div><hr />

Mistmoore at level 20-30 is VERY good xp.  Granted, my new Druid was killing bright red mobs (porcupine + tash + DoT) but it was faster than Paludal.<br />
<br />
Splitpaw wasn't as noticable, although it could be that it's harder to porcupine caster mobs.</div></div><hr />

Multiply the lower level character by 3 and the higher char by 2 and if the lower char number is equal or higher they will get xp.<br />
<br />
For example:<br />
lvl 20 Shaman (20x3=60)<br />
lvl 30 Druid (30x2=60)<br />
Shaman will get xp.<br />
<br />
To help the Shaman get to lvl 20, you can give him buffs and damage shield and he can melee/DoT his way up there pretty easily.  You can also speed up the killing by adding nukes or DoTs, as long as he outdamages you.</div></div><hr />

I PLed a cleric there with my 63 druid and my druid was getting aggro from all kinds of crap.  The crap was doing enough damage to put the druid in danger.  I stayed outside and pulled from the graveyard back, and that was alright.  When the cleric hit 25, though, I took him to Gunthak and it was much easier to PL there.  My cleric is still low enough to stay in Gunthak, but I recently took my 40 Monk to Dulak.  The experience is disappointing compared to Gunthak.  When my Monk was at the last level in the recommended range for Gunthak, he was still getting 2% for most kills, maybe alternating 2 to 1 to 2...etc.  That was for dark blues.  In Dulak, he only gets 2% a kill no matter whether it's red, yellow, white, or dark blue.  It's not bad compared to old school zones, but it's not nearly as good as MM and Gunthak for their ranges.  I guess the levels are catching up to me.</div></div><hr />

<br />
What race was your monk?<br />
<br />
There is still a HUGE exp penalty for at least iksar and I assume Ogre, Troll.<br />
<br />
In fact so much so that even by around lvl 20, you'll find iksar are about .5 a level behind, by 22, they are nearly a level behind, by 40's they can be as much as 3 levels behind non-penalty races.  I know this first hand because I have a &quot;friend&quot; group on Morden rasp where 6 RL friends all started clean.  We've never solo'd exp past level 10.  We began playing all within 1 blue of each other (so roughly 1 blue into level 10).  By the time the group was 20, we had to break off the bst iksar and level him up.  Now we are 22 and we have to do it again, he is nearly .75 whole level behind, so when we dinged 22, I asked him where he was at, &quot;just over 1.5 yellow into 21&quot;.  Keep in mind we were again about 1 blue of each other from level 20-22.  Pisses me off really, I think it is BS to have any race or class penalty.<br />
<br />
I also have PL'd an Iksar Monk and stopped at 47 because I had to keep ungrouping him to get solo exp for 100's of kills just to get him to keep up with my froggy shaman.  I then turned to my 40 enchanter thinking the frog had just exp bonus or something.  Well, same issue, chanter is high-elf btw.<br />
<br />
If your monk is human, you can ignore this :p<br />

<br />
I've never heard of a &quot;maximum mob level limit&quot; for XP, but I believe there is an XP cap.  You can only get xx % of your level per kill, maximum.  I'm not sure what that is, but I think it's at least several blues.  That may scale down as you level up, but at level 9 you'd be better off getting the max buffs for your level (49 and under) and just slaughtering all kinds of blues.  You'll level up quickly.</div></div><hr />

1 - 9 FoB (kill everything in the pit or go to the area outside of the ruins near Kaesora)<br />
9 - 15 Kurn's Tower (Start by going up and down the tower stairs then go down to the basement)<br />
16 - 22 PC (Leave the bandit camps to the non pling groups...just crawl through the caves in the back)<br />
22 - 30+ LoIO (Go to the sarnak fortress and sit in the TR.  can get part of the char key)<br />
30+ - 39 Kaesora (Go all the way down to where Xag spawns get the other part of char key)<br />
39 - 50 Karnor's Castle (Camp the first building if entrance is taken)<br />
39 - 50 CoM (Entrance to start, then work your way in deeper and deeper)<br />
39 - 50+ Hole (This is a good alt to CoM. just crawl to outside and in the first building)<br />
most druids that are 58+ shouldn't have any problems keeping up with heals for these places.  this, of course, depends on both the pl'ers and the person being pl'ed gear.  as you get to the &quot;higher&quot; pling spots you will need to get as much mana regen as possible.  the outdoor zones are a plus, but not mandatory.  always try and go to a place that have yellow and red MoBs in it...in the higher zones dark blues work fine.  try to have as many mobs on the person being PL'd as you can keep the heals up with.  if it's only one...lay as many dot's on the mob as possible to not KS or take aggro.<br />

just some of my thoughts on PL'ing places and strats.<br />

Generally, its best to go to zones from original EQ or Kunark when PLing, mobs are alot weaker and have less hp.<br />
<br />
1-10 Steamfont: Start at the druid rings and work your way over to the mills.<br />
<br />
10-17 Unrest: The sheer amount of mobs roaming outside the estate makes this a great place. The death beetles and various zombies are a great load of exp. Also, since the mobs are undead...they wont be running.<br />
<br />
17-30 Upper Guk: Tons of mobs with a very large exp bonus in this zone. I genereally try to work my way up to the lower guk liveside zone in up to level 30. <br />
<br />
30-50:Lower Guk: It can be a bit of a stretch and a bit of monotony to grind all the way to 50 here, but these frogloks are incredibily weak and relatively low hp.<br />
     -killing frogloks for 20 levels can be quite boring, sometimes i will alternate and go to TOFS or Overthere (although overthere seems to not has the good exp bonus it used to =/ )<br />
<br />
50-55: City of Mist, the Hole, or Howling Stones. These levels are always the bottleneck for me when plvling, once your 55, you are set though.<br />
<br />
55-65: Plane of Storms. I'm sure we all remember charm kiting the loroks, conviniently enough, the loroks are great to powerlevel on, not convientionally though. I usually charm Plvl, (you can do this on rats in PoD also)<br />
    -setup and bring your characters to the forest area. Pull two loroks and charm one and send it on the other. However, it is imperative that do -Zero- dmg to the lorok that you are attacking. Once the lorok is down to about 3-4%, hit invis (innate camo works better). Your charmed lorok will break charm, of course, just root him or simply recharm. Meanwhile, the lorok you've been attacking will be just standing there idle (providing you snared him.) Have the character your plvling to finish off the remaining 3-4% of the loroks hp. BAM, solo exp. :) This gets boring quick but is excellent exp.<br />
<br />
65+: Hard to really plvl at this point, its best to just group your character with you. Kiting in pofire tables (if you can get flag), DoN Missions or oow zones.</div></div><hr />

Consider getting your cleric a fire flag, and grouping in castle2. The mobs are easy and huge exp. Basically camps are in Reparm tower (or rugs in some servers), entrance to castle2 and tables. Don't bother on tables... you want constant pulls so set up camp on first floor of reparm tower and pull your way up, then down. Entrance is pretty much static but tends to compete with rugs for pulls when they are out.<br />
<br />
If you can't do that, then try NC... it's slower exp but steady. If it's too easy then move up to WoS. Nwall is a good spot for WoS but usually perma camped. I'm not too familiar with NC though.</div></div><hr />

Edit: so I tried this out. Shrouded her to a warrior for an hour and then to a berserker for an hour, and took her to the shikniks in Paludal (a personal favourite place of mine as hardly anyone is ever there). With them ranging from white to yellow, in about an hour I got her two levels, and in two hours, she was 24 almost 25. I found that berserker works -alot- better as (at least reptile berserker) they have the Maul ability which costs v little end to use and did 30-40 dmg right off, so I was run to the mob Maul, move to the next. V easy. Will see how long it takes me to get bored of this place then will move to CoM or something.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">duzter</div><div class="date">03-14-2007, 09:38 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Here has been my recent powerleveling experiences given the current hotzones.<br />
<br />
There is an assumption made that the class being pl'ed has some form of PB AE spell. If the AE is not for a few levels, then just low level regen and dmg shield the plee in PC or FoB til AE level.<br />
<br />
Second assumption is that the druid has Reptile.<br />
<br />
1. Kurns(2-14): Have the druid without any regen or DMG SHIELDS run around and gather as many skeletons as possible. The thing to watch out for is getting too far from the mobs, as kunark mobs will give up if you get too far. Find a corner and sit a few times to take damage. Then cast reptile, which should provide all the aggro you need. Have the plee cast the PBAE spell once or twice depending on resists. Only after the ae is cast, have the druid cast their most powerful dmg shields on themselves. Watch carnage ensue when the druid sits down.<br />
<br />
Note: I said no regen so that your druid can take some damage for the reptile procs to heal the druid and build aggro.<br />
Note 2: I said no damage shields on the druid because the mobs will die during the rounding up process.<br />
Note 3: These mobs are skeletons, make sure the plee is further from the mobs than the pler or they will turn and splat.<br />
<br />
<br />
2. Unrest(14-22/25): Park the plee at ZI. Have the druid minus regen and minus dmg shield run and pick up as much of the first floor and basement as possible. Run back to zi where there is an excellent corner. Reptile for aggro. Plee casts PBAE. Pler casts uber dmg shields. Carnage. Repeat with upper levels. Wait for respawns. This can be taken to 25 ish( which I did with my cleric ), but I gave up at 22 or 23 with my bard and headed to the next zone.<br />
<br />
<br />
3. Lower Guk(22-46/49): <br />
a)Have the druid, with regen this time, run from ZI to bedroom. From bedroom go around and round up all the bats, spiders, gargoyles, those 6 skeletons, ass/sup room and nearby frogs on that level. Return to bedroom, where there is a corner. Run the plee over and have them cast their stuff. Cast the uber dmg shields and watch the carnage.<br />
b)Jump down with the druid to the safe hall area and get aggro on the few mobs prior to that hall. Run the plee down into the hall. Have the druid run from that area all the way back up towards ass/sup room picking up every single mob in the area. Having regen on during this time is fine, you can start leaving the big dmg shields up too while running around. Return to the safe hall, and setup shop in the first corner. Ensue carnage.<br />
c)Round up every mob on the way to frenzy spawn. Run back to safe hall. Carnage.<br />
d)Round up every mob on the way to ghoul lord. Run back for carnage time.<br />
<br />
Note: Watch out for nameds with pets. They will aggro the plee unless you cast a nuke on them first.<br />
Note 2: This is designed to pull all of lower guk undead in 4 pulls.<br />
Note 3: Given the sheer number of mobs per pull, you WILL need reptile to survive. This can be done at 70 for sure, but back then when I did this on my necro I needed to break up the pulls into smaller batches. <br />
Note 4: Have earthen roots ready, the final mob likes to run.<br />
Note 5: I use lesson in this area around level 37( when most mobs get hit by the AE.) You MUST camp the plee between pulls. If you do this, then you should have double exp for about 3 rounds through...about 3x the time you normally would get.<br />
<br />
The few classes I did this to took about 3-4 hours to get to 49. That is with using 1 lesson...and camping out the plee inbetween pulls while lesson is running.<br />
<br />
<br />
4. Karnor's Castle(49-63): Setup shop in hand room, but make sure you run a timer so you know when the hands will respawn.<br />
a)Pull the 4 hands and everything on the ramparts.<br />
b)Pull the bodyguards/drolvarg warlord + 6 cells on the way.<br />
c)Go down the stairs near hand room. Skeleton pulling time.<br />
d)Go down the stairs near hand room Skeleton pulling time.<br />
e)Go down the stairs near hand room Skeleton pulling time.<br />
<br />
Note: I did say the same thing thrice for a reason, you need to break up the pulls down there. Try to pull in groups of 12 or so, unless you can handle more...or less.<br />
Note 2: Just like in guk have earthen roots ready as some mobs when all their friends are dead will run.<br />
Note 3: I took KC to 53 on the two most recent characters. The one I took to 63 was when KC was a HZ, but no matter what expect exp to slow down to a relatively obscenely slow amount compared to the first 4 hours.<br />
<br />
-------------------------------------------<br />
Other hotzones:<br />
<br />
The Hole - didn't try this as I thought it was too close in level to lguk. Somebody doing something similar said it was okay for a few levels, and that you *could* take it to 65 but it slows way way way down. Given the key requirement and the out of the way placement I opted to skip this zone.<br />
<br />
Chardok - I didn't want to screw my faction, so skipped this zone. If memory serves, there are lots of healers around. Healers really really screw up this technique.<br />
<br />
Sebilis - The upstairs trash dies okay, there are gaters that are very annoying. There are healers that are very annoying. The downstairs stuff has too many healers (myconids esp) and a lot gate downstairs too making things a pain.<br />
<br />
Grieg's - Mobs hit too hard and dispell too much to pull more than 8 or so. They have tons of hp making it not very time effective. I might test this zone more, but with fabled going live today that is probably a bad idea. Many people were in this zone making it hard to do much.<br />
<br />
CT - Too many healers making it impossible to kill stuff effectively.<br />
<br />
Paw - Mobs hit upwards of 300-600. Cannot use this method at all.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Other zones tried:<br />
<br />
Droga - the initial trash was find and easy to clear. The deeper stuff killed the druid = bad.<br />
<br />
<br />
------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
<br />
With all the fabled going live today, I am at a loss of where to continue 53+.<br />
<br />
<br />
Edit: The druid I used was 75 with 10khp/10kmp epic 2.0 etc etc</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Karanthal</div><div class="date">04-26-2007, 03:17 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm currently leveling up a bard in my spare time after raids using the AE + damage shield method.  What you really need to focus on is finding the right level mobs where your AE will land reliably but the mobs arnt too low level.  When you get the perfect place you will level up each pull, obviously that wont last long as after 2/3 pulls your char will be too high a level to get the optimum xp so you do need to move around a fair bit.  Idealy if you can get a zone like scarlet where the mobs at the twilight side are a few levels lower than the plateu you can stay in one zone and just move around a little.<br />
<br />
My bard is currenly level 46, I have previously leveled a cleric to 65 using much the same method but the bard is proving much faster thanks to the mana free AE's.<br />
<br />
My druid is a little out of date now equipemnt wise, having just started raiding again after a year so I'm at around 8.5khps/10kmana unbuffed.<br />
<br />
So far I have done the following<br />
<br />
1-10 South Ro - I did try and go to netherbian straight away but it without being able to land AE's it proves to be very slow.  I want to SRo and pulled orcs/dervs for a while. Killed them single from 1-5, then AE'd what I could from then.<br />
<br />
Time: 1hr (because I moved around a bit)<br />
<br />
<br />
10-25 Netherbian Lair - Very fast leveling, initially killing groups of 3/4 with the damage shield and hit them in the back a couple of times method.  From ~17 upwards I was able to pull every Netherbian Warrior/Drone etc in 1 pull and AE them.  That was worth about 2 levels per clear.  After that clear the troggs to the south (they dont assist so make for bad AE mobs) and whatever you find at the other side but the netherbians are the best.<br />
<br />
Time: 2hrs<br />
<br />
25-27 Mons Letalis - Just because I was near by I tried out Mons letalis as I have leveled there before and there are loads of mobs.  I just stood in the middle of the zone playing an ae DoT.  Too many runners though, mobs would run in, get hit by damage shield and run off again.  Wasnt great.<br />
<br />
Time: 1hr<br />
<br />
27-46 Scarlet Desert - Slow initially as my DoT wouldnt land thanks to mobs being in their high 30s/early 40s.  I did level 36-44 in around 40 minutes though (with lesson up).  Started off pulling all (~20 mobs) the van ren's and and roamers near twilight, 2nd pull moved along the wall a bit and pulled everything from around the lake and the next grol camp, finally pulled all of the blood's from the 2 caves + any roamers.  Moved up to the plateau and pulled all of the trojeg (single pull) then all of the sun reveneants.  As I had some lesson left I pulled a group of 20ish from the bottom up to the plateu too.  I tend to refresh reptile skin and bark spur as soon as they are available.<br />
<br />
Time: 3hrs (not ideal, I came here too early, would advise waiting until 35)<br />
<br />
I should have probably looked at iceclad before scarlet for a few levels as I used to PL there quite a lot anyway, cougars were great xp even without a HoT zone, although I thought there might not be enough mobs to go around.<br />
<br />
I'll need to move in a couple of levels as the tro jeg and reavers are even con's now.  I'll be looking to keep with the HoT zones if I can.  Drank scar ill try next as I cant think of enough mobs in burning woods of suffcient level for my method, I might move to the old favourite Karnors Castle and I would like to experiment with Greigs End if OoW mobs prove to be too anoying.  <br />
<br />
Dragon Necropolis sounds good, although its a bit of a pain to run to.  I've tended to just level up for an hour or so after raids rather than 1 long session.  Ive never really spend much time in DN other than a couple of bard epics, so itll be a chance to look around as much as PL which keeps it interesting.</div></div><hr />

after a bit of a break for 2 years I'm PLing up mine and my partners toons. We've been using duzter's method above and wow is it fast! Thanks for describing this as its a method and location we wouldn't have thought of.<br />
<br />
One question though- what is &quot;lesson&quot;? You mentioned using this a few times to increase XP, and its not a phrase or ability we're familiar with- I guess its another thing thats come along in the couple of years since we last played...<br />

If you can manage tanking on your druid use your druid to tank, if not get a tank if you plan to do massive pulls.  In the first SS here from Dranik Scar you can click and see the bard mentioning how the alt got 3aa's in that pull.  I think it was a level 55 shammy at the time.   I've done lvl 37-42 in 1 pull with a warrior tanking in Acrylic Caverns because it was a hot zone.  As much as people talk about useing this in this zone and that i suggest trying it in the hot zone first as it's payouts are vast.  The second SS is from a pull in gunthak that just makes me smile to look at.  I think it was somewhere around 200 mobs those that know the zone, it was everything from the beach to Dulak ent including the fort minus however many mobs got lost which doesnt appear to be many heh.<br />

<br />
With a bard the order is simple for having him pull.   Which i suggest for 50+ so you can start buffed.<br />
~&gt; Bard pulls <br />
~&gt; Cast reptile on self after being buffed out to the max <br />
~&gt; Bard stand out from corner then cast a heal, instruct the bard to fade the second the heal lands on him as only half of the mobs will leave on the heal.<br />
~&gt; Reptile builds the agro while DS works them down a little<br />
~&gt; After 3 reptiles agro should be locked and you aoe on the alt.  (If you cant aoe get a Holgresh Mojo Stick (http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=4312) or a Holgresh Mojo Stick (http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=3962) they allow you to click from inventory)<br />
~&gt; Bard sings DS song and ae-slow when needed for rerepting and healing<br />
~&gt; Spam Fernspur, Barkspur, Hungry Vines, and Wrath of Wild as often as they pop<br />
~&gt; Pray your mana lasts longer than the ammount of mobs you pulled does</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'm PLing a mage w/ my Beastlord (suboptimal PLer at least) doing the pincushion.<br />
<br />
My goals were:<br />
No pulling needed - mobs should auto-agro<br />
Little movement between zones/close to PoK<br />
Good xp /duh.<br />
<br />
1-20 - Potion of Skinspikes on the mage, in Crescent Reach.  Took a few hours since I was farting around.<br />
20-30 - Feerrott Lizards - agro is based on faction, but you get very KOS quickly<br />
30-46 - Gunthak beach, then fort<br />
46 'til grouped - Nadox luggald area.  With the current 25% Frostfell xp bonus I get 11AAs/clear of the luggald area on mage (2 pulls) w/o lesson at 51.  Takes about 9 minutes to have them die w/ only 78 damage shield on me. 7% reg xp/yellow mobs - not the best I'm sure, but easy as hell, and mobs are plentiful.<br />
<br />
I managed about 60AAs and 4 levels during a Lesson run (camping mage out until shortly before mobs were dying on each pull), took about 2 hours at least to run it out :).  Was expanding my pulls to include about 10 undead, and 10 live trolls from the area as well, and should be able to handle a few more per pull if I'm smart.  Will be maxing AAs at 55, and might stick around for the ones at 59 as well (thought I might hit up Hole or somewhere instead).  Any ideas on other mass-pull capable places that hit softer than PoP?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Daldaen</div><div class="date">01-07-2009, 09:58 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">So I recently finished gearing myself up from SoD T5 zones so I went out to test out AoE PLing again.  I managed to raise a guildies magician from 50 to 60 in about an hour and that was fairly slow... I could've gone faster if I were boxing them both myself.  The two zones I tested out were PoInnovation and CoDecay.  PoI was extremely easy just grabbing around 30-40 at a time, however the zone is somewhat rough due to the fact that there are only several 90 degree corners and most are located in the factory.  CoDecay was a bit tougher for a druid with my gear level (around 34k HP with Wild Growth, and 3.3kAC).  For CoD if I wanted to keep up pulls like the ones I was pulling of in PoI I needed to pop my T5 merc.  The mobs in CoD have a ton more HP but both zones provided great exp.  I would highly suggest you do PoI from 46-51 then stock up 30AAs go to 55, spend said AAs and get all the worthwhile AAs for that class at level 55 bank another 30 continue to 59 then move to CoD.  I'm fairly certain if I could box a 2nd account I could go from 1-65 in under 3 or 4 hours now-a-days.  If I were doing that I would most likely use the following zones:<br />
<br />
1-15 - Paladul<br />
15-25 - Mistmoore<br />
25-40 - Lower Guk<br />
40-50 - Nadox<br />
50-60 - PoInnovation<br />
60-65 - CoDecay<br />
 <br />
Then if I were to have someone shroud up to stock up on AAs, I would prolly grab a 51-55 AoEing classes (preferably a bard) and head to PoI and go crazy there.  I think you can get around 4-5AAs a pull there when the shrouded Toon + AoEing class are grouped and splitting exp.</div></div><hr />
