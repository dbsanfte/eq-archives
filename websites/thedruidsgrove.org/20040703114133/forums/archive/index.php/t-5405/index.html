<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">dreamguardian1</div><div class="date">10-25-2003, 06:37 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I have some concerns regarding Everquest II coming out in 2004 maybe some other characters have pros and cons regarding this as well.  I wonder what is going to happen to Everquest are they gonna eventually weed it out and all its expansions?  Are they oing to create new expansions for EQ or just for EQ II.  You cant transfer characters to EQ II, cant use anything you have in EQ on EQ II.  This is not good.  I honestly dont wat to pay for two separtae accounts.  I have been an avid EQ fan for 5 years and have worked hard for what i have earned in EQ.  But EQ II, comeon.  If they were to link the two it wouldnt be so bad.  Or if you could hae the same account ut just create a new character but they going a little too far with this.  I dont know ay ideas from others.</div></div><hr />

<br />
also on a side note, i know many many eq players who will most certainly not be playing eq2, myself included.</div></div><hr />

Two whole guilds practically have said they will not be playing and each of those quilds hae like 150 people in them who are 55 +.  I am glad to hear though of more expansions for EQ.</div></div><hr />

item decay + SOE CS = the suck<br />

thus, EQ2 = severe suck, and I shall not be playing it.</div></div><hr />

But the All Access Pass is good, it gives you access to like 4 or 5 games for $20~. You can only play on one game at once, but *shrugs* Cheaper then paying for the accounts indiviually if you play them. Only games I can think of offhand included in it are EQ, EQ2, and Planetside.<br />
<br />
And yes, it's good that you can't use anything from EQ in EQ2. It's a tottaly different time frame, and it's much better for them to start fresh. The whole structure of the class system is going to be quite a bit different (more akin to MUDs then D&amp;D style), and the druids of EQ2 may end up nothing like the druids of EQ1.<br />
<br />
As for the expansions, unknown, but EQ still has two expansions I believe they said. I know there is at least one &quot;raid&quot; expansion to come.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Either way, they should give more options then just the monthly All Access Pass IMO.  A slight saving (as with the current model) would be in order for the 3 month, 6 month, etc etc...  because hey, they're only letting you play one of the games at a time anyway.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">DemonMage</div><div class="date">10-25-2003, 10:22 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'd probably rather just pay for EQ and EQ2 seperatly (assuming it gets re-added to the All Access), that way I could still camp stuff on EQ well I'm accutaly playing EQ2! =-p<br />
<br />
Though, depending on how much I'm enjoying EQ2, I'd probably rather just cancel EQ, since any MMORPG &quot;requires&quot; a lot of time into it, better to just focus on one. Also depending on when WoW comes out, and how much I enjoy that too, playing 3 is definently not something I'd want to do =-p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Geddine</div><div class="date">10-26-2003, 03:30 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yeah I agree, MMORPG's require alot of time to them, I don't think there is enough time to split between more than 1 and I have tried a couple of times.  I don't have enough time to play EQ as much as I'd like.<br />
<br />
As for EQ2, it was said from the outset the game is so different other than storyline nothing else will be carried forward from EQ1.  Even Vah Shir magically turn into Kerrans (I had a theory in Luclin that the Vah Shir were created becuase everyone guessed the cats would be Kerrans and Sony just wanted to prove everyone wrong).<br />
<br />
I don't like the idea of item decay much either, so far I have never seen it done correctly in a game (in otherwords not a PITA).  But MMORPGS which have tradeskills (most in not all do) need to keep items going out of the game almost as fast as they can come in.  1 failing that the EQ1 market place has.<br />
<br />
If I was to play EQ2 (hopefully will be rapped up in Horizons by then) I would be looking for a familiar surroundings with a whole new gameplay experience, rather than just a more modern EQ1</div></div><hr />

<br />
EQ1 is $13.00 a month.  EQ2 is going to be at least that much.  All Access Pass is $21.95.<br />
<br />
Definately makes sense to get if you only play EQ1 and EQ2.</div></div><hr />

I recall them saying a while back that they removed EQ2 from the site since it isn't released and they don't want to confuse people but that it'll definitely be included in the All Access Pass.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You people are ridiculous.  The lack of item decay is one of the biggest things that ruined the economy in EverQuest.  NOTHING EVER LEAVES THE GAME.  I still have my newbie dagger on my rogue hidden in my bank.<br />
<br />
SWG has item decay and the ability to repair the items.  And it's economy would be better, but for game bugs with resource shifts and duping exploiters.<br />
<br />
You're trying to put your expectations of EQ2 into an EQ mold.  EQ and EQ2 are going to be completely different styled games.  You can't just expect to be able to log on to EQ2 and do the same damn thing you've been doing since you started EQ.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Scirocco</div><div class="date">10-26-2003, 02:50 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">You people are ridiculous. The lack of item decay is one of the biggest things that ruined the economy in EverQuest. <br />
<br />
<br />
You are probably even more ridiculous.   <br />
<br />
First, because you fail to recognize that many people play games like this to have fun, and having to constantly maintain (or potentially lose) items and equipment is not fun.   Even assuming that the idea of an &quot;economy&quot; in the context of a game like EQ or EQ2 is even feasible, or that the economy in EQ is &quot;ruined.&quot;<br />
<br />
Second, because you denigrate anyone who does not agree with your concept of how a game should be played.  Just because people disagree with you and dislike item decay does not make them &quot;ridiculous.&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bartleby</div><div class="date">10-26-2003, 04:44 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Amen brotha Scirocco -<br />
<br />
But honestly, item decay is a bad move, imagine if your MT is whalloping away at fight something like the Xegony encounter and his weapon breaks, well then what he hell do you do?  /camp?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Aly</div><div class="date">10-26-2003, 04:54 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">First, because you fail to recognize that many people play games like this to have fun, and having to constantly maintain (or potentially lose) items and equipment is not fun.<br />
<br />
See... there you go getting into that EQ mindset... when it's not about EQ.  It's about EQ2.  If items decay... then why would they make such idiotic timesinks required to get good gear?  Of course, no one wants to spend 40 hours camping a single mob for one rare drop only to have their precious phat lewt break in a few weeks. <br />
<br />
That's why the godly loot will be immune to decay, but they're most likely going to be no drop as well.  That way items like that never disrupt the economy.  In SWG, I have one of the best FWG5 pistols you can buy.  It's been sliced down to an attack speed of 1.4 seconds.  It has a condition of 945 out of 1000.  That's after using it for several weeks.<br />
<br />
Unless I get into PvP and some pistoleer decides to disarming shot me, I'm not gonna have to worry about replacing my pistol for several months.  Maybe not even for a year.  I'm pretty sure that a lot of the item decay rates will be similar in EQ2 as they are in SWG.  It's a working system if they just had not had so many bugs and resource duping exploits early in the game.<br />
<br />
Again, you're trying to put your vision of EverQuest onto EverQuest2.  They're not the same game.  They're never gonna be the same game.  And you people need to realize that.  They're doing something different.  Stay in EQ.  Please! I'm tired of the vocal majority getting their way because they whine and moan about every little thing.<br />
<br />
Even assuming that the idea of an &quot;economy&quot; in the context of a game like EQ or EQ2 is even feasible, or that the economy in EQ is &quot;ruined.&quot;<br />
<br />
It is feasible... as long as products leave the game permanently.  Platinum never really disappears in EverQuest... a +2 Wisdom Ring made four years ago by some novice enchanter is still around now.  As good as new.  Nothing ever decays.  And that's bad.<br />
<br />
Because platinum doesn't leave the game fast enough, we have people with 100's of thousands of platinum just sitting around.  We have people with millions of platinum in the bank.  It causes massive inflation.  If items decayed and needed repairing, there'd be a great platinum sink.  It'd also create another Demand in the market.  The jewelcrafter that makes and sells a +6 Wisdom Ring isn't just competing with other jewelcrafters, but himself and every customer he sells a ring to, because once made, those rings never leave the game.<br />
<br />
Item decay would do a world of good for EverQuest... but that would bring out every single damn one of the whiners and they won't do that... so they're putting it in EverQuest2.  If something as mundane and petty as item decay is gonna keep you out of the game... good riddance.<br />
<br />
edit:<br />
<br />
But honestly, item decay is a bad move, imagine if your MT is whalloping away at fight something like the Xegony encounter and his weapon breaks, well then what he hell do you do? /camp?<br />
<br />
Find yourself a new MT as they should have been paying attention to the condition of their weapons and armor.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Noliniel</div><div class="date">10-26-2003, 05:29 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Aly, First of all, you should stop relating how does this and that with SWG.  EQ 2 isn't SWG, EQ isn't SWG. We don't play the game that is called SWG ! We all have different play styles and views so if other people don't like the idea of item decay, is their own point.<br />
<br />
For Example: Stay in EQ. Please! I'm tired of the vocal majority getting their way because they whine and moan about every little thing.  People are not whining, they just having their own point of view, people don't play EQ in the same way you  do. People save up platium to buy things like horses etc.. If item declay starts, how you going to afford these things?  I am not trying to turn this into a rant but your post is just totally off the scale maybe?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Scirocco</div><div class="date">10-26-2003, 06:41 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Stay in EQ. Please! I'm tired of the vocal majority getting their way because they whine and moan about every little thing. <br />
<br />
<br />
The vocal majority tend to get their way because they are the majority, and thus provide bigger market share and more revenue to companies that provide entertainment products that they (the majority) like.<br />
<br />
If you are saying that EQ 2 is intended to be more of a niche game aimed at a submarket, like Shadowbane, then that's fine.   Somehow, though, I think SOE is aiming EQ 2 at a larger, more profitable audience.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">DemonMage</div><div class="date">10-26-2003, 07:27 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Thing is, item decay won't make it a niche market. UO and DAoC have a rather large customer base, and both have item decay. Though UOs item decay is even more of a joke then before. If you bothered to even pay a little attention to keep your gear in repair in UO before, you would be able to use the same gear for a VERY long time. You're more likely to lose it from death, then decay. Now, repairing an item no longer can make it lose maximum durability, so there's really no way to lose your items, can even insure them so they don't drop on death. And, a lot of people are bitching about both of these factors, as it removed the item decay from game, and people no longer have a use for crafters. You either a) have a nice magic armor set you can keep forever b) bought one set of armor from a crafter and probably will never need another.<br />
<br />
I can understand people not enjoying item decay. It usually doesn't bother me, since it's all in how it's done, not the idea itself. Item decay really isn't the answer for removing items from the game though, it usually doesn't. UO/DAoC/SB you could keep the item in repair for as long as you were gonna use it, and probably even be able to pass it on to someone else.<br />
<br />
Sure, you could make it so someone wouldn't get much resonable use out of a piece of equipment, but then you lower the fun factor by a lot. THat's one thing I didn't like about DAoC, the con system on armor/weapons, where by leveling, but contining to fight the same things, your armor/weapons could suddenly become near useless, and you had to replace them every couple levels.<br />
<br />
Item decay generally serves it's place more as money sink, or forced player interaction, then it does as overall item removal.<br />
<br />
[Edit] Also, a poster above said that the +2 wisdom ring I used is still around somewhere. So? Some newbie is probably getting use out of it. Good for them. Hell they maybe even got it free, or for cheaper then I payed for it, and are having just a little bit more fun because of that.<br />
<br />
People have hundreds of thousands of plat or millions, so? There are tons of good equipment that people can buy now-a-days for cheap. (Edit Clarification: Just because people have a lot of money, doesn't mean everything costs TONS of plat for good stuff) Don't you think some of these people are having more fun with their centi longswords, then they would with a bronze longsword? Not to mention that the later expansions are designed around people using more powerful weapons and armor then bronze, and they need that kind of stuff to survive more resonably.<br />
<br />
Could the game use more platinum sinks? Sure, I loved horses, they removed quite a bit of money from the economy in one chunk. It doesn't have to be reoccuring to be an effective platinum sink. Having enough options can make it effective. And the way they did horse upgrading was an ok way to cut into the platinum supply, if more people wanted the faster horses.<br />
<br />
For instance if they put 50+ spells on a vendor, we'd continually have more people leveling up to those levels, and needing those spells, so they would likely end up buying at least some of them.<br />
I doubt many people would complain if they could save up 15k and buy Torpor on a vendor, instead of hoping there is a copy up in the bazaar and in the price range they can reach. And having it on an NPC vendor means everytime someone buys that copy of Torpor, poof goes 15k, and since it's scribed into book, they have no way to resell it.</div></div><hr />

(unless for those lore junkies).<br />
<br />
Think of this, most people already upgraded their PCs when Luclin came out, I doubt they would want to upgrade again for a whole new game in which they have to start from scratch again.<br />
<br />
Take UO as an example. Even with the plethora of MMORPGs around there are still people that play UO... and it's old as hell!!!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">dreamguardian1</div><div class="date">10-26-2003, 09:22 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">WOW!! I never figured this topic wold turn into such a heated debate.  Which was not my intent to bash others fortheir views as some have done.  Each person is entiled to their own views in this matter.  I for one wilol not be playing EQ2, i really like EQ i have sepent several years leveling numerous accounts, saving money accumulating items.  For those who save PLAT whoo hoo im happy for them. I cant evr seem to have enough.  SPells constantly cost plat have to upgrade my characters every chance i get.  Just sold 4.5K of goods in the bazaar overnight and bam i spent i tthe next day on needed items.  KINYENYA my now lvl 46 druid i sgetting ready to be married on EQ server SARYN i couldnt be happier.  I hope EQ stays and continues to expand.  I do have concerns though regarding EQ2.  I dont think it is wise and is pretty much just gonna be a run-off of EQ.  Change is difficult for  alot of people.  But for this druid im happy if they just make expansions for EQ.  In my opinion that is their main moneymaker.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">DemonMage</div><div class="date">10-26-2003, 09:27 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Main reason people are able to save up large amounts of plat in EQ is because there's only so much you can buy at 65 that's an upgrade. The rest you either have to camp, or raid for, or now adventure for. There's not a whole lot I want to spend my money on, though my girlfriend and I are working up tradeskills, so I'm sure we'll be draining a large amount of our funds on that. After we've got them all to 220+ though, I'll be back where I am. Not much worth spending the money on for myself or her, and with the recommended levels, not a whole lot worth twinking with.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Items wear out after so much use.  It's a fact in that game and there's only so many times you can repair those items.  It's a fact in that game that you get used to and understand is always going to be there.  Most of the problem you people have is your trying to shove your narrow minded EQ views onto EQ2, just because you expect them to be damn near the same game.</div></div><hr />

I planned to upgrade my PC specifically for SW:G, but didn't like the game.  Trying to scam a way to get a new one for Horizons but finances aren't looking good.<br />
<br />
As for Item Decay, it is not a bad thing, it may not get items out of the game but it removes money from the game in the way of repair.  Item Decay is not so bad if done like SW:G (the last I seen it)  items decayed slowly enough there was no risk of it disappearing in the middle of a fight (or even a play session).  I think with dedicated tradeskill classes items will be created so fast people need not worry about decay too much.</div></div><hr />

Not bad However i noticed he commented that they were not out to steal players and thats fine.  But i also noticed there were no comments regarding other issues that have been discussed here in this forum that other players felt were issues.  And even though he says they are not out to steal players I agree with that however i have learned that Sony is out to make money any way it can which is understandable considereing it is a business.  But i still feel there money would be best spent continueing to make exansions to EQ.  And i personally dont care if it is part of the all access pass if i cant use any of my current characters with eq2 than i really dont want it.  Spent too much time and plat getting what i got to let it all go hehehe.  I mean comeon seriously all.  They say EQ2 is supposed to be 500 years in the future so how would it interact with eq.  Well they created Shadows of Luclin, where the hell did the satellite come from who built it, we got aliens and so on and so forth you get the idea.<br />

1- Its by Sony.  They have demonstrated a lack of concern for customers.  Every once in a blue moon you get a gem of service, but on the whole they don't.  Therefore, they don't need any more of my money.<br />
<br />
2- I barely have time for one online game, certainly not for two.<br />

<br />
No.  Hell no.  I don't want EQ2 to be like SWG.  There's just not enough content in SWG that's static for my tastes, but I've found a small group that I enjoy grouping with and roleplaying with.  There's also the thrill of mass PvP battle with tons of people in full ST Armor.  It just feels cool to be charging up a hill with the intent of slaughtering rebels.<br />
<br />
I want them to take what they did right in EQ and what they did right in SWG and mix them together... without game breaking bugs and lame exploiters.  That's a herculean task... I know.  But one can hope.<br />
<br />
You said it, SWG enconomy isn't perfect. So I guess SOE is dumb enough to making the same mistakes? Sorry I am confused.<br />
<br />
It's not the same mistakes.  SWG uses a completely different kind of code base.  There were exploits that allowed people to dupe millions of resources.  Millions of the best resources and that drove prices for resources way down.  The people playing the proper way couldn't compete.<br />
<br />
People were exploiting certain missions worth 25k a pop.  That drove prices for items way up.  It wasn't anything wrong with the economy model.  It was bugs and exploiters that nearly ruined it.  However, now that the bugs and exploits have been squashed... things can start to normalize... becuase... and here's the key... I'll make it bold so you don't miss it... items decay and leave the game as well as credits being used up and disappearing forever as well.  Unlike in EQ, where if someone was able to dupe items/platinum without getting caught, they could keep and use them forever.<br />
<br />
The influx of massive amounts of credits and resources could even be worked into the storyline for SWG and be a part of the game history from an RP point of view.  Perhaps official random events could be worked into the game later on that could simulate market crashes, inflation, and more.  And one of the biggest reasons you can do this in SWG, is because items eventually do decay and you're required to pay matinence on your homes and harvesters and factories and such.  You have to pay to repair your weapons and armor.  And the credits spent on these services and such are taken out of circulation.<br />
<br />
That's what makes the economy in SWG work.  EQ2 has to have that or else it'll turn into another tedious game of who can farm the most platinum.</div></div><hr />

It’s not like you could have seen it in action since these dupes/exploits have always existed.  There could easily be other problems with it which you aren’t aware of.<br />
<br />
EQ does have item decay in the form of nodrop items.  When I upgrade a nodrop item, that item is to all intents and purposes gone from the game.  It may sit in my bank for a while but is not useful in any way, and eventually will find its way to the destroy button.<br />
<br />
Platinum also disappears from the game in the form of peridots and other spell components.  Tradeskills suck a lot of platinum from the economy since a lot of the items people produce while skilling up are either destroyed or sold to a vendor at a loss.<br />
<br />
Platinum has an actual value these days in the sense that with enough platinum you can buy practically anything.  In the early days of EQ the economy was pretty much barter only since platinum didn’t have any uses.  The fact that you may need 100,000 platinum to buy something rather than 10,000 or 1,000 platinum doesn’t signify a broken economy, just different values for items.</div></div><hr />

There is certainly a lot of misinformation that gets spread around about our game, but despite that I don't feel forums like this are the best way to go about posting corrections. I'd have to do so on every class board, which is not really an effective way to go about it.<br />

Making gear become no drop after  a trade would have the same effect (ie you buy this BP, but you can't pass it on to someone else afterwards).  Perhaps you buy a BP from one crafter, and a JC made augment from another.  You combine the two to get a very nice item, but you can't strip the augment and it becomes no drop afterwards.  There, no more resale.<br />
<br />
There are a number of things I have read about EQ2, most notably, that the best gear will be crafted, and will involve components that are drops from hard to kill (raid?) mobs.  That alone will create a driving need for developing tradeskills.<br />
<br />
My view is that there are levels of realism that are just not fun.  Item decay is one of those for me.  I don't really feel my perspective is invalid just because Aly says so.  I really don't think that item decay on its own will &quot;fix&quot; any game economy.  I can endure item decay some of the tmie, but I don't really feel a driving need to try for EQ2.  I will buy the game and try it out, but my gut tells me I will not be in the Norrath of the future.  <br />
<br />
If I am looking at starting a fresh character, I would sooner do that in a fresh setting and game.<br />
<br />
Consumables help, but again, not on their own.  Perhaps the ability to craft a lot of special purpose gear so that rather than having &quot;a breastplate&quot; you make 7 different ones you use situationally.<br />
<br />
But honestly, I think the BIGGEST issue for tradeskills and the economy is having tradeskill paths that develop rationally, and that result in gear that is defnitely worth the pain of skilling up to make.  Lowbie gear will be plentiful (as it should be really) but end game gear will be rare and costly since no matter jpw we;; the trade interface is designed not everyone will be willing to spend the time pursuing it.<br />
<br />
This CAN INDEED work.  And yes, that can mean that a lot of journeymen tradeskillers have to get by on low incomes, but it is making the entire path worhtwhile that matters.  If the gear is good enough, there will always be a market for it.  That is really the only thing that needs to be fixed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Aly</div><div class="date">10-28-2003, 11:01 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm sorry, but making gear No Drop does not fix the economy either.  EQ's economy is completely fubar'd anyway.  No drop gear would just frustrate people that would like to pass their old, nearly worn out gear on to someone else.<br />
<br />
My first pistol and set of armor I bought in SWG was used quite extensively and the condition on them was really running low... so I bought some new better looking armor and a much better version of my pistol.  I could've stuffed that old junk into the bank and forgotten about it, but instead I handed the set off to some newbie I overheard having some problems.<br />
<br />
They get some more use out of the gear until it finally breaks or wears out and then they can buy their own.  Sometimes I'm sadistic enough to force people to roleplay before I give them anything and require some token from them as well. <br />
<br />
The point is, the gear will leave the game eventually, regardless of how much money is spent buying and repairing the items, which takes money out of circulation as well.  The tradeskill market is alive and well in SWG, but prices are still a bit skewed because of the exploiters.  They'll normalize eventually.<br />
<br />
I can only hope that the economy in EQ2 is half as good as that of SWG (barring exploitable bugs) and item decay is a big part of that.</div></div><hr />

I missed that line the first time read through the post.  SWG has that.  Almost to a T.  There are different vulnerabilties and resistances for armor and weapons do different types of damage.  Some creatures are nearly immune to heat damage so I have to switch from my best pistol (the FWG5 which does heat damage), to my Scout Blaster, which does energy damage.<br />
<br />
Plus there's the whlole bio-engineered clothes market and skill enhancing attachments.  Dancers and musicians often have seven or more outfits for various dances and songs.  Granted they don't wear out... but I bet some kind of item decay could be added to them.  It just wouldn't be nearly as fast as weapons and armor wear out.</div></div><hr />

Actually I think I'd hate that more than item decay.  I hate having to switch items in and out.  Hell I go without buffs becuase I hate having to switch spells in and out all the time.<br />
<br />
When playing SW:G in Beta we found one set of armour blocked ranged attacks but did nothing for melee, the next set did melee but not ranged.  All I could think of was that somewhere in that path there better piece of around that did both or I was out of that game for good.  So much of the game was bad I never got to find out what else there was.<br />
<br />
Going to find a new item every few months from a trader becuase my old one is wearing out is way better than having to buy 5 sets of everything of a trader (only to upgrade later with another 5 sets) and then continually 6-7 times a night switch gear around (not only that but carry it all around).  Talk about an inconvienence.<br />
<br />
Item Decay has the added benefit for me in that when the item is getting to the end of its days, not only do you go looking for a relacement item but you'll generally look for one that is an upgrade.  Item Decay as it was in SW:G at the time I was in there was a fair system, there was enough traders around that there was a plethra of item for sale in the market (a little too much actually) yet items didn't decay in days or weeks but months (although that's most likely changed now).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Oldoak</div><div class="date">10-29-2003, 05:17 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I think I made it sound more complex than I meant it to.<br />
<br />
Think more about how warrior weapons work now in EQ.  A typical tank will have a bag full of weapons they use in different situations.  They will have gotten them over time, yes but a large part of that mix is about what they are doing in that play session.<br />
<br />
MA?  Double hate procs.<br />
<br />
Not in the MA lineup but maybe need to be read?  Maybe a hate proc and a dps.  Or a good big boom 2hs.<br />
<br />
I threw out my idea quickly before, but this would be more along the lines of say having a BP that is good when you need FR, and another that is good when you need high AC.  And yes, having those matter of course.  And not having gear that is &quot;super best of everything&quot; at every level of the game.  And having situations that don't rely on having good stats in every area all at the same time.<br />
<br />
I used to do this fairly often myself.  Just really the resist gear concept, except souped up.  Think of it maybe like being able to get situational foci - use this one when you are dotting, this one when you are facing an AOE, etc.<br />
<br />
Never means you HAVE to have every option...but if the game made you WANT to have every option, there would be plenty for tradeskillers to do.<br />
<br />
Still, I think tradeskills are a lost cause in EQ...and I doubt very, very much I would be willing to overlook deterioration in EQ2 for very long.  Again, I just find it an arbitrary thing to be realistic about.  And I don't believe for a minute it will fix anything, not in a game where the best gear is mob dropped.<br />
<br />
I ask you....<br />
<br />
* When was the last time your character slept?<br />
* How often does your character bathe?<br />
* Has your character EVER gotten sick...I mean just sick, not poisoned or diseased?<br />
* How likely is it that you can run across a continent in 3 days?<br />
* Could you do it without getting tired?<br />
* Could you carry around 300 pounds of junk in 8 backpacks while you did it?<br />
* If someone were to be stabbed in the gut, do you think they would heal up on their own in a few hours time?<br />
* If a man dies in the middle of the woods to foul play, would every other person of his tribe, anywhere in the world, along with all his enemies and their tribes, know about it, and who did it?<br />
<br />
It may seem I am being arbitrary, but ALL of those items are aspects of game mechanics in other RPG's I have played (ok, maybe not the bathing, but all the rest).  Drawing a line here in EQ and saying &quot;OMG it is meaningless without deterioration&quot; is, well, arbitrary.  I understand you are claiming that this is part of the &quot;economy.&quot;  I would answer that no game has succeeded in creating a player economy that is stable, and I doubt they ever will, unless the game is solely about economics.  Economic issues are vastly complex, and pushing in this one element to force more demand will not be a magic bullet.  And I don't think it would be a desireable change.<br />
<br />
As I have seen item decay play, it generally means that everyone and their cousin needs to develop in a repair tradeskill so they can do field repairs on equipment.  And they have to go to NPC's or PC's for more extensive, expert repairs.  And those systems usually have the oh so delightful chance to completely destroy the item you are repairing.  The mechanics of every decaying gear solution I have seen do nothing but annoy me.  It means that the game needs to work MUCH harder and MUCH better to keep me interested, because there is a big fat hairy spider sitting in the middle of it and I have to keep being distracted.<br />
<br />
I am curious why you think that one solution that takes items out of the resale market is so terrible while the other is superior.  Both have the same end result.  My suggestion is actually the faster path to that goal.  <br />
<br />
The reality is that during the leveling up process you will replace your gear anyway, so fatigue may not even have time to damage your gear before you get something new.  We really ultimately are debating about the end game.  And in EQ, the endgame is mob drops.  And I think it will be in EQ2 as well.  So, again, the economy will be dead before it starts.<br />
<br />
But, truth to tell, I don't think that is such a bad thing.  If I wanted to play an economics game, I would find something about economics.  In a fantasy RPG, I want magic and elves and trolls and adventure and magic swords etc.  Leave the macroeconomic crap for the daytime as far as I am concerned.<br />
<br />
And ultimately, my greatest concern for EQ2 is that the early stages of information released seemed to indicate the game was going to go a bit mad for realism.  No global banks at first.  Aging of characters IIRC.  Item wear and tear.  etc.  You quickly approach a point where, whether you like tradeskills or not, you can never escape them.  And that is not a good thing in game design.  There are a LOT of players out there who never want to do a tradeskill combine, not ever.  In fact, in EQ, I would say they are the majority.</div></div><hr />

  That is why I don't really see a problem with item decay if done properly.  It means a person is pregressing fast enough in a game that gear will not just dissappear as they walk along, but neither can it reside in their bank for 8 months until they sell it or give it to a twink of theirs.<br />
<br />
You quickly approach a point where, whether you like tradeskills or not, you can never escape them.   You hit a big nail right on the head here.  In EQ2 there is no escaping tradeskills, they now have a pure class dedicated to its very existance they have to have something for that class that is needed, I just have a sneaking suspicion that it has gone a bit far, more like a domination effect rather than a co-dependance.<br />
<br />
I used to do this fairly often myself. Just really the resist gear concept, except souped up. Think of it maybe like being able to get situational foci - use this one when you are dotting, this one when you are facing an AOE, etc.  Yes I remember having done Halls of Test and swapping out all my jewelry for resist gear, you know what after 3 raids I gave up doing it.  I'd rather die and loot my corpse than have to switch items in and out all day.  <br />
Even my melee characters, yes they carry a bag of weapons, 1 of each type.  But it is only used after levelling to get my skills maxxed then they go again.<br />
Switching armour would be annoying replacing damaged gear, and most likely more time consuming and laboursome.<br />
<br />
I agree that item decay is not a single all wonderful answer, it is one part of a many system, not only that it takes the greatest of balancing (Sony's favorite word) not only against the time it takes to decay, but ease of acquiring, amount of use, components needed to make/repair, other items around, cost involved repairing, ease of aquiring that money etc etc</div></div><hr />

I cannot see EQ II not being part of the All Access acct system.  I know that I will not Play it if it is not.   If it doesn't start out that way, after they see that many people do not migrate, they will probably move it. <br />
<br />
Some of the issues will be cost reduction to improve profit.  EQ II may end up being the &quot;Stormhammer&quot; of EQ with online GM's and scripted quests.   <br />
<br />
When EQ came out Sony projected a 5 year lifespand with it and then it dieing to EQ II.  With new MMOLRPG's being planned and the player dollars getting tigher, it may be a good market to keep the old EQ as the low end MMOLRPG just like they have kept Tartarus all of these years even after much better games have come out.   If they do that though, then expansions would become very rare and only minor fixes made to correct hacks and exploits.  <br />
<br />
Personnally I like some of the corrections they have made over the years just as I have hated the nerfs.  EQ II will be a crippled version of EQ with equipment deteriorazation, no Druid Class and limited zones.   The issue will be if you can repair gear you want to keep or if gear wears out before you can replace it with something better. <br />
<br />
If it is All Access, I will buy it and play it to see if they fixed questing. hunting and if it is enjoyable.  I will not just buy it because it is certified &quot;New and Improved&quot; by SoE.</div></div><hr />

Ways they leave:<br />

1.  People quit the game with their equipment still on their characters.<br />

3.  Server transfers delete the equipment on a transfer character<br />

<br />
I do understand how item decay can contribute to a virtual economy, but I agree with Oldoak -- some aspects of realism detract too much from a fantasy game's fun factor. <br />
<br />
In my opinion, any negative factor or drawback in a game must be offset by a benefit.  A timesink that serves no purpose other than to waste time is a showstopper, but a timesink that results in some tangible benefit is bearable even if the timesink itself isn't fun. <br />
<br />
We can look at a few examples in EQ. Players tolerated long boat rides because they provided a way to travel from one place to another, plus access to a few remote areas. Players tolerated the 'realistic' necessity of eating because that also serves as a mechanism for temporary boosts in character stats. <br />
<br />
However, folks would *not* tolerate the realistic necessity of sleep, because it would detract from the game's basic playability -- imagine having to stop doing anything for an hour so your character could rest. Similarly, players would *not* tolerate the realism of aging because varying length of session time would detrimentally separate friends and guildmates (&quot;Have you seen Sue lately?&quot; .. &quot;Oh, her character got old and died, so she's leveling up a new one. Hopefully she can rejoin us in a couple months.&quot;)<br />
<br />
Item decay, to me, seems too much like the latter examples. Part of your playing time is spent trying to keep what you have; as opposed to spending more of that time moving forward.<br />
<br />
There are too many other ways to build and stimulate a virtual economy without requiring players to waste time on a treadmill.<br />

<br />
No you can't.  Gear and platinum does not leave the game fast enough to simulate a healthy economy.  That's why consumables should be a huge portion of the game.  Items should decay.  I'm not saying you should end up with a new sword every week or even every month.  Or repair your armor once a day.<br />
<br />
Perhaps once a month you have to visit an armorer to have them repair a few pieces of your armor.  Or a tailor to repair a nasty rip in your gown.  Maybe you have to visit a weaponsmith to get your blade sharpened professionally.  Or get the hilt parts replaced due to wear and tear.<br />
<br />
Maybe if people treated EQ less like a game and more like a role playing game, item decay would make a helluva lot more sense.  Maybe if more people actually got into the role of their character instead of treating it like a virtual chat room with spells and swords and things to kill... the 'tediuos' and 'mundane' tasks wouldn't seem so ridiculous to them.</div></div><hr />

Yes, I knew that.  I said what they said originally, and was just trying to convey the mindset from which they seem to be approaching EQ2.  IE, more &quot;realism&quot; for realisms sake.<br />
<br />
I think that other MMORPG's that focus more on playability and fun will kick their ass for that reason.  Most players want immersiveness, yes, but are not looking to repeat in a game the minutiae of daily life they must deal with IRL.<br />
<br />
WOW will focus on playability...as will other RPG's on the way.  I think EQ2 is going to dig a hole for itself if they go too far down that realism road.  I don't see any compelling evidence that realism is what most people are looking for here...</div></div><hr />

<br />
In other words, what you want them to do is focus more on the tedious and mundane aspects of the game, instead of the fun.  <br />
<br />
Do you not get the idea that people want the fun parts of an RPG, not the mundane and tedious?<br />
<br />
The question with RPGs always is what is the level of abstraction present in the game.  How many stats are used to represent a character and his or her attributes?   How is combat resolved?   And so on.<br />
<br />
Some aspects of life are so mundane and tedious, they get abstracted right out of the game.  Potty breaks, sleeping, and the like.<br />
<br />
Some aspects of life are mundance and tedious, but may get included in some games at a highly abstracted level, or get turned into something interesting.   Eating and drinking, for example.   Or the passage of time.  <br />
<br />
Item maintenance is unquestionably mundane and tedious.  I will allow that it might fall into the second category in some way, but I have yet to see it implemented in a game where it enhances the fun of playing the game.   UO had maintenance requirements early on, but I note that several have been removed from the game, for example.<br />
<br />
It may be that the maintenance requirements are abstracted enough that they do not become onerous.   But then you have to ask why bother having it in the game at all.</div></div><hr />

Me too!  But again, if the benefit for switching gear is great enough, you will do it, and do it happily.  It can indeed be done that way.  <br />

I don't want to overdefend an off the cuff suggestion.  I originally presented simply to demonstrate there really are many cat-skinning techniques available, and that item deterioration is not &quot;the only answer.&quot;<br />
<br />
Item deterioration, as Scirocco said above, is at best irrelevant (ie, if you can repair items they don't actually leave the game and by giving money to other players you don't actually take anything out of the economy).  At worst, it is a gameplay nuissance factor that will turn off a lot of players (including me).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Yakk</div><div class="date">10-29-2003, 06:56 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">It is feasible... as long as products leave the game permanently. Platinum never really disappears in EverQuest... a +2 Wisdom Ring made four years ago by some novice enchanter is still around now. As good as new. Nothing ever decays. And that's bad.<br />
<br />
Why is it bad?<br />
<br />
Because platinum doesn't leave the game fast enough, we have people with 100's of thousands of platinum just sitting around. We have people with millions of platinum in the bank. It causes massive inflation. If items decayed and needed repairing, there'd be a great platinum sink. It'd also create another Demand in the market. The jewelcrafter that makes and sells a +6 Wisdom Ring isn't just competing with other jewelcrafters, but himself and every customer he sells a ring to, because once made, those rings never leave the game.<br />
<br />
Why is inflation bad?<br />
<br />
Item decay would do a world of good for EverQuest... but that would bring out every single damn one of the whiners and they won't do that... so they're putting it in EverQuest2. If something as mundane and petty as item decay is gonna keep you out of the game... good riddance.<br />
<br />
And why would it do a world of good?<br />
<br />
You place forward these unbased opinions as fact.<br />
<br />
I once thought that such methods where required to keep a somewhat healty economic system going -- but it isn't.<br />
<br />
All item repair requirements does, economically, is add an ingame cost over time for playing depending on the gear quality.  Which may or may not have benefitial social effects.<br />
<br />
Remember, game developers are defining a socio economic system.  The trick for them is to create motivations and rewards on scheduals that increase their customer base and keep it stable.<br />
<br />
You could argue that EQ2 should be aimed at a distinct segment of the possible customer base, because they really care about the sum of EQ1 and EQ2's revenue.  But, the problem is, that makes EQ2 far more dangerous a product.<br />
<br />
After we've got them all to 220+ though, I'll be back where I am. Not much worth spending the money on for myself or her, and with the recommended levels, not a whole lot worth twinking with.<br />
<br />
This is a money circulation problem.  There is nothing someone not in a handful of players can do for you, with the exception of tradeskill components.<br />
<br />
Do you have all the toys you can get?  Zomm necklace, instacast lev shield, and all those other rare clickies?<br />
<br />
Most of the problem you people have is your trying to shove your narrow minded EQ views onto EQ2, just because you expect them to be damn near the same game.<br />
<br />
No, because I like collecting stuff.  EQ contains a trading card game (gear), whose enjoyment would be damaged heavily by item decay.<br />
<br />
Which is the same reason why I hope gear collection is a part of EQ2.  Gear collection is a fun subgame of EQ.<br />
<br />
 1- Its by Sony. They have demonstrated a lack of concern for customers. Every once in a blue moon you get a gem of service, but on the whole they don't. Therefore, they don't need any more of my money.<br />
<br />
I don't give a shit how much Sony says &quot;I love you&quot; to their customer base.  As  yet, nobody has made a better product than them.  This deserves my money.<br />
<br />
If I want someone to bow and scrape to me, I'd be a numbnut.<br />
<br />
I'm sorry, but making gear No Drop does not fix the economy either. EQ's economy is completely fubar'd anyway.<br />
<br />
Proof by repitition.  You keep saying this, but don't generate any evidence.<br />
<br />
 That is why I don't really see a problem with item decay if done properly. It means a person is pregressing fast enough in a game that gear will not just dissappear as they walk along, but neither can it reside in their bank for 8 months until they sell it or give it to a twink of theirs.<br />
<br />
And, based off other such games, there is no way to get gear at a low level that you keep for 40 levels.<br />
<br />
 No you can't. Gear and platinum does not leave the game fast enough to simulate a healthy economy. That's why consumables should be a huge portion of the game. Items should decay. I'm not saying you should end up with a new sword every week or even every month. Or repair your armor once a day.<br />
<br />
Here you use the term &quot;healthy&quot;.  Define your terms.<br />
<br />
Maybe if people treated EQ less like a game and more like a role playing game, item decay would make a helluva lot more sense. <br />
<br />
Ya know, when I PnP RPG, we say &quot;we camp for the night, usual guard duty&quot;, and then the next day comes.<br />
<br />
The unfun parts are glossed over as best we can.<br />
<br />
Tedious and mundane tasks are abstracted out and it is ridiculous to require players to spend as much time roleplaying sleep or going to the washroom as they do the interesting parts of the game.<br />
<br />
The economy in EQ is heavily expansion and game-additions based, but it is a functioning economy.  Hell, its currency, even though it drops in value at a pretty constant rate, has a large underground exchange market with real life money.</div></div><hr />

I have had a FWG5 pistol augmented with kryte tissue (making it very rare) and sliced (another player augments yer weapons..ie enchants them).  Ive had this same pistol since basically beta ended and only now do I need to repair it, and once repaired it will be approx 95 perc as effective as before.<br />
<br />
Shield generators are a bit different and degrade very quickly.<br />
<br />
I don't want to see item decay in EQ1, but I think it will be an important part of the economy in EQ2 and people will grow acclimate quickly to it.  Moorgard has also stated that some items will not have decay rates period.<br />
<br />
Also; Legends, onepass subscribers are both sposed to have EQ2 included in their subscription, so i doubt that the cost for eq1+eq2 will be more then the cost of the onepass, so doing the math, probly under 16 dollars a month, which is one trip to the theatres if you go light on the munchies.</div></div><hr />

End result will be that if you get into a good raid guild, item decay is not part of EQ2 for you.  If you don't get the uber guild, you have a constant cash sink for maintaining your gear.<br />

Don't see how it can work any other way, since players will never tolerate suber uber rare drops getting destroyed through use.  &quot;Yah, I used to have a Leet BP of Super Uberness, but I failed in a repair and now I hope to get another one something in the next 20 months...&quot;<br />

Just not gonna happen ; ).<br />

I don't see any good coming of it, but while I am not anti SOE or anything, and am planning to buy it, I seriously doubt I will overcome how much I hate item deterioration.

With an item decay system in place drops would not need to be so rare, they can drop more often becuase these items will eventually be leaving the game.<br />
<br />
I think if an item decay system is in place there shouldn't be items which will not decay, that does set one group of players about from the other, becuase these non-decay items would most likely be the best of their type.<br />
<br />
Consumables would be another viable way to reduce the build up of resources in the game.  Things like potions, food/drink, charge items which dissapear or are rechargable.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Aly</div><div class="date">10-29-2003, 11:14 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">In other words, what you want them to do is focus more on the tedious and mundane aspects of the game, instead of the fun.<br />
<br />
No... I want people to focus on what really makes the game a role playing game.  Imagine if clerics had to spend an hour a month in service at their church... (goobers could just go afk during this hour) ... while roleplayers could have fun talking with fellow priests.  Those people who couldn't make the monthly service would be penalized say 10% of their mana or something until they performed a quest of atonement.  The people who do go to the service and participate (via chracter flags) could gain a 10% bonus to their mana for the next few hours or something.<br />
<br />
Lots of little things could be scripted in like that for various classes that make sense to be in game.  Something to make the game more in depth and dynamic.  I've written scripts for things like this in Neverwinter Nights.  They're required tasks with a consequence for not doing them.  Just like item repair.<br />
<br />
The trick is to balance the level of tedium with something fun or some benefit for doing it.   Perhaps warriors could spend an hour a month honing their skills on practice dummies.  That oculd be done at any time.  For each month they decline to practice, they lose 5 skill points temporarily.  Nothing huge, unless they totally neglect their characters duties.<br />
<br />
The warrior's guild could require some task, once a month, or the warrior can no longer train at that guildhall.  The task wouldn't be something major, but with instancing, it could be something as simple as a recovery adventure.<br />
<br />
Simple things like that would make the game so much fun.  It'd give the characters, not the players, a reason to do stuff in the world... aside from killing big nasties and farming phat lewts.  Simeple things like that would create a much more favorable atmosphere for everyone that draws people into the world of EverQuest and not just the game.<br />
<br />
I could come up with thousands of little quests like those above for each class and race.  Tons of little adventures here and there for all levels of play.  Perhaps even weaving a story, multiple stories into the adventures creating a storyline adept players could follow and enjoy. <br />
<br />
Wouldn't you find that more fun than sitting in ZoneA killing the same mobs over and over just to see the next level of mobs?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Nope... You would have to PAY me to play a game like that. I want to play the interesting parts of my characters life - the things that don't particularly resemble my own life. I don't want to spend my time 'playing' a job - I've already got one of those, and they even give me money for doing it.<br />
<br />
Your sugestion reminds me of a fake game once suggested in an old RPG magazine :<br />
&quot;Papers and Paychecks&quot; Roleplay a student or an office worker!!!<br />
<br />
If you were reading a fantasy novel and the author decided to spend every 3rd chapter describing the Warrior taking a break from whatever the mission/quest is to beat on a practice dummy, would you like it? Or would you start to wonder exactly what recreational pharmacuticals the author and editor were taking?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Aly</div><div class="date">10-30-2003, 03:56 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">What's so frelling interesting about sitting in the same spot day after day killing the same mobs over and over?  Damn... that sounds like a job to me.  My vision of the game would at least have you taking the role of your character seriously.<br />
<br />
It would add a lot of variety to the game.  Perhaps one evening you log on to help a cleric friend fulfill his quest of atonement and clear a crypt full of nasty undead creatures and return the unhallowed temple to it's rightful state.  This might take a couple hours.  Just like a LDoN adventure, but with some real purpose and story behind it that involves YOUR CHARACTER personally.<br />
<br />
My way would give each person a reason to gether friends other than to camp in the same spot or do the same dungeon over and over or kill the same raid mob over and over.<br />
<br />

<br />
*rolls her eyes* Lots of times in novels the characters take time out to work on their swordsmanship... reasearch something... etc.  What I would do is add these small tasks into the game and integrate them with an instanced dungeon system.  Give people a reason to really get into the role of their character without it being tedious.<br />
<br />
How hard would it be for you to log on for an hour and talk with your fellow clerics in a temple somewhere?  Are you that insocial? Perhaps the NPC's would change the rumors or quests they give once a month to coincide with in game events and the prayer time.<br />
<br />
It's not like I'd be requiring the priests to log on every day for so long and tithe a percentage of their income to the church.  Although tithing could be integrated as well to be beneficial to the overal quality of the game.<br />
<br />
EverQuest is treated like a chat room with 3d graphics and mobs to kill.  What I'd like to see for EQ2 is a great roleplaying game where people actually enjoy getting into the role of their character instead of logging on to grind out a level or an AA... or log on to camp some item.<br />
<br />
I never said once that I would require so much tedious work that it would be all the player would do.  I said the tedious work would lead to further adventures that immerse you into the game world providing a focus for the role you chose to play.<br />
<br />
But, people are morons and stupidity runs rampant.  The internet is a shining example of that and so I will continue to live in my little fantasy world of hope that someday a game like that might be created and the people won't be morons or stupid and they'll actually enjoy roleplaying.<br />
<br />
I guess I'm guilty of being a stupid moron too because I've almost given up on finding that kind of atmostphere in any role playing game online.<br />
<br />
And before anyone mentions, yes, I've looked for it in NWN as well... but to no avail.<br />
<br />
edit:  Y'know, the more I think about it... the more I realize just how amazing the potential could be for EverQuest 2 using the instancing technology and individual character flags.  I'd give a lung to work on the design and development team, but I have no offical credentials to prove I have any merit or worth of my ideas.  Guess I'll just have to stick to NWN and what I can produce with that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kulothar</div><div class="date">10-30-2003, 05:45 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">It is true that decay stimulates the economy but at what point doe decay become detrimental?   A simple solution would be slow decay but with the ability to repair and then put damaged goods on mobs as loot.  <br />
<br />
The current level recommended armor shows that they have the ability to give variable stats to items.    If a BP starts with AC25 and it has a decay level of 1 per play month then after one month it would be AC 25 (24).   Same with an item with Wis 8 and a decay of two months would be Wis 8 (7) after two months.  <br />
<br />
This would make the craftmen class much more important since if you are a warrior and didn't want to skill up in smithing, you would have to take it to a smith to repair back that lost AC.  Just as a Jeweler would have to repair jewerly and tailors leather.   It stimulates the economy by eating items evenually but eating platinum on a regular basis.   It also makes trade skills essential. <br />
<br />
On the other hand if a Tank got his smithing up to 100+ he could probably buy the materials and repair it himself thereby still eating up plat.  When he got a better BP he could sell his damaged one to someone that could still use it.    If you include the Recommended level on the armor then you don't need to make it No Drop any more. <br />
<br />
Example A Warrior gets a BP that is Recommended lv 45 and he is lv 40.   It has AC 40, Str 15, HP 20.   At lv 40 it is AC 40 (35), ST 15 (10), HP 20 (15).   It has a one month played decay so after a while drops to  AC 40 (34), ST15 (9), HP 20 (14) and can be repaired for one pt in each category by a smith.   If the AC drops below a certain persentage (say 10% of the total) it is destroyed.    He would be unable to sell it to a lv 16 or below since it would fall below that point and be destroyed which could easily trigger a warning msg.  Repair of points should become more difficult and expensive with higher level gear. <br />
<br />
There are lots of ways to stimulate trade and economy but I don't want my rare dragonhide tunic to just rot off of me in the middle of a battle.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">AmonraSet</div><div class="date">10-30-2003, 08:41 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Aly, you don’t seem to appreciate the differences in how an online MMORPG such as EQ works and how a pen and paper roleplaying game works.  For a pen and paper game, and quest of atonement for the cleric can be fun.  He can easily get his party members to join in on the quest because they are sitting right next to him in RL and lets face it, if they don’t go they probably won’t have anything to do for the next couple of hours (while the GM runs the quest of atonement for the cleric).<br />
<br />
Most of the time in a pen and paper game you are restricted to doing what the GM wants you to do.  Or if you want to do something else you the GM needs to be able to make something up on the spot, something the computer could never do properly.  Plus you are usually restricted to doing everything together since it’s not possible for the GM to run the game for 6 people doing different things all at once.<br />
<br />
An online game doesn’t have those restrictions.  People log on and off when they chose to rather than playing in a 6 hour session every Wednesday night.  In an online game, the cleric may log on and discover his friends aren’t logged on at the moment.  They’ve all gone to see a movie in RL or something.  Or they may have logged on a little earlier and already found something else to do.  So that cleric is kinda stuck.  Most strangers won’t help him out because after all there’s nothing in it for them and they don’t know him.<br />
<br />
It’s also not commercially possible to write quests which will be tailored to the individual characters and advance their personality/background or whatever when you are looking at 400,000 players.  You would inevitably end up doing the same quests as lots of other people and reading the spoilers on the web sites.  EQ has more content than any other game, but still every quest has been detailed and picked apart on various web sites.<br />
You may be able to think up thousands of quest ideas (although personally I doubt that) but it’s a different matter trying to then implement those quests – scripting the dialogue, making sure the mobs drop the appropriate items, doing the artwork and construction of an instanced zone, balancing the quest against all the other quests and finally playtesting the quest to make sure it is all working properly and that the server doesn’t collapse from the workload.  That’s a lot of time per quest and couldn’t possibly be profitable.<br />
<br />
Plus these quests can’t change the game world in any way and need to be repeatable by other people, something that isn’t required in a pen and paper game.  Cleansing all the undead in Unrest loses its roleplaying edge when you know they will respawn in 20 minutes time.<br />
<br />
As for the thought of being forced to sit in a church doing nothing for an hour every month or so…well I don’t quite know what to say.  I can think of few things that would be less enjoyable than this.  It would be as much fun as having to dig graves for all the people you just killed.  Or going to the toilet.  Or having to spend 1/3 of your time looking at a black screen when you sleep.  Or having to farm beetles and spiders and stuff to make poisons.  Er... wait, forget that last one.   :rolleyes:</div></div><hr />

There's a reason for that.   What you describe sounds like something few people would pay to play.   <br />
<br />
You sound like someone who likes a less abstract, more finely detailed RPG.  And many of the elements that you want to be less abstract are elements that many people do not find particularly fun.  I hope you understand why there does not appear to be a large commercial audience for such a game.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Hrm, online example.  Cleric logs on and realizes he forgot or didn't bother to attend his characters church services and now has a lost standing with his church.  That cleric than asks in guild chat or looks up his friends and forms a group to help him do the quest of atonement.<br />
<br />
Instead of going to one camp or another like LDoN for a quest, they're a lot more focused on your character bringing you into the storyline of the game.  The cleric would be like the group leader getting the adventure from the LDoN camps and taking his group on a quest.<br />
<br />
My way just adds some trappings to the game that make it more immersive. <br />
<br />
So that cleric is kinda stuck. Most strangers won’t help him out because after all there’s nothing in it for them and they don’t know him.<br />
<br />
Well... there's experience in it for the strangers... meeting new people... making new friends.  Perhaps the strangers would love to make a new cleric friend for rezzes later.  Or to get help on their own little quests should they ever need it.<br />
<br />
Pick up groups exist in EverQuest right now.  My ideas would just create reasons for those pick up groups other than experience grinding.  It'd create more immersion for everyone.<br />
<br />
 It’s also not commercially possible to write quests which will be tailored to the individual characters and advance their personality/background or whatever when you are looking at 400,000 players.<br />
<br />
I meant for each class, race, deity combination.  Not for each individual character based upon some written biograhpy somewhere.<br />
<br />
 You may be able to think up thousands of quest ideas (although personally I doubt that) but it’s a different matter trying to then implement those quests – scripting the dialogue, making sure the mobs drop the appropriate items, doing the artwork and construction of an instanced zone, balancing the quest against all the other quests and finally playtesting the quest to make sure it is all working properly and that the server doesn’t collapse from the workload. That’s a lot of time per quest and couldn’t possibly be profitable.<br />
<br />
Fine doubt me... but if given the chance I could.  I've been running P&amp;P games for well over a decade.  Much longer than a lot of you have been playing games.  And far longer than each one of you has been playing EverQuest.<br />
<br />
I never claimed to be a scripting guru.  Nor would I be the only one working on such a project.  You'd have people designing, people scripting, people modeling, people texturing, etc.  There are also lots of little ways to save time and make it easier.  Something they do already.  Re-use old models and textures.<br />
<br />
And why would the servers collapse from the workload?  It'd be simple enough to tailor the different times clerics would need to spend in services based upon what deity they follow.  That way the temple services zones instances would be staggered.  All the instanced zone stuff would be staggered as much as possible.  LDoN hasn't crashed any servers yet and I bet they've had quite a few instanced zones going at one time.<br />
<br />
 Plus these quests can’t change the game world in any way and need to be repeatable by other people, something that isn’t required in a pen and paper game. Cleansing all the undead in Unrest loses its roleplaying edge when you know they will respawn in 20 minutes time.<br />
<br />
Through character flags, instanced zones, and progressive quests, the cleric wouldn't have to clear the same dungeon over and over.  There wouldn't be respawning.  Again, people are trying to place their old accepted notions of EverQuest onto a new game.  It's not going to be the same game.<br />
<br />
 As for the thought of being forced to sit in a church doing nothing for an hour every month or so…well I don’t quite know what to say. I can think of few things that would be less enjoyable than this. It would be as much fun as having to dig graves for all the people you just killed. Or going to the toilet. Or having to spend 1/3 of your time looking at a black screen when you sleep. Or having to farm beetles and spiders and stuff to make poisons. Er... wait, forget that last one.<br />
<br />
That's why I'd make the service something fun and interesting.  It wouldn't have to be an hour of real time.  It could be an hour or two of game time.  Just long enough to give interested players some new lore, new rumors.  It would be easy enough to have a list of rumors and adventures that could be available for the next month that NPC clerics speak about at the service. THey'd issue proclamations for the next month and give news of what's been happening.  Maybe even the first cleric of that deity to complete the monthly quest gets their name spoken at the service.   Lots of litle things to make it worthwhile to spend that hour with your fellow clerics. <br />
<br />
Instanced zones could be the best thing that ever happened for online RPG's.  If I was in charge of project design for EQ2, I'd made sure the zones were easilly re-vampable without rebuilding almost everything from scratch.  That way it's just a matter of mob placement, names, loot, and some storyline information to change.  Drop and drag if possible.<br />
<br />
I hope you understand why there does not appear to be a large commercial audience for such a game.<br />
<br />
:bs: That's because no one is bold enough to take that gamble.  I bet it would pay off.  I don't believe you can sit there and say it wouldn't be fun to have more immersive quests in the game.  I don't believe you can sit there and say it wouldn't be fun gather friends or strangers to fulfill a quest of atonment; a quest of skill to prove your worth to the warrior guild; a quest of stealth and assassination for the rogue's guild... <br />
<br />
I could create a thousand little quests for various npc guilds, classes, etc.  And I guarentee they'd be fun.  They'd make you want to play your character instead of playing a loot whoring greedy cat herder.  EverQuest is just Diablo nowadays, except without the hackers.  I'm tired of those kinds of games and I'm positive many others are as well.<br />
<br />
So, anyone know a team of modelers, scripters, and investors looking for a designer? ^.^~</div></div><hr />

We (and every competitor since EQ shipped) have the advantage of being able to plan for the future. We know these games can exist and thrive for a long, long time, so we can design a multi-year plan for our game as to how we want the story and player advancement to progress.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Scirocco</div><div class="date">10-30-2003, 02:13 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">That's because no one is bold enough to take that gamble. I bet it would pay off. I don't believe you can sit there and say it wouldn't be fun to have more immersive quests in the game. <br />
<br />
<br />
You appear to be switching the cart and the horse.   My argument was simply that there is not a large commercial audience for a RPG that contains too much of the mundane and tedious.   The absence of that commercial demand is not the result of any company not being bold enough to take the gamble (in fact, I daresay that some companies have unintentionally taken that gamble through poor game design).   Instead, no one is bold enough to take that gamble knowingly because there is strong doubt that there is such a commercial demand.<br />
<br />
At least you recognize that it is a gamble, at this point.<br />
<br />
With regard to your second point, immersive quests can be good or bad, fun or not-fun.  Immersive &lt;&gt; Fun.  Nor does Immersive = Tedious &amp; Mundane.    You don't have to focus on tedious detail in order to have immersion and suspension of disbelief.<br />
<br />
Take, for example, your proposed quest of atonement.  If the atonement consists of spending an hour talking to people in the church, or offering prayers to your diety for a comparable length of time, or (to stay on topic) spending an hour repairing your armor and weapons, that's tedious and mundane and NOT fun.   If the atonement consists of going out and killing a roving band of monsters threatening the area, however, then it could be fun.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
I could create a thousand little quests for various npc guilds, classes, etc. And I guarentee they'd be fun. They'd make you want to play your character instead of playing a loot whoring greedy cat herder.  <br />
<br />
Needless to say, given your descriptions of what you find to be fun, and your lack of comprehension of what many other people DO find to be fun, I cannot accept your guaranty.</div></div><hr />

Damn... that sounds like a job to me. My vision of the game would at least have you taking the role of your character seriously.<br />
<br />
Strange, I try to avoid camping the same area too much, because it gets boring.<br />
<br />
I dunno about you, but lets see where you can XP at L 65 and get a decent bang-for-your buck in terms of gear/xp:<br />
Tactics<br />
HoH<br />
PoV (desert, cave, undead)<br />
PoN mephit caves<br />
LDoN adventures (4 flavours, I always vote for 'take the first one', and each theme does have a different feel to it (types of rooms/packing/mob types)).<br />
LDoN adventures on Hard (which are a very different beast)<br />
BoT<br />
PoS wasps<br />
PoS giants<br />
Seb (hey, wanna go duo juggies/fungi king?)<br />
CT<br />
Farming various quest areas (everything from Ssra to WW)<br />
Hate<br />
Chardok (I still have aquantances who don't have a random epic)<br />
ChardokB (sell the FT 2 necklace, or keep it, or give it away)<br />
Droga (MQ the FT 2 necklace, or keep it)<br />
Play an alt<br />
Play a twinked alt<br />
Tradeskills<br />
<br />
And I probably missed places/activities that I actually spend time doing/being at in game.<br />
<br />
And you know, all of the above are goal-directed activities.<br />
<br />
It would add a lot of variety to the game. Perhaps one evening you log on to help a cleric friend fulfill his quest of atonement and clear a crypt full of nasty undead creatures and return the unhallowed temple to it's rightful state. This might take a couple hours. Just like a LDoN adventure, but with some real purpose and story behind it that involves YOUR CHARACTER personally.<br />
<br />
Sure.  Give every character a level/class/deity/race-dependant quest once per month (or once per week) that takes a group 2 hours to finish, with a roleplaying justification, and a maybe even a choice or two within it that impacts your faction with various EQ institutions.<br />
<br />
 Pick up groups exist in EverQuest right now. My ideas would just create reasons for those pick up groups other than experience grinding. It'd create more immersion for everyone.<br />
<br />
Pick up groups exist because everyone gets roughly equal benefit from the group.<br />
<br />
Remove that (ie, make it so one person gainst more than their fair share of benefit), and you now have a psychoeconomically (newword!) unstable situation.<br />
<br />
 Through character flags, instanced zones, and progressive quests, the cleric wouldn't have to clear the same dungeon over and over. There wouldn't be respawning. Again, people are trying to place their old accepted notions of EverQuest onto a new game. It's not going to be the same game.<br />
<br />
But, LDoN doesn't change the game world.<br />
<br />
I guess you could have multiple instances of planes that change based on your current flag status in PoP, but wouldn't that make it hell to play with your friends?<br />
<br />
Instanced zones could be the best thing that ever happened for online RPG's. If I was in charge of project design for EQ2, I'd made sure the zones were easilly re-vampable without rebuilding almost everything from scratch. That way it's just a matter of mob placement, names, loot, and some storyline information to change. Drop and drag if possible.<br />
<br />
*sigh*, yes it would be lovely if designing zone geometry and pathing was easy.<br />
<br />
Unfortunetally, nobody has figured how to make it easy without cookie cutter zones.  Even LDoN has alot of cookie-cutter issues.<br />
<br />
 Take, for example, your proposed quest of atonement. If the atonement consists of spending an hour talking to people in the church, or offering prayers to your diety for a comparable length of time, or (to stay on topic) spending an hour repairing your armor and weapons, that's tedious and mundane and NOT fun. If the atonement consists of going out and killing a roving band of monsters threatening the area, however, then it could be fun.<br />
<br />
See &quot;a tale in the desert&quot;, where they have built an entire subgame out of complex prayers to computer generated dieties.  No, really.<br />
<br />
But, that game is a niche game.  For a reason.  I like the fact it exists, it has some really neat game features, but it probably won't have massive commercial success.</div></div><hr />

Give people a reason to really get into the role of their character without it being tedious.<br />
<br />
That isn't what I said... I said<br />
If you were reading a fantasy novel and the author decided to spend every 3rd chapter describing the Warrior taking a break from whatever the mission/quest is to beat on a practice dummy, would you like it?<br />
<br />
And I know you saw it because you quoted it...<br />
<br />
What you actually find in a novel :<br />
<br />
Somewhere in chapter 13 (or whatever number) there is a brief mention of Simple Mundane Task X that needs to be completed. One or Two pages later it is done. That is it. That mundane task does not show up again (exception : David Eddings makes far to big a deal all over the damn place about cooking the meals).<br />
<br />
What I said would work like this:<br />
Chapter 1 : Introduce People<br />
Chapter 2 : Get the Quest Rolling Along<br />
Chapter 3 : Bob the Warrior decides it is time to beat on practice dummy. Lets spend 15 pages describing how he scrounged up the dummy, every single swing of his sword and how much his muscles ache.<br />
Chapter 4 : Some of the Quest<br />
Chapter 5 : Some more of the Quest<br />
Chapter 6 : Bob the Warrior decides it is time to beat on practice dummy - again. Lets spend 12 pages describing how he remembered to bring the dummy he found back in chapter 3, every single swing of his sword and how much his muscles ache.<br />
Chapter 7 : Some of the Quest<br />
Chapter 8 : Some more of the Quest<br />
etc...</div></div><hr />

Those books are all about the main characters doing mundane things.  There's almost 10 books worth!  And they're great stories.<br />
<br />
There's one that starts off with the boy working in a sawmill... then apprenticing as a scrivener... and then becoming a junior mage, but still being tasked with mundane jobs.  Most of those books are about real people in a fantasy world.  It makes the world more real to read about them doing mundane work compared to high fantasy all the time, 24/7.<br />
<br />
Yakk:  Again, you're trying to put this into EQ terms and not EQ2 possibilities.  The planes won't exist.  Variant instances are for flavor and variety.... not for alternate storylines within the same game.  SWG is doing a good job where they take the results of their monthly story arc quests and tabulate them and continue the story using those results to guide the following acts.<br />
<br />
That same thing could be done in EQ2.  As for the prayer system, it wouldn't be that complex.  I'll come back and edit this post once I finish typing up the post I promised Scirocco detailing a couple examples of what I would love to see in a MMORPG.<br />

<br />
EQ wouldn't have survived if VI had decided to enforce roleplaying; instead, it became a relatively small niche in the overall community, which you can easily see by comparing how many 'roleplay' servers the game required to satisfy that subset.  <br />
<br />
You keep forgetting some of the stuff that makes true RPGs popular and their 'realism'-based aspects bearable. Just a few among the many reasons:<br />
- Real people run the encounters, not automated code-driven mobs with predetermined actions. This allows roleplaying to be personally enforced and appropriately rewarded.<br />
- The whole world stops when the DM/players decide it does. They can take a break from the world and pick up where they left off; the world doesn't continue without them 24/7, therefore their actual gaming time is not devalued relative to players who didn't take a break.<br />
- The more appealing a game is to the general population (a goal of VI/Sony), the more its RP segment is lost in the majority of those who don't care one bit for roleplaying.<br />
<br />
My vision of the game would at least have you taking the role of your character seriously. <br />
<br />
You just answered your own question. People aren't going to take their characters any more seriously than they're willing to take any game. The purpose of entertainment, be it a game, or a movie, or a book, or whatever, is to provide an escape from tedium of everday real life.<br />
<br />
Only a microscopic portion of society has such mundane lives that their idea of fantastic escape would be balancing a checkbook or sitting in classs ... which is exactly the level of tedium you're ascribing in this proposed 'vision'. If you can't see how terribly unappealing that tedium would be to most players, nothing we can say will convince you that folks are not looking for a game that forces one more hour of busywork after they've already had 8-12 hours of it.<br />
<br />
If you want item decay so badly, log onto a few of your EQ characters and delete some of their items. Then write a narritave about how the items began deteriorating some time ago and your attempts to repair them failed. Read that to yourself until you're properly motivated. Then enjoy repeating all the quests and raids needed to replace those items. And when you finish, and realize that you spent all that time just to get your character back to where it was a few months ago, come tell us how well-received you think this concept will be by the average gamer. :)<br />

<br />
It just sounds...boring. Very boring.<br />
<br />
That's because you only got the half-assed short version.  I've made a larger post in the General forum that details my ideas much better than what I wrote in this post:<br />
<br />
http://forums.thedruidsgrove.org/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=5485<br />
<br />
I guarentee it wouldn't be boring.  It wouldn't be tedious.  Would you really consider it that boring to do one required quest a month or every two months?  It's not like I'm saying that you have to log on every day precisely at 5:03 pm EST and stay in your temple until 6:03 pm EST.  It's a simple thing to help educate people about the lore in the game and create a venue for new lore and events that draw people into the immersiveness of the game.<br />
<br />
I am 100% positive it would not be boring.  I'd bet every single bit of money I have.  I'd bet my computer that a majority of people would enjoy a class/deity/guild based quest system using instanced zones technology.<br />
<br />
It's a simple, fun to do task that's required once a month or every two months and you get a small benefit for taking part in the immersion of the game.<br />
<br />
As for item decay... that is necessary to create a healthy economy in the game.  And again, it's not like your armor or sword would just break in the middle of fight... unless you were neglecting to repair them.  To keep item decay from being a nuisance, it would have varying rates of decay based upon how powerful the item is and what level the charater is that is using it.  Actually, I think I read something along those very lines already in the works for EQ2.  Twinking a low level alt with a powerful weapon increases the chance of it breaking.<br />
<br />
Without item decay... gear just does not leave the game fast enough.  Regardless of people quitting or destroying old gear or tossing it into the bank.  It's still there and useable.  And that is bad for any economy.  How profitable would GM or Ford be if their cars lasted forever?  Why would you ever buy another car if the one you have was going to last you forever and you'd never have to do any maintenance for it?  Why would those companies still exist today?<br />
<br />
They exist because there is a demand for new products because old products wear out and become useless.  Keeping weapons and armor in top shape could be as simple as going to a PC or NPC armorsmith/tailor/weaponsmith/etc. and paying them a small sum of money to fix your gear.  Maybe for an average player with average gear, it would take six to eight months for the gear to finally wear out even after repairs.<br />
<br />
You're making everything sound like it's going to be a daily chore to do or else you'll lose all your gear.  SoE would be morons to put that kind of ridiculous item decay in.<br />
<br />
Real people run the encounters, not automated code-driven mobs with predetermined actions. This allows roleplaying to be personally enforced and appropriately rewarded.<br />
<br />
Roleplaying during the quests, adventures, etc. would not be forced.  It would be encouraged via key phrases needing to be spoken by the druid and their groupmates.  Encouraging them to play in character.  They wouldn't have to roleplay beyond that at all.<br />
<br />
Shall I write out a sample quest complete with NPC dialogues and PC responses to show what I mean?<br />
<br />
The whole world stops when the DM/players decide it does. They can take a break from the world and pick up where they left off; the world doesn't continue without them 24/7, therefore their actual gaming time is not devalued relative to players who didn't take a break.<br />
<br />
I thought about that and players that are going to be gone for an extended time could speak to a certain NPC important to their race/guild/class and gain a character flag that says they're going to take a Leave of Absence and not be subjected to the penalties for neglecting their duties.  That character flag however, goes away the next time they log on.<br />
<br />
That way they can pick up where they left off... however, depending on how long they were gone... they will have missed some quests that won't be around again and have to dig up past lore about what's happened while they were away, if they want to keep up with the storyline.<br />
<br />
The more appealing a game is to the general population (a goal of VI/Sony), the more its RP segment is lost in the majority of those who don't care one bit for roleplaying.<br />
<br />
Again, my ideas would encourage roleplaying, but it wouldn't force everyone to roleplay the entire time they're playing the game.  I think a lot of people just don't really understand how to roleplay and are intimidated by it.<br />
<br />
 Only a microscopic portion of society has such mundane lives that their idea of fantastic escape would be balancing a checkbook or sitting in classs ... which is exactly the level of tedium you're ascribing in this proposed 'vision'. If you can't see how terribly unappealing that tedium would be to most players, nothing we can say will convince you that folks are not looking for a game that forces one more hour of busywork after they've already had 8-12 hours of it.<br />
<br />
You didn't read my other post at all... did you... it's not just 'busy work'.  It's an adventure that helps draw them into the game.  If you're not going to read and comprehend what I posted, then don't bother to post at all.<br />
<br />
And the fact that you call playing a game, 'busy work', i.e. grinding or raiding or tradeskilling... is a problem with the game design.  I think my ideas for the game would take out a lot of the boring aspects of grinding.<br />
<br />
 If you want item decay so badly, log onto a few of your EQ characters and delete some of their items. Then write a narritave about how the items began deteriorating some time ago and your attempts to repair them failed. Read that to yourself until you're properly motivated.

<br />
I don't want item decay for EQ.  The current way loot is handled would make item decay unbearable.  I have no argument against that.  *sighs*  Again you're missing the point.  LOOT IN EQ2 WILL NOT BE LIKE LOOT IN EQ.  Got it now?  Get rid of all your misconceptions about how EQ2 will be.  Stop trying to make it sound like it's going to be exactly like EQ.  Because it's not.  They've said this before on their message boards.  And common sense says, if items decay... they're not gonna be as hard to replace as items are in EQ.<br />

Just don't ask people to go stand in a church for an hour though, *THAT* would not be enjoyable to the most. <br />
When the time comes, you get a message asking you to do the quest or speak to npc_01 to start it. Fail to complete the quest before the next quest, and your faction goes down. Complete the quest and get a small reward and increased faction with your temple.<br />

Gee... finding pick-up groups shouldn't even be a problem... with the lfg tool technology, I'm sure people could be able to put requests for groups on a dynamic board (ie &quot;looking for 5-6 people to help me cleanse the evil temple&quot;), thus replacing the LDON adventure recruiters.<br />
<br />
I can't see how anyone could find the idea of a new personnal quest every now and then boring or tedious... sheesh it sometimes seems that most EQ players are so used to the &quot;sit there, wait for mob, kill mob, rinse repeat&quot; routine that they actually forgot that all changes are not necessarily for the worst...<br />

I still find it increasing difficult to find a group with LDoN, it literally takes longer than it does to do the dungeon most days.  I've sort of given up on dungeons and go do my own thing now.  I'll most certainly go to a dungeon given an invite, but I will no longer sit around for 2 hours making a group.<br />

Firemynd, you are still thinking in terms of EQ1.  A game balanced correctly would not need the timesinks that EQ1 has.  EQ1 has camps becuase Sony want to control how fast items enter the game.  With item decay and proper balancing items can enter faster.  Also on the note of repairing items, the game should do it in either 1 of 2 ways, you can repair and it is 100% successful each time (but this would most likely turn it into a mundane task), or items can not be repaired at all.  This would then remove the mundane task of repair, and would mean players are continually on the lookout for newer and better equipment.</div></div><hr />

Hi Moorgard..  what a lurker to have around.   <br />
<br />
You are correct,  the 5 yr prediction was a community dicussion  one based on technology and internet access to broadbank.   Not a Verant press release (and there are no records I can find that old). <br />
<br />
McQuaids comment about 5 - 10 years until the industry boomed due to widspread broadband access was prefaced by his comments on EQ being modular and growing.   <br />
<br />
May of us that were discussing it from Beta 3 were expecting the industry to grow faster and newer and better things to come out about the 5 year mark....  Well, EQ II is coming out about that time and splitting the market doesnt make good economic sence. .    <br />
<br />
but I stand corrected... sorry to spread rumors.</div></div><hr />

Why would you ever buy another car if the one you have was going to last you forever and you'd never have to do any maintenance for it? Why would those companies still exist today? <br />
<br />
You're acting as every consumer drives the same car until it's completely worn out and useless, and seem to be in denial that there's a pretty large 'used car' market for everything from last year's model to classic models 15+ years old.  Take a quick drive on the highway and count the number of worn and rusted vehicles, then count the number of newer models not even two years old.<br />
<br />
Sure, the average person spends time and money maintaining their vehicles, but it's not like our whole economy would collapse if we didn't need to change the oil and replace worn parts every once in a while.<br />
<br />
If cars 'lasted forever', car manufacturers would be in the same shape they are in right now -- designing new models every year and selling them successfully to the millions of people who buy a new car long before their current one shows signs of wear and tear.<br />
<br />
You're making everything sound like it's going to be a daily chore to do or else you'll lose all your gear. SoE would be morons to put that kind of ridiculous item decay in. <br />
<br />
With twenty equipment slots to worry about, item repair would indeed be a daily concern. Which pieces are about to wear out? Which ones will need repairing soon? How much money do I need to save just to keep using all my gear if I'm not sure when I'll be able to afford upgrades?<br />
<br />
The vast majority of players do not wish to bother with any of that. They want to log on and be able to enjoy their gaming session without worrying that their planned activities may be postponed or impeded because of having to spend time fixing or replacing any gear to maintain their usual level of performance.<br />
<br />
Roleplaying during the quests, adventures, etc. would not be forced. It would be encouraged via key phrases needing to be spoken by the druid and their groupmates.  <br />
<br />
As was rightfully pointed out to me in another thread a few months ago, following quest scripts can be challenging enough for players whose primary language isn't English; nearly impossible sometimes to figure out key phrases to use. Once again, you're forgetting that Sony's goal is for its games to appeal (and retain playability) to the widest audience possible for the game's genre.<br />
<br />
I thought about that and players that are going to be gone for an extended time could speak to a certain NPC important to their race/guild/class and gain a character flag that says they're going to take a Leave of Absence and not be subjected to the penalties for neglecting their duties. That character flag however, goes away the next time they log on. <br />
<br />
Why would I play your game, when there are other games hitting the market which do not penalize players for the length of time they're willing to engage in a certain activity? Most people in EQ don't even visit their guildmaster NPCs when doing so is rewarded with increases in skill; it's hard to believe they'd be happy about obligatory visits to avoid penalty.<br />
<br />
That way they can pick up where they left off... however, depending on how long they were gone... they will have missed some quests that won't be around again and have to dig up past lore about what's happened while they were away, if they want to keep up with the storyline. <br />
<br />
Nothing wrong with that. Allowing players to choose whether they want to complete tasks or pursue a storyline is a good thing. Penalizing them for not doing so would be a bad thing.<br />
<br />
I think a lot of people just don't really understand how to roleplay and are intimidated by it. <br />
<br />
Perhaps that applies to some, but I think the majority knows what roleplaying is; they just don't derive enough fun from it to spend time doing it.<br />
<br />
You didn't read my other post at all... did you... it's not just 'busy work'. It's an adventure that helps draw them into the game. If you're not going to read and comprehend what I posted, then don't bother to post at all. <br />
<br />
I read your other post, I just don't agree with it. If you aren't going to accept that some people will disagree with your ideas and aren't emotionally equipped to see your ideas rejected, then perhaps you should take your own advice and not post.<br />
<br />
Stop trying to make it sound like it's going to be exactly like EQ. <br />
<br />
I'm not trying to make it sound like anything; I simply do not agree that item decay is good for any MMORPG, and don't think that a game which includes item decay will have nearly the appeal EQ1 has had. You're taking this personally and defending the item decay concept as if you had a vested interest in its acceptance. <br />

Then write a narritave about how the items began deteriorating some time ago and your attempts to repair them failed. Read that to yourself until you're properly motivated. Then enjoy repeating all the quests and raids needed to replace those items. And when you finish, and realize that you spent all that time just to get your character back to where it was a few months ago, come tell us how well-received you think this concept will be by the average gamer.   Actually what I find more annoying is in EQ logging in and not being able to play becuase finding people to play with is not easy.  Groups don't form well, well at least in my experience, even forming my own groups can literally take hours.  I'll easily go for a game with 10 minute item repairs if groups can be found or formed in that time.</div></div><hr />

<br />
That quote there proves to me you have no idea what you're talking about.  If you have the best car available and it's going to last forever without need for any repairs or maintenance... and is never going to get any wear and tear... why would you buy a new car, other than for cosmetic reasons?<br />
<br />
In EQ, once you have the best gear you can possibly get, why would you bother raiding those same mobs any more?  Your gear is never going to wear out.  There's really no reason to play the game anymore.<br />
<br />
You keep trying to force your narrow minded views of loot in EQ onto item decay in EQ2.  I took the time to go read all of Moorgards posts and I learned a helluva lot in a short amount of time.  I guess you're too busy farming your phat lewts to take any interest in educating yourself about item decay in EQ2.<br />
<br />
In SWG I have 4 pistols, 2 full sets of armor (2 bracers, 2 arms, leggings, chest, gloves, helm, boots), two backpacks, and my Imperial Officer's uniform(3 pieces).    That's almost 30 pieces of gear that I have to worry about item decay on.  Guess what... it is NOT a daily task.  <br />
<br />
I've only had to replace one weapon and a set of cheap bone armor once so far in almost four months of play.  The only reason I replaced the bone armor, was because I was upgrading to something new.  My armor was still around 500 out of 900 condition.  The pistol was down to 400 out of 900 condition.<br />
<br />
My stormtrooper armor that I spent five days grinding faction for has 45,000 points of condition.  Somehow I doubt that replacing that armor is going to be a daily concern.  Again, SoE would be fools to put the kind of item decay in that you're insinuating.<br />
<br />
The used car market is like people handing their old, used up and beat up gear down to newer players.  They get some more use out of it and hopefully find an upgrade before it finally breaks and crumbles to dust.  Maybe the artisan class will be able to repair the armor or weapon to be useable again for a short amount of time.<br />
<br />
Grouping in EQ2 seems like it's going to be a lot easier than in EQ.  Again you people are complaing about something not even out yet.  There are like five base class archetypes.  And each one branches out to more specialized classes, but each specialized class can still fulfill the duties of the base archetype.<br />
<br />
Fighters for example.  They're the tanks and it branches out to paladin, shadowknight, and others.  I don't know the full class tree yet.  They haven't posted it yet.  The point is, in EQ2, you really just need one of each archetype to make a successful group.  No more we have to absolutely have a certain class to succeed.<br />
<br />
Also, since people are going to spend time at the two major cities, they're going to be an increased population around those cities making groups easier to find.  All this stuff you can find in Moorgards index of posts linked earlier in this thread.<br />
<br />
You people are making a mountain out of a molehill.<br />
<br />
 As was rightfully pointed out to me in another thread a few months ago, following quest scripts can be challenging enough for players whose primary language isn't English; nearly impossible sometimes to figure out key phrases to use. Once again, you're forgetting that Sony's goal is for its games to appeal (and retain playability) to the widest audience possible for the game's genre.<br />
<br />
That's what the [ ] are for.  Maybe in EQ2 key words will be [ ]'d and even highlighted.  I don't know.  If people have trouble with the game because it's in English, they should get better English skills.  I wouldn't expect a company in Russia to make their game easier for me just because I can't read their language as well as my own.  Especially if the game was made for their people.<br />
<br />
I'd work on remembering my rusty and ancient Russian language skills.  About the only thing I remember though is 3gpabcmbyume. <br />
<br />
 Why would I play your game, when there are other games hitting the market which do not penalize players for the length of time they're willing to engage in a certain activity? Most people in EQ don't even visit their guildmaster NPCs when doing so is rewarded with increases in skill; it's hard to believe they'd be happy about obligatory visits to avoid penalty.<br />
<br />
Because they get a bonus if they do it.  It's obvious from previous examples in EQ, that people are pretty willing to go to almost any length just for a small upgrade.  One required quest a month or even every two months isn't that big of a deal.  Forget I ever mentioned the hour in a temple.<br />
<br />
 Nothing wrong with that. Allowing players to choose whether they want to complete tasks or pursue a storyline is a good thing. Penalizing them for not doing so would be a bad thing.<br />
<br />
No it's not.  It's a good thing.  The benefit provided from doing the task plus the penalty if you don't do it motivates people.  Again, people will do some stupid, tedious, and boring crap just for a small gain.  My way would at least bring some fun and immersion into it.<br />
<br />
 Perhaps that applies to some, but I think the majority knows what roleplaying is; they just don't derive enough fun from it to spend time doing it.<br />
<br />
Probably because they're too busy worrying about whether they should get uber_bp01 or uber_bp02 to even care to learn what roleplaying really is.  <br />
<br />
 I'm not trying to make it sound like anything; I simply do not agree that item decay is good for any MMORPG, and don't think that a game which includes item decay will have nearly the appeal EQ1 has had. You're taking this personally and defending the item decay concept as if you had a vested interest in its acceptance. <br />
<br />
Well someone has to speak up for item decay.  Someone has to speak up for roleplaying.  I'm tired of being part of the silent majority that just accepts whatever is thrown at them.  I'm tired of piss poor games.<br />
<br />
Item decay; required quests; immersion through storyline quests that everyone can do, not just the goober guilds; an emphasis on roleplaying; those are the things I think would make for a fun game.  Instead of focusing on a virtual pissing contest (uber loot vs all other loot), people can focus more on having fun in the game all the time instead of grinding for hours and than having a small bit of fun when they get that uber loot.  They can feel like they're a part of the game and feel like they're making a difference when they fulfill their duties to their guild.<br />
<br />
I read through Moorgards indexed posts and EQ2 is looking to be pretty close to what I want.  My only disappointment is that once again there's going to be the hardcore raiders and everyone else. *sighs*  At least they're focusing on raids of only four groups.  I just hope they learned from EQ's horrid mistakes and make it so raid content is available to everyone and not just people that have tons of free time.<br />
<br />
Time will tell, but from how it's looking right now... most of the loot whores would be best off staying in EQ.</div></div><hr />

Hmmm...you seem to be out of touch with some of the basic factors that drive consumer purchases.  Which is not surprising by your arguments above.  <br />
<br />
The simple answer to &quot;why buy a new car&quot; is simply that: to buy a new car.  To change the one you already have.   To get something better.  To get something different.<br />
<br />
In the world of EQ, this is what drives consumers (players) to get new equipment.  They don't get new equipment because it wears out, they get it because the new equipment is better or different in some way.</div></div><hr />

<br />
If they are silent, you don't know what they think.  It is presumptious to think you do.  It is presumptious to assume that everyone wants what you want.<br />
<br />
My theory on ALL RPG's, online or off, is that if they deny players the freedom to play the game in the style they like - whether that means roleplay or non-roleplay - they are cutting off some segment of the market.  That is just bad business.  Never say &quot;no.&quot;  Always be carrot, not stick.  Build a game that attracts people who want a specific playstyle.<br />
<br />
The fundamental flaw in all your recommendations is that they try to enforce role play as a normative for game play.  That is an egregious error in design.  Were you to suggest creating rewards for role play elements it is one thing (though I still don't think it is a good idea, I could at least stomach it).<br />
<br />
Saying that role play should be dictated is foolish, and no business is likely to do it.<br />
<br />
This is not art.  This is not a social movement.  This is not a cult.  This is a business, and an entertainment business.  <br />
<br />
I do think over the next 10 years the MMORPG market will evolve into a wider assortment of choices that appeal more deeply to specific segments of the gaming community.  That there will be a gradual movement away from EQ's &quot;all things to all people&quot; approach.  But I don't expect EQ2 to be one of those games.  EQ2 is going to be same game, different name in terms of design strategy.  <br />
<br />
It will be underdog companies trying to get a cut of the business that might design a game that they never envision having more than 50,000 players that will experiment in the way you suggest.  <br />
<br />
And no matter how those games slice a segment, I don't think ANY of them will or should take a normative, &quot;you should play this way&quot; approach.  They will attract different audiences by the depth of development in certain areas.  This one great for tradeskills, that one great for quests, maybe even that one great for roleplay, and that one for PVP.  <br />
<br />
But no company that hopes to survive should ever approach a potential customer from the premise of &quot;you should do things this way, and if you don't enjoy it there is something wrong with you.&quot; <br />
<br />
That is more or less your mindset.  And no, I don't think EQ2 will work the way you want it to.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The quote you cited isn't my opinion, it's the real world. Not sure how you've managed to miss such fundamental principles.<br />
<br />
Plain and simple: consumers do not wait for their old car to become useless before they purchase another. <br />
<br />
Whatever your feelings of item decay in a game environment, it absolutely has no bearing on what drives consumers in the real world's economy. You are confusing two very different things - consumables (e.g. food and fuel) and products (cars, clothing, boats, houses).<br />
<br />
The benefit provided from doing the task plus the penalty if you don't do it motivates people. <br />
<br />
Fact: punishment is the least effective method of behavioral motivation. Of course, I suppose you'll deny that the same as you deny other principles commonly accepted in their respective RL authoritative publications and research studies. /shrug<br />
<br />
It's one thing to have a different opinion about what details are important in a game environment, but quite another to impose one's virtual ideals over the way things work in the real world. You keep trying to push examples from SWG, another game, as supporting proof for your notions about what stimulates a real economy. That's not going to convince many people of your viewpoint, especially if they don't play SWG and can't relate to the reference. <br />
<br />
I guess you're too busy farming your phat lewts to take any interest in educating yourself about item decay in EQ2. <br />

If namecalling and wild presumptions reflect the level of maturity with which you intend to debate issues and ideas, we may as well stop this now before you get yourself banned.<br />

EQ2 will use a phase choice system, such that the NPC will say something to you and you choose a response from a list of answers.  Sort of helps get around the language problem, since the game will be converted into muliple languanges and they control what you say to NPC's.  Also makes quest's easier for those who don't know what to say but does remove some of the mystisism of role-playing and figuring the phrases out for yourself.</div></div><hr />

I know quite a few people that put a lot of work and maintenance into their cars just to keep them running longer.  I'm doing it myself since I can't afford a brand spanking new car every year.<br />
<br />
Changing the oil every 3,000 miles.  Rotating and balancing tires.  Changing the tires.  Adding other fluids and such to keep it running smooth.  Those are all methods to prevent in EQ2 terms, item decay.  Preventitive maintenance.  Repairs.  Sounds quite familiar to me... sounds like item decay and repair is realistic and makes sense as part of an in game economy.  As long as it is not a major burden on the players.<br />
<br />
Life acxiom - anyone who claims to speak for a silent majority, never is doing so.<br />
<br />
If they are silent, you don't know what they think. It is presumptious to think you do. It is presumptious to assume that everyone wants what you want.<br />
<br />
No where did I claim to speak for the silent majority.  I just said I was tired of being part of it.  So now I'm speaking out in favor of more immersion and roleplaying in what is supposed to be a roleplaying game.  Now I'm a vocal minority that doesn't want to be associated with the silent majority anymore.  I'm tired of just accepting whatever is given to me.<br />
<br />
Look at all the greedy uber guilds that whine and moan because something was made easier for other people... or something is too hard for them.  Look at all the monks moaning about how they were nerfed.  I play a monk too and I do just as well as I used to before the nerf.  Far too many roleplayers seem to have thrown in the towel and I'm tired of it.  Like I said, someone has to speak up for roleplaying and immersion.<br />
<br />
Never say &quot;no.&quot; Always be carrot, not stick. Build a game that attracts people who want a specific playstyle.<br />
<br />
My ideas are a carrot.  You do this one quest... that takes no longer than a typical LDoN adventure... once every month or two months... and you get a bonus.  Failure to do so inflicts a minor penalty that is just an inconvienance.  If a single quest is just too much of an inconvienance for you to do... after all the work spent on creating those quests and the storyline behind them... you deserve that inconvienance.<br />
<br />
Again, it's not like I'm sticking a gun to your head telling you to sit at this spot and do nothing in that temple for two real hours.  It's a simple, fun, storyline driven quest that immerses you into the world.<br />
<br />
Saying that role play should be dictated is foolish, and no business is likely to do it.<br />
<br />
Roleplaying wouldn't be forced onto people, just encouraged through NPC guilds, factions, class/religion based duties, etc.  You wouldn't have to talk in character all the time, but NPC's and the quests themselves would encourage people to really think about their characters role in the game world and perhaps maybe they'd find some interest in roleplaying a little bit more.<br />
<br />
 If namecalling and wild presumptions reflect the level of maturity with which you intend to debate issues and ideas, we may as well stop this now before you get yourself banned.<br />
<br />
Somehow I doubt my presumptions are all that wild.  It's clear to me that you have not taken any interest in educating yourself about item decay in EQ2, which would be the responsible thing to do in a debate.  I always look up the other sides opinion and facts when I am in a debate.  It helps me formulate my opinion more clearly and factually.<br />
<br />
SWG has a great economy.  It can even smooth out spikes and problems from exploits and bugs in the long term.  Just like the real economy.  <br />
<br />
I already responded to the motivation for buying new cars with Scirocco's post so I won't go into that again, but you did bring up consumables.  So here's a short analogy:<br />
<br />
Car = Armor<br />
Fuel, Oil, etc. = Repairs to Armor<br />
<br />
As long as it's not a huge burden to the player, why not include item decay to keep the economy running smoothly?  It just makes sense to include it in a game.  Many games I have played have had some kind of item decay in them and they have never been a huge burden to me.  If there was an easy way to script item decay into NWN, I'd do it for the server I want to set up someday.  It's just not very feasible to do with that game engine.<br />
<br />
I don't know why I even bother with this anymore as you're too stubborn to look past your infatuation with keeping your phat lewts to see the benefits of item decay.  It's not like I have to worry that it's going to be taken out of EQ2.  It's already an integral part of the game.</div></div><hr />

Just saw that as I re-read the posts... and it stuck out at me this time.  I guess you haven't read anything about EQ2 either... it's going to be a VERY different game from the original EverQuest.  Very different.  They're going to be focusing on immersion a whole lot more than EQ ever has.  You have to declare citizenship with either Qeynos (Good) or Freeport(Evil).  The class system is very different as well which looks to me will ease grouping very much. <br />
<br />
There's a ton of posts by Moorgard that he even linked in this very thread that describes so much about EQ2 and if you took the time to read through that link he posted, you'd really see how different EQ2 is going to be.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Philby</div><div class="date">11-01-2003, 03:11 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I think one of the problems with the EQ economy is that while items were constantly entering the world, items rarely left the game. Items were occasionally sold to vendors, but this was the exception rather than the rule. Given the poor prices offered by NPC vendors, even the most scroogelike player likely preferred to donate a low level item to a newbie. The example of people retiring does not seem to hit the mark, as retirement means one's characters are gone as well, so while there are less items there are also less players. <br />
<br />
I think people overemphasize inflation, as more money circulating means higher prices for items. I think the problem was deflation, as if there is one sure thing in EQ, it was that prices for almost all items drop over time. This situation is exacerbated by the deliberate policy of having the value and usefulness of the gear from new expansion severely diminished. In my opinion, controlling items is far more important than controlling platinum, especially in a closed economy where there is little money leaving (except for a few minor items like peridots, horses, food, etc.). <br />
<br />
Since the developers in EQ2 are planning to limit twinking, the question is why have item decay? Well one reason is that it would be nice for people to adventure for their gear as opposed to buying all of it in the bazaar. I think it is sad that if one started EQ now, one wouldn't likely pick up an item that would be useful for oneself until level 55 or 60.  Killing spiders for their silk and selling it to a high level tailor so one could buy items in the bazaar is not exactly the stuff of legends. Futhermore, with more money leaving the economy in EQ2 due to tradeskills (there is an Artisan class), eliminating items from the game becomes more important.<br />
<br />
From what I understand, most or all uber items will not decay. Also, the decayed items can be repaired and my guess is that  the decay will be slow enough so that the item should be 75% decayed or permanently broken only once one has outgrown the item. <br />
<br />
So while I don't wake up every morning and yell, &quot;Hooray for item decay&quot; I think some mechanism is needed to pull items out of the economy. <br />
<br />
On a related note, I give the EQ2 developers credit for trying to avoid trivializing the lower level game by limiting powerlevelling, twinking and encouraging grouping more. Imagine starting starting EQLive now as a pure melee.</div></div><hr />

The players actions as a whole determine what happens in the GvE struggle... opening up new possibilities and more for the side that's winning.<br />

Now that was a game that knew how to keep track of how you acted without imposing artificial &quot;factions&quot; on everything.<br />
<br />
(Speaking, of course, of the classic Ultima series, particularly IV and V.)<br />
<br />
And dont hold your breath about your actions affecting the gameworld at all.  No MMOG to date has accomplished that on any meaningful level.  Even the much lauded Asheron's Call 2 soon fell behind its promised monthly gameworld updates, and that was M$ backed.  And what ever happened to AO's five year storyline?  (That was AO, wasnt it?)<br />
<br />
Be realistic...  EQ2 is brought to you by the same people who brought you EQ.  It wont be some amazing new departure from the genre.  It'll be more of the same, wrapped in a new package with nice graphics, and some tweaks here and there.<br />
<br />
Plus item decay!</div></div><hr />

Same cake, different frosting.  You know, my character in a sense declared allegiance to Rivervale at one point (I am one with the wall!).  Ultimately it sounds like the home town thing will be no different from what happens when Oldoak strolls in to Neriak (of course, I only go there to commit horrible murther anyway). Mechanics will change some, and yes it will play differently.  But it will still be like EQ in many fundamental respects.  And it will be no more immersive than EQ was.  Really.  Because immersion won't be required, and most people simply won't want to bother with it.  They will make a toon they like, and group up with friends, and kill mobs, and gather loot, etc, ad nauseum.<br />
<br />
But the philosophy of design for EQ2 will not be a departure.  This is still Sony.  They will still want a big market.  They will still build a game that lets people do mostly whatever the hell they want, and which has a lot of content targeted to different groups.<br />
<br />
I have read a fair bit about EQ2.  I have seen nothing that suggests to me that they are going to have enforced sitting in temples or any of the other notions you were suggesting for your ideal.<br />
<br />
They will have:<br />
<br />
Mobs to kill that you kill to grind experience.<br />
<br />
A very nicely revamped tradeskill system that genuinely sounds new, and maybe (just possibly) will be fun in its own right.<br />
<br />
Lots and lots of focus on grouping.<br />
<br />

Immersive does not mean role play.  Immersive means, well, immersive.  I don't have a problem with immersive.  Immersive is good.  It is about the game really sucking you in.  It is about temporary suspension of disbelief.  I will even say it is the wow factor.  It is NOT about the game creating slavish illusion of life.<br />

/sigh.  I wish I was better at walking away from a debate.  In truth, this thread matters less to me than the debate itself.  I already said I will buy and try EQ2 but everything I have read about it tells me I probably won't stick to it.  And yes, I understand what I read.<br />

And incidentally, the flourish of withholding yourself until us lesser folk edumacate ourselves up to your EQ2 level...well....that was just a bit over the top, don't you think?<br />

<br />
Admit it. You don't think we've read the EQ2 material because you can't fathom how anyone could possibly read it and not be convinced that it will be a revolutionary departure from EQ1. Is it so shocking to think we actually have read everything there is to read about EQ2 and just don't like the concept, or just don't believe it will be anything like your interpretation?<br />
<br />
Aside from feature definitions, Moorgard is selling a new game. That's what marketing is supposed to do: sell a product as something bold and different, even groundbreaking. This isn't dissimilar to what Sony has done with every expansion release - it's hype. <br />
<br />
I contend that it is you who hasn't read the EQ2 information carefully enough. Essentially, you have envisioned the type of new game you would like to play, and are reading much of your own vision into how you interpret EQ2 descriptions. Fact is, some of the things you've expounded upon here aren't detailed at all by Moorgard; and other topics are in direct conflict. You are assuming that since EQ2 has several of the elements you're looking for, it will contain others as well. <br />
<br />
For example, you said: &quot;My ideas would try to guide people into playing their role instead of playing a greedy loot whore. It'd guide people into being a part of the world instead of just absorbing the world and spitting out everything but the loot.&quot;<br />
<br />
Yet Moorgard posted: &quot;The assumption is that since players make the best items in the game, the best items will be easily obtainable, making loot all but worthless. This is not the way we’re designing our game. In fact, the exact opposite is true. Just like in EverQuest, loot matters. A lot. &quot;<br />
<br />
You've also misinterpreted quite a bit about what Moorgard said regarding item decay. For instance you said, &quot;Actually, I think I read something along those very lines already in the works for EQ2. Twinking a low level alt with a powerful weapon increases the chance of it breaking.&quot;  -- conflicts with the loot system Moorgard described which uses level restrictions to prevent twinking; although he acknowledged that secondary characters would have an advantage in the player being able to equip them with the best armor &quot;for their level.&quot;  <br />
<br />
I suspect you'll keep those rose-colored glasses on for a good long while, and play the new game in the spirit of what you have envisioned it to be .... well, until the undesirable factors become too prevalent to overlook anymore. But I also suspect that's how you approached EQ1 initially and now you've become disappointed and dejected that it didn't turn out to be the roleplaying experience you might've anticipated. <br />

<br />
As for item repair, it's something you'll probably be able to do every now and then while your passing through the city or while you're LFG.  And if it is anything at all like item decay in SWG, it will not be a daily concern.  Like I said before, I've only replaced one gun due to having a low condition.  And that was after months of hunting and pvp.  I'm pretty sure a few pistoleers helped that gun to wear down.  They get a special attack that targets their opponents weapon and damages.<br />
<br />
EQ is all about greed.  No one gives a damn about any motivation beyond that.  All I want is for the illusion of some other motivations beyond greed.  The hero or heroine in a fantasy story doesn't seek out the vile wizard to steal his phat lewts.  They go out and try to defeat the wizard because someone pays them to do it, they feel it's the right thing to do, the wizard has taken something or someone from them, or could be causing problems for their guild, home town, friends, etc.<br />
<br />
There are far better ways to motivate people other than greed.  Greed ruined EQ.  And I'm pretty sure greed in the long run will ruin EQ2, but maybe it will have a larger population of roleplayers and that will at least keep the game fun.</div></div><hr />

Oh, and I've been tempted to start a beastlord.  And then there's the necromancer I started on Stromm a while back.

Now, if instead there was no penalty for NOT doing these quests, just a slight bonus for doing them, that would be a different story.  I'm still not convinced they'd be worth the development effort; I'm all for adding more scripted events but I don't think they should be focused on mundane activities.

I already thought of that.  People that know they're going to be away or not playing an alt for a long time, can hail a special npc that gives the character a No Drop, Lore token. edit: Also, low level characters would be exempt from the bonus/penalties and quests.  Level 20 or level 25 would be a good time for them to start taking their role more seriously in the game.  Have the guidhall offer lots of typical newbie quests with lots of information and lore for them though, instead of the monthly required quest.<br />
<br />
The next time that character logs on, the token is removed and any penalties for not doing the monthly quest are removed if the last time the character was played was over two months ago.<br />
<br />
Even if they are penalized, a simple, 90 minute (LDoN-style instanced zone) quest will get rid of the penalties and give them the bonus.  I don't hear a lot of people complaining that LDoN adventures take too long.  <br />
<br />

If there wasn't a difference, then it also wouldn't matter whether class balance was brought about by nerfing the more powerful ones or by boosting the weaker ones, right?<br />
<br />
Tying penalties to RL time is a really bad idea.  The end result is that people that spend a higher percentage of their RL time playing the game benefit more, because a smaller fraction of their game time is spent doing these quests.  Consider someone who plays 100 hours a month compared to someone who plays 5 hours a month.  The first player spends 1% of their game time on a quest to avoid a penalty, while the second player spends 20% of their game time for the same effect.  Isn't that something you've been fighting against?<br />
<br />
If you insist on there being penalties at all (which I'm not convinced there's any need for), perhaps they should be tied to /played time instead.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Why does it matter?  If the required quest is an appropriate challenge for the groups level (ala LDoN style instanced zones), then why does it matter that one person spent a greater percentage of their time on that quest than another?  Either way, it's not just to avoid a penalty, but to gain experience, loot, lore, and faction.  Maybe even tie it into an adventure points system as well.<br />

You're being deliberately obtuse.   In one case, there's a bonus or reward for doing the quest.  In the other case, there's a penalty for not doing the quest.   Of course, I don't expect you to see the difference, because by this point you have demonstrated a lack of understanding of the consumer psyche.<br />

Now here I *do* agree with you, but EQ2 isn't going to be that game either.  For a game to TRULY do this, it would have to let players have that kind of impact.  IE, if you kill the Foozle, the Foozle STAYS dead so that he can never terrorize another small village of Cuddlies.  That kind of thing is just not possible in an MMOG right now, nor do I expect it to be possible anytime soon.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It doesn't have to stay dead to the world... just the player.  And guess what, that kind of game is out.  I haven't been around much lately... I've been exploring FFXI.  And wow! The graphics are great, smooth even at max settings everywhere on an average computer, and a wonderful quest/mission storyline that is awesome.<br />
<br />
Right now I am doing missions for my country.  I speak to some guards at the gatehouse and they give me missions that I can only do once.  Throughout the entire game, there are little cutscenes with the NPC's talking to you and to each other.  Special effects and events.  FFXI is simply amazing so far.<br />
<br />
I only have a couple problems with it, but it's mostly interface and control problems.  I am still planning on trying EQ2, but it's going to have to be really good on the immersion part to beat FFXI.  <br />
<br />
And the intro cgi movie is absolutely beautiful and heartwrenching.  I'd love to see the storyline behind FFXI made into a full length CGI movie, but I think I'm going to have just as much fun playing through the storyline in the game.<br />
<br />
Most people here wouldn't enjoy playing FFXI online the way I am.  The way the game is meant to be played.  The more I play it, the more I realize and understand that it really is a Final Fantasy style game.  The combat system, graphics, style, moves, the quests, everything... it's like a multiplayer version of FF XIII or IX.  <br />
<br />
EQ2 has it's work cut out for it.  If they can incorporate all the good things from EQ, SWG, and now FFXI... it would make a truly fun game.  I'll just stick with FFXI for now though.  My concerns for EQ2 just don't matter as much now.<br />

Now that statement there is what got me.  You maybe talking about FFXI, but are you 110% positive that this game is meant to only be played 1 way and your doing it?  If a player decides to do 1 thing different from you, is that the &quot;wrong&quot; way.  I'd say not.  <br />
<br />
1 unique thing MMORPG's have over any other genre is players have more freedom to go do whatever and go whereever their  mood takes them.  People ask me what the point of Everquest is, and I find it hard to describe becuase really there is no point, it is a world that a player has a diverse amount of things they can do, and an even more diverse way to do it.  So you say that 1 player is doing it the right way completely destroys the uniqueness of MMORPG's.  If anything (and I think it is truely the aim of all MMORPG's in production) the future games are looking on expanding the diversity of what to do not narrow it down.<br />

<br />
Getting a +1 if I decide to do the quest means I'm FREE to do the quest or not. Doing the quest IMPROVES my character.<br />
<br />
Getting a -1 if I don't do the quest means I HAVE to do the quest if I don't want my character to WEAKEN.<br />
<br />
<br />
Everyone I know would rather not play a game that bullies you into doing things (&quot;do this or I'll take 1 point from you&quot;). A game that instead rewards you for doing things would be much more successful in every way.<br />
<br />
Which is why the penalty, if any, for not completing the quest, should be 100 times less than the reward for doing it. Like a 1-2 points negative faction adjustment vs 5-6 points positive adjustment+loot+xp.<br />
<br />
<br />
I also thought the personal quest system could be tied to an adventure points system. the more you do, the more the list of services you can use at your character class building expands (like being able to train skills to a higher cap -and I mean train cap, not skill cap- , being able to purchase better items at the shops...). Basically, doing the quest gives you an advantage over normal adventures, which is comfort within your class hall.<br />
I do think tying such quests to actual numerical development of the character (ie say the character would only be able to learn skills if they have enough class points for that skill to appear in the class trainer's skill list) would however make those quest more like 'chores' to the casual RPGer, because they would see the quests more like roadblocks to their enjoyment rather than bonuses. Although it might be interesting if the game revolved around this system, it is not feasible to add this kind of thing to anything looking like the current EQ.<br />
<br />
And yes, such a quest system would have to be tied to /played, not RL.<br />

<br />
There is a psychological difference, but the point is the developer saying 'this is a bonus not a penalty' does not make it so.<br />
<br />
Think of epics, having your epic used to be a bonus, now not having it is a penalty. Similarly for SoL spells.<br />
<br />
In this case, the quest is stated to be very easy. So most people would do it. So anyone who didn't would be sufferring a penalty.<br />

<br />
In FFXI, the different regions can fall under control of one of the three kingdoms, or the beastmen.  If the beastmen gain control, valuable crystals will no longer drop in the region. PENALTY<br />
<br />
However, to slightly offset the penalty, you gain more conquest points while they control that region until the balance has shifted back into your favor.  There are also missions you can do to gain rank in your community and gain access to items you can't get anywhere else.<br />
<br />
Not doing the Conquest stuff however, weakens you and everyone else around you.  That seems to be 'bullying' to me and a lot of people just don't give a damn about it.  They're having a great time enjoying the immersion in FFXI.<br />
<br />
Like I said, if EQ2 can do what FFXI has done, I'll play it and continue to play it.  Even their class/job systems are similar.  Final Fantasy just has a, to borrow a term from Absor, kick ass team of storywriters behind it.  <br />
<br />
I hope EQ2 does do well and is as immersive as Moorgard says it will be.  It'd be nice to be in a familiar setting.  Sort of like it's nice to play FF in a familiar setting with friends.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Not having your epic today is really not that big a deal because there are better than epic options out there, and some &quot;about as good as epic options&quot; that you can get on your own.<br />
<br />
The point is, the subjective value of the quest is the core of the difference.<br />
<br />
Directly punish me for NOT doing something, and you move my character backwards and make me resentful.<br />
<br />
Tell me I will get a reward for DOING something, then I can assess for myself if the reward is worth the time invested, or the experience to achieve it.<br />
<br />
I am sorry but the &quot;not giving me candy is the same as taking candy away from me because someone else got some when I didn't&quot; is a complete BS argument.  It doesn't even make any sense.<br />
<br />
Aly, my bit of advice for you is that if you like how FFXI works, play FFXI.  Don't expect every game that comes out to mimic the parts you like and get rid of the parts you don't.  Each game will ahvea  design vision, and this late in the game, even if EQ2 people thought that was a great idea, they probably couldn't change the direction they are headed.  And I doubt they think it is a good idea.</div></div><hr />

Q:  What is it called when a game does not punish you and does not reward you when you do not act?  A:  A lack of mudflation, a n absence of unfun, an absence of fun; call it &quot;peace.&quot;<br />
<br />
Comments:<br />
<br />
The rate over time of required action to change of strength is a measure of (or perhaps just a factor in) fun.<br />
<br />
EQ is fun when you have bursts of character improvement (levels/spells, AA, loot, combine item success), unfun when you suffer decreases in character improvement (die, lose items by failing a combine, lose items from a bug).<br />
<br />
EQII will be less fun when (if) items require repair, and have peace when (if) mudflation doesn't occur.  However, the time over which such unfun will occur will be short, while the time over which peace will occur will be long.  This is a difference of intensity of experience.<br />
<br />
Add:<br />
<br />
You can gain peace by not playing at all, too.<br />
<br />
Conclusion, opinion:<br />
<br />
EQII with item decay and repair will have more more-intensive unfun, and more less-intensive peace.<br />
<br />
EQ has a great deal to do with the destination; the journey is not always pleasant.<br />

<br />
From what I've read, there are required quests in EQ2.  Seems they did think it was a good idea. *shrugs*  I believe you're required to do some quest to open up the classes further along the hiearchy.  Such as Warrior to Paladin.  <br />
<br />
So there will be requirements in EQ2.  There are penalties for not doing them.  And bonuses for doing them.  Guess some of you won't be playing then as anythign required is &quot;unfun&quot;.<br />
<br />
A game requires you to act to avoid a negative adjustment. &lt;-- unfun<br />
<br />
A game requires you to act to gain a postive adjustment. &lt;-- fun<br />
<br />
Or consider this:<br />
<br />
A game requires you to act to gain a positive adjustment instead of a negative adjustment.  There is no middle ground.  The bonus would be worth it.  If one required quest a month, that is heavily tied into the lore and current events of the game world, is too much for some of you, I wonder how you ever get anything done at work.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Simple.   I play games as an escape from the requirements of work.  I don't equate playing a MMORPG with work.  The fact that you do bespeaks volumes....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Aly</div><div class="date">11-04-2003, 03:51 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">*rolls eyes* You're far more dense than I am Scirocco.  I consider my characters role in a game.  Not just what stats or gear I have.  I don't consider that work.  That is fun.  To be a part of that storyline is fun.  To discover tidbits of lore here and there.  That's fun.  Having a few requirements in the game isn't that big of a deal if it adds to the immersion without detracting from it.<br />
<br />
You're just a lazy, greedy loot whore.  You want your gear the easiest way possible with the least amount of danger.  And you want to keep it forever and ever so you can hug and keep it warm and call it George. <br />
<br />
Immersion is what provides the escape you seek.  Games where you just kill stuff for stuff are boring.  You can get through EQ from level 1 to 65 without really bothering to read anything about the lore of the game.  Without bothering to interact with NPC's at all.  Nothing in the game truly promotes immersion.<br />
<br />
How many of you actually read and remember the text for each LDoN adventure?  Not many of you I would bet.  You look for the type of mission and Mob Name for assassination/rescue.  Nothing else.<br />
<br />
Playing EQ is a job anyway.  I've never seen a game that was such a boring grind, ever.  It's more work than work is.  I work for seven hours, I see some benefits for it.  I play EQ for seven hours and unless I get really luck, I don't see anything worth that time.<br />
<br />
FFXI makes the game fun through immersion, storyline quests and more.  EQ2 will need that kind of immersion as well.  It'd be nice to see that much detailed immersion and lore in familiar setting like Norrath.</div></div><hr />

  Actually this would not be a penalty for not doing the &quot;quest&quot;  it is actually a career choice for your character how is that mandatory, what happens if I decide I just want to continue being a Warrior, you saying I'm being penalised? <br />
<br />
Aly, its seems to me your fighting a loosing battle, you like your games your way, everyone else likes it different.  Your not going to change that here, it's not in your power.  Calling people names (&quot;You're just a lazy, greedy loot whore.&quot;) will not help anything.<br />
<br />
Actually I really wasn't on either side but after reading your last 2 statements  COME ON SCIROCCO!!!!.  Your loosing crowd not gaining it.</div></div><hr />

1.  Do the monthly quest and get +50 hp.<br />
<br />
2.  Every month your character gets a bonus +50 hp, but if you don’t do the monthly quest you don’t get this free bonus.<br />

Which would you prefer and why?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kulothar</div><div class="date">11-04-2003, 09:58 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Anyway,  I will probably try EQII and make up my own mind (and bitch a lot about what I don't Like.)    <br />
<br />
Decay can be implemented to the point it becomes a detractor but if done properly and Items can be repaired I will probably overlook it as part of the game.   Just like having to pay for food and water when I am too lazy to forage.  <br />
<br />
Without Decay there are arguements about too many UBER items in the game ruining the economy.   If you play the game for items, there are NEVER too many Uber items and if you play to sell off your items for better ones then decay is detrimintal.   The speed of decay is what concerns me.  I don't want to be naked between when I can afford one item and the next.  <br />
<br />
As for roleplay,  EQ has shown that there is a spot for RP, PVP and hunting.  I do not see Sony mandating roleplay and I hope they separate the pure PvP from the blue servers or there will be a lot of discontent.   PvP don't like being stuck on carebear servers and casual/passive players don't like being griefed.  There is a place for both, both are fun depending on the player and to leave either out deminishes the game. <br />
<br />
As for Quenos=Good , Freeport = Evil... Well where do the neutrals go?? I guess they are in expansions later.  Quenos has a few SK/Necro Bertrox worshipers to mess with players and Freeport has a &quot;Safe&quot; lawful Paladin/Cleric Marr area but those will have to be modified.  There has to be a bank for each area if they keep them.   <br />
<br />
If people decide to be neutral they will end up dieing both places until a third empire comes online.   As seen in AirWarrior, the more countries the better balanced due to the 2 vs 1 aspect of ganging up on the aggressor.   <br />
<br />
The main thing I disliked about good/evil wars was that the hunting grounds often get segregated by level controled by one or the other.  In the old world LGuk and SolB were great 30+ areas but could easily be controled by Evil races.   There has to be a better distribution of hunting grounds or PvP will make leveling at certain ranges very hard to do.    <br />
<br />
With two &quot;Countries&quot; you also make quest limited to certain areas just as Diety based quests limited who can do them.  Therefore if quests are implimented they have to be balanced for both sides.  <br />
<br />
Overall,  I am hopeful that EQ II is a new and exciting game but I will not delete my Eq acct just because it came out.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
I think you're getting confused, Aly.   First, you justify the imposition of mandatory quests by analogizing doing them to doing one's RL job (&quot;I wonder how you ever get anything done at work.&quot;).    It is apparent that the more a game incorporates RL work aspects for you (i.e., a low degree of abstraction for the tedious and mundane aspects), the better.<br />
<br />
Then you criticize EQ for being a &quot;job&quot; and being &quot;more work than work is.&quot;<br />
<br />
Just as you don't see anything in the game worth seven hours of playing EQ, many of us don't see anything worth having to put up with item decay and required quests.    Unfortunately, you think that because you think you know the way a &quot;game ought to be played,&quot; that that is the way everyone ought to be playing.  A true Game Nazi mentality.    <br />
<br />
You are mystified that people don't agree with you that item decay and mandatory quests are fun.  Because you can't understand how people could rationally disagree with you, or dislike something that you find fun, you have to dismiss them with labels like &quot;loot whore.&quot;   <br />
<br />
The fact that you have to resort to insulting me--&quot;You're just a lazy, greedy loot whore. You want your gear the easiest way possible with the least amount of danger. &quot;--demonstrates your lack of understanding.   No one opposing you is saying that items should be given to them.  For example, having good items be the result of a quest is good game design, in my opinion.  <br />
<br />
Opposing item decay does not make one a &quot;loot whore.&quot;   Perhaps one day, when you learn that &quot;your way&quot; is not necessarily the &quot;right way,&quot; you will realize that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Galamar</div><div class="date">11-04-2003, 11:47 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I would be happy with Item Decay as long as the max durability never decreased.  I don't want a_good_wisdomItem00 to be repaired into uselessness so I have to go and farm it again, or pay 10k or whatever.  How often do you buy a new TV?  Years?  New clothes to replace old ones?  Once a year?<br />
<br />
Getting items repaired is a good way to get money to Artisans or at least as a money sink.  However, making them get destroyed sucks.  EQ is very item-centric.  People want cool stuff.  They don't want that cool stuff to be destroyed through use.  Not to mention, who's going to be the worst off?  <br />
<br />
Tanks and melee.  Guess how much use casters are going to have for weapons are armor use?  Not much.  This is mainly a money sink for melee.  Would you want to be a tank and having to replace your armor all the time?   Let's hope they know what they're doing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Aly</div><div class="date">11-04-2003, 12:29 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yes, EQ is very item-centric.  EQ2 will not be as item-centric.  Loot will matter, but since item decay exists, I assume it's not going to be as mind numbingly boring (i.e. dumb ass raids and long boring camps) to get good gear.<br />
<br />
I play SWG.  It has item decay.  It's not a concern except for the most die hard pvper.  My stormtrooper armor that I earned with faction points has a durability of 45,000 points.  After two months of use, most armor pieces are still above 44,000.  At 1,000 durability lost a month that would still mean 45 months before you'd have to replace it.    That's over three years.<br />
<br />
Three REAL time years.  Weapons however will degrade considerably faster, but they're more easilly obtainable than good armor.<br />
<br />
Ans Scirocco, I am not mystified at the blatant laziness people here have exhibited.  Nor do I not understand your point. <br />
<br />
Anyone that has been in a hardcore raiding guild has treated EQ like it's a job.  They have requirements that if they don't do them, they don't get any better.  Games are supposed to be fun.  They're not supposed to be a chore.<br />
<br />
Nothing I have proposed would make the game a chore.  One required quest a month and occasional armor/weapon repair.  Those are far less tedious and time intensive boredom than farming the frogs in PoS for AAxp.  Or grinding xp with a group in BoT.  Far less boring than sitting on  your ass while 60 other people mill about hoping a couple people can organize something out of that mess.<br />
<br />
Something you fail to understand is that I would ensure that doing the quest was on top of everyone's mind because it's fun, it's full of information, it's great xp, and there's a decent chance of a good drop at the end.  Plus, the group leader finishes their monthly task and proves to the npc guild their devotion to the guild's cause.<br />
<br />
It could improve their faction with guild merchants, so spell reagents are cheaper, new spells are chearper, etc.  The storyline for the group leader would continue.  This is all stuff that is very possible to do even in EQ today, if people weren't so damned stubborn and set in their ways.</div></div><hr />

Ok, Lets just pretend there's a quest like that. so you do it in month 1. In month 2 etc etc. Isnt that kinda the same as raiding ? An event that you do to get better in the game. Kinda the same reason guilds raid i would say.<br />

Cheaper stuff ? hm.. *looks in bank, finds over 1 million plat* Like cheaper reagents matter in high end. Storyline .. If i wanted a storyline in the games i play. I'd choose one with an important one.

<br />
The difference is each month the quest changes, the storyline advances and there's something new to do.  LDoN quests are boring.  Nothing ever changes and you can rescue the same person ten times.  Or kill the same boss mob ten times.<br />
<br />
And yes, cheaper reagents would make a lot of clerics a lot happier.  With a faction system tied in to reagent merchants, more spells could require reagents.  Maybe poisons for rogues could be a little easier to use, but the costs would be higher or lower depending on your faction with the Poisoner's Guild or something like that.<br />
<br />
Make it to where faction really matters.  And the storyline is interesting.</div></div><hr />

You can dress it up however you like, say it's roleplaying or immersion or whatever -- but a required quest is a chore. <br />
<br />
You can claim such a quest is optional -- but if there is a penalty imposed for not doing the quest, it is indeed required. <br />
<br />
I don't think you truly understand why people don't want required quests in spite of being given a reward for completing it. <br />
<br />
Giving someone five dollars for a box of cookies. Or, giving someone five dollars for a box of cookies knowing they intend to break your fingers if you don't.  Even though both net the same effect on your pocket and both leave you with a reward, one is definitely not fun and if people have to choose between those two 'games', they will most certainly choose the former.<br />
<br />
What's so frelling bad about one required quest a month? We've been trying to tell you. It's the &quot;required&quot; part ... doesn't matter how infrequently or how painless, that will always bother most people when it comes to games.<br />
<br />
Yes, in EQ people do &quot;work&quot; and &quot;chores&quot; when there is an eventual benefit. However, each minute they spend is entirely optional; their character does not lose any portion of its ability to deal with encounterA from one week to the next if they don't play. <br />
<br />
To have them lose stats or suffer any penalty for not having much time to play during a given week or two, and finding themselves at any disadvantage (penalized) when they're able to log back on, is not going to reinforce the ultimate gaming behavior -- logging on in the first place.<br />
<br />
Now about item decay, Aly you are dead wrong on some of your perceptions of how EQ2 will work. They've already shifted gears on a few factors:  1.] It has been decided that many high-end items will be immune from decay; so apparently the designers do realize that there is a limit to what players are willing to risk when it comes to loot. 2.] It has been decided that items will not decay over time, but only upon death. <br />
<br />
As for your contention that EQ2 isn't going to be as item-centric or as motivated by greed ... did you happen to notice that EQ2 has devoted AN ENTIRE CLASS to those who wish to make and sell things? <br />
<br />
Did you happen to read Moorgard's assumption that most people will feel the need to have at least one artisan alt? If you think items, money, and greed will not be just as prevalent in EQ2 as those factors have been in EQ1, you're in a hopeless state of denial. And if you think roleplaying or quests or immersiveness is going to detract from the importance of money and items in EQ2, you're not paying attention. <br />

There is only one long term outcome from that.  Item decay will eventually be removed from the game altogether.<br />
<br />
I am not sure why they are not thinking forward on this, and I have said it already (because I knew this part) -- this is the battleground for uber v. casual, EQ2 style.  If you are uber, your gear will all be non decaying.  If you are casual, you will have item decay and item replacement to worry about.  So, double jeapordy really.  Your gear isn't as good, and you have to work harder to keep it.<br />
<br />
Add in the decay being related to game deaths, and you get a brand new issue.  If you don't have the uber gear, you are more likely to have in game deaths.  So the people least able to avoid death will be saddled with a special negative consequence of game death that other players will not.<br />
<br />
The only other way out of it is to make item decay such a trivial factor that it is almost like it is not happening at all, and then of course the question would be &quot;what is the point of it?&quot;<br />
<br />
PS...for the record, shoudlnt this whole thread be in OT?  I know it is popular and I am enjoying it but it isn't really about EQ at all...</div></div><hr />

Something that is interesting for person A isn't interesting for person B. We killed Quarm about 10 - 15 times now - dunno for sure how much - and i never even bothered to read the whole story line of Plane of Time. I just don't care. I play to game, to kill raid encounters and enjoy the game how i want it !</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Aly</div><div class="date">11-04-2003, 11:06 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">You want to treat it like a frelling arcade game. Pop in a quarter, kill stuff, get stuff.  And that's a stupid way to play.  Regardless of how much fun you think it is.  Nothing I have suggested would make the game any less fun.<br />
<br />
You'd still be doing the same exact things you're doing now.  The only difference would be the motivation for doing those things.  Being motivated by the immersion and the storyline; being motivated by your NPC guild's goals are good things to have in a game.<br />
<br />
It gets people thinking.  Maybe they would start to play a little more attention to the game around them instead of MobA in ZoneB for the fastest XP; and when killing BoringRaidMob1,500,402... they might think about why they're killing the God of Plagues instead of what phat lewts are going to drop.<br />
<br />
People like you Molilya are why MMORPG's are going down into cesspits.  EverQuest was meant to be an RPG and you basically crapped on their ideas and visions.   It wasn't supposed to be an arcade game.  And that's what people like you have driven it to be.<br />
<br />
Do you whine at SquareSoft when you can't play Final Fantasy VII like you want to, instead of the way they wanted you to?  Do you whine at the newspapers for not making the crossword or jumble puzzles easier for you?  Do you try to make up your own rules for board games like Scrabble?  Or whine at the makers of those board games because you don't want to play by their rules?<br />
<br />
EverQuest is not a game anymore.  It is a chore.  You run around killing stuff for meager rewards that take forever to get.  It's worse than a job.  At least with a job you get to see a paycheck on a regular basis.  <br />
<br />
EQ2 should stop using craptastic timesinks to try and extend the life of their game and let people play it at their own pace.  Hardcore gamers will fly through the levels and get the good gear pretty quickly while others may take their time and enjoy the scenery along the way, but not get bored with the scenery by seeing it over and over as they grind out yet another AA point in earth wing of BoT since they'll never see the rest of the game.<br />
<br />
 What's so frelling bad about one required quest a month? We've been trying to tell you. It's the &quot;required&quot; part ... doesn't matter how infrequently or how painless, that will always bother most people when it comes to games.<br />
<br />
Like one quest a month would really strain anyone beyond their capabilities.    In FFXI, to gain access to the Airships, I have to gain Rank 5 through a ton of quests for my kingdom.  If I don't, I'm being penalized by not being able to travel as fast or as easilly as others who have done the quest, can.<br />
<br />
So there's my motivation.  Ease of transport or face the lack of it.  Not being able to use the airships is a penalty, any way you look at it.  I have to do a quest to learn how to use a sub-class properly.  I'm being penalized if I don't, but I gain a benefit if I do.<br />
<br />
And quess what, people are happily doing the quests and not whining about them because they're pretty much required.  I'm happily doing the quests for my kingdom because it makes me better, it makes my kingdom better, it's a great storyline with the quests, and it's fun.<br />
<br />
I and well, I would guess, most of the people playing FFXI have no problems with the required quests.  I haven't really heard any complaints yet about it.  People are having fun doing the quests because they're enjoyable.<br />
<br />
EverQuest quests are NOT enjoyable.  They're tedious and boring.  If EverQuest 2 quests are in the same vein as EQ quests, I won't play past the free month.  If farming a rare spawn mob for a rare drop is the only way to do some quest, I won't play that way anymore.  My time is more valuable to me than to spend it wasting my time for some pixels.<br />
<br />
Best example is the Stormfeather spawn in Iceclad.  The satisfaction and use I would get out of completing that quest is not worth the time it requires to camp that damned griffin.  I quadded through levels 34 to 40 in Icelclad in about three afternoons and evenings.  The same warrior was there every day and every night, camping that bird. <br />
<br />
My time is better spent doing something else that is FUN and not boring.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Are you truly so shortsighted as to be unable to believe that others might enjoy things that you don't?<br />
<br />
If it has become a chore for you - cancel your *&amp;%# account.<br />
<br />
So there's my motivation. Ease of transport or face the lack of it. Not being able to use the airships is a penalty, any way you look at it. I have to do a quest to learn how to use a sub-class properly. I'm being penalized if I don't, but I gain a benefit if I do.<br />
<br />
Not from the way I (and apparently everyone in this thread other than you) look at it.<br />
<br />
A penalty is the removal/restriction of an ability. Not the failure to provide the ability.<br />
<br />
Do you have to do another quest every month to retain access to the Airships? How would you feel about having to do so?</div></div><hr />

<br />
In FFXI, to gain access to the Airships, I have to gain Rank 5 through a ton of quests for my kingdom. If I don't, I'm being penalized by not being able to travel as fast or as easilly as others who have done the quest, can. <br />
<br />
In this example, you describe no penalty for not doing the quests; what you describe simply means you aren't earning greater travel access than you currently have. If failing to do the quest had resulted in your current travel methods being removed or becoming more restricted -- that would be a penalty.<br />
<br />
If a friend gave you a gift certificate for a catered party at your favorite restaurant and you didn't go there to redeem it, you didn't lose anything; you simply gained nothing above what you already had. However, if you had given the restaurant a non-refundable deposit to reserve a banquet room and didn't show up, you'd have less than you started with -- that would be a penalty.<br />
<br />
Your example only illustrates how at least one aspect of FFXI is *exactly* like EQ -- if you don't complete certain tasks, you don't gain the corresponding benefits (no reward). If you do complete those tasks, you reap their benefits (reward). In neither case is anything taken away from you, hence no penalty.<br />

You want to treat it like a frelling arcade game. Pop in a quarter, kill stuff, get stuff.  And that's a stupid way to play.  Regardless of how much fun you think it is.  Nothing I have suggested would make the game any less fun.<br />
<br />
Eh, why isn't this a fun way to play?  I had a whole lot more fun killing mobs either individually, in groups or especially in raids than going around listening to the laughable npc dialog with its usual misspelled words and other bad grammar.<br />
<br />
I disagree with the usual DG crowd about how bad for the game it is that EQ has become too easy leveling up with all the hand holding over the last few expansions but not on this.  The ideas you want to inject into EQ are boring drudgery where players are forced to do quests or suffer the consequences.  I can get plenty of that at work and get paid well for it too.  Thanks anyway!<br />
<br />
<br />
It gets people thinking.  Maybe they would start to play a little more attention to the game around them instead of MobA in ZoneB for the fastest XP; and when killing BoringRaidMob1,500,402... they might think about why they're killing the God of Plagues instead of what phat lewts are going to drop.<br />
<br />
You're fighting a losing battle.  EQ raiding players care much more about stats and DPS for their characters than in the poorly written game lore because that's the way SOE has designed the game.  Raiders simply have to fight for better equipment if they want to have any hopes of moving on to bigger challenges.  Try to take your raiding crew into the elemental planes wearing only Kunark or Velious era equipment and see what happens.<br />
<br />
<br />
People like you Molilya are why MMORPG's are going down into cesspits.  EverQuest was meant to be an RPG and you basically crapped on their ideas and visions.   It wasn't supposed to be an arcade game.  And that's what people like you have driven it to be.<br />
<br />
Please direct me to the developer quotes where they specified that EQ was supposed to replicate totally the experience of a pen and paper RPG.  That's simply not feasible for developers or always desirable for players with limited time to play EQ.<br />
<br />
And snide remarks at other posters like Molilya isn't gonna win you a lot of converts either. :rolleyes:<br />
<br />
<br />
 EverQuest is not a game anymore.  It is a chore.  You run around killing stuff for meager rewards that take forever to get.  It's worse than a job.  At least with a job you get to see a paycheck on a regular basis.<br />
<br />
You seem to despise Everquest and most of its players so why do you continue to torture yourself and waste money on the subscription fee?  Why not quit and find something else more enjoyable?<br />
<br />
<br />
EverQuest quests are NOT enjoyable.  They're tedious and boring.  If EverQuest 2 quests are in the same vein as EQ quests, I won't play past the free month.  If farming a rare spawn mob for a rare drop is the only way to do some quest, I won't play that way anymore.  My time is more valuable to me than to spend it wasting my time for some pixels.<br />
<br />
Finally, something I can agree with you on.  EQ quests are boring outside of a few cool ones like the ring and shawl quests in Velious.  The infamous 'rare drop' or 'rare spawn' is a roadblock to slow the influx of quest rewards into the game once the quest has been detailed on spoiler sites.  I can understand why they do this.  I just wish quest developers could create some less frustrating method of slowing players down a bit.<br />
<br />
<br />
Best example is the Stormfeather spawn in Iceclad.  The satisfaction and use I would get out of completing that quest is not worth the time it requires to camp that damned griffin.  I quadded through levels 34 to 40 in Icelclad in about three afternoons and evenings.  The same warrior was there every day and every night, camping that bird.<br />
<br />
Should have told that dude about the sharks in Erudin that were dropping hundreds of thousands of plat per kill.  The Stormfeather spot would have been yours then. ;)</div></div><hr />

I'm tired of games catering to those kind of people.  And I have canceled my account for EQ finally.  The friends I made in the game just aren't enough to keep in playing anymore.  I gave LDoN a shot, but it's the biggest timesink ever in the history of EverQuest.  The only bright side to it is the fact that it's not as time intensive as raiding.<br />

There's absolutely no reason for any of that crap.  I honestly don't understand how anyone can have fun, sitting on their ass for hours grinding the same mob in the same spot over and over.  I honestly don't understand why anyone can have fun killing the same goobermob over and over and over and over with all the headaches inherent for organization to kill said goobermob.<br />
<br />
It's boring timesink after boring timesink.  Friends in the game are the only thing that made it worthwhile to me.  SquareEnix have done very well with their game.  It's FUN to play at all levels.  The quests are fun to do.<br />
<br />
EQ2 would be wise to go in that direction as well... away from boring timesinks.</div></div><hr />

Yes, I'm recommending that you find a nice single-player game. You'll no longer have to worry about any focus on greed other than your own, and you can sit around talking to NPCs as much as their scripts allow -- and I bet many of them are probably good listeners, even if they don't say much back.... :)<br />

It might be just me but as far as i know MMORPG's are doing GREAT world wide. So i think its actually a larger part of people that wants to PLAY games rather then roleplay or some other crap that i frankly don't enjoy. Did you make the plan for Everquest btw ? If not.. How can you KNOW its not atm what they want it to be ? Mostly games (and everything in life what suposed to make money) will evolve in a way that it caters most people. So what does that say to you ? I hope it does say something.<br />

Do you whine at SquareSoft when you can't play Final Fantasy VII like you want to, instead of the way they wanted you to? Do you whine at the newspapers for not making the crossword or jumble puzzles easier for you? Do you try to make up your own rules for board games like Scrabble? Or whine at the makers of those board games because you don't want to play by their rules? <br />
<br />
Nope.<br />
<br />
And quess what, people are happily doing the quests and not whining about them because they're pretty much required. I'm happily doing the quests for my kingdom because it makes me better, it makes my kingdom better, it's a great storyline with the quests, and it's fun. <br />
<br />
And guess what, people are happily raiding in EQ and not whining like you ! I'm happily raiding killing npc's in our world because it makes me better, It makes my guild better, and its fun !<br />

Nope.   I simply don't buy them or play them.  I find it ironic that you mention FF online, since the random server assignment in that game has got to be one of the most incredibly stupid design decisions for a MMORPG I have ever seen.   I won't waste my time whining at SquareSoft....I'll make my point by keeping my money in my pocket.<br />
<br />
That's the bottom line, a point you seem to forget.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Aly</div><div class="date">11-05-2003, 11:07 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The random server assignment was meant to keep server populations constant and about equal.  However, there is a system in game to get everyone on the same server.  It's called a World Pass.  The price of them, in game, is relative to the population of the server.  More people on the server, higher prices for the World Pass.<br />
<br />
One world pass is on average, 700 gil and is good for five people.  I can get 700 gil easilly now that I know how the auction houses work and what sells well.  So in a matter of a day or two you can get enough world passes for everyone.<br />

<br />
You’ve been playing FF for what, a few weeks at most now?  Seems to me a little hard to know whether a game is really good by that point.<br />
<br />
You say the quests are immersive, exciting and have nice cutscenes in them.  I wonder if you will still be saying that after you have played the game for 6 months, or whether you will be moaning that there is nothing to do once you reach high levels and that you have run out of quests to do.<br />
<br />
Most new things seem fun.  I remember lots of people went to play DAoC and said how much fun it was, but then a little later discovered that there wasn’t really anything to do at high levels, and that the PVP was very unbalanced.  I myself played AO for a few months and enjoyed it a great deal at the start, but then realised that there wasn’t really anything to strive for, other than fighting the same mobs with the same weapons and the same skills (just all upgraded a bit) and came back to EQ.<br />
<br />
Also in many ways time sinks are a good thing.  Besides the fact that they extend the life of a game, they also give a real sense of achievement when you finally get what you want.  Getting everything when you want it, and easily, isn’t something that will keep me interested for long.  One of my most satisfying EQ moments was finally getting through the PoJ trial.  It took something in the region of 12 attempts (half my group hadn’t played since Kunark, and using pickup tanks) plus lots of time waiting just to get a shot at the execution trial.  All of that made the final victory so much more exciting and memorable.  Of course not all time sinks are a good thing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kulothar</div><div class="date">11-06-2003, 09:16 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well,  I for one can say that EQ is what you make of it.  It was the pioneer in publicly accessable MMORPG with a 1st person view.  In the 4+ , 5+ heck how old is this game now...  Well Since release day, I have done quest, camped rare spawns, raided, trade skilled and on rare occasion gone to a newbie zone and RP'd..   I suck at quading but I am a very skilled puller/CR person.<br />
<br />
I am a long term casual player with only a couple hundred hrs played on Kulothar.   I have bitched about my share of crappy patches and nerfs but have seen how in the long run reason usually (not always) ends up in a reduction of hassels and better diversity in gameplay.  EQ really makes an effort to be everything for everyone but it is up to the player to find what he enjoys.  <br />
<br />
The current market today is expanding so that there is no reason to bitch because you don't like a game.  Change games if you are not happy.  <br />
<br />
If you want to RP there are SimsOL, Planetfall, SWG and soon MEO (Middle Earth Online).   MEO says they are targeting the RP market and only have humans (good or evil).   They will have world goal type quests and pocket quest (like LDoN).  <br />
<br />
If you want PvP you have more options from Shadowbane, SWG, UO etc.   When the PvP is more serious and a part of life.  <br />
<br />
If you don't like competeing with others around you then there are a lot of good single player games or some you can even network with your friends and gang up on. <br />
<br />
The truth of the EQII world will be seen when it survives it's first couple of patches and the first expansion comes out..   Anything that players see as a reason not to buy the game will probably be changed, including item rot. <br />
<br />
There are a couple of trueisms I have noticed:<br />
<br />
1) Some people are more serious about loot to the point of obsession. <br />
2) Some people play for fun. <br />
3) People tend to change their goals over time. <br />
4) Expansions are buggy and patches sometimes have to be patched. <br />
5) Competition is going to happen and how it is handled determines if it is good or bad. <br />
6) Scirocco is a loot/ep whore but a really good one and works hard at it.  <br />
(6a) By now Scirocco is used to people calling him that because he knows how to play the game at the high end and they don't. <br />
7) You cannot make all of the people happy at the same time. <br />
8) You cannot make some of the people happy ever. <br />
9) EQ evolved and if you don't like something let them know. <br />
10) A bitching dr00d is a happy dr00d.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I am pretty positive about the game.  It's actually fun being low level and just exploring.  I don't feel any pressure to hurry and level up to get to the supposedly good stuff.<br />
<br />
I can switch jobs (class) at any time I want by going back to my Mog House.  I could be a Level 20 Black Mage, Level 10 Warrior, Level 13 Thief, Level 6 White Mage, Level 4 Red Mage if I wanted to be.  Through a quest, I can learn to use two of my classes at the same time and after level 30, I can quest to learn an advanced job.<br />
<br />
Lots of people are actually roleplaying in the game and I believe it's because of the quests/missions and people's previous experiences with FF games.  There's a race of cat women (the males aren't allowed to come out and play) and they have a lot of r's in their speech.  Most of my friends who are Mithra roleplay this out most of the time.  Even in combat.<br />
<br />
The tarutaru add taru to the end of a lot of words.  They also use phrases like 'likey-wikey' and 'cutesy-wutesy'.   I see people talking like that all the time.  I caught a Hume talking like that after being in my group for a few hours with four other Tarutaru and he was the only Hume.<br />
<br />
It's like being around people with an accent all the time.  You start imitating it subconciously.  EQ2 should be designed to encourage that kind of roleplaying.  Immersive quests, even some of those dreaded required quests should be used.  Good NPC interaction.  Interesting and compelling motivatations outside of greed and lust.  Well, lust for love could be a character motivation.  I know I've had more than one D&amp;D character die for love.<br />
<br />
EQ2 should do anything it can to focus less on powergaming and loot whoring and more on the actual story and fun of the game.  Powergamers can still have fun in a game like that, but roleplayers can't have fun vice versa.</div></div><hr />

(6a) By now Scirocco is used to people calling him that because he knows how to play the game at the high end and they don't.  <br />
<br />
<br />
Actually, if you have to call me anything, I prefer to be called a Time-Restricted Power Gamer.  I don't go after XP, AA, or tradeskills all the time, but when I do, I try to be as efficient as possible.  I maximize my efficiency when doing those things so I have time for other things in the game, such as helping friends with quests, etc.<br />
<br />
As for &quot;loot whore,&quot; it depends on what you mean by that.   Yes, I have a very good idea of all the various mid-high end options for each equipment slot for a druid.   Knowledge is the key to efficiency.   But I don't center my gameplaying based on maximizing my personal equipment, as it really is only just one aspect of the game.   <br />
<br />
For example, when leveling up to 50, I went for levels first, and eschewed the &quot;standard&quot; equipment camps.  I hated camp lists, and I hated sitting on my rump camping one area for hours on end with a group.  I preferred to get to a higher level with inferior equipment (a naked druids is still pretty powerful), then go back and fill in slots by soloing in dungeons (thus taking much less time to get the particular item in question....efficient!).   Or by making plat through tradeskilling and just buying what I needed.<br />
<br />
As far as upgrades, I don't go for minor upgrades.  As a general matter, I often skip a &quot;step&quot; and hold out for truly significant upgrades.  For example, I don't have anything from NTOV, although my guild spent quite some time there.   Often stuff that dropped would be a bigger upgrade for someone else other than for me.  Instead, I &quot;skipped&quot; NTOV loot and waited to get a couple drops from ssra and VT.  Similarly, I have declined VT drops when offered to me on guild raids, because the upgrade wasn't big enough to warrant taking the item over someone else for whom it would be a bigger upgrade.  <br />
<br />
In fact, I appear to be in one of the skip phases right now.  I haven't gotten any loot drops on a guild raid since early May (5 months ago).  That's not to say I haven't gotten other upgrades for myself, of course, but those have been things purchased by me, made (by myself, such as Cloudy Ring of Pneumatic Force), or otherwise obtained largely independently.<br />
<br />
Similarly, I went on an open Agnarr raid a month or so back.  There was an open lotto for the ranged item with a heal haste effect with about 20 people in the lotto, and I won.   I subsequently reconsidered whether the item was enough of an upgrade for me as opposed to someone else (it only added 50 hp and 50 mana), and the effect didn't really suit my character (&quot;Dammit, Jim, I'm a nuker, not a doctor!&quot;), so I deferred (yes, my guildmates who went along on that raid think I am nuts...:)<br />
<br />
So, if the above describes a &quot;loot whore,&quot; then I am a &quot;loot whore.&quot;  And proud to be one. :)</div></div><hr />

You missed his commentaries on the Blast vs heal topic where he is actually opinionated.   I have a radically different play style than him but I have to respect his knowledge and effectiveness even if they do not work for me.   He was one of the foremost quaders and evoc druids, which for a time limited person is great.   Those of us that are more social and less focused cannot alway do things &quot;The most efficient way&quot; and quading litteraly drives me nuts.   <br />
<br />
We have dissagreed often over topics which shows exactly what this string is about.  EQ players are different and anything limiting (such as decay or only two sides) will destract from the game.  I am not saying they are bad Ideas, just that we will have to see how bad of a distraction they are.   I think anything that causes an uproar will be phased out quickly.  Anything that can be smoothly integrated to add to the game mechanics will be kept and improved.</div></div><hr />

As Kulothar points out, there are many different ways to play a druid well, and players with different playstyles can all do well playing a druid.   You may like (or have) to solo a lot, or you can group all the time.   You may like to farm for tradeskills, or you can raid at the highest level.   You can be an offensive nuker, or a primary healer and buffer.   Or a mix of all of the above.<br />

I look for these same characteristics in a class in any new MMORPG I play.</div></div><hr />

What kind of story it has.  Halo finally came out for the PC and while I'm not the best FPS player, I absolutely loved that game.  And FPS' are not the first game on my list I normally buy.<br />
<br />
The storyline and the graphics were gorgeous.  The missions were interesting and the AI was hilarious.  Stick a plasma grenade on one of the little grunts and they run back into their comrades screaming, 'Get it off! Get it off!'  <br />

As long as a game is fun to play, I could care less what gear I have.  That's why I finally got frustrated with EQ.  No matter what I did, it was going to take months to upgrade just one slot of armor.  And that was the only thing left in the game for me since there's such a demand placed on your schedule by goober guilds.<br />

I don't want to see EQ2 fall into that same trap.  There should not be such a distinction between hardcore and casual gamers.  If you design the game around casual gamers, the hardcore gamers can still have fun, they just get through the content faster and they're already used to grinding the same stuff over and over so it wouldn't be much of a difference from EQ as it is for them now.</div></div><hr />

Don't misunderstand.   I think all players look for how fun the game is.   What I listed above as what I look for in a MMORPG character is what I find fun.   You look for different things that make the game fun for you.<br />
<br />
Which brings us back to one of the original points.  I don't find item decay and maintenance fun.   I know that there are others who agree with me.   You don't.   Simple as that.</div></div><hr />
