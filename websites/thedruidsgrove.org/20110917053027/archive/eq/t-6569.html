People who own more expensive cars pay more in taxes and therefore are entitle to more right of way than people who buy economical cars with good fuel efficiency.

Never heard of him, bummer he's on subscription now.  But it does seem to me that just about any time I get cut off or someone takes my right of way, they're almost always in a very expensive car.  Closest I ever came to road rage was a woman in a $80k mercedes deciding that she WAS going to merge into my lane whether I was there or not.  Had my husband not been in the passenger seat, I would have let her cream me......her car will cost more than mine to get repaired.  Honda civics are a dime a dozen, parts are cheap.  And her insurance can eat her arrogance as they pay for her car AND mine to be fixed.<br />
<br />
However, since my husband would have been on the impact side of hte car, I thought it might be nice of me not to risk his life when I make my social equality statements.  He thought it was mighty big of me too LOL</div></div><hr />

My pet peeve are SUV drivers.  They're bigger than everyone else, they know you'll die and they won't in an accident, so they're unbelivably pushy and agressive drivers.  Not to mention their stupid vechicles are so #$#@! big they take up 1.15 parking spots.  And even worse, it's the fashion in So. CA to drive the pigs.  <br />
<br />
And the other trend is for parking lot owners to make their parking spaces smaller.  So you got these SUV's taking up more than one spot so about 1/3 of the parking lot sits unused, because no one can fit into the stupid spaces left!</div></div><hr />

<br />
Hear, hear!  Even 'regular' sized cars can be a real pain the way some parking slots are so small these days.  It's something I really notice in those odd places where they haven't shrunk the spaces to fit that one or 2 more cars in a row.  And then there's the dorks that can't be bothered to park straight, or even in the middle of the slot.<br />

When I had my Ranger I used to whack 'em with the doors all the time  :devil-lau  but my Taurus is still too shiney....<br />

As far as SUV drivers being bad, after moving from Texas to New York, I can say that it's not the car, it's the driver.  In Texas, there's an unwritten, but well understood rule that the biggest truck wins.  The guy in the Ford F350 will have right of way when being challenged by the little Kia whatever.  Here in NY?  Nope, everyone assumes they have right of way - which would probably explain why this state has the highest accident rate in the US.  I've found most of the problems with SUV drivers are usually on the neighborhood streets, not highways.  Usually its soccer mom's who bought this big honking car without knowing exactly &lt;i&gt;how&lt;/i&gt; big it is.<br />
<br />
My pet peeve though?<br />
Minivans with families.  Yes, minivans.<br />
<br />
There are fathers, mothers, uncles, aunts, whatever’s, out there who drive minivans with their families in tow.  There are minivan drivers out there who drive around without any consideration for the kids in their car.  I swear, the number of times I've seen minivans swerve into lanes, going 20 miles over the speed limit, parents talking on cell phones without paying attention to the road... sheesh.  Those drivers assume that their cars are super safe, and therefore they don't have to pay attention to anything.</div></div><hr />

people think 'oh i drive an suv, i ownzors teh roadzors'... and it's really a matter of knowing how to drive.  That and the fact that their suv is really nothing more than a tall station wagon.  You want a vehicle that goes anywhere, buy a real Jeep and get those 6 ton moving billboards off the highways... not that you'd ever take your 42'000 dollah suv off the highway... it might get dirty!<br />

Amen brotha!  Preach it!<br />
<br />
We rarely get snow/ice storms here, but when we do, OMG the morons in their 4WD cars thinking that 4WD makes it okay to cruise along packed snow with no chains at 60 mph.<br />
<br />
Hello?  If you lock up your wheels, it doesn't matter whether you have 2WD or 4WD, you still have 0 traction.  4WD automatics are insane...no compression braking with an automatic.<br />
<br />
The number of dorks I saw in ditches in their SUVs on the last snow/ice storm we had was amazing.  The rest of us puttering along at 25 mph seemed to be fine.<br />
<br />
And trucks?  The worst yet!  Rear wheel drive, no weight in the bed of the truck, fishtailing so bad that they're driving in ALL the lanes, simultaneously.  Cripes already.  The size of the truck seems to have no affect on the size of any body part other than the brain, and that seems an inverse relationship.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Stormhaven</div><div class="date">02-06-2004, 04:06 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Errr... actually Alyn, the SUVs that have the packages made for offroading do very, very well - even compared to their &quot;non-luxury&quot; counterparts.  Jeep and their &quot;Only in a Jeep&quot; commercials have done little to repair the damage done to their reputation due to their shoddy construction and cheap electrical systems.  Sure you may go bouncing off into the Yukon with your Jeep Wrangler or Cherokee, but you'll be paying for every little bump by replacing your transmission, repairing an axle and troubleshooting the wiring system for $60/hr (my experiences come from having several - 10+ - friends who have owned Jeeps - ranging from the early 90's to the current models).  As for their performance on slippery circumstances - mud, rain, snow, ice - they suck.  They're light vehicles and you'll find yourself slipping and hydroplaning more than the heavier &quot;6 ton moving billboards&quot;.  My friend had a '94 Cherokee, and the best wet performance increase he ever got was to drop a 600lb piece of furniture in the back.<br />
<br />
Also, &lt;i&gt;most&lt;/i&gt; SUVs are based on truck frame styles, &lt;b&gt;not&lt;/b&gt; cars.  Therefore, they are most certainly not like station wagons - more often than not, they're like small trucks (think Ranger body style).  This has only really started to change just recently as more and more families start to own SUVs - they're moving away from the utility of a truck body and merging the creature comforts of a sedan.  The late 80's Explorer is the only notable exception I can think of - the early Explorers were actually based on the Taurus body style if I recall correctly.<br />
<br />
Read some Road and Track, Motor Trend, even Consumer Reports and you'll see that the giant $55+k Land Cruisers match up pretty well with sub-$30's Jeeps as far as off roading capabilities go.  The only one that really blows everyone out of the water is the Hummer (not the H2 bastardized version, the real $150k thing).  I remember an old comparison that pits the Jeep Grand Cherokee vs the Toyota Land Cruiser vs the Range Rover.  They took all three down a trek through the Baja and the Jeep was rated best for &quot;in the element,&quot; the Range Rover just kinda sat in the middle, and the Land Cruiser was called the &quot;Hilton on wheels.&quot;  In other words, the Jeep kept you close to the land so you felt where you were driving.  The Land Cruiser handled the environment just as well, but you felt detached because it was like sitting on your living couch while driving.</div></div><hr />

On a related note, there is room for 2 cars outside the semi-detached house where I live... I normally park there, sure to remain on my side.<br />
<br />
Fairly often, random people (not our neighbour, who is a good chap) stuff their vehicles *right in the middle* of those two spaces, meaning I can't park outside the house I live in and neither can our neighbour if he needs to.  I don't object to random people parking there, but it'd be nice if they'd leave room for me :(<br />
<br />
I drive a fairly ancient Renault 5.  Don't see any reason to drive anything else.... it works, it's nippy (except up hills :D), is economical and can fit through / park in just about any gap without getting in anyone's way.<br />
<br />
I do sometimes get impatient with crawling traffic (hence I'll never move to London!) - open roads are more my thing, hate sitting in line switching back and forth between 2nd and 1st gear.</div></div><hr />

For some reason, I hear Eric Idle.  Maybe it's because of the 15 DVD collection of Monty Python that I got my husband for Christmas.</div></div><hr />

Almost as bad as owning a German car.</div></div><hr />

Yeah owning anything French is probably illegal here, but hey... they're obviously good at something :p  (Many normal people would disagree of course, but since when have I been normal :p)</div></div><hr />
