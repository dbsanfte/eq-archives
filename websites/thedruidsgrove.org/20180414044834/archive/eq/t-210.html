<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">JigsawDenniz</div><div class="date">07-31-2003, 10:45 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, I've now officially played every class at level 65 (both raiding and non-raiding, I also attempted soloing when possible).  Did I level every class to 65?  No.  Some were friend's accounts that let me play theirs for flagging reasons or just to get them some exp.<br />
<br />
From most overall fun to least overall fun, &lt;em&gt;in my personal opinion&lt;/em&gt;, I rank the classes as following:<br />
<br />
1.  &lt;strong&gt;Necromancer&lt;/strong&gt; very neat spells/abilities<br />
2.  &lt;strong&gt;Druid&lt;/strong&gt; jack-of-all-trades<br />
3.  &lt;strong&gt;Magician&lt;/strong&gt; wizard's responsibility w/ more variety<br />
4.  &lt;strong&gt;Beastlord&lt;/strong&gt; pet makes this the most fun support melee class<br />
5.  &lt;strong&gt;Ranger&lt;/strong&gt; archery is fun - for a while ~ most fun tank class, but rarely get to tank<br />
6.  &lt;strong&gt;Shadowknight&lt;/strong&gt; FD + tanking = ubah exp fun<br />
7.  &lt;strong&gt;Paladin&lt;/strong&gt; amazingly versatile on raids and exp<br />
8.  &lt;strong&gt;Monk&lt;/strong&gt; FD pulling is fun<br />
9.  &lt;strong&gt;Shaman&lt;/strong&gt; never went LFG, but fairly boring exp - fun soloing<br />
10. &lt;strong&gt;Warrior&lt;/strong&gt; autoattack hell, oh wait - every few minutes i press taunt - but damn fun during raids<br />
11. &lt;strong&gt;Wizard&lt;/strong&gt; lots of eye candy, but i've been afk for 30 minutes and noone has noticed<br />
12. &lt;strong&gt;Bard&lt;/strong&gt; too much work<br />
13. &lt;strong&gt;Cleric&lt;/strong&gt; responsibility-boredom ratio is outa whack<br />
14. &lt;strong&gt;Enchanter&lt;/strong&gt; having to use the mouse constantly sucks<br />
15. &lt;strong&gt;Rogue&lt;/strong&gt; autoattack hell w/o fun of tanking<br />
<br />
Everyone would have their own preferences and reasons, but for me I'm not the biggest fan of the melee game.  I prefer seeing the action from a tiny distance and during raids I really hate jockeying for position as a melee on smaller mobs (yard trash, for example).  I don't like being absolutely 100% crucial to the group or the raid because the way I live my RL I can't stay at the keyboard without end.  I love to ninja AFK for a minute or so and can't do that on clerics, enchanters, shaman, the puller, or as the tank.  Necro was the most fun class for me to play because I was never absolutely 100% required to make the exp group or the raid go, and the abilities and spells combined together are unbeatable.  I also liked being fairly self sufficient, even when around 71 of my closest friends.  Druids just do it all, which makes them fun - but my main is a druid so I've played one for 4 years and feel some attachment.  The only time I'm not having fun on a druid is when we do a modified heal chain that throws druids in with clerics.  Living only a heal-related life gives me the yawns.</div></div><hr />

I absolutley love the class and would deem it the most fun.  However, my GF has a necro and we've been duoing a lot lately.  I must admit that at times I am tempted to swap toons for the night ;) <br />
<br />
The least fun class, IMO, are warrior, cleric, wizard.  They are just too one dimensional.  All the others are a toss-up, with pet classes on top, and melees at the very bottom.  Bards are just too involved.  Some people might dig that though...</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">JigsawDenniz</div><div class="date">07-31-2003, 12:44 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I played each of them on raids and in exp groups, and the ones capable, I soloed with.  I actually went out of my way to make a point of doing this (though I didn't exactly tell anyone those were my intentions when I offered to help with exp and flags)~<br />
<br />
Leveling up to 65 is just about the most boring thing imaginable.  Nothing is more distressing than going from a guild group of level 65s that kick arse and know what they're doing to going to a mid-40s group of people who have no clue.  I'm not dogging on people of that level (we were all there once) but I'm just saying that it is two different games, and after playing the former, the latter isn't any fun to me anymore.  I've leveled three classes to 65.  Druid, Rogue, and Shaman.  That was enough.</div></div><hr />

<br />
When I play my Beast, its all very stress-free. I attack, someone heals me, someone snares runners, someone roots adds, it's all taken care of. Very Zen.<br />
<br />
Playing my healers is like ack the puller's hurt, where the hell is the slow, is he wearing ANY armor at all, how do you jump from 80 health to 45, jebus was that a FLURRY!?<br />

Very different. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Seriena</div><div class="date">07-31-2003, 06:01 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I've played enchanter, druid, cleric, ranger, monk and bard in groups and raid settings. Out of those I'd rank them:<br />
<br />
Druid<br />
Monk<br />
bard<br />
Ranger<br />
Cleric<br />
Enchanter<br />
<br />
Enchanter by far has to be the most boring, annoying class I have ever played. I just can't stand how fragile they are. Not to mention the limited spell slots, you're constantly changing things around and never have enough for all the spells you need mem'd. Then there's buffing everyone and their brother constantly. If there's not a mob to charm, they're just no fun.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">OttoeMobeel</div><div class="date">07-31-2003, 06:04 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">i personally find the complexity of the bard class to BE FUN itself.... back when i played my bard as my main, people respected the skill, i enjoyed the versatility, and swarm kiting was one of the funest solo tactics i've done, it's so easy if done right and after you have time to get the hang of it, yet still you're only about 2 seconds away from death at any moment<br />
<br />
the druid is prolly my second favorite class, due to the multiple options for soloing, multiple roles you can play in a group or raid.... but the lack of respect that druids get from the masses can be a bit disheartening, especially in contrast to the respect a well played bard gets<br />
<br />
of all the classes i've played, the least fun technically is my cleric, which isn't a shocker.... but it can still be &quot;fun&quot; to play him every once in a while to get that ego boost that comes with the EQ cultures cleric dependance.... i usually log him on my second PC to 2 box with my beastlord(yes my druid would be a better partner for my beast, but clerics are soooooo soo soooo easy to 2 box..... it's almost like just playing the one class, but with near infinite HP), but when i glance over at the PC he's logged on, i'd occasionally see random tells from people all over the place asking him if he's LFG and stuff.... this is even when his AFK tag is up at times.....<br />
<br />
the only class i've never played was a wizard, which just doesn't appeal to me.... but i could see how the uber blasts could be thrilling to some, and wizard players tend to be very very in love with their class... just to me, the difference in nukes isn't great enough to compensate for the complete lack of healing, or general utility... and for being a specialist class, their not as &quot;required&quot; as warriors or clerics.....altho i do admit warriors are not where they should be at the moment, i think everyone realizes this.... but pretty much every major raid(i know there are a few exceptions, but those raids are not as common in EQ as they should be) in the history of EQ has been designed around the cleric and warrior, every other class is just optional, including wizards</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Northerner</div><div class="date">07-31-2003, 11:17 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The Rogue class certainly has been a great deal of fun in the past but I'd agree that it is quite lackluster today.  Pre-SoS CRs were pretty interesting (although Monks and summons still were the most common solutions).  Positional damage, when it was a large amount over the competition, did get the blood flowing a bit also.  Twisting, strafing, spinning, aggro-management and cajoling the other melee to maximize damage was oddly fun before the very sensibility of wall-pinning became the norm.  I enjoyed it for a long time, although frankly I was getting burned out on the simplicity near the end.  All the previously fun parts are mickey-mouse now and what remains is sorely lacking.  There are those that find *very* active roles on raids though and the class certainly is perfect for setting targets and organizing battle flow.<br />
<br />
Druids are great as a counterpoint.  Playing the old fellow never really did get too tiresome, be it quadding peacefully (with a decent book handy for med times) or frantically covering various roles in a group or raid.  Overall I must admit I'll be hard pressed to even go back to a melee class in future games, as I think I have had enough of melee-range error messages and bathing in every AE that comes along.  The Druid class is not without faults but it is a good bit of fun to play at present.<br />
<br />
The others?  Well, I never played anything else beyond 50 so I'll leave the comments to the more learned.  I found playing another's Cleric to be more interesting than I might have expected but I suspect the novelty wears off.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I like my paladin first and foremost for the roleplay aspect and the fact that I like to be up in the action and moving around a lot.  Not only that, but unlike a warrior, when things get really hairy, I have a bag of tricks at my disposal that has saved a raid or even a group more than once.<br />

I have a wizard, too but I only like to play the wizard to blow stuff up.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The druid is fun because I feel safest as him.  Druids can usually port, snare/root or otherwise get out of sticky situations.<br />
<br />
The enchanter is fun because its very group friendly... and because I can spend my time enhancing others, and then sit back and let them get exps for me.<br />
<br />
The rogue is fun becuase of sneak/hide... sneak and hide and then wander the zone.. looking at all the cool architecture and places.  Also, the rogue is always a desired damage dealer in a group.</div></div><hr />

A group heal and something to set them apart to make them more desirable for grouping would be good.<br />
<br />
Beyond that I would have to say necros are also fun. Lots of different and cool spell lines plus a pet, can't beat that. <br />
<br />
I enjoy my warrior too but they would be a LOT more fun and less stressful if taunt actually WORKED. <br />
<br />
I also have a beastlord and they too are fun(at least for now, he's only level 30).<br />
<br />
I would never even dream of trying to play a bard. Too much work and potential for carpal tunnel syndrome. :p <br />
<br />
I made a frog shaman that I have never really played...maybe someday. I think the combo of soloing and being VERY needed for groups would be a good thing. :mad:</div></div><hr />

Enchanter having to use the mouse constantly sucks [/quote]<br />
<br />
I two box a 80+ AA L65 Enchanter so I know a bit about this class.<br />
<br />
I play the game almost 100% from the keyboard.  I rarely touch the mouse.  You'd probably be shocked to know just how much you can get done with an Enchanter without using the mouse to click on a mob.  F8 almost always works for add target mezz, if you angle and dangle the Enchanter.  Yes, they aren't glued to the ground.<br />
<br />
Enchanters aren't dull.  Enchanters played meakly, are a lot like being a fireman.  They sit around and do not much, but when there is a fire everyone looks at them to put it out.<br />
<br />
If you have some courage you can charm a mob and add insane DPS  -- and the best of the best do, but not I on two box.</div></div><hr />

I suppose that is one of the classes that requires the most practice ;)   (most can be learned in about5 minutes)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Menlaiene</div><div class="date">08-01-2003, 09:27 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">It depends on the person.  Myself, I can't stand melee.  The most boring classes I can imagine are warrior, monk, and rogue.  I've played my boyfriend's monk a couple times and did not enjoy it.  But plenty of people play these classes so I guess they're alright.<br />
<br />
I've played three characters:  cleric, enchanter, and druid.<br />
<br />
The enchanter is either the most fun class ever or makes me want to fall asleep.  There is no in between.  When you're doing heavy crowd control or charming, it's incredible.  But when you're just a buff bitch as the group pulls single after single and you could probably go afk until haste wears off and no one would notice, it seriously sucks.  <br />
<br />
Cleric:  A lot of people call this class boring or the most one dimensional and I really don't know why.  Pure melee, as well as wizards all seem more one dimensional to me.  The cleric is only boring to me when virtually no healing is needed at all.  Otherwise, I only need a break from her because of stress.  With crazy PoP damage spikes, I have to be completely paying attention constantly or someone dies.  I can't go afk.  I can't be tired.  I am hoping the stress will lessen when I level up and get some better heals.  But the most fun thing about playing a cleric is finding a group in 15 minutes.<br />
<br />
Druid:  The druid was my first charater, and my main for a long time.  I found her fun to play, and as my role shifted alot I rarely felt like I was constantly doing the same thing.  Although playing healer in PoP groups brought on the same stress as with the cleric, except moreso.  The main reason I quit the druid was looking for group for hours was about as fun to me as going to the dentist, and if I have to solo I'd rather read a book.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I have to disagree a bit here.. I can understand that going from an experienced group of players from to a group of &quot;newbs&quot; can be annoying and sometimes a waste of time. It's also fun sometimes. You can play the teacher role and help a newb learn some stuff, and that can be rather satisfying at times.<br />
<br />
For instance, the other night I was playing my bard in OT in a level 35ish group with a mix of twinks/newbs. Well, the SK tank was single pulling and the twinks in the group starting getting a bit antsy for faster pulls.<br />
<br />
So I start chain pulling/parking with the bard and we are just non-stop killing. The newbs maybe learned a thing or two and the twinks were satisfied with the EXP. Best part of the whole thing was this.. I learned how to pull and cc on my bard, until that point I had only served in a melle song/mana song role.<br />
<br />
So the newb groups do have their purpose, you can teach the real newbs a thing or two and you can learn how to play your twink and not become a twinked newb yourself   ;=)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yeah, that's beyond my 2/4-boxing skill level too!  <br />

When I two-box an enchanter I use my meleer to target for mez, then enchanter assists meleer.</div></div><hr />

A question please, and this is not meant in any other vein than curiosity:<br />
<br />
Since you consider your class fun, you know what is fun. I have never played a &quot;fun&quot; class, only my Cleric from day one.<br />
<br />
SO...the question is, what would you do, if you had the power, to make the cleric class a fun class to play?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">buzweaver</div><div class="date">08-03-2003, 07:42 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">A Bard can be a very laboring Character, but once you get the grove down (sometimes it takes a little longer to get in the grove) it’s a great Character to play. My on going joke is when I see Melee types run in circles or simply start attacking neighboring fodder MOBs, I suggest they should play a Bard, that will keep them &quot;constructively&quot; busy.<br />
<br />
A Shaman can be just as laboring as a Bard, sit mem, buff, re mem, Haste, Slow, Can, Med, Regen, by the time you're done its time to buff again. Sometimes it can be a vicious circle of managing Buffs, Mana, Slows and on top of that, they may even want you to heal. If any Character in the Game clearly needs KEI, it’s a Shaman.<br />
<br />
A Pally is a tank that can cast spells, spells that are actually useful and practical.  Not to mention get pretty decent buffs, they can heal and dish out some damage while taking a good deal of damage. Very good Character for those that like the ability to cast and tank as well as gets to shoot a bow. I’ve not played a Beast Lord but I would image they would have the same qualities as a Pally, with the benefit of a Pet too boot.<br />
<br />
A Warrior is a low maintenance character, after leveling there isn’t any concern for getting Spell/Song/Instrument Skill ups. When I level my Chars I work on all their abilities out side of those that are only raised in combat. I have a Froglok Warrior so the only thing I have to work on after he levels is Sense Heading and Bind wounds. I don’t even have to worry about raising his Swimming till he’s 24.</div></div><hr />

Maybe the lesson a game designer should take from that is to avoid that sort of narrowness in character design.</div></div><hr />

Warrior<br />

I play my cleric for preference.  Cleric was an awesomely boring class during the Velious and SoL expansions, but PoP and later content has really fixed that by adding critters that hit hard enough to make healing a challenge, undead-focused content (Veksar and Chardok B), and changes to certain spells (particularly the Lull line) which made clerics viable pullers and crowd controllers.<br />
<br />
Given a marginally better way to solo than root rotting critters in HoH for like 15% of an AA per hour, cleric would be a perfectly balanced class, at least from my point of view.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Aldane</div><div class="date">08-04-2003, 01:49 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">At the risk of incurring the wrath of fellow druids, here is my list of Top 5 fun classes:<br />
<br />
1) Necromancer. I know, I know...my main IS Aldane, a druid, but I have simply become fascinated with my necro. Aldane is fun to play and powerful, but I fear that my necro, at every level I played him, seems more powerful than my druid....not to mention more fun! Perhaps the thing I like most about my necro, aside from the diverse abilities and spells, is having a very nice pet that I don't have to worry about turning on me at random intervals. If Booboo were even nearly comparable, the number one slot would likely be a tie between necromancer and druid, but until the bear pet is elevated beyond &quot;toy&quot; status, I will have to lean toward necromancer as a more enjoyable class. /em ducks from the barrage of @#%$ fruit lobbed at his head.<br />
<br />
[EDIT: Just curious...since when is the word &quot;r-o-t-t-e-n&quot; considered dirty enough to get the &quot;@#%$&quot; treatment by the naughty word filter?!? lol]<br />
<br />
2) Druid. I really, REALLY wish I could put my main class at numero uno, but number two ain't so bad. I love my druid's versatility, but I don't want to be a main healer, a role I find myself in more and more. Aldane is evocation specialized, a human follower of Karana, raining death and destruction down upon those who defy and desecrate nature. However, it seems like SOE keeps trying to turn him, and all other druids like him, into a loving, cuddy, heal-happy Tunare-worshipper. Still, my druid is a blast to play, just not the &quot;most fun&quot; these days.<br />
<br />
3) Shadowknight. My first character in this game was a warrior named Terlas. I like playing melee characters, and came to EQ from pen-and-paper games thinking that a warrior would be the master of armed combat, dishing out massive amounts of damage. Of course, I was as wrong as could be, and looked for alternatives to my warrior. I started a shadowknight, and it didn't take long for me to be drawn in by just how fun and interesting the class was. I still have a sentimental attachment to Terlas, but my shadowknight just rocks.<br />
<br />
4) Magician. I simply have a fondness for pet classes. I especially have a fondness for pet classes that can summon focus effect items for themselves. I have even more fondness for a class that can summon all sorts of weird, situationally useful items with a wave of the hand.<br />
<br />
5) Tie: Ranger/wizard. I really can't choose between the two. I love my ranger, as being able to melee decently and cast sow and snare is very nice, and I miss track badly when not playing my ranger or druid. However, I also enjoy my wizard, despite how monotonous his abilities might seem to some people. Being a highly mobile piece of heavy artillery can be more fun than many people would expect.<br />
<br />
In closing, I have yet to play a class that I thought was outright boring to play, and the only two classes I haven't played yet are bard and beastlord, so I don't mean to imply by their exclusion that other classes aren't interesting to play. In fact, as I spend more time playing my alts, the rankings and maybe even the classes in my top five might change. :)    <br />

<br />
but like i said it all depends on what you like to do. if all you want to do is be lazy then start a cleric and sit there heal and buff. if you want to be in the action start a war and smash mobs. but most of all if oyu want to be really cool be a druid.<br />

btw, r.o.t.t.e.n is blocked because some jackoffs from one of those PvP servers occasionally post a link to some NASTY website w/ the &quot;R&quot; word in the URL.. I've accidently clicked on one of those links before, and am glad the &quot;R&quot; word is blocked :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Rheims</div><div class="date">08-04-2003, 08:34 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">In my experience, the druid is very fun from 1 to 45 or so, you are both useful in a group and can solo decently. Then it gets boring from about 45 to 60, when you start to notice groups don't really want you much anymore. Then after around 60 and potg, better heals and such it gets fun again just like when you were lower level, or even better.  But the 50s are tough, around mid 50s a lot of druids give up, having felt a large decline in relative usefulness just as other classes are coming into their own.<br />
<br />
Shamans are fun if you like feeling useful but they don't solo half as well as non shamans imagine that they do.  My experience with my 59 shaman is of painfully slow soloing but getting fast exp in groups because I make the group much more efficient by my presence.<br />
<br />
Rogues are fun, putting out massive dps is a rush, and if you are decently equipped you can tank in a pinch if needed.  A lot of druids make rogues, I think it's because rogues don't get hit and rogues get to explore, two things that druids like about the druid class.<br />
<br />
The hands down most boring class is warrior. They just have been left to rot by Sony for years now, while every other class gets a regular package of presents and upgrades.  It's almost a crime.</div></div><hr />
