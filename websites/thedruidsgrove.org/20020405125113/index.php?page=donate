<b>Background Information:</b>  The Druids Grove is currently hosted on a server that I donate my time to help out.  <a href="http://www.netpets.org" target=_blank>NetPets.Org</a>
was started about 5 or 6 years ago to help out pet lovers.  I have been with them for over three years now doing programming and system administration.  I 
have seen money at times, but recently the funding has dried up and the server is in desperate need of an upgrade.  Currently, Sobe and I
have it so that hosting the website is completely free.  Which got me in slight problem since NetPets members are supposed to make
a tax deductable donation.
<br><br>
	Since the attack on September 11th NetPets has been helping the armed forces by finding temporary homes (usually foster homes)
for servicemen to leave there pets while away from home (<a href="http://www.netpets.org/netp/foster.php" target=_blank>Military Foster Program</a>).  It has been a great success and is extremely popular with the military.  But, and here is the
important part, very little money has come in to help fund the time and effort.			
</blockquote></blockquote>
	
<br><br>
So now you have an idea of who NetPets is.  Now I have a request for all the druids and non-druids out there alike.  NetPets needs funding to keep up.
As it currently stand the mysql database behind the druids grove will fill up the hard drive within a couple weeks.  It is quite cool though to see the traffic we are getting to the site (nearly 1000 hits per day).  
I ask that we can all donate a little or a lot to this cause.  NetPets is an actual non-profit organization (<a href="http://www.netpets.org/mission.html" target=_blank>NetPets Mission</a>)
 that will give tax deductable recipts for each donation.	
<br><br>
In order to donate to NetPets.Org, please click the link below and fill out the form.  If you do not wish to donate with credit card, please email me and I will work some
other way out with NetPets to get your donation.  <u>In the company name field please put " Druid - chracter name ", ie. Druid - Tweil Firestorm.</u>  Also, make sure you
enter a valid email address.  At a later time (not too far down the road) I will have special things for people who donate.  One of which will be 
free picture hosting (for a year, 2-5mb limit) with a minumum donation of $25.00.  I will also start a sticky thread listing all those druids who helped out.
<br><br>
Do not forget, this is an actual Tax Donation, so include your correct information for the rest of the fields.				
<br><br><br>	
Thank you all,<br>
