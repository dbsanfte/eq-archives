<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>BricSummerthorne</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">It's sort of taken for granted that SCM1-3 are the first Archetype abilities we should get. Based on the comments of a Mage friend, I looked more closely at MC, and to my surprise found that &lt;strong&gt;MC can be a better initial purchase&lt;/strong&gt;, depending on your gear.<br />
<br />
For example, I have 2933 mana, and FT1. I usually play with only PoTC on. What's the better purchase?<br />
<br />
Assume that I spend all that time on a horse. My effective mana regen is then 27.7 mana/tic. Add that to my mana pool, and I have 52,793 mana available in 3 hours. Using all this mana, my SCM savings are as follows:<br />
<br />
SCM1 (2% ) 1,055<br />
SCM2 (5% ) 2,640<br />
SCM3 (10%) 5,279<br />
<br />
In 3 hours (1800 tics), MC returns the following amount of mana:<br />
<br />
MC1: 1,800<br />
MC2: 3,600<br />
MC3: 5,400<br />
<br />
Note that at every level, MC is a better purchase for me. Note that SCM has two further disadvantages:<br />
<br />
If I am not medding 100% of the time, my regen rate is less, and I save less.<br />
If I am not OOM at the end of the 3 hours, I save less.<br />
<br />
As a more realistic example, assume I am medding 3/4 of the time, and maintaining 3m. That's 21.3 per tic, and I have 39,213 total mana to spend. SCM breaks down like this:<br />
<br />
SCM1 (2% ) 784 saved<br />
SCM2 (5% ) 1,961 saved<br />
SCM3 (10%) 3,921 saved<br />
<br />
It's not even close.<br />
<br />
Two final points. MC is time-based, and SCM is mana-based. For occasions when you use lots of mana in a short time span, SCM performs better than my example, since MC requires time to work to full effect. Also, as your manapool and regen increase, SCM performs better yet, since there is a larger amount of mana to base savings on.<br />
<br />
A well-geared Druid who is usually raid-buffed would almost certainly get more bang out of SCM. In the long run, it's a worthwhile purchase for all of us. However, you need to look at YOUR gear, to decide which is better to buy first.<br />
<br />
I went the SCM1, SCM2, SCM3 route, and I wish *I* had done a little more research.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Tudamorf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Your analysis is flawed because you're not considering the effect of specialization, which also affects the rate at which you can cast a spell.  It's better to just analyze the amount of time it takes to recover the mana from casting a single spell.<br />
<br />
Example:  you cast your level 59 Wildfire, and you are specialized in Evocation.  Your regular mana cost for the spell is 285 after Specialization (11% savings).  Your mana cost after SCM3 is 253 (21% savings).  Let's also take your 27.7 mana/tick figure.<br />
<br />
Without SCM3, you can cast Wildfire once every 10.3 ticks on average.<br />
With SCM3, you can cast Wildfire once every 9.1 ticks on average.<br />
Without SCM3 but with MC3, you can cast Wildfire once every 9.3 ticks on average.<br />
<br />
So SCM3 is slightly better than MC3, using your mana regen figure.<br />
<br />
Now consider that very soon, you will be a level 65 druid, with, say, ornate gloves, around FT5, casting Summer's Flame.  Your mana regen will be about 35 mana per tick.  Without SCM3, you will be able to cast Summer's Flame about every 8.0 ticks.  With SCM3, you will be able to cast Summer's Flame about every 7.0 ticks.  Without SCM3 but with MC3, you will be able to cast Summer's Flame about every 7.4 ticks.  SCM3 is a clear winner here.<br />
<br />
Note that I'm not even considering in either of these scenarios that you will have mana regen (KEI, VoQ, Spiritual Purity, bard song, etc.) -- something you will likely have in a group, thereby skewing the results even further.<br />
<br />
Given that, you'd be better off dumping your points into SCM3 and enjoying the gift that keeps on giving.  You may also experience fewer fizzles with SCM3.  Then, when you get the points, go for MC3 to round out your character.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Tatankawd</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Your other bad assumption is considering a horse as FT20 &gt; over a three hour period &lt;<br />
<br />
Yes, it's FT20 for any tick you are not moving, but we all move sometimes.  Depending on what you're doing, sometimes it might be as low as an FT4 or 5 equivalent.<br />
<br />
And SCM works indoors, where your horse is worth FT0.<br />
<br />
Doing a similar calculation as you did, but with these assumptions, I figured my optimal path was SCM1, MC1, SCM2, SCM3 (and that's the order I did them).  This has the added effect of not making you do any 4 point AAs until after you've spent 10 points.  When you XP slowly like me, a 6 point AA is painful (but so far, SCM3 and Exodus were worth the pain =)<br />
<br />
Tat</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>BricSummerthorne</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I see where you're coming from Tuda, and your numbers add up. For your specializaton, SCM3 saves you 10% of the base cost. Since the spell is casting at 89% base cost, SCM3 is essentially saving you 11.2% if the &lt;em&gt;actual&lt;/em&gt; cost. I didn't factor that in, and it would certainly make a difference.<br />
<br />
However, my real-world figure is closer to 21.3 per tic (solo), per my second example. If I were evoc-spec, your example would look like:<br />
<br />
Without SCM3, I can cast Wildfire once every 13.3 ticks on average.<br />
With SCM3, I can cast Wildfire once every 11.9 ticks on average.<br />
Without SCM3 but with MC3, I can cast Wildfire once every 11.7 ticks on average.<br />
<br />
Since I am an alter spec, I don't get the full 11%. Assuming 2.5% savings on my non-spec spells, my regular cost after Specialization is 312. My mana cost after SCM3 is 280 (12.5% savings).<br />
<br />
Without SCM3, I can cast unspecced Wildfire once every 14.6 ticks on average.<br />
With SCM3, I can cast unspecced Wildfire once every 13.1 ticks on average.<br />
Without SCM3 but with MC3, I can cast unspecced Wildfire once every 12.8 ticks on average.<br />
<br />
Unspecced spells (for me) include PoTC, Damage Shields, Glamor of Tunare, Wildfire, Winged Death, and Invis, so it's a significant consideration.<br />
<br />
I grant you that in a group I will have Horse, Cabbage, KEI and Kitty crack. I rarely went low mana in that sort of situation (even before SCM), so I personally don't feel I needed to boost that area right away.<br />
<br />
When I am pulling solo, get an add, and a raven breaks charm, that's where I want the boost. That's when I am most likely to go OOM.<br />
<br />
The point of my post was that SCM3 isn't universally better than MC3 in the short run. It all depends on your playstyle and goals. Especially for those first few AA's, you want the most bang for your buck. Looking back, I would have been better served by MC3, just because of how I play and what I want to do.<br />
<br />
Eventually, SCM3 is a must for anyone. I simply wanted to point out that the first AA's you need might NOT be SCM, you can't just take it on faith. You have to look at how it affects &lt;em&gt;you&lt;/em&gt;.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>BricSummerthorne</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Tat, I just used 20/tic horse as a best case for SCM. Note that my real-world example involves medding 3/4 of the time (which is still probably high).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Quelm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Buy KEI  :evil: <br />
<br />
27.7 becomes 41.7, <br />
<br />
using the rest of your first parameters,<br />
1559 saved with SCM1<br />
3899 saved with SCM2<br />
7799 saved with SCM3<br />
<br />
MCs main drawback is the way it scales - 2 AA for 1 mana/tick, 4 more AA for 1 more mana/tick, and 6 more AA for the final 1 mana/tick.  MC1 is good, but it means you'll pick up SCM3 that much later.  If you're looking to spend only 12 points in arch abilities to unlock Exodus, Innate Camo, MGB, I still think SCM3 is the way to go.<br />
<br />
With SCM, mana you save can be spent, providing more savings, which can be spent, providing more savings...  111% of 5279 is 5859, a closer approximation of the amount of mana you'd theoretically save (at 27.7 mana/tick, 2933 starting mana, 3 hours, OOM at the end)  There's no similar compounding effect with MC.  As Tudamorf pointed out, actual mana savings are going to be higher in practice than in your example.  Spec:Evo + a mana pres 3 item puts you at 16.5% savings on nukes before considering the benefits of SCM.  Spec:Alt saves you 11% on Tunare's Renewal, you can add MP3 for another 5.5% on regens, and you're still saving 8.5% on your nukes.  Add in Affliction Efficiency, Summer's Anger, Focus of Mithaniel and your conservation numbers are higher in some areas.<br />
<br />
The result is more spells cast than (manaregen*time + base mana) would indicate.  SCM saves mana with every cast, while MC is strictly a function of time.  If you consider additional conservation effects, your SCM numbers will be higher, while your MC numbers will stay the same.<br />
<br />
At 28 mana / tick, it is very close, but SCM3 &gt; MC3.  If you're soloing, again, I strongly suggest buying KEI, but some folks prefer to play without it.  If you're regularly in groups with no enchanter, no bard, no beastlord, no (62?) SK, no necro, my condolences!  The additional manaregen they provide is enjoyable and it further tips the scale towards SCM.<br />
<br />
no regrets!  ;)</div></div><hr />

<br />
That first scenario described is exactly why I went for SCM before MC.  SCM shines in high-mana use situations - a couple roots, a (resisted) charm, another root, a heal, snare, recharm can cost you over 1k mana in under a minute.  SCM3 saves at least 100, MC3 provides at most 30.<br />
<br />
It depends, I agree.  Playstyle, goals, gear, groupmates vary from one player to the next.  I just have trouble seeing MC3 as an efficient choice for a 59 druid, when for less xp, you can pick up level 60, find mask of the hunter/stalker for 3 extra mana / tick, and enjoy the rest of the benefits of the level.  Clearly, some people enjoy playing at their own pace, staying within range of friends, avoiding the powergaming scene and such, but if you're counting and comparing mana saved and regenerated in an attempt to maximize your return on time invested in xp, why not just get 60?  :) <br />

That's a good point.  I compared MC3 to SCM3, but I can see how MC1 might be a good buy for level 59 druid.  In my Wildfire example, MC1 gives you a 9.9 tick/cast delay, whereas SCM1 gives you a 10.1 tick/cast delay, making MC1 at least temporarily superior.<br />
<br />
As you go down the line, however, MC becomes increasingly unattractive because it gives you diminishing returns (in terms of bang for your AA buck), whereas SCM gives you constant returns.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>AmonraSet</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">There are also other benefits to SCM in that for short bursts, such as raiding or heavy fighting it still provides the same 10% mana reduction to spells cast for your whole mana pool (e.g. equivalent to about 600 extra mana with a 5000 mana pool).  MC3 on the other hand will provide a very limited benefit, of only 150 mana if the fight is 5 minutes long.  These situations also tend to be when you most need every bit of mana you can get to keep people alive, rather than during the normal course of events where a little more mana simply translates into a little more damage.<br />
<br />
Soloing can also be similar to long fights if you tend to burn your mana during the fight, and then med up afterwards.  SCM could be the difference between just killing a mob(s) and not, whereas MC will mostly tend to reduce downtime a little.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>iegil</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I find myself wondering what the &quot;actual&quot; affect of Spell And given the figures shown, it really makes SCF look more appealing.  <br />
<br />
Wildfire<br />
320 mana base price<br />
285 specialization evocation price<br />
270 Mana preservation 3 price ( 5 percent savings average)<br />

Assuming a 7 percent chance of a crit (double damage) it appears to be a free nuke 7 percent of the time.<br />

2 ticks casting time for wildfire  (worst case)<br />
<br />
so doing the math<br />
<br />
270 mana * 0.07 chance of crit / 2 ticks = FT9 for chain nuking foolios.<br />

Much better DPS/Mana than either of the shown examples.<br />

I'm not a proponent of SCF3 first as its a very one dimensional view and skewing of the numbers to prove a point.<br />

I'd still recommend after buying all the archetype AA's going with SCM3 first.  It made the largest impact with my manapool.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>BricSummerthorne</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">&lt;strong&gt;With SCM, mana you save can be spent, providing more savings, which can be spent, providing more savings.&lt;/strong&gt;<br />
<br />
That's a great point. There's sort of a &quot;compound interest&quot; on SCM savings. I was looking at SCM3 in isolation, and that's not possible (as you and Tuda have pointed out). However, even taking that into account, I believe I can make a case for MC.<br />
<br />
Since it's relevant, I will mention that I have an MP3 neck item. I ignored it's effect before, but it's obviously going to be a factor. So, let me reword the numbers from my original post.<br />
<br />
I am using my &quot;real world&quot; figure of 39,213 mana regenned over 3 hours. This assumes that I am medding 3/4 of the time and holding at 3m. This is much more in line with the amount of movement I do while charming.<br />
<br />
As Quelm pointed out, there are savings on the savings on the savings. Casting a spec spell, I can expect a base 21% savings (10% MP + 11% spec). So I save:<br />
<br />
8234 on 39,213<br />
1729 on 8234<br />
363 on 1729<br />
<br />
etc.<br />
<br />
It works out to 10,423 mana saved on the original 39,213. Wow.<br />
<br />
With SCM1, I am saving 23%. Using the same &quot;compound interest&quot; calculation, the total savings is 11,712 mana on the original 39,213. The effect of SCM1 is therefore 1,289 mana.<br />
<br />
With MC1 I am adding 1800 mana to my total. So &lt;strong&gt;with&lt;/strong&gt; MC1 and &lt;strong&gt;without&lt;/strong&gt; SCM, I am saving 21% on 41,013 mana. That works out to:<br />
<br />
8612 on 41,013<br />
1808 on 8612<br />
<br />
etc.<br />
<br />
The total savings is 10,902 on 41,013 mana. This is less than SCM, obviously, but I have saved mana and GAINED mana. Adding in the regen, the effect of MC1 is therefore 2287 mana (478 savings + 1800 regen).<br />
<br />
The following table evaluates all the options, based on the preceding calculations:<br />
<br />
SCM vs MC @ 39,213 mana/3 hours<br />

SCM3    7193         3839          640<br />
<br />
<br />
In my case, the optimal purchase order would have been MC1 (1139), SCM1 (644), MC2 (569), then SCM2 (516) and SCM3 (640).<br />
<br />
Now, to be fair, I'll look at a case where I am main healer (100% horse, KEI + PoTC). That's 75,060 mana over 3 hours.<br />

SCM1    2467         2467          1233<br />
SCM2    6419         3951          987<br />
SCM3  13,789         7349          1225<br />
<br />
In this case, SCM is the clear winner. The optimal purchase order is SCM1 (1233), MC1 (1139), SCM2 (987), SCM3 (1225). Interestingly enough, that's the path Tatanka took.<br />
<br />
Bear in mind, I completely agree that SCM is mandatory at some point. But the common wisdom - at least as I understand it - is that SCM rocks and MC is sorta crappy. This is true *eventually*. Some playstyles may benefit more from an initial investment in MC.<br />
<br />
i.e., gimps like myself :)   <br />
<br />
On another note, SCM is a lot more complex than I gave it credit for. Thanks Tuda and Quelm, I certainly learned something.<br />
<br />
&lt;em&gt;edit: wait..MP3 excludes CH...which is sort of the point of Alter spec...oh, my head&lt;/em&gt;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>TeriMoon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Bric opened a can o' worms.<br />
<br />
I think that really the point is this:<br />
<br />
SCM3 is much more valuable than MC3.  Much.  Therefore, it may be wiser to go straight for the gold, putting all points immediately into this gem of an AA skill, rather than fussing about with MC which will only yield similar benefits for that short period before you obtain SCM3.  <br />
<br />
Having SMC3 makes it easier to obtain AA, making it easier then for you to get MC1.  Then you have good things on both sides of the argument.<br />
<br />
Its similar to the argument of levels vs AAs.  I think we all have seen that unless you have social reasons to remain at lower level, you are more powerful if you level to 65 before obtaining the majority of your AAs.  Similarly, you have a more stable mana pool with SCM3 than you will getting MC3. Therefore it makes more sense to concentrate efforts in this area first. There may be a time in the life of any character when MC1 is more useful than SCM1, but how big of a wondow are we speaking of here?  In terms of time played, I think you are better off making any short term sacrifice there might be and just going for SCM3.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>BricSummerthorne</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">&lt;strong&gt;There may be a time in the life of any character when MC1 is more useful than SCM1, but how big of a wondow are we speaking of here?&lt;/strong&gt;<br />
<br />
Hmm, maybe that's the central question.<br />
<br />
I've had SCM2 for several weeks, and SCM1 for almost 2 months. I doubt I will see SCM3 anytime in the next 5-8 weeks. In the same vein, lvl 65 is feasible for me sometime early next year. It all depends on the attendance/consistency/gear of guild tanks and shamans.<br />
<br />
I plan to do as many AA's as possible at 60, because I can still solo effectively there. Fennin is an old, crowded server, and getting frogs to kill is something that happens to other people. :)   Not that I'm in any rush.<br />
<br />
For me, each AA is important. I bought SCM in perfect confidence that it was the right choice, at the time. I was sort of surprised to see that MC1 would have been a better choice. It won't matter in the long run, as you say. But a 3 month window of slightly better performance was worth doing some research for, as opposed to reading a guide and nodding my head.<br />
<br />
Any worms were entirely unintended :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>TeriMoon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">good lord, I wish I would remember to use spell check.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Tatankawd</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">&quot;As Quelm pointed out, there are savings on the savings on the savings. Casting a spec spell, I can expect a base 21% savings (10% MP + 11% spec)&quot;<br />
<br />
Actually, MP saves you from 1-10%, so that's why previous posters were using 5.5% for MP (the average savings).<br />
<br />
Also, Tuda hit on a good point, that you kind of alluded to also:<br />
<br />
&quot;For me, each AA is important. I bought SCM in perfect confidence that it was the right choice, at the time. I was sort of surprised to see that MC1 would have been a better choice&quot;<br />
<br />
That's what I referred to in my first post.  That's why I got MC1 right after SCM1 and before SCM2.  You can't compare MC3 directly with SCM3, unless you are banking 18AAs to buy all three levels at once.  And you also have to look at the benefit gained by a skill in reference to how many AAs the skill costs.  MC scales HORRIBLY.  You gain 600 mana per hour per level of MC, assuming you are never FM.  But MC3 costs 3 times as much as MC1, making it 1/3 of the &quot;value&quot; of MC1.<br />
<br />
SCM1 saves you 2% of base mana cost for 2AA, so 1% saved/AA<br />
SCM2 saves you 3% of base mana cost for 4AA, so 0.75% saved/AA<br />
SCM3 saves you 5% of base mana cost for 6AA, so 0.84% saved/AA<br />
<br />
You can make a very good case that MC1 is as good as, or a slightly better value than, SCM1.  But no way is MC2 a better value than SCM1, because it costs twice as much.  Conversely, you can make a very good case that MC1 is a better value than SCM2.  That's why I did SCM1, MC1, then SCM2 &amp; 3.  I wasn't in as big of a hurry to get to class AAs (although I did get Exodus right after SCM3, it was worth waiting 2AAs to get it).<br />
<br />
Even if you thought MC1 was &quot;worth&quot; 50% more than SCM1, that would make MC2 only worth 75% of SCM1, so equal to SCM2, and a little less valuable than SCM3.  To do MC3 before SCM1, you would have to believe that MC1 was at least 3 times more valuable than SCM1.<br />

Interestingly, someone mentioned SCF.  That skill scales VERY nicely:<br />
<br />
SCF1 gives +33% dmg, 2% of the time = 0.66% dmg / 2AA = 0.33%/AA<br />
SCF2 gives +66% dmg, 5% of the time = 2.66% dmg (additional over SCF1) / 4AA = 0.665%/AA (over twice the value of SCF1)<br />
SCF3 gives +100% dmg, 7% of the time = 3.66% dmg (over SCF2) / 6AA = 0.61%/AA (about the same as SCF2).<br />
<br />
And for the related PoP skill (FOM):<br />
FoM1 gives +2% total dmg over SCF3, for 3 AA = 0.66%/AA, right in line with SCF2 and 3.<br />

That skill scales VERY nicely[/quote]Your post suggests another interesting question:  whether SCF is a good alternative to MC or SCM for a nuke-happy, XP-frugal druid.  SCF gives you the following average damage over time increase:<br />
<br />
SCF1 gives an increase of 0.66% [0.33% per AA]<br />
SCF2 gives an increase of 3.30% [0.66% per AA]<br />
SCF3 gives an increase of 7.00% [0.62% per AA]<br />
<br />
(Caclulation:  I = 1+K*P, where I = increase, K = damage modifier, P = probability of critical.)<br />
<br />
SCM also gives you a form of damage over time increase, because it allows you to nuke more with the same amount of mana.<br />
<br />
SCM1 gives an increase of 2.0% [1.00% per AA]<br />
SCM2 gives an increase of 5.3% [0.83% per AA]<br />
SCM3 gives an increase of 11.1% [0.97% per AA]<br />
<br />
(Calculation:  1/(1-K), where K = percentage mana savings.)<br />
<br />
Now let's look at MC.  Assume the lead poster's situation, 28 mana per tick.<br />
<br />
MC1 gives an increase of 3.57% [1.79% per AA]<br />
MC2 gives an increase of 7.14% [0.89% per AA]<br />
MC3 gives an increase of 10.71% [0.60% per AA]<br />
<br />
(Calculation:  (28+K)/28, where K = added mana regen per tick.)<br />
<br />
Notice that by considering only the percentage damage increase and not absolutes, a number of extraneous variables drop out (spell used, specialization, other mana savings items, level, etc.), making this analysis useful for druids in various stages of development.  Also notice how SCM is the only skill that scales linearly per AA point, something SoE should look into fixing.<br />
<br />
So in terms of bang for the AA buck for the lead poster, considering only the effect of average added nuke power:<br />
<br />
1) MC1 is the clear winner with a staggering 1.79% damage per AA point.<br />
2) SCM1 with 1.00%.<br />
3) MC2 with 0.89%.<br />
4) SCM2 with 0.83%.<br />
5) SCM3 with 0.97%.<br />
<br />
For 6th place, SCF2 is better than MC3, but since it has the last-place SCF1 as a prerequisite, we should consider them as a single unit:  SCF1 + SCF2 = 0.55% per AA.  So MC3 is the winner for 6th place.  After finishing off SCM3 and MC3, the druid should move to SCF1, 2, and 3.<br />
<br />
Another viewpoint is that SCM2 + SCM3 should go in third place and MC2 in fourth, because when considered together, SCM2 + SCM3 offer 0.91% increase per AA point, whereas MC2 only offers 0.89%.  This would be logical for a druid who knows he is going to go for SCM3 soon anyway.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>L1ndara</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">&lt;strong&gt;Having SMC3 makes it easier to obtain AA, making it easier then for you to get MC1. Then you have good things on both sides of the argument.&lt;/strong&gt;<br />
 <br />
  Bric is in a special case though, FT1 and PotC means his mana regen is so low that MC1 can actually pay for itself.  Tatankawd's way of buying SCM and MC is pretty good.<br />
 <br />
  For druids that haven't gotten AA or many, I'd really recommend getting 65 first, you gain +2 mana/tick going from 60 to 65 anyway!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>AmonraSet</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Based on mana regeneration rates alone (i.e. not counting use of the mana pool which would favour SCM more), and assuming 11% specialisation saving, 5.5% MP3/4 saving on all spells gives the following paths based on basic mana regen:<br />
<br />
Under 19:  MC1, MC2, SCM1, SCM2, SCM3, MC3<br />
<br />
19-24:  MC1, SCM1, MC2, SCM2, SCM3, MC3<br />
<br />
25-40:  MC1, SCM1, SCM2, SCM3, MC2, MC3<br />
<br />
41-52:  SCM1, MC1, SCM2, SCM3, MC2, MC3<br />
<br />
52+:  SCM1, SCM2, SCM3, MC1, MC2, MC3<br />
<br />
I have also looked at non specialised spells saving only 2.5% mana, but the results change very little (the thresholds for changing route move by about 1 point of mana regen in each case).<br />
<br />
For shorter fights where the mana pool will actually be used (and then regeneration afterwards is in no hurry, such as when raiding), the results very much favour SCM1-3 followed by MC1-3.  This is because the mana pool becomes a very significant factor in mana usage and SCM will work for the whole mana pool whereas MC will not.<br />
<br />
So definitely if you don’t raid much and have low mana regeneration, there can be definite benefits by not going for the SCM1-3 route immediately.  Even for higher mana regen rates MC1 is a useful early buy if you don’t raid much.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>iegil</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">I like this last table posted.  It really reflects how your buffs and mana should determine the AA order.<br />
<br />
PoTC = 6 mana / tick<br />
Solstice Earring = 1 mana / tick<br />
Wolf form = 2 mana / tick<br />
KEI = 14 mana / tick<br />
<br />
Would have been my level 59 hunting buffs.<br />
Or 23 mana/tick for kiting<br />
<br />
or 21 mana/tick + horse for grouping outdoors<br />
<br />
or 21 mana/tick<br />
<br />
Seems a MC1 / SCM1 / SCM2 / SCM3 would be the most useful path.  Interestingly, this is the exact path I choose with absolutely no math.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>BricSummerthorne</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Amonra, that's an amazing chart. It expresses what I was getting at concisely, and minus the bad assumptions, hehe. The breakpoint at 52/tic surprises me, I consider that fairly high regen, even in a group. Also your point about burst mana usage (raiding) is well-taken.<br />

L1ndara, +2 mana/tic by levelling? Meditation cap?<br />

&lt;strong&gt;You can't compare MC3 directly with SCM3, unless you are banking 18AAs to buy all three levels at once.&lt;/strong&gt;<br />
<br />
Yes, exactly. It's a bunch of sub-choices, each of which may or may not be optimal.<br />
<br />
Some good math in this thread.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Exactly.  And just to add one comment to AmonRa's most excellent chart, you'll notice that MC3 is never worth getting before SCM3.  I think most people felt that in their guts, without doing the math, but the chart shows it very well.  And I think that realization (SCM3 &gt;&gt; MC3) led them to falsely think SCM1 &gt;&gt; MC1, whereas they are fairly comparable.<br />
<br />
Excellent thread!<br />
<br />
Oh yes, regarding Lindara's comment about +2 mana/tick at 65, I have asked several times, and nobody ever gives me a direct answer.  The best I have surmised is that you get 3/tick default mana regen while standing at 65, instead of the usual 1/tick.  I have never seen this documented by SOE, but several people have mentioned it, so I guess someone tested it somewhere.  So, assuming it's true, that leaves two questions for me: Is there a level where you get +1/tick (63 perhaps), or do you get both points at 65, and do you also get +2 while medding/sitting (so +23/tick instead of +21).  And re: your comment about the meditation cap, there are no skills I know of for any class that had their caps raised post-60, in PoP or any other expansion, so it's not based on any skill raise.  Similarly, you get more standing HP regen once you get in the upper 50s (60?), but it's not related to a skill gain either.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>iegil</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Bric, interesting you consider 50 a high mana regen.  It certainly is for a grouping, non-raid druid.<br />
<br />
Voice of Quellious  - 18<br />
Spiritual Dominion -    8<br />
Protection of the 9 -  8<br />
Mask of the Forest -  4<br />
Bardsong              - 18<br />
<br />
Without gear/AA's we are well into the 52+ (56) range for a raiding druid.  Adding in Mental Clarity and max Flowing Thought you get another 18 / tick. (74)<br />
<br />
When I can, and need a real kick in the mana regen, I click my horse on.  22/tick?  Sitting?  or around 96 mana / tick.<br />
<br />
That basically hits the top end of mana regen for a raiding druid in a decent sized guild.</div></div><hr />

  MacroQuest gives you exact mana numbers.  It's easy to test too if you have some time to burn.<br />
 <br />
&lt;strong&gt; So, assuming it's true, that leaves two questions for me: Is there a level where you get +1/tick (63 perhaps),&lt;/strong&gt;<br />

  I dunno, I'd guess +1 at 63.  I wasn't really paying attention at the time I was leveling and I haven't seen anyone mention it.    <br />
 <br />
&lt;strong&gt; or do you get both points at 65, and do you also get +2 while medding/sitting (so +23/tick instead of +21)&lt;/strong&gt;<br />
 <br />
  Medding stays at the same 19/tick.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I tested this a couple of months ago because I'd read it on message boards but never seen proof or an official statement.<br />
<br />
Basically I cast a spell that cost 300 mana (with no mana preservation item) - Valor of Marr, a 49th level paladin spell. I timed how long it took to get the mana back at 61, 62, 63, 64, and 65.<br />
<br />
What I found was an extra point of mana regeneration at 63 and then another gained at 65. Your hitpoint regeneration also goes up as you level, and at least that part is captured by Magelo.</div></div><hr />

It is NOT a &quot;chance&quot; to save mana.  Specs save you a fixed amount of mana on every cast.  It's been said about 5 billion times now.  Spec 50 save 3%, spec 200 saves 11%.<br />

how often are you oom, really?  and how often are you full mana, really?  odds are good you are one or the other a fair amount over 3 hours (which seems to be the timeframe at hand here) and if you are full mana, and not casting, or oom and not casting, this whole discussion is bunkis.<br />
