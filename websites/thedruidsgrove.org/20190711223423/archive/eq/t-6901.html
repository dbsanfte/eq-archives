<br />
Yeah we did, but that's why this is the &quot;off topic&quot; forum, right?<br />
<br />
I left work early today and finished weeding the front yard. Preen is your friend!<br />
<br />
I spent 1 hour last weekend pulling those stupid burr clovers.  They are so tangled that the only way to do it is roll them up, like a sleeping bag.  Anyway, it was REALLY hard work.  I was so sore the next two days!   Granted, I'm not in the best of shape at the moment, but omg!  I could hardly walk.  However, that hour resulted in a rather large patch of them gone!<br />
<br />
This weekend I'm going to invest millions of dollars in pre-emergent and take it up onto the slope from hell and use it as I weed.<br />
<br />
The good news is, my financial situation seems to be improving so I could possibly spring for the money to have someone else do this.  However I don't trust other people to pull the right things out!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jinjre</div><div class="date">03-05-2004, 03:20 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I don't trust other people either, and I definitely feel your pain.  We've spread one unit (7.5 cubic yards) of bark dust already, and I'm awaiting the delivery of another half unit to finish the job.  At least the weeding is finito for the time being.  And yeah, the Preen went down before the barkdust did.<br />
<br />
I'm a hurtin' unit right now.  I think we've put over 40 hours into weeding/chemicalling/barkdusting so far.  I wouldn't be in such a hurry, except that 1. I have a leg surgery in 2 weeks so it needs to be done while I&quot;m still mobile and 2. spring is coming early and a lot of the little plants that die off each winter and come back each spring are starting to sprout, so I wanted the mulch down while I could still mulch over them instead of having to mulch around them.<br />
<br />
As for Iagoe, what he said is true.  He hates yard work with a passion and would rather play ANY game, yes, even skifree, rather than work in the yard.  As he said yesterday &quot;Well, at least it isn't raining.....hard.&quot;  10 minutes later it started pouring.  I actually own 2 of those really ugly rubberized canvas heavy duty yellow rain suits.  I look like a dork, but I'm a dry dork.<br />
<br />
Last time I hired someone to do yardwork for me they:  broke through our tv/internet cable line, broke 3 sprinkler heads, killed 2 bushes completely, didn't actually get the ivy out (I'm still pulling ivy), 'weeded' with a hoe (doing nothing more than stimulating root growth of the weeds) and killed a good bit of my groundcover with aggressive raking.  This year everything we did we did ourselves...moving plants, weeding, barkdust the whole shebang.  At least the bark dust should last a few years as I made sure it was put on thick and not &quot;blown in&quot; (read: just enough to be visible, but not enough to actually mulch).<br />
<br />
One patch had Bishops Weed in it, which is a horrendously prolific groundcover, which both seeds and runners.  I put down casaron, then I put down Preen, then I put down mulch.  I dare it to make a comeback from that!</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jinjre</div><div class="date">03-05-2004, 09:16 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Casaron is a granule, looks a lot like Preen, except it isn't a pre-emergent, it's a &quot;kill anything with non-woody growth near the ground&quot;.  It essentially kills anything that sprouts or anything that isn't a bush/shrub/tree.  It's great for things like gravel driveways (it's a growth hormone blocker), rosebeds or any other place where all you have is woody things.<br />
<br />
It will run off if you put it on a slope, and kill whatever it happens to run off into.  (Found that out the hard way) <br />
<br />
Basically, if you don't want anything growing in that spot for, oh, 4 to 5 years or so, it's the stuff to use.  The bed I had the Bishops Weed in happens to also have a HUGE hydrangea in it, so I don't care much about the area around it looking &quot;bare&quot;.</div></div><hr />

But I got about 1/16th of it done!  /cry  <br />
<br />
I think I'll take up your husbands idea of a good fireball!  <br />
<br />
It was really hot here this weekend so I couldn't even start until the sun got off the slope.  Probably just as well because its physically intense labor and I can only take about 1.5 hours of it before my legs feel like rubber and my back is aching.  I just wish I could work on it during the week so I could get it over with.  But the sun is gone by the time I get home. :\<br />
<br />
So I have to start getting up at the crack of dawn in order to pull weeds!  Argh!</div></div><hr />

Our spring cleanup is finally done, I think total hours put into it was around (counts on fingers) 80 man hours of labor.  But my leg surgery is only one weekend away, and by the time I'm all recovered, it would have been oh so much worse.<br />
<br />
Good luck to you on the weeding &gt;&lt;  Clover stinks to pull out.  It sounds like a HUGE slope.  Ever think of putting something on it that suppresses weeds?  Not sure what part of the world you live in, but St Augustine grass is great for choking weeds out if the slope is slight enough to be mowable.  If not, there are some great creeping junipers that choke out weeds pretty nicely.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Panamah</div><div class="date">03-08-2004, 11:04 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The slope is definitely not mowable!  It's hard just getting to the top of it.  <br />
<br />
I've tried getting various types of ice plant started, creeping thyme, creeping oregano, ivy geraniums, lantana and a multitude of other things going.  I have mixed luck on it.   I do have some big patches where something took off, but other patches that are bare still.  If I can get the creeping oregano to take off I think it'd be super.  I have a nice large patch of it in the front.  Makes a very pretty ground cover.<br />
<br />
I'm thinking maybe some low growing chamomile.  It gets ratty looking in the late summer but looks nice the rest of the year.  And it spreads very nicely and can take some foot traffic.  <br />
<br />
I've got a few fruit trees planted on my slope too.  They're a little hard to get to, but</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jinjre</div><div class="date">03-08-2004, 12:49 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Just FYI:  if you're going for a viney/runner type propagating groundcover, the Preen will actually prevent it from spreading (unless the runners spread underground like ivy does, but ivy doesn't suppress weeds very well).  Preen works as a root growth hormone inhibitor.  If you ever see a weed growing in an area where the preen is down, you'll notice that it can be raked up, and it will have very very stunted roots.  <br />
<br />
So essentially, by putting the Preen down, any runner type plant will have any roots it might want to throw down inhibited by the Preen too &gt;&lt;  <br />
<br />
Have you thought about a retaining wall (or series of them)?  Maybe a nice Aztec tiered garden?  Just tossing ideas about, thinking about what I'd do with a slope like that.  It sounds ghastly to work with.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Panamah</div><div class="date">03-08-2004, 03:08 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I thought Preen just kept the seeds from germinating, which is why I thought it was called &quot;pre-emergent&quot; because it keeps it from emerging from seed.  Hmmm... that's unfortunate if it does stop things from spreading.  I think I've used preen where my Chamomile grows and it still seems to be spreading.  Actually, it wasn't Preen, but another variety, but not sure if the active ingredient is the same or not.  <br />
<br />
Well, given the size and length of this slope terracing would be enormously expensive and labor intensive work.  There actually is about a 4-4.5&quot; wall most of the way around the bottom of the slope, then the slope goes up steeply from that.   I'll have to post a picture for you.<br />
<br />
Oh, here's from Preen's web site about how it works.  I'm not sure if this will be a problem for my root-spreading plants like the creeping Thyme.<br />
<br />
Preen prevents new weeds from growing, it does not kill existing weeds. Preen works by creating a chemical barrier in the top 1-2 inches of the soil that prevents cell division in developing weed seeds.</div></div><hr />

If it was my slope, I'd buy multiple varieties of creeping juniper, and a hedge trimmer.  Trim the junipers away from the trees, but let them take over everything else.  They'll tolerate your heat/drought, take almost no maintenance, and their droppings/mulch is a weed suppressant due to the high amount of tanins and lignins in their needles/bark.<br />

Well curing urinary tract infections and making gin is more than my current ground cover will do!  I'll definitely look into that.  I've seen some nice looking junipers at various places.<br />
<br />
I was also thinking of bouganvilla, which is utterly gorgeous.  I could plant it at the top of the slope where I never go... or at least where I never want to go.   The Juniper, or prostrate rosemary, might be just the thing for the west side slope which is particularly dry and nasty. <br />

Prior to the weedfest, you couldn't tell where the grass ended and the beds began, and you couldn't tell that the bushes hadn't leafed in yet.  Everything was a jumble of weeds including blackberry, ivy, some weird groundcover with lovely glass thorns on its underside, vinca, a weird little weed we get in the pac. NW which looks like a dandylion with thorns, a few more thorny things and some stuff which is sorta like clover only not.  (This is what happens when it rains a lot and you have decent soil....things grow....a LOT)<br />
<br />
Trust me, our yard hasn't looked this good since we moved into it.  I'm looking forward to having everything leaf in and see how it does.<br />
<br />
Out of curiosity, I thought bouganvilla was a climbing (as opposed to ground) kind of thing, like morning glory but not as aggressive.  I know it does really well in humid environments, not sure how it would do in your dry climate.  And I totally agree, it's a gorgeous plant (we don't have enough heat for it to grow here).</div></div><hr />

You can't turn a corner without seeing it growing has a hedge, a climber, a ground cover or shaped into a topiary (next doors neighbors have theirs growing in a pink heart shape).  I think we even have a variety called &quot;San Diego&quot;.  I don't think it needs humidity, just lots of sun.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I once lived in a rental house.  The owners house was about 15 feet from mine.  He got a hella deal on the property because it had been completely overtaken (like your pics-overtaken) by Blackberries.<br />
<br />
It took him 3 years, but he eventually got nearly all of them dead (he's probably still trying to kill the last of them, and I lived there 15 years ago).  In amongst it all he found:  the house I lived in, a boat house with a boat and trailer happily rusting away inside it, numerous bee hives, a sauna, a truck, the front end only of another truck, several old couches/chairs and more spiders than he ever wanted to see again.  He actually bought a beekeepers suit to do the initial stages of clearing.<br />

There's some absolutely horrid weed which tries to go wild in my yard, along with something my friend tells me is &quot;Creeping Charlie.&quot;  That and wild grapes trying to climb into my trees.<br />
<br />
I have to say, the best thing I love in my yard is the Tamarack tree.  The first fall I lived here, I thought I'd somehow managed to kill it when it went all yellow.  It was scary!  It's going to start greening up soon!<br />
<br />
So, here's a question: I have some burning bushes in the front yard, which are beginning to be WAY too big.  Can I cut them back now, or when should I even try?  (Or maybe I should just hire people!  YEAH!)</div></div><hr />

The ideal pruning time depends on your location.  If you still have snow on the ground, or the threat of a killing frost still exists, don't prune them yet.<br />
<br />
In Portland, the pruning season is valentine's day through st. paddys day.  If you're in the great lakes region or the interior, it'll be later than that.  <br />
<br />
Burning bushes (I have one in my yard, they're so pretty in the fall) can be pruned pretty far back as long as you don't prune the 'trunk' type branches.  The long thin branched can be taken back to 2-3 leaf nodules away from the main trunk (leaf nodules are those little bumps on the stems).<br />
<br />
Kudzu is really awful.  Unlike blackberries which are nearly impossible to kill, kudzu is just such a fast grower that once it gets started, you almost can't stop it.  (runner type spreading like most ivys))  Good thing we imported it from another continent huh?</div></div><hr />

I really like these bushes, and you're right, they're beautiful in fall!  But they've grown half again as big as they were when I moved in 4 or 5 years ago, and I don't want them to cause problems for the house.  They're also covering up more of the small juniper near them, which is a lovely plant, too.<br />

I've got probably half the weeds on my slope gone now, and a very sore back.  :p  I filled up two very large garbage cans with weeds, smooshed down and refilled several times.  I was using a cheap-o plastic laundry basket as my interim weed basket.  Get it full, then dump it into the trash.  One good sized burr clover weed takes up a surprising lot of room in that basket!  <br />
<br />
Now where the burr clover the out though, the sunlight starved grass weeds are starting to take off. /cry<br />

The good news is some of my ice plant filled out into nice large patches underneath that clover.  I can subdivide it and move it to empty spots.  Same with the baby rosemary. <br />

As for yard debris, our yard is really 3 sections.  We live on a flag lot (or pipestem lot, depending on what part of the country you live in), so our front yard is essentially another back yard.  Behind the fence of our true back yard is a strip of land which is city owned/right of way, but we're responsible for maintenance.  It's always the last part to get any attention because, hey, I can't see it through my fence.<br />
<br />
We've got 6x33 + 65 gallons of yard debris still from all the weeding.  Only half of the part behind our back fence is sorta done.  My leg surgery is this wednesday, and I'll be out of commission for a month at least.  My only hope is that the raking/weeding faery comes while I'm immobile and takes care of it for me.<br />
<br />
Last time I asked hubby to go rake/weed back there, I told him he could pull up anything that wasn't a tree (he's not very good at differentiating weed from plant I want to keep).  Unfortunately, that included large quantites of garbage from people driving by on the road who feel my property is a fine waste disposal site, and one dead rat.  Hubby isn't too happy about going back there after the dead rat thing, so I'm doubting the raking faery will come while I&quot;m off my feet.</div></div><hr />

I've also been wanting to reread The Mists of Avalon.  It's been a decade or so since I read it last, and it's not often I have 4 days of straight reading time.<br />
<br />
My husband also got a laptop and wifi'd it up for me, so surfing boards/reading news/emailing friends is up there on the list.<br />
<br />
I've also been wanting to get Uru and play it.  I played Myst and Riven when they were first released and enjoyed the scenery in it if nothing else.<br />
<br />
Actually I think I have more stuff I can do than I can actually accomplish in 4 days.  Then I go hobbling back to work.  They expect full recovery to take 2-3 months depending on how well I heal, but only 4 days of 'completely off your feet, leg elevated, incision iced'.  Four months later I get to do the other leg.  (They need to lengthen the outermost calf muscle, mine isn't long enough and it results in crippling shin splints if I do anything more active than vacuum the house.)<br />
<br />
If work is slow, I might take a few more days off to do the other stuff, but the end of the month is always a busy time, so I can't take too many days off.</div></div><hr />

The Clipper ship dream was weird.  I was on the deck of a ship looking up at all the guys, dressed as pirates, in the rigging.  And I watched as one climbed down.  Was quite a climb!  Then the captain stood on the deck reading poetry and getting choked up over his poem.  Meanwhile they were trying to uh... land? the boat, however they didn't seem to have very good control of it and were coming in too fast and rammed the dock thing.  We ended up getting off the boat in crashing waves and slogging through water trying to make it to shore.   What a bizarre dream!</div></div><hr />

I used to have a house with an icky slope like that, I think I used cheap crampons that I got at a yard sale.  After that I only bought houses with flat yards (although it was more due to the ice/snow storms and difficulty hitting my driveway while siding sideways down the street/hill in front of the house than because of yard care concerns).<br />
<br />
I really love ice plants, I think they're gorgeous whether they're in bloom or not.  They look so lush!  At least you've got something other than the weeds doing well.<br />
<br />
And um, the clipper ship dream sounds like you watched Pirates of the Carribean, Rosencrantz and Gildenstern are Dead, and Titanic all in one night before bed :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Actually, I had Much Ado about nothing running on the DvD player and I was only lightly asleep.  So I bet maybe the scene where Claudio is mourning Hero was playing.  He reads a poem to her and is crying.  I don't know what the clipper ship was about, but I often have scary dreams about large waves.  I think it has to do with some overly large waves that trashed me when I used to body surf and boogie board.<br />
<br />
I thought about cleats too, but then I though, what if I start to fall and my foot is stuck?   <br />
<br />
I swear, no more homes with slopes for me either!   I was so impressed with the size of the backyard at this house, unfortunately most of it is this stinking slope.  If I were rich I'd hire someone to remove the slope and make a giant retaining wall, if it could be done.  Actually... if I were rich, I wouldn't live here!</div></div><hr />

Unfortunately they're in a part of the yard that doesn't get irrigated so they don't pull out of the ground nicely.  I have to take my little hand pick and chop them out of the ground.  <br />
<br />
Hard work!  I crawled onto the sofa last night and was almost too tired to go to bed.<br />
<br />
Today I bought a flat of a pretty sedum I hope will make a nice ground cover, it seems to spread readily.  And another flat of Wooly Thyme and a few individual plants to try as ground cover.  One was called Speedwell.  It's a lime green, round leaf.  Not sure if it'll creep or not, hope so!  And an Ajuga which is supposed to be an excellent creeper!   And then a couple of plants that I just couldn't resist. :p <br />
<br />
My Kangaroo's paw, I think that is what it is, is beginning to bloom now that the weeds are cleared away.  The Mallow shrub is blooming.  The mexican blue salvia I thought I killed last year is showing signs of life. <br />
<br />
I think I'll work on planting during my early morning forays and weeding on the weekends.<br />
<br />
And I think one of the kids in my neighborhood is looking to do some yard work, so maybe I can recruit him to do some weeding for me!</div></div><hr />

The neighborhood kid did a LOT of work for me yesterday and he's coming back today to do more!  I'm going to have this weed issue licked, for this round anyway, in short order.<br />
<br />
I actually started buying some plants to start filling in the gaping holes left by the weeds.</div></div><hr />

Congratulatoins on getting your weeds licked.  Hopefully you won't have to do it again next year, or at least it won't be as bad.<br />
<br />
I was trying to think of some ground cover that's good for preventing weeds, but then remembered I are an engineer so my black plastic solution may not be what you're looking for.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jinjre</div><div class="date">03-22-2004, 04:23 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">LOL, black plastic is teh suxxor on slopes.  All the mulch just sliiiiiiiides right off of it.<br />
<br />
Glad to hear you got the neighbor kid involved.  Nothing like a younger set of muscles/joints to make the work go faster!<br />
<br />
I've been sitting outside for as long as my leg will stand it (surgery was last wendesday, gotta keep it elevated) enjoying how pretty my yard looks.  It was all worth it. <br />
<br />
I even talked Iagoe into mowing our front patch (hard to call 12 x 15 feet a 'yard') yesterday, so it looks pretty decent.  I was nice enough to fertilize and overseed the grass before my leg was out of commission, so the grass should grow nice and fast for him ;)  (Iagoe detests yard work, I think he'd cover the whole thing with rocks and call it 'art' if he had the chance)<br />
<br />
All your plants sound like they're going to be really pretty.  I've always liked ice plants, unfortunately we don't get enough heat/sun for it to grow</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Panamah</div><div class="date">03-22-2004, 04:52 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I think I'll take a picture of my slope to a good nursery and ask for help. :)  <br />
<br />
I can wait until I can sit outside and enjoy my garden.  However, I don't think I could just sit.  I always see something that needs attending.  Maybe this summer I'll actually get to the point where I'm happy enough with things that I can sit and enjoy.<br />
<br />
I think I'm going to build a bunch of raised beds on the flat part of my yard that I haven't landscaped (i.e. most of the back).  I'll use something like a small mulch or perhaps decomposed granite inbetween the bed.   I think the beds will be like 3x4 or 3'x6' boxes that I'll make out of 2&quot;x6&quot; and 4&quot;x4&quot; and make them so you can sit on the edges.   I saw someone make one on TV, looked fairly easy. /knockwood<br />
<br />
I gotta get out there with a big tape measure and draw it all out on paper and do it right.   Then I'll have beds for flowers, some for veggies, some for vines, some for annuals and I think they'll be easier to care for than ground level ones.<br />
<br />
Then I gotta landscape the problem drainage area.  Whee.... not.</div></div><hr />
