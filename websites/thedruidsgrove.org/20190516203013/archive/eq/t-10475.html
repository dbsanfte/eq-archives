I have completed through getting the hardened mixture for Druid Epic 1.0   But Airik Farisght on Chess Island will not respond to hail except to hurl insults.  I then tried todo the batwing quest and neither Impholder or Elianos will respond - other than insults.  Impholder says she has no use for the batwings when I attempt the trade.  :curse: <br />

 <br />
Thoughts or suggestion ?????</div></div><hr />

I don't know if it still works, but you might try opening a trade window with lady for the batwing quest, and having someone else cast invis on you, then trading.<br />
<br />
Only other thing would be to try wolf form, or HE illusion, but if you're a Wood Elf it might not help you that much.</div></div><hr />

Stand behind them, then press sneak. YOu should con indifferent. If you do not con indifferent, you are not sneaking. Once you are indifferent to them, hand the item to them.<br />
<br />
If you sneak, then hail them, they will turn to talk to you. You will then have to go behind them again to finish.</div></div><hr />

Wolf form bumps your faction with the guy a bit if he won't take the muffins at first. Did you try wolf form with the batwing lady? Sometimes it raises your faction enough that you can do the hand ins.<br />

Hope this is of some small help,<br />

The sneak trick still works, as I just did it last week. <br />
<br />
It deppends on what faction you need to do the quest. If you need to be higher than indiff, then it will not work. If indiff will work, sneak is your friend.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Pulvani</div><div class="date">12-24-2004, 10:59 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">When I did 1.0, I had to do three different faction quests. The first one was the oh-so-joyful muffin quest. The second one would've been the batwing quest, but the NPC that takes the batwings didn't want them. Actually she &quot;ate&quot; them but didn't give me any faction raise (grrr....). I ended up doing the letter quest between Jeremy Leafrunner (stands by the fire in Jaggedpine Forest) and his grandmother in Felwithe. I had to do a few rounds of giving a letter to Jeremy, then one back to his grandma. After awhile, my faction was good enough that the batwing lady liked me ;) I'll see if I can look it up and edit this post.<br />

EDIT: Ah, here we go.<br />

<br />
This quest raises Keepers of the Art faction also (which you need to talk to Alrik Farsight in TD), but it takes a bit longer than the batwing quest, which is why I only did it long enough until the batwing lady would take my batwings. When I did this, I bound myself right next to Jeremy's grandma (Elishia Leafrunner in Felwithe) and then would port to Surefall and run to JPF to deliver the first letter, then gate back to deliver the second letter. Actually if you deliver the second letter back to Jeremy it doesn't raise Keepers of the Art faction, but I just kept giving them to him anyway since I was already there. After you do this a few times to raise your faction a bit, you should be able to start giving batwings to Niola. Hope this helps!!</div></div><hr />
