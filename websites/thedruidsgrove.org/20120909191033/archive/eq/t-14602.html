 <br />
i have the &quot;Finding Felena&quot; quest (2nd in the series i think). You have to collect:<br />
 <br />
Encrusted Magnesium deposit<br />
Sulphuric mineral deposit<br />
Direwind soil sample<br />
Darksoot mushroom<br />
 <br />
My question is - how do you get these? are they ground spawns or drops? and where/what from?<br />
 <br />
thanks,<br />
Wolficus</div></div><hr />

1 is at zoneline to sunderock in little alcove there<br />
2 is at base of waterfall<br />
3 is in mushroom caves<br />
4 is on ground around the bears</div></div><hr />

Many have posted about it and bug reported it, but it's still that way on Bristlebane.  If you spend enough time in wolfform sticking your head inside the rocks, eventually you'll find both of them sitting there, unreachable of course.</div></div><hr />

It's almost like a limited number pop in the right spot and never respawn. I've always found my spawn to the left of the water as you look at it along the waterline.</div></div><hr />

You say, 'Hail, Maven Bellstone'<br />
<br />
Maven Bellstone says 'I.. This is too much for me to contemplate right now. Will you [take Vonsolu's last transcript] to an old friend for me... You must, please... I beg of you. He may be able to help. Kluno, Kluno Orenbrew... I trust him with my life, as should you. Last I heard, he had taken up residency here, somewhere in the Direwind Cliffs.'<br />
<br />
You say, 'take Vonsolu's last transcript'<br />
<br />
--- You have been assigned the task 'Finding Felena'.<br />
<br />
Task Details -<br />
&#8226; Deliver Maven&#8217;s note to Kluno Orenbrew  &#8211; Direwind Cliffs, Loc neg920 neg650 ( top of waterfall ).<br />
&#8226; Gather an Encrusted Magnesium Deposit &#8211; Direwind Cliffs, Loc neg2100 neg600 ( near some rocks ).<br />
&#8226; Gather a Sulphuric Mineral Compound  &#8211; Direwind Cliffs, Loc neg1110 neg710 ( near waterfall, usually to the left ).<br />
&#8226; Gather a Direwind Soil Sample &#8211; Direwind Cliffs, Loc pos 1200 neg430 ( in valley with bears ).<br />
&#8226; Gather a Darksoot Mushroom &#8211; Direwind Cliffs<br />
&#8226; Deliver the four Direwind samples to Kluno Orewnbrew &#8211; Direwind Cliffs, Loc pos1600, pos990 ( first room in shroom cave, blue dot on the ground ).<br />
<br />
Important note is you need to have the task before you go collecting the samples.  Kluno Orenbrew is a giant located on the plateu just above the waterfall.  The Locs of the ground drops are only approximate ones as I have heard they sometimes move.  Also note the Sulphuric Mineral Compound has been reported to be buggy although I found it left of the waterfall.<br />

You say, 'Hail, Kluno Orenbrew'<br />
<br />
Kluno Orenbrew says 'Before you say anything, I can already tell you that Maven has sent you. I have been waiting patiently for your [arrival].'<br />
<br />
You say, 'arrival'<br />
<br />
Kluno Orenbrew says 'Yes.. yes, I know a great many things. I also know that you are short on time if you wish to find what you seek. If you do have your eyes set on finding what became of the girl Felena, forge your way into the ascent and return to me with four samples of indigenous materials. I should be able to gain a clear vision of what has transpired there with those materials.'<br />
<br />
Kluno Orenbrew regards you indifferently -- it appears to be quite formidable.<br />
<br />
Once you hand in the four items -<br />
<br />
 --- Your task 'Finding Felena' has been updated.<br />
<br />
Kluno Orenbrew says, 'Just the materials I needed. Undoubtedly you know who I am by now... or perhaps not? For years, many have come to seek my wisdom and shamanistic ability to recall past events through my powerful chants and incantations. I will see what I can do.'<br />

 You gain experience!!<br />

<br />
You say, 'Hail, Kluno Orenbrew'<br />
<br />
Kluno Orenbrew says 'It is [clear] to me now... clearer than you could ever imagine.'<br />
<br />
You say, 'clear'<br />
<br />
Kluno Orenbrew says 'They were being forced to the north, through the vast landscape that makes up the ascent. I sense that they encountered an uninhibited group of mercenaries. They attempted to flee, to flee to the one place they... wait; yes they tried to flee into the mines. But why... the mines are [more treacherous than]. . .'<br />
<br />
You say, 'more treacherous than?'<br />
<br />
Kluno Orenbrew says 'The vision was becoming so clear to me, and suddenly faded. Almost as if Felena's recent history had been erased, or perhaps written beyond the scope of my ability. The answers you seek should lie within the [mines].'<br />
<br />
You say, 'mines'<br />
<br />
Kluno Orenbrew says 'Keep a careful watch on your surroundings - I seldom enjoy finding out that I was the one to send brave souls to their death. I wonder if an old hermit I used to know by the name of Rozoth Orbu still dwells in that region. You may want to seek him out, as he is wise beyond his years and may have information as to her whereabouts.'<br />
<br />
--- You have been assigned the task 'Finding Felena'.<br />
<br />
&#8226; Search the Vergalid Mines for Rozoth Orbu, an old hermit  &#8211; Vegalid Mines<br />
&#8226; Search the mines for any traces of Felena &#8211; Vegalid Mines<br />
&#8226; Return Felena&#8217;s torn garment to Rozoth  &#8211; Vegalid Mines<br />
<br />
Rozoth is located in a small building a big cavern following the left path from down the lift.  Be warned clicking off invis to talk to him will bring like 10 mobs.<br />
<br />
http://i15.photobucket.com/albums/a367/kyotodesertfox/Everquest/VergalidMinesFalena.jpg<br />
<br />
Rozoth Orbu says 'Kluno indeed knew what he was doing when he sent you down into this desolate place. I had sensed a presence of those who did no belong down in these depths. As to the nature of their visit, I am unsure. I can only be certain of one thing; they were [not alone]. Then suddenly, I felt the area settle -- for the most part, mind you, a few hours later.'<br />
<br />
--- Your task 'Finding Felena' has been updated.<br />
<br />
Rozoth Orbu says 'I believe something still remains which did not reside here previously from who or whatever ventured into this region. I can only direct you to the Zek shrine that the mindless Drakkin tirelessly watch over. The power of Dyn`leth still invades their weak minds. Convinced, they are - convinced that Vergalid will one day break free from the arcane prison he has been [trapped in] for so long.'<br />
<br />
Rozoth Orbu says 'The drakkin work tirelessly to ensure that the life force flowing from the Zek shrine to their imprisoned ruler, Vergalid, does not diminish. For when it does, the ancient prophets have said that the dragon will fall. Thus, they mine tirelessly for the precious crystals that feed power into the Zek shrine. Days, weeks, months will disappear and they still fail to realize that the crystal supply from the mine will eventually run dry. Whoever it was that ventured this way certainly had stopped near the Zek shrine. Felena, was it? If you manage to locate an artifact from her party, I will do what I can to provide more information as to her more recent whereabouts for you.'<br />
<br />
The item Rozoth refers to is &#8220;A Torn Garment&#8221; which only drops from ancient trilobites which are located in the hidden area before the Shrine of Rallos Zek.<br />
<br />
--- You have slain an ancient trilobite!<br />
<br />
--You have looted a A Torn Garment.&#8212;<br />
<br />
Hand in the garment to Rozoth.<br />
<br />
--- Your task 'Finding Felena' has been updated.<br />
<br />
Rozoth Orbu says, 'Ah... Yes. I see. This is most interesting. This torn garment has been worn recently, where did you find it?'<br />
<br />
You gain experience!!</div></div><hr />

There is one more task after the Vergalid Mines ( Four tasks in total ). <br />

Final Rewards for the mission are pretty sucky for the effort –<br />

She is being held captive by a Commander and 3 or 4 guards.  The Commander was light blue and the guards were green.

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Galain</div><div class="date">10-26-2006, 04:23 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I think it was something like 'Free Felena'. No real need to evac. Just be ready to run and snare them all. Then you can take them all out. They are incredibly weak. Think it took like 4 nukes per guard and just a little more for the Commander.<br />
 <br />
I am of course assuming by the way you phrased your question that you meant 'How do I make the gnolls active?'</div></div><hr />
