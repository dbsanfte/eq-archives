I have been playing with my epic for quite some time now and have been 65  for 5 months. I just can't seem to find a good enough weapon to take it's palce. <br />
               I have a great primary item but, I would like to have a good weapon for running thru lowbie zones and doing lowbie quests. Not to say the epic isn't good for that but I just kinda wanna move on from it.(Sick of seeing same ol' scimmy) <br />
               So any ideas or hints would be great. All weapon skills are maxed so dosen't have to be 1hs but I kinda prefer. )<br />
                                                                   Thanks,<br />

This is what replaced my epic. Though if you get Mithaniel Marr to drop it you might have to sell your soul.<br />
<br />
I love it, but it isn't the best looking weapon. The epic looks alot better.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Hammer looks like the Corinav hammer and shield looks like that Corinav flag thingy.<br />
<br />
Greatstaff of Power looks like a Rathe Councilman staff.<br />
<br />
I guess it's a toss up.  Now if that staff made you do that twirly twirl of death that councilmen do ... Well, Greatstaff of Power all the way!</div></div><hr />

I think it drops off one of the minis.  OK stats, and a lot more hp than the epic.  I was unlucky with MM, and never got a tempest blade, and used this hammer all the ways until time.<br />
