And yes, I know other ugprades than the ones I've listed exist; I've simply listed what I personally think are the best options for the particular price/level range.<br />

Both are nice during certain stages.<br />
<br />
Arms: I'd use withered leather arms over Verm or ES (unless I need the free DoT from ES), just about up until I was able to do one of the velious arm quests.<br />
<br />
Hands: Withered leather gloves are a decent upgrade between something like Splitpaw and Coldain Skin<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Katlynel</div><div class="date">07-25-2001, 11:01 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">good points Ligge ... I didn't list some of the high end items you mentioned because I figured that anyone who would have access to any of those items would be aware of how good they were (treant tear, silverleaf, mask of war, etc.).... it was mostly aimed toward the level 50ish druids who post here all the time asking for upgrades to their BCP, Paw gloves, and Nightshade wreaths :) but yes those are all good high end upgrades.  I definitely will add the bone amulet and medicine totem.<br />
<br />
Verm boots aren't bad, but I don't know that it'd be worth losing 9wis to gain 1ac, 15hp, 13agi, and 5str ... plus I was sticking to items that would be either purchasable (for under 20k), or questable solo / small group.<br />
<br />
Some of the withered leather pieces are definitely good, but withered leather is absurdly rare on my server at least ... I've never once seen either the arms or the gloves for sale.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tanglewood</div><div class="date">07-25-2001, 12:04 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">We got two withered leather tunics off the same mob - Dartain the Lost, I think. I swapped my ulthork tunic for it right away and have never looked back. It is *very nice*.<br />
<br />
Just wish it didn't look like ordinary leather...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Katlynel</div><div class="date">07-25-2001, 01:10 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Looks like some explanation is in order as to what criteria I used to select the items on the above list... this isn't really &quot;Every Uber Item You Could Ever Get to Upgrade Any Slot.&quot;  Rather, it's aimed at the level 50 druids who post here every day asking what to use to upgrade their forest loops and velium ruby veil.  (I mean, I figure a level 58 druid who's using an enshrouded veil probably knows that the Mask of War would be a good upgrade if only they could get one.)  So I used these criteria to try to put together a list of relatively cheap, available items:<br />
<br />
1) Stats (durr).<br />
<br />
2) Commonness.  For example, the crystal chitin shield is an awesome item, but it's incredibly rare.  There's nothing sadder than seeing a poor little druid auctioning &quot;WTB Crystal Chitin Shield / Withered Leather Gloves / Burynai Hide Boots&quot; for day after day.  So I chose items that are fairly common and should be buyable with an hour or two of auctioning.<br />
<br />
3) Cost.  This applies to items like Lodizal shield, Crystal Chitin BP, ES BP, etc.: They're super rare (see above under &quot;Availability&quot;), but if you could buy one, they'd run you over 80k on my server.  I'm assuming that your average level 50 druid doesn't have that.  Mask of War is 25k on my server, withered leather tunic 40k+.  About every item I listed is under 15k on Saryrn, with many under 1k.<br />
<br />
4) Forces required to get the item.  Obviously a dweamorvine garland or withered leather tunic or tanglewood shield is a great item, but they require a full fledged raid to get.  I'm assuming that if you went on a Hate raid and saw a runewood shield drop, you'd know you wanted it.  So I'm listing items people could organize one group to go camp, or else auction to buy in NFP/EC/GFay.<br />
<br />
5) Bang for the buck.  For example, electrum black sapphire earrings are awesome and cheap; same with crown of the froglok kings.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Quelm</div><div class="date">07-25-2001, 02:21 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'd add the following:<br />
<br />
Waist: Mucilaginous Girdle<br />
Shoulders: Tattered Mantle<br />
Primary: Spirit Tome<br />
Shield: Crystal Webshield<br />
Back: Cloak of the Ry'Gorr Oracles<br />
<br />
The Girdle is a nice belt and isn't too tough to get. The Mantle and the Webshield are both really cheap/farmable AC/hp options for folks who aren't obsessed with 200 wis. The Spirit Tome offers 6 wis in the primary hand. The cloak offers wis and MR.<br />
<br />
overall though, great starter list! Someone has a druid item configurator (buried in one of the crystal chitin threads) that handles the top end items really well.<br />

I belive that the 50 Mana this pervides is an increadible asset to the user of it, especially at lower levels.  The +5Int is also nice in raising skill level for trade skills and so forth.  A further question is I have Golden Black Saphire Earings, shout I get Electrum Black Saphire Earings, what is the difference?<br />

Electrum black sapphire earrings are ac2/25mana/35hp.<br />
<br />
Most people tend to consider the electrum black sapphire earrings slightly better as they give you 2 ac and 10 more hp at the cost of 10 mana.  If you can afford it, trade out your gold bs earring for a electrum one but don't if it's a major amount of money for you.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
That was quoted from an earlier post.<br />
<br />
For any druid, I can almost guarantee (there will be one out there that will prove me wrong), that their WIS is higher than their INT.  This being the case ,then WIS is the primary factor for tradeskill increases.  Verant has stated that it is the higher of the two, either WIS or INT for some tradeskills (I think smithing uses STR as well, not sure).<br />
<br />
Just want to clarify that.<br />

Top mask that a druid would want is a mask of war and never get rid of the mask self only &quot;clicker&quot; will stop aoe dispells. Also barbed dagon hide boots high ac and 15sta.  Also for all of you half elf druids out there that have no idea how i am going to get 200 wis.... shoulder item the prayer shawl will help alot ( 5ac 8wis) drops in kedge keep off of estella of gloomwater. The earring of essence is nice but also the finger bone hoop, I know that this has always been thought of as a tank or melee earring but its not.  also you don't always have to go for the FO rings i have seen too many druids go this route and it will hurt you in the end if you can spare the wis to wear those get some velium and jade rings 5ac 30hp/mana.  Most druids forget that mana is our life blood and it is why we are here, to heal, nuke, dot, and evac groups if the situation arises.  Get 200 wis then post again i have tons of pure mana items that you cna use. One last one that is over looked alot, the obulas death shroud from OS 12ac 5stam 3str/wis 25mana 1 to all resists very aquirable.<br />

I am working on upgrading some of this to better AC and stats. Since my wisdom is way over 200 now. For the Mask of war I had it but I would not give up the mask I have now. The stats are better.<br />
<br />
Mask of War: 9 AC, +2 STR, +5 STA, +9 WIS, EFF: YAULP II<br />

<br />
Though it doesn't tell you how easy each item is to get, most of the time, more information is just a click away.<br />
<br />
Also, the higher level and the more uber you get, the less you will want to value wis (at least relative to other values).  So play around with the values until you get something that makes sense for you.<br />

Ok, I don't want to give up my Nathsar, even if it does look a little funky now I am hoping they fix it. I HATE the aqua/teal chain look and don't like the green looking stuff really (es arms for soloing make me look like I'm part of the Jokers gang with the green and purple). <br />
<br />
I'm thinking a Tattered Hide Cloak would be a good upgrade for the Shissar Scale... one more WIS, (DAMN them for raising the cap just when I got up to 200 even with my crappy 100 Base WIS!). I traded out my 7 WIS rings because I thought the Golem T. and Di'Zok were better overall statwise. I'm starting to get to the level where I need to worry about resists, however. Any suggestions, preferably without me having to give up my Nathsar? I'm in a very small guild, BTW.</div></div><hr />

Both items can be found in Chardok; their interest as an upgrade is less now that the softcap has been removed but they can replace easily any of the two kind of black saphire earings.</div></div><hr />

<br />
( ( Wis / 5 ) + 2 ) * Level = Mana<br />
<br />
Level 15:<br />
<br />
( ( 200 / 5 ) + 2 ) * 15 = 630 Mana from Wisdom, so at lower levels Mana is MUCH greater then here you are getting 3 Mana per wisdom.<br />
<br />
<br />
Level 34:<br />
<br />
( ( 200 / 5 ) + 2 ) * 34 = 1428 Mana from wisdom, so the higher your level the more important it is to max out your wisdom, you are now getting 7mana per wisdom.<br />
<br />
Level 60:<br />
<br />
( ( 200 / 5 ) + 2 ) * 60 = 2520 Mana from wisdom, You are now getting 12 mana per wisdom. <br />
<br />
<br />
With this formula you can figure out what is worth more, the wisdom from an item or the mana.<br />
<br />
Pre-Luclin the Wis cap was 200, and Mana items at High level were highly sought after since 200 isnt that hard to reach.</div></div><hr />

Rare drop in Skyshrine.  I dont have the stats handy, and it doesn't even show up in eqprices, but it has better AC and a serious boost to MR.<br />

I can post stats later if ppl are interested.<br />

<br />
I have all I want except the tunic and mask. Tonight I gave away two gloves, one legs, and a bracer. Anyway, it may take you a while to beg a complete set but it will last you until you can start getting planar/god armor. EQDruids list this as like the 3rd best armor set for druids.</div></div><hr />
