<h2 align="left"><font face="Arial" color="#808080">Rules of Conduct</font></h2>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial">The Council shall view incidents of conduct on an individual basis.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial"><font color="#808080">Respect each other:</font> Personal attacks will not be tolerated. Swearing and insults are other examples of unacceptable behavior. This includes the message boards as well as on channel. As a rule the guild chat language is kept at a "PG" level.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial"><font color="#808080">Respect others:</font> The Dragon Dynasty aspires to be well respected guild within this Realm. As a member you are a representative of the Dynasty. Whether on a channel, speaking to another member, a newbie, or a combatant, always remember this.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial"><font color="#808080">Be Helpful:</font> Our guild is one of honor. Be aware of your surroundings. Be aware of others around you. Be willing to lend aid to those in need. This also includes answering questions or offering directions. This can also include being helpful on SHOUT or OOC.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial"><font color="#808080">PVP:</font> Dynasty members may engage other players in fair fights only. "It is the responsibility of the strong to protect the weak". Ganging up on smaller or weaker players will not be tolerated and are grounds for banishment. The only exceptions to this is during times of war.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial"><font color="#808080">Scamming :</font> All that belong to the Dynasty will not knowingly or willingly be part of a scam. Scamming other players regardless of reason is grounds for banishment from the Dynasty.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial"><font color="#808080">Bottom Line:</font> Treat others as you would be treated and remember that your actions reflect on the guild as a whole.</font></p>
