            <description>Earlier this year I was approached by our guild banker, Burbridge, and
he made a request of me.  He asked me to think up another
competition, similar to our Christmas Essay competition and provided me
with first place prize incentive that required something from our guild
members that would challenge them.

The idea I came up with was a comic strip.  Unfortunately, we did
not get three team entries, but we did receive two team entries. 
The rules were simple:  Three guildmembers were to form a team and
together create a comic strip that highlighted a moment or moments in
our guild.

Now we would like to share them with the rest of you.</description>

            <description>One would think that when you are in a room beautifully decorated and surrounded by friends of all sizes and shapes that you would feel relaxed, peaceful, full of contentedness. Not so in the Demi-Plane of Blood!</description>

            <description>WARNING: AINMER ALERT 




It&amp;rsquo;s common knowledge that one of the secrets
behind Enlightenment&amp;rsquo;s success is our use of Teamspeak as a raid tool.
While it can be disruptive at times &amp;ndash; for the majority of the time it&amp;rsquo;s
effectiveness is, by far, a major asset, especially when one considers
the times we simply did not &amp;ldquo;have the numbers&amp;rdquo; to pull an encounter
off, but did so regardless.</description>
