            <description>The last few weeks have seemed such a whirlwind - so this morning I sat
down and actually began to reflect on them.  I'm sure those of you
who visit our sight are well aware of where we've come from and how
we've progressed over the last ten months or so.  Never in all my
dreams back then of where this guild would go did I expect to be where
I was last night - on the cutting edge of content.  And what fun
it is.

This update is short and sweet on the worlds and displays a few pictures of this zone 
we've stumbled across.  Huge, huge kudo's to my guildmates for all their work figuring out
and deciphering clues.  What a great accomplishment guys!
