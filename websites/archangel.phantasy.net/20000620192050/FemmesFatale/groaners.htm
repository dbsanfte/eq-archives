A state trooper pulls a car over on a lonely back road and approaches the blonde 
lady driver.<br>
"Ma'am, is there a reason that you're weaving all over the road?" The woman replied, 
"Oh officer, thank goodness you're here!! I almost had an accident! I looked up 
and there was a tree right in front of me. I swerved to the left and there was 
another tree in front of me. I swerved to the right and there was another tree 
in front of me!" Reaching through the side window to the rear view mirror, the 
officer replied, "Ma'am...that's your air freshener."

them. Immediately, he was arrested and charged with transporting gulls across

like these, who needs enemas?"

Back in the 1800's the Tates Watch Company of Massachusetts wanted to produce 
other products and, since they already made the cases for pocket watches, decided 
to market compasses for the pioneers traveling west. It turned out that although 
their watches were of finest quality, their compasses were so bad that people 
often ended up in Canada or Mexico rather than California. This, of course, is 
the origin of the expression, "He who has a Tates is lost!"

and gave it to the chief, instructing him to bite off, chew and swallow one inch

the chief was feeling. The chief shrugged and said, "The thong is ended, but the 
malady lingers on."

skin and the third slept on a hippopotamus skin. All three became pregnant and 
the first two each had a baby boy. The one who slept on the hippopotamus skin

to the sons of the squaws of the other two hides.

In Spain, the King, Juan Carlos, and his armies have trapped the separatists in 
a cave. Sensing victory, the king's forces press even more vigorously. The separatists, 
being trapped, don't know what to do until one of them detects fresh air coming 
from a spot in the back of the cave. He goes to see and there in the back of the 
cave is a hole. Escape is at hand! But in their rush to get out, too many try 
to get through at the same time and end up blocking the hole. Juan Carlos's armies 
take advantage of the situation and enter the cave ensuring victory. Thus is proved 
the old adage, "Don't put all your Basques in one exit!'

him, so he concocted a plan to get that one to "spill the beans". He hired an

or off with your head. One by one heads began to roll, literally. Finally, it 
came turn for the conspirer. Upon losing his nerve to fright, he was about to 
confess, but ... too late. Thus came about the expression, "Never hatchet your 
counts before they chicken!"

other and said, "I recognize him, he's "The furry with the syringe on top".

A man had in his possession the rarest of birds, the exquisite Ruval bird. It 
was fabled as being the most eloquent, beautiful bird. Regular bird food was undignified 
for this bird to eat, it ate only hard currency or coins. For a time the man was 
able to maintain the bird's diet, but eventually the bird's appetite was more 
than the man's earning capacity so he finally decided it was time to feed the 
bird regular bird food which the bird in no uncertain terms refused, thus proving 
the old adage, "Money is the eat of all Ruval!"
