<h4>Producer's (Spoof) Letter - 08-20-99</h4>
<p> We here at Verant have ascertained that our player base is composed of various 
  people with very different views of how the game should be approached. Some 
  are interested in EverQuest for the social aspect, some the adventuring and 
  sightseeing, and others the mindless bloodshed. None of these people are right, 
  and none are wrong. These are just different ways of playing the game, and we 
  cannot fault the players for how they choose to enjoy themselves. In order to 
  accommodate these different types of players and make the game interesting for 
  all, we have worked long and hard to create a filter that will automatically 
  convert conversation and emotes into what the player wants to see. The power 
  of this new feature goes well beyond what the language filter was able to provide, 
  and the /roleplay command we implemented that changed the color of the users 
  name and title was a joke by comparison. Now the gamers will play the game they've 
  always dreamed of. No longer will we see roleplayers arguing with powergamers 
  about how to interact. Everyone will get exactly what they want. You're in YOUR 
  game now! The different filters we have added are called: /POWERGAME /WHINERS 
  /ROLEPLAYETH /NEWBIE /CUTENESS </p>
<p>Here is an example of the filters in action. To demonstrate, we will show the 
  original exchange, followed by an example of how each different filter will 
  modify the encounter. </p>
<p>/NORMAL </p>
<p>Lythe bows before Kylarie.<br>
  Tashiara smiles. <br>
  Endaar waves at Tashiara.<br>
  Lythe says, 'Endaaaar!'<br>
  Kylarie says, 'You're so funny'<br>
  Tashiara says, 'Hey, good to see you guys again!'<br>
  Lythe nods.<br>
  Kylarie says, 'where do you want to go today?'<br>
  Lythe says, 'We could try Unrest...?'<br>
  Endaar shakes his head.<br>
  Endaar says, 'It was way too crowded last time, and people were kill stealing 
  all over the place.'<br>
  Tashiara says, 'oh'<br>
  Kylarie says, 'HEY!'<br>
  Kylarie says, 'incoming aqua goblin'<br>
  Lythe says, 'got him'<br>
  Endaar says, 'be careful, he's a big one'<br>
  Lythe says, 'help'<br>
  (Lythe dies at the hands of said goblin)<br>
  Tashiara says, 'oh no!'<br>
  Kylarie cries over Lythe's corpse.</p>
<p> /POWERGAME</p>
<p> Lythe makes a rude gesture at Kylarie.<br>
  Tashiara smirks.<br>
  Endaar makes a rude gesture at Tashiara.<br>
  Lythe says, 'd00d!/!!'<br>
  Kylarie says, 'wtf r u all usign emotes.... dum rolplayers'<br>
  Tashiara says, 'u guys r 3 levls higher then me I only hav 221 hits'<br>

  (Lythe dies at the hands of said blu gobin)<br>
  Tashiara says, 'u suk hehehhej. u sould wear better ac nextime'<br>
  Kylarie laughs at Lythe's corpse.</p>
<p> /ROLEPLAYETH</p>
<p> Lythe bows deeply before the beautiful lady Kylarie.<br>
  Tashiara beams a glimmering smile, catching the attention of the men.<br>
  Endaar waves a hearty hello to Tashiara.<br>
  Lythe says, 'My good man Endaar! I have not seen thee in a fortnight. Praytell 
  me soon what hath happened during the times we have been departed.' <br>
  Kylarie says, 'I have truly missed your companionship in our absence, friends. 
  Let me have but a moment to compose myself, that I do not shed a tear in happiness.'<br>
  Tashiara says, 'Hail, and well met, brothers and sister. What a fine day to 
  share with but the best of Norrath.'<br>
  Lythe nods a knowing nod, as he turns to give a cunning wink to Kylarie.<br>
  Kylarie says, 'Tis such a fine day in Faydwer. The birds sing to me and the 
  sun smiles upon my face. To leave this place will be sweet sorrow, but alas 
  we must. What adventurous land will feel our footfalls this morrow?'<br>
  Lythe says, 'Perchance we should smite the forsaken walking dead in a mansion 
  I have heard tell of. The gods would certainly be thankful and bards would sing 
  our praises.'<br>
  Endaar shakes his head, as apparently he holds information of some import. <br>
  Endaar says, 'Nay, that land does not want of our company. It is inhabitated 
  by many an unvirtuous and self-serving knave. By my hand, I would send them 
  all on their way to the deepest crevasse of Hell itself.'<br>
  Tashiara says, 'We are indebted to you, Endaar. Shielding us from the perils 
  of such common rogues is revealing of your kind heart.'<br>
  Kylarie says, 'By the Gods!'<br>
  Kylarie says 'A beast comes this way! Draw steel, that we may do battle! The 
  aquatic abomination will rue the day it slithered out of its salty abode.'<br>
  Lythe says, 'Back, Kylarie. I could not allow a lady such as yourself to take 
  up arms against this vile creature. I will dispatch it myself. Have at thee!'<br>
  Endaar says, 'Such valor is sheer madness Lythe. I beseech you to see that no 
  honor can be found in suicide!'<br>
  Lythe says, 'Augh! Your words speak true, but I hear them too late. Ask for 
  me tomorrow, and you will find me a grave man.'<br>
  (Lythe dies at the hands of said aquatic abomination)<br>
  Tashiara says, 'Alas, poor Lythe. I knew thee well. Your death will not be in 
  vain.'<br>
  Kylarie drops to her knees and buries her head in her hands as she weeps over 
  Lythe's corpse.</p>
<p> /CUTENESS</p>
<p> Lythe kisses Kylarie on the cheek.<br>
  Tashiara giggles teehee!<br>
  Endaar blushes as he waves at Tashiara.<br>
  Lythe says, 'Hiyeeee Endaar'<br>
  Kylarie says, 'Ooooh, kissies! Thankie'<br>
  Tashiara says, 'Hi hi hi hi! I missied you all!!'<br>
  Lythe smiles happily and giggles.<br>
  Kylarie says, 'Do you wanties to go somewhere and get into mischief?'<br>
  Lythe says, 'Yesses! How about the baddies in Unrest?!'<br>
  Endaar giggles and shakes his head.<br>
  Endaar says, 'I wishies we could, but there are probably meanies taking all 
  the goodies.'<br>
  Tashiara says, 'oh dearies'<br>
  Kylarie says, 'LOOKIES!! Mischief!'<br>
  Kylarie says, 'That's a ugly blue nasties'<br>
  Lythe says, 'no worries, I gotty him'<br>
  Endaar says, 'watch out, he is a BIG baddie'<br>
  Lythe says, 'helpies!'<br>
  (Lythe dies at the hands of said Mischief)<br>
  Tashiara says, 'Silly, always gets into mischief!'<br>
  Kylarie giggles over Lythe's corpsie.</p>
<p> /WHINING</p>
<p> Lythe sighs at Kylarie.<br>
  Tashiara sighs.<br>
  Endaar sighs at Tashiara.<br>
  Lythe says, 'Endaar, this is bogus, your spells do too much damage.'<br>
  Kylarie says, 'Yeah my strike doesn't do near as much as your dd spells'<br>
  Tashiara says, 'you're all going up levels too fast, damn this is unbalanced'<br>
  Lythe nods. Kylarie says, 'and I'm a cleric and can't use swords! WHY?'<br>
  Lythe says, 'it's probably pointless, but do you want to try Unrest?'<br>
  Endaar sighs.<br>
  Endaar says, 'Everyone was camping with their broken characters last time, and 
  quite frankly, until Verant gets off their behinds and fixes all my spells I 
  don't have a chance in there. When will wizards be able to tank like everyone 
  else?'<br>
  Tashiara says, 'At least you're not a rogue, they completely and utterly and 
  totally and undeniably SUCK! None of their skills work and they can't use spells 
  and they can't tank. Verant doesn't give a darn about them.'<br>
  Kylarie says, 'oh look a broken monster'<br>
  Kylarie says, 'it's one of those aqua goblins that are too strong and don't 
  give enough rare items'<br>
  Lythe says, 'what the hell, it doesn't matter. I'm going to remake anyways.'<br>
  Endaar says, 'you can't solo him Lythe. Your character is underpowered'<br>
  Lythe says, 'this is so retarded.. I'm going to die because Verant won't fix 
  the bugs in my race and class'<br>
  (Lythe dies at the hands of said broken monster)<br>
  Tashiara says, 'just goes to show that we should all have WAY more hit points 
  and mana than we get now'<br>
  Kylarie sighs over Lythe's corpse.</p>
<p> /NEWBIE</p>
<p> Lythe says, 'Hail'<br>
  Tashiara says, 'Hail'<br>
  Endaar says, 'Hail'<br>
  Lythe says, 'what does this red book do for me'<br>
  Kylarie says, 'CAN ANYONE HEAL ME'<br>
  Tashiara says, 'I have spider legs if you are looking for them'<br>
  Lythe says, 'Hail' Kylarie says, 'we should make a group DOES ANYONE KNOW HOW 
  TO MAKE A GROUP'<br>
  Lythe says, 'I'm level 5 now. Let's go to Unrest'<br>
  Endaar says, 'Hail' Endaar says, 'do you know the way there? I keep getting 
  lost in Felwithe.'<br>
  Tashiara says, 'Someone buy these spider legs please'<br>
  Kylarie says, 'CAN I GET A SOW I NEED TO RUN NOW'<br>
  Kylarie shouts, 'help aqua goblin'<br>
  Lythe says, 'I just changed my rusty bastard sword into a tarnished one, I'll 
  get him'<br>
  Endaar says, 'my consider shows, What do you want your tombstone to say. What 
  does that mean?'<br>
  Lythe shouts, 'help'<br>
  (Lythe dies at the hands of shouted aqua goblin)<br>
  Tashiara says, 'nobody wants these spider legs?'<br>
  Kylarie says, 'Hail'</p>
<p> See you next week, -Brad </p>

<p>Early one morning, a mother went in to wake up her son. "Wake up, son. It's 
  time to go to school!"<br>
  "But why, Mom? I don't want to go."<br>
  "Give me two reasons why you don't want to go."<br>
  "Well, the kids hate me for one, and the teachers hate me, too!"<br>
  "Oh, that's no reason not to go to school. Come on now and get ready."<br>
  "Give me two reasons why I *should* go to school."<br>
  "Well, for one, you're 52 years old. And for another, you're the PRINCIPAL!"</p>

<h4>Subject: Thought for the Day</h4>
<p> Too often, we lose sight of life's simple pleasures.......... </p>
<p>Remember, when someone annoys you, it takes 42 muscles in your face to frown. 
  <br>
  BUT, it only takes 4 muscles to extend your arm and smack the asshole upside 
  the head. </p>
<hr>
<p> A priest is walking down the street one day when he notices our Little Johnny 
  trying to press a doorbell on a houseacross the street.<br>
  However, Little Johnny is very small and the doorbell is too high for him to 
  reach.<br>
  After watching Little Johnny efforts for some time, the priest moves closer 
  to the boy's position.<br>
  He steps smartly across the street, walks up behind the little fellow and, placing 
  his hand kindly on the child's shoulder leans over and gives the doorbell a 
  sold ring.<br>
  Crouching down to the child's level, the priest smiles benevolently and asks, 
  "And now what, my little man?"<br>
  To which Little Johnny replies, "Now we run!"</p>
<hr>
<p>A knight and his men return to their castle after a long hard day of fighting.<br>
  "How are we faring?" asks the king.<br>
  "Sire," replies the knight, "I have been robbing and pillaging on your behalf 
  all day, burning the towns of your enemies in the west."<br>
  "What?!" shrieks the king. "I don't have any enemies to the west!"<br>
  "Oh," says the knight. "Well, you do now."</p>

<p> An investment counselor went out on her own.<br>
  She was shrewd and diligent, so business kept coming in, and pretty soon she 
  realized she needed an in-house counsel, so she began interviewing young lawyers.<br>
  "As I'm sure you can understand," she started off with one of the first applicants. 
  "In a business like this, our personal integrity must be beyond question."<br>
  She leaned forward. "Mr. Peterson, are you an *honest* lawyer?"<br>
  "Honest?" replied the job prospect. "Let me tell you something about honest. 
  Why, I'm so honest that my father lent me fifteen thousand dollars for my education 
  and I paid back every penny the minute I tried my very first case."<br>
  "Impressive. And what sort of case was that?"<br>
  The lawyer squirmed in his seat and admitted, "He sued me for the money."</p>

<p> <b>_________ Mary Poppins</b></p>
<p>Mary Poppins was traveling home, but due to worsening weather, she decided 
  to stop at a hotel for the night. <br>
  She approached the receptionist and asked for a room for the night.<br>
  "Certainly madam," he replied courteously.<br>
  "Is the restaurant open still?" inquired Mary.<br>
  "Sorry, no," came the reply, "but room service is available all night.<br>
  Would you care to select something from this menu?"<br>
  Mary smiled and took the menu and perused it. "Hmm, I would like cauliflower 
  cheese please," said Mary.<br>
  "Certainly, madam," he replied.<br>
  "And can I have breakfast in bed?" asked Mary politely.<br>
  The receptionist nodded and smiled. "In that case, I would love a couple of 
  poached eggs, please," Mary mused.<br>
  After confirming the order, Mary signed in and went up to her room for the night. 
  The night passed uneventfully and the next morning Mary came down early to check 
  out. The same guy was still on the desk. "Morning madam...sleep well?"<br>
  "Yes, thank you," Mary replied. "Food to your liking?"<br>
  "Well, I have to say the cauliflower cheese was exceptional, I don't think I 
  have had better. Shame about the eggs, though....they really weren't that nice 
  at all," replied Mary truthfully.<br>
  "Oh...well, perhaps you could contribute these thoughts to our Guest Comments 
  Book. We are always looking to improve our service and would value your opinion," 
  said the receptionist.<br>
  "OK, I will...thanks!" replied Mary....who checked out, then scribbled a comment 
  into the book. Waving, she left to continue her journey. Curious, the receptionist 
  picked up the book to see the comment </p>
<p>Mary had written. "Supercauliflowercheesebuteggswerequiteatrocious!" </p>
<hr>
<p> Lying in the hospital bed, the dying man began to flail about and make motions 
  as if he would like to speak.<br>
  The priest, keeping watch at the side of his bed leaned quietly over and asked, 
  "Do you have something you would like to say?"<br>
  The man nodded to the affirmative, and the priest handed him a pad and pen. 
  "I know you can't speak, but use this to write a note and I will give it to 
  your wife. She's waiting just outside."<br>
  Gathering his last bit of strength, the man took them and scrawled his message 
  upon the pad which he stuffed into the priest's hands. Then, moments later, 
  the man died.<br>
  After administering the last rites, the priest left to break the sad news to 
  the wife. After consoling her a bit, the priest handed her the note. "Here were 
  his last words. Just before passing on, he wrote this message to you."<br>
</p>
<p>The wife tearfully opened the note which read: "GET OFF MY *!#%*!!**$%^! OXYGEN 
  HOSE!!" _____ </p>
