<p>Screen Shots will go here....</p>
<p>If you have any screen snaps you would like others to enjoy... send them to 
  <a href="mailto:archangel@phantasy.net">Gjiintari</a>.</p>
<p><big><strong>Information on sending:</strong></big></p>
<ul>
  <li>When you send, give each one a caption and if you want a small narrative 
    describing the snapshot</li>
  <li>Please use JPEGs (.JPG) only to upload.&nbsp; Everquest stores the pictures 
    in bitmap (.bmp) format; you must use a graphics package to convert the screenshot 
    first.&nbsp; You can find a good packages at <a href="http://www.tucows.com">http://www.tucows.com</a> 
    , <a href="http://www.download.com">http://www.download.com</a> , or <a href="http://www.shareware.com">http://www.shareware.com</a>.</li>
  <li>Please use the 640x480 resolution when taking portraits for upload.&nbsp; 
    This will help reduce the size of the files and also make the picture easier 
    to view in its entirety for those who run a lower resolution.</li>
  <li>Please try and keep the file size under 100k.&nbsp; If you followed the 
    recommendations above the picture should be well under that size.</li>
  <li>Please do not upload pornographic or other questionable materials.&nbsp; 
    This feature of the site is intended for character portraits.&nbsp; There 
    are many mailing lists where pornographic submissions would be quite welcome.</li>
  <li>Enjoy.</li>
