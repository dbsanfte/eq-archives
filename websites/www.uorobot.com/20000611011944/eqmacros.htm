</b>EQ Macros is the <b><u> first</u></b> software tool that
provides recording &amp; playback of keystroke and mouse macros under EverQuest<font size="1"><sup>TM</sup></font>.</p>

<p align="left"><b><font face="Arial" size="2">New Version 1.1 Features!</font></b></p>

<ul>
  <li>Ten macro slots to record and playback</li>
  <li>Automatic saving and loading of all ten macro slots</li>
  <li>Recording options:
    <ul>
      <li>Choose a &quot;looped&quot; mode or &quot;single play back&quot; mode
        (per macro)</li>
      <li>Choose &quot;mouse &amp; keyboard&quot; mode or
        &quot;keyboard-only&quot; mode (per macro)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Audible feedback - EQ Macros plays WAV files in response to the various
    commands.&nbsp; This option can be toggled on and off by pressing
    &quot;]V&quot;.</li>
  <li>Pause feature.&nbsp; Pause is toggled with &quot;]P&quot;.</li>
  <li>Easy calibration.&nbsp; Just hit &quot;]C&quot; in the game, and EQ Macros
    will automatically trace the borders of the screen with the mouse</li>
  <li>Triggers - scanning the log file and automatically playing a given macro
    based on text in the log file.&nbsp; <a href="http://www.uorobot.com/scripts/WebBoard.dll/ViewMessage?MessageID=599" target="_blank">Read
    about triggers on the Message Board</a>.</li>
  <li>An &quot;Undo last record&quot; feature.&nbsp; (Given the current UI,
    its easy to record over a macro you just wanted to play)</li>
  <li>&quot;Stealth&quot; insertion.&nbsp; EQ Macros will no longer have to copy
    any files into the EverQuest directory <b>or</b> the Windows system
    directory.&nbsp; Additionally, EQ Macro keys (e.g., &quot;[&quot;,
    &quot;]&quot;) are no longer passed on to the game.&nbsp; This makes it
    impossible for Verant to detect without illegally searching your hard
    drive.&nbsp; And you'll be able to rename the EXE &amp; DLL, move them
    anywhere you want, change the window caption on the fly, etc.&nbsp; I think
    this will remove any reason to be paranoid about using EQ Macros.</li>
</ul>

<p align="left"><b><font face="Arial" size="2">Original Features</font></b></p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p align="left">Allows you to record and playback keystroke and mouse macros.&nbsp;
    The playback is continually looped.</li>
  <li>
    <p align="left">Easily increase such skills as Sense Heading, Instill Doubt
    (monks), Sneak, Mend, Casting skills (Divination, etc.), Fishing. Foraging,
    meditation, etc.</li>
  <li>
    <p align="left">With <b><font color="#FF0000"><i>New</i></font> mouse
    support</b>,
    you can create complex macros, such as fishing.</li>
  <li>
    <p align="left">Record <i>any</i>  keystroke or mouse movement.&nbsp; You could record moving
    back and forth, switching to a different keypad, switching view modes, etc.</li>
  <li>
    <p align="left">Each user gets a custom executable file compiled
    specifically for them.&nbsp; Each executable has different settings &amp;
    attributes that make it harder to detect its presence.</li>

<p align="left"><b><font face="Arial" size="2">Notes for Mouse Support</font></b><br>
To get the best results, you should calibrate EQ Macros before recording any
mouse macros.&nbsp; Simply press &quot;]C&quot; and EQ Macros will trace the
corners of the screen for you automatically.&nbsp; This will calibrate EQ
Macros.&nbsp; You can now safely record a mouse macro.</p>
<p align="left">Also note
that it is <b>highly recommended</b> to start any mouse macro with the mouse in the far upper left
hand corner of the screen.&nbsp; This makes mouse playback much more reliable.</p>
<p align="left"><b><font face="Arial" size="2">System Requirements</font></b><br>
Download and install the latest version of DirectX available for your
system.&nbsp; Do this <i>before</i> you install EQ Macros.&nbsp; Go to the
Windows Update page to see if a newer version is available.&nbsp; On Windows
2000, DirectX v7 is the latest.&nbsp;</p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial"><strong><a name="Trial">New Trial Version!&nbsp; (v1.1.0.11)</a><br>
</strong></font>The long-awaited <a href="eqmacro_trial_ver.htm">trial version
for EQ Macros</a> has been posted.&nbsp; Download it and record &amp; play your
own macros.&nbsp; Note that the trial version is limited to two minutes of total
macro playback time.&nbsp; Note that you must <b>first</b> download and install the support files
below.</p>
<p align="left"><strong><font size="2" face="Arial"><a name="Support">EQ Macros
Support Files (REQUIRED Download)</a><br>
</font></strong>Download the <a href="eqm-dlls.zip">EQ Macro DLL files</a> <font size="1">(710
Kb)</font>, and copy them to your Windows System directory.</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p align="left">On Windows 95/98, your system directory is
    &quot;C:\Windows\System&quot;</li>
  <li>
    <p align="left">On Windows NT/2000, your system directory is
    &quot;C:\WinNT\System32&quot;</li>
</ul>
<p align="left">It is also highly
encouraged to download the <a href="eqm-wavs.zip">EQ Macro Wave files</a> <font size="1">(215
Kb)</font>, and copy them to your EQ Macros directory.&nbsp; EQ Macros will
still work without the Wave files, but you will hear beeps instead of verbal
feedback for the commands.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p align="left"><b><font face="Arial" size="2">Installation</font></b></p>
<ol>
  <li>
    <p align="left">  FIRST:&nbsp; Download the DLL support files from:&nbsp; <a href="http://www.uorobot.com/eqmacros.htm#support">http://www.uorobot.com/eqmacros.htm#support</a><br>
    Copy the files (VCL50.BPL and NMFAST50.BPL) into your windows system<br>
    directory.  On Win95/95, this is "C:\Windows\System".  On WIn NT/<br>
    Win 2000 this is &quot;C:\WinNT\System32&quot;Run the installation program.  The files will be extracted into    C:\Program Files\EQ Macros, and an icon will be placed on your    Desktop.</li>
  <li>
    <p align="left">  If there is a "DInput.dll" file in your existing EQ Macros directory, DELETE IT.</li>
  <li>
    <p align="left">  (OPTIONAL)  Download the EQ Macro WAVE files, and copy them into    your EQ Macros directory.&nbsp;
    This is highly recommended.&nbsp; The WAVE files make using EQ Macros much
    easier (if your sound card supports multiple WAVE playback)</li>
  <li>
    <p align="left">  Run EQ Macros.</li>
  <li>
    <p align="left">  Hit the "Start" button.</li>
  <li>
    <p align="left">  Run EverQuest.  If you downloaded the wave files, you should hear
    &quot;EQ Macros is now running" after you press the "I Agree" button.&nbsp;</li>
  <li>
    <p align="left">  Record &amp; playback macros.&nbsp; Play EverQuest.</li>
  <li>
    <p align="left">  After quitting EverQuest, shutdown EQ Macros.</li>
</ol>
<p align="left"><b><font face="Arial" size="2">Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)</font></b></p>
<p align="left"><b>Q</b>:&nbsp; Are you sure it works?&nbsp; Everyone knows you
can't macro in EverQuest!<br>
<b>A</b>:&nbsp; EQ Macros is the first program of its kind!&nbsp; And <b>YES IT
WORKS</b>!&nbsp; ;)</p>
<p align="left"><b>Q</b>:&nbsp; Can you record &amp; playback mouse clicks,
drags, etc?<br>
<b>A</b>:&nbsp; YES!&nbsp; EQ Macros now has mouse support.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Q</b>:&nbsp; Will I get caught if I use EQ Macros?<br>
<b>A</b>:&nbsp; Not if you're smart about it.&nbsp; ;)&nbsp; Just like anything,
you must be careful how you use it.&nbsp; Don't macro right in the middle of a
busy area.&nbsp; Don't macro any kind of repetitive speech.&nbsp; Toggle your
&quot;AFK&quot; status while macroing, etc.&nbsp; Since each user gets a custom
executable, it can only be detected if Verant uses invasive (and illegal)
methods to detect it.&nbsp; Ultimately, you are responsible for how you use EQ
Macros, and you must <b>use EQ Macros at your own risk</b>.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Q</b>:&nbsp; Is there a trial version I can download to test
it out?<br>
<b>A</b>:&nbsp; Yes, you can <a href="eqmacro_trial_ver.htm">download it here</a>.</p>

<p align="left"><b>Q</b>:&nbsp; Will EQ Macros work for all patched versions of
EverQuest that Verant releases?<br>
<b>A</b>:&nbsp; I will make every effort to make sure EQ Macros works with each
patched version of EverQuest.&nbsp; However, I can't guarantee what happens in
the future, so there is no guarantee that EQ Macros will work forever. <b> EQ Macros
is sold &quot;as-is&quot;</b>, and no refund will be given in the event that a
patched version of EverQuest &quot;breaks&quot; EQ Macros.&nbsp;</p>

    character selection screens. EQ Macros wasn't designed to work with the
    login screens, etc.</li>
  <li>
    <p align="left">Be sure to calibrate the mouse (see documentation).</li>
  <li>
    <p align="left">Start macros with the mouse in the far upper left corner of

    press <b> twice</b> to STOP recording. Pressing &quot;]&quot; to stop recording could cause
    unexpected results.</li>
  <li>
    <p align="left">To playback macros use &quot;]&quot; + &quot;#&quot; (0-9) to start playing, and
    press <b> twice</b> to STOP playing.</li>
  <li>
    <p align="left">Example:&nbsp; Press &quot;[1&quot; to record macro #1, and
