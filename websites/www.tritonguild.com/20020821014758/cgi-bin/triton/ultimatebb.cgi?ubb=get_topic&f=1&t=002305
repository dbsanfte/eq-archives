ks'es and trains a group ?)<BR>his reply on rudeness:<BR>[Fri Jul 05 04:43:30 2002] Gruntath says out of character, 'yes kempodo but i am australian and it is in my culture to be rude'<P>The clerik from Gruntath group tell:<BR>[Fri Jul 05 04:43:02 2002] Trueheal tells you, 'just so you know man, I was invited here to heal them and didn't even know which camp we were headed to. I did no KSing, only healing, and I finally convinced them to just leave the camp.'<BR>[Fri Jul 05 04:44:40 2002] Trueheal tells you, 'I just wanted to make sure you didn't think I was a KSer just because I came here with them...'<BR>(ask gruntath who was the clerik with them if you do not believe this message and ask clerik online if he did say what you see in front of you)<BR>So even CLERIK FROM THEIR GROUP admitted to the ks'ing and said he's sorry, why?! why ks?!<P>[Fri Jul 05 04:45:48 2002] Katriza tells the group, 'just get a tell from grugath telling me he will veto on all my triton apps for the future on :P'<BR>(at the same time gruntath still raving and threatening everyone in group for WHAT? no idea)<P>[Fri Jul 05 05:14:38 2002] [ANONYMOUS] Armylenn  <Blades of Law><BR>[Fri Jul 05 05:14:38 2002] [60 Crusader] Gruntath (Dwarf) <Triton><BR>[Fri Jul 05 05:14:38 2002] [59 Templar] Trueheal (High Elf) <Inverse Logic><BR>[Fri Jul 05 05:14:38 2002] [60 Virtuoso] Kilthara (Wood Elf)<BR>[Fri Jul 05 05:14:38 2002] [60 Warlord] Krash (Ogre) <Triton><BR>[Fri Jul 05 05:14:38 2002] [60 Grave Lord] Silrea (Dark Elf)<BR>[Fri Jul 05 05:14:38 2002] [59 Templar] Aokage (High Elf) <Mattari><BR>[Fri Jul 05 05:14:38 2002] [58 Knight] Crea (High Elf) <Mattari><BR>[Fri Jul 05 05:14:38 2002] [60 Crusader] Oguma (Half Elf) <Mattari><BR>[Fri Jul 05 05:14:38 2002] [ANONYMOUS] Supli  <Saint Rose Universitas><BR>[Fri Jul 05 05:14:38 2002] [60 Warder] Tubura (Wood Elf) <Saint Rose Universitas><BR>[Fri Jul 05 05:14:38 2002] [60 Sorcerer] Takeru (High Elf) <Saint Rose Universitas><BR>[Fri Jul 05 05:14:38 2002] [60 Phantasmist] Corseil (High Elf) <Unleashed><BR>[Fri Jul 05 05:14:38 2002] [60 Oracle] Katriza (Barbarian) <Riding Insanity><BR>[Fri Jul 05 05:14:38 2002] [ANONYMOUS] Dordolin  <Wayward Souls of the Lost><BR>[Fri Jul 05 05:14:38 2002] [60 Hierophant] Liliput (Halfling) <Firestormers><BR>[Fri Jul 05 05:14:38 2002] [60 Grandmaster] Kempodo (Unknown) <Firestormers><BR>[Fri Jul 05 05:14:38 2002] There are 17 players in Cazic-Thule.<BR>^people in CT, my group: corseil, katriza, dordolin, liliput, kempodo, silrea<BR>the ks' group: armylenn, gruntath, kilthara, krash, trueheal, auria<P>Welp, I really hope this behavior of ks'ing, training and utter rudeness does not represent Triton as a whole and in reality Triton officers do not 'laugh at some 2k2??' about rudeness, ks'ing and training. <BR>Thank you for your attention.<P>--------------------<P><A HREF="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=178642" TARGET=_blank>kempodo(Sensei)</A>

Kempodo, you're a fucking tard and always have been, you've successfully fucked up your reputation with practically everyone on Povar. If Gruntath hadnt been there to fuck you around, I would have gladly done the job.<P>As for your whining about him not doing a good job of training you, I'm sure you could offer him some lessons. You know, teach him how to train Klandicar on an ENTIRE FUCKING RAID PREP and work his way up from there. (i am first to engage klandicar :>) The funny shit is you weren't even KOS to Klandicar at the time, it takes special effort to agro the fucker and then run him on us.<P>And don't claim I'm defending Gruntath. Gruntath and I do not like each other ; however, we both share a strong hatred of fucking idiots like yourself.<P>--------------------<P>Master Brodie, Emissary of Magic<BR>MC Hammer of Team Ice<BR>Triton<BR> <IMG SRC="http://www.tritonguild.com/brodiesketch.jpg"> <BR>http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=122612

i wasn't gonan respond but now i will. <P>the scenario was such that we had the camp comfortably held by an australian enchanter by the name of ayria for a good 15 minutes.  This has been confirmed by gm's. <P> Me krash and a couple of other off peak friends cruised over, as we were bout to head down a nice train from kempodo's group to zone in, admittedly it was accidental so didn't bother us at all, killed our cleric but that happens.  we headed down after ressing the cleric and fractions of a second sooner kempodo had taken our camp.  <P>Look i would of been happy to share but kempodo left out any number of tells from him to me commenting about how our group couldn;t handle the camp anyways etc etc.  About how he was sick of triton bastards pushing around little people, and many other meaningless rants.  i mean lets be serious  like we ever even fucking do any of that.  So me n krash kill a few mobs to show that we can quite comfortabley handle the area.  After a while i get bored of kempodo and katriza constant purpkle spam and in frustration i did say what it says above.    <P>Now lets get something clear, i never use the fucking guild tag in arguments.  Not in close to 3 years of being in this guild have i done so.  Further more not in 3 years of being in this game have i ever been /reported for anything.  in fact on the whole i like to think i have a generally good reputation.  Kempodo on the other hand is reknowned for his immature playing style and his generally rude as fuck attitude.  <P>Finally his accusation of a train.  Well yes krash did over pull.  But lets be serious ladies and gentleman... A TRAIN IS NOT 4 MOBS.  I had DA up if he had of wanted a real train i surely could of given it to him.  In this apparent train me and our weizard died in killing these 4 mobs.  However kill these mobs we did without 1 casualty from kempodo's group.    <P>This is turning into a gabrianon novel I don;t need to further explain myself about this.  But you should all know there is two sides to every story.<P>--------------------<P> <IMG SRC="http://jeff.uwoguildz.com/images/screenshots/00119.jpg">

After a while i get bored of kempodo and katriza constant purpkle spam and in frustration i did say what it says above. <P>  <HR></BLOCKQUOTE><P>The zone in train was provided by Armylen last time i checked that wizard was in YOUR group (as far as zone in train goes)<BR>Noone died from YOUR train because liliput succed the group out as soon as i saw 5 mobs in front of me folowing YOU. <BR>Please post any comments made by ME to YOU/your GROUP mates about Triton and such.<BR>You KILL STOLEN M Y P U L L (as per PNP rule you'd be banned the second GM saw that happen but LUCKY YOU no gm was present), YOU TRAINED OUR GROUP and YOU insulted EVERYONE in my group. <BR>^post something proving me wrong I dare you, you ks'ing badmouther you.<P><BR>Iadar - this has NOTHING to do with you and your opinions are NOT welcome on this thread go make your own thread and flame me there as much as you want.<P>--------------------<P><A HREF="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=178642" TARGET=_blank>kempodo(Sensei)</A>

Dont be pissed w/ Grunt for showing "Triton Superiority".  Thats just the way it is on Povar.  If i can simply speak for Grunt here, i'll say this " HIM>you , US>them".  Enuff said.

ok so what i gather from al lthis is: <BR>it is ok for triton guildmember to ks and train and badmouth well thank you for the info i was not aware of such guild policies of triton like i said again there is no need to be RUDE like you are if you feel better being rude that's perfectly fine .. just not fine with me.<BR>ps: the only reason i came to post here was because gruntath is member of Triton and there were no GM 's available to witness his horrific activities i hoped to see him stop doing such actions in the future well if it's not possible and he keeps doing it i hope GM's will take action.

Why thank you Kempodo for helping me solve my problems! Now in return, I will help solve yours. Go find some industrial strength cleaners, mix them in a milk jugs, and chug them back.

<BLOCKQUOTE><font size="1" face="Verdana, Helvetica, sans-serif">quote:</font><HR>ps: the only reason i came to post here was because gruntath is member of Triton and there were no GM 's available to witness his horrific activities i hoped to see him stop doing such actions in the future well if it's not possible and he keeps doing it i hope GM's will take action. Thanks for your attention.<BR>pps:   <HR></BLOCKQUOTE><P>Ok, I just had to register to comment on this.  That is just too damn ironic Kempodo.  I can't count the number of times that you've trained me over the past year.  I even recall a time in KC over a year ago that my group was in LCY and you kept pulling from the back of it and I asked you to stop.  What did you do?  You ran off, grabbed a bunch of mobs and feigned at the feet of my cleric.  <P>Honestly, you have a lot of nerve to come here and try to put the shoe on the other foot.  Maybe you've finally learned from how your actions in the past have screwed up your reputation.  I'm still amazed how you haven't been banned yet.  <P>I'll leave you with one image to keep in mind about this whole thread...<P> <IMG SRC="http://members.cox.net/mnjcross/dude.jpg"> <P>Lokki
