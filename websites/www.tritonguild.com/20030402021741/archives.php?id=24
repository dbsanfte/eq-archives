              response to our demolition of Skyshrine and killing of Lord Yelinak 
              this Wednesday, Sontalak issued a declaration of war upon Triton, 
              for the unfair and cheesy death of his brother. Triton Command immediately 
              positioned satellites over Western Washes for surveillance and intelligence 
              gathering. The command 'fuck it let's just do it' was issues, and 
              the 133rd Triton Paratrooper Brigade was released.</font></b></p>

              brave paratroopers jumped from the sky, engaging the fire dragon 
              Sontalak. Knowing he stood no chance of winning, Sontalak zoned 
              in to ToV to rally his dragon brethren against us. Pfft, give us 
              a fucking break gimp, zoning away from us? Negative on that one 
              Houston. We zoned in after him, dropping his ass inside of ToV.</font></b></p>

              he's a scary mother fucker, kinda looks like that STD Root keeps 
              spreading to unsuspecting Froglocks, nasty shit. Sontalak put up 
              a hell of a fight, but like I said above, what chance did he stand 
              against our paratrooper unit? None at all my friends, none at all. 
              Drops were KILLER, Congratulations to Rotkiw on his ST key, and 
              8 spells... WOOT!<br>
              <br>
              Surprise Surprise! Guess who we ganked again, that's right... Lord 
              Yelinak got spanked once again like a school girl. As a tribute 
              to the GMs who believed we really did drown Yelinak, I will present 
              to you this weeks tactics for killing the old senile bastard. Through 
              out the week we've been feeding Yelinak high cholesterol, high fat 
              foods to increase his chance of heart failure, sure enough it worked, 
              within three days we gave Yelinak a heart attack. Krohn and I just 
              happened to be walking by to collect the loot.</font></b></p>

              coin purses, one of which went to Zaar since he likes walking around 
              with a purse for some reason. After Yelinak died we moved on to 
              ST, cleared out all the golems, resulting in two primal warswords. 
              Moved on to the first warder and kicked some fucking ass.</font></b></p>

              VP this weekend, but really who cares about VP anymore, the zone 
              is about as hard as Guk now days. Have some bad ass videos lined
