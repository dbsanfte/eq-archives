<p><font face=Verdana size=2>Yah yah, everyone had low attendance tonight.. Of course they did, who can resist waiting 2 extra hours for the divx rip of the fight when you could waste $55 bucks to either see a) Tyson win in 2 rounds and totally flip out or b) The fight go more then 2 rounds, Tyson lose, then flip out and rob a 7-11 or something. Well enough about Tyson, we had a rough night.. 3 Total coffin wipes in Vex Thal.. Gaters, Pathing, Traps.. you fucking name it and we dealt with it. So instead of posting l33t pics of Aten ha ra dead, I'm gonna post some pics of well pets. Ya pets. Here they are in all there glory. </font></p>

<p><font face=Verdana size=2>We have also decided to open up cross server applications for Mages, I mean we're horny for level 60 mages that play like, everymotherfuckinggoddamnday. We'll give you a Vex Thal key, we'll gear you up.. you just need to know your role and own a watch that tells the correct time. ( On a side note, I do love the mages that we have ) If interested contact me at eq_zaar@hotmail.com with all the info you know I want to know. Also we're still looking for warriors / rogues / monks and are going through the apps we have. Just make sure you don't suck and we might consider you.</p>
