<font face=verdana size=2>Just bored, nothing really good to update about.. we're farming, pissing around with some new stuff. Did I mention farming? Anyways I saw it around today on alot of pages about low number Fennin kills, so figured what the hell, could post ours as well. We knew he had to be made harder, but we figured posting this wouldn't have helped~ Old Fennin, killed with 36..was flawless too.. There are 40 in the SS but 4 people were zzzz afk at the picnic tables. This was the 5am raid where I plooted my Fire Crested Rune ;)</font><br>
