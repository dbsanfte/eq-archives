              followed in the footsteps of Queen Dicksock by posting a flame against

              pull VP there's a couple people we let pull... Nene, our wizard 
              who once repeated the stats of her epic 40 times before she realized 
              we were leading her on, is NOT one of these. Some how, she stealthed 
              through the awareness of the guild and called for incoming mobs.... 
              This is the last time Nene is ever allowed to pull again, fucking
