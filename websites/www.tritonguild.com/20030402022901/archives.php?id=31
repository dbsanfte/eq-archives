So once again we find Giantt absent on some vacation leaving myself to update our webpage.. The guild fears my lame updates. The public fears my lame updates. I fear my lame updates... but my friends.. unlike my new VP bind spot ( thx 11 chain deaths ), this update shall be a good one!
<p align= left ><b><font face= Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif  size= -1 >
Up until this weekend we had been a little burned out on raiding.. It happens to the best of guilds where a little bit of a slump can set in. I mean killing Yelinak can eventually become as boring as killing trak. The routine gets to be the same old, same old. Last weekend we cleaned Sleepers cept the last 2 warders. Dropping the second warder for the first time. I can't remember all the loots from the trip but I know we picked up about 7 primal weapons, caster mask, that 4/12 caster stick and some other shit. The fight with the second warder lasted about 10 mins with our party of 25 and was one of our best fights to date. Unfortunetly I don't have any screenshots...

Later in the week we offed the new 'unslowable cazic', like it even made a difference. Vlade and Seugor picked up a <a href= http://www.gameznet.com/eq/equipment/bileetchedobsidianchoker.html >Bile Choker</a> and a cleric picked up the crown.

People were fairly slack other then CT but we did manage to accomplish 2 things on the side. Bentos getting an item named after him and Lenen finishing the first step 7 of the Shawl quest serverwide.

Now to end off this weeks slump what do we do? I mean what could possibly end this slacker ass attitude? How about clearing VP, Killing that slut King Tormax and taking the extra 20 mins to CoH to Yelinak for a quick gank? Thats exactly what we did..

<p align= left ><b><font face= Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif  size= -1 ><br>Well now a days VP just isn't what it used to be. This trip we managed to pick up 3 decent items. Qalwen, whom hates VP more then anyone in Triton by far, walked away with a <a href= http://www.gameznet.com/eq/equipment/robeoftheazuresky.html >Robe of the Azure Sky</a>. Frank walked off with a <a href= http://www.gameznet.com/eq/equipment/shieldofelders.html >Shield of Elders</a> and Rikioh picked up a <a href= http://www.gameznet.com/eq/equipment/bostaffoftrorsmang.html >Bo Staff of Trorsmang</a>. All in all VP went smooth cept our first PD gate but like always we showed her who's boss.

Thats right folks, after clearing VP we went and killed that cocksucker King Tormax. Finally we dropped this guy and props to everyone present! Bentos and Saolor picked up 2 phat ass Tranix.. err <a href= http://www.gameznet.com/eq/equipment/crownofthekromzekkings.html > Crown of the Kromzek Kings</a>. Irontaail walked away with the <a href= http://www.gameznet.com/eq/equipment/wristguardofthunder.html > kick ass monk bracer</a> and Kastrina looted Tormax's head for some damn nice boots. Without delay, or any communist plots ( ugh G I hate updating come back! ) we crossed a zone and buffed for Yelinak. The result? Same as always... Grats to Bentos on Gaunts, Dreadwar on some sword and whoever won the other stuff ( 2 rings / neckpiece ).

Anyways, I'm sure I forgot some shit like always and yah I'm sorry I don't make references to the California Raisons involved in some Communist plot to give King Tormax a wedgy, you'll just have to wait till Giantt gets back for that.. On to the Screen Shots!</font></b></p>
