      it owned, totally flawless fight.  That's not what I'm going to 
      complain about though because I love this encounter.  In my opinion 
      the HP fight is one of the best fucking fights in EQ at the moment.  
      It totally shows if you and your guild can work as separate teams for a 
      common goal.  We can!  That's not the problem.</font><p>
      <font face=Verdana size=2>The fucking problem is killing this bitch of 
      a mob (and no matter how you look at it, HP is a bitch!), going to loot 
      the corpse, and finding a caster weapon!  What the hell is this shit?  
      My guess is it was bring your daughter or son to work day and the kids 
      made up the loot for this encounter.  Now you're probably saying, 
      'Rombus you fucking stuck up uber loot whore, why are you complaining!?'  
      Here's why:<br>

      <p><font face=Verdana size=2>C'mon now, why must we plug mobs up with 
      uber^uber^ god damn caster weapons?  WHY!?  It was cool on the 
      Staff of the Silent Star in North, but the answer to making casters feel 
      all warm and snuggly on these encounters IS NOT BY PUTTING FUCKING WEAPONS 
      USABLE ONLY BY CASTERS ON THE MOBS!  If I wanted to melee and cast 
      spells I think I would have made a Ranger or a Bard... seriously, putting 
      caster weapons on uber mobs is like putting Brodie with a women, it's just 
      not right man!!!  Faldarith god the dagger, Solvan got the FT6 shield.  Grats!</font></td>

<p><b><font face=Verdana size=5>Smooth Move of the Week:</font></b></p>
<p><font face=Verdana size=2>Oh, here's another rant for you.  I'm 
going to try not to make this long, but I do feel something needs to be said.  
For the past two days one of our Wizards has been camping the broken golem in 
Fear.  He died NINE times and went from full 60 to a blue in.  He's 
been caught up on this god damn piece for around SIX MONTHS.  </font></p>
<p><font face=Verdana size=2>So it's Sunday morning, another guild decides 
they want to come into Fear and clear it, no big deal.  Broken golem pops 
and they declare that it's theirs!  After trying to talk to Nilsar for some 
time (which proved to be fucking useless because he can't comprehend the 
difference between reservation and lists) he finally tells me that it's a FFA 
game.  Fine, NP.  In the end they lie on the petition (they saw our 2 
monks train them!  Except... we had 1 Monk in Fear who was FD at ledge as 
his main was mezzing mobs), Bauldirr gets rolled back, and we get made to look 
like the bad guy because someone couldn't respect the fact that another person 
had been camping a mob for two days straight.  Hrm, I hope you guys camp 
Ragefire because my Cleric needs his epic and that same respect you showed us 
might get shown to you.  You've set a wonderful precedent this fine day.  
Moral of the story?  Petition against an uber guild and you're always 
right.  Thanks for the bang-up customer service job...</font></p><br></font><BR></td></tr>
