<p><font face=Verdana size=2>I won't even take the time to point out the 
grammatical errors in those broadcasts.  In any case, Team Triton totally 
dominated this contest.  Team Rising Ascension faced Team Riding Insanity 
for an 18/7 kill in favor of Team RA.  Zaar's team, Team Super Jobober 
(a.k.a. Team Raped by Movelog), was then raped by Team Triton in an 18/0 kill in 
favor of Team Triton.  Man, that hurt...</font></p>
<p><font face=Verdana size=2>Finally, Team Triton went up against Team RA.  
The final results of the battle were RA Losses - 18, Triton Losses 1.  Now 
we wouldn't have lost any if a certain Monk hadn't exploited his Abashi's Rod 
thus killing our Druid, Archie.  It should have been a flawless victory, it 
just wasn't fair!  They had to many people on Archie and were somehow 
exploiting player vs. player interaction and that's what causes his death.  
IT SHOULD HAVE BEEN FLAWLESS! (You'd understand that if you were in the arena at 
the time of the Triton victory.  All in good fun.
