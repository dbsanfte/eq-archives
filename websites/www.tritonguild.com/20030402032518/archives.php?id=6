              infiltrated Mr. T's Russian Compound early Saturday morning in retaliation 
              to the A-Team's hostile take over of the Triton Website. Tear gas

              out the suspects. Mr. T was arrested and returned to Federal Prison 
              on charges of Computer Terrorism. Zaar, leader of the United Republic 
              of Triton released this statement after the assault.<br>

<b><FONT face='Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif' size=-1>Thanks for the statement Zaar... That did us a lot of good, you should write your own fucking editorial column. Now on to what's going on this weekend. With it being St. Patrick's day weekend, we're a bit short of the classes needed to do some serious raiding (Fucking clerics, POSERS! All of you.) We hit up the two biggest gimps of VP last night, Silverpuss and Dykegoz for some quick and easy loot.

<br>
<br>
              Silverpuss dropped <a href=http://www.gameznet.com/eq/equipment/ss/scimitaroflifestealing.jpg>'The' 
              Scimitar of Life Stealing</a>, which was given to Krellyk for being 
              the bad ass mother fucker he is. <a href=http://www.gameznet.com/eq/equipment/ss/bluedflowerkatana.jpg>A 
              Flower Power Katana of Homosexuality</a> (Fuck you you fucking EQVault 
              whores) given to Synphony. And last but not least <a href=http://www.gameznet.com/eq/equipment/ss/dragon_spine_staff.jpg>'The 
              Nature Boys Stick of Thx Destroy'</a>, fucking druid bullshit.<br>

<br>

<br>
<br>
That mother fucking cock whore dumb fuck Dykegoz dropped two of 
              the biggest ass raming piece of shit dildo tossing pussy <a href=http://www.gameznet.com/eq/equipment/ss/solistrobeofinvocation.jpg>wizard 
              robes</a> known to man. Congratulations to those two asshole mother 
              fuckers Intelligent and Shakwon. Dykegoz then went on to put out 
              a piece of pubic tongue spam gimp shit homosexual <a href=http://www.gameznet.com/eq/equipment/ss/malevolentruneblade.jpg>Malevolent 
              Ruined Blade</a> which went to Heka. The dumb fuck's last drop was 
              the bull shit cow fuck red robbin flaming prostitute's bane of boat 
              sex, also known as the <a href=http://www.gameznet.com/eq/equipment/ss/lefteyeofxygoz.jpg>Left 
              eye of Dykegoz</a> which was won by Rombus.<br>


<br>
              You see, I'm that much cooler now that I just cussed over twenty 
              times in one paragraph. For those of you who DON'T understand, and 
              continue to post in the name of god on EQVault and the EQForums, 
              this is entertainment. If you don't like it, peace the fuck out 
              because you're wasting my bandwith. And even though Mr. T did hack 
              us, I'm going to leave his update because I'm too lazy to rewrite 
              that. No real screen shots from today other than myself giving Nene 
              a hard time about getting her epic. <font color=#FF0000>Congratulations 
              NENE on your Wizard epic!</font> Only took 40 phin kills.<br>

<b>Finally at this point Nene caught on, she stopped responding 
              to any more stat requests. Six times I got the stats out of her 
              over three minutes. The whole guild was cracking up and laughing 
              their fucking asses off at Nene. She just didn't catch on... Anyway 
              Congratulations you idiot bahaha ;)<br>

              Before I post the screen shots, I checked on our server stats yesterday 
              and Jesus Christ where have all of you come from? We used to get 
              about 2000 hits a week, the past three weeks we've been averaging 
              20,000+ hits a week. MADNESS! Post something on the board too with 
              what you'd like to see on the page, what would make Triton's site 
              even MORE enjoyable than it is now? Want more screen shots? More 
              Content? More contests? More fucking with guild member's heads like 
              nene? LET ME KNOW SUCKAS! Post on the forum.</b><p>
