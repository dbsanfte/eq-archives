              <b><font face=Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif size=-1>Well, I was 
              out this weekend while the crew was tearing apart Norrath. So all 
              information here is not first hand, in fact it was given to me by 
              a pack of communist smurfs secretly living under Las Vegas. This 
              weekend was the raid which causes the greatest amount of Triton 
              trial drop outs - Veeshan's Peak. See, in VP is this real fucking 
              dick named Hoshkar, who happens to get off on *really* kicking our 
              asses. Not this time buddy, thank you for flying Russian Airlines, 
              Hoshkar - get the fuck off the plane.</font></b></p>

              wasn't just killed, he was literally destroyed in twenty seconds. 
              Loot off of Hosh wasn't too bad - Luluaya picked up a <a href=http://www.gameznet.com/eq/equipment/ss/feverblade.jpg>Feverblade 
              - Bane of Duels</a>, Moran jacked a pair of <a href=http://www.gameznet.com/eq/equipment/ss/greysuedeboots.jpg>Grey 
              Sued Boots</a>, and last Triton's most disruptive and bastard of 
              a member Wolfherz picked up a <a href=http://www.gameznet.com/eq/equipment/ss/bladeoffallingstars.jpg>Blade 
              of Fallen Stars</a>. After Hoshkar was killed, the guild took a 
              two hour break to drink themselves in to next week. Rumor has it 
              Root, Rombus, and Elrood had a bit too much and started offering 
              lap dances for 15 plat - fucking freaks.</font></b></p>

              That sums up our fun in Veeshan's Peak, see you again in a few weeks 
              Hoshbaby. Before VP on Thursday was the gankage of the worthless 
              Skyfire dragon Talendor. Only thing worth listing is the CoF which 
              went to Rikioh, grats gimp. Then there was a Klandicar ganking tonight 
              - leaving Krellyk with his Sleeper's Tomb key. Congrats ya gimp. 
              Well guys, I wasn't there so sorry I can't give you any good screen 
              shots, or super secret Triton information. Be happy we found that 
              pack of communist smurfs for this much! Peace out -- Giantt<br>
