Well folks, some peeps been asking about an update and Rombus won't have one up till tomorrow so I thought I would post this pic taken at the last Triton gathering of Team Ice with Team Estro.
<br><br>
From the top (left to right)we have Team Ice. Rombus, Brodie, Astennu, Elrood and Minael. Missing from the pic are Nuvian, Nurben and Shakwon. They were busy honing there Latino dance moves when this pic was taken at some bar called BoyZ Town. Bottom of the pic we have Team Ice's bitches Team Estro (left to right)Adie, Brownivy, Oishii and Kotori. Some are prolly missing, but Team Ice don't care, they all the same to them.

One more quick thing, I'm getting pretty sick of seeing peeps asking for tricks and tactics in our forums, and since Rombus already gave away our tactics on how we draw maps for encounters, I present the following: Our true secret weapon in EQ... ( Thank you Bentos for introducing us all to this btw, we love you bro )
