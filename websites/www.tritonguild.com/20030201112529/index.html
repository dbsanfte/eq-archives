<p><font face=Verdana size=2>Okay fools, listen up. At the moment, it has been decided that the server Povar is absolutely 100% devoid of any talent. Seriously, we got all the good players. From this point on we will ONLY be recruiting cross server. So if you had any hopes and dreams of one day being in Triton, I hate to break your heart, but it's not happening.</font></p>
<p><font face=Verdana size=2>At this time we are looking for 3 druids and 1 bard. What do we require? Nothing short of being flagged for Elemental planes and having a truckload of AA points. Now surely Zaar, you must be on crack because anyone in the Elemental planes must already be in a great guild..  Well let me be really blunt on this next one.. We're better then your guild. Deal with it.</font></p>
<p><font face=Verdana size=2>Now since you would be leaving an already established guild, I can tell you the following. We will suit you up, we'll finish your spellbooks and above all else you will get to be part of the funnest guild in all of Everquest. I mean, you don't have to take my word for it, check these testimonials from some of our other cross server transfers:</font></p>

<p><font face=Verdana size=2>Trends. We all know what they are, some of us are trend followers, some of us are trend setters and then there are the folks that just flat out despise trends. Well my friends, I, your host, despise trends. I just don't care for em. I especially don't care for this latest trend I've been seeing popping up on all these other guild websites. See competition is so fierce now that it's no longer cool to brag about how big your collective guild shlong is, it would appear it's now cool to talk about how you DON'T have a big shlong, and it's just another day for your guild. I mean who brags that they have a small dick? Seriously? It even gets to the point of being absurd when the headline is something like 'yea, we don't got a big shlong like all those other guilds, we just walked in and killed it with 30 people on our first try with 2 clerics and bill was 2 boxed by a monkey'. </font></p>

<p><font face=Verdana size=2>So not only am I , Zaar Deth'Mortis of the BEST FUCKING GUILD IN EXISTENCE, gonna fucking wave my shlong around and tell you that we triggered the Fennin event for the first time tonight, ever, on Povar with 60 people... NOT ONLY did we win with ZERO, yes ZERO deaths.. I'm gonna go one step further.. I'm gonna SHOW YOU THE GIANT SHLONG THAT RUNS THE EQ UNIVERSE.. </font></p>

I don't have all the mob ss but let me just say.. we've cleaned just about all the planes save for their gods and tonight was the first time we had even tried one.</font></p>

<p><font face=Verdana size=2>Alright so now that you can see that, literally, Triton has the largest shlong out there, I have to tell you this story, cuz it's actually pretty funny. I had just gotten back from the doctor regarding a medical procedure to get my Shlong size reduced, and I was in a little pain from some testing they were doing and I was all like <b>'owwwwwwwww'</b> when one of my friends that is over mentions maybe I should look up some info on the web regarding the procedure. Immidietly I thought.. good fucking idea man.. so I put the words <b>Huge, Shlong, Exploit</b> into google ( obviously I had meant exploit to mean, taking on a task, ya know, an exploit, it's no small deal to undergo a procedure on your 24 inch penis ) and the most fucked up thing happened. Get this, I'm not kidding either.. the #1 hit was a fucking Everquest Guild Webpage.. can you believe it? Neither could I. </font></p>
<p><font face=Verdana size=2>So anyways, apparently it was a guild I had never heard of, as I only really follow the better guilds in EQ, I believe it was Magiter(sp?) or something like that. Anyways, check this out, whoever there updater was, well he was insulting me! ME! of all people.. and to refer to my top comment about trends, after reading his updates, seemed like he's right up there on the scoreboard! Well anyways, in dedication to him and the fact that he seems to think Fennin is some big whoopdefuckingdo over Hydrotha... I bring you live, from the Triton webpage:</font></p>

How could you say I'm a coke snorting necro and not mention that I wear a tinfoil hat when I play EQ? Man Koryo, if You and Sdari were both in the same room and I said 'Would the retard please leave the room', I'd have to admit, even Sdari might stay sitting down with you beside him, and that says alot.</font></p>
