<br><p><font face=Verdana size=2>I promised myself I would spend more then 30 mins doing this update, so go get a pepsi or something, maybe go take that piss you been waiting to take but <i>just wanted to check quick if a new update was up</i>. Obviously this one is going to start with a Plane of Time update.<center>

<br>
<p><font face=Verdana size=2>The hole in the picture above is basically the door from trials 1 to trials 2. I'd like to request a favor from the devs before I continue. PLEASE make it so that once the text starts the timer stops. You have no idea what it's like when you're waiting for the doors to open and there is ONE more line of text from Saryrn and BZZZZT you're ported out.</font></p>

<p><font face=Verdana size=2>The 2 SS above are some shots from the third wave. We beat that tonight for the first time and took a crack at Terris Thule with our army of 40 and we got our asses handed to us. We'll be back tomorrow night and from the looks of things we'll probably be spending 90% of our time in this zone from now on.</font></p>

<p><font face=Verdana size=2>The next order of business is <b>recruitment</b>. We have reached a point in the game where unfortunetly 50 people a night is not cutting it. We'd love to brag about doing shit with low numbers but it only goes so far. If we need 70 people on every night just so we don't have to sit there waiting for that desperatly needed 9th cleric for 3 hours, then so be it.</font></p>
<p><font face=Verdana size=2>To aid in the application process Rombus has completely redefined the application process. Basically for the first time in the history of this webpage, it actually works now. Now if my memory serves me, at one point I said we were no longer recruiting on povar because there were no more good players. Well I'm doing a 180, atm we're ONLY recruiting ON povar. We'll just teach you how to play your class, thats all ;) So to all of you people on Povar that are Elemental flagged and want to be a member of one of the greatest guilds to ever play this game, then fill out an app or send me a tell in game. Don't fool yourself into thinking you're playing the 'end game' atm, because you're not. We are though, and Everquest isn't getting any newer. Triton will always live on, even into other games, and we want the very best, most hardcore players to be on our team. So basically and very bluntly, any of you BoL, RA or FU that are interested, let me know.</font></p>
<b><p><font face=Verdana size=2>For example, this ring from Plane of Time Rots for us and thats after Random 1 1000ing for it but enough about recruiting~</font></p></b>

<p><font face=Verdana size=2>So anyways, we haven't had anything really funny or dramatic on the webpage lately and I've been desperately looking for ANYTHING to post about. Some people think I'm really immature when I post about stupid shit but I don't really give a fuck. I don't walk around calling my boss a fag or arguing with the boss from across the hall over who gets to use the photocopier first.. *ahem* anyways, all the EQ guild pages I read are pretty much the same thing, links to plane of time loot ( which is perfectly fine, you guys are motivational machines, my hats off to you ) but other then listening to Tork talk about shaving his sack it's all boring.</font></p>
<p><font face=Verdana size=2>So in the good spirit of drama and in getting a good laugh from serverdrama, I bring to you the following story...</font></p>

<b><p><font face=Verdana size=2>The biggest retard on povar...</font></p></b>
<p><font face=Verdana size=2>Ladies and Gentlemen, without further ado, I bring to you, the leader of Inverse Logic..</font></p>
<b><p><font face=Verdana size=10>ZENTIX</font></p>
<p><font face=Verdana size=10>'A day in the life of a super hero' ( A - non-sexist adventure story (tm)</font></p>

<p><font face=Verdana size=2>It was a crisp winter morning as the party set out from their camp in Sirens Grotto to the dreaded Temple of Veeshan. The journey hadn't been easy and gathering a group of people brave enough had not been a simple task. They counted nine in total. The party had been crippled even further by the addition of the two females but Zaar had no choice in the matter, he had to work fast, raid time would be approaching by nightfall and there was much to do.</font></p>
<p><font face=Verdana size=2>'Darcwolf, are we almost there?' the female enchanter whined quietly in the background as they walked through the snow.</font></p>
<p><font face=Verdana size=2>'Did you not just read what Zaar wrote? We JUST SET OUT FROM CAMP..ffs woman!' replied Darcwolf as his gaze met Zaars and they both shared a quiet chuckle at the thought of a female adventurer.</font></p>
<p><font face=Verdana size=2>After almost half a day of hiking and a few battles with some of the inhabiting creatures the party reached the entrance to the dreaded Temple of Veeshan. They had met up with the brave wizard Astennu along the way and he had agreed to join the group, knowing when he saw the two female gamers, that they would need all the help that they could get.</font></p>
<p><font face=Verdana size=2>Upon entering the dungeon, the brave team of nine began to surround themselves with magic, wards of ancient decent to protect themselves from the fierce inhabitants of the Temple. Once completed, the bravest of the group, Zaar, along with his sidekick Sallymanders the DevilWorshiper went to go lure the first dragon back to the group.</font></p>
<p><font face=Verdana size=2>'Uhhh what are you guys doing? It's our turn in rotation and we're gathering in one hour.. wh4t r U guYz D0inG?...' Zaar looked around, noticing a squeaky little voice from the corner of the room..</font></p>
<p><font face=Verdana size=2>Zaar walked over to the squeaky little noise, immidietly thinking it was another female player in trouble.. alas, it was the leader of Inverse Logic which shares the same common whiny voice - 'Hail, and well met fellow adventurer'- Zaar laughed at the feeble man 'we are but a group of nine friends, on a quest to slay some beast for fun and treasure, we know not of this rotation you speak of, nor do we care to abide by it, we shall be slaying the beast Ikitar the Venomed quite shortly, good day to you!'</font></p>

<p><font face=Verdana size=2>'UHM NO wAYz0R, ItZ OuR tuRN in Rotation and FuCK that.' The party was suddenly surprised to see dozens and dozens of people jump out from the shadows, beckening to there masters feeble call.. 'Do NOT D@RE trY to SlaY our MobZ0r or we Shalt Takz0r it frum U'</font></p>

<p><font face=Verdana size=2>Zaar and his party of adventures shared a laugh for about 10 minutes. Not quite sure if it was the look of this feeble man with a whiny voice or the fact that he actually thought they cared what he had to say. Ignoring him, Sallymanders and Zaar after careful trickery, lured the beast back to their group.</font></p>
<center>
<img border=0 src= http://www.tritonguild.com/images/drzaar1.jpg
></font></p>
</center>
<p><font face=Verdana size=2>Within seconds of engaging the horrific beast the brave group noticed dozens and dozens of other people smothering there creature to death with swords and magic, quickly dispatching of the beast that clearly had no chance against such an army.</font></p>

<img border=0 src= http://www.tritonguild.com/images/drzaar4.jpg
></font></p>
<p><font face=Verdana size=2>Again this feeble weakling whom would surely get punched out by a girl opened his mouth... 'Rotation...' he mumbled. Zaar quickly reached over and told Darcwolf to put his blade away and for Aribu to put the dagger down.. He went on to tell the female group members that the bad monster was gone and they could come out from hiding.</font></p>

<p><font face=Verdana size=2>'We do not understand these laws of Rotations', Zaar stared at the three foot midget Zentix ,'are these the laws of the universe, or some twisted laws that exist because you will them to exist? We lured this mob to our party of adventurers and yet you chose to kill it.. please explain your actions to myself and my party, we emplore you, that we only game here to have some fun... fun I tell you...'</font></p>

<img border=0 src= http://www.tritonguild.com/images/drzaar9.jpg
></font></p>

<p><font face=Verdana size=2>'I'm sorry little man, I have no use in showing you how big my *ahem* is', at the mere mention of Zaar's manhood the females in the group both blushed and started smiling, ' but I can assure you that my group of adventurers did in fact come here for fun. While only half listening to your mindless squeaking, I consulted the spirits on these rotations you speak of, and they have have answered me with this...'</font></p>

<img border=0 src= http://www.tritonguild.com/images/drzaar5.jpg
></font></p>

<p><font face=Verdana size=2>'So how do you explain this, my humble retard? Why even now, members of your group, or should I say army of adventurers are apologizing for your very own actions'</font></p>

<center>
<img border=0 src= http://www.tritonguild.com/images/drzaar10.jpg

></font></p>
<img border=0 src= http://www.tritonguild.com/images/drzaar12.jpg
></font></p>

<p><font face=Verdana size=2>The weak little man, Zentix, started to froth at the mouth as one of his minions pulled out a stool for him to stand on so he could look Zaar right in the eye.. 'Thats it Zaar, you and your party are an afront to everything evil, I shall tell the gods of your doing since nobody else cares to hear me whine.. and I am one of the biggest whiners of them all!'</font></p>

<img border=0 src= http://www.tritonguild.com/images/drzaar6.jpg
></font></p>

<p><font face=Verdana size=2>Zaar paused for a moment and looked around at his group, deciding they should just leave lest they waste more time.. but he did have one more thing to remind the little whiny man.. </font></p>

<p><font face=Verdana size=2>Even though it was no big deal you little fucking whiny bitch and I really don't care, we were just looking for something fun to do to kill a few hours, I do hold grudges and every time its your pissant guilds turn in rotation for Vex Thal or emp or whatever the fuck you clownboats kill, don't be surprised to see me and a few group of the daytime folk already cleared the shit. Immature, perhaps, demeaning for someone of my status, probably.. but I don't like you.. you're whole 'THE BIG GUY IS OUT TO GET ME' is fucking retarded. So like I said in ToV, we'll see you around.</font></p></b>
</center>
<p><font face=Verdana size=2>So anyways, that was fun, tell me that wasn't a good read? Come on, tell me! I guess I should get some work done as my boss keeps looking over and wondering why I keep smirking and until next time I'll leave some of the members with a brief glimpse of officer chat~</font></p>
