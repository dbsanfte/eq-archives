<p><font face=Verdana size=2>So I logged in to my fantasy world today to 
learn that we were going to tame the Avatar of War 'for fun.'  Apparently many of our 
members had developed 'Phatlewtitis' and could no longer continue farming our 
leet rings in Ssra.  We decided to take a break (you could actually hear the snakes 
breathe a sign of relief when the last Triton member zoned out) and accumulated 
our forces elsewhere.</font></p>
<p><font face=Verdana size=2>Enter, Kael.  Pulled Vindi - owned him 
(grats whoever on BP) and then we were trained with... err I mean pulled the 
Idol.  Of course we expected the same old slack Idol that was far from a 
challenge... what we expected was not what we got!  I hope VI fixed his 
agro issues because guess what ladies and gents, the Idol of Rallos was 
upgraded!  Not that I'm complaining, if you can't kill the Idol you're 
obviously not going to kill the Avatar of War.  We made quick work of him 
and then 
moved on to the Avatar of War.</font></p>

<img border=0 src=images/news/13April02/AoWHP.gif align=absmiddle width=116 height=35></p>
<p><font face=Verdana size=2>I have to say that this was actually an 
excellent fight.  We had around 60ish people there and we really did tare 
this bitch a new one... </font><font face=Verdana size=2>well... until about 
30%.  </font></p>
<p><font face=Verdana size=2>Ever have one of those fights where you're 
doing awesome and then all of the sudden something really shitty happens and you 
lose control?  Get this... not one, not two, but three of our tanks died 
due to the CH bug that wasn't important enough to fix with an emergency patch.  
Needless to say at around... oh... 0% life the Avatar of War started to actually 
win.  We honestly thought it was over but we got back in control and showed 
this bitch that we WERE NOT LEAVING <b>OUR SPAWN</b> WITHOUT OUR <b>PHAT LEWT</b>!  
Alas,
<a target=_blank href=images/news/13April02/AoWkillme.gif>
poor Rommy did not live through the fight</a>.  With our lewt whore, spawn 
owning, asshole egos feeling fulfilled we promptly left Kael (but not before 
training the WL and EW zones with red con mobs while simultaneously training the 
outer WL zone / EW lines with Wuoshi and Ry'Gorr Avengers, HAHA!  Arrogant 
ubers~) in search of more lewt... or snakes.</font></p>
<p><font face=Verdana size=2>PS: Grats Gomar on the Flayed Barbarian Skin 
Mask.  Grats Callili and Arma on the Rings of Destruction.</font></p>

<p><font face=Verdana size=2>Unfortunately for our members our time in Ssra 
is drawing to a close.  I know most of us are crying (tears of joy) at the

<p><font face=Verdana size=2>That just about draws my update to a close.  
I really don't know what to say at the moment... so I'll just let my quotes do 
the talking for me!  Oh, /hug Povar... I lub joo all - really!  I hope 
you guys saw the humor in my update, really it's all in good fun. :p  LoL</font></p>
