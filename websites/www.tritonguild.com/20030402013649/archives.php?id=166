<p><font face=Verdana size=2>Okay fools, listen up. At the moment, it has been decided that the server Povar is absolutely 100% devoid of any talent. Seriously, we got all the good players. From this point on we will ONLY be recruiting cross server. So if you had any hopes and dreams of one day being in Triton, I hate to break your heart, but it's not happening.</font></p>
<p><font face=Verdana size=2>At this time we are looking for 3 druids and 1 bard. What do we require? Nothing short of being flagged for Elemental planes and having a truckload of AA points. Now surely Zaar, you must be on crack because anyone in the Elemental planes must already be in a great guild..  Well let me be really blunt on this next one.. We're better then your guild. Deal with it.</font></p>
<p><font face=Verdana size=2>Now since you would be leaving an already established guild, I can tell you the following. We will suit you up, we'll finish your spellbooks and above all else you will get to be part of the funnest guild in all of Everquest. I mean, you don't have to take my word for it, check these testimonials from some of our other cross server transfers:</font></p>
