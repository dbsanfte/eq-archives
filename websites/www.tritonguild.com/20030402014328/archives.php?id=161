<p><font face=Verdana size=2><i>Edit : LoL it only took Furor 1 quick day to put up on FoH that it's been gimped.. god it's like I'm a mind reader... geezus FoH is l33t.. like I said in the past, uphill through the snow... Wait a minute... FoH didn't try RZ after the patch.. how would you know if anything changed with him? Ohhh wait a minute, you don't have a <b>fucking clue I forgot...</b> It's fun to belittle other people's accomplishments though! I mean really, since Afterlife had the bug first run, and us, SH and HnE got the gimped version that means FOH FOH FOH FOH FOH FOH only killed the hard one!! hahaha </i></font></p>

<p><font face=Verdana size=2>First things first, Rallos Zek is dead.</font></p>

<p><font face=Verdana size=2>Before I get into bashing other people, hurting people's feelings and what have you, I'd just like to take a moment to give my guys props for this encounter. Man we fucking went at this thing soooo many days straight. If something could go wrong it would and did, 2 or 3 times a night. We actually only fought RZ himself 4 times out of all those runs with our last run being 33%. Not a single bane either. So for everyone that kept showing up day after day to the tune of <i>'we got this guys, we got a new plan'</i>, I salute you! Also I just have to make it very clear, that nobody anywhere touches our enchanter crew ;)</font></p>

<p><font face=Verdana size=2>Since it's a hot topic as well, let me mention a few things before they come up in some stupid post somewhere. RZ was not changed at all, infact the encounter has remained the exact same since Afterlifes very first win, save for a bug with VZ and the event not despawning properly afterwords. So if anyone with an ego bigger then mine actually starts crying about it, it's BS =P</font></p>

<p><font face=Verdana size=2>Congrats to Heaven and Earth for killing him tonight as well and all the other guilds that have killed him so far, it's quite a feat imo :)</font></p>
<br>

<p><font face=Verdana size=4>Pictures below for you to study and devise a strat from..</font></p>

<p><font face=Verdana size=2>Although this might be disclosing part of our super awesome strat, I feel that Kastrina should get an honorable mention as key strategist for drawing me the following diagram after our first RZ run.</font></p>

<p><font face=Verdana size=2>Anyways, again I want to say thanks and congrats to my guys who put up with this shit for the last 2 weeks showing up every single day, especially when we made no progress for 3 days. GG!</font></p>
