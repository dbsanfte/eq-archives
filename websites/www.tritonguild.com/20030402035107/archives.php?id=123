<p><font face=Verdana size=2>Yes, we're still alive... just not much to post as of late. We haven't really done anything outside of Vex Thal, I think we popped out to do AoW one night but thats about it. I don't have any loot shots, we might have got some new stuff but most is posted elsewhere. Just the other night we finally killed Thall Va Kelun whom I must say is probably the longest fight we've ever participated in. We expect Aten dead by the end of the weekend... Here's a shot of what one of the easiest bosses hits for ;)

As far as some new screenshots, I do have some to post. Please make sure to enlarge them all, since they are all genuine screenshots. ( For up and coming Vex Thal guilds, these screenshots give you a great idea of what you have to look forward too!!</font></p>

<p><font face=Verdana size=2>I'd grats the people that got loot but for the life of me I have no idea who got what. The real congrats will prolly go out when some of this stuff gets a real upgrade ( the best part of looting the Thall was knowing the fight was actually over, garbage loot ).
<br>
<br>
I don't have any quote of the week shit, and wasn't gonna do an update until we got aten dead but this should suffice for a bit longer.. <br>
