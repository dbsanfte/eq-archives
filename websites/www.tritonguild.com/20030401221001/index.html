<font face=verdana size=2>Okay well obviously I'm gonna put a picture at the top, and start the update with simply saying, Xegony 2.0 is dead.</font><br>
<br>
<br>
<center>
<a href=http://www.tritonguild.com/images/feb242003/xeg.jpg><img src=/images/feb242003/xegsmall.jpg align=absmiddle  width=500 height =400></a>
</center>
<br>
<br>
<font face=verdana size=2>Now typically in my updates, I start off with talking shit about someone, some other guild, bash someone else, swear a little but unfortunetly for you folks that enjoy the updates for that reason, you're going to have to forgive me just this once. Now, before I go into great depth about why my guild is better then every other guild out there, I want to make sure all the other guilds that have beat Xegony 2.0 get theirs, so grats to FoH, Magister(still fags), Eternal Wrath as well as the combined forces of Caer Cadarn and Humdapoky. (If I didn't mention you, I didn't know! )</font><br>
<br>
<font face=verdana size=2>So anyways, where was I.. oh yah, why our guild is better then yours. Well let me start by saying we only beat the spider event 5 days ago in Air. We had only tried it once, that being the first week of being in the planes and we collectively said fuck this and went and farmed fire. 450 loots later, we went back and laughed at it with 42. So the next night, we went up to try Xegony.. we basically got schooled repeatidly. 97% best run. Next night? Spent a good 2 hours working through our strat, assigning groups ( a first for Triton ) and went again. Best run? 81%. Night 3, tonight. With 64 people to the tee, a combined DPS force of 4 rogues, 2 wizards, 2 mages and 5 rangers, 45 mins after starting, Xegony was dead at our feet. </font><br>
<br>
<font face=verdana size=2>Now I'd love to get into how intricate this fight is but I really don't want to ruin it. It is the absolute definition of ONE tiny mistake by ANYONE and you lose. It's that sweaty hands, shaking feeling when you even get her to 50% thinking that there is a glimmer of hope that the strat is working and you might actually pull this shit off. So for the guys that showed up tonight, after me pleading for attendance, you all did fucking incredible and I'm absolutely 100% proud of everyone for doing an excellent job.</font><br>
<br>
<font face=verdana size=2>Afterwords, we took 49 people to the absolute sad joke of a god Fennin and smoked him flawless, except for Rombus when he tried to race me to loot him at the end. Please note my greyed out harmshield~</font><br>

</center>
<br>
<br>
<font face=verdana size=2>Anyways, sorry there is nothing super funny here, I just really didn't want to take away from the accomplishment this is. 2 Down, 2 to Go. P.S. Rombus, you may now grammar check my update for Their, There and They're mistakes. P.S.S. We're thinking about taking a few X-server wizards with ele flags and high AA. Email me at EQ_Zaar@hotmail.com if you fit the bill.. AND WE STILL NEED A FUCKING BARD</font><br>
<br>
<font face=verdana size=2>With love, from Rombus~<br>

<font face=verdana size=2><b>Disclaimer : don't read this update if you are easily offended by swearing and bad taste. Also, this update is purely Povar shit, its our webpage, server drama is A-OK here, you don't like it, fuck off.</font><br></b>
<br>
<font face=verdana size=2>Anyways, I'd like to start with a joke, and I'll bring my point to light after it. Here goes : Q:Whats funnier then a dead baby? A:A dead baby in a clown suit.</font><br>
<br>
<font face=verdana size=2>Pretty tastless joke huh? I'm sure alot of you are going 'man Z, thats not funny in the least'. Let me explain. I'm simply trying to find a joke that is on par with the joke that is simply called <b>'Everquest Customer Service'</b>. Let me just say, that in the last 2 days I have lost all faith in CS and GM's and to be honest, I feel bad for the GM's that have helped in the past because the absolute disdain I hold for the GM's I've dealt with makes you good GM's look like the fucking retards your coworkers are.</font><br>
<br>
<font face=verdana size=2>So apparently I was in the dark about how all this stuff works. Moreso I think I simply underestimated how queer <b>Rising Ascension</b> could be. They seem to be reaching new heights every day. Now the quick version of the story ( and of course there are 2 sides to every story ) goes as follows : Sallymanders blows Carpin ( like we have been doing everyday for months so we can XP back there ). Sallys gets petitioned and warned. Okay so he got a warning, shit happens. Then he gets into a pissing match with some RA folk, they exchange verbal shit, ya know 'fuck you' 'you're a fag' typical shit. Some faggot from RA, decides to /report a screen with just 1 line from sally, apparently having an argument by himself. The result?</font><br>
<br>
<font face=verdana size=2><b>Sally is suspended for 2 weeks until 2/27 for, and I quote from Sally's phone call to CS 'Vulgarity'</font><br></b>
<br>
<font face=verdana size=2>So my question is, what KIND OF FUCKING BAD JOKE IS THIS.. 2 weeks? for vulgarity? If I've ever seen this system abused worse I can't recall.. so basically all I need to do is mouth off to someone that isn't a baby, and when they mouth off back I can report them and get them suspended? FOR TWO FUCKING WEEKS? Seriously, fix this, it's not even fucking funny. Maybe THREE days for swearing, but TWO WEEKS.. maybe you can't see how your faggot system got abused to their advantage but bust out one of the admins with more then a grade 3 education and a level 10 druid on test and fix this fucking shit.</font><br>
<br>
<font face=verdana size=2>As for you RA fags. Do we petition you, when you have Macc supersneak into fire through the solro pit and sit and watch us kill shit? Do we petition when he sits and watches us do earth rings? When you swear at us, do we whine to the nearest GM's? No we don't. So we play competitively. Man we can't even be in the same zone as you fucking babies without getting petitioned. All I can say to you is grow the fuck up. So laugh it up because you succeeded in somehow getting the stupidest GM alive with your latest petition, getting Sally suspended. We'll see you faggots around in game.</font><br>
