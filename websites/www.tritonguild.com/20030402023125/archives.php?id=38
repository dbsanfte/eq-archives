              July 17th, 5:10 A.M. pst, Mr. T of A-Team lead a malicious attack 
              against the Triton webservers in response to Rombus's first update. 
              Using A-Team's latest technology, the Jibba Jabba Virus, Mr. T was 
              able break through and manipulate our infrastructure, giving him 
              complete access to Triton's main page. Thursday morning Mr. T was 
              arrested by agents from the FBl's Computer Fraud Division, rumor 
              is he's now serving six to eight years. What can I say, Mr. T, <font color= #FF0000 >We 
              salute you! <font color= #000000 >Rest assured everyone, all 17 
              of you, Rombus has been placed with Zaar on the 'What ever 
              the fuck you do, never let them update the site EVER again'

              update, we owned the fuck out of Dozequeer the Nerfed. Our plan 
              was simple, train Mr. T from the PoM zone in to Dozequeer, let doz's 
              AE hit Mr. T, then get the fuck out of dodge. It goes with out saying, 
              Mr. T doesn't fuck around, Dozekar was schooled six ways from Sunday, 
              and twice on Thursday. Verant is smoking some really fucking good 
              crack nerfing Dozekar like this. He went from being Drushk's Daddy 
              to Sontalak's step daughter, no joking he's easier than it is getting 
              Root to go down on himself.</font></b></p>
