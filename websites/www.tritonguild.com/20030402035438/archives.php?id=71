<p><font face=Verdana size=2>Yes, we're finally back up and running.  I 
know the site is a little slow at times but oh well, deal with it.  Hrm, 
what did we do since last update?  Not to much, there wasn't much up to 
kill without a patch.  We did manage to clear North (almost twice thanks to 
the emergency patch).</font></p>

<p><font face=Verdana size=2>Vulak dropped some nice shit this time around 
(who am I kidding... does he really have a bad drop?!) including a Mryolkar's 
Dagger of Vengeance for Bentos, Valtron's Necklace of Wonder for Arma, and a 
Hobart's War Helmet for our resident buff bitch (and now HAMMER ENABLED) Lucann.</font></p>
<p><font face=Verdana size=2>Normally I wouldn't think twice about this, 
there isn't much to this piece of shit we call the leader of the Claws of 
Veeshan... but something strange and almost frightening happened after the 
Myrolokar dagger was awarded to Bentos, HE THANKED US!  Now instantly we 
all replied 'who is botting Bentos?' and to our surprise it was the real thing.

    That's right folks, there's more than meets the eye.</font></p>
    <p><font face=Verdana size=2>Obviously a ton of other shit dropped this

Our zerg forces are getting overworked so we needed to give them some time off 
to relax and possibly involve into a queen or something.  You see, we play 
the game for the soul purpose of impressing you!  Not for our own 
enjoyment, we're doing this for YOU!  Can you detect a bit of sarcasm, can 
you!?!?  Creep colonies working their way up to Yelinak and Tormax, news at 
11.~<br><br>Before I go I just want to let you know that I'm having a contest for the best Nurben clone you can make.  Login to Povar and create a Nurben clone (MUST be a Nome Enchanter with some kind of creative Nurben spinoff) then bug him and Brodie.  Take screenshots and <a href=mailto:rombus@graffe.com>email the results to me</a>.  Best one gets a spot on the sight. ;)</p></font>
