<br><p><font face=Verdana size=2>So anyways we finally ganked this clown... my hats off to everyone in the guild who slugged it out when attendance was shit for the past few months and we went from ganking shit in time, to ganking old content for something to do. I think we actually went through 3 or 4 recruting stages to get here, so again, to all the new members that helped make this shit happen and all the old timers, <b>thanks for sticking it out</b> and hopefully I'll still see at least 50% of your faces a month from now!

<br><p><font face=Verdana size=2>Now I do face one challenge to start this update.. normally I'm swinging my dick around bragging about this or that or how Triton is superior to all ( we are, what can I say? ) but I find myself at a loss, because I mean we're at least the 15th or so guild to gank Quarm.. I've used the frogloks things already... I've done the low numbers thing.. hell I've even put up a picture of my massive shlong.. so how can I boast... hmmmm.. I know how.. how about this...

<br><p><font face=Verdana size=2>.. We had <b>18</b> female gamers online for the win... yep, I'm dead fucking serious kids.. <b>Eight + Teen of em</b>.. <b>6+6+6</b>... unfucking real huh? So Thats right Afterlife, Thats right TR, LoL @ FoH... Yah you too Ascent, Darkwind and the rest of you mofaka's... take a deep breath and realize you will <i>NEVER BE US, NEVER MATCH US, NEVER EVEN COME FUCKING CLOSE TO REALIZING HOW INSIGNIFIGANT YOU ARE IN THIS GAME UNTIL YOU BEAT SOMETHING WITH <b>EIGHTTEEN</b> FEMALES PLAYING FOR THE RAID. For those of you that still don't get it, click your start menu, goto the 'Run' option, type calc, then type 18/72. THATS 25% .. so in the wake of our victory, I want to see all you other guilds on your god damn knee's, thats right kiss those boots.. hell without all this fucking flower power in guild Quarm would have CLEARLY been dead months ago!!</i>

<br><center>
<b><br><p><font face=Verdana size=10>VBORT!</center></b>

<p><font face=Verdana size=2>Onto the fun shit... Now here at Triton, we don't care much for drama.. but when drama walks up and pisses in our cornflakes, we don't take to well to it... so what do we do about it? Do we go insane in game and threaten people? Do we train, ks or petition? Not our style kids.. what we do, is we make as much fun of you as we can on the website so not only do WE know what retards you are, the whole EQ universe gets to know! Mind you this time it's a little different.. you see instead of bagging on Forces Unknown, one of our rival guilds for a stupid incident recently, we have colaberated with our friends at MTV to actually help turn there dreams into reality... So without futher ado, I'll hand this one over to MTV and I welcome you all to share in the journey of...

<br>

<p><font face=Verdana size=2>Now from the getgo, MTV was a little confused.. they really didn't have the foggiest idea where to go and since I felt really obligated to making FU's dream come true I put forth a little effort to get them started. The first thing they needed was a roster. How can you be uber without a solid roster? It's the backbone of everything. So MTV was kinda enough to round up half the server no matter what class / level or abilities they possesed as long as they had an EQ account and a heartbeat and handed them over to FU. You can clearly see by their roster that nothing should be able to withstand the sheer force of 14 wizards, 11 rogues and 13 rangers, let alone the total awesome healing force of 21 clerics and 15 druids!
<br>
<br>
<center><img src=/images/Quarm/furoster.jpg align=absmiddle  width=500 height =180></a></center>
<br>
<p><font face=Verdana size=2>With the show set to air within days, MTV realized the real problem became clear... and suddenly they appreciated my want to help these poor folks out..<b>Forces Unknown just totally sucked.</b> How could this be happening? What was going on here? They seemed to have 100 people on at any time of the day yet they couldn't kill their way out of a room made out of newspaper... A solution needed to be found and quickly.. MTV had a deadline.. the humm around the office wasn't a good one.. then suddenly they had it.. the one person who would be able to advise FU in the path of self uberness, the man, the myth, the legend.. the <b>one man</b> who was truly more uber then anyone..
<br>
<p><font face=Verdana size=2>Almost as if it was a whisper in the wind, one word echo'd lightly throughout the office... 
<br>
<p><font face=Verdana size=2>..Zentix 
<br>
<p><font face=Verdana size=2>Immidietly phones were ringing, the office was in panic and after a few quick conversations, they had all the tactics they needed for FU to become uber..

<b><p><font face=Verdana size=2>STEP 1 : Even if you aren't better then another guild, CONVINCE yourself that you are.. I mean uber is in the eye of the beholder right?</b>
<br>
<img src=/images/Quarm/fu1.jpg ></a>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<b><p><font face=Verdana size=2>STEP 2 : Get an IRC channel, all uber guilds have em, so Forces Unknown clearly needs one!</b>
<br>
<img src=/images/Quarm/fu2.jpg></a>
<i><p><font face=Verdana size=2>Note : In true uberguild fashion, when someone such as Nycol opens her mouth, make sure to put her in her place, even if it is a great idea!</b></i>
<img src=/images/Quarm/fu3.jpg></a>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<b><p><font face=Verdana size=2>STEP 3 : If someone leaves your guild for a real guild, make sure you totally spaz out, even if they gave 110% to said guild. It's even better if you are a huge hypocrit and have been part of 10 guilds multiple times. In doing so, hate on their guildleader too, that scores bonus points in the eyes of your latest guild peers! One more note, if you're going to admit your insane, drop the 'brief moments of' part, it adds to the mystery of your persona. So does rambling when you have no idea what you're talking about</b>
<br>
<img src=/images/Quarm/fu4.jpg></a>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<b><p><font face=Verdana size=2>Step 4: Boot people out of your guild because you THINK they might leave you for a better guild. Lets be real, this is 2003 not 1985.. nobody needs proof for anything anymore. This especially works for morale.</b>
<br>
<img src=/images/Quarm/fu5.jpg ></a>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<b><p><font face=Verdana size=2>Step 5: Rule 5, the golden rule. Without the help of Zentix this one may have never even came to light. Pay VERY close attention to what you are about to see because this is the one true ticket to fame, MTV's SAVIOUR for this episode.. Here it is : <i>If you get beat to something, and watch it die in front of you, simply petition that it was yours, or make up some lie like the other guild trained you out, or blurred your mobs, the excuse isn't important, it's the fact that when a GM shows up, you get to RANDOM for the event... seriously, it doesn't even matter what you say!</i> And voila, a free spawn.. *Note, FU did try this tactic but much to MTV's dispair, the other guild pulled the wool over FU's eyes and refused to roll, but under NORMAL circumstances, this is your meal ticket.. We'll show the play by play so that at least this episode of MTV:MADE isn't a total failure! Better to try then not try at all!</b>
<br>
<p><font face=Verdana size=2>These first few images are of the GM entering the zone, completely oblivious to what has even taken place, but to make a long story short, FU tried to beat the mighty Triton to the Fennin trigger. They engaged first with an army and in the rush failed, meanwhile Triton had backed off as they had a mere force of 14. When it was apparent FU was going to lose, the accused the honorable Triton whom was now very far away from them, of 'Blurring the mob' going so far as to say they even saw a 'so and so blinks a few times' message. After they had all died trying to rush and beat us, we walked in and killed the trigger. Readers may believe what they will, we obviously don't have a SS of this because it's absolute fiction. After the petition the golden rule kicked in, without any word from a GM, we were made to random 1 to 10!

<br>
<br>
<b><p><font face=Verdana size=2>Now seeing as I was trying to HELP FU become an Uber guild, I thought it quite unfair of them to try this tactic on me!! How unthoughful.. so I attempted to speak with the GM on this matter..</b>

<br>
<b><p><font face=Verdana size=2>Anyways, the show never made the air, it was a complete flop. MTV realized that it was hopeless, and FU while being worthless were much to incompetent to even successfully pull off a zentix PNP special. I hope they all learned something so that I feel my time and MTV's time wasn't wasted</b>
<br>

<b><p><font face=Verdana size=2>Did you forget we killed Quarm already? With 18 chicks too man, we fucking rule. Peace.</b>
