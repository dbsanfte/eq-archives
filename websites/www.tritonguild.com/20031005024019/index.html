	<tr><TD width=655 align='left'><font face='Verdana'><p><font size='2' face='verdana'>So the fucking flu has finally passed and I'm ready to 
  do an update. Man, you know when I first got suckered into going to Chicago 
  (ie. told that I had no choice) I had no intentions on participating in the 
  Fan Faire. I mean, when you hear Fan Faire you instantly think one of the dullest, 
  stupidest, and geekiest things you could ever go to IRL. Well I have to tell 
  anyone out there who thinks this to just go to one of these things... they're 
  fucking fun! No, seriously. It's real laid back and the people are all really 
  cool. So before I begin this elite update I just want to send a thanks out to 
  all of you developers that were there answering questions and shit. Any of you 
  fags who think the devs don't pay attention or don't care about the game, go 
  to one of these things and check it out for yourself. Now, I'm done with the 
  fan boy bullshit (sorry I love the game I play!) so here's the good FF fun.</font></p>
<p><font size='2' face='verdana'>Hrm, so where to start. Well, how about the hotel room? 
  Gomar is a bartender in Rochester, and this guy can drink . I've known him for 
  like a year and a half now IRL (and way longer in-game) and everytime he comes 
  down to Buffalo to visit you know you're not leaving sober, or at least totally 
  sober. ;) You also know you're not opening your wallet because everytime you 
  try to that mother fucker is on the way back with drinks for everyone again! 
  Anyway... Chicago was no different. We get there after driving for 10 hours 
  and this ass pulls out a dufflebag full of basically everything you can imagine. 
  Check out the pic below... besides having some serious kick ass people from 
  Povar in it, check out the cabinet behind us with the liquor. Keep in mind that's 
  not even 1/4th of what we had up there!</font></p>
<p align='center'><font size='2' face='verdana'><img src='images/news/fan_faire/povar_crew2.jpg' width='482' height='361'> 
  </font></p>
<p align='center'><font size='2' face='verdana'><img src='images/news/fan_faire/povar_crew.jpg' width='482' height='361'> 
  </font></p>
<p><font size='2' face='verdana'>So yeah, we had a roudy room party Friday night (or was 
  it Thursday?). We had random people from god only knows where (I'm still convinced 
  most weren't even involved in FF) coming in and out of our room all night... 
  you name it they were there! We even had a group of GMs crash it who later left 
  because Darkdan threatened them with anal sex... yeah, I'm serious. So, around 
  3am when we're at our roudiness the hotel staff comes up and boots everyone 
  out, we thought we were done, they were pretty cool about it though. People 
  walk out of the rooms with shit in their hand (Aoreke is trapped in the bathroom 
  with two chicks not allowed to leave until he gets some beads!), we're thinking 
  it's over, right? Wrong.</font></p>
<p><font size='2' face='verdana'>So now that we've cleaned up the mess (and Jesus it was 
  a MESS!) we're all getting ready to go to bed when we look down and what do 
  we see? Plure's shoes. Where's Plure? He disappeared like 4 hours ago, so he's 
  been wandering around the hotel wasted and shoeless, lol. There's actually pictures 
  of him on other sites crashing random parties drunk as can be, fun times! So 
  finally at like 4am he shows up at our door and grabs his shoes. Walks into 
  the bathroom, falls down, washes his hands and tries to turn off the bathroom 
  light with the switch in the hallway. Finally he gives up (after telling us 
  stories starting with 'I don't know about you guys, but...' for like 30 minutes) 
  and leaves the room. Of course he left the sink turned on. 6am rolls around 
  and we get a call from hotel security. Plure is passed out in front of our room, 
  shoeless. Good times!</font></p>
<p><font size='2' face='verdana'>Other than room parties we pretty much just randomly wandered 
  around Chicago. One great thing about this city is that there is ALWAYS an Irish 
  pub in walking distance from you no matter where you are. We made good use of 
  this feature...</font></p>

<p> </p>
<p><font size='2' face='verdana'>Saturday night was great too, Picket (old skool!) hosted 
  a party at his awesome place. We all messed around, drank a lot, and had fun...</font></p>

<p align='left'><font size='2' face='verdana'>Of course we tried to go bowling at like 
  1:30am... Aoreke fucked that one though! We get there and he's got a beer in 
  his hand (apparently in N. Carolina you're not allowed to go INTO a bowling 
  alley if you don't have one). The guy says you can't come in here with that, 
  he puts it behind his back and says 'What beer?' Naturally this guy pulls the 
  rent-a-cop badge and tells us we can't go in... lol. He then calls Bob 'doufas' 
  and takes our tickets back. GG!</font></p>
<p align='left'><font size='2' face='verdana'>So there's really not much left to say, all 
  in all a really fun weekend and worth the cash I blew. Thanks to all of the 
  Forces Unknown, Inverse Logic, Blades of Law, Legion of Little Folk, Rising 
  Ascension, Lore Keepers, Kassy from Brell - Honorary Povar Member (I couldn't 
  find a pic, but she gives great back rubs... ask Gomar!) and of course the Triton 
  folks that made it own. Was fun hanging with you guys, looking forward to seeing 
  you all in Vegas! Hopefully we can get all of FF to change 'Povar sucks!' again. 
  ;) Oh, and a special thanks to Danellyn. This guy owns, 'nuff said.</font></p>
<p align='left'><font size='2' face='verdana'>Now if you'll excuse me I have to go and 
  grab a cap full of NyCOL... erm, NyQUIL (sorry, always get her and things that 
  contain alcohol confused... fucking psycho bitch!).</font></p>
