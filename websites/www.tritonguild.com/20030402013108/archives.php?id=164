<p><font face=Verdana size=2>Before I start, I'd like to say this update is dedicated to Jentaii the IRC lurker~. From hatorade to vibrating pillows, she's always tried to make at least a screenshot or an honorable mention, so this ones for you! Oh yah, one other thing that the vibrating pillow just reminded me off.. our online Application has never worked. Ever. Not even once ever. So if you ever spent even 1 minute typing something into it, THAT IS TIME THAT I HAVE PERSONALLY STOLE FROM YOUR LIFE.</font></p>
<p><font face=Verdana size=2>So anyways, I know it's been a while since a real update, we pretty much took a 2-3 week vacation over the holidays, literally, and did fuck all. A few days ago we decided to start back up again. We'll post pretty screenshots of new gods dead soon enough. I mean it's what we do right?</font></p>
<p><font face=Verdana size=2>I do have a few new SS to post though, while they are nothing you haven't seen elsewhere, it's news here so enjoy~ Basically we killed RZ again, did some catching up with flags and offed Solosek Ro to get into Plane of Fire ( THE LEGIT WAY )</font></p>

<p><font face=Verdana size=2>Okay so all said and done, it's been a while since we had an update. I get alot of tells asking if DR.Zaar is gonna be in the next update etc but quite honesty, there aren't too many people pissing him off at the moment. Or so I thought. Unfortunetly the Doctor couldn't make it for the update but he did ask me to post this crossword puzzle he did for us. He also made it clear that the first person NOT in Triton to send me an email at eq_zaar@hotmail.com with all the correct answers, will be made famous in the next update!</font></p>

<br>
<p><font face=Verdana size=8>Horizontal</font></p>
<p><font face=Verdana size=2>1. I'm probably the most annoying person to ever grace the game of Everquest. Don't forget, Creator > AoW!
</font></p>

<p><font face=Verdana size=2>2. I'm not Jesus Christ yet I can walk through walls. I'm not superman but I can leap buildings in a single bound. I think it's totally legit to pull Rallos Zek right out of the arena for a faggoty cheesebag kill. I'm loved on the beta boards. I'm a monk.
</font></p>

<p><font face=Verdana size=2>3. I wonder if Tork will _____ give up whining about bards. ( Couldn't help it, I still <3 u )
</font></p>

<p><font face=Verdana size=2>4. If you are flying through this crossword and know all the answers, it's very likely that you have never felt, let alone seen, a real set of _____.
</font></p>

<p><font face=Verdana size=2>5. I'm probably one of the biggest fags to grace EQ ever. I like to think I'm playing with the big kids but little do I know I'm still playing in the sandbox. I'm also the new leader of Rising Ascension.
</font></p>
<p><font face=Verdana size=2>6. Slang term for a dark elf.
</font></p>
<p><font face=Verdana size=2>7. I'm a moderator at Graffe's. I used to say Zaar had the worst updates ever when infact I'm the one responsable for making you stare at that fucking 'happy holidays' picture for a god damn month.
</font></p>
<p><font face=Verdana size=2>8. Would someone please give Rising Ascension leadership back to _____? At least she wasn't a total and complete retard. Hell give leadership to Nuugharm or even Ithiliden for that matter. Even if both those guys give each other 'Angry Dragons' they would still make better leaders.</font></p>
</font></p>

<p><font face=Verdana size=8>Vertical</font></p>

<p><font face=Verdana size=2>1. I was the first person on any server to complete the Ring War,and unfortunetly for anyone that will listen, I love to talk about the faceguard that was named after me constantly.
</font></p>
<p><font face=Verdana size=2>2. The slang term for the spell that shamans are crying themselves to sleep over at the moment.
</font></p>
<p><font face=Verdana size=2>3. The single handed best guild to grace the everquest gaming world.</font></p>
<p><font face=Verdana size=2>4. I like to make deals regarding flags with other guilds, then totally pretend I never made them when it no longer works to my advantage. Did I mention I'm a total faggot? I'm also the new leader of Rising Ascension. </font></p>
<p><font face=Verdana size=2>5. As hard as I try, I'll never be as good of a necro as Zaar. Hell, forget that, I'll never even be as good of a necro as Potus. I'm a necro on Veeshan, in FoH, but to be honest, I'm a dirty cross server who will feed mana at will. _________ Cops.
</font></p>
<p><font face=Verdana size=2>6. Anyone else sick of the stupidity of how ______s are handled? I mean, honestly, I DO NOT WANT TO FUCKING KILL RALLOS ZEK again, let alone doing something as stupid as the hoh trials just because we actually had to recruit a new member that was missing a few _____s. Get the monkeys in labcoats over at SoE to figure something the fuck out before I send Furor over there strapped with dynamite.
</font></p>
<br>
<p><font face=Verdana size=2>Thanks for the crossword DR.Z! In closing I'd just like to make one more thing very clear to everyone:</font></p>
