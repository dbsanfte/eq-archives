<font face=verdana size=2>Okay well obviously I'm gonna put a picture at the top, and start the update with simply saying, Xegony 2.0 is dead.</font><br>

<br>
<font face=verdana size=2>Now typically in my updates, I start off with talking shit about someone, some other guild, bash someone else, swear a little but unfortunetly for you folks that enjoy the updates for that reason, you're going to have to forgive me just this once. Now, before I go into great depth about why my guild is better then every other guild out there, I want to make sure all the other guilds that have beat Xegony 2.0 get theirs, so grats to FoH, Magister(still fags), Eternal Wrath as well as the combined forces of Caer Cadarn and Humdapoky. (If I didn't mention you, I didn't know! )</font><br>
<br>
<font face=verdana size=2>So anyways, where was I.. oh yah, why our guild is better then yours. Well let me start by saying we only beat the spider event 5 days ago in Air. We had only tried it once, that being the first week of being in the planes and we collectively said fuck this and went and farmed fire. 450 loots later, we went back and laughed at it with 42. So the next night, we went up to try Xegony.. we basically got schooled repeatidly. 97% best run. Next night? Spent a good 2 hours working through our strat, assigning groups ( a first for Triton ) and went again. Best run? 81%. Night 3, tonight. With 64 people to the tee, a combined DPS force of 4 rogues, 2 wizards, 2 mages and 5 rangers, 45 mins after starting, Xegony was dead at our feet. </font><br>
<br>
<font face=verdana size=2>Now I'd love to get into how intricate this fight is but I really don't want to ruin it. It is the absolute definition of ONE tiny mistake by ANYONE and you lose. It's that sweaty hands, shaking feeling when you even get her to 50% thinking that there is a glimmer of hope that the strat is working and you might actually pull this shit off. So for the guys that showed up tonight, after me pleading for attendance, you all did fucking incredible and I'm absolutely 100% proud of everyone for doing an excellent job.</font><br>
<br>
<font face=verdana size=2>Afterwords, we took 49 people to the absolute sad joke of a god Fennin and smoked him flawless, except for Rombus when he tried to race me to loot him at the end. Please note my greyed out harmshield~</font><br>

<br>
<br>
<font face=verdana size=2>Anyways, sorry there is nothing super funny here, I just really didn't want to take away from the accomplishment this is. 2 Down, 2 to Go. P.S. Rombus, you may now grammar check my update for Their, There and They're mistakes. P.S.S. We're thinking about taking a few X-server wizards with ele flags and high AA. Email me at EQ_Zaar@hotmail.com if you fit the bill.. AND WE STILL NEED A FUCKING BARD</font><br>
<br>
<font face=verdana size=2>With love, from Rombus~<br>
