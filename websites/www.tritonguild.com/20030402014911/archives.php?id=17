                What's up sluts? You wouldn't believe how fucking awesome of a 
                weekend I had in San Diego and Teijuna. From Mexican pimps offering 
                the finest 'poontang, coke, heroin, cigars, and gold watches' 
                to a psychotic Denny's waitress claiming she travels in to the 
                future and that she only keeps her money in Arizona banks because 
                in 3 years all the California money will sink in to the ocean 
                and be lost for good. No joke... After all this, what better to 
                come home to a nice Yelinak raid.</font></b></p>

                pure strength and power of Walter, the senile white dragon gimp 
                was bent over and took it from behind just like Root does nightly.

                against Triton' group. Their spokesperson told us Cazic Thule 
                has severe emotional problems beyond pacifism, and that we should 
                take it easy. Look Mothers against Triton, if it drops loot, we

                of pacifists like himself. Taking a nature walk he wandered over 
                through the portal carrying his 'Natureboy's stick.' Bad mistake 
                buddy, now you get taken out like a bitch. Cazic dropped two cloaks
