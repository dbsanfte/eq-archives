              Funny thing is, I was about to take a nice break from updating the 
              site, had it worked out with Zaar so he'd maintain the site for 
              a bit.... Then I saw his VP update below, my friends, this will 
              not stand. You the viewers, deserve much better! No screen shots 
              today because I wasn't even planning on updating this, I'll make 
              it up next time though, ok so I doubt I will but fuck it man.<br>

              Soon as I find a reliable host for videos, we're going to put some 
              videos online of us kicking some serious fucking ass. If you're 
              a nice person and have the bandwidth to spare, leave a note on the 
              message board if you'd be willing to host a few 7 - 10 meg videos. 
              There's also a Arizona EQ Meeting soon - Saturday May 12th 1:00 
              pm at the Gameworks Bar in Arizona Mills. Bring a fake ID if you're too young or just 
              chill in the game area, either way a bunch of us are going and I'll 
              be there. Message Illanae in game or leave a post on our board if 
              interested. <br>
