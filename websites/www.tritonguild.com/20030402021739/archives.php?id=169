<font face=verdana size=2><b>Disclaimer : don't read this update if you are easily offended by swearing and bad taste. Also, this update is purely Povar shit, its our webpage, server drama is A-OK here, you don't like it, fuck off.</font><br></b>
<br>
<font face=verdana size=2>Anyways, I'd like to start with a joke, and I'll bring my point to light after it. Here goes : Q:Whats funnier then a dead baby? A:A dead baby in a clown suit.</font><br>
<br>
<font face=verdana size=2>Pretty tastless joke huh? I'm sure alot of you are going 'man Z, thats not funny in the least'. Let me explain. I'm simply trying to find a joke that is on par with the joke that is simply called <b>'Everquest Customer Service'</b>. Let me just say, that in the last 2 days I have lost all faith in CS and GM's and to be honest, I feel bad for the GM's that have helped in the past because the absolute disdain I hold for the GM's I've dealt with makes you good GM's look like the fucking retards your coworkers are.</font><br>
<br>
<font face=verdana size=2>So apparently I was in the dark about how all this stuff works. Moreso I think I simply underestimated how queer <b>Rising Ascension</b> could be. They seem to be reaching new heights every day. Now the quick version of the story ( and of course there are 2 sides to every story ) goes as follows : Sallymanders blows Carpin ( like we have been doing everyday for months so we can XP back there ). Sallys gets petitioned and warned. Okay so he got a warning, shit happens. Then he gets into a pissing match with some RA folk, they exchange verbal shit, ya know 'fuck you' 'you're a fag' typical shit. Some faggot from RA, decides to /report a screen with just 1 line from sally, apparently having an argument by himself. The result?</font><br>
<br>
<font face=verdana size=2><b>Sally is suspended for 2 weeks until 2/27 for, and I quote from Sally's phone call to CS 'Vulgarity'</font><br></b>
<br>
<font face=verdana size=2>So my question is, what KIND OF FUCKING BAD JOKE IS THIS.. 2 weeks? for vulgarity? If I've ever seen this system abused worse I can't recall.. so basically all I need to do is mouth off to someone that isn't a baby, and when they mouth off back I can report them and get them suspended? FOR TWO FUCKING WEEKS? Seriously, fix this, it's not even fucking funny. Maybe THREE days for swearing, but TWO WEEKS.. maybe you can't see how your faggot system got abused to their advantage but bust out one of the admins with more then a grade 3 education and a level 10 druid on test and fix this fucking shit.</font><br>
<br>
<font face=verdana size=2>As for you RA fags. Do we petition you, when you have Macc supersneak into fire through the solro pit and sit and watch us kill shit? Do we petition when he sits and watches us do earth rings? When you swear at us, do we whine to the nearest GM's? No we don't. So we play competitively. Man we can't even be in the same zone as you fucking babies without getting petitioned. All I can say to you is grow the fuck up. So laugh it up because you succeeded in somehow getting the stupidest GM alive with your latest petition, getting Sally suspended. We'll see you faggots around in game.</font><br>
