Since there was a thread a few weeks ago talking a little about it I figure we should have one of our once every couple months political talks. War with Iraq is looming and a majority of American's support it. Much of the international community is against it, causing Bush to promote going at it alone and rendering those with objections irrelevant. So here are some questions to think about.<P>Do you support going to war with Iraq?<P>What evidence has lead you to that decision?<P>Is Bush doing a good job representing America's interests and safety?<P>Should we ignore international organizations like the U.N if they object and risk rendering them permanently irrelevant? (For better or worse it'll invalidate the security council to other nations as well as the US)<P>Do you see any reasons we should delay or not go to war at all with Iraq?<P>How do you feel about the situations all together? <P>Please try to use some facts and evidence instead of just emotional opinions or preaching through insults as someone always ends up doing. I'll post my arguement in a few days if the thread gets going, want to let others get out their take on it first though.

IF it is true that Saddam Hussein intends to use Weapons Of Mass Destruction then I support a war on Iraq. Otherwise I dont. The only rational reason to attack somone is if you have CONCRETE, INDISPUTABLE evidence that they would attack you first, in essence, defending against their attack. As it is now, I have not seen any proof that Saddam even HAS WOMD, let alone that he intends to use them. America has weapons of mass destruction, yet we wouldnt use them for fear of civilian casualties. I hope. If we did, how are we any different than Saddam?<P>There is simply not enough information for me to make a decision. Untill I hear a tape recorded conversation of Saddam saying he wants to nuke the US, I will strongly oppose us attacking him.

Do you support going to war with Iraq?<P>No.<P>What evidence has lead you to that decision?<P>When motivations for an action are in doubt (politically.. financially.. or otherwise), doubly so in the case of an action resulting in the (foreknown) deaths of many, and having avaliable.. MANY other means of resolution.. i cannot in good conscious condone OR support the declaration of hostilities.<BR> <BR>Is Bush doing a good job representing America's interests and safety?<P>America's interests? Oil interests? Most definately.. my family's welfare? In my opinion no, becoming violently involved in this region on the level it appears he plans to will NOT have a positive outcome.<P>Should we ignore international organizations like the U.N if they object and risk rendering them permanently irrelevant? (For better or worse it'll invalidate the security council to other nations as well as the US)<P>I believe in a STRONG UN.. imo they should be the A MAJOR part of how we decide our international policies... to go against the will of the UN also imo will show the world that we are willing to set the rules, but not to follow them.. what basis for global stability is that? None.<P>Do you see any reasons we should delay or not go to war at all with Iraq?<P>Very simply, LISTEN to the rulings of the UN.. Deal with Iraq as a part of the group.. by disregarding the ruling bodies our govn't has ratified.. it brings OUR govn't one step closer to that which we seek to defeat..   <IMG SRC="frown.gif" border="0"><P>How do you feel about the situations all together? <P>I dont like them, imo people all over the world should be well fed, properly clothed, healthy and happy.. this is obviously not the case.. adding MORE violence to that region will NOT be the solution.. in the end it will serve to mire OUR nation into the quagmire that region is.<P>--------------------<P>I am a unique snowflake, and i am VERY pretty.

I guess with a military background, I have to look at this objectively and see it through the eyes of you all -- through the liberal media.  You all know what they want you to hear.  You say you want proof of Saddam saying these things but this is unrealistic.  If the media was given all the information, the intelligence operations would not be able to function.  I will try my best to paint the big picture with this drawn out metaphor. <P>Kempodo is a gay sailor.  Now, he doesn't wear gay clothes, nor does he tell the world he is less than hetero by placing a rainbow coalition sticker on his and his boyfriend's bumper.  In fact, nobody knows he is a queer except his man friend, c0ldfire.  Unrealistic, yes, but let's just make it understood nobody in the world knows they are lovers.<P>One day, Kempodo begins to chat in a gay one-on-one chatroom and they chat for hours with nobody watching them.  They believe this is a secure way of communication.  Kempodo tells his lover he likes to play the donkey and toothbrush game and then they go to bed.  <P>The next day, it's all over the newspaper that they are lovers.  It turns out NAS is a l33t haXXOr and was spying on their conversation while flogging his dolphin.  He tells the reporters that they play the "donkey and toothbrush game".  Kempodo and c0ldfire are pissed!  They know they were haXXored and will never chat on the computer again about their great secrets.  <P>Now NAS will have to find another way to become erotically aroused (unless he visits <A HREF="http://www.davidhasselhoff.com)." TARGET=_blank>www.davidhasselhoff.com).</A>   However, if he would have kept his mouth shut to the papers, he could live in bliss masturbating endlessly while watching their sexy chat because the love birds would not know they were hacked!<P>How does this tie in to the point of this thread?  If Saddam is making secret plans in a closed off area or via a hidden pay phone in his palace, and the information is made public, he will not use those methods anymore.  The US will have to find another way to get information.  They will have to send spies in country to find Saddam's new 1-800-collect booth to put taps on it.<P>This is why the media does not have the best information.  However, enough is given to show the population where their tax dollars are going.  If you believe that the news is 100% accurate, you have much to learn.  <P>As far as my opinion on this matter...  If Saddam is doing something and it looks, smells, and tastes like shit, it is shit.  The man is a dictator to his own people.  He runs a corrupt government but his people know not how to do anything, as he has been in power for over 23 years.  Should we declare an all out war and disrupt the lives of so many?  Hell no.  The US military has excellent snipers and tactical units that can be deployed to infiltrate and off the bastard where he would be the only casualty.  Does might make right?  Yes.  Should it?  That's another post in itself.<P>--------------------<P> <IMG SRC="http://members.bellatlantic.net/~vze3cy4t/sigpic1.jpg"> <BR><A HREF="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=44249" TARGET=_blank>Iadar</A><BR><A HREF="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=44261" TARGET=_blank>Gixxer</A>

Personally, every time this topic comes up i get rather upset. Not over the entire war idea, since i do believe was is a necessary to keeping some form of peace (how ever ironic that sounds). There is one thing that curdles my blood tho, the fact that every time bush brings up iraq he mentinos 911 and how we must all unite against evil. What i don't understand is whatever happened to him promising us he'd catch bin laden. Did he give up on this and figure "let's just go for saddam again". He seems to ignore the fact that even kuwait ( who we backed in the gulf war ) won't even support us. To me this says something along the lines of " we have no business trying this right now". <P>I'm just wondering if anyone out there can tell me why we gave up on bin laden and now use 911 to justify another war.<P>please pardon any spelling and grammar errors that i'm sure are in here. sorry if i dont make sense :-/

All i know is there is enough death in this world without starting another (what seems publicly unnecassary) war.  There are far more dangerous countries out there other than Iraw, Saudi arabia is known to fund 90% of terrorism. Also, many (not sure on number) of the hijackers on 911 were saudi citizens, bin laden himself is a saudi citizen, but we seem to leave them alone. Any thoughts on why? without using "oil" as an excuse.

Bush is just generating a war to attempt to fix the economy that he fucked up so far.  I for one hope we avoid this senseless war and avoid killing people that we don't need to.  But I know better by now.<P>-Gruffy

Well, seeing that i am over here sailing around the Gulf of Oman and have been for the last 6 months, I would have to say we still are looking for terrorists. We search atleast one vessel per day, and we ( my Ship) have hailed 1200 vessels in the last 6 months. If it is coming from a certian port or going to one that we think is a trip wire we stop it. <P>   So far we have detained just 6 people but hey every little bit counts. Actually 2 days ago we gave the USN Kaufmann a ship to biard, just a little 60m ship. They found 3 fake passports, the Captain who was from Iraq had pamphlets on biological warfare in his cabin.. If he can be conected to the government, lets just say it will not be pretty.<P>   Personally i belive that the US, Canada, French, Japanese, British, Australian, Dutch and all the other nations navys that are out here are still trying to do something to prevent another 911, and this is just the forces at sea. Oh and there is a aircraft carrier out here launching a/c that fly out to afganistan (sp) everyday as well.<P><BR>  Do i want to see a war on Iraq? Actually no, i have sailed around of the coast of Iraq, about 50 miles off and seen all the small boats out there, fishermen trying to make a living, people trying to smuggle oil to feed their families and such. We talk to these people and it is not like they have a choice of getting rid of Saddam, they may not be happy but they say they were alot happier before forces started bombing their homes. I am not sure what we can do but I do not think starting a war with a whole country is the solution.<P>--------------------<P>Mishtar <BR>Warder of Triton<BR>Povar

<BLOCKQUOTE><font size="1" face="Verdana, Helvetica, sans-serif">quote:</font><HR> I'm still wondering why everyone just can't get along <HR></BLOCKQUOTE><P>  Well..the sad thing is, not everyone WANTS to get along. I think North Korea for the past 50 years is the best example of this. When you first arrive in Korea, you get shown a sattelite picture of the peninsula. South Korea is covered in lights. North Korea is primarily dark. The North Koreans have roughly 75% of their economy being poured into their military..and their economy is not very much.<BR>  Not many North Koreans have Television.<BR>  Very few have electricity...<BR>However, until very recently, even though their people are starving, the North Koreans would not come to the table's when it came to peace talks.<BR>  It's kind of puzzling to think of why a country would rather starve then unify, but when you get to the nitty gritty of it, its the way they believe. They are traditionalists. They believe that ALL of the peninsula should be as they are. Farming for a living, not making VCR's and walkmans.<BR>  Thats very similar to the Middle East. We represent, to their government, all that is wrong. Much like the Matrix, I think they fear most that we will open their peoples eyes. Dislike this country all you want, we have something most take for granted, and that is freedom. We also have unity.<BR>  On Sept 11'th, I was at Langley AFB in Virginia. Within hours, we had sent many people to New York to help. Many, who did not get sent there took Leave, and voulenteered their time to go and help. People came from all across the country to do what they could to assist.<BR>  This year, on September 11th, many radio stations had moments of silence. One station had a huge "Living Flag" composed of people holding up cardboard signs. When Tragedy happens, the US is very strong at pulling together. I doubt the same can be said of many other nations..and furthermore, when disaster strikes another nation, it is the US who first shows sympathy and offers aid.<P>  Do I think we should go to war with Iraq ?<BR>  Well, I agree with some of what Iadar said...the media will never be able to give the full and entire picture to the country. I do, however, know what chemical weapons can do to a person, or people. There are plenty of pictures you can find, and we get to see them during Chem Warfare training. Dying to a chemical weapon is not pleasant...imagine being covered in blisters, that pop and rupture, or having them inside your lungs. Imagine being unable to breathe, or see.<BR>  I am in full confidence that Saddam has these weapons, and is more then willing to use them.<BR>  I am also in full confidence that Saddam possesses, in entirety, or near it, Nuclear Capability.<BR>  That means that many of you reading this post could possibly be killed if he was to launch said weapon, with little notice. Intercontinental Balistic weapons could, in theory strike as far inland as the Kansas, or farther.<BR>  I do not think we should wait until the weapons are in the air before we take action...sure, we have countermeasures, but how often do you think we've actually had to use them ? I'd rather not put faith in them.<BR>  I think we should go on over, and smear him all over the sand.<P>  As for Osama...thats a huge "Where's Waldo" game. Finding one Arabic guy, who is reportedly "Somewhere on the Globe", who likely has enough money and contacts to get any kind of self altering surgery, or transport required, and may very well be sitting in a hidden bunker under the middle of some bumblefuck sandhill does not strike me as easy.<BR>  Hell, I have difficulty finding my car at the Movie Theatre parking lot sometimes.

This is a serious subject and I dont want to give a short reply, as I dont have the time at the moment to reply, Im going to repost the reply I had posted on the earlier subject and will post a much more indepth reply when I have the time to give it the proper attetion it needs. Until then here is a reposat on the same subject:<BR>____________________________________<P>heheh ... pacifism is the surest way to invite an agressor ... heheh .. see 8-)<P>JK w/you Gren, but in all reality ... Im VERY scared to allow a the government of a country like Iraq to attain nuclear weapons by way of $ from a crumbling Soviet Union, neighbor country ... 8-( <P>He has demonstrated that he is willing to call a "Jihad" or ALL OUT BAR NONE HOLY war to the death to simply to defend his justification of plundering an ajacent county thru force. And launch attacks on a "neutral" country at that point (Israel <BR>) in order to try to invoke a response that might gain favor from other Arib nations.<P>I personally dont think it is to far out to see a time in the near future, given some time to attain nuclear weapons, that Iraq under its current leadership would declair another "holy war" against the infidels of the US or another country like Israel. And in doing so kill millions and invoke an almost certain destruction for his own country as well as bringing the wolrd in general to the possible brink of nuclear war. <P>With these previous thoughts in mind ... as well as a few others, Im "OK" with being viewed as the "big bad USA" by other parts of the world.<P>Let me throw another scenerio out that some of the pacifists of the world may have over looked ... Lets say we DONT attack Iraq and leave it to it's own, or even w/UN overseeing it's current government. Who do you think Iraq will go to war with most likely with it's next "holy war"? It most likely will not be the US. It will most likely be Israel. Im not sure if you know Israel's current military "condition", but it is VERY strong. If Israel is attacked in a "holy war", by way of biological, chemical or nuclear weapons, I think Israel WILL turn to the use of it's nuclear arrsinal without hessitation to defend it's country. It would do so MUCH faster then the US would ever turn to weapons of mass destruction. Israel is not a country that "puts up" with much. And as such is a PRIME target for Iraq to try to win favor, as it did in the last war, by attacking it. <P>The US, imho, needs to eliviate that threat, period. I dont care if we're viewed as being in the wrong or not, it simply HAS to be done so that my son (metephorically speaking) has a world to grow up in. The world will b pissed off for a while and call us names (does that anyways), similar to when Russia invaded Afganistan, and when China had it's Tiaman Square masicure. The world "cry'd" out in outrage ... then moved on. The same will be done when Iraq has a new government. <P>I view the situation similar to that of someone breaking into my home ... I can not afford the threat to my family and as such will use immediate and overwelming lethal force ... and then deal with the courts and lawsuits later ... ONCE my family is safe. <P>I think the President is doing as much as he can by the books, and also showing a VERY strong focus, by showing the world he can and WILL go to war with or without the congressional approval, if he in his position feels that Iraq is a clear and present danger. I also think he has pretty well shown that is exactly how he views the current situation. That sends a VERY strong signal to the UN to either put up or "become irrelevant" ... ouch those were strong words comming from a President of the United States. <P>Im not sure if your familiar with the history of the UN ... but b4 the UN was the "League of Nations" (I think that was it's name) ... it was exactly what the UN is today, per sae. It was created after WWI. One of it's main resolutions was to oversee the rebuilding of Germany and to MAKE SURE it didnt re-arm it's military. It "became irrelevent" when it was unable to prevent Germany, thru international sanctions and preasure, from re-arming it's military. It was dismantled when Hitler started WW2. <P>I am not privilaged to know what our President knows, and in all honesty I dont want that responsibility. But WHAT IF he currently has evidence Iraq has or is trying to secretly purchase nuclear weapons? ... Does that change your view at all on the Iraq situation? I dont know if they do or dont ... but r you willing to risk you childrens lives on it? Im not. <P>Similar to a person breaking into my home .. I dont know if they are intending harm, but I simply am not willing to risk my family for the benifit of the doubt of someone who has ALREADY shown a disrespect for the law.<P>Wow ..

Lest we all forget why George wants to go back and avenge daddy..cause dont be confused, Thats what this is all about..Its the OIL..The guy is a texan..the word oil comes up and their eyes light up like a prom queen at the senior prom. Hes got his hands so deep in the oil companys pockets and they have their collective hands so far up his ass manipulating his mouth that this was inevitable. <BR>Look at his veep and his business in haliburton. Cheney is so dirty hes in perma hiding. George doesnt dare bring him out for fear someone will subpeona him to testify about his role in manipulating oil and natural gas prices. <BR>As far as war and saddam is concerned..well. for me yes i see saddam as a danger to the well being of israel...who is our "ally". Do I see him being a danger to the america's?  No. Nor do i see him becoming a menace to us anytime soon. I'm ex military (U.S.Navy corpsman,1979-1983) and from that view point i see a man hopelessly overmatched and i dont really think hes so stupid that he thinks he can take on the us military again and hope to win. <BR>In my opinion..I think this is all a smoke screen to mke the american people stop paying attention to the gap between the rich and the poor..or that the surplus from a couple years ago is now gone. and that George and his cronies feel budget is for the rich and fuck the middle and lower classes...But thats just my opinion.<P>Sailur<P>George W.<BR>Like fodder,Like scum

(Gonna be a long post) Good ol' political discussions....having a background similar to Iadar's I support what he has said.  The liberal media tends to think it has divine right to ALL information that goes through any given agency at any given time - and they simply need to face it - there will never be complete information freedom.  Just as Iadar said if you knew someone was listening to your phone conversations talking about you having ass sex with a goat you'd probably find another means of communication. America has to have secret programs in order to retain an intelligence advantage.  I personally despise and am disgusted at the American media.  They will try their damndest to fish out dirt on Americans and disclose operations, but they won't air the literally hundreds of thousands of civillians we have killed in Iraq by so called "sanctions" that have hurt the civillian population far more than it has the government.  <P>On to the war on Iraq.  I will appear contradictory in my rhetoric because I sum it up like this:  "We're doing the right thing for all the wrong reasons"  <P>IF Saddam has WMD - then by all means we need to take him out.  IF we have the intelligence you can be damned sure the general public isn't going to be briefed; that is unless the whole nation is going to have background checks done and be read on to know that sensitive of information.  I, however, agree with Iadar - it doesn't take a full scale war.  It's always seemed ironic to me that we will send thousands of American troops to potentially die just because we no longer "assassinate" people anymore.  If you drop a 2000 lbs. bomb on a guy's house and kill everyone inside him it's combat, but if you take one Barrett .50 cal sniper and off the same man's head it is "assassination" and is morally wrong.<P>On to why I believe Bush has a "hidden agenda".  The first Gulf War was a disaster that not many Americans know about thanks to its lovely media.  Here are a few facts:<P>1. The no-fly zone lines seperate to the north and south Iraq's most oil rich portions of the country. Think those lines were arbitrarily made??<P>2. We taught Kuwait "slant-drill" techniques way before the war in Iraq began.  Kuwait was slant-drilling into the country of Iraq, taking their oil, and then selling it back to them at crazy prices.  Iraq learned of this and went ballistic (wouldnt you!?) and some believe we "bullied" Iraq into the war.<P>3. Back in the first war we said Saddam was amassing troops on the border for an offensive.  No photos were ever shown, and a civillian company actually paid for the use of a Russian satellite that took pictures and showed no build-up whatsoever on said border.  The American media refused to air the story.<P>4. With the Kuwaiti government the American media devised a famous false story about babies being removed from incubators after the invasion, left on the floor to die, and the incubators sent back to Iraq.  There was even a witness who testified she saw it happen.  Well, the witness turned out to be the Kuwaiti ambassador's daughter and she was never even in Kuwait when the story was supposed to take place.  The story when it was first aired enraged Americans and was the "last straw" for a number of Senators to vote yes on the war - and the whole damn thing was a lie!<P>There are many other facts.  Not many people know there was a war crimes tribunal held with 18 countries represented and they actually found the president and its military leaders guilty of war crimes. But, whose gonna come arrest the president?  Or how the infamous highway of death happened?  When we closed off a 7-mile stretch of highway and had a "turkey shoot" of civillians and military vehicles.  We also condemned Saddam for killing Kurds.  I was personally on the ground in Turkey supporting Operation Enduring Freedom when allied aircraft came back from operations and the Turkish F-16s took off loaded to the hilt to bomb...you guessed it...Kurds.  But, hey they are our allies.  Our sanctions have killed thousands of Iraqi civillians. They can't even have the most basic of medical supplies.  Surgeries with no anethesia.  It just really saddens me.  We're the greatest nation on earth and should have a shred of honor.  I know our troops do, but I'm not so sure about the government.  I'm all for killing Saddam, but do it for the right reasons, and don't do it by slowly killing its people off.  It's been what..12 years now.  We think the conditions will make the people hate Saddam - but how do we know they don't think its America that did it to them.   How do we know 12 years of hate hasn't brewed in some kid's mind and is right now giving birth to a new Osama or Saddam?  I can't stomach the senseless killing of women and children.  All because we made the stupid ass mistake of not taking care of the problem 12 years ago.  Bush Jr. is here to inflict the revenge that his dad failed to do.

Attacking Iraq justifies Japan in 1941, and Germany in 1938.  Attacking first for no reason whatsoever besides "we felt like it".<P>You can call it National Security all you want, but thats just plain and simple bullshit.  Saddam is a paranoid egomaniac, sure.  But he's not a delusional one.  He doesn't think he can take on the U.S. and win.  If he thought that, he would have said it in his last speech, where he told his people "If we are attacked, we will put up great resistance" (paraphrasing of course) instead of what he would say if he were delusional "If we are attacked, we will destroy them and their homeland, drive the attackers from the face of the earth".<P>Look, he went for a quick gain in Kuwait cos he didn't think anyone would notice or go to out and out war for oil, which is EXACTLY what we did.  He knows that he is now branded an evil guy and the next second he so much as BLINKS wrong, western civilization will remove him from power - which is the last thing he wants.  The power is what he craves.<P>Anyone that claims that he is gonna join in the fight because of some vague religous hysteria is also not using facts to support their argument.  Saddam is NOT a religous fanatic.  He is actually part of a minority in Iraq that are moderate Islam, sort of like a Sunday Catholic.  All the freakshow Islam guys out there are like TV preachers.  They hate each other.  Sure, they both hate us, but he's not gonna go give nuclear weapons to people that hate him.  HE'S PARANOID, remember?<P>You know why he wants nuclear weapons?  As a deterrent, like every other petty dictator that has them, because having one means you are one of the "big boys".  Every single leader that has had control of nuclear weapons has not used them.  Except us of course, we are PROVEN USERS OF WOMD, when do we start attacking ourselves?  Even Ariel Sharon, who is a crazy warmongering guy if I ever saw one, hasn't used Israel's nukes.  Because again, ANY small time player that uses one gets a big fucking timeout from the big guys.  Just like India and Pakistan.  They sit there and posture all day but won't do shit.<P>And before one of you freakshows comes out of the woodwork pointing out "yeah but Saddam used WOMD against his own people!"  Go do a little research other than <A HREF="http://www.newsmax.com" TARGET=_blank>www.newsmax.com</A>  and find out the circumstances.  You know where he got those?  FROM US, WE GAVE THEM TO HIM TO USE ON IRAN.  That's right, we condoned the use of WOMD BY SADDAM back when it was convenient for us.  And now we will damn him for having them?  He didn't use them on his own people, btw, so he could film it and jack off screaming Reagan's name every time he watched them, he used them on a revolt in northern Iraq when the military was severely weakened from the fight in Iran and his power was threatened.<P>Does he have chem and bio weapons?  Of course he does, we have the fucking receipt.  But that doesn't mean he is going to use them, anyone that thinks he will use them against the U.S. based on the overall state of the world is, in my opinion, a fucking moron.  Sure, he may use them against Israel or the Kurds or anyone that attacks him first, but I really don't give a shit about those people, I'm concerned about America.<P>The rest of you, bring it on.

Good posts imo.  While I may not agree with what a few people have said, the actual use of facts and being objective (most of the people) keeps this thread bookmarked.  <P>BTW, maybe someone can answer this.  Why did this last week's recent election in Iraq have only one candidate?  Are they all in support of Saddam or are they scared to challenge him?  Also, unrelated to the actual election itself, why would Saddam issue a pardon to all prisoners to celebrate his victory?  <A HREF="http://story.news.yahoo.com/fc?cid=34&tmpl=fc&in=World&cat=Iraq" TARGET=_blank>http://story.news.yahoo.com/fc?cid=34&tmpl=fc&in=World&cat=Iraq</A>   It says amnesty for prisoners, but I understand this to be pardons.  Amnesty is given to people who have committed crimes to get them to come forward if I am not mistaken.<P>--------------------<P> <IMG SRC="http://members.bellatlantic.net/~vze3cy4t/sigpic1.jpg"> <BR><A HREF="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=44249" TARGET=_blank>Iadar</A><BR><A HREF="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=44261" TARGET=_blank>Gixxer</A>

As far as I know about the elections in Iraq I was wondering the same thing, Iadar.  The whole system is quite retarded. It was a yes/no ballot on whether or not he should remain in power.  I don't know the intricacies of policy there, and I'm not sure what would happen if the whole nation went and voted No what would happen.  Most people that would want to vote No probably stayed at home and didn't vote at all.

Support war? No. I belive there is no reason to support any kind of war. <P>What evidence has lead you to that decision?<BR>Evidence is bullshit.

He sure is improving security, sooner or later US will have a camera on every street corner, databank on your sexual habits.

Why a country respect a international treaty if US ignore them? best example is treaty on personal mines (121 nations signed a treaty December 3 banning the use, production and stockpiling of land mines) and kyoto protocol, Why didnt US sign them?.<P>Do you see any reasons we should delay or not go to war at all with Iraq?<BR>I dont belive war is a solution. I think a good example is Israel. Yes they have air superiority, they have nukes, they have the BEST pilots, proably the highest qualified military force on the planet. How secure do you think they feel? <P>How do you feel about the situations all together?<BR>Sad. Technologie is becoming more accessible. WOMD are getting smaller, deadlier and easyer to get/make. Artificialy maintaining those rogue country in stone age will eventualy fail. Most of those people have no electicity, no water, no futur. Yay, sure bomb them, you will give them more reason to hate the rest of the world and press the red button the day they find a nuke. Killing people using "greater good" as excuse is lame.

I'm liking what I see so far (Hoping some others against the war speak up to get some more debate going based on each other's arguments.) Just remember as it gets more heated to argue each other's points instead of attacking the person speaking them.....<P>Iadar, that's a good point and is one thing that frightens me about Iraq's social and political systems. Even though Saddam put himself as the only candidate on the ballot millions are loyal to him because they view him as a man strong enough to resist and stand up against the American Empire. Even if there was another candidate it'd have been a land slide win. Granted there are also those who accept him feeling they can't do anything about it, certainly some are afraid of him as well but they seem to be out numbered. What's frightening to me about that is the Iraqi people loyal to Saddam place their blame on America for all of their problems. Our sanctions have killed 500,000 of their children (being really really conservative on those numbers, many claim they're much higher,) have destroyed their economy, have shattered their quality of life. They harbor a hatred for us that is at the point of irrationality. The fact that Saddam is also to blame for their suffering due to his spending the little money he's receiving while these sanctions are imposed on his military is irrelevant to his supporters. Though the money is no where near enough to solve the problems for the Iraqi people, they are content none the less with him building his military, watching their lives fall apart, and letting every ounce of their anger fall upon America. What happens when our bombs start falling and kill the only thing they have left, their families? What happens when sole survivors walk away from the rocks that used to be their home with their families dead, their lives ruined from years of sanctions, with nothing to live but a hatred for America? Don't say it couldn't happen, Afghanistan is a perfect example of this. Despite the wonders of our technology, it can still fail. Intelligence can be wrong, judgement calls can be incorrect. Many innocent lives were lost in Afghanistan, people who wanted America to liberate them originally. But by the time the war had passed, look how many Afghani's were furious and wanted America to leave. How did we make it up to them? By raining 100 dollar bills on them of course. What happens when the people don't want America there in the first place, in fact, they despise America? It doesn't take too much effort to realize the outcome of such. Even if Saddam must go (I don't agree, but will elaborate in a few days with my real reasons) we'll be breeding enemies much more dangerous than him who will be unavoidable in dealing with.<P>If it must be done I did like Iadar's earlier approach of military snipers, but how effective these teams are in a reality based situation like this remains to be seen. The situation is far more complicated then dropping a sniper in and picking off Saddam. More unfortunately the information that has been released regarding tactics follows the approach of weeks of bombing to knock out Iraqi infrastructure, followed by ground troops in close combat. The results of which could be a disaster.<P><BR>Meanwhile Al Qaeda is hidden in the shadows of the world, and the effort to find them has been reduced from what once was the greatest unifying principal of America (arguably the world too) for a few months. The threat of an enemy that actually has attacked America and has promised to do so again has been replaced in the minds of Americans with the questionable threat of an isolated dictator who "might" attack us if provoked according to CIA director George Tenet. What happens if in the middle of the war Al Qaeda decides to strike again? Oh that's right - split resources. Even if this is justified through means we don't know, the timing is not right, the support is lacking and our actions are dangerously close to destabilizing 50 years of international communication and cooperation. Just some food for thought, I do not base my decision against the war on those ideas but they're ones I consider must be contemplated.<P>By the way - the liberal media thing is pretty sketchy too, especially with politics after 9/11. The network media is eager to suppress dissent, block difficult questioning, and celebrate patriotism. I have seen just as much liberal attitudes as conservative attitudes in the media through out the last couple years. Since 9/11 it's much different in regards to politics, when you have journalists saying they're practicing self-censorship and regurgitating government lines it's safe to say the media is failing its purpose of providing objective information and balanced reporting for people to make an opinion. The people I've debated with in person seem to have limited knowledge to form their opinions on Iraq and fall back to repeating lines that have no factual backing they heard on Fox or CNN. Now the newspapers and publication based stories seem more keen to provide different angles, even if in some cases it's extreme. Here's some sources on media problems with Iraq <A HREF="http://www.fair.org/international/iraq.html" TARGET=_blank>http://www.fair.org/international/iraq.html</A>  (Make sure to confirm the sources if in doubt, which is a good habit to have when reading any story)

As far as Saddam's recent "election", I think everyone on the planet, including him, knows it was bullshit.  They counted 11 million PAPER ballots in less than 24 hours?<P>Of course he is a dictator.  He is a ruthless bastard.  He is a bad bad man.  But THAT DOESNT MATTER.  The U.S. does not have the right to go around waging war because someone is bad.  The U.S. has been able to take the moral high ground because we aren't an agressive nation, we stand by the little guy when we can (Korea, Vietnam) and don't attack first.  I for one would like for us to continue in that vein.  Because it just erodes our credibility, and will make us in the future have more armed conflicts and less diplomatic ones.  And last I checked, armed conflict is bad.

I"m against if for a very selfish reason... I don't want my husband over there.  Period.  Nor am I keen on others dying as well.<P>That being said... he IS a maniac, slightly off his rocker, but still freaking smart.  He's avoided war with the US this long and has lived this long with snipers breathing down his back.  BUT... I think, given enough provocation to his ego/plans/whatever he could very well complete a nuclear weapon and launch it at the US.  Sort of as a "go out in glory and with guns blazing" kind of thing.<P>I'm never FOR war, no one in their right mind would be, but I have to say I'm not impressed with what comes out of that country (hey, I'm not impressed with what comes out of ours at times).  That doesn't condone innocents being killed, or putting nuclear waste in our atmosphere, might as well salt the earth while we are at it.<P>Still... when all is said on done, I don't KNOW if the world would be a better place without him and with a new unknown regiem in place.  But I am of the opinion that he is evil and really needs to go.  I also think he uses the religious fervor and fanaticism as a weapon without truly feeling it himself.<P>Anyway... if snipers took him out I wouldn't cry too hard....<P>--------------------<P>Nummularia <BR>Warlock<BR>Triton<BR> <IMG SRC="http://home1.gte.net/res04bw5/fairy_bounce09.gif"> <BR><A HREF="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=88897" TARGET=_blank>Bouncey!</A>

Just to clear this up, since there seems to be a real misunderstanding of Iraq's politics and of Saddam in general by Americans. <B>Iraq is a secular state</B>, has never been a Muslim state ruled by Muslim law, and has never declared a holy war on the United States. Somewhere along the lines American's began associating Saddam with the Islamic fundamentalists in that region, grouping them all together as one when they're completely different. Iraq's government is not a theocracy. This does not negate the horrible aspects of his ruling, but none of it was done for a God.<P>The other misconception American's seem to have is that Saddam believes America is his biggest enemy and must be conquered. Far from the truth, America has been an economic annoyance to Saddam (though we're perceived as an enemy by the Iraqi people blaming us for the lost lives) due to our policies and sanctions for the last several years. His biggest enemies have been domestically based, fundamentalists who want to turn Iraq in to an Islamic state (Like the Taliban did in Afghanistan.) Saddam has always felt that those groups will not only delay, but run the potential of completely destroying his plans to make Iraq a modern, secular nation. He hates them more than any other group on earth. Due to our sanctions and the isolation they bring, Saddam has had many years to destroy a lot of his domestic opposition seeking to change the Iraqi infrastructure. <P>So he's never declared a true jihad or holy war in that he has nothing to do with the religion, the people who do have the power are his enemies (the clerics mostly) in that they wish to convert Iraq away from the path of modernization. An interesting note is that Iraqi women have more rights than women in any other Arab state.

This is some of the best postings I've ever seen.  We had a thread like this similar at work, but being a military environment I was labelled a tree-hugger for being opposed to war. Whomever said America has forgotten what war is like is right - I doubt any of those who labelled me "weak" had even been deployed before...<P>As I sit here though I contemplate our society.  The cost of a small operation to remove Saddam would surely be cheaper than waging an all out war.  Can't that money be spent more wisely?  Don't we have our own people starving?  Don't we have alot of homeless?  Billions to be spent on one man when we have suffering within our own borders?!  I also agree with whomever said that this "war" comes at an opportune time to shine light for Bush (although I fear it may very well be back-firing).  Thoughout the history of our nation wars have proven to boost economy and usually the reputation of the leader at the time. <P>Going off onto a tangent - when we do wage war these days - we do so piss poorly.  This might be a thread completely of and in itself.  Our troops go in with out-dated equipment.  Shitty leadership.  And all too often with rules that defy what combat is about i.e. your squad is ambushed and you have to call company who in turn calls battalion who in turn calls brigade and decides whether or not you, the guy being shot at, can return fire.  Not sure if any of you have read but the theater general of Afghanistan started noticing that our special forces folks were beginning to get a little media coverage and all the pictures of them showed em nitty, gritty, unshaven, etc. (blending in maybe?) and ordered that they all get within military standards because it depicted an unprofessional image.  I AM anti-war for the most part.  I feel it should be the absolute last solution.  However, once you commit forces to combat action you go in with the sole purpose of a quick, and highly lethal means.  Complete the objective and then get your ass out safely. We seem to like to wage combat whenever someone does something we don't like, and when we do it - it's half assed and endangers the lives of the soldiers haphazardly.  That is what angers me the most.  They always say "what a hero, he died for his country and made the ultimate sacrifice"  when alot of time it should be "he died for his country based on shitty decisions and piss poor leadership" and to me that is the greatest atrocity we can commit.   The needless killing of anyone based on incompetence.

Those who dont know history are bound to repeat it. The League of Nations (pre-WW2 UN) was unable to control the post-WW1 re-armerment of Germany, by a PARANOID lil man by the name of Hitler. As such it proved itself useless, and became irrelevent. The UN of today is in trouble of following the same route as the League of Nations did b4 WW2. If it is unable to maintain it's own voted resolutions then it will by default become useless. The legislative body of the UN is only as effective as it's ability to enforce it's descisions.<P>1 - Iraq invades Kuwait<P>2 - UN calls for an immediate Iraq retreat (not US)<P>3 - UN is ignored by Iraq on all fronts<P>4 - UN declairs war with Iraq (not US), with support from all nations (per sae)<P>5 - Iraq launches missile attacks on Israel (who was NOT involved in the war, declaring "Jihad" or ALL OUT BAR NONE HOLY war against the "infidels") <P>6 - War ends to unconditional surrender<P>7 - UN lays down sanctions (not US) and conditions (inspectors have unlimited access to Iraq for weapons inspections)<P>8 - UN makes resolutions preventing the re-armerment of Iraq, specifically noting the production of weapons of mass destruction <P>9 - UN insectors (not US) are denied access and thrown out of Iraq<P>10 - UN does NOTHING and by defacto proves itself ineffective<P>11 - 9/11 happens, world as a whole denounces terrorism (with a few exceptions who dance in the streets)<P>12 - US links Osama and Afganistan<P>13 - US goes to war with Afganistan<P>14 - US president says Iraq is re-arming and building WOMD, and has ties to terrorism<P>15 - US president says that if the UN is unable to deal with Iraq the US will<P>I dont think any of these events are in question to validity or even in real dispute at the moment. <P>It was mentioned that Iraq wouldnt be stupid enough to attack the US. I think that is probably true, openly ... I think it would simply attack the US using fueled hatreds and private terristic wars (not directly linkable to the government). I also think it that Iraq would however in time launch a "Jihad", holy war against Israel. I also think that Israel would defend itself to the best of it's abilities. This would bring the entire region into MASSIVE termoil. <P>The current discussions of a post-Iraq war are being layed out similar to post German war occupation. I know many ppl have said that if the US occupies Iraq, it would only fuel MUCH more terrorism from the supressed masses. I have to look back to history and ask how much back lash did the US and USSSR have from post-war German occupation? Once Germany's government was removed and the German people were allowed progress in thier own way, Germany has become one of THE most productive and greatest countries of all time. The same goes for Japan (although, of course there was no occupation of Japan). <P>Countries throughout history have become very agressive when thier Rulers (almost always dictators) have become deluded with power. This is exactly the reason the US has limited terms for presidencies, so that the US, which could very easily fall into a dictatorship, does not fall under the spell of a single individual.<P>There of course is a ton more that can and Im sure will be said ... but I want to wait for reactions to reply to before saying to much more 8-)<P>PS: I beg to differ with you Giantt on your Iraq postulations ... but:<P>"The Iraqi government, in its first reaction to several days of bloodshed in the Palestinian territories, called on Sunday for "a jihad (holy war) to liberate Palestine".<P>AFP<P>"If little Bush considers his aggression a message to Iraq, then we have the answer, which is the formation of al-Quds army ... ready for jihad (holy war) and liberating Palestine," the official Iraqi daily Al-Thawra said in a front-page editorial.<P>--------------------<P><A HREF="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=45917" TARGET=_blank> <IMG SRC="http://members.cox.net/gstg/ironsig.gif"> </A><P><A HREF="http://www.PlaneofMischief.com" TARGET=_blank>www.PlaneofMischief.com</A><P><A HREF="http://216.65.86.10/~user5727/bb.htm" TARGET=_blank> <IMG SRC="http://members.cox.net/gstg/sigbb.jpg"> </A>

Good post Iron... sums up what a lot of people seem to have missed.<P>Most seem to think what the news portrays is true. That Bush is an oil "farmer" and wants it for his benefit, and that he wants to avenge his Daddy...<P>I'd have to dissagree with both of those points, as President Bush does not make decisions by himself. There are approximately 500 other people that were elected by the people, and act for the people. <P>President Bush really doesn't have the authority to wage an all out war on another country without the permission of those 500 other people that the people of the U.S. elected.<P>All of the animosity you have towards Bush may be well placed in your mind, but quite a few people are missing the fact that he is not the end all be all of the government.

The term "Globocop" comes to mind when i think about the situation at hand today.<P>Ever since the begining of the 20th Century, the US has looked at itself as a Global Enforcer of ideals that it deems as "Justice". The US in my eyes is a good country because of the ideals that we hold in our government and live by, i.e. freedoms that are recorded in the constitution.<P>However, these ideals do not work with the world around us. The US has a very deadly problem in that we cannot understand that other countries have lived for centuries by certain patterns, such as genocide, hate, and tyrannic governments. Perhaps this is because we are a very young nation, but nonethelesss we do not comprehend these crucial differences.<P>From WWI to WWII, Korea to Vietnam, The Balkans to the Gulf, the US has always intervened where it did not have to. The results have sometimes been for the better, but many times it has resulted in tragedy and great loss.<P>I personally think that the conditions that exist today would result in an unfavorable loss of life, and catastrophe beyond belief. And that isn't worth it.<P>--------------------<P><A HREF="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=214501" TARGET=_blank>Xerath Dar'Khan</A><BR>Arch Mage of <A HREF="http://www.tritonguild.com" TARGET=_blank>Triton</A>

As I said Iraq is a secular state not based on a religion which goes directly contrary to what a Jihad is. If some official did indeed say it (need more info on the source) I'll need to verify his position, and if it was a mandate from the government (Saddam) or just a bureacrat trying to intimidate people (Israel) with the fear of "jihad." <P>Iraq being secular cannot declare a true Jihad. They do not follow the principals or beliefs, and as I said above they are deeply against them in regards to their domestic influence on Iraq(hence, not wanting them to burden Iraq's modernization with their religion.) I'm thinking the official who used it must have meant either two things, for Arabs who are sympathetic to palestine to liberate them as the quote said, which is not declaring a holy war in that they have no authority to do so. Or were esentially declaring the same result - war. But either way Iraq not being islamic cannot declare the holy war.<P>I'll go with it for a minute though and assume it was true, I could believe some Iraqi bureacrat in the main government saying that. But not a mandate from Saddam and a true voicing of their government. They being sympathetic to Palestine along with a lot of the middle east feel more than justified in defending them, to most of the middle east Israel is justifiably the bad guy. To the west Palestine is justifiably the bad guy (Neither consider they're both responsible for what's happening.) So if it's true, it's similar to vocally supporting what you view as a people being oppressed and cheering for their liberation.

As far as evidence as to who said what, etc ... The report is not from a US source, but from the AFP.

Thanks Iron I'll certainly look in to it, but like I said either way the effects of Iraq declaring a vocal support for a jihad wouldn't matter even if it was a mandate from Saddam himself (unlikely though.) A real Jihad comes with support of the religion where as Iraq's cheer for it would be largely ignored when it came to taking action. <P>So assuming it's true it would be similar to a country rallying support for what it views to be a people in need of liberation who are being abused. It has no real value or effect though since they're not followers of the religion as a government (or individuals from what I understand.) <b>Edit:</b> Read the links, still bearing his government did, it's not a Jihad because of the authority problem. Look how much Iraq's calls for the Jihad last Febuary actually acomplished... Not much more than if you or I did because no one in the Iraqi government has the authority to declare one.<P> Now the suspected rumors of Saddam paying the families of suicide bombers (still factually unconfirmed) if those turn out to be true that would have an effect and I'd certainly consider that to be more substantial than Iraq cheering for a Jihad.<P><BR>I'm saying too much too soon though and wanted to give more people a chance to get their views out so I'll come back in a few days with my big post. I changed my post a little just to clarify that he has no authority to declare a jihad even if they speak the word just to avoid confusion bearing the quote.

Minor note, which sounds sort of contrary , but I actually understand the "vote" that occured in Iraq recently and do find that it has some validity.<P>It was proclaimed as an "election" by the media, but was in fact a vote of confidence. Similar to an impeachment vote. It really has nothing to do with opposing or competing rulers. It is simply a vote Yes or No do you support the current regieme.<P>As such it did have validity, unfortunatlely it seemed to have the opposite effect on the world in general. As most seemd to look it as a dictator's one party election, rather then a vote of confidence by the people of Iraq.<P>BTW ... in a few days I have a wonderful "BOMB" post that the conspiracy theory peoeple will absolutely LOVE to read.<P>Also one of the main reasons that an "assassination" team is not a valid or even feasable solution, besides the obvious political and morale ramifications, is that operations like this are NO WHERE near as easy as many ppl in the US believe them to be. For an example of this look at the MANY failed attempts to remove Fidel Castro from power by the CIA and military intellegence throughout the cold war. Opperations like that seem like simple things, but the logistics are FAR from that. For a video game playing society it may seem like a simple solution, but when you see the HUGE logistics involved, you would be MUCH easier to kill a US president then to take a pot shot at dictator such as is in Iraq.<P>--------------------<P><A HREF="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=45917" TARGET=_blank> <IMG SRC="http://members.cox.net/gstg/ironsig.gif"> </A><P><A HREF="http://www.PlaneofMischief.com" TARGET=_blank>www.PlaneofMischief.com</A><P><A HREF="http://216.65.86.10/~user5727/bb.htm" TARGET=_blank> <IMG SRC="http://members.cox.net/gstg/sigbb.jpg"> </A>

I'm going to try and keep it short, at work. I am in The United States Marine Corps stationed in Okinawa, Japan. In the Gulf war, pretty much half of the people to go to Iraq we're from Okinawa. I support what President Bush is doing, I think he's doing a great job addressing problems. We had a security brief on terrorists and such and the stuff I heard was just sickening. There are tons of countries out there that hate us, I don't know what country does this, but I think it was Iraq, they have a day every year where they march down the streets burning American flags and chanting Death to Americans and all sorts of things. I get to see a lot of things most civilians don't and it has changed my mind a lot. I do support the war with Iraq. Do I see him as a problem now? No not really, but within 5 years yes I do believe he will be a big problem. The Iraq vote was a Yes or NO vote, but for the vote it was to see if Saddam would stay in Power for another 7 years (that's how it works over there). Does anyone think Saddam will comply with the UN inspectors coming in? Highly doubtful, he is hiding something and knows whats coming. I read up that Saddam just did an Amnesty (sp?) For every single prisoner in Iraq. Even ones sentenced to death, if they would help fight for Iraq. Who wouldn't fight for getting out of jail for free. Do I expect the war to be long? I think it will be longer then the Gulf war, but not much longer. The Gulf war didn't last very long, it took five days once we invaded for them to start surrendering. The American government is smart, they knew that Iraq would be reading headlines so they had Time magazine publish our military tatic on what we would do to them. When we came in we started to show we were doing the plan shown in Time. Once they started sending everyone to the ocean the Navy started shooting up the land for a few days, and the Marines Moved in from the sides un-detected, I've talked to a few who were there, and they said they were holding up white flags walking over in hundreds surrendering. Military wise Iraq has a lot, but they are weak. This time around Saddam knows it's life or death so I don't think he will play fair, he will be dirty and use biological weapons a lot more. Sorry this is all one cluster at work trying to type fast, so it probably doesn't make much sense.<P>Semper Fidelis,<P><BR>Sempr<BR>60 Assassin<BR>Triton
