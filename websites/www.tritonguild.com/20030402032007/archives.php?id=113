<p><font face=Verdana size=2>79 keyed people, 45 weapons and 22 minutes of love.. and the result?... Emperor dead for the first time ANYWHERE!! Super huge props to the whole guild who basically dropped every raid for weeks ( read : 2 months ) on a whim to achieve this goal as a guild. Yes it's a queer timesink, yes we nearly went crazy AE'ing the mines and waiting for C2's to pop.. but guess what? WE ARE FUCKING DONE WITH IT ALL COCKSUCKERS AND NOW WE'RE GONNA FARM THIS BASTARD...   </font></p>

<p><font face=Verdana size=2>Yah yah, everyone is dying to see the loots. Well, I'm gonna be honest with you, we fucking scored.</p><p><b><i>*EDIT* Rombus here, Zaar was fucking high when he said we 'fucking scored' with loots.  yeah, the robe is nice, but c'mon, is it really something that should come off of THIS encounter?  The effect doesn't even stack with C3 ffs!  Now c'mon, with the exception of solo applications that robe from Rumblecrush is better.  Get your heads out of your asses, VI, and fucking fix this.  Oh yeah, the robe is a SOLID BRIGHT BLUE color, looks like something you just picked up from your guildmaster.  C'mon, give it a nice god damn look!  Change by next patch k thx~*END EDIT*</i></b></p>

<p><font face=Verdana size=2>Now that thats over with, I'm going to do something I've always wanted to do. For the longest time. I'm going to sit here and tell you how to beat the Emperor. No, it doesn't involve the super cheese tactics of having melee bandage people and pull aggro and have mobs summon people up to emp room that don't have keys from the basement ( posting ss is above me, pointing it out isn't, fix that shit Verant ) , I'm talking the real strat. He's got 8 friends. Control those while you fight the emp. Pin the emp, and kill him. Rez people after they eat the DT. THERE YOU HAVE IT. Now, whenever any other guild out there beats the emp, I HANDED YOU THE FIGHT ON A FUCKING PLATTER. THANKS. Oh and most of all, never underestimate the force of ykesha...</font></p>

<p><font face=Verdana size=2>Well thats all folks, thanks to all the people that shot us tells and what not with congrats, we worked hard to get this guy first and while I know there are lots of guilds out there that get serverwide firsts all the time, this is our first one, and we picked a damn nice target... Cya's all in Vex Thal~</font></p>
