              swear this guild can't grasp the concept of taking a break. Triton 
              beat the shit out of our favorite ass loot mobs today. Klandicar 
              the hermaphrodite, Root's very own identical twin and Velkwhore 
              the Sor..Dumbfuck, also known as the smile and pretend you give 
              a fuck about the caster's loot mob.<br>
              <br>
              The call was made at 5:00 pm mst to gather at Dragon Nerfropolis. 
              We slapped around a few buffs and prepared to attack. Our favorite 
              'Movie Mockery Mofo' Krellixious Decimus Meridus gave the order 
              to charge, then immediately logged off to level Arlan and Cebarsis. 
              The only death was our brave Enchaladin Pircilis, she foolishly 
              tried to melee Klandicar and was promptly crushed.<br>

<p><b><font face=Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif size=-1 color=#000000>Our 
              favorite Hermaphrodite was bitch slapped twice before surrendering 
              to the bad ass mother fuckers known as Triton. Congratulations to 
              Heihachi on his Klandicar's Talisman for his ST key. Specki picked 
              up a pair of <a href=http://www.gameznet.com/eq/equipment/ss/peerlessdragonlegbreeches.jpg>Peerless 
              Dragonleg Breeches</a>. Seugor our resident pimp gnome rogue jacked 
              a new pair of fine quality pimped out <a href=http://www.gameznet.com/eq/equipment/ss/peerlessdragonhidegauntlets.jpg>bitch 
              slapping gloves</a>. After loot was distributed someone commented 
              it was early still and the casters were planning another revolt 
              against the Triton leadership. Half the guilded ninja ported to 
              Great Divide, leaving 12 people defenseless to be slaughtered by 
              Ice Burrowers.<br>
              <br>
              Eventually Wolfherz bitched enough in guild chat to get everyone 
              over to Velkwhore's. However, he became so disruptive and offensive 
              in guildchat he was temporarily removed, allowing the damaged moral 
              of Triton to recover. Let's face it, Wolfherz is a real bastard. 
              After that incident we quickly set through the dungeon and came 
              to the door of our caster's twisted view of fulfillment. <br>
              <br>
              Krohn ran to his door, pounded twice and ran away. Velkwhore, curious 
              at the knocking cautiously crept out of of his lair to find 36 
              Tritons ready to send his punk ass back to Russia. Velkwhore, who 
              evidently is the one responsible for funding the Leveon flames on 
              EQVault *<a href=http://vnboards.ign.com/message.asp?topic=9929607&replies=209>cough</a>*, 
              decided he was going to be a big fucking joker and told us the following

              give it up for the storm giant defector. He really does know the

              on EQVault. The speech didn't have the terrorizing effect Velkwhore 
              the Dumbfuck aimed for. Instead Triton busted out with Yo momma's 
              jokes on Velkwhore, leaving him stunned at the devastating words

              With some quick hack and slash action, Mr. Dumbfuck went down. Though
