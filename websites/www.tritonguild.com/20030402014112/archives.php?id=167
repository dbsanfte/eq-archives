<font face=verdana size=2>Dear SoE, I would like to bring to your attention the fact that some guilds raid as late as 5-6am on weekends. They get tired.. I also think it is imperative that you know some gamers drink, and some even smoke illegal substances, in turn leaving there perception skills a little lacking... To go even further, I would like to point out that in the Fennin event, some mobs are very commonly known to drop 3-4 runes. My request is that you make sure that the event that has taken place in the screenshot below is fixed. I've heard of it happening elsewhere and at least I can use the item, but the point is, it's retarded. Change the fucking graphic.</font><br>

<font face=verdana size=2>On a side note to our viewers, we're in farm mode atm since we have another guild close on our heels. So it might be a while till we get around to ganking anything new. We're in no rush~</font><br>
