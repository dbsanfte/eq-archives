<p><font face=Verdana size=2>Since we dropped Emporer back a few weeks ago, we've been working really god damn hard at getting the guild into Vex Thal. Well tonight we had all 26/26 keys online and planned to poke our noses around the zone. We had sent 11 people in the night before to kill some yard trash but tonight we wanted to kill something, anything that resembled some sort of boss... I'll get to that in a bit... So we began moving through the zone, which at first glance appears to be the ugliest zone ever, mainly due to the fact that you can't see ten feet in front of your face.. we couldn't have been more wrong... check out some of the screenshots, it has to be one of the best looking zones in the game. </font></p>

<p><font face=Verdana size=2>This zone is absolutely HUGE, and it's not comparable to sleepers or VP or any other of those typed zones. All they have in common is needing a key. So anyways, like I said we were after some type of boss.. and we weren't to be dissapointed.. Enter 'John'. No his name isn't John, but thats what we're gonna call him to keep tabs. There is no fucking way in hell we're gonna try and remember these mobs names.. so here is John and his loot.. I'll leave it up to other people to whine about the loot because I'm not gonna.. It's not to bad for the mob. This was a first run and this guy seemed like the rhag1 of VT. Mind you the fight was incredible, lasting 25 mins with adds ( mobs = hard ).. Some things those mobs can do.. are nuts... ae lure 1500dd's, ae lure silence, ae lure blind etc etc..  </font></p>

<p><font face=Verdana size=2>Stay tuned for more Vex Thal stuff... as for other things during the week, well.. we killed stuff.. no we're not gonna stop updating with other shit we kill but I figured this update would just be on our first run into VT.</font></p><br>
