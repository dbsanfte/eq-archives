<p><font face=Verdana size=2>Okay, so as if you didn't see it coming.. Bertox dead finally, in what I'd say was a perfect fight. We were so god damn determined not to lose it was ridiculous. The only problem was, killing bert is nothing really special now since about 5 other guilds have... I mean sure we had all the L33t Beta Infoz, who didn't.. we all know there is only ONE guild out there that didn't have em, they actually had to walk through 10 feet of snow JUST to get to CoD.. Anyways, since we were a little behind on the Bert kill, I ask all you other guilds out there that won.. DID YOU WIN THE FIGHT AS FROGLOKS.. DID YOU?!</font></p>

<center><a href=http://www.tritonguild.com/images/leet/bertdead.jpg><img src=/images/leet/bertdead.jpg align=absmiddle  width=515 height =400></a></center>

<p><font face=Verdana size=2>Alright, alright.. who am I kidding here.. Furor whining about all the L33t Beta InfoZ isn't actually all that far off from the truth. I have a big confession to make here guys, and while I am still forbidden to release the following screenshot due to the NDA, I feel the public need to see this and for you other guilds out there that traded in your tokens for these same advantages, shame on you too..</font></p>

<p><font face=Verdana size=2>The loot we got from Bertox was pretty retarded for the encounter, and in Verants defense, lets play a little game. If enough people can distinguish the 1 loot that didn't come off bertox from the 2 that did, then maybe it is balanced and I'm just smoking crack. What I'll do is I'll post 3 items of fairly equal uberness and what you guys can do is try and guess which one really didn't drop from him.. there is no trick either, but I will warn you again, this will be tricky, since all 3 items are almost as good as each other. Good luck! </font></p>

<p><font face=Verdana size=2>Before you continue reading this update, go back and look at the loots again, just to make sure. Are you SURE you picked out the wrong one? Don't be so sure of yourself. Anyways asides from our friend bert here, we've been having a clusterfuck of a time wondering what the hell we're supposed to be doing with allt he patches and changes to the flags. Since the last update we've killed tallon/vallon about 10 times I shit you not, Behemot, HoH trials, Aerin Dar, Terris, Rallos Zek, Saryrn, MM, trials here, trials there, flags here, flags there... you get the picture.. we've been killing <i>everything</i> that we can. ( Yea Rallos was a joke momo's, you can quit dialing that conferance call to tell all your friends ).</font></p>
<br>
<p><font face=Verdana size=2>So I was sitting here thinking what could make this update really great. I mean, what could really top out this update to make the bertox kill even better.. then it struck me, so I decided to call up some friends. Low and behold not only did I get DR.Zaar to come chat with us, I also got Furor from Fires of Heaven and Povar's resident stalker/retard Nuugharm from Rising Ascension. Truly I cannot believe my luck!! So without further adieu, I shall hand the floor over to them..( btw, it's amazing that someone would actually give me there L/P for IL board for 5k and a windblade wuwu~ )</font></p>

<p><font face=Verdana size=2>I had a killer update planned but unfortunetly the cards weren't in our favour tonight. Lets just say we got him to 4% and the fight started about 30 seconds after the last king died. It wasn't pretty. You know you just love <b><i>uhhh he's like, here</b></i>, followed by 50 <i>Hail, Bertoxxulous</i>. We fought the valiant fight but I guess we're just gonna have to wait 3 more days.../sigh</i></font></p>
