Of course that bastard spawned (who, by the way, cannot be hit by Porlos' Fury!) 
and beat the living shit out of us, but it was worth it.  I think everyone that was there 
will agree with me when I say that this was one of my most memorable days in Triton.

      you won't see Sleeper's Tomb for a very long time, and Primal still drops.

      on the FoH site.  We used the same one we had over two weeks ago when 
      we got him down to 48% with 39 people.  Guess what, add 10 more

    we decided to pay a visit to Kael's resident bitch, King Tormax.  As 
    usual he fell with no problems (except he died in skelly form.. fuck you 
    Minael!) and coughed up some Boots of the Storm for Siruz and unknown, 
    Velium Encrusted Gauntlets for Dreadwar, a White Dragonscale Sash for 
    Solvan, and a pair of White Dragonscale Boots for Archie.</font><p>
    <font face=Verdana size=2>After that we ran up to drop Vindicator, he 
    also died in skelly form (for the love of god, STOP TURNING THESE MOBS INTO 
    SKELETONS!  Fuck you, Zaar!)  He put out a pair of boots for 
    Mardigann and a Necro spell which the shits refused to loot.  Finally 
    Statue came and died (you guessed it, in skelly form... die, Brownivy) 
    putting out a Cloak of the Falling Stars for Soffit and two (yes two) 
    Reavers for Elrood and me.</font></p>
    <p><font face=Verdana size=2>Lucky day for us, the zone repoped!  
    Hopped back down, dropped Tormax and congratulated Anlon and Celandro on

<p><font face=Verdana size=2>So it turns out that Gorenaire was up and about 
in Dreadlands harassing Grimdoom again.  We felt it was our duty to quickly 
dispatch of her so we headed over and owned her (/yawn).  She put out 
nothing worth mentioning because it was total shit.  Finally the night 
ended with a Venril Sathir sighting!  We quickly knocked him out of the 
running for Uber Mob of the Month and found he was carrying a pair of Tolan's 
and Jaundiced Bone legs.  If you're interested in these send Zaar a tell in 
game (haha, prepare to be spammed, FAG!).</font></p>
