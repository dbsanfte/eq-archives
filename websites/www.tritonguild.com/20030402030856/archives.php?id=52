    <td width=81%><font face=Verdana size=2>Triton is looking to recruit <i>dedicated</i>,
      <i> team-oriented</i> players who want a chance to take down the biggest mobs in the game with some of the best players on Povar.  If you can see yourself putting
      in the effort that it takes to become a Triton member, send in your application to
      <a href='mailto:bashm69@hotmail.com?subject=Application for Triton Membership'>bashm69@hotmail.com</a>. 
      Be sure to include your class, level, play time, and raid experience.</font>
      <p><font face=Verdana size=2>Keep in mind, we're only accepting
      hardcore, dedicated players.  If you are an <b>extremely</b> active
      player, love raiding, and have a level 58+ character on the Povar server,
      you may have what it takes.  Triton <b>does not</b> accept server
      transfers, so if you're not currently on Povar don't bother
      applying!  Keep in mind, we are a raiding guild.  If raiding
      isn't for you or you don't have a lot of play time, Triton is not the
      right guild for you.  Good luck.</font></td>
