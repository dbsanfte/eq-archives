              pissed that Dickhead the Rearindicator hasn't been paying us our 
              weekly fees for being our bitch, we went to Kael to teach him and 
              all his fuck face friends a lesson... No one fucks Triton and gets 
              away with it. We walked straight through Kael to the Rearindicator 
              and found out why we haven't been paid.... The dipshit ordered giant 
              sized real doll replicas of Elrood, Astennu, and Rombus. If you 
              don't know what a real doll is, you're too much of a normal person 
              to be reading this website, fuck off!<br>
              <br>
              Dickhead, this is not 'Nam. This is being our bitch. There are rules, 
              you pay up on time or you're going to enter a world of pain. GOD 
              DAMN IT ARE WE THE ONLY ONES WHO GIVE A SHIT ABOUT THE RULES ANYMORE?! 
              Vindicator.. Prepare to be fucked Triton style.</font></b></p>

              King too hoe. Loot off of Vindicator was GASP our first fucking

              I don't know, but my educated guess is that it went to a druid?</font></b></p>
            <p align= left ><b><font face= Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif  size= -1 >As 
              many of you know, we replaced the Statue of Rallos Zek with a shrine 
              dedicated to Mr. T Marx. Interestingly, Kael zoning and construction 
              officials found our shrine to be 'dangerous and poorly built.' Apparently 
              it violated several of their city safety ordinances and was torn 
              down in order to rebuild the statue of their god.... Negative on 
              that one Houston, if you EVER touch our fucking shrine to Mr. T 
              Marx again, we're going to burn your fucking city down. </font></b></p>

              we're sitting around chilling, talking about old times when the 
              Avatar of War himself wanders out of the Arena. He starts shouting 
              some shit about it's blasphemous to replace the God of War with 
              a communist statue of a TV icon. He offers the ultimatum - rebuild 
              the old statue or face the wrath of Rallos Zek. Our response was 
              short and sweet 'Cry us a fucking river, if you don't like 
              it -- go back to Russia.'</font></b></p>

              fluries every 2 - 3 rounds, oh yeah and about the same HP as the
