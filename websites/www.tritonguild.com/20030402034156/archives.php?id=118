    A SHIT NOW THAT I KNOW YOU'RE NUKING!  Funny thing was Munwin says he

The Avatar of Whore (check out that clever play on words).  After an 
entertaining battle the objective for this search and destroy mission was 
achieved - Bizzaro was dead!  Once he died we killed the AoW and gave two 
rings to Elvaar and Fuedar as well as two Swords to Dryzlil and Aoreke.

<p><font face=Verdana size=2>So that just about wraps up this week's update.  
I'm bored, someone give me something to do that IS NOT CAMPING THOSE ASSHOPPER 
SHARDS!  Yeah, asshopper is the new word to describe shard camps.  
Why?  It's simple, you kill something that gives ass EXP for shards and 
then you hop over to another camp that either gives ass EXP or just doesn't 
drop.  Here's my other gripe about these camps... most are in places that 
are regularly camped by lower levels for normal EXP.  Now they're getting 
pushed out because we're busy doing time_sink03... Oh, speaking of lower levels 
getting EXP at shard camps I just want to give a big shout out to Soccrates 
(sorry if I spelled it wrong) for helping so many Triton members get their 
Dawnshroud shard.  Thanks man. ;)</font></p>
<p><font face=Verdana size=2>Oh yeah, next update will be done by a surprise 
guest celebrity!  OMG!!!</font></p>
