WRONG!  Teams were sent to investigate the issues with the login server,
kicked the living shit out of it, then came back and joined us on our night of

Disappointed, tired, and out of mana, we were wondering where this leader could
possibly be.  We heard that another guild had cleared Fear and almost got
Cazic, but people were leaving and they didn't have enough to try again. 
Cazic is the leader of Fear, umm great leader I guess?  All I have to say
is that if I was The Stoic I would be tearing my hair out right now, much like
we did last week when we found out we passed up a CT with an eye...</font></p>
