		<b><font face= Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif  size= -1> At this point, Vanilla Ice began to prance around the Temple, dancing like a stereotypical white boy. Unfortunately, Vanilla's threats had the horrible effect of making gay lovers Gorox and Darren go into a complete panic, at the thought of never seeing Elrood, Rombus, or Astennu dressed up like rejects from a Gay Pride March again. Due to the commotion their pleading was causing, we were not able to continue our raid! In a situation like this, we have only one choice. Since Triton is so used to dealing with threats by white rappers, we followed our standard 'Triton Manual' - Section D0NK3Y ordinance. We quickly had all of our enchanters chain cast Sentinel, causing Vanilla Ice to stagger under the bright Disco lights. Well, folks, it seems that Disco and Whiteboy rapping just don't mix. Once we had recovered from our blindness, not to mention our pings of 2500, no longer did Vanilla Ice stand in front of us, but rather a VERY LARGE MOTHERFUCKING DRAGON. </font></b></p>

		<b><font face= Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif  size= -1> Unfortunately, only Triton's Cricket Team was present, as the Paratroopers were busy taking their 'vacation' with Root. We were forced to call in none other than Junior Czar, Walter the Flaming Donkey, to deal with Vanilla Ice/Dozekar. As soon as Walter arrived, Dozekar was promptly raped. It was terrible folks. The whole scene reminded me of that time Minael dropped the soap in front of Phranque. Dear god. Anyhow, Dozekar's first drops on Povar were 2 black tears, and 1 runed tear, which are used for the Hall of Testing quests that produce the uber loot posted on practically every EQ page on the net.</font></b></p>
