<font size=+2>Recent News</font><br>
(Updated February 2/99)<br><br>

<font size=+1>Good news for US/Canada fans of US series</font><br><br>

<font size=-1>It's a great month to get into Cracker.  Not only has Canada decided to run the UK series in it's entire episodic format, but now A&E has decided to start running the US series.  I was just on their web page and noticed that starting Feburary 22nd, they plan to run one Cracker episode a night for that entire week.  One of these episodes appears to be "The Club", one of the now imfamous "canned" episodes that was never shown on ABC.  Hopefully this means they will show more than the five they have allocated, but they don't appear to list anything past this month so we may have to wait and see.  Get out your VCRs people, this one won't come around again anytime soon.  You can read up on the details on A&E's Schedule for this month, there's a link to their page in the links area.<br><br></font>

<font size=+1>Couple of new items added</font><br><br>

<font size=-1>Added two news photos from the US series to the Gallery as well as both a review of the US series and an interview with James Sadwith (US series Executive Producer) to the Downloadables area.<br><br></font>

<font size=+1>Slight upgrades to the website</font><br><br>

<font size=-1>Changed a couple of things like the typeface used for the site (the last one was god awful, what was I thinking?) and added in an area for old news and stories as well as a gallery area for the great behind the scenes shots that Noelle gave us and any more that decide to rear their head in future.  There's also some news that I got before the upgrades to the site that many of you may not have seen before.  Those are included in the news and stories section, as they're technically old news by now, I've just been too lazy to tell you all about them.  My appologies for this, but I work part time and attend a University full time which leaves me with almost no time.<br><br></font>

<font size=+1>Great news for Canadian viewers!</font><br><br>

<font size=-1>Showcase is showing the series in it's episode format every Sunday evening in Canada.  As I write this, they've already shown the first three episodes, but it looks like they're going through the whole series from start to finish, possibly even including "White Ghost".  What's even better about this run is that it's the first time in Canada that we've been able to see the original episodes uncut, unlike the A&E episodes, which have about 15 minutes per episode taken out per compiled movie.  Don't ask me why A&E does it, but they do.</font>
