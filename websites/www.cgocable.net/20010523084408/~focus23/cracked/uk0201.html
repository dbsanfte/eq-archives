In the dreary city of Manchester, an Asian shopkeeper is found brutally murdered.  The police syspect a racially motivated attack.  Fitz does not agree.  As the police descend into the violent world of Neo-Nazi skinheads looking for the killer, the search comes up empty, and the killer strikes again.  Later, when an investigator is murdered, Fitz is reluctantly called in on the case by Chief Inspector David Bilborough.<br><br>

With the threat of a mass-murder hanging over their heads, Fitz and the police race to find the killer before he can strike again.  But is it too late?<br><br>

Generally considered the best episode of Cracker ever made, it is significant for a couple of reasons.  It rocketed Robert Carlyle into stardom (Hamish Macbeth, The Fully Monty) in possibly his best performance to date.  It also marked the final show for Christopher Eccleston in his role as Detective Chief Inspector David Bilborough and was also destined for a larger career in movies (Shallow Grave, Jude).  Finally, this episode marks the introduction of a new major character to the show, that of the new Detective Chief Inspector Wise.<br><br></font>
