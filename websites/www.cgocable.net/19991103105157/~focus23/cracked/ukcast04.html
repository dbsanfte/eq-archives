<b>Detective Chief Inspector and Fitz' First Boss</b><br>

<hr width=350 align=center size=1 noshade>

Christopher Eccleston is one of the most promising, up and coming new<br>
actors to come out of England in the past few years.  Best known by<br>
us for his incredibly memorably portrayal of DCI Bilborough on Cracker,<br>
he was first seen in films like "Let Him Have It" and "Anchoress" before<br>
he was seen in Cracker.  He must have caught a few eyes in the process<br>
as he immediately went from good to better after leaving the series, when<br>
he was asked to star in Danny Boyle's "Shallow Grave".  Not only was<br>
this one of the best roles Christopher Eccleston has done, but it<br>
internationally launched the film career of Danny Boyle, who was known<br>
in the UK for films like "Twin Town" but went on to create such notorious<br>
films as "Trainspotting" and "A Life Less Ordinary".<br><br>

Some of Eccleston's other credits include "Death and The Compass", the TV<br>
mini-series "Out Friends In The North", "A Price Above Rubies", and<br>
"Jude", in which he starred alongside the very talented and very beautiful<br>
Kate Winslet.<br><br>

Another credit that is very worthy of notice is "Hillsborough", which was<br>
another fine production penned by Jimmy McGovern (who of course wrote<br>
Cracker).  "Hillsbourough" also starred Ricky Tomlinson, who played DCI<br>
Wise on Cracker.  Although not shown widely outside of the UK, it received<br>
excellent reviews from Cracker/McGovern fans who managed to see it.<br><br>
