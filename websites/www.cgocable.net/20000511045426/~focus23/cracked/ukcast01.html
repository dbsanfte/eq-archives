Coltrane leads the cast of the UK series of Cracker. He is an accomplished<br>
actor and comedian. The staggering list of film and television appearances<br>
he has had over the years is almost too large to mention here. Best known<br>
for his work in Cracker, he has also worked with many other people in<br>
the area of television, almost all of it in the field of comedy.<br><br>

One of his first appearances in fact was on the UK series "Are You Being<br>
Served?", but he later made two appearances in "Keep It In The Family",<br>
three appearances on "The Young Ones", as well as the odd appearance<br>
on shows like "Girls On Top" and "Blackadder". Apart from appearances on<br>
these classic UK series, he has also made appearances in some of the following:<br>
"The Comic Strip Presents...", "Tutti Frutti", "Danny, Champion Of The World",<br>
and most recently, "Coltrane In A Cadillac".<br><br>

With regards to his career in film, he has appeared in everything from James<br>
Bond films ("Goldeneye" with Pierce Brosnan) to Shakespearean adaptations<br>
(Falstaff in "Henry V").  His other film credits include "Buddy" (with Rene<br>
Russo), "Frogs For Snakes", "Montana", "The Adventures Of Huck Finn", "Oh,<br>
What A Night!", "Alive and Kicking", "The Pope Must Die", "Triple Bogey On<br>
A Five Par Hole", "Where The Heart Is", "Nuns On The Run", "Perfectly<br>
Normal", "Bert Rigby, You're A Fool", "Let It Ride", "Slipstream",<br>
"The Fruit Machine", "Eat The Rich", "Mona Lisa", "Absolute Beginners",<br>
"Caravaggio", "National Lampoon's European Vacation", "Defence Of The Realm",<br>
"Revolution", "The Supergrass", "Chinese Boxes", "Krull", "Scrubbers",<br>
"Flash Gordon", "La Mort En Direct", and my personal favourite, Lindsay<br>
Anderson's "Britannia Hospital".<br><br>
