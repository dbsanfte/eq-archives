Focus 23 (based in Canada) have been recording musick since the inception of the group on December 25th of 1993.  The main thrust of the musick is based largely on ideas steming from dreams and chaos.  Musick is one of the best mediums for expressing the communication of experimental thought.  Focus 23 is a project for which there is no concrete goal except the exploration of musickal dreams and ideas.  Hopefully, a learning experience is achieved for each of its participants.<BR><BR>

Focus 23 has set about a plan to release different types of media for various projects, including cassettes, videos, computer music files, literature, CDs, and more.  Some Focus 23 products are only put out in limited releases, the amount varying each time.  Submissions of sound/video/unknown will also be accepted from others to be warped and mutated towards the ends of future experiments, fully crediting each owner as per their submission.<BR><BR>

Generally speaking, Focus 23 material is released via a self-run label known as Mutant.  However, most of their material has been distributed by other organizations, such as Xcreteria and Third Force in Canada.<BR><BR>

<B>50/50</B> (1994 - Mutant, also distributed by Third Force, limited to 29) (90 minute cassette)
</CENTER>

This initial release made an attempt to bring about a general theme as to what Focus 23 was to later carry on doing.  The first side of this cassette compiled material created throughout the past few years previous to the creation of the project, with the intent of forming a general preface.  The second side of the cassette featured new material created within the first few months of Focus 23's inception.  Experiments in cut-up, collage, musick composed under the influence of hallucinogenics, ritual musick, and found sound editing formed the basis for this experiment.  Comparisons have been made to the music of The Hafler Trio, Nurse With Wound, and other similar projects.  The cassette came with a special photographic cover.  Quantities of this release still exist, although they are very limited and people should check with Focus 23 via e@mail to see whether they are still available.  A double compact disc version of this release has been mastered by Focus 23 with six live tracks from early radio work, but this version has not been made public.<BR>

This second release marks the first time Focus 23 has been able to release something on compact disc.  Most of the project is also recorded digitally, as opposed to the previously analog material on 50/50.  Snake picks up where the former project left off.  More pieces influenced by hallucinogens, dreams, rituals, magick, chaos, cut-up, and other unforseen circumstances.  Snake opens with analog material recorded shortly after 50/50 was completed and then delves into digital recordings/experiments that have surfaced as a result of the three years following the previous release.  This release is not as long as 50/50, but Focus 23 feel it is of a higher caliber by far.  Comparisons have been made between this release and the hypnotically tribal rhythms of Brian Lustmord.  There are no discernable differences between the cassette version and the compact disc version of this release.<BR>

<B>Xcreteria Volume One</B> (1995 - Xcreteria) (90 minute cassette)
</CENTER>

This compilation from Xcreteria features many different artists, including a Focus 23 track ("<B>Black Spot</B>") originally featured as a preview to the <B>Snake In The Glade</B> cassette, which not yet been released at the time of this appearance.  This version of the track has a slightly different ending than the one featured on <B>Snake In The Glade</B>.<BR><BR>

<B>Live Appearance</B> (October 3rd, 1995)
</CENTER>

This appearance on Hamilton, Ontario's CFMU 93.3 FM show, Dead City Radio saw the performing of "<B>Live</B>", which was intended to be released on <B>Snake In The Glade</B>, but was later lost and had to be partially re-recorded.  This was not actually a "live" performance at all, but rather, a pre-recorded track made for the show.  Generally speaking, Focus 23 have never really done any "live" performances other than their work from radio shows previous to the inception of the group.<BR><BR>

Plans for a third album are now set! It may be some time coming though, as no firm date can be given at this time.  However, work has started on the album, which may come out in the summer of 1999 -- we're not sure.  In any case, the proposed album will be called "I'll Think That Way Too" and it will be available here for free download over the internet in high quality MP3 format.<BR><BR>

Other good news for the rest of you net heads out there.  A few Focus 23 tracks have gone up on the <A HREF="http://www.cgocable.net/~focus23/mutant/index.html">Mutant</A> server.  They're in high quality MP3 format, usable by both PC and Macintosh platforms.<BR><BR>

Again, the "Sources" project and "IP.1" internet project have been indefinitely scrapped.<BR><BR>
