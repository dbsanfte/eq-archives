Coltrane Calls It Quits
August 20, 1996 
NEW YORK (CP)

Robbie Coltrane says he's had enough of his popular award-winning
Cracker character and he's leaving the show at the end of this
season.   "It is my decision to let it go," he said of the Arts
and Entertainment network show.  "The network would quite happily
see us doing Cracker until Penhaligon was drawing her pension, but
I've seen other shows which have gone on and on and it hasn't
helped them."

The final episode at 9 PM EST on September 3rd will be "True
Romance".  In the show, Fitz receives anonymous love letters from
one of his students who, when she realizes she's being ignored by
him, decides the way to get his attention is to go on a killing
spree.  Sex and death, she reasons, is the ideal way to capture
his attention.
