Parasites (now defunct) was a short term project of material compiled by J.Morrow of work 
done by himself and C.Virtanen.  C.Virtanen ran a radio show in Guelph, Ontario for quite 
some time, called <B>Tape Delay</B>.  Some of the show consisted of artists like Nurse With 
Wound, SPK, etc. but on the odd occasion, hours of air time would be devoted to periods of 
self-made noise, tape cut-up experiments sometimes involving tape players/deck/machines in 
the teens all playing at once, being crossfaded, delayed, and more.  Some synth work was 
also explored, mainly by C.Virtanen, that material being used on the radio show as well.  
Later, material done solo by Virtanen and Morrow, as well as together was compiled into a 
few cassette projects meant to memorialize the moment.  A lot of this work shows a definite 
shift in direction for J.Morrow and was a good predecessor to his starting Focus 23 a few 
years later on.  The limited catalogue of work by Parasites is now out of print, but is 
presented below as a post mortem of sorts.<BR><BR>
