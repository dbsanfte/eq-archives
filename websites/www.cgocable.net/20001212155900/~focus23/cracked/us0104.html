A newborn baby has gone missing from the hospital.  A man has been seen leaving the hospital, but regardless of the witnesses and video evidence, Fitz is convinced the kidnapper is a woman.  Truth, however, ends up being more suprising than any wild suspicions.<br><br>

Meanwhile, Fitz and his son are in bitter disagreement over the son's ex-girlfriend and her re-appearance into their lives.  Fitz also attempts to communicate with his wife, which ends up being a mistake.<br><br>

This episode is significant in that it was the first episode made in the US that didn't try to re-hash an existing UK storyline.<br><br>
