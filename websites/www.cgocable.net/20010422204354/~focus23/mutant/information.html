Defining Mutant is like trying to hold down a fish with a greased hand.<BR><BR>

Mutant is located somewhere in Hamilton, Ontario, Canada.  Of this, we are sure.<BR><BR>

The short version of it's story is that it's been around since the late eighties 
and started out as a pet project created by J.Morrow to release cassettes of music 
by himself, his friends, bootlegs, almost anything that came to mind.  This Do-It-
Yourself mentality was not so much born out of punk aspirations, but rather of 
plain old boredom and a desire to pull the occasional prank.  It worked, and 
others got involved.  Mutant eventually began making and distributing videos 
from the bands on the label in the form of compilations, as well as video bites, 
some of which were sent out to Canada's video station, MuchMusic, as a joke.  
It's presumed they didn't get the joke as none of the videos have ever surfaced 
on the "music station".<BR><BR>

Eventually things went beyond music and video and delved into almost anything 
that could have a product number slapped on it.  The product number became a 
joke.  Bills advertising events were given product numbers, as were concerts 
held by the artists, t-shirts, etc.  You name it, if it was remotely associated 
with Mutant, it was given a product number, which is why the product catalogue 
is still, to this day, completely out of control.  This madness was more of a 
joke about groups like Factory Records, who insisted on doing the same thing -- 
hell, they even gave an egg-timer a code once, so the process was pretty open to 
interpretation.<BR><BR>

There are a ton of bands that have passed through Mutant, most of them dada-rock 
crazies out to stir up trouble and no good.  Some of them did just that.  One 
group, Cancerhead, released a whole cassette of prank phone calls completely set 
to bad synth music for a total of ninety minutes.  Over 50 albums have been 
released, most of them cassette releases (hey, it was the eighties and we were 
really poor), although most releases done through Mutant now come out in CD 
format.  Over 10 samplers were released, some of them over two hours in length! 
From synth dance bands like the Cunning Linguists to punk bands like The Semen 
Heads.  There was a virtual cavalcade of dadist trickers that passed through the 
label, such as Thank You For Not Smoking, Idiot Spaceman, Shit Ass Panic, Rodel 
Cast, Cancerhead, Penishead, Large Dong, Gorf, The Rejects, Gerber The Wonder 
Baby, and many many more.<BR><BR>

There aren't many people who've released a catalogue this extensive.  Basically 
anything that could be released, was, quickly, and without question.  Only a few 
people have done similar.  Some Japanese noise artists like Yamatsuko Eye have 
just about released themselves into oblivion, as well as the now notorious 
Canadian group, Tropism, who used to release an album a week.  Not sure if they 
do anymore but I wouldn't be suprised if they still do.<BR><BR>

Eventually, something had to break and Mutant eventually slowed down to a snails 
pace, having done it's deed.  Now Mutant releases the occasional limited release 
product of interest and still sticks around just to release the material of Focus 
23.  However, Mutant is always up for taking tapes off your hands and releasing 
them with a product code for the hell of it.  And yeah, you keep the copyright 
-- we could care less.  Mutant is non-profit group.  Money's never been an issue.  
Everything was done more for fun than anything else.<BR><BR>

Now run by a few people who have nothing better to do with their lives, Mutant 
rolls on and finally has a home, possibly even a final resting place, here on 
the internet.  Hope you enjoy it.  We do.<BR><BR>
