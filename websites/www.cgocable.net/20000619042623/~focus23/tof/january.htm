    <td><b><font face="Verdana"><font size=-1>Hey folks, my first news item of 
      the year and I feel the need to rant about what everyone else is ranting 
      about...Ion Storm.&nbsp;</font></font></b> 
      <p><b><font face="Verdana"><font size=-1>In some degree or another it seems 
        fairly clear to me, Todd Porter is an asshole who should have never been 
        given the position he currently has. This gentleman seems to be on some 
        form of power-trip, believing that he is some form of GoD (pardon the 
        pun) and can do no wrong. In case you didn't notice from the hemmoraging 
        of your employees Mr. Porter, you can't treat people like shit for very 
        long before they give up on you.&nbsp;</font></font></b> 
      <p><b><font face="Verdana"><font size=-1>John Romero needs to get his ass 
        in gear (as much as he may dislike it) and start interacting in the daily 
        events at Ion Storm. Unfortunately there are times where you HAVE to take 
        sides and piss of some people. Clearly the point of contention at Ion 
        is Porter. So get together with everyone else and do SOMETHING about it. 
        Fire him, demote him, smack him around a little, but stop acting like 
        a whimpering puppy and get your company in shape. If Daikatana actually 
        ever ships with Ion still in the shape it is I know it's going to be another 
        Battlecruiser 2000 A.D.</font></font></b> 
      <p><b><font face="Verdana"><font size=-1>I was going to go on, but what's 
        the point? Although I did decide to try out my new drawing tablet with 
        a real project. <a href="daikatana.JPG">Here's the result</a></font></font></b> 
      <p><b><font face="Verdana"><font size=-1>Oh, I aplogize for the dead "Jive 
        On!" button. My system's been open for the last few weeks with various 
        hard drives lying around the room and I couldn't get to it until recently. 
        Just doesn't seem to want to work for some reason. I'll keep fiddling 
        with it.</font></font></b> 
      <p><b><font face="Verdana"><font size=-1>And as for OGRE, I'm up for a good 
        trashing (mine, not their's &lt;G>). Let's find a date and see if anyone
