<font size=+1>Robert Wisdom (Danny Watlington)</font><br>
<b>Detective</b><br>

<hr width=350 align=center size=1 noshade>

With a history of working behind the scenes in top artistic and<br>
directorial positions within the avant-garde and cultural worlds of music<br>
and the performing arts, Robert Wisdom is poised to break out larger<br>
than life in front of the camera.<br><br>

Within the past year, Wisdom has appeared in John Woo's "Face/Off,"<br>
co-starring John Travolta and Nicolas Cage; "Volcano," with Tommy Lee<br>
Jones; and cable's "If These Walls Could Talk," directed by Cher.  Most<br>
recently, he has completed production on Disney's feature film, "Mighty Joe<br>
Young," alongside Bill Paxton, David Paymer and Charlize Theron.<br><br>

Robert Wisdom was born in Jamaica and raised in Washington, D.C. In 1972,<br>
while attending Columbia University, Wisdom began his career as the Jazz<br>
and Program Director at WKCR-FM in New York. In 1979, he became Associate<br>
Producer at National Public Radio of "All Things Considered."<br><br>

In 1983, Wisdom was named Artistic Director of the ten-day New Music<br>
America Festival in Washington, D.C. He then went on to direct the 1984<br>
Media and Democracy Conference in Kentucky. Later that year, Wisdom<br>
was appointed Music and Performance Curator of The Kitchen in Soho, the<br>
country's most influential center for the avant-garde, in New York City.<br>
Here, Wisdom incorporated his passionate vision of "intercultural <br>
communication" -- presenting the political and emotional heart and soul of<br>
indigenous cultures through his music programming.<br><br>

In 1987, the European community beckoned and Wisdom was appointed to<br>
head the performing arts program at the Institute of Contemporary Art in<br>
London (ICA).  During this time, Wisdom claims he had an epiphany that<br>
directed him to seriously pursue acting.  <i>"I had just come from<br>
viewing a theater piece in Italy and was riding in a cab with other<br>
artistic directors.  We were all criticizing what we had just seen and<br>
it occurred to me that it wasn't fair for me to be so harsh if I hadn't<br>
stood in the actor's shoes."</i><br><br>

In 1990, Wisdom began working full time on the stage in London.<br>
Working in Tom Stoppard's "Hapgood" and the Wooster Group's "Brace Up"<br>
were among his highlights.  In 1993, Wisdom moved to Los Angeles and<br>
secured his first feature film role. Since then, he has appeared in numerous<br>
film and television projects, as well as in theater productions throughout<br>
the U.S. and Europe.  Simultaneously, he became the Associate Artistic<br>
Director of the Los Angeles Festival.<br><br>

Wisdom knew that he wanted to pursue a creative life ever since graduating<br>
from college. Finally, he feels that he has <i>"lived a life which enables<br>
me to bring other insights into my acting.  Through my work with music,<br>
my work as an actor is enriched and distinctive."</i><br><br>

When he's not working, Wisdom spends time traveling, cycling, hiking,<br>
dancing, doing Ashtanga yoga; playing "capoeria," a Brazilian martial<br>
art; and playing drums and other instruments.  He is also working on a solo<br>
performance piece that has been commissioned by the Institute of Contemporary<br>
Arts.<br><br>

Lastly, Wisdom is also a big fan of the UK Cracker series.  He apparently<br>
was an avid viewer of the series while he stayed in England and apparently<br>
was determined to get this role.  As the role of his character is similar to<br>
that of the UK character, Jimmy, let's hope his character doesn't follow the<br>
same fate (the death of Jimmy by suicide).<br><br>
