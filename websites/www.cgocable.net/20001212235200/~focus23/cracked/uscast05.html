As a Golden Globe nominee and Boston Society of Film Critics Award-<br>
winner for Best Supporting Actor in director Stanley Kubrick's "Full Metal<br>
Jacket," R. Lee Ermey is one of the most successful and talented actors<br>
working in film and television today.<br><br>

His numerous roles in feature films include the upcoming "Going West,"<br>
starring opposite Dennis Quaid and Danny Glover. He was previously<br>
seen in "Seven," "Toy Story," "The Frighteners," "Dead Man Walking,"<br>
"Murder in the First," "Leaving Las Vegas," "On Deadly Ground," "Sommersby,"<br>
"Mississippi Burning," and his critically acclaimed starring role in<br>
"Prefontaine," written and directed by Steve James, the director of "Hoop<br>
Dreams."<br><br>

Ermey spent eleven years in the Marine Corps, which included one-<br>
and-a-half tours in Vietnam.  He rose to the rank of gunnery sergeant<br>
and was medically retired for injuries received.  Using G.I. Bill benefits,<br>
Ermey enrolled at the University of Manila in the Philippines, where he<br>
studied drama. Francis Ford Coppola was filming "Apocalypse Now" in the area<br>
and cast Ermey in a featured role.  He has since gone on to star in over 30<br>
feature films, nine television movies and the occasional episodic guest-<br>
starring role.<br><br>

His made-for-television movies include "Weapons of Mass Distraction,"<br>
"Soul of the Game," "The Rough Riders," "Space: Above and Beyond,"<br>
"Rise and Walk: The Dennis Byrd Story," "I'm Dangerous Tonight," "The Take"<br>
and "83 Hours 'Til Dawn."<br><br>

Ermey has also never felt the urge to watch the UK Cracker series.  He<br>
has said that he does not want to affect the way he interprets the character<br>
from seeing previous interpretations.<br><br>
