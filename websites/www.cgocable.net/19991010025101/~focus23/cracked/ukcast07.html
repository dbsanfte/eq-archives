Like Lorcan Cranitch, there aren't a lot of things Kieran O'Brien has<br>
been in to credit his name with.  We know that before his role on Cracker,<br>
he appeared in two films.  The first is "Bellman and True" (1982) and<br>
the second is "Monster Maker" (1989).  However, since Cracker,<br>
O'Brien has gone on to work in another TV series.  Specifically,<br>
a 1997 series called "Born To Run".<br><br>

As a result of this seemingly total lack of information on this man, if<br>
anyone knows of anything else he has done, e@mail us and let us know about<br>
it.  We'd love to tell everyone else about it as well.<br><br>
