<FONT SIZE=+2><P>The Shaggs sound is what it's all about.  It's why this web page is here.  It's why their albums get bought, sometimes at very high prices.  The only way to truely know what it is to be The Shaggs is to listen to their music.  Words can never describe their sound, because it is so original.  If you have a copy of the RealAudio plug-in, you can listen to a samples of their music by clicking on the sound icons below.  We have asked Rounder Records to allow us to make these samples available for download.  They have not yet replied, but if they ask us to remove them, we will do so immediately.  Again, you will need the RealAudio plug-in for web browsers that allows you to hear these files.  You can receive a free demo version of this program at the <A HREF="http://www.real.com">RealAudio</A> Homepage.</FONT>
