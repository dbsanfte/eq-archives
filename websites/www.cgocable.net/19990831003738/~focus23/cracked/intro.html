Cracker? What does that mean anyway? Some theorize that it has to do<br>
with a person who "cracks" a case or a puzzle.  Some feel it refers to<br>
Fitz' ecclectic, outspoken character.  In short, nobody really knows<br>
why the show is called Cracker.  One thing is for sure though -- if you<br>
aren't already watching it now, you should be!<br><br>

Cracker is actually two separate television series.  The first (the<br>
original), came from the UK in 1993 and starred Scottish commedian<br>
Robbie Coltrane in the role of Eddie Fitzgerald -- a drunken excuse for<br>
a husband, a gambling washout, and all around hated individual.<br>
Looked down on by his friends and family, as well as the police he<br>
works for, he has one saving grace -- he is a brilliant psychologist<br>
with an uncanny ability to see the evil in people, bring them to confess<br>
and walk away unscathed, in search of the next casino.  He is insulting,<br>
nosey, and lothesome, but he also understands the criminal mind, most<br>
probably because his mind isn't that far removed from the criminals<br>
he deals with in the series.<br><br>

When Cracker ended in 1996, it was decided that the crew would move<br>
to the United States and try to get the series running on the US Fox<br>
Network with a new cast.  That series ran for eleven episodes before<br>
being cancelled.  It starred ex-Murphy Brown painter, Robert Pastorelli,<br>
 as Gerry Fitzgerald, the American version of Fitz.<br><br>

In the same seemingly depressing boat with Fitz are his wife, son, and<br>
the detectives he works with.<br><br>

There is also some debate amongst fans as to whether the American series<br>
should have been started.  Many feel that the show was fine as it was and<br>
that Granada Television in England should have kept working with the<br>
original cast members.  Others felt that the show didn't translate<br>
well to American audiences or that it was been translated badly.  Others<br>
felt that the American production was not only better, but was one of the<br>
greatest shows to hit the air in years.<br><br>
