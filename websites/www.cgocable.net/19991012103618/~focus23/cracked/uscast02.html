<font size=+1>Angela Featherstone (Hannah Tyler)</font><br>
<b>Detective</b><br>

<hr width=350 align=center size=1 noshade>

Angela Featherstone, who was born in Hamilton, Ontario, and raised in<br>
Nova Scotia, Canada, plays the feisty Detective Hannah Tyler.<br>
Again, there is no connection between the fact that the author of<br>
this web page is also from Hamilton, Ontario.<br>
Honestly.<br><br>

In 1993, Featherstone moved to Los Angeles to pursue an acting<br>
career and within three months was offered a role in one of my favourite<br>
films, "Army of Darkness" (directed by Sam Raimi).<br><br>

Most recently, Featherstone appeared in the action film, "Con Air,"<br>
starring Nicolas Cage.  She has also completed production in Newline's<br>
"Wedding Singer"; "Ill Town," starring Michael Rappaport and Lili Taylor; and<br>
"Zero Effect," starring Bill Pullman and Ben Stiller.<br><br>

Her television credits include guest-starring roles in "The Wright<br>
Verdicts," "New York Undercover," "Northern Exposure"; and "Friends,"<br>
as "Chloe The Xerox Girl."  She has also appeared in the made-<br>
for-television movies, "Family of Cops" and "Family of Cops II."<br><br>

Featherstone currently resides in Los Angeles. In her spare time, she<br>
enjoys reading autobiographies and "old Hollywood stuff."<br><br>
