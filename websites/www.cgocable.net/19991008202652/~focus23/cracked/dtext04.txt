Coltrane Plays Down Cracker Success

NEW YORK (CP)

There's a giggle in his voice when Robbie Coltrane, TV's popular
Cracker, insists he's no sex symbol.  Although he was in the most
recent James Bond thriller, Goldeneye, the portly Scottish actor
says Cracker hasn't resulted in a rush of job offers.

"I'm difficult to cast, I know that.  But producers always think
I'm working on Cracker and don't ring up.  I'm busy five months
of the year on it but I'd like to do other things in-between."

The Arts and Entertainment Network runs a new three-hour TV movie
of Cracker, titled Brotherly Love, next Tuesday at 9 PM EST.

Coltrane doesn't want to be typecast as Cracker.

"He's not me.  He's a character created by a writer, Jimmy McGovern.
A great challenge to play.  But I am not as brilliant, nor am I
compulsive."
