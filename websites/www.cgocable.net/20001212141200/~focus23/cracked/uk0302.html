An angry young man, teased and bullied by his female co-workers, is befriended by his lonely male supervisor, who invites the young man to stay in his flat, where a series of misunderstandings sets them off on a murderous spree that keeps spiraling wider and wider as they go.  Fitz tries to convince the police that there are two killers, not one, and struggles to help Jane and Beck's sister deal with his death.  Judith turns to Danny for help with her increasing depression.<br><br>

This episode is significant in that it deals, for the second time in the short life of the series, with the death of a major character, specifically that of Jimmy Beck.<br><br>
