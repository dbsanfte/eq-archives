For once, I have a link.  Usually I don't, ever since ABC removed their Cracker<br>
web site, but the only other Cracker web site out there is at the A&E <a href="http://www.mysteries.com/messageboard/index.html">Message<br>
Boards</a>, where people can discuss the series.  Once you get there, select<br>
Television Shows and it's listed under there.<br><br>

If you have a link you'd like to send us.  Do so!<br>
That there writing below is our e@mail address.<br><br>
