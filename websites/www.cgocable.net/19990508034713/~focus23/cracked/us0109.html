Fitz assists the police in tracking down a serial killer who's killings have all the earmarkings of being revenge killings on the behalf of his severely injured wife.  Meanwhile, Judith admits a betrayal of marriage to Fitz.<br><br>

In the second half of this two-part episodic, Fitz and the police are startled to discover that the next target for the serial killer is someone they all have a relationship with, putting them under far more pressure, as things become increasingly dangerous.  However, there is some uplifting news, as Judith's admission of betrayal somehow brings both herself and Fitz together again.<br><br></font>
