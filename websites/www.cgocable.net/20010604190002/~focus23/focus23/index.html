Focus 23 (based in Canada) have been recording musick since the inception of the 
group on December 25th of 1993.  The main thrust of the musick is based largely 
on ideas steming from dreams and chaos.  Musick is one of the best mediums for 
expressing the communication of experimental thought.  Focus 23 is a project for 
which there is no concrete goal except the exploration of musickal dreams and 
ideas.  Hopefully, a learning experience is achieved for each of its 
participants.<BR><BR>

Focus 23 has set about a plan to release different types of media for various 
projects, including cassettes, videos, computer music files, literature, CDs, 
and more.  Some Focus 23 products are only put out in limited releases, the 
amount varying each time.  Submissions of sound/video/unknown will also be 
accepted from others to be warped and mutated towards the ends of future 
experiments, fully crediting each owner as per their submission.<BR><BR>

Generally speaking, Focus 23 material is released via a self-run label known 
as Mutant.  However, most of their material has been distributed by other 
organizations, such as Xcreteria/Third Force in Canada.<BR><BR>

<B>50/50</B> (1994 - Mutant/Third Force - Limited to 29 copies)
</CENTER>

This initial release made an attempt to bring about a general theme as to what 
Focus 23 was to later carry on doing.  The first side of this cassette compiled 
material created throughout the past few years previous to the creation of the 
project, with the intent of forming a general preface.  The second side of the 
cassette featured new material created within the first few months of Focus 23's 
inception.  Experiments in cut-up, collage, musick composed under the influence 
of hallucinogenics, ritual musick, and found sound editing formed the basis for 
this experiment.  Comparisons have been made to the music of The Hafler Trio, 
Nurse With Wound, and other similar projects.  The cassette came with a special 
photographic cover.  The print run on this project has run out and it is no 
longer available.  A double compact disc version of this release has been 
mastered by Focus 23 with six live tracks from early radio work, but this 
version has not been made public.<BR>

<B>A Snake In The Glade</B> (1997 - Mutant/Third Force)<BR>
</CENTER>

This second release marks the first time Focus 23 has been able to release 
something on compact disc.  Most of the project is also recorded digitally, 
as opposed to the previously analog material on 50/50.  Snake picks up where 
the former project left off.  More pieces influenced by hallucinogens, dreams, 
rituals, magick, chaos, cut-up, and other unforseen circumstances.  Snake 
opens with analog material recorded shortly after 50/50 was completed and then 
delves into digital recordings/experiments that have surfaced as a result of 
the three years following the previous release.  This release is not as long 
as 50/50, but Focus 23 feel it is of a higher caliber by far.  Comparisons have 
been made between this release and the hypnotically tribal rhythms of Brian 
Lustmord.  There are no discernable differences between the cassette version 
and the compact disc version of this release.<BR>

<B>Xcreteria Volume One</B> (1995 - Xcreteria) (90 minute cassette)
</CENTER>

This compilation from Xcreteria features many different artists, including a 
Focus 23 track ("<B>Black Spot</B>") originally featured as a preview to the 
<B>Snake In The Glade</B> cassette, which not yet been released at the time of 
this appearance.  This version of the track has a slightly different ending 
than the one featured on <B>Snake In The Glade</B>.<BR><BR>

<B>Live Appearance</B> (October 3rd, 1995)
</CENTER>

This appearance on Hamilton, Ontario's CFMU 93.3 FM show, Dead City Radio saw 
the performing of "<B>Live</B>", which was intended to be released on <B>Snake 
In The Glade</B>, but was later lost and had to be partially re-recorded.  This 
was not actually a "live" performance at all, but rather, a pre-recorded track 
made for the show.  Generally speaking, Focus 23 have never really done any 
"live" performances other than their work from radio shows previous to the 
inception of the group.  But then again, what's "live" anyway?<BR><BR>

</CENTER>

Both the "Sources" and "IP1" project have been scrapped, never to be unearthed 
again.

Plans for the next album, <B>I'll Think That Way Too</B>, are well underway and 
the recordings have begun.  No release dates as of yet but at a rough guess 
we're looking at year 2000.<BR><BR>

A series of MP3 tracks may also go up here as well in future, exclusively for 
a limited time, perhaps in conjunction with the new album or in line with 
another project.  More on that when the details are fleshed out.<BR><BR>

Due to some bandwidth constrictions, Mutant has had to remove their MP3 material 
until sometime in future and are looking for ways to provide source music by 
Focus 23 and their other artists.  More news on this as it comes in.<BR><BR>
