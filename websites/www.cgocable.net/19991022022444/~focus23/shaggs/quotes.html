<FONT SIZE=+2><P>Many memorable quotes have been spoken about The Shaggs.  They appear in magazines and on their albums mostly -- some good commentary and some bad.  Amongst this mix of opinions lie the opinions of some very important musicians, such as Frank Zappa, Jonathan Richman (of The Modern Lovers), and Bonnie Raitt.  Keep in mind that none of these quotes necessarily represent the opinions of the person that created this web site.  We maintain a neutral stance on the issue, but feel free to peruse what others have said in the past!</FONT>
