All Cracked Up Over Finale
September 3, 1996

It's criminal -- tonight's your last chance for a fresh hit of
Cracker.  But don't worry, the award-winning British mystery series'
sign-off is ever so satisfying.  Creepy, but satisfying.  In the
finale -- True Romance -- Fitz's (Robbie Coltrane) skills as a
criminal psychologist are put to the test when he starts getting
love letters from an obsessed ex-student.  At the same time dead
bodies are turning up.  Bad timing for Fitz.  He's just started
getting his marriage to Judith (Barbara Flynn) back on track, now
he has kinkiness galore to handle.

Who's electrocuting these young men and dumping them naked in the
bush? What's with the Dusty Springfield tune taped to their ankles?
Who's Fitz's wife sneaking out to see? All this to sort out in two
hours.  No wonder Fitz drinks so much.

It's a great crime to cap off the Cracker series.  And with Coltrane
in the lead role, there's always humor to balance out the murder and
mayhem.

And don't forget the show's trademark sexual tension -- between
Fitz and Judith; Fitz and Penhaligon; Fitz and the killer; and
Judith and Fitz's responsible brother (Clive Russell).

Cracker -- you got your crime, your sex and plenty of alcoholic
beverages.  That should hold ya until A&E airs the Cracker movie
Lucky White Ghost next year.
