When a fourteen-year-old boy is found hanging from a tree, it seems like a simple suicide...but is it? Facing increasing resistance from the police, Fitz finds himself working alone to unravel a dangerous web of lies, intrigue, forbidden passion, and murder.  As the police attempt to strong-arm an innocent schoolteacher into confessing, Fitz tries desperately to bring the real killer to justice.  Meanwhile, his marriage continues to collapse, as does his relationship with Detective Chief Inspector Billborough.<br><br>
