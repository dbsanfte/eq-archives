Thanks to the fine efforts of Noelle (and hopefully other contributors to the web<br>
site, we have a couple of behind the scenes shots from the US series.  Not only are<br>
they just behind the scenes shots, they're from the last of the five canned episodes<br>
in which Coltrane was brought on for a guest spot as the killer for the episode.<br>
Such a fan of the UK series was Noelle that she got her picture taken with Coltrane<br>
and Pastorelli, as well as getting a few extra snaps of the episode during the shoot.<br>
Noelle worked on the series as a double for Carolyn McCormick (who played<br>
Judith Fitzgerald).  Our immense thanks go out to her for providing these priceless<br>
photos! Noelle has been so nice to us in the past and she deserves a lot of kudos.<br><br>
