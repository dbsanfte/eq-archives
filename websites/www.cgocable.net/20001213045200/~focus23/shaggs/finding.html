<FONT SIZE=+2><P>Finding albums by The Shaggs can be difficult, and finding vinyl versions of their albums can be even trickier, not to mention expensive.  Old vinyl versions of their albums can fetch a pretty penny.  An original Third World pressing of <EM>Philosophy Of The World</EM> would be quite a find.  The going rumour is that original vinyl editions of <EM>Philosophy</EM> can fetch approximately two-hundred dollars American! This hasn't been confirmed, but some collectors have told us they would be more than willing to pay that amount for an original copy.

<P>On February 23rd of this year, RCA Victor will be re-issuing <EM>Philosophy Of The World</EM> on CD! This means their best album will be the easiest to pick up.  Buy it while you can because when it goes out of print, who knows when we'll see another pressing of this incredible gem.  You should be able to order this through any major record store when it comes out.</P>

<P>If you live near a big city, such as New York, Toronto, Montreal, San Fransisco, etc., you should be able to order a copy of the Shaggs CD through any major record outlet, such as HMV, Tower Records, Virgin Megastores, etc. -- they will easily be able to order in copies of the CD from Rounder, which should still be printing it.  If you want to get in touch with Rounder Records directly, you can either visit their <A HREF="http://www.rounder.com/rounder/">web site</A> or write them directly at the following postal address:</FONT>
