Orphx (based in Ontario) have never released anything via Mutant, but are close allies with bands like Focus 23 and so we're mentioning them here.  They have released two cassettes privately through their own label, which used to be called Xcreteria, and then changed it's name to Third Force.  Situated in Dundas, Ontario, they give industrial noise experimentation a new twist -- they give noise a refined sound.  It's not harsh beyond beautiful.  You can actually fall asleep to this stuff, it's fantastic.  Their first two ninety minute cassette releases, <B>01</B> and <B>02</B> mix live impromptu work as well as pre-recorded studio work.  They later fought hard to release their third album, <B>Fragmentation</B> on the semi-major label, Malignant Records and is easily their best work yet.  If you had to make a comparison between Orphx and other bands, we here think that Orphx are a real throw back to the early sound of bands like Throbbing Gristle, during their early live work.  Nobody's ever been able to completely recapture that old kind of early industrial sound -- Orphx have, however, so watch yourselves.  This stuff stings.<BR><BR>
