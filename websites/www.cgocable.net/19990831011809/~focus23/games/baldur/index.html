<FONT FACE="Verdana"><STRONG>BASICS OF THE GAME</STRONG></FONT><BR><BR>

There are a wealth of places to go for information on Baldur's Gate before deciding to buy it, such<BR> as the web site of it's distributor, <A HREF="http://www.interplay.com">Interplay</A> as well as the page of it's development team, <A HREF="http://www.blackisle.com">Black Isle</A>.<BR>  We'll try and point you in the direction of the most common and helpful references on the web for<BR> dealing with your Baldur's Gate issues.<BR>

Baldur's Gate is a RPG (Role Playing Game) in the tradition of Dungeons And Dragons and Diablo.<BR>  It uses the second edition rules from D&D, but is designed much like Diablo is.  Where Diablo is<BR> more arcade like in it's approach, Baldur's Gate takes the Diablo interface and makes it far more<BR> complex.  There are far more character statistics to deal with and party interaction.  Some prefer the<BR> more complex nature of Baldur's Gate over Diablo, and vise-versa.  It was easily one of the best<BR> games of 1998 and sold so heavily that only Red Alert matched it's initial sales statistics.<BR>
Baldur's Gate successfully runs the characters through an intense plot line in a world far larger than<BR> Diablo and is playable in both single or multiplayer configurations.  It is not as complex as Ultima<BR> Online, and can be almost as quick to learn as Diablo.  You can check out <A HREF="http://www.interplay.com/bgate/hall.html">screen shots</A> of the game<BR> at the web site of Interplay to get a better idea of what the game looks like.<BR><BR>

<FONT FACE="Verdana"><STRONG>NEWS</STRONG></FONT><BR><BR>

For all the latest news and information on this game, you can check out the web page of  the<BR> company that distributes Baldur's Gate, specifically <A HREF="www.interplay.com">Interplay</A>.  You can also access the fan-based<BR> sites <A HREF="http://www.bgchronicles.com/xode">Adventurer's Guild</A> and <A HREF="http://www.bgchronicles.com">BG Chronicles</A>, both of which have excellent news areas.<BR><BR>

<FONT FACE="Verdana"><STRONG>SOUND ADD-ON PACKS</STRONG></FONT><BR><BR>

<IMG SRC="skullon.gif" border=0><BR><A HREF="http://www.geocities.com/Area51/Portal/3717/d23b.zip">Dark Mage (d23b.zip - 2+ MB)</A><BR>
CGA is proud to bring you Guild [ToF] Trunk O' Funk's wonderful Dark Mage sound add-on for<BR> multiplayer characters.  Not only are [ToF] from the CGA area, but they're one of the first to provide<BR> an add-on sound pack for this wonderful game.  This add-on was whipped up over the course of an<BR> hour by [ToF] Guild member, Doctorius 23 using a microphone and some effects in Sound Forge<BR> 4.0.  It's a series of replacement sounds for a character consisting of a deep, slighly echoing voice.<BR>  Very ogre-like and lots of fun.  It's also far more suited to the game than other sound add-ons<BR> previously available such as add-ons like The Simpsons.  For a sample, click <A HREF="http://www.geocities.com/Area51/Portal/3717/d23f.wav">here</A>.<BR>

<IMG SRC="skullon.gif" border=0><BR>
<A HREF="http://www.bgchronicles.com/xode">The Adventurer's Guild</A> web site has a collection of <A HREF="http://www.bgchronicles.com/xode/wavs.html">sounds</A> for characters including sounds from The<BR> Simpsons, Austin Powers, Robin Hood, Bruce Campbell, Xena, Monty Python, Jim Carrey, and<BR> even The Smurfs! On the down side though, some of these seem a little out of place in the game and<BR> there is an awful lot of hiss in these samples.<BR>

<IMG SRC="skullon.gif" border=0><BR>
Some of the best sounds heard so far are those that are done in the spirit of the game like the ones<BR> found at <A HREF="http://www.adventuregaming.com">Adventure Gaming</A> and this <A HREF="http://www.addesigninc.com/bgvoices.html">secluded sounds site</A> we found as well.<BR>

<IMG SRC="skullon.gif" border=0><BR>
Last but not least, you can always check out the <A HREF="http://www.bgchronicles.com/chronicles/links.shtml">BG Chronicles Links Area</A> for up to date listings of<BR> pages with sound packs on them.<BR><BR>

<FONT FACE="Verdana"><STRONG>PORTRAIT ADD-ON PACKS</STRONG></FONT><BR><BR>

For portaits, make sure you create a directory called "Portraits" within your Baldur's Gate directory,<BR> this is where the following Portrait add-ons should go in order to be accessible by your copy of<BR> Baldur's Gate.  They can then be used from your Character Appearance section by pressing<BR> "Custom" and choosing the portraits in question.<BR><BR>

<IMG SRC="skullon.gif" border=0><BR><A HREF="http://www.geocities.com/Area51/Portal/3717/d23l.jpg"><IMG SRC="http://www.geocities.com/Area51/Portal/3717/d23s.gif" border=0></A><BR>
<A HREF="http://www.geocities.com/Area51/Portal/3717/d23a.zip">Dark Mage (d23a.zip - 39+ KB)</A><BR>
CGA is proud to bring you Guild [ToF] Trunk O' Funk's wonderful Dark Mage portrait to go<BR> hand-in-hand with the sound add-on from above.<BR>

<IMG SRC="skullon.gif" border=0><BR>
<A HREF="http://www.bgchronicles.com/xode">The Adventurer's Guild</A> web site has a collection of <A HREF="http://www.bgchronicles.com/xode/portraits.html">portraits</A>, portraits from <A HREF="http://www.bgchronicles.com/xode/custom.html">other players</A>, as<BR> well as the <A HREF="http://www.bgchronicles.com/xode/CustomPortraits.zip">Bioware Custom Portraits</A> used by the programming team during testing.  A quick warning<BR> about the Bioware portraits, as some of them include nude photos.  As mentioned before, you can<BR> find some excellent portraits at <A HREF="http://www.adventuregaming.com">Adventure Gaming</A> as well.<BR><BR>

<FONT FACE="Verdana"><STRONG>LINKS</STRONG></FONT><BR><BR>

Since we don't have the intention of making this a page a big centre for Baldur's Gate, it would be<BR> foolish for us to assume that any list of links that we would concoct would be at all accurate. For this<BR> reason, we refer you to the excellent resources of <A HREF="http://www.bgchronicles.com">BG Chronicles</A>, which is quickly becoming the<BR> web's best fan-based resource for information of all sorts surrounding this wonderful game.  Check<BR> out their fantastic list of <A HREF="http://www.bgchronicles.com/chronicles/links.shtml">links</A>, listing official/unofficial sites, portrait/sound sites, and other<BR> miscellaneous stuff.<BR><BR>

<FONT FACE="Verdana"><STRONG>GUILDS</STRONG></FONT><BR><BR>

Playing in a guild can be a wonderful way of getting through this game.  Not only do you stand a<BR> better chance of playing with people who do not hack their characters (spruce them up and make<BR> them better than they would be if you played the game normally), but you could play with a bunch of<BR> people from all over the world and maybe forge a few freindships.<BR>
At the moment, you can find a fairly decent list of BG Guilds by travelling to the <A HREF="http://www.bgchronicles.com/xode/guilds.html">guilds</A> section of<BR> <A HREF="http://www.bgchronicles.com/xode">The Adventurer's Guild</A> web site.<BR><BR>

<FONT FACE="Verdana"><STRONG>SUPPORT AND TROUBLESHOOTING</STRONG></FONT><BR><BR>

Although Baldur's Gate does have a few bugs, it's pretty much as bug free as you're going to get.<BR>  Any additional patches to the game can be found through the game's Main Menu, which will link you<BR> directly to Interplay's patch site on the web.  There are also some very helpful <A HREF="http://www.interplay.com/bgate/tavern.html">discussion boards</A> at<BR> Interplay for getting technical help on the game, hints, or just to chat with other players.  There is also<BR> a <A HREF="http://www.interplay.com/bgate/bgfaq.html">FAQ</A> (Frequently Asked Questions) for Baldur's Gate that might be helpful.  That pretty much<BR> covers the basics.  If you're finding that you're having trouble connecting players after the game<BR> autosaves before travelling off the map, this may be a bug.  I've certainly had this happen to me<BR> numerous times during gameplay.  One thing that can help is editing your BALDUR.INI file in the<BR> game directory and enter the line "Client Timeout=(whatever number you want)" at the end of your<BR> [Multiplayer] section.  If you're interested in cutomizing your characters with different portaits and<BR> sounds, you can get information on how to do it by clicking <A HREF="http://www.bgchronicles.com/chronicles/customize.shtml">here</A>.<BR><BR>
