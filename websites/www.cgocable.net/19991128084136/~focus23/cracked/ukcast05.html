<hr width=350 align=center size=1 noshade>

Like Christopher Eccleston, Tomlinson was introduced to the world through<br>
Cracker.  Most people just can't forget him as the lovable DCI Wise who,<br>
as angry as he usually was, always believed in Fitz far more than that of<br>
DCI Bilborough.<br><br>

Tomlinson started out in films like "Riff-Raff" and "Raining Stones"<br>
before his work on Cracker, as a replacement to Christopher Eccleston.<br>
After Cracker, Tomlinson worked with Amanda Plummer in "Butterfly Kiss", one<br>
of the best (albeit depressing) films to come out of the UK.  He made a brief<br>
return to Cracker for the last episode, "White Ghost", before going back<br>
to film, with his efforts in "Bob's Weekend".<br><br>

Once again though, McGovern called, and Ricky Tomlinson went to work on<br>
"Hillsbourough" with Jimmy McGovern authoring the project, and also<br>
appearing alongside Christopher Eccleston, also of Cracker fame.<br><br>

Since then, he has appeared in many films and continues to make a  name for<br>
himself in British cinema.  Some of his recent film credits include<br>
"Mojo", "Das Leben Ist Eine Baustelle", "Preaching To The Perverted",<br>
and "The Fix".<br><br>
