"White Ghost" was to be the final episode for the UK version of the Cracker series.  Run as a special two-hour movie, it was not counted as part of a season and that made it difficult to get the cast members back for it.  Ricky Tomlinson was luckily available, but a new female cast member was brought in to fill the void left by the absence of Geraldine Sommerville as DS Jane Penhaligon.<br><br>

In the special one-shot episode, Fitz travels to Hong Kong, doing the lecture circuit abroad for once.  Of course, like most good TV slueths, wherever they go, danger follows.  This time it's the murder of a businessman and the dissapearance of a Chinese woman.  She's in danger, but can Fitz unravel the many foreign mysteries surrounding the case before her time is up?<br><br>

It was said that more special episodes would follow, but it has been years since and new episodes and/or specials seem a highly unlikely event.<br><br>
