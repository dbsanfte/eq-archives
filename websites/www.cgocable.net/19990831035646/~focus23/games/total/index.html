<FONT FACE="Verdana"><STRONG>BASICS OF THE GAME</STRONG></FONT><BR><BR>

There are a wealth of places to go for information on Starcraft before deciding to buy it, such<BR> as the web site of it's distributor, <A HREF="http://www.blizzard.com">Blizzard</A>.  We'll try and point you in the direction of the most<BR> common and helpful references on the web for dealing with your Starcraft issues.<BR>

Starcraft is the sequel to the equally successful Warcraft 2, which helped set the original standards<BR> for multiplayer real-time strategy games in the mid 90s.  Where Warcraft is set in the past against a<BR> fantasy backdrop, Starcraft is set in the far future where humans fight more than just Orcs.  This time<BR> they're up against two new races -- the Zerg and the Protoss.  You can play it single player and<BR> follow the basic storyline that surrounds Starcraft, or go online with Blizzard's own <A HREF="http://www.battle.net">Battlenet</A> to play<BR> with and against others from around the globe in intense multiplayer combat.  You can check out<BR> screen shots (<A HREF="http://www.blizzard.com/star/bigpix/sc19.htm">1</A>, <A HREF="http://www.blizzard.com/star/bigpix/sc20.htm">2</A>, and <A HREF="http://www.blizzard.com/star/bigpix/sc21.htm">3</A>) of the game at the web site of Blizzard to get a better idea of what the<BR> game looks like.  There is also a <A HREF="http://www.battle.net/faqs/starcraft/index.htm">FAQ</A> (Frequently Asked Questions) sheet available from Battlenet<BR> that gives a full run down on all of the features of this game.<BR><BR>

<FONT FACE="Verdana"><STRONG>NEWS</STRONG></FONT><BR><BR>

For all the latest news and information on this game, you can check the Blizzard <A HREF="http://www.blizzard.com">news</A> page or the<BR> impreccable resources of <A HREF="http://www.starcraft.org">www.starcraft.org</A>.<BR><BR>

<FONT FACE="Verdana"><STRONG>COGECO PLAYER LIST</STRONG></FONT><BR><BR>

There are currently no players listed for Starcraft.  If you are on the Cogeco network and would<BR> like to have your e-mail address listed for others to contact you and arrange a game time, <A HREF="mailto:d23@cgocable.net">e-mail</A> us<BR> and we will list your address as soon as possible.<BR><BR>

<FONT FACE="Verdana"><STRONG>STRATEGIES</STRONG></FONT><BR><BR>

One of the key things to being a good Starcraft player is knowing popular Starcraft strategies.  It is,<BR> after all, a real-time strategic war simulation.  You can always ask players for advice at the <A HREF="http://www.battle.net/starcraft/index.htm">Battlenet<BR> Discussion Center For Starcraft</A>.  Blizzard also maintains an excellent list of up to date <A HREF="http://www.blizzardgames.com/blizzard-links/fansites/scaccess.shtml">fan-based web<BR> sites</A> that handle popular strategies for Starcraft.<BR><BR>

<FONT FACE="Verdana"><STRONG>MAPS (aka. SCMs or "SCUMs")</STRONG></FONT><BR><BR>

If you're looking to really get the garbage beaten out of you, there are tons of maps out there you<BR> can add-on to Starcraft to get yourself extra missions or multiplayer battlefields to play with.  Blizzard<BR> has an area of listing <A HREF="http://www.blizzardgames.com/blizzard-links/fansites/sctechnical.shtml">SCM Creation and Technical Defence</A> Sites.  You can also check out<BR> www.starcraft.org, whose <A HREF="http://www.starcraft.org/scums">SCUMS</A> section is one of the best on the planet for add-on levels.<BR><BR>

<FONT FACE="Verdana"><STRONG>LINKS</STRONG></FONT><BR><BR>

There are hundreds of Starcraft fan sites.  Since we don't have the intention of making this a page a<BR> big centre for Starcraft, it would be foolish for us to assume that any list of links that we would<BR> concoct would be at all accurate. For this reason, we refer you to the excellent resources of<BR> <A HREF="http://www.starcraft.org">www.starcraft.org</A>.  They may be a fan-based site, but they are packed with extremely helpful<BR> resources, technical help, etc.  The <A HREF="http://www.blizzard.com/star/compendium/index.htm">Starcraft Compendium</A> is also quite good.  If all else fails, Blizzard<BR> maintains an up to date list of <A HREF="http://www.blizzard-links/fansites/starcraft.shtml">fan-based sites</A>.  There's also Blizzard's homepages for <A HREF="http://www.blizzard.com/war2">Warcraft 2</A> and<BR> the Expansion Pack add-on <A HREF="http://www.blizzard.com/broodwar">Brood Wars for Starcraft</A>.<BR><BR>

<FONT FACE="Verdana"><STRONG>SUPPORT AND TROUBLESHOOTING</STRONG></FONT><BR><BR>

If you're having trouble with Starcraft, there are a couple of helpful places to look first.  Try the<BR> <A HREF="http://www.blizzard.com/support/starcraft/index.shtml">Starcraft Technical Help</A> page at Blizzard or talk to other players through the <A HREF="http://www.battle.net/starcraft/index.htm">Battlenet Discussion<BR> Center For Starcraft</A>.  <BR><BR>
