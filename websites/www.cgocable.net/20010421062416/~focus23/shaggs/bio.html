<FONT SIZE=+2><P>Probably the easiest way to tell the story of The Shaggs is to let the good people at Rounder Records have their say.  In the liner notes to the Shaggs CD, John DeAngelis gives what is probably the most accurate and trustworthy account of The Shaggs story.  It's not a long story, but on the other hand, not a lot of other people know much about the Shaggs, so his liner notes are practically of biblical proportions in this case.  What follows below is a section of the liner notes that describe their brief history.  We have sent a short e-mail to Rounder asking for permission to reprint this section.  We don't perceive that this will become a big problem, but if it is we will be taking it down immediately.

<P>Following John DeAngelis' article is a brief account of the Shaggs story from one of the Shaggs themselves, also taken from the liner notes of the Shaggs CD.  Again, we are asking Rounder Records for permission to reprint this material and will take it down if asked to.</FONT>

<ALIGN=middle><CENTER><FONT SIZE=+1>Excerpts From The Liner Notes To The CD Release, "<EM>The Shaggs</EM>"<BR>
By: John DeAngelis</FONT><BR><BR>

<P>When Austin Wiggin, Jr. and his teenage daughters Dorothy, Betty, and Helen drove from their home in Fremont, New Hampshire to a recording studio in Revere, Mass. one day in the late 1960s, none of the participants could have guessed at the events that were to transpire as a result of the music recorded that day.  The girls hadn't been playing very long and were uncertain of their abilities.  Upon hearing the three sisters play, the recording engineer suggested to Austin that perhaps the girls weren't quite ready to record.  But Austin Wiggin, Jr., a true visionary, was intent on capturing the moment.  "I want to get them while they're hot," he reportedly said.

<P>The music recorded that day was indeed hot, and Austin paid a local entrepeneur to release <EM>Philosophy Of The World</EM> by the Shaggs on the Third World label.  The "entrepeneur," however, dissapeared with Austin's money and most of the albums that had been manufactured.  If ever a record was doomed to obscurity, this one seemed to be it.

<P>What copies of <EM>Philosophy Of The World</EM> did survive miraculously found themselves into the right hands.  WBCN-FM in Boston played selections from <EM>Philosophy</EM> several times; local musicians like Andy Paley discovered the record and began championing the Shaggs; someone at WBCN played <EM>Philosophy</EM> for Frank Zappa, who was quite taken with it; and finally tenor saxophonist and composed Keith Spring, then playing with the Whole Wheat Horns, an adjunct to the legendary adventurous NRBQ, played a tape of the Shaggs for the rest of NRBQ.  Shortly thereafter arrangements were made to reissue <EM>Philosophy Of The World</EM> on NRBQ's own Red Rooster label, distributed by Rounder Records.

<P>Perhaps no album, either prior to or since, has generated as intense a reaction as <EM>Philosophy Of The World</EM> did upon its reissue.  Most critics loved it, although their reasons varied greatly.  Some thought the Shaggs were a joke, or some elaborate hoax.  Debra Rae Cohen in <EM>Rolling Stone</EM> (which cited the Shaggs as the Comeback of the Year band in their 1980 Rock and Roll Awards) said, "I'd call <EM>Philosophy Of The World</EM> a work of primitive American genius but I'm too busy rolling on the floor."  Others took the Shaggs more seriously.  Bruce D. Rhodewalt in <EM>L.A. Weekly</EM> said, "If we can judge music on the basis of its honesty, originality and impact, then the Shaggs' <EM>Philosophy Of The World</EM> is the greatest record ever recorded in the history of the universe." And OP magazine said, "The Shaggs integrity and purity of vision shine through like a 50,000-watt lighthouse on a stormy night.  Listen to this record.  It WILL change your life."

<P>It's easy to see how someone could have been confounded by this wonderful music.  Here were three teens playing instruments we've heard countless times, but this time with none of the familiar signposts--none of the standard rhythms or chord progressions we've come to recognize and, yes, even expect.  On the other hand, listening to this music without perceptions or expectations reveals a refreshingly playful, yet decidedly structured sound with its own complex inner logic.  "I have yet to play a Shaggs cut for a professional musician who didn't roll his eyes and whisper, 'Where can I get this record?'," said Dan Forte in <EM>The Record</EM>, and no wonder.

<P>Recently, Terry Adams of NRBQ was speaking to Dot Wiggin on the phone when she mentioned that she had come across some "big tapes" while going through a closet in her home.  It was soon discovered that the "big tapes" included the original multitrack recordings of <EM>Philosophy Of The World</EM>.  Now newly mixed and mastered, with errors in pitch and speed finally corrected, and aided by the full-range, compression-free compact disc medium, this definitive version of <EM>Philosophy</EM> reveals a cleaner, yet wonderfully bracing quality that will suprise even those already familiar with its contents.  Each instrument has a spatial and sonic heft to it, and there are other surprises as well.  A bass guitar, omitted from the original mix of "That Little Sports Car," has been restored, adding a whole new dimension to that song.  Also heard for the first time is a pre-take run-through of "Who Are Parents."

<P>For me, <EM>Shaggs Own Thing</EM> reveals these remarkable youngsters, this time aided by youngest sister Rachel on bass (with guest appearances by brother Bob and Austin Wiggin, Jr.), relentlessly pursuing their refreshingly unaffected artistic vision with sincerity and creativity.  Especially delightful is the mature, almost sensuous remake of "My Pal Foot Foot"; Dorothy Wiggin's exquisite adolescent reverie, "My Cutie"; and Betty Wiggin's only known composition, "Painful Memories," which Dorothy embellishes with some inspired whammy bar chording.

<P>The Shaggs originated almost twenty years ago.  As mass media increasingly permeates our society with a sameness that is frightening, it seems unlikely that another band of this kind of quality and originality will ever come along again.  Or maybe in some distant country, as you read this, a proud father is giving his daughters (or sons) instruments and is exhorting them--in whatever language--to "do your own thing."  Whatever the case, the Shaggs did <EM>their</EM> own thing and we have an eloquent reminder in their awe-inspiring recordings.

<P>When we were growing up there was always music in the house.  My father would always have the radio on, or there would be some music shows on television.  He was attached to music very much.  He used to play a Jews Harp.  He could play that better than anybody I ever heard.  I always liked to be outside, and whenever I was I always had the radio with me.  We all had our favorites, and they were all different.  Mine was Herman's Hermits, and Betty's was Dino, Desi and Billy.  Helen didn't really have a favorite band, but her favorite singer was Ricky Nelson.

<P>It was my father that really got us interested and inspired us to get started.  He just asked us if we wanted to take music lessons.  I guess he had always wanted to take them as a kid and figured we were all so close as a family that it would be good to get a family group.  The three of us girls were interested, so me and my sister Betty took guitar and voice lessons and Helen took drum lessons--and then we just took it from there after probably a good year of just the lessons.  We tried putting a few things together and it king of all came together.

<P>My father felt that if we were taking both lessons and going to high school that we would have to drop one or the other, so we took home courses all through high school with American School in Chicago, through the mail.  All three of us got our diplomas that way.  We liked doing it that way because we did it on our own time, and that way we had time for our music as well.  The only thing we missed was the social part of it.

<P>Going into the recording studio was all my father's idea.  We didn't feel like we were ready yet; we didn't feel that we knew that much about music.  We were just getting started.  He gave us a lot of support.  He backed us up all the way.

<P>It's really hard to pinpoint when <EM>Philosophy</EM> first came out.  We don't remember the exact time.  I know it was a good ten years ago; it may be closer to fifteen by now.  The year should have been on the album, but I guess it isn't--we looked.  And the tapes were stolen, so we can't go by those.  We had all of our tapes upstairs in the house we were living in.  We had them all in a big army trunk of my uncle's, and the whole trunk was taken.

<P>The man who released <EM>Philosophy</EM> just dissapeared.  We were supposed to get I forget how many albums, but we were supposed to get a lot of albums for the price my father paid, and we only got one box.  He just didn't keep his word like he said he would.  He didn't so everything that he was supposed to have done.  My father even hot a lawyer after him to locate him and find out what the story was, and the lawyer couldn't find him.  And, in fact, there were two or three people looking for him, so I guess there must have been something there.

<P>When <EM>Philosophy</EM> first came out, it was played on a Boston station, WBCN-FM, a few times, but we never got any reviews or anything on it.  We just figured that was the end of the album.  Until NRBQ called us, we thought the album was non-existent.  We were really suprised.  We figured it was something that came and went, and we'd never hear about it again....And when <EM>Rolling Stone</EM> magazine named The Shaggs Comeback Band of the Year--I guess astounded would be the word.

<P>Now I'm married and I have two boys.  Having children is the best thing that ever happened to me.  Kids are life, I can't explain it any other way.  I hope someday they'll be interested in music, and if they are I'll encourage them and back them up all the way.  But if they want to go into entirely different fields, it's entirely up to them.  I haven't written since I've been married.  I've still got quite a few unfinished songs.  I'd like to continue with music lessons, but right now I'm pretty busy.

<P>I get a lot of letters.  Most of them are nice.  I got one awhile ago, it was insulting, or asking if we were trying to insult them.  I guess they didn't like the music, or didn't think it was music.  I just threw it away.  I figured everybody has their opinion.  If they don't like it, they don't have to buy it.

<P>- Dot Wiggin

Their music has touched our lives.  If it had not, we wouldn't have a Shaggs web page would we? If only they were still together as a group.  Perhaps the world would be a better place.  I'm serious.
