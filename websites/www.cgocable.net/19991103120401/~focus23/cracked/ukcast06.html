There aren't a lot of credits out there to Lorcan Cranitch's name.  At<br>
least, if there are, they're difficult to track down when you live in<br>
Canada and only have the internet as your resource guide.  However,<br>
we DO know that before his appearance as Jimmy Beck on Cracker, Cranitch<br>
appeared in a film called "Chernobyl: The Final Warning" (1991) and has<br>
since appeared in a film called "The Heart Surgeon" (1997).  Outside of,<br>
those three credits, it's hard to say what other projects he's been<br>
involved with.<br><br>

As a result of this seemingly total lack of information on this man, if<br>
anyone knows of anything else he has done, e@mail us and let us know about<br>
it.  We'd love to tell everyone else about it as well.<br><br>
