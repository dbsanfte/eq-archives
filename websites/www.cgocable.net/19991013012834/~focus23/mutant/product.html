If you've read through the Information primer on Mutant, you'll probably understand that there isn't as much stuff produced through Mutant these days.  The product catalogue is also in such a state of disarray that it would be way too hard to get it in order.  At one point, we did actually find a working copy of the catalogue.  The only problem is that it's inside an encrypted ZIP file that none of us can remember the password to.  Maybe it's for the best -- let sleeping dadaist lie....or something like that.  We will post the most recent additions to the catalog however, that is, items from the past couple years, which only includes Focus 23 and some recent additions.<BR><BR>

<FONT SIZE=+3>Downloadable Sounds/Visuals</FONT><BR><BR>

<FONT SIZE=+1>Due to a recent discussion with the internet service provider that allows us to make this web page available to you, we are being forced to remove our ftp service that allows downloadable MP3 files.  This has nothing to do with the legaities of the MP3 file format.  After all, we made the files and own the copyright on them.  However, running an external ftp server for the handling of these files supposedly breaks a user agreement with the ISP and is therefore illegal (or something like that, we're not sure -- listen, it's just a big mess, you don't really want to know how stupid this whole situation is).  If we can find a way of possibly offering these files through some other means (say a more compressed, streaming Real Audio format) then we may go that route, but for the present, we're not sure what to do.  In the meantime, none of the sound/film icons below link to their respective files any longer.  Again, we appologize for this intrusion to our service and your enjoyment of our product and hope it will somehow be rectified in the near future.</FONT><BR><BR>

mixed over some other slowed down found sounds.  The warehouse was later sealed up tight when it was<BR>
found out months later that companies had been illegally dumping huge amounts of toxic chemicals there.<BR>
