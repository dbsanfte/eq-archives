-Found a page for <a href="http://www.absolutely-uk.com/thejackdochertyshow/j-main.htm">The Jack Docherty Show</a>, which has an audio clip of Robbie Coltrane being interviewed about his role on the Cracker series.  You can download the full WAV file or listen to it in Real Audio format by going to the downloads area.<br><br>

-Noelle has a great story to go with her photos in the gallery.  I'll let her speak for herself from the e-mail she sent me:  "Funny story...I had told Pastorelli that I was a big Coltrane fan...when I was first introduced to Coltrane and he was signing my "To Be A Somebody" video box, Pastorelli says (completely in jest), 'just remember who you're favorite is, Noelle...I mean really...who's picture is on the back of our chairs?'"<br><br>

-Noelle also speaks about the last episode of the series, "Faustian Fitz".  This episode was never aired, but guest starred Robbie Coltrane.  In her e-mail to me, Noelle writes: "Robbie was the guest star of the last episode 'Faustian Fitz'. I guess we called him the 'guest villian'. He played a movie producer that killed a young girl (of course you don't know that until the end)".  Noelle also says that Coltrane was a wonderful and kind person who ate with the crew everyday<br><br>

-Noelle (ever faithful Cracker fan, cast double for Carolyn McCormick and bringer of rare photo gifts) says she bumped into Pastorelli recently.  Apparently he has seen the site and loves it.  I blush.<br><br>

-Faithful Cracker viewer Lou Mandarini writes to us to let us know the following two great pieces of news.  The British online giftshop, <a href="http:www.giftstore.co.uk">Giftstore UK</a> is going to be selling bookbound copies of the original sceenplays of all of the Cracker episodes after the first of the January 1999.  He's also provided some information as to where European viewers can buy episodes of Cracker in the PAL video format (meaning not viewable by US and Canadian viewers but rather by people in Europe).  They can be ordered online at <a href="http:www.giftstore.co.uk">Giftstore UK</a> as well.<br><br>

-A&E has a web page up for people to discuss Cracker.  If you go to the A&E <a href="http://www.mysteries.com/messageboard/index.html">Message Boards</a> and look under Television Shows, you'll see an entry for Cracker.  There haven't been a great deal of posts to it, but perhaps now that I've mentioned it here, things will pick up.<br><br>

-One of the more interesting posts from a nameless fan links the basis for the character of Fitz to a Professor David Canter of the University of Liverpool who solved the "Railway Rapist" case that ended with the arrest of John Duffy for rapes and homicides in London and Surrey England.  Apparently though, David Canter's personality is nothing like that of Fitz.  Thank God for that.<br><br>

<font size=+2>August of 1998</font><br><br>

- A&E has released a second boxed set consisting of the last two episodes from the second season, as well as the first episode of the third season.  This leaves three stories unreleased (I smell a third and final boxed set).  The price is listed as $59.99 american, which is the same as the first boxed set.  It should be available for ordering through A&E, as well as your local record/video chain.<br><br>

- Noelle has written me back with some updated information on the departure of R. Lee Ermey from the series.  Apparently he leaves and is replaced by thirty year-old Lt. Monroe Macy (played by Josh Lucas).<br><br>

<font size=+2>July of 1998</font><br><br>

- I was contacted by James Sadwith (US Executive Producer of the series) who told me briefly about five episodes that were filmed, canned, and never shown on the air.  I guess ABC must have really wanted to cancel Cracker as quickly as possible.  Since then, a crew member of the show has contacted me and given us all an extensive look behind the scenes with some exclusive photos.  Her name is Noelle.  She was a stand-in for Carolyn McCormick's character in the US series.  She's going to give us a behind the scenes synopsis of those final episodes and is trying to get dubs of the canned episodes to me.  Some of the cooler points of these episodes included the killing of Angela Featherstone's character, the departure of R. Lee Ermey's character (and not by death, suprisingly), and an appearance by Robbie Coltrane in the final episode -- he was even the villain! Noelle's got all manner of interesting stories about the series I'm sure, so it'll be great to hear from her again in the near future.<br>
