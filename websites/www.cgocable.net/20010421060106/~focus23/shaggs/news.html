<P>Somebody just covered "Philosophy Of The World" and it's an absolutely fantastic cover as well! You can listen to the track in its entirety by clicking <A HREF="http://www.geocities.com/SunsetStrip/Club/9556/World.ram">here</A>, but you'll need a copy of Real Audio for your browser which is available from <A HREF="http://www.real.com">www.real.com</A>.  This cover was done by a gentleman by the name of Bruce Lash, who will be putting out a CD with this track on it, amongst others, by the name of "Sad Sack".  His web page, and information about him, can be found <A HREF="http://home.att.net/~bblash">here</A>.  You can also download the track in a higher quality MP3 format by clicking <A HREF="http://www.geocities.com/Area51/Portal/3717/philosophy_of_the_world.mp3">here</A>, but you will need a copy of WinAmp, available from <A HREF="http://www.winamp.com">www.winamp.com</A> in order to play it back.</P>

<P>Irwin Chusid has written me back with a copy of the press release for the re-issue of <I>Philosophy Of The World</I> and I've provided it <A HREF="release.txt">here</A> for all of you to read.  It's quite informative and clears up a lot of questions surrounding the CD.</P>

<P>Mike Walsh has written me.  He wrote a short <A HREF="http://www.netreach.net/~mcreep/tilt/shaggs.html">article</A> on the Shaggs that now resides on the web.  In it, there is one of the photos from the cover to "Shaggs Own Thing", which I still do now have a scanned copy of to put up in the discography section, still though, it's the closest I've gotten.</P>

<P>New news concerning the RCA Victor re-issue of <I>Philosophy Of The World</I>.  They've given me an e-mail address of the producer of the re-issue and have said that we can post it so that Shaggs fans can ask him questions pertaining to the project in general.  I know I'll have a couple of things to ask him about the re-issue.  Please do not e-mail him just to tell him that The Shaggs "rule".  I wouldn't want to feel bad about passing around his e-mail address and having his box fill up with spam.  Please use it with care and play nice, kids.</P>

<P>Great new news, and my main reason for setting up this news page in the first place.  RCA Victor is going to re-issue <I>Philosophy Of The World</I> on February 23rd of this year and they're calling on this site to help promote it's release! RCA Victor will be setting up a web site for this re-issue, which we will be linking to as soon as they've completed the site and have it up for us to check it out.  They're promising to keep us "in the loop" on this one and are free to answer any questions concerning the re-issue.  Speaking of which, if you have any questions you'd like to ask RCA Victor about this re-issue, just <A HREF="mailto:d23@cgocable.net">e-mail</A> me and I'll relay them to RCA Victor in a jiffy.</P>

<P>Their e-mail announcement reads as follows:</P>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>"RCA Victor is re-releasing 'Philosophy of the World' on February 23,1999 with original packaging - the photo of the Wiggin sisters! I would like to send you a scan of the cover art as well as a press release and know if we could link our website feature on this artist to your site and have a reciprocal link from you.  Thanks!"</FONT></P>

<P>We'll keep you posted on this fantastic new news, and big thanks to RCA Victor for having the courage as a major label to re-issue this incredible album!</P>

<P>Okay, where to start.  How about this.  I'm just going to list a couple of interesting things that happened over the past few months while the site first went up and we'll just call that new news that I just haven't gotten around to.  Call me lazy, but I'm also in University right now and the schoolwork has to be given precedence for the moment.</P>

COOL THINGS DISCOVERED OVER THE PAST YEAR:<BR><BR>

<P>Right about the time that the web site went up, I got an e-mail from a guy called Jeff Landrock.  He claims to be an uncredited (by choice) engineer on "Shaggs Own Thing" and has some info to share with us about his experiences during the recording of the album.  He's already given a length account of this in an old issue of a Cool And Strange Magazine but we're discussing the possibility of him faxing a copy of that article to me so I can reprint it here on the site.</P>

<P>In October, I recieved some mail from a Steve Pearson who transcribed all of the lyrics from "Philosophy Of The World".  Those are now available from the Discography page as a link from within the info on that album.  Thanks Steve! Amazing work! If anybody feels like transcribing the rest of their songs, feel free.  I'd love to get those as well.</P>

<P>A Shaggs fan out there has decided to call their cat Foot Foot! Way cool! I've had over ten cats in my life and I can't believe that I haven't thought of that idea sooner.  Denise has even set up a web page for her pal Foot Foot.  <A HREF="http://www.accucomm.net/~footfoot/denise/foot.html">Check it out</A>, it's way cool!</P>

<P>Well, I've gone and done it now, haven't I? I decided to open up a news area.  When I originally set up this Shaggs site in mid '98, I really just didn't think there would be that much 'cause to change the site.  On the contrary.  I have received so many e-mails from people over the past six months that it seems I must create a news area where I can put new information about The Shaggs as I, and yourselves, find out about it.</P>
