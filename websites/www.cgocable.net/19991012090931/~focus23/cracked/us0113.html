This final "canned" episode is very special indeed.   Noelle (a cast double for Carolyn McCormick on the series) wrote us by e-mail to speak about the episode.  She tells us that in this story, Robbie Coltrane makes a guest appearance! He plays a movie producer that kills a young girl, which is not revealed until the very end of the episode.<br><br>

This episode was never aired and was the last in a series of "canned" episodes that were filmed, ready for air, but never shown due to the premature cancellation of the series by ABC.<br><br></font>

Never aired in the U.S. and Canada on the ABC Network and was canned instead, never to be seen.<br>
