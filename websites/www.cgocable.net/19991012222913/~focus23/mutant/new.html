Mutant doesn't release a lot of new material these days.  It's pretty well slowed to a crawl, but it's not closing down or anything.  What would that solve? Anyway, what little there is coming out or most recently out is listed below.<BR><BR>

<FONT SIZE=+2>MUCA253</FONT><BR>
<FONT SIZE=+1><B>Jim Jones</B> - White Night (cassette - 78'+)</FONT><BR>
<FONT SIZE=-1>(A collection of some of the best public domain audio material out there on Jones, from<BR>
material cut-up by others to the entire "white night" recording itself, a great collection.)</FONT><BR><BR>

<FONT SIZE=+2>MUCA254</FONT><BR>
<FONT SIZE=+1><B>Soundtracks</B> - Crimes Of The Future (compact disc - 21'+)</FONT><BR>
<FONT SIZE=-1>(This is the soundtrack to David Cronenberg's "Crimes Of The Future", really early stuff<BR>
from Cronenberg with a bizarre and interesting soundtrack somewhere between early Kraftwerk and early<BR>
UK industrialists.  Never before released, we've tried to get the best copy we could of this incredibly rare<BR>
film and release the soundtrack to it.)</FONT><BR><BR>
