Allow me to welcome you to Cracked, the unofficial Cracker homepage. My name<br>
is d23 and I've been a Cracker fan for a couple of years now. For a long<br>
time I was beginning to think that no one would ever make a Cracker page<br>
out there, so eventually I just got fed up and made one myself. I mean really,<br>
no Cracker web page? This just can't be allowed to happen! It's simply one of<br>
the best shows ever made.<br><br>

Please remember that if you see anything in the Cracked web page that is either<br>
incorrect or misleading, or even if you'd just like to contribute to it in some<br>
way, shape, or form, let me know! Don't hesitate to make contact!<br>
I'm always looking for photos, screen shots, and things along that line.<br><br>

For those of you who are wondering about me, I am situated in Hamilton, Ontario,<br>
which is in Canada.  Ironically, this is also where one of the actresses from<br>
the US series is from (specifically, Angela Featherstone).  I assure you, there<br>
is no connection -- it's purely a conspiracy...um...coincidence.<br><br>

Anyway...I'd like to thank the few people out there who bothered to put up what<br>
slight pieces of information on the series I could find.  Some of these unspoken<br>
heroes include Donna R. Lemaster (who wrote a fantastic episode guide for the<br>
UK series), D. Goggans (who wrote another episode guide for the UK series, as<br>
well as some good primer for the descriptions of Fitz), Keith Topping (who<br>
also wrote an episode guide for the UK series).  I didn't use all of their<br>
information, but a lot of it came in helpful when I created the general outline<br>
for the page.  And there are some proof readers out there, thank God!<br>
I'd like to list a few of them who have made corrections (large or small)<br>
to the site: Huw Buchtmann, John Collins, Petri Mäkelä, Fiona M.Davidson,<br>
Louis Lou Mandarini, and Noelle (of the US crew -- a big thanks).<br><br>

I'd also like to thank ABC and Granada TV for not suing the hell out of me.  Let's<br>
 face it -- when you make a web page surrounding a television show (eg. X-Files<br>
or Star Trek: TNG) these days, you cross your fingers and pray you won't get<br>
sued.  In my defense, I would just like to say this:  I love Cracker,<br>
I'm giving it great promotion, and quite frankly, there isn't anywhere a Cracker<br>
fan can go anymore for information on the series.  To ABC and Granada, I say this:<br>
I am promoting a product you created.  Please please please please please<br>
PLEEASE DON'T SUE ME! I'd rather that shows like Cracker stayed on air as<br>
there are painfully so few of them about! That's part of the reason I'm doing this.<br>
I can only hope that you'll understand.<br><br>

To anybody who works on the series (whether it be US or UK), I would love<br>
to hear from you.  I won't say no to any interviews, if offered, and I'd<br>
love any contributions you could provide.  Heck, it's not unheard of.  The<br>
creators of Babylon 5 contributed regularly to unofficial sites of their show<br>
such as The Lurker's Guide to Babylon 5.  This relationship only gave a<br>
greater notice to their show.  Feel free to make that same decision<br>
with me.<br><br>

I am also available for web page authoring, if anyone needs a web page done.<br><br>

Here's how you can reach me, everybody, so go right ahead.<br>
Operators are standing by to councel your every murderous dilemma.<br><br>
