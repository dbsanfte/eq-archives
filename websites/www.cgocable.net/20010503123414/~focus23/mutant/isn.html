Industrial Strength Noise (now defunct) was the long time pet project of J.Morrow before he was in Parasites.  In this project, anything was fair game.  Everything from guitar based music, to piano pieces, tape cut-up, noise, dance music, etc. was considered.  Industrial Strength Noise was not a group that took itself very seriously and that was part of the point.  J.Morrow felt, and still does, that industrial and experimental music is far too serious and doesn't make fun of itself often enough.  This only leads to a pompous, egocentric lifestyle that is ultimately meaningless, so you might as well laugh at yourself.  Some of this stuff goes back pretty far into the early days of Mutant in the mid-eighties during it's startup period.  ISN cassettes were sent out as jokes mainly to friends and allies, but it can't be ignored that some of the material gave bith to the idea of forming something much stronger, such as the later groups J.Morrow became involved with.  The catalogue of ISN material is quite large and extensive, all of it with hand-printed covers long out of print.  Mutant has no plans to re-issue any of this material either, so don't bother asking.  A brief history of the releases of ISN is listed below.<BR><BR>
