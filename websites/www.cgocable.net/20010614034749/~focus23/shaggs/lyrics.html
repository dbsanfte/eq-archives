Oh, the rich people want what the poor people's got<BR>
And the poor people want what the rich people's got<BR>
And the skinny people want what the fat people's got<BR>
And the fat people want what the skinny people's got<BR><BR>

You can never please anybody in this world<BR><BR>

The short people want what the tall people's got<BR>
And the tall people want what the short people's got<BR>
The little kids want what the big kid's got<BR>
And the big kids want what the little kid's got<BR><BR>

You can never please anybody in this world<BR><BR>

Oh, the girls with short hair want long hair<BR>
And the girls with long hair want short hair<BR>
Oh, the boys with cars want motorcycles<BR>
And the boys with motorcycles want cars<BR><BR>

You can never please anybody in this world<BR><BR>

It doesn't matter what you do<BR>
It doesn't matter what you say<BR>
There will always be<BR>
One who wants things the opposite way<BR><BR>

It doesn't matter where you go<BR>
It doesn't matter who you see<BR>
There will always be<BR>
Someone who disagrees<BR><BR>

We do our best<BR>
We try to please<BR>
But we're like the rest<BR>
Whenever at ease<BR><BR>

Oh, the rich people want what the poor people's got<BR>
And the poor people want what the rich people's got<BR>
And the skinny people want what the fat people's got<BR>
And the fat people want what the skinny people's got<BR><BR>

You can never please anybody in this world<BR><BR>

<FONT SIZE=+1>That Little Sports Car</FONT><BR><BR>

There was a sports car on the road (on the road)<BR>
I thought I knew the fellow that drove <BR>
That little sports car was slippery as an oyster<BR>
Following it was like riding on a roller coaster (roller coaster)<BR><BR>

Around the corners and over the bumps<BR>
Every minute, faster and faster, my heart thumped (my heart thumped)<BR><BR>

Well, finally he stopped to get some gas<BR>
If I was to catch up I had to move fast (to move fast)<BR>
I stepped on the gas and just made the corner<BR>
Wow, I was almost a goner (goner)<BR><BR>

When I got there he was gone<BR>
I don't know where I went wrong (I went wrong)<BR>
The time went fast, it was late<BR>
I knew I had no time to waste (time to waste)<BR><BR>

I turned around and headed for home<BR>
I learned my lesson never to roam<BR>
I learned my lesson never to roam<BR>
Never to roam<BR>
Never to roam<BR>
Never to roam<BR>
Never to roam<BR><BR>

<FONT SIZE=+1>Who Are Parents?</FONT><BR><BR>

Some kids do as they please<BR>
They don't know what life really means<BR>
They don't listen to what the ones who really care have to say<BR>
They just go and do things their own way<BR><BR>

Who are parents?<BR>
Parents are the ones who really care<BR>
Who are parents?<BR>
Parents are the ones who are always there<BR><BR>

Some kids think their parents are cruel <BR>
Just because they want them to obey certain rules<BR>
They start to lean from the ones who really care<BR>
Turning, turning from the ones who will always be there<BR><BR>

Who are parents?<BR>
Parents are the ones who really care<BR>
Who are parents?<BR>
Parents are the ones who are always there<BR><BR>

Parents do understand, parents do care<BR>
We must remember<BR>
Parents are the ones who will always understand<BR>
Parents are the ones who really care<BR><BR>

Parents do understand, parents do care<BR>
We must remember<BR>
Parents are the ones who will always understand<BR>
Parents are the ones who really care<BR><BR>

Who are parents?<BR>
Parents are the ones who really care<BR>
Who are parents?<BR>
Parents are the ones who are always there<BR><BR>

<FONT SIZE=+1>My Pal Foot Foot</FONT><BR><BR>

My pal's name is Foot Foot (Foot Foot)<BR>
He always likes to roam<BR>
My pal's name is Foot Foot (Foot Foot)<BR>
I never find him home<BR><BR>

I go to his house<BR>
Knock at his door<BR>
People come out and say <BR>
Foot Foot don't live here no more<BR><BR>

My pal Foot Foot (Foot Foot)<BR>
Always likes to roam<BR>
My pal Foot Foot (Foot Foot)<BR>
Now he has no home<BR><BR>

Where will Foot Foot go<BR>
What will Foot Foot do<BR>
Oh, Foot Foot<BR>
I wish I could find you<BR><BR>

I've looked here, I've looked there<BR>
I've looked everywhere<BR>
Oh, Foot Foot<BR>
Why can't I find you?<BR><BR>

Foot Foot, where can you be?<BR>
Foot Foot, why won't you answer me?<BR>
Foot Foot, Oh Foot Foot<BR>
Wherever you are<BR>
I want you to come home with me<BR><BR>

I don't have time to roam<BR>
I have things to do <BR>
I have to go home<BR>
Oh, Foot Foot, where are you?<BR><BR>

If Foot Foot didn't like to roam so well<BR>
He would still have a place to dwell<BR>
Foot Foot, please answer me<BR>
I know where you are<BR>
You're behind that tree<BR><BR>

Foot Foot, please come to me<BR>
Foot Foot, now that you're here<BR>
Won't you come home<BR>
Foot Foot, promise me this<BR>
That you will never again roam<BR><BR>

<FONT SIZE=+1>My Companion</FONT><BR><BR>

My companion is with me<BR>
Wherever I go, it goes too<BR>
My companion is with me<BR>
No matter what I do<BR><BR>

When I ride my horse <BR>
I take my companion too, of course<BR>
When I go to the beach and run in the sand<BR>
I have my companion close at hand<BR><BR>

My companion is with me when I drive my car<BR>
Even when I go real far<BR>
No matter where I am or what I do<BR>
My companion is always there too<BR><BR>

When I walk my pets<BR>
No one dare *** (?)<BR>
I take my companion<BR>
It never has passed (?)<BR><BR>

My companion is with me wherever I go <BR>
Even when I go to a show<BR>
My companion is, of course<BR>
My radio<BR><BR>

<FONT SIZE=+1>I'm So Happy When You're Near </FONT><BR><BR>

I'm so happy when you're near<BR>
I'm so sad when you're away<BR>
I've been happy almost every day<BR>
Now that you're here to stay<BR><BR>

But when you have to leave<BR>
Then I'll start to grieve<BR><BR>

Every week you have to go<BR>
Every time it's a different road<BR>
I never know what to do<BR>
I'm so lonesome without you<BR><BR>

When you're far away<BR>
You are always in my dreams<BR>
And when you're home to stay<BR>
We make a perfect team<BR><BR>

It's so hard to have to wait for you <BR>
To ride into the gate<BR>
But when you get there<BR>
We have many news and feelings to share<BR><BR>

I know it has to be<BR>
I know it can't be changed<BR>
But sometimes I think we are<BR>
Completely insane<BR><BR>

If we could see each other more<BR>
It wouldn't be so bad<BR>
If we could only find the open door<BR>
We wouldn't be so sad<BR><BR>

So until we find the right door<BR>
You'll have to leave again<BR>
And once more both our lives will be<BR>
Very dim<BR><BR>

<FONT SIZE=+1>Things I Wonder</FONT><BR><BR>

There are many things I wonder<BR>
There are many things I don't<BR>
It seems as though the things I wonder most<BR>
Are the things I never find out<BR><BR>

I wonder about the stars above<BR>
I wonder about the birds that fly<BR>
I wonder about your love<BR>
But most of all I wonder why you make me cry<BR><BR>

I wonder, I wonder<BR>
I wonder why we have to say goodbye<BR>
There are some things I don't understand <BR>
There are some things I do<BR><BR>

But one thing I don't understand<BR>
Is why we have to be so blue<BR>
I understand why you feel the way you do<BR>
Because I feel the same way too<BR><BR>

I wonder why our minds drift astray<BR>
I wonder why life goes on this way<BR>
I wonder why we have to part<BR>
We both know it'll break our heart<BR><BR>

There are many things I wonder<BR>
There are many things I don't<BR>
I'll be glad when I find all these things out<BR>
But until I do things won't change with me and you<BR><BR>

With me and you things will stay the same<BR>
With me and you things won't change<BR>
With me and you things will be the same<BR><BR>

<FONT SIZE=+1>Sweet Thing </FONT><BR><BR>

You're such a sweet thing<BR>
(Sweet thing, sweet thing)<BR>
But you can be so mean<BR>
You're such a sweet thing<BR>
(Sweet thing, sweet thing)<BR>
You used to make me dream<BR><BR>

But then there's times when you are very different<BR>
I just don't understand<BR>
How a minute you can be so mean<BR>
The next minute so grand<BR><BR>

You used to make me happy<BR>
Now you make me sad<BR>
You've told me many lies<BR>
I've never told you one<BR><BR>

You think you'll fool me<BR>
(Fool me, fool me)<BR>
So go and have your fun<BR>
I'll play it cool and go along with you<BR><BR>

You ran around and think that I don't know<BR>
You must think you put on quite a show<BR>
But you're turn's coming<BR>
(Coming, coming)<BR><BR>

There'll be some girl who will hurt you <BR>
(Hurt you, hurt you)<BR>
The way you have hurt me<BR>
And then you'll be the one who's sad and blue<BR>
And then you'll see how you made me feel<BR><BR>

In the end you will find<BR>
I was only trying to be a friend<BR>
In the end you will see <BR>
That I'm not the fool<BR>
But it's you, yes, you're the fool<BR><BR>

Then maybe you'll consider others<BR>
And try to be true<BR>
If you did that in the first place<BR>
You wouldn't be so blue<BR><BR>

You were such a sweet thing<BR>
(Sweet thing, sweet thing)<BR>
But now you are very mean<BR>
You were such a sweet thing<BR>
(Sweet thing, sweet thing)<BR>
But now you'll never make me dream<BR><BR>

You'll never make me dream<BR><BR>

<FONT SIZE=+1>It's Halloween</FONT><BR><BR>

It's Halloween<BR>
It's Halloween<BR>
It's time for scares<BR>
It's time for screams<BR>
It's Halloween<BR>
It's Halloween<BR><BR>

The ghosts will spook<BR>
The spooks will scare<BR>
Why, even Dracula will be there<BR><BR>

It's time for games<BR>
It's time for fun<BR>
Not for just one<BR>
But for everyone<BR><BR>

The jack-o-lanterns are all lit up<BR>
All the dummies are made and stuffed<BR>
By just looking you will see<BR>
It's this time of year again<BR><BR>

It's Halloween<BR>
It's Halloween<BR><BR>

All the kids are happy and gay<BR>
There doesn't seem to be a cloud in their way<BR>
But when it's over and they've had all their fun<BR>
They'll wish that Halloween had just begun<BR><BR>

Oh, there are witches, goblins, ***, ***, Frankensteins and zombies <BR>
(?)
And there are tramps, Cinderallas, pirates, angels and gypsies<BR>
So let's have lots of fun and give many cheers<BR>
For Halloween comes but once a year<BR><BR>

It's time for games<BR>
It's time for fun<BR>
Not for just one<BR>
But for everyone<BR><BR>

It's Halloween<BR>
It's Halloween<BR>
It's Halloween<BR>
It's Halloween<BR><BR>

It's Halloween!<BR><BR>

<FONT SIZE=+1>Why Do I Feel?</FONT><BR><BR>

Sometimes I feel funny<BR>
And bottled up inside<BR>
Then for some reason<BR>
I just start to cry<BR><BR>

Sometimes I feel happy<BR>
And overflowing with joy<BR>
Then things change<BR>
And I start to worry<BR><BR>

Why do I feel the way I feel?<BR>
Why do I do the things I do?<BR>
Why do I feel the way I feel?<BR><BR>

Sometimes I worry over nothing at all<BR>
Sometimes I think life's just a ball<BR>
When life changes and turns the other way<BR>
I try to think of something gay<BR><BR>

Why do I feel the way I feel?<BR>
Why do I do the things I do?<BR>
Why do I feel the way I feel?<BR><BR>

There are times when I feel sad<BR>
There are times when I feel blue<BR>
What makes me feel this way the most<BR>
Is when I don't know why I do the things I do<BR><BR>

Why do I do the things I do?<BR>
Why do I feel the way I feel?<BR>
Why do I do the things I do?<BR><BR>

There are times when I feel sad<BR>
There are times when I feel blue<BR>
What makes me feel this way the most<BR>
Is when I don't know why I do the things I do<BR><BR>

Why do I do the things I do?<BR>
Why do I feel the way I feel?<BR>
Why do I do the things I do?<BR>

<FONT SIZE=+1>What Should I Do?</FONT><BR><BR>

What should I do<BR>
What should I do<BR>
Tell me, tell me<BR>
What should I do<BR><BR>

He's a sad boy<BR>
He's a bad boy<BR>
He never gives me any joy<BR>
Tell me what should I do<BR><BR>

He's a two-face<BR>
He's a disgrace<BR>
He never wins a race<BR>
Tell me what should I do<BR><BR>

Should I tell him goodbye<BR>
Should I tell him we're through<BR>
Should I tell him I know he lies<BR>
Won't someone tell me what should I do<BR><BR>

What should I do<BR>
What should I do<BR>
Tell me, tell me<BR>
What should I do<BR><BR>

Sometimes he's kind<BR>
Sometimes he's cruel<BR>
Sometimes he's mean<BR>
And other times he's true <BR><BR>

Tell me what should I do<BR><BR>

Wish someone would answer me<BR>
But don't know who<BR>
Wish someone would tell me, tell me<BR>
What to do<BR><BR>

Don't tell me I've had good times with him<BR>
'Cause I know they're true<BR>
Don't tell me I still love him<BR>
'Cause I know that too<BR><BR>

Just tell me what should I do<BR>

Tell me, tell me<BR>

<FONT SIZE=+1>We Have A Savior</FONT><BR><BR>

Why does the world go unholy (?)<BR>
Why does everyone fight more and more<BR>
Don't they know we have a saviour<BR>
All we have to do is believe and pray<BR><BR>

Why must we go unheathen (?)<BR>
Why does anyone have to run (?)<BR>
Don't they know we have a saviour<BR>
That's what God told us guys (?)<BR><BR>

I often sit and wonder <BR>
Why people do the things they do<BR>
And I can't understand, no I can't understand<BR>
Why they don't have faith in the Lord, like I do  <BR><BR>

Why do the people go on killing<BR>
Why do they feel sad and blue<BR>
Don't they know we have a saviour<BR>
Just watching over me and you<BR><BR>

I often sit and wonder <BR>
