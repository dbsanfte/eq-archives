Fitz assists the police department in tracking down a serial killer who claims to be in love with him.  With the clock ticking and minimal evidence to move the investigation along, Fitz must find a way to locate the killer before she strikes again.  As if that weren't enough, Fitz is also having problems at home:  Judith, his wife, is on the verge of throwing in the towel on their marriage; and Michael, his teen-aged son, finds it extremely difficult to relate to his equally troubled father.<br><br>

In the second episode of this story, Fitz' son becomes the next target for attack and he must race against the clock to find the killer before his son lies dead.<br><br>

This pilot episode was based on a story originally shown in the UK series of Cracker, known as "True Romance" (Season Three (UK), Episodes 5 and 6).
