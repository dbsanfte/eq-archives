This two-parter storyline was quite a shocker apparently.  Hannah Tyler (played by Angela Featherstone) is apparently kidnapped (according to series producer James Sadwith) and killed at the end of the second part (according to Noelle, our faithful rare info and photo donator).<br><br>

These episodes were never aired and were part of a series of "canned" episodes that were filmed, ready for air, but never shown due to the premature cancellation of the series by ABC.<br><br></font>

Never aired in the U.S. and Canada on the ABC Network and was canned instead, never to be seen.<br>
