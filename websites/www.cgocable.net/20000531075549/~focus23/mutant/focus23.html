The main motive and method of Focus 23 goes something like this, taken from their web page:<BR><BR>

Focus 23 (based in Canada) have been recording musick since the inception of the group on December 25th of 1993. The main thrust of the musick is based largely on ideas steming from dreams and chaos. Musick is one of the best mediums for expressing the communication of experimental thought. Focus 23 is a project for which there is no concrete goal except the exploration of musickal dreams and ideas. Hopefully, a learning experience is achieved for each of its participants.<BR><BR>
Focus 23 has set about a plan to release different types of media for various projects, including cassettes, videos, computer music files, literature, CDs, and more.  Some Focus 23 products are only put out in limited releases, the amount varying each time. Submissions of sound/video/unknown are also accepted from others
to be warped and mutated towards the ends of future experiments, fully crediting each owner as per their submission.<BR><BR>
Generally speaking, Focus 23 material is released via Mutant. However, most of their material has been distributed by other organizations, such as Third Force in Canada.<BR><BR>

Focus 23 are primarily J.Morrow, who also helps run Mutant on what little spare time he has.<BR><BR>

To date, Focus 23 have released two albums.  The first release, <B>50/50</B> is the starting point of the group.  Collecting old material rejected and reworked from J.Morrow's early days in bands like Parasites and Industrial Strength Noise, it collects the old with the new.  Originally released as a cassette limited to 29 copies, it has long since run out of print.  The second side of the cassette reworked old and rejected material from years of experimenting previously to the inception of the group.  The first side of the cassette consisted of material recorded during the first four months after the creation of the group.  Most of the material was created from tape submissions and reworkings done both by J.Morrow and the other contributors on the project.  <B>50/50</B> was later issued in a even more limited print run on CD as a two CD package including over fifty minutes of live material from the days when J.Morrow and C.Virtanen used to experiment and mix found sounds and noise live-to-air on C.Virtanen's radio show, <B>Tape Delay</B>.  This limited CD printing was done more as a joke than anything else, as well as a way of digitally backing up the original tapes, which were losing quality all too quickly.<BR><BR>

Focus 23's second release, <B>A Snake In The Glade</B>, is notorious for taking forever to create.  Delay after delay pushed this album back so far, many thought it would never see the light of day.  Released straight to CD, it was not limited to a print run.  Where the first album centered mainly around found sounds and thematic moments based in personal reflection, Snake seems far more rhythmical.  Where the early material is disjointed and Nurse With Wound like, this second release shows a more rhythmic minimalism that lies somewhere between Lustmord, Nurse With Wound, and Hafler Trio.  At least, that's what J.Morrow thinks.<BR><BR>

Focus 23 are not a band that likes to appear live.  In fact, they have done one live appearance in total, and it was to appear on a radio show as a live act.  Instead of actually playing live, they told the audience they were playing live, then put on a tape.  The track they played was called "Live" and it was later released on the Snake project.  Focus 23 will never play live again, and this is apparently a strong promise.<BR><BR>
