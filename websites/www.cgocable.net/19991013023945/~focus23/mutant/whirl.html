Whirl (based in Ontario) are a pet project of S.Cunningham, who's brief stints in early punk bands like The Semen Heads have splintered into something quite different.  Starting from his first release of the sixty minute self-titled cassette, <B>Whirl</B>, things have been pretty haywire ever since.  Cunningham's method of madness, if at all categorizable, lies somewhere between Daniel Johnson, Jandek, Nurse With Wound, and Scanner.  The self-titled cassette was quickly followed by an even longer piece taking up a ninety minute cassette, known as <B>China White</B>.  Since then, Whirl has regressed into the background of Ontario's industrial and experimental music scene, choosing only to perform live within moments of spontaneous musical explosions.  He still performs today, mostly at "happenings" run by himself and a few allies.  These "happenings" are somewhere between a rave and a psychick rally of sorts.  It seems a good home for Whirl.<BR><BR>

Both Whirl releases are long out of print, and seeing as they required hand-printed packaging there are no plans to reprint either release.  A sampling of Whirl's experiments from the <B>China White</B> cassette can be found in the Product section of Mutant in the form of downloadable MP3s, playable on both the PC and Macintosh platforms.<BR><BR>
