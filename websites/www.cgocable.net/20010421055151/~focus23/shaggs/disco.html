<B>Original Liner Notes To "Philosophy Of The World"</B><BR>
By: Unknown (probably Austin Wiggin, Jr., the guy who ran off with their vinyl pressings of <EM>Philosophy Of The World,</EM> someone from NRBQ, or someone at Red Rooster/Rounder Records)</FONT><BR><BR>

<P>The Shaggs are real, pure, unaffected by outside influences.  Their music is different, it is theirs alone.  They believe in it, live it.  It is a part of them and they are a part of it.  Of all contemporary acts in the world today, perhaps only the Shaggs do what others would like to do, and that is perform only what they believe in, what they feel, not what others think the Shaggs should feel.</P>

<P>The Shaggs love you, and love to perform for you.  You may love their music or you may not, but whatever you feel, at last you know you can listen to artists who are real.  They will not change their music or style to meet the whims of a frustrated world.  You should appreciate this because you know they are pure what more can you ask?</P>

<P>Betty, Helen and Dorothy Wiggin are the Shaggs.  They are sisters and members of a large family where mutual respect and love for each other is at an unbelievable high.  They study and practice together, encouraged and helped by those around them.  Betty, Helen and Dorothy live in a small town in New Hampshire, in an atmosphere which has encouraged them to develop their music unaffected by outside influences.  They are happy people and love what they are doing.  They do it because they love it.</P>

<FONT SIZE=+1>This album has to have one of the ugliest album covers ever made.  I used to work in a radio station that had this album and so I went back to the station to look at the album again.  It's really bland, sort of an off pink colour.  The back cover has a large photo of the Shaggs playing live (pictured above).  The front cover has the band and album title written in two terrible fonts overlaid on each other; one a script font and another a strong blocky bold typeface.  The front cover also includes three family pictures of the Shaggs (from top to bottom): Dot and Helen at the beach relaxing on a beach towel, a similar Shaggs live shot but the only drums Helen has consists of nothing more than a single snare drum,  and a studio shot of Helen playing drums from what appears to be the early days, possibly even the Philosophy session.  If anyone can get me any other information or a scan of the cover art (front and back) of this album, it would be much appreicated.</FONT><BR><BR>

Recorded January 20, 1975 at Fleetwood, as well as during home rehearsals from the early '70s.<BR>
The live version of "Gimme Dat Ding" was recorded on April 1st, 1972 at Fremont Town Hall, Fremont, NH.<BR>

<B>Original Liner Notes To The CD Release of "The Shaggs"</B><BR>
By: John DeAngelis</FONT><BR><BR>

<P>When Austin Wiggin, Jr. and his teenage daughters Dorothy, Betty, and Helen drove from their home in Fremont, New Hampshire to a recording studio in Revere, Mass. one day in the late 1960s, none of the participants could have guessed at the events that were to transpire as a result of the music recorded that day.  The girls hadn't been playing very long and were uncertain of their abilities.  Upon hearing the three sisters play, the recording engineer suggested to Austin that perhaps the girls weren't quite ready to record.  But Austin Wiggin, Jr., a true visionary, was intent on capturing the moment.  "I want to get them while they're hot," he reportedly said.</P>

<P>The music recorded that day was indeed hot, and Austin paid a local entrepeneur to release <EM>Philosophy Of The World</EM> by the Shaggs on the Third World label.  The "entrepeneur," however, dissapeared with Austin's money and most of the albums that had been manufactured.  If ever a record was doomed to obscurity, this one seemed to be it.</P>

<P>What copies of <EM>Philosophy Of The World</EM> did survive miraculously found themselves into the right hands.  WBCN-FM in Boston played selections from <EM>Philosophy</EM> several times; local musicians like Andy Paley discovered the record and began championing the Shaggs; someone at WBCN played <EM>Philosophy</EM> for Frank Zappa, who was quite taken with it; and finally tenor saxophonist and composed Keith Spring, then playing with the Whole Wheat Horns, an adjunct to the legendary adventurous NRBQ, played a tape of the Shaggs for the rest of NRBQ.  Shortly thereafter arrangements were made to reissue <EM>Philosophy Of The World</EM> on NRBQ's own Red Rooster label, distributed by Rounder Records.</P>

<P>Perhaps no album, either prior to or since, has generated as intense a reaction as <EM>Philosophy Of The World</EM> did upon its reissue.  Most critics loved it, although their reasons varied greatly.  Some thought the Shaggs were a joke, or some elaborate hoax.  Debra Rae Cohen in <EM>Rolling Stone</EM> (which cited the Shaggs as the Comeback of the Year band in their 1980 Rock and Roll Awards) said, "I'd call <EM>Philosophy Of The World</EM> a work of primitive American genius but I'm too busy rolling on the floor."  Others took the Shaggs more seriously.  Bruce D. Rhodewalt in <EM>L.A. Weekly</EM> said, "If we can judge music on the basis of its honesty, originality and impact, then the Shaggs' <EM>Philosophy Of The World</EM> is the greatest record ever recorded in the history of the universe." And OP magazine said, "The Shaggs integrity and purity of vision shine through like a 50,000-watt lighthouse on a stormy night.  Listen to this record.  It <EM>will</EM> change your life."</P>

<P>It's easy to see how someone could have been confounded by this wonderful music.  Here were three teens playing instruments we've heard countless times, but this time with none of the familiar signposts--none of the standard rhythms or chord progressions we've come to recognize and, yes, even expect.  On the other hand, listening to this music without perceptions or expectations reveals a refreshingly playful, yet decidedly structured sound with its own complex inner logic.  "I have yet to play a Shaggs cut for a professional musician who didn't roll his eyes and whisper, 'Where can I get this record?'," said Dan Forte in <EM>The Record</EM>, and no wonder.</P>

<P>This compact disc, which collects all previously issued Shaggs material and two new items, offers the listener--whether familiar or new to this music--the best-ever opportunity to appreciate the Shaggs.  For one thing, the music itself has never sounded as good as it does here.  Not suprisingly, the original Third World release of <EM>Philosophy</EM> was neither mixed nor mastered in the most highly attentive fashion.  And since the original master tapes were believed to have been stolen from the Wiggin residence, the Red Rooster/Rounder reissue had to be painstakingly transferred from a clean copy of the original release.  Recently, however, Terry Adams of NRBQ was speaking to Dot Wiggin on the phone when she mentioned that she had come across some "big tapes" while going through a closet in her home.  It was soon discovered that the "big tapes" included the original multitrack recordings of <EM>Philosophy Of The World</EM>.</P>

<P>Now newly mixed and mastered, with errors in pitch and speed finally corrected, and aided by the full-range, compression-free compact disc medium, this definitive version of <EM>Philosophy</EM> reveals a cleaner, yet wonderfully bracing quality that will suprise even those already familiar with its contents.  Each instrument has a spatial and sonic heft to it, and there are other surprises as well.  A bass guitar, omitted from the original mix of "That Little Sports Car," has been restored, adding a whole new dimension to that song.  Also heard for the first time is a pre-take run-through of "Who Are Parents."</P>

<P>This CD will also give listeners another chance to evaluate the somewhat less-heralded <EM>Shaggs Own Thing</EM>, which contains material recorded after <EM>Philosophy</EM> that was compiled and released after that record's triumphant reissue.  Perhaps both the slightly less abstract quality of these later compositions, and the fact that the Shaggs were presenting their own unique interpretations of other people's songs, confused those who were expecting a carbon copy of <EM>Philosophy</EM>.  For me, <EM>Shaggs Own Thing</EM> reveals these remarkable youngsters, this time aided by youngest sister Rachel on bass (with guest appearances by brother Bob and Austin Wiggin, Jr.), relentlessly pursuing their refreshingly unaffected artistic vision with sincerity and creativity.  Especially delightful is the mature, almost sensuous remake of "My Pal Foot Foot"; Dorothy Wiggin's exquisite adolescent reverie, "My Cutie"; and Betty Wiggin's only known composition, "Painful Memories," which Dorothy embellishes with some inspired whammy bar chording.  And there's also a previously unreleased original composition, "Love At First Sight."</P>

<P>The Shaggs originated almost twenty years ago.  As mass media increasingly permeates our society with a sameness that is frightening, it seems unlikely that another band of this kind of quality and originality will ever come along again.  Or maybe in some distant country, as you read this, a proud father is giving his daughters (or sons) instruments and is exhorting them--in whatever language--to "do your own thing."  Whatever the case, the Shaggs did <EM>their</EM> own thing and we have an eloquent reminder in these awe-inspiring recordings.</P>

<B><FONT SIZE=+2>Only In America (compilation appearance) (1998)</FONT></B><BR><BR>

(We currently have no scanned cover art available for this album, and are trying to get some from Arf!Arf! Records or just buy the darned thing.)<BR><BR>

First Pressing -  Arf!Arf! Records (product code unknown) - 1998<BR><BR>

<FONT SIZE=+1>After a long long absence, some unreleased Shaggs material hits the shelves of record stores.  This compilation from Arf!Arf! Records includes one track by the Shaggs, specifically a live version of "My Pal Foot Foot".  Not much more about the track is known, such as when/where it was recorded or how Arf!Arf! Records got their hands on this previously unreleased material.</FONT><BR><BR>

<FONT SIZE=+1>When Arf!Arf! Records was e-mailed by this site in July of '98, we were told that lots of copies of the compilation still exist as are selling quite cheap as well.  They are $14 US funds plus $3 US funds if you are ordering from Canada.  They are a label that specializes in sixties and seventies freak music, from what we can figure.  You can reach them by postal mail at the following address:  Arf! Arf! Records; P.O.Box 465; Middleborough, MA; 02346.  You can also visit their <A HREF="http://www.tiac.net/users/aheller/arfarf/">web page</A>.  If you want to e-mail them, there are links on their web page that allow you to do just that.  Their complete ordering catalog is available on their web site.<BR><BR>

<B>A Review Of "Only In America"</B><BR>
By: Lang Thompson</FONT><BR><BR>

<P>This mind-altering compilation delivers exactly what the phrase "incredibly strange music" promised, much better than the albums designed to tie into the Re/Search books devoted to that subject.  Those albums--like the general attitude of the Re/Search editors--were more like mausoleums of smug hipness, using some slightly odd music to bludgeon a mythic mainstream.  Which is a roundabout way of saying that Only in America is the real thing: a fully packed (78 minute) collection of bizarre, peculiar and downright stupefying recordings that will make you either proud or deeply ashamed to be an American.</P>

<P>It kicks off with a Dr. Demento staple, a record devoted entirely to the sounds of people laughing.  There were actually a bunch of these things, the result a burp of capitalist profit-hunting.  But that's pretty tame considering what else is in store.  A tap-dancing version of Buffalo Springfield's "For What It's Worth"? A dinky pop tune with a vaccuum cleaner solo? Garage versions of grotesque schoolyard rhymes? A country singer tackling acid rock? An unreleased live Shaggs recording? They're all here and that's not the half of it. You just won't know what to do with an instruction record teaching you how to use crow calls, especially when it includes a re-enactment of a crow hunt.  And there are easily half a dozen entrancing stabs at rock songs that make you wonder just what the perpetrators were thinking.</P>

<P>Even more attractive is the fact that the album doesn't come off as a thrown together oddities collection.  It's got a flow that makes it hold together in some strange (what else?) way. For that we can credit Erik Lindgren of Birdsongs of the Mesozoic, who compiled, annotated and released this (his label also just put out a superb anthology of Sixties psychedelia 30 Seconds Before the Calico Wall).  Buy copies for gifts; the world needs Volumes Two and Three quite soon.</P>
