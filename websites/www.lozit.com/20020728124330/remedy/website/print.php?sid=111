Okay, so most of you knew... I didnt really quit, just had to go away for a week or so to take care of a few things. Ok, that's a lie. Actually I was watching a fist fight between Marlon Brando and the artist formerly known as Danny Aiello. It lasted out for over 3 days as they chased eachother in their wheelchairs and threw canes and other various flammable explosive composites after eachother. But enough of my babbling, now onto the dead stuff.<br><br>

Oh well, we got that sorted out and came back for him, stuffed a tommy gun up his rear and pulled the trigger. Not a pretty sight, hense why I'm just showing you his head.<br><br><center><img src=http://home.worldonline.dk/~Kingri/Screenshots/April%20Fools/exiled.JPG><br><br></center>

We've been farming glyphed and exiled a load too, and gotten some decent loots from exiled. Caladar and Rtyui picked up some of these<br><br><center><img src=http://home.worldonline.dk/~Kingri/Screenshots/April%20Fools/memory.JPG><img src=http://home.worldonline.dk/~Kingri/Screenshots/April%20Fools/jadeskullring.JPG></center><br><br>Truth is I don't remember where the Ring is from, but it kinda sucks. Glyphed is actually quite fun now that you can't hide from the AE, slightly more difficult, but still gets the beatdown that Skyl deserves every time.<br><br>

We took our Lord Yelinak and King Tormax also, using the new and unique strat devised by Skyl; flykick them for 32000~~. Never fails. Throw in some dead N ToV stuff here and there, and you've got yourself a packet of chocolate flavoured pringles.<br><br><img src=http://home.worldonline.dk/~Kingri/Screenshots/April%20Fools/tormax.JPG><br><br><br><b>Buddah, monk God and lover of Silverx</b><br><br><img src=http://home.worldonline.dk/~Kingri/Screenshots/April%20Fools/jmich.jpg><br><br><img src=http://home.worldonline.dk/~Kingri/Screenshots/April%20Fools/silverx.jpg><br><br><br><b>Bernie adventure of the day!</b><br><br><img src=http://www.warpedlight.com/~mox/NixonBernie.jpg><br><br>~Arbaal<br><br>
