    <center><br><br><b><h1>OHYA!</h1><br><br><h2>News at 11 - < Steel Horsemen > clears Ssraeshza and Vex Thal!</h2></b></center><br><br><br>Let's talk about complete gimpification. Gimpification is making things easier than they already are. Let's start with Vex Thal bosses. Realistically speaking, you cannot lose to them. Considering you need to kill Emperor Ssraeshza to get in there, they should be Bruce Springsteen hardcore. Instead they used to be Bryan Adams difficult, but now after yesterday's patch they arent even goddamn Garth Brooks hardcore. They've been reduced to a lowly, measly, sucky Eric Clapton state of uselessness. Now what the hell is up with that? Ok, in all fairness. They had too goddam much HP, and with their DPS, seriously, go in close, hit A, go AFK for 30 mins, come back, loot. But ok, what they did this patch was completely unnecessary... I would have been fine if the bosses had remained the same way they used to be. All they had to do was decrease yard trash HP by about 50%. <br><br>

For those who arent familiar with Vex Thal, it's like clearing through endless fields of Dain Frostreaver's. Aka, you end up becoming a paranoid old delusional gimp. I'll bet that's what started that huge paranoia trend that's going around nowadays. Anyone that's in a zone at another time when another guild is raiding is quite obviously a ShowEQ user, hacker, strat-stealer, communist and possibly related to Lisa Minelli.<br><br>

To get back on the subject, an example of gimpification would be what they've done to Emperor Ssraeshza. HELLO! Get a clue morons, removing the proc and making him turgurs slowable is NOT the way to fix the encounter. That's just making him easier than Derakor the Vindicator, as if such a thing is possible. Fix him, before all the people who use gay "Hey look at me, I'm a jedi, guru, homosexual and halfling, because i took the useless information which no one cares about test" signatures on their Ezboards start running around in Vex Thal. For Gods sake, that alone should be reason enough. Hint hint.<br><br>

Another epic display of gimpification would be removing the AE from most mobs. I know that has to be unintended, but still, how the hell do you screw up that? I'd compare that to puncturing a tire while you're sitting inside the car wanting to adjust the rear view mirror. IE: You have to be completely clueless. Sweet Jesus. We did another farming session of Vyzh´dra the Cursed last night. oh the joys of fighting him without AE. That was possibly the most trivial fight we've ever done, in fact, it was so easy that Bayla decided to help the Cursed out a little by gating him.<br><br><img src=http://www.amm-electronics.net/remedy/Aten/cursedgate.JPG><br><b><h1>OHYA!</h1></b><br><br><br><br>So anyway, what have we been doing... You guessed it, farming the shit out of Vex Thal. We dropped Aten Ha Ra another two times.<br><br><center><img src=http://www.amm-electronics.net/remedy/Aten/atencorpse.JPG></center><br><br>Huge grats goes out to <b>Karekgogo</b> and <b>Zahlia</b> on the Talismans, <b>Ghazaki</b> on the Great Shadow Platemail, <b>Karynna</b> on the Torch of Judgement, <b>Arbaal</b>(/blush) on the Legging's of Secrets, <b>Liqfroxt</b> on the Earring of Eradication, <b>Badcat</b> on the Crimson Ring of Judgement and <b>Silverx</b> on the Orb of Secrets.<br><br><center><img src=http://www.amm-electronics.net/remedy/Aten/atentorch.JPG><img src=http://www.amm-electronics.net/remedy/Aten/atenring.JPG><br><img src=http://www.amm-electronics.net/remedy/Aten/atenorb.JPG><img src=http://www.amm-electronics.net/remedy/Aten/atenlegs.JPG><br><img src=http://www.amm-electronics.net/remedy/Aten/atenearring.JPG></center><br><br>We also finished clearing the whole zone of Vex Thal. When we dropped Aten Ha Ra first time, we still hadnt killed Thall Xundraux Diabo or Kaas Thox Xi Aten Ha Ra. Well, we have now. So um, ok... I guess? They were like...wow... Hard. Yeah, that's it. They werent free loot like everything else in Vex Thal at all. No sir. Well ok, I guess i must follow the trend and bitch about Kaas Thox Xi Aten Ha Ra. Three simple words and an abbreviation: Too fucking much Hp. What's really great about them too, is right after you spend half an hour of your life killing one, you can go right across the hallway and spend another half hour of your life killing another.<br><br><h1>OHYA!</h1><br><br>You'd think that their endless amount of HP would be the pinnacle of gayness, but when you bend over the corpse, loot and see this...<br><br><img src=http://www.amm-electronics.net/remedy/Aten/kaaswand.JPG><br><br>...well, it just got a whole lot more gay. I'm not talking about Rtyui gay, I'm talking all the way to Larcenciel. Yes, <b>THAT</b> gay. We're getting drowned in AE food and AE water every day, <b>Everlegency</b> that little shithead outbid everyone else on both the food and water items. Well anyway, here's the screenshots of Kaas and Xundraux...<br><br><center><img src=http://www.amm-electronics.net/remedy/Aten/xundrauxcorpse.JPG><img src=http://www.amm-electronics.net/remedy/Aten/kaascorpse.JPG><br><b><h1>OHYA!</h1></b></center><br><br><br>Here's some pictures of the loot we've gotten, being the masochistic pricks we are. Actually, we did a few more than this, but I am a slacker and missed some raids.<br><br><center><img src=http://www.amm-electronics.net/remedy/Aten/diaboxivaloot.JPG><img src=http://www.amm-electronics.net/remedy/Aten/kelunloot.JPG><img src=http://www.amm-electronics.net/remedy/Aten/temarielloot.JPG><img src=http://www.amm-electronics.net/remedy/Aten/temarielloot2.JPG><img src=http://www.amm-electronics.net/remedy/Aten/vaxiatenloot.JPG><img src=http://www.amm-electronics.net/remedy/Aten/vaxiatenloot2.JPG><img src=http://www.amm-electronics.net/remedy/Aten/xinthallloot.JPG><img src=http://www.amm-electronics.net/remedy/Aten/xinthallloot2.JPG><br><img src=http://www.amm-electronics.net/remedy/Aten/thallvaxakraloot.JPG><img src=http://www.amm-electronics.net/remedy/Aten/thallvaxakraloot2.JPG><img src=http://www.amm-electronics.net/remedy/Aten/thallvaxakraloot3.JPG><img src=http://www.amm-electronics.net/remedy/Aten/kaasthoxxiansdyekloot2.JPG><img src=http://www.amm-electronics.net/remedy/Aten/kaasthoxxiansdyekloot.JPG><br><br></center>The beauty of this here is that we're on a point system, and everyone is hoarding for Aten Ha Ra and Emperor loots, so half this stuff almost ends up rotting or going to guests. Hell, we've even had an Emperor loot go to a guest.<br><br>Actually, I just thought of something that i want to bitch about. Woot, go me. Why is it that every single goddam patch Verant makes, they screw up my UI? What the hell have I ever done to them, apart from Gfluxing Guides Gronkus, Kahil and Tyania to their deaths? (To which I was punished by being summoned to and rebound in Toxxulia forest, thank you very much) This is a conspiracy, I demand they stop fubaring my UI. Goddammit. Equality for the black man!<br><br><br>So anyway, back in Ssraeshza Temple... something completely extraordinary happened. Ladies and gentlemen, I present to you...<br><img src=http://www.amm-electronics.net/remedy/Aten/nocnivins.JPG><br>...<b>a Nocnivins Small Book of Logic!!!</b><br><br>That's right! On our 15th or so Cursed kill, we finally got a BOOK! Omg wow! So anyway, it's kinda ironic that a company such as Verant inc. uses the word "Logic" in their game. Logic being the one sole thing they have never, ever used. (Well apart from creativity, cunning, intelligence...oh and their brains) But hey, stop the press.<br><br>We've also killed Emperor a few times, for a total of eight kills now. Quite frankly, we're getting completely floodded in pal/sk loot, haste boots and the ring. It seems almost as if the Robe and Cloak do not exist, and the wis caster shawl is very very scarce also. Hey, let's not even begin talking about the Acrylia Handeled Broadsword. So while we're getting buried in monk staves and Sword of Ssraeshzas, where the hell is our AHB's? Don't even get me started on the useless droprate of Garrisons...<br><br><center><img src=http://www.amm-electronics.net/remedy/Aten/emploot.JPG><img src=http://www.amm-electronics.net/remedy/Aten/emploot2.JPG><img src=http://www.amm-electronics.net/remedy/Aten/emploot3.JPG><br><img src=http://www.amm-electronics.net/remedy/Aten/empstaff.JPG></center><br><br><br><br>Well, that's about it for now. However, with PoP just around the corner, I should probably comment a little on it. Let's call this comment...<br><br><b><h2>Omg wtf!</h2></b><br><br>Alright, where to start. Every single expansion so far has come late to Europe, giving American guilds a huge advantage as far as getting into the new expansion. Remedy as a guild would love to be able to walk right in PoP on October 22nd, but unfortunately, because of Ubisoft and Verant, we dont stand a fugging chance. Alot of us are still going to be stuck in Luclin, while everyone else is running around PoP, and quite frankly, it stinks.<br><br>

Our only goal outside of PoP is the Ring of Vulak. We've tried this event many many times, and have come very far, actually, we've almost come to Vulak himself, but a month or so ago the serverfilter broke. It isnt rare to have mass LD's on raids, but when half the raid goes LD and the other half has 10k ping, it isnt pretty. The huge amount of AE'ing mobs in that event simply causes alot of the people who dont have very fast computers to have 10 second delays in everything they do, from turning on auto attack, to healing and even to them still thinking the mob is alive after we have moved on to the next one. It's funny as hell in Vex Thal actually... When a mob uses G Flux, you can see who it is that lags because they get fluxed like 10-15 seconds after the rest of us land. Two patches has come and gone since they broke the serverfilter, and still, no sign of fixing it has been shown. I simply love it when American guilds complain about how easy Euro's have it. It's nothing short of beautiful.<br><br>On that note, it's time to finish up. See you in PoP this year, hopefully.<br><br><br><b>Quotes of the day</b>
