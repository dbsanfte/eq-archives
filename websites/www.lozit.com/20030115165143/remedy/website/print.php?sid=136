Well, if I have to give out an award for most creative encounter ever, this would get it. After seeing what a complete waste of a zone nightmareb is (it's one long winding corridor that leads to Terris' house, nothing more), I wasnt too happy when we engaged Terris. But damn, the twists and turns this fight takes, everything is just so well tuned. Talk about being caught with the pants down. On our first shot we got her to 33%, a satisfactory start, but not good enough. After some refinement in our strategy we came back at her and the result can be seen below:<br><br><center><img src=http://www.amm-electronics.net/remedy/terris/terriscorpse.JPG></center><br><br>I remember someone saying that you should not expect to win this fight on first try, just camp a rezzer outside the house... Well, we had 6 clerics so that option wasnt viable, I'll agree with it... Unless you have a solid strat for this mob, you wont win it on first try. I'll say that I am eagerly looking forward to more encounters later in this expansion designed by the person responsible for this one.<br><br>In other news, we killed <b>Aerin´Dar</b> again, did a full clearing of <b>Vex Thal</b> and some more <b>HoH Trials</b>. Now let me say this. My God, Vex Thal is beyond trivial now. For those unfamiliar with what I'm talking about, the gimping of the mobs AC, making EVERYTHING mezzable (as opposed to only Qua and Zov before) and the huge HP increases on meles now. Well... I guess that's what happens to all the 'uber' zones after some time, I just didnt expect it to happen so fast, considering it is still the best loot currently found in game at the moment. Here's what we bagged off Aten and Aerin.<br><br><img src=http://www.amm-electronics.net/remedy/terris/atenloot.JPG><img src=http://www.amm-electronics.net/remedy/terris/aerinloot.JPG><br><br><br><b>Quotes of the Day</b><br><br><img src=http://www.amm-electronics.net/remedy/terris/larcenciel.GIF><br><br><img src=http://www.amm-electronics.net/remedy/terris/rtyui.GIF><br><br><img src=http://www.amm-electronics.net/remedy/terris/rtyui2.GIF><br><br><img src=http://www.amm-electronics.net/remedy/terris/rtyui3.GIF><br><br><img src=http://www.amm-electronics.net/remedy/terris/rtyui4.GIF><br><br><img src=http://www.amm-electronics.net/remedy/terris/rtyui5.GIF><br><br><img src=http://www.amm-electronics.net/remedy/terris/rtyui6.GIF><br><br><img src=http://www.amm-electronics.net/remedy/terris/rtyui7.GIF><br><br><img src=http://www.amm-electronics.net/remedy/terris/rtyui8.GIF><br><br><img src=http://www.amm-electronics.net/remedy/terris/silverx.GIF><br><br>~Arbaal<br><br>
