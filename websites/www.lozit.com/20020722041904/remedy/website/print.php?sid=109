Damn what a sweet kill this was tonight. We've tried him like 10 times previously and gotten our asses handed to us pretty much everytime. Not tonight though, we had to get him back and we did. The fight lasted something like a half hour or so, and at some stages we had no tanks left so people were getting wiped out. Was a really sweet victory, very fun fight. Props to those guys that killed him with his old AE (without using the bug that allowed you to not get hit by it). And props to our guildies for coming back for more everytime till we took him down. Loot was ass, but what the hell... We had fun and that's what this game is about, right?<br><br>We ganked Dain an hour earlier also. Was some pretty fun chaos, having loads of adds. Grats Awenn on the head.<br><br><center><img src=http://home.worldonline.dk/~kingri/Screenshots/Goodbye/DainCorpse.JPG></center><br><br><br><b>Gay Larc</b><br><br><img src=http://home.worldonline.dk/~kingri/Screenshots/Goodbye/Larcengay.JPG><br><br><br>Now... For something more dull... Hmmm... Well, I'm not quite sure what to say so I'll let the picture say the words for me. I tried to get to Mort and Gage so I could imitate the Furor of LoS, but apparently, I've killed too many dwarves and ended up running to the zone for my life. So I found this little guy instead...<br><br><center><img src=http://home.worldonline.dk/~kingri/Screenshots/Goodbye/Inkeep.JPG></center><br><br>Goodbye to all my dear friends, and Remedy. My guild. Best of luck to you all. Gonna go out with a Bernie.<br><br><br><b>Bernie Adventure of the Day!</b><br><br>
