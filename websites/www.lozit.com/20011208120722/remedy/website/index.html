Today we killed Dragons, and a bunch of them too. We had a really late start, and amazingly managed to die to Eashen of the Sky again. Our excuse was that we only had 27 people on, but so what? Nah, actually, it was a flawless fight until our maintanks defensive ran out and died. The second tank was LD at this stage and the third and last warrior died faster than Kolienu can loot. This, ofcourse, cannot be good. He had to go.
<br>
<br>
<img src=http://home.worldonline.dk/~kingri/Eashen.jpg>
<br>
<br>
Loot was  a Twisted Bastard Steel Sword for <b>Fatal</b> and Twisted Steel Gauntlets that went to <b>Leandred</b>. After the kill we were gonna pull Aaryonar's pets, but things wasnt going our way... He came also. After a slow CR, we tried again, and once again, he came. Ok, enough on that... We had several people logging, it was past midnight. We CoH'd up to backdragons and did them in a slightly unusual order. Jorlleag, Zlexak, Sevalak, Cekenar and Lady Nevederia. Here's your killshots to prove we arent lying Euro trash.

<img src=http://home.worldonline.dk/~kingri/Nevederia.jpg>
<br>
<br>
Loot was phat, <b>Balgoth</b> got a Sprinkler of the Spirits, <b>Moonwalker</b> got a Facesmasher, <b>Chwing</b> and <b>Lowi</b> both got a Nevederia's Claw, <b>Jmich</b> got a Dragon Skin Bracelet, <b>Lowi</b> got a Axe of Resistance, <b>Leandred</b> got a Shield of the Dawn, <b>Polish</b> got a Silver Dagger of Destruction, <b>Rinderwahn</b> got a Mithril Helm, <b>Vipsindsyg</b> got Mithril Boots, <b>Zahlia</b> got a Shawl of Perception, <b>Bayla</b> got a Siren Song, Dagger of the Sea, <b>Rtyui</b> got a Bracelet of the Deep Sea and lastly, <b>Armonegonx</b> got a Shield of Thorns and <b>Sick</b> got a Shield of Dragonkind.
<br>
<br>
Wow, what a load of phat loots we have gotten in the last few days. Time to call it a night here, patch tomorrow again, so more dragons are gonna die!
<br>
<br>
Ok, now for a rant, why do the Velious chars look so gay? Just look at this, the Erudite male is seriously screwed up!!

<font size="2" color="#FFFFFF">Today was another good day, following up from yesterday. Sure things could have gone way better, but all in all we did good. Things started off easy, Jorlleag was first to die.
<br>
<br>
<img src=http://home.worldonline.dk/~kingri/JorlleagCorpse3.jpg>
<br>
<br>
He dropped some more Silver Chains for <b>Rtyui Sleepig</b>, a Helm of the Crawler for <b>Karekgogo</b>, who now looks scarier than Meryl Streep in Bridges of Madison County, and a Facesmasher for <b>Doublethread</b>.
<br>
<br>
Good start, next up for a beatdown was Lady Nevederia. Has anyone solved that quest about her three children yet? Oh well, here's the killshot:
<br>
<br>
<img src=http://home.worldonline.dk/~kingri/LadyNevederiaCorpse3.jpg>
<br>
<br>
Loot was ... different... today, <b>Chwing</b> and <b>Choupie</b> recieved her horns and <b>Martrim</b> got a Medal of Deep Thought.
<br>
<br>
Zlexak, our old buddy who had poofed on us last night with a Spinning Orb of Confusion made his comeback yet again today. He got a good start and some people died, but we quickly turned it around and the result was this:
<br>
<br>
<img src=http://home.worldonline.dk/~kingri/ZlexakCorpse3.jpg>
<br>
<br>
Guess what the loot was? Another Spinning Orb of Confusion, which <b>Lowi</b> quickly ninjalooted before the server crashed again.
<br>
<br>
The next fight was insane... Our super pullers somehow managed to get Sevalak solo, and we were fully prepared but something went horribly wrong. People were dying left and right, he was tearing through us... It was an unreal fight, words cannot even explain it. After a long long fight, which must have lasted atleast 30 mins we managed to turn the tide with massive rez-zerg tactics. I dont know how we pulled it off, but in the end we were victorious. Loot? A Shield of Midnight that <b>Pilate</b> ninjalooted. Grats bank slot 5!
<br>
<br>
<img src=http://home.worldonline.dk/~kingri/SevalakCorpse2.jpg>
<br>
<br>
On top of that huge fight, we quickly managed to rebuff, regroup and pull Cekenar within the next 5 mins. He went down without a fight, infact, I dont think he even bothers trying anymore. Loot was a Frosted Ice Spike for <b>Choupie</b>.
<br>
<br>
<img src=http://home.worldonline.dk/~kingri/CekenarCorpse2.jpg>
<br>
<br>
So the top of ToV was clear, we pulled out our CoH'ers and moved down a bit. Within long Eashen of the Sky was pulled, but the room added for some reason we couldnt figure out (/cough bad monks) and we actually wiped out on him. What a sad sad day. After a quick rez/buff session, everyone was ready and we ressed the monks who got to work and this time brought Eashen with just one guard. No problem, we killed them both almost flawlessly. Loot was a Bracelet of the Sky for <b>Sterne</b> and Onyx Chain Sleeves for <b>Dinadmera</b>.
<br>
<br>
<img src=http://home.worldonline.dk/~kingri/EashenCorpse3.jpg>
<br>
<br>
It was getting late. Very late. Some people was falling asleep, and some pressed the wrong hotkeys. Like Grook. /hug
<br>
<br>
<img src=http://home.worldonline.dk/~kingri/GrookDisc.jpg>
<br>
<br>
Next up for a smackdown, was ofcourse the badass Aaryonar. What can I say, this fight went down without a single flaw except for a few laggers who died to enrage at the end. Loot was a Amulet of the Dreadgazer to <b>Silverx Balanec</b> and a Rocksmasher to <b>Kaio Weedwar</b>.
<br>
<br>
<img src=http://home.worldonline.dk/~kingri/AaryonarCorpse2.jpg>
<br>
<br>
It was really late now, we were down to 26 people. What the hell, who are we to give up? Lord Feshlak INC! Very hardcore fight, but everyone did very very well and in the end:
<br>
<br>
<img src=http://home.worldonline.dk/~kingri/FeshlakCorpse.jpg>
<br>
<br>
Loot was a Chestplate of Fiery Might to <b>Zzijah</b>, a Sky Watchers Monolith to <b>Doublethread</b> and an Amulet of the Storm that was given to our guest <b>Ciladar</b>.
<br>
<br>
We moved to another camp and pulled Lord Kreizenn. The pullers brought him and one of his pets, which we quickly disposed off, and after a long long fight, Lord Kreizenn wiped us out. Ah well, we are getting good at this rez/buff thing. We cleared some repops and began pulling again. Lord Kreizenn was pulled, a good long fight unfolded and in the end we nailed him to the ground. Loots was a Silver Disc which went to <b>Fat Al</b>, and a Dawncaller, Blade of Morning and Ancient Fire Etched Flamberge which both went to some happy Destroy buttons. Oh, and Kreizenn's guard dropped a Shaman shield which sadly decayed.
<br>
<br>
<img src=http://home.worldonline.dk/~kingri/KreizennCorpse.jpg>
<br>
<br>
About a month or two ago, I started a poll on the Dragons Clans board, regarding who is the God of Gay. That poll can be found <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fdragonsclanstnfrm10.showMessage?topicID=18.topic>here</a href>
<br>
<br>
I have new evidence which supports that <b>Larcenciel</b> indeed is the God of Gay. Just look at this:
<br>
<br>
<img src=http://home.worldonline.dk/~kingri/LarcencielGay.jpg>
<br>
<br>
Please, Ladies and Gentlemen, I beg of you, click the link and vote for Larcenciel.

<font size="2" color="#FFFFFF">Hi!
<br>
So what have we been doing today you ask? Good question! Well, Luclin came out for all the Americans yesterday, while we are still eagerly awaiting our own here in Europe, so we decided to go back to ToV to take out some of our agressions on the denizens there. And so we did! We started out the night with Ikatiar the Venom.
<br>
<br>
<img src=http://home.worldonline.dk/~kingri/IkatiarCorpse2.jpg>
<br>
He died. Loot was two Ancient Wyvern Hide Tunics that was awarded to <B> Fuffalo</b> and <b>Moster</b>. He also dropped a Mask of Venom that <b>Leandred</b> was given.
<br>
<br>
We decided to do things a little differently this time, and moved to a different spot to fight our dear Eashen of the Sky. The pull didnt go as well as planned, and we ended up with 3 of his guards also. We got our act together and killed it. Result:
<br>
<br>
<img src=http://home.worldonline.dk/~kingri/EashenCorpse2.jpg>
<br>
Loots was two Cloak of the Sky's that were given to <b>Pilate</b> and <b>Doublethread Evilhealers</b> who immediately tested if /q still was working. It was. He also dropped a Fist of Lightning, that <B>Fuffalo the rapper</b> got. He is a bad boy for life.
<br>
<br>
On to Aaryonar, things with him didnt go quite as well as it normally goes, and we wiped out. After a quick rebuff session and respawn clearing, we were ready to go again. Result: [Insert screenshot of dead dragon here that was ninjalooted before I got a chance to take a screenshot]
<br>
<br>
Loot was a Katana of Pain which <b>Areilsinger Yoholahihisamurai</b> ninjalooted, a Hand of the Master that <b>Chwing Gum</b> happily cut off and Mask of Fall that <b>Cutepai Armypig</b> ninja'd. Cutepai is in the Navy now, so all you horny boys out there can direct your tells to <B>Rinderwahn</b> meanwhile.
<br>
<br>
A quick CoH and we were ready to kill again. We pulled Jorlleag, who died easily and put out some Silver Chains that was awarded to <b>Utar</b> and <b>Martrim "I'm no slut" Heatstone</b>. Well what do you know, good loot dropping in two's all for the third time! <b>Pilate</b> also picked up a Facesmasher, if you try to move in on his Ragefire camp, it's on your own risk.
<br>

<br>
<br>
Next up was the lovely Lady Nevederia, we love her so. She reminds me of one of those Bus drivers that just cant stop passing gas and laughing about it as the whole bus full of passengers cough for air. She had to go:
<br>
<img src=http://home.worldonline.dk/~kingri/Resize%20of%20LadyNevederiaCorpse2.jpg>
<br>
<br>
Loot was nice, <b>Ghazaki</b> got her Left Eye, <b>Nisse Pisse</b> got a Mask of Terror and <b>Larcensongyy Colorwolf</b> got a Medal of Deep Thought.
<br>
<br>
Alright, things are going good, it's early yet and we have loads of more killing to do. Next inc? Zlexak ofcourse! Hoshkar's father came, saw, and got his ass put out on a plate. Loot? A super duper Spinning Orb of Confusion! Our first one to drop I might add, so who got it you might ask? I dont know! All of a sudden I got the "You have been disconnected" screen. Ah well, it happens. I press the Enter World button, and I log in. No Zlexak corpse. What happened here? Apparently the zone crashed, and the Orb was lost. Great :(
<br>
On the "bright" side, the whole zone had repopped. Everything we had killed was up again... Hmmm ok, Jorlleag INC! Loots: More Silver Chains, these <b>Aleja</b> picked up, and some Onyx Chain Leggings for <b>Nisse!</b>.
<br>
<br>
Lady Nevederia INC! Loots: Cloak of Thorns for <b>Joklun</b>, a Medal of Deep Thought for <b>Pilate</b> and a Girdle of Dark Power for <b>Zzijah</b>. Phat loots so far, so why stop here?
<br>
<br>
Zlexak INC! Loots: Twenkens Slippers of Silence for <b>Klytus</b>, and a Dragonspine rapier for <b>Sembyen</b>, Silverx's twink.
<br>
<br>
Cekenar INC! Loots: Silver Dagger of Destruction. This dagger went to a very deserving <b>Caladar</b>, grats Cal :) He also dropped two dragon meats that Rinderwahn hastily devoured, while screaming that he loves eating kittens.
<br>
<br>
Sevalak INC! Loots: A Shield of Midnight. Wow, very nice Shadowknight shield. Who got it? Grats <b>Fuffalo</b>!. Yep that's right, no one needed. Sevalak always surprises me at the quality of loot he drops, but this is too bad. GG Verant. /bird
<br>

<br>
<br>
At this stage, we decided to call it a night. There was a patch in 7 hours anyway, and it was late so why not... It was good today tho, 25 loots altho two were wasted.
<br>
<br>
<br>
<b>Bernie adventure of the day!</b>

If you see that wiz on your server, i would like you to know the story. He came from another server and made a /move char to join us. He came naked, we helped him to camp some items, we guilded him and we got him full kael gear, Dragon Bane and Epic in less than one month. No kidding, he was a friend.<br>
Then, last week, we discovered than this ... friend; was trying to join Darkwind. Yes, on another server ... He ninja moved to the new Euro server AB, without a word or farewell post.<br>
If you see him, plz, hug him for me.<br>

Last night we did what we enjoy the most, killing N ToV! We had drunk a glass of gnome blood each, and was ready at 6pm when server was meant to come up. We were also ready at 6:30pm when the server still hadnt come up. We were also ready at 7pm when the server still wasnt up, and when the server finally came up at 7:30pm, we were in a frenzy. We quickly got ready and buffed and started pulling. Shortly after, this guy was dead:
<br>

<img src=http://home.worldonline.dk/~kingri/IkatiarCorpse.jpg>
<br>
Loots were Ancient Wyvern Hide Boots, that was awarded to <b>Fuffalo the Rapper</b> and a Mask of Venom that <b>Areilsinger</b> got.
<br>
<br>
Next mob against the wall was Eashen of the Sky. Take aim....FIRE!
<br>
<img src=http://home.worldonline.dk/~kingri/EashenCorpse.jpg>
<br>
He dropped a Claw of Lightning that <b>Vipsindsyg</b> got, and Onyx Chain Sleeves that Mel Gibson, aka <b>Lydek</b> recieved.
<br>
<br>
We then logged on our mage and CoH'd up to the back, and within a very short time Jorlleag was pulled, resulting in this:
<br>
<img src=http://home.worldonline.dk/~kingri/JorlleagCorpse2.jpg>
<br>
Jorlleag dropped some Silver Chains for <b>bala nec</b>, a hammer of suck that <b>Hamb</b> ninjalooted and a Sprinkler of the Spirits that was awarded to <b>Sick</b>. Fun!
<br>
<br>
Lady Nevederia was next in the gunrange. She reached for her gun, we drew faster. Result =
<br>
<img src=http://home.worldonline.dk/~kingri/LadyNevederiaCorpse.jpg>
<br>
Nevederia fights are always funny as hell, and it was no exception this time. Anyway, she died. Loot was Nevederia's Left Eye that was given to <b>Karekgogo</b>, a Cloak of Thorns that <b>Grook da oger</b> was awarded and a Medal of Pure Thought that <b>Cutepai</b> was given.
<br>
<br>
Neeeeeeeeeeeeext!
<br>
<img src=http://home.worldonline.dk/~kingri/ZlexakCorpse2.jpg>
<br>
Loot from ol' Zlexak was a Dragonspine Rapier that <b>Choupie</b> got.
<br>
<br>
Neeeeeeeeeeeeext!
<br>
<img src=http://home.worldonline.dk/~kingri/Sevalak&CekenarCorpse.jpg>
<br>
Sevalak and Cekenar died so fast we didnt even get time to loot the corpses. Loot from Cekenar was nice, and <b>Controle</b> now walks around with a Silver Dagger of Destruction. Break his mezz and he WILL kill you. <b>Kimmers</b> also picked up a Blackstar, Mace of Night. Sevalak's loot was horrible, as always. We forced <b>Chwing</b> to loot the Axe of Resistance, and <b>Moonwalker</b> had a gun put to his head and was forced to loot the <b>Shield of the Dawn</b>.
<br>
<br>
Neeeeeeeeeeeeext!
<br>
<img src=http://home.worldonline.dk/~kingri/LadyMirenillaCorpse2.jpg>
<br>
Lady Mirenilla drops, was as always very nice. <b>Sick</b> now walks around with an Orb of the Crimson Bull, and <b>Vipsindsyg the Loothoe</b> ninjalooted some Mithril Gauntlets. Damn Vip!
<br>
<br>

Neeeeeeext!
<br>

<img src=http://home.worldonline.dk/~kingri/LordKoi'DokenCorpse.jpg>
<br>
This little fishy never made it to sea, <b>Areilsinger</b> ninjalooted a Trident of the Deep Sea and <b>Bumelor</b> was awarded a Orb of the Deep Sea.
<br>
More grats to <b>Dinadmera</b> and <B>Doublethread</b> who both got a Shield of the Dragonkind from the named drakes tonight :)
<br>
<br>
At this stage, we looked at our watches, 5:15am... Time to call it a night. Big congrats to <b>Fatal</b> who fell asleep at the spot, so she couldnt get a port out. Several hours later she trained PoM entrance and got her ass kicked by an angry flower. 
<br>
<br>
The night before, we had been in Veeshan's Peak, and Phara Dar died to 30 guildmates. Loot was a Crown of Rile that was awarded to <b>Amarnia</b> and three Claws of Phara Dar that I think all decayed.
