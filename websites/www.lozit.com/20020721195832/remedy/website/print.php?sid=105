    KAPOW! We've been in Ssra some more recently, having fun ganking snakes here and there. We killed all the triggers for glyphed and was awaiting him when we met his PH instead. This guy is a fun fight, definitely. The AE certainly is different, but we still put him down easy.<br><br><center><img src=http://home.worldonline.dk/~kingri/Screenshots/Karla/Runecoveredfight.jpg></center><br><br>My only rant is they wont even give this placeholder that is arguably harder than quite a few dragons some spells as loot. If just he had a chance of dropping greater remove curse, it would be worth ganking him. Ah well, atleast there was Exiled. After our failed shot the other day we owed him a good beat down. He asked, we delivered.<br><br><center><img src=http://home.worldonline.dk/~kingri/Screenshots/Karla/ExiledCorpse.jpg></center><br><br>Remedy, being the monk friendly guild that we are LOVE seeing monk loot. Especially monk weapons. Oh yeeees. That's great. Thombo picked up<br><br><center><img src=http://home.worldonline.dk/~kingri/Screenshots/Karla/Fistofmithril.jpg></center><br><br>...and Silverx ninjalooted this:<br><br><center><img src=http://home.worldonline.dk/~kingri/Screenshots/Karla/scepterofparalysis.jpg></center><br><br>We found Eashen up a few days ago also, and headed to ToV. It's fascinating how the letters "N ToV" can bring on the rarest people, something that should be studied in detail. We had some lesser difficulties with him, incredibly. We wiped the first time cause his room felt like tagging along, and the 2nd time because the big drakes repopped and started Chealing. No fun! Third time's the charm and he died. Here's your dead pic, yeah we did win!<br><br><center><img src=http://home.worldonline.dk/~kingri/Screenshots/Karla/Eashen.jpg></center><br><br>Actually, third time we charmed all the little drakes and used them to tank him while we sat back with Pina Colada's and played strip poker. Larcenciel lost. What a surprise!?!?!?...<br><br><br><b>Bernie adventure of the day!</b><br><br><img src=http://arena.tribalwar.com/face/wtc/10.jpg><br><br>~Arbaal<br><br>
