    Hi!
<br>
So what have we been doing today you ask? Good question! Well, Luclin came out for all the Americans yesterday, while we are still eagerly awaiting our own here in Europe, so we decided to go back to ToV to take out some of our agressions on the denizens there. And so we did! We started out the night with Ikatiar the Venom.
<br>
<br>

<br>
He died. Loot was two Ancient Wyvern Hide Tunics that was awarded to <B> Fuffalo</b> and <b>Moster</b>. He also dropped a Mask of Venom that <b>Leandred</b> was given.
<br>
<br>
We decided to do things a little differently this time, and moved to a different spot to fight our dear Eashen of the Sky. The pull didnt go as well as planned, and we ended up with 3 of his guards also. We got our act together and killed it. Result:

<br>
Loots was two Cloak of the Sky's that were given to <b>Pilate</b> and <b>Doublethread Evilhealers</b> who immediately tested if /q still was working. It was. He also dropped a Fist of Lightning, that <B>Fuffalo the rapper</b> got. He is a bad boy for life.
<br>
<br>
On to Aaryonar, things with him didnt go quite as well as it normally goes, and we wiped out. After a quick rebuff session and respawn clearing, we were ready to go again. Result: [Insert screenshot of dead dragon here that was ninjalooted before I got a chance to take a screenshot]
<br>
<br>
Loot was a Katana of Pain which <b>Areilsinger Yoholahihisamurai</b> ninjalooted, a Hand of the Master that <b>Chwing Gum</b> happily cut off and Mask of Fall that <b>Cutepai Armypig</b> ninja'd. Cutepai is in the Navy now, so all you horny boys out there can direct your tells to <B>Rinderwahn</b> meanwhile.
<br>
<br>
A quick CoH and we were ready to kill again. We pulled Jorlleag, who died easily and put out some Silver Chains that was awarded to <b>Utar</b> and <b>Martrim "I'm no slut" Heatstone</b>. Well what do you know, good loot dropping in two's all for the third time! <b>Pilate</b> also picked up a Facesmasher, if you try to move in on his Ragefire camp, it's on your own risk.

Next up was the lovely Lady Nevederia, we love her so. She reminds me of one of those Bus drivers that just cant stop passing gas and laughing about it as the whole bus full of passengers cough for air. She had to go:

<br>
<br>
Loot was nice, <b>Ghazaki</b> got her Left Eye, <b>Nisse Pisse</b> got a Mask of Terror and <b>Larcensongyy Colorwolf</b> got a Medal of Deep Thought.
<br>
<br>
Alright, things are going good, it's early yet and we have loads of more killing to do. Next inc? Zlexak ofcourse! Hoshkar's father came, saw, and got his ass put out on a plate. Loot? A super duper Spinning Orb of Confusion! Our first one to drop I might add, so who got it you might ask? I dont know! All of a sudden I got the "You have been disconnected" screen. Ah well, it happens. I press the Enter World button, and I log in. No Zlexak corpse. What happened here? Apparently the zone crashed, and the Orb was lost. Great :(
<br>
On the "bright" side, the whole zone had repopped. Everything we had killed was up again... Hmmm ok, Jorlleag INC! Loots: More Silver Chains, these <b>Aleja</b> picked up, and some Onyx Chain Leggings for <b>Nisse!</b>.
<br>
<br>
Lady Nevederia INC! Loots: Cloak of Thorns for <b>Joklun</b>, a Medal of Deep Thought for <b>Pilate</b> and a Girdle of Dark Power for <b>Zzijah</b>. Phat loots so far, so why stop here?
<br>
<br>
Zlexak INC! Loots: Twenkens Slippers of Silence for <b>Klytus</b>, and a Dragonspine rapier for <b>Sembyen</b>, Silverx's twink.
<br>
<br>
Cekenar INC! Loots: Silver Dagger of Destruction. This dagger went to a very deserving <b>Caladar</b>, grats Cal :) He also dropped two dragon meats that Rinderwahn hastily devoured, while screaming that he loves eating kittens.
<br>
<br>
Sevalak INC! Loots: A Shield of Midnight. Wow, very nice Shadowknight shield. Who got it? Grats <b>Fuffalo</b>!. Yep that's right, no one needed. Sevalak always surprises me at the quality of loot he drops, but this is too bad. GG Verant. /bird

<br>
<br>
At this stage, we decided to call it a night. There was a patch in 7 hours anyway, and it was late so why not... It was good today tho, 25 loots altho two were wasted.
<br>
<br>
<br>
<b>Bernie adventure of the day!</b>
