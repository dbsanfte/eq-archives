    To start off, I would like to be a whiny bitch for a few moments. Verant can throw all the annoying monk weapons at us, no problem, they can throw all the shitty cleric weapons at us, no problem, but when Kael crashes while we have King Tormax at 1%, well down past enrage, running for his sorry ass, then I want to bitch. Ofcourse, we log back in to a few mobs who we had cleared that had repopped, and check his throne. Empty. GG Verant.<br><br>Alright, I'm done being a whiner now, we've actually had a few good days. We ganked Xerkizh The Creator for the first time, was a pretty cool fight. Had several big LD's, but we took him down anyway. Here's a little shot of him.<br><br><img src=http://home.worldonline.dk/~kingri/Screenshots/EverQuest%20Screenshots/Xerkizh%20the%20Creator.JPG><br><br>Yeah, that's monk loot in his shiny little hand.<br><br><img src=http://home.worldonline.dk/~kingri/Screenshots/EverQuest%20Screenshots/Xerkizh%20Loot.JPG><br><br>Jmich looted the uber monk weapon, which is actually pretty cool. Too bad he never gets to fight cause he's always busy pulling. Tanatloc picked up this little range slot item, grats him!<br><br><img src=http://home.worldonline.dk/~kingri/Screenshots/EverQuest%20Screenshots/Shiny%20Trinket%20of%20Speed.JPG><br><br>Oh yeah, I had a little fun also.<br><br><img src=http://home.worldonline.dk/~kingri/Screenshots/EverQuest%20Screenshots/Xerkizh%20Ding.JPG><br><br>We moved down to the basement afterwards, and surprisingly, we actually got the glyphed instead of his PH. He had to go. Pilate picked up the Cleric loot.<br><br><img src=http://home.worldonline.dk/~kingri/Screenshots/EverQuest%20Screenshots/glyphed.JPG><br><br>Our buddy the exiled popped afterwards, we was promptly given a beatdown. He dropped the exact same thing as last time we ganked him... a twink was given the monk weapon and a guest the necro scepter. Whee.<br><br><img src=http://home.worldonline.dk/~kingri/Screenshots/EverQuest%20Screenshots/Exiled%20Corpse.JPG><br><br>We've found Lord Yelinak up a few times also, now personally, I like Yelinak. It's a fun fight, not completely trivial, but has enough of a margin for error to make some "interesting" fights occur. We had some pretty cool ones, and amazingly didnt see one shitty pal/sk weapon in both kills.<br><br><img src=http://home.worldonline.dk/~kingri/Screenshots/EverQuest%20Screenshots/Yelinakdead.JPG><br><br>Ailly and myself picked up a head each, and Chwing and Hratli got a sleepers key.<br><br><b>The fool world of Rtyui</b><br><br><img src=http://home.worldonline.dk/~kingri/Screenshots/EverQuest%20Screenshots/Rtyui%20Tash%20Karekgogo.JPG><br><br><img src=http://home.worldonline.dk/~kingri/Screenshots/EverQuest%20Screenshots/Rtyui%20Brainfuck.JPG><br><br><br><b>Larcenciel, the donkeyrider.</b><br><br><img src=http://home.worldonline.dk/~kingri/Screenshots/EverQuest%20Screenshots/Larcenciel%20gay%20ass.JPG><br><br><img src=http://home.worldonline.dk/~kingri/Screenshots/EverQuest%20Screenshots/Larcengay.JPG><br><br><img src=http://home.worldonline.dk/~kingri/Screenshots/EverQuest%20Screenshots/Larcenciel%20love%20Jmich.JPG><br><br><img src=http://home.worldonline.dk/~kingri/Screenshots/EverQuest%20Screenshots/Larcenciel%20gay%20Ghat.JPG><br><br><img src=http://home.worldonline.dk/~kingri/Screenshots/Renser/Larcenciel.jpg><br><br><br><b>Inspect message of the day</b><br><br><img src=http://home.worldonline.dk/~kingri/Screenshots/Renser/Carriestin.jpg><br><br><br><b>Verant grammar of the day</b><br><br><img src=http://home.worldonline.dk/~kingri/Screenshots/EverQuest%20Screenshots/caputured%20thought%20leech.JPG><br><br><br><br><b>Bernie adventure of the day!</b><br><br><img src=http://www.warpedlight.com/~mox/bernieball.jpg><br><br>~Arbaal<br><br>
