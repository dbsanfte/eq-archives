    When this patch ended, we were gonna clear Sleepers Tomb for some primals, but something was wrong... Something was very wrong. The sentry inside saw through invis, and the text that is displayed inside was that which it used to be back...in august of last year. Okaaay.... So we get 20 people in there and start clearing down, hoping that perhaps Verant decided to put Sleeper back in his bubble or perhaps make him spawn like other mobs instead of being dynamic. All of a sudden a GM pops in and /kill's the Warders and sleeper and leaves without a word. Would have been nice if he had atleast explained what was going on. I feel sorry for any bastard that has to get his ST key and run invis down to FA instead of fighting down there and beating up some warders.<br><br>What else is new? Oh yeah, the whines of certain uberguilds finally paid off, and the Creator of Free Loot was upgraded. So we went up there and killed him. Here's your obligatory phat lewts screenshot:<br><center><img src=http://amm-electronics.net/remedy/Creator/newcreatorloot.JPG><br>Yeah, that's right. He now has THREE loots, and not only has alot of his old loots been upgraded but he also got some new ones also. Like this earring for example:<br><img src=http://amm-electronics.net/remedy/Creator/earring.JPG><br>We also killed the old Creator a few days before and picked up another Hategiver.<br><img src=http://amm-electronics.net/remedy/Creator/oldcreatorloot.JPG><br><br></center><br>We've also been a trip to North ToV again for some free loots. I'd post screenshots of the loots, but really, take 24 people up there and see for yourself. We also found Tormax up and smacked him down pretty fast. Thought Horror Overfiend and Grieg Veneficus also took the ticket to bind spot. We also did another Ringwar for Rogger, but the stupid Seneshal ate the head and ring... Great stuff Verant. Here's the phat lewts, in case anyone cares.<br><br><center><img src=http://amm-electronics.net/remedy/Creator/tho.JPG><img src=http://amm-electronics.net/remedy/Creator/kingt.JPG><img src=http://amm-electronics.net/remedy/Creator/grieg.JPG><br><br><br></center>To finish off, I'd like to pay special tribute to our friend, The Avatar of Suckass. He whopped our ass again, and we're getting more and more bitter. Anyway, here's a picture of him tearing us up.<br><br><center><img src=http://amm-electronics.net/remedy/Creator/aow.JPG></center><br><br><br><center><b>Today's guildmember RL pic: Silverx and Rtyui in downtown Taiwan</b><br><br><img src=http://www.fatchicksinpartyhats.com/images/fathat333.jpg></center><br><br><br>~Arbaal<br><br>
