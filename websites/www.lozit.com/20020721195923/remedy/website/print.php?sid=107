    While sitting at inzone of icewell factioning, Hratli noticed Dain popped. Being the chicken I was I asked him to find out what version of the dain it was. He was however, concerned about how to find it out and get his corpse afterwards. He asks me for invis, about 30 seconds pass... I notice a dent in his HP... He spams with "DONT GO NEAR ME PLZ U WILL DIED!" ... I notice the little dwarf rampaging... look up... Who comes running? Hratli with a beautyful solo pulled Dain. Hratli's DA wears off, he goes down. And what happens next had me spilling coke all over myself. Some poor newbie ogre that wanted some armor got PLOWED down by Dain... Not just beaten down, but literally plowed down. Reminds me in the old days of the server when some level 12 gnome magician would get plowed down by a sand giant in oasis. Instant KO. The way Dain just made one hitting movement and the ogre went down... Beautyful, just beautyful. Anyway, we came back a few hours later and killed Dain. Grats to Polish on the head.<br><br><img src=http://home.worldonline.dk/~kingri/Screenshots/10%20March/Dain.jpg><br><br><br>We've been over in the new Cazic Thule also, having some fun. It's almost like back in the old Rubicite days, there's just as many trains made by fool newbies. Speaking of trains...<br><br><img src=http://home.worldonline.dk/~kingri/Screenshots/10%20March/FoolSilverx.JPG><br><br><br>I awoke from my long slumber a weary morning to find that the Final Avatar had popped infront of me. We had begun getting some ST keys for newer members and wanted to get them some primals. I gotta say this zone stinks. I feel sorry for all the guilds out there who now have to farm the huge cake golems for their primals, it really was a privaledge to be able to fight the warders. To make it down to the bubble for the first time... Not to mention the 20 minute fights in the library with 5-6 gargoyles constantly gating then coming back with even more. Now it's just a invis run down there and BANG smack your nerfed golem for your primal. Or... in our case, a copy of Cannibalize 4.<br><br><img src=http://home.worldonline.dk/~kingri/Screenshots/10%20March/Final%20Avatar.JPG><img src=http://home.worldonline.dk/~kingri/Screenshots/10%20March/FA%20Loot.JPG><br><br><br><b>Flykick of the day</b><br><br><img src=http://home.worldonline.dk/~kingri/Screenshots/10%20March/Flykick.JPG><br><br><br><b>Baga fool biatch Rtyui</b><br><br><img src=http://home.worldonline.dk/~kingri/Screenshots/10%20March/Rtyui1.JPG><br><br><img src=http://home.worldonline.dk/~kingri/Screenshots/10%20March/Rtyui2.JPG><br><br><img src=http://home.worldonline.dk/~kingri/Screenshots/10%20March/Rtyui3.JPG><br><br><img src=http://home.worldonline.dk/~kingri/Screenshots/10%20March/Rtyui5.JPG><br><br><img src=http://home.worldonline.dk/~kingri/Screenshots/10%20March/Rtyui6.JPG><br><br><img src=http://home.worldonline.dk/~kingri/Screenshots/10%20March/Rtyui7.JPG><br><br><img src=http://home.worldonline.dk/~kingri/Screenshots/10%20March/Vipsindsyg.JPG><br><br><img src=http://home.worldonline.dk/~kingri/Screenshots/10%20March/Rtyui8.JPG><br><br><img src=http://home.worldonline.dk/~kingri/Screenshots/10%20March/Rtyuifool.JPG><br><br><img src=http://home.worldonline.dk/~kingri/Screenshots/10%20March/Rtyuifool2.JPG><br><br><br><b>Bernie adventure of the day</b><br><br><img src=http://arena.tribalwar.com/face/wtc/1.jpg><br><br>~Arbaal<br><br>
