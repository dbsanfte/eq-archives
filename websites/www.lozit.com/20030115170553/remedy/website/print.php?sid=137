Mithaniel Marr died at our hands on our first try today, and what a goddam fight it was. Truly awesome, hardcore and good fun. We had pretty much absolutely no clue what we were in for, and got our ass handed to us on a silver platter, but in the end it was his corpse that fell...in the wall, hence the lack of corpse screenshot. Damn, this fight was fun, and we are eagerly looking forward to slaying him many more times. Here's the load he packed.<br><br><center><img src=http://www.amm-electronics.net/remedy/torment/mithloot1.JPG><img src=http://www.amm-electronics.net/remedy/torment/mithloot2.JPG></center><br>Huge congratulations goes out to <b>Decay</b> on the Bow of Contortion, and the druid weapon also went to <b>Decay</b> along with 10 other druid loots each month cause we have no druids that play. Congrats, decay!<br><br>Now, this is where it gets fun. To get to Mith Marr, you gotta fight through another three bosses. Each of these three are probably as hard or even harder than anything else we've seen so far in PoP. Take a look at the loads they packed though!<br><br><img src=http://www.amm-electronics.net/remedy/torment/frogknight.JPG><br><br><img src=http://www.amm-electronics.net/remedy/torment/edium.JPG><br><br><img src=http://www.amm-electronics.net/remedy/torment/halon.JPG><br><br><br>Ok, I lied. It didn't get fun. Hey, Halon, where's my fucking Hero meat? I'm sure the food Karynna could make from it would be more useful than the duplicate spell we'd get from the scroll. Ah well, these fights were fun too, in a masochistic kinda way, but hey that's just us! I mean, we guildinvite Vipsindsyg and have put up with him for over a year... There has to be some masochists in us.<br><br>Seriously, to try to let you know how I feel about this loot, or rather, lack of it, I must tell a little story that you can compare it with. Ok, here goes. It's a perfectly normal day, some people are waiting at the bus stop. A guy that's wearing a full body dog costume comes strolling down the pavement and stands at the bus stop like any other person. A minute or so passes and another guy in a dog costume comes walking along. He sees the first guy and absolutely beats the shit out of him, then moves on to a tree, takes a piss, and continues walking away. Now, how I feel is probably how those people standing at the bus stop would feel. Take a moment and put yourself in the place of one of the people watching. How would you feel? What would you think? Ok then...<br><br>We also did some more HoH trials. While they're not really hard, they sure were damn fun. Not so much because of the events themselves, but because of the fact that we walked into each of them with absolultely no clue what was coming next and had to adapt to them. I'm sure any guild that can get past Aerin´Dar and who have a spoiler for them can beat them on first try, but without spoilers it is a damn good challenge and very fun to learn. I was very proud of my guildmates who came back each time for more until we beat the last one. Here's some corpses and some loot.<br><br><center><img src=http://www.amm-electronics.net/remedy/torment/ryddacorpse.JPG><br><img src=http://www.amm-electronics.net/remedy/torment/crazed1.JPG><br><img src=http://www.amm-electronics.net/remedy/torment/ogre.JPG><br><img src=http://www.amm-electronics.net/remedy/torment/crazed2.JPG></center><br><br><br>That's not all though, we've been busy little bees in Crypt of Decay also. We have been killing <b>Overlord Banord Paffa</b> (dont ask me why, I dunno), <b>Carprin Deatharn</b> and this guy...<br><center><img src=http://www.amm-electronics.net/remedy/torment/highpriest.JPG></center><br>I didnt get any loot shots, because the corpse was ninja'd too fast. God bless droppable loot that's worse than stuff you can buy in the Bazaar. But take my word for it, he's dead and we got flags for Bertoxxolus. Alright?<br><br>Since our Terris Thule kill, we've been playing around in Torment some also. I've gotta say, that this is the coolest looking zone to date. I was like... <a href=http://www.y2khai.com/khai06.html>wow</a> when I saw and explored it. Infact, it was so wow that I had to take alot of screenshots of stuff to post here or I wouldnt feel good about myself and maybe have to die or something. Excuse the gamma, as usual my screenshots are alot darker than when I actually play the game.<br><br><center><a href="http://www.amm-electronics.net/remedy/torment/torment1.JPG"><img src="http://www.amm-electronics.net/remedy/torment/torment1small.JPG"></a><a href="http://www.amm-electronics.net/remedy/torment/torment2.JPG"><img src="http://www.amm-electronics.net/remedy/torment/torment2small.JPG"></a><a href="http://www.amm-electronics.net/remedy/torment/torment3.JPG"><img src="http://www.amm-electronics.net/remedy/torment/torment3small.JPG"></a><a href="http://www.amm-electronics.net/remedy/torment/torment4.JPG"><img src="http://www.amm-electronics.net/remedy/torment/torment4small.JPG"></a><a href="http://www.amm-electronics.net/remedy/torment/torment5.JPG"><img src="http://www.amm-electronics.net/remedy/torment/torment5small.JPG"></a><a href="http://www.amm-electronics.net/remedy/torment/torment6.JPG"><img src="http://www.amm-electronics.net/remedy/torment/torment6small.JPG"></a><br><a href="http://www.amm-electronics.net/remedy/torment/torment7.JPG"><img src="http://www.amm-electronics.net/remedy/torment/torment7small.JPG"></a><a href="http://www.amm-electronics.net/remedy/torment/torment8.JPG"><img src="http://www.amm-electronics.net/remedy/torment/torment8small.JPG"></a><a href="http://www.amm-electronics.net/remedy/torment/torment9.JPG"><img src="http://www.amm-electronics.net/remedy/torment/torment9small.JPG"></a><a href="http://www.amm-electronics.net/remedy/torment/torment10.JPG"><img src="http://www.amm-electronics.net/remedy/torment/torment10small.JPG"></a><a href="http://www.amm-electronics.net/remedy/torment/torment11.JPG"><img src="http://www.amm-electronics.net/remedy/torment/torment11small.JPG"></a><a href="http://www.amm-electronics.net/remedy/torment/torment12.JPG"><img src="http://www.amm-electronics.net/remedy/torment/torment12small.JPG"></a></center><br><br>I didnt manage to get too far, let's blame...keys. Yes, that's good. You need a key for every footstep you take in here. But damn, is this zone cool or what... These pictures will only give you a small idea of how cool it really is. The downside about this place is it isnt really worth exping in. The mobs are clustered and wide apart from eachother, and while I'm sure it could be fun here, 99% of people would be more interested in going some place like HoH or CoD for their exp... Or maybe even PoValor.<br><br>That gimp zone which is now filled with 40 people more than there is actually room for during the 24 hours of the day. Out of the 70 people that inhabit the zone every day, 69 of them are gimps who spent hours in line for the Execution trial, instead of growing a nutsack and trying one of the other five trials that all apart from one arent really any harder than execution. You can tell that it's the gimps that previously inhabited Velketors and Sebilis while Luclin was out, and their frostbringers and lamentations are gleaming in the crystal desert as they spout endless amounts of crap at eachother in ooc. I am very thankful that in this expansion there are lots and lots of zones that these people will never enter. Wow, reading over what I just wrote, damn I'm an asshole. Cool!<br><br><br><br><center><img src=http://www.amm-electronics.net/remedy/torment/recruit.JPG></center>Ladies and gentlemen. I'd like to make a few note on our recruiting as we get alot of questions and blabla. We are currently active seeking the following classes;<br>
<b>- Cleric<br>
- Druid<br>
- Bard</b><br><br>Do you love raiding? Do you love doing new things? Do you play actively from 8pm CET to after midnight? Are you a fun person? Can your mother vouch for you that you wont ebay our remaining SoD's? If you can say yes to all these things, Remedy might just be the guild for you.<br><br>Remedy is always recruiting, so just because you're not one of the above three classes, doesnt mean you don't stand a chance. If you're a hardcore diehard son of Rambo who is ready to make a difference, take initiative, have the capability of self-thought and dont leave your common sense behind when you press "Enter World", we might just be the guild for you too. <br><br>Regarding cross server transfers, you too are also welcome to apply. Pretty much every single European hardcore player knows and feels the pains of being in a US based raiding guild. That is why we welcome cross server applicants also. While we do have both Americans and Asians (whom we all love) in the guild, we are a European based guild and welcome more Euros. However, the recruiting process wont be any different for you because you moved over here. There are no special rules, and just because you move over does not mean you are guaranteed a guildinvite. But if you are a hardcore player, a nice person and enjoy working with many others towards a common goal, by all means, apply. Having lots of AA points is a good bonus also. The "Joining Remedy" section is like.. years old and havent been updated so go to our forum, ignore the stuff Leandred posted and send tell to the appropriate officer. This here is the truest statement as far as our recruiting goes:<br><br><b>We are looking for friends, not mercenaries. Join to have fun. Join to experience the thrill of defeating a new monster or overcoming a new challenge. Join to be with your friends. Whatever your reasons, do NOT join for loot because you'll probably be wasting your ( and our ) time.</b><br><br><br><br>Enough of that, onto the loots! Another Aerin´Dar and Aten Ha Ra produced this loot!<br><br><center><img src=http://www.amm-electronics.net/remedy/torment/aerincorpse.JPG><br><br><img src=http://www.amm-electronics.net/remedy/torment/atenloot.JPG><br><img src=http://www.amm-electronics.net/remedy/torment/atenlegs.JPG><img src=http://www.amm-electronics.net/remedy/torment/atenmask.JPG><br>Six goddam Breastplates out of 8 kills... /sigh<br><br><br><br><br></center><b>Hilarious quotes by Rtyui, and some other people that try to be funny</b><br><br><img src=http://www.amm-electronics.net/remedy/torment/cutepai.GIF><br><br><img src=http://www.amm-electronics.net/remedy/torment/hratli.GIF><br><br><img src=http://www.amm-electronics.net/remedy/torment/hratli2.GIF><br><br><img src=http://www.amm-electronics.net/remedy/torment/hratli3.GIF><br><br><img src=http://www.amm-electronics.net/remedy/torment/hratli4.GIF><br><br><img src=http://www.amm-electronics.net/remedy/torment/larcenciel.GIF><br><br><img src=http://www.amm-electronics.net/remedy/torment/larcenciel2.GIF><br><br><img src=http://www.amm-electronics.net/remedy/torment/larcenciel3.GIF><br><br><img src=http://www.amm-electronics.net/remedy/torment/larcenciel4.GIF><br><br><img src=http://www.amm-electronics.net/remedy/torment/leandred.GIF><br><br><img src=http://www.amm-electronics.net/remedy/torment/nisse.GIF><br><br><img src=http://www.amm-electronics.net/remedy/torment/rinderwahn.GIF><br><br><img src=http://www.amm-electronics.net/remedy/torment/rtyui.GIF><br><br><img src=http://www.amm-electronics.net/remedy/torment/rtyui2.GIF><br><br><img src=http://www.amm-electronics.net/remedy/torment/rtyui3.GIF><br><br><img src=http://www.amm-electronics.net/remedy/torment/rtyui4.GIF><br><br><img src=http://www.amm-electronics.net/remedy/torment/rtyui5.GIF><br><br><img src=http://www.amm-electronics.net/remedy/torment/rtyui6.GIF><br><br><img src=http://www.amm-electronics.net/remedy/torment/rtyui7.GIF><br><br><img src=http://www.amm-electronics.net/remedy/torment/rtyui8.GIF><br><br><img src=http://www.amm-electronics.net/remedy/torment/rtyui9.GIF><br><br><img src=http://www.amm-electronics.net/remedy/torment/rtyui10.GIF><br><br><img src=http://www.amm-electronics.net/remedy/torment/rtyui11.GIF><br><br><img src=http://www.amm-electronics.net/remedy/torment/rtyui12.GIF><br><br><img src=http://www.amm-electronics.net/remedy/torment/silverx.GIF><br><br><img src=http://www.amm-electronics.net/remedy/torment/silverx2.GIF><br><br><img src=http://www.amm-electronics.net/remedy/torment/silverx3.GIF><br><br><img src=http://www.amm-electronics.net/remedy/torment/simana.GIF><br><br><img src=http://www.amm-electronics.net/remedy/torment/uahaa.GIF><br><br><img src=http://www.amm-electronics.net/remedy/torment/vipsindsyg.GIF><br><br><img src=http://www.amm-electronics.net/remedy/torment/vipsindsyg2.GIF><br><br><br><br><b>~Arbaal</b><br><br>
