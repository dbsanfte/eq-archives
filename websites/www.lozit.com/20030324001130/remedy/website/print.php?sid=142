    <center><h1><b>Stuff DEAD!</b></h1><br><br><h2>OMFG!</h2><br><br></center><br><br><br>As you know, we dropped Rallos Zek some time ago. The beauty of that event was that even though you screwed it up, good old Decorin Grunhork and Berik would be waiting for you as soon as you hauled your ass up there again. Now for the lesser beauty. We had a few pop shots at Bertoxxulous sometime around the end of November or thereabous. We managed to drop him down to 16% with a crew of 40 flawless jiggs™, but alas, after that he was forever lost to the swarms of taiwanese guilds. Until recently that is. Hallelujah brother, rejoice! Our friends over in Kylin Eyes allowed us a shot at him, just one shot, on the condition that we left up Rallos Zek for them sometime. We gracefully accepted this deal, and moved to Ruins of Lxanvom where we started dispatching stuff. Guess who popped in a little over an hour later? Our old buddy Bertoxxulous. The porn sites of the web lost alot of hits, as we all tabbed back in and smacked him through the wall like Jane Fonda in a strip club.<br><br><br><center><img src=http://www.amm-electronics.net/remedy/Bertoxx/bertoxxcorpse.JPG><br><br><br></center>With Bertoxxulous finally out of the way, all we really needed now was to get another Mithaniel Marr under the belt, as we had gotten quite a few new recruits since the last few times we dropped him. Oh and the slackers (Vipsindsyg) needed the flag too. The proof God loves Europe! Patch day! A quick Rydda´Dar and then off to the Temple of Marr. Result?<br><br><br><center><img src=http://www.amm-electronics.net/remedy/Bertoxx/mithmarrcorpse.JPG><br><br><b>Pappa's first ever corpse shot of Mithaniel!!!</b></center><br><br><br>With that out of the way, and alot of people flagged for Elementals, we sat down and thought long and hard about what else we wanted to get done before leaving the world behind and diving into the huge poo pile that is the elemental planes. One thing sprang to our collective minds! Vulak! Yes! Yes! We checked the ring, all good, completely clear. My God, the other guilds actually managed to kill Vyemm for once too! Off we headed to ToV, no Guardian Spirits were up. While we were buffing up outside, well what do you know? A Guardian Spirit popped. Yay! There was no dragons up whatsoever, and really, we didnt feel like waiting 3 hours for the respective lord/lady to pop so off we went.<br><br> A week later, once again, we went to ToV. Vyemm was up, ofcourse (Don't ask me why, he's almost as trivial as the other dumb dragons). We killed him and headed in and started the ring! Well goddamn I'll say. As you're aware, they fixed the serverfilter about 2 patches ago, so being in there with regular ping instead of 13,000 which was normal back then was simply amazing. It was a piece of cake. Not the shitty cake you get at the bakers, but the real good stuff granny makes. After 3 hours of no challenge whatsoever, guess who dropped by:<br><br><br><center><img src=http://www.amm-electronics.net/remedy/Bertoxx/vulak1.JPG><br><br><img src=http://www.amm-electronics.net/remedy/Bertoxx/vulak2.JPG><br><br><img src=http://www.amm-electronics.net/remedy/Bertoxx/vulak3.JPG></center><br><br><br>Well, we've been in the elementals now for a few days, and havnt really had any notable numbers on with flags. But that doesnt stop us from trying new stuff. It's mainly been late night stuff with numbers between 20 and 25 people. Actually, I think the most we've had on was 26. With that extremely large raidforce, we dropped the feared Hydrotha and pulled in some extremely good loot. I'll say this, what a goddamn good fight it was with that little number. Yeah, he's pretty much a walkover with a normal raidforce, but damn it was good with that few.<br><br><img src=http://www.amm-electronics.net/remedy/Bertoxx/hydrothacorpse.JPG><br><br><br>While running around Plane of Air, we actually completely accidently triggered this guy. While unprepared, we still put this guy down<br><br><img src=http://www.amm-electronics.net/remedy/Bertoxx/warlordcorpse.JPG><br><br><br>We also met this guy by accident... While prepping for Balthazar the Cursed or whatever he's called, this guy just spawned on us. What a wierd wierd fight...<br><br><img src=http://www.amm-electronics.net/remedy/Bertoxx/chamberlaincorpse.JPG><br><br><br>We also played around in Tower of Solusek Ro. Feels damn good still raiding on at 6am in the morning with a crew of 20 people that just wanna kill stuff... Even despite of <a href=http://www.amm-electronics.net/remedy/Bertoxx/gate.JPG><b>this</b></a> it was still a complete blast. Anyway, we killed these.<br><br><img src=http://www.amm-electronics.net/remedy/Bertoxx/xuzlcorpse.JPG><br><img src=http://www.amm-electronics.net/remedy/Bertoxx/hratli4.GIF><br><i>No, Hratli.
