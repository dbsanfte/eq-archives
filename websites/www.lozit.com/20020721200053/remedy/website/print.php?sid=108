    We have been getting some ST keys lately, so we figured we'd go try get some newer members some primal. The way I feel about this. . . Well, it's like disneyland turned into texas. A big dissapointment every single time. We ganked the golems and got this:<br><br><center><img src=http://home.worldonline.dk/~kingri/Screenshots/March%2013th/Motg%20loot.jpg><img src=http://home.worldonline.dk/~kingri/Screenshots/March%2013th/Prog%20loot.jpg><img src=http://home.worldonline.dk/~kingri/Screenshots/March%2013th/TFA%20loot.jpg></center><br><br>Not too bad actually, could have been worse. Balgoth picked up his Primal Avatar off Motg finally, after having one decay on him like. . .many months back. Chwing picked up the two handed primal and Vipsindsyg the Warsword. Here's what Rtyui had to say about it:<br><br><img src=http://home.worldonline.dk/~kingri/Screenshots/March%2013th/Rtyuicongvipprimal.jpg><br><br>Dinadmera recently had his Warmasters Ribcage poof on him, for some reason, and Vinshayr gave one of the usual 500 hour "quests" to give it back to him. Rtyui, being the excellent flamer that he is had this comment:<br><br><img src=http://home.worldonline.dk/~kingri/Screenshots/March%2013th/Rtyui1.jpg><br><br>Expect a thread in Rants & Flames soon . . .<br><br><br>In other news, we've had some diarrea going around today, I'm sure I caught Nisse saying something too, but I was probably too dumb to press the screenshot button.<br><br><img src=http://home.worldonline.dk/~kingri/Screenshots/March%2013th/Diarrea1.jpg><br><br><img src=http://home.worldonline.dk/~kingri/Screenshots/March%2013th/Diarrea2.jpg><br><br><img src=http://home.worldonline.dk/~kingri/Screenshots/March%2013th/Diarrea3.jpg><br><br><br> Oh yeah, and we ganked Sontalak for the first time in a few months also. I love that fight. Fast and furious, and 10 times as fun when he is ping ponging all over the place. Rtyui got the ST key.<br><br><img src=http://home.worldonline.dk/~kingri/Screenshots/March%2013th/Sontalak.jpg><br><br><br><b>Bernie adventure of the day!</b><br><br><img src=http://arena.tribalwar.com/face/wtc/3.jpg><br><br>~Arbaal<br><br>
