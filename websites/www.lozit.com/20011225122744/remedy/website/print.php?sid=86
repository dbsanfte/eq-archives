    Today was another good day, following up from yesterday. Sure things could have gone way better, but all in all we did good. Things started off easy, Jorlleag was first to die.
<br>
<br>

<br>
<br>
He dropped some more Silver Chains for <b>Rtyui Sleepig</b>, a Helm of the Crawler for <b>Karekgogo</b>, who now looks scarier than Meryl Streep in Bridges of Madison County, and a Facesmasher for <b>Doublethread</b>.
<br>
<br>
Good start, next up for a beatdown was Lady Nevederia. Has anyone solved that quest about her three children yet? Oh well, here's the killshot:
<br>

<br>
<br>
Loot was ... different... today, <b>Chwing</b> and <b>Choupie</b> recieved her horns and <b>Martrim</b> got a Medal of Deep Thought.
<br>
<br>
Zlexak, our old buddy who had poofed on us last night with a Spinning Orb of Confusion made his comeback yet again today. He got a good start and some people died, but we quickly turned it around and the result was this:
<br>
<br>

<br>
<br>
Guess what the loot was? Another Spinning Orb of Confusion, which <b>Lowi</b> quickly ninjalooted before the server crashed again.
<br>
<br>
The next fight was insane... Our super pullers somehow managed to get Sevalak solo, and we were fully prepared but something went horribly wrong. People were dying left and right, he was tearing through us... It was an unreal fight, words cannot even explain it. After a long long fight, which must have lasted atleast 30 mins we managed to turn the tide with massive rez-zerg tactics. I dont know how we pulled it off, but in the end we were victorious. Loot? A Shield of Midnight that <b>Pilate</b> ninjalooted. Grats bank slot 5!
<br>

<br>
<br>
On top of that huge fight, we quickly managed to rebuff, regroup and pull Cekenar within the next 5 mins. He went down without a fight, infact, I dont think he even bothers trying anymore. Loot was a Frosted Ice Spike for <b>Choupie</b>.
<br>

<br>
<br>
So the top of ToV was clear, we pulled out our CoH'ers and moved down a bit. Within long Eashen of the Sky was pulled, but the room added for some reason we couldnt figure out (/cough bad monks) and we actually wiped out on him. What a sad sad day. After a quick rez/buff session, everyone was ready and we ressed the monks who got to work and this time brought Eashen with just one guard. No problem, we killed them both almost flawlessly. Loot was a Bracelet of the Sky for <b>Sterne</b> and Onyx Chain Sleeves for <b>Dinadmera</b>.

It was getting late. Very late. Some people was falling asleep, and some pressed the wrong hotkeys. Like Grook. /hug
<br>

<br>
<br>
Next up for a smackdown, was ofcourse the badass Aaryonar. What can I say, this fight went down without a single flaw except for a few laggers who died to enrage at the end. Loot was a Amulet of the Dreadgazer to <b>Silverx Balanec</b> and a Rocksmasher to <b>Kaio Weedwar</b>.
<br>
<br>

<br>
<br>
It was really late now, we were down to 26 people. What the hell, who are we to give up? Lord Feshlak INC! Very hardcore fight, but everyone did very very well and in the end:
<br>
<br>

<br>
<br>
Loot was a Chestplate of Fiery Might to <b>Zzijah</b>, a Sky Watchers Monolith to <b>Doublethread</b> and an Amulet of the Storm that was given to our guest <b>Ciladar</b>.
<br>
<br>
We moved to another camp and pulled Lord Kreizenn. The pullers brought him and one of his pets, which we quickly disposed off, and after a long long fight, Lord Kreizenn wiped us out. Ah well, we are getting good at this rez/buff thing. We cleared some repops and began pulling again. Lord Kreizenn was pulled, a good long fight unfolded and in the end we nailed him to the ground. Loots was a Silver Disc which went to <b>Fat Al</b>, and a Dawncaller, Blade of Morning and Ancient Fire Etched Flamberge which both went to some happy Destroy buttons. Oh, and Kreizenn's guard dropped a Shaman shield which sadly decayed.

About a month or two ago, I started a poll on the Dragons Clans board, regarding who is the God of Gay. That poll can be found <a href=http://pub41.ezboard.com/fdragonsclanstnfrm10.showMessage?topicID=18.topic>here</a href>
<br>
<br>
I have new evidence which supports that <b>Larcenciel</b> indeed is the God of Gay. Just look at this:
<br>
<br>

<br>
<br>
Please, Ladies and Gentlemen, I beg of you, click the link and vote for Larcenciel.
