Well, I'll say this... I thought we got away from 30 minute fights last expansion, but I guess I was wrong. But it was 30 minutes of <b>ACTION PACKED FUN™</b>. Well actually, it wasnt too bad. With our whopping zerg force of 38 guildmates and 4 guests, we took him down with only 2 casualties on first try.<br><br><center><img src=http://www.amm-electronics.net/remedy/bumbum/agnarrcorpse.JPG></center><br><br>We've been putting Mithaniel Marr to shame also. When I think of him, the image of a little mexican boy called Pepe eating catfood in the gutter comes to mind. Little Pepe has a problem though, he doesnt seem to want to put out any useful goddam loot. I mean, considering the effort required to kill him, it really well, kinda blows.<br><br><center><img src=http://www.amm-electronics.net/remedy/bumbum/mithmarr.JPG><br><img src=http://www.amm-electronics.net/remedy/bumbum/mithmarrcorpse.JPG></center><br><br>Ohya, I finally got a corpse shot of him. Somewhat, anyway. I love my icons, I really do. I can't see any of the new ones, so everything looks like a cloth choker. Ohya, while we're at the pepe subject, I would like to thank Halon of Marr. He finally put out some loot of mentionably quality. I refer you to my previous update if you're in doubt of what I mean.<br><br><img src=http://www.amm-electronics.net/remedy/bumbum/halonofmarrloot.JPG><br><br><br><br><br><center><img src=http://www.vicksburg.com/~ghudson/pig.gif><br><b>The fat biatch.pig.rtyui competition</b></center><br><br>That's right folks, it's the fat biatch.pig.rtyui competition! For the next few weeks, I will be accepting screenshots of people who can imitate the asian genious. Pretend you are him, send me a tell with some complete utter bullshit just like he does! The best one will recieve a one night stand with any boy from Arbaal's young asian slave boy market. That's right! All you have to do to win this prize is imitate the great pig himself. That's ;tell nameless.arbaal for you cross server rtyui-wannabes. Bonus points for creativity.<br><br><br><br><br>We managed to get a shot at Bob today also, which was quite pleasent. Too bad we're averaging 40 people per raid, but hey you have to do with what you have, aye? We had taken one stab at it before, but got completely wasted cause someone ran and pulled ~20 extra mobs while we were fighting kings, but today we managed to get to the big kahuna himself. Needless to say, we wiped bigtime. We learned alot of stuff though, and he'll be going down next time for sure. Very very fun event.<br><img src=http://www.amm-electronics.net/remedy/bumbum/bertoxx.JPG><br><br><br><br><br><b>Thought for the day</b><br><br>This little thought goes out mainly to those of you in heavy raiding guilds. I'm sure you've all noticed the type of people that do really well as an applicant, but then when they get the guildinvite they vanish or become the rare spawn of the week. What's up with those people? I mean, they come to pretty much every damn raid every damn day, and every damn exp group or key camps etc while they're on recruiting, then when the golden day comes, and they get the guildinvite, they're gone! It makes absolutely no sense. Once they get the guildinvite they start earning points to get loot for also, so why after that time dissapear?<br><br>Now, you tell me. Conspiracy or Alien abduction? Now, you can call me crazy but I think we're onto something here. We are a pretty well established European based guild, could it be that this is China's way of holding us back to weaken us before their impending invasion? Or could it be that it is the marsians way of holding us back to weaken us before THEIR invasion? Nah, I dont think so. I just think it's assholes. Here's a little note to all of you out there who fit into this category from me and probably most of the other high end community; Stop wasting your, and more importantly, our time. Go away.<br><center><img src=http://tvtotal.prosieben.de/imperia/md/images/tv-total/web/downloads/fotos/2002/kw14/12.jpg></center><br><br><br><br><br>Oh yeah, here's some new loot we've gotten from around the place in PoP. Some good, some bad, some downright nasty.<center><br><br><img src=http://www.amm-electronics.net/remedy/bumbum/blackcloak.JPG><img src=http://www.amm-electronics.net/remedy/bumbum/carvedbonering.JPG><br><img src=http://www.amm-electronics.net/remedy/bumbum/greatstaffofthefourwinds.JPG><img src=http://www.amm-electronics.net/remedy/bumbum/guardcaptainsfaceguard.JPG><br><img src=http://www.amm-electronics.net/remedy/bumbum/platoonleaderspauldrons.JPG><img src=http://www.amm-electronics.net/remedy/bumbum/staffofswiftness.JPG><br><img src=http://www.amm-electronics.net/remedy/bumbum/wandoftheicestorm.JPG><img src=http://www.amm-electronics.net/remedy/bumbum/wardersornatebroadsword.JPG><br><img src=http://www.amm-electronics.net/remedy/bumbum/wickedshank.JPG><br><br><br><br><b>These people bring the funnay</b></center><br><br><img src=http://www.amm-electronics.net/remedy/bumbum/ailly.GIF><br><br><img src=http://www.amm-electronics.net/remedy/bumbum/cringer.GIF><br><br><img src=http://www.amm-electronics.net/remedy/bumbum/emmgel.GIF><br><br><img src=http://www.amm-electronics.net/remedy/bumbum/hratli.GIF><br><br><img src=http://www.amm-electronics.net/remedy/bumbum/hratli2.GIF><br><br><img src=http://www.amm-electronics.net/remedy/bumbum/hratli3.GIF><br><br><img src=http://www.amm-electronics.net/remedy/bumbum/hratli4.GIF><br><br><img src=http://www.amm-electronics.net/remedy/bumbum/hratli5.GIF><br><br><img src=http://www.amm-electronics.net/remedy/bumbum/hratli6.GIF><br><br><img src=http://www.amm-electronics.net/remedy/bumbum/lasam.GIF><br><br><img src=http://www.amm-electronics.net/remedy/bumbum/leandred.GIF><br><br><img src=http://www.amm-electronics.net/remedy/bumbum/rinderwahn.GIF><br><br><img src=http://www.amm-electronics.net/remedy/bumbum/rogger.GIF><br><br><img src=http://www.amm-electronics.net/remedy/bumbum/rtyui.GIF><br><br><img src=http://www.amm-electronics.net/remedy/bumbum/rtyui2.GIF><br><br><img src=http://www.amm-electronics.net/remedy/bumbum/rtyui3.GIF><br><br><img src=http://www.amm-electronics.net/remedy/bumbum/rtyui4.GIF><br><br><img src=http://www.amm-electronics.net/remedy/bumbum/rtyui6.GIF><br><br><img src=http://www.amm-electronics.net/remedy/bumbum/rtyui7.GIF><br><br><img src=http://www.amm-electronics.net/remedy/bumbum/rtyui8.GIF><br><br><img src=http://www.amm-electronics.net/remedy/bumbum/rtyui9.GIF><br><br><img src=http://www.amm-electronics.net/remedy/bumbum/rtyui10.GIF><br><br><img src=http://www.amm-electronics.net/remedy/bumbum/silverx.GIF><br><br><img src=http://www.amm-electronics.net/remedy/bumbum/silverx2.GIF><br><br><img src=http://www.amm-electronics.net/remedy/bumbum/silverx3.GIF><br><br><br><b>~Arbaal</b><br><br>
