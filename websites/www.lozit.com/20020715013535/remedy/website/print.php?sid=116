That guy knows how to kick ass... That was an insane fight! We came so incredibly close, but at the end we lost... If we hadnt lost some clerics at the start and had some conflicts about the tank order we definately would have taken him down. Was a great fight by everyone, and everyone did their best. He's as good as dead next time. Goddam, I'm lost for words here...<br><br>What else have we been doing? Well, we've gotten a load of Emperor keys... Boring timesink, but atleast the key is a decent ring. But this is what is taking the time...<br><img src=http://remedy.amm-electronics.net/Avatarofwar/ore.JPG><br>...dumbass ore. Gogo Verant, another brilliant idea. Couldnt you atleast have made the ore the common drop and the useless piece of crap loots that are almost all worthless the rare drops? And what the hell is up with the rarity of the Lucid Shards anyway?! Screw bane weapons, we'll pull an Ascent and smoke the Emperor with damage shields. Fat chance... Expect more whining on my part about the rarity of ore/shards.<br><br><br>Please take your clothes off, clap your hands together and humm a welcome chant to Rtyui, who has joined the ranks of TEAM MO FISH as the alias Pigger.<br><img src=http://remedy.amm-electronics.net/Avatarofwar/pigger.JPG><br><br><br>Oh yeah, we did a Ringwar too. Our first actually. That was quite a blast, big thanks to all the local people of GD that helped out. Can't say it got even close to losing, but it did get hectic sometimes and was fun just about all the time. Grats to Moster on the Ring.<br><br><img src=http://remedy.amm-electronics.net/Avatarofwar/ringwar.JPG><br><br><br>We also put the little stupid Dain to rest. I'm really getting tired of this fight. No, it's not the pull, no it's not the clearing, no it's not the fact that Hratli is constantly spamming with "DONT KILL MY BRO PLZ!!!"... It's those stupid faction leechers. They jump down in the well and just stand there. You ask them nicely to leave, what do they do? Stand there and look like dumbassess. If I ever see Angelet or Lililililili charmed, be sure to see a huge manaburn going right up the rear end of them. Here's your complementary Dain loot, partially ninjalooted by Nisse.<br><br><img src=http://remedy.amm-electronics.net/Avatarofwar/dainloot.JPG><br><br><br>Oh yeah, and I would like to congratulate Uaellaen, Eternelle and Zinja on getting level 60. They all worked very hard on it during the last few weeks and finally there's no more slackerlevellers on the roster!<br><br><b>Quotes of the day!</b><br><br><img src=http://remedy.amm-electronics.net/Avatarofwar/rtyui.JPG><br><br><img src=http://remedy.amm-electronics.net/Avatarofwar/hratli.JPG><br><br><b>Guildmate RL pic of the day: Tannys</b><br><br><img src=http://fatchicksinpartyhats.com/images/fathat342.jpg><br><br>~Arbaal<br><br>
