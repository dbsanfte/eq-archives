    G'morning everyone, sorry for slacking lately. Having problem getting rid of virus on my brand new system and waiting for the stupid company to deliver ADSL at home so I've been slacking lately. Highlight of the month would be Larcenciel revealing that his oxlong is big and he burns for some warm man buttock.
<br>
<br>Stuff has died, and we managed to get a shot at the glyphed. He went down quicker than Rinderwahn on a creamfilled donut. Here's your dead snake pic.

<br><br>
Now, this COULD be any snake, you might say, but look close. See that pal/sk sword? Belive me now?
<br><br>
We also took the time to gank Lord Yelinak. Last time we killed him was back in September, so we figured it was time to kill him again. Chwing got head!! Chwing got head! Oh, this page is SO sexual.<br><br><img src=http://home.worldonline.dk/~kingri/Screenshots/Eqpics/Yelinak.jpg><br><br>
While on the subject of sex, we also killed Cazic Thule. Hratli got a brain, yes, you read it. BRAIN! They must have increased the drop rate, because another guild on the nameless got it a few days ago also. Here's a pic of the dead god of poo.<br><br><img src=http://home.worldonline.dk/~kingri/Screenshots/Eqpics/CazicThule.jpg><br><br>Vindicator died a few times, Stygiana, our newest shaman member needed a breastplate. Despite our monks somehow amazingly getting the Idol of Zek on the Vindi pull, he died. Tormax and Dain took the ticket to freeport also. What can I say? They were up, we needed something to kill.<br><br> We also took a quick pop at the "new" N ToV, and put down Aaryonar, Eashen, Feshlak and Dagarn easy. The "new" Lendiniara the Keeper died too. Can they make this dragon any easier??
