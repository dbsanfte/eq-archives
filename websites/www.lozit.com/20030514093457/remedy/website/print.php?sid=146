    <b><center><h1>Remedy moving to Maelin Starpyre!</h1></center></b><br><br><br>

It's been a long long road. Back in January 2001 when a guild called Eye of the Ages split up, the players made two new guilds. The US players formed Shock of Swords and the European players formed Remedy. Now, over two years later Shock of Swords has long since died but Remedy is still here. And what amazing two years it has been. We've seen friends come and go. We've had ups and downs, but we are still here and stronger than ever before. The will and determination to improve, do better and conquer has pushed us far and wide. Here are a few of my favorite moments...<center><br><br><img src=http://www.amm-electronics.net/remedy/remedy/tovgroup.JPG><br><br>First ToV dragon we killed, at Telkorenar...<br><br><br><img src=http://www.amm-electronics.net/remedy/remedy/vulakgroup.JPG><br><br>Our first Vulak kill, at 7am in the morning with 27 or so people... That was pure magic.<br><br><br><img src=http://www.amm-electronics.net/remedy/remedy/atengroup.JPG><br><br>Our first Aten Ha Ra kill... While killing her was no more difficult (or fun) than smashing Roseanne Barr into the ground with a giant sledgehammer while screaming obsceneties at her in japanese at the top of your lungs, it was still a nice milestone.<br><br><br><img src=http://www.amm-electronics.net/remedy/remedy/fenningroup.JPG><br><br>The most recent victory.</center><br><br><br> All these fights, and so so so many more all amount to what Remedy is all about; victory through teamwork. The last two years have been good, and we have had alot of fun on The Nameless server, but now it is time to move on. As of Tuesday March 11th, Remedy is officially moving to Maelin Starpyre. We are eagerly looking forward to meeting our friends over at <a href=http://www.crimsontempest.com>Crimson Tempest</a> and the other guilds that are moving over on the Maelin Starpyre server and are looking forward to some good and friendly competition.<br><br><br>On behalf of everyone in Remedy, I would thank everyone on The Nameless server for sharing it with us these past years. It's been great fun, and we wish you all the best of luck.<br><br>As per usual, we will be recruiting. See the post in our public forum for official details regarding how you can become a recruit, or scroll two updates down to see my personal view.<br><br><br><br>Now that the formalities are over, let's talk business.<center><br><br><img src=http://www.amm-electronics.net/remedy/remedy/pinkchwing.JPG><br><br></center>The game was great. Planes of Power was by far the best expansion to date, in my opinion, despite slackers fucking up with flags and causing whole guilds to backtrack. Everything was good, everyone was happy, we even fed Silverx. Enter Legacy of Ykesha and the above statement of blatant homosexuality. Before you're even reading this, yes, you probably already thought to yourself; "This guy must be French". I can now confirm your fears, yes he is. <b>However</b> being French is no fucking excuse for dying your armor pink! No, it is not! <br><br>Lots of other fudgepacking 'cool guys' have dyed their armor all manners of strange combinations. While a few of the color combinations can arouse even heroes like Chuck Norris, most of them manage to do nothing except bring forth the erections of the WWF wrestlers. Not fucking cool. Just say no!<br><br>Don't even get me started on the whole froglok thing, now what the fuck is that. Does nobody out there have even two shreds of originality in them? It's kinda like when The Fellowship of the Ring came out, every retard and their mother immediately called their twink something that resembeled "Legolas". Now, everyone's 'big mean green' frog twink is called something that's close to "Frooak", "Kermit", "Froggy" or the incredibly absurdly more-retarded-than-Don-King-gayesque name "Reedip". If I had a bullet for my grandfather's old Luger from the war for everytime I saw one of those names around, I'd have been put in my grave for genocide a long long time ago.<b> Just say no!</b><br><br><br>Oh yeah, I said business, not whining...
