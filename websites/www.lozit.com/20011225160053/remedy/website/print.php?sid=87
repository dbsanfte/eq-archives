Today we killed Dragons, and a bunch of them too. We had a really late start, and amazingly managed to die to Eashen of the Sky again. Our excuse was that we only had 27 people on, but so what? Nah, actually, it was a flawless fight until our maintanks defensive ran out and died. The second tank was LD at this stage and the third and last warrior died faster than Kolienu can loot. This, ofcourse, cannot be good. He had to go.

Loot was  a Twisted Bastard Steel Sword for <b>Fatal</b> and Twisted Steel Gauntlets that went to <b>Leandred</b>. After the kill we were gonna pull Aaryonar's pets, but things wasnt going our way... He came also. After a slow CR, we tried again, and once again, he came. Ok, enough on that... We had several people logging, it was past midnight. We CoH'd up to backdragons and did them in a slightly unusual order. Jorlleag, Zlexak, Sevalak, Cekenar and Lady Nevederia. Here's your killshots to prove we arent lying Euro trash.
