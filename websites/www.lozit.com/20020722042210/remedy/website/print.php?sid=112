We were looking for something to kill last night, and found Sheik Abdullah up. We just love trying new stuff, so we headed over to Akheva and headed up to him. What happened next was just screwed up. To sum it up, at one stage we had ten mobs, some of which had the same name, beating on us. Rather, beating us up. Pretending to not be the whiny wusses we really are, we picked up our torn off nutsacks and went at it again. Well, we got our ass handed to us, but we learned alot. It was late, we did CR and left. Next time he's toast.<br><br><br>We also killed Xerkizh the Creator again, this time he dropped uberloot. Well, one uberloot anyway.<br><br><center><img src=http://home.worldonline.dk/~kingri/Screenshots/Polse/Hate/creatorloot.jpg></center><br><img src=http://home.worldonline.dk/~kingri/Screenshots/Polse/Hate/hategiver.jpg><img src=http://home.worldonline.dk/~kingri/Screenshots/Polse/Hate/cudgel.jpg><br><br>Grats to Karekgogo on the Hategiver. pfft. As if he wasnt provocative enough already...<br><br><br><b>Skyl some baga flykick today o_O</b><br><br><img src=http://home.worldonline.dk/~kingri/Screenshots/Polse/Hate/skylpic.jpg><br><br>We brought along our new cheerleader also, this is what he had to say<br><br><img src=http://home.worldonline.dk/~kingri/Screenshots/Polse/Hate/quaestorium.jpg><br><br><br>Hope you enjoyed the Bernies, cause they're history. After escaping from the WTC before the plane hit, he was gunned down by the luggage handlers at the Tanzania international airport for smuggling crack cocaine. So at the request of some people, we're going to make fun of Vipsindsyg and Larcenciel instead. <br><br><b><b>Fat person of the day!</b><br><br><img src=http://www.fatchicksinpartyhats.com/images/fathat286.jpg><br><br></b>~Arbaal<br><br>
