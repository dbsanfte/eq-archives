<H2> Club Passing - Notation </H2>

Throughout this document on club passing I make use of the notation described in this section.<P>

In general all patterns are listed in table form. An example is given below for a two person, 3-count
pattern.<P>

<table border=3>
<tr> <td> <b> Passers </b> </td>
     <td> <b> 1 </b> </td>
     <td> <b> 2 </b> </td>
     <td> <b> 3 </b> </td>
     <td> <b> 4 </b> </td>
     <td> <b> 5 </b> </td>
     <td> <b> 6 </b> </td>
     <td> <b> ... </b> </td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td><b>Passer A</b></td>
  <td>RP</td><td>ls</td><td>rs</td>
  <td>LP</td><td>rs</td><td>ls</td><td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td><b>Passer B</b></td>
  <td>RP</td><td>ls</td><td>rs</td>
  <td>LP</td><td>rs</td><td>ls</td><td>...</td>
</tr>
</table>
<p>

Each row of the table shows the passes performed by one of the passers. The first column lists
the passers in the pattern (Or the name of the pattern/trick if only one row is present).
Each subsequent column represents one beat of the pattern, and in this column we list the
type of throw the person for that row performs. The pattern is assumed to repeat from the
end although in some cases more than one cycle of the pattern is shown.<p>

Several different types of information can be used to represent one throw or beat of the pattern. The
<a href="#table">table</a> at the end of this section describes the elements that can be used to
describe one throw.<P>

When both passers do the same thing, as above, only one of the passers needs to be shown:<p>

<table border=3>
<tr>
  <td><b>3-count</b></td>
  <td>RP</td><td>ls</td><td>rs</td>
  <td>LP</td><td>rs</td><td>ls</td>
</tr>
</table>
<p>

All self throws (including handoffs) are written in lower case to place emphasis on the
passes that are done.<p>

When more than two passers are involved, each pass is in the form:<p>

<b>[passer]-[pass]-[receiver]</b><p>

For example<p>

A-Rx2-F<p>

is a right to right handed crossing double from passer A to passer F.<p>

The first element is not used in a table format while the last element is only necessary
if there are more than two passers in the pattern.<p>

The definition of a pass is:<P>

<b>[hand][throw type][direction][# of spins]</b><p>

Where:<p>
hand is right (R) or left (L)<P>
throw type is pass (P), Dropback pass (K), self (S), hand off (H).<P>
direction is straight (|) or crossing (x).<P>
# of spins is single (1), double (2) etc.<P>

Each of these elements is optional, and if left out the default (as specified in the above
table) is used.<p>

In patterns such as 4-count or 2-count the left hand only does self throws. In these cases
we leave out the left hand to simplify things. Also in patterns involving multiple people
we often only show who the passes go to and not what hands are used or what timing is used.
For example a standard three person line feed is:<p>

<table border=3>
<tr>
  <td><b>A</b></td>
  <td>B</td><td>C</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td><b>B</b></td>
  <td>A</td><td>s</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td><b>C</b></td>
  <td>s</td><td>A</td>
</tr>
</table>
<p>

For patterns in which the passers physically move around (eg. rotating feed) the
pattern shape is shown above the passes so you can see how the position of the passers
relates to the passes that are being done.<p>

A hurry is used when someone throws a pass to you and it arrives earlier than normal so you have to
make a hurried throw. An example of where this is used is
