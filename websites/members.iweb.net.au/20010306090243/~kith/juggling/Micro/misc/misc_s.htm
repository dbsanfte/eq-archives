<H2>Introduction</H2>

This page describes random small object manipulation tricks. There are
currently tricks with cards, rubber bands and a few other tricks.<P>

<HR>
<A NAME="CardManipulation"></A>
<H2>Card Manipulation</H2>

By card manipulation I mean the manipulation of just one card like object
(playing card, credit card, buisness card etc). If you are interested in more
conventional card manpulation (ie manipulation of a standard deck of cards)
there are many good books on the subject.<P>

Many of the pencil and coin tricks can be performed with a card. Some of these
include <A HREF="pencil_s.htm#BehindTheHandTwirl">Behind The Hand Twirl</A>,
<A HREF="pencil_s.htm#Finger1Spin">Finger 1 Spin</A>,
<A HREF="pencil_s.htm#TwoFingerTwirl">Two Finger Twirl</A> and the
<A HREF="coin_s.htm#TwoFingerSwitch">Two Finger Switch</A> among others.<P>

<A NAME="CardSpin"></A>
<TABLE BORDER=1>
<TR class="green"><TD COLSPAN=2><CENTER>Card Spin</CENTER>

<TR><TD COLSPAN=2>
Just spin the card in the same manner as the <A HREF="coinm_s.htm#CoinSpin">
Coin Spin</A>. The card can be spun while holding the edges of the card or the
corners.
</TABLE><BR><BR>

<A NAME="ExtraSpin"></A>
<TABLE BORDER=1>
<TR class="green"><TD COLSPAN=2><CENTER>Extra Spin</CENTER>

<TR><TD COLSPAN=2>
If the card is long enough you can do an extra spin with finger 3.<P>

Note: Throughout this move the card is spun about its short axis.

<TR><TD><B>Start</B><TD>
Start with the card held by one of the long edges, near a corner.

<TR><TD><B>Description</B><TD>
<OL>
  <LI> Spin the card 180 degrees as normal. The card is now held with the thumb
       on one side and finger 1 and 2 on the other side.
  <LI> Finger 3 now grabs the card on the same side as the thumb, and finger 1
       and the thumb release the card.
  <LI> Continue the spin with fingers 2 and 3, until finger 1 can grab the
       card on the same side as finger 3.
  <LI> Finger 3 releases the card and you can return to the starting position
       from here. You will now be holding the other end of the card.
</OL>
</TABLE><BR><BR>

<A NAME="CardThrowing"></A>
<TABLE BORDER=1>
<TR class="green"><TD COLSPAN=2><CENTER>Card Throwing</CENTER>

<TR><TD COLSPAN=2>
There are many ways of throwing cards. They can be thrown long distances, with
great force, or so that they return to your hand like a boomerang. I won't
describe any of these methods beacuse I don't do them much, and they are
described better in many good books on the subject. These books are typically
found in magic shops, but you might also find one in a juggling shop.<P>
</TABLE><BR><BR>

<A NAME="HorizontalSpinContinuous"></A>
<TABLE BORDER=1>
<TR class="green"><TD COLSPAN=2><CENTER>Horizontal Spin, Continuous</CENTER>

<TR><TD COLSPAN=2>
This trick involves keeping the card spinning horizontally with the thumb and
first three fingers of one hand.

<TR><TD><B>Start</B><TD>
Hold a card between the thumb and fingers 1,2 and 3 of one hand. The thumb
should be placed at the center of one side of the card, while the fingers are
placed on the other side of the card.

<TR><TD><B>Description</B><TD>
Now spin the card clockwise (Assuming the thumb is on top) by alternately
pulling backwards on the card with finger 1 and pushing forwards with finger
3. Finger 2 remains mostly stationery during this trick.<P>

The thumb moves right and left in time with the above two moves.
</TABLE><BR><BR>

<A NAME="HorizontalSpinQuick"></A>
<TABLE BORDER=1>
<TR class="green"><TD COLSPAN=2><CENTER>Horizontal Spin, Quick</CENTER>

<TR><TD COLSPAN=2>
This trick involves making a card spin horizontally a few times with only a
small motion of the hand.

<TR><TD><B>Start</B><TD>
Start as for the previous method.

<TR><TD><B>Description</B><TD>
With a quick motion simultaneously push forwards with finger 3 and pull
backwards with finger2 to generate spin on the card. The grip on the top of the
card should be reduced so that the card can spin freely. The goal is to set the
card spinning with a minimum amount of movement with the hand, then keep the
hand still until the spin stops. I can get two rotations without any noticable
movement of the hand. It helps if the card you are spinning has a slippery
surface.
</TABLE><BR><BR>

<A NAME="LongAxisSpin"></A>
<TABLE BORDER=1>
<TR class="green"><TD COLSPAN=2><CENTER>Long Axis Spin</CENTER>

<TR><TD><B>Start</B><TD>
Hold the card with the thumb on the middle of one side of the card, and all
four fingers on the other side of the card.

<TR><TD><B>Description</B><TD>
<OL>
  <LI> Fingers 2 and 3 reach around to grab the card on the same side as the
       thumb.
  <LI> Release the card with the thumb and place it on the other side of the
       card. The card is now held with fingers 2 and 3 on one side and fingers
       1, 4 and the thumb on the other.
  <LI> Release the grip with fingers 1 and 4 and place them on the other side
       of the card. You should now be back at the starting position.
</OL>

<TR><TD><B>Comments</B><TD>
I find that I hold the card the the first knuckles of fingers 1 and 4.<P>
</TABLE><BR><BR>

<A NAME="PropellerSpin"></A>
<TABLE BORDER=1>
<TR class="green"><TD COLSPAN=2><CENTER>Propeller Spin</CENTER>

<TR><TD COLSPAN=2>
This is a fun trick I used to do as a kid.

<TR><TD><B>Start</B><TD>
Take a small square piece of paper and fold a small section of each edge
inwards. Place the middle of the paper against the index finger so that the
folded edges are facing outwards as shown in the following ascii diagram:<P>

<PRE>
  -|
   |======  <-Index finger
  -|
  ^
  Folded edges
</PRE>

<TR><TD><B>Description</B><TD>
Now run forwards, pushing against the paper with the index finger. If done
right the paper will spin on the end of the finger like a propellor.
</TABLE><BR><BR>

<A NAME="ShortAxisSpin"></A>
<TABLE BORDER=1>
<TR class="green"><TD COLSPAN=2><CENTER>Short Axis Spin</CENTER>

<TR><TD><B>Start</B><TD>
Hold the card edgewise with the inside edges of fingers 1 and 4 at the midpoint
of the longest edges.

<TR><TD><B>Description</B><TD>
Now rotate the card through 360 degrees by alternating pushing with the thumb
and pulling with fingers 2 and 3.

<A NAME="RubberBandManipulation"></A>
<H2>Rubber Band Manipulation</H2>

There are a few manipulation tricks that I know that can be done with rubber
bands.<P>

<A NAME="FingerWalk"></A>
<TABLE BORDER=1>
<TR class="green"><TD COLSPAN=2><CENTER>Finger Walk</CENTER>

<TR><TD><B>Start</B><TD>
Stretch a rubber band between finger 4 and the thumb.

<TR><TD><B>Description</B><TD>
Now insert finger 3 into the loop and remove finger 4. Continue with finger 2
and finger 1. Now reverse the moves to complete the walk.
</TABLE><BR><BR>

<A NAME="Flicking"></A>
<TABLE BORDER=1>
<TR class="green"><TD COLSPAN=2><CENTER>Flicking</CENTER>

<TR><TD COLSPAN=2>
Not really a manipulation trick but some cool ways to flick a rubber band. Use
these powers in self defence only!

<TR><TD><B>Description</B><TD>
<H3>Gun Flick</H3>
Hold out the a fist. Extend finger 1 and the thumb to make a "gun". Place one
end of a rubber band over the tip of finger 1. Stretch it behind the thumb and
down into the palm where it is held by finger 2. Point this "gun" at something
and release the band with finger 2. The band should fly of the hand towards
the target.<P>

<H3>Two Finger Flick</H3>
Stretch a rubber band between the thumb and finger 2. Point finger 2 at
something and release the grip with the thumb so that the band flies towards
the target.<P>

Now perform this flick so that the band flies straight up. As it falls down
catch it on an extended finger.
</TABLE><BR><BR>

<A NAME="RotatingWalk"></A>
<TABLE BORDER=1>
<TR class="green"><TD COLSPAN=2><CENTER>Rotating Walk</CENTER>

<TR><TD COLSPAN=2>
This is a more interesting version of the <B>Finger Walk</B>.

<TR><TD><B>Start</B><TD>
Extend both index fingers, point them towards each other and place the right
index finger over the left one. Stretch a rubber band between these fingers.

<TR><TD><B>Description</B><TD>
<OL>
  <LI>Rotate the fingers around each other through 360 degrees.
  <LI>Replace the left finger 1 with finger 2. Repeat Step 1.
  <LI>Replace finger 2 with finger 3. Repeat Step 1.
  <LI>Replace finger 3 with finger 4. Repeat Step 1.
  <LI>One more rotation and you can begin reversing the steps to get back to
      the start.
</OL>

<TR><TD><B>Comments</B><TD>
This feels pretty cool when done really fast.<P>
</TABLE><BR><BR>

<A NAME="RotatingWalkTwoHands"></A>
<TABLE BORDER=1>
<TR class="green"><TD COLSPAN=2><CENTER>Rotating Walk - Two Hands</CENTER>

<TR><TD COLSPAN=2>
The "walk" can be performed with either hand and an interesting variation is to
perform the walk on both hands at once by starting as above and performing
the following steps:<P>

<TR><TD><B>Start</B><TD>
Start as for the <B>Rotating Walk</A>.

<TR><TD><B>Description</B><TD>
<OL>
  <LI>Perform 180 degrees rotation while replacing left finger 1 with left
      finger 2.
  <LI>Perform 180 degrees rotation while replacing right finger 1 with right
      finger 2.
  <LI>Continue steps 1 and 2 replacing alternating left and right fingers on
      each 180 degree rotation until you get back to the start.
</OL>
</TABLE><BR><BR>

<A NAME="ThumbSpin"></A>
<TABLE BORDER=1>
<TR class="green"><TD COLSPAN=2><CENTER>Thumb Spin</CENTER>

<TR><TD><B>Start</B><TD>
Hold the hand out with the thumb pointing up and a rubber band stretched
between the thumb and finger 2. Make sure the band is on the very tip of
finger 2 and below the knuckle of the thumb.

<TR><TD><B>Description</B><TD>
Now push on both strands of the
band with finger 1 to form a triangle. Now release the band with finger 2 and
if done correctly the rubber band should be spinning rapidly around the thumb.
</TABLE><BR><BR>

<A NAME="Twists"></A>
<H3>Twists</H3>

These tricks involve twisting a rubber band with the fingers in various
ways.<P>

<A NAME="IndexTwist"></A>
<TABLE BORDER=1>
<TR class="green"><TD COLSPAN=2><CENTER>Index Twist</CENTER>

<TR><TD COLSPAN=2>
This is a simple move in which a rubber band is twisted with the index finger,
then the move is immediately reversed.

<TR><TD><B>Start</B><TD>
Extend a rubber band between the thumb and fingers 2 and 3 so that a triangle
is formed.

<TR><TD><B>Description</B><TD>
<OL>
  <LI>Insert finger 1 into the loop from the far side and remove the thumb.
      The band should now be stretched between fingers 1, 2 and three, but
      there is a twist between finger 1 and the other two fingers. Try to keep
      the same triangle shape.
  <LI>Insert the thumb into the loop of the band near fingers 2 and 3 and
      remove finger 1 to return to the starting position.
</OL>
</TABLE><BR><BR>

<A NAME="ThumbTwist"></A>
<TABLE BORDER=1>
<TR class="green"><TD COLSPAN=2><CENTER>Thumb Twist</CENTER>

<TR><TD COLSPAN=2>
This is a simple move in which the band is twisted with the fingers and thumb.

<TR><TD><B>Start</B><TD>
Extend a rubber band between the thumb and finger 3.

<TR><TD><B>Description</B><TD>
<OL>
  <LI>Insert finger 2 into the band from the far side and remove the thumb. The
      band should now be extended between finger 2 and finger 3 and have one
      twist in it.
  <LI>Insert the thumb into the top loop of the band (near finger 2) and remove
      finger 2.
  <LI>Insert finger 1 into the top loop of the band from the far side and
      remove the thumb. The band is now extended over finger 3 and finger 1 and
      has two twists.
  <LI>Insert the thumb into the bottom loop (near finger 3) and remove finger 1
      to remove the twists and return to the start.
</OL>

<H2>Misc</H2>

Random stuff that does not fit anywhere else.<P>

<A NAME="KeyRingFlip"></A>
<TABLE BORDER=1>
<TR class="green"><TD COLSPAN=2><CENTER>Key Ring Flip</CENTER>

<TR><TD COLSPAN=2>
This is a pretty simple move that requires a set of keys on a key ring.

<TR><TD><B>Start</B><TD>
Extend finger 1 and place the key ring on it, dangling the keys below.

<TR><TD><B>Description</B><TD>
Now flip the keys over finger 1 to land caught on top of the other three
fingers. Release the keys with these fingers to return ot the start position.
Repeat until you get to the lock you need the keys for ;-)<P>

The reverse flip can also be done if the first was too easy!<P>
</TABLE><BR><BR>

<A NAME="Slinky"></A>
<TABLE BORDER=1>
<TR class="green"><TD COLSPAN=2><CENTER>Slinky</CENTER>

<TR><TD COLSPAN=2>
A slinky is one of those spring things that can walk down stairs on its
momentum. There are two tricks that can be done with one (apart from the stair
thing).<P>

<B>Hand Walk</B>:<BR>
Hold out the left, palm up, with the fingers pointing right. Place the slinky
on the left hand and use the right hand to grab the top of the slinky and pull
it down onto the right hand (which is placed slightly lower than the left. The
slinky should unfold out onto the right hand and continue turning over where
it can be caught on the left hand and so on.<P>

<B>Wave</B>:<BR>
Stretch the slinky out on a flat surface held between two hands. With the right
hand quickly push to the left so that a wave is formed, which will slide
through the slinky towards the left hand. As it reaches the left hand perform a
similiar move to reverse the waves direction.
</TABLE><BR><BR>

<A NAME="RingSpin"></A>
<TABLE BORDER=1>
<TR class="green"><TD COLSPAN=2><CENTER>Ring Spin</CENTER>

<TR><TD COLSPAN=2>
This trick involves spinning a ring around a finger.

<TR><TD><B>Start</B><TD>
For this trick you need a ring that has a knob of some kind (ie a Huge
Diamond!). I'll describe the trick assuming the ring is on finger 2 of the
right hand and the knob is facing up.

<TR><TD><B>Description</B><TD>
<OL>
  <LI>Place the thumb on the underside of the ring and pull it to the left so
      that the know move towards finger 3.
  <LI>Bring finger 3 up on top of the knob and pull the knob underneath the
      hand.
  <LI>Use the thumb to rotate the knob around to the left side of finger 2 and
      back to the starting position.
