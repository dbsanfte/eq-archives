<A NAME="Overview">
<H2>Overview</H2>

The Crypt of Dalnir is the resting place of the Haggle Baron, Dalnir. It is a mid level dungeon located within the Warsliks Woods.<P>

The entrance to the Crypt is at location (3490,3900). The easiest way to find the entrance, once in Warsliks Woods, is to head north until you reach the ocean. From there follow the coast east or west until the second coordinate reaches 3900. Now face south and head inland until the other coordinate matches. The entrance is a hole in the side of the hill facing the ocean and is quite difficult to find, even when standing next to it.<P>

The dungeon is suitable for levels 25 to 45. A full group of 25's may not get much further than Level 1 while level 45 characters will not be seriously challanged and will not get much experience.<P>

This guide and the maps are still very much in the draft stage. It will be updated as more information is discovered. The latest version of this guide can be found <a HREF="http://members.iweb.net.au/~kith/Dalnir.htm">here</A>.
Please send any corrections/additions to me at kith@iweb.net.au.<P>

<A NAME="Monsters">
<H2>Monsters</H2>

There are four types of monsters in the Crypt of Dalnir: Nibblers, Goos, Coerced and the Kly.<P>

<B>Ravenous Nibblers:</B> These flying fish creatures are pure melee and wander throughout the dungeon. They are level 25-28.<P>

<B>Goos:</B> There are two types of goos in the Crypt, gyrating goos and smoldering goos with the smoldering being the tougher of the two types.<P>
Both types of goos are straight melee mobs but they can proc <B>Goop Poison</B>, a 600 damage poison which does 33 damage per tick. With 21 poison resist I killed 30 goos and was poisoned 5 times. With 86 poison resist I was never poisoned.<P>

<B>Coerced:</B> There are many coerced races throughout the Crypt including gnomes, erudites, dwarves, iksar, tier`dal and goblins. Each coerced monster can be any of the classes including magicians, fighters, wizards, necromancers and shamans.<P>

<B>Kly:</B> The Kly look like Sarnak's and are only found in the lower two levels of the Crypt. There are six types of Kly. Kly Followers and Cohorts are warriors, Kly Evokers and Invokers are wizards and Kly Acolytes and Beleivers are shamans. For each class the second type of mob mentioned is the tougher of the two. Kly vary from 25 to 32 in level.<P>

I do not have accurate level information on the monsters in Dalnirs but they are somewhere in the 25-35 mark.<P>

When killed all mobs give negative faction with ThrallOfKly.<P>

Most of the monsters in the Crypt do not see invisible, with the exception of the Goos and the occasional coerced so moving from place to place and corpse recovery should be relatively easy. When invisible the monsters still "scowl at you". Either the con message is a bug or the fact that they do not attack is a bug. Lets hope for the former ;-)<P>

All monsters in the Crypt are on a 13 minute spawn cycle. There are many wanderers all throughout the zone and most of the time there are many mobs packed in close together which makes it fairly challenging. Also the large number of casters in this dungeon makes it more difficult than the level of the mobs might indicate.<P>

<B>Non-Aggro Mobs</B>: All types of mobs in the Crypt are KoS (Kill on Sight) to even level 51 characters but rarely both Ravenous Nibblers and Gyrating Goos can spawn in non-aggro mode. I have not seen any other type of mob do this. This is very handy when camping certain spots solo. this non-aggro feature works for at least level 40 characters. I do not know the lower level for them to be non-aggro.<P>

For example when I camped for my batons I was able to get 10 out of 13 mobs in the Loop/Pool area spawned as non aggro nibblers, leaving only the two lumpies and one wanderer for me to deal with.<P>

<A NAME="Maps">
<H2>Maps</H2>

This map is fairly accurate but the scale is off in places. Definately the best map of Dalnir I have ever drawn!<P>

<IMG SRC="dalnir.jpg" alt="Dalnir Map"><P>

<A NAME="Level1">
<H2>Level 1</H2>

The first level of the dungeon contains several small caves and the top level of the crypt. It contains all monster types but the Kly. There are many wanderers and some spawn right at the zone point so take care if resting there.<P>

<B>1 - Cave:</B> This cave contains the entrance to the main crypt at the eastern end. Also near the north wall of this cave you can find the first journal entry, <A HREF="#Day47">Day 47.</A><P>

<B>2 - Dalnir's Tomb:</B> In the center of this room is Dalnir's Crypt. Climb onto this and jump down it to drop to Level 2. The drop is quite long and depending on weight you may take 200+ damage from the fall. Levitation is recomended for those without safe fall. No damage is taken if you have 180 Safe Fall (probably a lot lower is sufficient). The room you drop into contains many wanderers so invisibility is useful in assuring a safe arrival. There is no known way to return to Level 1 from Level 2 so make sure you are ready before taking the plunge.<P>

<A NAME="Level2">
<H2>Level 2</H2>

This level is where you first meet the Kly.<P>

<B>3 - Pool Room:</B> This is the chamber into which you will drop from Level 1, landing in the center of the pool to the west of the room. The entire room is patrolled by wanderers so it may be best to move on quickly unless you plan on setting up camp here.<P>

<B>4 - Checkerboard Room:</B> In the north section of the Pool Room is a set of stairs leading down and into this room. It is free of monsters and no wanderers enter this room so it is an ideal place to rest or set up camp. There is a catch though. The checkerboard pattern at the base of the stairs is a pit trap that takes you to level 3. It is possible to avoid the pit by keeping to the walls and not walking on the pattern. This pit is similiar to the previous one and levitation/invisibility are recommended. There is no know way to get from Level 3 to Level 2.<P>

<B>5 - Loop:</B> This series of caves contains several mobs two of which are placeholders for the <A HREF="#LGoo">Lumpy Goo</A>'s. There are two lumpies in this area, the <B>Rug Lumpy</B> spawns in a cave at the back which contains a fire and two rugs (marked <B>R</B>). The <B>Thistle Lumpy</B> spawns at the edge of the loop (marked <B>T</B>).<P>

<B>6 - Bedrooms:</B> In this set of rooms you can find the second journal entry, <A HREF="#Day48">Day 48</A>. I have not finished the map here but there are several rooms and passages.<P>

<B>7 - Exit, Stage Left:</B> There is a zone here that will take you outside the Crypt to Warsliks Woods. This is another nice place to camp due to the proximity of the zone.<P>

<B>8 - Imprecator Room:</B> In this room spawns the first <A HREF="#Imprecator">Kly Imprecator</A>. Also in this room can be found the <B>Kly Channeler</B> but he does not appear to drop anything.<P>

<A NAME="Level3">
<H2>Level 3</H2>

This is the final level of the crypt. It is broken into two sections, seperated by a one way secret door. The area into which you first drop is the "Blacksmith" area, and beyond the secret door lies the "Overseer" area.<P>

<B>9 - Crossroads:</B> This is where you drop into this level from Level 2. Wanderers pass through here frequently so be ready when dropping to here.<P>

<B>10 - Blacksmith Room:</B> In this room you will find 3 Kly and either the <A HREF="#Blacksmith">Undead Blacksmith</A> or the <A HREF="#CPKeeper">Coerced Penkeeper</A>. Also in this room you can find the third journal entry, <A HREF="#Day49">Day 49</A>.<P>

<B>11 - Coffin Room:</B> This room contains a coffin on the floor which has been removed from the wall. If you duck and walk into the red hole left behind you will pass through the secret door to the Overseer area. It is a one way trip so make sure you finish your buisness in this area before passing through.<P>

<B>12 - Church:</B> This large room is the church referred to in the journal entries. It contains 9 Kly.
A <A HREF="#Imprecator">Kly Imprecator</A> can also spawn in here.<P>

<B>13 - Pit Room:</B> The corridor just past the secret door is free of monsters and wanderers so this is a good place to rest before moving on. This room contains three Kly ready to pounce on unsuspecting adventurers.<P>

<B>14 - Stair Trap:</B> To the north of these crossroads a set of stairs is blocked by rubble. DO NOT attempt to find a way through this blocked passage because you will go through into a small chamber with no way out. A guide will have to free you if you cannot gate/port out.<P>

<B>15 - Crusader Room:</B> This small room contains a spawn point in the north-west corner. Several named mobs including a <A HREF="#CRev">Coerced Revanant</A>, a <A HREF="#CPKeeper">Coerced Penkeeper</A> and a <A HREF="#SCrusader">Spectral Crusader</A> can spawn here, along with normal Kly placeholders. The two coerced mobs will attack on sight but the crusader is indifferent. He is the ghost of Crusader Golin who is mentioned in the journal entries. He does not respond to a hail but will answer the following questions:

<UL>
  <LI>What is greenmist?
  <LI>What is the Grand Forge?
  <LI>What is the Visceral Dagger?
  <LI>Where is Crusader Golin?
</UL>

Also in this room you can find the fourth journal entry, <a HREF="#Day50">Day 50</A>.<P>

<B>16 - River:</B> There are several mobs found along this river but nothing of importance.<P>

<B>17 - Labarotaries:</B> To either side here are two laboratories. In the left one can spawn a <A HREF="#Imprecator">Kly Imprecator</A>.<P>

<B>18 - Forge Room:</B> This room initially contains two Kly. A short time after they are killed a Coerced Smith spawns. He cons indifferent and is KoS to the Kly. He responds to a hail and at least one question ("What is the Forge?"). This room also contains the Grand Forge, named "Always Works". So far the purpose of this forge is unknown but it is likely related to the many quests within the zone.<P>

<B>19 - Overseer Room:</B> The final room of the dungeon contains 6 Kly and at the far end the <A HREF="#Overseer">Kly Overseer</A>. Also in this room can spawn the <A HREF="#Imprecator">Kly Imprecator</A>. I have been told the Imprecator can also spawn in one of the laboratories nearby, the church on this level and somewhere on Level 2 (in the unmapped section).<P>
The Overseer is a level 36-37 mob and is very dangerous. When he gets low on health he will begin to constantly use a 500 direct damage ice based spell. He has wiped out many level 40+ parties that were unprepared. With magic and cold resistance buffs he is not too bad though.<BR>
The Overseer is a placeholder for another Kly, called simply "The Kly". He is even tougher than the Overseer and seems to be very rare.<P>

Directly behind the Kly Overseer is a small nook with a star printed on the floor. This is a teleporter that will return you to Warsliks Woods, next to the zone to the Crypt<P>

Also in this room you can find the fifth and last journal entry, <a HREF="#Day55">Day 55</A>.<P>

<A NAME="AppA">
<H2>Appendix A: Loot!</H2>

Like most of Kunark there seem to be two types of loot tables. Certain types of monsters can drop any item from a certain loot table. There are also the familiar "named" monsters which drop a common, uncommon and rare items.<P>

<B>Kly:</B> Kly can drop any item from the following list. It is currently uncomfirmed wether all types of Kly can drop all items of this list.<P>

<UL>
  <LI><B>Sarnak Emblazened Tabard:</B> AC 14 HP 10 SV magic 10 wt 6.0 MAGIC LORE.

</UL>

There is fairly good evidence that each piece of cresent drops of a particular type of Kly. The following list shows which Kly drop which cresent:<P>

Evoker: Cresent Slippers<BR>
Cohort: Cresent Gi<BR>
Acolyte: Cresent Arms<BR>
Invoker: Cresent Pants<BR>
Follower: Cresent Gloves<BR>
Believer: Cresent Headband<P>

If you find contradictory evidence to this let me know and I'll go back to the random Kly theory ;-)<P>

<A NAME="LGoo">
<B>Lumpy Goo:</B> There are two versions of the lumpy goo. The Rug Lumpy spawns near the fire and two rugs (marked <B>R</B>) and drops a skull, FS short sword and a note as its common drop. The Fighting Baton is its rare drop. If it is crushing rather than slashing it has the baton.<BR>
The Thistle Lumpy spawns in the first cave between the Pool room and the tunnels. It's common drop is an FS spear and it's rare is the practice sword. If it slashes then it has the sword (It may also have a thistle shield).<P>

<H3>Crusader Golin's Skull</H3>

The lumpies occasionally drop a punctured skull. When identified this comes up as Golins Skull. There is a quest originating in Cabilis that involves combining three crusader bones and his weapon in a coffin (The one described in the journal entries).

built into them as morturaries do. None of the<BR>
