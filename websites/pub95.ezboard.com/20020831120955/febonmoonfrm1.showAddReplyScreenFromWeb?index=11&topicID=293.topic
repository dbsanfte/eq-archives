I can understand why you wouldn't chat during active times (though during our camp of Guk there was literally nothing to do but talk for 15 minutes between PH spawns, but ok understood). As for what you ate, last time you shopped, etc.... you are right... most people could care less. After all, most of us come online to play the game everquest, and we are playing a character which has nothing to do with our real life selves (well maybe a little <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  ). Now it's not that we don't care about you, and the fact that several people posted in this thread asking you to stick with it so they could enjoy your company again should speak volumes. But this is still a game, and we like playing the game which takes us away from real life. <p><br><br><a href="http://eq.guildmagic.com/character.cfm?ID=127031" target="_blank"><img src="http://mywebpages.comcast.net/bhoward3/images/dadalan.jpg" height=85 width=468 alt="Dadalan Lyfrender" border=0></a></p><span class=m><i></i></span><hr size=1><span class=m> Posts: <b>602</b>  </span></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td colspan=2><table cellpadding=8 cellspacing=0 width=100%><tr><td nowrap width=20% valign=top><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub95.ezboard.com/bebonmoon.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=blackpointsorrowbladethistletongue>Blackpoint Sorrowblade Thistletongue</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/anim_1.gif" BORDER=0> </span><br> <span class=usertitle>Melee Elder</span><br> <BR><img src=http://ebonmoon.com/images/members/blackpoint.JPG WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top width=80% class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_thumbsdown.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: I don't understand where you are coming from Ninye.</span><br><span class=m><font color=#778899>Posted: 7/29/02 5:18:32 pm</font>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>   &nbsp;&nbsp;<a href=http://pub95.ezboard.com/febonmoonfrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=293.topic&index=12><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/ultimate/reply.gif border=0 width=20 height=20 alt="reply to this message" align=absmiddle></a>   <hr size=1> ~ looks up at the above posts before gathering her thoughts ... this is long winded ... sorry...<br>
<br>
<br>
Okay, so your keyboard skills aren't that great ... not going to shame you there ... some are better than others ...<br>
<br>
But, let me tell you a story Ninye ... and this has shocked a couple people but I'm going to let it out.<br>
<br>
Cendarien and I have never met each other and we live in total opposite ends of the United States.  Were not marriend in RL.  Not boyfriend / girlffriend in RL.  I know him by only one face .. and thats the digital representation of him in EQ.<br>
<br>
But, we weren't always this way - the tongue and cheek attitude we share - when i met him back when i was lv 12 in Butcherblock he was an arrogant ranger trying to get a group together - and for some reason we played at the same times ... i was rather new to the game and he showed me around - taking me to all the beautiful vistas in the game Unrest - Guk - PaW ... all the pretty ones <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
And then something happens over time to every EQ character when you begin to know them a lot better ... you humanize the character.<br>
<br>
I humanize Blackpoint and Whitepoint all the time... They are both a side of my personalty ... Black is my, well, bitchy side and White is that Calvin Kline side of me <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
But, Cendarien and I have developed into great friends - and we do care what we did over the weekend / what we ate / and if that guy in the corner of the mall was cute or not <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
If I were to compare everyone to books.  Simple things.  My book would be a huge novel and it would be open to the exact middle of it.<br>
<br>
When i first meet people in game - they get Black or White for face value ... only after that do you get to flip back into what makes my characters tick .. and for that matter me.  Then, 'I' let you flip ahead ... as far as making the effort to talk to you.<br>
<br>
I have made lots of friends in the guild.  Everyone is my friend.  Now, I can't group with everyone and send tells to everyone every day.  Some more successful than others.  I've tried w/ Belwolf.  I just get drunk replies back <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :rollin --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/roll.gif ALT=":rollin"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
In the end of all this ... &quot;WE&quot; want to be your friends - you only need to open &quot;YOUR&quot; book to us.<br>

<br>
well said black and id like to add my own experiences too to this.<br>
yah, everquest is a game. thats a blunt statement. but its a game in which what would be npc's in a normal game are instead controlled by a living person somewhere else in the world. so to call it a game isnt really a just comparison. it really is a world of its own, people socialize on it, meet, and do all sorts of activities to it and it is because of this effort we put into it that makes it a world. but in the end your only going to get out of it what you are willing to put into it. if your willing to put yourself out there and talk to that person that you felt you got along with in that last group, then things are gonna be good for ya, if you solo all the time and do solitary stuff then your never gonna broaden your horizons. i know i have made up a nice base of friends which i can, and usually am, talking to all the time. but what happens is then you stop hanging out with strangers and only with friends. sure thats fine but then what happens when a lot of friends leave, you lose people to talk to. then you get really bored of the game. so thats why you need to be constantly offering yourself to people and always working to make new friends cause that way youll always have more friends than you can talk to, a cool thing to happen and then, eq is a blast cause you got friends all over the place that you can always be talking to.<br>
<br>
for me though eq is more than a game, cause ive met someone that i really do care for. when i was wandering aimlessly after many friends left i just happened ot group with a stranger and we only grouped for like a half hour in which we wandered round lost in SK. but afterwards i talked to her again and we kept talking. now me and her care more about each other than we do fora  lot of friends in RL. im not saying go out there and try to find romance, thats foolish. but if you open up and are willing to just sometimes sit and socialize with people, then you can meet some awesome people. you might have lost friends but you can stil gain more. unless your friends list is maxed out with 30people of which you still fervently talk to, update it! clear it out and go out there and make more friends! ya never know where it will take you..<br>
<br>
(hmm this ended up longer than i wanted, sorry if i sound preachy or anything lol) <p></p><span class=m><i></i></span><hr size=1><span class=m> Posts: <b>54</b>  </span></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td colspan=2><table cellpadding=8 cellspacing=0 width=100%><tr><td nowrap width=20% valign=top><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub95.ezboard.com/udadalanlyfrender.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Dadalan Lyfrender</A> </span><br> <span class=usertitle>Raid Lieutenant</span><br> <BR><img src=http://mywebpages.comcast.net/bhoward3/images/Dad_headshot.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top width=80% class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_sunglasses.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: my turn</span><br><span class=m><font color=#778899>Posted: 7/30/02 10:07:29 am</font>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>   &nbsp;&nbsp;<a href=http://pub95.ezboard.com/febonmoonfrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=293.topic&index=14><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/ultimate/reply.gif border=0 width=20 height=20 alt="reply to this message" align=absmiddle></a>   <hr size=1> You aren't being preachy Son, you are actually just expanding on what has already been said. Yes it is a game with real people in it. But what was meant by calling it a game is that you can't expect to talk in open chat (let's take guild chat for example) about personal things and expect everyone to join in the conversation. Now I'm not saying that it doesn't happen or shouldn't happen, what I am saying is that some of us like to play our role and leave that personal stuff for smaller more confined chat channels. For example, last night we got into a conversation and in it we were poking fun at each other, but using our characters' attributes (i.e. short, stubby dwarfs, tall, lanky high-elves, etc.) This is part of the game that many of us feel comfortable playing (we are a role-playing guild after all) and it's these same people that may not want to respond to a comment talking about what movie you just saw the other day. It's not that we don't care, it's just not a part of the game which we are trying to play. Now there may be nights where we might want to take part in that conversation and other nights where we don't. But to make a blanket statement like we are cold because of it is just unfounded.<br>
<br>
As for the chatting side of things, it has already been said several times that you have to go out and talk to make friends. That was the whole point of my first post. Glad your found close friends Son, but it's because you went out and were sociable. That wasn't the case with Ninye which was the whole point of this thread to begin with. In any event Ninye has said her peace, and now the ball is in her court. If she decides to take a vacation from Norrath then we will be here when she get's back. If she decides to leave the world then we wish her luck on her journeys. <p><br><br><a href="http://eq.guildmagic.com/character.cfm?ID=127031" target="_blank"><img src="http://mywebpages.comcast.net/bhoward3/images/dadalan.jpg" height=85 width=468 alt="Dadalan Lyfrender" border=0></a></p><span class=m><i></i></span><hr size=1><span class=m> Posts: <b>606</b>  </span></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td colspan=2><table cellpadding=8 cellspacing=0 width=100%><tr><td nowrap width=20% valign=top><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub95.ezboard.com/uninye1.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Ninye1</A> </span><br> <span class=usertitle>Member</span><br> </td><td valign=top width=80% class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_sunglasses.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: my turn</span><br><span class=m><font color=#778899>Posted: 7/30/02 7:50:31 pm</font>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>   &nbsp;&nbsp;<a href=http://pub95.ezboard.com/febonmoonfrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=293.topic&index=15><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/ultimate/reply.gif border=0 width=20 height=20 alt="reply to this message" align=absmiddle></a>   <hr size=1> Ok OK!
