My name is Willisa Sorrowblade.  I have but only rejoined the ranks of the Shadows of the Ebon Moon and feel that maybe a simple chat about my background is in order.<br><br>I'm sure you know of my older sister Blackpoint.  Her real name is Belana though.  You see, in the family I was raised in, was one of rogue ideals.  Even though Belana's father perished before my birth my mother still named me the same as she did Belana.  My father was a high elven paladin that I never really got to know.<br><br>I knew his face and name, but he was taken by the savages in Kunark when it was first found.<br><br>But, enough of my father, it is a bitter memory i wish not to dwell on.  The naming ceremony fell amongst the rogues that Belana's father was a part in.  For example, my first name is Willisa.  The first letter of my name is W and they assign a color that starts with that letter.  So, I got the color White.  Every rogue ends with the name 'Point'.  Add the two together, and you get what is called my 'given' name.  Whitepoint.<br><br>I kept the Sorrowblade last name for it was better suited for my mother and I.  She had never married that Paladin and would be better for all of us if we all shared the last name.<br><br>It soon came time for me to choose what I would want to do in life.  My sister would continue to pressure me to join her in her rogue ways but it just didn't seem right to me.  It was as if something else was calling me.<br><br>My mother sensed this and we walked into the mighty town of Felwithe.  We had left Belana to her own devices since she was now of age to begin exploring the world around her.<br><br>It happened so swiftly that I can't remember it all but I was taken from my mothers hand by force.  It would be ten years before I would see her again.<br><br>The man that took me was just a common thief trying to dine on the younger crowd of elves in the town of Felwithe.  He ran for many miles with me over his shoulder until he stopped do to his weariness.  Unaware of my surroundings, I tried to escape but he caught me.  A gave him a quick slap across the face but was move consequential that I would have ever dreamed.  He released from his belt a small dagger from his pouch and brought it to my throat.  I cried out for help but he brought the hilt of the blade against my head sending my vision blurry.  It was then before my innocence was taken that a stranger, and now old friend found me<br><br>The thief gave a worthless attack but the robed man deflected it with a quick shot of magic.  The thief ran away but was no match for the power of this wizard.  He was struck down by a bolt of fire.<br><br>I finally awoke in the morning.  In the distance I could see a robed wizard with simple pet flying besides him.  My vision was still blurry but i could make out what he was saying.<br><br>&quot;Are you okay?&quot; he asked.<br><br>I nodded with a yes.<br><br>&quot;Good. Not to be rude but I must be going.  I am in need.&quot;<br><br>I nodded again, &quot;Thank you.&quot;<br><br>&quot;I'm just glad i happened to be around.  I know your far from home but if you loot his corpse you might find yourself some money.  I don't have any to spare unfortunately but i wish you good will and life.&quot;  He turned towards a flying creature and said simply, &quot;Lets go Muffin.&quot;<br><br>After that event, I found myself still on Faydark.  Eventually, I made it back to Felwithe where I was approached by a young scholor.  He asked if I had ever thought about being a priestess.  I answered with a quick no.<br><br>But his story he told made me change his mind.  The orcs of Crushbone were massing an army and every other hour were attacking the the wood elves of the forest.  There was a shortage of healers and if they got through them, they would certainly wipe out the outlanding areas and then amass for a war on Felwithe itself.<br><br>I had been raised on rogue ideals since I was born.  I had learned their language, their skills, and their practices.  And i threw it away.<br><br>I became a cleric and helped the elves for what was many years.  In a chance encounter, I happened to be in a bar in Kelethin when a half elf woman walked in followed by a wood elf.<br><br>She asked if anybody had seen a friend of hers.<br><br>No one answered.<br><br>She turned her head and began to walk out.  She stopped and said, &quot;Well, if anyone sees him.  Tell him Blackpoint sends her reguards.&quot;<br><br>I believe I almost fell out of my chair.  I rose to my feet and looked at her.  She looked nothing like she did before. Granted half-elves age faster than high elves but she looked strong.  Cold.  Battle hardened.<br><br>I ran to the door and grabbed her hand.  She turned quickly with a, &quot;Hey! What are you . . .&quot;<br><br>It had been ten years.  Time had changed both of us.  She wasn't all that thrilled about me joining the cleric guild.  And having a rogue name didn't help matters either.<br><br>I met her boyfriend, well, soon to be husband Cendarien that eve too.  He seemed like a good fellow.  Kept telling me he has this cousin that would be great for me.  Some guy named Tinithiel.  Who knows really.<br><br>I would continue but the rest is still being written.  I notice my sister has posted her very own log of our adventures after this point.  If you wish to learn more go ahead and read the Epic Story that she is writing.<br><br>Take care... may Tunare watch and calm your soul. <p><img src="http://home.insightbb.com/~blackpoint/AnimationEQW.gif" height=85 width=468 alt="Whitepoint Sorrowblade" border=0></a></p><span class=m><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub95.ezboard.com/uwhitepointsorrowblade.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Whitepoint Sorrowblade</A> at: 7/1/02 4:35:47 pm<br></i></span><hr size=1><span class=m> Posts: <b>14</b>  </span></td></tr></table></td></tr></table></td></tr></table><br><table border=0 width=95%><tr><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub95.ezboard.com/febonmoonfrm2.emailToFriend?topicID=39.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/ultimate/email.gif width=20 height=20 border=0 alt="email this topic to a friend" align=absmiddle></a> Email This To a Friend </td><td align=right valign="top"></td></tr></table><table width="95%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tr><td bgcolor=#006400><table border=0 width=100% cellpadding="5" cellspacing="1"><tr><td nowrap bgcolor=#000000 width=20%><a href=http://pub95.ezboard.com/febonmoonfrm2.showAddTopicScreenFromWeb><img src=http://ebonmoon.com/images/Icons/newtopic.gif border=0 alt="New Topic"></a>  &nbsp;&nbsp;<a href=http://pub95.ezboard.com/febonmoonfrm2.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=39.topic><img src=http://ebonmoon.com/images/Icons/reply.gif border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a>  </td><td bgcolor=#000000><a href=http://pub95.ezboard.com/febonmoonfrm2.threadControl?topicID=39.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/black_default/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image" align=absmiddle></a> Topic Commands (Moderator Only)  <br><a href=http://pub95.ezboard.com/febonmoonfrm2.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=39.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/ultimate/subscribe.gif width=20 height=20 border=0 alt="Click to receive email notification of replies" align=absmiddle></a> Click to receive email notification of replies  <br><a href=http://pub95.ezboard.com/febonmoonfrm2.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=39.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/ultimate/unsubscribe.gif width=20 height=20 border=0 alt="Click to stop receiving email notification of replies" align=absmiddle></a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies </td><td nowrap bgcolor=#000000 align=right><a href="http://pub95.ezboard.com/febonmoonfrm2.showPrevMessage?topicID=39.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub95.ezboard.com/febonmoonfrm2.showNextMessage?topicID=39.topic"> Next Topic >> </a></td></tr></table></td></tr></table><table width=95% border=0 cellpadding="5"><td valign="top"></td><td align="right" valign="top"><form action=http://pub95.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="ebonmoonfrm20">The Foyer<option value="ebonmoonfrm12">Recruitment - New Members<option value="ebonmoonfrm1">Family News<option value="ebonmoonfrm2">IC Only...
