The two ever-vigilant suns bobbing overhead were bitter and unforgiving with their golden splendor when it came to this land, boiling it into a fruitless region where only the most fit––or the most foolish––dared to place a foot upon. The only decent or manageable route leading into the desert came from an easterly direction, boring a crooked and less than inviting path through the heavy mountain terrain known as the Barrier Spine. The brown-baked mountains were steep and perilous with their drooping slopes. The arrow-head tips at the summits of the mountains reached well beyond what most would even consider climbing. The natural barrier formed by the string of mountains was useful in more ways than one, it kept out any invaders yet held the desert’s own people tightly under its belt. This was a key feature because the inhabitants of Gauldevine Garge, the slatarian city located deep in the desert’s bowels, had a tendency to flock to greener lands if they could manage to slip away. The Govenant had never allowed such things, though his people suffered around him while he enjoyed living a life of luxury.<br>
<br>
Located on both the entry and exit of the passageway through the mountains was an outpost manned by a battalion of Gauldevine Soldiers. They prevented anyone from leaving or entering the Silacion Desert as they saw fit. Actually, entering was not so much of a problem, but trying to leave certainly was. A bold slatarian filled with determination as endless as the sand might finagle his way through the treacherous mountains and avoid the outposts; that’s if thirst and hunger didn’t claim the better half of his endurance first. There were few who cared to try it, and if they did by chance happen to make it, they definitely deserved the freedom they had earned.<br>
<br>
Of course, that was a good two hundred years ago. Things could have drastically changed in such a lapse of time. Returned from the Realm of Malediction, Ardren had been gone from this side of the world for quite awhile, and it was time that he returned to set in motion the restoration of his kingdom. Who ruled it now? Was the main question that poked and teased inside of his mind. Could it be the ancestors of the one who had murdered him? If so, a final reckoning would be in order so that they could receive due punishment for the perfidious acts committed by their ascendants. But there was the off chance that the Fundament had somehow taken control and established themselves in Gauldevine as well, because strangely enough, they always were interested in the western lands; a search taken by them long ago carried them deep into the desert, where none who had departed to go on that excursion ever returned––Ardren could only ponder what the bevy of them had been seeking. <br>
<br>
The Fundament was not necessarily Ardren’s enemy, in fact, they had supplied slatarian troops with logistics and weapons during the Uprising of Altryen Veldiffus. Altryen was Ardren’s father, he had been a three-striped general––which was the fourth highest position of command––in the Govenant’s army. It was Ardren’s father who had sparked the beginning of a bloody revolt against the tyrannic rule of Govenant Goi; a man who had become a dictator with thoughts twisted only around unattainable dreams of world domination. Govenant Goi had been in a perfect position to strike out at the world, since the Fundament had been caught in the middle of a predicament. Despite the fact that Govenant Goi’s campaign of conquest had occurred over 200 years after the War of Redemption, the Fundament, which was the chief ruling body and keeper of peace on Falax’mertenya, was in a weakened state due to internal conflicts. It had been breaking apart ever since Dardaroff’s fall; the only reason it had united in the first place was to end the terror of the Fallen Nyriad.<br>
<br>
 The slatarians had never partaken in the War of Redemption, therefore their army was fresh and of formidable numbers. Naturally, the slatarians were a tougher breed of humans; over aeons of time the inferno of the desert had forged and molded them to be this way. But of course, the strength of the slatarians did not equal that of the tanzars, who were located almost on the opposite side of the world. The tanzar dwelled in the Ravenous Land, a place which made the Silacion Desert look like a comfortable and welcoming place in comparison.<br>
<br>
At first Ardren’s father had supported the aggressive actions of Govenant Goi, but he soon realized the cost the war was taking on their own people––the same people who Govenant Goi seemed to care very little about. Every last resource––that could be spared without downgrading Goi’s own extravagant quality of lifestyle––was funneled into the military’s arms. Like all kingdoms, there was only a limited quantity of goods to be circulated around. One either stayed halfway between the production margins of military and economic goods, or went all economic goods at the sacrifice of military, and vica-versa. With everything being poured into Govenant Goi’s warfare, the people of Gauldevine were left with nothing but the sand beneath their toes. Water was scarce in those days as well. The Silacion River that snaked its way down from the north was running dry; it cut right through the city, but before it could reach, most of it was drained away through branching irrigation canals to feed the precious farmlands.     <br>
<br>
As a result of the water shortage, and the bulk of goods being pushed into the military; dust and death had been about equally common in the streets of Gauldevine. When walking the sandy streets during those days, one would have to carefully wade his way through the scattered mounds of shriveled up and meatless carcasses. These were the only remainders of the civilians claimed by starvation and dehydration. The flies and rats found it to be a most gluttonous era; everyday they multiplied throughout the city like a black locust of death sweeping across the land, feasting in delight on the corpses until their bloated stomachs nearly came undone at the seams.  <br>
<br>
Those days always replayed themselves in Ardren’s mind. The grim images of streets littered with famished bodies were imprinted into his memory as if they had been pressed there by a hot branding iron. All that death and decay was a crisp painting that his thoughts would never allow him to rinse away. <br>
<br>
Ardren recollected what happened during the actual war. At first the Fundament had been the main opposition standing in the way of the Govenant’s army. It always had a few scouts poking around at the edge of the Barrier Spine, so it was well aware of possible hostilities when slatarian troops began massing near the mountain border. <br>
<br>
The Fundament could not mobilize the brunt of its military muscle to take action right away though. It had its hands filled trying to extinguish a war that had been ignited between the two kingdoms of Glamisoreat North and Glamisoreat South. There was a High Decka in Glamisoreat North and South, each was battling over possession of Cloudsunder and Rosethorn; two weapons older than the War of Redemption that they both claimed to deserve ownership of. The Fundament was pinched into a tight position, since its capital city was located between the two warring kingdoms. Struggling to muster enough forces to defend itself against the two kingdoms if they collided, it could hardly spare enough troops to fend off slatarians in the west if they attempted to invade. Luckily for the Fundament, there was a vast wilderness in between the west and the east. The slatarians, most of them unaccustomed to the woodlands, had a difficult time navigating through forested areas. On top of that, the land grew colder the farther one went northeast. Slatarians did not have the proper woolen clothing to survive harsher climates, so they were forced to turn back and pillage the lands which they had recently ignored. Govenant Goi wanted to eliminate the Fundament while it was weak, but until his army equipped themselves with the proper weather-resistant apparel, he would have to wait. <br>
<br>
For a brief period of time, the slatarian army divided apart and raided farmlands all across the western country sides. They plundered grain mills, dairy farms, and livestock to sustain themselves. What little they were able to send back to Gauldevine Garge was not enough, since most of the people living there had no means of growing their own food and were starving. More resources were flooding out to support the army than were flooding in. Govenant Goi cared not though; the majority of those who were dying in the city were old anyway. According to him, young children hardly had a use either, and could easily be replaced. Many women were dying off as well, but the enemy’s women, once captured after the Fundament was toppled, would work just as effectively for repopulating lost numbers. Govenant Goi had felt that if he could overtake the Fundament, then all the other kingdoms would bow before him in fear of being smote down themselves. If they refused to bend a knee, then it would be off to battle with the lot of them. The Fundament being destroyed was the turning point that Govenant Goi never attained though. <br>
<br>
In support of the Fundament, an army journeyed from Kingdom Medwhold, which was located just to the southwest of Kingdom Algaroy. It was a kingdom positioned much farther north than Glamisoreat South, but was far enough to the west to avoid its reach should it invade Kingdom Algaroy. Still, it came to the Fundament’s defense. Glamisoreat South and North, correspondingly, were more or less southwest and northeast of Kingdom Algaroy, but they would still have to pass through Algaroy to get at each other’s throat. Although Kingdom Algaroy and Kingdom Medwhold were vastly different in their customs and laws, they still held strong to the beliefs of the Fundament. In fact, even before the Fundament was established they had been like brother nations. Together, they ended the conflict between Glamisoreat South and North. Actually, they didn’t necessarily end it, but left the opposing sides in a stalemate. Ardren knew not what the outcome of it had been after all these years, but both of the Glamisoreat kingdoms harnessed a bitter hatred for one another, so it’s possible that Kingdom Algaroy and Medwhold were crushed between them if it had come to war again.<br>
<br>
After the Fundament subdued the two rivalrous kingdoms into an uneasy treaty, it grimly set its eyes upon the west, where the slatarians had ravaged homes and murdered families in many of its richest lands. Leaving enough troops behind in Kingdom Algaroy as a necessary precaution––should the two kingdoms decide to slaughter each other again––the Fundament took a sturdy number of men to drive out the invaders from the west.<br>
<br>
But their efforts were not entirely needed. The slatarian army had quarreled amongst itself after its soldiers had learned about the situation back home. Many of them were still young men, not far beyond their twenties. They had families back in Gauldevine Garge who were dying because the Govenant was too focused on the flow of war rather than the distribution of food amongst his subjects. Of course, there had been third-party merchants selling food at outrageous costs, which none could afford, so many of the merchants ended up murdered or pilfered of everything they owned. The scarcity of food combined with the lack of water had taken a deadly toll on the population. Without sufficient water, none even attempted to make an escape across the desert––such an undertaking would be death written in stone. Despite Altryen’s attempts to persuade the Govenant to make peace, so that the young men of the army could return to the farms and help dig more irrigation canals, which were crucial for the survival of their people, all his efforts were for naught. The Govenant had refused to return to the old life, he claimed there were riches to be had in the greener parts of the world, and it was only this initial hump of despair that had to be passed over, then their people would rise up from the slums and thrive once they obtained a foothold in the east.<br>
<br>
With a large enemy force approaching, Altryen had easily recognized the hopelessness of the situation. They would be driven back into the desert with nothing to show. Slatarians were masters of the desert but these men from the east were masters of the forests, even their few farmers armed with longbows had posed problems; an entire army of trained fighting men in the woods would decimate the slatarians with the ease of rain washing away dirt. Altryen had always considered luring the Fundament soldiers onto his own terrain, but it was a notion quickly dismissed. Why would they follow him into a heartless land when their own thrived with life and beauty?<br>
<br>
Ardren absently nodded to himself. There had been only one solution left for his father, and that was to end the war by removing Govenant Goi. Altryen had arrived at this decision after returning to his troops. Roughly half of the men supported a seizure of power after realizing how much of a ruthless tyrant their govenant had become. Of course, there were those who still held an irreplaceable faith in the govenant. They had refused to turn against their master, and soon bloodshed erupted between the two divided sides of the army. <br>
<br>
Ardren remembered fighting his own comrades alongside his father. Some of them were men that he had talked to on more than one occasion and they weren’t necessarily bad, but they had been pressured by the leaders from their menages to continue retaining the Govenant’s rule. Altryen’s menage; Menage Veldiffus, and another menage; Menage Pilliddus, were the main supporters of expelling Govenant Goi. On the other hand, Menage Regraff and Menage Valgroff were in favor of the Govenant’s ideals. They had been promised the largest portions of land and would become vassals of the conquered kingdoms if their plans succeeded. <br>
<br>
Things may have turned out ghastly if the Fundament had not intervened. Obviously, after Altryen’s treachery, his sept of the army no longer received supplies from Gauldevine Garge. They had to make do with what they could scavenge in the wilderness, which was not much to say the least. But by this time the Fundament had arrived in the west, after nearly attacking Altryen’s army, they learned that he was in fact on their side. This was an excellent opportunity for the Fundament, since instead of waging a costly war they could now supply Altryen with weapons and provisions, and not have to waste their own human resources in a messy conflict.<br>
<br>
High Decka Vernondo IV, from the Fundament, trained the slatarians in different arts of war, and he even began trying to teach a few men how to phase stride. Ardren was one of the few capable of learning the basics of phase striding, a technique that was so dangerous that most who learned it perished soon afterward. With the backing of the Fundament, and weapons and armor made of a finer craft, Altryen and his new allies were easily able to drive the opposing menages out of the woodlands and back into the Silacion Desert.<br>
<br>
The Fundament did not go any further at this point though. They had explained to the slatarians that they were recuperating from a previous conflict that had taken place with Glamisoreat North and South. They had promised to continue sending supplies, but they would not deploy troops into the desert. Just as well, Ardren had thought, leave the slatarian business to the slatarians. Their enemies, entrenched in the desert, held out for days upon days though. In the end, it was uncertain who held the greatest kill count; either the two suns frying the life out of them, or the two warring armies clashing in waves of sweat and blood. Govenant Goi was safely fortified within his palace while the battles raged ever closer to Gauldevine Garge. But to the dismay of the rebellious slatarians, Altryen was stricken down in battle before they reached the city. After mourning his loss for a few days, and being driven back by the opposition forces, the rebellious slatarians sliced forward through their enemies once again.<br>
<br>
At last they reached the city, where the streets soon became decorated in sanguine ribbons of blood. The battles were fierce and quick, small groups of men engaging other small groups of men down alleyways and on street corners. Finally after heavy losses on both sides, the palace was taken and Govenant Goi was beheaded. For Ardren’s leadership and valor he was granted the gilded blue badges of the govenant’s seat, but his reign did not last long, he and his family were poisoned by someone from Menage Pilliddus soon afterwards.  <br>
<br>
The motives behind his untimely murder were uncertain, but Ardren suspected the Fundament might have been involved. After the revolt, he had refused to sign treaties sent by the Fundament, which requested free roam of the Silacion Desert and Gauldevine Garge. Although they had helped greatly in usurping Govenant Goi, Ardren still had a difficult time trusting them. He wanted Gauldevine Garge to remain independent, and that wouldn’t happen with the Fundament roving around. Eventually they would decide to integrate, it had always happened in the Fundament’s history of freeing other nations. Uniting with the Fundament might have had its advantages, but then again it might have been like signing a warrant to enable slavery. The Fundament was known to use smaller kingdoms as mere production mills, with the inhabitants of those smaller kingdoms living well below poverty levels, due to the fact that they sold their goods back to the mother kingdom at near production costs, and had tariffs placed on imported products coming from the mother kingdom. <br>
<br>
So after all of his hardships and struggles, he had been poisoned by a good friend from Menage Pilliddus. At least he assumed Menage Pilliddus was responsible, since the banquet was held at their manor.  <br>
<br>
All he remembered after being murdered was falling down forever into the chasm of Tower Vozz. He wondered if that was where all things went after passing away from the mortal coil. But death had only been just the beginning, Dredikkon, Tormentor of Souls, offered him a chance to return. Ardren readily accepted, and soon became known as an Unconsecrated One. Not just anyone could be brought back, it seemed that having the ability to phase stride was somehow linked with being able to become an Unconsecrated One.<br>
<br>
And now, after years of being imprisoned in Tower Vozz, he was back in the world of Falax’mertenya. He was not the only one. There were others like himself, who had left to seek out ambitions of their own after breaking through the Grand Seal. There was Geshtarn, the Armor Lord, likely building up an army in the south at this very moment. There were also Sarakta and Macbayeth, along with a few others, but Ardren didn’t know what they were planning and didn’t really care. He was traveling cross country to the northwest, heading for the Silacion Desert, where it would be time to settle things with whomever now ruled there.<br>
<br>
Ardren gently placed a hand on his forehead and wiped off a layer of sweat. He had become lost in his thoughts again. The two suns were still hanging in the western sky, like a pair of brightly glowing eyes never ceasing in their restless watch. Fat wintry clouds laggardly floated past them every now and then, temporarily sealing off the rays of the two suns and replacing them with a flood of gossamer shadows, which quickly spread across rocks, trees, and flowers. Tufts of grass danced and twirled to the stirring of a mid-summer breeze which swelled up around them. Clusters of pollen lazily rolled through the air, changing directions with each gentle sweep of the wind.  <br>
<br>
Insects buzzed and hummed in a chorus of chirps and clicks. A brown-tailed hawk circling overhead screamed out in warning, making it clear that it was coming down to hunt any prey that might be hiding beneath the green drapery below. A few white-tipped fox tails dangling above the long grass chased each other back and forth, accompanied only by the sound of yips and yelps.&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
<br>
The ocean of blue sky overhead was also populated by flocks of other squawking birds, revealing themselves as dark outlines as they flapped their wings and nonchalantly sailed off in the direction of the suns.<br>
<br>
A shallow clear-watered creak cackled as it curved its way through the middle of the meadow, cascading over stones and across sediment. The radiance of the suns painted its rippling surface with splashes of gold, nearly making it a shade of yellow so bright that it scorched the eyes to look upon. <br>
<br>
Ardren hadn’t really examined his surroundings until now, it seemed he was nearing his destination of Starkwood. He was a little weary with travel though. Spotting a nearby boulder, he strolled over to it and sat down on its stumpy surface. After stretching his legs and wiping more sweat from his face, the tan-skinned man laughed aloud to himself, “Ha! I can’t believe this heat is getting to me. At this rate, I’m not looking forward to passing through the Silacion Desert.”<br>
<br>
Pulling free the straps of the travel pack held firmly across his back, he laid it out on the ground. He had purchased plenty of supplies at a trading outpost some miles back. Not surprisingly, they didn’t have the faintest idea of whom he actually was. In his own lands he was likely historically recorded, but to people beyond the Barrier Spine he was just another face. The few people at the trading outpost had glared at him awkwardly, as if most of them had never seen a slatarian before. The black-tinted spectacles hanging on his nose seemed to draw  the brunt of their attention. They had never seen glasses like those, and one person even offered to buy them. Of course, Ardren refused, he would need them to shield his eyes once he reached the desert. The sun shades were something the slatarians had possessed for a long time, he was surprised the rest of the world didn’t have them by now.<br>
<br>
The silver marks Ardren had used to buy his goods were an outdated currency, but since they were made of real silver, the merchant happily accepted them. He had purchased several pounds of dried meat, a dozen flasks for water, and a map. Speaking of water, it would be a good idea to replenish his stock in the nearby creek.<br>
<br>
Loosening the sword belt pulled taught across his waist, Ardren slid it free and tossed both the scabbarded sword and studded girdle into the grass off to the side. The sword was known as Venombite, a blade whose hilt was made of two golden snakes entwined with one another. Like most fanciful swords, it was an heirloom that had been passed down through generations.<br>
<br>
Folding both of his tan-skinned hands back behind his head, Ardren surveyed the surrounding countryside through the black-tinged vision of his sun shades. His snowy hair, contrasting with the baked color of his skin, had grown somewhat long in these past couple of weeks. Slanting thin strands of it dangled between his eyes and over his ears, rising up to float on the wind whenever it blew in sudden gusts. The baggy tunic Ardren wore coincided with the color of his hair almost to perfection. It was a white, loose-fitting garb sleeveless from the shoulders down, doing little to hide his bulky arms and upper frame. The center of it was cut open in a narrow slit that ran down and stopped just above his stomach, partially revealing his hilly chest beneath. It was clothing best suited for desert travel, since it would provide a scarce amount of warmth anywhere else. <br>
<br>
After having his fill of drink and food––being careful to ration it––Ardren groggily stood back up on his feet and prepared to continue his journey northward. Slinging his backpack over his shoulders and buckling his girdle back on, he walked on through the length of grassland. By this time, the two suns were beginning to nestle down beyond the western horizon, casting a dull orange glow across the land like the hearth of a fireplace.  <br>
<br>
Before all the light fleeted, Ardren pulled out a dry piece of rolled-up parchment from a side pouch. He held out the map scroll in front of himself then unraveled it. He scanned his eyes across it several times then grumbled to himself. It didn’t appear to be a very accurate depiction of Falax’mertenya; more than a dozen places were left blank with a “?” in the middle of a void. Other areas had childish-looking monsters drawn in to fill up empty spaces. The cartographer who had drawn this map must have had some fun with it.<br>
<br>
The Fotenburg Plain which Ardren had just traveled across was far out of proportion, according to the map, he should be in Starkwood by now. Looking up from the map and squinting into the distance, Ardren could barely discern needle-like treetops poking over a hill crest. He crumpled the map up into a ball then rigidly shoved the parchment back into his pouch. It would be days yet until he reached Gauldevine Garge.<br>
<br>
A few hours later the suns had solemnly retired for the evening, and now the sky above was a pitch-black wall adorned with glistening shards of white stars. Feckless light bouncing off of the moon was all that permeated the night air, casting a silver shroud over the folding grasslands. The sharp features of Ardren’s tanned face were half illuminated in a silvery mask cast down from the moon’s pearlescent glow. He no longer wore his sun shades, for they would only hamper his sight in the dark. Eyes hazier than gray storm clouds stared out through round sockets that were slightly creased with tension. Occasionally as he walked along they were partially lit up with glimmers from the scintillating moon. <br>
<br>
The silver streaked grassland soon came to an abrupt halt. A forested wall just ahead halted its advance. The Starkwood. Tall bony tree trunks rose up from the ground in perfect lines, forming a thick fencing with their crisscrossing branches and low-hanging boughs. The closely huddled trees wore long skirts of green pine needles, which hid the moon and stars behind their overlapping bristles. The trees groaned and swayed as a chill breeze picked up and rocked them back and forth. Their gnarled branches creaked as they rubbed up against each other. The outer branches waved to Ardren like a crowd of knotted hands, trying to entice him to draw nearer. He considered waiting until morning, when it would be easier to navigate the woods. But he always was impatient, besides, he wouldn’t be able to sleep until morning since he was already well rested enough from the break he had taken earlier. <br>
<br>
After the departure of the suns, the air had cooled off considerably. Clouds of mist, generated from the creek, could be seen hovering across the grasslands behind. The sounds had become more restrained also; only the crickets chirped, along with a seldom owl hoot or a lonely wolf calling out to the moon.<br>
<br>
Ardren stepped away from the plain and melted into the sea of darkness beneath the trees. It was even colder beneath the branches, he almost shivered in spite of himself. His light clothing retained little heat, now he almost wished he had bought a shirt of wools at the trading outpost. His boots crunched over mounds of pine needles, and aside from that, the only other noise was the whisper of the wind and scratching of tree branches. <br>
<br>
It was difficult to catch glimpses of the sky through the feathery spans of pine needles, but through scattered openings, Ardren was able to see the constellation of the Northern Triangle in the blackened sky every now and then. At least he knew he wasn’t wandering astray.&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
<br>
The air was filled with the sweet taste of running tree sap, coming from the trunks that were crowded in all around him. Despite his best interests, Ardren was beginning to take a liking to the forested lands. He had little time to admire them during the war, but now they were almost starting to feel like a second home.<br>
<br>
Ardren continued on through the forest for hours, and it showed no sign of lessening, but only seemed to grow thicker. The scabbard of Venombite slapped against his side as he continued aggressively pushing his way through the interlocked branches barring his path. Sometimes the branches that had been moved aside came whipping back around, smacking Ardren square in the forehead like disciplinary paddles. The man only shook the sudden bites of pain from his head, then resumed picking his way through the brush. <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
Surprisingly, Ardren neither heard nor saw any animals scampering through the woods. The deepening night remained mostly quiet and still, unperturbed by even an owl’s hoot. Ardren pumped his arms and practically swam his way through the vast thicket of sticks and boughs. Forked branches poked and scratched at his bare arms, leaving superficial marks that slightly bled. Ardren breaking through the woods caused such a tumultuous ruckus that anyone with half an ear would be able to pinpoint his location. Sweat now streamed down his skin, mixing in with fresh cuts to ignite small pockets of stinging pain.<br>
<br>
Ardren bitterly muttered several curses under his breath, fearing that he had become lost. His frustration drove him to unsheathe Venombite, and he began hacking away at the bothersome branches flourishing themselves on all sides. Somewhere within the unblemished gloom ahead, a twig violently snapped so loud that it was heard above Ardren’s furious slashing. Ardren stopped swinging mid-stroke, then slowly rested his blade at his side, listening for the noise to shatter the silence once again. His eyes narrowed and cautiously swept back and forth through the wooded area, scrutinizing the shadows for any unnatural movement. Perhaps he had imagined it. Who else would be out here in the middle of the night besides himself?<br>
<br>
Setting his mouth into a slight frown, he glanced around several more times, casting a look over his shoulder for good measure as well. Only darkness was there. Pure unbreakable darkness. Wearily he began to walk forward, resting a hand on his hilt as he surveyed the shadows. Minutes later, he heard another crack of twigs. This time he cupped both hands to his mouth and in a commanding tone shouted, “Who’s out there? You would be wise to show yourself.” <br>
<br>
Stillness replied without an answer. Irritated by this, Ardren boldly dashed to where the sound had originated from. He came across a thin waist-high branch broken in half, still dangling on fibers of torn bark. Someone was definitely out there, and judging by their avoidance, it was doubtful that they were friendly.<br>
<br>
Again Ardren trudged forth across ground blanketed in pine needles. The dense wood seemed to be giving way to sparser plant life as he traveled further; soon, a wide clearing opened up just ahead. It was still dark, and difficult to tell how large the clearing was, but it looked big enough to support a decent number of travelers. Lunar beams of silver streamed down through gaps in the ceiling of branches overhead, projecting faint puddles of light where they touched the forest floor. <br>
<br>
Ardren stepped out from the shelter of darkness and strode out into the middle of the clearing. His white hair almost seemed to glow beneath the pale reflection of the moon. At first glance, there was nothing to be noted in the clearing; upon closer examination, Ardren found the remains of a campfire. In the clearing’s center, there was a pit encircled by rocks and full of smoldering ashes, where black tendrils of smoke sluggishly roped their way into the twilit sky. Mere hours ago a fire had likely been blazing here. As Ardren knelt down to examine the pit closer, the smell of freshly hewed death wafted into his nostrils. His facial expression tightened into an apprehensive knot. It smelled like a recently gutted wild animal, and perhaps that’s what it was. Without further hesitation, Ardren nimbly sprung back onto his feet. He spun in a complete circle, searching for the source of the bloody aroma. There, near one of the clearing’s edges, something slowly dangled from a low branch. It was impossible to tell what it was in the dark––at this range anyway. It was a carcass of some sort, hung out to dry like clothes draped over a line, and it was a wonder that no scavenging animal had taken advantage of it by now.<br>
<br>
<br>
Somewhat eager to find out what it was, Ardren approached it at a brisk pace. The sight that he soon beheld sickened his bowels, churning them into mush. The figure was a human, or what had been a human. Its neck was propped in between the fork of the two branches which creaked as they held it up. Its face was bloated and swollen up with the rush of blood trapped inside of it. The sanguine-colored body dripped into a steadily growing puddle beneath itself, and it was then that Ardren realized it was totally naked and flayed; not a single trace of skin remained on the body’s form. Ardren stumbled backward in disgust, falling to the ground. He looked up and saw more skinless corpses hanging from higher branches, silhouetted against the night sky, swaying with the breeze every now and then.<br>
<br>
Ardren only shuddered to himself, then whispered in befuddlement. “What in the name of the damned?” Gathering his senses away from the sights that they beheld, he climbed back onto his feet. He suddenly wanted to be away from here. Very far away. Ever since learning how to phase stride, a feeling of imminent death would raise the hackles on the back of his neck when danger was near. The hackles were rising so much now that they were practically tearing themselves away from his neck.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
Two slender hands slowly stretched out from the shadows behind Ardren, fingers fanning out wide to enfold his neck and strangle it. But their lethal grasp only clamped shut on air. Ardren had already begun diving to the ground as they reached out, and within the same motion, he spun around mid-air and unleashed a blow from Venombite, slashing out at his unknown assailant in a sloppy arc. He thought for sure that he had taken his attacker by surprise, but the assailant jumped away from the blade in a blur of deftness. Ardren thudded hard onto a covering of pine needles, but he rolled backward and instantaneously flung himself back onto his heels. Clutching the spiraling hilt of Venombite with both hands, he poised himself into a low striking stance; front leg extended all the way out in front of him, and left knee bent slightly behind him. He furiously pitched his head from side to side, trying to watch all directions at once. But his nimble adversary was nowhere to be seen. <br>
<br>
Growing tired of waiting, he called out in a deep challenging thread of voice. “So my shadow has decided to show itself. Where is it now? If its first attempt does not succeed does it run and cower as if it was chased off by the light of day?” No one answered back, maybe it was some kind of mindless beast he was dealing with. Ardren began to take careful steps through the clearing, glancing all around into the thick black of motionless trees. He continued on, not lightening his tone. “I can guess what you are. Maybe you are one of those woodland cultists, part of the Zorrid Circle. The ones who eat babies and make love with demons. You do not frighten me, because you are nothing more than a butcher crawling in the shadows. Once those shadows leave you; your head will be mine.”<br>
<br>
Ardren spun in a half circle on his heel as he heard a female’s voice call out from behind. “Bold threats, Prince of Gothelheim.” Prince of Gothelheim? Was she addressing him? In any case, he now knew the relative location of his assailant. The trick would be to keep her talking. <br>
<br>
Ardren marched toward the thicket where the woman had spoken from. He called out to her understandingly, “Ah, so you’re a crazed witch. Show yourself so that I can string you up in a tree like you did to your victims here.” Surprisingly, the witch complied with his request. Out from the dark stepped a woman of average height, fully dressed in a coat made entirely of skinned human flesh. The skin was not tanned or boiled, but was simply raw skin––some of it still stained red––stitched together in a horrendous form of a garment. The human hides looked delicately cut, with the flaps of arms and legs still dangling off from the main torso of flesh. It was so repulsive that Ardren had to turn his head away––to think he had seen the worst of everything before this moment. Slowly, he turned back to look at the woman. Her face was not at all ugly, but was smooth and seemingly ripe. Blue diamond tattoos, or maybe it was the natural appearance of her skin, overlapped the area surrounding her hazel eyes. Streamers of blue hair washed down over her forehead in curls, while some of it was neatly tucked behind her ears.<br>
<br>
After he looked her up and down in bewilderment, Ardren managed to cough out the question, “Who are you?” She still stood a good distance away, but Ardren was ready to explode into a wave of sword techniques should she advance any closer. He had never seen anything like her, and hated to admit that his fear was starting to overwhelm him.<br>
<br>
The woman’s thin lips folded up into a mirthful smile. She tapped her chin in amusement with a slender finger. The moonlight raced up and down her body as she stepped forward. Ardren threateningly raised his weapon in response. The woman halted, then casually said, “I wouldn’t expect you to remember me. You’ve been lied to for so long, but you will eventually learn the truth as will the others.” She slightly tipped a bow toward him, “For now you can call me Gravida.”<br>
<br>
Ardren shook his head in a dismissive manner. Was there no limit to a person’s insanity? “I don’t recall knowing anyone that flayed human skin and wore it like a new fashion. Why you are even speaking to me is beyond understanding, but you’ll soon meet your doom on the end of my sword.”Let her try something first. She had moved with incredible agility before, but maybe he could catch her off guard using mournfire.<br>
<br>
Gravida elegantly strode forward across the clearing, then spoke to him in a jovial pitch. “My doom? You should know, life is the end and death is the beginning. You only acknowledge this fact through your words, you want to hasten yourself from the end and start anew. Very well then, I will grant your wish.” Placing one foot back, she suddenly launched herself forward like a rabid animal. Small blades of steel gleamed in each of her fists, still caked red from her previous murders. Ardren had not anticipated her acting so quickly, he barely managed to sway to the side as her blades split through the darkness with their flashes. He swept Venombite up from its resting position, and hewed a mighty stroke powerful enough to fell a tree. But Gravida was far too quick. His slash winded through the air she had just sped through, and twisted his torso all the way around from its momentum. <br>
<br>
After fumbling his weapon back into an offensive position, he stood tall and firm, facing his enemy who was near the outer ring of the clearing. She was half concealed within the shadows as she began to circle around him, her blades still capturing silver reflections of the moon. Ardren held his ground, rotating on his feet to follow her movements. “Damn you, woman! Come for me so we can be done with this.” He thrust his blade into the ground and taunted her with his left hand. “Come!”<br>
<br>
Gravida grinned complacently as she stepped back into the clearing. “Eager to die, are you?” In a flourish of alacrity, she came flying forth at a dead-charge once again. But Ardren was ready for her this time. Thrusting his left hand outward, then opening wide all his fingers so his extended palm faced Gravida, he summoned mournfire to do his bidding. Blue-orange flames roared out from his hand like a huffed blow torch, briefly illuminating the entire clearing in a dull blue-orange aura cast by the dancing flames. Ardren had to clamp his right hand over the wrist of his left, to prevent it shooting back from the recoil. His own hair madly whipped about from the back draft of the enchanted flames. The cold-hot fire continued splashing forth, until it slowly died out after a few final wreathes. But before it was completely extinguished, Ardren hoisted his sword forward, and dashed through the remaining hazy ashes of frost sediment that were floating down from the stream of mournfire. His enemy was encased in dancing tongues of flame and ice, she writhed and twisted in agony as it consumed her. Arden raised his sword to shoulder height, then drove it home through the other’s chest, pushing it until her body was flat up against the hilt. He continued dashing forward with the enemy now gored on the end of his weapon. He didn’t stop until he reached the edge of the clearing, where he roughly punched his blade through the trunk of a large pine, pinioning his foe between sword hilt and tree. <br>
<br>
Satisfied with his work, Ardren released his grip on Venombite and took several steps back. He could feel warm blood soaking his tunic where his enemy had nicked him, but it was nothing major. Ardren looked back up at his blade, and to his dismay, saw that his enemy was no longer pinned on it. The coat of human skins was still nailed there, now charred black and covered in snow flakes, but Gravida was somehow...gone.<br>
<br>
Ardren ripped his blade free of the trunk and examined it. No sign of blood, only a sticky sap ran down its gleaming length. “Damn!” He shouted out to the trees. He was relieved to find that the sense of hidden danger was now completely absent. Gravida was gone.<br>
<br>
After he sheathed his sword, Ardren made sure that his travel pack was still fastened tightly onto his shoulders, then looked up into the sky for the Northern Triangle. No reason to stay here. He would continue his trek onward to Gauldevine Garge. <br>
<br>
After stepping out of the clearing, Ardren turned back as he heard Gravida’s voice echoing in the distance. “The Faded Remnants of a lost world, they must be returned.” Her voice wasn’t really there, yet somehow it was. What did all of her inane babble mean? None of it amounted to anything. Ardren decided it would be best to ignore it.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top"> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub95.ezboard.com/ffantasystoriesforumfrm1.showPrevMessage?topicID=156.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub95.ezboard.com/ffantasystoriesforumfrm1.showNextMessage?topicID=156.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a self href=http://pub95.ezboard.com/ffantasystoriesforumfrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=156.topic><img src=http://Auction.2y.net/user/paradisetheheretic/addreply.jpg border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub95.ezboard.com/ffantasystoriesforumfrm1.emailToFriend?topicID=156.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub95.ezboard.com/ffantasystoriesforumfrm1.threadControl?topicID=156.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/professional/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands</a><br> <a href=http://pub95.ezboard.com/ffantasystoriesforumfrm1.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=156.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/ultimate/subscribe.gif width=20 height=20 border=0 alt="Click to receive email notification of replies"> Click to receive email notification of replies</a> <br>  <a href=http://pub95.ezboard.com/ffantasystoriesforumfrm1.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=156.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/ultimate/unsubscribe.gif width=20 height=20 border=0 alt="Click to stop receiving email notification of replies"> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies</a> <br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub95.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="fantasystoriesforumfrm1">General Fantasy Stories<option value="fantasystoriesforumfrm2">EverQuest Stories<option value="fantasystoriesforumfrm11">Fantasy Inspired Art<option value="fantasystoriesforumfrm14">Fantasy Inspired Poetry<option value="fantasystoriesforumfrm7">Role Playing Forum<option value="fantasystoriesforumfrm3">Suggestions for FSF<option value="fantasystoriesforumfrm4">Off-Topic Discussions<option value="fantasystoriesforumfrm12">Polls:  Off-Topic and Otherwise<option value="fantasystoriesforumfrm5">Stories by:  Paradise Perdu<option value="fantasystoriesforumfrm6">Stories by:  Bellona Kali<option value="fantasystoriesforumfrm8">Stories by:  Mindles Kali<option value="fantasystoriesforumfrm9">Stories by:  Ryvian<option value="fantasystoriesforumfrm10">Stories by:  Dahnyella Sylvanblitz<option value="fantasystoriesforumfrm15">Stories by:  Shoken</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#FF0000>- </font><a href=http://pub95.ezboard.com/bfantasystoriesforum>Fantasy Stories Forum</a><font color=#FF0000> - </font><a href=http://pub95.ezboard.com/ffantasystoriesforumfrm1>General Fantasy Stories</a> <font color=#FF0000> - </font><br><br><table border=0 align=center><tr><td align=center><a href="http://login.ezboard.com/BBSSystem.showUserPaymentScreen" target="_blank">Upgrade your account to ezSupporter...</a></td><td><img src="http://www.ezboard.com/image/spacer.gif" width=15 height=1 border=0></td><td align=center><a href="http://login.ezboard.com/BBSSystem.showUserPaymentScreen" target="_blank">...and never see another ad or pop-up again</a></td></tr></table><CENTER><!-- START BOTTOM AD SCRIPT -->
