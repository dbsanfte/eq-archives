It was the single thing that ran through her mind. She worked for a nameless, faceless, formless force that belonged to someone she had never met. If she wanted it to end, she would have to work. Did she have to kill? Wasn't that the thing that got her banished in the first place? She couldn't think like that. It didn't need to make sense. All that it needed was to work. <br>
<br>
Her mind was floating around her. Her target was close, she could feel it. All she had been told was that it was female. A buzzing shot through her head; it was very close... Her feet picked up and she began to jog. This would be a peice of cake, just like the rest of the assignments had been. Peice of ca- a shrill scream deafened her ears. There, right in front of her stood a busty blonde with cream white skin in a rather revealing red top and black skirt waiting to cross the street. The scream grew louder forcing her not to hesitate. The fallen angel grabbed for her right hands dagger and as she did so, lunged forward at the blonde. It was quick. In one graceful swipe the target had its hands clutching the deep wound just below its hip before its leg began. There was no saving this target. <br>
Just as quickly as she had attacked, the once angel was gone. Her boots made no sound as she ran from the scene. But the pain of the scream had long since subsided. The moment her blade made contact with skin it had stopped. A dark ally's fire escape was the refuge she found. Crouched on the tip of her toes she sat with the wheels in her head turning. Not a drop of blood tainted her white outfit. It was the blade that was stained. She didn't mind the killing, not anymore. But why did she continue to do it? She wasn't looking for re-entry into the place she had once lived. It wasn't redemtion she was after. So then, why? To be human? No, being a fallen angel had many advantages. Maybe... she did it so that she could kill... and justify it? Or perhaps... yes, perhaps it was simply that she's forgotten her reasons in all the blood, and now the only thing left is the mechanical completion of her tasks. What happened to what little life she had? It was gone. All there was for her was the assignments. She wasn't living... she was working. <p><br>

Standing in the street, Vermifax watched with a slight grin the fiend tear the lady apart. Looking up he saw the sky and the stars. Many couldn't see their luster, for the city had bloated out their once mighty strength. Standing below the lamp light, looking at his watch, the angel. He had made a promise. For his life, he must give up a fallen angel. He would find her and he would kill her, just as he had in the past. It seemed that his cowerdly heart had taken over once more. Again looking at the fiend, he let his frustration out on the lamp light and lifted back to his normal perch on the cross above St. Mary's church. The girl, the angel, the same. Angry now, Vermifax looked out into the city. His thoughts concentrated on the soft flicks of emotion from a strong being. There she was. She was sitting in an ally. He hated himself, maybe she would be strong enough, maybe she wouldn't. He only hoped that this would be the last. Floating down to the city below, his tail flexed and his claws grew slightly longer. Why did he not just let the hunters kill him in the beginning. Now he would be passed down as their slave forever. Closing his eyes he saw the figure sitting. Even from here her perfection and beauty was as obvious to Vermifax as were his constalations in the skys. Maybe he could tell her that she needed to leave town... maybe he could tell her to go somewhere that they wouldn't find her... He'd have to face the hunter of course. As he landed next to the angel, he pushed all thoughts out of his mind, he had a job to do.<br>
Human form again, &quot;Hello there.&quot;<br>

She could feel the darkness in his aura. His presence, however, did not startle her. The tone in his voice and his practiced movements told her he too was working. She had always known she would be an assigment. But today... she really didn't want to deal with this bullshit. <br>
<br>
So she stood. Her eyes continued to stare into space as if she was still in keep thought, though she wasn't. Never once did she offer the figure her gaze or even grace his existance with ackknowledgement. No. He was working. And she was done. And she left. Simple. She walked away through the dark ally and onto the next. <p><br>

The lights off. There were never any lights here. Sitting alone in his room he listened to the music that he had grown to like, but never love. Music grew old outdated and then forgotten, he had learned that to be caught up in the past was to live there, and die there. He lived for today. But that life had grown hard and he did not feel like continuing it any longer. Looking out the dark window to his city, Vermifax closed his eyes. What he would have given to just be born human. Human and mortal. He had a job... @#%$ the job... He would never be the slave again. ever... If they wanted him to work too bad. He would not kill again. he would not attack.. he would not scare, he would not be used a tactic. Looking at his fish, his cat, his radio... alone.<br>
<br>
His eyes snapped open. The song... <br>
<br>
On a cobweb afternoon<br>
In a room full of emptiness<br>
By a freeway I confess<br>
I was lost in the pages<br>
Of a book full of death<br>
Reading how we'll die alone<br>
And if we're good we'll lay to rest<br>
Anywhere we want to go<br>
<br>
In your house I long to be<br>
Room by room patiently<br>
I'll wait for you there<br>
Like a stone I'll wait for you there<br>
Alone<br>
<br>
On my deathbed I will prey<br>
To the gods and the angels<br>
Like a pagan to anyone<br>
Who will take me to heaven<br>
To a place I recall<br>
I was there so long ago<br>
The sky was bruised<br>
The wine was bled<br>
And there you led me on<br>
<br>
In your house I long to be<br>
Room by room patiently<br>
I'll wait for you there<br>
Like a stone I'll wait for you there<br>
Alone<br>
<br>
And on I read<br>
Until the day was done<br>
And I sat in regret<br>
Of all the things I've done<br>
For all that I've blessed<br>
And all that I've wronged<br>
In dreams until my death<br>
I will wander on <br>
<br>
staring at the ceiling, sighing. This would be the last job... the last night... the last time. Standing he pulled his coat from the rack. Before the girl had left he had pulled her address. He would end it tonight.<br>
<br>
The next few posts will be my last on this site... I wanted to let you few left know that it has been my greatest privilage to write with you talented people. Come what might in the future, I want you few to be well and have luck and skill in everything you try. I know that you will succeed... Bell, I want you to know that as a great friend you've been to me in the lonely times of my life, that even though I'm leaving I want you to know that I'll always wish you well. I only want good things for you on this site. This is the end of the rope.<br>

Coming to the large condo buildings, he smiled to himself. He was going home finally. He had grown fed up with this life. It was time for a change. Opening the front door, he walked into the lobby and looked around. This place was certainly of the top notch. Walking past the young girl at the front desk he ignored her as she asked him to stop. He knew exactly where he was going. <br>
Inside the elevator, Vermifax felt nothing, not a single emotion. He was hungry. letting the doors open he didn't wait for his hostess to come get the door. He walked straight into the room. Walking around the house, he didn't see anyone, but he could feel a pressence. &quot;Little girl. Come out, there's no point in delaying this.&quot; The edge in his voice was gone, he was nothing but a hungry hollow shell. &quot;Don't make this hard on either of us. I want to end this. GET YOUR ASS OUT HERE NOW!&quot; he roared finally not able to take it anymore. He needed to do this. He stormed from room to room till he found her. Sitting her back to him staring at a wall. He could do this easy. He could. Stareing at her back, the twin scars ran verticlly downwards. His tail started to extend. The ball at the end, the spikes. He looked at her neck, long slender, perfect. He was destroying a divine being... no he was going to destroy a cast down demon. He started forward. No... shaking his head he stopped. She still hadn't turned, was she that scared, or was she simply that indifferent. If it the first it would be usual, but if the second. He knew he couldn't take the life. &quot;Turn around atleast and tell me your name? Please?&quot;<br>

Her mind was detached from reality and yet grounded. With a low hung head, she turned toward him. What was there left to try for? He wouldn't move. He was waiting for her. Making it easy for her to make the first move. And she did... Her eyes drifted up him, looked right through him until granite iris's stared directly into his eyes. In his mind, the world melted away. All that was was her slate grey eyes. She leaned her head to the side, and as the world began to drip back into view, he watched her blankly as she pulled her hair from her shoulder so her bare neck was before him. A single swipe of a claw, a small gash from a blade, and stab, a wound, and she was gone. His job would be done then. But before him stood an angel, forfieting her life to him. She was allowing him to take her essance... it was the ultimate submission. An Angel... submissing? ...to an imp. <p><br>

She offered her life to the imp, not this inferior freak. A warrior's pride welled up in her chest. A switch had been flipped inside her. Since the day of her creation she had been trained to do one thing - fight. At one time she had been the best, an archangel, and she had not forgotten a single motion since then. <br>
<br>
The fiend took a step. Already her daggers were drawn and the dull end of the blade pressed against her forearm. Weakling! He dared stand against her? He would soon know the price of menising with an angel.<br>
<br>
He ran faster at her now, lunging and attacking. She wouldn't dodge. With an iron force behind it her foot went towards his jaw to kick him back and in a single fluid movement her foot was back on the ground and her arm thrust upward to slice him open with her dagger drawn close at her wrist. This was the sole reason she had been created, this was what she was destined for.  <p><br>

Throwing his vision back to the angel. Vermifax was not worried about the hunter. He had dealt with those before, but he had never taken a fully fed Fiend. &quot;Oh!&quot; He didn't want the girl to be hurt, and he pounced at the fiend as a strike was aimed at his back. he growled but did not turn. His claws were so close, his tail ready to rip. All his rage was going for one thing, kill. His vision was red and he could taste the blood of those who threatened on his hunt! <br>
