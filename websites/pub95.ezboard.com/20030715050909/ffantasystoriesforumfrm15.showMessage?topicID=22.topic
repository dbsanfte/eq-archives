Chapter 4<br>
<br>
&quot;Shadows from the Past, part 1.&quot;<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
It had been raining in Freeport for close to two days straight now, but tonight was the far worse than before. Every few minutes there could be seen a flash of light and the sound of crashing thunder in the small pub that several citizen's had taken refuge in. Most of the people where newer faces to the bartender and his waitress, but that was to be expected. After all the weather was horrible, and had taken to being dreadfully cold as well this evening.<br>
<br>
&quot;Mr. Trass, don't look so down, at least we're having good business tonight.&quot;, with that the waitress smiled.<br>
<br>
Mr. Trass considered Kiri to be his best waitress, and she always chose to work over when the other waitresses got sick. This was the case for the night, still he was slightly worried about the people in the bar. Most particular was a man that was sitting in the corner who had came in earlier. This man was far to quiet, and kept his face hidden beneath cloth constantly.<br>
<br>
There where also the three other men, who were far to noisy rowdy at one of the tables. In truth he had over heard them speaking about Kiri's appearance. He had to admit she was an attractive young woman, the only problem was he knew better than to say anything. The last poor soul who hit on Kiri had found themselves in one of the worst street fights he had ever seen with an elderly old man that could only be made out to be one of her relatives.<br>
<br>
&quot;Say Kiri, why don't you go over and try to talk to our mystery friend there.&quot;, Mr. Trass simply nodded his head in the direction of the lone man.<br>
<br>
The young woman simply did as she was told, sitting down at an empty chair at the man's table. There was something she could sense about him that was sad, as if he was in a great deal of emotional pain. She had always had a way of feeling a small amount of what others sometimes felt. If anything this helped her with the customers and kept them all coming back. This time was different, the feeling was far more intense than she had felt from anyone else.<br>
<br>
&quot;So Mister why are you so sad?&quot;<br>
<br>
At that the man simply glanced over at Kiri's eyes then stood up. He slowly made his way to the door, only to throw back a small pouch at her. It was amazingly heavy, and he had intended it to be so, since it was stuffed full with platinum coins. For him money didn't seem to be a matter, if anything it seemed to be a burden.<br>
<br>
&quot;Your tip for the night young woman...&quot;, his voice was strong, and at the same time calm.<br>
<br>
With that he was out the door before she could say another word, even as she looked through the window she lost track of him as a sheet of rain pelted the panes of the window. The bartender on the other hand wasn't surprised. He had seen the type before, they had no friends, nor seemed to have any family. All they did was travel from place to place doing what ever job suited them, but this one was different...<br>
<br>
<br>
&quot;So she is who my father seems to want captured... I don't quite understand.&quot;<br>
<br>
In truth the man didn't really understand at all, his father was one of the strongest beings to ever grace the face of Norrath. Yet, for him to hold an interest in this girl meant she was probably related to one of his few defeats. For some reason he just couldn't understand why innocent people where victimized by his father. Even as he continued to walk through the rain the girls eyes seemed to haunt his mind, there was something about her that was so odd.<br>
<br>
Nonetheless he wasn't here to cause anyone any harm, he simply wanted to see the people who had defeated his father. Perhaps then he might understand more of his father and just why he was like he was. Something nagged at the strangers mind, often he had been able to sense who was a genuine threat to people, a kind of foresight to predict when some violent act would occur between people. Tonight it was a feeling about the three men who had been noisily making comments about the waitress.<br>
<br>
&quot;I suppose I should intervene this one time...&quot;, Darkness surrounded the stranger's figure and he simply vanished into the night.<br>
<br>
<br>
&quot;Well Kiri, I think its safe for you to go home now, don't worry about all the cleaning, just head on home.&quot;<br>
<br>
This was the least Mr. Trass could do for Kiri, after all the many times she had picked up the slack around the pub. She was such a sweet girl, always full of joy, as if she hadn't a care in the world. In fact she seemed to care more about others than she did for herself sometimes. What with all the times she had stayed when she should have went home.<br>
<br>
Still he was worried about the three men he had seen earlier, they where overly interested in Kiri. This is why he had chosen to send her on her way while he suspected the guards would still be out in full force. That was one thing he could count on as well, the Freeport Militia and the Knights of Truth were always at odds which meant the streets would remain safe for the most part.<br>
<br>
<br>
Kiri was humming as she traveled through the rain, making sure she didn't step in the more deeper of the water puddles that laced the street. In being so carefree she had neglected to notice several people moving about in the shadows behind her. She really didn't have to worry, what with how her parents, and her great uncle were. The memory of her great uncle fighting in the street the one day was still fresh in her mind.<br>
<br>
She always knew her great uncle was a good fighter in his prime, but as an old man she couldn't believe the strength he had. Sure she had received some training by him personally, since her parents insisted that she learn at least a little self defense. Though she had never really had to use any of those skills, everyone who met her seemed to like her. In fact she couldn't remember anyone who actually tried to be mean to her.<br>
<br>
Tonight that was going to change for her as she felt someone shove her forward, sending her toppling to the wet ground before her. When she finally managed to look back she could make out the figures of three men. Kiri for once was afraid, she had no idea what was happening of what to do now. <br>
<br>
&quot;See boss I told ya, she's a sitting duck.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;That's right boss, she'll fetch a fine price on the slave market once we get her trained.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Aye, that's my specialty, though if she's good enough I might just keep her for us instead.&quot;, the apparent boss of the three smiled down at Kiri.<br>
<br>
<br>
The strange feeling he had gotten was correct, this time though all seemed different for him. Certainly he could just go on, but something was urging him to help now. This scene reminded him of the past, when his mother had been killed. So far in his life he had noticed that no matter the race, if someone is deemed different then they are feared.<br>
<br>
Tonight was going to be a change for him, perhaps now he could do something and not be persecuted for what he was. He moved in for a closer look and noticed that clearly the young woman wasn't going to be able to defend herself. She was far to scared to even consider doing anything, even her screams wouldn't be heard, mainly because earlier he had noticed the guards where all taking shelter. Now was his time to take action as he appeared from a sheet of rain and stepped between the young woman and the trio.<br>
<br>
&quot;An who might you be?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Are you her boyfriend.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;No, I'm more of a concerned citizen&quot;, there was slight smile on the strangers face.<br>
<br>
&quot;Why don't you just leave her alone? If you do, I'll let you live.&quot;<br>
<br>
All three laughed at hearing this, for the most part in their many times of doing this they had never had very much trouble. Sure sometimes people like this interrupted them, but usually they ended up as another victim of what looked like a failed robbery. This instance was different though, they hadn't picked this girl at random, someone had asked for her personally, someone who intended to pay a fortune.<br>
<br>
&quot;I have given you a chance at life, you have refused it...&quot;, the stranger reached under his cloak and rested his hand on the hilt of a sword.<br>
<br>
Kiri could tell this person was serious now, in her mind she thought for certain this was a spy for the Paladins who controlled Northern Freeport. Most of the ones she had met tended to act this way when it came to women, most unlike the Freeport Militia. Something with this person was different as she seen mana begin to surround his body.<br>
<br>
The stranger pulled his hand away from his sword for a moment, which for the most part confused the three men before him. They couldn't understand just what he was going to try, but the visible appearance of mana around his person was going to make things more difficult. They considered this to be one of the more worrisome parts of the business, since wounds caused by magic often took longer to heal.<br>
<br>
A Flash of lightning was all it took and the fight was on, in truth he hadn't imagined these people would present much of a problem. That is until he realized they where using weapons he hadn't counted on, in truth they where of a strange enchantment. He had to end this quickly, so he unsheathed his sword and slipped past their attacks, aiming his blade for the weakest of them.<br>
<br>
Blood soon diluted into the wet puddles on the ground as one of Kiri's assailants fell, having had the strangers sword rammed through his heart. All hopes for her safety soon sank as one of the two remaining men drove his short sword into the side of the stranger. There was no scream, no audible sound that the stranger had been wounded though. Soon the stranger found himself struck from behind as the broadsword of the other remaining man ran across his back.<br>
<br>
In his mind he cursed his luck, he had underestimated them three of them, but at least he had killed one of them for sure. As his sight finally began to black out there was odd feeling in the air, as if he could sense some kind of new power. It felt feral, almost animalistic in nature and yet he wasn't afraid of it as he slipped into the void of unconsciousness.<br>
<br>
<br>
This was something he despised, since their parents where out of town he had to play baby-sitter for his great nieces. It was no wonder he had gray hair at this age, if anything it was a blessing in disguise since most people never expected what was coming when they fought him. Still tonight of all nights for them to be out late like this, and in the rain at that. At least he could find Kiri easily in the city, given the unique connection he had with his relatives finding her sister wouldn't be very difficult either.<br>
<br>
To make matters worse he was expecting his grand son to arrive the very same night. In all his years of living he could of never imagined having a family like this. Nevertheless it was comforting to know that they didn't have to suffer as he did during his younger years. Those thoughts where set aside as he neared where he sensed Kiri, he could make out the faint smell of blood in the air through the rain.<br>
<br>
Instantly he began to mask himself within the shadows as he peered around the corner and witnessed three men fighting. Soon he found the source of the blood, it was a forth man who lay dead on the ground. Whomever these men where, it was clearly obvious that some of them had intended to harm Kiri. Of all people, he knew if he waited long enough that one of the sides would win, and then he could take whatever action he thought was necessary.<br>
<br>
<br>
&quot;Well now that he's done with, how about we take our prize now?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Most certainly, she'll make sure we'll stay nice an warm tonight with what we have planned for her.&quot;<br>
<br>
All Kiri could do was scream out for help, she didn't want to be taken away by these people, and she certainly didn't think she could handle these two by herself. Off in the distance she heard something, someone breathing heavily, she could feel the anger swelling up in this person. Fear raced through her heart as she felt the emotion building up from this other person, this unbridled rage that she felt was about to consume everything around it.<br>
<br>
<br>
Now he was certain of what was happening before him, raw power was beginning to flow through very inch of his being as he heard his great niece scream out for help. All he did was take a single step out into plain view, his hands clenched into tight fists. There was a audible snapping as his knuckles made a disgusting cracking sound. Soon enough a crimson aura had surrounded his body, which caused the rain that fell near him to evaporate from the heat it produced.<br>
<br>
&quot;Hey Boss, looks like we got more company.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Aye it does, an this time its some old man to.&quot;, this was very amusing to him to see an old man here as a smile graced the slaver's face.<br>
<br>
&quot;You fools will die for trying to harm my family, especially my dear great niece here.&quot;, he simply pulled back the hood of his cloak as his eyes turned into solid onyx orbs.<br>
<br>
The weaker of Kiri's remaining two assailants rushed forward, his sword aimed for the old man's chest. It was a futile attempted on his behalf since he found his blade parried to the side with little effort from his opponent. Once again he lashed out to the old man's side this time, only to find his strike to be blocked by a forearm. That was the last thing the man would ever do as he found his sword forcefully pulled from his hands and then darkness filled his world as his own sword was used against him.<br>
<br>
This was something the old man missed, the carnage of a battle, and this one reminded him of old times as the sword in his hands was shattered over the skull of his advisari. He heard Kiri scream once more an faint, as the man's head seemed to explode from the impact. A smile crossed the old mans face as he looked down at the remains of the blade, then threw them through the air lodging the broken edge into his remaining opponent.<br>
<br>
As quickly as it had started it was over, the puddles on the street began to turn a crimson color, similar to that of a fine red wine. Even as he hoisted his great niece over his shoulder he still savored the fight he had just had. Still as he turned to look at the wounded man on the street whom had fallen earlier he felt he should do something. With his decision made he shrugged and lifted the man up onto his free shoulder. As he began the walk home he could only wonder just where the other great niece was, and what she was up to.<br>
<br>
<br>
Kiri came to just as her great uncle entered her house, and before she could say anything she was tossed down to the floor on her rear. For all the times she had been taken care of by her great uncle she always thought of him slightly cruel to most. That was to be expected though since he did put an effort into giving her some lessons in fighting. Still she was puzzled at just why he had brought the stranger who had protected her home with them.<br>
<br>
&quot;This person protected you did he not?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Yes, he tried to at least.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Then since you can't seem to fight worth a damn, your going to take care of him, at least until he's well.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;I understand...&quot;, Kiri felt horrible now as she watched her great uncle take the unconscious man into the other room.<br>
<br>
She did her best to gather some spare bandages her parents kept in the house, then made her way into the room. At least it was her bed that he was laying on rather than her brother's or her sister's, after all her sister was probably already on her way home, and her brother was suppose to come back home soon for a tournament. Soon enough she heard her great uncle leave the house as she began to unravel the soaked cloths of the man before her.<br>
<br>
Kiri had a rough idea of where the wounds where, though it was best to make sure there wasn't something else she would have to care for later. A surprise came to her as she managed to pull the cloth away and uncover the man's face. She was amazed at how handsome this man was, further removal of his garments only proved this. Not only was he good looking, but his muscles where extremely well defined, proof that he had been through a great deal of training.<br>
<br>
What was before her was a mystery though, the wound on his side only appeared to be a scratch at best now, but she had clearly seen blood earlier. Even the cloth she removed showed signs of heavy bleeding, but now there was no flowing blood. The only real evidence that remained of him being injured where the deep scratch like marks, and the torn blood soaked shirt.<br>
<br>
All she could do was hastily cover up the marks with the bandages, she wasn't quite sure what her sister or great uncle would do if they seen him in this shape now. Once she was finished though she couldn't help but stare at him. His hair was a deep brown, though she wasn't quite certain what color his eyes where since he hadn't given her the chance to look earlier. There was just something strange about him, like he was somehow more different than his appearance gave away.<br>
<br>
&quot;Staring isn't polite...&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;I'm....... I'm..... I'm sorry.&quot;, Kiri felt her face flush as it turned red from embarrassment.<br>
<br>
&quot;Where am I, and how did I get here?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Well your at my home, an my great uncle brought you here.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Since it seems I'm a guest here in your home, I'll introduce myself. My name is Alexander, but you may call me Alex.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;My name is Kiri, its a pleasure to meet you...&quot;<br>
<br>
Alex sat up in the bed, taking the time to let his eyes adjust to their surroundings. It was clear this was a woman's bedroom. For the most part it was tidy, and well kept, also it had a warm feeling to it, which made it seem a little better. He was glad though, at least it wasn't anything associated with cleric's or paladin's, which he had good reason to avoid.<br>
<br>
&quot;This might alarm you Kiri, but I'll be forward with you I'm not exactly what I appear to be.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;I guessed as much from the way your wounds appeared.&quot;<br>
<br>
For a second he smiled at her, and the sight before her sent chills up her spine. She had never actually seen someone like Alex before, and in fact most people feared people like him. For some reason she wasn't afraid, just startled at the fact of what he really was. Anyone else in her position would have went into hysterics by now, but rather than that she backed away, not wanting to give anything to chance.<br>
<br>
&quot;Your a vampire?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Not exactly, I'm only part vampire, you see my mother was a human.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;So what would make you take a chance like before, as well as even coming to this city?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Well in a sense I'm stuck playing baby-sitter, my little brother and our sister are somewhere in this city.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;So the reason you where at the pub was you where searching for them?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Yeah, my little brother tends to get into trouble, so that's the first place I go looking.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Oh, I forgot to thank you for helping me...&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;I would think we're even now.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;So where would you expect your sister to be?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;I'm not totally sure, this is the first time she ever really came to a big city.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Well you can stay here for the night if you like.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Thank you...&quot;<br>
<br>
Alex laid back once again in the bed, wondering what mischief his little brother and his sister could be into tonight. After all their curiosity always had got the better of them, no matter where they were. At least now he could have a decent nights rest if luck was with him.
