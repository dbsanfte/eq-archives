The gods have left the world.  Conventional magic and clerical powers are GONE, but wild magic and healing of the heart have replaced the gifts of the gods.  New factions are emerging and the world is but a pot, ready to boil over.  In my adaptation for Eq, The city of freeport has joined with Neriak, Ogguk, and the troll town whose name I can't remember.  The elves of Felwithe and Kelethin are at war, the dwarves have allied with thsoe of Kelethin and the gnomes with those of Felwithe.  The erudites of Odus have forsaken the ideals of good and evil and have created a new city.  The forest of toxullia is gone.  The two cities have joined together to create a metropolis of power and intellegence.  Were once had been wood, is now a giant city of beauty.  The halflings are, well, the same.  Halas was destroyed and what remains of the barbarians is tribes scattered throughout the everfrost.  The coldain have been destroyed and the dragons and giants on Velious are no longer at war, although they are the least of allies.  The iksar believe it was their failure as subjects to Cazic that caused his dissapearance.  They are planning to mount an attack on Antonica to strike fear so that they may once again regain their gods favor.  The geography is otherwise the same as are all the leaders.  Oh, there are also 2 tunnels leading from kaladim to kelethin and another from ak'anon to felwithe.  Well, I hope you like the idea and post!)  <br>
<br>
Oh and magic no longer requires words and hand motions.  It comes from within, but I will leave that open for you to tweak yourselves!<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  ) <p>Ignis Summa Pugnabat, The fires shall cleanse the world.</p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub95.ezboard.com/bfantasystoriesforum.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=rillen>Rillen</A> at: 8/6/02 8:00:58 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub95.ezboard.com/ubellonakali.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Bellona Kali</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Child of Hate</span><br>  Posts: 409<br> <font color=#FF0000>(8/6/02 9:05 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub95.ezboard.com/ffantasystoriesforumfrm7.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=10.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://auction.2y.net/user/paradisetheheretic/Reineva.JPG WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: eq modified rp</span><hr size=1> ~*(wild magic? healing of the heart? sounds kinda fruity to me... hehe, it's an *awsome* idea! ^.^ I just don't wanna be the one to start it out :P hehe.

You could hear the sabertooth cat's drinking from the lake hundreds of feet away.  The sound of many feet walking through the grass of the Lake of Ill Omen was also clearly audible, just about anywhere near the lake.<br>
<br>
From the direction of the Frontier Mountains, the small group could be seen.  Likely only one hundred humanoids coming through.  Teir'dal, Ogres, Trolls and humans made up the bulk of the group.  A rare gnome or Iksar scattered in.<br>
<br>
Near the front of the group, along with the platemail clad knights and warriors and robed necromancers that lead the group, one robed figure stood out.  His stark white long hair rolled behind his head and over his shoulders.  Deep dark purple chainmail armor covered his form, the enchanted adamantite not having lost it's power with the loss of the gods.  A staff of condensed black energy crackled in his hands, waiting to strike out at something to deliver it's deadly blow and let the enemy feel its' dark power.<br>
<br>
What stood out about this elf most though, was his smoke grey skin and infuriated, hateful, yet vibrant green eyes.  A strong love had died before those eyes in the past, not long after the loss of the gods, and that dead love was replaced by an infuriated hatred for those that killed that love.  The Koada'dal.<br>
<br>
Undeen Lar'Tese couldn't help but snarl, thinking about those elves, his vampiric fangs showing slightly.  He was in a mood to kill.  Which was good, for the group was marching to the Firiona Vie docks to deliver that death he sought so much.  That burning hatred had only seemed to fuel his Wizardry magics, his magical flames hotter, and his ice colder.<br>
<br>
Just over the horizon it could be seen.  A group of elves and some short race (who could tell which from so far away?) were waiting for the marching group, in hopes to protect the docks.  If this group had any word in it, those docks wouldn't be protected by anything, let alone such a weak foe.<br>
<br>
A sudden patter of many feet could be heard.  Undeen and those he marched with thought it was the enemy before them.  Across the field, the elves heard the rushing as well, and prepared to fight, thinking it the oncoming Teir'dal, humans, Ogres and Trolls.  This fight would be a bloody one.<br>
<br>
So, it was of great surprise to both sides when they found themselves flanked by hundreds upon hundreds of rushing, fanatical, suicidal Iksar.  The Iksar cared not how many of them died.  What mattered, was the death of their enemies.  These others would all be removed from THEIR Kunark.  And soon after, Norrath as a whole.  They would please their god and bring his return, even if it meant the death of every last one of them.<br>
<br>
Monk after Iksar Monk could be seen, heard, and felt, leaping into the air, jump kicking their foe to begin the fight, warriors and knights not far behind.  Last, behind them, shaman and necromancers could barely be seen through the rush, casting spells, the shaman using what feeble powers left to them with the spirits to aid the death of their foes.<br>
<br>
Undeen saw a monk leap at him in an attempt to kick him to the ground and kill him there, but the wizard would have none of it.  Planting one end of his staff into the ground for support, the grass around sizzling and dieing, Undeen caught the Iksar in the chest with the other end and not only speared the monk upon it, but used it like a pole vault, and threw the dieing Iksar over himself, preparing to fight the next foe.<br>
<br>
with a quick spell, Undeen found himself behind his charge of men, seeing them fighting, and dieing, at the hands of this unexpected foe.  Ogres could be seen, lifting Iksar in only one hand, hurling them about like rag dolls, but still, as the flood of scale came on, the Ogres even were finding themselves outnumbered, beginning to find too little room to swing an arm effectively.  This would have to be dealt with.<br>
<br>
Anger seething in his voice, Undeen began his spell, the ground out among the thick of the Iksar beginning to feel it.  Soon, all of them would.  Oh yes.  Nothing would stop him from this revenge upon the elves.  Not one Iksar, not one hundred!<br>
<br>
With a sudden rush, a chunk of the Iksar wave was thrust into the air, higher and higher, many an Iksar spinning and tumbling uncontrollably as the fell into the sky.  Soon, the hole that had once been the floating Iksar, was filled.  Perfect.  The spell lost it's effect.  Suddenly, those Iksar that had moments ago been falling into the sky, were splattering against the earth, and the Iksar that had moved to fill in their gap.<br>
<br>
At least a hundred Iksar died on impact, either landing wrong, or landed ON wrong.  Many more were injured.  Some worse then others.  But this could only help so much against the wave.  With each precious second, more elves from both sides, humans, Ogres, and everyone there, on any side of the battle, were falling dead.<br>
<br>
With one last spell, the wizard sent a wave of fire down over the Iksar.  But to no avail.  For each that died, another two seemed to spawn from the corpse.  There seemed no end to the reserves of Iksar within Cabilis.<br>
<br>
Cursing to himself, Undeen began his last spell, the last of his charge with him, encircling him to keep him safe while he prepared their escape.<br>
<br>
With his last words, Ogres, human, elves and Iksar alike swung, only to hit empty air.  Undeen and the last four of his hundred man army, had disappeared from Kunark.  The Iksar had won this battle.  The elves and short race protecting the Firiona Vie docks, would see no such luck.  All the Iksar there that day turned upon them, and the last of the blood was spilt, with the last elf's death.  The Iksar had won this day.  And they celebrated.  They removed heads, and stuck them upon poles and spears.  What had once been an Ogre's arm, could be seen being eaten and tied together with the tendons to make spears.  There were few things stronger then the bones and tendons of an Ogre.  These spears would stab through the strongest of armor.  The Iksar would have their day.  And to that, Undeen and what was left of his forces, could only curse, for if Firiona Vie fell, they knew the Outpost of the OverThere was next...<br>
<br>
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br>
<br>
Undeen slammed his staff against the top of the pyramid in Nektulos forest as soon as the group appeared, the others cowering away from the noble slightly, &quot;Damn it all!  Those Iksar shall pay for this setback in their disgusting green blood and scales!&quot;  And with that, he was gone, the group walking towards Neriak for shelter and to report what happened.<br>
<br>
The spires in Greater Faydark whirred slightly, and the Wizard appeared, hard eyes looking over the ravished forest.  The elven war had been hell on these woods.  <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> Good.</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> was all he could think to himself on the subject.<br>
<br>
&quot;I hope these blasted elves slaughter each other so I don't have to waste the energy.&quot; He stepped out further, then heard a cry as a wood elf leaped out of the trees, trying to jump atop him.<br>
<br>
Undeen leapt aside and struck the elf across the head quickly, the energy snapping through the thin elf.  &quot;AHHHH!!!!&quot; was all he could say before he fell to the ground, charred and dead, or dieing.<br>
<br>
&quot;Did you hear that, elves?!  That was the death of another one of you!  You shall ALL feel that death one day!  May it be at my hands!!!&quot;  And with that, he disappeared into the forest, looking for some easy elven game to burn some rage on. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub95.ezboard.com/ubellonakali.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Bellona Kali</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Child of Hate</span><br>  Posts: 414<br> <font color=#FF0000>(8/7/02 1:38 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub95.ezboard.com/ffantasystoriesforumfrm7.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=10.topic&index=3>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://auction.2y.net/user/paradisetheheretic/Reineva.JPG WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: eq modified rp</span><hr size=1> It was dark. It was always dark in the forest of Nektulous but she never could grow used to it. How many times had she run through these trees? It was as if the sunlight was scared to penetrate the foliage for fear of what it might find. <br>
<br>
“For the Glory of Indigo!”<br>
<br>
Pressed against the trunk of a tree high above the ground was the girl they called Tani. ~Don’t let him see you… Don’t let him see you… Don’t let him see you…~ With eyes squeezed shut she takes in a deep breath and holds it. For a Feir’Dal her skin was quite pale, but after spending most of her time concealed in the shadows, it was expected that her tan would fade. How long was that man going to stay in the same spot? Just as long as he doesn’t look up… Tears form at the corners of her grass green eyes. ~What if he looks up? What if he finds me?~  Clenched tightly in the youths arms was a small bag, it’s contents unidentifiable from the outside. A light breeze rustles the trees and blows a few strands of her butterscotch blonde hair astray. By now she was trembling with fright. She was just a runner; a pawn used by an anti-Teir’Dal group whose whereabouts were virtually unknown. It was a fairly new organization that obviously had no trouble with recruiting adolescences. Slowly opening her right eye, Tani scans the area below her. The guards gone. Breathing a deep sigh of relief, she lets herself rest no longer. Running along branch-to-branch, she makes her way as swiftly and quietly as possible to the rendezvous point. Just as planned, all guards had left their posts at the bridge. Hopping out of the tree, she walks stealthily to the bank. ~In the bushes… off to the right, just at the waters edge… There!~  A tiny hand shakily pulls a straw basket from a thick growth of reeds. Setting the bag within the basket, she pushes it out over the waters surface. Tani’s heart was racing faster than she thought it would be. Leaving a rippling trail behind it, the makeshift boat carries the precious cargo to the opposite bank. <br>
<br>
“ELF! GET HER!”<br>
<br>
Her legs stiffen and she shoots straight up. Guards. Turning around she sees them. Each clad in the same silver armor, with stunningly crafted swords. The stronger guard rushes towards her, his sword held high over her head. Stepping back, she closes her eyes and shields her face with her arms. Home. I want to be home. A rock off sets her balance and her foot slips out from under her. With a thud her butt hits the hard stone surface of the Greater Faydark spires. Thank the Mother! No injuries! Letting out a deep sigh, Tani lays back against the gray pyramid. The treetops part just enough to let sun through and to give a gorgeous view of the vibrant blue sky. Clouds roll by lazily as she gazes upwards. Ah! To be alive still! As she watches a fluffy white bunny shaped one creep by, she can’t help but giggle. Her soft giggles erupt into uncontrollable laughter and she finds herself rolling onto her side. ~I’m alive!!!~<br>

It was as if the cities had an endless supply of people.  But one could tell if you looked at the scene repeatedly over the time since the god's disappearance, the number of living elves on the battle field shrunk with each day.  Now, there were only skirmishes.<br>
<br>
Suddenly the hairs on his neck stood on end.  He felt the power of the Spires being used nearby.  He could recognize the energy.  Someone was there.  <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> Perhaps I'll be better off going there then here...</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->  The thought of a Koada'dal wizard bringing home weak and easily killed warriors from some battle sparked in Undeen's mind.<br>
<br>
Quickly the wizard sprinted off, his chainmail barely audible over the soft din of skirmishing in the forest, and cries of battle and revenge.<br>
<br>
Near the spires, Undeen cast a spell of invisibility over himself, then silently stalked towards the spires.  His staff crackled a moment, then seemed to disappear, flowing into his hand, waiting for the instant his thoughts show it's need once more so it's energy might reform in his hands.<br>
<br>
He could hear laughter.  That was rare these days.  It sounded female...  Young.  He would have to get closer.<br>

He stepped into the spires and looked around still not seeing any elves.  <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> An Enchanter playing games?...  No no no.  That makes no sense.  Even the most novice of spell casters today don't waste away spells on such things as this.  they are too needed in combat, no matter how minor or weak.  Us casters are too few these days.  Especially the strong ones..</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->  Undeen could still remember the great hunt after the arcane learned just after the god's left.  The jealousy of the priests at their loss, but not the arcane loss.<br>
<br>
Rather suddenly, Undeen noticed the laughter was much closer, and looked down to see a pale, butterscotch haired, pale Feir'dal, laughing loudly, on her side.  It was but a child.  14 perhaps.<br>
<br>
The shock of the sudden find broke what little concentration was needed on the invisibility spell, his form now visibly standing over the Feir'dal child.<br>
<br>
For only a moment, he couldn't do anything but stare.  Her cloths were somewhat torn and ratty, and she appeared somewhat thin.  Nothing major, but enough to get Undeen's mind going.  <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> Perhaps she lives on her own...  How long then, since last she ate?  Or bathed?</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
Hundreds of thoughts on this raced through the Shadow Elf's mind in an instant, all pointing to the same thing.  He hadn't even finished thinking though, when he found himself kneeled next to the shocked child, pulling out some rations and a flask of water from a belt pouch.  He didn't have much on him, but this would likely be enough food for her for now.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> What should I do with her?...  Just leave her out here?  No!  Can't just leave the poor child out here!  What would Achi say?  What would Achi say to what I've been doing since her death?...  She would dislike it, but understand.  Abandoning a child, she would never forgive.  Especially if that child needs aid.</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
Calmly, Undeen unscrewed the flask for the child, and insisted she eat, the shocked child barely being able to pull her eyes from him.<br>
<br>
&quot;Oh..  I'm sorry.  My name is Undeen.  Please, eat some, won't you?  You need food.  You're still growing you know.&quot;  Undeen did the best he could to smile kindly at the child.<br>

This came as quite a shock. His skin was dark... enemy. He was the enemy. Tani's eyes widen. What could she do? Fight? No... she would be killed. Run. She had to. She did. Scrambling to her feet she fumbles down the steep side of the spires. Which way? Away from the camp. Taking off straight, she glances back. The elf was gone. Never before had her feet moved with such speed. Pressing herself further, she makes her way deeper into the forest. As trees wiz by she jumps over rocks, branches, and fallen trees. Gotta get away... Can't get caught. Tani feels her calves begin to burn and her chest ache. Beads of sweat drip from her temple down her cheek. Can't stop now... Tree after tree after tree flys by yet she still continues further. A root catches her foot and brings her to the ground. With her face in the dirt she lays and makes no movement. Twice now. *Twice* she almost had gotten caught. Twice... She could have died either time. Tani's shoulders tremble as quiet sobs echo against the trees. The still fresh image of that elf sends two trails of tears down her rosey cheeks. He... He was the enemy. He was the one who needed to die. So why was he... kind? Burring her face in her arms, she lets her tears flow freely. The stress of the times had worn her thin and now, she would find at least some relief in the comforting whispers of the wind.<br>

<br>
With a sigh, Undeen turned to leave, but something tugged at him.  She could be going to her allies.  She could be leading him to an encampment.  That would put her to use.  Seeing her head about to turn, his thoughts racing through his mind, he murmurs a quick spell and his quick cast 'Yonder' gate opened, flinging him forward through the forest.  And so he followed, eyeing her, opening a new gate, and stepping through, only to watch longer.<br>
<br>
Finally he saw her trip and collapse, not trying to get back up, only crying into her arms.  Undeen grimaced slightly, then cast his spell again, stepping out directly before the child, kneeling down once more to assist her, wiping the tears from her suddenly frightened, and shocked face.<br>
<br>
&quot;Shhh.  I'm actually not going to hurt you, young one.  You're safe with me for now.&quot;  Undeen did his best to calm her, though in his chainmail, he couldn't help but look like a warrior ready to do battle.  That is what he was, after all.<br>
<br>
For the longest time, the two only stared into one another's eyes as Undeen helped her to a sit and helped wipe both the girt from her body and the tears from her cheeks.<br>
<br>
Finally Tani broke the silence between them and tore her eyes from him.  <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> She knows I'm the enemy..  Let's see what she shall do about it...</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
Undeen did more then see.  Suddenly Tani, knowing she couldn't run, flailed at Undeen madly, kicking and punching at him, finally getting in a lucky hit at the back drawn wizard's face, snapping his nose, the blood suddenly pouring out.  And Undeen could only look pained, and sorrowfully glance upon the child.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> Perhaps I won't be able to calm her rage...  Perhaps I should just let her go..</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> It was about then, that Tani suddenly realized she had broken the wizard's nose...<br>

Sure, the things she delivered not only hurt, but killed many of the enemys comanders, but never had she herself ever done the damage. Her eyes shyly look up into his. She could see his pain. A tear glides down her already stained cheek. <br>
<br>
<br>
&quot;I... I.. I'm sorry!&quot;<br>
<br>
Her gaze drops to the ground hiding her tears from the evil one. Was he really the enemy? He seemed to be nice, and yet, she hurt him. Why was it him that had to be killed? He was one of the enemy... but... he was not like them. The shadowelf stood, his eyes still looking down on her. Tani reaches into her pocket. No, he was no enemy of hers. Was he? Just as he was about to leave, her hand grasps his. <br>
<br>
&quot;I'm sorry...&quot;<br>
<br>
Her palm lingered in his touch and she knew now, without a doubt, that he was no danger. Her soft hand pulls back from his leaving a small silken bandage in its place. Tani raises her head and searches his face for any hint of emotion.<br>

Nallu sat at his desk in the city of Erudin, or, what had once been Erudin.  The erudites no longer concerned themselves with such titles.  The continent of Odus was more than half way covered with buildings, all of which were part of a whole.  Yes, Paineel was still called paineel and erudin erudin, but they were no longer Paineel and Erudin.  Together they were a place for higher learning.  People studdied their, what they did with that knowledge OFF Odus mattered not.  Peace, or I should say Order, as peace was a quality of good which no longer reigned in odus, was kept.  Nallu was studying to be a healer.  He was learning, however slowly, to tap into his own spiritual force.  Unlike the clerics and druids of old, the power he was learning to use came not from the gods, nor the earth.  It came from within himself.  Only in ones heart can they truly heal themselves and others, only their can true power be attained.  Or, that was what he had been told.  For as of yet, Nallu had not been able to use that power which he had spent the last sixteen of his years becoming attuned to, and the sharp feel of a whicker branch hitting him in the back for daydreaming only emphasized that fact.  &quot;I am sorry teacher, I was wrong for letting both my mind and heart wander from such a enlightening lecture.&quot;  In false disgrace, Nallu lowered his head.  &quot;It is my inablity to pay attention that hinders me from utilizing the spirit of my own heart.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;You are correct in your ascertation Nallu.&quot;  Headmistress Gertri turned to face the class.  &quot;Leave, return when you believe you have need again of the services of those of higher attuned abilities.&quot;  Quickly yet in order, the students clad in plain robes of gray filed out of the dimly lit room of granite.  As Nallu rose to leave, Gertri pushed him back into his seat.  &quot;Not you.  I will not fail as a teacher.  You can feel your heart beat can you not, you can feel the heat throughout your body that is pulses, you know that in mind and spirit you are more than flesh and blood.  This you have spent the last sixteen years learning.  Use that!&quot;  She walked slowly to her desk and took a single wax candle, worn down to a nub, from the top of her desk and placed it before him.  &quot;Light the whick.  You can, you have the ability, you are attuned.  Do it.&quot;  Nallu closed his eyes.  He had always found it far more easy to grasp his own power with sight gone.  With his hand placed over the whick, he tried to push the heat he felt within himself into the whick.  Heat traveled through his blood, into his palm, but the wick did not flutter into life.  Gertri puffed in dissapointment.  &quot;You have failed me again.&quot;  Without a word, the middle-aged plump woman left the room in a huff. <p>Ignis Summa Pugnabat, The fires shall cleanse the world.</p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub95.ezboard.com/uundeen.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Undeen</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 5<br> <font color=#FF0000>(8/11/02 7:07 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub95.ezboard.com/ffantasystoriesforumfrm7.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=10.topic&index=13>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: its CAT BOY TIME!!!* yay!*</span><hr size=1> Undeen's head shot to the side, hearing the thunking of arrows, and the shout of a... <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> Vah'Shir?

<br>

His informants told him of blood to be spilled and battle to be done; after all, the elves were at war with each other. The &quot;evil&quot; races (which by barbarian terms just meant anyone bigger than they) had become friends with the shorter, book-shaman southerners...<br>
<br>
Ahhh, a wonderful time for a barbarian!<br>
<br>
There was a battle surrounding Brutus. Two spears were strapped to his back, channeling all the natural energies into his mind. He could feel the spirits speak at his back, and they followed *HIM* now, NOT some &quot;god&quot; or &quot;council&quot;. They had abandoned them; Brutus would not. He held a third spear on his shoulders, ready for use.<br>
<br>
The symbols drawn across his body in dried blood signified the shaman's battle standing among his people. Away from the frosted lands of the tribes, though, the strange creatures just stared. He absent mindedly patted the wolf following him, then took another swig from the brandy bottle before he heard the roar of a cat-man.<br>
<br>
Battle!!<br>
<br>
All of a sudden, elves were surrounding him. There were bows pointed at Brutus, and he stared nonchalantly at them. &quot;'Ello there, ya wee- OOF!&quot; He was already clubbed on the back of the head. The large man was hardly phased by the blow (trees *normally* sway back and forth, don't they?), but feigned unconsciousness anyways. He glided his hand ever so slightly to his dog friend, who snarled visciously, but held off the attack. He was led into a clearing where a group of paladins and steel-clad warriors had ranged weapons drawn on an inkie and a cat. There was a little elf girl, as well, and the inkie looked ready to lop a few heads off...<br>
<br>
The grass flattened underneath his dragging knees, and Brutus glanced out of the corner of his eye. He could feel the spirits speaking to him once again. They told him he was trouble. They screamed with the blood that flowed from his hands, the fire from his eyes. He was angry. Angry at the world, angry at life, just plain angry. They also sensed compassion, but the spirits still disliked this unnatural elf...<br>
<br>
Then Brutus saw the Tier'Dal's purple chainmail, sensed the odd sheilds... &quot;UNDEEN Lara's Teeth!&quot; he shouted. Elves scrambled a bit as they saw the huge man stand back up. Spears jabbed his sides, attempting to subdue him. He ignored the small, non-violent (yet) pokes, as his race was generally neutral in the Elves' War, as it was called. &quot;Yer that black elf that kills fer yer long lost lady, ain'tcha! Aye herd a you!&quot;<br>

His failure was not for lack of effort, he just wasn't able to channel what lay inside outside.  Nallu was sick of Odus.  His teachers professed that emotion and centeredness were what fueled a mystics powers while they remained cold and void of emotion themselves.  It was the humans with their ability to feel all emotion, and their versatility that had inabled them to stumble upon the power of the heart before the erudites.  As Nallu looked down at his hands, he thought, am I not human?  Erudites are but humans who have evolved to another level.  But...have we evolved too far?  Has our greater intellegence, a gift of the gods, stunted our ability to learn the internal powers that have replaced the external of old?  As he looked down upon the candle, the tears streaming down his face hurried.  In his mind, he imagined the candle burning, in his heart, he willed the energy, yet again the wick refused to flicker into life.  &quot;Why do I fail!&quot;  His screams echoed throughout the halls.

His attention quickly turned to the starting battle and soon he found one of the ends of his staff, jam hard against a Koada'Vie, the black energy that was the essence of the staff drove itself into the elf, causing a blood curtling scream, as though Undeen had just sent raw mana cursing through his body in a rather malicius fasion.  In truth, the only difference was the staff had done it for him.<br>
<br>
&quot;Yes!&quot; Undeen shouted at the barbarian as he struck down another charging Koada'dal, this one apparently not a Paladin.  Few of them remained, with the disapearance of the gods.  &quot;I'm Undeen.  What of it?&quot;<br>
<br>
His words finished, the Shadow Elf turned to the charging reinforcements of Koada'dal and gnomes and began to chant quickly, energy playing off his hands, and suddenly appearing amid the charging group, as a sudden, and outforcing blast of flames that engulfed many of the elves and gnomes, as well as the trees around them.<br>
<br>
Undeen turned to make sure the elf girl was alright, and beginning to wonder what was keeping the barbarian from answering, when he felt a sudden sting of pain, an arrow seeming to appear in his back, near his shoulder blade, nicely lodged between metal rings.<br>
<br>
With a shudder of pain, the blood beginning to flow out of the wound, Undeen turned himself back to the battle, standing himself between it and the girl.  <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> She may not be my little daughter, but someone has to be a father and protect her in this...</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>

Suddenly the healing energy swept over him and a grim smile came to his face as he murmured back a quick thank you, then aimed all his thoughts on the slowly enclosing elves.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> This isn't going to be pretty.  Then again, war never is...</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
That thought in mind, Undeen began to chant quickly as he could, letting his arcane knowledge guide his tongue, his hands now beginning to reverberate with flashes of lightning.<br>
<br>
Aiming at what seemed to be the leader, Undeen lifts both hands which still held his staff, then let a flash of lightning-like energy pass off of him, striking down the apparent leader.<br>
<br>
&quot;Stand close if you are with me!  If you are against me, stay your hand and your feet, or meet a quick death at our hands!&quot;  His little line given, Undeen began the chant for a portal spell he had kept in his mind.  Soon all near him would find themselves in what was left of the forgotten valley, Kunark.  It was one of the few still safe places he could think of.<br>
<br>
