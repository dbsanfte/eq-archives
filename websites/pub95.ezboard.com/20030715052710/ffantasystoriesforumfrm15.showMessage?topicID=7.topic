Chapter 7<br>
<br>
&quot;The Celebration, and the Morning After.&quot;<br>
<br>
<br>
Here we go folks, more revisions, and hopefully more depth. I'm glad I haven't had anyone trying to harass me while I do all this, especially since I've been coming up with new idea's for endings etc for my stories. Some will be out right wonderful, while others will just be plain out unbearable...<br>
<br>
<br>
It had only been a few hours since the incident at Mistmoore Castle. The King of Felwithe couldn't believe what he had heard from Azia's mouth, who in their right mind could. It was impossible, or so everyone thought, no single person could do what was said. That is until he heard what his scouts had to report.<br>
<br>
&quot;My King, the ladies words are indeed true, Mayong Mistmoore was killed last night. However, Mayong's remains are so beaten and battered, it looks as if some wild beast attacked him.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;That's both relieving and disturbing news, and what of the group of people that were found at the spires?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Well the it seems that all of them except the one young man suffered minor wounds, but the young man in question, the clerics said that he shouldn't even of been alive with those wounds.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Tell the clerics to pay special attention to him, that is all for now.&quot;<br>
<br>
The guard did just as he was told, delivering the message to the clerics guild. Still the clerics continued look on in astonishment as they treated Shoken's battered body, all the while Azia sat beside his bed. She couldn't believe it, for a second time he had saved her from certain death or in this case something worse than death. It was puzzling for her, she couldn't figure out the reason he or Ryo would have for doing all this.<br>
<br>
&quot;Miss, you should get some rest.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;No, I'm not going to leave till I know for certain.&quot;<br>
<br>
In the next few rooms over Zolf and Zinka had just came to, as well as Shoken's father. Daxster and Selena where awake by now as well, though they where experiencing the same disorientation as everyone else. In a split second they all were out in the hallway, looking around for Azia and Shoken, but instead where greeted by a young smiling high elf cleric.<br>
<br>
&quot;Oh your all awake, don't worry your friends are in the next room over.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;So we did it... We really survived it.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Yes Daxster we did, all of us survived it.&quot;<br>
<br>
Meanwhile in Shoken's mind he wasn't get any of the rest he wanted, thanks to the constant hammering of questions from Ryo. He was determined to find out where all that power had come from and why he wasn't able to use it before. It was something he felt he should have been able to use instead of Shoken, after all he had exhibited far greater power than his counterpart before.<br>
<br>
&quot;Where did that power come from Shoken?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;I don't know, suddenly it was just there.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;A lot of good that does us now doesn't it? What's the use of having that power if we can't use it at will.&quot;<br>
<br>
Shoken shrugged, in his mind all was black except for a image of himself and Ryo. At this point in time neither of them where happy with the situation. However, Shoken was at least thankful that he had managed to save Azia and the others. Though Ryo had just seen them as an annoyance they had did their best to help him. This was something the both of them appreciated, especially since Shoken could rest now.<br>
<br>
It had been a long night, and Azia had finally given into Shoken's attendants wishes. What she figured she needed was a nice hot bath, and after a quick stop at her room she was lead to the baths. Surprising enough the other women where already there relaxing.<br>
<br>
&quot;Rita, Dear? I wonder how come they haven't said much about you being a Teir'Dal?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;I don't know, I guess they must follow the old motto, &quot;the enemy of my enemy is my friend&quot;, or at least that's what it seems like.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Well she did help us at Mistmoore, that was proof enough for her.&quot;<br>
<br>
All three where to busy talking amongst themselves that they didn't notice that Azia had slipped into the water, that is until Selena happened to glance to the side.<br>
<br>
&quot;Don't mind if I ask how Shoken is doing?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;The clerics said he was going to be fine after a little rest, but....&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;But your still worried about him right?&quot;<br>
<br>
Azia nodded, she felt guilty about what happened. She knew that the only reason Shoken took everyone to Mistmoore Castle was to save her, but she was thankful they had come. Azia was just about to say something until Zinka interrupted her.<br>
<br>
&quot;You've got a crush on him don't you dear?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;I do not!&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Sure...&quot;<br>
<br>
The three smiled at Azia, they knew she liked him. It was impossible for her to deny it because her face had turned beet red. As best as she tried to hide it, or deny it, they all knew what was said was most likely the truth. Though they all doubted what would happen once Shoken would be awake, whether she would try to kill him, or thank him in some way.<br>
<br>
Zolf, along with Daxster and Shoken's Father had decided it was best they relax as well. Of course their way of relaxing including many bottles of elven wine, and from the way Shoken's father drank they weren't quite sure that he wasn't a Dwarf. All in total he had drank over 8 bottles all by himself, and still wasn't showing any signs of intoxication.<br>
<br>
&quot;Swear if I hadn't seen it I wouldn't of believed it, someone who could actually stand a good chance at drinking a Dwarf under the table.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Sorry, but the last time I did that the Dwarf broke a stool over my head!&quot;<br>
<br>
Shoken's father laughed having said that, but it was the truth. All Daxster and Zolf could do was shake their heads, this man seemed to have many secrets. Probably the kind they'd rather not want to ever find out about. It was about this time that Shoken woke up, and instinctively began to sneak out of the window of his room, only to land face first on the ground outside.<br>
<br>
&quot;Well, least I can move...&quot;<br>
<br>
-You move like a pregnant Troll!-<br>
<br>
-Well its better than you not being able to move at all like back at the castle!-<br>
<br>
Ryo mumbled, the worse part about being part of Shoken was the fact he had to eventually deal with the same physical pain that Shoken did. Of course at the moment Shoken wasn't paying Ryo much attention as he surveyed the place he was in, it looked as if the city was being prepared for a celebration. This just meant the both of them might have a chance at having some fun before the night was over.<br>
<br>
&quot;Excuse me, but what are the decorations for?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Oh they're to celebrate the destruction of Mayong Mistmoore.&quot;<br>
<br>
Shoken scratched his head as he walked to the bar, he knew alcohol could at least dull some of the pain he was experiencing. In the least he knew that would keep Ryo from bothering him for awhile. With that he ordered a bottle of wine and proceeded to drink the entire bottle. He had figured things couldn't possibly get any worse, but it seems fate had other plans for him this day.<br>
<br>
Azia as well as the three others had finished their bath and where already dressed, ready to do whatever they could to take their minds off Shoken. Little did they know he was as well an safe as he could ever be, or as safe as a human could be in a bar in known dwarf country. How could they image the kind acts that where going ot happen this night.<br>
<br>
&quot;So you ladies would like to participate in the talent contest?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;That's right sir, that is if you don't mind Rita here?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Well... I guess its alright.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Well this is going to be so much fun right dears?&quot;<br>
<br>
That's right they where going to perform as a quartet, definitely today would be a day to remember, fore at that very moment Shoken was having the opposite of the others luck in the bar. A rowdy dwarf had decided to come in and apparently both him and Shoken wanted the last bottle of a particularly rare wine. Most people wouldn't dare argue with a Dwarf, especially when it came to liquor, most people that is except him.<br>
<br>
&quot;Ye get your dirty human hands off Me Wine!!!&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;It was mine first!&quot;<br>
<br>
- Oh do I smell a fight brewing? This could be my chance to have a little fun!-<br>
<br>
- Shut it Ryo, I've got it all under control!-<br>
<br>
&quot;I said get Ye hands off!&quot;<br>
<br>
With that the dwarf punched Shoken in the groin, both knocking Shoken down, and worse yet, angering Ryo. Neither of the two liked this dwarf's attitude, or for that matter the fact he was determined to take their booze away from them. None in the bar could have been prepared for what happened next.<br>
<br>
&quot;Oh now you've done it dwarf! Fine if you want out then go for it...&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;What're Ye babbling about? Din't nay think I hit your brains down there.&quot;<br>
<br>
A sinister smile came to Shoken's face as he let Ryo have control, and so Ryo's trade mark crimson hair and black eyes appeared before the dwarf. All the dwarf could do was laugh though at what he seen, he simply mistook this for a simple enchanters spell. It was a mistake he would soon learn to regret.<br>
<br>
&quot;Ye be silly if'in you think that spell is gonna scare me!&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Come here you little bastard!&quot;<br>
<br>
The barkeep leapt over the counter, grabbed his waitress and pulled her back behind the bar for cover. He was wise to what kind of a mess dwarves could cause in a bar room brawl. He wasn't prepared for what he seen next as he caught a glimpse of Ryo flinging Dwarf onto the bar top, and then promptly being to bash the Dwarf's head into the wood. This person was obviously very crazy, or completely stupid when it came to dwarves he thought.<br>
<br>
&quot;Ye be a monster!!!&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Maybe I am and maybe I'm not!&quot;<br>
<br>
It was at that point several other dwarves strolled into the bar, only to be knocked back out as Ryo threw the current dwarf he was torturing at the others. So the big brawl that Felwithe would never forget began. As soon as Ryo would put another dwarf out into the street another would come, eventually the fighting left from one bar right onto the next, until they came to the bar that Shoken's father and his friends where in.<br>
<br>
&quot;Say isn't that Ryo?!&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Yes, I think it is...&quot;<br>
<br>
Zolf and Daxster gawked in amazement as a dwarf sailed over their heads and back into a shelf loaded with bottles. Shoken's father just laughed, that is until the next dwarf managed to knock over his glass of ale. One thing he couldn't stand was anyone depriving him of any of his ale, particularly when he felt he worked hard for it.<br>
<br>
&quot;That was my last mug of ale!&quot;<br>
<br>
With that Shoken's father smashed the mug over the dwarf's head, only to get rewarded by being thrown into Daxster and Zolf before it went back to getting the tar beaten out of it by Ryo. This was all it took to get the old man raring to fight as he entered the fray. He was never one to turn down a good fight, and this one looked like it was going to be more fun than drinking was at the moment.<br>
<br>
&quot;Well come on guys, lets not have my son have all the fun!&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Fun? Are you nuts? These are dwarves!&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;I think Daxster has a point, gah!!!&quot;<br>
<br>
Shoken's father pulled Daxster and Zolf into the fray, and so there they where, dwarves where being flung around left and right as Shoken's father displayed a strength none thought that such an small old man could have. Normally guards would have came to break up this sort of fight, but once they learned dwarves where involved they decided to stay away. If anything they all wanted to be able to walk after the night was over.<br>
<br>
Meanwhile the stage had already been set up and a crowd had began to gather around it. The first person up was a rogue who had a talent for displaying illusions with his swift and deft hands which, the next was a couple gnomes who put on a magnificent fireworks show. So each went their turn until finally it came to Azia, Zinka, Selena, and Rita's chance. At first the audience didn't seem to friendly at the sight of Rita, what with her being a Teir'Dal and all, that is until the singing started.<br>
<br>
Ryo had just finished putting the last dwarf's head through a solid bar top, as he heard the singing begin in the town square. Instinctively he let Shoken take control again, after all he had done had his fun. Daxster and Zolf quietly walked outside, having practically had the life beat out of their lower extremities by the dwarves. <br>
<br>
They where amazed at what the seen, it was the women, and they where singing, but not only that the crowd was cheering them on. It was at this point Shoken rushed out of the bar, and headed down the street back towards the cleric guild, the last thing he needed was to run be caught fighting again. He knew full well if Azia caught him out here she'd try to strangle him again.<br>
<br>
&quot;Those women sure do seem to work well together, unlike a certain Son and his other half I know...&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Yes, the old man does have a point doesn't he Daxster.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;He sure does... Speaking of which...&quot;<br>
<br>
They all began looking around for Shoken or Ryo, but he was no where in sight. However their attention was drawn back to the stage as the singing was over and the announcer spoke. They where surprised at just what was about to happen, though with the crowds reaction they could understand it.<br>
<br>
&quot;It looks like we have a winner, the quartet performed by these lovely young ladies!&quot;<br>
<br>
The crowd went into a fit of cheering, for their prize they had won a dinner for four. Well needless to say Shoken's father as well as Zolf and Daxster snuck off, they where in no condition to go anywhere. If anyone of the women caught them like this they'd probably end up in worse trouble than Shoken or Ryo could ever get into.<br>
<br>
&quot;Hey this is great, come on Azia have some!&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Oh well... All right I suppose a little wouldn't hurt.&quot;<br>
<br>
Sure enough Selena had convinced Azia to have some of the elven wine being served with their dinner. Well the result was four very well feed, and very drunk women who after having finished off every single bite of food their was returned to the clerics guild.<br>
<br>
As we all know being intoxicated has several effects, amongst these is uninhibited feelings some people display. Then there is the lack of better judgment on ones own part, as well as a blurred memory. This would explain the events the very next morning as Shoken woke up. <br>
<br>
Sure enough he had woken up with a headache, which took his mind off of the pain the rest of his body was in. It also took his mind off of something warm pressed up against his back and also something draped over his side. As he glanced back he seen something buried under the covers with its hand hanging over his side. Today he was about to learn a very valuable lesson, one that pertains to locking your door before going to sleep.<br>
<br>
&quot;Mhmmm..... Just a little more wine won't hurt...&quot;<br>
<br>
Shoken went wide eyed at the voice he heard, it was Azia's. He was in deep trouble now, any minute she'd be awake and only the gods could tell what her reaction would be. He knew one thing for sure, it definitely wasn't going to be pretty. With Azia involved this situation was more than likely going to become life threatening at the least.<br>
<br>
- Oh hey, you sure did have fun last night... -<br>
<br>
- Very funny Ryo... Maybe I should let you take over and take this beating we're about to get? -<br>
<br>
- Not in our lives, this was all your doing... -<br>
<br>
Before Shoken could continue to argue the inevitable occurred. Azia was awake, and as soon as she realized who was in bed the real commotion started. Her reaction was just what he ha expected, which wasn't at all what he needed at the time.<br>
<br>
&quot;You pervert!!!! How dare you take advantage of me! Your dead!!!&quot;<br>
<br>
Shoken ducked several flying objects as he ran from the room with just a sheet to cover up his dignity, or what little of it he had. That wasn't his main concern as Azia came out of the room after him, sheet tucked around her as well. She was now hell bent on making him pay for sneaking into what she thought was her room.<br>
<br>
&quot;I said your dead!!! Get back here so I can kill you?!&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;No way! I'm not getting close to you!&quot;<br>
<br>
Shoken ran down the hallway, nearly running over the others as they came out of their rooms to see what the problem was. As he ran past them several of the lady clerics decided to whistle at him, this in turn distracted him long enough for Azia to nearly catch up to him. This caused him to put even more effort into escaping from her.<br>
<br>
&quot;Hey why're you mad at me for! If I remember right your the one who started it last night!&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;I did not! Now your going to get it you pervert!!!&quot;<br>
<br>
Azia hurled a vase at Shoken, landing a perfect hit to the center of his forehead and knocking him flat on his sheet covered arse. This gave her enough time to leap onto him and begin strangling him. This, needless to say, got a lot of laughs from Zolf and Daxster, as well as a couple deep blushes from the women who where watching on. None where about to tell Azia just what kind of scene she was putting on.<br>
<br>
&quot;Die you pervert die!!!&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Gah!!! Get offa me! It looks like we're........&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;We're what?!&quot;<br>
<br>
Azia gave him a quick slap across the face before she went back to strangling him. This only proved to gain more laughter from everyone else, as well as embarrassment from the more decent people watching. This went on till finally Rita and Selena pulled her away from Shoken.<br>
<br>
&quot;Let me go! I'm not satisfied yet!!!!&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;I'm insulted! And to think that's not what you said last night!&quot;<br>
<br>
Azia growled and broke free of Selena and Rita's hold and went back to strangling Shoken, all the time screaming and banging his head against the floor. She couldn't believe this had happened, but at least now she was going to make him pay. She just knew she couldn't have done anything last night, even if she couldn't remember exactly what happened.<br>
<br>
&quot;I won't be satisfied till your limp and lifeless on the ground!!!!&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;To tight!!! You're gonna kill me!!!&quot;<br>
<br>
Shoken started to turn blue in the face, and gasp for air, until Azia was pulled off him again. He was going to have to learn to keep his thoughts to himself. It was either that or some how manage to run faster than she could...<br>
<br>
