<br>
<br>
<br>
The sun was bright overhead as it hung high in the noonday skin, bringing warmth to the city below. It was summer, and all of &lt;city&gt; was feeling the heat. A light wind rustled outside, disturbing the leaves of a tree in the front yard of a small house. A car slowly entered the driveway like it had a million times before, only this time it was different. The sound of the engine reached a girls ear inside the house. She was reaching up in a cupboard above the counter to put away a glass, finishing the last of the dishes. Why was he here? Didn't he know she didn't want anyone here anymore? She walked to the fridge and pulled a towel from the handle to wipe her hands on. He was already at the door. He opened the door slowly and stepped inside, very unsure of himself. Things were so different now, at least... she was different now. <br>
<br>
&quot;Don't you ever knock?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Never have, never will&quot;<br>
<br>
The girl grunts and steps out from behind the fridge. Her eyes seemed to stare directly into the man, making him feel naked and exposed; she always had a way of seeing through you. She let her eyes slide down to his hand, he was holding a bouquet of flowers, daisies dyed violet with plenty of green leaves to accent the color... her favorite. She growls to herself as she turns her back, wiping off the counter. <br>
<br>
&quot;Don't you ever say hello?&quot;<br>
<br>
The girl ignored his comment, pretending he wasn't there. She stood there, wiping the counter in circular motions trying not to relive the events that pounded in her mind. All of a sudden there was 12 purple daisies’ in front of her. She couldn't help but smile, daisies were such friendly flowers. She left the towel on the counter and grabbed the daisies gently, like they were glass and would break if she held them too hard or rough. The instant she took the daisies his hands were around her, holding her in a tight embrace, he was gentle like she was with the daisies. Casting the flowers aside, she put her hands over his and weakly tired to pull them away, fighting herself and her tears.<br>
<br>
&quot;You need to go...&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Is that what you want?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;You... you need to-&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Cuz if that's what you really want, I'll go. But until I'm convinced that that's what you truly want, I won't leave&quot;<br>
<br>
She sighed; she was tired of fighting, tired of trying. Her arms slipped around his as her head leaned against his shoulder. She closes her eyes defeatedly. His lips pressed against the top of her head lightly. As her eyes snap open she pushes him away, the sound of tires screeching in her mind ring louder than anything he could say. <br>
<br>
&quot;Leave. Now. You have to leave.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Come on, Kay. You know you don't really want me to go.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Yes. I do.&quot; Tears were flowing freely down her cheeks. She thought they must be permanently stained from all the crying she had done. &quot;Now leave&quot; Despite the uproar of emotion her voice was stern and unwavering. Its strength sent the message clear to him that she really did want him gone. He just didn't want to admit it. He cared too much, and had been through too much to walk out that door now. <br>
<br>
&quot;Kay... It wasn't your fault... You couldn't control what happened...&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;SHUT UP!&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Listen to me, Kay... It - wasn't - your - fault. You're going to have to accept it if you ever want to get through all this&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;SHUT UP! JUST SHUT UP!!!&quot; Her words were screamed at him, why wouldn't he listen to her and stop talking? The silence in the air was deafening. He reached out to wipe away her tears, but she jerked back. &quot;Don't touch me&quot; She spoke quietly with a bitter sort of hush. <br>
<br>
&quot;Kay...&quot; He was sympathetic and worried; the scars on her wrists were reason enough to make anyone worry.<br>
<br>
&quot;It was my fault... All of it was... You just don't understand... If *I* hadn't... If only *I* had... none of this would have happened if it wasn't for *me*!&quot; She couldn't even finish her sentences, the words hurt too much. Trying to speak about the incident only made her tears come faster. Her hands cover her face, as she sobs, no longer able to keep anything inside. He hated seeing her like this, watching her cry hurt him as much as it hurt her, which is why he couldn't just stand there. His arms were around her immediately. She didn't push him away this time, but she didn't hug him either. He wanted more than anything for things to be like they were, but he knew it would take time... lots of time, before things would even being to return too normal. How could she let herself cry again? <br>
<br>
&quot;You... you have to go...&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;No&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Damnit Michael, this is my house! Get out!&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Make me...&quot;<br>
<br>
She stood there, wanting to make him leave, but finding she couldn't. She needed him, he knew it, but she didn't want to need anyone. Michael rocks her back and forth while rubbing her back. <br>
<br>
&quot;Sssssh&quot; <br>
<br>
She lost her tears somewhere in those brief moments. She was so tired emotionally that her eyelids began to droop. With Michael’s heartbeat as her lullaby, she slowly drifted off to sleep in his arms, her pains were behind her, the world seemed so distant... Sleep welcomed her with open arms for the first times in weeks.<br>
<br>
<br>
        She didn't remember falling asleep, but she remembered more than she wanted to before waking up...<br>
<br>
&quot;Get the @#%$ outta my house... Don't bother coming back...&quot; As the door slams in her dreams, her eyes open to the real world. She'd finish the job this time; she'd never have those nightmares again. <br>
<br>
&quot;Morning, Love&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Huh?&quot; It was Michael, he was annoyingly happy this morning, he had to come a ruin everything, didn't he? <br>
<br>
&quot;Come on, you're going to miss breakfast&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;I'm not hungry&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;But I made you breakfast specially for you&quot; He climbs on top of her and puts his nose against hers, an adorable frown on his face. She couldn't help but smile. <br>
<br>
&quot;Get off&quot; Playfully she pushes him off and he dramatically falls to the ground next to her bed, his arms spread and his tongue hanging out of his mouth. Kay steps out of bed, hair messed and pajama pants up to her knees. She steps on Michael’s stomach and heads for the door. <br>
<br>
&quot;That hurt, ya know&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Yea, but you liked it&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Solong as you don't tell anyone&quot; <br>
<br>
&quot;You want some coffee?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Sure&quot;<br>
<br>
Michael stands up and silently follows Kay, whose pant legs fall down to her ankles like normal. How did she end up in her pajamas anyways? She didn't really care; it was time for coffee, not thinking. Her mind was fuzzy and she lost track of everything that happened between walking to the kitchen and ending up on the counter sipping her cup with her legs criss-crossed in front of her. Michael poured himself a cup and held it, not really wanting to drink it just yet, but the warmth from the cup felt good against his icy hands. Her house was always cold, even with the heater turned up to 80. He stood before her, watching her sip her coffee slowly, the creamer and sugar already mixed in. She didn't seem to notice he was inches away; she didn't seem to notice anything. She was zoned out, her mind still sleeping but her body awake. Just let the coffee settle into her system. Once her cup was finished she still clenched it in her hands, the sleep not completely gone. Michael kisses her forehead and takes the cup from her, setting it aside with his own. He leans in and kisses her lips lightly, getting no response. She was flat again, catatonic to most. Michael’s hand caress Kay's cheek gently, his thumb running back and forth across it. <br>
<br>
&quot;How ya feelin?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Terrible&quot; <br>
<br>
Reality came back to her like the snap of a whip. After a few blinks she felt Michael’s hand still on her cheek. She tilted her head towards his touch and put her hand over his. Never in a million years would she come out and say directly that she needed him, but right now, he knew that she needed him more than anything, it was the truth. No one could deal with her any more, they all were trying to deal with their own pain, and seeing how much more pain she was in than they were, only brought it to them stronger. Her friends loved her, she knew they did, they just didn't love the way she was anymore. She would admit she could be a tad bit difficult, but in reality she was possibly the most difficult person to deal with, except when he was there. <br>
<br>
&quot;You want anything?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Yea... I want him back&quot; Her bottom lip quivers as tears burn against the back of her eyelids. She couldn't even sit through a cup of coffee with a close friend without thinking about what happened nearly two months ago... Two months, had it really been that long? Two months he's been gone... Two months longer than she ever expected to live, two months longer than anyone else expected her to live.<br>
<br>
&quot;Kay... Why do you have to say stuff like that? It only makes things harder for you&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Cuz its true... Michael I don't think I can live without him... I... I just can't...&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;But you *are* living without him...&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;I don't want to be&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;But you *are*. You're going to have to.&quot;<br>
<br>
Kay didn't bother arguing with him, there was no point. He'd end up being right in the end anyways. She takes a deep breath, no more crying. She hated crying, crying meant you were weak. Weakness was something she didn't want. Perhaps there was a bit of her ancestors in her, it didn't matter, it wouldn’t have made sense to anyone else anyways. Michael took his hand from Kay's cheek and let her hand slowly drift to her lap. He put the two cups in the dishwasher and glanced around the house before turning it on. Leaning against the adjacent counter looking at Kay with his head tilted slightly. She was staring off towards the bottom of the fridge, her mind completely blank. He was trying to figure out what was wrong, what was bothering her this time, but nothing was, she wasn't aware of anything. Michael sneaks up beside her. His fingers tickle her sides as he whispers, &quot;boo!&quot; into her ear. Jumping, she pushes him away, smiling slightly. She hated feeling happy, but it was hard not to with him around.<br>
<br>
&quot;Knock it off&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Make me&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Oh, I'll do more than that&quot; <br>
<br>
She shoves Michael’s shoulder and holds up her fists only to be poked repeatedly in both sides. Kay had always been extremely ticklish; her weak spot was her sides. She ended up on her back on the counter, feet in the sink and head on the stove, laughing more than she had in a long time. Michael held her wrists so she couldn't resist and stopped to kiss her nose.<br>
<br>
&quot;Nice try&quot;<br>
<br>
Kay sticks her tongue out and he lifts her off the counter, putting her head in the sink.<br>
<br>
&quot;Shower time&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Noooo!!&quot;<br>
<br>
Turning on the water, he lets the ice cold water run all over her head. Kay lets out a squeak in reply. Dropping to her feet she rubs her soaking wet hair all over Michael, making him cold and wet as well.<br>
<br>
&quot;Now get in the shower, you smell&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Gee, thanks. Love you too. Gimmie a towel, I'm all drippy&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Bah, you don't need a towel&quot;<br>
<br>
Michael throws her over his shoulder and carries her into the bathroom, shutting the door behind the two. Two seconds later Michael was pushed out of the bathroom, holding onto Kay's shirt. The door shuts and he just smiles and taps on the door.<br>
<br>
&quot;Can't hear you... Waters running&quot;<br>
<br>
Kay's giggles carry through the door and a second later the water is turned on. <br>
<br>
The cool water felt good against her warm skin. The summer had brought intense heat with it, a heat she loved and hated. <br>
