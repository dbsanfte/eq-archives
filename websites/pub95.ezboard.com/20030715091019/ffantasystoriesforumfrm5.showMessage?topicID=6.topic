<br>
        Light dared not enter the chamber where Paradise now knelt. She was drawing ancient runes on the floor with blood, chanting in a long dead language. The intricate drawings filled the room in concentric circles. Paradise now stood in the center and slit her own wrists, letting her blood splash and pool on the floor. The air in the chamber became more then air, it was tangible, and was cold to the touch. <br>
        “Kneel.” Like thunder, the loud booming voice echoed off the walls of the chamber, resonating in the cold dark air. The voice was deep, but sounded young and full of life. Paradise clenched her fists, causing more blood to ooze out of the open cuts on her wrists. <br>
        “I’ve made an offering, but I kneel for no one, not even you.” Paradise sounded unusually calm and confident in such a dangerous statement. There was no response for several minutes.<br>
        “I have called you, but you have come on your own accord. It is for this reason that you are obliged to do my biding.”<br>
        “What is it you want me to do Bertoxxolous, that you yourself are not capable of doing. Have you grown so weak that you must depend on the likes of me?”<br>
        “I need you to do that which can only be done by your hands. You do not know your ancestry, but let me assure you it is of sacred blood. You are the last of my surviving children. It is your destiny to fulfill the ancient prophecies. It is for this reason that I need you.”<br>
        “And how if I refuse to do this task of yours?”<br>
        “You can not.” Paradise made no response. “Within the next 6 nights, a child will be born. This child is your counterpart. She will dedicate her life to destroying you and your followers. You must not allow this child to live.”<br>
        “Thy will be done.” Paradise smiled, revealing rows of sharp pointed teeth. “The path of righteousness leads to death, I will make sure of that. Rest easy Bertoxxolous, I shall protect your empire, and you shall be in my debt.” Paradise opened her eyes and the air reverted back to its former state, thin and intangible. The blood on the ground had disappeared, leaving nothing but the stench of death behind. Paradise whispered a few words into the empty, doorless chamber, and disappeared.<br>
<br>
        Paradise sat at a table. Surrounding her were the elders and leaders from every city and sect in Norrath. The Erudites sat silently, their hoods casting shadows over their already dark faces. Next to them were the Dark Elves, their skin dark and their hair white, with eyes that cut into your soul. The gnomes were gathered together at the far end of the table, speaking softly to each other. The Iksar preferred to stand, motionless, like they were waiting for their prey to get close enough for them to strike. At the head of the table sat Paradise, surrounded on both sides by the humans. With pale skin and black souls, they were the hosts of this gathering. Paradise tapped her finger on her cup, and all noise in the hall ceased. She looked at the leaders of each faction and each one nodded at her, without saying a word. “Well then, it is decided. You have all agreed to help me in my mission. Are there any questions before we convene this meeting?”<br>
        “How are we to find this child? How will we know which one it is that needs to die?” Asked one of the Gnomes. Paradise giggled and smiled wide.<br>
        “Kill them . . . kill them all.” The meeting ended, and so it was that on the 6th moon of the New Year, the world o’er flowed with blood. The Children’s Plague had begun.<br>
<br>
In the next few days, children started disappearing. None of the children were ever missing for too long, for their corpses were often found floating in the sewer or washing up on the beachheads. Some of them didn’t go missing in the first place, they were found dead in their cradles, their beds, or their mothers’ wombs. By the second day parents had started to hide their children in their homes, in crawlspaces, attics, and cellars. It never worked; the children were never safe. Paradise knew that it was a female child, but she decided not to take any chances. Over the next three days, over 30,000 children across Norrath lost their lives, each being murdered in unique and delightfully horrific manner. Paradise giggled softly to herself as the screams of the children filled the normal silence of her hall. She was sure that her reign would not come to an end.<br>
<br>
<br>
Deep within a forest, a continent away, a child was crying. Her skin was pale, and two pointed ears could be seen sticking out from beneath her already long white hair. A High Elf was trying to rock the child to sleep. “Hush hush little one. No tears shall fall from your lovely eyes; you are destined to sit at the head of all tables, to rid this land of evil. Sleep now my child, you will need your rest.”<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
It had been 16 years since the Children’s Plague. Paradise sat in the same throne beneath the city of Qeynos, deep within the temple of Bertoxxolous. She showed now signs of aging upon her face and her voice was as soft and sweet as it had been when she was a child. She had lived, if lived you can call it, each day feeling secure that the child that was destined to destroy her, had been destroyed. She had beaten fate, and that made her giggle.<br>
<br>
A continent away, there was a hall that was very reminiscent of the hall that Paradise sat in. It reminded you of Paradise’s hall in the way that it was the complete opposite. Where Paradise’s hall was pitch black, this hall was filled with light. Where pools of blood had collected in the hall of Paradise, this hall had fountains of holy water. Instead of being hidden away in the sewers below Qeynos, this hall was above ground in the most prominent part of Felwithe. Light cascaded in from the stained glass windows, leaving colorful patterns on the white marble floor. <br>
        The only true similarity between this hall and that of Paradise’s is that sitting in the throne at this hall was also a very beautiful lady. Her eyes were deep blue, and reminded one of the seas on a calm day. Her skin was pale, and her hair was white. Her lips were painted the same deep blue as her eyes, and she had two blue gemstones in the points of her ears. All her clothes where white, save for her blue bootlaces and her blue belt. Much like her counterpart in Qeynos, she was always smiling (although her smile revealed perfect white teeth, that were not at all sharp or pointed). <br>
        “Lady Amun,” began a messenger who had just arrived, “I have a letter for you from the elders. They wait anxiously for your answer.”<br>
        Lady Amun addressed the messenger kindly, motioning for him to rise. “Please, read me their letter.”<br>
        “I can not. It is written in a language that I do not read, its contents are for your eyes only.” The messenger proceeded to hand the scroll to Lady Amun.<br>
        “Very well. I thank you for your speedy delivery of this message. Will you wait outside, I will have you deliver my reply.”<br>
        “Indeed Malady, I will be waiting.” The messenger left the hall, closing the large wooden doors behind him. Lady Amun sat back down in her throne and opened the scroll. The bars were an unusual white color, and the paper was thick and seemed to crack as she unrolled it. The ink was the color of dried blood. The letter was in Ancient Dragon, a language that had not been spoken for thousands of years. Fortunately, she had been well schooled and could read it without difficulty. The letter read as follows:<br>
        “I don’t know if you are, but I am very much aware of your birth right and your destiny. Meet me at the Arena in 6 months, on that night when the moon is at the crest of its arch.”<br>
<br>
        The letter had no signature. But Amun immediately knew that it was not from the elders. She threw the blood, flesh, and bone made scroll into the fire on the side of the hall. She called one of the guards to summon the messenger that had delivered the letter. The guard soon returned to say that the messenger was nowhere to be found, nor did he remember seeing him enter. Amun looked to the heavens for inspiration, then lowered her head and stared at the guard. Her eyes shone with new determination, “Get me Donnyd, he will be able to help.” Despite the look of awe on the guards face, he quickly hurried out of the hall to find the warrior that the Queen had requested.<br>
<br>
        The warrior Donnyd was renowned for his abilities in almost everything. He had long been a protector of truth and righteousness. Whenever a battle was to be fought, good versus evil, he could always be found leading the troops gloriously. Donnyd was also known widely for his courageousness and optimism. It was because of these two attributes, courage and optimism, that Amun had summoned him to her hall. She needed someone to do some investigating behind enemy lines. She needed someone who could blend in with the enemy; in this case, a human. <br>
        Amun, as the letter had hinted at, was indeed very much aware of her birth right and what she was destined to become. She had been raised as royalty, pampered and spoiled from childhood. When she had come of age, the elders had informed her of her calling in life. At first it took some getting used to, but as she trained and honed her skills she became more comfortable with the knowledge that someday she would usher in a new era of peace. The elders had also informed her that everything in the universe had a pair. A twin that she would have to vanquish some day. The elders didn’t seem to know more then that, and so she never really believed it was true. She never really thought there was anyone capable of opposing her. That was until she started to have the dreams.<br>
        She had dreamt one night that she was standing on a storm cloud. Lightning was erupting below her, briefly illuminating the cold black night sky periodically. Thunder shook the heavens, and with each deafening crash, she prayed that she would not fall from her lofty perch. The lightning flashed again, and the sky became ablaze with glorious white light. But the light did not fade, and the thunder ceased to roar. The silence now was almost as deafening as the loud boom of the thunder; she felt that she should scream just to break the overwhelming silence. The light flickered briefly, and she heard giggling. It reminded her of the giggles of her youth, those moments of childish innocence that she had long since left behind. She saw a girl standing not far from where she was. She was dressed in black rags, with no visible jewelry or other such decorations. As she approached the girl, she noticed that her hair was dirty and greasy, knotted and frayed. She took another step and could see that freckling her pale white skin was dark blue and black bruises. Another step closer revealed that what she assumed to be the eyelashes of the girls close eyes, was really thin black thread, sewn into her skin, keeping her eyes closed tight. Lines of dried blood ran from the tiny pinholes down her cheeks and into the corners of her mouth. Her lips were stained a deep red, the color of the sunset, or of blood. She reached out one hand to the girl, wanting to console her, to heal her injuries, to take her from her miserable existence. As she reached out her hand, the girl’s lips slowly began to part. The girl’s lips moved, but no sound came from her mouth. As she mouthed the words, Amun watched and understood. “Your blood will serve as a new sacrament in my faith. Your death will mark a new age of pain and suffering. But I assure you, no one will suffer as greatly as you will, and the pain, I can assure you, will be exquisite.” The girl smiled wide, revealing sharp and pointed teeth. <br>
        Thunder crashed loudly and the darkness returned. Amun was falling through the night sky, looking up at the heavens that seemed to turn its back on her. She fell, never knowing when she was going to hit solid ground. She would always wake from this dream drenched in sweat and screaming. It was this girl that the Queen, Lady Amun feared the most. And it was this girl that she suspected had written her the letter. She would send Donnyd into the human cities to seek out and identify this nightmare of hers.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Donnyd had eagerly accepted the mission. He had wasted no time in returning to Antonica and beginning his investigation. When he arrived in Freeport, he went around to all the local taverns, asking the locals questions concerning the girl. He heard many strange tales indeed, but it was in the caves below the city that he made his most informative find. He had gone down below the city on the advice of an old friend of his, who had lived in Freeport all his life. He said he had heard that a Necromancer lived down there, and went by the name of Opal. Opal would have the answers to his questions, if he could only talk to her without getting killed. <br>
        So Donnyd began his work, first disguising himself as a Dark Knight and then studying for several weeks, learning the few spells of the Shadowed Knights that he had the ability of casting. He then ventured through the secret door in the basement of the tavern by the docks, and made his way slowly to the hideout of the Freeport Necromancers.<br>
        As he got closer to the Necromancer’s lair, the air changed. The very quality of the air became poorer, thicker, and heavier. With every step he took, a great sorrow weighed more heavily on his soul. Instead of turning back like anyone else would have, Donnyd just took it as a sign that he was getting closer, and pushed on. <br>
        When he finally arrived at the lair, he found it to be very un-lair like. It was actually a great hall, chiseled out of the rock. There were many individuals milling about, and as he entered, no one seemed to pay any special attention to him. His disguise appeared to be working. He wandered slowly through the hall, listening to what was being said, trying to hear anything about Lady Amun. He found however that most things were said in a language that he didn’t understand, and the things he could understand were nothing of any importance to him.<br>
        Someone tapped him on the shoulder. “You look like you’re trying to find something.” Donnyd quickly turned and saw a woman standing in front of him, dressed in a dark purple robe. She had the marks of experience on her face, but was not old by any means. Her left eye seemed to twinkle, despite the significant lack of light in the room. <br>
        “I am.” He remembered what his master had once told him when he was still young and in training. He had learned never to reveal too much information about yourself, keep you answers simple and ambiguous; don’t volunteer information. The woman seemed to find his short answer amusing, for she was trying hard not to laugh. “Did I say something funny?” he asked in what he thought was a very non confrontational tone. <br>
        “Do you really think you’re fooling anyone with that disguise?” The girl managed to say between giggles. Donnyd tried not to look surprised or frightened.<br>
        “Apparently I am, for no one has attacked me yet.” Donnyd knew that the woman meant him no harm, his instincts told him that.<br>
        “They have not simply because you pose no threat, and they know you have more important things to do, then die in these tunnels.”<br>
        “What important things do you speak of?”<br>
        “You said you were looking for something.”<br>
        “Yes, I did.”<br>
        “You’re looking for Paradise.” Donnyd laughed politely at what he thought was meant to be a joke.<br>
        “Aren’t we all? Well, those of us that believe in such a place anyway.” The woman smiled and shook her head.<br>
        “Paradise exists.” The woman had a serious look upon her face and a tone of voice that hinted at no joke. Donnyd decided to play along.<br>
        “And what dose a Heretic such as yourself know of Paradise? . . . Perhaps you would tell me how I might get there!” Donnyd laughed at the very idea of it.<br>
        “Alright, it’s simple. Follow the setting sun to the coast. Venture under the city, and you will find Paradise.” Donnyd had a look of bewilderment on his face. “I can tell you know more. Now you must go, or we will kill you here and now.” Donnyd slowly looked about him and noticed that during their conversation, the room had filled with people, all silent, and all staring at him. <br>
        Donnyd very ungracefully slipped out of the hall, and retraced his steps through the caves as he thought about what the woman had told him. ‘Follow the setting sun.’ He shrugged and decided that he would indeed follow the sun, and find . . . paradise.<br>
        When he got back to the house in which he was staying, he wrote a letter to the Lady Amun telling her of what he had seen and heard in the Necromancer’s hall under Freeport, and that he was journeying west. After looking at a map he had decided that the city the woman spoke of was Qeynos, and so in the morning, he began his journey.<br>
<br>
        His journey took many days and many nights. He saw many strange and wonderful things on his journey, but he also saw things that it would have been better not to have seen. These things are what concern us here, for they are the most beautiful. Few things are in fact more beautiful then raw, true, emotion. The purest emotion is pain, for it is not mixed with other emotions. Pain works by itself, consuming a person, devouring their every thought. This is not the pain of a small flesh wound, or a headache, this is the pain that causes suffering. The pain a mother feels as her unborn child is murdered before her eyes, the pain of a young child coming home and finding his family burned alive in their own house. It seemed to Donnyd that everywhere he went, there was this kind of pain. Some would find it a beautiful thing, Donnyd however did not. Donnyd shed tears when he saw the suffering of others. Donnyd, like many heroes, has a tragic flaw. This flaw is the reason evil will always overcome good. His flaw is that of empathy. His ability to feel for the common man, his belief that everyone has the right to a long and happy life; these things are what drive him on, and what will ultimately destroy him. Donnyd learned on his trip that pain is an integral part of the world, just as much as happiness is. But his stubbornness would not let him accept that, and he continued to try and change it. Seven days of journeying, and he arrived in the other great human city: Qeynos. <br>
        He arrived in Qeynos late one afternoon, and decided to get a room and some sleep before he started his investigation. He however, did not have to find Paradise. Paradise would find him.<br>
        He fell asleep quickly tonight, tired from a long journey and grateful to have a bed to sleep in. As his thoughts faded from his conscious to his subconscious the sun slowly set on Norrath. In his dream, he was walking through a grassy field with rolling hills. The sun was shining bright and high in the sky that was the most brilliant blue he had ever seen. Small fluffy white clouds drifted lazily by, and the sound of birds chirping could be heard on the soft breeze. He ran through the hills, feeling a joy and a lightness of heart that he hadn’t felt since a child. He laughed out loud, ‘so . . . this is paradise!’ he thought to himself as he ran through the tall grass. ‘Paradise!’ When he uttered the word a second time, a strange thing happened. The bright yellow sun, erupted with blood, and was consumed by it, soon it could not be seen at all. The blue sky turned black, the tall grass on the hills wilted and died. The earth was hard as rock, and the chirping of the birds had been replaced with the screams of tortured souls. The ground shook as massive towers and walls rose from the ground. The walls disappeared into the fog, and he could not see their tops. They surrounded him, and they seemed miles away. A tower rose from the earth in front of him, this was not made of stone however. This tower was made of bones of every kind and in every state of decay. Blood flowed freely down the center of the tower, and the stench of death was heavy on the air. <br>
        “Welcome to Paradise.” The voice of a girl filled his head, echoing off of the inside of his skull. He fell to his knees, and was too frightened to say anything. “Bleed now . . .” Tiny incisions appeared on his wrists, and blood flowed from them and on to the ground, the blood moved and formed words. “Les vrais paradis sont les paradis que’on a perdu.” (the true paradises are the paradises we have lost.) Donnyd’s eyes grew large and the veins in his forehead popped; the blood ran down his face. As loud as he could manage, he screamed.<br>
        “Who are you??!?!? What do you want from me?!?!?” The pain did not subside, but he found it did not distract him from understanding the girl’s speech; it was as if it was his own voice answering himself, inside his head.<br>
        “If I am not mistaken, it was you that was looking for me.”<br>
        “I . . . I am. . . I was . . .sss…sent by.. th . . the . . .” <br>
        “The Lady Amun.”<br>
        “ye. . .yesss.”<br>
        “Tell her these exact words: ‘Your time is over, soon you will find your paradise, lost.’” The girl giggled then, and Donnyd woke from his dream, screaming. As he sat in bed, trying to gather his thoughts, he had himself convinced it was nothing more then a dream, that is until he saw scars on each of his wrists. The dream had been the most horrific experience of his life. The pain he felt in his dream was real pain, and when he woke up he felt guilty, the kind of guilt that eats away at you and won’t let you rest. Donnyd dared not spend one more day in this city, the evil influence was too great. He set out immediately in the morning for Lady Amun’s hall.<br>
        Donnyd arrived in Lady Amun’s hall in considerably better spirits then he had been in when he had left Qeynos. The long journey across the continent and the ocean had given him time to think. He could not erase the dream from his memory, so he tried to understand it. Perhaps the only understanding he came to was that it was not meant for him, his business in this affair was now over. This is perhaps the only thing that kept him from loosing his mind. The extreme sense of guilt persisted for many weeks after the dream. He had no idea why he was feeling guilty. In the dream it was as if he was responsible for the millions of tortured souls in that horrible place, but now he couldn’t quite place it. Most of the time he tried to ignore it. He thought of his wife who was visiting her sister in the Woodelf city. He longed to see her again.<br>
        When he entered the hall it was as white and pristine as when he had left it. Lady Amun smiled when he entered, she had been eagerly awaiting his news. <br>
        “Hail, brave Donnyd!”<br>
        “Hail, m’lady. It is a blessed sight to see you alive and well again, I have seen many a thing on my journey that would turn lesser men to madness.”<br>
        “Lesser men indeed, but you have returned, our hero is back! You will have to inform us of all your travels, but only after you have gotten some rest. I had the maids keep a bed made for you.”<br>
        “Thank you m’lady, your compassion is matched only by your beauty I believe.” Donnyd turned on his heels and began to make his way out of the hall when the Lady Amun stoped him.<br>
        “But perhaps you will reveal to us the mystery of your return. . . have you discovered who has summoned me thus and has been plaguing my dreams?”<br>
        “I have ma’lady and gladly will I rid myself of this business.” Donnyd’s eyes clouded over black and blood began to drip slowly from the left corner of his mouth. “The Empress Paradise sends you this message: ‘Your time is over, soon you will find your paradise, lost.’ The battle must be fought, one of us has to die.” As Donnyd spit out the last word he felt all his strength leave him, and he collapsed on the floor. Blood was now pouring out of a multitude of soars all over his body and his skin was quickly decaying. His soul was no completely eaten by the guilt, and left his body. <br>
        The Lady Amun would have screamed had she seen this gruesome sight. But she found herself staring at nothing in particular, lost in deep thought. It was her, the one the elders had warned her about. She was real; very, very real. Of coarse she knew what she had to do. She still had six days to get to the arena. Six days until she would fulfill her destiny.<br>
<br>
        With the help of a trusted wizard she found herself standing in the vast open fields of the northern planes of Karana. Amun wasted no time and began her journey, taking with her only one bag that contained bread and a little cheese. She walked, keeping her eyes always on the horizon. She walked for three days directly to the south. On the third day she noticed that she appeared to be the only thing moving to the south. Every animal she saw, every insect and every bird, were moving north as if they were trying to escape something. It was on the evening of the third day that the sun turned red and the sky began to bleed. She walked on.<br>
        As she walked along the coast of the great lake Rathe she plugged her nose. The water had turned bad and could no longer support life. Fish, sharks, and goblins floated to the surface, their skin blue and bloated, eyes glazed over with death. As she approached the arena she dropped her bag. Her pale white skin shimmered in the dim evening light. Her thin blue drapes glittered when she moved, and her white hair only got brighter as the natural light faded. She softly padded her way into the arena.<br>
        She circled her way around the huge stone walls, looking for the entrance. When she found the gap in the wall, she did not hesitate to enter. This was the moment she had been waiting for her whole life. She was at this moment fulfilling her destiny. Inside the large circular arena was a raised platform, and on that platform was a throne. She could see a silhouette seated in the throne. As she moved closer the figure did not move. She kept moving until she was not more then an arm lengths away. She could now see the girl sitting in the chair. Save for a few minor features this girl might have been her twin sister, it was like looking into a mirror. This girl’s hair was jet black and didn’t look like it had seen a comb or a wash in a long time. Her skin was the purest white and her lips were stained a deep red. Amun found herself smiling at the girl. That is until the girl smiled back and revealed two parallel rows of sharp, pointed teeth. “Welcome to Paradise” said the girl in what she had thought was a welcoming tone. <br>
        Lady Amun simply stared back at her, stared deep into the girls colorless eyes. “Heretics such as yourself know nothing of paradise.” She spoke slowly and clearly, obviously trying hard to hide her anger. Suddenly it seemed as though this girl was the cause of all the pain and suffering in the world, everything Amun was trying to destroy. The girls very existence both terrified and irritated her.<br>
        “I know only too well sister.”        <br>
        “Don’t ever call me that”<br>
        “two bodies. . . but one blood”<br>
        “NOOOOOO!!!!!!!” Amun screamed with every muscle in her body. She was screaming for every child that lost his parents, all the parents who lost their children, everyone who had ever had a loved one die. She was letting out the built up frustration of a entire world which was sick of the unrelenting sadness and hurt. The force hit Paradise like a tidal wave. Paradise went flying backward through the air, only stopping when she slammed into the stone wall in the back of the arena. As Amun approached the battered girl, she expected to find her dead. But as she got closer, the sounds of a girls giggle filled her head. The girl stood slowly, and began moving toward Amun. She was coughing up blood, and she limped along like her leg had been broken in the impact. Amun stopped moving and let the girl come to her.<br>
        “Don’t you see what is happening?” paradise struggled with each word, trying to overcome the gurgling sound of the blood that was in her lungs. “Can you kill the girl, without becoming the monster?”<br>
        “Quiet! I’m fulfilling my destiny!” Amun then in one quick motion pulled her dagger from her boot and stabbed it through the heart of the girl Paradise. Paradise fell to the ground of the arena, and stopped breathing. Lady Amun had won. A new era of peace and prosperity would begin. With Paradise dead, the rest of the heretics could be easily found and destroyed. She let out a heavy sigh and began to walk out of the arena. <br>
        A few feet before the entrance she stopped. Something wasn’t right. Things hadn’t changed. The sky was still on fire, and the sun the color of blood. A cool breeze came through and made her shiver. The air slowly darkened and became heavier. She slowly turned on her heels and saw Paradise standing before her once again. Paradise began to speak, her voice no longer something coming from her mouth, but something that was echoing inside Amun’s head. “Death is my power. Your hate has made me stronger.” It was then that Amun remembered the lessons of the elders. ‘you must face her with a pure heart’ they had said. But Amun had not done that. Amun had killed the girl out of hate for evil, and not love for good. Paradise giggled and her eyes flashed. The darkness now surrounded Amun, and consumed her. She began to cry as the pain of thousands of tortured souls became her reality. She closed her eyes and gave in to the suffering, feeling all her strength drain from her body. Some travelers found her a few weeks later. Her heart had been ripped from her chest and her head was nailed to the platform of the arena, pinning down her lifeless body. The last thing that entered her mind (besides the rusty nail) was the voice of a girl who said, “welcome to Paradise.”<br>
