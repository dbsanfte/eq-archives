Despite the fact that the complete and total absence of light had no effect on her ability to see, she still slipped and stumbled on the slippery earth and the multitude of rough bones that were scattered, half buried, piercing the surface. To her right there was a river, to her left there was nothing. The river flowed swiftly but silently. The normal river sounds of rushing water and chirping birds that one is accustomed to hearing were not present. Instead the water lapped at the shore with the sound of screams and of pain. Lost souls who could not find their way to the land of the spirits were tortured in the stream; their blood forming the rushing mass of red that slowly carved away at the shore. She recognized the river immediately although it was quite different than it had always been described in the ancient books. It was Styx; and she was dead.<br>
        From out of the fog appeared an ancient boat, not unlike the gondolas of Venice. The thick wood of the hull was rotting and as it approached it brought with it the smell of dead things. Standing at the back of the boat was a small figure in a large black cloak. <br>
The cloak was drawn tightly about the person, making it impossible to discern identity. Mia knew the drill. As the small boat reached the shore, she stepped on. Silently, the boat turned about and began crossing the river. Just as the shore that she had been standing on disappeared into the fog, the far shore appeared. The boat slowed and came to a stop on the rocky shore. With one skinny hand, the boatman reached out toward Mia. Mia knew what he wanted. “I can not pay your toll.” She said simply and honestly. The same hand moved closer and grabbed Mia by the neck. Lifting her up and holding her over the water, the hood of the cloaked figure fell back and revealed the face. Mia stared into the deep eyes of the demon. The woman who was holding Mia precariously over the side of the boat was Mia. They were the two sides of Mia, fighting over life and death. The hand loosened its grip.<br>
        Mia fell into the rushing blood that made up the river Styx. But this river has no bottom, and she fell for what seemed like an eternity. Then, suddenly, a hand grabbed her and lifted her up and set her down on dry ground. It was the woman from the boat. She had pulled the boat ashore and made a small fire, which Mia now found herself collapsed in front of. Mia watched the other her as she sat silently, seemingly in meditation. When she had caught her breath, Mia began to speak.<br>
        “Who are you?”<br>
        “I am you.” The woman spoke softly and slowly, never opening her eyes.<br>
        “That’s impossible.” Said Mia indignantly. “I am me.”<br>
        “You are right. To be more truthful, I am what you are turning into.” Mia could not help a little giggle.<br>
        “I’m dead. The only thing I’m turning into is lunch for whatever worms find my corpse.”<br>
        “Do you really believe your body the sum total of everything that is ‘you’?”<br>
        “You mean my soul?”<br>
        “Not in the traditional sense. I simply mean your consciousness.”<br>
        “Electrical impulses created by my brain.”<br>
        “Wrong. Those impulses are merely the physical manifestation of your intangible consciousness.” Mia thought about this for a moment, but said nothing. “I am a result of your subconscious. Among other things.”<br>
        “What other things?” Thought Mia out loud.<br>
        “I’ve told you before. I am mostly the physical manifestation of the negative energy in the world. It is your subconscious that makes you a suitable host.”<br>
        “Are you saying you’re going to posses me?”<br>
        “No my child. You will become me. It’s already started . . . surely you’ve noticed.”<br>
        “But what? What am I becoming!?”<br>
        “A god.” Replied the other Mia rather anti-dramatically. “You will notice that your regenerative powers will become far superior to anyother mortal. You will also gain the power to turn your mental energy into physical energy.”<br>
        “Yes,” said Mia dejectedly, “I have noticed those things.”<br>
        “Good, you’re progressing much faster than I had anticipated.” The two Mias said nothing for a very long time. They both stared into the fire, not knowing what to say or do next.<br>
        “Why?” Mia finally blurted out.<br>
        “Because your subconscious provides an excellent . . .”<br>
        “Not that,” Mia interrupted, “what is the purpose of this? What am I supposed to do?”<br>
        “Your job will be to grant every mortal their wish.”<br>
        “Their wish?”<br>
        “All mortals long for the same thing, but are unable or unwilling to bring it about.”<br>
        “What is their wish?”<br>
        “They wish for the apocalypse.”<br>
        “You’re lying.”<br>
        “How else can you explain the great evil that has consumed humanity? Every sin committed by man is a subconscious cry for help.”<br>
        “Help?”<br>
        “They want to be saved from their miserable, pointless, pathetic lives. They want it all to end. The whole world calls out for it, and they have called me here to fulfill their wish.”<br>
        “Is there no goodness left in the world?”<br>
        “None. Only the shadows of happier times.” Tears started forming in Mia’s eyes.<br>
        “I don’t want this.”<br>
        “You don’t have a choice.” The other Mia stood up slowly and looked down upon Mia. “Now you must go. You have work to do.” She turned and started walking off into the fog. Mia called out after her.<br>
        “Wait! What do I do now?” The other Mia turned back and said,<br>
        “When you wake up you will not remember any of this conversation. But it will be burned into the back of your mind, waiting to be rediscovered.”<br>
        “Why won’t I remember?”<br>
        “You must ease into your new life. We can’t have you rejecting us. No. That wouldn’t do at all.”<br>
<br>
        The dark figure of the other Mia peeled away, revealing a horribly bright, white light, forcing Mia to close her eyes. When she opened them timidly a few minutes later, there was a doctor standing over her, holding a flashlight to her eyes. <br>
        “She’s awake.” She heard a nurse say.<br>
        “Good,” said Johnny, “I was ever so worried about her.”<br>
<br>
