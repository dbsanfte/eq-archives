<br>
EQ story:Chapter 2<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp The zombies neared closer to Deebin's short halfling body.He cover his pale face with his arms,he could smell death from the stench of the zombies,they were a living corpse that had been sliced with a sword many times and skin that look mutated.One of the zombies stop and let out a moan of  pain despair and hate.It inched closer and it reached towards Deebins arm but before it could grab it a voice came from above.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;Looo down der!What all ye fussin about!Why don't ye pick on sumone ye own size!&quot;And with that a small figure jumped down and did a flip in the air.He was covered in chainmail armor that looked of a dull grey with even some pieces rusty.In his hands he held a gigantic Bastard Sword and..A bottle of Dwarven Ale!The Dwarf was bald on the top of his head and had much facial hair.Deebin recongized the bottle it said on it &quot;Tumpy's XXX Dwarven Ale!Not for ye weak ones!&quot;.He landed on his feet and lost his balance and fell flat on his back.He jumped back up quickly to his feet.&quot;Why don't all of ye.all of ye, here that ain't living leave dis place right now because me sword right here is bout to be slicin all with the stench of death right now!&quot;The dwarf said as he took another swig of his ale and twirled his sword around.The zombies stood there for a second with a dumb look on their face,confused about what had just happened.One walked forward but as it  moved a sword swung at it, the enormous sword went left missing the body or head entirely but cut off one of his arms.He lifted the sword again and sliced the deathly beassts head off and it rolled onto the ground.The stench and look of it had made it seem like it had been there for months.The zombie let out a shriek of fear and hate then ran off.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;ha, ahaha, That ill, That ill teach Tem not to mess with Dwarfs!Did ye see tat head there roll off haha!Make a fine trophy it will on my wall!&quot;Chuckled the dwarf as Deebin stood there looking at him confused.&quot;Umm,Thank you for coming to my aid.A better time it could not have been.But who are YOU?and Why are you here?&quot;The halfling said in a boggled voice. &quot;Who be me?I am Gothsa the mighty Paladin of Brell Serrilis, well,&quot;He says and takes a drink from his ale.&quot;Ex-Paladin Me guess ye could say!&quot;The dwarf muttered.&quot;Ex-paladin?&quot;Questioned Deebin.&quot;Aye, I kinda got kicked out of me guild,they said I drink too much,that a Paladin should not drink the sweet sweet Dwarven Ale...Well it might also be because of te time when the drink took control of me and I violated the guild leaders daughter..&quot;Gothsa said embrassly &quot;You messed with your guild leader's daughter?What kinda a fool are you?&quot;deebin said&quot;A drunken fool!&quot;Replied Gothsa&quot;Well ye gotta come with me now!&quot;Demanded the dwarf&quot;What are you talking about?&quot;the Halfling awnsered back&quot;I heard ye praying when I was in my tree asleep.Ye said you would become a cleric for Brell!&quot;The dwarf said harshly.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;Wait a second,Why are you even here and why were you in that tree?&quot;Deebin said aggressively&quot;Well,after the guild leader found out about me and his daughter he sentenced me to death,but his daughter pleaded to let me live, so he sent me to this cursed forest to slay the undead that wander this place at night.&quot;Gothsa said &quot;Then why were you sleeping at night if that is when they come out?&quot;replied Deebin. &quot;ye saw those things,they pretty strong.there are stronger ones out here too, I didn't really wanna die out here!It does not matter anymore,I have kiled one of the livin' dead here,saved your life, and I am gonna bring ye back to Kaladim to become a Cleric of Brell!I will be forgivin by him&quot;The stocky dwarf said Proudly.They both stood there or a minute, in the stench of death in a near pitch black night.The silence grew, it grew so strong that their breathing itself was like an avalanche falling of the Everfrost mountains.When finally the halfling spoke&quot;Let us be gone to my house for now,it is dangerous out here in this cursed forest!&quot;<br>
<br>
