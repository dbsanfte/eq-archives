<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Sarhea heard the shout of Saurix, echo through this gnomish junkyard, and she looked around her. Her current companions were safe enough, she thought.  The grey elf, Nakath, would watch over them, and Kagemaru would just 'disappear', as was his habit anyway.<br>
<br>
So her thoughts turned to the Harvesters...her family. Unbidden, Saurix touched her thoughts.</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
'Halfbreed, you had better tell your harvesters that I hunt them. Let them know exactly what allying with you means for their lives. Especially those traitors to Cabilis you insist upon housing.'<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>The halfelf thought quickly about the Harvesters. Not one of them could take the warlord in a one on one fight. Not one. <br>
<br>
The only way she had been able to best him was with the assistance of Nakath, and of his esoteric companions.  She'd agreed to the assistance as a show to Saurix that she was willing to even the odds any way possible.<br>
<br>
Now, though, seeing his wrath, she realized that the only way to face Saurix, was to face him alone, and to protect her family....she would leave it.<br>
<br>
Telling the grey one that she was needed elsewhere, Sarhea made way to Harvester Halls, drinking one of those nasty invisibility concoctions beforehand. <br>
<br>
When she entered the Halls, it was quiet, most were sleeping, but some were on the hunt. She heard talking from behind Kerridwynn and Demaste's door, so she quieted her steps as she passed. <br>
<br>
Kerri would understand, maybe, but not until this was done.<br>
<br>
The halfelf entered her rooms, and hastily grabbed up the few things she'd absolutely need.  After she was satisfied that she'd have everything she needed, she stopped long enough to hastily pen a letter.</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
Cousin,<br>
<br>
My fight with the Empire is not the Harvesters fight.  I know that you feel a personal...hatred of Saurix...but he only went to you because it would hurt me.<br>
<br>
I will not put those I care about in danger, nor will I spend every waking moment worried for your lives. <br>
<br>

<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Then she laid her guildbadge on top of the parchment, drank another swallow of that nasty potion of hiding, and slipped out, into the night, to seek the Grey One.</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>

Demaste murmured a soft inquiry, his arms tightening around her waist.  She quieted him with a light kiss, and slipped out of the bed they shared. </em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> <br>
<br>
&quot;I'll be right back love,&quot; <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>she whispered to him, and padded quietly out of their bedroom and into her office beyond.  She paused again, her head cocked as she listened to the sounds of the quiet keep.  <br>
<br>
She opened her door, looking up and down the hall lined with sleeping quarters.  Most of the rooms showed no trace of light, their occupants either sleeping or out of the hall.  A thin line of light showed under Sarhea's door however, and Kerridwynn made her way down the hall and knocked lightly.  <br>
<br>
There was no answer.<br>
<br>
Frowning, Kerridwynn tried the knob, and the door opened to reveal a hastily ransacked room.  She stepped inside, her eyes scanning the disarray and noting what was missing.  And then she saw the note and the shining guildbadge lying upon it.<br>
<br>
She crossed the room, snatching them both up and reading the scrawled note.  Feeling strangely detached, she noted that Sarhea's handwriting could use a bit of polishing.  When she finished, she clenched the guildbadge tightly in one fist, its' edges cutting into her palm.<br>
<br>
Kerridwynn returned to her room, and handed the letter to Demaste who studied her with a questioning look before reading the letter himself.<br>
<br>
She sat on the edge of the bed and stared at the guildbadge for a time, and then placed it on the table next to the bed.  She turned to Demaste, curling close to him and resting her head on his chest.  They said nothing for a long time.<br>
<br>
Finally Kerridwynn spoke, her voice muffled against his chest.</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->  <br>
<br>
&quot;She's gone to join the Grey One.  She's sought out stronger allies...&quot;  <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Her voice broke as a tear slipped down her cheek, and Demaste tightened his arms around her, holding her close.

Of course she had heard of the former Matron of the halls. Rumors only, as she did not have the chance to speak with her directly.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>&quot;I wonder why she left, this time. Or did she leave. Perhaps she just went into hiding. But hiding from whom.. and why...  Riddles, that searched for answers.&quot;</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
She sat back, thinking. Who could force this warrior to anything she did not desire to do. Who could touch something of hers. She took another sip of wine. It was cold by now, proof of the chill that still surrounded her.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>&quot;She cannot fear for herself. If she did, she would not be the one i <br>
regard that highly. No, she must fear for others.&quot;</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
The glass found its way back to the table, although it did not stay there. It skidded across and shattered on the dusty floor as the truth dawned on her. <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>&quot;Someone was threatening those she cares about, to get to her. Some bastard was not going after her, but after others, not as strong, perhaps.&quot;</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
She rose quickly, caring nothing about the glass, the table, or the mess she left. Few were coming here anyhow. This hall was almost dead. <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>&quot;She has stood for so many. Perhaps now it is time for the many to stand for her, and with her.&quot;</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
With that determination, she closed the door behind her and headed out to find a warrior in hiding - and whatever forced her to hide. It was time to make a stand. <p>Silenae Do'Bauthin<br><br>
