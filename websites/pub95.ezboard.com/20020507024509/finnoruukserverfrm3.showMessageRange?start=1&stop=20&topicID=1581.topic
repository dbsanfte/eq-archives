Sadly, I have been banned from posting even in general open forum where this belongs, and if I had posted it where it belonged it would have had the life expectancy of newborn kitten in a cage full of rabid dobermans. <br>        History is written by the conquers, and I have never been one of those. This isn't a cry for attention or pity, though some who hate me will call it so. This isn't an excuse, though maybe an apology in some ways, an accusation in others. <br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp To know trust in a person first you must know that person, sadly many people in life tend to think they know someone else based upon the limited ways they know themselves. Even I have been guilty of this. People talk of things being grey, never black and white, but grey exsists only in the hearts and minds of the people, never in right and wrong, never in truth or lie, and never in good and evil.<br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Who am I? Is a question none of us can ever answer for each second, every action, every decision, every thought changes who we are. We can only ever know who we have been. The person I have been isn't a great person, not perfect by any stretch of the imagination. My one strength is that Im a survivor, my one redemption is that I care. I am an ex drug addict, a recovering alcoholic, spent 2 years homeless, sleeping in storm drains and eating from dumpsters, attemped suicide twice, been dead once and I promise you that is never an answer. They say those things that don't kill us make us stronger, but thats not true, those things that don't kill us take another piece of our souls, and leave us more tired, and more desperate. I've been an artist, a poet, and thru it all a dreamer, for the dreams are the only part that keeps me sane.<br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp I have alot of hate and anger inside me with good reason, every day of my life it wages an internal war against the love and caring thats the person I want to be. Its not always a clear victory for me, or for those about me who try and care for me. For the pain others have suffered for loving me or trying to care about me, I am so truly and deeply sorry. I know that caring about me isnt worth it to you, and I dont blame you for that. <br><br>Decisions we make determine the person we are<br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp I have given this more thought than anyone could ever know, I've spent hours upon endless hours compiling endless evidence in the form of screenshots, logs, copies of email, copies of AIMs, copies of post. I could trash Fortress of Honor, and raise enough questions as to their character to cause them great pain and suffering. Yet, to what end? Revenge? Vindication? Dirty words of hate and anger, and not the person I wish to be. Not the way I wish to be remembered when its all said and done.<br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp The time I spent in Fortress of Honor was happiest I've ever been in my life, was the one pure joy I've ever known, not just in the game, but in my whole life. I wanted to fight to hold on to that, but in so doing I began to destroy it. Its so hard to let go of something you truly love when you've never loved anything ever, its so easy to blame others for your own faults, your own weaknesses, your own mistakes. No more! I @#%$ up, and I lost the only thing I've really ever cared about, the only thing that ever made me happy, and now its over and its time for me to accept that. I'll live the rest of my life in regret, hating myself for my own failures, but I won't trouble the people I love ever again.<br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Im sorry I wasnt good enough, Im sorry I failed you, and so sorry I hurt any of you.<br><br>Fair winds, smooth seas, all my heart, all my love, forever and always.<br><br>Mysste  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#f7f7f7><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub95.ezboard.com/ubixenedar.showPublicProfile?language=EN>BixenEdar</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/globalWhite.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Dubious Poster</span><br> <font color=#778899>(4/13/02 3:19:05 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: When love and hate collide..</span><hr size=1> Mysste, I admit that I don't know you, but I am very surprised by your words of response to a computer game.

You claim to have spend hours upon hours taking screenshots and logs and making evidence of rants and flames coming from people that you love ?? if you love FoH then why would you spend hours doing that ?? well maybe it was going to be used in trying to manipulate yourself into a higher position within the guild and when you failed at it you had to come out here on a public forum and spread your vicious @#%$ about people that you claim to love....<br><br>-Halbred<br><br>Gamiene I recognize what you re trying to say, but at this stage this is not about hurt feelings anymore, its about trying to help Mysste realize what she s doing to the people that she claims to love, and maybe that way she can get help herself.

You are just proving us right with this whole thread with every post you make.<br><br>You had 3 chances, THREE, and ruined them all with your own doing.
