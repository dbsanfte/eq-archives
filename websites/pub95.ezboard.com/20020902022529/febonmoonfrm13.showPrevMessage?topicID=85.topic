<br>
To do this, I need to know what you want.<br>
<br>
There are many purposes to a guild, some are heavily raid oriented, some are after &quot;phat loot,&quot; and others have thier own goals...<br>
<br>
Shadows of the Ebon Moon began as a Role-Playing guild, as we began to grow, we also became a &quot;helper guild.&quot;  Overall, I think we are mainly a &quot;social&quot; guild...<br>
<br>
So what do you want?  What changes would you like to see?  What can we do differently?  What should we keep the same?<br>
<br>
Let me hear your opinions please...<br>
<br>

He also wants his epic. He also wants his full line of CoV quest armor, and I want to do the friend of the Tunarean Court quest with him. <br>
These quests are &quot;uber&quot; for lack of a better word. I'm by no means suggesting that Shadows turn into an &quot;uber&quot; guild. I like our &quot;helper guild&quot; status. Some of us will be &quot;uber&quot; levels though, and I for one wanna do &quot;uber&quot; stuff ocassionally. The battle with Faydedar that's part of my epic is definitely &quot;uber&quot;. I want Shadows to be capable of doing that, not that we will all of the time. I just wanna be able to.<br>
Fae will always be a Shadow. He knows nothing else.<br>
As noted below, we have a great companionship going here. I love it and this is the reason Fae will never leave. I would probably lose interest if I were to go off and join an uber-guild. From what I see of them (I've seen a couple of 10th ring battles and a raid on Kael Drakkel) they spend all their time raiding and seeing what drops they can get next. <br>
I try to keep Fae available to help others at all times. I have yet to charge for a SoW, bind, or port. (I do get some rather nice donations, sometimes, hehe.) I've been in some really cool groups with family, questing and just fighting.<br>
I don't ever want to raid all of the time. I can do that kind of stuff by myself in other games. I play because of Shadows. This is a &quot;family&quot;. It makes EQ that much more fun. I think raids, and the ability to go on them, will make the family stronger. We won't have people leaving. It hurts Fae to see someone has left us because they are bored.<br>
Alliances are a great idea. That could get us started with a larger member base. People won't leave because we're not raiding. They'll stay with us. Heck, this family is cool. It grabs the imagination.<br>
You're doing a great job Kelwin. It must be very hard to do what you do. I, and I think I can speak for the rest of us, really appreciate you.<br>
Keep up the good work,<br>

<br>
I am going to have to work on an alliance with one of the uber guilds to set up things like this for our members...<br>

I realize that as a helper guild, we do not retain players as they advance in levels for just this reason...

I have played this game for probably to long but the one thing that has kept me going is the people that surround me.  I could have never done anything without Cendarien in my early levels or Selovare at my newbie levels.  They were always there to help and got me out of my newbyish ways.  Once I joined the shadows it was a totally different experience.  I only kept in touch with a couple people but now i have a whole 'family' to keep in  touch with.  Its fun to watch the progression of a character...the high points along with the low points.  I also like the way everyone is willing to help everyone out.  That is probably a strength that this guild needs to keep building off of.  Now, I understand that there are going to be those that will go there seperates ways and will always want to do things seperate from the guild but the things I want from the guild are very simple: Friendship.<br>
<br>
With friendship I have gotten Blackpoint to where she's at.  With friendship I have gotten Whitepoint to where she's at.  I do things to help the guild and I expect that from everyone else...hopefully at the same time.<br>
<br>
The only weaknesses we have are just our lack of healers that limits really big raids but in time that will change.<br>
<br>
I would also like to mention that even with the departure of two of the greatest people i have ever met we have stayed strong and stuck through the transition.<br>
<br>
Kelwin..your doing a great job...and I can only guess how hard it is to keep up with it.<br>
<br>
Cendarien...my little dirt eating husband...Your terriffic also.  As your wife ( <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  ) I will gladly take care of any trivial task that would lessen your burden.............for a price...<br>

Uber raids is what I wanted when I originally joined the guild (knowing what my epic quest is gonna be like you might want to get 2 other guilds as friends Kel). But now that I've been a part of the family for some time, I feel that the companionship that I have gotten here couldn't be replaced by any NPC only style game that I have ever played. I have only been playing EQ ever since I installed it, and several very good single player games remain on my hard drive still at their original save position that I left them in when I started EQ. Without the companionship that I have gotten out of this guild, I would have probably lost interest in EQ. It's more then just the raids and bettering my character. Now I find myself going out of my way to help a family member, or do something that will help the family as a whole. The only thing that I really want is that we not lose this kinship. Recruiting is great, brings new fresh blood into the family, but let's not lose what has made us great. I have had people coming up to me and saying &quot;I hear really great things about your guild&quot; all the time, it makes me proud to be a Shadow. So basically I guess I'm saying... keep up the good work Kel and others <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

Firstly I would like to comment on the comradery I think this is the only thing that has kept me sain lately because I have had a lot of RW things happening but I always know that I can log on the EQ and log off the real world in a sense here I have so many friends that I joke with and talk to and they make my life all around a little easier. I don't really know about raids that is merely a side street it will help the guild but I could do with out it and I'm willing to work with our new raid master *pouts a little because minimum level set for this raid is 24 and I'm only 19*. I think the new recruits are for the most part a good thing because even though they far surpass me its always nice to see new faces. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  I really think the thing that I want most is a good structure where everyone knows everyone else that way there is always some one to talk to and I really appreciate all those who picked up the reigns after the loss of our dear friends.  <p></p><span class=m><i></i></span><hr size=1><span class=m> Posts: <b>4</b>  </span></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td colspan=2><table cellpadding=8 cellspacing=0 width=100%><tr><td nowrap width=20% valign=top><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub95.ezboard.com/ufaedaerryverwalker.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Faedaer Ryverwalker</A> </span><br> <span class=usertitle>Raid Master</span><br> </td><td valign=top width=80% class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_question_mark.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: What do YOU want from the Guild?</span><br><span class=m><font color=#778899>Posted: 10/12/01 4:05:22 am</font>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>   &nbsp;&nbsp;<a href=http://pub95.ezboard.com/febonmoonfrm13.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=86.topic&index=7><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/ultimate/reply.gif border=0 width=20 height=20 alt="reply to this message" align=absmiddle></a>   <hr size=1> Sign up as a reserve, anyhow.

I've been around with the Shadows since the days of Mordaki, and I have seen people come and people go.  I've enjoyed my time with the Shadows, and I think I would of lost interest a time ago too if I wasn't a part of this Guild.  Some of you may recall me under my old character name of before, and a blackened day fell before him by the delete key.  Once I returned under this dwarven body a Shadow helped me get back to where I once was.  A time ago I was with another Guild that their beliefs are strength in numbers, or jus want to have a Guild tag on their name to seem important.  I bet my bottom copper I wouldn't have been helped by that Guild as I was with this one. As Blackpoint stated there is a small number of us Clerics with-in the Guild, but I'm watching that number grow now.<br>
<br>
So anyhow I believe we are a Guild to be reckoned with.  Our name is carried far and wide with nothing but praise.  If you are in search of an Uber guild Kelwin, I've known one Guild that I have a great deal of respect for.<br>
