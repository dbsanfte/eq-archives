Waterproofed from the outside, but when the water is more than a foot deep, it is hard to keep any part of you dry.  It never could be easy.  I guess it never would be, for that is the life Jhanel had chosen.  He just wish he had agreed with that choice.<br>Jhanel looked high above him.  The rain blurred his vision but he could see his goal.  A house lay deep inside the woods he was within.  The clearing marked the entrance to this private residence.  Jhanel approached it with caution.  His dark black cloak pulled at him as the wind came underneath his clothes.  He drew it tighter with both arms and began to go up the path.  The trees grew lighter revealing the small clearing that was his destination.<br>The grass rustled with the steadily increasing winds.  Rain coursed his body.  Jhanel’s hair matted down by the dampness it had been abused with for the past hour.  The house grew closer and a couple of torches began to show what was hidden back at the clearing.  The light revealed two black figures resting against the house.  They were guards.<br>“I could have sworn he said no guards?” Jhanel looked down for a spot to kneel.  He found some grass that had grown higher and bent down to get a better look.<br>There were two guards manning the front door.  Both of them sat on the left and right staring out into the night.  The boss had made it clear to them that tonight was to go without any interruptions and they knew he meant it.<br>The door opened to the house revealing another black figure, “Pretty damn good storm.”  The guard held a container in his hands.  He slowly raised it up to his hands and drank the cold water that was contained inside.  <br>Jhanel looked down at the ground.  “I can’t believe I’m going to do this.”<br>The guard on the left replied, “Tell me about it Gunthar.  I never would have expected this.  It’s almost as if we were going to fail the master anyway.  We can’t hear a thing with the wind blowing as it is.”<br>Slayne, the guard on the right looked up at him.  “Quit it with that talk.  You know if we screw this up we better be dead if what the master says is true.  That damn rogue is probably staring at us right now.”<br>Jhanel smiled.  He heard the remark and couldn’t help but smile.  “They talk about me as if I was some sort of god.” Jhanel removed his cloak.  He reached over and bent some tall grass and bent it down so he could lay his cloak on it without getting it soiled with mud.  He removed a small bag from his belt pouch and undid the drawstrings holding it closed.<br>The three guards looked out towards the open field.  Looking for anything suspicious.  Gunthar turned around, “I’m going to the bathroom, take the watch.”<br>“Dammit Gunthar, if you keep drinking that water all night your going to miss everything.”  Slayne turned to face the field again.  The door closed behind him and now only Slayne and the other guard remained.<br>Jhanel removed his sword from its scabbard and placed it on the ground.  His sword was smaller than the average long sword.  It had a dark blade with a pearly white hilt.  Jhanel looked down on it for a moment and realized how his sword reminded him of everything he was.  He placed the hilt of the sword on top of his cape.  He removed the object from inside the pouch.  A small blue sapphire tumbled out into his hand.  The wind blew it back into Jhanel’s palm.  He held it up to his face to get a good look at the blue sphere he held.  Jhanel shrugged his shoulders and placed it in the slot on the hilt of the sword.  It snapped into place revealing nothing more than a beautiful ornament.<br>“Magical, hmph, If I would have known it would make my sword look like a child’s toy I would have said no,” Jhanel picked it up and approached the building.<br>“So your new to the faction then?” Slayne turned to the guard.<br>The other guard didn’t reply.  He slowly walked away towards the opposite end of the porch.<br>“Fine, don’t talk to me,” Slayne turned around and walked towards the other side.  Lightning danced across the sky unevenly.<br>“I wonder why he needs so many guards tonight.  He only has the girl with him and she was pretty easy to capture.  That village we burned down was pretty pathetic,” Slayne thought to himself.  “You should have been there.  We destroyed this town to find this girl.  They were all god praising bastards.  I enjoyed killing them.  They would hold there hands up to me in prayer, begging for there lives.  I asked them, “Where’s your God now?”  I don’t remember you being there though.  Were you there?”<br>        The only reply Slayne heard was the wind blowing through the deck.<br>        “Didn’t you hear me?” Gunthar turned to see his partner on the ground.  “What the hell?”<br>        Jhanel came around from the other side and jumped kicked the guard against the wall.  With a thunderous thud, the guard fell to the ground.  Jhanel searched the body for any type of weapon and found nothing but the sword at his side.  The other guard began to stir.  Jhanel reached down for his sword and unsheathed it into the rained night.  The blue jewel emitted a low blue aura around the blade casting a blue shadow of Jhanel onto the side of the house.  The guard stood up holding his head, with a hand on his weapon.  Jhanel struck swiftly and soon the guard was back on the ground, permanantly.  Jhanel glanced over his shoulder and Slayne remained motionless on the deck.  The door to the outside opened and the biggest of the guards Gunthar walked out.  He quickly saw Slayne and the other guard on the deck.  He glanced at the figure ahead oh him.  Gunthar removed the great sword from his back.<br>        Jhanel took a step back.<br>        “I will kill you for what you have done.”<br>        Jhanel didn’t answer.  He stepped back away from Slayne and positioned himself in a defensive stance.<br>        Slayne swung down with the large sword but missed Jhanel.  The sword sliced the wooden planks beneath it sending splinters into the air.  Slayne removed it and swung again into the side of the house.  Jhanel’s sword met Slayne’s but was batted aside by the tremendous force Slayne had applied.  Jhanel jumped off the porch of the house out into the open field.  The rain still came down in sheets and soaked Jhanel instantly again.  Slayne turned towards his attacker and walked around the porch and down the steps.<br>        “You are a fool for coming here,” Slayne yelled out.  “The master already knows you’re here.”<br>        Jhanel didn’t answer.<br>        “No answer huh.  You must be the one we were protecting the master from.  You might have been good enough to kill the other two, but I won’t be so easy.”<br>        “It appears not,” Jhanel replied.<br>        “Oh, he speaks.”<br>        “Why don’t you reconsider this action?  You can still live.  I don’t want to kill another for a cause so meager.”<br>        “Surely you jest,” Slayne twirled his gigantic sword up so it rested on his shoulders.<br>        “I do not.  The man that sent me is paying me very well.  I don’t care about this crusade between your master and my employer.  It sounds ridiculous to me and I wanted no part of it.”<br>        “Then why are you here?”<br>        “Like I said, he paid well.”<br>        Slayne dropped his sword down into an offensive position.  Jhanel did the same.  The both looked into each other’s eyes trying to find a moment of weakness.  A moment to strike and end this battle, but neither the stinging rain nor howling winds made either flinch from the other.  Jhanel looked down at the blue jewel he placed into his sword.  It was barely visible in the darkness.<br>        Slayne noticed this and attacked.  He charged Jhanel and swung his huge sword but Jhanel looked back up and blocked his attack.  He flipped over doing a handspring backwards to face his opponent once more.  Jhanel attacked with a downward slice but met the metal bracer on Slayne’s arm causing a small spark.    Slayne came across with his unarmed hand and punched Jhanel back off.  Jhanel fell into the damp earth below him.  He felt his jaw but had no time to check it, he rolled out of the way as Slayne slammed his sword down into the mud.  Jhanel rolled back and round kicked Slayne’s feet out from under him causing the giant to fall.  The mud soaked water splashed up as Slayne fell.  Jhanel got up and regained his composure.  He could feel blood from inside his mouth beginning to pool inside his lips, he turned to his side and spat it out.  Slayne rose to his feet, the mud and water blurred his vision.  Jhanel lowered his sword and charged the behemoth head on and found his mark on Slayne’s right shoulder piercing his flesh.  Slayne reacted with a howl.  Jhanel removed his sword from Slayne’s shoulder.  Slayne charged forward and brushed Jhanel back.  Jhanel staggered back.  Slayne found his feet again and stood up.  His lumbering sword was staring to show its burden.  Weight.  With his injured shoulder, Slayne was not as effective as he was moments before.<br>        “Give up, you are injured.  I do not see honor in continuing this fruitless battle,” Jhanel said.<br>        “I will defeat you warrior, or I will die.  I do not know the meaning of mercy, and nor do I ask it to be granted upon me,” Slayne replied.  Slayne swung the gigantic sword in a big horizontal slash.  Jhanel dropped to the ground and could feel the air that the sword had cut pass over him rapidly.  Jhanel peered back up and saw that he had swung to hard for with his weakened arm and caused him to loose his balance.  Jhanel pointed his sword in Slayne’s direction and closed his eyes.  The jewel inside began to glow a soft blue color.  It radiated lightly in the dark rain but bright enough to catch Slayne’s eye.  Slayne paused, regained his composure, and began to attack Jhanel again.  He raised his arms high into the air for his final attack.  Jhanel suddenly opened his eyes while Slayne attacked.  The motion was to fast for Slayne to calculate but he already knew he had missed and made a critcal mistake.  He could feel his life force leaving his body rapidly and could only do what dying men can only do.  Die.<br>        Jhanel removed the sword from deep within Slayne’s body and looked back towards the house.  He looked at the hulking body lying face first in the mud.  Jhanel turned back and ran to the front door.<br>        The door opened slowly.  Faint light from the torches outside lit the interior.  <br>The room was small with no furnishings except for a small table and two chairs.  Another door was open across from him.  Jhanel stepped inside to hear voices.<br>        “Your life as you know it is over.”<br>        “You fiend, my father will save me.”<br>        “That must be her,” Jhanel said as he approached the door.<br>        “Your father does not control this territory.  I doubt he will cross to save you.  It would mean the death of many from the inpending war between Kerrellious and Dimfire.”<br>        Jhanel lightly stepped across the room and looked inside the door.  A stairway led down and a light was visible from there.<br>        “Your power is nothing compared to my father’s.  His wizards are ten times more powerful.  You cannot expect to take the castle so easily.”<br>        “You misunderstand my intentions.  I am not attacking your castle.”<br>        Jhanel said to himself, “What am I getting involved in?”  Jhanel touched the first step and began to shift his weight on the step.  No noise.  He followed the same routine down the steps while the two babbled about saving or destroying the kingdom.  Jhanel made contact with the solid earth and turned into the doorway.  It was lit by torches and he could see two figures, one hovering over the other.  One was definitely female.<br>        The female figure turned suddenly to see Jhanel in the door.  Her kidnapper saw her glance and turned also to see Jhanel.<br>        “Who are you and how did you get down here?” the man said as he stepped away from the woman.<br>        “My name is of no importance.  I am here for the girl.”<br>        The man laughed, “You must be joking, don’t make me call my guards down here to.”<br>        “There all dead,” Jhanel interrupted.  “I killed them myself.”<br>        The man looked confused for a second but slowly a smile crossed his face, “Do you know who I am?”<br>        “I am unaware of your name and for that matter don’t care.”<br>        “You are as careless with your actions as you are with your tongue.  I can kill you where you stand without any more effort than blinking my eyes.”<br>        Jhanel didn’t reply.<br>        The man suddenly raised his hands into the air to reveal his frail form.  The robe he wore hid most of his body but the short sleeves on the robe exposed his arms.  A small light began emit on the tips of his fingers.<br>        Jhanel followed the magical silhouette the magician made knowing that he had to be quick to get out of the way.  He placed his hand down on his sword and waited on the tips of his toes, “Don’t look!”<br>        The woman turned her attention from her captor and looked at him, “What?”<br>        “Don’t look,” but the wizard had lowered his hands and fired a bolt of fire straight at Jhanel.  Jhanel removed his sword and the jewel inside the hilt glowed brightly while Jhanel swung the sword forward emitting a quick shield from the fireball and redirected the bolt of fire back towards its source.  The wizard lowered his frame as the ball of fire passed over exploding against the wall lighting the room for a brief period.<br>        Jhanel looked over towards the woman and noticed that she was wearing no clothes.  The dim room made her look like she was wearing something but to his surprise she wasn’t.  “What’s going on here?”  He ran over, grabbed her by the arm and dashed towards the room.  She resisted.<br>        “Lets go,” Jhanel yelled.<br>        “Who are you?” she asked.<br>        “I will tell you when we are free of this place.”<br>        “For you friend, it will,” came a voice from the doorway.<br>        Jhanel looked forward and saw the guard he had thought to knock unconscious.  Jhanel let go of the woman and ran towards the door to attack the guard.  The wizard though had regained his composure and grabbed the girl.<br>        “Let go of me,” the woman screamed.<br>        Jhanel turned to see her.  He stopped in mid track and ran back towards the wizard.<br>        “We will meet again,” the wizard proclaimed and a bright light emitted from his body and flashed Jhanel’s eyes.  He was blind.  He could feel his feet falling over each other as he tried to find a wall but all he could feel was the open space of the room.  Jhanel stumbled to get his bearings when he heard the guard running towards him.  The guard rose his weapon into the air and sliced down towards Jhanel.  Jhanel felt a tugging against his arm and fell down to his left.  The guard missed and his sword hit the wall and split apart from the hilt rendering him defenseless.<br>        Jhanel felt around and found the hand that had grabbed him.<br>        “I can’t see.”<br>        “Hold on.”<br>        There was a small noise and a smell of burnt air followed by the sound of something falling to the ground.<br>        “I will guide you out.”<br>        Jhanel could feel the hand again grab him by the arm and lead him through the room and up the stairway.  Soon they were outside again in the rain and he could feel the wetness again come over him.  He looked up towards the sky to let the water soak his eyes.<br>        “Wait here.”<br>        Jhanel rubbed his eyes and bent over.  His vision was returning slowly.  It would take only a couple more minutes until he could see again.  Thunder filled the sky and lightning danced from one side of the horizon to the other.  Jhanel looked back towards the house and slowly it came back into focus.  A figure hung in the doorway.<br>        “Who are you?” Jhanel asked.<br>        The figure came into the porch light.  The torches flickered by the wind and the rain still made it hard to observe anything, but it was enough for Jhanel to see.  It was the woman from downstairs.  She had taken the cape from the dead guard on the porch and wrapped it around her.<br>        “My name is Alexia.  Alexia Stormbringer of Lylan.   Princess of Lylan and guarding of the Temple of Roe.”<br>        Jhanel contorted his face.  He made his way towards the house.<br>        “You look puzzled?” Alexia asked.<br>        “I am sorry.  I guess I should thank you for saving me down there,” Jhanel said as he walked up the stairs.  He stood no more than three feet from her.<br>        Alexia smiled, “I should do the same.”<br>        The both stared at each other for a second until Jhanel finally spoke, “Who was that man.”<br>        “A man you should not cross again.  He is a powerful wizard from another place.”<br>        “What place would that be?”<br>        “I cannot say unfortunately,” Alexia answered.<br>        “Then what was he doing with you?”<br>        “He was trying to kill me.”<br>        “What for?” Jhanel turned to grab a torch.  He brought it up to face Alexia.  It revealed her blonde hair and white pearly skin.  The black cape hid most of her except for her arms and lower legs.  She was smaller than Jhanel but not by much.  Her face bore the marks of abuse.  Her right cheek was bruised and she had a couple scratches on her face.  Her body told another story.<br>        “It is a long story,” Alexia answered.<br>        Jhanel went into the house, “Well, you’ll have time to tell me while we head back into town.  In the meantime, what did they do with your clothes.”<br>        Alexia didn’t speak.  She looked down towards the ground, her body still trembling from the cold, “I don’t know what they did with my clothes.  They were removed forcefully from me.”<br>        Jhanel looked around the room.  There was nothing around except for the table and chairs.  He turned back towards her but she had moved away from the doorway.  Jhanel walked back towards the doorway to see her leaning against the house sobbing.  He opened his mouth but then closed it.  The rain came down harder than before and the blood from the one guard on the deck began to create a small river down the porch steps and into the rain where it mixed with mud and water.  He knew the life as a rogue would bring about him harsh treatment and emotionless battle, but he could only feel sorrow for Alexia.  She had been missing for three weeks.  He had freed her from her captives and unknowingly saved him when she struck down the last guard.  He would ask her later about that but it was times like these that god could create no answer for the misjustices brought against her.  He turned away from the door and walked back inside.<br>        Jhanel pulled out one of the chairs and sat down at the table.  He thought to himself, “We will leave tomorrow when daylight hits.  I’ll gather her something to wear and something to eat for the both of us.”  Jhanel looked back outside and watched the lightning give visibility to the rain.  It was soothing.  Relaxing.  Jhanel then lowered his head and fell asleep, exhausted.<br> <br>Chapter II – Questions of Fate<br>        The sun lit up the room.  It was as Jhanel has thought it to be.  Barren.  He awoke to find the rain had left.  The smell from last night’s storm still lingered in the air.  He stood up from the chair and removed his long black cape.  Beneath it, Jhanel wore a simple coat of leather armor.  Form fitted for traveling conditions, and it had been dyed black instead of the usual brown.  Very plain except for a couple gouges and slashes from previous battles, Jhanel undid the drawstrings in the front to loosen it.  He pulled it above the armor over his head and placed it on the ground.  A small white shirt was underneath.  The white was hidden from the soil that caked it.<br>        “Nice shirt,” Alexia said from the doorway to outside.<br>        Jhanel looked up and noticed she still wore the same cape she took off the guard, “I’d say the same to you but you have no shirt.”<br>        Alexia looked at him and turned away.  She proceeded to walk back downstairs to where the she was held captive.<br>        “Always had a way with women,” Jhanel said to himself.  He followed her back down the stairs where he had fought the wizard.  It was a quick skirmish.<br>        Alexia looked around the room.  The torches still burned dimly but enough to see around the perimeter of the room.  She searched cautiously.  Scared.  Timid.<br>        “What are you looking for?” Jhanel asked as he asked.  He had sat watching her.  Waiting to see if she would find what she was looking for.<br>        Alexia didn’t answer.  She crouched down and started sifting the loose dirt through her fingers.  She was having a hard time trying to regain her bearings from last night, but the more she thought about it the slower her actions became making her more transparent than she already was to Jhanel.<br>        “What is wrong?  You’ve searched the same area more than enough times.  I will glady help if you tell me what your looking for?”<br>        “It is of no concern Jhanel.  Leave me be,” she snapped back.  She cocked her head to look at him.  He stood up leaning against the archway into the room.  His mouth opened to speak but he closed it just as fast.  She knew he had done nothing wrong.  Hell, he had saved her life.<br>        “I’m uh, going to go upstairs and prepare to leave.  When your finished I’ll be waiting,” Jhanel turned and began to walk back up the stairs.<br>        The room echoed with the creak of the stairs, each step showing the poor craftsmanship of the staircase and echoing deep into Alexia’s soul.  She fell to her knees and crawled forward.  Her hands digging deep into the soot, she was making small valleys in the floor.  The search was hopeless.  She knew it wasn’t here.<br>        Jhanel tucked everything back into his pack.  He never carried much with him.  It was only the most useful of utensils that he would need.  He placed his tunic back on and pulled the drawstrings tight to bind it up on him.  He walked over to the window and checked out the day.  It was still sunny.  The clouds had recessed back.  It was going to be a nice day.<br>        He turned away and pulled the pack up onto his back and laced his arms through to secure it.  Jhanel positioned his sword out of the way and began to walk towards the staircase.  He looked down really quick but only saw the flickering light of the torches through the archway.<br>        “Alexia?” He raised his voice up barely so that she would hear him.<br>        She didn’t respond.<br>        “Alexia?” He asked again but was met with the same answer before.  Silence.<br>        “Alexia!” No answer.  Jhanel began to walk down the stairs.  Each step making the same noise from before, an eerie creaking filled the hallway.  “What is she doing?”  Jhanel turned the corner and saw her sitting there with her hands on her face.  She was sobbing.  He watched for a couple minutes not saying anything knowing from before how she had treated him.<br>        “It’s hopeless.”<br>        “What is?” Jhanel responds.<br>        Alexia removed her hands from her face.  Her soil stained hands smearing dirt and dust along her cheeks.  Her silky white skin was now marred by the brown discoloration.  “I was supposed to find something down here.  It was a piece from an amulet that should have been left here for me to recover.”<br>        “Recover?” Jhanel questioned.<br>        “Yes, recover.” <br>        “I don’t understand.  You were his prisoner.”<br>        “Yes, I was.”<br>        “But why?  Was that the plan?  Was someone here before you?” Jhanel shot question after question at her.<br>        “You couldn’t possibly fathom what I’m truly doing here?”<br>        “Try me.”<br>        “I can not.  You are an innocent that got caught at the wrong place in the wrong time,” Alexia stood up.  She brushed her hands off by rubbing them together while she made her way towards Jhanel.<br>        “I was sent here to rescue you though.  That is why I am here.  I was paid in advance and am promised more when I return with you,” Jhanel stepped into the doorway to block her exit.<br>        “Have you ever questioned fate Jhanel?” Alexia asked.<br>        Jhanel looks down at the top of her head.  She glances up.  Her dirt-covered face was partially hidden by her hair.  She brought her hand up and moved a portion of it behind her ear.  Her eyes captivated Jhanel for a moment.  He could feel himself being drawn in but slowly he turned away.<br>        “No, I haven’t,” Jhanel replied.<br>        “Why?”<br>        “Because I have never been asked too?”<br>        “Do you think meeting me here was on chance then?”<br>        “No, it was a job I accepted with little to no risk.  Or so they told me.  Hell Alex, if it wasn’t for me you would be…” Jhanel spoke his words carefully, “ you would be stuck with that wizard guy doing who knows what.”<br>        “Like I said before Jhanel, you have no idea,” Alexandria picked herself up and brushed the loose dirt off her hands.  She knew she had made her point quite clear the first time but it obviously wasn’t reaching the destination she hoped for.  “Are you always this bull headed?”<br>        “Bull headed?” Jhanel replied.<br>        “Yes, I can’t think of a better word for it.  I thought I had made myself …”<br>        “Fine, I’m going back up.  I offered my help but you wouldn’t take it so fair is fair.  I’m going outside and waiting.  Please make haste.  We must leave before noon in order to reach Lilan before nightfall.”<br>        Alexandria rose to her feet and walked towards Jhanel.  She brushed by him and made her way up the stairs.  She walked determined to the top, turned the corner and was out of sight.  The only thing giving her position away was the creaking of the old house.  Alexandria could see a bucket of water sitting outside.  She walked outside, picked the bucket up and moved to the side of the house.  A stump from a pre-existing tree made the perfect seat for her.  The rain from last nights storm was cold to the touch but it would have to do in order to clean the dirt and grime off her hands and face.  Alexandria exhaled heavily.<br>        Jhanel made his way to the top of the stairs and could hear the splashing of water outside.  He shook his head wondering if she was going to be this pleasant the whole trip.  “I should ask for more when this is through,” he thought to himself.   He checked his gear one last time.  It was all there.  He bothered with the idea of giving her a few more minutes of bathing but it was beginning to get later than what he had anticipated.<br>        Jhanel walked outside and peered around the corner to make sure she was at least dressed, “Are you ready yet?”<br>        “One moment,” she replied.  She reached down and splashed a handful of water on her face and rub diligently to remove the last traces of dirt.<br> <p><img src="http://home.insightbb.com/~blackpoint/AnimationEQ.gif" height=85 width=468 alt="Blackpoint Sorrowblade Thistletongue" border=0></a></p><span class=m><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub95.ezboard.com/bebonmoon.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=blackpointsorrowbladethistletongue>Blackpoint Sorrowblade Thistletongue</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/anim_1.gif" BORDER=0> at: 7/28/02 2:57:42 am<br></i></span><hr size=1><span class=m> Posts: <b>577</b>  </span></td></tr></table></td></tr></table></td></tr></table><br><table border=0 width=95%><tr><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub95.ezboard.com/febonmoonfrm2.emailToFriend?topicID=41.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/ultimate/email.gif width=20 height=20 border=0 alt="email this topic to a friend" align=absmiddle></a> Email This To a Friend </td><td align=right valign="top"></td></tr></table><table width="95%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tr><td bgcolor=#006400><table border=0 width=100% cellpadding="5" cellspacing="1"><tr><td nowrap bgcolor=#000000 width=20%><a href=http://pub95.ezboard.com/febonmoonfrm2.showAddTopicScreenFromWeb><img src=http://ebonmoon.com/images/Icons/newtopic.gif border=0 alt="New Topic"></a>  &nbsp;&nbsp;<a self href=http://pub95.ezboard.com/febonmoonfrm2.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=41.topic><img src=http://ebonmoon.com/images/Icons/reply.gif border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a>  </td><td bgcolor=#000000><a href=http://pub95.ezboard.com/febonmoonfrm2.threadControl?topicID=41.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/black_default/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image" align=absmiddle></a> Topic Commands (Moderator Only)  <br><a href=http://pub95.ezboard.com/febonmoonfrm2.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=41.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/ultimate/subscribe.gif width=20 height=20 border=0 alt="Click to receive email notification of replies" align=absmiddle></a> Click to receive email notification of replies  <br><a href=http://pub95.ezboard.com/febonmoonfrm2.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=41.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/ultimate/unsubscribe.gif width=20 height=20 border=0 alt="Click to stop receiving email notification of replies" align=absmiddle></a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies </td><td nowrap bgcolor=#000000 align=right><a href="http://pub95.ezboard.com/febonmoonfrm2.showNextMessage?topicID=41.topic"> Next Topic >> </a></td></tr></table></td></tr></table><table width=95% border=0 cellpadding="5"><td valign="top"></td><td align="right" valign="top"><form action=http://pub95.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="ebonmoonfrm20">The Foyer<option value="ebonmoonfrm12">Recruitment - New Members<option value="ebonmoonfrm1">Family News<option value="ebonmoonfrm2">IC Only...
