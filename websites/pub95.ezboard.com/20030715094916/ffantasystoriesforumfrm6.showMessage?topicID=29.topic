Standing up slowly with wobbled legs, she looks around the dark streets that surround her. Good, no one saw her. Feeling rather embarrassed she makes her way through the nearly deserted two to her home. Home was a flat that her friend helped get her for a cheap price. The owner knew her since she was little and knew her ma was a bit rough on her, so he let her stay for as cheap as possible. She only paid for water and maintenance, that sort of thing. It may be small, but it was not her mother’s house, and for that she was thankful. With her head tilted down towards the sludgy gravel ground she drags her feet onto the next street. She hears a laugh… it was Caelestis! Looking up any ashamed expression is instantly evaporated. Just as she was about to call out to him, she saw her. Standing across a street stood Caelestis, laughing, with his arm around another girl. Not only another girl but a strikingly beautiful girl with long wavy blonde hair and crystal blue eyes, her shape was perfect and her body heavenly. Miriam watches in disbelief, her eyes bulging out of her head, as he pulls this girl in and whispers something in her ear. Was she really seeing this? It had begun to rain but Miriam did not take notice, the rain was too common to care about, all Miriam could see was that whore with Caelestis. The girl bit her bottom lip and wrapped her arms around Caelestis for a long passionate kiss. Oh… dear… gods… this * was * happening! Caelestis was with another girl!! Miriiam and Caelestis never was officially an item, but he had always made Miriiam feel like they were. He would bring her flowers or chocolates or some stuffed thing and tell her she was the only one; she was the only thing that could complete him. Yea, complete him for that @#%$ night maybe, and then there were other women for the rest of the week no doubt. Miriam couldn’t believe how stupid she was, how ignorant, how much of a fool she had been…. And so she ran. <br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Someone needed to die. Someone needs to feel pain, the kind of pain she feels deep within her. If she didn't inflict major bodily injury on someone soon... she was going to explode. Mother fuckers would pay... all of them. They did this to her, made her this way, and they would know it. They would pay for her pain, for her suffering. She would take from her all the happiness she never felt. Sitting there living their perfect lives, telling her they understand when they never could. Never in a million @#%$ years would they understand. Shut the @#%$ up!! Understand my ass... Miriiam stares at her reflection in the flawless silver blade. Mother fuckers... <br>
<br>
&quot;Miria-&quot; Delshad walked in at the wrong time. Miriiam caulks her arm back and thrusts it forward. With a flick of her wrist the knife is sent whizzing through the air, its final destination reached in a matter of seconds. The ivory handle sparkles as the blade is wedged deep within Delshad's skull. Blood begins to rush and spurt from his head while Miriiam watches on contently from her seat.<br>
<br>
&quot;Miriam? What are you doing?&quot; Delshad pulls out a seat and sits in front of her; his knee's brushing hers lightly. She was shocked slightly to see his forehead unscaved. Angrily, she stabs the knife's tip into the wooden table next to her. His hands rub her knees comfortingly.<br>
<br>
&quot;Nothing&quot; she growls quietly. Mother fuckers... She rose from her chair roughly, knocking it over in the process. Mother fuckers... Opening the cupboard she looks around. Not much is there, but she wasn't hungry anyways, just looking for something to do instead of sitting with Delshad. <br>
<br>
&quot;Something's wrong... Tell me&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Nothing's wrong. I'm just a little upset, that's all&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Why?&quot;<br>
<br>
Closing the cupboard with extra care, she grits her teeth to relieve her nerves. In the nicest voice she can manage for her mood, she says, &quot;Another fight with the Old lady is all. Got me kinda rattled for a little. I'll be fine&quot; Again, a lie... She wanted to turn around and yell and scream at Delshad, she wanted to shove that knife into his chest over and over and over and over and over and over... and over. She didn't, she couldn't kill one of her friends... could she? Mother fuckers... <br>
<br>
&quot;Well, some of us are goin out. You wanna come?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;No. I think I'll just stay home tonight.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;You sure?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Yea, I’m not in the mood for going out at the moment&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Ok. I'll see ya tomorrow Miriiam&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Sure. Have a good time!&quot;<br>
<br>
The sweetness in her voice made her stomach turn. More lies. As the door shuts, Miriiam's fake smile melts and is replaced with her true feelings. Buzzing around the kitchen she finds this or that to do. Wipe off the clean counter... check the cupboards... Run the water a little... Mother fuckers... Miriiam's eyes run over the crystal clear gleam of the blade, still stuck into the table. Ripping it from the wood, she sets her wrist out on the counter. @#%$ them all! Cold... The blade was cold as it cut through each of her skin layers and ruptured her vein, but the blood was warm and felt nice as it flowed over her hand and into the sink. Kinda tickled as it dripped from her fingertips. Even her wrist bleed wrong, it was too fast. She couldn't bask in the pain, even death @#%$ her over! Glancing at the knife with the blade still stuck in the table, Miriam rubs her untouched wrists that throb as a tingling of pain shoots through them. She walks out of the kitchen without another thought. Mother fuckers... <p><Br> <Br> <Br> <Br> Your head will collapse <Br> But there's nothing in it <Br> And you'll ask yourself <Br> Where is my mind? <Br> Where is my mind? <Br> Wheeeeeere iiis my mind?</p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top"> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub95.ezboard.com/ffantasystoriesforumfrm6.showPrevMessage?topicID=29.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub95.ezboard.com/ffantasystoriesforumfrm6.showNextMessage?topicID=29.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a self href=http://pub95.ezboard.com/ffantasystoriesforumfrm6.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=29.topic><img src=http://Auction.2y.net/user/paradisetheheretic/addreply.jpg border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub95.ezboard.com/ffantasystoriesforumfrm6.emailToFriend?topicID=29.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub95.ezboard.com/ffantasystoriesforumfrm6.threadControl?topicID=29.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/professional/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands</a><br> <a href=http://pub95.ezboard.com/ffantasystoriesforumfrm6.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=29.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/ultimate/subscribe.gif width=20 height=20 border=0 alt="Click to receive email notification of replies"> Click to receive email notification of replies</a> <br>  <a href=http://pub95.ezboard.com/ffantasystoriesforumfrm6.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=29.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/ultimate/unsubscribe.gif width=20 height=20 border=0 alt="Click to stop receiving email notification of replies"> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies</a> <br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub95.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="fantasystoriesforumfrm1">General Fantasy Stories<option value="fantasystoriesforumfrm2">EverQuest Stories<option value="fantasystoriesforumfrm11">Fantasy Inspired Art<option value="fantasystoriesforumfrm14">Fantasy Inspired Poetry<option value="fantasystoriesforumfrm7">Role Playing Forum<option value="fantasystoriesforumfrm3">Suggestions for FSF<option value="fantasystoriesforumfrm4">Off-Topic Discussions<option value="fantasystoriesforumfrm12">Polls:  Off-Topic and Otherwise<option value="fantasystoriesforumfrm5">Stories by:  Paradise Perdu<option value="fantasystoriesforumfrm6">Stories by:  Bellona Kali<option value="fantasystoriesforumfrm8">Stories by:  Mindles Kali<option value="fantasystoriesforumfrm9">Stories by:  Ryvian<option value="fantasystoriesforumfrm10">Stories by:  Dahnyella Sylvanblitz<option value="fantasystoriesforumfrm15">Stories by:  Shoken</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#FF0000>- </font><a href=http://pub95.ezboard.com/bfantasystoriesforum>Fantasy Stories Forum</a><font color=#FF0000> - </font><a href=http://pub95.ezboard.com/ffantasystoriesforumfrm6>Stories by:  Bellona Kali</a> <font color=#FF0000> - </font><br><br><table border=0 align=center><tr><td align=center><a href="http://login.ezboard.com/BBSSystem.showUserPaymentScreen" target="_blank">Upgrade your account to ezSupporter...</a></td><td><img src="http://www.ezboard.com/image/spacer.gif" width=15 height=1 border=0></td><td align=center><a href="http://login.ezboard.com/BBSSystem.showUserPaymentScreen" target="_blank">...and never see another ad or pop-up again</a></td></tr></table><CENTER><!-- START BOTTOM AD SCRIPT -->
