The scratches, and her small paintings adorned the stones. She reached her room and hastily pulled on the boots she had been given for her fifteenth birthday. The council had thought she could use some pretty dresses and maybe some fine clothes. She had put in a request for some good boots to a councilman. Her feet were callused but could still easily be sliced on the sharp rocks of the mountain. She was proud of these boots, and wore them only for special occasions, like flying. Running out of the enclave that served as her room, the sound of hard leather smacking the stones echoed down the tunnels. <br>
<br>
*Young one, what do you think you are doing? * The voice was strong and sounded agitated.<br>
<br>
Tir stopped dead in her tracks, tried to focus on her words carefully.<br>
<br>
*Thinking of flying, are we? * Tir had always understood her mother was very wise and very, very perceptive, but sometimes Tir almost believed her mother to be an oracle.<br>
<br>
*Mother, my brothers are waiting. Yes I am going to fly with them. * Tir said trying to sound responsible and respective.<br>
<br>
*Tir, my daughter. The humans cannot wait. The council will be here shortly and they do not have the ears you have. They also don’t have a mind of such clarity. The Wings and I need you here to help keep the bond from falling to shambles. * The sound of wisdom and reason spoke.<br>
<br>
Unable to hold back her rage at the humans coming before her own brothers, her wingmates, Tir could not hold back her reply. *Mother! My wingmates, my brothers and sisters of the claw are waiting for me! The humans have always been there; it is not my shortcoming that they do not understand mind speech! Nor is there anything that I am able to do about their ignorance. I have spent the last four weeks serving, and catering to the high council. I have no time for my family anymore. I remember you always told me that I must respect the humans, but they are, after all not family. You taught me that when my family needed me I should be there and attentive. Are you asking me to disobey you and pay no heed to my brothers? *<br>
<br>
There was a brief silence and Tir was breathing heavy with her concentration on her speech.<br>
*Tir, my little darling. You are my daughter. As your mother, my answer to your question is yes. Close your eyes to them for now. They can fly any day. Today we decide if you should return or not. The humans no longer think you fit to live with me. They believe that the old ways are gone and that you, their Duchess should return. You have a say in this matter, and you should be there to give it, not out flying with your brothers. * <br>
<br>
Tir fell silent. Her mind was made up. These humans, she had enough of their plotting, of their scheming. She would pay them back for everything ten fold. <br>
<br>
As tears fell from her fair face, Tir was about to dishonor her mother, something she had never done before and something she would eternally regret.<br>
*Trigg, call Hagner. I am not strong enough to call him from the distance. I need him and you for a little mission. *<br>
<br>
She and the other wingmates heard the call. Hagner was not necessarily a wingmate, but he had been her friend since she had first arrived. He had given his blood oath to serve her when called upon. When she was younger she had secretly loved Hagner, but since she was a human and he was a Dragon, and a Wing Master the arrangement would have never worked. It was that day she had started to loathe the human kind. She truly started to hate them after the day Hagner told her he would always love her, but could never show his true affection, she was after all a human. <br>
<br>
Turning towards the eastern landing, Tir looked out the tunnel and the light casting a shadow of her brother Vermifax. She could always tell by his wings, they gave a golden tint when in the sunlight.<br>
 <br>
*Green eyes. You are my elder and by that I hold you in the utmost respect, but I have to stand against you in this. Whatever you are planning I must stand where I am and tell you that I will not allow it. * The voice was that of a stubborn Wing Master, even if he was a young one.<br>
<br>
“Vermifax, you can never understand my reasons for doing this, but I have to do what I must, and you cannot stop me.” Tir said as she came to meet him. “The humans must learn the might of the Wings, if they do not they will come again and again. They are too weak to barter with. I will not let them push me around.”<br>
<br>
A massive head covered in red scales lowered to Tir’s eye level. The bright, glowing red eyes full of life narrowed at her. Putting both hands on her hips Tir gave a huff. The young Wing was nine years younger than she but towered at least four times her height. His body blocked the entrance and his wings spread to fill the gaps of sunlight.<br>
<br>
*Tir, you are my favorite sister, but do not believe that I do not have my own methods of stopping you. * Vermifax snorted as he let a flicker of flame escape his long snout and light the tunnel.<br>
<br>
“Vermifax,” Tir said softly as she gently placed her hand on his nose, “Hagner will tear you from the skies you love and rip you into pieces, he is also you’re elder. I am your older sister, not the reverse, and I command you get out of my way.”<br>
<br>
Vermifax snorted again, *Sister, wingmate, I am not afraid of Hagner. He is much more skilled, but I will not let my sister leave and throw the entire race into a war with the humans. * <br>
<br>
Tir looked down at her feet. “Vermifax, my mighty brother. You were always my favorite too. Remember when Trigg was first learning to fly? He slipped from a rock before he was ready and I dove after him. He was so panicked he dug his claws, even though they were small, into me to hold on. You came out of nowhere and grabbed both of us and hauled us to the ledge.” Tir stroked his face as she spoke, “That day we were truly family, no one could ever tear us apart, the others came into my heart later, but you and Trigg were the first that accepted me. You can’t always be there to drag me to a landing. I would never forget that, and I would not jeopardize you, or any of my family. I will attend one more meeting with the humans.” Tir turned and looked back into the cave as Vermifax pulled his wings back revealing sunlight. “For you brother. Call Trigg; tell him that it is off. Tell Hagner that there will be a time I will need call on him, but it is not now, not today.”<br>
<br>
Vermifax grunted his approval and turned back to the landing. *Green eyes, I understand your want, but there will be other days we can fly, times when the council are not so picky. <br>
<br>
Returning to the smithy, Trent was almost giddy at his gift from Master Hitch. He reached the doors and skipped in. <br>
“I’m back sir.”<br>
There was a silence in the open walled building that was not usual. There were no sounds of metal hitting metal. Trent reached the top floor of the smithy and found his master was not there. Thinking he remembered something about the metal polisher, but usually the old man would appear at the building and do his business in the upper floors of the building. The smithy was built like on stilts. The bottom was open to public eye. There were the forges burning in large brick squares rising far enough in height to reach the waist. There were tables and anvils, hammer racks and other tool tables. The upper floors were the office of the forge. That is where the store was and the master’s own personal office. The polisher’s room, as well as the practice room and such resided in the third and fourth levels of the large building. Perhaps the master had gone to the polisher to have the sword worked on and happened to stop somewhere else. <br>
<br>
Thinking nothing more on the absence of the master, Trent went back to work. He had to produce two more blades for the polisher that day. He had the materials to work with, but the hammering was taxing of the body. Trent was a strong young boy, grown that way since starting work as a smithy apprentice. His family had hit hard times and he was forced to take up his trade early. The rest of the young men his age were off learning the arts, writing, reading, and play with swords. Trent was making an income for his father, the last member of his family. His mother had run off when he was just a baby. Trent always tried to remember his mother. His father was not much help in his interest in his mother, Trent’s father had broke down after his mother left them and sold his store. The town’s pub was where his father worked now; only he was more of a paying employee. The tab for his father’s liquor was staggering and Trent worked very hard to handle the bills he was sent.<br>
<br>
Down the street in another office, Marcus D’ Vega was having some words with the Master Smithy. “Sir, I do not mean any disrespect, but I need these goods by tomorrow. I have certain standards to meet and in order to do that I need your assistance. Now will you help me, or will I be forced to help myself?”<br>
<br>
Master Smithy Hitch sat in the chair. The once empty office was now full of furnature. There was a receptionist at the front desk and behind her there was a hallway leading to many other rooms including Master D’ Vega’s personal office. There were people outside in the lobby waiting to be called on to talk with Master D’ Vega. <br>
<br>
“Master D’ Vega, I understand your need. But I simply cannot make those amounts of weapons, armor, and inventions you ask for on such short notice. I run a small smithy. I’m sure if you ask a local armory, I know Master Sven as a large selection. He can even order out for supplies.” Master Hitch stammered still looking at the list given to him. <br>
<br>
Marcus stood from behind his desk. “My good Master Hitch. I need these specifications to my equipment; you are the only blacksmith in this town that has a forge big enough to handle this all. I trust that you are not simply trying to raise the price for your wares.”<br>
<br>
Master Hitch nodded slightly. Marcus went on. “Well I will let you go and see about your business with us. I expect those things by tomorrow evening. I have a job to do. I must keep the order in this territory. Order is my job Master Hitch. Order.”<br>
<br>
Off in the mountain caves the Wings were also calling for order. Tir stood in her usual attire, worn down tunic, shoeless, with her hair pulled back into a single ponytail falling down her back. Her spot of standing had her raised above everyone else so they could all hear and see. <br>
<br>
“Welcome leaders of mankind. I am Tir Bella, and this is my mother, Groagin and the rest of the Wings. We welcome you back to my home to discuss the matters of lasting peace between the Wings and that of Man.” Tir said as the humans all stood around in front of her, the Dragon Wings stood behind her. <br>
<br>
*Vermifax, you better be ready to take me flying when I’m done here. And tell Trigg to get ready for some fun. * Tir said secretly as the humans started to give their complaints to the Wings.<br>
<br>
*Mother why do you tolerate these people? If we were to gather the rest of the Wings, we could level the human world in a matter of days. * Tir asked after one human demanded to have her return with them to the city of Pillo Point. <br>
<br>
*Because daughter, these people are more devious than we are, you might think the might of the Wings is enough to crush them, but trust me it is not. The kind of man is one of devious cunning. The only reason they have survived so long is to adapt. If we were to assault it would be a long and indefinite war. * Came the reply, again the words spoke of wisdom.<br>
<br>
One ambassador shouted above the other humans to gain the floor. “As the new Duke of Pillo Point, I demand that we have Tir Bella returned to her rightful place. She deserves to live with her own kind. Dragons have been her keepers since the days of her mad father, but those days are gone. The bond between Dragons can still remain, but the presence of Tir with you is no longer needed, and is frankly inappropriate.” <br>
<br>
Tir felt her cheeks grow red. “How dare you insult my family that way. My presence here is on my own will. You speak as if I am not a person but merely your puppet. Well sir, I am here because this is my family. I have my wingmates to keep me safe and my mother to keep my mind sharp. I would shame you here for your impression, but it would be rude and honestly sir, I will not stoop to your level of disgrace.”<br>
<br>
The leaders of man began to whisper and talk amongst each other. The chaos was growing louder and the din of the cave was growing unbearable. Finally a noble shouted over the noise and called for order. <br>
<br>
“Gentlemen and Wiings alike! I call that you listen. Tir has the choice, it is her life and she is in control of what she does with it. The purpose for our assembly today was to see what she plans on doing with her life! If I must remind my fellow man that we came only with the intentions of allowing Tir to return to our city for a short while to learn of human culture once more and then to return. I believe she is already very cultured, but her most recent teachings have been by the Wings. We simply wanted to invite her to come and stay with our people for a time.”<br>
<br>
*He is right daughter. I have kept you here in this cave for long enough. You need to experience both of the cultures before you become so involved in our own. I think you should go with them. *  Groagin said to her privately.<br>
<br>
Tir looked back at her mother. *Is it your will that I go? * <br>
<br>
The Dragon looked at her daughter for a long period of time. *Yes my daughter, you should follow the road that unfurls before you. * <br>
<br>
Tir looked at her feet. Another Wing spoke up. *I believe, that while it is still Tir’s choice, she is better suited with her family. She is still young and is not able to fully support herself in the ways that her wingmates would be able to, or her revered mother. *<br>
<br>
Tir stood there silent for a moment. All eyes had turned on her waiting for her decision. After a time, Tir turned her eyes on the crowds. “Wings, Masters, I believe that it is my responsibility to go along with this plan and return to my place of birth. The people need to accept my being human, as well as a wingmate to the young Wings. I will go to Pillo Point and live there for a time dependent on the council of men here. I will return and when I do I will be further better equipped to help both sides indiscriminately. My word is final this meeting is over. I will leave with these men.”<br>
<br>
Tir turned to her mother with a tear in her eye. *What will my wingmates think of me? * <br>
<br>
Her mother nuzzled her with the long nose. *They will think of you with love always, I will tell them; they would be far too emotional for their own good. They are still young. I will tell them you send your love and will return as soon as you possibly can. * <br>
<br>
Tir smiled and turned to travel back with the men. As she stepped down with the rest of the humans; men helping her to walk surrounded her. She was growing furious with these people and stormed ahead. Shrugging off the encasing hands, “I can very well walk on my own thank you!” <br>
<br>
Tir looked back at her mother and the rest of the Wings as they gave their salutes, wings raised and fire thrown towards the sky. She would miss them something fierce. Turning again she walked down the mountain without looking back. She felt the rush of emotions hitting her mind and the puzzled words from her brothers, but ignored them. She would return soon enough.<br>
<br>
“Tir, I want you to know that when we get to town, if you ever need anything I will be at my office.” One of the men at the meeting said as he pushed past his fellow council members to stand beside her.<br>
