It was almost too much for her when she stepped out of the car. The scene, the aura, the feel of it all. She thirsted for it on the inside. Her friends were slow at getting out of the car, but she had hopped out before the engine had shut off.<br>
<br>
“Hurry up!! Come on, come on, come on! Lets go in!”<br>
<br>
“Calm down, Z. It’s not like the party’s gonna be over if we don’t go in now”<br>
<br>
Her shoulders slumped as she sighed deeply. Slowly, her urgency faded and the group piled out of the car. The auburn hair girl grabbed Zita’s hand swiftly and smiled big when her tiny crystal eyes looked up.<br>
<br>
“My little darling! We’re going to have a blast! Are you ready for this?”<br>
<br>
“I was born for this!” <br>
<br>
“Then lets go! Kandi Kyds ho!” <br>
<br>
Some of them shook their head and smiled, some laughed, but all headed towards the same direction – the bass. <br>
<br>
***<br>
It was like a different world – the rave. People came from all over, decked out in special attire for the night. Each was either dancing or lying in a pool of mixed sweat in a corner. Regardless of their state, each person wore a smile and was willing to give a hug to anyone who was willing to receive it. It was the closest to a Utopian world that could be housed inside the venue. Random strangers passed out blow pops and candy to the few who were resting or tripping, and the ones on the ground took it graciously from someone they had never seen before in their life. There was no fear. There was no harm. You could feel the good vibes around you in the people. No one was there to hurt anyone else. Any randomly chosen person would much rather help you then anything else. Whether it was “Where’s the chill room?” or “Can you help me fix my bag?” it would be done with a grin and ended with good wishes. And yet… though each person here’s heart was filled with love for people around them, they were the most hated. If you weren’t inside that club, then you were hated by those who weren’t. P.L.U.R meant nothing to “norms”. Hugs and smiles only turned them away even more. But why? What had any of these people done to disserve such treatment? Maybe nothing. These were just the lost few from the generation. Not punks, not Goths, not preps or jocks, they didn’t fit in with any clique. Punks were too hardcore. Goths were too negative. Preps were too fake. Jocks too stupid. Nerds too none accepting. So where, then, were they to sit at lunch? With each other. Slowly they created their own group, their own style. And because no one else would relate to them, they’re now ridiculed and looked down on. It didn’t make sense to Zita. But as sad as that was, she couldn’t stick with the feeling. One glance at anything around her would change her mood completely. She could be herself here. She could dance however she wanted and dressed in anything she felt like and no one would think her weird or stupid or dumb. Everyone loved her, and she loved everyone. A smile developed on her lips and she couldn’t contain herself any longer. A burst of giggles erupted, and she tugged the girl attached at her hand into the crowd of dancing people and they too began to dance.<br>
<br>
Fast beats pumped out from gigantic speakers on either side of a Dj booth. A man with multi-colored dreadlocks was spinning happy hardcore and Zita loved it. In fact, he was spinning some from a few cd’s she had. Dumdumdumdum, it rolled on and on and on. Make it fast. Make it happy. Make it hardcore. That’s what these kandi kyds lived by. Laser lighting from above matched the elements mixed into the song while backlights made accents on her clothing and a few scattered beads on her jewelry glow. For a moment the song stopped and a man’s voice said.<br>
<br>
“Silence. The you hear:”<br>
<br>
When the song started up again, Zita giggled. How great was that? A new vinyl was strategically slipped in and another song mixed in. Dancing came naturally to Zita. It wasn’t a cognitive thing. In her subconscious was the movement to each step, the matching of the beat to those movements, and the unity that was needed to latch her to the song and make them one. She was whole when she was dancing. The zest for life filled her again with each tinkle in the song, with each hit of the bass, with each step of her foot. The rave wasn’t merely an event held in some place. It was a living, breathing thing. It’s life was given to it by the people, and Zita’s life was given to her by it.  <p><br>
