Her heavy black combat boots thudded loudly on the thin carpet, while the silver chains and pendants that hung around her neck clanged together nosily. From her fishnet stockings to her painted black nails to the makeup caked heavily on her face, she looked like she had just come from a Cure concert in London’s plaza. But there was something different about her that made her not quite fit into the typical English Goth stereotype. Perhaps it was the way she carried herself, perhaps it was the ironic glow in her eyes, or perhaps it was the sleek black briefcase that was handcuffed to her thin wrist.<br>
        As the train cleared the station and began to pick up speed, the girl entered her single person room and locked the door. Setting the briefcase down on the table, she reached up with her free hand and took of her earring, which was shaped like a key. Fitting the key in the lock on the handcuffs, she turned it until she heard a click and the mechanism swung open. She returned the key to the small chain hanging from her ear, and removed the key hanging from the other ear. This key was slipped into the lock on the briefcase, and with only a little effort, she managed to open the case. <br>
        Crushed black velvet lined the inside of the case, providing a soft and secure home for a multitude of what looked like medical tools gone wrong. It was the large syringe that she reached for today. The syringe was full of a red liquid that seemed to glow in dim cabin. She leaned back her head and brushed her raven black bangs out of her eyes. Carefully she positioned the long needle in front of her eye. Holding her hand still, she moved her face towards the syringe, letting the needle slip as far back into her eye as it would go. She released half of the liquid into her eye and repeated the process for her other eye. She replaced the syringe and closed the case, sighing to herself as she did so. Turning it over, she opened it again and this time revealed not twisted medical tools, but rather a slick black laptop. She took it out of its case and opened it up. With a flash the screen swirled in black and red before asking her for her user name. Her fingers moved gracefully across the keys as she typed in her handle:<br>
<br>
PARADISE<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
        Her name was Mia Perdus, but she worked under her hacker alias, Paradise. She was originally from Paris, growing up in a multitude of orphanages and foster homes. She had been adopted three or four times, but she always wound up back on the steps of the orphanage. Her various psychotherapists over the years had filled her chart with words like ‘serious introversion’ and ‘problems with authority’ and ‘severe sadism’. When she turned 18 she turned to the streets, learning whatever anyone would teach her. It was through one of those contacts that she was first introduced to the ‘wired’. The wired was the world that existed inside of computers, inside of the vast array of networks that linked the world together. Inside of the computer Mia could be anyone she wanted to be, inside she could live free of pain, of humiliation, of any of the things that plagued her existence in the real world. But of coarse that kind of life came at a cost. Hacking at first was an easy way too make enough money to buy equipment, but what started out as a temporary job quickly developed into a career. In fact, she now earned enough money to live quite comfortably. Unfortunately for Mia, she did not realize that she was not done paying her dues for the ‘comfortable’ life she was living. <br>
<br>
        <br>
        Her eyes coursed with the red liquid. The drug seeped into her veins and went straight to her brain. The rush was incredible. The drug stimulated the brain to copy and secrete a synthetic neurotransmitter that would speed up the rate at which the brain can process information by a factor of 12. Its street name was ‘blood’.<br>
        Mia hadn’t slept in four days.<br>
        <br>
The authorities in Paris had enlarged their effort to find her, so she was traveling to visit a friend in Rome; to lay low for a while. Little did she know that the ancient city of Rome had a few surprises for her, the kind of surprises that sneak up behind you at 2:00 on a lazy Sunday afternoon and ruin your life. The kind that once it finds you it doesn’t let go until it destroys you.<br>
<br>
        It was eight hours later, speeding through northern Italy that it started. Mia was on a blood binge and had been working since she first got on the train. She was now entering the down stroke of her trip. Coming down from a blood high is most comparable to being burned at the stake. The smoke renders you unconscious well before the flames burn your skin off. Mia swayed in her seat, fading in and out of consciousness. <br>
        It was then that her computer started talking to her. She struggled to focus her eyes as words started appearing on the black screen. &lt;&lt;Have you ever tried to peel your skin off?&gt;&gt;<br>
        Mia repeated the question over and over in her head as she finally, unwillingly, succumbed to the temptation to sleep. She slept peacefully, dreaming of sunny days and black roses.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
        Mia walked quickly through the streets of Rome, wrapping her large trench coat about her tightly to keep out the chill. With her free hand she held a crumpled cigarette that looked as if it had seen better days. <br>
        Walking through the streets of Rome was quite and experience. The harsh angles and sleek look of the modern buildings clashing beautifully with the ancient ruins that littered the city. Ghosts walked these streets, shades too arrogant to realize that they were dead. You could feel them in the wind, you could see them in the shadows.<br>
        Mia turned down a short dead end street that reminded her of the street in Paris where her orphanage was. Two blocks up from Rue de Rivoli on Rue de Mouvais Garcon, Mia spent hours looking out the window of the orphanage at the life that was passing on below her in the street. She used to pretend that she was each of the passersby and imagine what their lives must be like. On any single day she would imagine herself a lawyer, a teacher, a nurse, a street cleaner . . . any life but hers.<br>
        She walked up the steps of a dilapidated old town home that had long ago been converted into apartments. She scanned the list of residents until she saw the name that she was looking for. She pressed the buzzer labeled ‘Kali’. A man’s voice came over the small speaker, distorted by a bad connection. “Yes?” Mia swallowed hard before answering, wondering if she was doing the right thing. “Yes?” The man asked again irritated.<br>
        “Michael. It’s Mia.” A loud buzzing sound announced that the door was unlocked. Mia pushed the door open and went up the dismal staircase that lead to Michael’s pad.<br>
