<br>
The northwoman had done her research. She knew the history of these Harvesters. She knew their direction.  She also knew that there was healing needed here.<br>
<br>
A true mystic cares not for balance, or right or wrong, and a shaman of the Tribunal cares only that things are just.<br>
<br>
Maisri had been taking training from the mystics in New Tanaan, however, and brought with her some of her own thoughts.<br>
<br>
That justice was never nebulous, but oftentimes didn't make itself known until the moment it was needed.  <br>
<br>
That justice was seldom fair, and was construed as evil, as often as it was construed as good.<br>
<br>
That loyalty was just.  And that here, she could freely give her loyalty, and in return, learn about life outside the tundra.</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>

((ooc:: For the basics...I am a 16th level barbarian shaman.  I speak fluent tier'dal, and human, and I'm on most evenings.<br>
<br>
I won't &quot;front&quot; and try to say that Maisri is evil in the way that a dark elf necromancer is evil, because that would be innacurate, at best.<br>
<br>
she is, however, dark, and very &quot;vigilante&quot; in her ideas of justice.  She's attracted to the Scythe, from talking to several members, and seeing the hurt and abject desolation of the ranks(I assume due to the death of one of the leaders), and as a healer, she can't not want to try to fix that, as, from what she can see, there's been an injustice.<br>
<br>
I'm aware that I'm an odd case to have as an applicant, and I'm willing to deal with all in character interactions with anyone and any ooc questions from the officership.))<br>

Vendui' Maisri.<br>
<br>
I apologize that the times I have seen you in our lounge I have not been the most open, or talkative. You are correct in sensing loss, and grief.<br>
<br>
But it is an emotion that I must leave behind now. The period of mourning is over. Now begins the calm before the storm.<br>
<br>
I have heard of Justice talked about as being only of the Light, but it appears that you as well as I know that to be false. There is justice in the world, and more often than not, it is blind, unconcerned with artificial designations of Good or Evil. <br>
<br>
Those who say that Justice is of the light are the same ones that claim that those of us of the darkness are without honor.<br>
<br>
As a Knight, I take much offense at that notion.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Maisri, make yourself at home, here in the halls, as you and the Scythe become better aquainted.<br>
<br>
Justice has been one of the things weighing on my mind recently, and when I am ready, we must talk about it.<br>
<br>
As for now, please excuse me. <br>
