Thats not true.  Saruman WAS in leauge with Sauron as was proved when Pippin looked into the Palantir stone and was almost overcome.<br>

'Glamdring' was the name of Gandals sword from the troll caves.<br>

Hugo Weaving is Elrond as was Agent Smith<br>

I wore out one set and went out and bought a one volume paperback and the Houghton-Mifflin hardcover editions.<br>
<br>
I first heard they were going to film these movies over 2 years ago and have been keeping track ever since through various webites. I kind of knew what to expect.<br>
<br>
I was impressed with what Peter Jackson accomplished. He captured much of what I invisioned Middle Earth to be. The casting was very good, although I had reservation about Liv, I am satisfied with her portrayal of Arwen so far.<br>
<br>
Movie was 3 hours, yes, but seemed like 2. I would have sat through at least 2 more. There will be a Director's Cut, BUT, you will have to wait until all 3 movies have been released. At least that's the scuttlebutt going around on all the FoTR boards. Say about 2 and a half years untill you can get your hands on the Director's Cut Boxed Edition. It'll probably go for about $150 US. I can't wait!<br>
<br>
Many of the scenes you guys have been missing will be in the directors cut so I hear. At least one hours worth of material had to be trimmed as New Line wanted the movie less than 3 hours in length. Have patience.<br>
<br>

Nice work on the images.<br>
<br>
I was completely and totally blown away by the movie.  I think its the hands-down best adaptation of a book that I have ever seen.  Other movies have left me with this saccharine taste in my mouth that left me yelling &quot;BUT in the BOOK they did THIS!, or In the Book that guy says...,&quot; etc. but that just didn't happen with LoTR.  /cheer.  I read The Hobbit, Fellowship, and the Two Towers once, but I have not yet touched Return of the King.  After seeing the movie I think I will read the whole trilogy again.<br>
<br>
The only disparity that I noticed is the relationship between Samwise and Frodo.  It seemed that in the books that Sam had a much more servile relationship with Frodo.  (e.g. 'Master Frodo', or 'Frodo's servant Samwise') This relationship was not heavily portrayed in the movie--they seem more like peers, which is ok.  However, I think that Sam's characterization in the film is missing something because of this.  His dedication to Frodo seems a bit unresolved.<br>
<br>
My favorite scene was in the mines of Moria when Gandalf fought the Balroc (sp?).  &quot;YOU SHALL NOT PASS!!!&quot;  WRAAAAA!  How cool was that?  I didn't notice Legolas with his daggers and short-range arrows until the second time I saw the movie--but wow.  (Yeah, I had to watch it twice.  The theater was packed the first time and I got shitty seats up front and on the side.)<br>
<br>
Liv Tyler didn't bother me at all.  I thought she did great and was infinitely sexy speaking elvish <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->    When I first noticed that Liv was cast in the film, I thought &quot;oh great, another cheese-movie actress to cheapen an otherwise good movie for the masses, just like Star Wars I.&quot;  (I thought The Phantom Menace was offensive to any fan of the Star Wars movies.  Bantha farts, slapstick gungan &quot;humor&quot;, and NBC-like pod race announcers really violated the spirit of episodes 4-6, imho.  Gratz kids movie.)  Anyway I was thoroughly relieved/impressed when I saw Arwen's part in LoTR.<br>
<br>
Galadriel made me understand why I play a high elf female enchanter in EQ.  The fit of lust she threw over the Ring made me put fingernail marks in the arms of my theater seat.  I may look all sweet and pure on the outside...but fuk with me and I'm getting medieval on yo ass.  Hehe.  In my opinion, everything about Galadriel in the film radiated &quot;I am a high elven badass.  Fear me.&quot;<br>
<br>
Anyway if you didn't read the books at least once, then don't bother making any bad comments about the movie.  You just sound like a moron.  k thx.<br>
<br>
Anyone else see the Star Wars II and Queen of the Damned trailers before LoTR?  I'm sorta lookin forward to those as well.  God please don't let them screw up Star Wars even worse.<br>

Gimili is how I see dwarves, and Legolas was as I pictured him as well. Yes, I can't wait for the Director's cut to come out on DVD.<br>
<br>
Other comments:<br>
 Tuffon, If I remember the book.  After Boromir's death, Aragorn, Gimili and Legolas returned to the boat landing and inspected the area.  They made a judgement from what gear was missing and the foot prints that Frodo and Sam had taken a boat to continue the quest. Then did they make the decision to follow after the White Hand orcs and rescue Pippin and Merry.<br>
<br>
The reforging of the sword was almost absent if you didn't look for it.  Boromir examining the sword in Rivendell and then Aragorn posing with it at the beginning of his part of the last fight are all that remains of that series of scenes.  If you didn't know about it you would have missed it.<br>
<br>
I truelly miss Old Tom Bambadil and his wife, Goldenberry. The Barrowdowns and all, but they had to save time somewhere.<br>
<br>
There were other fantasy novels prior to the Hobbit and the Triology of the Ring. Conan the Barbarian and John Carter of Mars come to mind at first.  But the scene was also set by the classics, the Illiad and the Odyssey, Beowulf and also the works of Lord Dunsany, and H.G. Wells. And don't escape how the swashbuckler stories have been integrated into fantasy.<br>

I love movies. Action, drama, chick-flicks, comedy, anime, etc... A good movie, or a movie so bad that is good, will always pull me away from what I am doing.<br>
<br>
Peter Jackson's &quot;Lord of the Rings&quot; is probably the best movie I have ever seen.<br>
<br>
I have read the books quite a few times. Some of the differences between the book and the movie with a little startling, but the acting, the story, the effects, and the imagery more than made up for it.<br>
<br>
One thing, the movie is 2 hours and 58 minutes. Drink your soda carefully or you will have to suffer until the end... <p><BR>

<br>
I read the Hobbit and the trilogy over ten years ago and in the past year and a half re-read them.  And I was also worried that the movie was going to be a huge disappointment, not at all what the books were.  What I found was, I had to give the movie some leeway for the fact that they had taken one large book, the first part of a trilogy, and turned it into a three hour movie.  <br>
<br>
For those of you who felt that LoTR was long and drawn out, you obviously didn't read the book.  That's not a slam in any way, it's just a fact.  In many cases I felt as if I was almost getting whiplash of sorts because BAM they left the shire, BAM through the forest, in and out of the city, hi Galadriel, bye Galadriel and so on and so forth.  They also left out most of Gollum's following them throughout, and that small part of the story in itself always kept you thinking about him in the back of your mind.  In order to make this a (short!) three hour movie, I do respect the way they did it and can understand why they left out so much.  Even though they did leave out much, it still turned into a coherent story.<br>
<br>
If you watched the movie but didn't read the book, you missed a lot and I would encourage you to go back and read Fellowship.  The first 80 pages or so are long and it feels as if you are sitting in a classroom, being taught by some elderly, eccentric historian, but there is a transition in there where suddenly, yet subtly, you are in the story.  <br>
<br>
But I digress.  Back to the movie, I thought the scenery was absolutely incredible and the fighting was brilliant.  <br>

Btw, For those of us who never read the series but play EQ, it was an EQ movie. I know that sounds sad to those of you who read the books, and I know that is where all this orginated, but I couldnt help but see it as such.  Nice to make the connection to its origins though.

ELROND: Which halfling messed it up? Frodo? <br>

GANDALF: Oh, and we did. Except Frodo didn't know how to manage aggro<br>
properly. The troll started beating on him. <br>
<br>
<br>
ELROND: Oh, no. Poor Frodo. <br>
<br>
<br>
GANDALF: No, actually, Frodo was fine. He had a mithril chain tunic on. <br>
<br>
<br>
ELROND: Jeez, just because he's friends with Bilbo, does Bilbo have to twink<br>
him like that? <br>
<br>
<br>
GANDALF: Yeah, no kidding. So the troll ran and Pippin of course forgets to<br>
snare. <br>
<br>
<br>
ELROND: Aragorn's a ranger, why didn't he snare? <br>
<br>
<br>
GANDALF: He was our main tank and was busy keeping the orcs aggroed on him.<br>
Pippin was just sleeping on the job. So the troll ran, and before we finally<br>
cut him down, he chain aggroed the Balrog. <br>
<br>
<br>
ELROND: Oh, no. Stupid halfling dr00ds. <br>
<br>
<br>
GANDALF: Yeah. So naturally, I decided to take it on the chin. I told everyone<br>
to run and I tried to hold off the Balrog by rooting him. <br>
<br>
<br>
ELROND: And he got you. <br>
<br>
<br>
GANDALF: No, actually, I had my shield up, and I just chain-nuked him. <br>
<br>
<br>
ELROND: You SOLOED the Balrog? Wow. <br>
<br>
<br>
GANDALF: Yeah, one hell of an XP hit too. But then when he fell, I turned and<br>
slipped off the ledge. I 10Ked when I hit the bottom of the Balrog pit. Didn't<br>
even have chance to loot his corpse. And there went <br>
the XP from the orcs, the troll, AND the Balrog. Stupid Verant. <br>
<br>
<br>
ELROND: Your corpse is in the bottom of the Balrog pit? <br>
<br>
<br>
GANDALF: Yeah. But no worries, I think I know a way to drag it out of there. <br>
<br>
<br>
ELROND: That's good. <br>
<br>
<br>
GANDALF: So, can I bum a SoW off you for a CR? I want to get back there before<br>
the Balrog respawns. <br>
<br>
<br>
ELROND: This is Rivendell. We're high elves. The wood elves are in Lothlorien.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
GANDALF: Nadgers. Which is where we were headed in the first place. Oh well,<br>
I'm a wizard at least, and there's a portal not too far from there. <br>
<br>
<br>
ELROND: Good luck on your CR. Why were you hanging out with those noobs<br>
anyway? <br>
<br>
<br>
GANDALF: I promised Frodo I'd powerlevel him in exchange for him completing<br>
the Cracks of Doom quest with me. He has the quest piece - the One Ring. <br>
<br>
<br>
ELROND: That's NO DROP, isn't it. <br>
<br>
<br>
GANDALF: Yeah. <br>
<br>
<br>
ELROND: What do you get for completing that quest? <br>
<br>
<br>
GANDALF: Robe of the White and Staff of the White. Those would be serious<br>
upgrades to my Grey robe and staff. I've had this gear for way too many levels<br>
anyway. <br>
<br>
<br>
ELROND: Nice. <br>
<br>
<br>
GANDALF: Anyway, I'd better go. Do you think you could get someone to go to<br>
the Moria zone to rez me once I get my corpse pulled there? <br>
<br>
<br>
ELROND: I'll try to find a guildie. <br>
<br>
<br>
GANDALF: Thanks.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#f7f7f7><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub95.ezboard.com/udalynia.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Dalynia</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_redspot.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Dubious Poster</span><br>  Posts: 150<br> <font color=#778899>(12/27/01 9:01:04 am)</font><br>     <br>Community Supporter<br> <BR><img src=http://circe.inetdb.com/~dalynia/images/dalynia-portrait.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Lord of the Rings..</span><hr size=1> Oh my God that is the funniest thing I have read in a very very long time!

Saruman was in league with Sauron yes, but he was still seemed to be TRYING to control the outcome himself.. and not just submiting to the will of Sauron.  Yes Pippin was overcome, but Saruman seemed to be trying to deny it (Much like Denethor did).  At least that is my opinion.<br>
<br>
Obeorn:<br>
<br>
Actually I was going to make a post afterward the original one, but I forgot to.  You are correct, they did discover that they took off after noticing the boat and Sam's pack missing.. but still wern't 100% sure.  <br>
<br>
<br>
Yes the sword was givin to Aragorn, and he was actually carrying it while he was in Bree.. he pulled the sword on the hobbits.. basically to show that he wans't a threat to them.(He didn't know about Gandalf's letter when he showed it.. with Bilbo's rhyme).<br>
<br>
Actually did anyone else notice that they took some credit away from Mary? (Meridoc).. In the movie it was Frodo who noticed the &quot;Riddle&quot; on the doors to Moria, and who mentioned &quot;Speak &quot;FRIEND&quot; and Enter&quot;  but in the movie, Frodo got the Credit for it.<br>
<br>
And it is spelled Balrog.. a creature of Morgoth (Sauron's Master, one of the Valir) <p><B>Tuffon Grease</B><br>

I would say the director did a masterful job in keeping the story largely intact. I am hoping that they will release a director's cut version of the movie on DVD with additional scenes that didn't make it to the theatre version. All in all, I can say that this is easily one of my favorite movies of all times. <p><b><font color="#FF0000",font size="+3">Ruuka Eno</font></b><br><i>Revenant of Innoruuk</i></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#f7f7f7><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon3.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub95.ezboard.com/uunfetered.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Unfetered</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Indifferent Poster</span><br>  Posts: 248<br> <font color=#778899>(12/31/01 2:24:27 am)</font><br>     <br>Community Supporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Lord of the Rings..</span><hr size=1> Brogun nice work.. however people could be led in the wrong direction of your initial description.<br>
Eru/Illuvatar is the One, the god who is top of the Heirachy who sung the great song and created the Valar, the lesser gods.  They added their voices to the song and created the universe and ultimatly the world.  The Valar then created the Miar, who were the lesser lesser gods, and these in turn became in themselves, gods of the land.  As in a god of the seas, god of the trees etc...<br>
Remember Morgoroth was a corrupt Valar and Sauron was a Miar who was drawn to his evil power and became his servent.  Infact it was Sauron who slew the great Finrod Felagund in their battle of Songs.<br>
<br>
After the defeat of Morgoroth when the Valar left the West to help the men/elves/dwarfes against the darkness of Angband and the land of Beleriand of lost forever, Numeonor was made.  The Valar broke a piece of land from middle earth and pulled it between the shores of Middle earth and Valinor (the land of the west) and their the men who aided the Valar were granted long life (500 years) and a paradise to live as long as they did not venture to the western lands.<br>
Sauron in time (Morgoroths right hand man) came to the men of Westernesse (Numenoreans) and he was both fair and kindly but he was decietful and Numenor was ultimatly destroyed by his designs.<br>
<br>
Those who were righteous managed to escape and fled the wrath of the Valar and came once again to Middle Earth were they then were seen as great men and so the Kingdoms were created from Gondor to Arnor.<br>
<br>
About this time the rings were created and also at this time the Wizards landed.<br>
5 their were, Miar sent from Valinor to help the land in the desperate times to come.  2 went eastward and were never again seen, one became a lover of birds and trees and poured his knowledge into land lore.  He was Radagast the Brown.  Another became involved in the dealings of man and elves.  He was Gandalf the Grey, but the most powerful of them all, Saruman the White, though he too involved himself with the dealings of man and Elves and did indeed head the white council of whome Gandalf, Elrond and Galadrial were members, he ultimatly spent his time in Isengard pouring over ring knowledge and plotting his designs to over throw the darklord and set himself up as a bastion of power for Middle Earth.<br>

Sauron had already made the One Ring by the time he was sent to Numenor. In fact, he went to Numenor as a prisoner 1,700 years after the creation of the ring. <br>
<br>
The Numenoreans were at the height of their power and so great was their might that Sauron knew he couldn't defeat them with force. So he seduced them with lies and corrupted the Numenoreans. Then he convinced their King to attack the Valar themselves and lay claim to Valanor believing that they could gain immortality if they were in possesion of the Undying Lands.<br>
<br>
Sauron did such a good job that his earthly form was destroyed when the wrath of the Valar caused the seas to swallow up Numenor. He was no longer able to assume a fair seeming form after this.<br>
<br>
*edit* <br>
I might be wrong in thinking that the Valar destroyed Numenor.<br>
So great was the might of the Numenoreans that the Valar themselves called on the aid of Eru himself. I'm at work right now and can't look it up.<br>

<br>
The Valar is really simply a term for the most powerful of the spirits created by Illuvatar out of his thought.  It specifically only applies to the most powerful 14 of them to enter Arda.  (Morgoth is no longer considered a member of the Valar.)<br>
<br>
The defeat of Morgoth at the hands of the Valar, Maiar, Elves, and Edain, led to the destruction of Angband.  The isle of Numenor was created , just past the midpoint of the way to Aman, as a reward to the Edain for their aid against Morgoth and their loyalty to the Elves.<br>
<br>
The men of Numenor did indeed have long life, but only the royal house, descended from Elros Halfelven, had life spans of 500 years, and even those spans waned as Numenor declined into folly.  Sauron did not just come to Numenor, either, but rather was brought when he surrendered to the High Men.  The king of Numenor at the time could not stand the thought that Sauron took the title King of Men, and thus attacked him.  When Sauron saw the size of the host, he surrendered and went to Numenor, where he slowly corrupted the people.<br>
<br>
Gorgar, you're right on your second thought - Numenor was destroyed when the Valar gave up their dominion and called on Eru Illuvatar to stop the Numenorians in their madness.  In response, he bent the world into a sphere and sank the island, killing Sauron's mortal form in the process.<br>
<br>
Also, Gorgar is right in that the Rings of Power were created before Sauron went to Numenor.<br>
<br>
Unfetered, close - looks like it's just been too long since you read the Silmarillion; you're a little rusty. <p>--------------------<BR>Hizuka - <a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=481" target=_blank>Profile</a><BR>Swifttail Disciple<BR>Initiate of the Celestial Fists<BR><BR>"In Void there is good but no evil.

<br>
The Valar did not create the maiar, as they did not have the power of creation. Only Eru, The One, had this power. One of the the Valar (can't recall his name at this time) did try to create his own race (the dwarves) but the results were like puppets. They had no will of thir own. Eru  intervened and gifted the newly made dwarves with spirit, but put them to sleep under the earth until after the first born (elves) had awoken. <p><img src="http://home.earthlink.net/~thorvard/Pics/Gorsig.GIF" border="0">

<br>
Just saw the movie and I was pleasantly surprised.  I came into the movie expecting to cringe and wince at every horrible miscue.<br>
<br>
Instead, I loved the grandness of it.  The director is clearly trying to capture the glory of the books.  Anyone who hasn't read them really should give them a real shot.<br>
<br>
They start slow, but builds up so huge that when the 3rd book is over you want to read it all again.  <br>
<br>
<br>
Minor complaints:<br>
<br>
* Elrond looked the part, but I thought he did not capture the tone or wisdom of Elrond at all.  <br>
<br>
* Merry and Pippin were not bumbling idiots as portrayed in the movie.  I guess they got stuck with the dumb-side-kick-for-humor role, but I hope the 2nd movie doesn't make them look so stupid, or weak.<br>
<br>
* I wish Glorfindel had been in the movie, although I understand why they needed to streamline the number of characters.  I just always loved that sequence in the book.  <br>
<br>
* I wish Boromir had a little more fight action before his last scene.  He was the mightiest human warrior, that's why he was there.  <br>
<br>
* Gimli was sad.  John Rhys-Davies is a horrible OVER-actor, and he did it here.  If that was him, I thought so.  That was a shallow portrayal, imho.  <br>
<br>
Best scene:<br>
<br>
* That scene with Galadriel by her mirror freaking rocked.  I loved that.  Worth the price of admission along.<br>
<br>
Most surprising:<br>
<br>
*  Legollas rocked.  I mean he quietly stole a number of scenes.  Graceful, elegant, fluid movement.  <br>
<br>
*  Gandalf rocked.  Christ, he was perfect.<br>
<br>
*  Galadriel rocked.  That part was tremendous.  High Elves ain't little sissies, and she showed why.<br>
