He was very ruthless in his quest for the enlightenment he sought. But when he was happy he could be a very compassionate person, almost like father figure, even at the age of 683. Rhendavud was also known widely as a grandmaster necromancer, and he was feared very much for it. While he had the size of a human he looked more akin to a drow with his bluish black skin and extreme intelligence. He had shoulder length white long hair with usually black eyes (his eyes changed color depending on his mood), He wore a dark black and purple robe with demonic runes and letters upon it, he also wore a cloak that was a black as goblins blood.<br>
<br>
He and his small contingent of bodyguards were headed to a shrine of Solsek Ro in the deserts of Ro to speak with the Flaming prince. &quot;Boy close the gates for the night, their will be no more offerings to the Flaming prince until dawn&quot; said Etaec the high priest of the shrine. &quot;Yes father”, said Adoesh the altar boy.<br>
<br>
Rhendavud and his small contingent stood at the base of the shrine, it had walls four feet thick and were thirty feet high. Some of Rhendavuds followers readied some rope to scale the walls, Rhendavud the dark Sorcerer himself just walked up the wall as if he were walking on grass. One of the priests was walking to his quarters with a guard not far behind, Rhendavud had made himself invisible and was standing in the hall. Wump wump wump.... Ohff what form of trickery is this! Rhendavud smiled a crooked smile as the priest try to figure out what he ran into. Rhendavud punched the priest in the stomach, exposing a blood covered fist protruding from the priest’s back. Then ever so simply the sorcerer raised his left hand and pinched in the middle of the air, the priests neck was smashed into a bloody pulp so fast he had no time to moan.<br>
<br>
The guard behind the priest turned around the corner where he thought the priest was, confused he turned around to see if the man had gotten behind him someone but he had not, when he turned around the Sorcerer was there grinning, the guard gulped in air to scream for help but it leaked our from the hole in his neck made by Rhendavuds finger that he had extended and formed into a sharp almost metallic point. The Sorcerer turned his head to listen; he heard nothing, that must have meant his assortment of dark followers were doing their jobs. Ever so Stealthily a Shadowknight came out from behind a tapestry behind a guard, he turned the man around and showed a finger in the mans eyesocket while stabbing a knife around the mans heart. He pulled out the mans eye tilted back his head and swallowed the mans eye. After a few seconds the shadowknight yanked out the guards heart so he could crush it in his palm before the man died.<br>
<br>
Elsewhere an Ogre hid around a corner waiting for two guards to come around the corner. When the guard rounded the corner the ogre swung full force with his double edged axe and lobbed the first guards head off, the second guard terrified ran the other way, the ogre reached for his axe but it was deeply embedded in the wall, so he picked up the other guards head and threw it at the running man, it hit the man with such force it shattered his leg, crawling away the massive ogre easily caught up with his prey. All twelve hundred pounds of evil sat upon the mans lower body crushing it, the guard screamed a earspliting scream. The ogre had a worried look on his face for a moment but then he picked the man up by the head with his massive hand and crushed the guards skull.<br>
<br>
Most of the guards were wounded dead or dying when Rhendavud entered the prayer area, his shadowknights and warriors assembled behind him. The Sorcerer ascended the stairs without touching them, when he reach the top he turned to the ogre whom let the guard scream. &quot;Tragnar you failed to kill the two patrolling guards without a sound, you failed me, I will not accept failure, You there, you are now in command of Tragnars squad&quot; hissed the sorcerer. The sorcerer turned his gaze to the now shamed ogre, Rhendavuds eyes began to turn all shades of colors, then when they reach a deep red they flared and the ogre was lifted into the air, promptly it began convulsing like something was under its skin and then it blew up in a shower of gore and blood, Rhendavuds men did not flinch as they were sprayed with gore. The sorcerer turned to the altar and began to call for Soulsek. When the flaming prince appeared he spoke immediately. &quot;Whomever awoke me had best be prepared to die, Oh... Rhendavud my child so good to see you, many thanks for the thousands of souls you sent me when you ransacked the villages&quot;. My lord I serve to please, but now I must ask, SLURRP AHH. The flaming prince looked over Rhendavuds shoulders and the sorcerer also turned his head. A younger dark elf had gotten the ogres blood on his hand and he was calmly licking it off when he noticed the god and sorcerer staring at him. Then he was lifted into the air only to receive a fate no one would wish to have. <br>
<br>
<br>
“ Dwarven ale is better man and that’s all I ave ta say”, said Bleuhawke the Mercenary. “Aye Dwarven ale is indeed a fine, strong, and bold brew but it cannot match this sweet nectar like tastes of a pint of gnomish spirits my friend”, Syithumis responded quickly. Toag shyly said “I prefer Elven wine because it tastes greater than any nectar and leaves no hangover in the mornings and..” QUIET,stay out of our conversation young one, Toag seemed very shocked that his Great Grandfather Bleuhawke had butted him out so quickly. Toag dropped his head for a moment but not for long, riding on horses had always been a thrill for him ever since he was a child, but what was even more of a thrill to him was Soen Syithumis’s sorceress apprentice, She was blond and beautiful with bright blue eyes that shine like sapphires. Toag always got nervous around her though, he would start to shake a bit and not talk very much, he was afraid of acting like a fool. Toag was told to be one of the bravest apprentices of the great warrior Bluehawke which was his own grandfather, yet he didn’t feel very brave, always cowering down anytime Soen got close to him. Currently Soen was rideing to the right of her master Syithumis which is known for being one of the most powerful wizard of the face of norrath. He took Soen as his apprentice when she was but a young woman of twenty years old. Syithumis had told Toag that the main reason he picked her is she was so flexible and very intelligient with magic especially for a young human girl, she learned to read runes and write at a very young age so that she could better comprehend spells and incantations. She was a very good pupil and at the academy, in the qualifying tests to enter the academy she had matched Syithumis’s score and impressed the judges which in itself was a hard feat.<br>
<br>
Soen quietly turned her head to observe Toag, He was everything a Mercenary should be and then some, he had field plate covering his chest and legs down to his knee’s, everything else was covered with two sets of ringmail to allow better mobility. He was very much like his grandfather Bleuhawke , Bleu and Toag are northmen, born to a harsh land knowing nothing but survival. Toag was amazingly strong for his young age of twenty seven, she had heard of his feats at the warriors guild and was impressed. Soen thought to herself I like him, to bad he is so bashful, and brunt. Another thing about Toag was he had no scars he was an undeafted fighter. Neither of them had seen real combat, though they had heard their teachers stories time and time again. <br>
<br>
“Hey Bleu would you like some of this fine pipe weed?” I would love ter try that pipe weed. The two friends stuffed their pipes fulls of the pipe weed and Syithumis proceded to lit his pipe and puff away happily. Unfortunately for Bleuhawke he had not brought anything to lit a pipe with so he held his hand outstretched and motioned for syithumis to lit the pipe. Syithumis searched his bags and then looked at Soen who was still staring at Toag, she promptly turned around and looked at him, the old wizard grinned and gave Soen a wink which totally befuddled her. Syithumis changed his expression and motioned for the pipe, Bleu stretched out a little further and right when their hand touched Syithumis shot a small flame from his hand and lit the pipe and Bleuhawkes beard. “By the gods!. “ the big man screamed and jumped of his horse and then he began to rug his face with mud the quench the flames, when Bleuhawke looked up everyone had a bland look on their face until they looked at his hands and face which was now covered in mud and then their laughter filled the plains, Bleuhawke had wiped his face with so much mud that he looked like Boar after a mud bath.<br>
<br>
Bleuhawke angrily swung at Syithumis and he missed and hit the horse giving it a large lump and sufficiently knocking it out. Syithumis had fallen of the horse and then he stood up and saw his mount twitching on the road and Bleuhawke swearing in at least three different tongues about his poor hand Syithumis began to laugh out loud again. Syithumis’s robes were very different from Rhendavuds they were a very bright blue with a gold trim and the runes upon his robe were not demonic. He had red hair down to his shoulders with a small red goatee he seemed very young for a wizard of one hundred and ninety two which was pretty damn old for a human, but one must remember a wizard lives longer then his normal counterparts. His friend Bleuhawke the mercenary was much the same but about one hundred years younger. Ever since all the old feuds and wars had been fought many peoples had a chance to live long and healthy lives, the oldest normal humans was nearly two hundred years old! <br>
<br>
After Syithumis’s horse regained consciousness and tried to kick Bleu they remounted and sped off over a hill filling the plains with a jolly laughter they saw a plume of grey and black smoke and immediately knew their destination had been attacked, they where headed to a small village in the west commons area.<br>
<br>
YA YA YA the four friends shouted to get to their mounts to speed up, the village had been ransacked and totally burnt to the ground. When they entered they had immediately noticed the strong stench of burnt corpses emanating for the center of the small village. As they rode past they saw much blood and charred limbs scattered along the way, “who ever did this has no heart” Toag said with a sickening voice, look over there.” Toag pointed toward what use to be a large stone building but now it was a crumbling mass of rock but what Toag was pointing at was what was beside. There where hundreds of died women and children Soen covered her mouth stunned in disbelief, shock that some was so heartless that they could murder so many children. They also saw a large assortment weapons scattered along the way indicating a large fight, when they reached the town square they saw four figure impaled upon wooden stakes that had been burnt. Upon Bleuhawkes closer inspection they prisoners had not been forced down but had been held in place until the weight of their bodies moved them further down the stake, then the attackers had used the still living people as target practice for various weapons, one of the men had his belly slashed open from a near miss from a very large arrow which had exposed his entrails to the fires making the stench more and more horrid. Then they heard a heard a low moan and turned looked for the sound. They found under a still smoldering inn sign a human male in black plate armor and with a longsword still tightly grasped in his hands. Bleuhawke pulled the man up from under the inn’s sign and the group made a quick shelter from the remaining timbers around the area. Later that night Soen was gathering wood to feed the fire when the man lifted his hand and pointed it at her hand and began chanting, she was gripped in fear, this man was going to kill her, She was about to scream when she noticed a screech , when she looked back at the man he looked better and was breathing easier, she found a dead rat near by without a scratch on it, the man they had found was a Darkknight, she had heard about them, sucking the life from people leaving them totally unscathed.<br>
<br>
The next morning the man could speak and they learned quiet a deal about what happened to the village it was ransacked by a dark army Lead by a old Sorcerer named Rhendavud. “By the way I myself am a Dark Knight , I was here on business and instead or running which would have been a much better idea I stayed and helped, we must have killed two hundred of those foul bastards but they kept coming, for everyone one we killed two more must have taken its place, these farmers and merchants fought well though, may I leave I still have pressing matters to attend to with a merchant I saw before I was knocked out”. “Everyone is dead!.” Bleuhawke said “Rhendavud&quot; Syithumis said in a low voice. Are you sure it was Rhendavud?” Syithumis ask. “Well the dark knight said, He soldiers called him Lord Rhendavud I remember hearing that before I was knocked out. <br>
<br>
Syithumis gave a worried look to Bleuhawke. “Rhendavud died about fifty years ago boy, I saw it with me own eyes” Bleuhawke said. “Yes I remember that day as if it where yesterday Syithumis interrupted, he was burned to death by the flaming prince himself, I’ll never forget the smell of his burning body nor the sound of his screams as the flame ate away his skin and flesh. You must have heard wrong boy” Syithumis said with confidence. “Where would he have heard the name then Syithumis?” Bleuhawke said with uneasy. “Rhendavud was famous, you should know that by now Bleu.”<br>
<br>
“Errr excuse me master Syithumis, Soen said, but who is Rhendavud?” Syithumis look at Soen a little shock. “ You don’t know who Rhendavud is?” Soen shook her head. “How about you?” Syithumis look at Toag. “No sir” Syithumis made a frown “Well I guess he’s not as famous as I thought. Well Syithumis began again, Rhendavud was the world most feared man about fifty years ago and the fear followed him up until the day he died. He was feared for everything under the sun, ruthlessly killing everything in his path, men, and women even children. He and his army of dark elves would destroy towns’ villages and cites in a few days and move on, always on the move he was, looking for something or someone. No one will ever know what he was looking for, and thats the reason why is he is dead , he was simply evil . Indeed I agree this does look like he destroyed this village here, the way they took the time to brutally kill people in painful ways does look like his work!” “Maybe he is died but his army still may have leaders to lead them and they did this” Soen said “No his army only followed their master and lord, they thought he was some kind of Prophet that would lead them to something great. Once he died his army fell apart and was no more&quot;. <br>
<br>
“I heard what I heard the Dark Knight said in a way that sounded like he was offended. And I have never heard of him tell now. His soldiers where not all dark elves either some where ogers and trolls a few humans as well. They attack at night, no one saw them coming, they just heard the sound of a hundred horns and from the blackness of night they came charging in to the village. At first I didn’t care and did not care to get involve so I started to leave and I would come back to do my business later, but when I started to see them kill children, It reminded me of something, something I hated, so I started to fight. They were well trained in the arts of combat and wore deep red armor, all of them even though some where human and some where elves they all wore deep red armor.”<br>
<br>
Syithumis look down toward the ground, “ indeed it does sound like Rhendavud he mumered. Syithumis looked back up at the Dark knight what is your name?” The dark knight look up at Syithumis and then look about down again. Yaoric he said, I came from Freeport.” “Syithumis, Bleuhawke said where will we be going if Sansoon is dead. I mean not to sound heartless of anything but he is no longer alive and he can’t hire us, what is are destination now?” <br>
<br>
Syithumis looked up at sky “Lets go to Freeport. There we can warn Sir Lucan and the Knights guild master of this event. I am sure they will be most interested and may even join together for some time to find out who has the leadership skills to make an army attack a village and slaughter everyone in it all in a few days.” “ Aye Bleuhawke grunted once we do that lets try and find work to do in Freeport, I am sure there is someone there that needs us to do there dirty work. Sounds good Syithumis said with approval. Bleu then look at Yaoric. “You Came from Freeport do you plan to go back?” Yaoric lifted his head and look around the once use to be village. “Yes” he said gloomely. “Good Bleu said then you can travel with us to Freeport always nice to have another MAN around. At this Toag looked at bleu with hurtful eyes and started to say something but was cut off by Bleu. “Can I ask something Yaoric?” Which is better Dwarven Ale or Gnomeish spirits?<br>
