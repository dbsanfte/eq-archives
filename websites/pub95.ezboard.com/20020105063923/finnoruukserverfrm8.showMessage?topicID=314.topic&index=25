If you wish to respond by attacking me personally, then you're making more of a statement about yourself than about me.  Some people judge others by their actions, and not by their words on a message board.  I stand by my actions.  In the game, I act as if I could be held responsible for what I do, unlike many who act a certain way because they know they are anonymous and can't be held responsible.<br>
<br>
As for RF being FiF, this is somewhat like NK saying that the planes are FFA.  My personal opinion is that if your cleric needed Ragefire, he should have camped it like 98 percent of the other clerics on the server, and not done it this way.  But again, this is only my personal opinion.<br>

Well 1 we didn't have a tracker in zone, someone from another guild told me he was up and that no one had enough people even close to getting him.  We formed up cleared way ( couple of giants here and there ) and proceeded to kill ragefire for siltano who like others said is a main and has been waiting 6 months or so for his last piece.  Do I feel a bit bad about this whole thing? sure a bit.  Had they the people there to kill ragefire I would have walked away.  Had I been camping there all night and someone brought enough people to kill it when I didn't....I would walk away.  I would be bummed, but I would walk away.  When I zoned into solb there was 2 twist of fait people in zone.  This was not even close in my book.<br>
<br>
     As to your other point of AV doesn't talk to others, snubs others, ask anyone about tuur, tuuran, tukuk.  I've always been helpful to others, given hints on strats to do stuff and even told time and time again &quot;what is the stats on that object your wearing&quot;  We have gotten other people epic items, etc.  Would probably say we are no worse or no better than any other guild on this server.<br>
<br>
PS: this couldn't have been as bad as you said since not more than the next day you were asking me to duo with you in thedeep.  You didn't have the people there to do the job, and at least 1 other guild than ours was trying to mass to come as well.  Well just my 2 cents<br>
<br>
Oh and as far as the sleeper thing is concerned, blame verant not us on that one.  I don't think anyone in av wrote the script on how killing the last warder kills off the warders for good.  If it wasn`t us LOD would have put him down the next week as they had tried the week before.  It was a damn fun fight, a 1 time only server event that I was proud to be apart of.  I have no regrets over it at all. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub95.ezboard.com/utukukbiggbutae.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Tukuk Biggbutae</A> at: 12/31/01 8:42:33 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#f7f7f7><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub95.ezboard.com/uwarwizzie.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Warwizzie</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.stopstart.fsnet.co.uk/smilie/FIREdevil.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Scowling Poster</span><br>  Posts: 12<br> <font color=#778899>(12/31/01 8:49:51 pm)</font><br>    <BR><img src=http://www.wowsie.com/charms/wizard.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: My response to AV's year in review</span><hr size=1> I am sorry for what happened to you Bel.<br>

<br>
As much as I loathe to say it Ragefire is indeed first in Force. This is why you see entire guilds doing the camp. It cannot be held by one person or even one group.<br>
<br>
Ask Invictorum - camped Ragefire 83 hours - the entire guild. And that was their 4th or 5th RF camp.<br>
<br>
When I camped mine. I made damn sure I had the firepower on hand or camped out in zone to pull it off as soon as he popped.<br>
<br>
Heck we even let all the fire giants up to the Naggy staging area spawn to give us a &quot;safety net&quot; to work with (figuring it would take a bigger guild a few minutes to clear their way and we would be ready to go at that point).<br>
<br>
Ragefire is probably one of THE most contested spawns on the server. You just have to take precautions.<br>
<br>
Anyway, this entire Ragefire issue was beaten to death many months ago. Nothing will change with the way it is done. <p><center><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=29713"><img src="http://www.somuchtuttle.com/pics/eq/soulshieldbanner.jpg" border=0></center></a>

<br>
It would have been easier for you to actually talk to your guildmates to find out that I was polite, that I explained the situation, and that I asked if they could &quot;please&quot; let me have the camp because I'd committed quite a bit of work to it, and they had committed none.  I'll post the log of my exact words if you wish.<br>
<br>
I never did any of the things that Corvan wants to smear me with.  If he'd taken 1 minute to talk to his guildmates, he'd know that was true.<br>
<br>
I'm sure that making me out to be a total ass in Corvan's fertile imagination makes it easier for him to accept what AV did.  Or perhaps it's just easier to smear me with lies, than try to defend the facts of the situation.  However, I must ask that in the future you try to be factually correct.<br>
<br>
As for those who have replied, &quot;Sorry, Bel, that's the way the camp is, and the stronger forces have always been able to do this and you should accept it as the way it should be,&quot; I will say thank you, I do recognize this to be the way it is, but I don't think it's the right way, and I certainly don't accept it as the way it must be.  First in force is the reality of the Norrath world, but it doesn't have to be that way.  Perhaps it's a shame that Innoruuk never agreed upon a rotation system.  Even some of the Ashen Vendetta folks have kindly told me that they wished it had turned out another way.  The fact that they are unhappy with the resolution says that something is wrong.<br>
<br>
The other alternative for Ashen Vendetta was to have told Salitano, &quot;Sorry, we're leaving because someone else put in hours of work and commitment, and we respect that.  But hey Sal, don't worry. We won't make you wait another 6 months.  As soon as Bel's group is done, we'll rotate people here until Ragefire spawns and you'll have your clicker within 3 days, I promise.&quot;<br>
<br>
My guild is a great, great group of friends and this week they proved that by making sure we got the clicker within 3 days of when we resolved, as a guild, to do it.  The responsibility for having fallen asleep and not having sufficient help there was entirely my own, and based upon a misplaced desire to impose on my small group of friends and their real lives as little as possible.  This week, they showed, they stayed, and they gave of themselves despite my protests.  I thank them for it personally, and I salute them for their commitment to the good of our merry band.  Salitano and everyone else in this game should be so lucky.  <br>
<br>
Bel<br>
<br>
P.S. I'll send an anonymous shout out to the other fine guild and folks who came so quickly for the Ragefire kill, since I'm not sure they want to be associated with this mess.<br>

How could you sit there and say @#%$ like ''oh he was camping it asleep, he wasnt in zone, his corpse was camping it, etc.''<br>
<br>
1.) He was bound to the fuckin lair resulting in him getting Death looped..  Damn! there goes the &quot;he wasnt in zone&quot; theory!<br>
<br>
2.) How could he have engaged in conversation with you guys if he was camping it asleep!?! ono! there goes theory #2 !<br>
<br>
3.) He was being res'd left and right by a few differant clerics when you ran right past him...Uh oh we've run out of theories!<br>
<br>
Belarios is far from a whiner, if you actually knew him you'd like him.  Bel has always been a fair person and cared for others turns, feelings, etc.  Of course since you're all &quot;Goal Orientated&quot; why dont we just say @#%$ on feelings, or even better, others in general<br>
<br>
We just got done with our RF camp and got a very deserving cleric(philarios)not twink his epic.  <br>
<br>
Onto the post about TOF running over Finite at VS..hah.. We gave Finite 2 shots at him, which you both failed, and you didnt know wtf you were doing and he end up in some room near the LCY, he aggro'd me and i ran him to zone where we killed him, While we were fighting him a bunch of finite members engaged him trying to kill him for themselves. <br>
<br>
Back to Ashen Vendetta..<br>
<br>
Just because you have your 350 members doesnt mean you have the right to judge what sufficient force is.  If Twist of Fate has 10 members there, then you'd better believe its suffiecient force, we've done much harder things with less people than many guilds, so you have no right in hell to tell us what our sufficient force is.<br>
<br>
Now, there are a few members of AV that i like and have known since the early days of EQ, but the guild as a hole is  arrogant, self centered, we come first you come after.  Twist of Fate has never even attempted to touch any of your camps, spawns, etc.  and we've always done things without much contreversy fashion(which i couldnt say about AV).<br>
<br>
You sit there behind your computer not knowing belarios at all and say he is an &quot;uber guild hater'' or something like that.  You have no idea.. Bel has never showed any signs of dislike towards a big guild.  He is a person who would rather do things with a smaller group of friends than be with a bunch of people who act like they're 6 nearing 7 and talk about their phat lewt all day.  <br>
<br>
I need to get some damn sleep now because i've only gotten about 5 hours in the last 3 nights camping Ragefire making sure we had enough people there to not be overrun by a bunch of jack asses again..<br>
<br>
Tumal<br>
<br>
P.S.  If you've ever had a problem with Twist of Fate it was most likely Dodrano or Myself's doing.(seeing we are the 2 biggest jerks in Twist of Fate)  However, we will never do something that deprives another from achieving what they wish to achieve, for example, when we killed the Prince in Trakanon's Teeth during the GM quest, we waited until AFTER everyone got their loot, no harm done. =)  <br>
