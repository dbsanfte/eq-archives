<br>
There was some research done in the 1970's to see if Nazi Germany could have invaded England in 1940.  The answer was, that by force of arms yes they could it, but logistically, NO.  Even with the RAF knocked out, the Germans did not have enough equipment to supply an invasion or to transport an adequate force.  Unrealized by most is that more horses were used as transport by the combatants of WWII than in any other before or since. Throughout the war captured trucks were taken by German units to supplement what organic transport they had. Landing barges to transport the troops were in short supply and not in any adequate numbers to deliver a sufficient force.  Germany would had to strip all the motorized transport, military and civilian, to attempt the invasion.  By comparison, landing craft and barges used by the Allies were in constant short supply.  The ones used in North Africa were used again in Sicily and Italy.  One of the expected shortages was foreseen for the Normandy Invasion were landing craft.  Supplies earmarked for the Pacific were sent to England for use in Normandy.  Afterwards they were routed back to the Pacific.<br>
<br>
This I know doesn't address the fear the British people held at that time. Being of partial British descent, I understand it.  I have family that survived the Blitz and don not take this subject lightly.  My grandfather grew up in Churchill's constituency in Oldham. <br>
<br>
The Reuben James and her sisters relieved a number British vessels from convoy duty, helping the British Navy.  Also, the lend-lease destroyers were the old 4-stackers of that same vintage.<br>

FDR was dying to get us into WWII, not because &quot;he saw the need&quot;, but because he saw we weren't pulling out of the Depression. Like Hitler and Mussolini, he saw the war as a means to do what all his socialist programs couldn't.<br>
<br>
And what reason was given for the sinking of the ships in the Atlantic? You said it yourself; doing convoy duty. Aiding the Allies. Big surprise. (It's balanced, though; Joe Kennedy was selling ammunition to the Germans...)<br>
<br>
FDR was a scumbag. The only President to do as much harm to the nation was Jimmy &quot;NoBalls&quot; Carter.<br>
<br>
<br>
PS... I didn't know supplies earmarked for the Pacific were sent to England for Normandy first. More scumbaggage. The U.S.'s real war was in the Pacific at the time. I'll still never understand what the emphasis the (scumbag) powers that be put on Europe, rather than the Pacific in several ways. Most Americans didn't know about the death camps until well into the war. And so *what*.. who's going to liberate the death camps if the Japanese were marching down Main Street U.S.A.? They ended up winning the war anyway, thanks to... you got it.. scumbags like Truman and Marshall.<br>

<br>
Is it a basic human right to eat?  Then get on your high-horse and talk about those places in the world where people are starving.  @#%$, why is it that if we fed the prisoners once a day we are awful people, but yet if they are only used to eating twice a week I don't see anyone crying over it.  They came from a society where the priests could come by and do whatever they wanted to them, even take their lives.  I hear people say &quot;We shouldn't cut their hair and enforce our standards on them&quot;.  Damn right.  We should feed them every other day some cold stale rice, and beat them regularly.  Force them at gunpoint to pray 10000 times a day, and live in fear just like they do at home.  If we want information, let's just torture them.  I mean, we have no right to enforce our standards on them do we?  <br>
<br>
I know, we are supposed to be better people then them.  Other then the shackles, I would think a nice, safe, quiet life with three meals every day, and running water is far better then they had at home.  Far, far better then they deserve.  And GD far, far, FAR better then they ever treated their enemies when they were in power. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#f7f7f7><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub95.ezboard.com/ugibbbles.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Gibbbles</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Scowling Poster</span><br> <font color=#778899>(1/24/02 4:59:05 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub95.ezboard.com/finnoruukserverfrm8.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=373.topic&index=28>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: USA</span><hr size=1> Kill all those ragheads and let God, Allah, or Innoruuk sort em out. <br>

<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>  NOW YOU HAVE IT!<br>
Now you know exactly what is being done to <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i>  males</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> in this country (particularly those of european stock, but I won't go into that for concern of evoking the &quot;cover the ears and shout racist&quot; reflex in some.)</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
Don't gripe and moan about the treatment of women in Afghanistan; it only differs from the treatment of males here in degree, not in kind. (For those of you still studying Dr. Seuss, I said males here are brainwashed and denegrated the same way Ugle claims the Afghan females are, just not as severly... yet.)<br>
<br>
It's okay for us to brainwash and tear down people here according to our commonly accepted bigotries, but don't let the Afghans do it in their own country. Make up your (sexual reference that would otherwise be edited) mind, people. Either females are equal or they are helpless little victims, unable to defend themselves or think for themselves. Such idiotic ideas always imply that insecure males feel the need to put someone down (or insecure &lt;insert target group in power du jour here&gt; for that matter) and therefore found a whipping boy. Which is of course pure bovine leavings. If that were the case, females everywhere would be in the boat the Afghan females are. The only reason the feminazi movement got anywhere in the west was because some men actually *care* about women. <br>
The other fallacy in that is suggesting that it's a matter of brainwashing that puts one person subject to another. Is it brainwashing that children are subject to adults? No? Then why are they subject to the rule of parents and all other adults, if not oppression? Yeah, that thought you're thinking right now as to why... that's why females have historically been subject to males.<br>
<br>
Tell you what; remove all the male soldiers (redundant, I know) guarding the detainees and have only American female members of the military guard them. We can have a lottery on how long it takes before there's a <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i>  successful</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> escape attempt. It'll be measured in hours, not days. Get a clue; the Al Quaida and Taliban forces don't screw around with bovine feces &quot;equality&quot;. <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> Watch the media, from advertising to movies to video games; repeat that quote again and again, everyone. &quot;. Tell someone they suck long enough and that they only exist to serve and they start believing it. &quot; Ugle has revealed the campaign taking place right here in the U.S.  Five bucks says no one campaigns to put a stop to <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> it</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--></b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
Why does the plight of females in Afghanistan keep coming up? It's totally, completely, and in all other ways <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>  irrelevant</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> We are <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i>  not</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> fighting in Afghanistan to free the oppressed or enforce political correctness! At least that's not how the campaign was sold to us right after the attack. We are there to eliminate, however possible or necessary, those threats to the U.S. Period. End of public financing. I want to see the balance sheet that indicates that it's cheaper to rebuild Afghanistan than eliminate its population. I want to see the reports indicating that rebuilding Afghanistan (yet again) will eliminate the threat of harm to the U.S. <br>
I think the Afghans are idiots for slapping their foreheads against the floor 6 times a day; in other words, for following Islam. Is that a reason to &quot;liberate&quot; Afghanistan? So why do some people think their disapproval of the other practices of the Afghans (like severe penalties for violating strict religious rules relating to Islam) is reason to &quot;liberate&quot; Afghanistan?<br>
<br>
Maybe we'll get lucky and history will repeat in more ways than our following in British and Russian footsteps. Maybe there will be the Afghan equivalent of &quot;boat people&quot; flooding the U.S. as happened after the Indochinese War. Bringing with them, as did the boat people, their cultural philosophies.<br>

I must have hit an exposed nerve there.  Remember FDR had Joe Kennedy removed as Ambassador to England for his stated views about Germany. I don't have any fondness for that family and their abuses.  Both of Joe Kennedy's older sons went into the military, but they supported their father's view.  JFK only went to the Pacific to save his ass.  He was caught having an affair with a known German spy. He had a nice comfy position in the Pentagon prior to that.<br>
<br>
The Reuben James was doing convoy duty for US flag vessels.  Prior to that, the Germans declared unlimited sinking of vessels across the Atlantic.  US vessels were sunk in broad daylight in view of swimmers on beaches along the east coast. Sure FDR knew we had to kick the manufacturers up to get us finally out of the Great Depression, he knew that we were going to war, like it or not.<br>
<br>
If you want to point your finger at German supporters, don't limit it to Democrats.  Henry Ford used to have a portrait of Hitler hanging in his office. Lindberg may not have been a German supporter.  Some sources place him as spying for the US government on an informal basis. Letting his contacts in Germany unwittingly help us to obtain information.<br>
<br>
Politics also had alot to do with the emphasis on one theater or another.  Agreements at Oran and prior gave little leeway to where resources were sent.  Russia was putting a lot of pressure for a second front to be opened.  <br>
<br>
The Japanese army and naval forces did not have the resources to do more than possibly, only possibly invade the Hawaiian Islands.  Their invasion of the Aleutians was only  a side show that they weren't prepared to expand upon.  Most of their armed forces were deeply involved with operations in China and Burma. Once our newer fleet submarines made their appearance vulnerable Japanese shipping was damaged soundly.  The Japanese didn't have the resources that we had.  FDR cut them off from our scrap metal supplies which hurt their heavy industry prior to Pearl Harbor. By hemming them in and cutting off supplies of raw materials we had already stopped their military potential. <br>
<br>
The earlier Japanese attacks were well planned and executed.  In Jungle warfare the Australian troops showed to be at least their equals if not better in performance.  There were not the layed out jungle trails and paths in New Guinea as there was in Malaysia. When a Japanese Division tried to cross the mountains there, it wasn't Allied troops that stopped them as much as it was the jungle itself.  The jungle ripped them to less than half strength. In Guadalcanal as wel,l the jungle was our ally as much as it was our enemy.<br>
<br>
Nobody can justify the barbaric treatment that the Japanese gave to all prisoners that they captured.  Including what they did to the Chinese civilians, Medical testing and all.<br>
<br>
You should read &quot;Foo&quot; the memoirs of Frank Fujita.  He was a member an artillery battalion of the Texas Division that went to Java and was captured there spending the rest of the war as a POW.  Frank was half Japanese, the Japanese wanted to use him for propaganda purposes. You should read it. <br>
<br>
One last thing, I lived through Jimmie Carter.  He was too much of a hands-on leader and should have delegated more. He did cut off the Soviet Union from supplies of US microchips. When a MiG 25 landed in Japan with a defecting pilot it was found that all the microchips on board were products of Texas Instruments.  Most of the other electronics was based upon vacuum tubes.  People laughed at Jimmie Carter for doing that embargo.  The hostage situation with Iran was a troublesome affair.  Iran was probably weakening Carter's position by secretly talking to Reagan.<br>
<br>
I can go on and on with this.  There are multiple views on all these subjects and these are mine based upon what I have read and lived through. Good books to read are any by Carlo d'Este about the European Theater. <br>

Your explanation is a bit muddled but you still hit the nail on the head.<br>
<br>
&quot;If you think of yourselves as helpless and ineffectual, it is certain that you will create a despotic government to be your master. The wise despot, therefore, maintains among his subjects a popular sense that they are helpless and ineffectual.&quot; - Frank Herbert -<br>
<br>
&quot;A democracy cannot exist as a permanent form of government. It can only exist until the voters discover that they can vote themselves money from the Public Treasury. From that moment on, the majority always votes for the candidate promising the most benefits from the Public Treasury with the result that a democracy always collapses over loose fiscal policy always followed by dictatorship.&quot; - Alexander Fraser Tyler -<br>

SCREW the agreement of Oran! The second it was signed FDR should have been shot for treason, if it dictated where we sent material.<br>
<br>
(sidebar: I don't believe the jungle could have been much of an ally to the U.S. According to one Japanese officer interviewed, we never fought in the jungle. We blew the jungle away and fought in the craters (as God intended <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :lol --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/laugh.gif ALT=":lol"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> ))<br>
<br>
Actually, let's stop wasting time.<br>
<br>
WWII was started as a secret plot by the U.S. to get the rest of the world fighting. Pearl Harbor wasn't actually attacked by the Japanese; they sent a friendship delegation fleet to discuss terms for mutually beneficial relations, and we ambushed them unexpectedly. Being arrogant and overbearing as all Americans have always been since 1492, we underestimated the resolve of their security guards who responded with pepperspray. We then blew up our own fleet to start the war.<br>
And, of course, the real scandal of the war in Europe is that it took so long. The German army actually only employed 8 footsoldiers equipped with clubs and rocks, while the U.S. attacked them mercilessly with nuclear powered battle tanks (known as &quot;Bolos&quot; I believe) and our supersonic aircraft flew mission after mission shooting down their entire air force of 18 unarmed hot-air balloons. The V1 and V2 rockets were a myth we created to hide the secret R&amp;D project we had going at area 51 as a delivery system for our nuclear bombs, which we were going to rain down on Mars as soon as we'd whipped the Germans and Japanese. that's why the Viking probes showed Mars to be a dead landscape even though Schiappereli had shown at the turn of the century that they had a high culture there including an extensive canal system.<br>
<br>
The death camps, however, really were death camps. That's where the Germans had their elite forces armed with machine guns and nightvision goggles to ensure that none of the suffering victims overpowered their guards and escaped. Of course, there were thousands of attemps, most of which were successful in spite of the prisoners being half-starved and unarmed. Here in the U.S. in the concentration camps, none of the 322 million prisoners even tried to escape, because they were all staked out on anthills for 4 years. In fact, the last two escaped just last week. In CNN interview one of them related how he'd been forced to witness the execution by beheading of 48 million prisoners who tried to escape by asking a guard, &quot;The war's been over 40 years, can we go home now, pleeeease?&quot;<br>
<br>
Revisionist history is fun.<br>
<br>
As for Jimmy Carter, that ain't history, that's personal. He was too hands-on because he was a f-ing incompetent balless wonder. He <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> emasculated</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> my country. I'd kiss &quot;Jihad&quot; Johnny Walker's poop-covered butt if it meant Carter were to be tried for treason in his place. &quot;We'll have to just get used to being just another country&quot;... &quot;We'll have to tighten our belts&quot;... &quot;The future will be darker than it has been&quot;. &quot;We live in a world of limited resources. &quot; (How limited can a world 15 billion lightyears across be???) Screw Russians getting microchips. He didn't stop the damned Japanese invasion. He read the fallacious Club of Rome reports and believed it as if he were a Branch Davidian at Waco. <br>
There is <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> still</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> no proof that Iran was &quot;talking with&quot; Reagan at the time of the hostage crisis. If Carter hadn't been the boob he is, the rescue attempt wouldn't have failed, and had it failed, there would have been another, or an all-out war with Iran. Why did it fail? Because typical of weak-kneed left-wing liberals (not all left-wing liberals are weak-kneed), Carter virtually destroyed our military. Ruined morale, allowed budget cuts which made it essentially impotent, and didn't even act like a commander-in-chief. <br>
Carter was that creepy teacher you always prayed you wouldn't get in highschool; the one more concerned about the social climate of his classroom than in teaching. <br>
The Iranians coughed up the hostages after Reagan had won the election. The fact that he convinced them along with the rest of the world that the days of a balless wonder in the White House were over is often dismissed.<br>
As someone whose life was destroyed by Jimmy Carter, and who was rebuilt by President Reagan, I can verify the truth of what Ugle said in another thread: tell someone they're no good, and they won't be. Tell them they can't, and they won't.<br>
 <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> Long before 9/11, President Reagan was calling the common man, the firefighters, the police, the mail carriers, the guy who makes the donuts, heroes.</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
 Carter told us we were impotant and unimportant. That the future was going to be terrible because we were bad and there's nothing we can do about it. <br>
President Reagan then came along and told us we each could build the future, that each of us was important. That the world was going to be a better place because we were going to make it a better place, because we were good people. And he was right. I'll forever be grateful to him and the 1980 U.S. Hockey team (bless you Jim Craig wherever you are) and I'll always hate Jimmy Carter. Osama Bin Laden I might someday forgive. Maybe... once he's dead. I'll always hate Carter and pee on his grave.<br>
<br>
That's what this BS about the detainees is all about, too. We're good people, but we're being flogged for not being perfect. Well, it's not a perfect world. And we're only good, not God.<br>
<br>
<br>

<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>  NOTE: I will do nothing in any way to offer any form of harm to Jimmy Carter beyond asserting what a waste of skin he is.
