Let me know what you think.  If you have read the history of Bartel this is later that same day.<br><br><br>Memories of my years of training in Kaladim seem so distant in my wanderings all over Faydwer.  I found myself more competent and able to control my healing powers.  Though not very efficient I am assured they will grow as does time with me.  I chuckled in thinking glad I am a dwarf so I have at least a couple hundred years to get it right.  I was sitting at the docks in Butcherblock awaiting the boat to arrive to take me to the city of Freeport.  A loathsome city filled with humans.  I haven’t known too many humans or at least seen much more than what I hunted.  I figured this would be the time to find out what my fate has in store for me.<br><br>Hey dwarf you going to Freeport? a voice belonging to a wood elf near by.  Without having to respond I noted I failed in seeing the boat had arrived.  Thought to myself I need to be a bit more alert in things that subtle sneaking up on me..especially something that large.  I quickly boarded the boat and made my way below deck.  An ominous storm was coming over the horizon and I knew this would be a long trip over.<br><br>A few hours passed and I found myself at the docks of Freeport greeted by a foul smelling odor in the air. Humph these humans have a very peculiar odor to them.  Hold thy tongue in check dwarf.  I glanced to the voice to be staring at a Freeport guard.  Well if its not you causing the smell then what is? I asked.  We get all types of creatures wandering through this port.  Barbarians, Elves, Humans and Dwarves frequent this place.  What of any other races say like Ogre perhaps?  The guard gave me a stern look.  No ogre’s may be allowed with in these city walls.  They have to prove themselves worthy to set foot in this city. We learned they were sneaking in through the sewer system here.  Some patrols were set up to watch for the sort but some never returned.  No answers were found so it was closed off and warned all not to travel down there for their own sake.<br><br>I thanked the guard for the information he gave me and set off to view this city.  I wandered the streets a while quickly learning that the city borders a vast desert and a more lush terrain known as East Commonlands.  Not really looking to get all sweaty from desert travel for no reason and I had a yearning to see some green grass from all that time out on the boat.  I picked up a few things and began making my way out to west Freeport.  Upon coming to the gates I knew something was not right and that thought came true when I saw an Ogre inside the city walls.  I walked slowly gripping my mace tightly in hand.  As I crept up on the ogre I witnessed humans bartering with the ogre.  I had no idea of what to think of this matter.  I looked on bewildered of this not noticing the ogre was looking dead at me.  I jumped back startled now awaiting the battle to begin.<br><br>Have you seen the new pickles I just got in? the ogre remarked.  How do you know how to speak so well there ogre?  The ogre had a blank look on his face and started to laugh.  You mus be new here.  Meeza  no mean ogah  I help in Freeport army bashing many orkies.  Da more I bashed meeza liked more.  Now meeza liked so much can sell me pickles here.  Why are you selling them here? I asked.  Dat’s easy all da otha ogah’s make pickles too.  Meeza make no money when all udder ogah’s selling pickles.  Meeza come here to sell.  Gud money made here.  I had to run this through my mind several times over thinking that ogre’s could be good.  An image of the blood on my hands from my brother haunts me and being told an ogre can turn good is too much.  I bided the ogre good day and set off for East Commonlands to rest and clear my head.<br><br>I made my way into the East Commonlands and found a hearty tree that I can sit and rest so I can sort out all of these things on my first day in the city.  Before I was able to set the rest of my gear down I felt a fast breeze hit me from behind.  I looked up to see something running in the opposite direction I came from at a  high pace and disappearing into the very air.  I rubbed my eyes hard to be sure they weren’t playing tricks on me but as I looked on I saw not a single trace of whatever that was.  Pondering this I heard footsteps moving quickly towards me.  I scrambled to get all my gear together knowing this can’t be good but before I could I knew what that thing was running from.  Before me running in the same direction as that other one was came an orc centurion.  This one seemed larger than the ones I fought in crushbone.  I moved out of the way and the orc passed by me without a care in the world.  I thought that to be very strange till the orc stopped where that other one was running disappeared at and proceeded to swing its weapon into seemingly thin air.  That is when I saw the other image reappear out of nothing.  This time I knew the other being was a dark elf.  I moved closer to the battle and saw that the dark elf was bleeding heavily, limping on one side and also a female.  The orc was slashing hard and fast trying to kill the dark elf.  I began to wander away from the fight finding it being one less dark elf in the world is better off for me that is until I saw the dark elf’s face.<br><br>Normally I would of left this Tier-Dal to die but something stopped me.  Even though looking at the face of this dark elf was brief it seemed like I have been looking at her for an eternity.  In the midst of the confusion of my mind my hands began to radiate light blue.  When I looked at em I knew that I had to save this dark elf.  I began focusing my mind on healing her as fast as possible.  The orc swung its sword down knocking the weapon from the dark elf’s hand and was re-adjusting to place the finishing blow into the dark elf’s body.  At that moment the dark elf was covered in a light blue aura and fell to the ground.  The orc looked on bewildered and realized I was still nearby.  It knew I had jus healed her and came after me.  I steadied my mace and began chanting again.<br><br>By the hand of Brell Serilis I smite thee orc centurion!<br><br>The orc was thrown back some when the force of my damage spell hit em but his paced was only slowed a moment.  Now even more enraged it closed in on me.  I began my chant again but before I could complete the orc knocked me off my footing causing me to loose concentration.  I began to get up till the orc came and pressed his foot on my chest holding me firm to the ground.  It raised its sword directly poised over my face and brought the sword in a downward thrust.  I closed my eyes tightly awaiting my final doom.<br><br>In my waiting it seemed to be taking a while and the pressure on my chest felt lighter. I opened my eyes to see the sword mere inches from my nose and the orc with a surprised look on his face.  As I looked on the orc fell off of me and to my side.  I looked over at the orc and found a throwing knife buried deep into its head.  I let out a sigh of relief and was pulled from the ground forcefully to my feet.  I stood there looking face to face at the Tier-Dal.<br><br>What do you think you are doing dorf?!?!  Saving your life you ungrateful Tier-Dal what do you think.  Saving me??  the Tier-dal began laughing at me.  Saving me he says.  If you look at the orc you’ll see a knife in his head and from where my standpoint was you didn’t look to be doing much saving.  I scowled at the dark elf as she went over to the orc to remove her dagger.  I noted how she limped over to the corpse. Do you need any assistance on that bum leg you have there?  I am quite fine thank-you very much.  Now go toddle along and go bother some other dorf or something else.  Upon her saying that she fell to the ground screaming in pain and grasping her leg.<br><br>Oh for crying out loud you big baby.  I wandered over and began to place my hands over the leg.  What do you think you are doing?  Trying to make a move on me while I’m down?  I’ll use your head for my mantle piece over my fireplace dorf.  Would you pipe down a moment I said.  I closed my eyes and channeled a healing spell over her leg.  In my concentration I heard the words Sorine mumbled from the dark elf.  Still holding my concentration her leg began to mend.  A sigh of relief passed over the dark elf’s face.  Your leg has been healed but go easy on it.  The healing effects will take a few moments to clear so you’ll have full mobility.<br><br>Not even adhering to my words she stood up and fell back over on top of me.  Did you not hear a word I said to you? scowling at her.  My leg is fine now just leave me be.  Fine!  I’ll jus take my things and take my leave of you.  I started to pick-up my things and got myself ready to go.  So your name is Sorine I take it.  The dark-elf looked at me..how did you know that?  You mumble things when you were flopping around like a fish when your leg was hurting.   I was not flopping around like a fish dorf!  How would you like it if I smacked you with a couple of em huh?  Sorine started to dig in her bags at a furious pace.<br><br>Bartel I said to her.  She stopped at that moment tearing her bag apart and looked at me.  My name is Bartel.  I am a cleric of Brell Serilis and it is my duty to help those in need.  Ohhh help those in need huh?  Where were you planning on going when I had that orc trying to use his sword to remove my spleen huh? I thought you had it under control…had no need of me.  Yeah yeah yeah dorf…jus remember you owe me one.  Hefting my bags on my back…I looked at Sorine.  Owe you one?  How do you figure I owe you one?  If I count the score I say we are even.  Oh no we are not dorf…I killed the orc centurion, which makes it you owe me.  So to make sure you pay me back I am going to be following you.  You just want a personal healer cause you can’t handle the orcs by yourself.  Now listen here dorf!<br><br>This is going to be a long day. <p><br><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=190976">Magelo Profile</a><br></p><span class=m><i></i></span><hr size=1><span class=m> Posts: <b>119</b>  </span></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td colspan=2><table cellpadding=8 cellspacing=0 width=100%><tr><td nowrap width=20% valign=top><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub95.ezboard.com/bebonmoon.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=blackpointsorrowbladethistletongue>Blackpoint Sorrowblade Thistletongue</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/anim_1.gif" BORDER=0> </span><br> <span class=usertitle>Melee Elder</span><br> <BR><img src=http://ebonmoon.com/images/members/blackpoint.JPG WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top width=80% class=m><span class=title>   Re: An Unlikely Alliance</span><br><span class=m><font color=#778899>Posted: 8/11/02 9:21:07 pm</font>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>   &nbsp;&nbsp;<a href=http://pub95.ezboard.com/febonmoonfrm2.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=42.topic&index=1><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/ultimate/reply.gif border=0 width=20 height=20 alt="reply to this message" align=absmiddle></a>   <hr size=1> I didn't know if you wanted feedback posted underneathe but if so i can have this post removed and placed else were<br><br>Very nice Bartel - you did a good job w/ your descriptions and the like.
