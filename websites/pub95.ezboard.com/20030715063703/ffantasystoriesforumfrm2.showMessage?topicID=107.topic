Dragon's Crest<br>
<br>
Chapter 2<br>
<br>
&quot;Assault of the Undead, Past Revealed&quot;<br>
<br>
<br>
This place was nothing short of a pure nightmare for Kei's unit. Kithicor had to be one of the most disturbing places in the world, second only to that of Faydwer. The tree themselves appeared to be the only thing that had a shred of life in it. Now she truly had found a place she was weary of enter. If anything she felt that the massive gates that sealed up the paths and passages into the great forest just simply weren't enough.<br>
<br>
What Kei knew from simple memory was that just after the being known as the Dread King managed to conquer Faydwer, that Kithicor itself had been sealed. This wasn't an easy task by far and the fact that only the most supreme of priests where capable of creating the gates that now stood behind her was simply mind boggling. These gates, termed &quot;Ward Gates&quot;, where in fact stone enchanted to keep the Undead that permeated the forest from spreading out into the world.<br>
<br>
Only those who had an extreme curiosity of the dead, or where in fact insane would dare enter this forest now. Those few scientists who now traveled into the forest where often guarded by at least four units, and even then causalities where high. The ones that made it out where often to traumatized to go back to normal life, or held such great contempt for this place that they came back to avenge their fallen friends.<br>
<br>
Over the course of the years, even the scientists had given up on searching this place but once a year. In that amount of time they had discovered several new types of undead creatures, but the information was classified. Few people even heard of the creatures, and more often then not unit's such as Kei's where only given basic information on which to be careful of. <br>
<br>
This all didn't deter her from the mission at hand though, it just meant that her unit was going to receive a higher rating, and thus more pay. In the back of her mind though something was telling her that this incursion into the forest was going to prove more dangerous than normal. Surely she knew by now that her prey had came here for some reason. It was this fact that kept her constantly checking over her shoulder for the slightest indication of an attack.<br>
<br>
When they had entered the forest they had taken the time to put on all the equipment they had been given. This was a very secluded and private place after all, which mean they could practically set off all their grenades in one go and not have to worry about drawing attention. The other thing that was interesting was these new rifles had been given a special setting for undead. Though the researchers had told them it never was fully tested on anything remotely powerful, it had been effective enough to stop the average undead cyclops in one shot.<br>
<br>
Kei was very surprised though at how light the armor she had been given was. It was far lighter than what she could have expected. What she had been told the new armor was a new adamantite-tynnonium alloy which proved to be quite durable not only under physical conditions, but against the very rifles they where using. Though she personally preferred the special metallic thread woven armor over actual solid plate armor, this was still far better than what the normal units got.<br>
<br>
<br>
The old man certainly knew what he was doing leading the unit into Kithicor. Many a time he had traveled through this forest, with Hibiki in tow of course. This was all in Hibiki's younger years, so naturally the place did give him a familiar feeling, but also at the same time left him slightly confused. Cain knew for a fact that the unit would have more than their fair share of trouble here, which only served to make things better for him and Hibiki's escape.<br>
<br>
&quot;Well boy we could be in here for several days more you know.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Why does that not surprise me, last night was already as creepy as I want it to get.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Aw can't tell me that the big ol' rottin giant gave you the willies?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Well it didn't almost sit on you now did it?&quot;, Hibiki shivered as he remembered the incident.<br>
<br>
&quot;You do have a point on that. Which leads me to wonder just what else could be lurking here in the shadows.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;I'd rather not find out, in fact I'd rather go to High Pass Hold.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Well we have to wait until things calm down first, can't exactly have your love kitten capturing us now can we?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Well at least I can find a real lady unlike a certain old man I know.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Now that was below the belt&quot;, Cain muttered, he hated that incident more than anything else.<br>
<br>
&quot;Well from what I seen it was below the belt when I walked in on you two!&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Go on an rub it in ya little pain in the arse, at least that thing didn't see us as one big bounty.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;That reminds me, what all do you know about her, since she's after us I might as well know what we're up against right?&quot;, Hibiki couldn't help but be curious as to just how come she was so strong.<br>
<br>
&quot;Fine, your girlfriend there is at least one fourth to one eighth kerran. Not sure what else but I suspect she might even have barbarian blood in her. Hence the reason she is so quick and was able pound you into the dirt. Another thing is she has some elven blood in her as well, probably wood elf I imagine.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Wonderful, so how about letting me in on some of my family history now?&quot;<br>
<br>
Cain had always known this day was going to come, he dreaded it more than anything else too. He decided though that it was best to tell him now as they came to an abandoned cabin along the path. Once inside things would probably be more confusing for him to explain, as he wasn't sure what Hibiki really wanted to know.<br>
<br>
&quot;For starters you parents names are Magus and Kayla. The reason those bastards want you so badly is because of how strong your parents are. Your a very rare individual, your half human, but it is the other two parts to the other half that automatically got attentions stirred up.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;And this other half would be?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Now that's the trick, your one forth celestial, and one forth demon. Then again that is just an added bonus since your father wasn't an average human.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;I go from one nightmare to another...&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;The best way to describe your father is the simple term 'Spirit Master', only our bloodline carries this power. I'm not even sure what kind of power it is, but its most certainly not mana.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;As if things couldn't get any worse..&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;That and the fact you can use nearly all the innate abilities of Celestials or Demons makes you very valuable. In any case take the time now to read this book, I'm sure you can understand more about the subject that I could.&quot;, with all this said Cain pulled an old tattered book from his satchel and tossed it to Hibiki.<br>
<br>
Cain knew the contents of the book well, he had read them many times but even he couldn't understand what was being described. It had been his own son's, grandson's, and great grandson's who had written the book, thus it was near impossible for him to understand just what they meant. If he could have, he would have used the techniques held within the book to destroy the people who where hunting them down like animals.<br>
<br>
Things are not always as they appeared to be, or so Hibiki had been told many times. This was such a case as he began reading the book Cain had given him. It was more or less a rough journal of technique's and their effects. What stood out the most where the extra sentences in the margins that had an ethereal glow to them. The detailed descriptions of how to harness the forces to perform all of these things where astounding.<br>
<br>
&quot;The key to our power is our spirit, our will to survive. We do not know why ours is different than others, we only know what can trigger the awakening&quot;, these words where hard for Hibiki to speak out loud, but truth was in them.<br>
<br>
&quot;As I suspected, they only meant for people who had the potential to be able to read it.&quot;, all Cain could do was laugh, it was something he would have done himself.<br>
<br>
&quot;To trigger an awakening intense emotion and a genuine need for power have to be present. Beware of this though, for it can cause more harm than good if caution isn't exercised.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Definite words of wisdom, at least now you know how to fight back.&quot;<br>
<br>
<br>
The great forest around Kei was giving her the creeps now, she couldn't shake the feeling of impending doom. She could sense something out there watching them, but wasn't sure of what it was. Naturally if she told her unit they would get rattled as well, which would cause mass confusion if something did attack them. Now she knew why most sane people feared this place more than anything else.<br>
<br>
&quot;Commander, I keep getting blimps on the reader here, first something's there then its gone.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;It must be the surroundings, just stay calm and keep your guard up.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;I'm getting the same thing over here, maybe the researchers screwed up?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;It doesn't matter if they did or not, we're the best and nothing here is going to get the better of us.&quot;<br>
<br>
The attack was on without so much as a warning, no sound was heard until one of the men began screaming. It was already to late for the soldier though, even though he was alive the hopes of him surviving where slim as half of his intestines lay on the ground at his feet. A second later and another man fell to the ground, half of his head having been torn away leaving his dead body twitching on the ground.<br>
<br>
There was a hail of rifle fire as the four surviving members of the unit fired into the darkness. Things where slowly becoming worse though, whatever it was could move quick. It was stealthy enough to evade even Kei's heightened senses. Another man was heard screaming which turned to a gurgling sound, the creature that now stood before them had ripped out his throat. It had a wide smile on it's half decayed face as blood dripped from its chin.<br>
<br>
Instantly Kei knew what this creature was, it was one of the few that the government feared the most. It was completely uncontrollable, this having been discovered after several research teams captured one and having been decimated once it got loose again. This was what they had termed the Flesh Reaper. In the reports it was stated that it used the life force from the flesh it ate to regenerate it's own body to a state just after death. Once this was demonstrated, it was instantly put on the black list on creatures to be exterminated, having found it to be far to intelligent in its regenerated state to control.<br>
<br>
This all disgusted Kei as she took aim at the Flesh Reaper before her and began firing. She now knew this place was damned, and if she ever survived she was certainly not coming back. The beasts movements where not like the other undead she had encountered, it could move as graceful as some of the best acrobats she had seen as a child. It's hands where more like claws though, or perhaps even blades, as yet another one of her subordinates fell to the creatures savage lust for living flesh.<br>
<br>
Everything was going to hell around Kei and her last remaining comrade. The half eaten corpses of their fallen friends had already started to come back to life. This forest was most certainly cursed, even more so since Innoruuk's influence no longer controlled the creatures within it. All that these things wanted or cared about was causing more death, and partaking of the flesh of the living.<br>
<br>
All Kei could do was back away and continue to fire her pulse rifle at the Flesh Reaper and its freshly reanimated victims. The last remaining man of her unit fell as its once living compatriots took to devouring his flesh before he had even died. She was now all alone with no one to help her, still she just had to survive no matter the cost. A blood curdling scream echoed through the forest as fear had finally taken over her mind.<br>
<br>
<br>
Hibiki knew something was wrong, he could feel gnawing at the back of his mind. Something had found them and it felt as though it was watching him. This feeling rang true as something came crashing through the roof of the cabin and now stood before him and Cain. It stank of rotting flesh, and wore long forgotten garments from the past.<br>
<br>
The old man knew just what this creature was, it was something he had seen in the past. It was what the researched had dubbed a Flesh Reaper. Amongst the creatures in this forest it remained to be one that proved to be nearly unstoppable, mostly because of its intelligence and quick regenerative abilities.<br>
<br>
Cain hardly had time to move before the Flesh Reaper was on the move, as his luck would have it he was the closest to it. It as a good thing he was fast for an old man, otherwise the claws from the creature would have surely driven though his chest. Instead he found the creature had managed to leave its mark in the form of several claw marks that cleaved his flesh right down to the bone.<br>
<br>
Without hesitation Hibiki grabbed a decrepit old chair and promptly mashed it over the creature's back. In return for doing such he was batted aside as if he here nothing more than a rag doll. It was apparent this creature was going after what it thought the largest threat was, namely Cain. Needless to say the old man didn't intend on becoming this things next meal, for some reason he had a smile on his face, as if he knew something neither Hibiki nor the Flesh Reaper did.<br>
<br>
&quot;Look out below!!!&quot;<br>
<br>
Zebuxoruk had naturally came looking for them after having found out they escaped into Kithicor. The Flesh Reaper never had a chance as the ungod's sword split it's stinking body in two. Cain had to give him credit, even if he was late he had always managed to pull him out of sticky situations. This time though he had cut it almost to close for comfort for the old mans sake.<br>
<br>
&quot;What kept you waiting?! You have the worst timing possible!&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Sorry, I got hung up dealing with a couple things. By the way, your little search party ran into this little critters friend not to far from here.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Well guess that means Hibiki's girlfriend is probably in more trouble than she can handle.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;She's not my girlfriend!&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Last I seen was that all of her unit was dead, an she was barely holding them off.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;I just wanna know why that thing came for me first...&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;If you had paid any attention to some of the materials I sent you lately you'd realize these things are mana sensitive.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;So that's why it was drawn to the old man like that one hooker was.&quot;, Hibiki just loved rubbing that in, it was one of the few things he could say to get even with Cain.<br>
<br>
&quot;Okay, but shouldn't you go save your girlfriend now?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Girlfriend or not, you really should go see if she's dead Hibiki. I'll have my hands full guiding this dead weight here to safety.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Just because I'm old don't go calling me dead weight!&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Just why do I have to go check everything out?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Because your a fast runner.&quot;, both Cain and Zebuxoruk said this in unison, after all they had both seen him run before.<br>
<br>
Hibiki just mumbled as he left the cabin and starting walking back along the path. If anything what those two had said was right, given the right motivation he could out run them both. After all being a coward did grant that kind of advantage, and at least he did live longer than most others. He knew that fighting anything in this forest usually meant a slow and painful death.<br>
<br>
It was simple to find Kei, all he had to do was following the screaming. This made the task even less desirable for Hibiki to fulfill. He really wished he had paid more attention to the lessons that his grandpa had tried to teach him, particularly ones that involved combat. If anything he understood some of the simpler methods he had read in the book earlier, but he knew he didn't have that kind of power yet.<br>
<br>
All Hibiki could do was look over the top of a fallen tree and watch Kei doing her best to avoid the Flesh Reaper. The weapon she was using sure packed enough of a punch to disable her friends turned enemies, but it was having little effect on the creature when it did manage to hit. He knew all to well why the old man and Zebuxoruk had sent him here, it wasn't just because he could run faster than either of them, it was the fact he could see perfectly in the darkness.<br>
<br>
Kei was sure this was the end as she fired the final shot left in her rifle. After hearing the trigger click a few times she was certain she was all out. What made the situation worse was that without the weapon she had no way of keeping her distance from the Flesh Reaper. She did her best to avoid the oncoming attack from the beast by throwing her now useless rifle at it. This had little effect as the undead fiend drove it's claws deep into her shoulder, pinning her against the tree she was standing in front of.<br>
<br>
She was all out of options now as she closed her eyes and waited for her death to come. It was then that she heard someone scream, then seconds later the Flesh Reaper's claws where dislodged from her shoulder. When she opened her eyes she was slightly more than surprised at who had just freed her.<br>
<br>
&quot;Where the hell did you come from?&quot;, Kei couldn't help but glare at Hibiki, after all he was the reason she was here.<br>
<br>
&quot;Just shut up and find some place to hide!&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;How dare you try to order me around! I'll have your hide for this!&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Move it already before it de...&quot;, Hibiki's words where cut short as the Flesh Reaper came in to attack.<br>
<br>
In his rush to shove Kei away from the beast he neglected to think of his own safety. He had turned his back which was a mistake that gained him a fresh set of claw marks across his back. Right now he wanted to run away, but he couldn't exactly leave Kei here either. Unlike what he thought she was, he couldn't let someone die by doing nothing. Now he was backed into a corner and had no idea what to do, he did have the strength he needed to defeat this creature before him.<br>
<br>
&quot;Some hero you are, I think I might be better off on my own then having some coward protect me.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Would you shut up!&quot;<br>
<br>
Hibiki was now confused, and Kei's insults where only beginning to do something that no one else had managed to do. He was getting angry, more so than he had ever been from someone griping at him. He was tired of it all now, he didn't want to run anymore. All he ever wanted was to have a normal life, but the government simply wasn't going to allow it. Now he was about to find out just why he hadn't been left alone.<br>
<br>
&quot;I'm tired of it all! Everyone has always did this to me!&quot;<br>
<br>
Hibiki stomped his foot on the ground in a rage as streams of blackened energy began to flow into his body. Neither the Flesh Reaper, nor Kei knew what to make of all this. All the Flesh Reaper could do was start circling Hibiki as it prepared to launch another attack. Kei was simply in shock over what was happening in front of her.<br>
<br>
It didn't take long for Kei's MTA reader to react to the spectacle before her. She couldn't understand the reading though, it had to be malfunctioning. She simply couldn't believe that Hibiki's MTA readings where still at zero. Nothing could have prepared her for what she was about to witness. <br>
<br>
&quot;Ragnarok!!!&quot;<br>
<br>
Kei barely had enough time to react as dove into the cave behind her and lodged herself behind a rock. A rush of hot wind encompassed her as she watched a a brilliant crimson light engulf the area outside the cave, then she heard the faint screams of the undead. She certainly wasn't sure of what had happened, that is until she seen Hibiki stumbling into the cave.<br>
<br>
&quot;Where are you... I'm going to tear out your tongue...&quot;<br>
<br>
It was clear to her that something drastic had taken place outside, especially from the condition Hibiki's cloths where in. They had been charred and where in shambles, not only that but they where smoldering. All Kei could do was stay hidden from his view until she heard him fall to the ground. Whatever had happened, she certainly couldn't view him as some simpleton now, in fact he was probably more dangerous than the Flesh Reaper now...<br>
