She slowly sits up, and her violet eyes begin to adjust to her surroundings.  She is in what appears to be a room, with no doors, no windows.<br>
How did I get here? she wonders, And where IS here?<br>
&quot;Hello? Anyone here?&quot; the melodious voice echoes against the walls.  Walking around the room, she feels the walls, looking for any signs of an exit.<br>
Lenore's thoughts raced as to how she might have gotten here, as she searched the walls carefully for an exit.  Last thing she remembered was falling asleep by a cozy fire, her husband beside her, and the next thing she knew, she was here.  She calls out again, just as her hand goes through the wall.<br>
&quot;Hello? Is anyone here?&quot;<br>
&quot;M-mm-other?&quot; Lenore's heart jumped.<br>
&quot;Jolene?&quot; she entered through the wall and into another room like the one she just left.  In this room was her daughter.<br>
The two women embraced, unmindful of the tears falling from the other's eyes.<br>
&quot;Where are we, mother?&quot;  Jolene asked quietly.  Lenore looked into her daughter's dove gray eyes.<br>
&quot;I do not know.  All I know is your father will be worried sick about me when he finds me gone.&quot;<br>
Gug too, Jolene thought sadly.  Her last moment was just before she fell asleep in a rather chilly room behind one of the pubs in Thurgadin, and Gug snoring loudly beside her, and she woke up here.<br>
&quot;Let me try to get us out.&quot; Lenore said hopefully.  Lenore chanted, and.......<br>
Nothing.<br>
Not even a failed incantation.  It was almost like her powers had left.<br>
&quot;Oh, this can't be good,&quot; Lenore mumbled.<br>
Lenore began to walk around the room, looking for an exit again.  Just as Lenore touched one wall, a figure stumbled through it.<br>
&quot;Elishia?&quot; Lenore said.  The Erudite regained her balance and blinked.  She was not expecting to find another person in here, let alone her sister-in-law and niece.<br>
The trio sat in the room trying to figure out how they got here and how to get out.  Just then, a body fell thorugh the ceiling, and landed in a heap, and promptly cursed in Erudian.<br>
&quot;Zianya?&quot;  Elishia asked.  The woman looked up and gasped.<br>
&quot;Eli!&quot;  and the sisters embraced.<br>
 <br>
The four women sat for what seemed forever, talking.  Each knew their mates would be worried sick about them, and no way to escape this limbo forced upon them.  Fortunately, Lenore had the hindsight to pack plenty of food and drink, as it was obvious they would be here for awhile. <br>
&quot;Well, shall we try to look for an exit?  Surely there has to be one somewhere, since we were able to find each other.&quot; Lenore said.  The others agreed. <br>
They felt around the walls and the floor, since Zianya came through one, and Jolene found the wall that led them into an extremly large room.  Echoes of voices could be heard and Lenore wondered who else was possibly trapped in this white limbo.<br>

Well, as this implies, I am one of the many who hasn't been able to log on since the first patch as of Dec 4th.  If anyone is in this same predictiment, post here as well.  May as well make the most of a bad situation. <p>Lenore Bravehard

The other three women rushed to where Elishia stood.  Sure enough, a thin wall seperated them from the outside.  Vague outlines of the trees and lush green hills could be seen.  Elishia pressed her hand through the wall, and proceeded to walk through it.  The others followed suit.<br>
As they stood on the grassy plains, breathing in the fresh air, the air shifted, and a huge gust blew by them, causing them to shield their eyes.<br>
When the winds died down, the women opened their eyes, and sighed sadly.<br>
<br>
They were back inside the white prison again. <p>Lenore Bravehard
