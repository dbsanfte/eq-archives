 Its basically centered on a somewhat normal earth type time,<br>
the Vacitican released documents about demons existing. in reality there are 5 or so breeds<br>
<br>
the Imps: little more than very evil human's living or souls. some look somewhat demonic the weakest of all good at suggestion and basic pilfering and normal chaos.<br>
<br>
<br>
The  Fiends: the second class of demon, normally reptilian in appearance they are asscoisated with negative emotions, hate,lust,greed,gluttony, anger,fear,rage so on. jealousy they protect or act on the emotions of there closest human , thus inacting revenge or something on the person that caused the emotions, normally there  very unclivlized  not even other demons would be near a fiend cus it would most likely tear it apart if it could, there rather strong being  focused emotion.<br>
<br>
<br>
The Infester: Or Devourers ones who plauge humanity the most, wacthed exorcest? like that they poesse the human or machine or other demons corrupting them into there own image, infestants by them selves are merely disembodied demons or tainted human souls.  their strength is not set some are stronger or weaker. harder to kill if there human because most demon hunter weapons only harm demons.<br>
<br>
Fallen Angel: The Fallen angel class the strongest  normal class, they have the honor that other classes lack,<br>
Knights of darkness, a dim divine spark resides in each the possiblibty of light rests in each, some can be very cruel others nearly good. the engimatic warroirs of hell and the abyss<br>
<br>
the fifth class: The Ruling class, the strongest of all nartually, various demonic rulers have been named<br>
Beelzebub,<br>
Mesphisto<br>
Tiamat<br>
even Loki<br>
 some are very much goatlike others are wraithlike.<br>
<br>
The Current Demon king is known as<br>
Reficul The Damned<br>
<br>

Standing on the top of the tower, half crouched and sort of leaning, Vermifax, looked over the people. Chuckling to himself as the brainless creatures wandered around haplessly, these stupid people. Pondering bout all the wonderfully mischievious things he could do. Looking again he felt a strange surgence of something coming from the horizen. Snorting at the impedement of his fun he looked down on the people again. &quot;One small rain won't hurt no body. Opening his hands he searched for the one thought that he was looking for. There in the mind a banker. He had remembered the last week's rain and that was all the help Vermi needed. The water poured down on the pour soul as the small imp flew over the buildings cackling loudly.<br>

White. Grey orbs scanned over the selection in her closet. Black. White. <br>
<br>
White. She pulled a white wife beater from a hanger and slipped it on over her black satan bra. White. Small leather shorts fit her wasit perfectly. Zipper. Button. Dressed. Pitter-pat. Rain? Slowly, her head turned to the side letting raven strands cascade from her shoulder. Rain. Her boots were heavy against the wooden floor and hit with a bom every step. Rain. As she stood silently in front of the window, gazing blankly outside, she pulled a hair band that had been around her wrist and tied her hair up with it. Fine cut edges swished at her mid back in a perfect line. Pink and dull off colored flesh broke the perfection. On either side of her back two lines stood out. A reminder of what she had been, what she was, and what she will now always be. <br>
<br>
It was morning. Morning meant work. A slender hand reached out to the nightstand next to her by the window. Grasped firmly was a belt with two dagger holders and in those holders were two bone daggers jagged and curved in just the right places. It buckled just around her waist, a custom fit. Work.<br>
<br>
Just as she headed for the door, a glare from the sun caught her look. It was just the mirror. For no reason at all she studied her face in it for a moment. Not a single hair was out of place, and her slim, defined, feminine features were nearly perfect. She did not smile at this. Her tiny candy pink lips stood like rock on her face. There was work to be done. No time for such nonsense. In her mind she half scolded herself for wasting her time on frivolous things like mirrors. She'd have to remind herself to get rid of that when she got home. That was the last and final thought she had before steping silently down the stair way and onto the soggy street below. <br>

Sitting in his favorite coffee house, Vermi looked out into the streets at all the passing people. What a dull day. No one had any thoughts of mischivious behaviour, no one wanted to have any fun! Smiling as he caught hold of his own reflection in the windows, he almost didn't recognize the tall slinder man with the long blond hair pulled back as always, the purple eyes, not many noticed flashed back at him. He was handsome! Looking around again he saw somone walking past the window that he hadn't expected. Someone with a force. Someone with some mischivious thoughts. Someone with some horrible thoughts. Smiling, Vermi remembered just how hungry he was. Watching for the person to come into plain view, Vermi moved back and forth in his chair trying for a view. There. the sun hit her as she came into view. She was... perfect... Suddenly, his hunger hit again. Such strong emotions. He licked his lips and heard a scream. Turning waiting for trouble, he noticed as he turned a spiked tail flash just out of sight... spiked tail? He had a.... @#%$! The human form had died. ummm... he thought... run?<br>
<br>
Bolting out of the cafe he nearly ran into the stranger he had seen on the streets. She did not seem frightened, she did not seem to feel anything as he ran straight into her. instead of knocking her down, he was the one on his back. He thought he saw a thin, warm, smile before a board of wood landed him across the face and the world turned upside down as he flew back into darkness.<br>
<br>
(ooc- haha have fun with that bell... maybe you'll get me out of the slammer? if not...

They didn't even have enough intellegence to eat... disappointed slightly at the lack of creativity in these cells, the smile slowly faded. That one girl he had met would be an intresting person. Another shy smile came across his face. He would love just to talk to her... maybe just stare... maybe sample some of her mind... No... he wouldn't... Looking at the people walking past him, &quot;That's it.. right in there.&quot; Smiling again with his fangs this time showing, Vermi laughed as the small brains fled in terror. Too easy, he thought. Pulling up the shroud of humanity, Vermi nearly laughed as the guards walked by again. Wondering exactly what was going in the city he loved so much... The city, never the people. Well with some exceptions but those are long gone. How he wished he were less shy and could walk the city as he was. It was not his fault for who he was born. Snorting to himself. humans.<br>

a Fiend, Damn! Probably a violence one too....<br>

Never a frikkin dull moment.<br>
 he slipped on his clothes , the same old trenchcoat, and syth skin shirt, Syth skin, sythenic skin really, its more commonly known as Stone Skin acutally, alwas black and skin tight, it cant be torn or damaged easily and of course if very expensive, and it even repels animal fur!. slipping on some baggy  pants  he picked up his Katana, Slayer, aweapon that could only harm Demons...and some vampire, Was that imp Vermi?....Note to self check out the prison...<br>
 he exited his apartment  hiding the katana within his trenchcoat, the only other things on his person where his wallet and a few jars clipped to the side of his belt.<br>
 he flicked his cellphone out placing it to his ear&quot;Hello?&quot; wondering if she was still around..<br>

Foolish reporters. Sooner or later a few of his friends would show up and get him out of this cage. He didn't mean to hurt anyone, but they were keeping him against his will. Sighing again at the strange looks, he gave a snarl and cackled at the stratled press. His thoughts again turned to that girl... He would have to retreat to his perch to think on that... <br>
<br>
Looking back to the walls, Vermi snarled. The familiar sent of a hunter. Looking out the bars with intense fear, panic, Vermi searched the minds of those around him. One!! One that wanted to let him go! Just a little... too late!!! Looking at the walls again. The imp sat down and waited patiantly, the hunter would do their job efficently... At last this long life, this immportality... this curse... would be over, thought vermi... over.<br>

 walking into the prison..la la la...Being a liscseneded demon hunter is pretty cool, immunity from all police, as long as it can be traced to the super nartual atleast, finally the vactican is good for something!.<br>

&quot;Vermifax....What in the hells are you doing here!?&quot; Zreuel asked..his eyes narrowing<br>

..his favorite Imp, a thousand years of pure mischief..he was acutally one of the stronger kind..he really wasnt in the mood to kill him&quot;..You were killed by something with a spiked tail... Right ?You spill, I get you out of here&quot; they had probably never met before now..

Looking at the hunter with hatred.. &quot;Listen you old graveyard attendent... let's just get this over with.&quot; With that Vermifax stood up, his claws extended his tail ready. Wishing he had been more careful, Vermifax was prepared to die, although he was still unsure as to this hunter's attitude. It must be a ploy to get his guard down. Vermifax would not be so easy. He had been known for his resiliance to hunters in the past, but he wasn't ready for this... he had never been stuck in a cage waiting to die... Snarling his best trying to cover up his fear, Vermifax reared his tail back...<br>
