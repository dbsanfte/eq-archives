Pretty much, Mother Earth would last alot longer if people used birth control.  I mean everywhere you go now days you see babies all over the place..<br>

Keep it in your pants or wear a condom.<br>

<br>
It's been a long time since I was a space-nut, but as I recall, methane is a major gas composing the gas giants.  Thus, it's possible that soups that look similar in nature to Earth's petroleum could exist up there.  This could provide a supply of organic compounds useful for manufacturing, although the cost would be prohibitive as a fuel source.<br>
<br>
However, getting sizeable amounts of anything out of a gravity well is a non-trivial problem, shall we say.<br>
<br>
Aldrin -- you belittle my attitude that GWB is wrong in his energy policy.  His entire policy is based on &quot;drill more wells&quot;.<br>
<br>
Not once have I said anything about leaving the oil in the ground (other than how hard it is to get the second half out of the ground).<br>
<br>
My point is that the policy should be finding ways to not use that oil.<br>
<br>
Furthermore, if we drill Alaska NOW, then what kind of position are we going to be in when it's drilled out, and the rest of the U.S. reserves are drilled out?  That IS going to happen.  There's only so much oil, and the experts all pretty much agree how much of it the U.S. controls.  Do you really want the U.S. to be in the position where we have NO oil reserves left?  What can the oil cartel do then, when we have no other choice but to buy from them.<br>
<br>
Oh, I suppose we could nuke everyone then go steal the oil.  Good solution.<br>
<br>
Comparing GWB to S.H. is ridiculous by the way and has absolutely nothing to do with energy policy.<br>
<br>
GWB has filled his administration with people from the oil industry, people who care about oil industry profits.  He wants to:<br>
<br>
1. Dig it all up NOW, make money NOW, and let the future sort itself out.<br>
<br>
2. Environment?  Who cares, let's drill more wells.<br>
<br>
3. Civil rights?  What are those?<br>
<br>
4. Local laws?  We can stomp on them too (he told the Salvation Army he'd support them if they wanted to violate local laws regarding discrimination).<br>
<br>
5. MicroSoft ISN'T a monopoly after all, even though everyone in the industry knows they are, the justice department knows they are, and the courts declared them a monopoly.  (And don't argue that the courts backed off on that position -- they did so AFTER GWB came into power, and you can bet the justice department took a fall.)  Take a look at the new licensing rules in XP to see the result.  If you add new hardware to your computer, you may need to buy a new (identical) copy of software -- not because the existing copy isn't any good, but just because MicroSoft wants more money.<br>
<br>
Aldrin, I don't know where you get your information on energy policy, but you need to do some research.  Read a few books.  I'd suggest &quot;Hubbert's Peak, The Impending World Oil Shortage&quot; by Kenneth S. Deffeyes.  It's only about $10 from Amazon.  It's written by a professor at Princeton who is a former executive at Shell and is considered an industry expert.  Furthermore, from what I can tell, no one is disagreeing with his basic outcome -- they may just disagree with the exact date he predicts.<br>
<br>
I'd also suggest you take a look at hydrogen fuel cells.  These aren't an energy source, they're more of an energy battery.  Electric cars aren't going to cut it, and I don't believe electric airplanes are an option.  However, hydrogen fuel cells could easily power our transportation system.  This would eliminate megatons of pollutants plus give us choices how we produce the energy we use.<br>
<br>
Very little oil is burned to produce electricity (about 4% or so of electricity is from oil).  Most is from coal, of which we have a LOT.  It'll go away eventually, too, but we have a lot more time to figure out what to do about it.<br>
<br>
A hydrogen fuel cell economy would also be great in another way.  We can produce the hydrogen using &quot;excess&quot; energy.  Like at 3 AM.  Or when it's extra windy.  We can build windmill farms and not care if the wind isn't steady -- we just produce more hydrogen on windy days.<br>
<br>
THIS is what GWB's energy policy should be doing -- promoting an alternative -- and fuel cells look like an awesome alternative.<br>
<br>
Drill more wells isn't fixing the problem -- it's actually speeding up the inevitable.  Furthermore, while it could temporarily reduce our dependence on OPEC, all the oil in Alaska that they're talking about would only last us 6-12 months.<br>
<br>
So yes, we'll be drilling that oil eventually, but we shouldn't be doing it NOW, we should do it LATER.<br>
<br>
NOW is when we should be finding ways to completely eliminate our dependence on oil as a fuel source.  We can do that, but drilling more wells isn't the answer.<br>
