Well, some thought that it went poorly (wuffy, but he is always pessimistic) and some died a lot (Swyrlie) but we all die a little every day. <br>
<br>
Camping the bar was a mess, it's not our fault. Verant should really think about making use whats already present and fix some stuff thats been problematic since launch. Like Unrest. If those rude people in the basement weren't there when we got there, things would have been a greater success. We did eventually get to camp the ghost though, and got a few jagged bands. No boots though.<br>
<br>
In response to Wuffy's comment that it wasnt organized enough... well what would you suggest to have made it better? Getting knowledge from spoiler sites is fine to a degree but it's also pretty lame if you ask me. Fantasy games need some excitement of discovery, no? And some actual adventuring, which is what we did. When me and Bartel scouted it we did the best we could do alone in there. There is no way of finding out exactly how bad we could pick up trains til we actually tried it. Live and learn, die and burn, whatever. Nothing is impossible, some things can be more challenging, hence, more rewarding. <br>
<br>
My beefs? Same die hard crowd, mostly. None of the newer members came, especially the lower level ones who this was sort of intended for. Your loss. Now that I think about it, ALL those who were present except for good Inien and Sandayan were original House Members. Hmm... Food for thought. I'll stop this rant here before it gets ugly.<br>
<br>
To the family that came: you did a wonderfully and I had a great time. Sorry if I sounded bossy a couple times, It was chaotic on occasion and I hate to see you folks lying blue and dead *smiles warmly* you know how fond I am of you nuts.<br>
<br>
Treasure: 3 Jagged Bands (one given to Zaboxx), 2 Festering Cloaks (necro only), a Bloodstained Mantle. Approx 360+ platinum.<br>

<br>
We started in the side yard, but the mobs were light blue cons...   so, I started to pull from inside out to the porch for them...   worked well, but too slow...<br>
<br>
So we moved inside to the back room with 3 pops and fairly safe from trains...  but the 3 pops were still light blue cons for White and San...  So, I began to pull from the second floor...<br>
<br>
I was doing ok there...  I would only get 2 - 3 mobs at a time that conned blue or less for me and even to red for White and San...  they would take one and I would take the others that came...<br>
<br>
worked ok until I pulled the hag...  stupid hag was casting faster than I could swing a sword...   I got it down to half life before I died and then the other group had to assist White and San to finish it off...<br>
<br>
After that point, we got in a few more &quot;safe kills,&quot; but got more trains and other problems...  I think I was spending time paying attention to what was going on in guild channel and not enough to what I was doing and lost control a couple times...<br>
<br>
As for planning, we did well...   exploration is a good part of a raid...   we did have some problems that interfered with accurate actions when needed, but those were not under our control...<br>
<br>
Right after you guys hit a bad spot, I went up to survey the results and found 3 corpses and Wuffy in the room...  while chatting with Bel, 3 mobs popped and all jumped me instead of Bel...   they all conned blue, so I took em down for White and San...   again, worked ok for a sec, but I was getting hit by all 3 and got stunned too much to be effective...  I called Bel for assistance, but he didn't know the way to me (not his fault by any means) while he was finding us, I got 1 mob dead and another down to half, but the remaining 1 and a half were still red cons for White and San...   too much....   this was right after a bad spot for other group, so Bel was only one too assist...   White and San both had good sense to know when to run and I kept em sowed so they made it out every time we ran in to trouble (I think, no deaths for White or San, right?)<br>
<br>
So, overall, lowbie group did well.  I am not at all worried about the deaths that occured for me...  I did my part and got the lowbies some exp, I only lost a total of 3 blue bubs which I can make back fairly easily...<br>
<br>
I picked up no loot during the raid, but both White and San got some good exp (which was the goal of the lowbie group... <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  )... <p><p><font size="5" color="#006600">Kelwin Jumala</font><br>

Blackpoint looks up from the table, she had her favorite in front of her..dwarven meat stew...and the aroma permeated the air.  Whitepoint took a couple steps into the house before Blackpoint said anything.<br>
<br>
Blackpoint: &quot;So, how was it?&quot;<br>
<br>
Whitepoint: &quot;It went okay, allthough I think some of the other members didn't have as much fun as planned.&quot;<br>
<br>
Blackpoint: &quot;Why, did people die?&quot;<br>
<br>
Whitepoint: &quot;Yeah... Kelwin, Belwolf, Swyrl, I dont know who else.&quot;<br>
<br>
Blackpoint: &quot;I see you made it.  Allthough you dont look like a priestess at the moment.&quot;<br>
<br>
Whitepoint: &quot;I need a bath.  I think I have Zomebie Brain in my hair.&quot;<br>
<br>
Blackpoint: &quot;No, thats a finger, the brains on your left shoe.&quot;<br>
<br>
Whitepoint looks down, and flicks the brain onto the floor.<br>
<br>
Blackpoint: &quot;Well, look at it this way.  You got a little stronger, and you got to party with the guild.&quot;<br>
<br>
Whitepoint: &quot;Yeah, they were.&quot;<br>
<br>
Blackpoint: &quot;I see Tinithiel dropped off my present to you.&quot;<br>
<br>
Whitepoint: &quot;Yes, it is rather nice.  I like it.  Thank you.&quot;<br>
<br>
Blackpoint: &quot;So, what are you now.. 19.&quot;<br>
<br>
Whitepoint: &quot;Yep.&quot;<br>
<br>
Blackpoint: &quot;Neat, I'm almost 34.  You should come up to Velious sometime... When you get some real spells and such.&quot;<br>
<br>
Whitepoint snaps a look at Blackpoint.<br>
<br>
Whitepoint: &quot;What do you mean.. real spells?&quot;<br>
<br>
Blackpoint: &quot;Do you think that root and nuke thing you do works on everything.&quot;<br>
<br>
Whitepoint: &quot;Yeah.&quot;<br>
<br>
Blackpoint: &quot;Oh.. well... how about this then.&quot;<br>
<br>
Whitepoint is snared.<br>
<br>
Whitepoint: &quot;What the heck?&quot;<br>
<br>
Blackpoint turns around and Cendarien walks out of the shadows.. laughing.<br>
<br>
Whitepoint: &quot;Oh, thats funny.  You think its funny that I walk <br>
around in slow motion.  And second, you weren't in my bedroom were you.  Oh, thats so gross.&quot;<br>

<br>
glad our lower lvl members that where there got some exp although wish more had shownup. swyrl got his carrion even though he did a few times.<br>
<br>
they do need to fix unrest because mobs attacked through the walls or something because i couldn't see them to taunt them. next time will bring Painbringer for the AoE so i can taunt all the mobs on me, it's gotta be good for something lol.<br>
