If someone is in line for 3 hours waiting for movie tickets, do you jump ahead of them?  No.  Lots of people put in multple days of camping RF only to get their hopes crushed when a bigger force comes in and kills it without a second thought to them.  If you can't see that as wrong, then you have no ethics.<br>

We did not 'wipe them out to ensure they don't get it.'  I don't know why Hitss attacked the human (probably because he's insane), but I do know that Finite polished him off and got turned into dragon crunchies.  If you spawn the dragon before you're ready, it's your own fault when it eats you.  <br>
<br>
#2- How does 'they didn't have enough' count as an excuse, exactly?  They didn't have enough people to kill the dragon.  Period end.  From the number of their corpses in the area at the time I'm lead to believe that they were bound pretty damn close.  In the 45-60 minutes it took us to recover and prepare not one extra person showed up for the Finite team.  During that same time, I was woken up, got out of bed, booted up my computer, logged on, found a tl from Great Divide to Dreadlands, and ran to Skyfire.  I arrived after most but not all of the force had assembled, about 40 minutes after Meadbh found out about the spawn.  As I said, in that time not one other person showed up for Finite.  Was all of their help stuck in NToV without druids or wizards or something? Was everyone who was coming to assist them so far from a port point or a wizard that it would take them over an hour to reach Skyfire? Or did they maybe not have anyone else coming to help them, and hence not enough force to kill the dragon?  I know which one I'd put my money on.<br>

She didn't come here to flame ppl over it though.<br>

She also learned during that time even if you do have force and you were there first, if one of your groups doesn't get the kill ... tough.<br>

She didn't come here to flame those ppl over it either.<br>

This time she was, once again, sitting and waiting for Ragefire.  This time she had force (unlike her first week of wasted time).  This time she had the group that got the exp (unlike her second week of wasted time).  And hay this time she got flamed and is getting lovely tells in game from ppl!<br>

Gratz Meadbh on camping Ragefire three times and never flaming anyone for running you over.  Class act that deserved her epic IMHO.  She respected everyone as much as possible and didn't complain when she was repeatedly screwed.  She just kept trying.<br>

Let's factor in some other information to that movie ticket example.  Person A has been standing in line for three hours to buy tickets.  They don't have the money to buy the tickets but they're there anyway.  They get up to the counter and stand there, doing mental preparation for asking to buy the tickets without any money or whatever.  There are only a limited number of seats (in fact, this is the last ticket for the last show for the day) and quite a few people are behind Person A with the money to buy.  Persons B and C step around Person A, butt heads for a moment, and Person B finally end up getting a ticket.  Now then.  Knowing that Person A did not have the means to purchase a ticket but showed no signs of doing anything but wasting time, were Persons B and C unethical in stepping around? No, they were not. <br>

<br>
<br>
Second...<br>
For those of you who are failing to comprehend what exactly Gregar has been trying to get across to you all here, please... let me bluntly explain.<br>
<br>
He is referring to something that is appearantly severely lacking among many on this server...<br>
<br>
-common decency<br>
-common respect<br>
-integrity <br>
-honor<br>
<br>
I see this lacking more and more each day among many that I meet both in game and out.  Yes... many say &quot;Its just a GAME!&quot;  .. but is it really when RL feelings are involve?  Just because you cannot &quot;see&quot; the person doesnt mean they do not have feelings.  Take the issue at hand... if it was truly just a game...<br>
<br>
-would ppl be upset right now over this?<br>
-would we even be here discussing this?<br>
-would you not get upset if it had been YOU who was the cleric sitting there for hrs on end?<br>
-would ppl be taking their own lives in RL if feelings weren't involved? (current lawsuit against EQ*)<br>
-would others be taking others lives over EQ? (other thread from Jan. where father killed daughter*)<br>
*yes, I know it wasn't &quot;JUST&quot; EQ at fault for those two incidences, but the fact is it played some part, no matter how minute.<br>
<br>
<br>
Let me relate a lil true story that happened about a year or so ago.  <br>
<br>
While Ragefire in both forms were still in SolB, &quot;Cleric 1&quot; who was 56+L, was ready to kill him for epic.  &quot;Cleric 1&quot; sat in the lair with a full grp at all times, killing FGs as they spawned, ready to call reinforcements.  Three (3) times &quot;Cleric 1&quot;  was gathering forces as soon as he spawned only to have him taken by others.  &quot;Cleric 1&quot; was so frustrated, he/she was ready to quit game entirely, and did take a bit of time off after having talked to &quot;Cleric 2&quot; about how he/she felt .  <br>
<br>
&quot;Cleric 2&quot; also 56+L, was ready to take Ragefire about the same time. &quot;Cleric 2&quot; had full grp at all times as well, killing FGs as they spawned, ready to call in reinforcements when he spawned.  Twice (2) he was taken from her by others as well.  Feeling the same frustration &quot;Cleric 1&quot; felt, &quot;Cleric 2&quot; also thought perhaps it was time to take some time off game. <br>
<br>
However... &quot;Cleric 2&quot; decided to &quot;beat the odds&quot;.  Taking a wk or so to think of the &quot;best laid plans&quot;, &quot;Cleric 2 &quot; was ready. <br>
<br>
&quot;Cleric 2&quot; notified &quot;Cleric 1&quot; of said plan thru email and they both agreed it was the best way.<br>
<br>
&quot;The plan&quot;? <br>
<br>
 ... It was for &quot;Cleric 2&quot; to keep vigil for ragefire while &quot;Cleric 1&quot; was at work and/or asleep.  When &quot;Cleric 1&quot; was able to be in the lair, &quot;Cleric 2 camped out and got sleep. When Ragefire spawned, reinforcements would be massed to help either &quot;Cleric 1&quot; or &quot;Cleric 2&quot;, depending on which was watching at that point.  As it turned out, Ragefire spawned and forces took him down for &quot;Cleric 2&quot; first. Everyone was expecting &quot;Cleric 2&quot; to immediately head to turn it in, but he/she didnt.  Why?  because the promise was made to &quot;Cleric 1&quot; by &quot;Cleric 2&quot; that the camp would be held till &quot;Cleric 1&quot; also got Ragefire heart as well.<br>
<br>
After a total of NINE (9) days straight of camping Ragefire, BOTH &quot;Clerics 1 and 2&quot;  together headed to TD to turn them in at the very same time.<br>
<br>
YES folks... THIS is what Gregar is referring to... 2 clerics from 2 different guilds have made it work in the past... IT CAN BE DONE NOW!!<br>
<br>
Just because VI says this is the way they have &quot;made&quot; it, does not mean that's the way it &quot;NEEDS&quot; to be...<br>
<br>
How do I know?.... Ask someone who was there, who &quot;Cleric 2&quot; is...<br>
<br>
Thanks.<br>

Rage is a FiF mob.<br>
<br>
being FiF is not running over someone. its being the first team that has capable number and Finite has only proven 12 aint enuf. The key here folks is Druid/Wizard mobilization.<br>
<br>
So the moral of the story is... Clerics camping Rage; spoil your druids and wizards for a speedy guild mobilization.<br>
