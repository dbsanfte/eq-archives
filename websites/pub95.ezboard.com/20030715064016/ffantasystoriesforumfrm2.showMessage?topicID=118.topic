Chapter 9<br>
<br>
&quot;The Search for Janus Begins.&quot;<br>
<br>
As some people know I've taken a break from writing, I assure you it was due to technical issues as well as leveling a necro from 53 all the way up to 58 in about a months time. I did lose the majority of my files on my computer due to an WinXP system break down. Lucky for me I had everything saved except for the beginning page of this chapter. I'll admit the first page wasn't like this at all and so I've decided just to begin anew.<br>
<br>
<br>
It was all Rita could do to keep from going into hysterics at what she heard. She would have never thought anything like this would of happened. It was now apparent that all that was said had taken place after all Selena and Daxster surely would lie to her right in front of her this very moment. Clearly something was going to have to be done now, she wanted to make sure her son was found and saved.<br>
<br>
&quot;Honestly we're sorry Rita, we had no idea things would have turned out like this.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;We came as soon as we could, it was all we could do to keep Iris from coming as well.&quot;<br>
<br>
At having said this Selena flashed Daxster a look, this was one of the many ways their daughter took after her father. She did have to admit though, they both had the tendency to act that way when they where younger. Still she knew when her daughter took more after her than her father and vice versa.<br>
<br>
&quot;It's all right, I don't blame either of you two. If anything Janus's father is more to blame for this than anyone else.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;How was I to know he would run off, or that any of this would happen?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;You could have went yourself you know!&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;I had other things to do, you know that Rita.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;I was talking about how you refused to teach him more about his powers.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;We've discussed this before, it would be better for him to discover them on his own. No amount of lecturing could have described to him what would happen.&quot;<br>
<br>
With this said Ryo crossed his arms and gave everyone a stern look. He certainly didn't like be accused of doing something wrong. Though now he did feel somewhat responsible for what had happened, but he also knew that he was needed elsewhere at the time.<br>
<br>
It was at this time that Zenki ran into the house with a frantic look on his face. Of course Rita had seen this look on his father many a time and knew just what was about to happen. She knew Shoken was prone to doing something that would upset Azia, and in turn what ensued would be nothing short of a small moving disaster.<br>
<br>
&quot;I swear! This time it wasn't my fault, I had no idea she was there!&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Zenki you bastard!!! You think hiding in there is going to save you!!!&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Leona, your overreacting, it must of been an accident.&quot;<br>
<br>
Nadia was the voice of reason, though Leona was far beyond reasoning with him now. She was determined to teach him a lesson, even if he did still have bandages on his arm. All Zenki could do was search around frantically as he searched for a way to escape. During all of this Leona beat on the door, trying to force it open with all her might.<br>
<br>
During all this Selena and Daxster could only stare at Zenki as he tried to brace himself against the door to keep Leona out. They simply where astonished at how much he resembled his father, but in his facial features as well as his personality. Of course it wasn't long before all of this came to an end, especially since Leona had managed to shove her fist through the door in a failed attempt at trying to grab a hold of Zenki.<br>
<br>
&quot;She's just as bad as Azia was!&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Selena I'm afraid she's far worse, you haven't heard of the damage she caused in Qeynos.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;I'll take your word for it Rita!&quot;<br>
<br>
It wasn't often that Zenki had a chance to try out anything he had been thinking of the past few days, but this was as good a time as any. After all if it failed he'd get beaten to a pulp, which is what would happen anyway if he didn't do something. It was now or never as Zenki suddenly pulled open the door, causing Leona to come tumbling in across the floor and gave him the perfect chance to make his escape.<br>
<br>
&quot;Damn you Zenki! Just wait till I get my hands on you!&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Leona calm down! If you don't someone's going to get hurt!&quot;<br>
<br>
Ryo could hardly keep from laughing as he heard the explosions outside from Leona's assault, along with the screams of the guards who he knew where running for cover. If anything he wasn't fond of the guards here in this city, or any city for that matter. He found that they always gave him suspicious looks, the kind that he'd rather not get from anyone let alone guards.<br>
<br>
For a long time he had managed to keep himself in check, not revealing what he preferred to call his true form. That hadn't lasted long though, especially since the incident with the Reaper and Sir William. It was a small price to pay though because he knew if he hadn't done something then the creature would of had its way and caused more senseless deaths. All he could do was shrug as he stepped over to the door to watch the commotion that the two where causing outside.<br>
<br>
Zenki was doing his best to at the time to avoid the barrage of fire that Leona was causing to rain down towards him from above. He had always hated these kinds of spells, particularly since they where hard to avoid, and even harder to control. These there two things Leona knew, in fact she had nearly mastered controlling these types of spells from the very beginning. It didn't matter if it was raw mana, fiery embers, or icy spears. She could control it all at a whim, much like her father could, and this alone was enough to make anyone leery of dealing with her.<br>
<br>
Of course her tantrum now wasn't making things easier on Zenki as he stepped up the pace of his movements. This only proved to make her temper flare all the more as she stood there before him. She wasn't exactly one to give up, no matter what, if she was determined to do something then it got done. <br>
<br>
<br>
It had taken her several days to learn where Freeport was, but she was certain that if she went there should could gain some clues as to why Janus had left so abruptly. She hated going against what her parents wanted, but she felt this was the only way she could help. If anything she couldn't just sit around and wait for the news about Janus.<br>
<br>
The trip had been hard on her, even though she knew the incantations that sent her to the western commons she had at first been lost. Along the way she had seen many marvelous sights, considering this was actually her first time on Antonica. Though it was most definitely to her advantage to keep her distance as she traveled, particularly from the dark elves she had seen.<br>
<br>
For the most part every single merchant she had ran across had been kind enough, which suited her just fine. It made finding directions that much easier, and helped to her to learn more about how the people of Freeport interacted with one another. Sometimes she felt uneasy as she traveled, mostly because of how the men tended to stare at her, but she knew this was something she'd have to become accustom to before entering the city.<br>
<br>
Iris was more than afraid as she came into view of Freeport. Of all the things she had heard she wasn't sure which would be true. It certainly was bigger than Felwithe though, this was something that hadn't been exaggerated. Also one of the many things she had found to be startling where the size of the orcs on Antonica. They where like giants compared to their brethren of Faydwer, which made Iris wonder just how the locals managed to keep them at bay.<br>
<br>
Just as she expected the guards gawked at her as she walked past them, she could definitely tell they where not of the friendlier type. Long ago she had heard that if she where to travel to Freeport she'd be better protected by the guards of North Freeport rather than the ones found in East or West Freeport. This appeared to be the case now as she made her way past the gates an past a rather large looking ogre vendor.<br>
<br>
At first sight she was alarmed that they'd let such a person into the city, but after some quick observations she realized he wasn't a danger to her. Closer inspection as she walked through the streets proved that this place welcomed nearly all the races of the world to travel. This was more evident as she seen an leather clad iksar walk down the street, a Bo staff draped across the creatures back.<br>
<br>
&quot;Excuse me, Mister. But do you know where a family by the name of Kataoka resides here?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Of courssse young lasssss. They live towards the center of the city.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Thanks kind Sir.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;No thanksss are needed, if by chance you see the one they call Ryo, tell him that Monozard would enjoy having another drink with him sssssometime again.&quot;<br>
<br>
After having said that the iksar gave what best could of been described as a smile and continued on its journey. If anything Iris was now nearly in shock, she had heard that iksars where barbaric creatures, and possibly more fierce than even Trolls or Ogres when it came to people outside of their race. It was becoming apparent to her that perhaps there where exceptions to all that she had heard.<br>
<br>
Iris had no idea of what was waiting her as she came closer to the center of the city. She seen several small pillars of smoke. Of course things began to clear after several armor clad soldiers rushed toward that area. Curiosity got the best of her and she just knew she would have to see what was going on now.<br>
<br>
<br>
Leona was cursing and swearing enough to make the most hardened of sailors blush from shame. The only thing keeping her from causing more annihilation was several of the guards that where now holding her back. To make things worse Zenki seen that as something as comical as a drunken dwarf trying to run down the street.<br>
<br>
&quot;Serves you right for making all this mess!&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;You little pervert! Wait till I get my hands on you!&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;An you call me a pervert? Talk about the pot calling the kettle black!&quot;<br>
<br>
This was all it took to push Leona over the edge, which by chance the guards first noticed as they where sent sprawling onto their backs from an eruption of pure mana. Of course her sights where set on Zenki, who promptly took this opportunity to run. This suited her just fine because she was determined to fry him no matter where he tried to run to.<br>
Zenki definitely regretted mouthing off now, he hadn't thought she'd react so violently. Now she was even more angry than before, which only proved to full the power of her spells. It wasn't so much himself he was worried about, it was about the property damage she was causing from all the explosions.<br>
<br>
Thankfully Zenki was managing to make himself a horrible target for her with the way he was moving. Truthfully people on the street where having a hard time even following his movements. This only seemed to make things more complicated for the guards who where either trying to get out of the way or pursue them through the city.<br>
<br>
What he was hoping was that she'd soon get tired and be unable to focus enough to cast her spells. Which he knew afterwards things would be much easier, and if anything it would save them the trouble of paying for more damages. Leona wasn't going to have any of it though, she had finally managed to focus on what to do to stop Zenki long enough for her to blast him.<br>
<br>
<br>
Iris had managed to get close enough to hear the commotion that was going on. She had never before heard so many people in a panic. Not only that, but she could tell the air was being saturated with mana. Whatever was going on, it was evident that who ever was casting these spells was no amateur.<br>
<br>
She had just reached the center of all the disturbance when a explosion knocked her off her feet. Now she was certain she knew what was happening. It had to of been a someone who was schooled in the airs of wizardry. Little could prepare her for what was about to happen next though, as someone practically fell on her.<br>
<br>
<br>
In his rush to avoid Leona's latest onslaught Zenki and run right into what he knew from first glance was a wood elf. This slight moment of diversion was just enough time for Leona to finish off her latest spell. It was by far the most crippling of all spells she had, a smile came to her face as she seen the earth come alive and then grasp a hold of Zenki's legs.<br>
<br>
&quot;Come on Leona, can't we talk about this?!&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;There's nothing to talk about you little pervert! I'm going to fry you once and for all!&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Uhm Excuse me Miss? You wouldn't by chance know where I could find a household with the last name of Kataoka would you?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;What do you want with this idiots family?&quot;<br>
<br>
Zenki was now thanking whatever gods existed for this new distraction. At least it gave Nadia a chance to catch up to them. Which meant just maybe Leona would calm down just enough for him to be spared. Still he knew his best chances at escape would be if he could actually break free of the earthly bonds, which happened to be covering his legs all the way up to his knees.<br>
<br>
&quot;Well I came in search of someone called Janus. Is he around?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Leona that's why Zenki came into our room like that, he came to tell us that Janus has gone missing.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Is that so? He should of knocked first you know.&quot;<br>
<br>
<br>
Shoken smiled as he walked through the city, he could tell someone was fighting here and knew that it was most likely his son and Leona. It had been a good idea to pair the two up, he knew full well that even if things came to the worst that at least Zenki could anger Leona and she'd end up blowing up whomever it was that would attack them. Besides he knew he was going to have to come back to Freeport and today was the day.<br>
<br>
On the other hand the only reason Azia had come was because she heard her son was hurt. It was one of her many instincts she'd gained since becoming a mother. Over time her more violent ways had began to fade, so now the most she would do was give her husband a good smack with a pot when he said or did something wrong.<br>
<br>
Of course they weren't alone as they entered Freeport. Leona's parents had personally came to see them, especially since the appearance of the demons. Zolf knew that something was up, and with what he heard earlier about Janus going missing after the trip to Faydwer didn't ease his mind any. Pretty much Zinka had the same thoughts as her husband, though she doubted that anything could have seriously happened to the son of someone like Ryo.<br>
<br>
&quot;So a genuine demon did show up. Somehow I doubt it could be any worse than Azia when she's angry.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Just keep it up Mister.... Don't forget I don't need a pot to bash on you the head with here.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Though both the ones that where in Freeport are dead, I'm still a bit curious as to why they where here.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Don't worry about it Dear. They're gone so our present problems are over with.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Yes I know, I suppose we should be thankful both Zenki and Ryo where here.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Sounds like Ryo had quite some fun here, wonder what he has in mind for finding his son though. It's been awhile since I seen Janus.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Well it wouldn't be awhile if we would at least come here more often!&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Why are you trying to blame this on me?! Your the one who doesn't want to travel!&quot;<br>
<br>
As to be expected, Azia had came prepared as piece of armor from the pack she was carrying and smacked Shoken with it across the face. This naturally brought a small giggle from Zinka, as well as stifled laugh from Zolf. They could tell they had calmed down for the most part, but even so, Azia didn't let Shoken get away with much more than before.<br>
<br>
It didn't take them long to make it to where they where going as they entered a house, an where greeted by family and old friends. Those being Iris's parents, as well as Ryo and his wife Rita. It was obvious they where still discussing the situation with Janus by the looks on their faces. Though they where unsure of what Ryo was feeling on this, it was evident the idea of Janus being gone was taking its toll on Rita...<br>
<br>
<br>
There is a reason this chapter is short, I hate to admit it but I feel it was going to bore everyone. In any case now I'd like to mention something now. I appreciate everyone's support for urging me to write more. I'd also like to say that I will be dedicating the next few chapters to a special person in my life. Marie, thanks for continuing to reach out to me even though I was so filled with hurt, sorrow, and anger. I've said things to you that where not right and know I can't ever repair the damage I've done... <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top"> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub95.ezboard.com/ffantasystoriesforumfrm2.showPrevMessage?topicID=118.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub95.ezboard.com/ffantasystoriesforumfrm2.showNextMessage?topicID=118.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a self href=http://pub95.ezboard.com/ffantasystoriesforumfrm2.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=118.topic><img src=http://Auction.2y.net/user/paradisetheheretic/addreply.jpg border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub95.ezboard.com/ffantasystoriesforumfrm2.emailToFriend?topicID=118.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub95.ezboard.com/ffantasystoriesforumfrm2.threadControl?topicID=118.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/professional/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands</a><br> <a href=http://pub95.ezboard.com/ffantasystoriesforumfrm2.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=118.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/ultimate/subscribe.gif width=20 height=20 border=0 alt="Click to receive email notification of replies"> Click to receive email notification of replies</a> <br>  <a href=http://pub95.ezboard.com/ffantasystoriesforumfrm2.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=118.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/ultimate/unsubscribe.gif width=20 height=20 border=0 alt="Click to stop receiving email notification of replies"> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies</a> <br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub95.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="fantasystoriesforumfrm1">General Fantasy Stories<option value="fantasystoriesforumfrm2">EverQuest Stories<option value="fantasystoriesforumfrm11">Fantasy Inspired Art<option value="fantasystoriesforumfrm14">Fantasy Inspired Poetry<option value="fantasystoriesforumfrm7">Role Playing Forum<option value="fantasystoriesforumfrm3">Suggestions for FSF<option value="fantasystoriesforumfrm4">Off-Topic Discussions<option value="fantasystoriesforumfrm12">Polls:  Off-Topic and Otherwise<option value="fantasystoriesforumfrm5">Stories by:  Paradise Perdu<option value="fantasystoriesforumfrm6">Stories by:  Bellona Kali<option value="fantasystoriesforumfrm8">Stories by:  Mindles Kali<option value="fantasystoriesforumfrm9">Stories by:  Ryvian<option value="fantasystoriesforumfrm10">Stories by:  Dahnyella Sylvanblitz<option value="fantasystoriesforumfrm15">Stories by:  Shoken</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#FF0000>- </font><a href=http://pub95.ezboard.com/bfantasystoriesforum>Fantasy Stories Forum</a><font color=#FF0000> - </font><a href=http://pub95.ezboard.com/ffantasystoriesforumfrm2>EverQuest Stories</a> <font color=#FF0000> - </font><br><br><table border=0 align=center><tr><td align=center><a href="http://login.ezboard.com/BBSSystem.showUserPaymentScreen" target="_blank">Upgrade your account to ezSupporter...</a></td><td><img src="http://www.ezboard.com/image/spacer.gif" width=15 height=1 border=0></td><td align=center><a href="http://login.ezboard.com/BBSSystem.showUserPaymentScreen" target="_blank">...and never see another ad or pop-up again</a></td></tr></table><CENTER><!-- START BOTTOM AD SCRIPT -->
