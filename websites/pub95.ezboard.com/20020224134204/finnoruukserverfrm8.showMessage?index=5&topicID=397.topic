You are full of dung, and offer nothing to the Innoruuk.com community.  When you're an ass, apologize, admit you're an ass and move on.<br>
So it's all a joke when you attack someone personally huh?  I'm sure that Ally doesn't need my backing, but your attack on her is not only uncalled for, it's completely misguided.<br>
You, Gamiene, are a worthless piece of trash who does nothing but spread hatred and discontent.  You are a festering pile of pestilence, that would make even a necro gag.  I hope maggots eat your flesh.<br>

You are the most unbelievable person I have ever had the misfortune to encounter here I believe.<br>
<br>
I didnt' prove your point, the 'Mommy spank' mentality is clearly all in your head, and if you don't mind, I would rather not hear about your messed up fetishes.<br>
<br>
Allyssia is the owner of the board. She took some time away, probably cause she needed a break from dealing with jackass posters &lt;or is that posers?&gt; like you.  She never said she would not be coming back, unlike your words on more than one occasion.  She never said she wouldnt' be assisting on the board, she said her role would not be so active for awhile.  So again, your words, PKB.  Maybe if YOU go away, she will?  Or maybe she doesnt' have to, since her actions haven't contradicted any of her statements, temporary means not forever, in case you weren't sure...<br>
<br>
Changing titles? She hasn't changed yours to Superbitch or IQ&lt;3 or TrollSupreme... she's fixed titles that were altered for post bumping, she's put them back to normal.  She changed a post count number. How do either of those hurt you?<br>
<br>
No  one trusted you to run the board Gamiene. -chuckle- Get over it.<br>
<br>
And just for the record, banning you for personal attacks would be following the rules of this board. So I guess her commitment would be to those... But good try.<br>

I'm constantly amazed how one person could get so many things wrong in a single post. You're just aces at it, really.<br>
<br>
Alas, your memory seems as full of holes as your rebuttal. Soon after the message board was put up, she announced she was 'passing the torch' to others and wouldn't be involved in the runnings. Of course, soon thereafter, whaddayknow? She's goobering around with titles, telling people how they should or shouldn't /bump posts to increase faction... as if it matters. <br>
<br>
Sad to see your mind jumps right to the fetish, but 'mommy spank' mentality is a reference to the fact she seems to think her opinions on 'The Way Things Ought To Be' are immutable, and she's forever 'warning' people of the 'punishment' if they don't 'straighten up' and 'mind' her wishes. <br>
<br>
I could have said 'anal retentive'... but since that is a quality shared by a few here, I didn't want to distract anyone. <br>
<br>
Now... about your wish fulfillment issues, Cedea. I've never said I wouldn't be coming back. You wish I had.<br>
<br>
Next we'll have a simple language review... since you seem unable to comprehend monosyllabics in context... <br>
<br>
'Changing titles' isn't that hard a concept to understand, Cedea. Well, for most of us, anyway. You see, the word 'change' means to alter or make other than it would naturally be.... therefore, any change that isn't a natural occurrence (in this case, posting) is indeed included in the context of the sentence. Similarly, you seem to have issues with the word 'normal'... and, while I certainly understand you have a skewed grasp of the meaning, it remains that in this case, 'normal' would also mean the natural state of the post count, not a subjective decision as to what it 'ought' to be.<br>
<br>
And just in case you're still missing the simple meaning here, I'll summarize -- the 'normal' posting count was 'changed'. Why? Because Ally seems to think her opinion of who has what faction is important and that some level of credibility is conferred to those with high post counts. Further, that there is some objective definition of a 'legitimate' post and she's the only proper arbitor of deciding what does and doesn't meet it. <br>
<br>
All of which is, of course, utter bullcrap.<br>
<br>
The point and question isn't 'does it hurt Gamiene?', you pathetic excuse for sentience. It is that, in a community-based forum, especially once where responsibilities are delegated to others, there is no excuse or reason that arbitrary reactionism such as this should be condoned.<br>
<br>
Your foray into this thread is little more than your typical vulturism. Too cowardly and ill-equipped to garner your own, you scuttle after scraps not unlike your namesake -- making all manner of ferocious noises that never seem as frightful as they do humorous. You see, Cedea -- you're too transparent to ever be other than predictable and you're much too lacking cognitively to ever be more than laughable.<br>
<br>
Oh, wait. I forgot who I was talking to... let me put it into words you can grasp, tootz...<br>
