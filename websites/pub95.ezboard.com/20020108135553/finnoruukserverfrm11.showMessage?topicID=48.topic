&quot;I pledge allegiance to the flag, of the United States of America, and to the Republic, for which it stands...&quot; I can go that far... &quot;one nation under God, indivisible...&quot; nope, sorry, take your yankee propoganda elsewhere. If the DoC stands for anything, it's that there can come a time when must break the bonds that have tied one people to another. The indivisible part was inserted as a slap to those who (rightly) believed a union of States meant just that.<br>
<br>
&quot;With liberty and justice for all.&quot; &lt;-- needs &quot;Americans&quot; at the end. Don't care 'bout liberty and justice for anyone who isn't American. They have their own rules.<br>

I love this country but it was founded on principles of making this a place where noone need feel like they don't belong simply due to the religion they follow.  The framers of the Constitution were very clear on the need for separation of Church and State and yet people keep insisting on tying them together.  I haven't said the pledge of allegiance since I was in Catholic grade school, and won't start now.  Last I heard freedom of religion meant all religions and none at all, so the &quot;One nation, under god...&quot; part bothers me as well.  I recently read of a Catholic school that also modified it to say &quot;with liberty and justice for the born and unborn&quot; when they were on a big anti-abortion kick.  I am against people changing things like the pledge whenever they feel like it to advance their agenda...  and the phrase &quot;Under God&quot; was added in the 1950s.<br>
<br>
Please note...  I do not hate Christians.  However, I do object strenuously to any attempt to make ME or anyone else become one unwillingly.  Schools should not be preaching religion, if anything they should be teaching about all the different religions but I don't see that happening any time soon.<br>
<br>
sorry for the soapbox...  I feel real strongly about this issue though.<br>

I have a problem with ordinary people changing things like that for just their agenda du jour, too. I don't have a problem with people pledging allegiance to the nation, though like with most such things it often becomes more ceremony than meaningful (like feeling someone's pain rather than doing something to alleviate it...) but I do feel nervous about a set, rote phrase to be used. As agnostic, the under God part doesn't bother me; after all, jews, christians and moslems all believe in the same God, just different interpretations of him, and they make up the vast vast majority of people in the country. If you happen to be a wiccan, you can say something stupid instead, like &quot;Earth Mother&quot; or whatever (sorry, I have contempt for wiccans, druids and other tree huggers <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  ) If you're satanists, you can get to a psychiatrist. If you are a pantheist, pick your favorite or change God to &quot;the gods&quot;. If you're Amish, or one of the religions that forbid such pledges, don't take the pledge.<br>
While it may make kids feel uncomfortable and left-out to not join in a pledge their parents disapprove of, it is standing up for one's beliefs in such adverse circumstances that builds character, in my opinion. After all, what character does it take to stand up for a principle that everyone agrees with?<br>
I have a related problem,  in regard to your comment about the resurgence of patriotism. And that's people thinking they're being patriotic by have a flag plastered somewhere, like a happy face. I truly grow annoyed when I see some bugger wearing a flag on his t-shirt, or wearing a flag bandanna. If you care enough to go to the lazy arsed trouble of plunking 10 bucks down for a shirt or bandanna, go to the trouble of learning the *rules* regarding the display of the flag, one of which is that it's not to be worn as an article of clothing. I see people hanging the flag upside down or backwards, and for years I have griped at car dealerships and other places displaying huge, tattered flags. &quot;Well, they're expensive to replace!&quot; Hey, then don't fly them! Nobody says you have to! I once had to stop at a fire station to get them to change their tattered flag. The explanation was that the new one hadn't come in yet; the next day, a new one was flying. I know I'm an *$$h0le about this, but it's consistent with my belief that actions speak louder than words.<br>

However, that isn't something that's fair to expect of elementary school children, or really kids of any age.  Kids can be so mean to anyone who is not like the others around them.  When you're 11 and you have to choose between not standing up for your beliefs or looking stupid and being picked on by the other kids in your class... well.  That's not the easiest choice in the world, and neither choice is a good one.  However, I feel less strongly about the Pledge than I do about prayers in schools, and the ten commandments being posted.<br>
<br>
I agree on the flag thing too...  and heh all these people rushing out to buy flags immediately after the 11th, like my mom says, &quot;if they're so patriotic why didn't they already have one?&quot;<br>
My mom worked at the time in a local Hallmark store.  People were going in there asking for flags and then getting angry when told there weren't any there, and basically throwing fits.<br>
<br>
I liked one of the editorial cartoons in the paper recently, showing one of the big SUVs with flags plastered all over next to a plain vanilla commuter car with great gas mileage, with the mileage labled over each vehicle, and at the bottom it said to point out the patriot...<br>

The articles described children going to summer camps in organizations similar to Boy and Girl Scouts, wearing red scarves which apparently symbolized the Communist Party. The slant of the article was that these kids were being brainwashed by the Communist Party by Hoo-Rah Propaganda. <br>
<br>
No one ever mentioned how, not 30 minutes before, the entire school stood up at the same time to recite The Pledge.<br>
<br>
Requiring children to recite the Pledge is Hoo-Rah Propaganda. <br>
<br>
Don't get me wrong. I'm a patriot. I even served in the Armed Forces. I've never missed voting in any primary or general election I have ever been eligible to vote in. I pay my taxes, I take pains to stay informed and when I vote, I think about what's good for my city/county/state/country/world, and not just what's going to give me the most benefit. <br>
<br>
However, I want my children to have learned the history of our country, and the histories of other countries, and to appreciate the liberties, freedoms, and (most of all) responsibilities we have as Americans, so that they can recite the Pledge and mean it (if that is their choice), rather than to hear them recite it because that's what the teacher told them to do. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#f7f7f7><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub95.ezboard.com/uhiraghm.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Hiraghm</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Indifferent Poster</span><br>  Posts: 204<br> <font color=#778899>(10/24/01 4:33:39 pm)</font><br>    <BR><img src=http://members.home.com/jdwilliams2/data/Aldrinshroom1.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Pledge of Allegiance</span><hr size=1> &quot;How can the attitude of 200 million people be switched on and off like a light bulb? How can one set of facts be made to produce three widely differing pravdas? By complete control of all communications from cradel to the grave.<br>
&quot;Almost all Soviet women work. Their babies are place in kindergartens at an average age of 57 days, so we were told, and what we saw supported the allegation. We visisted several kindergartens, on collective farms and in factories. By the posted schedules these babies spend 13 1/2 hours each day in kindergarten - they are with their mothers for perhaps an hour before bedtime.<br>
&quot;At the Forty-Years_of_October Collective Farm outside Alma Ata some of the older children in one of the kindergartens put on a little show for us. One little girl recited a poem. A little boy gave a prose recitation. The entire group sang. The cildren were clean and neat, healthy and happy. Our guide translated nothing, so superficially, it wa the sort of beguiling performance one sees any day in any American kindergarten.<br>
&quot;However, my wife understands Russian:<br>
  The poem recounted the life of Lenin.<br>
  The prose recitation concerned the Seven-year Plan.<br>
  The group singing was about how &quot;we must protect our Revolution.&quot;<br>
&quot;These tots were no older than six.<br>
&quot;That is how it is done. Starting at the cradle, never let them haer anything but the official version. Thus 'pravda' becomes 'truth' to the Russian Children.&quot; - Robert A. Heinlein &quot;Pravda Means 'Truth'&quot;, an account of his visit to the Soviet Union in the early 1960s. <br>
He goes on to explain the results of such indoctrination; an intourist guide becomes angry and abusive when Heinlein's wife informs a fellow foreigner that Vilno is the capital of Lithuania, one of the formerly independent Baltic republics. According to this guide, Lithuania was *always* a part of the Soviet Union.<br>
<br>
How does this apply to U.S.? I'm not concerned with children reciting a pledge of loyalty to their native country. I'm concerned with children being inundated day and night by propoganda from the tv portraying men as abusive and weak; propoganda suggesting that all bad things prior to 1960 were due to anglo male insecurity, and all things wonderful and good were due to wise, kind liberals who even then (even though anglo and male) knew that things should be as they are today. I'm more concerned with children who have so little knowledge of history that the idea of not offending the perpetrators of Pearl Harbor during last December's commemoration sounds rational to them. I'm more concerned with jr high school children claiming to feel nothing for their nation, and their own principal concuring this sentiment. I'm more concerned with female idiot teachers (now there's a redundancy for you...) suggesting that algebra I and II not be required *high school* subjects, because it might discourage the little darlings. Let them take business math instead (my mother pointed out to me that when she was in school, she didn't have a choice.. she took *both*.) I'm more concerned with an entire society where it is forbidden to offend specific classes of citizens, but not only allowed, but *encouraged* to insult and offend certain other classes. I'm concerned about a society where a teacher can remove a picture posted on a boy's locker portraying the persecution of enemies of his nation (a picture of planes bombing Afghanistan with United and American Airline logos on them,) and merely be taken to court to get the boy's supsension lifted (instead of losing his job.) I'm far more concerned about propoganda which frequently portrays females physically abusing males and being rewarded and applauded for it. I'm far more concerned about children being indoctrinated in &quot;global warming&quot; hysteria, of being constantly inundated with tales of how terrible their species is, how their ONE TOOL for making the world better, technology, is the cause of all problems. I'm more concerned about children being raised by strangers in day-care centers or baby-sitters who are little more than children themselves so mommy and daddy can pursue &quot;careers&quot;; meanwhile the children learning the common mindless propoganda of the lowest common denominator at the hands of those strangers, whose own kids are quite likely in another day-care facility.<br>
I'm excessively concerned that children are being taught that there's nothing, nobody, no idea that they can cling to as an absolute. No dad *and* mom there, always. No oath truly binding &quot;til death do us part&quot;, no absolutes of good and evil, of moral and immoral. I worry about propoganda spewing forth from the networks and hollywood and even the gov't itself, suggesting that there's no difference between your loved ones and strangers; no difference between men who &quot;shoot their prisoners, enslave their citizens, and deride the dignity of man&quot; and those &quot;to whom the individual and his indiviual rights are sacred&quot; (in the words of General Matt Ridgeway.) I'm terrified of a propoganda machine that insists on portraying the alleged abuses by the europeans who created civilization on the N. American continent of then-native populations as being emotional in intent and entirely one-sided, refuses to point out that mankind is better on the whole (including the decendants of the alleged victims) for it, and blithely ignores the similar abuses taking place between various factions long before Europeans set foot on the continent. I'm far more deeply concerned about public mores being so twisted in a 30-year propoganda campaign that at the end of it the coupling of sexual deviants is equated with the lifetime commitment of man and wife, the society's children not knowing the difference, and anyone suggesting otherwise being hatefully and desperately demonized as fearful and ignorant. I'm disgusted, yet no less concerned with a media and educational indoctrination of the young that focusses on the exception represented by abusiveness and deceit rather than the charitable and honest reality of pre-revolutionary society. <br>
No, I refuse to take the pledge, as an adult, because I believe the very words contradict the truths stated in the Declaration of Independence. &quot;one nation, indivisible&quot; cannot exist so long as men reserve the right to &quot;dissolve those ties which have bound them to another.&quot; (taken from memory, therefore not word-for-word aligned with the DoI.)<br>
But there's nothing wrong with a child being taught that a nation dedicated to the precepts of individual liberty and self-determination is worthy of their allegiance. There's nothing wrong with a child being made to realise that, by and large, the people of his nation believe that they, as a nation, are answerable to a higher, benign and caring power. I was taught this, and remain agnostic. There's nothing wrong in making them aware that their nation is, unlike most, a republic, not a democracy. Unfortunately, there is no way, in the span of a short pledge, of showing those same children that the flag to which they are pledging allegiance is being defended by young men just like what half of them will grow up to be, that such people are superior because of the values embraced by their nation; no way of demonstrating with words in that pledge that there are men (and even women) who in the words of an old song, &quot;mean just what they say.&quot; No way a pledge can describe men, with their dying breath holding that colored piece of cloth aloft hoping to keep it from touching the ground before another can raise it again. No way to make them understand the frustration of men piling cartons of icecream around the flagstaff to keep that bit of material from burning as their ship sinks beneath them and MITSUBISHIs strafe and bomb their decks, simply because there was nothing else they could do. No, the pledge, by itself, is just so many words, prattled mindlessly. Unless those reciting it can, by other means, be made aware of what that silly looking bit of red and white striped material has meant to people of character, people worthy of emulation, people of faith, and dignity and honesty, and be made equally aware that moral relativism is no substitute for the most insigificant feeling of loyalty or integrity.<br>
I began by quoting Heinlein, I'll end by quoting him:<br>
&quot;But there is no way of forcing patriotism on anyone. Passing a law will not create it, nor can we buy it by appropriating so many billions of dollars.&quot; - R.A.H. 'The Pragmatics of Patriotism'<br>
We can't force it, but we can teach it. And if the children are simply made to know the truth about themselves, their species, and their nation, they won't have to be told to recite the pledge; it will engrave itself upon their hearts, upon their souls for the rest of their lives.<br>

Actually, hillbillies are from Missouri, just as q u e e r s are from San Francisco and sambos are from Alabama, and coonasses are from Louisiana  and retarded atheists are from New England. WHO GIVES A SH1T IF SOMEONE IS UNCOMFORTABLE? Gee, I bet showing &quot;To Hell and Back&quot; might make cowards uncomfortable; better not show it. Better lock any tales of Horatio Alger away lest the lazy and incompetent feel offended. I don't see atheists lining up to prevent evolution from being taught in schools because *that* might offend Christians, Jews and Moslems. (and yes, evolution's a fact, not a theory, whether it offends or not.)  <br>
What this &quot;Texas hillbilly&quot; knows is that nowhere in the Constitution is a separation of *religion* and state mentioned. The lazy phrase &quot;separation of church and state&quot; is a construction of the supreme court, that's gotten the rest of the Constitution wrong too, from time to time. The whole point of the first Amendment was to prevent the creation of the equivalent of the Anglican church (which would have had financial repurcussions as well as religious ones.) That's what the phrase &quot;...respecting an establishment of religion&quot; meant. It was *not* to protect the delicate ears of agitators. Go ahead, pray to your deity at the top of your lungs on the front steps of the court house! Even if I have to work there, or walk past you, or stand waiting for a bus...

God, you people are so f-ing afraid of being offended and don't even think of the countless ways you mindlessly offend others. But that's okay. Those others are all agents of Goldstein, we know this.<br>
Tell me, if I call an atheist a khafir, can he be offended twice? Once for being called unbeliever, and once for being called...well... black? Do you get bonus points for multiple offenses? Will it eventually become unacceptable and perhaps illegal to even know any of the epithets and derogatory terms in existence... if so... how will anyone know if a term is offensive or not? &lt;-- rhetorical question, please do not attempt to answer, your smug sense of self-righteousness might be bruised.<br>

If you don't think the same way that just makes those mantras mean all the more to me.  Believe what you will it is your right but understand that not all of us have been brainwashed my parents tried to raise me Unitarian, my dad's mother pushed for Southern Baptist /shudder, and my mother's parents are atheists, I choose to reserve judgement at a young age.  It's not the words its what they mean to me the words mean I am free.

But I won't just toss that out as a flame, I'll explain why I say that.<br>
<br>
A firm Christian/Wiccan/Shaman/Satanist will at some point have their faith tested.  They will pray, fast, read doctrine, and ponder.  They will search their soul, talk to their spiritual leaders or guides, and they will decide that yes, their religion is true.<br>
<br>
A firm Agnostic might go to several churches, read books of doctrine, and talk to people of various faiths.  They will then say &quot;I cannot find proof that there is a higher consciousness.  But if I can find that truth then I would accept that there is/are (a) God(s)&quot;.<br>
<br>
A firm Atheist says &quot;I don't believe in a God or Gods, and unless God comes and talks to me there isn't one&quot;.<br>
<br>
So I find it kind of funny that so many &quot;Atheists&quot; seem to somehow think they're intellectually superior when in fact they are the most intellectually lazy.  Personally I think anyone who claims to be an Atheist or Agnostic and gets offended by the term &quot;God&quot; is really someone who thinks there is one but doesn't want to believe in one, so they are vocal about attacking anyone who might challenge their fragile belief system.  <br>
<br>
Oh and Aldrin?  That little crack about Satanists needing to see a psychiatrist?  Pretty funny that someone who wants to scream bloody murder about the word &quot;God&quot; in their National Anthem because it's pushing views on someone would then take a crack at someone over their personal beliefs.  Since to you God is made up, then so is Satan.  So to a real Atheist, it wouldn't matter.<br>
<br>

And I didn't say it had to be seperate, it should. If there's something that makes a large group of people on a National level feel left out because they aren't part of a religion, wouldn't you agree that would be a bad thing?<br>
And how are you to say evolution is a *fact*? It has yet to be proven beyond a doubt. But it does need to be taught in schools IMO, as other scientific theories are. The fact that athiests aren't flocking to make it not taught is probably because a majority of them believe in evolution. And guess what? Evolution still isn't taught in schools anyway. How will we know if a term is offensive or not? If the majority of the people the term is aimed at say they don't enjoy being called that, it's offensive. Look the term up in a dictionary.<br>
  Did you know they no longer call it Christmas break? Think on that one a bit. They changed it because it did offend people. And there is a difference between being a coward and a system of beliefs, I can't even believe you compared the 2.<br>
And I honestly don't care one way or the other what he(the president) believes in. The fact that he used his position to get it publicity and make it a &quot;national&quot; thing bugs me the most. If I became president and used the position to attempt to make others comply with my beliefs, I bet religious people would be upset too. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub95.ezboard.com/uminibaolin.showPublicProfile?language=EN>MiniBaolin</A> at: 10/27/01 2:21:01 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#f7f7f7><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub95.ezboard.com/uhiraghm.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Hiraghm</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Indifferent Poster</span><br>  Posts: 236<br> <font color=#778899>(10/27/01 5:11:29 pm)</font><br>    <BR><img src=http://members.home.com/jdwilliams2/data/Aldrinshroom1.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Pledge of Allegiance</span><hr size=1> Uhm..

As for Satanists needing a psychiatrist... According to the mythology I've encountered, Satan is the agent of hatred, suffering, and destruction. Anyone who would worship that... wouldn't you think they were a little sick in the head? Well, I do, whether you do or not.<br>

It's religion in general, people tend to have the attitude of I'm right and you're wrong, many times not allowing them to exercise the right. It isn't just Muslims and Christians, although they get the most publicity because it happens a lot more often with them, simply because there are more of them so there is a greater chance of some narrow-minded individual to be part of that religion. Even with religions that are strictly pacifist, they still have histories of making them feel unwanted in the community. And if it weren't for religion it would be for something else. (And BTW the fact that they're Muslim has very little to do with them attacking the WTC. Yes, they say they die for Allah but they're really doing it because they hate freedom, seeing as it would jeapordize their power)<br>
  As for protestants/catholics, yes in colonial times they fought, but some of that was also because they were 2 of the major powers. Part of their friction was because of differences of religion, but part of their killing of each other was about the land in the New World. Religion just escalated it more. <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top">  Page  <b>1</b> <a href=http://pub95.ezboard.com/finnoruukserverfrm11.showMessageRange?topicID=48.topic&start=21&stop=23>2</a> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub95.ezboard.com/finnoruukserverfrm11.showMessage?topicID=72.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub95.ezboard.com/finnoruukserverfrm11.showMessage?topicID=64.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br></td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub95.ezboard.com/finnoruukserverfrm11.emailToFriend?topicID=48.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub95.ezboard.com/finnoruukserverfrm11.threadControl?topicID=48.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/professional/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands (Moderator only)</a><br> <a href=http://pub95.ezboard.com/finnoruukserverfrm11.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=48.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub95.ezboard.com/finnoruukserverfrm11.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=48.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub95.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="innoruukserverfrm2">Innoruuk - News<option value="innoruukserverfrm3">Innoruuk - General<option value="innoruukserverfrm4">Innoruuk - Guilds<option value="innoruukserverfrm5">Innoruuk - For Sale/Trade<option value="innoruukserverfrm6">Innoruuk - For Sale/Trade [Gems & Spells]<option value="innoruukserverfrm7">Innoruuk - Roleplaying<option value="innoruukserverfrm8">Innoruuk - Rants<option value="innoruukserverfrm9">Innoruuk - Voting<option value="innoruukserverfrm10">Innoruuk - Playground<option value="innoruukserverfrm11">Innoruuk - OOC<option value="innoruukserverfrm14">Innoruuk - Ask Innoruuk Forum Staff<option value="innoruukserverfrm12">Moderator Forum<option value="innoruukserverfrm15">Moved/Locked Threads<option value="innoruukserverfrm13">Staff Forum</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#778899>- </font><a href=http://pub95.ezboard.com/binnoruukserver>Innoruuk Server</a><font color=#778899> - </font><a href=http://pub95.ezboard.com/finnoruukserverfrm11>Innoruuk - OOC</a> <font color=#778899> - </font><br><br><br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 6.4 b8<br>Copyright ©1999-2001 ezboard, Inc.</center></body></html>
