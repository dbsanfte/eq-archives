All the people I saw come and go here, I always told myself &quot;that won't be me&quot; but now it is.<br><br>I'm leaving eq, possibly forever. It just doesn't have that certain thing it had, that thing I can't explain. When Porizj was a naked necro in Nek forest turning down free silk armor and getting owned by snakes it was there. When Porizj was soloing crocs in Oasis and turning down a free Flowing Black Robe (which was uber as hell back then) it was there. When Porizj took down him first ever Hill Giant without so much as a buff from anyone else and turning down free spells it was there. When he got his Shining Metallic Robe after 6 lost rolls and 4 turned down free robes from group members (who thought it was insane I still be using a Green Silken Drape at level 45) it was there. The six months in level 52 where he refused to level until he got on a Naggy raid, and turned down phat lewts left right and center from &quot;uber&quot; friends who made more cash in a night than he saw in a month, it was there. These last two months or so, though, things changed. It just stopped being eq, the fun dwindled. For a few weeks when I sat in Nek forest and kept the new generation of noobs who got eq for christmas alive, it almost came back, but still it wasn't there. I no longer get that great feeling from seeing the character selection screen, the lame loading music no longer makes me smile, and even the great friends I talk to (and love making fun of) can't seem to replace &quot;it&quot;. I know it's there for a lot of people, but for me, no more. <br><br>I may not have achieved as much as other people, but I'm damn proud of what I did. My necro isn't as high as your necro, but damned if I haven't played him four times as much. to me leveling was just a side effect of having fun. If ever there was a chance to have fun as the cost of exp, I'd take it without thinking twice. No one was willing to take the death touch? Give me 10 minutes and I'll be there to shout out &quot;%T who is your daddy?&quot; before I run out and take it for the team. Just started an alt twink and need to get it up a few levels? Send me a tell and I'll be there, regardless of whatever I'm killing at the time. If I happen to ding while I'm helping a friend camp somewhere, well good, but so what? I enjoy passing out fish rolls and publicly making fun of my friends more than any of you enjoy the quest to become uber.<br><br>I don't know what all I've achieved, but I'm damn proud of a few things. I'm damn proud that I've never taken anything for free. I'm damn proud that I became a master smith long before you could use shift to buy a whole stack at once, or Ctrl to select one thing at a time. I'm damn proud that I never took a surname, no matter how many people told me I was a noob because of it, as I never needed or wanted one. I'm damn proud that I always managed to stay unguilded even though there wasn't a single person on my friend list who wasn't trying to get me to join their guild. I'm damn proud of my silk shoes and silk gloves that I still wear at level 53 because I never got a taste for farming and couldn't afford anything decent. I'm damn proud that I, the unguilded one, got an Eye of Innoruuk. I'm damn proud that I traded it the next day for a staff of the dreaded gaze as there was no way I was going to get the necro epic, not because I couldn't, but because it's just that ugly, quack. I'm damn proud that I've spent at least 40% of my life income on handing out flowers to nice ladies, especially around Porizjmas. Mostly though, I'm damn proud of the friend's I've made, even if they all thought at one time or another that I was mental.<br><br>I don't know if any of the people I hung out with on eq ever go here, but just in case they do I thought I'd post. I'd like to publicly thank a few of the people who come to mind as the best friends I've made on eq. <br><br>Tamato. What can I say? You've been one of the closest friends I've ever had. No one has ever helped me out with as many RL problems as you. And the constant rezzing didn't hurt much either Oh, by the way, NO I WILL NOT join your guild =)<br><br>Kikatinalong. Get a shorter name, you git. You're right up there with Tamato as far as being a great friend and helping me out with RL troubles. If only you could learn to taunt off my pet, hehe.<br><br>Aelana. You get alot of flak from people, but to me you've never been anything but a wonderful person. The kindness and understanding you've shown me, not to mention your compassion and how sad you got when your guild rules kept you from letting me roll on that POG necro robe is truly amazing. If it wasn't for me thinking that eq weddings are lame, I would have asked for your hand months ago. And no, I WILL NOT join your guild either.<br><br>Jerax. I'll miss you bro. I've never had anything but a great time when you were around. <br><br>Merlic. No, I WILL NOT join your guild. Thanks for the porting whenever I needed it. Thanks for your great sense of humor. Thanks for hanging out with me when I was bored in CS. Thanks for being a chum. Oh, and tell Merlica she wants me.<br><br>Ninina. I didn't see you very much near the end, but I'll never forget you. In the over two years I've been playing, you've always been a great friend.<br><br>Zyphon. I didn't get to hang out with you much, but few people out there truly appreciate fish rolls as much as you do.<br><br>Dragntuch. Sorry about that time I <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> ...</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->, I mean beat you in that duel. You're a badass monk, and I'm sure you could kick the snot out of any other necro, just not me, heh. You've always been fun, and I'm gonna miss taking every chance I can to bug you.<br><br>Gamiene. I'm not sure if I'm spelling your name right. Even after all the time I've known you I seem to get it wrong like 50% of the time. You're one of the sweetest, kindest girls I know, and I'll really miss watching you kill those wyverns with such skill.<br><br>Neoh Jones. You don't play eq anymore. Your first character was removed from the game due to your &quot;creative&quot; way of talking, and the way you treated GM's. You came back though, on a new character, but soon Norrath lost its appeal and AO won you over. I haven't talked to you in months, but you will not soon be forgotten. You rock the dock, bro.<br><br>Ualaelin. you always knew everything about anything that had to do with necromancers. You will always be the coolest necro I've known (besides me, of course).<br><br>Angelika. I didn't get to see you much in my last few months, Angel, but you never missed the chance to let me know that even if I was unguilded, unuber, and had no surname, I was just as good as the rest of them. Sometimes I would go on raids just because I knew you'd be there.<br><br>There are so many others I should be thanking, but I don't have all that good of a memory, and tonight I'm going to be  on eq saying goodbye to all my friends anyways, so if I missed them on here I'll get them on there.<br><br><br>I don't suppose this will kick up much dust. The world won't miss me as much as it misses most. I was always pretty quiet, and due to my lack of want to join a guild I'm sure not many people have ever even heard of me before. Still though, I thought it would only be fair for me to bid farewell to the best friend I've ever had: Innoruuk.<br><br><br>Yours Always:<br>Porizj <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub95.ezboard.com/unzazdanazty.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Nzaz DaNazty</A> at: 1/14/02 8:45:28 am<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#f7f7f7><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub95.ezboard.com/uctuttle.showPublicProfile?language=EN>ctuttle</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Indifferent Poster</span><br> <font color=#778899>(1/13/02 12:49:29 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub95.ezboard.com/finnoruukserverfrm3.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=928.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.somuchtuttle.com/pics/eq/dorimhead.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: I can't believe it</span><hr size=1> It's a great attitude you have there.
