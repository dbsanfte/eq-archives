Note that I'm NOT an expert on this.  However, I try to be well-informed, and I try to listen to how other people feel, even when I disagree with them.<br>
<br>
So consider this all with a grain of salt, and please don't bash me if the information isn't perfect.  It should at least give people an idea of some of the issues.<br>
<br>
The U.S. has two interests in the middle east -- Israel and Oil.  It is U.S. foreign policy to protect our interests overseas.<br>
<br>
It is the opinion of many that Israel would not exist as a state without U.S. support.  Furthermore, many people feel that the U.S. could pressure Israel to back off on some of the palestine issues.  Settlements in the Gaza plus some of the heavy-handedness appear to be most at stake.<br>
<br>
So anyone who dislikes Israel is also likely to dislike the U.S. for our support.<br>
<br>
---<br>
<br>
However, there's a bigger issue than all of this...  The U.S. seeks to retain political stability in the middle east, especially Saudi Arabia, with all it's oil.  It turns out that much of our imported oil comes from other sources, but we choose to use our influence to protect the stability so that countries like Japan don't get nervous and feel a need to rebuild a large armed forces to do it themselves.<br>
<br>
The U.S. governmental policy is that a strong U.S. looking out for everyone is a far safer, more stable planet than if each country has to look out for itself.  This is why we've become the policeman of the world.  Personally, I'd rather see this as a U.N. initiative, but that's a separate issue.<br>
<br>
So, the U.S. government, when encountering a government of an oil-rich nation that it can deal with, will help to ensure that government stays in power.  We supported the Shah of Iran (a very unpopular dictator).  And we support the Saudi family -- the monarchy that runs Saudi Arabia.  And below I'll offer some comments regarding Iraq.<br>
<br>
Yes, Saudi Arabia is run as a monarchy.  They suppress the human rights we in America assume are god-given -- such as political parties, etc.<br>
<br>
Bin Laden would like us to get our noses out of Saudi Arabia, because he wants to establish a government similar to the Taliiban -- an extremist, religion-based government.<br>
<br>
People in the U.S. would generally be appalled at this idea -- because of our strong belief in separation of church and state.  However, how come we've never had a jewish president?  Muslim?  In fact, do you think an agnostic could be elected President?  So don't be too judgemental about this view -- because it would be somewhat hypocritical of us to judge this goal.<br>
<br>
No, I don't like the Taliban.  I was horrified several years ago when I saw how they were coming to power.  But that doesn't invalidate the concept of a church-based government.<br>
<br>
---<br>
<br>
Iraq -- do you ever wonder why Saddam Hussein is still in power?  Why did we allow this?  Well, at least part of the answer lies in stability.<br>
<br>
Assume that Hussein had been removed from power during Desert Storm.  Iraq is held together primarily out of fear of Hussein, as I understand it.  The people of Iraq are not traditionally alligned.  Think of them as a variety of tribes that do not get along very well.<br>
<br>
Without Hussein, either someone else -- equally ruthless -- would have assumed control of the country, or the country would have reverted to chaos.<br>
<br>
Now consider Iraq's enemy, Iran.  Iraq and Iran were at war for years.  The U.S. supported Iraq (Hussein) because of our difficulties with Iran.  Basically, even through conflict, a certain balance was found.<br>
<br>
If you neutralize Iraq, the fear is that Iran's influence would grow dramatically.  Given the anti-American flavor of that influence, this was not considered a good thing.<br>
<br>
---<br>
<br>
Something else to think about...  The U.S. consumes the worlds resources at a rate far out of line with the number of people here.  We have absolutely no right to talk about resource conservation with other countries, because frankly, we're pigs.<br>
<br>
As I understand it, Bin Laden sees the American culture as decadent, greedy and godless.  He would like to see us toppled.<br>
<br>
Decreasing stability is an important step in that process.  Decreasing our foreign influence is also very important.<br>
<br>
---<br>
<br>
Consider something else.  Consider what the situation has to be to produce so many people who hate so badly that they would kill thousands of people.<br>
<br>
---<br>
<br>
What can we do?  Well, I have some comments, but I can't make them without adding my own political agenda into the mix, so I'm not going to make them.<br>
<br>
But here's a hint: drilling more wells in Alaska is NOT the key.  What are alternatives to burning the oil faster?<br>
<br>
---<br>
<br>
For more perspective, I'm going to recommend a movie I just saw over the weekend.  It's out on DVD.  Yes, it's just a movie, and I'm sure not all the facts are straight.  But it offers a glimpse into views from &quot;the other side&quot; in Iraq.<br>
<br>
The movie is called &quot;Three Kings&quot; with George Clooney, Mark Wahlberg and Ice Cube.  Copyright 1999, Warner Bros.<br>
<br>
Imagine how you would feel about Americans if you saw this situation in person, if it was a part of your real life.<br>
<br>
Would make a little poaching in Fear or training in KC look pretty darned minor.<br>

Also, I'll just throw this one piece in there.  There are many Muslim countries that ask the US for support.  Either financially or in some other form, but yet they, such as Saudi, have a book that is mandatory to teach in their schools.  In that book they say to support their Muslim brothers and that ALL ELSE are enemies.  Not just the US, but ALL countries not Muslim.  USB's goal isn't just to take downt he US, but all non-Muslim countries and insert a Muslim government.  That is written in his handbook used in training his followers.  Reuters even published something about it once since the book was discovered in England after an arrest on one of his followers a few years back. <p>Kilamdar - 12oN<BR>

<br>
If you don't think Saddam et all is evil, then I'm assuming you find nothing wrong with rapee/murder. (2 ee's due to filter)<br>
<br>
IMO America's Crime's Against the World are all about: not finishing the job.<br>
<br>
We have the ability to end a war by force, and we elect not to. We listen to people begging for the life of innocents. However, many time's these &quot;innocents&quot; are the same people that turn around and attack American in one form or another. Which causes us to retaliate, and once again we listen to the begging and stop. Then are provoked again, etc....<br>
<br>
America also believe's in the ability to starve it's enemies. Starving your enemie's also equate's to starving people that couldn't give a sh1t about America, then turn to hating it. (EX.) If Canada remained the same nice people they are, but found America to be doing wrong and somehow forced the US into poverty, growing up all you would hear about is how you are hungry because of Canada. After awhile, you are conditioned into hating Canada for making you hungry. <br>
<br>
Ya know what's the worse part of this, when Billy Bob American drives accross the border and kills 100 Shoe Sales Men, because they are Canadian. WTF did they have to do with starving Americans? Nothing, but the American didn't know any better, because that is what he was taught... to hate all Canadian's for his suffering.<br>
<br>
Don't think this happens? Let's look at Afghanastan, 15ish year's ago, the USSR was at war with Afghanastan. Well, as the anti Communist country we are, we went to aid the Afghan's. The Afghan people were like &quot;Woot!&quot;, and we lent enough help to get rid of the Soviets. So here you have a half destroyed country, and you find out your friends the American's were only using you for their own purpose and left you without any help to rebuild all that was lost. In perspective it's like, having someone you don't care for, come help you in a time of need, pretending to be a friend and looking out for you. Then afterwards finding out, your 'new friend' didn't give 2 sh1ts about you or your starving family, and just wanted to defeat a greater enemy. You ask for a spare dollar, and the person just laughs at you. You'd be a bit sour as well.<br>
<br>
<br>
Looking back on what I've written, it seems I have a negative view on America, which is far from the truth. I value all my rights, and I'd rather live here with the problems I see, then anywhere else. I just feel America's greatest fault in the world is the inability, and/or fear of committing. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub95.ezboard.com/ushaethius.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Shaethius</A> at: 11/1/01 1:45:31 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#f7f7f7><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub95.ezboard.com/uhiraghm.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Hiraghm</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Amiable Poster</span><br>  Posts: 317<br> <font color=#778899>(11/1/01 1:45:09 pm)</font><br>    <BR><img src=http://members.home.com/jdwilliams2/data/Aldrinshroom1.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: America's Crimes Against the World</span><hr size=1> &quot;Three Kings&quot; is a remake of the John Ford classic, &quot;Three Godfathers&quot; with John Wayne and Harry Carey Jr. brought up to date and set in a contemporary situation.<br>

Israel and...well, everyone else in the middle East don't get on.<br>
They (Arab muslims) see Israel (Juadism) as stealing their holy homeland.<br>
Israel see the Palestinians as squatting on their holy homeland.<br>
<br>
Comes down to an old fashioned human fight over who has the bigger imaginary friend.<br>
The majority of Israel's original support came from rich american Jews and american foreign policy has supported Israel, as well as giving them lots of modern wepons, with which they have trounced various Arab nations in various wars.<br>
<br>
And it's quite quite irreconcilable, because when you base something on faith, it rules out any reasoned debate.  So they fight over religion, and then you see America saying that they too have a god on their side, and you realise that it's all just hilariously @#%$ up and playing games is a nice way to get away from it all.<br>
<br>
In the case of the terrorists, pretty much every extreme version of relgion comes with a &quot;you must wipe out the infidels (everyone else)&quot; clause.<br>
<br>

Great !  some good insights and no one trying to rile anybody yet. History is no matter what we may try to do , sadly repeating the old and never changing course ofuncontrollability that it has always had. We have been blssed in that for a speciific amount of years we have had this relative stability since world war II. at least as far as the mainland United States goes.<br>
<br>
Problem is , we have maintained that stability at great cost in garnering the enmity of many countries we have felt it was necessary to run roughshod over to preserve our standard of living and economic growth.<br>
<br>
Factor in human nature and tendency to be jealouse of those with more than you. We are the big kid on the block and some people just hate us for it. add religion. <br>
<br>
I am sad to say I know at least two people in the Military whom espouse fundamental Christian views and have told me they belive these are the &quot; End times &quot; and they are living and carrying out the &quot; Lord's &quot; will as regards the Bibical prophesies in Revelations. <br>
<br>
I feel that is not a very sound basis to do anything in regards to military actions or as a proper attitude to dealing with othesr but let's face it. The middle eastern extremists have decided to carry out a Holy War and are planning on thier own prophetic situation. Ironically , it seems that extremeists on both sides of this issue are in a state of extreme agitation and any ture attempt at dialogue and  finding some form of agreement are at a standstill as the ardent ferver and need to act out militraily hols sway.<br>
<br>
Like it or not these people whom perpetrated 9/11 want nothing less the complete extermination of anyone opposed to them. Sadly they must be met with extreme predjudice.<br>
<br>
It has been said that each new war is fought with the weapons and strategy of the preceding one. I see this scenario enfolding now. No platitudes but two wrongs do not make a right. <br>
<br>
We are struggeling to find the right way to handle this situation and as histroy has shown there is no right way . so what will the future portend ? i beleive that we will cause the destabilzation of Pakistan. They have an unknown though small number of Nukes resdy to deliver. Now , do you think out military is going to let the extremists get thier hand son those nukes ?<br>
<br>
how could we best eradicate that threat short of some all out Massive and as of yet strategically not feasable ground invasion. But let us assume for one minute that these bombs were all in one  place. Could a &quot;delta Force &quot; type of operation have any chance os suceeding and getting all the Bombs and rendering them unusable as nuclear bombs ? Not likelt. I predict the use of tactucal nuclear weapons such as the nuetron bomb. If I am not mistaken, this weapon is fissle in only the high level radiation yields such as Gamma radiation and higher whisch only have a half life of a few hours. I beleive these weapons only Cook everyine and do minimal damage to structures and cause very brief amounts of residual airborne radioactive cintaminents. I am oppsd to ant usage of nuclear weaponry because if they are used the majority of people world wide not undertsanding the technology will only know we dropped 'The bomb&quot;<br>
 again. We lose the Pcychological war and guess what? That is the main weapon availae to the Extremists ! They have already sent a message to thewestern military powers that , no matter how sophisticated our military technology they can and will continue to strike out at our population centers and that the military is helpless to contrvene in our defense .<br>
 On the hme front the real war is just beginning . I recommend the second Book in Bruce Catton's Civil war trilogy, &quot; terrible swift Sword &quot; or just read the Chapter entitled  &quot; Remorseless revolutionary struggle :&quot;yep instead of imposing harse realities and loss of personal freedoms on the extremeists it is we the citizens of the US   that will lose<br>
 freedoms. And again this is another goal of the Extreme movement ! They get us to do it for them and they  do not even have an  ivading army to impose thier will on us ! They let us do it to ourselves !<br>
<br>
Sorry but histroy suggests that a major world wide Military confrontation is imminent and it will start as a eastern asian regional conflidt as we see enfolding and becoem a major confriontation between the bigger more traditional powers in the region. gte used to it no one foresaw that a minor Bombardment os a non significant Military fortress in a small southern port  would lead to four years of toatl war on the mainland US. or that the assasination of  a minor relative of a ruling and aging dynasty in a small radical republic by an obscure anrachist would lead to teh greatest slaughter in the last cebtury. Foolowed by an even more encompassing war a mere 25 years later. I am not being very positive here but this is not only a clash of religious belife and economic disparity it is mankind bowing to the inevitable reality. We cannot control our own impulses nor our own Destiny ! Jehm<br>

PS i cannot type nor spell LOL sorry<br>

We had two choices at that point side with Israel or with the arabic and persian nations. <br>
  Israel made that choice easy when they said &quot; we do not admit to having a nuclear device but if we did it would be aimed at the Soviet Union as well as those aggressor nations who would destroy Israel&quot;.  We were forced at that point to side with Israel as we couldn't believe that the former Soviet Union would Idly sit by with their cities being nuked and not take a shot at us, being then ideologically opposites.  The reasons for our siding with Israel was fairly well known amongst all parties involved including the Islamic fundamentalists and the majority of terrorist groups within the middle east, this didnt make them happy but they understood our rational. Primarily because of this and the fact that no one wanted WWIII they kept their activities against the U.S. interests to overseas targets.<br>
  Now we come to desert storm, this happened to piss off one very wealthy and withing the Islamic world influential individual for several reasons.<br>
    1. U.S. involved with the war on Iraq, whereas he was asked not to involve himself... This wounded his pride.<br>
    2. U.S. (Infidel) troops in the holyland fighting against an Islamic nation..... this wounded his sense of religious righteousness.<br>
    3. U.S. reinstating the royal family in Kuwait, which was natorious in that part of the world for giving preference to foriegn workers in the oil fields (cheaper labor)...... This wounded his sense of nationalism<br>
  Usama Bin Ladin then decided to test the resolve of the U.S. government and peoples in a series of terrorist strikes on our embassies and military targets, his getting away with basically a &quot;Bad boy&quot; only further bolstered his resolve to do something more against the Satan America. I do not assign nor should anyone blame to any one particular elected official, because of political infighting all had a share of the blame. <br>
  His attack on the World trade center on Sept 11, was to show the world that we were a morally, religiously, and militarily weak nation which would fold after a truly horrific attack, and he was partially right. We were somewhat weak but only in that we didnt have a national sense of purpose which soon to his dismay he will find out like the Japanese did prior to WWII that when aroused we are not paper tigers, but unfortunatly vicious Dragons.<br>
 As for ground troops being unable to do anything effective, using the Russians as a lesson, you must remember there is a difference both strategically and tactically here. Strategically there will be no large amounts of Aid from any superpower and Iran, and Iraq have their own problems right now. also we wont give a rats ass if they controll the desert, all we have to do is make sure food doesnt reach them. Tactically the difference is that we are a nation reared on guerilla war, beginning with the revolutionary war and we have more than enough trained spec. forces teams to make life miserable for them untill eventual erosion of his logistical base and surrender.<br>

What a rash assumption you made.  And an incorrect one.  In fact, the movie didn't really tell me anything I didn't already know, it just presented a very small amount of it in a different light that helped bring things home.<br>

<br>
Where is technology leading? <br>
<br>
The Globe and Mail, [edited], January 22, 1987, reported the following from a speech by Ivan L. Head, president of the International Development Research Centre: <br>
<br>
“It is reliably estimated that one out of every four scientists and technologists in the world engaged in research and development is working on weapons. . . . At 1986 rates, the expenditure is more than $1.5-million a minute. . . . Are we all more secure as a result of this kind of technological emphasis? The nuclear arsenals possessed by the superpowers contain the explosive force of all the munitions expended by all the combatants in all of the Second World War—times 6,000. Six thousand Second World Wars. Since 1945, there have been less than seven weeks when the world has been free of military activity. There have been more than 150 wars of an international or a civil nature, which are estimated to have claimed 19.3 million lives, most of them as the result of the efficient new technologies that have emerged in this era of the United Nations.”<br>
<br>
Let's jump to religion for a bit:<br>
<br>
Formosus (891-96): “Nine months after his death, Formosus’ body was disinterred from the [edited] crypt and arraigned for trial before a [edited] council, at which Stephen presided. The deceased [edited] was accused of inordinate ambition for the [edited] office and all his acts were declared invalid. . . . The corpse was stripped of [edited] robes; the fingers of the right hand were amputated.”—New [edited] Encyclopedia.<br>
<br>
Stephen VI (896-97): “Within a few months [of the trial of Formosus’ corpse] a violent reaction ended the [edited] of [edited] Stephen; he was deprived of the [edited] insignia, imprisoned, and strangled.”—New [edited] Encyclopedia.<br>
<br>
Sergius III (904-11): “His two immediate predecessors . . . were strangled in prison. . . . In [edited] he was supported by the Theophylactus family, by one of whose daughters, Marozia, he is supposed to have had a son.”—New [edited] Encyclopedia.<br>
<br>
Stephen VII (928-31): “In the last years of his [edited], [edited] John X . . . had incurred the wrath of Marozia, the Donna Senatrix of [edited], and had been imprisoned and assassinated. Marozia then conferred the papacy on [edited] Leo VI, who died after 6 1/2 months in office. Stephen VII succeeded him, probably through the influence of Marozia. . . . During his 2 years as [edited], he was powerless under the domination of Marozia.”—New [edited] Encyclopedia.<br>
<br>
John XI (931-35): “Upon the death of Stephen VII . . . , Marozia, of the House of Theophylactus, obtained the [edited] for her son John, a youth in his early 20s. . . . As [edited], John was dominated by his mother.”—New [edited] Encyclopedia.<br>
<br>
John XII (955-64): “He was hardly eighteen, and contemporary reports agree about his disinterest in spiritual things, addiction to boorish pleasures, and uninhibitedly debauched life.”—The [edited] Dictionary of [edited].<br>
<br>
Benedict IX (1032-44; 1045; 1047-4<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START 8) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/glasses.gif ALT="8)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> : “He was notorious for selling the [edited] to his godfather and then subsequently reclaiming the office twice.”—The New Encyclopædia Britannica.<br>
<br>
Guenter Lewy writes in his book The [edited] Church and [edited]: “Had [edited] from the start adhered to a policy of resolute opposition to the [edited] regime, world history might well have taken a different course. Even if this struggle had ultimately failed to defeat Hitler and prevent all of his many crimes, it would in this view have raised the moral prestige of the Church immeasurably. The human cost of such resistance would undeniably have been great, but these sacrifices would have been made for the greatest of all causes. With the home front unreliable, Hitler might not have dared going to war and literally millions of lives would have been saved. . . . When thousands of [edited] anti-[edited] were tortured to death in Hitler’s concentration camps, when the [edited] intelligentsia was slaughtered, when hundreds of thousands of [edited] died as a result of being treated as [edited] [subhumans], and when 6,000,000 human beings were murdered for being ‘non-[edited],’ [edited] Church officials in [edited] bolstered the regime perpetrating these crimes. The [edited] in [edited], the spiritual head and supreme moral teacher of the [edited] Church, remained silent.”—Pages 320, 341.<br>
<br>
Thus, rather than following the example of faithful Peter, these and other [edited] were an evil influence. They allowed bloodguilt and spiritual and physical fornication, as well as a Jezebel influence, to corrupt the church they ruled.<br>
<br>
Even now, support for Babylonish religion is drying up in many places, indicating what will happen when “the kings from the rising of the sun” make their attack.<br>
<br>
“A nationwide survey found that 75 per cent of those who live in municipal areas of [edited] do not go to [edited] temples to listen to sermons at all, while the number in the countryside who visit the temples is steadily declining to about fifty per cent.”—[edited] Post, September 7, 1987, page 4.<br>
<br>
“The magic has gone out of [edited] in the land, [edited], where it was founded some two millennia ago. . . . Deprived of the magical devices by which they and their predecessors used to gain large followings, members of the priesthood find themselves without successors, facing the virtual extinction of [edited] as an organized faith on the mainland.”—The [edited] Journal and Constitution, September 12, 1982, page 36-A.<br>
<br>
“[edited] has one of the world’s largest concentrations of foreign missionaries, nearly 5,200, yet . . . less than 1% of the population is [edited]. . . . A [edited] priest working here since the 1950s . . . believes that ‘the day of the foreign missionary in [edited] is finished.’”—The Wall Street Journal, July 9, 1986, page 1.<br>
<br>
In [edited] during the past three decades, “nearly 2,000 of the 16,000 [edited] churches have been closed because of disuse. Attendance has fallen to among the lowest of avowedly [edited] countries. . . . ‘It is not now the case that [edited] is a [edited] country,’ [the edited] said.”—The [edited] Times, May 11, 1987, page A4.<br>
<br>
“After hours of heated debate, [edited] Parliament approved legislation today, enabling the [edited] Government to take over huge estates held by the [edited] [edited] Church . . . Moreover, the law gives nonclerics control of church councils and committees responsible for the administration of prized church investments including hotels, marble quarries and office blocks.”—The [edited] Times, April 4, 1987, page 3.<br>
<br>
“[edited] can furnish the good-will, the dynamic behind the league [of nations], and so change the treaty from a scrap of paper into an instrument of the kingdom of God.”—The [edited] Century, [edited], June 19, 1919, page 15.<br>
<br>
“The League of Nations idea is the extension to international relationships of the idea of the Kingdom of God as a world order of good will. . . . It is the thing all [edited] pray for when they say, ‘Thy Kingdom come.’”—The [edited] Century, [edited], September 25, 1919, page 7.<br>
<br>
“The Cement of the League of Nations is the Blood of [edited].”—Dr. Frank Crane, [edited] minister, [edited].<br>
<br>
“The [National] Council [of [edited] Churches] supports the Covenant [of the League of Nations] as the only political instrument now available by which the Spirit of [edited] may find wider scope in practical application to the affairs of nations.”—The Congregationalist and Advance, [edited], November 6, 1919, page 642.<br>
<br>
“The conference calls upon all [edited] to uphold and promote highly the ideals [of the League of Nations] as expressed by the idea of God the Father and God’s earthly children.”—The [edited] Church, [edited].<br>
<br>
“When we consider the aspirations, the possibilities and the resolutions of this agreement, we see that it contains the heart of the teachings of [edited]: The Kingdom of God and his righteousness . . . It is nothing less than that.”—Sermon by the [edited] of [edited] at the opening of the League of Nations Assembly in [edited], December 3, 1922.<br>
<br>
“The League of Nations Association in this country has the same holy right as any humanitarian missionary society, because she is at present the most effective agency of the rule of [edited] as the Prince of peace among the nations.”—Dr. Garvie, [edited] minister, [edited].<br>
<br>
Funny how many countries and organizations claim: &quot;In God We Trust.&quot; or &quot;God bless [edited]&quot;. Anyone know which scripture is found in front of the United Nations Headquarters? Let's see what those swords are being beaten into:<br>
<br>
Though 1986 was proclaimed by the UN to be the International Year of Peace, the suicidal armaments race escalated. World Military and Social Expenditures 1986 supplies these sobering details:<br>
<br>
In 1986 global military expenditures reached $900 thousand million.<br>
<br>
One hour’s global military expenditure would suffice to immunize the 3.5 million that die annually from preventable infectious disease.<br>
<br>
Worldwide, one person in five lives in gnawing poverty. All these starving people could be fed for one year at the cost of what the world spends for armaments in two days.<br>
<br>
The explosive energy in the world’s stockpile of nuclear weapons is 160,000,000 times greater than that of the [edited] explosion.<br>
<br>
Today a nuclear bomb can be delivered having an explosive power more than 500 times as powerful as the bomb dropped on [edited] in 1945.<br>
<br>
Today’s nuclear arsenals contain the equivalent of more than one million [edited]. They represent 2,700 times the explosive energy released in World War II, when 38 million people died.<br>
<br>
Wars have become more frequent and more deadly. War deaths totaled 4.4 million in the 18th century, 8.3 million in the 19th century, 98.8 million in 86 years of the 20th century. Since the 18th century, war deaths have increased more than six times faster than the world’s population. There have been ten times as many deaths per war in the 20th century as in the 19th.<br>
<br>
Again, most of these quotes and statistics are from 1989 or further. So add at least twelve years of technology, bloodshed, and such. Most of this in the name of God.<br>
<br>
I played the editing game to avoid offending anyone. Aren't we glad that our newspapers and television news don't have to do the same?<br>
<br>
I guess my point in providing all of this information is to get people thinking. Next time we sing &quot;God Bless [edited]&quot;, let's think about what we're asking God to bless.<br>
<br>
Love,<br>
<br>

I once wrote a paper in highschool under the pseudonym Dr. Anita Brane, in response to the hysterical fears of nuclear energy, explaining the output of radiation from the sun, and it's relative hazard when compared to our nuclear power plants/weapons. The point that some liberals cannot seem to understand is that having a gun is not the same as shooting a gun, is not the same as machine-gunning a shopping mall. That we possess this much power is hardly surprising. Do you really think a Boeing passenger plane from 1945 could compete with a 767 in terms of power output, passenger capacity, comfort or range? And the munitions possessed by either side in WWII exceeded the entire world's weapons capability of 1674; that possessed by both sides exceeded the world's weapons capability of 1913. So what?<br>

Where do these people die? Cleveland? Omaha? No.. in backwards third world shitholes where they won't stop breeding and apparently can't learn basic human sanitation.<br>
Those of us in the developed world are under no obligation to pick up the slack for those third worlders. The military expenditure, which also goes for the pay of soldiers (thus employing them and enabling them to pay for their own immunizations) is necessary to ensure the security of those of us who *have* built civilization out of wilderness. We and our posterity have the right to the fruits of our labors and of our forefathers'. <br>
You speak of mottos: the motto of the Strategic Air Command, whose officers have at their fingertips more destructive power than any humans have ever controlled is:<br>
Peace is our Profession.<br>
And they did a damned fine job. Not only did their work help ensure the fall of the Soviet Union, but theirs was a guardianship of the peace of half a century. (and nowhere in history was there ever a period of peace where there wasn't some fighting of some kind somewhere.)<br>
And the military expenditures are much higher than WWII. It's much cheaper to drop a dumb bomb from 25,000 feet with a Norden bombsite than to use electronically guided munitions designed to minimize collateral damage. Sure, we could fight the Afghans on the cheap... but a lot more of them would die for it.<br>
You threw a lot of quotes from 1980s gobbledygook (and I remember the 1970s Club of Rome's reports that were so horrifically inaccurate and were instrumental in that ballless wonder almost destroying the U.S. from the White House) here's one from a bit further back:<br>

<br>
Where did I state that your info was from a movie?  What were my words?  (if you're going to use a movie as a basis for some of your believes or ideals)<br>
<br>
Please do not talk about being rash with me when you start taking my words, switch them around, and take them out of context yourself.  You feel insulted?  At most I took your words out of context, but I didn't also switch any of them around.  These next two quotes from you show something you believe, or I hope you do since you wrote them.  Read them and maybe you'll see where my words came from.  <br>
<br>
**the movie didn't really tell me anything I didn't already know, it just presented a very small amount of it in a different light that helped bring things home.***<br>
***and I'm sure not all the facts are straight. But it offers a glimpse into views from &quot;the other side&quot; in Iraq.***<br>
<br>
<br>
On a side note, I have to admit I for once agree with something Hiraghm has pointed to.  You have to be careful with your quotes or stats from books, speeches, etc.  Anything can be twisted or taken out to make the end product sound the way the publisher wanted it to.  I'm not saying anyone here has done this yet, but I've seen it done on other boards, and that is to use some fanatic type person/organization as a resource.  Read everything carefully and remember that mostly this is all opinions no matter how educated the person writing it is.  There are so many little things that we'll never know about that affected why something was or wasn't done in the past, such as why we stopped when we did in Desert Shield/Storm.  It's always hard to see the larger picture and how it will/would affect the fugure.<br>

You know why they breed? Because they know that alot of the kids will die due to disease and such. And as they dont have the wellfare system and pension funds etc that are existing in the developed world, they will need someone to support them when they get old. and what you call basic human sanitation... basic for you. and me. In these countries alot of people dont even know what a bacteria is. Alot of them cant read. How do you know about 'decent sanitation'? youve been in school. Alot of these people have not. Your parrents have tought you since you were a child, since they were schooled as well. Alot of these people dont have access to clean water. How would you be able to cope if your watertap suddenly stopped to work and have to bathe in the nearby river? Alot of these people have only seen war. <br>
<br>
You have an extremely egocentric world view mate, but that is a common problem when discussing issues like this. We internalise things around us and things we learn so it becomes a part of us, and see it as a rudimentary thing that everyone should know. it is not.<br>
<br>
Ps Dont you find it interesting that bin ladin troops are using AMERICAN made stingers (amongst others) against american troops? wonder how he got them... US shipped them to Afghanistan when they were at war with the Soviet union. They didnt like the regime in the country then either, but chose to neglect it. My enemies enemy is my friend was the word. Now that has changed and the ex friend is the enemy, as the former friend continued to evolve, and could start to concentrate on a new enemy, as their former enemy (soviet union) was out of the picture.<br>
<br>
A few years ago America was involved in an operation in Africa if you remember. Not that much was mentioned in the media about it, the pictures shown on TV was a dead american helicopter pilot dragged through the dirty streets.<br>
In this operation 7000 Africans died. That wasnt shown to much in media was it? <br>

In this operation US warplanes also mistakenly bombed a medical supply storage, built with the help of UN fundings. This storage house contained about half of the countries medical supplies. It was calculated that 10 to 20k people died indirectly because of this as they didnt get the medicine they needed.<br>
<br>
An investigation was started by the UN on this incident, but it was vetoed by the US.<br>

All countries tries to affect the world in a way that is beneficial to them. Every country does it. And as America is a very dominant country with a big flourishing economy it has alot of interests to take care of. Nothing strange about that. Just dont get into the illusion that US is all about helping the world. Its no 1 priority is to guard its own interests, and alot of the actions to achieve that isnt pretty, and is therefore hidden to the public. Obvious to me.<br>
<br>
Now you can go ahead and flame me and misquote me, i dont care.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#f7f7f7><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub95.ezboard.com/uthinn.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Thinn</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Scowling Poster</span><br>  Posts: 4<br> <font color=#778899>(11/1/01 7:35:29 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: America's Crimes Against the World</span><hr size=1> Quote brogunn<br>
=============================<br>
Strategically there will be no large amounts of Aid from any superpower and Iran, and Iraq have their own problems right now.<br>
==========================<br>
I guess the afghanistans can count out any help from the US this time as well...<br>
<br>
<br>
Quote again....<br>
=================================<br>
Tactically the difference is that we are a nation reared on guerilla war, beginning with the revolutionary war and we have more than enough trained spec. forces teams to make life miserable for them untill eventual erosion of his logistical base and surrender.<br>
=================================<br>
You mean as the US tried to do in Vietnam and as Spetznaz (soviet union elite forces) tried to do in Afghanistan? =)<br>
<br>
Us tried everything in Vietnam. They bombed bridges and thought food would not get through. VC made underwater passings (yea they got wet feet but hey.. =) ) They tried about everything yet they did not yield. US had air supperiority and bombed the @#%$ out of Vietnam. It didnt work.<br>
<br>
Finally the preassure from home made us to stop. To many americans had died, so they pulled back. And VC didnt do any terrorist acts like Bin ladin does. A few more terrorist deeds can make the public oppinion for Bush sway very swiftly.<br>
<br>
One of the problems in western society is that its to sensitive to disruption. Just think of what a few letters with anthrax can do. The entire western world talks about Anthrax! Terrorism is the poor mans weapon, but what what a weapon it is.<br>
<br>
Finally, i got to say this as well. In this and the former post i realise i sound very anti american, but im not. US actually act when they think something its wrong, and has the power to do so. In EU for an example, there tend to be to much talk before something is happening. Kudos to US for that, and im the first to admit that they are making lots of effort for the world. <br>
