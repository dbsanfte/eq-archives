The ground was already soggy to the point of hungrily swallowing up the boots of passing adventurers.  All was dead here.  All was dead in the Plains of Karana.<br>
   Well, perhaps not all.  There were still the occasional bandits, still desperately clinging to their way of life.  There were also many other nasty things creeping behind the thick wall of fog.<br>
   Jerick suddenly felt uncomfortable as he remembered a story about an unfortunate group who ventured here, only one came back...and missing alot of blood.  The paladin's nose began to itch.  How he longed to scratch it, but the rebreather blocked all attempts.  He couldn't wait for the rain to stop, maybe then he could rip the cursed thing from his face.  Maybe then he could breath something other than the same, recirculated air he had been taking in for what seemed like forever.<br>
   Miserably, he glanced to his two companions.  Rillin still seemed depressed about leaving his wife behind.  Arcturus was stone faced, as usual.  For someone Ardo adopted, Arcturus seems so much like his true son.  Always looking straight ahead, never revealing his thoughts, and rarely ever talking.<br>
   A stone bounced off of Jerick's gleaming helm, ripping him from his thoughts.  The three stopped, and through the fog a small, dark lump could barely be made out in from of them.<br>
   &quot;Oy!  What 'ave we 'ere?&quot;  came a gruff voice from the dark shape as it stomped closer.  He reached out a hand and gently stroked Rillen's robe.  &quot;Looks to me like a merchant and 'is escort.  Big mistake comin 'ere friend...big mistake.&quot;<br>
   Rillen, never turning his gaze from the dwarf, batted the hand away.  Arcturus simply gazed as well, weapon in hand (though when he drew it was a mystery, it seemed to simply appear in his grip).  Jerick gripped the hilt of the sword and drew it, the weapon sparked as lightning jumped along the length of the flawless blade.<br>
   &quot;So!  Tis a fight ye want then?&quot;  Asked the dwarf, seeming unconcerned.  &quot;Methinks ye should just toss down yer pretty weapons and any money ye may be carryin'.&quot;<br>
   &quot;Are you some kind of moron?&quot;  Arcturus finally spoke.<br>
   &quot;Hah!  What ye don't understand, pale one, is that there be about ten good men with gnomish muskets all pointin' at yer girly little faces.&quot;<br>
   Jerick flinched.  His eyes darted about, how could they possibly see them through this fog?  Arcturus and Rillen both stood calmly, studying the bandit.  Rillen shook his head.<br>
   &quot;Hes bluffing.  Look at his eyes.&quot;<br>
   Arcturus already seemed to know.  His copper eyes gazing deep into the soul of the little bandit.<br>
   &quot;Bluffing am I?&quot; grunted the dwarf.  &quot;I'll only ask ye one more time.&quot;<br>
   &quot;Why don't you just give them the order to fire?  Prove that they are there.&quot;  Arcturus replied, still not moving.<br>
   Sweat trickled along the outside of the dwarf's filthy rebreather.  Growling, he started to edge away.  Before he could put his foot down, a burst rang throughout the plains.  The dwarf took off, all the while shouting about how he was right.  Jerick took cover behind a long dead tree.  The other two scurried to a boulder.<br>
   Arcturus pulled out his shortened musket andloaded a small chamber in the back with a bottle of yellow liquid.  &quot;Well I'll be damned.  The little bastard was telling the truth.&quot;<br>
   Rillen shook his head once more.  &quot;These bandits aren't working with the dwarf.  As a matter of fact, they may be shooting at him as well.&quot;  They both listened, several shots were, indeed, being fired.<br>
   &quot;Jerick!  Are you hit?&quot;<br>
   A familiar voice responded not far to their right, &quot;I do not think I am their target.&quot;<br>
   Arcturus's voice lowered, the paladin could barely hear him.  &quot;How much closer to them do you think you can get?&quot;<br>
   The responding voice was almost inaudible.  &quot;There is a rock about ten paces ahead of me.  I may be able to fit behind it.&quot;<br>
   &quot;When you hear me fire, dash as fast as you can to that rock.&quot;  He turned to Rillen.  &quot;It will also be a good opportunity for you to employ your gift as well.&quot;<br>
   The wizard understood clearly.  He was going to fire a bolt just ahead of them.  It will have to be something light, he wont have time to conjure something better.  The bolt should give them some clue as to how far away the bandits are.<br>
   Arcturus slipped a small black ball into the barrel of his weapon.  The second he lept up shots fired from the distance ahead.  He fired his weapon and they stopped, likely taking cover from an unknown number of victims with weapons similar to theirs.  Flame danced from Rillen's findertips and massed into a large bolt ahead of him.  About two seconds later, it hit.  A low pitched thud followed by screams of pain.<br>
   &quot;From that distance, they should be right next to Jerick.&quot;  The wizard reasoned, winded from the use of his lifeforce.<br>
   Already, they could hear metal clashing.  The bright flashes of lightning striking could be seen not far ahead.  Ardo and Rillen lept from their cover to aid their friend.  Just fifteen paces ahead, Jerick slashed with his deadly weapon, cleaving one the bandits from the shoulder to the middle of the chest.  The sickening sound of blood girgling and bones breaking followed every swing.<br>
   Arcturus charged up just in time to catch one of six at the end of his weapon.  Rillen, scepter in hand, smashed the scull of another bandit, leaving a bloody dent in the unfortunate fellow's head.  Five down...but where was the sixth?<br>
   Another crunch came not far from the left.  The three followed it to find one stout looking dwarf standing over the corpse of a bandit.  An axe buried into his face.<br>
   &quot;Ha!  Shoot at Bruenhal will ye?&quot;  He spit then looked up at the three travelers.  &quot;Well, I suppose now since I saved yer lives that ye be owing me now.&quot;<br>
