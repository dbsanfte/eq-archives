<br>
She stood above his body, her eyes set a blaze. How dare anyone call her a half-breed? They didn't know, or did they? Yet, how could they know of her past? Of her present? Did they know her mother, father, sister, brother, were dead? No, they didn't. They probably didn't even know them. Especially those of her own generation or younger. <br>
<br>
She took a pitcher of beer off a near by customer's table and splashed it into the eyes of her interogater. Grinning, as she saw him roll over trying to protect himself. Too bad he couldn't get up, and actually fight though. T'was too weak to begin with. One punch had him doubling over, and one push he was on the floor.<br>
<br>
She knew everyone in the bar was watching, but that didn't stop her. They'd learn not to ask the wrong questions, they'd know not to call her a half-breed. Though she was, that didn't matter. Then they'd learn not to mess with a Fier'Dal with the Tier'Dal power fueling them.<br>
<br>
She began to chant. A small boy ran to the arms of his mother, as they heard the crash of lightning outside. Her chanting grew louder, as did the storm just beyond the door. The barkeep, sounded the guards to come and remove her from his bar, but they couldn't see a thing do to the rains that were beginning to flood the streets. <br>
<br>
As the wind speeds began to pick up, her eyes began to glow. Arms extended to the Gods, she cried out as the power surge was just beginning. Crash after crash was heard outside. They were all scared. Men began to try and take her down, but with one glance at them they went flying against a near by wall. <br>
<br>
Her cloak came and gathered about her with none of her actions to help it. <br>
<br>
&quot;Mother, I love you. Father, I hate you. Ravyn and MJ forgive me!&quot;<br>
<br>
With that a bolt of lightning hit the small bar. No one, knew who did it, because there were no witnesses. If there were, they had all died in the fire. The Guards claimed it were just a sign from the Gods. Too bad, it was just the confusions of an adolescent's past...<br>
<br>
<br>
Storm - 2<br>
---<br>
<br>
A roaring fire blazed in a cauldron before a figure in robes of browns and greens, their head and face covered by a hood of shadows. Bared within their right hand a beaten, leather bound book, by their left a simple leaf.<br>
<br>
Opening the beaten book they began to chant. As their voice filled the large darkened room the fire began to die down. Once the room was no longer filled by the fire's light, their left hand lingered over the cauldron.<br>
<br>
&quot;Mother Tunare, bring them to me,&quot; and with those few words the figure released the leaf into the cauldron. Within brief seconds a blaze of green erupted from the iron cast pit, filling the room with an eerie green aura and consuming the floor with a thick, yellow mist.<br>
<br>
Stepping closer to the transformed flames, the figure removed their hood, revealing a woman in her mid-40's. The light from the fire cast green shadows hiding the color in her features. <br>
<br>
As she reached for the pouch about her neck she began to chant. Her chanting grew louder as she removed the contents of the pouch.<br>
<br>
&quot;Sister Luna, come help me find your daughter...&quot;<br>
<br>
The woman dropped a dried leaf into the flame.<br>
<br>
&quot;Replicon, my brother-in-law, come help me find your daughter...&quot;<br>
<br>
In the same fashion as before she dropped a piece of blackened alloy into the flame.<br>
<br>
&quot;Ravyn, my nephew, come help me find your sister...&quot;<br>
<br>
She continues by dropping a Raven's feather into the flame.<br>
<br>
&quot;Mariijay, my niece, come help me find your sister...&quot;<br>
<br>
She releases a red ribbon into the flame.<br>
<br>
&quot;Goddess Tunare, come help me find your child...&quot;<br>
<br>
She drops an Evergreen Leaf into the Cauldron.<br>
<br>
Closing her eyes, she chants. The energy about her causes her robes and hair to fly in all directions. The green aura shifts to a calm, soothing white as 4 ghostly figures appear in the mist.<br>
<br>
/Sister/... <br>
<br>
&quot;Luna?&quot;<br>
<br>
/Aye, 'tis I. My daughter has run off I see./<br>
<br>
The woman opened her eyes and looked her deceased family in the pits of mist that made their eyes. Sighing she continues, &quot;Yes, much like you had in your younger, living years...&quot;<br>
<br>
/I know. Do you wish to know where she is?/<br>
<br>
&quot;Indeed.&quot;<br>
<br>
The little girl to the left of the woman ghost spoke, /Where there are storms you will find her./<br>
<br>
Then the boy, /Where there are fires you will find her./<br>
<br>
Then the man, /Where protection is needed, you will find her./<br>
<br>
Finally the woman, /In your heart you will find her./<br>
<br>
&quot;I don't understand...&quot;<br>
<br>
The man hugged his wife, /She is confused, she needs to travel. Her past is hard to handle, but she feels she must protect her family from ridicule./<br>
<br>
The boy piped in, /Her punishment to those who accuse, laugh, point, stare, is death./<br>
<br>
/Well, not neccesarily. She loves to have fun, you can't take her love of life away from her./ Adds the young girl.<br>
<br>
&quot;You can find her in bars causing mischief and havok. You can find her worshipping Bristlebane. You can sense her love, but feel her hate.&quot; Came a voice behind the woman.<br>
<br>
Turning sharply, the woman falls to her knees, &quot;Mother Tunare.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;She is my child, as much as Lunaria's though she's been taken by Bristlebane. Her freedom has led her to mischief, and has led you to your lack of seeing her. Yet, she will come home... When she is ready for the answers, for the truth, and direct story of her past, of her future, of her path... She will come... or /they/ will lead her home. Though I've lost her to Bristlebane you have not lost her, never shall you. She'll come home...&quot;<br>
<br>
~~~<br>
<br>
Dyuio sat up sharply, sweat pouring from her pores. She looked about, no Cauldron, no spirits, no Tunare. /Still no Dahnyella.../ she thought.<br>
<br>
Sighing, she forced herself out of bed and walked to her wash table. Washing her face, she thought back to her dream. It felt so real. Wasn't it though? Looking up at the mirror right above the wash bowl, she saw it change. Swirling and twisting as lightning crashed outside, she began to see the words appear...<br>
<br>
She'll be home...<br>
<br>
<br>
Storm - 3<br>
---<br>
<br>
Dahnyella arose to the light pouring in frantically through her rented room's window. Groaning, she pulled her Bear Skin blanket over her head and tried desperately to will sleep back to her.<br>
<br>
Precious seconds later, the couple in the room beside her started fighting. She could hear the muffled voice of a man ranting, and a woman's cries. Things were starting to get thrown as the man's anger grew. Thudding, breaking, and shattering on the conjoint wall with Dahyella's very own room. /Isn't anybody going to stop them?/ <br>
<br>
She tried to cover her ears with the pillow the Inn had provided her, but it didn't work, because just then she heard the sound of a sword being unsheathed.<br>
<br>
&quot;Son of a bitch,&quot; Dahnyella threw her blanket off of herself, and stormed into the room beside her. She stood in the door way a second, waiting for just the right moment.<br>
<br>
&quot;Damn it, Woman! Listen to me for a change would yeh!? Maybe you'll listen to me if you were dead. Wouldn't ye... What in Rallos' name... &quot; The man began to feel a breeze upon his legs, his arms, his neck, his face. The 2 handed sword he held above his head began to waver as the breeze picked up. <br>
<br>
The man couldn't look around, because he was held in place by this unforseen wind. The woman on the other hand, brushed her hair away from her eyes, and glanced at the door. Before her stood a young woman, her eyes were glowing and focused on the sword, her fingers at her temples, and her mouth moving but no words coming out.<br>
<br>
As the winds picked up the woman pressed farther against the wall, still keeping an eye on the young lass at the door, and having her ears shut off to her husband's cursing.<br>
<br>
Suddenly a gust of wind erupted through the room, and swiped the sword right from the man's hands, sending it careening into the wall just inches next to the door way. <br>
<br>
&quot;What the...&quot; the man felt the wind begin to die, and he began to scan the room. Just as he was about to see Dahnyella, she unleashed a powerful round house kick to his jaw.<br>
<br>
The popping sound of his jaw disconnecting from his rather empty Barbaric skull, was pleasing and brought music to Dahnyella's ears. It was in perfect harmony with his screams of agony and pain.<br>
<br>
&quot;Quite the wimpy Warrior aren't we?&quot; Dahnyella asked sarcastically, summoning another gust of wind and slamming him into the wall. <br>
<br>
&quot;You bit...&quot;<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Dahyella chanted a few words, and held a hand to the floor, slowly vines began to encircle the man and held him tight to the floor. He was trying so hard to curse, but they came out as moans and groans of pain, anger, and resent towards her.<br>
<br>
&quot;Excuse me, but one who can not deal with such physical endeavours... Well, Hun, let me just say this. If I have you on your knees now. You have no right to be slapping around this woman, you swore on your life to protect. You're not really protecting her by throwing her about like a rag doll are ye?&quot; <br>
<br>
The man glowered, and Dahnyella stooped right next to him, sliding a hand around his throat, she whispered next to his ear, &quot;Pleasant dreams...&quot;<br>
<br>
With that she hit his pressure point sending him into a forgetful sleep. The woman gaped at her, &quot;Is he?&quot;<br>
<br>
Dahnyella shook her head, &quot;Just asleep, but when he wakes up he'll think you did all the damage, and trust me. He won't mess with ya again.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Thank ye.&quot;<br>
<br>
Dahnyella nodded as she peered out the window the looked back to the woman assessing her tired, features, &quot;Looks like you've had a rough morning.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Aye.&quot;<br>
<br>
Dahnyella slid an arm around the woman's shoulders, &quot;Let me get ye a drink in town. You can vent to me what's been happening. Hell he won't be up for a while.&quot;<br>
<br>
The woman grinned, &quot;Let's go.&quot;<br>
<br>
- - - <br>
<br>
Dyuio listened to her daughter, Harmonee, playing her Lute and singing in the living room as she prepared breakfast in the kitchen. Humming along to some of her daughter's original pieces she cut up fruits, and fried some eggs. <br>
<br>
She couldn't stop thinking about the constant dreams she was having. They were all about her niece, whom she missed dreadfully. While in her sleep it was as if she could feel every emotion Dahnyella had felt herself through out the day.<br>
<br>
She could remember one from just a few days ago. Dahnyella sat at a bar with a bunch of, she guessed friends, as she held a mug high and sang Ancient Drinking songs with them. She could feel her happiness, but she could also feel the pain that welled with inside her. Dyuio knew Dahnyella knew nothing about her past before age 4. She knew nothing of her mother, she knew little of her father. For all she knew was he was Dark, an Inkie. People knew this. Dahnyella didn't, and for some reason they just taunted her for it, like she knew it all already. She didn't though. It was something she needed to learn. She needed to come home.<br>
<br>
Dyuio sighed, closing her eyes she remebered what Tunare had said to her in her sleep. /If she doesn't on her own, they will lead her home.../<br>
<br>
Who was /they/? Who was possibly going to help her home? Who would know?<br>
<br>
Then she looked at the window, then at her daughter in the living room, &quot;She'll be home...&quot; <br>
<br>
<br>
Storm - 4<br>
---<br>
<br>
&quot;Can I get you anything, Lady?&quot;<br>
<br>
Dahnyella looked up with a seductive smile on her face, &quot;I'll take a glass of Elven Wine.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Sure thing,&quot; the Bartender smiled back, and readied her drink.<br>
<br>
As Dahnyella sat at the bar, she scanned the room. /Nice crowd.../ she thought. To her left was a Dwarf in old rustic, bronze armor, at the table in the back was a group of men and women discussing something highly important. Travellers? Guild members? Party members stopping for just a wee break? She began to cast her senses...<br>
<br>
&quot;Here you go, m'lady,&quot; Dahnyella looked up at the Bartender setting down the drink before her, &quot;That will be 3 silver.&quot;<br>
<br>
Dahnyella nodded and reached for her coin pouch, slightly annoyed her concentration got disrupted. Yet, what right did she have ease-dropping? <br>
<br>
Just as she had the money counted a young man came by and dropped the tab into the Bartender's hand, &quot;On me.&quot;<br>
<br>
The Bartender nodded, and went off to help his other customers. Dahnyella smiled warmly at the fellow, &quot;Thanks,&quot; she said as she took a sip from her glass.<br>
<br>
&quot;Anything for a lady,&quot; he said with a devilish grin on his face. She had to blush. Charming, she had to admit. He stood about 6 foot, sandy colored hair, and the deepest blue eyes you could imagine. Dahnyella could only sit and look at him in awe. Complete and utter awe, he was gorgeous to say the least.<br>
<br>
Dahnyella sat and just looked at him, and to her benefit he looked right back at least until...<br>
<br>
&quot;Hail, Talcos!&quot;<br>
<br>
Yeah, that. <br>
<br>
The man spun around to face his greeter, a smile spread across his face, &quot;Mercilles, friend, how are ye?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Quite fine. Speaking of fine, quite a glimmer in your eye at the moment,&quot; he glanced at Dahnyella, &quot;I can see why,&quot; he took Dahnyella's hand and kissed it, &quot;Mercilles.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Dahnyella,&quot; she smiled. Mercilles stood about 6'7&quot;, much taller than his friend, his skin was the color of chocolate, his hair and eyes even a deeper shade. <br>
<br>
&quot;Beautiful.&quot;<br>
<br>
Dahnyella blushed, &quot;Thanks.&quot;<br>
<br>
Mercilles grinned, then took the seat to her left. The one that remained open between her and the Dwarf. Then she grinned herself. This was going to be one long, fun, and interesting night.<br>
<br>
- - - <br>
<br>
Around 11PM the bar was packed. Most of the men surrounded her as she drank and told jokes, getting uproars out of every one of them. Then something nipped her senses. Something she couldn't put a finger on. She secretly cast her senses. To her acknowledgement the disturbance was only feet away. A young Dark Elf about her own age stalked into the bar. She had a cloak of deep black, that made her eyes scream. They were the brightest blue. Considering her skin tone, they stook out even more.<br>
<br>
&quot;Out of my way fool!&quot; She hissed as she shoved the dwarf that sat to the left of her off his stool.<br>
<br>
The Bartender looked at her, &quot;A glass of Elven Blood Wine,&quot; she said with out even acknowledging him.<br>
<br>
Dahnyella swiveled on her stool to look at her, she told Mercilles to move a bit then she connected... /Elven Blood Wine? How could you like that!/<br>
<br>
Then Dark Elf shot her a look, /If you have something to say to me say it out loud you fair skinned hooker,/ she shot back. <br>
<br>
Dahnyella glanced about her, and her anger rose a bit. /Why should I?/<br>
<br>
She grinned, /I have my reasons./<br>
<br>
Dahnyella emitted a low growl, &quot;Elven Blood Wine? That's sick! Why drink Elf Blood?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;If it's Wood Elven blood, why not?&quot;<br>
<br>
Dahnyella grabbed her staff, and pictured herself drawing runes of comfort upon her forehead. /Calm down.../<br>
<br>
&quot;Why don't you just sit there and drink your nasty wine, and leave me be. I don't want anything to do with you.&quot;<br>
<br>
The Dark Elf just drank her wine, as if Dahnyella wasn't even there. She decided to do the same. Turning back to talk with Talcos, she noticed he was turned and swiped a few platinum out of his pocket. Slipping the platinum into her coin pouch, she felt someone's eyes on her. Closing her eyes she knew exactally who it was, /Do you mind?/<br>
<br>
Dahnyella recieved no reply. In frustration she took a huge swig of her drink, and began drumming her fingers on her spell book.<br>
<br>
The Bartender set another drink in front of Dahnyella, how many was that now? No more likely how many BOTTLES had she gone through. She turned to Talcos starting on her new drink, and smiled. He flashed her a grin, and put an arm around her. <br>
<br>
As Talcos began telling jokes and stories, Dahnyella couldn't help but laugh. They weren't even funny, it was her first sign of verging to drunken stupor. <br>
<br>
As the drinks came, she drank 'em. She didn't want to just waste 'em. The tab was beginning to add up. <br>
<br>
Dahnyella kept laughing, but she was picking up on something, alarm? Maybe? She glanced over her shoulder to look at the Dark Elf secretly, as if she her just flipping her hair. It was from her alright, but why?<br>
<br>
Dahnyella carried on, then in mid-sip it happened. The Dark Elf had walked over removing Talcos' arms from her, and stood between them. She looked directly at him, &quot;Leave. There is nothing here for you.&quot;<br>
<br>
Talcos glanced over her, slightly confused, then he shot a look at Dahnyella. She was even confused, &quot;Hey! What do you think you're doing. You can't tell him what to do!&quot;<br>
<br>
She spun on Dahnyella fast as lightning, &quot;Listen, he is trying to take advantage of you, trying to get you drunk so he can have his way, steal your things, and then leave you on the floor of this bar the next day.&quot;<br>
<br>
Dahnyella couldn't believe it, he and her were just having a good time. He was being buying her a few, &quot;No he's not...&quot; Dahnyella could no longer feel his presence, she could but not strong, &quot;Is he?&quot; She glanced over the Dark Elf's shoulder, and he was heading for the door, &quot;I guess you were right.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;I always am.&quot;<br>
<br>
Dahnyella looked at her, &quot;What's your name?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Bellona.&quot;<br>
<br>
She had to giggle, &quot;Bellie.&quot;<br>
<br>
Bellona grumbled, &quot;And your's?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Dahnyella.&quot;<br>
<br>
Bellona just nodded, Dahnyella watched as she ordered a coffee and handed it to her, &quot;Drink.&quot;<br>
<br>
She gave an apprehensive glance, then drank away. &quot;Thank you, I guess.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Just keep drinking, then I'll take you home and you can rest some, you look as if you have not slept in days.&quot; <br>
<br>
She was right too. She hadn't. Either the sleep that is willed to her is disrupted, or she is too scared to actually sleep. Dahnyella just nodded, &quot;I definately feel that way.&quot;<br>
<br>
Dahnyella finally finished up the coffee, gathered up her spellbook and staff, and then they set off for the wee inn Bellona was currently residing in.<br>
<br>
The room was your normal. Bed, table and chairs, dresser, wash table. Much like the one's Dahnyella has spent her last couple years in. Apart from her Aunt Dyuio's home in Kelethin. <br>
<br>
Dahnyella shuddered a bit. Something was in the air, or someone. Dahnyella looked over at Bellona who was grabbing some spare clothes for her to borrow. Another chill ran up her spine, /What the.../<br>
<br>
&quot;Here you go,&quot; Bellona tossed Dahnyella an old black cloth tunic, and faded cloth pants, &quot;They'll do. We're the same size, so they should fit you well.&quot;<br>
<br>
Dahnyella looked at the clothes in her hands, then looked up at Bellona, &quot;I really can't thank you enough.&quot;<br>
<br>
Bellona raised a hand, &quot;There's no need to thank me at all,&quot; adding a warm smile at the end. &quot;I'll be back in 3 or 4 minutes, change and get comfortable. It's late, by time we got some sleep.&quot;<br>
<br>
Dahnyella watched as Bellona sauntered out of the room. /She's so nice, / she thought, as she removed her armor, and slipped into the tunic and pants. /Definately not what you'd expect from a Dark Elf./ <br>
<br>
/If you only knew your father.../<br>
<br>
Dahnyella looked around her cautiously, she moved slowly towards her staff and held it at the ready.<br>
<br>
Just then Bellona came back in and raised an eyebrow, &quot;Something going on?&quot;<br>
<br>
She shook her head, who was in her head? Bellona? No, she would have been able to tell. &quot;No, no... I-I just think I'm going bloody insane.&quot;<br>
<br>
Bellona frowned walked over and took her staff from her hands gingerly, &quot;You need to rest...&quot;<br>
<br>
She sighed, and shook her head. <br>
<br>
&quot;No?&quot;<br>
<br>
Dahnyella nodded, &quot;I can't sleep.&quot; She definately couldn't she was beginning to feel nauseous, there was some kind of energy enveloping the room, and she was beginning to lose her head. That voice kept coming back. Exerting lil blurbs.<br>
<br>
/You never actually knew him... Why aren't you home... Come home... I miss you... Your mother Relinquescat in Pace, as does your father... Ravyn and MJ died the same fate... But honor in their eyes.../<br>
<br>
Slowly tears began to run down her face, she was beginning to recognize the voice, &quot;Dyuio...&quot;<br>
<br>
Bellona was looking at her funny, &quot;Who?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;My Aunt,&quot; Dahnyella shook her head, &quot;She's trying to contact me.&quot;<br>
<br>
Dahnyella tapped a finger on her temple, and closed her eyes. With in a short, few seconds, Bellona placed her fingers on Dahnyella's temples moving her own out of the way, &quot;Trust me.&quot;<br>
<br>
Bellona began to rack through Dahnyella's memories, her hopes, her dreams. She felt her longings to know her Mother and Father, and felt her hatred towards her father and also felt the respect. She felt the fury when people called her a half-breed, then didn't care to give her clues to the past she couldn't remember. She began to see every nightmare, Dahnyella had ever had. The people she dreamt of, the questions that they aroused. <br>
<br>
Bellona's finger tips began to burn, she removed them as fast she could. Dahnyella opened her eyes, her cheeks wet with tears, &quot;I don't understand ANY of it! The nightmares, they confuse me. I don't even know those people!&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Calm down... Those aren't nightmares, they're visions,&quot; Bellona said rubbing her fingers. &quot;Sights from the past, the present and the future. Obviously you've mastered most of Divination, but didn't your Tutor teach you anything on Visions?&quot;<br>
<br>
Dahnyella shook her head, &quot;No, well, some, not much. Not when to recognize 'em.&quot;<br>
<br>
Bellona walked over to one of her bags, and grabbed a cup and flask. Dahnyella watched closely as she poured a Golden Liquid into the cup, and passed to her, &quot;Drink this.&quot;<br>
<br>
She looked at Bellona a bit, then nodded. She was opening up to Bellona, she knew so much, and there was something in the air that told her she was going to lead her to the answers.<br>
<br>
The substance ran down her throat and pitted in her stomach, &quot;Not-&quot; She was caught off by the pain that exploded in her stomach. &quot;My god...&quot; Dahnyella doubled over holding her stomach, and feeling her insides wrench.<br>
<br>
Bellona stands to the side, as Dahnyella glares at her. She knew it! She was up to something!<br>
<br>
&quot;What IS this stuff? Are you trying to poison me!?&quot;<br>
<br>
Just then a stream of yellow exploded from Dahyella's eyes, as she began to straighten her self the yellow swayed to an orange. The pain was gone, and so was the nausea. <br>
<br>
A whirlwind began to develop beneath Dahnyella's feet as the light faded to a peach. Picking her up off the ground, she levitated. Shooting questioning looks at Bellona. Her fears were vaquished for the moment, and any doubt she had in Bellona minutes before were exiled. She felt like a Goddess, like one of the great Oracles her Aunt Dyuio would tell her about when she was little.<br>
<br>
Bellona was grinning, and walking towards her, &quot;Welcome Child of Mischief.&quot;<br>
<br>
And for some unknown reason, Dahnyella knew EXACTALLY what she mean't.<br>
<br>
- - - <br>
<br>
Dyuio stood in the temple of Tunare speaking with one of the Oracles, &quot;I can sense her, I can feel everyone of her emotions, her fears...&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;So, you understand what Tunare's child is facing? You also know her calling.&quot;<br>
<br>
Dyuio nodded, &quot;She's found Mindles' daughter, Bellona.&quot;<br>
<br>
The Oracle raised an eyebrow, &quot;Has she?&quot;<br>
<br>
She closed her eyes and remembered the sensations and pain she felt, when she began to have visions about it. Dyuio nodded, &quot;Aye.&quot;<br>
<br>
The Oracle tensed as if Tunare was telling her something important, then she snapped her head towards the Temple entrance, &quot;Razerus, what brings you here.&quot;<br>
<br>
He came forth and stood beside the Oracle of Tunare known as Fraeya, then nodded towards Dyuio, &quot;I'm Razerus, Oracle of Bristlebane. As you know your niece is child of Bristlebane.&quot;<br>
<br>
Dyuio nodded, she knew this, but how she could be child of both Deities... Boggled her.<br>
<br>
The Oracles looked at her then at each other, then Razerus nodded. Fraeya looked at Dyuio, &quot;Come here.&quot;<br>
<br>
She hesitated and looked at the two, she was being asked to come up near the Oracles' fountain, but she eventually forced her legs to move.<br>
<br>
&quot;Look into the water,&quot; Razerus said.<br>
<br>
Dyuio looked at him then leaned over the fountain. The waters began to swirl, and she was no longer aware of being with in the temple. Just of the visions she saw in the water. She was carried back in time with waves of emotion with it. Her brother in law, Replicon. His training. His best friend Mindles, whom he was forced to leave when he realized hate wasn't what he believed in. Her Sister Lunaria, her love for this Dark Elf, whom she forced her society to accept. The children, her precious nieces and nephew. The battle... The waters blackened and she saw it... Replicon and Mindles were fighting. She could see people behind Mindles, they weren't an army but they were strong. They fought of Faydark's greatest. Lunaria rushed in to help Replicon but began to face off with a Tier' Dal woman. She heard as Mindles yelled at Replicon, about how strong he could have been had he stayed. Tears rolled down Dyuio's face as she saw Lunaria, duke out with the woman. They were both barely standing. Then it hit, a song of Discord sent her to the ground. Screaming. She was slain. Replicon was distracted as he watched his wife go down, and right then he followed. Replicon peered at Mindles, &quot;You were like my brother! You would have been just as powerful with the light!&quot; &quot;But who was just defeated?&quot; Replicon glowered at Mindles, &quot;You will see...&quot; Then Replicon passed over. The family that had just taken down the Guards on the Faydark fled to the city. Dyuio watched herself run and gather the children as her husband kissed her Good-Bye. She ringed the children and herself out of the Kelethin, and to Surefall Glade. Where she could be assured safety. She watched as she cried for her husband at night, and as she laughed as the children played in the yard. She saw Dahnyella maturing to a young woman, and completing quest after quest to become a high ranking Druid. She watched as Dahnyella hugged her Good-Bye and set off into the world to complete her training. She cried as the samethings happened to Mariijay and Ravyn. Ravyn and Mariijay were called back to the Faydark to become the first to renew the Faydark's Guards. She watched as the town was rebuilt, as she moved back home and Dahnyella returned in tears when she heard Mariijay and Ravyn died protecting Kelethin. Then she remembered as Dahnyella screamed deep in the night, as images haunted her. She saw the images she saw. The council, the prophecies, the children that would fill her life to come. She cried remembering the day Tunare and Bristlebane fought over her power, her faith, Bristlebane had won. She remembered waking not to see Dahnyella lying in her bed, but to have a note saying that she couldn't be a hassel to her family anymore, and she needed to learn. Dyuio cried as she remembered when Dahnyella came home and began causing havok, and caused her to cry. Yet, through it all she still loved her sister's daughter like her own. Then she remembered being told Dahnyella was a Child of Prophecy, and how she couldn't believe she was actually born to be Bristlebane's. She kept watching the water as she saw Bellona and Dahnyella talking about what would be to come. She realized they never talked of her past, it just seemed like they knew. She could sense Dahnyella feeling a connection from way back between the two, but when Dahnyella ported with her to Surefall she lost her memory. The images flashed back to the battle. She then saw little Dahnyella not even 3 watching her parents die from the brush. She saw how she watched Bellona, and how Bellona was going to cause her harm, but stopped and smiled. She sensed the bond between them, especially when Bellona let one tear roll down her cheek as she realized her parents had just killed Dahnyella's own. She looked back to Dahnyella, and saw tears rolling down her cheeks. &quot;Come on Dear! The time has come!&quot; Bellona looked at her mother and she ran with them. The face of Dahnyella to stick with her, and reappear later, with out her knowing. As for Dahnyella she'd never remember that night, until the Prophecies came true. Until... The Children of Prophecy rose. <br>
<br>
Dyuio pulled her eyes away, her cheeks were soaked from the floods of emotion. Fraeya and Razerus, looked her and in Unison, &quot;Keep on...&quot;<br>
<br>
She looked back into the waters, and watched her niece messing with men. Saw how she was the cause of all the storm outbreaks through out Norrath. She watched as Bellona gave her the drink, that identified her as Bristlebane's Prophecy. She saw images of Dahnyella jumping on bars and dancing, of her pick-pocketing, doing whatever she could to fend for herself, and to above all enjoy life. She saw as she was still loyal to the ways of the Druid, dropping by temples to worship Tunare and Bristlebane together. Unlike other Norrathians, Dahnyella was born to serve both Gods. Born from both Gods. Not only Replicon and Lunaria's daughter but the daughter of Tunare and Bristlebane themselves. She watched Dahnyella meet people from her dark past. The past she had forgotten. She watched as she slept and ate with the people who killed her Mother and Father, and destroyed their town. Deep down Dyuio knew there was good in that family, Dahnyella only saw the love with in it. It shielded the hate that fueled them. The waters began to glow a light green, then a deep black. Tears began to flood her eyes, as she saw all the different paths the future may go...<br>
<br>
<br>
Storm - 5<br>
---<br>
<br>
Her heart pounded as she crouched behind a near by tree, evoking nature's fire to her hands. Only feet away Telus, her dear friend Bellona's brother, taunted her...<br>
<br>
&quot;Come on out,&quot; he beckoned, &quot;If you really are the Child of Mischief, you'll be stronger than you look.&quot;<br>
<br>
Dahnyella listened as his foot steps came to a stop only a foot or so away from the tree. She'd been ignoring his crude comments for weeks, while Bellona had been gone on business. On normal circumstances, Bellona would have shut him up. Would have made him stop, but with out her Dahnyella could only turn the other ear. He always spoke of how weak she was. How she was nothing more than a Bar Rat, with no real family. Every time he brought up family her insides raged, but Bellona would catch onto her feelings, and calm them. <br>
<br>
&quot;Come on, Dahnyella. Too scared with out, Bellona? You can't live with MY family forever, don't you have your own?&quot;<br>
<br>
That was it, this time Bellona wasn't there to hold her back. Dahnyella spun out from behind the tree, and threw the all the evoked fire she could gather at him. Chanting louder and louder, as mana flew around her. Tousling her hair and throwing Telus back against a tree. <br>
<br>
He glared, as he tried to channel his energy, but couldn't gain his concentration.<br>
<br>
&quot;Ani di, laigh yul verigh,&quot; Dahnyella continued, and the wind around them picked up pinning Telus to the tree, and creating an invisble field protecting her from his spells.<br>
<br>
Telus finally began shouting over the whistling of the wind, &quot;You're a deity mutt! You're filth! I know your past! I know who you are! I know how you get your powers! If it weren't for that past you'd be nothing today! Powerless! I know who you are Dahnyella Sylvanblitz, bore to the mortals of Lunaria and Replicon Moonspeaker! Daughter of Tunare and Bristlebane themselves! Only by half your blood are you furied by the Tier' Dal! The other half Fier' Dal! I know how your host parents died! By my own parents!&quot; <br>
<br>
He kept screaming, but Dahnyella couldn't bare to listen much longer. She looked directly at Telus, as lightning clashed in her eyes. <br>
<br>
Telus looked towards the sky, and grinned as he heard the rumbles of Thunder, felt the wind pressing against his body, pinning him, &quot;You wouldn't dare kill your best friend, only friend's brother...&quot;<br>
<br>
She sauntered towards him, as lightning still flashed in her eyes, placing a hand on the earth roots entangled Telus, covering his mouth, and holding his body. Tears began to fall from her eyes, she kissed his cheek, &quot;You're right I wouldn't, but I will tell you this, Telus. You have no clue who I am. You can do all the research you want. Know one will know who I truly am until I find theanswers myself,&quot; thunder rumbled about them as she continued, &quot;And it doesn't matter whether you welcome me in your house or not. Your parents accept me, and so does Bellona. I'll see you at home.&quot; <br>
<br>
Dahnyella walked off as a storm broke out in the Commonlands. Telus was freed and watched her back as she disappeared into the rains, &quot;I think I've met my sister's and mine's match... Know how to turn them against each other.&quot;<br>
<br>
A grin tickled at his face, he knew...<br>
<br>
<br>
Storm - 6<br>
---<br>
<br>
Dahnyella sat at the meeting, not really paying attention, but glaring at Telus. He hadn't been letting up and he kept persisting she left their home. Bellona looked up at the 2 with a stern look, &quot;It would be nice if the two of you would pay attention.&quot;<br>
<br>
Dahnyella kept her eyes on Telus, and Telus on her, as they spoke in unison, &quot;We are.&quot;<br>
<br>
Bellona shook her head, and carried on with the meeting. Dahnyella could feel her glancing over at them every so often, but she didn't care. Everything Bellona was talking about, she'd already told her the night before. So, it really didn't matter if she paid attention or not.<br>
<br>
When the meeting had adjourned, Bellona walked over towards Dahnyella and Telus. She looked each of them up and down, then chose her words, &quot;What is going on between you two? It's almost as if, while I was gone you've declared war.&quot;<br>
<br>
Dahnyella looked at Bellona, then at Telus. She wanted to cry, there were too many emotions. For Bristlebane's sake, she didn't even know where half of her feelings were coming from. One minute she felt comfort with Bellona and Telus, the next she wanted to kill Telus but not hurt Bellona, and other times she just wanted to kiss Telus over and over and over. Then you shouldn't even get her started on their parents, that just brought brand new tears to her eyes.<br>
<br>
&quot;What if we have, Bellona?&quot; Dahnyella glanced at Bellona as Telus began to speak.<br>
<br>
Bellona looked so confused, and that's how Dahnyella felt. Turning on her heal, Dahnyella fled the room, and began to run. It was one of those times, she just couldn't stand it anymore. She just needed to run.<br>
<br>
She could hear Bellona's pleas for her to come back, but it was covered by the screaming and laughter in her head.<br>
<br>
<br>
Storm - 7<br>
---<br>
Dahnyella sat on the cot that Mindles had set in Bellona's room for her, writing notes in her Journal. So much had happened to her the last couple years of her life. She'd have come across almost every obstacle there is known to life thus far. Everything but death, and she hoped that would never have to be experienced.<br>
<br>
As her hand scrawled across the pages, she began to jot down questions that just popped into her head. Such as; Why exactally am I the Child of Mischief? Why does Telus always stare at me? What makes Bellie and I click? Why am I helping the Children like me kill other beings? Do I really need to get back at the world? Why can't I remember my past? Why does Mindles treat me like his own, and Yuhuza kind of push me away?<br>
<br>
Dahnyella's thoughts stopped as she dived for her staff, and crouched ready to take on whatever had entered the room. Her heart raced as she tried to focus the figure's image...<br>
<br>
&quot;By Innoruuk! Dahnyella! Be at ease!&quot;<br>
<br>
Dahnyella peered a little harder, and recognized the figure as Telus. She slowly got to her feet, not moving her own eyes from his. There was something different about his aura, something actually, normal. Clutching her staff she advanced forward a little ways, &quot;What do you want, Telus?&quot;<br>
<br>
Telus grinned a little, &quot;Do I have to want something whenever I come encounter with you?&quot;<br>
<br>
Fire flared in Dahnyella's eyes, filling the room with a nervous light. She began to glare as her staff's symbols began to glow a soft white, &quot;What are you trying to pull?&quot;<br>
<br>
His grin widened a bit, &quot;Nothing.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Then why are you wasting your breath?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;It's exhilarating seeing a Deity Mutt like yourself get mad. I mean, you get the slightest bit flustered and you're already sending extreme energy through out the room. Eh, it's a nice high.&quot;<br>
<br>
Dahnyella's jaw clenched, she HATED being called 'Deity Mutt,' absolutely HATED it. She closed her eyes and the room went pitch black. Taking in a deep breath, she felt Telus' finger tips on her temples. /What in Bristlebane's name is he DOING?/ Her eyes flew open sending waves of heat and light through out the room. Grabbing ahold of Telus' wrist she wrenched his hand away fiercely, &quot;Get off of me.&quot;<br>
<br>
Telus winced as his wrist felt as if it were on fire, &quot;I just want to share your energy. Just-&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;NO! You call me names! You pick fights! You try to force me out of the house! You come onto me! You want me to share my powers with you!? I think not!&quot; <br>
<br>
Wind began to encircle Telus and Dahnyella. The fire in her eyes died down, and they began to glow white with her staff. As the wind picked up, her eyes grew brighter. She summoned enough to send Telus out into the hallway and slam the door behind him. <br>
<br>
As the door slammed shut, she grounded herself, releasing unused energy. Tears rolled down her cheeks, while she got up and lighted the laterns and candles about the room. She fell onto the cot and slammed her head into her pillow. She cried for what seemed like hours until she felt Bellona's presence nearing the room. When Bellona entered the room she ran to her and cried, reiterating the nights events. Waves of anger, frustration, worry, and confusion rolled off them with truculence. <br>
<br>
&quot;There's just too many questions, Bellie!&quot;<br>
<br>
Bellona nodded in agreement, then looked out the window. She looked blank then she finally looked to Dahnyella, &quot;I know how we can get the answers...&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;What?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;The answers,&quot; Bellona said again, &quot;It'll take time, and planning. But I know how...&quot;<br>
<br>
Dahnyella didn't know what Bellona was planning, but she trusted her fully. Now, she remembered why she helped the Children with their duties. It's because she came to believe it was the right thing to do. <br>
<br>
<br>
Storm - 8<br>
---<br>
<br>
Dahnyella watched from the shadows, as all the lights went out in her Aunt Dyiuo's home. Every now and then she would see her walk past the window.<br>
<br>
Tears collected on her eyelashes, but she choked them down before a hundred of them littered her face. Her Aunt had gotten so old over the years, and was nothing like she remembered. Her face wrinkled with old age, and her body no longer slender, unlike Dahnyella's own.<br>
<br>
Dahnyella shook her head, remembering why she was here and what she was about to do. /You have to be strong, no emotion. It's now or never,/ Dahnyella thought, as she watched the last light go out.<br>
<br>
Emerging from the shadows, she pulled the hood of her cloak over her head to shadow her face. Ever since she had gotten involved with the Children, she was no longer desired in certain cities, Kelethin was definately one of them. She had killed and tortured so many, was this really what her parents wished of her to do? Was she taking on what should have been her father's path in life? The one he never followed, the one which he did the total opposite?<br>
<br>
As Dahnyella approached the door, she knelt down in front of it. Rummaging through her back pack, she began to hear noise behind her. Closing her eyes and chanting to herself, she began to fade away. <br>
<br>
She turned her head to see who or what it was. Thankfully it was only a man on his way home.<br>
<br>
Finding her borrowed box of picks, she set her back pack aside and scooted closer to the door. She worked each pick in the door, finally coming upon one that made a satifying click. <br>
<br>
Grinning to herself, Dahnyella replaced the picks and box. &quot;Piece of cake,&quot; she said quietly.<br>
<br>
Swinging the battered back pack over her shoulder, Dahnyella stood ready to face what had to be faced tonight. Bellona had told her it would be the only way, and Dahnyella had an inkling it was true.<br>
<br>
As she pushed open the door, she cast her sense out for her Aunt. She was there, but not where she was expected...<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
NOTE: Okay, now this is where I left my readers hanging last time... Here's the continuation of Storm - 8<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Dahnyella stood in the dark cabin, blocking unseen blows with her staff. She was relying on her ability to cast out her senses, to see with out seeing. As she worked her staff with precise accuracy, her mind waited for the moment she could take her attacker, her Aunt, by surprise. The energy was beginning to build up, and her blood was beginning to boil. /Come on Dyuio, give up. You're too old for this,/ Dahnyella thought.<br>
<br>
Dahnyella felt Dyuio's staff jerk left and sent her staff to block, but it only ended with a blow to her right. <br>
<br>
Pain shot up Dahnyella's side, pounding and screaming for revenge. She wasn't about to let this old woman beat her, no way, not now.<br>
<br>
Dodging a swipe from Dyuio's staff, Dahnyella's image faded from sight. &quot;You're too old for this, Dyuio,&quot; Dahnyella's voice echoed through out the room.<br>
<br>
&quot;And you're too naive,&quot; came Dyuio's voice from behind Dahnyella.<br>
<br>
A splitting pain went through Dahnyella's skull, sending her back to the floor. She felt her Aunt's boot slam into her side, forcing her onto her back. /Suck it up/, she thought to herself.<br>
<br>
Groaning, Dahnyella forced herself up onto her elbows, but she was forcefully pushed back to the floor. The tread of her Aunt's boot pressing on her wind pipe. <br>
<br>
&quot;I never had been able to understand why your real mother, Tunare, had left you to frolic like your father, Bristlebane. It's a shame really...&quot; Dyuio rambled as she set her lantern aflame, quickly turning the knob to control its light. &quot;I suppose you already know that you were only birthed by your Ma and Da, my sister and her ink lover. They loved you so much, Dahnyella. If they were alive today I doubt you would be this... rebeling. I doubt you would have turned to the dark.&quot; Dyuio applied a little more pressure, &quot;I know you are about to say you used to be full blooded evil... Over a thousand years ago I know. Then Innoruuk learned you weren't his child. It tore him to pieces knowing that his strongest offspring wasn't his own. You were killed off eventually and came back as the lass you are today,&quot; Dyuio kept rambling, Dahnyella KNEW all of this. <br>
<br>
/By the Gods, Dyuio, shut your hole!/ Dahnyella screamed in her head.<br>
<br>
As Dyuio's words slowly began to wrap around Dahnyella like a venomous snake, she felt all her emotions begin to swell. Closing her eyes, she began to power chant in the back of her mind. Slowly her eyes rolled open, they had shifted to white, plain white.<br>
<br>
Outside, signs on taverns began to swing back and forth, plant life began to sway, all the nocturnal creatures of Greater Faydark ran for shelter, while the late night men and their families took to their homes. You could hear the Guards orders for everyone to get to safety, and the priests cries to the sky above, &quot;What have we done, Tunare!?&quot; <br>
<br>
Over the clamour of Greater Faydark thunder clapped her hands, as lightning illuminated the dark sky to the west, then again to the east. It captured Greater Faydark, surrounded its wall, trapped its inhabitants.<br>
<br>
Dyuio caught a glimpse of the chaos outside her window, and glanced down at Dahnyella whose eyes told her everything, &quot;Call it off NOW, Dahnyella!&quot;<br>
<br>
It's too late now, Dyuio... Oh, did you know I can be inside your head?<br>
<br>
Dyuio applied extreme amounts of pressure to Dahnyella's throat, and Dahnyella could feel her tread leaving its mark. In one swift motion Dahnyella brought up her legs and slammed Dyuio in the back, sending her into the wall. <br>
<br>
Getting on her feet, Dahnyella wrapped an arm around Dyuio's throat while grabbing a suffice amount of hair. She pulled her head back and whispered next to her ear, &quot;Who's too naive now? You had no chance against me, Dyuio. It's time to stop this foolishness.&quot;<br>
<br>
As Dahnyella's eyes shifted to crimson, rain and forceful winds began to add to Greater Faydark's capture. <br>
<br>
&quot;Nice knowing you, Auntie,&quot; was the last thing Dyuio heard of her niece before Dahnyella snapped her neck. <br>
<br>
Dahnyella stood letting Dyuio fall limp to the ground. As the storm brewed more intense outside Dahnyella had to find 2 things, her Aunt's spell book, and her mace.<br>
<br>
Casting out her senses she located them in her Aunt's bedroom, beneath the floor boards. <br>
<br>
Making her way back there, she made a jump for the board her sense had found. Wedging her fingers beneath it, she pried it up. Opening the cloth bundles...<br>
<br>
There was a note, &quot;Did you expect I'd let YOU take them?&quot; <br>
<br>
Slamming her staff against the floor Dahnyella began to open a gate. /Let them all die/, she thought. A vortex of Wind encased Dahnyella, helping her open the portal. Just as she stepped through, lightning struck down in the middle of Kelethin. <br>
<br>
Kelethin's citizens' cries of death could be heard through out Norrath, and when Dahnyella heard them she smiled at Bellona in sheer amusement.<br>
<br>
<br>
Storm - 9<br>
---<br>
<br>
&quot;Dante, get off me,&quot; groaned Dahnyella as she tried to force him off.<br>
<br>
She could feel herself being freed of Dante's weight as he rolled off of her. Forcing herself to her feet, she had a feeling they weren't in Nektulos Forest any more.<br>
<br>
&quot;Where are we?&quot; came Telus' voice from a few feet away.<br>
<br>
As Dahnyella tried to cast her senses out, Dante came and stood by her side. A cold chill ran down her spine as his energy joined her own, but it quickly subsided as her senses kicked in. She could taste death, and touch stone, moss covered at that. Her eyes tingled as she slipped into a new dimension, a castle. &quot;We're in a courtyard,&quot; Dahnyella stated bluntly as her eyes rolled open.<br>
<br>
Telus nodded and helped his sister, Bellona, to her feet<br>
<br>
&quot;Can you pin point the location, Ella?&quot; Bellona enquired<br>
<br>
Dahnyella shook her head and pointed to her ear, &quot;Spires are near, they're clouding my senses.&quot;<br>
<br>
Bellona looked at her and arched an eyebrow, /How far off are the spires?/<br>
<br>
/Just a couple of miles, Bellie./<br>
<br>
&quot;Let's roll-&quot;<br>
<br>
Screams cut Bellona's order off. It was Malasu.<br>
<br>
&quot;I swear to Bristlebane, that Paladin will cost us our lives,&quot; exclaimed Dahnyella, as she rooted Malasu's attacker. Closing her eyes, Dahnyella drew invisibility sigils in the air, then went off to save Malasu.<br>
<br>
&quot;Dahnyella-&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;She'll be fine, Dante,&quot; said Telus grinning as lightning conquered the sky.<br>
<br>
Dahnyella came back with Malasu by the ear, &quot;... don't understand you...&quot; Pushing Malasu into the group, she fancied a glare. Flipping her chesnut hair over her shoulder, she sighed, &quot;Now, I'd like to know how we got here.&quot; When her words finished she shot one final glare at Malasu.<br>
<br>
Dante helped Malasu to balance as Dahnyella, Telus, and Bellona discussed the portal they had stumbled upon in the middle of Nektulos Forest. &quot;How else would we have practically fallen from the sky,&quot; added Telus.<br>
<br>
Dahnyella shivered as Dante came up behind her and slowly leaned in toward her neck. Bellona shook her head, and he pulled away. She was used to his vampiric urges, and she was beginning to get used to fear's finger tips running down her back everytime her came near.<br>
<br>
Malasu glared at Dahnyella and Dante, with hurt laced in her eyes. Dahnyella could have cared less.<br>
<br>
&quot;Guys...&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;What Telus?&quot; asked Bellona engulfed in a map.<br>
<br>
Telus gulped, glancing around, &quot;We have company.&quot;<br>
<br>
Dahnyella looked around as Dante pressed a hand to the small of her back, and reached out a hand to Malasu. They were every where, their red eyes blazing out of the brush. She glanced at Telus and Bellona, then grinning closed her eyes.<br>
<br>
As Dahnyella's eyes rolled open a fog encased them all. Her power chant drifted over the smoke colored mist, transforming it into a crimson light. Bellona and Telus added to the sphere of power, as Dante and Malasu followed suit.<br>
<br>
&quot;On my count release the energies,&quot; Dahnyella breathed, &quot;1... 2... 3... NOW!&quot;<br>
<br>
A cone of white light shot up through the sphere sending a wave of destructive power over a 5 mile radius.<br>
<br>
As the ground began to rumble, and their surroundings took fire, they stood. Each of them could feel their God standing by them at that moment. <br>
<br>
As they all opened their eyes, they could see what they had done. Before them lay a land in ruins, smoke rolling off of charcoal tree stumps, a toppled castle a mile or so off, and dead bodies every where. Yet, all they cared for at that moment were the Nexus Spires. Right there before them, a clear shot.<br>
<br>
Bellona smiled, &quot;You never cease to amaze me.&quot;<br>
<br>
Dahnyella took a bow, then indicated the portal, &quot;Shall we?&quot;<br>
<br>
Bellona took Telus' arm, as Dahnyella took to their side twirling her staff. Dante and Malasu followed closely behind them, Malasu leaned on his shoulder, but at that moment he seemed to care not. They all seemed to take in the ruins... the destruction they cause when together. <p><HTML>
