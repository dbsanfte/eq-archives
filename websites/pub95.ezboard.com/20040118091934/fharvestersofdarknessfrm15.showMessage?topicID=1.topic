<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>The sentry chuckled slightly as he watched Ssakas learning the ways of the Greenmist.  &quot;No scaled wolf pups will ever threaten the Empire with Ssakas around&quot; he thought to himself with a grin, and then his thoughts turned back to his duty, and more importantly, his off-duty plans involving several pints of ale.<br>
<br>
Ssakas did not notice the chuckles, the grin, or even the guard.  His mind was focused entirely on the blade and shield in his hands, and on the enemies of the Empire, whether they had four legs, or two.<br>
<br>
Ssakas' dedication to the Faceless fueled his training.  Quickly he completed the meaningless tasks given by Lord Gikzic, slaying Sarnaks and Frogloks for the good of the Empire.  Cazic himself reached out and touched the broodling, giving him the power to control and command the forces of death.  Lord Korzin then sent him towards Kurn's Tower, in search of the Skull of Torture.</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
Just inside the tower, Ssakas kneeled in front of yet another pile of bones.  The Skull of torture was already in his bag, yet he could not bring himself to leave.  He whispered to his companion, &quot;Jaborn, can you not feel it?  The secrets that reside here, deep in the bowels of this tower?  What wisdom, what power lies dormant within these walls.  I have completed the task asked of me, but I can not leave this place.  Not yet.&quot;<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Jaborn stared ahead with an eyeless,  lifeless gaze.</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
&quot;I know my orders were quite clear, &quot; Ssakas snapped at the skeleton standing guard beside him.  &quot;Retrieve the Skull of Torture, and report back to Cabilis immediatly.  And then no doubt on to another search and find mission.  For what? A blade I will never use in combat?  How much longer will they waste my power?  How long til fight along side our heroic crusaders?&quot;<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Jaborn reached up and readjusted his skull.</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
&quot;Not until I am ready?  Not until they are ready I think is more truthful.  I can not continue with these petty tasks while softskins walk our lands.  If they do not think me ready yet, perhaps I will have to prove them wrong.&quot;<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Jaborn's arm fell to the ground with a rattle.  He reached down, picked it up, and reattached it wordlessly.</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
&quot;How?  Oh, Jaborn, have you not listened to a word I have said?  There are secrets that live here, deep within the passageways.  We must seek out this knowledge, and then upon return to Cabilis perhaps my worth will be proven.  Perhaps then I will be given the Badge of the Skathris Ven'Sho.&quot;<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Jaborn faced forward, motionless.</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
&quot;Yes, I said we.  Do you forget that the Father has given me power over you?  Stand strong Jaborn.  You will accompany me on this quest.  Although....the rattles of your bones may attract more attention than I desire.  Be gone, and I will summon you again when needed.&quot;<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Jaborn collapsed in a heap, the energies animating the bones departing, waiting to be called again.</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Far away, in a different place, a different time, a different plane, a female's laugh echoed off of the walls of a ruined city.</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
&quot;By the Will of the Faceless, Jaborn, to my side!&quot;<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Mystical energy swirled through the air, a magical breeze decending upon the chipped bone at Ssakas' feet.  The bone levatated, and then expanded, shaping space and time, shaking the fabric of reality, until with a slight pop and a rattle, Jaborn stood in the spot the bone had rested.</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
Ssakas smiled slightly,  &quot;Always most punctual.  Here, my friend, take this sword.  The Burynai roam these halls, along with those of your ilk.  To them, we must bring fear.&quot;<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Jaborn took the sword, feeling its weight pulling at his shoulder.  The weight of a sword, the glimmer of a memory, jaborn tossed the blade into the air, flipping it end over end, and caught it, and then the brief kiss of a life long past left him, and he stood motionless again.</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
&quot;What has gotten into you Jaborn?  I've never seen you do that before.&quot;  Ssakas laughed at his pet's new trick.  &quot;Now guard here.  I will bring us blood to spill.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Guarding with my life, Master Ssakas.&quot;  The creeping voice of the dead, emotionless, lifeless, unchanging.  Ssakas took one last look back at Jaborn, a quick peak down each side of the hall, and then was gone.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>The room was silent without Ssakas.  Jaborn stood like a wall, eyeless gaze and a single thought.  &quot;Guard here.&quot;  The words echoed soundlessly within the confines of his skull. Behind the motionless skeleton, the air rippled as if from a great heat.  Brilliant blue light filled the room, swirling energy, balls of light escaped from the rend in time, or space.  Jaborn turned to face them, his orders clear, his sword raised, and the light surrounded him, overtook him, until the light was him.</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->  <br>
<br>
Memories long lost filled his newly awakened mind, assaulting him.  Images of his first love filled his mind, her long brown hair, the green of her eyes, the curves and seductive smile that could tempt the strongest of paladins.  He remembered the first time they made love, his initial shyness, his awe of her naked beauty, her trembling fingers that removed each piece of plate mail from him, and her soft lips that covered the skin beneath his armor.<br>
<br>
The scene changed, no longer his bedroom in Felwithe, he now faced the disappointment of his parents, of his superiors.  A Koala'dal Knight of the Mother consorting with a lowly Feir'dal peasant?  He felt rage then, suddenly.  &quot;She is of Elven blood!&quot;...&quot;&quot;She is beneath you!&quot;<br>
<br>
He remembered it all.  Leaving Felwithe, sneaking from his home under the cover of night, meeting his lover under the trees of the Faydark.  If their love would be a burden at home, they would leave.  &quot;I know a place,&quot; she told him, &quot;where our love will be cherished and accepted.&quot;  <br>
<br>
The memories came scattershot, ripping through his mind.  The long boat ride spent naked below deck, wrapped in each others arms for eternity.  The scowls of the Freeport Militia, her objection to visiting the Temple of Love, the business she must complete in Freeport..alone.  But any doubts were erased by the heat of their love.<br>
<br>
&quot;It is just this way a bit, my love.&quot; she said to him as they crossed the commonlands.  He tried to will the memories away, to stop the pain, but it would not be denied.  The Teir'dal ambush, the short bloody battle, the sword that slid expertly through the crease in his armor, the image of his love being dragged away by two dark knights, and the last words he ever spoke, &quot;My love...&quot;   But the memories did not end there, for now he was floating above his lifeless body, watching as the Teir'dal necromancers surrounded it, examining every part of his corpse.  He watched the knights drag his love to the body, forcing her to look at his....<br>
<br>
&quot;I trust that this one will be of great use?&quot;  His love said, waving her hand quickly, breaking the illusion, blue skin now unhidden.  &quot;The hell I went through to bring him here.&quot;  She shivered in disgust.  &quot;If I ever have to let another Lesser'dal touch me like that....&quot;<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>And in Kurn's Tower, deep in it's basement, Jaborn screamed with a voice tortured by life, a voice that filled the halls until it died, until Jaborn was the light.</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
&quot;Jaborn, why did you not come to my aid?&quot;<br>
<br>
The corpses of three Burynai littered the room.  Ssakas stood in front of his pet.  &quot;If you will not obey me, Jaborn, you will be dispelled.  Be gone from my sight!&quot;<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Jaborn stared at Ssakas, but did not move.</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
&quot;Did you not hear me?  I order you to be gone!&quot;<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>And from Jaborn came a voice of an undescribable nature.  It was not the creeping voice of the dead, or the tortured voice of life.  And as the words flowed, Jaborn grew, reaching the ceiling, which at his touch, disappeared, the room disappeared, they were nowhere.</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
&quot;You order me?  You order me?  I have no superiors, whelp.  Bow down to your lord.  Kneel before the Faceless!&quot;<br>
<br>
Ssakas dropped to his knees, eyes cast downward.  &quot;My...Lord?  I am but a humble servant to Fear, and to the Empire..&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Do not speak to me of the Empire, fool.  They have betrayed me!  Your pitiful race was once my chosen, but now they ignore the wishes of their Father, and concern themselves with their petty Empire.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;But..&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Silent!  The plague of light spreading across the lands must be stopped.  You seek to serve me?  Then do so, but not within the false pride of the Empire, but in the truth of the Faceless.  Allies walk Norrath and Luclin.  Allies with softskin, allies the Empire regard as enemies.  Seek out those who follow Hate, and War, as well as other children given to me.  Only this way, will the light fall before us.  Walk now the true path of Fear!&quot;<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>A flash of blue, globes of light broke free of Jaborn, bouncing off of the returned walls, until with a pop and a wave of heat, they were gone.</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Ssakas, still kneeling, looked up cautiously at Jaborn.  The skeleton stared lifelessly ahead, still gripping the blade recieved earlier.  Ssakas reached out, trembling, until his hand touched Jaborn, and the skeleton crumbled to dust before him.</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
&quot;Everything Ifought for...Everything I've learned....&quot;<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Ssakas sat silently, lost in his thoughts.  The Empire had raised him, trained him.  But he was a childe of Cazic first, and he now knew what he had to do.  He pulled the curved blade symbolizing the Greenmist from it's sheath, and laid it there on the floor, on top of the powder that was once Jaborn.  With that he walked away.  Away from the sword, away from the tower, away from the Empire.</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>And somewhere, sometime, deep within the walls of a ruined Old Paineel, Vazaelle Kaleine laughed the laugh of madness.</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
