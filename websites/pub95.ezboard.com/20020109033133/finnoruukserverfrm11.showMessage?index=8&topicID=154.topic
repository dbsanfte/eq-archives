<br>
Some nice well informed responses here.<br>
<br>
Personally I would recommend IDE  vrs SCSI. Why? Price. Pure and simple. And unless your running a big home business network that SCSI was intended for its not really needed.<br>
<br>
Hard Drives<br>
<br>
 They come in many flavors and such. 5400 7200 and 10,000 typically. With Drives being able to have ata 133 and support now.. and with a 7200+ spin drive you will have little or no problem. <br>
However, what you really want to look for is this. If you want a fast drive even at 7200 rpm spin. Have a look at the MS(millisecond) access time of the drive, typically faster access times will be more expensive, but since you were thinking of SCSI anyway its worth looking at.<br>
<br>
Processor's<br>
<br>
Well, what can we say here. Simply put its cost vrs performance. <br>
Athlon chips have better performance and are easier to overclock at the same MGHZ as Intel's chips. However they have one major inherant flaw. Heat. They just naturally run hot, easily fixed by a decent fan.<br>
<br>
Intel chips are rock solid in terms of performance and compatablility. For an Intel chip you get what you pay for. It may not be the fastest out there even with a matched Athlon chip bit its fairly bombproof and reliable. And the best part?.. Low heat usage.<br>
<br>
Heat kills computers plain and simple. Intel chips run with very low heat when compared to Athlon's of the same range.<br>
<br>
Interestingly enuff there was a test of both athlon and intel chips. Both 900's with no fan seeing how long each would run with NO FAN or cooling system attached.<br>
<br>
Intel got to a certain point and then shut the entire system down.. an inherant ablility imbeded into the chip(or so i'm told) the athlon you ask?.. well  it had no such safeguards and it eventually got so hot it made the motherboard catch fire.. heh.<br>
<br>
as for other perks?.<br>
<br>
Get a DDR (mother)board<br>
Get a GeForce 3 64mbDDR Vid Card<br>
Get a Soundblaster sound card<br>
<br>
Why to i recommend those? Well if one looks at the history of the gaming world it goes something like this.<br>
<br>
Sound.<br>
<br>
Game company's write code for the Soundblaster family first.. all else second.<br>
<br>
Video<br>
<br>
After the nasty little fall of the Voodoo family(which eq recommended originally btw) nVidia is now the leader for that area. With  most if not all code in games being writen for that family of video graphics cards first.<br>
<br>
So what kind of system would i recommend?<br>
<br>
Athlon (more bang for my buck) 1200-1800 range<br>
A really nice processor and case fan<br>
DDR Board<br>
DDR Ram(1 GB of ram btw on Win2k or XP as 98 cant use it)<br>
Soundblaster Live 5.1 in whatever flavor you like.<br>
Geforce 3 64mb DDR Vid Card<br>
60GB+ Hard Drive<br>
<br>
the other stuff CD-Rom etc. well its generic and stuff heh.<br>
<br>
as a side note. i'm currently in school and its nearly a 4-1 ratio in Athlons favor  in terms of processor. Simply because of the bang for your buch ratio.<br>
<br>
Sol<br>
<br>
P.S.<br>
Why are SCSI controllers listed in the IDE part of a listing? Simply put, the SCSI controller is a card very much like a network/sound/modem card in the sense that it fits into your normal PCI slot. And from that slot it comes with long cable very much like your normal IDE cable. here is where it differs.<br>
on your motherboard you have IDE1 and IDE2  . with these 2 controllers you are able to attatch a normal IDE cable with 2 ends on it. one in the middle and one on the end. With those 2 conrtollers you are able and therefore limited to 4 devices on your computer. EG 2 hard drives 1 dvd player and 1 CD rom.  watch your computer to boot up it will say<br>
Primary Master<br>
Seconday Master<br>
Primary Slave<br>
Seconday Slave.<br>
for a totall of 4 devices.<br>
<br>
what SCSI controller allows you to do is bypass that limitation of the motherboard and add more stuff, i think the maximum is 7 devices per controller card(and cable). and thats why its listed there. i hope this helps =)<br>

I'd love to be using some nice SCSI devices at home, but at $500-1000 for the kind of RAID controllers I would want, and somewhere around double the price/MB for SCSI vs. IDE, I haven't been able to justify it yet.   <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#f7f7f7><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub95.ezboard.com/uaoxmodeus.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Aoxmodeus</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Threatening Poster</span><br>  Posts: 81<br> <font color=#778899>(12/19/01 2:44:46 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: heres my system</span><hr size=1> I just wanted to interject with this...<br>
<br>
The performance gained by SCSI, miniscule as it is, is also produced by the fact that better scsi cards do the I/O processing on a separate chip, effectively removing some of the main CPU's workload.<br>
<br>
RAID - a deeper view<br>
<br>
RAID stands for &quot;redundant array (of) inexpensive disks&quot;.  It is a FAULT TOLERANT method of using multiple small devices to create one large storage space. <br>
<br>
RAID comes in different flavors, noted by the number after the RAID.  RAID is avaible in 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,10,53 and 0+1. The common use applications are RAID 0,1, and 5. Newer manufacturers of IDE &quot;raid&quot; cards do not specify that their solution is on the box, though they may on the manual.  Typically, IDE RAID is RAID 0.<br>
<br>
Descriptions of the different types of common RAID:<br>
<br>
RAID 0 is striped without fault tolerance, and as such, is not a true RAID.  I believe this lack of fault tolerance was mentioned earlier in this thread.  You have improved read/write performance, as the data is &quot;striped&quot; between two more more hard drives.  This utilizes both read/write heads simultaneously to access data that has been portioned across the multiple drives. The array appears as ONE logical storage device, which can then be partitioned as you see fit. If you lose one drive in the array, you lose all data.<br>
<br>
RAID 1 is duplexed/mirrored.  In a mirrored system, you have two drives attached to the same controller.  In a duplexed system, you have two drives attached to two different controllers. These drives read and write the same data at the same time.  If one drive fails, you configure the system to use the one remaining good drive while you work out swapping the other.  Duplexing is a design modification that builds in additional fault tolerance for the drive controller itself.<br>
<br>
RAID 5 (Most common RAID technology in PC and UNIX based server applications) Striped with Fault Tolerance.  You have improved read/write performance, as the data is &quot;striped&quot; between three or more hard drives.  This also utilizes both read/write heads simultaneously to access data that has been portioned across the multiple drives. The array , like RAID 0, also appears as ONE logical storage device, which can then be partitioned as you see fit. The difference is Fault Tolerance.  In addition to the data stripes that are written across the drives, a parity stripe is written as well...  RAID 5 arrays do not hold the same amount of data as a RAID 0 array, as a portion of EACH drive is used to store this parity stripe.  If any ONE drive dies in the array, the other drives and the parity software/hardware know how to recreate any requested information from the parity stripe.  replacing the dead drive and rebuilding the array brings it back to a fault tolerant state.<br>
<br>
I believe this information is factual.  I'm unemployed right now, and answering technical questions is a way for me to keep sharp.  Hope it benefits someone.<br>

Raid3 is also good for streaming media.  In a big SAN you just use some kind of HSM to rotate stuff between RAID10 and RAID5 LUN's anyways : P<br>
<br>
What it boils down to, is that in a server that could have anywhere from hundreds to several thousand users connected to it, offloading the Disk stuff to the SCSI controller makes sense.  And you pay for it.  In a machine you use at your desk, your processor is so fast that it is actually faster to use IDE, and you get more for your buck.  There is more overhead in the SCSI command set then in the command set used by IDE type drives.  If you had a high enough workload, because SCSI will reorder requests and so on you end up getting better performance.  As a single user you're more likely to be impacted by the extra overhead of SCSI then you are to see any performance gains. <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top"> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub95.ezboard.com/finnoruukserverfrm11.showMessage?topicID=159.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub95.ezboard.com/finnoruukserverfrm11.showMessage?topicID=157.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br></td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub95.ezboard.com/finnoruukserverfrm11.emailToFriend?topicID=154.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub95.ezboard.com/finnoruukserverfrm11.threadControl?topicID=154.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/professional/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands (Moderator only)</a><br> <a href=http://pub95.ezboard.com/finnoruukserverfrm11.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=154.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub95.ezboard.com/finnoruukserverfrm11.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=154.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub95.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="innoruukserverfrm2">Innoruuk - News<option value="innoruukserverfrm3">Innoruuk - General<option value="innoruukserverfrm4">Innoruuk - Guilds<option value="innoruukserverfrm5">Innoruuk - For Sale/Trade<option value="innoruukserverfrm6">Innoruuk - For Sale/Trade [Gems & Spells]<option value="innoruukserverfrm7">Innoruuk - Roleplaying<option value="innoruukserverfrm8">Innoruuk - Rants<option value="innoruukserverfrm9">Innoruuk - Voting<option value="innoruukserverfrm10">Innoruuk - Playground<option value="innoruukserverfrm11">Innoruuk - OOC<option value="innoruukserverfrm14">Innoruuk - Ask Innoruuk Forum Staff<option value="innoruukserverfrm12">Moderator Forum<option value="innoruukserverfrm15">Moved/Locked Threads<option value="innoruukserverfrm13">Staff Forum</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#778899>- </font><a href=http://pub95.ezboard.com/binnoruukserver>Innoruuk Server</a><font color=#778899> - </font><a href=http://pub95.ezboard.com/finnoruukserverfrm11>Innoruuk - OOC</a> <font color=#778899> - </font><br><br><br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 6.4 b8<br>Copyright ©1999-2001 ezboard, Inc.</center></body></html>
