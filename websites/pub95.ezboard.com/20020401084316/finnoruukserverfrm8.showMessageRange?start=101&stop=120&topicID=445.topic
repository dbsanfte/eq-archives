Now are we done arguing over something that no one can agree upon? People just let it go and move on. Ragefire is going to be a timeless debate and every cleric that I know, including myself, does not look forward to sitting on their arse staring at a spot in Skyfire and wishing he would spawn and praying he doesn't spawn when their guild isn't online.  Having spent the majority of the last 2 weeks or so helping my friends (other clerics) watch this &quot;camp&quot;, I am not too sure I even want to do this for myself and reading this thread certainly isn't endearing myself to it either.<br>
<br>
Just back off of MoM. As a &quot;friend of MoM&quot;, I can attest that in the amount of time I have spent with them, they never &quot;ran over&quot; anyone.<br>

I feel badly for Rikishi because he's a nice guy and it sucks, but MoM is a quality group of folks.<br>

Otoole is a gem especially.  She's my honey from waaaay back in Everfrost nearly 3 years ago.  Then I cheated on her with a troll female, and she kinda got ticked off about that....<br>

<br>
But now to the reason for my post to this thread.<br>
<br>
I do not believe I would be considered a friend of MoM having only  hunted once when they were present, at what I believed to be a join Malus Morioum - MoM event in Chardok.<br>
<br>
However in the 9 and a bit months Aalyien has been alive in Innoruuk I have had help on more than a few occasions some big others small by members of MoM.<br>
<br>
To give details on 2 of these occasions <br>
<br>
I was dead 3 times in velious and had lost my corpses in WL I looked for a necro online and asked for help and he responded that he didnt have much time left but would help me anyway. <br>
<br>
By the time we had got my 2 corpses from WL and one from EW summoned using coffins and a 4th dying in Kael (due to not having invis to run thru the zone and no one wanting to come to zone in to invis me) a good 30 minutes or more had passed. <br>
<br>
This necro from MoM wouldnt accept payment for the coffins I belive between 250 - 500 plat.<br>
<br>
The other was hunting in chardok on the raid I mentioned earlier MoM awarded me the 3rd king drop for the cleric epic <br>
which was amazing because the loot policy states all loot on raid goes to guild. <br>
<br>
I knew this I was more than happy with that just wanted to get an idea of what was needed to take down the king and queen.<br>
<br>
Now to give this to a 51 Cleric (at the time) that MoM had never met before has to say something about this Guild.<br>
<br>
They are good people.<br>
<br>
Rikishi I am saddened to hear of your loss - should you or any other cleric need a hand with RF while I am online please give me a /tell I will come as long as I am not needed in a guild event at that time.<br>
<br>
As for what happened or did not happen 9 months ago in SolB, what good is complaining about it going to do now? <br>
<br>
If it was a MoM monk or not does it really matter? If MoM did do wrong  people do change for the better.. If It was another guild then MoM did no wrong. <br>
<br>
I dont know the truth and am not interested in what happened.<br>
That was then  this is now.<br>
<br>
If MoM treat me a stranger to the guild like this, just imagine how they treat the friends they have?<br>

&quot;Oh, and RR do practice what they preach. I sat in Phinny's lair after the emergancy patch the other night. He was up. RR stated he was mine since I was there first. Well, I couldnt get ppl there. ND offered to help but would not be able to mobilize right away. RR had 2 groups in DC waiting. I talked to ND and we agreed to just conceded phinny to RR. At any time RR &quot;could&quot; have run me over but waited.&quot; <br>
<br>
Actually, when Gallain told us you were there, we had already begun to discuss where else we could go with the force we'd gottten up for that shy squid-face.  I also recall someone saying WOOT, because you aren't the multi-computer, apparently all the time in the world farmer who has pretty much owned Phin for months. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
We wondered aloud in guildsay if you wanted our help?  Next time, just ask, Obi, we don't adhere to &quot;accepted community standards&quot; in our treatment of our neighbors.   Phin dropped the wizard epic piece that Lacy has been trying to procure for more months than I care to remember.  Let me know when you want to give Phin another try, Obi.  I'll put the word out in guildsay and ask for volunteers.  I'm there, if you want me.  Underwater zones are FUB. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
------------------------------------------------------<br>
The title for this thread is correct.  Every epic is DESIGNED to be a waste of time.  Verant wants to convince you that you NEED epics.  They want lots of us to spend inordinate, huge amounts of time on inane quests requiring nothing but time.  I agree with Riki that this quest, arguably for the most useful epic, is not worth the time it requires, but only when you look at it clearly.   Riki also stated, and I agree, that MOM did nothing in this case that was outside the &quot;accepted community standards&quot; that someone else mentioned.<br>
<br>
The problem I have with it all is how these &quot;accepted community standards&quot; were arrived at.  Each guild in EQ, on Innoruuk, is a remarkable amalgam of folks with different reasons to play, goals to attain, differing personalities, all working together, many times unselfishly.  Where that changes seems to be how we treat others outside that guildtag.  That's where &quot;accepted community standards&quot; step away from being good neighbors.  <br>
<br>
It's too easy to blame Verant.  Yes, they chose levels over skills.  Yes, they chose equipment-centric over skill-centric.  They want you to desire &quot;uber&quot; equipment over all else.  The &quot;bottlenecks&quot; are by design. and aren't going anywhere.  Be glad I am not Verant, because every piece of equipment would start to degrade the moment you looted it, if I were.<br>
<br>
WE decide to accept this.  WE decide that spawns have to be competitions and races.  WE decide if we MUST HAVE loot_01 NOW, and damn the cost to others.<br>
WE decide what kind of neighbors we chose to be in Norrath.   WE decide that we can't wait till next time. <br>
WE let it change from US vs MOBs to US vs US.  <br>
<br>
As Obi said, we Ridgerunners aren't accepting this standard of US vs YOU.   Our charter mandates that we &quot;help others&quot;, and that includes not harming as well.<br>
We have lost shots at spawns and items because of this, and we doubt that will change.   We own loot, it doesn't own us.  We play the game, it doesn't play us. <br>
There is always plenty of FUN to be found elsewhere.<br>
<br>
So, when you are waiting for your friends and family in Norrath to arrive, and you see a force of Ridgerunners over your shoulder, for that one time, relax.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

Sis, you know better than that... teehee.<br>
<br>
Yes, MoM did go out of their way on a joint MalusMorium/MoM raid on the Royals a few weekends ago and awarded Aalyien the singed scroll. They could have kept it, MQ'd it or destroyed it, but they gave a cleric that was only there to help out and see firsthand what a Royals Raid is like, the singed scroll that dropped. <br>
<br>
I also remember a night when an herbalist raid in Chardok went badly and the necro who was to summons my corpse to the zone, fell asleep. Extreme and Proven came from wherever they were and summoned my corpse. I didn't ask for the help, they just came because I had said jokingly to Proven that the necro fell asleep.  There are many, many other times that MoM has come to rescue, aid or whatever in the last 20 levels or so.<br>
<br>
So, bash MoM all you want, just know that there are others, many others out there, who know differently.<br>
<br>
And Proven?  STFU and eat your pie. <p><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=46830" target="_blank">Meadbh

The &quot;Gank first, ask questions later&quot; attitude that many people have been taking lately is really a step backwards overall. I'm glad there are those out there who refuse to participate.

I'm the necro that on 2 separate occasions has dropped what he was doing to come CR MoM (mainly because Davviouss asked me to )because there necros were linkdead or asleep , at NO charge I might add other than they replace the coffins I used  . BTW am a big fan of Extreme , he's a very ballsy Necro , any Guild that lets a Necro live to the full extent of their capabilities is a good guild in my opinion . <br>
<br>
With all of that said . I have seen them act in pretty crappy ways to people . <br>
<br>
I have personally watched representatives of them and representatives of another Guild get in a pissing contest and wipe out damn near everyone in the Grey training Shimmering Rockfiends back and forth over each other til both guilds evidently decided they had other things to do .<br>
<br>
I have personally watched them come in and sit down in the middle of someones pull path even though that person had been there well before them AND was there long after they left (they were staging for Royals Raid in Chardok) and begin to ks every pull that came past them ,especially the ones where anything obvious was being held . Even though mob was obviously damaged and obviously agroed on someone other than them .<br>
<br>
I have personally heard the rationalization for any bad behavior by a MoM member as &quot;I was only helping my Guild &quot; a rationalization that I personally think blows. <br>
<br>
I also since one of those incidents have behaved badly toward MoM . Was personally pissed so I kept fearing ANY thing they pulled that hit me . So by no means am I saying I'm an angel .<br>
<br>
I have personally dealt with Angelika on a few occassions , and I have NEVER seen anyone anywhere able to say something believably mean about her. <br>
<br>
With all of that said , Yes I do believe there is a definite possibility that MoM did exactly what was stated by Angelika . <br>
<br>
What really gets me on the whole Rikishi incident is that Merc Force and MoM both have a number of people who were previously Guilded together in other guilds . As well as a number of friends in common , seems sort of sad that <br>
R-E-S-P-E-C-T couldnt have been the word of the day . Did MoM break any rules in killing Ragefire ? Of course not .Did they act in a way that you would act towards a friend ? Again of course not.<br>
<br>
Anywho I expect to take alot of heat about this .  <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top">  Page <a href=http://pub95.ezboard.com/finnoruukserverfrm8.showMessageRange?topicID=445.topic&start=1&stop=20>1</a><a href=http://pub95.ezboard.com/finnoruukserverfrm8.showMessageRange?topicID=445.topic&start=21&stop=40>2</a><a href=http://pub95.ezboard.com/finnoruukserverfrm8.showMessageRange?topicID=445.topic&start=41&stop=60>3</a><a href=http://pub95.ezboard.com/finnoruukserverfrm8.showMessageRange?topicID=445.topic&start=61&stop=80>4</a><a href=http://pub95.ezboard.com/finnoruukserverfrm8.showMessageRange?topicID=445.topic&start=81&stop=100>5</a> <b>6</b> <a href=http://pub95.ezboard.com/finnoruukserverfrm8.showMessageRange?topicID=445.topic&start=121&stop=140>7</a><a href=http://pub95.ezboard.com/finnoruukserverfrm8.showMessageRange?topicID=445.topic&start=141&stop=149>8</a> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub95.ezboard.com/finnoruukserverfrm8.showPrevMessage?topicID=445.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub95.ezboard.com/finnoruukserverfrm8.showNextMessage?topicID=445.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a href=http://pub95.ezboard.com/finnoruukserverfrm8.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=445.topic&index=120><img src=http://www.ichuu.com/AddReply.gif border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub95.ezboard.com/finnoruukserverfrm8.emailToFriend?topicID=445.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub95.ezboard.com/finnoruukserverfrm8.threadControl?topicID=445.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/professional/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands (Moderator only)</a><br> <a href=http://pub95.ezboard.com/finnoruukserverfrm8.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=445.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub95.ezboard.com/finnoruukserverfrm8.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=445.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub95.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="innoruukserverfrm2">Innoruuk - News<option value="innoruukserverfrm3">Innoruuk - General<option value="innoruukserverfrm4">Innoruuk - Guilds<option value="innoruukserverfrm5">Innoruuk - For Sale/Trade<option value="innoruukserverfrm6">Innoruuk - For Sale/Trade [Gems & Spells]<option value="innoruukserverfrm7">Innoruuk - Roleplaying<option value="innoruukserverfrm8">Innoruuk - Rants<option value="innoruukserverfrm9">Innoruuk - Voting<option value="innoruukserverfrm10">Innoruuk - Playground<option value="innoruukserverfrm11">Innoruuk - OOC<option value="innoruukserverfrm14">Innoruuk - Ask Innoruuk Forum Staff<option value="innoruukserverfrm12">Moderator Forum<option value="innoruukserverfrm15">Moved/Locked Threads<option value="innoruukserverfrm16">Archived Messages<option value="innoruukserverfrm17">Archived Messages - 2<option value="innoruukserverfrm13">Staff Forum</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#778899>- </font><a href=http://pub95.ezboard.com/binnoruukserver>Innoruuk Server</a><font color=#778899> - </font><a href=http://pub95.ezboard.com/finnoruukserverfrm8>Innoruuk - Rants</a> <font color=#778899> - </font><br><br><br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 6.6.8<br>Copyright ©1999-2001 ezboard, Inc.</center></body></html>
