He knew what it was for; he didn't have to be beat over the head with it. He simply felt that writing things down would eventually lead to one's downfall - after all, hadn't so many cultures come and gone at that, with the detailed description of racial and economic weaknesses jotted down in some clerk's journal?<br>
  Resignedly, Chaes picked up the tome and opened it, the tanned leather giving off a quiet creak as it was stretched in the blackened acrylia bindings. His furred fingers slid away from the pages he had caught in opening it, letting the sheets of velum dance downwards to join their brethren. Out rolled an acrylia-laced quill from the inside binding of the book as the last velum page descended, caught swiftly in Chaes' hand before it rolled free of the journal.<br>
  He eyed the runes along the edge of the quill, marking them as Teir'Dal, and softly purring out the arcane words. The tip of the quill became wet with ink, obviously from some planar source. He read the last rune on the quill, and the ink dried, cutting the flow of black ink from the magical implement.<br>
  Rolling his eyes, Chaes leaned slowly back against the wall in the Hall, mere moments from sleeping out of boredom, and read the activation runes again, having something to record.<br>
<br>
  <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>The night before the Lady Kerridwynn regained her memory, I dreamt. Only I'm not sure if it was a dream or not, though evidence suggests that it most certainly was not a dream..but a visitation.</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
  Chaes thought for a moment, letting the tip of the acrylia quill to touch his chin, before he returned to his writing.<br>
<br>
  <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>I awoke in a formless void, darkness surrounding me in every direction..but I could </em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->see <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>the darkness, as if I was bathed in light. Then I saw the Lady Kerridwynn, frozen in stasis, her belly swollen in the later stages of her pregnancy.<br>
  Then she came. She was intensely beautiful, but I fail to remember a single solid detail about her. All I seem to remember is she was comprised of everything that made each race beautiful, both on the inside and out.<br>
  My attention was focused on Her, and I knew that this was no ordinary female. This had to be a Diety.<br>
  She bid me to look back upon the Lady, and I saw not one, but </em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->three <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>figures now. I saw the Lady's daughter, as yet unborn, in her infant stages, then toddler and adolescence. I watched as the child was fast-tracked into aging, flowing from one year to the next as if her aging process was like water.<br>
  And I also saw the Lady's dead son, his visage cold and wicked, those golden eyes filled both with malice and love. Then the Diety spoke of him, and the girl, and I remember little of what she said; but I do remember the names. Kyimera, the daughter..and my memory fails again as to the name of her son. Perhaps I am overtired.<br>
  She spoke of the cruel torment placed upon the son, though I remember nothing but the intense sorrow flowing from Her. I do remember the name of the God whom had the soul in His care, though I dare not record it here.<br>
  The Goddess and I spoke of a little more, though not by much, and I learned things I had already known, but it did feel good, as I recall, to have them confirmed.<br>
  <br>
  </em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->Chaes looked up slowly, cracking his neck, as it had become stiff from looking down at the book placed upon his knees. &quot;Just a bit more,&quot; he promised himself, and set back to writing.<br>
  <br>
  <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>It seemed as if hours passed, and it felt as if I were wrapped in a never-cooling blanket which conformed to my body. Perhaps that is why I do not remember so much of this vision; for, like Sascha, I tend to forget things when I am comfortable.<br>
  I awoke slowly, and it was still deep night. I wondered how that could have been, for it seemed as if such a long time had come and gone. I must have slipped back into sleep, however, for the next thing I remember, the sun had risen high into the sky.<br>
  And Sascha awoke with me. That was when I noticed something odd about my companion. She had a medallion about her great neck, comprised of a steel heart wrapped in thorny vines.<br>
  Sascha knew what it was; she was even kind enough to explain it to me. Imagine my surprise to find out we had a Goddess to serve now. Things could be worse; it could have been the Lightbearer to come, instead of his sister. Yes, that'd have been a fate worse than death.<br>
  <br>
  </em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->Chaes slowly spoke the word to end the magical supplication of ink, tucking the quill back into the book. The ink had dried within moments of each letter written, and he safely closed the book without fear of smudging the writing. Tucking it into one of his bags again, he leaned back against the wall, Sascha curling up on the other side of the Ilharess' door, and they both drifted off to sleep. <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top"> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub95.ezboard.com/fharvestersofdarknessfrm15.showNextMessage?topicID=10.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a self href=http://pub95.ezboard.com/fharvestersofdarknessfrm15.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=10.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/space/addReply.gif border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub95.ezboard.com/fharvestersofdarknessfrm15.emailToFriend?topicID=10.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub95.ezboard.com/fharvestersofdarknessfrm15.threadControl?topicID=10.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/space/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands</a><br> <a href=http://pub95.ezboard.com/fharvestersofdarknessfrm15.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=10.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/ultimate/subscribe.gif width=20 height=20 border=0 alt="Click to receive email notification of replies"> Click to receive email notification of replies</a> <br>  <a href=http://pub95.ezboard.com/fharvestersofdarknessfrm15.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=10.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/ultimate/unsubscribe.gif width=20 height=20 border=0 alt="Click to stop receiving email notification of replies"> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies</a> <br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub95.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="harvestersofdarknessfrm1">Announcements<option value="harvestersofdarknessfrm11">Recruitment<option value="harvestersofdarknessfrm8">Public Roleplay area<option value="harvestersofdarknessfrm7">OOC area<option value="harvestersofdarknessfrm16">The Twilight Harvest<option value="harvestersofdarknessfrm9">Members forum<option value="harvestersofdarknessfrm10">HoD Events<option value="harvestersofdarknessfrm12">HoD Vault<option value="harvestersofdarknessfrm15">Harvester Histories<option value="harvestersofdarknessfrm13">IC Officer's Forum<option value="harvestersofdarknessfrm14">OOC Officer's Forum<option value="harvestersofdarknessfrm17">closet</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#A8A8A8>- </font><a href=http://pub95.ezboard.com/bharvestersofdarkness>Harvesters of Darkness</a><font color=#A8A8A8> - </font><a href=http://pub95.ezboard.com/fharvestersofdarknessfrm15>Harvester Histories</a> <font color=#A8A8A8> - </font><br><br><table border=0 align=center><tr><td align=center><a href="http://login.ezboard.com/BBSSystem.showUserPaymentScreen" target="_blank">Upgrade your account to ezSupporter...</a></td><td><img src="http://www.ezboard.com/image/spacer.gif" width=15 height=1 border=0></td><td align=center><a href="http://login.ezboard.com/BBSSystem.showUserPaymentScreen" target="_blank">...and never see another ad or pop-up again</a></td></tr></table><CENTER><!-- START BOTTOM AD SCRIPT -->
