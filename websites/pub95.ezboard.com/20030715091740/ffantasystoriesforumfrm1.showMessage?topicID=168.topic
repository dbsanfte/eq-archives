He had been assigned to guard the Emperor’s personal library. The black, round, shiny button that closed his uniform at the left side glittered in the candlelight. Finding himself in flawless condition, Ji Min fastened his family katana and watakishi to his waist as he opened the sliding rice paper door and walked out into the night. The torch lighters were out and slowly making their way down the cobbled streets illuminating the dark streets. Passing by the large stone and brick buildings, Ji Min glanced down alleys finding only darkness residing. <br>
<br>
As he neared the library, Ji Min glanced to the sky, the stars were out and the crescent moon had not yet shone her pale face. Ji Min had always loved the stars and the sky. Secretly, he would sneak a look into the Emperor’s books to look at the pictures of the sky. Ji Min had never been taught to read and so could not learn from the books, but he had spent his entire life trying to become the guard he was today. Spending his time as a child learning as much as he could from the Karate instructors, and taking what he could from the monks of Kung Fu. Ji Min was a perfect guard for the Emperor, strong, fast, and quiet. Taking in a deep breath of pride, the doors of the library were opened for him. <br>
<br>
&quot;Pleasant evening Bo, I am here to relieve you.&quot; Ji Min had known Bo since childhood, though Bo did not have the physical training that Ji Min did, Bo could read. The two held each other in the highest regard and respect. <br>
<br>
&quot;Be sure to check the torch lighters, they are late tonight.&quot; Bo said as he began to pack his things together. &quot;And Ji, do not forget to stay awake, I left you some sake to keep you warm, the radicals have been growing more and more brave with their attacks.&quot;<br>
Ji Min had been warned about the radicals. They were a secret organization trying to burn all the books in the empire. They believed that reading was a waste of time and men should be working the fields, and fighting for land instead of reading and writing. Ji Min took heed of Bo’s warning and waved him goodnight. <br>
<br>
The sound of the crickets chirping was all that could be heard in the night, Ji Min was having no trouble staying awake. Although the sounds and the dim light only helped to bring his spirit into calm, Ji Min was meditating for his strength. Standing up to walk around and get the blood flowing in his legs again, Ji Min decided now would be an excellent time to practice his Saili Kung Fu, a style very popular in sholin monks. Standing up, he took off his sword belt and laid them gently on the ground near the door. In front of the library was a large courtyard of cobbled stone. Stretching his muscles, Ji Min spaced himself into the center of the courtyard. Standing perfecting still, and upright, Ji Min began the routine movements of the Saili Fu. The smooth movement helped to bring his spirit to peace and his body to the full capability. His punch was strong, his kick was fast, and his blocks were like stone. <br>
<br>
He was in the full motion and reaching the end of the first cycle of his exercise when his eyes caught sight of a red banner fluttering in the wind moving down an alley. Standing straight he smoothed out his uniform, running his hands over the cool glossy buttons. Running back to his swords at the door, Ji Min took his position again at the gate. No one should be out at this time of night, it was not allowed. Waiting for a guard to appear and handle with the intruder, Ji Min wiped the sweat from his brow. The banner was proceeding closer and closer, but no one was there to stop it. Sighing at his interruption, Ji Min decided that as an Imperial Guard, it was his duty to send this banner home with its wielder. <br>
<br>
&quot;Stop, who goes there?&quot; Ji Min shouted towards the banner. The banner wielder was an old man hunched over by age. The clothes were torn and old, rags of the poor. Ji Min was weary of this intrusion. What would an old man with a banner be doing out this late at night near the Emperor’s library? He did not wait for an answer. <br>
<br>
&quot;You, old man! Go home, you are out after curfew and need to return to your home.&quot; Ji Min reached for his blade. His hand tightened around the handle as the old man drew closer and closer seeming unaware of Ji Min’s presence. <br>
<br>
&quot;This is your last warning, go home or I will be forced to arrest you!&quot; Ji Min shouted again. The old man took no notice.<br>
<br>
Ji Min, who was used to getting respect when he talked, pulled his sword in a slashing motion upward, and just as quickly as he had pulled it, he had returned it into the scabbard. The old man never stopped, even as his flag fell to the ground. Ji Min was red with anger.<br>
<br>
Just as Ji Min was about to knock the old man down, a wind out of no where started to pick up. The old man stopped and looked up. Ji Min was now glowering at him. The old man started to search his rags for something with his free hand, while the other one still clung to the pole that was now without a flag. Ji Min stood his hand still on his handle of his sword. The old man stood up straight and towered over the Imperial guard who now was shocked and wide-eyed. <br>
<br>
&quot;Stand down sir, my quarrel is not with you, but with your master.&quot; The man cast off the rags to reveal a man dressed in black. The hood fell away and a mask was what remained. Ji Min was staring into the eyes of a ninja. <br>
<br>
&quot;Traitor! Radical!&quot; Ji min shouted as he went to strike him down. His movement smooth and quick, Ji Min moved forward like the leaf picked up from the wind and carried with force and vigor, as his hand started to pull the sword again.<br>
<br>
The ninja threw a small metal ball towards Ji Min’s feet and was gone. Ji Min was left in a cloud of smoke sword drawn and swinging wildly at the ninja who had disappeared. Turning back to the courtyard, he saw many men at the entrance to the library. <br>
<br>
&quot;Intruders!&quot; Ji Min shouted as he rushed back to fight off the ninjas. <br>
<br>
The steel flashed as he pulled his sword once again in an attempt to slice at one of the ninjas. But the black clothed figure had other plans and blocked Ji Min’s blade with his staff. The wood fell in two and the ninja smacked Ji Min across the face with the upper half of his former staff. Ji Min fell to the ground and the ninja’s opened the library and walked in untouched. <br>
<br>
Jumping to his feet Ji Min shook his head. He looked into the library and saw the flickers of flames. Shouting again, Ji Min ran into the building. He pulled the small bucket of water used for emergencies, and doused the fire and looked around, where were those ninjas.<br>
<br>
Walking with caution through the library, Ji Min listened for sounds of the ninjas. He heard nothing, but it was already too late. The ninjas were already watching him. One of the ninjas jumped to block his path; Ji Min drew his sword and cleaved him in half. The ninjas did not expect him to fight so viciously. Two ninjas jumped to his path and the three advanced forward drawing steel. After a flash, Ji Min was behind the two ninjas and held his sword angled upwards and to the right. The other two had their swords aimed for the body. Ji Min sheathed his sword and the other two ninja fell in halves. The guard’s only mark was a single button that fell to the ground. Ji Min had conquered yet two more ninja. <br>
<br>
But this was all in an attempt to distract the guard. The other two ninja were setting flames to the books in the library and sneaking off. They knew they were no match for the almost samurai skills of this guard, so they strayed away from his blade. After they had set fire to many shelves and the flames had started to consume the building, the ninja dropped the banner of their radical group and fled. <br>
<br>
Ji Min was still searching for the ninja when the building started to collapse. Giving up, Ji Min fled from the building and watched his post as it was consumed in flames. <br>
<br>
Morning came and Bo returned for his shift and found the library in ashes. Ji Min had gone off in search for the ninja but found nothing. Bo spotted Ji Min sitting on the ground by his old post looking at the sky. <br>
<br>
&quot;What happened here Ji? Why did you let this happen.&quot; Bo said harshly. <br>
<br>
&quot;The radicals came, they have ninjas. I defeated three or four, but they were too many.&quot; Ji stared at something in his hand. <br>
<br>
&quot;Ninja! Why was the guard not alerted! We could have come!&quot; Bo screamed at the sitting man.<br>
<br>
&quot;There was not enough time, all I could do was to try and fight them off. I failed.&quot; Ji Min stood up and stood beside Bo. Placing something round into Bo’s palm Ji Min closed Bo’s fingers around it<br>
<br>
&quot;I am retiring to my home now. You are free to guard the ashes. Good Morning.&quot;<br>
<br>
Ji Min walked off down the streets towards his home. Bo watched until Ji was gone from sight. Sighing as the guards ran to the ashes of the Emperor’s burned down library.<br>
<br>
As the other guards ran around looking for answers, Bo stood in the middle of the chaos looking at his closed fist. <br>
<br>
&quot;Ji what did you do here last night?&quot; Bo asked himself. He opened open his hand and looked at the round black button. The shine was gone and the thread was burned around the rings. Bo smiled at the gift and grabbed a nearby guard. <br>
<br>
&quot;Ji Min. Somebody find my friend Ji Min; he’s a hero.&quot;<br>
