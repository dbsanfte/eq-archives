Little conversation did they hold, out of fear, out of anticipation, and out of respect. They were the ones who for one reason or another sought to become one of the elite; they sought membership in Sinful Revelation. They were waiting for the leader, someone whom they knew only by reputation. Some of them didn’t even think that it was possible to see her; it would be like standing in the presence of god. Or so the legends and rumors said. They had been waiting in the crowded hall for six days now; it was on the seventh that she came. She announced her arrival in such a way that was so immensely horrible that it suited her. A scream was heard at the back of the hall. One of the hopefuls lay dieing on the floor, blood pouring out of every orifice. Several of the others rushed to help him . . . within seconds they were all dead. One cried out as he witnessed the slaughter “What is this?” and he was soon added to the body count. <br>
        All heard a childish giggle as it echoed through the hall. Then she emerged from the shadows. A figure, completely enshrouded in black except for the pale white skin of her face was what met their eyes. She had a small smile on her face as she walked through the crowd, her eyes meeting each and every one of theirs. She glided up the steps to the stage and turned around, still smiling. <br>
<br>
        “You have all come because you wish to enter the sacred order of Sinful Revelation. I as you may have guessed, am Paradise. Regardless of what you may think you know about me, I think you will find me to be extremely generous and . . .” Someone coughed. Her eyes darted to where the sound had came from and smiled. She raised her hands and cast a spell. Yet another hopeful was dead. She picked up where she had left off, addressing the crowd, “and kind. However, not just everyone can gain acceptance to our ranks. Most of you will in fact die, maybe all of you. But in the meantime I will assign each of you to a member. You will spend up to a year with them, learning from them, and serving them. If they see that you are not fit, they will kill you. One of you will even spend some time with me.” She nodded to one of her officers standing in the back and pointed to one of the hopefuls. He was quickly escorted out of the room. “Adieu.” With that she disappeared. Ten clan members slowly walked through the crowd, inspecting the hopefuls. When they had finished they each selected one and escorted them out of the hall. Those that were left had no idea what was going on. They stood where they were and waited, not knowing that Paradise had forgot to mention that only ten of them would be trained. An army of the undead quickly descended upon them. Within minutes not one was alive. 60 people died that day, deep beneath the city. Their bodies were soon found, floating through the sewers. <br>
        Paradise walked briskly through the halls till she came to her chamber. She had had one of the hopefuls lead there, to serve as her page. She knocked three times on the door. She waited until she heard a confused and frightened voice on the inside bid her enter.<br>
<br>
Varian didn’t know what to expect, he had started to think that perhaps he had gotten in over his head. He had watched the slaughter after the meeting from the window that overlooked the great hall. He wasn’t quite sure what they had in store for him. When he heard the knocks on the door, he jumped. “c-ca- come in . . .” he stuttered. A shiver went down his spine as he realized what was happening. He had been selected to train with Paradise. His mind raced back to their previous meeting. Would she recognize him? He would soon find out.<br>
<br>
“Necromancy,” she said and nodded her head. He recalled hearing this greeting before as he had come in and quickly bowed his head and replied, <br>
“Victor”<br>
<br>
She silently walked across to the bed, presumably her bed. She sat down and leaned against the wall. She was smaller then he had thought. One always assumes that a legend is a giant, but Paradise stood a few inches shorter then his shoulder. She giggled and offered him a seat, motioning to the chair behind him. She spoke very fluidly, with a voice that reminded him of a child; when the great hall did not magnify it, her voice came close to that of his little sister’s. He couldn’t help but smile. “What is it?” she asked, an awkward grin on her face. <br>
“You aren’t quite what I expected,” thoughts of home quickly vanished as he remembered who he was talking to and where he was, “your grace.” <br>
“I have a habit of surprising people,” she said, “and cut the formalities they get to be such a bore, just call me Paradise.” He smiled again as he noticed again that whenever she spoke, she had a little bit of laughter in her voice. “Well, this is my chamber. You will report here tomorrow at say 9:30?” Varian nodded. “It is getting late, the sun will soon be upon us, it is time to sleep. My pet will show you to your room. He is waiting out side the door. Good day!” She smiled at him warmly and glanced at the door, it slowly opened. “Oh, and I don’t think I caught your name.”<br>
<br>
Varian turned his head back to face her and as he walked out the door called back, “They call me Varian.” As the door shut Paradise said the name over in her head, trying to think where she had heard it before. She couldn’t remember and quickly went to sleep.<br>
<br>
When he woke, Varian walked out into the hallway. A shaft of light from a hole in the ceiling cascaded through the dark passage and landed on what appeared to be a sundial. He approached it and noticed that it was in fact a time device, like a sundial but functioning from the light of the moon. He read where the shadow landed and realized that he was late for his appointment with Paradise. He got dressed; grabbed his bag and headed for Paradise’s chamber, nervous what would happen to him if he were late. When he got there he noticed a rather large skeleton standing outside her door, it was the one that had shown him to his room the night before. “Hello” he said. It remained motionless, its eyes fixed heavily upon him. He started to speak again and the skeleton opened the door and bid him enter. He walked in and turned around to thank the odd doorman but found that the door had already been shut. He turned back and looked around the room. It appeared to be empty. The air was cool and there was a candle burning in the far corner. He walked towards the light, and as he emerged from the shadows he saw Paradise. She was still asleep. She lay in her bed, under the covers. All he could see was her pale white arm lying over the sheets to her side, and her delicate head resting gently on the pillow. It was the very essence of beauty. Framed by the dark red silk sheets, she appeared nothing but angelic. Even in her sleep was she smiling. She moaned softly and rolled over to her side. Varian was very unsure what to do. He cleared his throat and called out her name, “Paradise?” She slowly began to cross back from the land of dreams and opened her eyes to see Varain standing by her bed. <br>
“Hello,” she said, “it looks like I’ve over slept. I hope you’ll forgive me?”<br>
“Of coarse,” Varian said as he bowed, “if you would like me to come back I can go . . .”<br>
“No,” she interrupted, “have a seat. I’ll be with you in a moment.” Varian turned and found a chair right behind him. He thought it was funny how that worked. As he sat down he saw Paradise stand up and slowly walk over to her wardrobe, yawning. His heart missed a beat. She was nude. He quickly averted his eyes and blushed. Paradise didn’t seem to notice. “So,” she began, “tell me about yourself.” She began to look through her wardrobe, and Varian laughed to himself as he thought of her picking through her seemingly large supply of black robes, picking one as if it were different from the rest. <br>
<br>
<br>
“Hungry?” Paradise asked as she led Varian down a long corridor.<br>
“Famished.” Varian replied, becoming more and more at ease around Paradise. He could hear noise coming from the end of the corridor. As they got closer he could distinguish individual sounds. He heard the clatter of dishes, loud laughter, and what seemed like a hundred voices all speaking at the same time. The sight that met his eyes when the door was opened was quite a surprise to him. A long table was set in great hall with men and women lining the sides – talking, laughing, and carrying on in such a manner that reminded Varian of the great feasts of his youth. A broad smile spread across his face as he followed Paradise to the head of the table. When she reached her seat the room fell silent. She addressed her friends,<br>
“Hail Necromancy!” And with the sound of a thousand drums, the sound of thunder roaring across the plains, the gathered shouted in response, “Victor!” With that the former chaos continued. Varian watched silently as Paradise joked and talked with her friends. He ate heartily, not knowing that the excellently prepared meat was in fact, High Elf. Varian eventually could resist no longer, and joined in the conversation next to him. When Paradise poked him and told him that it was time that they get to work, he almost felt sad, and as he stood up even shook the hands of his new friends. When he turned to leave the hall he noticed the great windows overlooking the hall. And then like a lightning bolt striking his mind he realized where he was. This was the same hall in which he had waited 7 days. This was the same hall where just the night before he had watched 60 people die. As he walked toward the door he noticed that there was still blood on the walls. He tried to remember that these people he was surrounded by were indeed Necromancers and therefore his enemies. He exited the great hall with his head hung low, angry at himself for forgetting, even for the briefest moment, that he was a stranger here. <br>
As they walked through the seemingly endless hallways Paradise told Varian what their business was today. Apparently gangs of rogues were making plans to become the dominant force in Qeynos. Paradise said that one of her informants had gathered this information and that the rogue guild was at the other end of the sewers. She had to stop them before the proposed a serious threat to the Shrine of Bertoxxolous. Varian kept quiet about the fact that he knew these rogues, that they had been strategically executing a plan in which they would assonate the main leaders of the city. This was precisely what the Temple had sent him to investigate, as well as the activities of the Necromancers. But, Paradise had said that could wait till later. First they had another errand to run. They had entered the hills just outside of Qeynos. They sat beneath a tree, the cool night breeze rustling the leaves gently. <br>
“Well, I am supposed to train you, so lets get started. Summon a pet.” Paradise instructed Varian as she took a look over her shoulder. Varian reached into his bag and grasped two of the bone chips he had brought with him. He said a silent prayer to those brave men who gave their lives so that he might be able to fool a Necromancer. He placed the bones on the ground, and began to cast. To his surprise he managed to do it correctly, and an undead pet stood before him waiting to do his bidding. Paradise looked at the pet and grunted. When she had summoned a pet (much larger then that of her companions) she sat down and began to meditate. <br>
“What’s the plan?” Varian asked, nervous about disturbing her.<br>
“I want to see what you’re capable of. Soon a guard by the name of Cheslin will be walking this way as he makes his rounds. I want you to kill him. He isn’t much of a fight, you should be able to take him, if not just holler and I will help you.”<br>
<br>
