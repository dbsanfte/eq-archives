The biggest misconception out there about Rule 9 of the EULA is that &quot;You may not use third party programs&quot;. <br>
<br>
As you pointed out, and as I have tried to as well, is that it <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> doesn't</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> say that, but states that the third party program cannot change gameplay. EQW doesn't do that. <p><p><a href="http://www.thevigilant.net/index.html"><img src="http://www.thevigilant.net/images/themis/t.gif"align=left hspace=0></a>

<br>
VI knows that EQW exisists for over a year.  They have unoffically stated on their forums that it is in the grey area of the EULA.  But they have no intent at that time do anything about it, as it does not change any files or enchance the game.  <br>
<br>
Alt Tab was only disabled in 95 98 and ME.  win 2K you are able to get out and i don't know about XP.<br>
<br>
Guides have reported running EQW during there duties and none of them have every been banned.  They have also gone to whatever zone specfic place for GM Guides, with no problems.<br>
<br>
EQW does help  some people's  computers when full screen mode kill them.  A friend of mine has this problem and EQW is the work around until he can upgrade.<br>
<br>
The Random number generator has been server side since I believe Kunark realease or before.<br>
<br>
EQW has been discussed on this board past.  We have just asked people in the past not to post the link.  <br>
<br>
Aldrin it would still be 3rd party because your application is leeching off of the 2nd party.<br>

<br>
&quot;EULAs won't stand up in court anyway...&quot; True, but valueless.  The EULA will stand up at the VI headquarters, and you won't be a VI customer.  The court will not order them to do business with you.  It is *faintly* possible you could sue, and get the part of your subscription fee they would not refund to you.<br>
<br>
But most likely not.  This would be a very small claim, and unless the judge took an interest in the law of the case you would not get any of her time in court.<br>
<br>
If you got that far VI would move to dismiss and the judge would agree.  *poof* a few $kUS out the window for you.  An opportunity for one of the Sony litigators to stand up in a suit for them.<br>
<br>
*IF* you could find an attourney who would present the case.  It is very possible that the judge would politely call the counsel to the bench and chew on them for about 1 minute (they would have no ass left at that point) for wasting her time.  And attourneys hate that.  So most likely your lawyer would not present the case at all. <p>"You're only young once, but if you do it right, once is enough."<BR>

<br>
Hell, in some aspects, I'm sure Verant would prefer players to use EQW for multiple accounts rather then multiple computers (more prone for errors, due to reaction time).<br>
<br>
However, the main beef I can see Verant having with EQW, is the ease to abuse EQ with other 3rd party software (EzMacro's comes to mind).<br>
<br>
Also mentioned earlier in terms of the EULA... EQW doesn't change/alter the EQ code, therefor doesn't break the EULA (expect an admendment to the EULA in the future). But, what are you going to do *if* you some how got caught and banned? Not much, as Sinneed stated, you wouldn't get far. <br>
<br>
Gamiene pointed towards another route, but her 3rd paragraph/sentance down pretty much gives you the indication of the chances of someone going all the way to do this (unless we have non-working millionare's that play and can afford to do something like that <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> ).<br>
<br>
Another option would be for everyone to gather seriel numbers from the various Sony products they own - send said information to Sony, explaining how you/they are great and loyal consumers of Sony's various products. Then point out having issue's with *their* subcompany Verant, explaining (nicely) the problem and your expected solution. <br>
However, I find this as unlikely as the others posted above, due to the fact that this would take tons of ogranization, and too many people's time.<br>
<br>
Plain and simple, use EQW at your own (very small) risk.<br>
<br>
I have no need for the program. I use 2 PC's to play and have a readily available PC to run jobs, check stuff on besides... however, I definately wouldn't fault someone for using this program. Unless, they were using it to cheat somehow.<br>

I believe this actually modifies the program in memory to allow you to hotkey the mouse (alt+ctrl+r) to get the mouse back.  This little program does modify eq.  I doubt it does anything bad though.<br>
<br>
Verant has already allowed some programs that were created to help the impaired utilize the game.  I believe they have ok'd some macro type programs.<br>
<br>
As for EQW being detectable.  Yes, it is detectable and not from the fact that someone may be using 2 accounts on the same IP.  There are many routers that allow you to do this and that's legit.<br>
<br>
EQW is detectable because there are several Win API function calls that allow the programmer to simply get the parent handle of the main window or even to check the app.title.  This isn't rocket science.  I could write a simple program with a few lines of code that can tell you what the window handle is and who the parent is and what the title is without batting an eye.  These are readily used by programmers. <br>
<br>
Regarless, this doesn't mean that Verant will do this.  All it means is that Verant can.  To date everyone knows well enough that they are aware of this program.  Ask yourself how many ppl use it that you know and ask yourself how many you know that have lost access to their accounts because of the use of it.<br>
<br>
In all likelihood they were counting on the increased graphics, memory, and other system requirements to cut into the use of it.  Then again, to cut into the use of it can cut into the desire of those to maintain multiple accounts. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub95.ezboard.com/umetaphisto.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Metaphisto</A> at: 3/25/02 4:52:02 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#f7f7f7><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon3.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub95.ezboard.com/uwuchild.showPublicProfile?language=EN>WuChild</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Dubious Poster</span><br> <font color=#778899>(3/25/02 10:16:27 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub95.ezboard.com/finnoruukserverfrm3.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1445.topic&index=32>Reply</a>    <br>Community Supporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: EQW vs EULA</span><hr size=1> edit: nevermind! <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub95.ezboard.com/uwuchild.showPublicProfile?language=EN>WuChild</A> at: 3/25/02 10:44:07 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#f7f7f7><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub95.ezboard.com/ulegollasedgeleaf.showPublicProfile?language=EN>LegollasEdgeleaf</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Dubious Poster</span><br> <font color=#778899>(3/26/02 12:17:31 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub95.ezboard.com/finnoruukserverfrm3.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1445.topic&index=33>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   ~</span><hr size=1> Coffee that inflicts 3rd degree burns?
