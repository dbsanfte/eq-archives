Chapter 8<br>
<br>
&quot;Cyrus Awakens.&quot;<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Magus stood before several of the judges who where about to pass sentence on him. After the incident the night before he had been worried only about Kayla. Though before he had entered the court room his worries where put to rest as she had only been sedated with a power drug the assassin had used. This did little to ease his troubled mind though, he was afraid of what he had become when angered. It was the unbridled force that was guiding his actions that he feared more than anything else.<br>
<br>
All he could do was thumb the small crystal charm he had given him before sending him just after he had entered the room. Everyone had been silent as several of the judges conversed about the events that had happened. There was no possible way now that his family could persuade the decision that was about to be made.<br>
<br>
<br>
Cain cursed himself for having brought all this on his great grandson, in fact he felt he was worse than a murderer now as he sat in the room. He knew the boy was probably going to be sentenced to imprisonment or death. In truth he had given him the Cyrus in hopes that it could protect him from everything, and perhaps demonstrate his true persona. For all the years that he had watched this child grow up he had always seen he was withdrawn at times, but never would he willingly try to take an innocent persons life.<br>
<br>
If anything his hopes laid with the Cyrus, the crystalline entity that he had fashioned to become the ultimate protector. Though he realized the cost using the components assembled to create it could cause. Through all the years he had taken the chances to collect samples of creatures only know as Celestials, as well as their near opposites known roughly as Demons. The other part that had in fact made it a crystal was a fragment of armor from the being only know as the Dread King.<br>
<br>
The combination proved to be deadly indeed, over the years he had managed to keep this experiment under-wraps. Al'Kabor himself would have raised quite a stink if he had known what Cain had been attempting to do. It was by pure luck that Cyrus had not awakened yet, though it was also by pure luck that it had remained in a perfect neutral state. This was a good sign, since it was neither considered of a good nor malevolent nature.<br>
<br>
Cain realized that in his youth he had indeed done something great, he was responsible for the Exodus being created. In turn it had reproduced itself to create a counterpart for itself, that called the Lumina. Several other weapons had thus spawned from the Exodus, the last having been the Matsume. If anything the Matsume was a great weapon, but he feared that soon it would not be enough.<br>
<br>
This was one of the main reasons he had passed the Cyrus crystal off to Magus. He wanted the boy to be saved, and also he had a gut feeling that somehow it would awaken only his possession. He had a rough idea that it would take on the form of an armor, but didn't have much else he could go on. It's potential was considerably higher than that of anything he had created in the past.<br>
<br>
<br>
This was the perfect time for him to enact his revenge. Years before he had managed to gain the powers of several demonic creatures, yet this didn't satisfy his lust for power. He wanted the power of the one who was neither Celestial, nor Demon. Just recently he had found the documents on such a creature, and had learned it had been sealed away.<br>
<br>
At first his plan was simple, he had hired an assassin to kill off the Bayle family. These were not the only targets though, he had also instructed the assassin to kill the descendants of those who had opposed him. He knew full well that they could stand against him and prevent him from gaining the goal he had set.<br>
<br>
This goal was simple, he wanted to not only rule the entire mortal realm of Norrath, but he also wished to rule over all the other alter planes he had traveled to. In order to do this he knew he was going to have to gain enough power to rival the gods themselves. This alone had lead him to search out the more powerful of non-deity creatures. The closest match to anyone with this kind of power had come to several choices for which he could try to mimic.<br>
<br>
The first of these prospects where the man simply known as Raziel Eo'brm, but after a certain point there where no traces of him to be found. One of the next choices seemed to be those of the True Dragon's, though finding them had proved to be more difficult than that of Raziel. The last choice that had caught his eye was that of Dirk Lunas, though this man was no where to be found the fact that he was half demon was the inspiration he needed.<br>
<br>
After having researched all this he finally came across more valuable information still. It pertained to a race of beings simply called Celestials. These people where very nomadic, and it was becoming more difficult to even find anyone of this race now. All this changed after having found that a half demon, half celestial person had been sealed up long ago near Qeynos.<br>
<br>
With all this knowledge he had attained he realized that if someone where to either become like this person was that they could conquer anything they wished to. This was his ultimate goal, he wanted to use this power to destroy everything in existence. The theory was if he could destroy the gods, then he had enough power to access the core of all creation without having to gain the keys the gods possessed. There he could manipulate what he wished to and recreate everything just the way he wished it to be.<br>
<br>
<br>
Since the fiasco in Freeport he had little time to rest. Even for a Shadow Knight his age this punishment was rough. It was risky, and most certainly meant death if anything didn't go his way. This was somewhat expected, though he never imagined he would be used in such a way.<br>
<br>
The nature of his job was simple enough he though, and considering his training he could accomplish the task at hand. All he had to do was break into the court room and destroy the judges as well as anyone present. The information he was given was that these people where responsible for one of their best assassins being caught.<br>
<br>
One other thing bothered him though, he was suppose to kidnap a woman being taken care of no far from the court room. This was by far something new to him, normally he was just sent out to torture and kill any victims, so this was a definite change from the routine. All he was told about her was that she was special, and that one of their associates wanted the girl for some sort of experiment.<br>
<br>
After learning this he simple thought it was more likely the Erudites of Paineel, or perhaps the Necromancers located in Neriak. He had always heard they where of the experimenting type, this didn't surprise him one bit. Both the Dark Elves and the aforementioned Erudites had always had a thing for performing experiments. The part that was puzzling is that the rumor was it wasn't going to pertain to necromancy.<br>
<br>
It was a breeze for him to slip into the building and around the guards. They never where to bright when it came to dealing with Necromancers or Shadow Knights. In all their efforts to rid the Aqueducts of their presence they had always failed. For the most part this was due to incompetence of the Qeynos guards, as well as the fact that they used the night and shadows to do their bidding.<br>
<br>
All was quiet looking in the room from his vantage point. It all seemed quiet as the judges appeared to be deliberating some verdict for the young man he seen standing before them. He had heard this boy had something to do with several incidents that had marred the reputation of the guards, as well as the Bayle's family name. If it wasn't for the fact this youngster had captured their assassin he might have been invited to join them.<br>
<br>
<br>
The judges definitely had their hands full on this one. None of them where sure just what had happened considering how the guards all seemed to hate this man before them. Furthermore the fact he had been found in the company of an assassin didn't make matters easier. If they made the wrong mistake it surely could return to haunt them another day.<br>
<br>
&quot;It's unanimous then, given the information and the first hand accounts we have no other choice but to pass this sentence.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;We the judges of Qeynos have found Magus Kataoka guilty on all charges.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Having decided this the sentence is immediate execution...&quot;, this was indeed grim for them to condemn such a young person to this fate.<br>
<br>
&quot;D... D..... Death?&quot;, Magus couldn't believe what he heard.<br>
<br>
This all felt like it was some hellish nightmare to him. He couldn't understand how they could do this, it just didn't seem right at all. If it wouldn't have been for him the young lady Bayle would have died for sure. Not only that, but the whole Bayle family could have been destroyed afterwards with ease.<br>
<br>
Odd as it might have been, Cyrus could comprehend all that was going on. It relied on its feelings and primitive thoughts. It could tell the person who was now in possession of it was facing some sort of crisis. At the time though it deemed it to not be life threatening, if it was to become worse that would certainly trigger a response from it.<br>
<br>
There was a flash of light, and then Magus felt intense pain as he was flung across the room. Out of the corner of his eye he could seen an armor clad figure batting down the guards with a bastard sword as they tried to restrain him. Who ever this was had apparently come here to finish the work that the man last night had failed to.<br>
<br>
<br>
It was incredible, who or whatever had given him this power had definitely earned his graces and his servitude. This was far more strength than he had even at his best, he could literally feel his muscles straining against the armor he was wearing. He was going to make sure he pleased who ever had granted him this power no matter what it cost, even if it meant killing off his old masters and allies.<br>
<br>
These guards where nothing to him, and the focus of his first assault was laying across the room motionless. The guards where no more than gnats to him now as he struck them down one by one. He was thoroughly enjoying this new found gift, and the carnage he was capable of producing now.<br>
<br>
It felt as if nothing could stand in his way, almost as if he were nothing but the pure essence of evil itself. He had wanted this kind of strength for years, and now he had it. Not only was he going to put it to good use now, but later he planned on returning to Freeport to take revenge on the people there.<br>
<br>
<br>
This was all upsetting to the being most would call an ungod. For years he had watched over these people and watched them overcome their troubles. Now though things where different, he didn't have the power to physically help them anymore. Their mutual foe had now gained far more power than he had managed to attain before.<br>
<br>
The options that now lay before him where limited. If he tried to physically help now he could be exposed and killed. Zebuxoruk did know one thing, that the old man Cain had invented something that could save them now. Though it was apparent both the young man in the scene and the entity he was in the possession of could defeat this man. They simply didn't have the motivation.<br>
<br>
An idea came to the great beings mind, and it was indeed a wonderful one. The sword he had seen the night before could most likely arouse the young man's mind. If that was possible then perhaps things stood a chance of changing now.<br>
<br>
<br>
The Matsume couldn't understand what was going on now since it had been separated from Magus the night before. More so disorientating was how it had suddenly found itself transported into one of its masters hands. Everything seemed so grim and it could tell that all hope had apparently been sucked out of Magus.<br>
<br>
- Get up you idiot, come on lets get up and kick this guys arse! -<br>
<br>
- Leave me alone, even if I do I've been sentenced to death... They'll kill me afterwards. -<br>
<br>
- Come on, if you don't get up you'll die anyway, there's always a chance you can change their minds. -<br>
<br>
- It's no use, I'll sleep till death takes me... -, at that Magus closed his eyes, tired of the conversation.<br>
<br>
&quot;Marvelous power, this is splendid, now for the woman from last night!&quot;<br>
<br>
- Did you hear that Magus, he's going to go after Kayla! -<br>
<br>
Something inside of him couldn't stand the thought of anyone harming Kayla. If he was going to die then so be it, but he couldn't die knowing she could join him soon afterward. It was true that his body hurt, and that he should have stayed down, but the intense need to protect the people he cared was now making him stand.<br>
<br>
Magus leapt forward before his enemy had a chance to see him standing, a brilliant light filled the room as the Matsume's emerald materialized. With several strikes the assailant found himself stumbling as he turned to face who was left for him to fight. Much to his surprise it was the very person he thought wouldn't give him anymore trouble.<br>
<br>
&quot;That was a big mistake, you'll never see the executioner!&quot;<br>
<br>
Once again he felt disoriented as he was struck across the face with an armor encased fist. The ethereal blade of the Matsume had only managed to scar the mans armor at best. There was a hard cold feeling as he fell to the ground, blood was freely pouring from his mouth. Magus could feel his mind beginning to slip into unconsciousness, and there was nothing he could do about it now.<br>
<br>
It was then that Cyrus came to the conclusion that its existence was in trouble. The young man who was in possession of it surely faced death. It felt that for some reason this person was the one it was going to bond to. All it could understand was is that this person needed help, and also the strength to fight.<br>
<br>
Cyrus only knew of one way to help this person now, it had determined that he would need some sort of armor. After all he already had a weapon, which it determined was quite unique, and would assist it easily in helping defend them both. With this settled it pulled Magus's broken body up into the air as an orb of spectacular white light engulfed his body.<br>
<br>
All that Magus felt now was a bone chilling coldness inside his body, but at the same time he was also experiencing a burning sensation on his skin. What ever was happening to him now was feeling worse than any torture imaginable. All of his senses where being overwhelmed now as they where being pushed far beyond their limits.<br>
<br>
Though the guards where conscious and able to see what was happening before them they hadn't a clue what was going on. They couldn't tell what kind of spell was now encompassing the young man that was sentenced to death. This light was far more intense than any they had ever seen from a spell before as even the shadows of the room began to retreat from the light.<br>
<br>
At last the brilliant light began to retreat, almost as if it was being pulled into something. Before everyone's eyes a  figure began to take form out of this seemingly chaotic display of power. Little did anyone know that what they where about to see would be something to both be feared, as well to be cherished at the same time.<br>
<br>
Finally the ebbing light vanished and the figure that now stood before them baffled the guards, as well as their foe. The armor was seamless, it being mostly silver all except the crimson patches on the shoulders as well as the chest. The chest plate was separated, one plate covering each breast. The same applied to the abdominal section, these appeared to be the only actual separations in the armor.<br>
<br>
The head was a different matter completely, again no openings where present, even the mouth was covered tightly. It was magnificent to behold, yet frightful as well, mainly due to the where eyes should have been was simply what appeared to be a crystalline visor that ran from temple to temple. Also more disturbing where the hands, as each finger appeared to come to a semi-dull point, as if they where malformed claws.<br>
<br>
Magus was now aware that the pain had subsided, even the pain from his wounds was gone. It took awhile for his eyes to adjust, but once they did they locked in on the armor clad man before him. He surprisingly now felt angry, even more so than he was before, little did he know that Cyrus was using this emotion for its own purpose. In fact it was amplifying it many times over, using it to focus Magus's attentions on the threat to their lives.<br>
<br>
It soon became apparent to the guards that a tremendous battle was about to take place. They came to this conclusion as they seen the newly armored young man rush forward and strike their foe. This in turn sent the elder man before them crashing through the wall, the tables had now turned.<br>
<br>
This was impossible for him to understand, how could simply gaining some strange armor as this cause such a miraculous change in strength. He couldn't understand it, even now as he swung his bastard sword in his attempts to strike down this thing before him. No matter how hard he tried, his sword constantly missed it's target.<br>
<br>
All this didn't seem strange to Magus at all now, he was simply doing what his grandfather had trained him to do. Now that he had seen everything this man could do, it was time for him to act on that. This having been decided he struck the man once more, his fist landing clean across the his breastplate and causing it to fold around his fist.<br>
<br>
Suddenly Cyrus had a thirst for something, as if it had a natural want for violence and carnage. This became even more intense as it seen a spray of blood surge out from its enemies mouth. It now knew what it wanted, it craved blood and charge, and in turn it forced its will upon Magus.<br>
<br>
The guards looked on in horror as the person before them seemed to change into a savage creature of the darkness. There was a strange metallic sounding scream as it shoved its new found victim to the ground, only to settle into a steady rhythm of brutal punches across the mans body. All they could do was back away as again another scream was heard, blood began to spurt up into the air from the force of the attacks.<br>
<br>
Magus had lost all control over his actions, he wanted this person dead that was all he knew now. This was what his mind was set on, as it was ignoring the fact that each time he drew back his fist more blood and flesh was being slung out into the air. He was lost in the madness that Cyrus was forcing on him.<br>
<br>
As the judges came to they seen the horror before them, and then their eyes focused in as a silver armored had reached down and ripped it's foe's jaw clean from its head. Whatever this thing was before them it was acting like a monster, or perhaps something even worse yet. Soon it was over as the figure stood before them, splotches of blood coating the majority of the silvery armor that he wore.<br>
<br>
<br>
The sight before him infuriated him beyond belief, as once again it seemed that his servants where no match for one who carried the Kataoka name. In fact if anything this person appeared to be even more blood thirsty than he ever was. This was going to present far more problems than he would be able to tolerate, and in truth he was afraid of this armor the young man was now in possession of.<br>
<br>
All his best laid plans would have to be changed now to accommodate this new threat. It never failed to amaze him at how powerful these people could be. He knew first hand the kind of power they possessed, as he had nearly been killed by this young man's grandfather.<br>
<br>
Over the years he had come to expect that they would continue to present a problem for him. This time was different though, one of them actually had scared him. For something to do this it obviously had to be special in some way. Little did he realize just how special the young man, and the armor he had seen truly where...  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub95.ezboard.com/bfantasystoriesforum.showUserPublicProfile?gid=zulik>zulik</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Angel of Death</span><br>  Posts: 342<br> <font color=#FF0000>(10/23/02 6:18 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub95.ezboard.com/ffantasystoriesforumfrm2.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=97.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> *huggles!*</span><hr size=1> hmmm....Raizel...could you be the writer thats handle was Raizel?..or just a fan like myself if you are indeed Raizel<br>
