Its not that hard. Just because its the norm doesn't mean you have to do it. Would you like it if you sat there for 6 days only to get run over after ONE failed attempt?<br>
<br>
I agree that letting them take as long as they want would be stretching it. However they should be given at least 2 attempts at the spawn.<br>
<br>
And I guarantee you're not going to be able to have 40 people there camping him 24/7 for 6 days. Hell, which clerics had more than 6 to 12 camping RF for the 3 day spawn?<br>
<br>
I would not to have gotten my epic by stomping over someone else. Its not worth it for a bunch of pixels. You make someone else feel terrible for your own self gain. It just baffles me, people log on, and forget all respect for other people.<br>
<br>
I don't understand how you can hurt someone else for a bunch of pixels. <p><a target="new" href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=46121">My stuffs!</a> </p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#f7f7f7><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub95.ezboard.com/umeadbh.showPublicProfile?language=EN>meadbh</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Dubious Poster</span><br> <font color=#778899>(2/11/02 4:22:34 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub95.ezboard.com/finnoruukserverfrm8.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=445.topic&index=22>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Waste of time.</span><hr size=1> Quite honestly, I don't think he was run over.

I do know the disappointment is high though. Several people sat with him 24 hrs a day, 6 days straight. It's a bloody long camp and a frustrating one as well, and what for? For an epic that is beneficial to everyone else.<br>

<br>
The thing that's changed is, you don't lose your trigger now if you lose RF. So he IS like Sev and Talendor. This is the version of the epic dragon race that several other classes have been churning through since the jump.<br>
<br>
As for the epic benefitting everyone - that's true. However, every time he spawns a_cleric WILL be getting a click stick. It isn't as though it's going to waste if it isn't a_particular_cleric this time.<br>
<br>
Having said all that, I'm sorry for your disappointment. I've grouped with both of you and if I can help you on your next attempt I'll be glad to do so, and to bring as many friends and/or guild mates as I can.<br>

3.  We had folks take 7-8 deaths to drag the dragon away from the fight area so we could res and buff and actually be ready to fight him the 2nd time, but that just wasn't meant to be...oh well.<br>

<br>
BTW, I remember the good old days where if your guild showed up and saw another guild with a dragon at 20% health and started getting unforseen deaths you'd jump in just to get the dragon dead.  Course, that was the days when it was cool to help each other.  Went for all mobs too.  Now, you see folks let somebody die so they can just kill the weakened mob.<br>

At least MoM let the dragon regen so it was a real fight, I will give'm that much.  And no, they didn't do anything technically wrong.<br>

I was on a VS raid, another guild was there but we had FiF. They let us go first, we failed. They tried and failed. Then a third guild tried and dropped him. That seemed like a pretty fair way to do things to me.<br>

I'm also sure if MoM stepped up to help try to kill Rage (once he got low) this cleric (and others) would now be claiming they were trying to KS him AND that would have made for some good thread reading. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p><br><br>

Verant stopped him from being a camp when they removed him from SolB.  This action was taken because clerics would camp Ragefire for days. and then when he spawned. they would be run over by a guild who could mobilize quicker.  They moved Ragefire to stop this from happening.  So now he is a Kunark dragon and ffa.  So sitting in SF for days on end waiting for him to spawn will not get any cleric their epic.  The best bet would be to have a twink camped there and periodically check to see if he is up.  Then get everyone there as fast as possible.  Trying to camp Ragefire in SF like the old one in SolB will only serve to dampen your spirits and disappoint you.  He IS ffa just like Sev.  <br>
<br>
I don't feel MoM did anything wrong in this engagement.  They waited their turn, just like the above example on killing VS in KC.  Every guild needs Ragefire, and you cannot expect them to assemble with enough people to take him only to help you when you don't have the force to kill him.  MoM was fair in that they let Rikishi make an attempt instead of saying you do not have the force and just take Ragefire.  It doesn't have anything to do with greed, although some of you will disagree.  Some of you state MoM should have helped Rikishi.  Ok, where do you draw the line on that?  Next time a cleric is trying to solo fear kite Ragefire, would you have a guild who shows up fif help him too cause he was there 6 days?<br>
<br>
I am sorry you didn't get ragefire, Rikishi, but as you said, you didn't have enough to kill him.  Maybe in the future your luck will change.  Don't give up.  You will get your epic through perseverance. <p><a href=http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=19612

Or perhaps it's a camp because it was created because of the SolB camp /shrug.  <br>
<br>
As soon as I read what VI was doing I knew it was gonna be trouble.  At least the old way you had to trigger the merchant to spawn the dragon.  Now you kill the lvl 54 monk to spawn the dragon.<br>
<br>
As far as number of tries, there is no set rule.  As I said before, technically, MoM didn't do anything wrong.<br>
<br>
However, *I PERSONALLY* (and this is only my opinion) believe that 2 attempts is fair, just because of situations like this case where you get early aggro.  I've seen it happen on many a dragon /sigh.  You're half thru a buff cycle, folks are lom, folks unbuffed...and whammo, aggro and you die.<br>
<br>
Of course, will all the l33t guilds all over Innoruuk and every other server stomping on each other that's no longer the case.  Guild X goes after Dain/Vindi/Sev/Trak/&lt;fill in the mob here&gt; and gets early aggro/killed and another guild walks over them to kill the mob while the first group does CR.  <br>
<br>
That's not how it was back in 2000, but then we weren't a server full of level 60s back then either.  Tis life.  Unfortunately, the rivalry between the MoM/TD/LoD/AV/TP/xxx (sorry if I left any out) out there means that hastily assembled groups have it tougher.  Such is life in Norrath.  MoM saw it as other guilds coming, we take him or somebody else does.

You are correct though that moving him to SF was the worse thing Verant could have done.  Their solution to the problem with camping Ragefire just made it harder for clerics to get their epic, which was the intention of Verant in making this move.  They wanted to eliminate the bottle neck of clerics camping Ragefire. <p><a href=http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=19612

Camping Ragefire is a waste of time.<br>
<br>
There are a lot of folks who are angry, and passionately vocal about Rikishi's claim to this spawn.  What I want to know is, how does standing in one place for six days give a body the right to say &quot;When &lt;MoB name&gt; spawns, he belongs to ME&gt;&quot;?  I'm not being sarcastic in the least.  I need a stone from Hate, so if this is acceptable behaviour I'm going to go up and establish my claim on Innoruuk tonight. <br>
<br>
Since when do we respect squatters?  I'm terribly sorry you sat in one place for a week, padre, but that doesn't mean you deserve to be paid for it.<br>

MoM has never run over people to get to mobs and will not.  There are a tremendous amount of very caring and fairminded people in MoM.<br>
<br>
I am here to offer my assistance to Rikishi the next time he sees RF up in SF.  There are a lot of us in MoM who would be happy to help him get it, just give me a tell if I am on.  I will say this however, even though our cleric did not sit there for six days straight, he has been going there as often as RL would permit to watch for the spawn.  Not being there 24/7 doesn't make him any less entitled to get the epic piece when compared to any other cleric who has worked hard to get to that point.<br>
<br>
I am sorry you didn't succeed Rikishi but will be happy to help you next time if you need the help. <p>Raan Lionheart

No one yet has answered the question posed here many times. How hard would it have been for you guys to have just helped Rikishi ? He had been camped there 6 days straight, your guild knew this. He died your guild moved in and took it it. Fair game ? Thats your call. Morally though, how hard would it have been to assist and offer the item to him that he had camped for so long. Quite frankly I think what your guild did is just pathetic and coming here to state otherwise is lame. As for offering assistance in future ? I'd rather burn than ask your guild p!ss on me. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#f7f7f7><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub95.ezboard.com/ukaganfindel.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Kaganfindel</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Dubious Poster</span><br> <font color=#778899>(2/11/02 2:47:15 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub95.ezboard.com/finnoruukserverfrm8.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=445.topic&index=37>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://web4.facelink.com/edit/raw/rawimage/49/2436849.jpg?flezbwidth=60&flezbheight=60?flezbwidth=60&flezbheight=60?flezbwidth=60&flezbheight=60?flezbwidth=60&flezbheight=60?flezbwidth=60&flezbheight=60?flezbwidth=60&flezbheight=60?flezbwidth=60&flezbheight=60?flezbwidth=60&flezbheight=60?flezbwidth=60&flezbheight=60?flezbwidth=60&flezbheight=60?flezbwidth=60&flezbheight=60?flezbwidth=60&flezbheight=60?flezbwidth=60&flezbheight=60?flezbwidth=60&flezbheight=60?flezbwidth=60&flezbheight=60?flezbwidth=60&flezbheight=60?flezbwidth=60&flezbheight=60?flezbwidth=60&flezbheight=60?flezbwidth=60&flezbheight=60?flezbwidth=60&flezbheight=60?flezbwidth=60&flezbheight=60?flezbwidth=60&flezbheight=60?flezbwidth=60&flezbheight=60?flezbwidth=60&flezbheight=60?flezbwidth=60&flezbheight=60?flezbwidth=60&flezbheight=60?flezbwidth=60&flezbheight=60?flezbwidth=60&flezbheight=60?flezbwidth=60&flezbheight=60?flezbwidth=60&flezbheight=60?flezbwidth=60&flezbheight=60?flezbwidth=60&flezbheight=60?flezbwidth=60&flezbheight=60?flezbwidth=60&flezbheight=60?flezbwidth=60&flezbheight=60?flezbwidth=60&flezbheight=60?flezbwidth=60&flezbheight=60?flezbwidth=60&flezbheight=60?flezbwidth=60&flezbheight=60?flezbwidth=60&flezbheight=60?flezbwidth=60&flezbheight=60?flezbwidth=60&flezbheight=60?flezbwidth=60&flezbheight=60?flezbwidth=60&flezbheight=60?flezbwidth=60&flezbheight=60?flezbwidth=60&flezbheight=60?flezbwidth=60&flezbheight=60 WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Waste of time.</span><hr size=1> That's a good idear, Raan.<br>

No less stupid now than it was before, &quot;epic&quot; only in time wasted, as is every &quot;epic&quot;.  <br>
<br>
I can't or won't say MOM was wrong.  They played the same standard &quot;It's us or them&quot; game Verant wants us all to play.   It's the &quot;norm&quot; now, it's the way things are done now.  <br>
<br>
WE let Verant create that attitude.  <br>
<br>
The pre-dominance of &quot;uber&quot; loot came with Kunark, and we all let it change us.   We didn't used to judge a player's worth by their gear.  We let it become a race between us, rather than us against the MOB's.  There might have been a time when all of us committed to camping RF 24/7, 365 a year, in shifts, and every Cleric who could have a click stick would.  It might have been the biggest dam_n &quot;list&quot; camp by every dam_n guild for every dam_n healer on Inny.  It might have been FUN to tell Verant, &quot;Stick yer epics&quot;.  We just don't seem capable of that.  <br>
<br>
Blame Verant or the unspoken &quot;norm&quot;, all you want, but it's all of US.<br>
<br>
Add me to your list, Riki.  If I'm on, I'll come.  One more click stick, one more rezz for ANY poor soul who needs one.  We win, the MOB's lose.  That's the greybeard way.<br>

Pretty nice of all the MoM members to offer their help. Too bad they couldn't have been so helpful when the cleric was asking for their help. Letting him have a 2nd go at it would not have hurt anyone, and rushing to kill it because other guilds were showing up to kill it and may have beat you to it is nothing more than greed. If my guild had done something like this, I would have let the cleric who sat there for 6 days loot the needed peice. Probably would have gotten me booted from the guild, but then again, if the guild were that eager to not show a lil common courtesy, I wouldn't wanna be in that guild.<br>
2 wrongs don't make a right. Just because everyone is rude, and incosiderate doesn't mean you have to be rude and incosiderate.<br>
And yes, I know this will fall on deaf ears. Anything that shows that EQ isn't &quot;just a game&quot; is ignored for the most part. Kinda funny how it's &quot;just a game&quot;, yet so many people spend more time in EQ than in RL.<br>
<br>
Also, considering Verant changed the setup of this epic not too long ago, one might think that people would be a little more considerate since no one is exactly sure what bugs Verant has thrown into the mix. But then that requires common courtesy and a lack of greed. Something you won't find in EQ. <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top">  Page <a href=http://pub95.ezboard.com/finnoruukserverfrm8.showMessageRange?topicID=445.topic&start=1&stop=20>1</a> <b>2</b> <a href=http://pub95.ezboard.com/finnoruukserverfrm8.showMessageRange?topicID=445.topic&start=41&stop=60>3</a><a href=http://pub95.ezboard.com/finnoruukserverfrm8.showMessageRange?topicID=445.topic&start=61&stop=80>4</a><a href=http://pub95.ezboard.com/finnoruukserverfrm8.showMessageRange?topicID=445.topic&start=81&stop=100>5</a><a href=http://pub95.ezboard.com/finnoruukserverfrm8.showMessageRange?topicID=445.topic&start=101&stop=120>6</a><a href=http://pub95.ezboard.com/finnoruukserverfrm8.showMessageRange?topicID=445.topic&start=121&stop=140>7</a><a href=http://pub95.ezboard.com/finnoruukserverfrm8.showMessageRange?topicID=445.topic&start=141&stop=149>8</a> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub95.ezboard.com/finnoruukserverfrm8.showPrevMessage?topicID=445.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub95.ezboard.com/finnoruukserverfrm8.showNextMessage?topicID=445.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a href=http://pub95.ezboard.com/finnoruukserverfrm8.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=445.topic&index=40><img src=http://www.ichuu.com/AddReply.gif border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub95.ezboard.com/finnoruukserverfrm8.emailToFriend?topicID=445.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub95.ezboard.com/finnoruukserverfrm8.threadControl?topicID=445.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/professional/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands (Moderator only)</a><br> <a href=http://pub95.ezboard.com/finnoruukserverfrm8.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=445.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub95.ezboard.com/finnoruukserverfrm8.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=445.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub95.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="innoruukserverfrm2">Innoruuk - News<option value="innoruukserverfrm3">Innoruuk - General<option value="innoruukserverfrm4">Innoruuk - Guilds<option value="innoruukserverfrm5">Innoruuk - For Sale/Trade<option value="innoruukserverfrm6">Innoruuk - For Sale/Trade [Gems & Spells]<option value="innoruukserverfrm18">Innoruuk - Tradeskills<option value="innoruukserverfrm7">Innoruuk - Roleplaying<option value="innoruukserverfrm8">Innoruuk - Rants<option value="innoruukserverfrm9">Innoruuk - Voting<option value="innoruukserverfrm10">Innoruuk - Playground<option value="innoruukserverfrm11">Innoruuk - OOC<option value="innoruukserverfrm14">Innoruuk - Ask Innoruuk Forum Staff<option value="innoruukserverfrm12">Moderator Forum<option value="innoruukserverfrm15">Moved/Locked Threads<option value="innoruukserverfrm16">Archived Messages<option value="innoruukserverfrm17">Archived Messages - 2<option value="innoruukserverfrm13">Staff Forum</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#778899>- </font><a href=http://pub95.ezboard.com/binnoruukserver>Innoruuk Server</a><font color=#778899> - </font><a href=http://pub95.ezboard.com/finnoruukserverfrm8>Innoruuk - Rants</a> <font color=#778899> - </font><br><br><br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 6.8<br>Copyright ©1999-2001 ezboard, Inc.</center></body></html>
