But I knew that it would come<br>
An old true friend of ours was talking on the phone<br>
She said you found someone<br>
<br>
And I thought of all the bad luck<br>
And the struggles we went through<br>
And how I lost me and you lost you<br>
What are those voices outside love's open door?<br>
They make us throw off our contentment<br>
And beg for something more<br>
<br>
I'm learning to live without you now<br>
But I miss you sometimes<br>
And the more I know, the less I understand<br>
All the things I thought I knew<br>
I'm learning again<br>
<br>
I've been trying to get down<br>
To the heart of the matter<br>
But my will gets weak<br>
And my thoughts seem to scatter<br>
But I think it's about forgiveness<br>
Forgiveness<br>
Even if you don't love me anymore<br>
<br>
Oh these times are so uncertain<br>
There's a yearning undefined<br>
And people filled with rage<br>
We all need a little tenderness<br>
How can love survive in such a graceless age?<br>
<br>
All the trust and self-assurance that lead to happiness<br>
They're the very things we kill, I guess<br>
All the pride and competition<br>
Cannot fill these empty arms<br>
And the work I put between us<br>
You know it doesn't keep me warm<br>
<br>
And I'm learning to live without you now<br>
But I miss you, baby<br>
The more I know, the less I understand<br>
All the things I thought I'd figured out<br>
I have to learn again<br>
<br>
I've been trying to get down<br>
To the heart of the matter<br>
But everything changes<br>
And my friends seem to scatter<br>
But I think it's about forgiveness<br>
Forgiveness<br>
Even if you don't love me anymore<br>
<br>
There are people in your life who've come and gone<br>
They let you down<br>
You know they'll hurt your pride<br>
You better put it all behind you babe<br>
Cause life goes on<br>
If you keep carrying that anger<br>
it'll eat you up inside<br>
<br>
I've been trying to get down<br>
To the heart of the matter<br>
But my will gets weak<br>
And my thoughts seem to scatter<br>
But I think it's about forgiveness<br>
Forgiveness<br>
Even if you don't love me<br>
<br>
I've been trying to get down<br>
To the heart of the matter<br>
Because the flesh will get weak<br>
And the ashes will scatter<br>
So I'm thinking about forgiveness<br>
Forgiveness<br>
Even if you don't love me anymore<br>

The sun had already hidden itself behind the mountains of Butcherblock and she sat in the still of the twilight, looking over her past and contemplating the future.  The only sound that dared to break the silence was that of the wind weaving its fingers through her long dark tresses, and the rustle in her robes as she sat on the swing.<br>
<br>
She closed her eyes and thought about the days that seemed long gone, back when he was at her side.  It had been just two moons since she had last held his hand, feeling the warmth of his pulse emanate through the softness of his flesh.  He was her one true love in all of the realm.  They sang along to songs that were being played, and they both laughed at themselves at the silliness of it all.  She would sit on the grass and watch him hone his skills, tumbling in the grass as he worked on his flying kicks.  After each pass, he would smile at her sheepishly and she would mouth the words &quot;I LOVE YOU&quot; to him.  Those glorious days after the last summer solstice were among the most delicious she had ever known.<br>
<br>
They had looked upon each other with loving eyes, trying to be modest in public although they were a bonded couple, yet never once trying to hold back their smiles.  They spoke through their eyes when words could not be said, yet every chance they got he would come close to her side and speak to her in whispers.  His eyes twinkled as he looked at her, and she would lower her eyes and her soft chime of a giggle could be heard accross the room.  The world was as it should have been.  Those days seemed so very long ago, yet only two moons have since passed...<br>
<br>
Pride had torn them both apart.  She had endured much in her 57 seasons and he could see that her reserve was rather fragile.  Long a champion to others' causes, she kept giving of herself so that others may smile.  But she hardly smiled herself.  Yet she trudged on, because that was all she knew.  He had been through his own hardships in all his years of battle.  Bound by duty and servitude, he had been self trained to hold himself back and keep a distance.  Then she came along and he didn't quite know what to make of her.  But he stuck to the only thing he knew.<br>
<br>
Yet it is impossible to fathom that in the span of one solstice, they had both abandoned their old habits and allowed themselvs to smile, allowed themselves to get close.  Allowed themselves to BE.  But it happened.  Those were the most wonderful days the Gods and Goddesses of Norrath had ever granted them, ironic as it seemed for they both did not believe in their existence.  But his indifference, coupled with her burnout, proved to be their ultimate downfall.<br>
<br>
Finally in the end, Innoruuk proved to be victorious.  The seeds of doubt were planted, and much as they both relied on their own personal fortitude to see themselves through, they were mortal after all... and they faltered as mere mortals sometimes do.  He could have been the silver spring to her golden sands... but instead all that was left was an abyss in an acrid and unrelenting desert.  The stars in the nighttime sky grew dimmer, the heavens started weeping, and somewhere... somewhere, Innoruuk is smiling.<br>
<br>
She missed him terribly, but as each day passed the aching in her heart began to dull.  She was learning to live on her own again as she'd done for so many years, and everyday her longing for him diminished.<br>
<br>
But the touch of his hand and the sound of his voice remained in her mind like a slow burning ember, and try as she might she could not shield herself from the heat.  Not just yet.<br>
<br>
She relaxed in her seat and let the swing come to a rest when she felt a warm sensation lightly envelop her shoulders.  <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> He's here!</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->  She had thought.  She stood up and looked around, expecting to see a warm and comforting face... but the stillness of the night in Kelethin was the only thing with her. Yes, she had only imagined it.  Mirswith had not reached out to touch her. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#f7f7f7><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub95.ezboard.com/unikkoli1.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Nikkoli1</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Indifferent Poster</span><br>  Posts: 202<br> <font color=#778899>(12/26/01 2:17:27 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Mirage</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> A familliar voice from the shadows, barely audible in an attempt to remain hidden, emerges, although which shadow the voice comes from is still a mystery</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
