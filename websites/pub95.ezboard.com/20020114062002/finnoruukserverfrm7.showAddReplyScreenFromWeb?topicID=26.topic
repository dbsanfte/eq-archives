picked up the knitting needles and was working with the pattern and yarn at a furious pace.  Slowly her creation was taking shape in her hands, and the beginnings of a cap could be distinguished.<br>
<br>
Madcatt, upon entering the room, watched her working with the patterns, her brow furrowed in concentration.<br>
<br>
&quot;You and Mirswith aren't having...&quot;  he began.<br>
<br>
&quot;NO!&quot;  Her quickness to interject startled the warrior.<br>
<br>
&quot;I mean... it's not what you think&quot;, she stammered.  Without looking up or skipping a beat, she chuckled at her close friend.  &quot;Winter is approaching, it's going to be a cold and bitter one.

Her brow was twisted with worry and fatigue was starting to erode the walls of her calm composure.<br>
<br>
She clutched her cloak about her shoulders and tried to sink herself into its warmth, but to no avail.  She could feel goose bumps form up and down her arms and she shivered as a result.<br>
<br>
Winter had come early.  The wind howled at her relentlessly and the chill in the air furiously nipped at her cheeks.<br>
<br>
She missed him.  The weather in Velious was cold and cruel, but not as cold and cruel as the distance that kept him from her.<br>
<br>
&quot;I'll be home soon&quot;, he told her.<br>
&quot;I'll be here... waiting&quot;, she had replied.<br>
<br>
They left the Plane of Fear that fateful day, dejected and broken, and she had seen him but once since that day.<br>
<br>
Letters to her were few and far between, and she was left to wonder often about his welfare.<br>
<br>
&quot;I'll be home soon&quot;, he had told her.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> Come home NOW</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> she silently pleaded, hoping that by closing her eyes she could somehow penetrate the vast distance and have him hear her call.<br>
<br>
It's never too late, there's always a light burning. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#f7f7f7><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub95.ezboard.com/ujeisenne.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Jeisenne</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/white_star.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Kindly Poster</span><br>  Posts: 466<br> <font color=#778899>(12/22/01 5:45:05 pm)</font><br>    <BR><img src=http://www.notoriouskillers.com/illusion.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Mirage</span><hr size=1> Jeisenne lowered herself into the seat of the old rickety swing that she had put up in Kelethin, hidden away from the public eye. The sun had already hidden itself behind the mountains of Butcherblock and she sat in the still of the twilight, looking over her past and contemplating the future. The only sound that dared to break the silence was that of the wind weaving its fingers through her long dark tresses, and the rustle in her robes as she sat on the swing.<br>
<br>
She closed her eyes and thought about the days that seemed long gone, back when he was at her side. It had been just two moons since she had last held his hand, feeling the warmth of his pulse emanate through the softness of his flesh. He was her one true love in all of the realm. They sang along to songs that were being played, and they both laughed at themselves at the silliness of it all. She would sit on the grass and watch him hone his skills, tumbling in the grass as he worked on his flying kicks. After each pass, he would smile at her sheepishly and she would mouth the words &quot;I LOVE YOU&quot; to him. Those glorious days after the last summer solstice were among the most delicious she had ever known.<br>
<br>
They had looked upon each other with loving eyes, trying to be modest in public although they were a bonded couple, yet never once trying to hold back their smiles. They spoke through their eyes when words could not be said, yet every chance they got he would come close to her side and speak to her in whispers. His eyes twinkled as he looked at her, and she would lower her eyes and her soft chime of a giggle could be heard accross the room. The world was as it should have been. Those days seemed so very long ago, yet only two moons have since passed...<br>
<br>
Pride had torn them both apart. She had endured much in her 57 seasons and he could see that her reserve was rather fragile. Long a champion to others' causes, she kept giving of herself so that others may smile. But she hardly smiled herself. Yet she trudged on, because that was all she knew. He had been through his own hardships in all his years of battle. Bound by duty and servitude, he had been self trained to hold himself back and keep a distance. Then she came along and he didn't quite know what to make of her. But he stuck to the only thing he knew.<br>
<br>
Yet it is impossible to fathom that in the span of one solstice, they had both abandoned their old habits and allowed themselvs to smile, allowed themselves to get close. Allowed themselves to BE. But it happened. Those were the most wonderful days the Gods and Goddesses of Norrath had ever granted them, ironic as it seemed for they both did not believe in their existence. But his indifference, coupled with her burnout, proved to be their ultimate downfall.<br>
<br>
Finally in the end, Innoruuk proved to be victorious. The seeds of doubt were planted, and much as they both relied on their own personal fortitude to see themselves through, they were mortal after all... and they faltered as mere mortals sometimes do. He could have been the silver spring to her golden sands... but instead all that was left was an abyss in an acrid and unrelenting desert. The stars in the nighttime sky grew dimmer, the heavens started weeping, and somewhere... somewhere, Innoruuk is smiling.<br>
<br>
She missed him terribly, but as each day passed the aching in her heart began to dull. She was learning to live on her own again as she'd done for so many years, and everyday her longing for him diminished.<br>
<br>
But the touch of his hand and the sound of his voice remained in her mind like a slow burning ember, and try as she might she could not shield herself from the heat. Not just yet.<br>
<br>
She relaxed in her seat and let the swing come to a rest when she felt a warm sensation lightly envelop her shoulders. He's here! She had thought. She stood up and looked around, expecting to see a warm and comforting face... but the stillness of the night in Kelethin was the only thing with her. Yes, she had only imagined it. Mirswith had not reached out to touch her.  <p><img src="http://notoriouskillers.com/jeisenne.gif">
