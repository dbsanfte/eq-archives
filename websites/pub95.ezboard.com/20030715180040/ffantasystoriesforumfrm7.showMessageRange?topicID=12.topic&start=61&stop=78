Her face was bright pink and she nearly tipped over. Thankfully, one of her friends caught her back and pushed her forward. The change in angle spilled her ale a little. She really needed to learn to not drink so much... but what was the fun in that! The mug was brought to her lips and down it went... all of it. She slammed the bottom down on the bar top rather loudly and laughed again. All that was left was foam slowly moving down the sides. She felt guilty leaving him* in the room... but he wasn't exactly in shape to go out, much less drink. But all thoughts of that vanished when the barkeep tossed another one her way. Hurray! What a great night, what a great night! <br>

I could easily see the sky and my songs were only that much clearer.&quot; Paren said as he walked up joining the party. &quot;But first good friend, finish that there wine and you'll be feeling much better.&quot; Smiling he took Hoku's beer and drank it before she could argue. He didn't think that she needed another one. &quot;Hoku with all your drunkeness, I believe you should lie down. I got a room if you want to use it? I know our own houses are so far away from here that it would be ridiculous tryig to walk back in your state, what do ya say? If you drink anymore I think I'll find myself dragging you up there.&quot; Paren smiled at her kindly.

WOOO!<br>
<br>
Airmid groaned as his shield connected with her side, the pain ripping through her slender body. Falling to ground, a single tear rolled down her cheek, she desperately tried to call on Marr to heal her wounds, but she was too distracted to concentrate her pleas. This was no way for a Prietess to die, in a sleeping city, before a tavern, and by the sword of her own brother.<br>
<br>
&quot;You can't handle it any more? Can you Airmid? Can you!&quot;<br>
<br>
William's sword struck down firmly inches from her body, she tried to conjure the strength in her arms to pull herself away, but she found herself pressed against a stone wall. <br>
<br>
&quot;Answer me!&quot;<br>
<br>
Sheathing his sword he came down on top of her, strattling her lap, and grabbing her shoulders. He shook her violently, coaxing an answer, and with each shake she was slammed fiercely against the wall. The tears were turning into sobs, and this only angered the young Paladin more. A sharp stinging sensation erupted over her cheek, and her cries stopped, Airmid's once lively, cerulean eyes, stared off to the right, dull, lifeless. <br>
<br>
A short laugh escaped William's mouth, &quot;And you call yourself a Priestess of Marr.&quot;<br>
<br>
The truth was, she was. Just like her mother, THEIR mother. In their father's honor William had became a Paladin, but since he was a young boy he had never valued honor and valor. Today it showed, he was not the caliber to which Marr's Knights needed to be. He was a virus which need to be stopped, <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Stop him now, my Child. I am here, I am watching over you...</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
A wave of Red hair obstructed William's view as she turned her head to face him abruptly. In one swift motion she kneed him in the groin, and threw him off of her. Raising a hand to the heavens, Airmid frowned upon her brother cowering, as her ocean occuli turned red, &quot;And you called yourself a Paladin...&quot;<br>

Her voice hung in the air, it was strong, and unfaltering a major shift from what she had presented herself like before. This was what she was, strong. This is how it has been and always were to be, a woman out to do Mithaniel's bidding, with his watchful eye basking on her.<br>
<br>
William looked up to the sky, that was quickly covering with the darkest clouds he had ever seen. Glancing towards his sister, he couldn't believe it. As their eyes met, her salmon lips mouthed a word of fare well...<br>
<br>
Crimson lightning struck down, illuminating the streets, the power to which Marr aided Airmid in was incredible, but it lead her to commit a large offense, Fratricide.<br>
<br>
Dropping to her knees, tears began to run down her cheeks, as the crimson brilliance faded from her heavenly eyes. Looking to the sky, &quot;Forgive me...&quot; Was all she could muster before she passed out.<br>

The sky, he could see the sky right now, he only hopped that the clouds would stay for just a little longer as he made his way to his clearing. The park where he gave his prayers to the sky. As he walked he thought he heard someone crying... he looked around. &quot;not your buisness Par..&quot; he said to himself. He walked aroiund a building anyways to find the source. he could have used a song but he decided that would be too impersonal. Coming on a girl, she sat on her knees sobbing. He looked to a dead body next to her... there were some resemblence, but not much left of the face to tell too well. &quot;What seems to be the problem lass?&quot; He said as politely as he could. &quot;I couldn't help but notice the crying, are you hurt?&quot; he asked as he saw blood on a near by wall and the rust red matting her hair. &quot;I could help if you wouldn't mind, could clear that bit of a headach I'm sure you have right up.&quot; His good mood could not be hindered, nor could his manners which he had learned as a bard. Opening up his flute case he decided that she was too disturbed over her brother's death to answer. Singing softly the upbeat tune, he didn't want to disturb her reverence. After the gash on the back of her head and some other bruices and scraps were gone, Paren smiled. THe girl was only snifling now. &quot;COme on dear, we'll find someone who can help, do you know anyone in this city?&quot;  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub95.ezboard.com/bfantasystoriesforum.showUserPublicProfile?gid=ryvian>Ryvian</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Warlord of Delnor</span><br>  Posts: 258<br> <font color=#FF0000>(5/7/03 4:14 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub95.ezboard.com/ffantasystoriesforumfrm7.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=12.topic&index=77>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> hey dead week</span><hr size=1> Hey guys I know from experience that it's getting close to dead week so I understand that you all are getting ready for exams and winding down the year, but hear me if you are not back after your school year ends I'll be very upset... not that I could do a whole lot to any of you, but that would mean the site would die and that would suck for me, (who has already been looking for a new home just in case) <br>

Her head throbbed with every pump of her heart and her body felt like jelly. But that jelly soon solidified as she sprinted as fast as she could to waste bucket to revisit whatever she had consumed last night. The taste was sour and bitter in her mouth and she spit after she was done vommiting. Thirty minutes she must have spent bent over that bucket, clutching her stomach as violent pains shot through her abdomin. This is what happened every time Hoku made friends with a glass. Her stomach eventually began to settle and her legs were once again weak and flimsy. Her feet shuffled their way to the vanity. She didn't bother to look in the mirror after sitting down, she knew the sight would be far from pretty. It was the water she sought. A pitcher of complimentary water with a glass stood on every Inn's vanity. Hoku sloppily poored herself a drink. ~gods damn... what in whoevers name possesed me to drink so damn much?~ <br>
The fuzziness of morning and her heavy hangover slowly began to slip away and she became more alert. Paren wasn't here... He was here last night... wasn't he? Yes, yes he was. Hmm... She sipped her water regularly and glanced idly around. Boots on the floor. Bags. Pants. Pillow. Backpac-PANTS?! How did her pants get on the floor?! She looked down at her legs to see skin! Those WERE her pants. On the floor!! ...but why. PAREN, that's why! that dirty snake!! All that Hoku had on was her shirt and undershorts. Thank god she at least had SOMETHING on. Why... if she wasn't so blasted this morning, she'd walk right outta here and beat the life outta that man!! But... she was pretty blasted... and walking just wasn't appealing. So... she'd wait till he got back to the room and... maybe yell at him for a bit... or at least raise her voice a little. Whichever worked out first.<br>

Bren was said to have left sometime in the early morning and the rest sort of left after he did. Hoku still hadn't come down. What was eatting at her so much to make her drink that much last night? Well he figured he'd go and wake her up to find out. Telling the girl to wait for him, he started up the stairs. Stopping at the door he sighed heavily and ran his hand through his hair once. Opening the door slowly he peeked it. The door slammed shut smacking him in the face, not before the boot had caught him square. &quot;GOD DAMNIT HOKU!!!!!!!!!&quot; He shouted as he kicked in the door. <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top">  Page <a href=http://pub95.ezboard.com/ffantasystoriesforumfrm7.showMessageRange?topicID=12.topic&start=1&stop=20>1</a><a href=http://pub95.ezboard.com/ffantasystoriesforumfrm7.showMessageRange?topicID=12.topic&start=21&stop=40>2</a><a href=http://pub95.ezboard.com/ffantasystoriesforumfrm7.showMessageRange?topicID=12.topic&start=41&stop=60>3</a> <b>4</b>  </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub95.ezboard.com/ffantasystoriesforumfrm7.showNextMessage?topicID=12.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a self href=http://pub95.ezboard.com/ffantasystoriesforumfrm7.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=12.topic&index=78><img src=http://Auction.2y.net/user/paradisetheheretic/addreply.jpg border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub95.ezboard.com/ffantasystoriesforumfrm7.emailToFriend?topicID=12.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub95.ezboard.com/ffantasystoriesforumfrm7.threadControl?topicID=12.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/professional/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands</a><br> <a href=http://pub95.ezboard.com/ffantasystoriesforumfrm7.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=12.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/ultimate/subscribe.gif width=20 height=20 border=0 alt="Click to receive email notification of replies"> Click to receive email notification of replies</a> <br>  <a href=http://pub95.ezboard.com/ffantasystoriesforumfrm7.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=12.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/ultimate/unsubscribe.gif width=20 height=20 border=0 alt="Click to stop receiving email notification of replies"> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies</a> <br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub95.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="fantasystoriesforumfrm1">General Fantasy Stories<option value="fantasystoriesforumfrm2">EverQuest Stories<option value="fantasystoriesforumfrm11">Fantasy Inspired Art<option value="fantasystoriesforumfrm14">Fantasy Inspired Poetry<option value="fantasystoriesforumfrm7">Role Playing Forum<option value="fantasystoriesforumfrm3">Suggestions for FSF<option value="fantasystoriesforumfrm4">Off-Topic Discussions<option value="fantasystoriesforumfrm12">Polls:  Off-Topic and Otherwise<option value="fantasystoriesforumfrm5">Stories by:  Paradise Perdu<option value="fantasystoriesforumfrm6">Stories by:  Bellona Kali<option value="fantasystoriesforumfrm8">Stories by:  Mindles Kali<option value="fantasystoriesforumfrm9">Stories by:  Ryvian<option value="fantasystoriesforumfrm10">Stories by:  Dahnyella Sylvanblitz<option value="fantasystoriesforumfrm15">Stories by:  Shoken</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#FF0000>- </font><a href=http://pub95.ezboard.com/bfantasystoriesforum>Fantasy Stories Forum</a><font color=#FF0000> - </font><a href=http://pub95.ezboard.com/ffantasystoriesforumfrm7>Role Playing Forum</a> <font color=#FF0000> - </font><br><br><table border=0 align=center><tr><td align=center><a href="http://login.ezboard.com/BBSSystem.showUserPaymentScreen" target="_blank">Upgrade your account to ezSupporter...</a></td><td><img src="http://www.ezboard.com/image/spacer.gif" width=15 height=1 border=0></td><td align=center><a href="http://login.ezboard.com/BBSSystem.showUserPaymentScreen" target="_blank">...and never see another ad or pop-up again</a></td></tr></table><CENTER><!-- START BOTTOM AD SCRIPT -->
