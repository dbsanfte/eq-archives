Supposedly it does, in most cases. But there are situations when time crawls. Sitations that do not wish to end, no matter how much the people want them to. Wether it is fate or design, it is often the young that notice, while the old create them. Odd thoughts for a bonedancer with no children of her own. Still, in the darkness of her chambers, it is these thoughts that occupy her mind when the messenger arrives.<br>
<br>
'I bring news from the Bard, Mistress. He has withdrawn.' She looks up, hiding her surprise behind a rare smile. 'So he has withdrawn ? Do you know his exact words, or is this just a rumor. He reaches for his pocket and pulls out a parchment. 'I have long considered my application to your hall, after learning of the pain my application has caused. I understand fully your desire to speakthis through, and come up with a sollution for the greater good of the family, and i also understand that it is likely that my application would be accepted. I am, however, a prideful man, and cannot acept that knowing as i do the pain my acceptance would bring, despite any greater good caused by it. Hence, I withdraw my application. This does...' The messenger got no further with his recitation. 'Likely his application would be accepted ? Who in Innoruuk's name does he think he is ?' She was livid with rage. 'That Bard.. stepping back with a false claim of caring for the pain his application brought ? Did he not listen. Did he not ask before applying ? Or did he.. '<br>
<br>
She stared at the messenger, who had stepped back to the door. He was afraid to stay, but also afraid to go without being dismissed. Other messengers had told tales of some who had come out of her chambers only to wither and die within hours of displeasing her. 'Go, you are dismissed.' she snarled and turned away from him. With a sigh of relief, he left her chambers and closed the door. She could hear his steps racing through the hallway.<br>
<br>
She sits back, pondering the words again. So he had been sure that there would be some form of acceptance - that the Officers would decide in favour of inviting him in despite her reservations. Was he right ? That young necromancer who asked to be relieved seemed to have accepted the tale he was given. At least he had not yet returned his badge. In the end, she rises from her chair and gets ready to leave, when she hears another knock at the door. Still irritated from the news, she snarls 'Yes ?', and a meek voice from the other side replies 'There is another message, Mistress. It is not signed, i was told that you would recognize the sender'. So she bids him to enter, and he places the parchment in her hand.<br>
<br>
'Did the one who brought this wait for a reply ?' The messenger shakes his head. 'No, he gave it to me and asked me to hand it to you. I have a similar one for your sister, but she is not awake yet. 'Leave that one with me too. I will ensure she will get it.' The messenger senses the dismissal in her voice. Without hesitation, he hands her the other missive, and then leaves her to read them. Two plain rolled parchments, wrapped with a thin, black cords in her hand, she sits down. A closer inspection reveals a small plaque on both. One reads 'Si'leth', the other reads 'Le'leth'. Both are stamped with a seal she recognizes immediately. It is what she had least expected to see just here - A seal from one of Neriak's more prominent families. With a sense of dread, she unrolls the one adressed to Si'leth, and starts to read.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr><br>
Daughter of mine,<br>
<br>
I am aware that you do not exect to hear from me. But times are changing, and this ruse cannot be allowed to continue. The plans your father had are unraveling, and your presence is required. Our control over the your sisters husband is slipping. The skills you have honed in hiding from your destiny are now needed to bring him back under the control of the family. The stakes are now higher than ever. While we thought we might spare Le'leth from a life in the shadows, she too must now come and stand at Na'leths side. There will be no doubts as to your loyalties when you stand behind her, even the blundering fool will then heed her wishes.<br>
<br>
Do not mistake me, Si'leth. This is no summoning, but a request only. Still, i am rather certain that you will understand the importance of the situation, and react accordingly. Your father and i expect to see your sister and yourself at the reception held to celebrate the birth of the family heir in three weeks time.<br>
<br>
Please, Si'leth, do not let this opportunity pass. Your father would be very put out, and i am not sure what his reaction might be.<br>
<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
The missive was not signed, but she recognizes the hand that wrote it. Her mother always had a way with words which she herself tried to emulate. Still, the missive does brings no smile on her face. Long has she dreaded the day when she would have to face the house again. And although it was never mentioned, the threat was surely there. Her father would not send a missive. He would ensure their attendance.<br>
<br>
She paces through the room, reading the missive over and over again. Vain is the hope that it would change, but it does no such thing. The request to return is still in her hand when she finally settles on the furs that cover the marble slab she rests on each night. Slowly, it slips from her fingers as she lies back. Memories of the past assault her. Memories of events she thought left behind years ago.<br>
<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em><br>
Lanterns and candles cast enchanting light into the great hall that night. Guests aplenty were walking between the high columns, filling the air with the quiet murmur of pleasant conversation. The walls were still decorated with thorned vines. Red and white blossoms dotted the dark foilage, and their scent still lingered in the hall. The music long since had stopped since the minstrels were finally allowed to mingle with the remaining guests.. and the servants. <br>
<br>
The young girl was hidden in a small alcove, watching them. Her mother had prepared the alcove in secret, as she had been too young to attend such a feast. Her father would have never stood for it, but there were things to learn here. So she watched and listened. Most of the more honorable guests had long since retreated, as had the bride and groom. She was watching the guests fade into oblivion due to too much drink.<br>
<br>
Oblivious to the watcher, a minstrel prances in front of the serving maid. 'Come, lass' he coos, bringing an odd kind of smile into her face. 'Why, dear bard, should i come ? I have work to do still' is her reply. But she does not walk away. 'Ah, my dear.. you might have things that need doing.. but i have things that need showing. And i think you are the one to show to.' With these words, he starts singing. A soft ballad, almost drowning in the noise of the ebbing feast. The girl leans close, listening to the song. Soon, she is lost in the tale spun, and freely takes the wine the minstrel offers her. 'There, lass, take a sip. You shouldnt just serve all night. Now, it is your time to be served.' Without stopping the music, he leads her towards a small alcove. The leaves that decorate the wall almost make it seem like a secluded place in the woods.<br>
<br>
Here, he settles down, still playing his alluring song. Wether it is the song, the tale, the wine or just the cozy spot matters little. Soon, she leans her head against the bard's chest and caresses his hair lightly while he plays a new, softer tune. From time to time, he turns to whisper sweet promises of love into her ears, and her eyes light up. Finally, a man who appreciates her beauty. One who sees that she is so much more than just another servant. In the end, she leans in close and whispers 'shouldnt we leave the halls, dear ? Someone might see us.', but the bard shakes his head. 'No, my blossom, the plants here hide us. They even muffle the sounds, so worry not.' He was right. The sounds from the hall had dimmed into a murmur, and she felt secure, suddenly, and leaned in for a long kiss.<br>
<br>
Still unaware of the young girl watching them, the bard reaches for the clasps that held her dress and undoes them. She does not resist his touch, instead she becomes more and more desperate to touch him herself, and soon the two bodies were so entwined with each other that it was impossible to tell them apart.  <br>
<br>
In her hiding place, Si'leth is still watching, both fascinated and horrified by what she sees. Through the mix of fascination, excitement, embarrassment and horror,  a small part of her mind starts wondering. 'Now where is the danger in this. Why was mother so insitant that i watched this way.' Confusion reigns supreme in the young girls mind. The odd signals her body sends to her mind do not help with that. Alike an itch she cannot reach, she is assaulted with sensations she never felt before. Torn between disgust and curiosity, but still unable to look away she watches the two. But as the night grows late, it is the horror that wins over the confusion as the sounds change from those of pleasure to those of distress and pain.<br>
<br>
She was unaware of it at first. Their lovemaking had been passionate and fulfilling for her, but now the former soft touch of the bard has become demanding. His soft hold on her has become a vice like grip, and she winced in pain. Still, he would not relent, forcing himself onto her again and again. She started screaming, and tried to fend him off, but her arms were weak compared to his, and her intoxication hampered her defenses. Noone heeded the screams, if anyone heard them to begin with, and so she had to pay the price for becoming involved with the bard.<br>
<br>
Hours later, he finally let go of her. Pushing her off without much of a word, he rises. Her screams have long turned into moans and whimpers. 'Dear blossom, i think i shall take my leave now. I have pressing business outside the city, and do not dare linger.' She heard the contempt in his voice, but was too numb to react. She just sat there, clutching her torn dress to her body as he walks off. <br>
<br>
She still sat there when the other servants came to remove the decorations in the next morning. Noone made any comments to her state. They simply gathered  her up and brought her away.<br>
<br>
Still, Si'leth was watching. Her fascination had turned to horror long ago. Still, she knew that she could not do a thing. The spell her mother had placed on her hiding place allowed her to see and hear, it did not allow for them to hear her. And it was painfully obvious that alerting other guests was pointless. They had heard the screams allright. But different from her, they had laughed and joked about them. Apparently, nothing was wrong in their eyes. Even the other servants reaction prove that all was fine. So this was the darker side of what her mother had called wanton lust.<br>
</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
Silenae stirred on the marble bed. But she did not fully wake from the memories. Instead, they skipped forward. There had been several similar situations in the days that followed Na'Leth's wedding. It seemed that her mother wanted her to see and hear about this. What was odd waas that the end was always simiar. It always turned brutal, and never did anyone show the slightest hint of compassion for the girls. still she did not walke from the dream.<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em><br>
Days passed.. weeks even, and she had almost forgotten the incident when she came into the hall one afternoon. Her father was there. He clearly was displeased with something. She could hear it in the tone of his voice. Of course he was calm. She had never heard him shout, not once. Instead, his voice became cold and sharp when something displeased him.<br>
<br>
'What are we to do with you, wench ?', he asked of someone Si'leth could not see. 'You had a good place here, tending the guests, serving at the tables. But now, how will you do this ?'<br>
She heard a whimper, and assumed it came from the woman he spoke to. She too seemed aware of his anger, but unable to answer either of his questions. Both had not yet noticed her. Her father never allowed her to see when he dealt with unpleasant things. But he hint of a smile on her mothers face made her think. This was no accident. Her mother had summoned her to hear this.<br>
<br>
'How could you be so stupid, girl, to get pregnant on that day, of all days. The whole city will gossip about this. Your folly will cost the family dearly. It has already cost me a good serving maid.' Sobs came from the scolded girl, and Si'leth remembered her. That was the girl she had seen that night after her sisters wedding. The one which had been with the bard.<br>
<br>
Her mother motioned for her to come closer, and her father forced his expression to the calm mask she was used to. 'Go, lass, and worry not. There will be a sollution for this impossible situation.', he said to the girl, which scrambled up and almost ran from the hall. Before she reached the door, Si'leths father whispered something to his personal guard. She was sure that he did not intend for her to overhear this, and so she forced herself to remain calm. 'Take care of this for me. Ensure her secrecy.'<br>
<br>
Before Si'leth had reached the table, the guard had already left, following the former maid. It was hard for her not to show that she had heard. Somehow, the world seemed a little colder now. 'Oh, Si'leth. It is good that you come.', her father told her. His voice was free of any irritation or anger now. 'Your mother and i have made a decision, and i would like to hear what you think of it.'. He glanced at her mother, and she added 'Your father and i think it would be best if we would start your training soon, so we have spoken with an emissary from the tower of the spurned. They are willing to accept you as an apprentice wizard. What do you think about this ?'<br>
<br>
Si'leth was still numb, pondering the fate of the servant, so all she managed was to nod wordlessly. 'Is that all you have to say, my daughter ? Please tell me what you think. It took all her self control to keep the fear from her voice when she replied 'I am honored, father, that you have chosen a path of magic for me.' It was not the first time she had bent the truth when asked by her father. Usually, he had spotted it, and she silently prayed to Innoruuk that he would let it pass, this time. She did not want to think of the consequences should he guess that wizardry was not quite what she desired.<br>
<br>
It seemed as if Innoruuk was with her, this night, since her father did not show if he noticed. He just smiled. 'This is indeed a great honor, my daughter. I am certain you will work hard to prove worth it. The representative from the tower will come on your birthday to accept your vow of service.' The news struck her like a blow. Just a few weeks, and then they would send her off to the tower, to learn an art she had absolutely no interest in. Wizardry was so cut dry. And the path would be clear too. Once she finished the studies, they would return her to the family, to serve in her sisters shadow. This could not be. Feeling numb, she nodded to her father, and then made a short bow and and meekly asked to be allowed to return to her chambers. After a short nod of dismissal, she stumbled towards her room.<br>
</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
Silenae stirred on her marble bed. In the hours that followed the revellation, her mother had deemed it wise to explain things to her. In cold words, she had explained that what she had witnessed at her sisters wedding was how the minstrels used the myth of love to find willing victims to fill their lust. And that what her father had done was nothing but the conclusion of this act. She had not left any doubt on the future of the maid. She would have to live in shame, her child hidden away until it came of age, when it would be sent away to recieve training. <br>
<br>
Of course, she had not accepted the tale. Not then, anyhow. But she had been more attentiative then. After each celebration, a certain number of maids had become pregnant, and soon after were 'dismissed' in the same fashion. It had taken her years to find out exactly what happened to the maids. Apparently, none of the children were ever born, and none of the maids ever returned to Neriak. <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top"> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub95.ezboard.com/fharvestersofdarknessfrm8.showPrevMessage?topicID=142.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub95.ezboard.com/fharvestersofdarknessfrm8.showNextMessage?topicID=142.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a self href=http://pub95.ezboard.com/fharvestersofdarknessfrm8.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=142.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/space/addReply.gif border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub95.ezboard.com/fharvestersofdarknessfrm8.emailToFriend?topicID=142.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub95.ezboard.com/fharvestersofdarknessfrm8.threadControl?topicID=142.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/space/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands</a><br> <a href=http://pub95.ezboard.com/fharvestersofdarknessfrm8.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=142.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/ultimate/subscribe.gif width=20 height=20 border=0 alt="Click to receive email notification of replies"> Click to receive email notification of replies</a> <br>  <a href=http://pub95.ezboard.com/fharvestersofdarknessfrm8.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=142.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/ultimate/unsubscribe.gif width=20 height=20 border=0 alt="Click to stop receiving email notification of replies"> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies</a> <br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub95.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="harvestersofdarknessfrm1">Announcements<option value="harvestersofdarknessfrm11">Recruitment<option value="harvestersofdarknessfrm8">Public Roleplay area<option value="harvestersofdarknessfrm7">OOC area<option value="harvestersofdarknessfrm16">The Twilight Harvest<option value="harvestersofdarknessfrm9">Members forum<option value="harvestersofdarknessfrm10">HoD Events<option value="harvestersofdarknessfrm12">HoD Vault<option value="harvestersofdarknessfrm15">Harvester Histories<option value="harvestersofdarknessfrm13">IC Officer's Forum<option value="harvestersofdarknessfrm14">OOC Officer's Forum<option value="harvestersofdarknessfrm17">closet</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#A8A8A8>- </font><a href=http://pub95.ezboard.com/bharvestersofdarkness>Harvesters of Darkness</a><font color=#A8A8A8> - </font><a href=http://pub95.ezboard.com/fharvestersofdarknessfrm8>Public Roleplay area</a> <font color=#A8A8A8> - </font><br><br><table border=0 align=center><tr><td align=center><a href="http://login.ezboard.com/BBSSystem.showUserPaymentScreen" target="_blank">Upgrade your account to ezSupporter...</a></td><td><img src="http://www.ezboard.com/image/spacer.gif" width=15 height=1 border=0></td><td align=center><a href="http://login.ezboard.com/BBSSystem.showUserPaymentScreen" target="_blank">...and never see another ad or pop-up again</a></td></tr></table><CENTER><!-- START BOTTOM AD SCRIPT -->
