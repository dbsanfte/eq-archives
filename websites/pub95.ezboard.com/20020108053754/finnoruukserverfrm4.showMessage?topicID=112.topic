<br>
I'd like to clarify something.<br>
<br>
Basically, we felt that given the sparcity of reservations, that a reservation should represent at least 18 people.  Under the old system, a guild with 7 people could make a reservation and invite 25 guests -- unguilded, a few from a lot of guilds, or whatever.<br>
<br>
Under the new system, a guild with less than 18 people can still go to the planes.  However, they will need to ally with one or more other guilds.<br>
<br>
Horizons has been doing this all along.  Our planar raids have been scheduled with Sigils and Trade Foundation.  Note that between the three guilds, not every guild is sending 7 or more people, but we consider them joint raids regardless.  In the past, Horizons did the actual bookings, but neither Sigils nor Trade Foundation scheduled any raids of their own.<br>
<br>
The reality is -- you're not going to the planes with 5 or 10 people -- you're already allying with other people to make your raids a success.  By changing the requirements, you will now need to formalize these arrangements.<br>
<br>
While this does increase the difficulty of scheduling your raids, I happen to feel it's fair.<br>
<br>
If anyone wishes to discuss this with me, feel free to contact me.  I don't recommend you try me in game -- I played a lot this weekend, but probably won't be on for the next few days.  Feel free to respond here or email me: admin@innoruuk.com.<br>

Why is there a member attendance requirement at all? If RR wishes to reserve a booking, or TD, or XYZZY, why not let them? If they can't assemble a large enough force, then their slot can revert to FFA/FiF.<br>
But gee, that might waste a reserved booking period for another, bigger guild that could use the time to get their members phat lewts.<br>

Let's say RR has the 18 necessary. But someone doesn't show up, or has to leave early, or there's a miscommunication and there's a wipeout, or Verant has played with the spawns... How is it different when a guild books a raid, and is wiped out, and when a guild books a raid, and is wiped out? Or are you saying the number restriction is an attempt to limit the number of guilds making bookings in the first place?<br>
Okay, what about my first question? How would two smaller guilds booking the planes work? I mean, if each one can book a day, that's two days they've occuppied in the schedule, even though neither guild can handle a plane alone. What are you saving with the 18 rule if it can be bypassed this way?<br>
<br>
The above's not argument, it's questions. I'm asking questions. I'm hoping for answers. It's ridiculous that I have to emphasize this; sometimes a cigar is just a cigar.<br>

So the idea is to limit the number of reservations in some way so that the bigger guilds get more chances at planes loot than they would otherwise have. This may not be a concern, with the new rule about guild cooperation. <br>

If a Guild with 70 people followed the rules, they would get their 2 bookings a month.  If 7 Guilds with 10 people booked the Planes and went up together, potentially you would have 14 bookings a month.  Though I think the amount of abuse of the previous rules was a whole lot smaller then some of the big guilds claimed, it could be exploited.  <br>
<br>
And lets be honest.  Most Guilds of 10-20 people aren't full of L60's.  Most L60's want to be doing ToV and Dain and other Boss MOB's that require more people then that.  I'm sure someone is gonna say otherwise, but I sincerely doubt a Guild of 15 people is gonna be balanced and high-level enough to break and clear the Planes.  15 people could do it, but usually with inviting friends and stuff you end up lacking in some classes with the smaller Guilds.<br>
<br>
How about we make a new rule then Aldrin?  Nobody that is not part of the booking Guild can go on days that are scheduled.  That way you can screw over the unguilded even more.  Lots of Guilds have been doing joint bookings, but you know if you keep this up long enough you can make it even harder for the unguilded to get a chance to go to the Planes, WTG.  I'm not seeing any other unguilded people on here flaming, because they make friends and probably get to go to the Planes more then quite a few of the people in Guilds do.

Of course it's bad if you leave it at that, and that wasn't my proposal, either. How about having a rule whereby if you don't need something from a plane (specifically, epic drops) you don't go? That's silly, but here's the situation as I see it from what's been argued in the past:<br>
The big guilds want epics for their members.<br>
The smaller guilds also want epics, but also want some of the other drops<br>
But not everybody in every guild is going to need his epic drop at the same time, are they? Some will have it already, some won't need it for awhile... So why should, say, all of TD, or even half, have to occupy a plane, even if they allow guests? You've set up a calendar for assigning the plane, how about a system whereby those in the various guilds who need epic drops and are at a point where they need them go on raids with those in other guilds who need epic drops and are where they need them? While the rest of the guilds go play in places they'd rather be at anyway? True, an epic drop won't drop for every person who wants one every time, but that's not guaranteed with a guild raid, either. <br>
<br>
Rather than dismissing this idea, think about ways it could be made to work, or problems that would have to be addressed for it to work. And *then* tell me what a load of dingo's kidneys it is.... AND WHY.<br>

Not all guilds are at the same time zone. So they will not start it's raids at the same time. That guild i'm playing with invites guest to take left over drops.

Look, I will acknowledge you raise some valid questions - however they are buried underneath a whole bunch of hyperbole and braggadocio.  You'll find that folks will listen to you more and show you more respect when you learn to listen to others and control your outbursts.<br>
<br>
Please just be silent on this.  You had your chance to voice your opinion during the Summit and squandered it by not listening and ranting.  Summit 3 is done and to be honest it's a pretty good compromise.  We will be revisiting the Summit in January to fine-tune it.  You can list your questions then, though I doubt you will be invited to participate.<br>
<br>
If you take this as a personal attack, that's too bad.  It's not.  I'm just tired of seeing this discussion become tit-for-tat.  Thanks.<br>

Both guilds use a booking each for the same raid.<br>
<br>
I'm wondering about the logistics nightmare of keeping track of who currently needs what epic piece from what plane at what time?  <br>
<br>
And, I guess we're the weirdos.  Our epic loot rules are the same as regular loot rules.  If you are on the raid, and you need it, you random with everyone else who can.  We don't do set-asides.  Oddly, many of our guests talk it over privately.  I'm reminded of three rogues in Hate with us who decided amongst themselves who was most &quot;needy&quot;.  The other two passed on the random.  In our eyes, that makes all three people more &quot;epic&quot; than some twinkling doodad VI cooked up.  THAT is &quot;uber&quot;.<br>
<br>
We can do the 18 to book requirement, barely.  We can also do the 12 up there requirement, IF it's a good night for all our folks.  That will be our crapshoot nowadays.  But, then again, if no enchanters show up, and none are available, I declare it FFA too.  We will have less raids then we did.  We will have to work harder to keep them.  But, our lives in Norrath don't revolve around a plane, an epic piece of garbage, or a game.  <br>
<br>
Will some cheat?  Were some cheating before?  To say it wasn't proven doesn't prove it wasn't happening.  Actually, Aldrin mentioned on our Hate raid that a &quot;/who Plane of Hate all&quot; would be a good thing, good idea.  But, realize there is no enforcement possible.  Verant doesn't give a rat's patoot.  It's all about honor, and we can only hope karma applies.<br>
<br>
The Ridgerunners will honor this Summit as we have all of them.  We don't accept WE WANT IT AND WE WANT IT NOW as a valid option for us.  We don't accept &quot;Others cheat so we can&quot; as a valid option for us.  That's for others to do. <br>

<br>
I think what you'll see in the future is that smaller guilds will get more actively involved in alliances.  You'll see posts on Inny.com.  &quot;SmallGuildA looking to form alliance with other small guilds to do planes.&quot;<br>
<br>
I think this is a good thing.  I LOVE the relationship that Unnatural Force formed with Sleeping Giant and Sigils.  It went so well, UF and SG merged to become Horizons.  In doing so, we inherited from the SG folks the relationship with Trade Foundation -- also a great group of people.  And lately, Malus Malorum has been heavily involved in our raids.<br>
<br>
By forcing guilds to dual- (or tri- or quad-) book their raids, I think it'll make the relationships richer for everyone.  Yes, it's more work.  But I do think it'll result in an equitable access to the planes.<br>
<br>
10 people shouldn't have the same access that 75 people do.  That's greedy.<br>

There's strength in numbers, and might makes right.<br>
Please, Wolfypaw, your hypocracy is showing.<br>

Please cease these mischaracterizations directed at me. They border on ad-hominem attacks.<br>
Your opinions of my intent are opinions, not fact. <br>
I'll strike a bargain with  you; you delete the content of your messages wherein you imply that I wish to start rant-wars, and I'll delete my responses, and will post in your summit threads nevermore. <br>
<br>
(it's a comprimise. You're big on comprimise, aren't you?)<br>

PS - SOMEBODY surely kept a log of the summit meeting? Could they *please* post a copy of it in the rants section, so that everyone can see what an immature and disruptive person I was in that meeting? <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub95.ezboard.com/uhiraghm.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Hiraghm</A> at: 10/30/01 12:54:09 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#f7f7f7><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub95.ezboard.com/ubonestriker.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Bonestriker</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Scowling Poster</span><br>  Posts: 11<br> <font color=#778899>(10/30/01 4:17:01 pm)</font><br>     <br>Community Supporter<br> <BR><img src=http://jayhawks.net/~watts/Images/Bonestriker_portrait.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Summit Clarification: Small Guilds</span><hr size=1> Wolfypaw posted a log the next day.

<br>
gah <br>
spam my ass. I just figured out how to speak on this thing 8c( <br>
hey, I charge for that <br>
*** Aldrin is now known as [AoN]Aldrin <br>
I don't play the drums 8c( <br>
I'm here representing the Alliance of Nonconformists (reformed) <br>
hgus Skawwagwim. <br>
I oppose total FFA unless I'm frequently and generously bribed. <br>
this is the discussion of the Summit, so I assume those opposed are trying to be represented too <br>
*raises hand* <br>
Aldrin opposes FiF <br>
Wolfypaw, I already said I opposed FiF<br>
so the FiF issue is moot. I oppose it. So no FiF 8c) <br>
yeah, that is a good point.<br>
&lt;-- favors 2-3 days a week FFA, ... ALWAYS on the weekend<br>
well, RR is wrong. <br>
Wolfypaw, I have a question <br>
nope.. Emperor by right of conquest...<br>
Wolfypaw.. if we have partial FFA... and partial booked <br>
what's to keep TD and NA from overruning the planes on the FFA days? <br>
wait a minute WAIT A MINUTE! <br>
that's not fair. I asked a question. <br>
don't ask me one back Idon't know the answer to 8c( <br>
(sorry, fingers are greasy from kentucky fried) <br>
okay then.. so there's no point to FFA or FiF<br>
so how you gonna keep them from overrunning a BOOKED day? <br>
this is the 21st century.<br>
this IS a chatroom<br>
/vetos that idea<br>
depends on the details <br>
SH <br>
let Ristourette FINISH<br>
(puts on spam boots) SH! Ristourette was talking <br>
Martin Luther King, Ghandi...<br>
that's why I brought em up 8c) <br>
I think Ristourette is suggesting the creation of a permanent committee <br>
let's all leave now and fight for the planes, howzat? <br>
okay, specifics... guilds are evil. abolish all guilds and go FFA on the planes. Now, who's buying? <br>
Chancellor D'izok <br>
not true. I will. I just haven't seen a big enough bribe yet 8c) <br>
most want a mix <br>
whew. I was turning blue <br>
my time is worthless, ask anyone <br>
who will represent the unguilded in such a committee? <br>
yes <br>
I have an answer to that <br>
you won't like it<br>
*** Hiraghm_ has joined #tavern <br>
weekends for FFA <br>
weekdays for booked<br>
tuesday night between 11:15 and 11:23 for TD and NA 8c) <br>
I can take potshots at TD and NK if I want... I've stood up for them enough in the past. <br>
I wonder when people will realise that I'm being generous by attending<br>
next question please <br>
*handy hand* <br>
I vote maybe <br>
*handy hand* <br>
could you please answer Ristorette's question? The answer will affect my opinion of FFA/booked timing<br>
including respawn? <br>
I mean, how long should it take to clear the plane? <br>
then add 8 hours to that? <br>
there's also the problem that more people will be playing the game on weekends than during the week. not really fair to restrict that time to a comparatively small group <br>
I'll shut up now for awhile <br>
should be 22 hour or 27 hour or some such so you get rollover. <br>
* Hiraghm_ tests emote system <br>
gah! Virc is a piece of jonque <br>
*handy hand* <br>
* Hiraghm_ uses his hands to make shadowpuppets <br>
FFA yes, FiF when hell sports ice skating rinks<br>
36 hour would be good, btw. I like Necarus' idea of having part of a month FFA and part Booked <br>
I think we should vote on that. <br>
I can't emote <br>
Hiraghm_ so I have to emote for me <br>
* Hiraghm_ points out that the Alliance of Nonconformists is the largest guild in the game<br>
ALLOW? <br>
*handy hand* <br>
mutter.. sec <br>
I'd also like to address the question of guilds inviting unguilded players to join their raids... limits on numbers, etc etc <br>
something to encourage this, especially among the smaller guilds is A Good Thing, I think. And will affect the raid schedule, and FFA status <br>
[KH]Ristorette I did but I forgot the #tavern and it ate it 8c( <br>
blah <br>
* Hiraghm_ beats Skallagrim with a dead flounder <br>
*handy hand* <br>
*handy hand* <br>
*handy hand* <br>
*handy hand* <br>
*handy hand* <br>
dammit... <br>
NO FFA OR FIF AT ALL <br>
*handy hand* <br>
I just realised something, dang it. *HANDY HAND* <br>
I PROPOSE A NEW SYSTEM WHEREBY 10 DAYS ARE RESERVED FOR TD AND NK AND THE REST IS BOOKED; BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT YOU'LL GET WITH FFA/FIF <br>
I've been to fear several times. <br>
I'll be civil, but I'm not going to sit quietly by while you lot @#%$ the unguilded while only worrying about what's best for your guild (as TD and NK have been accused of doing) <br>
FIF == more reserved days for TD and NK <br>
* Hiraghm_ is away: (Auto-Away after 10 mins) [BX-MsgLog On] <br>
it won't happen <br>
* Hiraghm_ Remember Versailles <br>
*handy hand* <br>
I propose that the 1st through the 12th of the month are BOOKED raids for PUBLIC events. Anyone can reserve them, and anyone can attend, and looting is OPEN......<br>
and that from the 13th through the end of the month is strictly booked for the guilds, with restricted drop rules. <br>
wolfypaw, my last comment was dead serious<br>
what is so unreasonable about it? <br>
does it require further explanation? <br>
WHY? <br>
&quot;public&quot; includes guilded, non-guilded, and whoever else. <br>
*hand* <br>
*hand* <br>
GAH.. my message got eaten <br>
I propose we reserve 10 days a month for tD and NK and any other guild over a given size to get their epics and their twink's epics and the rest of the month belongs to smaller guilds <br>
because my sincere attempts and addressing the *problem* while still looking for the interests of the unguilded was hooted down? <br>
[SE]Bulwvyn I made one earlier and was dismissed out of hand 8c( <br>
[HK]Ristourette I see why you compare this to a legislature, btw. <br>
month <br>
fortnight <br>
because Verant thinks that the players don't know what they want. <br>
*hand* <br>
i second the motion <br>
no <br>
and who succeeded in killing the desired mobs? <br>
Moosen.. they all have twinks! <br>
that doesn't matter.. once their mains get their epics, pretty soon their twinks will want them <br>
you do the math.. 7 twinks per member <br>
okay, I'll third<br>
and I'm gonna take your benevolent word on that Jadex? <br>
no <br>
come to think of it, that's limiting them to one account apiece.. if any have two accounts, that's another 8 twinks <br>
yeah, I'm the bad guy for recognizing reality. Oh well, you'll find out, won't you <br>
Aldrin was kicked by [TFC]Xaria (Please.. either be productive or leave ) <br>
*** Hiraghm has joined #tavern<br>
what are we voting on now? <br>
*** Hiraghm is now known as Aldrin <br>
2 <br>
trust but verify<br>
*** Aldrin has quit IRC (Connection reset by peer ) <br>
*** Hiraghm has joined #tavern <br>
*** Hiraghm is now known as Aldrin <br>
of course everyone will. <br>
Aldrin reminds [TFC] never to step into Fear on a FFA day <br>
oops <br>
* Aldrin reminds [TFC]Xaria not to step into Fear on a FFA day <br>
is this a good or bad thing, Taleras? <br>
* Aldrin snorts <br>
* Aldrin wasn't surprised by that one <br>
are they going to make their decision based upon feelings or thoughts, Wolfypaw? <br>
I'd like to suggest saturday-sunday <br>
this is for the days of the week that will be FFA/FiF? 4 <br>
4 <br>
no fractions please <br>
everyone who's not in a planar guild <br>
the unguilded. <br>
(if you'd read the message board, you'd see my mention of it there) <br>
then it's 3 <br>
* Aldrin looks at Taleras, completely puzzled<br>
no <br>
yes I do NOT like mon-wed or tue-thu <br>
* Aldrin sighs <br>
why do you people jump from not-like to hate? <br>
I vote sat-sun <br>
I have a question when the vote is finished <br>
why doesn't anyone want to make sat-sun FFA when there will be more people able to play? <br>
they're not always on weekends are they? Is Verant that stupid? <br>
Okay okay I understand now. concession to the superpowers. <br>
btw, Jadex, Bonestriker answered your earlier comment <br>
I have yet another of my silly proposals when there's a pause for breath <br>
someone earlier said that we should all write Verant, and I agree, but the message should simply say, &quot;would you rather have 15000 players on a server, or 150? Yours truly...&quot; <br>
2 FFA <br>
FiF wins <br>
FiF does have one thing going for it... the smaller guilds will be wanting to fatten their numbers to be FiF..so they'll be more likely to invite outsiders... <br>
I change my vote to 2FiF <br>
#define early? <br>
sh, wolfypaw, don't be dissin the superpowers <br>
they have players on different PLANETS than the normal guilds <br>
the first member of a guild with more than 121 members constitutes FiF <br>
it was civil. you don't like that idea? <br>
question, Skallagrim.. what constitutes a group? <br>
I mean in your definition of FiF, what constitutes a group? <br>
it's a shame you can't do a /who all Hate or /who all Fear <br>
second <br>
FFA <br>
what if they're anon? <br>
why not? <br>
no, why not anon in hate? <br>
nevertheless life would be easier if you could /who all zone to see who was in a particular zone <br>
but I digress <br>
If the tie can't be broken, change my vote to abstain <br>
nifty trick. I'll start trying it <br>
okay, leave my vote at FFA<br>
second <br>
FFA hate <br>
blah, diplomats <br>
we're voting on hate atm <br>
blah diplomats <br>
here, Wolfypaw... &quot;Who here feels strongly about FFA vs FiF in Hate&quot;? <br>
*** Aldrin was kicked by [TFC]Xaria (Time to go.... be well Aldrin )<br>
*** Hiraghm_ was kicked by [TFC]Xaria (Time to go... be well.. ) <br>
