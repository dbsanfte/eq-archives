Stats, anyone?<br>
<br>
Frosty ((Project Raydulfire X-326))<br>
<br>
Height: 5'11&quot;<br>
Weight: 200 lbs<br>
Build: Lean, muscularly defined, broad shouldered<br>
Body Temp.: 80-10 degrees F, occasionally colder<br>
Skin/Eye/Hair Color: Blue/Grey/Transparent Blue<br>
<br>
Frosty carries around an icicle dagger with him everywhere made from the finest crystalline chemical combinations; translation, it's basically a razor-cut, biochemically enhanced diamond. Carbon can be fun; WEEEEE! He has large, wide scars that marr his body from head to toe, all horizontal, all large gashes made from big blades of some sort. He's had them forever, and can't bring his bionically enhanced mind to recollect whether they were markings or battle wounds... after all, they are just a biiiit too uniform.<br>
<br>
Frosty's brain mass is genetically altered to store large quantities of information, and as a result, has had extensive knowledge of science in nearly every field. While chemistry, biology, physics, and mathematics interest- as well as benefit- him the most, he's had extended research periods on astronomy, mythology, philosophy, metaphysics, ecology, agriculture, and quantum physics. On the other hand, every detail of every moment of his life, which has been little more than one large bloodbath since test-tube conception, has been etched into his mental infostructure like a branding iron to a cow's butt. There's not detail he's ever missed or failed to burn into his mind- not to mention the images he doesn't want to remember-, but there are some that his mental wiring just won't let him access. Then again, he knows he really doesn't want to in the first place...<br>
<br>
He is quick witted, logical, systematical, calm and collected, a little distant, mostly quiet, and enjoys a good Smirnoff every now and then. Gallons, not fifths. While Frosty is the genetic creation of perfection, and can regulate body temperature to bypass most infrared systems, he can't help but feel that the heart of ice is missing something... which is usually a subject for comtemplation during the periods when he's standing over a dead, bleeding body and counting the zero's in his logical head. All around, he's pretty mechanical and emotionless, but isn't that what all mercs play it off like?<br>
<br>
--------------------------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
Serrafrah<br>
<br>
Height: 5'9&quot;<br>
Weight: Feathers. Two of em. From a hummingbird.<br>
Build: Skinny, muscularly defined<br>
Skin/Eye/Hair: Gray/Blue/Silvery Blonde<br>
Wing Span: 7'3&quot;- compacted to 4&quot; in enclosures<br>
<br>
Serrafrah is a Serrafim angel, the highest order of angels in the heavans. He escorted a Non-Threat class demon to headquarters in the Divine Spiritual Realm, and was put to trial for treason. The bigots of the jury, being self-righteous, pompous assholes (boy, don't yall know the type?), first exiled him, then sentanced him to death after he and the demon saved a congregation of cherubs from a demon task force sent to invade, pillage, and assassinate the Non-Threat class demon. Apparently, pride has *no* say in the matter... :: stifles laughing-coughing &quot;BULLSHIT&quot;s and the like ::<br>
<br>
On the material plane, amphibians were accelerating at an alarming rate. During constant interactions with the Transcendent Power, Serrafrah foresaw what should happen if these environmentally attuned creations were to gain their spiritual awareness. The mammals turned to angels, the reptiles to demons, but the amphibians... they were to surpass both in the angelic self-righteous crusades and the demonic visiousness. Serrafrah and the demon whom he befriended, Garrilon, became the winds of death among these sentient things, destroying them without leaving a trace, and stomping out their reptillian slave-beasts. Mammals once again flourished, despite the attempts of the angelic council to put things back to &quot;the way it was&quot;, as they all seemed obsessed with.<br>
<br>
The council of angels lost touch with the Transcendent as a result of their annhilation of contact with Serrafrah; he truly was the most righteous of them all. So stuck in their ways were they, however, that they believed his death would bring their Creator back. During Tribal Earth, as the age of human tribes was called, Serrafrah again needed the assistance of Garrilon in keeping the humans safe against the unholy horde. Myths of gods and sea serpents and great scaled beasts ensued due to the interference of demons, and talk of the devil because of the angelic posession of men, arose and flourished, severely halting progress.<br>
<br>
Still, time goes on for the honorable, stoic, and now open-minded angel. Gray of color and pure of heart, Serrafrah is bold, courageous, and deadly with his pair of spiritual longswords. While his known presence could have easily brought progress back on track, his modest nature kept him hiding in the shadows, and his hopefulness and total faith told him that the humans would pull through eventually. Besides, the first attempt failed when he was practicing his posession techniques and started walking on water...<br>
<br>
--------------------------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
Garrilon<br>
<br>
Height: 7'10&quot;<br>
Weight: nearly half a ton<br>
Scale/Eye Color: Gray/Red<br>
Appendages: 3 finger claws &amp; thumb claw, 2 clawed toes, wing span = height<br>
<br>
Garrilon commanded legions of the undead his own intelligent, vicious, reptillian race while living in the Caverns Beneath the Soil. There were, and still are, few known exits, but through direct communication with the Transcendent that the demon race all but failed to acknowledge, he found his exit. One of the few demons to command Light energy, Garrilon found at once that he had a distinct advantage over the darkness-driven minds of his people, and began dominating at an early age. Then, one... &quot;night&quot; (there really isn't sun down there...), looking down upon the bloodiest battle with the most radical creations he'd ever spawned in the Pools of Transfiguration, an insect-like creature attempted to take a swipe at him. It was a whole new race; sentient insects. Had it lived, it may have brought forth an economic and spiritual change in the people. Garrilon smashed it all the same. In that instant, he realized that it was all pointless. Leaving the caverns, he was pursued by his own captains, branded traitor and weakling, and was hunted throughout his days on the surface.<br>
<br>
Upon meeting an angel, the first one he could not (and chose not to) outright kill, Garrilon was lead up to the heavans without knowledge of his still-ambitious persecutors. They burned and pillaged spiritual villages, and Garrilon rescued and entire choir of cherubs by facing all 12 dozen of his captains at once. The angel who lead him jumped in to aid his fight, and the cherubs themselves gave their song to aid the battle. It mattered not; he was still branded a demon, and he and the angel fled to the material plane once more.<br>
<br>
Reptiels had ascended. Mammals had ascended. Birds had ascended in the Time before Time. Insects nearly did, as well. This time, thought, the angel, Serrafrah, quested to thwart the evolution of the amphibians for reasons Garrilon could not imagine; but aid he did, as he knew the angel's TRULY pure heart. Serrafrah had aided Garrilon many times before, especially during the time when the Hounds of Hell were unleashed upon the world. They nearly engulfed it all in flames before they put a stop to it- and it was all just an attempt to kill the most powerful demon to ever defy.<br>
<br>
Garrilon is big, bulky, and scary as FFFFFFFUKK. His fangs poke out of his mouth most of the time, and his golden mace hangs supernaturally at his hip. He's got no hair, just a bald, scaly head, and is quick to assess any situation. Garrilon is overconfident of his own abilities, and usually gets into bad situations that he narrowly escapes from. On the other hand, his pride is never damaged, and is overly trusting because of his open-minded nature. He also likes children, of any kind; they cook well n_n  NO, not like that! The list of rules, the code of conduct for every demon, has only 11 laws, ones that are enforced strictly and ground into one's head at birth. Garrilon has only violated one, and that is to not walk the surface. The ninth forbids harm to be done to children. Garrilon has a big heart, and tends to become overly defensive of his tiny friends, like a mother hen. Well... a big hen.<br>
<br>

<br>
More additions to come! I'll post a few more characters when I think up good enough stories for them. I've got a million &amp; one bouncing around in my head, but I need to get to know them a biiiit more intimately first. Translation; I gotta get Crawff, The True, Mindless, that android person, Loki, Kobn, and the rest of the swirly cartoon characters to talk to me a bit more. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :D --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/happy.gif ALT=":D"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   Armadillos R0X0R, and cheese is not ghuda.
