I personally never voted on any of them.<br>
<br>
As for a date -- I would really like to get one more survey out the door, responses due in about a week, with a summit date approximately 2-3 weeks after that.  If I have to code a survey system, it'll take me a week or two.  Does someone have any suggestions for getting this done faster?<br>
<br>
And raid-@#%$-general, SOMEONE has to moderate the new meeting, and absolutely no one other than me and an anonymous grief player (you) has volunteered.  Furthermore, no one except you has suggested I not act as moderator.<br>
<br>
If someone else wants to step up to moderate -- speak up!<br>
<br>
Otherwise I want to get the survey out with the very questions we have ALL had.  I want to see how the guilds feel overall.<br>
<br>
And to bitch about the big guilds not having a say -- sigh.  I'd be quite happy to to two totals on the results -- one offering weight based on size of guild -- to see if it has a dramatic difference on the results.  But I am NOT going to try to survey the entire server.  And I don't believe some sort of free-for-all survey is representative, because it's just too darned easy to flood it.  Heck, one dedicated person could completely skew the results.<br>
<br>
RMG is obviously a grief player.  He makes SOME valid points, but I think I'd like to go back to that Stephen King quote I posted a couple of days ago:<br>
<br>
Arseholes always advertise.<br>

I'll never get my epic or one or two other items I'd like to see.<br>
<br>
Why?<br>
<br>
Because there's not a chance in hell that the planes will be available when I can get a group together.  I don't put together raids of 18 level 60s.  I put together raids of 35 people with an average level of low 50s.  To do so, it includes virtually every planar-level character in both Horizons and Sigils (we dual-book), plus some friends.<br>
<br>
We rearrange our RL schedules to do this.  And they aren't going to be so excited about it when I say, &quot;Oh, and then we'll spend 2 hours figuring out where we can go.&quot;  Why should they rearrange their schedules like this, then?  Answer: a lot of them won't.<br>
<br>
There are a LOT of people who want a scheduled system.  An unwillingness to compromise is selfish.<br>
<br>
Maybe you don't remember a certain druid in Cult of the Red Dragon a while ago.  You and Joshore used to hunt spectres in OOT, back when the level limit was 50.  You weren't grouped -- Joshore was pulling for his group, you were soloing.<br>
<br>
One day, Joshore got very frustrated sharing limited spawn.  You chatted with him, and the message was basically, &quot;What happened to the nice druid who I could get along with?&quot;<br>
<br>
And now I'm asking the same thing.  What happened to the nice enchanter I used to get along with, who taught me a little something about compromise?<br>

<br>
When you speak of the time I was soloing spectres and the druid Joshore.. I still beleive in that edifact.. Compromise and respect for other players and people.<br>
<br>
By extending that analogy to the planes in this case... compromise and respect are the primary factors.. Thus by going FFA/FiF you do as such.<br>
<br>
You also kind of mention it takes time and energy to gather 35 people together.. Yes I agree it does... and I commend all who take such a mantle.. But with 35 low, med 50's you can have a ball in Norrath and get good loot and epic bits.. If say Hate was not available you could take such a force to PoG/Air/DN np and really mop up.. That would be fun..<br>
<br>
By having a contingency plan before gathering your people then you will have things to do, see and kill.<br>
<br>
You say you would never get to see the planes if FFA/FiF, I think that would not be the case.. You in all likelyhood see more of them by virtue of this system.. As it goes currently you get to see the planes every 2/3 months.. which imo is sucky.. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

Frey does your guild  deny using the raidmastergeneral account?  I didnt see you say that LOL.<br>
<br>
I dont see why NK/you would when NK had announced they would use this account in the past, it just seems a few on the boards had forgotten the name of the NK mouthpiece.<br>
<br>
Why dont you post under the freyi planepoacher account Frey? Forgot the password (LOL) or you feel the slightest bit guilty ROFL.<br>
<br>
If it matters to you Frey (which I doubt it does because your kind rationalizes everything) I am not a member of the KindredAlliance guild any more.<br>
<br>
Opps lost a logical reason to annoy the guild?  As if that really matters to you.  Because you and your guild are driven first by greed and perhaps second by the feeling of power you get since you and your guild has some levels and items in this virtual game and yall enjoy this feeling of power since evidently in RL you have such little of it.<br>
<br>
But hey prove me wrong about what I just said above.  Work with the Innoruuk peole like Wolfypaw and the other guilds on this server to make some workable summit.  Prove me that I am a moron for typing the above paragraph.  If you are as really as pure and nice and smart as you seem to think you are you can make the next summit happen in a way that helps everyone, including your guild.<br>

Yes, we do ALL loot in POH/POF random by elimination.  There are no dibs on any loot for RR's or for guests, including epic drops.  We believe that's the right way to do it.  We readily invite anyone to join us.  And we think doing it with such a mix of folks makes it all the more challenging and FUN.  Our guests are just as important a part of making the raid work as we are. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   We would hope all guilds might do it this way, but we are only one guild.<br>
<br>
As for the continuing debate, I lean towards making several days a week FFA, and yes NOT FIF.  I think that patch day should be one of those days.  And I'd like to see how that works.  I hear the &quot;we should go in anytime we want&quot; and wonder how this matches with &quot;we don't need any of the planar armors&quot;.  I don't think big necessarily means BAD, and I never blame a whole guild for the actions of a few.  Oddly, I hope a new Summit could serve the needs of both sides of this debate, but I rarely see compromise in most of the rhetoric.  And that's sad.<br>

<br>
It's not compromising everyone to use a system that a lot of those people don't want.  A lot of us want a scheduled system.  And it's strictly due to the amount of effort that goes into assembling the forces required.  If I could pull together the forces on short notice, I wouldn't care so much.<br>
<br>
Furthermore, envision this...  We gather at G'fay wizzie spires.  We've purchased a bunch of Hate port stones.  Now we're going to port up, but we don't know if anyone is there.  I don't know of a way to do a &quot;who all hatezone&quot;, so we have to send at least one group up there to see.  But if it's just one group, they could easily get wiped out, so I have to send three groups at least.<br>
<br>
Three port stones just to find out IF the plane is taken.<br>
<br>
Plus I've invested the cash for enough stones for the entire raid.  If we don't use them, that ties up what is for us a lot of cash.<br>
<br>
Furthermore, there's another issue.  It's a lot lot easier for a guild to move its own forces around Norrath.  But trying to move a multi-guild raid around is a bit harder.  People go LD and don't have /guildsay to catch up.  Lots of other issues.<br>
<br>
And how many times would I assemble the forces together, just to find that the place we really wanted to go was already taken?  Probably 19 out of 20 times.  Given that I'm not going to try this every single night, no, I am NOT going to get to the planes more often than I do.<br>
<br>
Guilds like TD will, because it's a lot easier for them to assemble forces.  And the funds aren't the same issue for you, either.  Just make a walk-through of juggs in seb, collect some spells, maybe whack the king and get a fungi, and you're set on raid funds for weeks.  I don't have those kinds of resources.<br>
<br>
The guilds that want complete FFA are the ones who can assemble the forces required on relatively short notice.  Furthermore, their requirements are a lot smaller because average level is close to 60, average gear is a heck of a lot better.  I suspect guilds like TD can break Fear with 2 groups.  I can do it with 3, but it's my best 3, and sometimes we have to evac once or twice after killing a few mobs.<br>
<br>
So the compromise a lot of us want is part scheduled, part FFA or FiF.  The compromise from your end would be to at least give it an honest try and see how it works.<br>
<br>
We're even suggesting Tuesdays and Wednesdays -- the popular patch days, when mobs will be up.  It just seems to me that the number of guilds asking for FFA is small enough that 8 days a month in each plane should be able to handle their demands.<br>
<br>
And if not -- if a lot of other guilds are taking advantage of FFA days, then maybe we need to change how many each week.  But I would expect the summit would have language that prohibited guilds that have bookings from using FFA.  So I think there's room for some balance that's fair to everyone.<br>

Here are some quotes for you NK'ers, great smearers (LOL):<br>
<br>
From an earlier post from Frey:<br>
&quot;If you feel the above is wrong and against everything<br>
you stand for, and flames/threats etc is the way you<br>
will answer to our actions, then feel free to do it here<br>
on the boards, i'm sure raidmastergeneral will make posts<br>
about our plane visits. Doing it ingame is futile.&quot;<br>
<br>
The connection here between Frey and raid was unclear I would admit, but raid sure does say a lot of things that sound just like NK does, hmm <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->    <br>
<br>
<br>
From another earlier Frey post:<br>
&quot;We don't believe in the summit, we do not follow the summit.<br>
Its 2 zones of many in the game.<br>
We see no point in treating those zones any diffrent then other zones.<br>
I guess we and the ones who agree with us see the<br>
game diffrently then others.<br>

Why did Frey stop posting under Freyi Planepoacher?<br>
Or is it your contention that Frey never posted under this name (even though I have quoted exact lines showing he did) ROFL <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->    <br>

In a discussion its easy for those who arent real sharp to only answer the parts of questions posed to them that they want to, like you and other NK'ers do instead of attempting to answer all of a person's post (I noticed how many of my questions yall tried to answer).<br>
<br>
Do yall NK think you are better than others on the server since you have a few more levels and some gear that not everyone has (though many guilds have more) ?<br>
<br>
Does this entitle you NK to take whatever you can get when you want to?<br>
<br>
Is NK willing to work with others on this server to help make a new summit that will be good for NK and others on this summit or do you think it is in your greedy best interests to have no next summit agreement?<br>
<br>
These are only a few more of the questions that NK doesnt answer, as yall seem to generally do whatever you want and the rest of the server can go to heck as far as yall seem to think.<br>

I have always known that the majority of the server doesn't care, but I now believe that some people are purposely dragging their feet, because they fear that actually having a Summit meeting will mean an end to any Summit.<br>
<br>
I suggested October 20th.  I got a couple (2?) &quot;yes&quot;s and then Wolfypaw said that was a bad date.  So I suggested the following Saturday.  This received absolutely no response.<br>
<br>
So much for having it this month.  At this point, I honestly do not believe that there will ever be a Summit meeting.   <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#f7f7f7><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub95.ezboard.com/uwolfypaw.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Wolfypaw</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Dubious Poster</span><br>  Posts: 123<br> <font color=#778899>(10/1/01 7:36:04 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Ah the great smear tactic</span><hr size=1> Sharyl, I'm sorry you're impatient.  My primary EQ-related activity was to get the web page working.  I didn't see your post regarding the following Saturday.<br>
<br>
I really really do think we need answers to those questions I asked.  I've been trying to find an existing method of doing a survey, but I haven't found one.  So I have to write something.  That takes time.<br>
<br>
The main questions people have been coming to over and over are:<br>
<br>
1. Should we have some/all FFA?<br>
<br>
2. Should we somehow limit public events?<br>
<br>
3. Should we do something about small guilds over-booking the planes?<br>
<br>
We have no idea how the server feels about these issues.  We know how a few very vocal people feel.  Finding out how each of the guilds feels is highly valuable.<br>
<br>
If we rush into a summit without this information gathered ahead of time, then I really doubt we'll come to any understandings.  The meeting will go on absolutely forever and go nowhere.<br>
<br>
Please speak up if you disagree with me about that.<br>
<br>
So unless someone wants to help gather this information, please give me some time, or explain to me why we have to absolutely rush NOW NOW NOW instead of taking a little extra time (I'm not asking for a lot) to actually find out what changes people want.<br>
<br>
I don't intend to drag this out.  But I did have to get the rest of the important web site items working, and I also have real life clients I have to take care of.<br>
<br>
As I said -- if someone else wants to handle a survey, step right up.  I just want to get those answers.<br>
