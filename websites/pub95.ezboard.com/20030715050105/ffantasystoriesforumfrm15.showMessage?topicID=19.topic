Chapter 1 (pilot chapter)<br>
<br>
&quot;The Fateful Day&quot;<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
It had been raining all day long, all Magus wanted to do was go to town and find some sort of adventure. He'd been like this ever since his parents sent him to train with his Grandfather at the small shrine they had in the mountainous area located in the western most part of the Karanas. This also meant that most of the time Magus was bored, or would daydream, which was just what he was doing.<br>
<br>
&quot;I wonder... Just what is in that cave.....&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Always keep your guard up!!!!&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;What the...?!&quot;<br>
<br>
Magus had left his guard down again during sword practice and for his mistake had been struck over the head with his grandfathers walking stick. Which I might add left a nasty red mark across the young man's forehead and also got a chuckle out of his grandmother. For as many times as he had been warned, Magus still had not learned to keep his attention on practice.<br>
<br>
&quot;Don't be so hard on him, he's so much like you where when you where his age.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;If he doesn't learn now it'll be harder for him to learn later on after he picks up all those bad habits that other fighters have.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Other fighters?! You mean you intending for him to join the Antonica Fighter's Tournament held in Freeport later this year?!&quot;<br>
<br>
Magus looked back and forth at his grandparents bickering and sighed. His grandmother didn't exactly disapprove of him training, but then again she didn't want him to use the skills he was being taught. Again his thoughts drifted back to what could be held in that cave.<br>
<br>
<br>
Deep within the bowels of the cave a woman lay, she didn't look a day over seventeen, but she had been there for several hundred years, apparently sleeping. Truth be known she wasn't human even though she looked like it. Within her mind though she was very awake, thoughts of revenge and what she would do to the man who imprisoned her so long ago. A small smile crept across her face as she lay waiting for something to disrupt the wards place on the stone door, she sensed her freedom was coming soon, and the person who would free her would be the first to feel her wrath.<br>
<br>
<br>
Magus had somehow managed to slip away from the shrine and was walking through the woods near the cave on his way to Qeynos where his great grandfather lived. The usual task to earn his great grandfathers silence on his adventures was to fetch the old man something or capture images of the women in the local baths, which was pretty simple enough since he had already been trained to become an expert theif by his father. However, today he was determined to find out just what was in the cave, if the legends of a beast being killed that could destroy armies had really been buried here. In nothing flat Magus had picked the lock to the iron gates of the cave, a smile crossing his face.<br>
<br>
&quot;Now to see just whats in here...&quot;<br>
<br>
Magus slowly stepped inside the cave and as he walked further in the air began to grow stale. Along the walls where old torches that had long since been light. He had been in such awe at what the cave looked like that he hadn't been paying attention to where he was stepping until it was to late.<br>
<br>
&quot;What the hell?!&quot;<br>
<br>
A giant guillotine dropped from the ceiling and had nearly split him in two. He figured anything this closely guarded must be interesting, and he pushed into the depths of the cave, avoiding the trigger stones that where laced across the floor. It was then that he came to a stone door, one that had strange, ancient writing upon it, that which he had never seen.<br>
<br>
&quot;I really should ask that old man to teach me to read the ancient languages...&quot;<br>
<br>
Magus shrugged and examined the door, he figured it must of been several feet thick, it was definitely going to be difficult to open, or so he thought as he leaded against the wall and fell. The next thing he knew was he slipped on the stone floor and landed with a smack on the floor. With that he was out like a light, hearing the sound of the stone door sliding open as he blacked out.<br>
<br>
<br>
She smiled, finally someone had opened the door to her tomb. As she quickly sat up and stood, slowly gaining her bearing she could see someone outside on the floor, a smirk crossed her face as she stumbled over to the boy laying unconscious on the floor. She was going to have fun with him, though her idea of fun would be far from what anyone would want.<br>
<br>
&quot;Wake up! Hey!&quot;<br>
<br>
She kicked him a few times and got no response, all she could do was shrug. She knew it wouldn't be very fun to kill him while he was asleep, but at least she was free. She would definitely have some fun with him later. At that she slowly faded from view, waiting for the right time to strike.<br>
<br>
<br>
Magus slowly awoke, rubbing his eyes as he stared into an empty room and sighed. It was all a legend after all, if there was a beast it must of rotted away long ago and turned to dust. Suddenly he looked out towards the caves entrance, it was night! He must of been out for hours, in a flash he was up and running out of the cave, heading to the city to have what little fun he could before he could slip back to the shrine.<br>
<br>
At night Qeynos is not at all like the bustling port town of the day, the bars are usually packed full with patrons. Tonight was no exception as Magus rushed into his great grandfathers house, waiting to hear what the old man would trade for his silence. If anything it would probably be something that involved spying on scantly clad women and using an enchanter mirror to capture an image or two.<br>
<br>
&quot;Lets see, what could I use from you this time sonny? I know! I want you to go get me something from the Bayle families home, but what?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Knowing you it'll be some womans underwear&quot;, Magus mumbled, he knew the old man to well.<br>
<br>
&quot;What was that boy?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Nothing....&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;All right your task tonight is simple, all you have to do is sneak in, capture some images of the young lady Bayle in this mystic mirror and bring it back to me.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Should of known, you old pervert...&quot;, Magus once again mumbled as he walked from the house.<br>
<br>
Magus knew he could do this task easy enough, but then again this feeling that all would not go right kept nagging at him, even as he slipped over the stone wall towards the Bayle Family Estate. It was an easy enough task to sneak up behind the guard standing watch at the front entrance, and was even easier to slip past him once a well placed strike knocked him unconscious. After dispatching several more guards Magus found himself in the room of the young lady Bayle. The worst possible thing that could happen actually did happen, for as he tilted the mirror to catch enough light to catch her image she woke up. Normally this wouldn't have been a problem except that he'd neglected to put the rest of the guards to sleep in his haste.<br>
<br>
&quot;Guards! Intruder!!!!&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Aw damn, why'd this have to happen to me?!&quot;<br>
<br>
Magus ran out to the balcony just as several guards burst into the room, this was going to be one hell of a night for him, this much was certain. Of course his luck wasn't getting much better as he seen the guards on the grounds below had begun to converge on the area near the balcony. It was now or never for his escape as he leapt from the balcony and made a running dash for the stone wall, dodging arrows the entire distance.<br>
<br>
&quot;All I wanted to do was have some fun and instead I'm going to be hung all on the kind of that dirty old man...&quot;<br>
<br>
Magus barely managed to jump over the wall as he continued to run. Thinking on the run was becoming a habit of his, one he wished he didn't have the luxury of forming. Well at least he thought he was having some excitement, but the idea of being hung for it wasn't what he had planned.<br>
<br>
<br>
She smirked as she watched this young man from the shadows, she'd never seen a human this fast before, or this agile, but then again she had never seen one with nearly white hair either. He was definitely going to be fun to play with, at least until she could sate her thirst for revenge on the man who had imprisoned her. Still this one amazed her as he had somehow managed to slip past every guard patrolling for him, and had actually managed to sneak inside what appeared to be the Mages guild house.<br>
<br>
&quot;This one will be fun...&quot;, She said with a cackle and slowly began to close in on the young boy. <br>
<br>
She thought she was going to use him for a warm up for her next encounter, as she followed him closely to the roof of the building. It was perfect, he had his back to her and was staring out over the city. It was then that she decided to take action and leapt from the shadows.....<br>
<br>
<br>
Magus was hit from behind and skidded across the roof on the side of his face, whatever hit him sure packed one hell of a punch, and as he stood back up he laid eyes on his assailant. It was a woman, she looked stunning in her tight fitting dress, but it wasn't that feature that caught his eye, it was the fact that her eyes where glowing an amber color.<br>
<br>
&quot;Your certainly tougher than you look. Oh well consider that a little love tap for releasing me from my prison.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Prison?! You mean....&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;That's right, I was the one in that tomb back in that cave, and I'm so thankful for you releasing me, matter a fact I'm so thankful that I'm going to give you a small taste of what I'm going to give that Sorcerer Cain who imprisoned me.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;But thats my gre....&quot;<br>
<br>
Before he could say another word the woman rushed at him again, only this time he barely managed to move out of the way. In the process gave her a leg sweep that sent her flying over the edge, to what he thought was her apparent doom. Naturally he began to walk away from the edge, though this was a mistake he would not make again after the experience he was about to have.<br>
<br>
&quot;Nice moves, but you'll have to do better than that human.&quot;<br>
<br>
Magus swallowed hard and turned around to look, the woman was just floating there in the air. He was in deep trouble, he knew it as soon as she pointed a hand at him, a hand that was had glowing amber mana surrounding it.<br>
<br>
&quot;What'd I do to deserve this?!&quot;<br>
<br>
Magus rushed for the door, flinging it open as he rushed down the steps, about halfway down the stairs he received a direct hit from an amber ball of mana that sent him crashing down the steps and into a wall. He knew there must be a way to defeat her as he frantically searched for a place to hide, and he found it in one of the magicians laboratories. He held his breath as the woman slowly walked past him, and as he managed to make out in the darkness there where various poisons lined up on the wall, a smile crossed his face as he noticed two of the most foul smelling poisons he could remember. His father always told him never to mix this particular two because they could cause an explosion if exposed to heat right afterwards.<br>
<br>
&quot;Now lets see her try that again..&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Try what again?&quot;<br>
<br>
The woman smiled as she seemed to slip through the door as if she where a ghost, he had just enough time to grab the two bottles and uncap them behind his back. This would definitely be something to remember.<br>
<br>
&quot;By the way, my ancestor was the Sorcerer Cain...&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Then your his spawn! You will die!!!&quot;<br>
<br>
At that the woman rushed him, mana surging through her hands as she did so. At that same moment Magus threw the bottles at her, the resulting explosion threw him from the building and onto the street below. He simply grumbled as he stood up, the burns on his back throbbing with pain.<br>
<br>
&quot;She wasn't half bad looking, well I guess I should get going now...&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;That's no way to treat a woman!!!!&quot;<br>
<br>
The woman growled as she pulled herself from the rubble and leapt down infront of him. In the far off distance they both heard an explosion, and then guards screaming out orders to one another, and then a guard rushed down the street yelling as loud as humanly possible.<br>
<br>
&quot;To arms! The Torn Ear and Black Burrow Gnolls are attacking!&quot;<br>
<br>
Magus groaned, it was now certain that he'd never make it home in time to keep this little excursion a secret. Never the less he was going to try, no matter what stood in his way. With this decided he took off running leaving the woman dumbfounded at what was going on.<br>
<br>
<br>
&quot;Where is that boy, I thought I told him that I was going to teach him some special techniques tonight.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Oh, I seen him heading for the city eariler, now don't go into one of your rants, the boy just wants to have a little fun.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Well I just want to make sure he learned what I have to teach him, I don't want him to find out the hard way about using his gifts.&quot;<br>
<br>
Magus's grandfather had to learn the hard way about harnessing his gifts, he had no one else to teach him and all his experience came from actual battle. He knew that battle was no place to experiment on such abilities. Furthermore, he knew Magus wasn't ready to even attempt to fight anything in a real battle.<br>
<br>
<br>
Magus ducked as the gnoll swung its sword at him, without a weapon he was forced to use hand to hand combat. This was something he never really appreciated until now as he gave the gnoll an uppercut, sending it reeling backwards into several other gnolls. He was definitely going to have to pay more attention to what his grandfather taught him.<br>
<br>
&quot;Hey where are you going?! We're not finished yet!&quot;<br>
<br>
The woman had followed him, and was intent on settling the dispute once and for all. Instead she was forced back against the Qeynos city walls by several of the gnolls spells, and as Magus glanced back at her some deep seeded instinct triggered in his mind. Even if she did try to kill him, he simply couldn't allow her to die without having a fighting chance.<br>
<br>
&quot;Hey over here!&quot;<br>
<br>
Magus was purposely taunting the gnolls, drawing their attacks at him, but the woman couldn't understand why he would do such a thing. That is until she seen him cross his arms infront of his face in a defensive stance just as a burst of fire was about to hit him, instead of incinerating him it split of in all directions, igniting the gnolls around him.<br>
<br>
&quot;Well aren't you hot stuff? Maybe I should keep you instead of killing you.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;The hell if you will, your not going to catch me!&quot;<br>
<br>
Magus took off running, dodging gnolls left and right as they swung at him, and of course the woman followed close behind him, batting gnolls away left and right as she gave chase. By now it was obvious she as much stronger than he could of imagined. However, his mind was quickly drawn to the heated sensation, the woman had hurled a orb of mana at him and had scorched the seat of his pants<br>
<br>
&quot;Ah damn!!!!!&quot;<br>
<br>
Magus patted the flames out as the woman cackled in laughter, indeed she was having fun with him. This in turn was also drawing the attention of some of the stronger gnolls of the horde, that is until she incinerated them with a sphere of mana. After that she simply turned her attentions back to Magus.<br>
<br>
&quot;That's the last time I ever try to be nosey around old ruins again, cause no matter what you always end up with an old nag of a problem.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Who're you calling a nag!&quot;<br>
<br>
A flip of her wrist and a ball of mana struck the ground at Magus's feet, sending him reeling through the air, only to land on his back. Then it struck him, if he could get her to exaust herself maybe he stood a chance. This was something his grandfather had tried to drill into his head many times, and now he realized just why.<br>
<br>
&quot;That's right I said an old nag! Come on you heifer, give me your best shot!&quot;<br>
<br>
Repeatedly she hurled spheres of mana at Magus, this time he was ready and began to dodge them. He was actually having fun now as odd it might have seemed. He then simply laughed and taunted her again.<br>
<br>
&quot;Looks like your beginning to sag from old age!&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;That's it! Just you wait, when I get my hands on you......&quot;<br>
<br>
She was flustered, now she was so angry she wasn't aiming anymore. She was simply slinging orbs of mana in every which direction until she was in fact exhausted and was breathing in gasps. It was then that Magus turned and started to walk away, only to be struck from behind by her. However, this time was different, she was wielding a sword of pure mana.<br>
<br>
&quot;Take that you little creep!&quot;<br>
<br>
The sword had cut deep into his left arm, almost to the bone. He was now all out of options, and just as she swung at him again something amazing had happened. A strange sword had appeared in his hands, the hilt was definitely real but the blade, the blade appeared to be simply an ethereal glow. <br>
<br>
He knew for certain it wasn't mana, even in his wildest dreams he couldn't of imagined something like this. As the swords clashed, sparks of mana and energy began spraying through the air in a brilliant shower of various colors. Finally as luck would have it he landed a blow to her right arm causing her to jump back.<br>
<br>
&quot;I'll get you for this I swear it!&quot;<br>
<br>
At that she was gone, and at the same time the sword he was wielding had disappeared. It was a long walk back to the shrine, and all he could think of was that woman. What was she, and more importantly when would she be coming back. Those where Magus's last thoughts as he crossed the threshold of the shrine and collapsed from the pain of his injuries as well as the loss of blood....<br>
