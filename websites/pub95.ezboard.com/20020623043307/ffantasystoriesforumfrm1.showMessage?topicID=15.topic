 <br>
The hot sun hitting her cheeks, Melissa Greene's horse tore through the recently ploughed field after the hounds. Her horse leaping over a broken fence, she heard the hounds catch their prey and urged her horse toward the to see the slaughter.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp The swiftness of the kill left her dissatisfied.  The fox was ripped apart in seconds, blood and torn flesh discarded over the small stream. Her blue eyes focusing on the slaughter, she watched the hounds being recalled, leaving the mangled pieces of flesh.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp She glanced at the other people on horseback and shook her head with disappointment, ignoring the boys hurrying into the gulley with plastic bags to remove the evidence. &quot;It's over.&quot;<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Riding to the edge, Gail Shaver focused on the boys removing the torn carcass. &quot;Can we go?&quot;<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Depressed that the hunt was too quick, Melissa looked across the field at the protesters. Watching them shove the mutilated fox parts into the bags for a couple of seconds, Melissa directed the horse back through the field, churning up the loose soil again.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Eventually reaching the muddy yard outside the stables, Melissa climbed down from the horse and through a narrow path between a row of trees onto a concrete car park. She watched the girl leading the horse into the stables until she reached her gold Capri. Opening the trunk, she exchanged her mud covered riding boots for some clean running shoes.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Slipping out of her black riding jacket, she locked the trunk and entered the pub.  Reaching the polished counter, she heard glanced at the rest of the group, busily complaining about the less than satisfying afternoon.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Gail handed her a glass of bitter and she had a small sip. &quot;It could have lasted longer.&quot;<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Gulping down her lager, Gail managed to hide her boredom of the hunt.  This was the only part that she really liked, the booze up afterwards.. &quot;Live your life, Mel.&quot;  She paused, playing with the prospect of just having a day of wicked fun. &quot;I've got an idea. Let's blow off college tomorrow, head up to Leeds tonight and find a couple of studs.&quot;<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Melissa knew she had to concentrate on her college homework, &quot;I wish, but I've got too much work to get through. It's for Mrs Blaylock, it'll be an hanging offence if it's late.&quot;<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Contemplating changing her plans, Gail took another gulp of her lager.  She figured there was plenty they could do just by staying in together, &quot;A girl's night in, cool.&quot;<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Emptying her glass, Melissa slid her hand to the back of her neck. &quot;You don't need me to hold your hand, do you? I thought you were a big girl.&quot;<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Gail finished her lager and placed the glass on the counter, &quot;Great, you stick to your books. I'll stick to havng fun.&quot;<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Melissa said her goodbyes and left the glass as she walked out to the car park.  She noticed the dark clouds overhead as she unlocked the door to her Capri and settled behind the wheel.<br>
<br>
Having spent an hour trying to come up with something to follow her name written on the top of the writing pad, Melissa yawned and leaned back on her chair, a plate of half eaten Yorkshire pudding next to her papers on the small desk. She stared at the rack of compact discs on the table near her bed, trying to figure out what the hell she was forgetting.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp The constant barrage of rain making the windows rattle, she approached a bookcase near the daisy patterned curtains. Searching the rows of books, she remembered returning the book she was looking for to the college library the other day.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp When she glanced at her watch, she realised the evening classes would have started by now and hastily grabbed a disc from the rack.  Hurrying through her bedroom door, she hoped no one else had checked out the book.  Rushing down into the lounge, she grabbed a thick rain coat draped over the back of a chair and wrapped it across her floral patterned sweater.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Checking she had her keys, she opened the door and saw the downpour.  She fastened the coat tighter and pulled the fur lined hood over her head, the rain soaking her tight jeans as soon as she stepped out.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Slamming the door shut, she tried to make out the digital figures of her watch amidst the heavy rain to make sure she still had time.  She unlocked the door and slipped inside, her waterlogged jeans drenching her skin as she sat down.  Removing her hood, she looked at the rain covered windscreen as she turned on the bright headlights.  Taking the compact disc from the thin box, she placed it in the player and turned on the deafening music.  Starting the engine, she backed out onto the country lane and began easily breaking the speed limit in her rush to retrieve the much needed book.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Her car raced past the old cemetery.  The windscreen obscured by the downpour, she caught a flash of a man appearing from behind a large hedge.  She slammed on the brakes.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp The car skidding across the wet road, she screamed as she saw his body smash into the windscreen and roll limply off the hood as the car crashed into a tall oak.  She sat behind the wheel for a moment, trying to decide whether to just drive away and leave him behind.  She looked back, barely able to see that he was not moving.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp The rain drenched her crimson hair as she climbed out of the car, focusing on the body lying in the mud soaked ditch.  Her hand covering her mouth with the horror that she had killed him, the thoughts of leaving returned to her mind.  She knew that she would not be able to live with herself if she did that and began to approach him.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Reaching him, she extended her arm to feel for a pulse.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp He trembled.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp She remained frozen to the spot for who knew how long, eventually gathering her nerve to try again.  She lifted his hand and tried finding a pulse.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp The hand came to life and grasped her, steel like fingers encircling her wrist tightly.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp She screamed as she struggled to free herself, her hands slippery with rain.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp The man caught hold of her coat collar, pulling her back toward him.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Feeling his cold breath on her wet throat, Melissa screamed as she felt her flesh being brutally ripped open.  She managed to push him away and made a dash for her car, her neck gushing with blood.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Glancing back frantically as he rose, she saw that he appeared unhurt from the impact with her car.  Her fingers fumbling to open the door, she felt him grabbing her again.  Forced to face him, she saw the pointed teeth between his lips and screamed.<br>
<br>
Gail rode her motorcycle past the open wooden gate into the yard.  Pushing it into the barn to keep the seat dry, she didn't give a second thought about the usually closed gate.  Locking the barn door, she ignored the slight drizzle as she approached the farm house.  Removing her keys from the pocket of her damp leather jacket, she unlocked the dull red front door.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp She stepped over several letters as she entered.  Checking the time on the video, she was surprised that Melissa was getting her daily helping of 'Neighbours.'  Expecting a response when she shouted upstairs, she picked up the mail and dropped it on the table near the window.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp The silence puzzled her, it wasn't like Melissa to miss her favourite show.  Relentlessly tapping her fingers on the bannister as she walked up the stairs, she arrived outside a green door with glittering letters spelling out Melissa's name.  She knocked on the door with another force to wake the dead.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Nothing.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Ignoring Melissa's golden rule about privacy, she opened the door.  The bed was still neatly made, that was enough to convince her that something was wrong.  She remembered Melissa joking about how she never made it until she got back from college.  She found the writing pad on the desk, but it took a few moments for it to sink in that this was assignment that should have been handed in this morning.  She got worried.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Rushing down the stairs, she ran out to the barn and straddled her motorcycle.  Starting the engine as she slipped the helmet over her head, she roared out of the barn and past the gate onto the country lane.<br>
<br>
Parking her motorcycle in the near empty car park, Gail rushed past the sparse row of shops.  Hurrying between a bakery and computer shop, she approached the police station hidden in a small yard behind the shops.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Removing her helmet before she barged through the glass door, she entered the small office and made for the single window used for inquiries.  She stopped to look around, it had been the first time she had been in this part of the building.  She was clearly unimpressed by the plain white brick walls and single locked door confining her to this one small room.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp She pressed a buzzer on the wall, keeping it pressed hard until the glass partition in the small window was opened..<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;May I help you?&quot;  The Officer was clearly agitated by her finger still pressed against the buzzer.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Having a vague recollection of him hounding her when she was a teenager, Gail began tapping her fingers on the wooden frame.  &quot;I want to report my friend is missing.&quot;<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Her constant beginning to get on his nerves, the Officer scratched his bearded chin.  &quot;And when did this exactly happen?&quot;<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Gail began tapping harder, getting pissed that he was wasting time on pointless questions.  &quot;What has the time have to do with anything?&quot;<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp The Officer tried staying calm, &quot;Please be patient.  When did you last see your friend?&quot;<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp She leaned forward, &quot;The hunt yesterday.&quot;<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp The door opened behind her and a man in a damp brown coat entered.  His blue eyes focused on the agitated Officer's face, &quot;What's going on?&quot;<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp The Officer made no attempt to hide his contempt of the sport, &quot;She claims that her friend has disappeared, after one of their foxhunts.&quot;<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp His tone gave Gail the impression that he might have been one of these namby-pamby protestors against having a little fun.  &quot;Don't make me gag.  That's what this is all about, isn't it?&quot;<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Detective Sergeant Paul Jarvis removed his damp coat to reveal a faded navy blue suit, &quot;Why don't we go to my office and talk about this.&quot;  He glanced at the Officer as he walked toward the interior door, &quot;Buzz us in then.&quot;<br>
<br>
Her hand twitched involuntarily as Melissa lay on the slab, her throat caked in dried blood.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Her blue eyes opened and she gulped desperately for breath.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Dazed as she rolled off the stone sarcophagus onto the floor, she tried to stand.  Taking in the ancient walls surrounding her, she turned and saw what she had been lying on.  She began looking around, afraid of the eerie sounds of the wind rustling through the worn crypt.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Standing among the dust covered tombs, she backed into something soft and sticky.  She screamed as she scrambled to brush off the mass of thick cobwebs, feeling dozens of hairy little legs scurrying over her skin and hair.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Disentangling herself, she swept the spiders off her clothes, shaking at the thought of any of them remaining on her.  She squirmed out of her coat and tossed it onto the filthy stone floor, still shuddering from the thought of the spiders crawling under her sweater or jeans.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp As the spiders scurried into the cracks on the floor and walls, Melissa held the back of her neck as she turned.  She saw the rusted iron door at the top of a flight of stone steps, offering the chance for run into the sunlight.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Vague memories of what happened began to flash through her mind as she became confident that she was alone in the crypt.  She climbed the stairs and grabbed the rusted bars.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp The sunlight hit her skin.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Caught between a mixture of surprise and shock, she watched her skin begin to blister.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Snatching her hand back, she lost her balance and stumbled.  Her head smashed into a stone slab as she crashed back down the stairs.  Feeling a cut on her forehead, her leg erupted with searing agony the instant she tried moving.  She glanced down at her leg, feeling sick when she saw the bone emerging from just above her ankle.  She attempted to avoid looking at the blood as she focused on trying to reach the door.  As she looked up, she realised that it was slowly beginning to go dark outside.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp She began dragging herself up the steps, screaming with agony with every movement.  Looking at her goal, she felt herself feeling invigorated as the darkness fell outside.  Even the fog in her mind was beginning to clear.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp The door creaked open above her and her hope for salvation died.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp The man who had attacked her was stood at the top of the steps.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp He hurried past her when he saw the exposed bone, his gentle French accent betraying a hint of concern.  &quot;You're hurt.  Let me see.&quot;<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Staring at his aristocratic features and long brown hair, Melissa's leg erupted with agony as she tried dragging herself away from him.  &quot;What do you want?&quot;<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp He remained silent.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Unable to turn away from his brown eyes, Melissa felt her ankle stiffening and her entire leg begin tingling almost with relieving pleasure.  She managed to break the trance.  Glancing down at her leg, she managed to move it was ease.  All trace of the injury was gone.  She stood up, a little unsteady at first.  Then she retreated from him.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp As she brushed the hair out of her eyes, he saw the blisters on her hand.  &quot;I'm sorry, Melissa.  I should have been here to stop this.&quot;<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Her hand disappeared behind her back as she moved to keep the sarcophagus between him and her.  More memories returning, she touched her neck.  Everything sank in.  &quot;You know my name?&quot;<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp His voice was compassionately soothing, &quot;I've been watching you.&quot;<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp The fear that he was going to kill her returned with a vengeance.  Melissa backed against the wall, pressing herself firmly against it.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Something wet and soft nudged her ear.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp She turned toward the large rat returning her gaze and screamed.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp As she screamed again, the man flashed forward and gently lifted it from her shoulder.  &quot;You've frightened him.&quot;<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Still nervous about his intentions, Melissa watched him begin stroking the rat.  Her curiosity began to demand answers.  &quot;Who are you?&quot;<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Placing the rat on the musty floor, the man let it safely scurry away.  Glancing at her, he saw the terror in her eyes and halted.  &quot;Julian.&quot;<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Touching the gash on her neck, she felt stupid even considering her suspicions.  &quot;What are you?&quot;<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp There was sadness in his voice when he answered, &quot;After I became a vampire, my parents pretended I did not exist.  I was shunned by my family and friends who considered me to be a monster.  I remained in France until my dear sister passed away, forced to hide in places like this.&quot;  He glanced around the crypt, hating being forced to live in such a distasteful dump.  &quot;There was a community of us in New York at the turn of the century, they welcomed me without hesitation and taught me how to survive.  They were my friends.  I watched mortals torture and mutilate them because of what we had to do to survive.&quot;<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Despite everything he had done to her the previous night, Melissa couldn't help feeling sorry for him.  &quot;But you were killing people.&quot;<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Advancing toward her, Julian grabbed her shoulders.  &quot;No, we were surviving.&quot;  Releasing her when he realised that he was scaring her again, he turned away.  &quot;I'll teach you how to survive.&quot;<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp The realisation of what he was suggesting became clear.  Just the idea made her sick to her stomach at the prospect, yet there was some part of herself that was liking it.  &quot;I can't kill anyone.&quot;<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Julian wondered whether he had made the right choice in selecting her to keep him company, &quot;You're a hunter, you enjoy the chase and the kill.&quot;<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Melissa wiped her tears from her cheeks, trying to make herself believe that he was wrong.  &quot;You can't compare vermin to human beings.&quot;<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp An undercurrent of anger appeared in his voice.  He knew that her protests were part of an attempt to cling to a world she was no longer part of, &quot;Foxes kill for survival.  You kill for sport.&quot;<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp It surprised her that he seemed to have such a passion for animals, &quot;I'm just a student, I have friends that I care about.&quot;<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp He remembered watching his sister dying, trying to spare her all that.  &quot;Forget them.&quot;  He glanced at his watch, &quot;We must go.&quot;  He held out his hand, invitingly.  &quot;Please?&quot;<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp As he began heading up to the door, Melissa thought about escape again.  She figured she'd have a better chance outside and followed him.  The cemetery was brightly lit by the nearly full moon overhead as she emerged and then she saw the gate.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Julian was quite far ahead of her when she began running in the opposite direction.  Reaching the gate, she saw the padlocked chain and looked back.  She felt sure he was going to catch her.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp There was no sign of him among the mass of tombstones.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Turning back to the gate, she scrambled over it, tearing her jeans on the sharps rails and gashing her legs.  She fell onto the pavement and set off running along the path, determined to reach the police station.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp She reached a brightly lit bus stop in about a minute and checked the time table, a glance at her watch making her realise how long she was going to have to wait.  Certain he was going to find her, she felt the odd drop of rain begin hitting her head.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Every so often, an occassional car went past, but she was constantly on the lookout for Julian.  She didn't even realise that the bus had stopped until she heard the door open.  She was inside in an instant, fumbling for the money to pay the driver.  Snatching the ticket, she took the nearest seat.  She couldn't believe that Julian hadn't found her.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp As the bus began moving, she glanced at the blisters covering her hand and then remembered being bitten.  There was no wound when she touched her neck.  She quickly made herself believe it had all been a trick.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Looking out through the window as the bus crossed the iron bridge leading into town, Melissa saw the lights from the college.  She had lurched forward and was standing by the doors before she knew what she was doing.  She didn't understand what was happening, but she felt she had to get off here.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp The bus slowed to let her off.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Melissa jumped out as the doors opened, landing unsteadily on the wet pavement.  She stared at the windows of the college, the bright lights seeming to invite her to enter.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Passing through the doors into the lobby, she glanced at the trophies in the display case until a noise made her look toward the stairs.  Her stomach felt alive with butterflies as she began moving toward the sound.  Reaching the stairs, she could actually feel that there was someone up there.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp She climbed the stairs slowly.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Mrs Blaylock was stood by the classroom talking to the caretaker.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp The thoughts flashing through her mind shocked her.  All her time in this class and she had never thought about Mrs Blaylock like this.  She didn't know what to think, she was actually having feelings for her teacher.  She had never understood the attraction two women could have for one another, then it hit her.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp It wasn't Mrs Blaylock that she was attracted to, it was the blood.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp The craving was growing stronger inside her and no matter how much she tried to fight it, she found herself liking the way it was making her feel.  She summoned every vestige of her will to subdue her desire.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Mrs Blaylock returned to the classroom when the caretaker began continuing with his work.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Melissa wanted to stop herself, to stop these sick thoughts in her mind.  She failed, the thought of the feel of hot sticky blood filling her mouth and coating her throat became all she could think about.  When she reached the door to the classroom, she realised that she was smiling.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp She stared at Mrs Blaylock sitting behind her desk, her hand rubbing the back of her neck as she thought about the kill.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Something made her think about Gail.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp The image of her best friend's face helped her conquer her urges.  She focused more of everyone she cared about.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Staggering back against the dull blue wall, she brought her lust under control and rushed down the stairs.  Hurrying out into the rain, she collapsed against a lamp post.  Her face stained with the tears, she felt like she was losing herself to these sick urges.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Julian stepped from behind a battered red van parked on the small college car park, the lack of blood of her lips was discouraging.  He knew the answer before he asked it, &quot;Have you killed?&quot;<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Every thought she had screamed at her to run, she just had to figure out why she didn't want to.  Still barely managing to control her urges, she forced herself not to think about them.  &quot;I told you, I will not kill anyone.  I just want to go home.&quot;<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp He brushed her cheek, wiping the rain from her skin.  &quot;Your instincts are growing, soon they will be part of you.&quot;<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp The brief thought of giving in to her craving made her feel esctatic and, despite not wanting to, she climbed into the back of the van.  She still clung to the hope that she could resist everything she was feeling, watching Julian sit behind the wheel.  She collapsed onto the soft cushions scattered across the metal floor, closing her eyes as the rain outside became heavier.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp It felt like she had only been lying there for a couple of minutes when she felt the van stop.  As Julian opened the back door, she felt someone was near.  Climbing out, she stared at the van parked between a clump of trees.  Whatever she was feeling was directed toward a small cottage tucked away at the end of a long driveway.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Julian glanced at her, &quot;The one that lives here, she won't be missed for a while.&quot;<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Her face dripping with rain, she tried to think of any rational reason not to go through with this.  &quot;We can't just break into her home and kill her.&quot;<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp The lights went out in the house.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;It's time.&quot;  He paused to look back, hoping her instincts would have grown enough to stop her from trying to run away.  &quot;Stay here.&quot;<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp The fear that she wouldn't even want to stop herself from killing sickened her as she saw him reach the door.  Her hand clasped the back of her neck nervously as he removed something from his pocket.  She moved closer, recognising the key as he began unlocking the front door.  &quot;How did you get that?'<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp When he looked back at her, she got a feeling that he was not enjoying this as much as she was trying to pretend she wasn't.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;I was prepared.&quot;<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp She forced herself to feel disgusted by his cold preparation for the murder, her wet clothes clinging to her skin as she watched him.  It felt like hours, standing out there in the way.  Then she heard the scream from inside.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Rushing inside without a second thought, she was lost totally in her desire to satisfy her new lust.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp A last moment of clarity stopped her by the bedroom door.  Julian was pinning a struggling woman to the bed, his head pressed against her throat.  The woman's face, she had seen it before, they had been at school together.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp The woman's strength beginning to fade, Julian tore his teeth from the flesh and glanced at Melissa.  &quot;Feed.&quot;<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Sickened by her delight at the blood dripping from his lips, Melissa stared at the woman's throat with mouth watering anticipation.  She made a final attempt to resist her hunger, &quot;This isn't right.&quot;<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Julian climbed off the bed and approached her.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp At first she thought he might kill her this time, but instead he pushed her toward the bed.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;It's part of you now.&quot;<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp The blood was intoxicating.  Melisa felt herself wanting to taste it, but managed to hesitate when she noticed the woman's body tremble.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Placing his hands softly on Melissa's shoulders, Julian encouraged her to continue, his voice soothingly persuasive.  &quot;You can do this.&quot;<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp She couldn't look away from the blood, traces of her humanity threatening to make her throw up.  &quot;I can't.&quot;<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp His hands slid over her shoulders and he began caressing her softly, &quot;Just let the hunger guide you.&quot;<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Her teeth were lengthening as she continued to stare at the blood.  A moment later, she realised that she was kneeling on the bed, directly facing the woman's delicious neck.  Her desire to fight her urges vanished.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp She leaned forward and tentatively plunged her teeth into the flesh.  Her mouth filling with succulent blood, Melissa gulped it down.  Instinctively holding the woman as she began struggling again, she continued enjoying the taste of the blood surging past her lips, the sweet delight of it soothing her dry throat..<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp The woman died in silence.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Melissa removed her fangs from the throat as soon as the supply of blood waned.  The guilt over what she had done consumed her as her satisfied hunger allowed her bring her urges under control.  She scrambled off the bed into a corner, trembling with horror as she felt the wet blood on her lips.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Her blistered hand began throbbing with a pleasant tingle, the skin healing completely.  She looked at him, &quot;I don't understand?&quot;<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Hoping that this revelation might help subdue her disgust, Julian half wished that she would accept what she now was.  &quot;The blood helps us heal.&quot;  Entering the bathroom, he glanced at the shower and looked back.  Her sweater and torn jeans were covered in blood and would be a constant reminder of her first kill.  She needed to put it behind her,  &quot;Clean yourself up and put on some fresh clothes.&quot;<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Melissa caught sight of the body.  Wiping the blood from her lips, it disgusted her how much she had enjoyed taking a human life.  &quot;I can't do this again.&quot;<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Approaching the wardrobe, Julian opened it and revealed a row of dresses.  He knew it would soon be dawn.  &quot;We'll talk about this in the van.&quot;<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Tears flowed down her cheeks as she struggled to shake her head.  She closed her eyes, wishing to find some way to wake up from his nightmare.  She looked up as she heard him removing an outfit from the wardrobe, trying to make herself feel angry for everything he had put her through.  She couldn't, &quot;I murdered that poor woman and now you expect me to steal her clothes.&quot;<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp He remembered his first kill, &quot;It'll be easier if you give in.&quot;<br>
<br>
Jarvis approached the farm house door and rang the bell.  He took a glance at the neglected field as the door opened.  Turning back promptly, he smiled as he found Gail's irritated features staring back at him.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;Would you mind I ask you a couple of questions about your friend?&quot;<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp As he entered, she got the impression that he was hiding something.  &quot;Don't drag me along, just give me the bad news?&quot;<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Taken back by her bluntness, Jarvis realised he was going to have to tell her the whole truth.  &quot;There was an incident this morning, a reported break in.  There was a body.&quot;  He continued, despite noting her concern for his missing friend.  &quot;But it's not your friend.  Unfortunately it does raise the possibility.&quot;<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Gail finished the sentence for him, &quot;That she's dead?&quot;<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Jarvis tried sounding hopeful, &quot;It's important to consider all the possibilities, just in case.  It doesn't mean...&quot;  He broke off, hating this part of the job.  &quot;Can I sit down?&quot;<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp She began tapping her fingers on the coffee table, &quot;Ask your questions.&quot;<br>
<br>
Melissa woke on the soft cushions and briefly managed to convince herself that she was back in her own bed, that everything had been a nightmare.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Then she opened her eyes and saw the metal roof of the van.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Some instinct made her sense that she was not alone.  Rolling over onto her back, she saw Julian resting peacefully next to her.  He wasn't moving.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp She felt free, the need for him seemed to have gone.  Slithering to the doors, she tried not to disturb him as she did her best to open them quietly.  She stepped down onto the hard concrete, the stolen red dress confining her tightly.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Afraid to risk waking him by closing the doors, Melissa took in her surroundings.  She was standing in the car park to the only local nightspot in town.  Remaining close to the metal railing seperating the car park from the river, she watched several teenage boys rush past her.  Their eagerness to get inside made her desire return.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Purging her mind of such thoughts, she stopped and glanced at the river.  It would be so simple just to end her torment right here.  She climbed under the metal barrier and approached the water, finding herself staring at the reflection of the moon in the water.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp A hand touched her shoulder.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Julian had woken up.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp He stood there between her and the car park, watching a pair of women heading toward the floating hotel at the side of the nightclub.  Glancing back at Melissa, he knew from her expression that she was close to being unable to contain her desires.  &quot;Find someone, I'll get us a room.  Come back here and I'll give you the key.&quot;<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Melissa tried making the effort to shake her head, but her urge to kill beginning to overwhelm her.  She fought against it, &quot;No.&quot;<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp The roar of a motorcycle made her turn in the futile hope that Gail was paying one of her frequent visits to the club, but it was a man in a faded leather outfit.  Her eyes followed him as he disappeared inside.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Her desire took over as she began approaching the doors.  She didn't want to stop herself any more.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp She entered the moment she reached the doors and advanced onto the balcony overlooking the dance floor, the deafening music assaulting her senses.  She searched the mass of faces and focused on her prey, the man was sitting alone in a dark corner.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Descending the metal stairs, she pushed her way through the mass of people.  Her teeth were beginning to lengthen as she got closer to her prey.  She sat next to him and smiled, unable to stop herself from staring at his delicious throat.  Barely able to think about anything other than ripping open that soft juicy flesh, she raised her voice above the loud music.  &quot;Wouldn't you prefer to go somewhere a little quieter?&quot;<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp He man leaned forward and whispered in her ear.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Rising from the chair, Melissa took his hand and pulled him through the crowd.  Pausing by the stairs, she began backing up, her attention firmly focused on her prey.  Reaching the platform, she leaned against the metal railing and pulled him close,  Her enjoyment of teasing him with a kiss amazed her, but her mind remained dedicated to the delight of ripping open his delicious flesh.  She led him outside, letting him follow her like a lovesick puppy through an opening in the barrier.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Pulling him to the edge of the river, she backed against a small bench and smiled.  She was thankful when she remembered that she needed to meet Julian, the thought that she wouldn't kill this poor man after all popped into her mind.  The thought was gone in an instant, she wanted to do it.  &quot;Wait in the hotel, I'll be a minute.&quot;  She gave him a lingering kiss, enjoying feeling him caressing her back before pulling away.  &quot;I promise you won't regret it.&quot;<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp She smiled at her prey heading inside the floating hotel.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp A faint scream made her look towards Julian's van.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp There was a slight moaning coming from inside when she approached.  It was the perfect opportunity, she looked around for anyone to help her.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp The car park was empty, her chance to expose him and become free was gone.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Her instincts took over and she felt herself wanting to see what was happening inside the van, her hand beginning to turn the rusted handle.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp The door squeaked as she opened it.  Her eyes fell on Julian pinning a teenage girl against the cushions, the mouth watering sight making her realise how much she would have liked to join the feast.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Julian heard her enter, finishing the last drop of blood from his vctim.  Seeing that she had left the door open, he rushed to close it.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp The brief anger on his face convinced her that he would kill her.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp He calmed down instantly.  Removing a ket from the girl's leather jacket, he handed it to Melissa.  &quot;Room sixteen.&quot;<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Snatching it hungrily, Melissa felt herself wanting to kill as her gaze travelled to the wonderful torn flesh.  She took a final look at the dead girl and felt herself licking her lips with eager relish, the fresh blood making her urges stronger.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp She forced herself to look away as she opened the doors.  As she returned to the cold hard concrete, she tried blocking the delightful image of the dead girl from her mind.  She began heading toward the hotel, wishing that she could make herself stop.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Crossing the ramp, she entered the furnished lobby and walked past the reception desk toward her prey.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp It was hard stopping herself from ripping open his throat right here in public, the urge to satisfy her hunger made her hurry forward.  She grabbed his hand and pushed him against the wall, something managing to help her suppress her desires.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp His hands caressing her body, Melissa led him to a flight of metal steps leading to the guest rooms.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Pulling him up the steps, she pushed him against the metal railing.  Eagerly turning as she glanced at the room key, the cool breeze hit her bare arms.  Locating room sixteen, she unlocked it and turned on the light.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp The large double bed taking up most of the small room, she let him enter and closed the door behind him.  She leaned against the hard wood, the desire to fulfil her cravings removing any inhibitions she had.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp She moved toward with intent and pushed him down onto the bed.  Climbing over him, she teased him by gradually unbuttoning his shirt.  Her hands explored the hair covering his chest as her desire became irresistable, the anticipation of the kill aroused her instincts.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Melissa revealed her long teeth and ripped into his throat, the succulent taste filling her mouth.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp The door opened behind her.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp She glanced up, tearing the man's throat with a spray of blood.  Her crimson lips drawing back in a bloodthirsty snarl, she saw Julian standing there.  Then she realised that he was looking at the body beneath her.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Her desire briefly satisfied once more, Melissa felt sick as she saw the blood splattered across the bedsheets.  She rose from the bed, feeling ill by how much she had enjoyed herself.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp The man's hand twitched.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp It made her hungry for more and she returned to her feast, biting eagerly at the flesh and gorging herself until there was nothing left.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Licking the blood on the man's throat, Melissa's satisfied hunger subdued her murderous instincts.  She scrambled away from the still warm body and crouched in the corner of the room, her disgust of herself reaching new heights of revulsion.  Trembling, she stared at the body, wishing that she could undo it..<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Julian knelt by her side, urging her to move.  &quot;We can't stay here.&quot;<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Her face was stained by tears and dripping blood as she looked at him, &quot;I couldn't stop myself.&quot;<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp The delay irritating him.  Julian was afraid that she was too stubborn to release who she used to be.  &quot;It is your nature.&quot;<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp He sensed movement outside the door.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp The turning of a key in the lock made her look at the door, her eyes filled with horror as the two newlyweds began to enter.  Her instincts took over and she flashed forward, slamming into the woman forcefully.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Proudly watching her turn the woman's throat into a mass of blood torn flesh, Julian grabbed the man from behind and broke his neck with one quick movement.<br>
<br>
Jarvis parked his Mitsubishi Shogun on the muddy lane and climbed out.  Stepping through a gap in the thick hedge, he hurried across the damp grass toward the two police officers searching the trees.  His shoes sank into the mud as he paused, looking into a small gulley.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp One of the officers glanced at him, &quot;What's all the fuss about?&quot;<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp With everything that had been going on, he felt worried about what may have happened to Gail's friend.  &quot;Three more attacks, they were found this morning.&quot;<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp He almost slipped on the wet grass as he made his way down, a gleam in the burning sunlight attracting his attention.  He summoned the two officers and heard them scrambling down to join him.  Helping them expose the car, he saw the blood on the smashed windscreen as he checked the licence plate for confirmation it was Melissa's.  &quot;Okay, so she hit something.  It doesn't explain how the car got down here or where she went?&quot;<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Taking a walk around the partially hidden car, one of the officers nodded toward the church spire visible above the trees.  &quot;There's the old cemetery.  If the lights at the church were on, she might have tried finding some help.&quot;<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp It was a longshot, considering how many questions that were still unanswered, but he figured it was worth a try.  He used anything to stop himself slipping down as he scrambled back up the side of the gulley.  Reaching the patch of water soaked grass, he peered through a thick hedge at the tombstones.  Walking along the hedge until he emerged onto the road, he approached the cemetery gate and pushed it open.  Heading between the graves, he looked for some hopeful sign to indicate Gail's friend was alive.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Getting further away from the church, he paused by a large decaying crypt, the family name barely discernible in the worn stone.  Resting on the crumbling stone steps, he stared at the trees surrounding the cemetery.  The rows of graves made him think about the four murders, trying to make himself believe that they were not the work of some sick nutcase with a taste for the macabre.  Eventually rising, he began heading back to help with the search.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp The creak of the rusted door swinging open made him look back.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Peering into the darkness, he figured it was worth a look and began to descend the worn steps.  His eyes adjusted to the gloom as he reached the stone floor.  Inspecting the crypt, he tried to make out the faded names.  Relieved he had found nothing, he backed against one of the tombs.  Leaning against the stone, he felt something soft under his palm and turned.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Melissa was laid out on the slab, not moving.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Jarvis checked for a pulse, closing his eyes when he realised it was too late.  &quot;Bloody hell.&quot;<br>
<br>
Emerging from the thick wood running behind the cemetery, Julian headed along a rough path between the gravestones.  He stopped just before reaching the gate, his senses warning him before he saw the police officers emerging from the crypt.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp He faded into the shadows as Jarvis left the cemetery.  Waiting until he had gone, Julian looked back to the crypt.  There was still someone in there.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Moving between the tombstones, Julian approached the crypt.  Reaching the entrance, he knew that the lone officer would be easy prey.<br>
<br>
Waiting outside the small medical centre on the edge of the town's shopping centre, Jarvis paced up and down constantly.  He was glancing at his watch every thirty seconds as he waited.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Hearing Gail approaching on her motorcycle, he turned and stood on the steps until she reached him.  He hoped to put her at ease over what she was expected to do, &quot;That's a nice bike.&quot;<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp She removed her helmet and brushed her hair out of her eyes, , trying to convince herself that this was a mistake and her best friend's body was not in there.  &quot;Can we get this over with?&quot;<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Gently taking her hand, he noticed the shock in her eyes.  &quot;I'm sorry, it's procedure.&quot;<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp It was the first time she would have seen a dead body, apart from the ones on the telly.  Mustering her courage, she followed Jarvis inside and toward an elevator.  Halting by the doors, she began tapping the sleeve of her jacket until the doors slid open.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp She entered behind Jarvis and pressed herself firmly against the wall, watching him press the basement button.  Feeling the almost claustrophobic compartment begin to descend atfer the doors closed, she felt scared at being around all those dead people.&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp The elevator jerked to a halt and the doors opened, allowing her to stare along the dull passage leading to that room.  She stepped out and began following him, pretending to maintain her tough exterior as he opened the door.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Entering before she had second thoughts, she saw the covered bodies and felt nauseated by the sickly smell.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp He passed the row of corpses, checking the tags as he went.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp She watched him halt by an isolated metal trolley between a metal cabinet and a sink, not saying a word.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Looking back at her, Jarvis was reluctant to upset her further.  &quot;We can wait, you know.  We don't have to do this now.&quot;<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Gail shook her head and approached the trolley, hiding her fear at the unmoving shape under the sheet.  &quot;Show me.&quot;<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Jarvis removed the sheet.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp The sight of Melissa made her turn away rapidly.  She fell against a sink, tears gushing down her face as she leaned against it.  She managed a faint nod.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp He hastily replaced the cover over Melissa's face.  He hated the next part, but it was something he had to mention.  &quot;You do realise your friend's death might not be an isolated incident.&quot;  Gently taking her arm, he led her toward the door.  &quot;Let's get some fresh air.&quot;<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Gail opened the door for herself and wiped away her tears, &quot;I can do it myself.&quot;  She hurried to the elevator, grateful to be away from that smell.  Impatiently waiting it to descend, she saw the doors open and dashed inside the small compartment.  Pressing the button quickly, she saw Jarvis approaching until the doors closed between them.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Feeling the elevator rise, she felt it halt suddenly and saw the doors slid open.  Rushing outside, she ran toward her motorcycle.  She passed Julian on the steps, ignoring him in her haste to get away from the medical centre.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Pushing his way inside, Julian walked past the reception desk and approached the elevator.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp The doors opened and he stared at Jarvis for a second, concealing his surprise as they passed.  Watching Jarvis leave, he began descending the stairs next to the elevator.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Reaching the basement, Julian approached the morgue and hurried through the door.  His senses were telling him that Melissa was waking.  He approached her body and pulled back the sheet, a slight smile appearing on his lips as she stared at her peaceful face.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Opening her eyes abruptly, Melissa saw the plain white ceiling above her.  She saw the other bodies as soon as she sat up, fearfully realising where she was.  It was clear someone must have found her resting in the crypt, but she felt confused that she hadn't been disturbed.  &quot;Why didn't they wake me?&quot;<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Julian glanced at the other bodies, &quot;It's a natural defence mechanism, it prevents our nature from being exposed while we sleep.&quot;<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Her feet shivered as she touched the cold tiles.  Embarrassed as she realised she was naked, she snatched the sheet from the trolley and held it tightly against her.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp The embarrassment on her face amused him as he began looking for her clothes.  After searching the cupboards along the walls, he decided that more extreme measures were needed and turned toward the door.  &quot;I won't be long.&quot;<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp She watched him go, a dreadful feeling that he was going to kill crept into her mind and she found herself wishing she could have watched.<br>
<br>
The blond haired nurse emerged from the ward and headed to the elevator.  Noticing the lit basement light above the doors, she pressed the button and began patiently waiting for it to reach the second floor.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp The doors began to open.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp She entered and watched the doors close as the elevator began to rise.  Heading out as soon as it halted, she hurried along onto the third floor.  She halted halfway along, getting the feeling that there was someone behind her.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Turning rapidly, she stared along the empty hallway.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Dismissing the feeling as paranoia, she entered the nurse's lounge.  Passing a row of soft chairs, she approached the window and paused between two potted plants.  Glancing at the woods outside, she closed the long black curtains and headed to a row of lockers.  Unlocking her locker, she saw a bouquet of flowers inside.  Taking a card from the bouquet, she closed the locker and collapsed in one of the chairs.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp The inscription made her laugh.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp She heard the door open and looked back to see there was no one there.  Rising from the chair, she approached the door and tried the handle.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Locked and the key was gone.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Her first assumption was that someone was trying to play a birthday prank on her.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Looking around, she saw the curtain move slightly and moved forward.  Reaching out for the curtain, she ripped it open and saw nothing.  Her gullibility made her laugh as she backed against the chair.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Julian ripped open her uniform as he grabbed her from behind and tore into her flesh.<br>
<br>
Julian shoved the nurse's body in the cabinet in the lounge and folded the uniform under his arm.  Unlocking the door, he advanced into the empty passage and approached the open elevator.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp As the doors closed, he felt the elevator begin descending.  Waiting for it to stop and the doors open, he hurried out toward the morgue.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Staring at the corpses as he entered, his eyes prowled the empty room.  Even through he couldn't immediately see her, his senses insisted that she was still here.  &quot;Melissa.  You can come out.&quot;<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp She emerged from a small storeroom behind him, still covering herself with the sheet as her voice trembled with fear.  &quot;I didn't want to hurt anyone.&quot;<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp He tossed the nurse's uniform to her.  &quot;Put it on.&quot;<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Terror rose from the pit of her stomach when she saw the blood on the collar.  She faced him, hoping that he would not confirm what was scaring her.  &quot;What did you do?&quot;<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Julian glanced at her calmly, &quot;You need something to wear.&quot;<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp It was frightening how this was not bothering him.  Her gaze returned to the blood, her horror rose when she realised she didn't care either.  She tried to make herself care, &quot;You murdered a nurse?&quot;<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp He approached her, wanting her to accept her new life.  &quot;It is no different from you slaughtering foxes.  You had a craving that could only be satisfied by the death of those animals, there is no point in denying that hunger for the kill.&quot;<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Melissa dropped the sheet and found herself slipping into the uniform, feeling excited as the blood on the collar touched her flesh.  She stared at him, continuing trying to deny her growing indifference over the deaths.  &quot;That's different.&quot;<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Her reluctance to continously attempt to cling to her previous life was frustrating him, &quot;No, foxes are inferior to humans and they are inferior to us.  They are nothing more than food.&quot;<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Disgusted by her own apathy over killing, Melissa frantically shook her head and focused on her parents to try to make herself care.  &quot;I can't accept that.&quot;<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Julian saw the fear erupt in her eyes when she heard footsteps outside.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Feeling a surge of excitement go through her as she saw the door open, she felt her teeth lengthening.  She reacted with instinct.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Crashing into the hospital attendant, she smashed him to the floor.  Not wanting to deny her desire, she savagely tore open his throat.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Gulping down the blood, she felt the attendant becoming still and her pleasure fade as she looked at what she had done.  She tore her teeth from his flesh and backed away, staring at the lifeless body.  It scared her even more when she realised she no longer felt any remorse.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Julian grabbed her arm and pulled her toward the door, &quot;We can't stay.&quot;<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Melissa wiped the blood from her lips and turned toward him, trying to make herself feel disgusted that she wanted more.  She made her decision.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp She ran past him and disappeared through the door, hoping that her thoughts of family and friends were strong herself to stop her from wanting to go back to him.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp He followed her quickly, hoping to stop her from doing something rash.  Almost reaching the elevator, he saw her fearfully crouched in the corner as the doors closed.<br>
<br>
Opening the large gate to the yard. Gail tried to make herself believe that what happened to Melissa was not bothering her.  Returning to the motorcycle, she pushed it toward the barn.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Passing the front door, she heard someone moving in the barn.  Leaving her motorcycle, she approached the front door and unlocked it.  Deciding that if this was the nut that hurt Melissa, she was certain she would make him really sorry he was ever born.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Entering, she headed to a small cupboard hidden behind the television and removed the shotgun left to Melissa by her father.  Checking it was loaded, she returned outside and glanced toward the barn.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Cautiously stepping across the gravel, Gail raised the shotgun as she approached the door.  Opening the worn wooden door, she advanced into the darkness.  She heard footsteps on the wooden platform above.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Tightening her hold on the shotgun as she convinced herself it was Melissa's killer, she approached an old wooden ladder and began to climb.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp A rung broke under her weight and she crashed back down.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Rubbing her sore butt, she caught a glimpse of someone in the shadows.  She raised the shotgun and fired.  Seeing the figure fall, Gail rose to her feet and returned to the ladder.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Checking each rung as she began climbing up, Gail reached the platform.  Stepping onto the creaking wood, she saw the figure retreat into the shadows.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp She raised the shotgun again, &quot;Show yourself.&quot;<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp The figure remained in the shadows, moving to force her closer to the edge of the platform.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Flashing forward suddenly, the figure pulled the shotgun from her grasp and effortlessly pushed her over the edge.  Leaping from the platform, Julian landed next to her.  Kneeling over her, he gently tapped her cheek in an attempt to wake her.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp There was no response.<br>
<br>
Melissa pushed her way through the cemetery gate, snapping the padlocked chain with ease.  The church seemed to offer her sanctuary, but was overcome by fear when she tried to approach it.  Backing away, she turned toward the crypt entrance.  As she approached the rusted iron door, Melissa detected a highly arousing aroma.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Overcome by a strange sensation of excitement, she felt herself being pulled closer to the steps leading down.  Managing to pause, she could feel someone down there.  Her first thought was that Julian was waiting for her, the idea making her afraid of what he would do to her.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp While she struggled to wonder whether to run for it, she realised that her legs were taking her down into the gloom.  Becoming more nervous the deeper she went, the aroma made her think about the joy of making another kill.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp She saw the police officer lying on the stone floor, barely able to feel disgust over her disappointment that she had not killed him.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Trying to make herself revolted by her feelings, she realised the smell of blood on the man's shredded throat was making her desire stronger. She didn't want to stop herself when she knelt by the body and touched the gash, feeling the dried blood on her fingers.  She plunged her fingers into her mouth and licking the blood off her skin, relishing the taste.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp She stumbled back against a tomb as she tried to make herself feel something for the officer's death, but she could only imagine the delight of making another kill.  It made her feel sick that she didn't care about who she killed any more, even thinking about her parents wasn't helping.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Melissa fell against the steps, terrified by everything she wanted to do.  She scrambled out into the night air and collapsed against a gravestone, feeling it begin raining again.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Crying with fear, she remembered Gail.<br>
<br>
Splashing through a muddy puddle, Melissa collapsed against the broken fence as her feet sank into the thick mud.  Glancing toward the farm house, she concentrated on fighting her rising hunger and stumbled over the fence.  Crossing the muddy field, she staggered toward the house.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Reaching the yard, she glanced at dark windows.  At first, she thought Gail was out somewhere.  Then she heard the barn door bang shut, becoming aware of the delightful aroma flowing from inside.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp She fought the urge to rush inside and made herself enter slowly, drying her eyes to clear her vision.  She searched the dusty floor carefully, fearfully realising she would not want to stop herself from killing.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp A faint moaning drew her attention to a darkened corner.  She halted when she saw Gail on the floor, her eyes falling on the blood beneath her best friend's motionless head.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Falling onto her knees, Melissa dipped her fingers in the blood and desperately wanted to taste it.  She stopped, knowing there was someone else here.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Julian approached her, &quot;You have to take what you need.&quot;<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Melissa looked back when she heard Gail moan, her head beginning to stir.  Her gaze fell on the blood again, imagining how much she would enjoy taking her friend's life.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Her hunger began to take hold, but she managed to turn away.  Tears were flowing down her face when she focused on Julian, &quot;I can't hurt Gail, she's my best friend.&quot;<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Gail came round and opened her eyes, barely focusing on Melissa and Julian standing over.  Unable to believe Melissa was alive, she felt a sharp pain aching at the back of her head when she tried to rise.  Hastily feeling the wound, she felt the wet blood covering her fingers.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Horrified that she wanted to kill Gail, Melissa fought her desire to rip open Gail's throat.  &quot;You have to go.  You have to get as far away from me as you can, before I.&quot;  She glanced at Julian, reluctant to reveal what a monster she had become.<br>
 &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Approaching her, Gail became convinced she had fallen for a sick joke.  &quot;What is this?&quot;  The sigh of the soaked nurses' uniform made her pause, confused.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Desperately resisting her desire, Melissa found herself staring at her friend's exposed throat.  &quot;Gail, please go.  I don't want to hurt you.&quot;<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Continuing to urge her to kill, Julian remained motionless.  &quot;Give in to your desire.&quot;<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Her hunger raging, Melissa tried resisting wanting to satisfy her craving as she felt her teeth growing sharper.  &quot;I can't, she's my friend.  We grew up together.&quot;<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Bewildered over what was happening, Gail angrily wanted answers.  &quot;What's going on?&quot;<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Focusing on Melissa, Julian came up with a new way to try to make everything easier for her.  &quot;Make her one of us.&quot;<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Her desire was becoming unbearable.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Melissa gingerly moved forward, horrified as she felt her mouth becoming dry with the anticipation of the kill.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Staring at Melissa's smile with uncertainty, Gail felt herself becoming afraid of someone she had known for nearly all her life.  &quot;You're scaring me.&quot;<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Her instincts taking over completely, Melissa parted her lips to reveal her pointed teeth.  She grabbed Gail's wrist and pulled her closer.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Gail screamed as she saw the fangs and managed to free herself.  Dashing to the door, she found her way blocked by Julian who pushed her back.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Disgusted she was enjoying terrorising her friend, Melissa pinned Gail against the ladder and brought her lips toward the soft flesh of Gail's throat.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Her teeth plunging through the delicate skin, she felt the blood filling her mouth.  Feeling Gail struggling, she found that the struggle was increasing her satisfaction.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Suddenly managing to control herself, Melissa released Gail and collapsed.  The taste of her friend's blood in her mouth  made her feel sick.  &quot;I can't do this any more.&quot;<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Just wanting her to give in, Julian stepped over Gail's fallen body and approached Melissa.  &quot;Accept what you are.&quot;<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Melissa saw traces of sunlight begin appearing in the cracks of the barn walls.  She glanced at the open doors, the solution to everything becoming clear.  &quot;No.&quot;<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp The act of sacrifice confusing him, Julian watched her approach the doors.  &quot;You'll die.&quot;<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp She stopped at the edge of the sunlight hitting the floor and turned, tears flowing down her cheeks as she looked at Gail.  &quot;I can't go on like this, I am not a killer.&quot;<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Refusing to let herself think, she hastily opened the door and hurried into the cool breeze.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Facing the house, she felt the rain stop as she tried to ignore the pain erupting throughout her body.  Screaming in agony, she watched the flesh on her hands begin to drip onto the gravel.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Her legs weakening as she focused on the barn, her vision blurring as her eyes melted.  Instinctively crawling back, she continued to howl in pain.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Julian stood by the door, sickened by her screams.  Retreating into the darkness, he refused to watch her body become a heap of melted flesh and bone.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Glancing at Gail's body, he saw her moving slightly and tore open his wrist as he knelt over her.  Pressing it firmly against her lips, he felt her bite hard on his flesh and begin drinking. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub95.ezboard.com/ubellonakali.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Bellona Kali</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Child of Hate</span><br>  Posts: 79<br> <font color=#FF0000>(6/16/02 7:33:31 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub95.ezboard.com/ffantasystoriesforumfrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=15.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://pmp.4t.com/magelo/smallbell.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Blood Prey</span><hr size=1> O.o i love it!!<br>
