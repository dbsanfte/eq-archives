<br>
Chapter 9<br>
<br>
&quot;New Decision, Unbalanced Fight.&quot;<br>
<br>
<br>
The events from the day before where still fresh in everyone's minds. All who had been in the court room and witnessed what could have been described as an unbelievable power. Furthermore it was no apparent that Magus was much more than he seemed. This power that he had held both dazzled and frightened at the same time.<br>
<br>
All the judges had held a private conference to decide just what to do with Magus. It was obvious that they couldn't exactly let him go, but then again if they didn't who knows what he could do. The choice had come down to a contest between Magus and some of their brightest pupils from the local guilds. If he could certainly beat these people then his freedom would be earned.<br>
<br>
Of course Magus's grandfather had been listening in on this the whole time, as well as his father Cain. They both knew they would have to help Magus realize his full potential during this fight or else he'd never survive the task. If anything they had a brilliant idea on how to do this, and they knew full well what the consequences would be.<br>
<br>
They both knew that the coliseum was going to be closed to all but close relatives and the judges themselves. Included would be Kayla, and they had only one idea on which to get Magus riled up enough to go all out. The two simply nodded as they walked toward Cain's house, which is where Kayla had been moved to after the incident.<br>
<br>
Magus's grandmother knew from the looks on both their faces as they entered the house that something was up. Naturally Kayla could sense something as well, and it didn't settle to well with her. The elder woman had the kind of instinct to sense trouble, particularly when it involved these two old men. Though what was about to be proposed would even surprise her.<br>
<br>
&quot;Kayla, we're going to need your help in order to save Magus.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;We're gonna break him out?!&quot;, even for all she had been through she still had a thirst for excitement.<br>
<br>
&quot;No, we simply need you to go along with a plan we have. Dad will you please explain to her?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Well it's like this, if Magus doesn't manage to win a fight against three fighters today in the arena then things are going to get worse. We need you to follow our lead, you'll know when the time is right.&quot;, the old man had a wirier smile on his face, much to the dismay of the women in the room.<br>
<br>
<br>
Meanwhile Magus was being informed of just what was going to happen, of course naturally he had a good idea of who was going to be picked. In fact he knew who the three best fighters in the city where. What made matters worse is they all held a grudge against him for the time he accidentally got them caught up in a bar room brawl. This in turned had earned them each severe punishment from their respective guilds, as well as costing them a great sum of money for the damages.<br>
<br>
&quot;Just wonderful, going up against any of them is bad enough, but all three at once is going to be a nightmare.&quot;<br>
<br>
- The worst part is your not allowed any weapons, I'll be enjoying the view from the sidelines. -<br>
<br>
&quot;Weapons aren't my problem, its armor. Two of them will have armor that makes the stuff the guards use look like tin foil.&quot;<br>
<br>
- I guess that would be a problem. I hope you have a plan on a way to beat those three then. -<br>
<br>
&quot;Only plan I have is if I can pull off a miracle...&quot;<br>
<br>
- That's about what you'll need considering the shape your in. -<br>
<br>
Magus knew the Matsume had a point, his chances of willing where slim now. There where no plans possible that could help him in this situation. Sure he knew he was faster than before, but he had to assume they had gained just as much in speed as he had. This as well as the fact he knew all to well what kind of brute strength he was going to be facing.<br>
<br>
- Haven't you got any special techniques you know yet? -<br>
<br>
&quot;None I'm afraid Matsume, aside from my sword and hand to hand skills.&quot;<br>
<br>
- You mean you haven't a clue how to perform the 'Celestial Wake' or anything much like it? -<br>
<br>
&quot;I've never even heard of such a technique before.&quot;<br>
<br>
- Terrific, I guess that was going to be one of the more advanced lessons. -<br>
<br>
&quot;Well it's not my fault I'm in this mess! It's that perverted old man's fault.&quot;<br>
<br>
- You had best prepare for living hell, because that's what your body will feel like after today. -<br>
<br>
<br>
The three that Magus had spoke of consisted of the most fierce fighters from the Warrior, Paladin, and Monk guild. This wasn't going to be an easy task for anyone, and in fact they where favorites to win in the up coming tournament held in Freeport. The residents of Qeynos where certain that these three could make it to the finals. This included even the judges who had arranged this little exhibition fight.<br>
<br>
First off the most physically built up of the three was Zangulus, and there was good reason why. He was part barbarian, which gave him an advantage in strength over the other warriors in the guild. In fact rumors had recently spread about him having been able to knock down stone wall with a single strike of his war axe. Most people didn't question this for fear that they would find out the truth the hard way.<br>
<br>
The paladin that had been arranged was none other then a man most called Bart. Most of his talents lay in his ability to manipulate mana as well as heal himself and others faster than his other guild mates. This also meant all of his offensive spells packed a larger punch than most other paladins which is what truly made him deadly. If anything this alone was earn respect from most people outside his guild.<br>
<br>
Certainly the most fierce fighter of the three had to be Fei. The majority of the residents in Qeynos had already seen a glimpse of his abilities. This included his ability to smash through just about anything with his fists. As of late his training had increased beyond any that the local monks had ever endured before, which both brought him respect and the ability to avoid most conflicts.<br>
<br>
All three of them wanted nothing more than to grind Magus to a pulp. An with the recent noticed they had received all three of them had gathered in the arena. Today was the day they where going to settle the score with Magus, as well prove themselves to be the best Qeynos had to offer. This was all that their minds where focusing on, it was something they had been training for ever since they had been disgraced in Crow's Pub.<br>
<br>
&quot;You two ready to pound this little bastard into the dirt.&quot;, all Zangulus could do was smile.<br>
<br>
&quot;I know I'm ready to regain my honor from the disgrace he caused me, what of you Fei?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;I'm ready to prove his grandfathers techniques are nothing but rumors.&quot;<br>
<br>
<br>
Cain sat down in the stands of the arena, his plan was the last thing he could think of. Certainly it would be enough to push Magus beyond his limits. He knew doing this would most likely result in the kind of power that his grandfather, Shoken, was capable of. This was the kind of power that he was going to need to defeat the three people here today, an continue on to the tournament in Freeport.<br>
<br>
Kayla was still puzzled as to just what was going to happen. She had been uneasy about all this, and was reluctant to sit down along with the others. Something about this day just didn't feel right. She just knew something terrible was going to happen to Magus, she just didn't know what. Ever since she had been told that Magus fought off the assassin who threatened her life she began to think of Magus differently. It was like he had somehow become closer to here, though she wasn't certain of just how this was possible.<br>
<br>
Shoken knew that his grandson Magus was going to have to learn how to bring out his hidden power today. It was something he knew that would have eventually happened, though he didn't like these circumstances. Though this was the only way he could win this fight now, if something wasn't done he couldn't fathom what would happen next.<br>
<br>
<br>
Magus had a solemn look on his face as he was lead into the arena by his guards. All he could do was rub his wrists after the shackles where removed. He knew his chances of winning where slim, and what with Matsume having been returned to his grandfather, there was now no hopes of learning during the fight. Out of the corner of his eye he could see Kayla, he was glad she was here, it comforted him to know she was up and about.<br>
<br>
&quot;Magus, you do understand that if you lose this fight you face life imprisonment?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;I understand, and if I manage to win then what?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Then you'll be free to do as you wish.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;It's not likely your going to win with us three here! I'm going to show you just how strong I've become.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;And I'm going to show you just how superior my fighting style is compared to yours.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Prepare yourself whelp, its time took the punishment you so richly deserve.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;If everyone has said there piece, then let the fight begin!&quot;<br>
<br>
Magus was instantly on the defensive as his three advisari surrounded him. All he could do now was wait for one of them to make the first move, and only hope he could avoid the others. One on one he might have stood a chance, if he was in top condition, but the events from the previous day had left him drained.<br>
<br>
The first to strike was Fei as he launched a kick into Magus's side his in turn drove him towards Zangulus. This was the perfect setup for Zangulus as he brought his foot up and stopped Magus with it as well as driving him to the ground. This all left Magus in a daze, it was evident they had all improved greatly since he had last encountered them.<br>
<br>
With a quick snap of his hands he had managed to send Zangulus reeling off balance, which in turn gave him the chance to get back to his feet. This only proved to give Bart the target he wanted, he had been waiting for a clear shot and now he had it. Magus's felt his skin tingle as he was struck by a quick bolt of mana.<br>
<br>
At that Fei took it upon himself to rush in and show Magus just what he had learned. Unfortunately for Magus he wasn't in the condition to move and found a fist landing perfectly across his jaw. The world dimmed for a moment, that is until he found a round kick lodge into his stomach that sent him off balance and falling back into the massive body of Zangulus.<br>
<br>
All Kayla could do was watch on in horror as Magus was being systematically picked apart by the three in the arena with him. There was nothing she could do and this only made things worse for her. This was the worst feeling she had ever felt, not being able to help someone when she knew it was possible.<br>
<br>
Shoken on the other hand knew all to well that with Magus's previous injuries it was near impossible for him to do anything except this. He knew that the young man's talents leaned more towards using swords than his fists, but using a sword wasn't an option now. All he could do was wait until the time was right to give Magus the extra shove he needed to unlock his hidden talents.<br>
<br>
Magus was once again reeling from one of Fei's assaults, this time it was a flying kick that sent him towards Zangulus once more. Today though Zangulus had decided to bring with him one of his favorite weapons, a huge battle hammer, the likes of which would strain most men to pick up. This was what Magus felt was he was literally belted into the air by the hard mental end of the hammer.<br>
<br>
As his luck would have it Magus found himself coming down near Bart, which mean he was about to receive yet more punishment. Of course this just happened to the use of a shield that Bart happily drove Magus to the ground with. In truth Magus was hit so hard the shield had a dent from the impact on his head.<br>
<br>
For Magus the world was spinning around, he could feel something running down the side of his head. He knew for certain it had to have been blood, it couldn't have been anything else. All he could do was stand up and prepare for the next attack, hoping that something would present itself so that he could at least disable one of his foes.<br>
<br>
&quot;Stop it already! Leave him alone!&quot;<br>
<br>
In the distance Magus heard something, it was someone crying, it was a woman. He recognized the voice, but couldn't place that person as crying over him. If anything he still expected her to try and get back at him for all the things that had happened. He managed to once again bring himself to his feet, and glanced over towards Kayla.<br>
<br>
It was true, she couldn't believe it, but it was true. Kayla found herself crying over what was happening to Magus. She simply couldn't bare to watch any more of the abuse he was taking. This was worse than anything she had ever seen in her life, and knew Magus didn't deserve anything like this to happen.<br>
<br>
&quot;Look Magus has himself a girlfriend... She must be a tramp to go out with such a despicable person.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Maybe after this is all done she can show Zangulus just what she is? What is it that warriors believe in again?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;To the victor goes the spoils of war. Come to think of it she would look good without her cloths.&quot;<br>
<br>
At hearing this the judges naturally assumed the fight was over. It was apparent to them that Magus had no hopes of winning this fight now. They had played their hand and now knew that it was impossible for him to resist being imprisoned now. Everything had worked out the way they had hoped.<br>
<br>
Inside Magus's mind the meaning of all that he heard was beginning to sink in. Before he had heard those words his body had ached all over, but now the pain was receding. In place of the pain he was beginning to feel a burning sensation. It then dawned on him it was his own anger that was doing this. The rage he felt literally gave his body a burning sensation, without pain he now began to recover from his daze.<br>
<br>
&quot;And the winners are....&quot;, before the judges could announce anything they where interrupted.<br>
<br>
&quot;It's not over yet...... I'm not finished!&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Well it looks like he's standing again, the whelp must want more of a beating.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Your not going to touch her...&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;You've lost and we've won, face it, we'll do what we want!&quot;<br>
<br>
The Matsume could feel a change happening to Magus, it knew he was getting ready to break through the barrier that had been repressing his latent abilities. If anything it was prepared to witness the kind of power it's master was capable of. It was curious, it wanted to know more about what kind of talents Magus had, and it wanted to know more about that armor it had felt before.<br>
<br>
&quot;That's enough!!! You not going to touch her!!! I'll die before you do!&quot;<br>
<br>
The pendant around Magus's neck began to glow brightly. Cyrus felt its master's will, it felt him calling for power. Yet it was waiting, it some how knew he was calling for some other force as well, and it wanted to see just what that was. It wanted to experience just what its owner was fully capable of.<br>
<br>
An ethereal aura began to surround Magus's form, his eyes had now changed as they shined with a crimson light like that of a heated metal. Every inch of his body felt as if it was infused with a new found strength, and in reaction to this his muscles began to enlarge under the strain. The pupils of his eyes had completely disappeared, which gave him an eerie almost otherworldly look. <br>
<br>
This only proved to send chills up the judges spines, they hadn't expected this at all. If anything they where now regretting making the decision to hold this fight. Even worse was the fact that this was all happening without the appearance of the armor they had seen the day before. They weren't sure which to fear more, the fact he was capable of this without the armor, or what might happen if the armor appeared while he was like this.<br>
<br>
Kayla couldn't believe her eyes, but she could believe what she felt. It was Magus, he had become so powerful, and it was because of her. He had done this to once again protect her from these people. He was doing this to not for himself, but to up hold her dignity. This was something she would have never imagined Magus doing before this day.<br>
<br>
The first to move forward and test their mettle was Fei, who tried for his flying kick. Only this time he found himself being yanked from the air and sent hurling into the arena wall. The impact alone from his body was enough to cause the other two to wince. They knew Fei definitely wasn't going to be able to shrug that off.<br>
<br>
Zangulus was the next to try his luck, trying to buy Fei the time he needed to recover from that blow. He rushed forward with his battle hammer, swinging it down as he aimed for Magus's head. For a moment time seemed to slow down as Magus avoided the hammer and span around, ramming his foot into his attackers stomach. The sound of metal being bent, then cracking could be heard as Zangulus fell to the ground.<br>
<br>
This had bought Fei the time he needed to renew his assault, this time he rushed in with a flurry of punches. Try as he might though, he simply couldn't keep up with Magus now. Never before had he seen someone who could match him at full speed, that is until now. Before he could muster a defense he found a uppercut from Magus connecting with his stomach, this in turn caused him to double over.<br>
<br>
Bart watched on in horror as he frantically worked at healing Zangulus's wounds. Never before had he seen such damage caused by a simple attack. He knew full well that Fei was probably in the same shape as he finished doing what he could for Zangulus. In fact Fei was in worse shape as he lay on the ground coughing out mouthfuls of blood.<br>
<br>
Without warning Zangulus once again rushed into the battle again as Bart took up healing Fei. The warrior was now fully enraged and was determined to show Magus just why people feared him. Once again his best attempt at hitting Magus with his battle hammer was avoided, and now he was open once more.<br>
<br>
This was it for Magus, he was now tired of dealing with Zangulus and was going to put him out of commission. At deciding this he launched an assault of punches on the warriors face much more fierce than any monk could ever have. Just as Fei before him, Zangulus was hit with an uppercut to the stomach, only this one had enough force to raise him off his feet. The last thing Zangulus seen was a round house kick which connected with his face, that in turn drove him into the nearby arena wall.<br>
<br>
Bart knew he needed to buy some time for Fei to recover, so he did the only thing he could which was rush forward with his shield in front of him. This proved to be useless as Magus shoved his fist through the spot where the metal had become dented and then tore the shield from his attack's grasp. With that done the shield was threw aside causing it to skid across the dirt.<br>
<br>
It didn't take long for Magus to siege Bart's sword hand by the wrist. There was silence for a moment then the air was fill with a cracking sound and then howls of pain. Magus had broken his foe's arm at the wrist, and was now going to make short work of him. Another gruesome snapping was heard and Bart was just pushed away, his hands where now useless.<br>
<br>
The paladin had done just what he intended to do, he had bought Fei the time to get back to his feet and back into the battle. This time around he was more cautious as he slowly moved in searching for a open spot in Magus's defenses. Fei thought he spotted an opening and launched a round kick towards Magus's legs, only he found it to be soon blocked by a shin.<br>
<br>
This was all Magus needed as he grabbed a hold of Fei's head in a clench and proceeded to ram knee after knee into knee into his stomach. Fei then found himself flung away, he had lost a lot of his steam on that last assault and was barely able to breath. With his last bit of strength he lunged forward with a punch, only to have find it parried away.<br>
<br>
At having done this Magus once again grabbed a hold of Fei's head and leapt into the air, driving his knee into the center of his face. This wasn't the end of the monk's punishment though, with what was left of the momentum Magus had managed to completely flip over Fei. In turn when he landed this sent Fei to the arena wall once more.<br>
<br>
All the judges could do was stare on in both fear and amazement. Magus had managed to defeat three people who where each considered to be more than his equal. They had little time to contemplate this, since Magus turned his attention once again to them.<br>
<br>
&quot;I've beaten them, they can't fight anymore and they're lucky I spared their lives. I'll be leaving now...&quot;<br>
<br>
Magus felt his strength already beginning to wane as he looked into the stands at his family. Then his attention was brought to Kayla, he now knew she was safe from harm. It was then that he fell to one knee, exhaustion had finally set in. The great strength he had managed to summon was now fading away.<br>
<br>
Cyrus could feel this, and it now knew its owners limitations. It could now determine just what it could safely expose Magus to without harming itself or him in the process. Still the emotions it felt from its owner puzzled it greatly.
