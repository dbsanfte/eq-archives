<br>
I turned. Left.<br>
<br>
Why the HELL did I turn LLLLLLLLLLLEFT!?<br>
<br>
Woah. Back up. Need a bit of exposition for this, eh? Allrighty then. Here goes. I'm about 5'10&quot;, 165lbs, and I have spiked black hair. Not conventional spikes, mind you, but thick, burly spikes that fraggle off of my head as if they were pyres attempting to break free from my mortal dome. My eyes are black as well. Wellll, brown, like the hair, but I dyed the hair and got contacts. Changed them blue once on my own, though. That was pretty cool. I'm in pretty good shape, for my size. I'm just now 21, and that kicks SO much ass. Now I don't have to go and find other stupid people to buy me my alcohal! Yayyy!<br>
<br>
I grew up in Chicago, or at least the country/suburbs outside. I used to go to the Canadian border almost annualy, usually more, and I was a boy scout. Yea yea, a boy scout. Either way, I'm very nature oriented, which is why I moved to New York after that Sept. 11th deal &amp; whatnot; felt the need to reconnect to humans and get into the city environment... Only problem is this; it sickens me. I envision myself as the Bug from the original Men in Black movie with Will Smith and Tommy Lee Jones. Just... less cosmic nuisance, and more coffee shop hopper.<br>
<br>
Either way, I'm walking down that Little China Town place or what the hell ever for the first time. I've got on my baggy leather pants, it's mid autumn, and my hand-made fishnets are letting the breeze pass through. I've got leather straps across my chest, too, in a hexagonal fashion. I have scars up and down my arms in striping rows. I never had a problem with cutting, I just wanted some trippy designs, &amp; my parents ruled out the piercing or tattoo options when I was a kid. Oh yea, my name's Jack Daniels, by the way...<br>
<br>
Not.<br>
<br>
Well, that's what you'll know me from now on as. Either way, I turned left when the piece of paper in my hands said explicitly to go right to get to the noodle shop I was aimin for. I met a chick online at a cyber chat room, a RP room, and she blew me away with the elven sorceress she played. I myself usually am the darker, necromantic knight who's seen the lighter path, but cannot force himself to give up the dark arts. I love dark powers! On the other hand, I'm not as sun-vulnerable as most &quot;goth freaks&quot; my age, as I'm classified as. I really don't have the &quot;gotta kill em all&quot; attitude of a &quot;true&quot; goth, though...<br>
<br>
China Town. Right. Anyways, I turned left. That was... well, I don't know exactly why, but it was a pretty stupid thing, considering what happened next. There was a gunshot, and I did the only thing an unarmed, self-respectable, NORMAL, self-preserving human being would do; I ran. I don't know the number of twists and turns I ran through, because I lost count, but I was in no means in any kind of dark, secluded ghetto where I feared of getting mugged. Hell, people normally fear I'm gonna mug THEM even if I am in those places. I came to a tunnel on my right side, and a bridge above it. There was a car crash behind me; some limo got three bullets pumped into it, and some Chinese dude tried grabbin this little girl in the back seat. She had on a Catholic school girl outfit, and I nearly drooled before realizing she couldn't be over 18. I sighed, and realized what just happened; a limo got three bullets pumped into it!<br>
<br>
This time, I froze. I don't know what convinced me to stay where I was, between a bush and a brick wall, but I did. Either way, she got away... kind of. The guy put the gun in his coat before attempting to grab her, and she kicked him in the head once *good* before jumpin out the ride and running into the street. Women got no common sense, lemme tell ya...<br>
<br>
It was like a fuckin movie. A motorcycle starts jettin out of the tunnel, and is like, two feet away from pickin her up. Well, a bit further, maybe fifteen or twenty, but either way, inspiration hit me; kick a dirty fukkah! So I did. I ran into the middle of the street, hit to the air, and was at a 90 degree angle before I knew it. I was swinging my foot up towards the dude on the bike, and he kept comin on... Bet he tried to move before the leg hit him off the bike, and gave me a nice 540 before I finally ate pavement.<br>
<br>
The girl is still running, but now towards the motorcycle. I figure this guy wants her alive for something, cuz otherwise he'd a shot her, right?<br>
<br>
Better fuckin hope so.<br>
<br>
I get to the crashed bike first; it's still running, somehow. Miracle of GOD, anyone?<br>
<br>
I hop on, with my freakish clothing and black spiky hair, and scream, &quot;Soo-Ling, get on!&quot; The sexy, SEXY asian chick gets on back of this 2000 XZ900 (I think it was...), with me on the bars. I hit the gas, and we're off--- too bad I had never driven a motorcycle before.<br>
<br>
We keep going for a little while. I make a couple random turns, and she points to a little shop and starts screechin in my ear; something about pot roast or ear gravy or something, I dunno. Maybe it was just my stomach talkin. I pull into the alley next to this Chinese hut-lookin complex, and we step off the bike. I got a few scratches, and my left arm, the one I landed on, is looking purple and black. Soo-Ling leads me inside. &quot;By the way,&quot; she says with surprisingly little accent, &quot;My name is Mahri Ann,&quot; I introduce myself, and we shake hands. She smiles, and I can tell; this minor is diggin me.<br>
<br>
Ohhhhh shhit. Jailbait, leave me free...<br>
<br>
