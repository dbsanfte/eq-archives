One in front of her, a strange mask, made of porcelain  two small curved horns came up from it, the mouth was open in a strangely horrifying smile, the teeth where oddly curved the eyes where only open a slit. Seemingly from the voice echoed a Demon males<br>
“Destroy the Death angel”<br>
the one to her left, a female’s face framed in  a golden mask feathers came from both sides of the mask. <br>
“You could make her your own…private bringer of death, wouldn’t that be lovely?” she said in a seductive voice.<br>
 The one behind her. A child’s mask strange slivery hair came from it adorned with small purple bows. ”Don’t listen to them!, Killing is wrong!” it squeaked out, a small stitched up teddy bear was beside the mask..<br>
<br>
The final mask wrapped in  in black silk as she removed it, it was made of  onyx only the top half the bottom was a long veil.  The thing picked it up in bandaged hands, the nails where long and feminine. Blood was visible in patches on the bandages.” What, Do you say??” it asked in a soft fearful voice<br>
<br>
“…..”<br>
<br>
“Please. you have to talk to me!…I cant live without you..” it pleaded nearly crying<br>
<br>
“Teach her what it means to be. A Death angel, Let her awaken first..”<br>
<br>
 it placed the mask on shivering as the onyx crystals wrapped around its head, long raven hair grew forth spilling down, its garment, a full black cloak filled out in a woman’s form. As now she stepped up  the Demon mask adhered to her shoulder, the Seductive one came to her other one. The child’s mask came to her stomach, the hair from each disappeared except the one she wore on her face.<br>
<br>
“….The Mystic is in control….Excellent..” she raised her bandaged hands to the mask, her voice was smooth and held nearly a divine edge to it.<br>
<br>
She rasied her masked face to the sky. Her back shivered. As she started to walk on. With a sway of her hips.<br>
<br>
·&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp *  *<br>
<br>
Andareil screamed as the daylight hit her eyes staggering back. Into the arms of an lighter skin. A Human of all things. One of the few clans friendly to the drow most helped them along with getting used to daylight, thankfully the Masamune’s clothes on Andareil where suited to light and didn’t  burn..<br>
“my eyes…oh Lloth . . . What pain” Andariel whimpered as the human tried to comfort her<br>
“Its okay…don’t go so well blindly up next time … You need to have your eyes adjust or you’ll be blinded for good, and That’s a long time you being a Drow” the human male said, he had a somewhat elfin name, it was too long to say, so he was just referred to as Val. He wore  a flowing black cloak. The rest of his clothes where either black or white. Twin adamantie blades hung at each hip, tempered for daylight.<br>
<br>
“Okay…If I ever see the sun god Remind me to slap him a few times!. He almost @#%$ BLINDED ME!” Andareil whimpered more as  Val pushed her back into the daylight. She kept her eyes nearly shut, and went back in Val chasing after her. They repeated the process for a few days, Andariel swearing so much most of the birds left the exit of Underdark for good.(such a mouth on that girl!..O.o)<br>
<br>
finally, she looked up into the sky. A beautiful morning, the sun had just risen. A pinkish glow was all over the clouds, the soft chirping of birds echoed in the trees bringing forth soft winds of flower petals and leaves past andareil, she smiled softly closing her eyes, letting the morning sun warm  her.<br>
<br>
“You look like an Angel” Kor said softly still staying in the dim shade. It was a very dramatic picture andareil bathed in sunlight, and her love. Kor wrapped in violet gold trimmed robes. A soft smile made  him look even more attractive<br>
<br>
“Come out with me?” she asked turning to him, a light blush was on her face as she held out her hand to him.<br>
<br>
“…..Yeah, Okay” he stepped out taking her hand as she smirked evilly bringing  him into a tight embrace her hands already on his bum<br>
“eep”<br>
“mwahaha!” Andariel giggled softly giving him a soft pinch then ran off<br>
“damn you!” he ran after her nearly tripping over his robe, he was NOT going to heft it up like some over dressed lady, Besides Andariel would be laughing for YEARS on that.<br>
<br>
 She ran thru the woods a impish smile on her face as she ran ducking just under various low hanging branchs as she skidded to a halt her arms held up as she came upon a clearing. <br>
<br>
The sun came thru shedding a greenish light upon a robed man,  he had soft blonde hair in uneven locks covering nearly his eyes, two small spectacles nearly covered his eyes they where a soft hazel. More on the green side. He smiled lightly at the Drowess, as Kor came behind her running into her”ahhh!” they where tangled up at the man laughed softly covering his mouth with a gloved hand as he kneeled close to them” Are you two okay?” he held back a laugh as they got up brushing themselves off<br>
“Got ya” Kor said softly smirking at Andariel as she struck her tongue out at him<br>
<br>
“Are..You both Drow?” he asked softly tilting his glasses up. As Andariel moved close to him raising her arms up halfway and growled at him playfully”grr I’m a drow! I’ll eat your soul..GRR!!” she broke into giggles as the human smiled softly laughing lightly.<br>
<br>
“..You act like a kid” he remarked softly as she straightened ”I’m Andariel, and I am by drow standards…im only 90”<br>
<br>
“You?” he asked to the male<br>
“…call me Kor” he said” Im only 89” he said softly swirling his hand in the air, mana following closely after it making a somewhat phsyedllic effect<br>
<br>
“Ah im a researcher of sorts, my names Valeth” he bowed softly”Ah!, Is that the Masamune!?” he asked kneeling again inspecting the sword<br>
“Yeah…” she said softly<br>
<br>
“…Intresting..” he stood up again<br>
“I’ve set up camp nearby..would you stay for breakfast atleast, I’ve never talked to Drow before” Valeth said.<br>
They walked to his camp, Kor had a bad feeling about him… Humans where supposed to be afraid of them, not invite them to breakfast casually..and Andareil…she was too damned trusting!<br>
<br>
The Human was preparing business, he was actually a good cook, a small breakfast of bacon and eggs. And toast. Yay . Andariel was eating normally, way to fast for a lady meaning.<br>
<br>
Kor was going slowly noting the way to Human moved, there was something about him that was off. He wasn’t insane…but he was certainly an odd one, his intelligence was startling frist off. He was talking back and forth with Kor, which a human could seldom do. The Human even had some intresting magic’s at his disposal. Also…he was JUST WERID!!.. No humans ever treated Drow as equal. Most where scared, or wary but this..Human..if he even was human was perfectly naturual!..Friggin..<br>
<br>
“What are you!” Kor finally said coming out of his internal monologue.<br>
<br>
“A Watcher” Valeth said sipping some tea he recently finished looking intently at Kor<br>
<br>
“….What Are You” Kor said again his violet eyes narrowing<br>
<br>
“I Already said it, Im a Wacther..I have been since one thousand years ago…during the Time of Lilith” Valeth said removing his tea from his lips blowing the steam away<br>
<br>
“…..You’re an lunarian?” Andareil asked blinking at Kor, as she finished off the final scrap of bacon it sticking out of the side of her mouth as she chewed.<br>
<br>
“Yes…I am”<br>
<br>
“Where are your wings?” she asked swallowing as she drank some of the tea to wash down the bacon and eggs<br>
<br>
“They Tend to attract attention, Mostly unwanted..There are few Lunarian’s for a reason Andareil..Many think there Death Angels and  destroy them…I lost my Brother to the bastards..that’s The Reason why im here” he stood up setting his tea cup down”To Avenge my Race, and destroy the Grimorie!<br>
<br>
“Why do you want to destroy some ancient book?” Kor asked  looking  up at Valeth<br>
<br>
“Its sentient” Valeth said lightly<br>
“Holy @#%$..”Andareil said softly<br>
<br>
“It has something against Lunarian’s….it summoned forth countless powerful Abominations to destroy my Race…and is controlled by the Lich known as<br>
Va’Shargess, the Corrupter.<br>
<br>
“..Va’shargess..That’s the Drow lich!..” she blinked stepping away<br>
<br>
“ I do not blame your kind Andareil..More I need your help, You are the bringer of death. Shi Tenshe..You’re the only one who has the power to destroy the Lich!” Valeth said as he stepped forward pleading to Andareil.   Kor blinked” Destorying Liches isn’t an easy thing only a very powerful cleric can destroy one,Or a Lunarian” he said his Violet gaze falling on Valeth<br>
<br>
“Im a Fallen now, I’ve lost any remement of the Divine in me..my power is stuck here,but I would be glad to help you find the Four Lich..and destroy them..doing so will give you your wings..or kill you” he Said with no emotion in his voice as he started to walk away..a ball of Faerie fire glanced by him slamming into a tree singing   nearly thru it.. he stopped… turning around his hazel eyes looking straight into Andareil’s blue crystals. “We’ll help you” she said softly Kor blinked”Why?”<br>
<br>
“…The Marks began to hurt…Its closer” she said bitterly<br>
<br>
“take a day to say good bye to your friends and loved ones..meet me at the dock. At dusk” Valeth said as they parted company.<br>
 <br>
<br>
 *                   *                    *<br>
<br>
<br>
Andareil and Kor parted ways..Andareil asked her Mother and Clan if she could take her final rite of passage into the full role of the Shi Tenshe.<br>
<br>
She was accepted given a few relics of the Clan. An amulet of Lloth. The Spider queen of all drow. A spider shell gantlet swordsmen gantlet, and a black cloak made of Drider silk.<br>
<br>
<br>
(in Andareil’s apartment)<br>
<br>
she was busy packing nearly everything into a very small glyphic pack. A Drow version of the Bag of holding. The long spider silk cloak clung to her curves perfectly. A bell sleeved shirt covered her torso nicely. More adhereing to the Human’s sense of modesty when the Drow..have none whatso ever.a long black skirt slit up both sides was at her waist. Her katana at her left hip. “Daughter..I don’t want to lose you like your brother” Andareil’s mother said softly disturbing her daughter’s reverie .<br>
“Im not going to be killed..” Andareil said softly as she removed a weapon that nearly brought tears to her eyes. a demon bone scythe. Owned by the Reaver- Fyodor Ka’Ryusa.<br>
<br>
“…..Brother..”Andareil closed her eyes holding the Demonic weapon to her. As she pressed her cheek to the side of the blade. It was warm…<br>
<br>
<br>
“Still warm…”<br>
<br>
“That means he still watches over you Andar” her mother said as Andareil  wrapped her arms around her mother as they shared an embrace”Im watching over you aswell..Take this..” her mother presented a blue serpent whip. 3 hydra like serpents looked up at Andareil as she took it. They squeeked as they curled around her. Two around her arms the other settled itself on her head.<br>
<br>
“..But im not a priestess..” Andareil protested. But they were too cute!<br>
<br>
“..That blood to make them was taken when you where a baby..Your ready for it..You’ve taken brief priestess training..and you hold Lloth in your heart, Use it to whatever goals you have..but bring us Honor” her mother said as she stepped away..walking her to the exit of   the Underdark.<br>
<br>
Kor was there too. In a violet robe with an image of Lloth on the front the gigantic spider’s <br>
<br>
“Your coming too” andareil smiled softly at her friend. Kor’s violet eyes looked into hers with such determination..then softened as he smiles softly”Lets go outside..”<br>
<br>
(okay..yes im still alive..barley damn Vampires..stop biting me!*uses evil garlic breathe!!*)<br>
