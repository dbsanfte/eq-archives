<br>
Im not actually looking for an answer... I just feel bad for you cause youll attack anyone that posts here...even if they want to help you.  /sigh  (by attack I simply mean argue every point anyone makes..)<br>

Anyway, you HAVE said those things in the past that Ugle and Daly mentioned whether thats how you meant them or not, that is how we all feel when we read them...like you think everyone but you is an idiot and bad person.  So Im thinking the problem isnt your bad intent but your complete lack of PEOPLE SKILLS.  You might not mean anything negative when you say things but the way you talk is insulting and makes people not like you....<br>

Now your response to my last statement is..the problem isnt you or what you say but the fact that we are all jaded and think their is INTENT when there is not and we just want to hate you no matter what....dont you understand yet?

I am trying to help you here, I know youll prolly not pay attention to any of this but I hope you think about it a little bit...I think youd be so much happier if you just stopped assuming we all hate you and saw that some of us are reaching out only to be shot down by you in short order.<br>

&quot;Anyway, you HAVE said those things in the past that Ugle and Daly mentioned whether thats how you meant them or not, that is how we all feel when we read them...like you think everyone but you is an idiot and bad person.&quot;<br>
<br>
Re-read what you said here, my friend. First, you contest my statement that I never said these things... without proof, without any support outside your belief otherwise. I repeat, I have never said the things Daly asserts. Show me a quote that proves this wrong. A quote. Not a sentence that you FEEL that's what it means. <br>
<br>
Secondly, you say 'whether that's how you meant them or not, THAT IS HOW WE ALL FEEL when we read them'... so you're basically saying I'm responsible for how you decide to take something, for how you feel, that its my fault if you get offended, yada, yada, yada. <br>
<br>
Sorry, Ailya. I'm not. If someone chooses to be offended at something I say, and despite any clarification (if they ever bother to ask for it), choose to hold their interpretation against anything said contrary, that is entirely their choice. <br>
<br>
&quot;So Im thinking the problem isnt your bad intent but your complete lack of PEOPLE SKILLS. You might not mean anything negative when you say things but the way you talk is insulting and makes people not like you....&quot;<br>
<br>
The way I talk is fairly straightforward. Sometimes, people think I should talk otherwise, and if my goal were to please everyone around me, perhaps I would. Indeed, sometimes I do. But that choice is mine to make, not yours, not theirs, and certainly not for any reason that boils down to, 'do it my way or I won't be your friend'.<br>
<br>
&quot;Now your response to my last statement is..the problem isnt you or what you say but the fact that we are all jaded and think their is INTENT when there is not and we just want to hate you no matter what....dont you understand yet? Its not everyone else in the world...its the way you talk to people, YOU.&quot;<br>
<br>
The way I *talk* to people no one here can speak to... but the way I *write* to people is subject to a variety of interpretations, isn't it? <br>
<br>
I have never once said I thought anyone hated me. Period. But this is a beautiful example of how what someone inferred shows up repeatedly as my words when they are, in fact, not my words at all. I do believe many of the people I'm talking about infer my intent freely, often, and communicate it to others as fact when it is their *opinion* or *interpretation*. I find this kind of issue with these certain people occurs consistently enough to justify my belief as to how it occurs. <br>
<br>
Of course, you'll read this and say, 'Well you *know* what I mean.' ... and frankly, therein lies the problem. The assumption has no foundation outside the head of the person making it, yet its held. But even that isn't the issue. I can't control how people think, nor do I want to. <br>
<br>
The issue arises when that thought, opinion, interpretation is inevitably presented as *mine* when in reality, it is *someone elses*. For example -- the way I quote people when I reply to them. I never add or remove anything from a quote. Hell, I don't even correct the spelling or grammar. They are all verbatim. I never put quotes out of order when I reply to them. I don't do these things because they change the context of the words and that isn't my intention. Kinda silly to quote something if you're not going to maintain the integrity OF the quote. <br>
<br>
YET -- today, many people will say I quote people out of context or add or change their words. Completely untrue, but there it is -- 'common knowledge'. A perfect example of this at work. No one can show me a single example of my doing this... but somehow, everyone miraculously is convinced I do it. <br>
<br>
Is it my fault someone decided to make the assumption? Of course not. <br>
<br>
Is it my fault that, once made, someone preferred to keep it regardless any statement that shreds it to bits? Of course not.<br>
<br>
Should I be bothered that someone who prefers to do so winds up with a bad image of me? Of course not. <br>
<br>
Of course, of the three, the latter is usually the one that stings. I am, after all, just as human as the rest of you. I don't have any issues with letting fault lay where it belongs... but I admit, it is really very hard for me to understand how someone could be told or shown straight out they've misunderstood or mis-read something and still prefer to work under the misunderstanding. The only thing I can figure is they've really invested a lot of *something* in that conclusion that is more valuable than reality. (And yes, that would be my assumption... heh.)<br>
<br>
The sad part is, there's no way to correct by this time. So we all miss out on knowing one another. <br>
<br>
&quot;I am trying to help you here, I know youll prolly not pay attention to any of this but I hope you think about it a little bit...I think youd be so much happier if you just stopped assuming we all hate you and saw that some of us are reaching out only to be shot down by you in short order.&quot;<br>
<br>
Umm, I don't think anyone hates me, Ailya. I think a lot of folks misunderstand me. I think the written word without context leaves a LOT to be desired. I think sometimes, people prefer the conclusion they think they 'know' to going through the process of adjusting it. And I've never shot down anyone who has come to me as a friend. Ever. Ask around.<br>
<br>
&quot;ps. Did you see my message to you on my guilds website? It was deleted after a few hours but I was hoping you got to read it anyway...&quot;<br>
<br>
Alas, no. I suppose it must have been something nice. Oh well. <br>

Everyone has their own mind, opinions and feelings.  I  highly doubt someone would &quot;hate&quot; you just from things they have heard about you Gamiene.  More so from things they themselves have witnessed, or have had done to them by you.  No one is perfect and to claim so is utterly rediculous.  Obviously you are disliked to a certain degree otherwise this post would have never been started.  Perhaps you started this post to generate some sympathy?  ~shrugs~ one will probably never know.  <br>
<br>
I have witnessed actions from you and yes, I have even heard stories of why people dislike you.  But my opinion of you is based soley on fact.  Also, you should realize, since I know you are a smart person, that if you attack someone's friend then you are going to recieve backlash for it.  Every action has an equal and opposite reaction.  Yet you almost seem surprised at the reaction you get at times.  <br>
<br>
Once you have burned someone, that person or persons is not likely to welcome you back with open arms and forget the incident which has upset them.  While Im sure you have been nice to people, you have also been hateful to people as well.  I say this with the knowledge that people are not going to have feelings of dislike for you with no reason to support it.  In the end, you have alienated yourself, and you have no one to blame but yourself.  While I will admit that people can change, once someone has done something to a person so many times, their opinion of that person will not change.  Its human nature.  <br>
