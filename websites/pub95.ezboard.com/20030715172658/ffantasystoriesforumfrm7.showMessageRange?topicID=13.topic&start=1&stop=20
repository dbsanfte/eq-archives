Groaning, Carmen forced herself into a sitting position. Her black tank-top rode up, showing off her defined abs.<br>
<br>
Looking around she saw Jerron, sprawled out on the floor. It was very seldom he'd pick up a drink, but last night he gave in. For the past month, 3 of their friends had been missing, and the loss of their presence was beginning to take its toll. <br>
<br>
Sighing, Carmen let her sleek blonde hair fall around her shoulders and down to her mid-back. She took the band that had been holding it away from her face and put it around her wrist. <br>
<br>
Carmen pulled her knees to her chest, hugging them to herself tightly. Laying her forehead on her knees, a single tear rolled down her cheek. She missed Jash. Derek. Mika. They were all special to her. Even if she hadn't known them very long...<br>
<br>
Turning her head slightly, she looked over to Nefer. She was curled up in the recliner, a beer barely being held by her frail hand. Nefer was really taking the most emotional beating. She hardly ate, always slept. Jerron and Carmen both tried their hardest to get her to let go a little, but they were even taking a massive beating. <br>
<br>
Closing her eyes, Carmen thought about Devin. He left early that morning to meet up with his girlfriend, Kali, that was her name. She hardly came around the apartment anymore, bad karma or something. Carmen supposed she was waiting until things settled down. <br>
<br>
Tears were beginning to accumulate at the corners of her eyes, she wasn't about to cry though. She swung her feet off the couch, and forced herself to stand. She had gotten used to running around the apartment in just a tank-top and her underwear. Jerron didn't seem to care, and Nefer was a girl too. She understood what it mean't to just let go at home. <br>
<br>
Stepping over Jerron she grabbed a blanket and took it over to Nefer, and put it over her. She removed the beer bottle from her hand, then pushed a piece of her light chesnut hair away from her eyes. The last month had brung Nefer and Carmen close. Especially, once Carmen's father kicked her out, said since she's never home anyways she might as well not live there. Sorry, she was busy tending to her friends, to herself. <br>
<br>
After going to the kitchen to throw out the bottle, she walked back to the living room and laid a blanket over Jerron. Kneeling beside him, she ran a finger over the side of his face, quietly she spoke, &quot;They're alright...&quot; Carmen said to him, but mainly to herself. <p><!--EZCODE CENTER START--><div style="text-align:center"><br>

Progressivly over the minutes the russling became more of a struggle against unseen demons in her dreams. 6:59. One minute away, but would today be any acception? <br>
<br>
&quot;NOOO!&quot; <br>
<br>
Nope. 7:00 am, right on cue. Throwing herself back just seconds before her mind was shocked back into reality she caused the chair she slept in to topple over and herself to roll out. <br>
<br>
&quot;Nefer!&quot; Just like every morning for forever it seemed, Carmen was at her side, brushing her hair from her forehead with eyes tainted in worry. Sleeping in usually wasn't an option around the small Nefertiti, at least not at 7:00 am. At the same time she woke up, almost always screaming or flailing about. It scared her friends, only because she wouldn't talk about it. Not that she talked much in the first place, except to Carmen. It was the sheer fact that they had no idea what plagued her dreams and tormented her sleep in such a way that it would knock her from her chair screaming at a volume that made their stomachs tighten with fear and their heads swim with worry. She wasn't hurt, rattled, but not hurt. Thinning arms clung tightly around Carmen, this morning was the worst yet. Nefertiti's eyes had all but lost the tiny glimmer they once held, and now she looked like a shadow of her former self. It was nearly impossible to get her to smile, she was withdrawn and never left the house without one of her friends, but her weight was probably the thing that changed the most. Before she had at least some muscle, but now she was all skin an bones. Barely weighing in at 96 pounds her friends began to worry if a docter should be called. Then again, 95 was an improvement from two months ago when it was only 87. They thought they were going to lose her for a little while there. Hopefully her eating habits would continue to improve at the rate they were, then maybe she'd be eating normally again by the end of the year, which was just around the bend. <br>
<br>
Nefertiti felt a hand run through her hair comfortingly and her grip loosened. By not Carmen knew exacatally how to calm her without words. They both knew that nothing could be said to help the painful situation they were in. Sighing heavily, Nefer rested her head on Carmen's chest. The beat of her heart ringing in her ear helped her relax and forget about the dream. Today would be a better day. She could feel it in her bones. She might eat something for breakfast, she felt a little hungery, and then maybe head out to the gym with one of the group- she missed being physically strong. She remembered when Derek used to take her to the gym to lift weights, he said every girl should be strong enough to take care of herself cuz bein pretty didn't get ya everything. She missed him. And she missed the others, espeshally Mika. Nefertiti had taken the loss of her three friends as if the entire group had died and left her alone and sometimes she felt that way and often thought that way. Tears would have been running down her cheeks by now, but they wouldn't. She couldn't even cry anymore. Hugging Carmen tighter, she burried her face in her shoulder. At least, she thought, with every tear I don't shed, I become that much stronger. Once you're at the bottom, there's no where else to go but up.<br>

He had been reclusive before the loss of his friends, but his current stage was far worse.  There hadn't been a single time in that last few months that he had cared to crack a smile, not once.  And the eyes that had at one point playfully changed colors had settled on a dark gray.  But he had tried.  He had put on a brave face for Nefer for months, and in effect, himself.  Neither had emerged from the dark shadow of sorrow.  Carmen was strong.  Maybe it was the fact that she had not known the group for as long, was not as attached, but Jerron knew the truth.  She had a will of iron and the spirit to survive.  He had no such will.  Last night he had been weak, endulging in the blissful mindlessness of alcohol.  He found himself turning far more often to the bottle.  An empty feeling in his stomach told him he must eat.  In truth, he had not touched food for the past few days, often merely taking a sip of tea.  His stomach was too weak for anything else.  The rumbling in his stomach turned to a roiling sickness as Jerron ran to the bathroom.  The poisonous contents of his stomach were now the poisonous contents in the toilet, and his clear head was now struck with pangs of pain.  For an hour, he sat over the toilet, staring down.  The question he knew he must answer, should I flush, or do I stay tore though his mind.  But the true question had nothing to do with that.<br>
<br>
OOC(I love the start Ell, just a few questions.  Where are we?  I know Jerron had a place, and Carmen was kicked out of home.  So, are we at Jerrons, Nefer's, or some new place, +what happened to the other three?  Maybe I missed it....I have a horrible short term memory.  Well, anyways, you started it wonderfully, both your posts were great.) <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub95.ezboard.com/bfantasystoriesforum.showUserPublicProfile?gid=dahnyella>Dahnyella</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_lightning.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Child of Mischief</span><br>  Posts: 82<br> <font color=#FF0000>(12/19/02 4:29 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub95.ezboard.com/ffantasystoriesforumfrm7.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=13.topic&index=3>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> S'Just Life</span><hr size=1> Carmen was sitting at the kitchen table, scrawling a grocery list on the legal pad before her. Living with out her Dad was tough, especially under circumstances, but Nefer, Jerron, and Devin helped get her along. Knowing she still had them. <br>
<br>
Out of the corner of her eye, Carmen saw Jerron make a run for the bathroom. 'Must be a hang over,' Carmen thought. She'd leave him be... Seconds ticked, by followed by minutes. Soon the half-hour mark... Then 6:44 rolled around. <br>
<br>
Carmen decided to go check on Jerron who was still in the bathroom. Rapping on the door lightly, she called, &quot;Jerron, Hon? You alright?&quot; When he didn't answer she was near panic. Opening the door she saw him huddled over the toilet. Putting a hand on her chest she, kneeled beside him and flushed the toilet.<br>
<br>
Placing a tender hand on his back she rubbed it, there was no need for words. Carmen just wanted to comfort him, by his grave looks she decided to keep quiet for now.<br>
<br>
Time ticked on, and Carmen sat with Jerron, but then... that thud rang through the apartment. Pushing herself onto her feet, Carmen bolted out of the bathroom.<br>
<br>
As she ran back into the living room, the drenched rats' nest that made her hair flung water every where. The accumulated water on her body, soaked her clothes, but it was better than being naked, no need to scare Jerron that early in the morning.<br>
<br>
&quot;Nefer!&quot; Carmen cried as she slid a foot across the carpet towards her petrified friend. Carmen's arms encircled Nefer, holding her close. Brushing Nefer's chesnut hair away from her face, she sighed. Her stomach was in complete knots of worry as she wiped the tears from her frail friend's cheeks. &quot;Nefer... Shhh... Sugar... It's alright,&quot; Carmen said quietly next to her ear. <br>
<br>
As Neferiti cried in her arms, Carmen stroked her hair, and let her release the tension that was building inside of her. Glancing at the clock on the antique DVD player, Carmen sighed. It was 7:02 in the morning. It seemed like this happened every morning, at the same time. No, that was a lie. It DID happen every morning at the same time, and every morning the episode grew worse. Every morning Carmen felt a new pang of fear, a new knot of worry. <br>
<br>
Nefer's skeletal frame began to loosen its grip on Carmen, the chaos was almost over for the morning. Leaning her head against Nefer's, Carmen looked up to see Jerron, moving the chair back into its correct position. He'd been too distraught to use the force of his mental capabilities anymore. It worried Carmen, grandly, but he was getting used to old-fashioned ways of living. <br>
<br>
Carmen rubbed Neferiti's back, then quietly started, &quot;Nefer, why don't you go take a shower? Jerron and I'll worry about breakfast. You need to eat something.&quot; Glancing up to Jerron, she hoped he got teh message he needed to, too.<br>
<br>
Feeling Nefer's head move up and down against her shoulder, Carmen let her go. Watching her head down the hall, she sighed, then she realized Neferiti hadn't cried. Only at first out of fear, but then... she was just... paralyzed in a way. Looking up to Jerron, Carmen's violet eyes glazed over a little, then she shook her head brushing away the sadness. She needed to be strong for Nefer, for Jerron, for herself. Neferiti was alright for now, but Carmen had a breakfast to fix...<br>
<br>
/OOC That was awesome, Bellie! Yeah, that happened to my post on that other RP we're all doing with Rill's chars, I said screw it though, and I'll just wait for another couple posts then post my say. Now, Jerron... I left it so we all have no idea what happened to Jash, Mika, Derek... so that way if they come back, they can come up with some story and get back in. Captured by Keeters... needed to get away... etc. etc.  But I think over time we'll declare them dead by an obituary, or their parents calling and pleading us to the funeral. Also, as for where are we? I was thinking we were at your place. Hope that helps.

She was so fragile.  People are always saying those who seem the weakest are truly the strongest, but when Jerron laid his gray eyes upon her shattered form, he saw no strength.  What had happened to her, what has happened to US!  The pungent smell of the burning eggs brough him back to reality.  Mika used to do the cooking...  There were three plates laid out, but he filled only two.  He had cooked only enough for the ladies, and didn't feel like eating, himself.  No, he had other worries.  The money he had gotten from hawking Shadow's car was almost up and rent wasn't cheap.  Walking slowly, he made his way to Carmen, leaning over Nefer's still form.  Quietly, he whispered in her ear.  &quot;I'm going out, cash.&quot;  Twice he had done this before over the last month.  At one point, guilt would have riddled his soul, but now...no.  Now, he had to worry about surviving for three.  Grabbing his coat on the way out, Jerron knew where to go.  Where to get the biggest wallets.  He would return with money for the week, or if he was lucky, the month.  If he wasn't, the only way he'd see his friends again is from behind steel bars with an inhibitor strapped to his head. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub95.ezboard.com/bfantasystoriesforum.showUserPublicProfile?gid=ryvian>Ryvian</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Warlord of Delnor</span><br>  Posts: 205<br> <font color=#FF0000>(12/19/02 8:39 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub95.ezboard.com/ffantasystoriesforumfrm7.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=13.topic&index=8>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Ok here goes, older bro to the resuce</span><hr size=1> Walking down the street, Andrew looked around the crowd.

Carmen knew she was hungry, hell, she knew both Jerron and Nef were too, but they were too depressed to eat. It scared her. But now... it'd would just be Nefer and Carmen for breakfast. Jerron was leaving, though she doubted even if he stayed he'd eat. <br>
<br>
Her heart stopped beating, but as Nefer made her way down the hall to the bathroom, she pushed herself to her feet. Before Jerron got to the door she grabbed his arm, but from there she didn't really want to say a word. Carmen just, well, held on.<br>
<br>
Sadness washed over her, when Jerron refused to turn and look her in the eye. &quot;Jerron...&quot; Carmen said quietly, sadness and worry laced her silky voice. She didn't know where he went or even what he did, but he'd left like this at least twice now, maybe even three times. <br>
<br>
Carmen's storm-filled eyes, watched the back of his head, hoping he'd turn. She wanted to inquire what he was about to do, but maybe it was best just to let him go. <br>
<br>
Releasing Jerron's arm, Carmen stepped infront of him and got the door for him, but there was something, someone blocking the way...<br>
<br>
The heap on the ground, resembled a hybrid of cat and human, there was only one of those she knew... <br>
<br>
&quot;Oh my... God...&quot; Carmen muttered as she knelt beside him. She didn't want to touch him, because she was scared of hurting him. His shirt was ripped half-way to Sunday, and his ear was bleeding. Reaching out to touch his ear she pulled her finger back. Carmen really didn't want to touch a place that was injured. <br>
<br>
Scared violet eyes looked up to Jerron, as she placed a hand on Devin's back. The rise and fall motion of his back, indicated breathing, she was oh-so thankful for that. Was he awake though? &quot;Devin...&quot; Carmen called to him quietly, as she shook him lightly, trying to rouse him, &quot;Talk to me...&quot;<br>
<br>
/OOC YAY! Matt's joining us! Okay, shalt I fill thee in on the previous &quot;Chapter&quot;. There were these 8 young folks(teens to mid twenties). Derek, Neferiti, Mika, Jash, Jerron, Devin, Carmen... Was Kali one of the Octaine? I don't remember, but anyway. They each stood for a color, and a thing. Like I was blue and money. Together, they helped eachother function. Like a big unit. Derek was kind of like the leader. Anyway, they kind of had a rival &quot;Gang&quot; you could say. They were Keeters, but in this &quot;Chapter&quot; I'd like to refrain from them, or atleast when we get into fights let's not go all out and let the fight scene last for gazillion posts? Anywhoo... We were running from them, and yadaya... the RP fell apart... So... I just kinda said well... Dean, Paradise, and Sue haven't posted in eons... Let's assume something happed to them, we don't know what yet, but we'll roll the story from here. With the remaining 5, though Kali and Devin aren't really staying at Jerron's. Having problems, dealing with depression and getting by. <br>
<br>
BTW! A big part of this RP was it was futuristic. Like most electronics were mentally controled. Jerron was great with his mentalities, but he's kind of fallen apart now. At least I've assumed. Carmen was a boarder. Tryck'n was her thang, but she doesn't really board anymore. Let's see Jash was her kind of like boyfriend, but he's missing like Derek and Mika. Mika and Nefer... Either were REALLY close friends or lesbian. I never asked. Uhm...What else... I dunno... Rillen, Bellie? What are your additions? <p><!--EZCODE CENTER START--><div style="text-align:center"><br>

It was like they were going out, but not completely officially. Either way they were 'together'. Nefertiti was supposed to be *very* strong in the end (mental powers wise) but we never got close to the end so she was still unsure of whatever powers she might have held. She's always been extremely confused about herself and the world. She tends to cling to one or two people, and though she's close to others, she doesn't tend to show it well. She's never felt comfortable with her words and never really known how to show affection except when someone *NEEDS* it to go on. She's overly secretive and has all but shut down. Derek had been her 'protecter' and strength support since they were kids and he was the only thing she could count on since she could remember so losing him was an unbareable blow but the loss of Mika was much much worse. She was as close to Jash as she was the others. I believe that Nefertiti wasn't an orphan but didn't have a good relationship with her parents, which is why her and Derek lived together i believe. I'm gonna go back and check that now. ok, she has parents but for some reason or other (no one really knows) she hates them. When she was a kid she used to go to the orphanage all the time to play with Derek and the other kids. (says so in the other rp :P). i'm rambling on n such. lol. ANYWAYS. nefertiti's color i forget but she was likeableness or loveableness or something like that. so i just summed up my char... o.O lol, back to the rp!)<br>
<br>
A wobbling ring of grey smoke slowly lifted towards the ceiling before expanding and disappearing. A cigarette hung between Nefertiti's middle and pointer finger as she lay sprawled out in the tub. Slowly she brought the filter to her lips and sucked in the sweet taste of tobacco. Her arm flopped back down over the side of the bathtub and the beads dangling from the leather strap on her arm clicked against the side of the porcelin. If there was one thing Nefertiti still found peace in it was laying in an unfilled tub. Smoke poured from her mouth as she exhailed. One thing about her still hadn't changed - her woredrobe. Baggy black canvas pants and tight black tanktops. And always, always that same leather strap on her arm with two dangling strings that held 7 various shades of blue beads at the ends. The lengths of the strings were different by an inch or two. Knotted, wavey brown locks fell around her face matted and stringy. Though she didn't smell it had probably been two or more days since she had showered. The past four nights had been spent drowning her many sorrows in bottle after bottle and last night everyone had had a good drowning. Finding comfort in another puff she lays her head back and lets her mind blank out. There was nothing left to think about and all that was left to do was finish off the last of her camel red.<br>

Dirty and blood stained, he must be one of the homeless who often tried to enter the building for one reason or another.  At one point, he may have stopped to look with sympathy, or hand the man a buck or two, but not anymore.  Without a second glance, he walked by, that is, until he heard Carmen gasp.  It didn't seem right that he had somehow missed the cat ears and the tail, but for certain the body was that of Devon's.  Worry flashed through his mind like a streak of lightning.  &quot;We must get him inside.&quot;  With a glance, he could tell Carmen was loathe to touch him for fear of irritating his tender wounds, but if they did nothing, his situation would surely decline.  Grudgingly, she nodded.  She grabbed his legs, and he his uppper torso.  Gently, they lifted the man's frame made lithe from genetic alterations at birth.  As they carried him in, they both knew Nefer couldn't know.  Not know.  She couldn't see him like this.  The watery glitter in Carmen's eye told him that much.  &quot;We'll hide him in my room.&quot;  Again, she nodded.  Luckily, Nefer was in the bathroom as they slipped by, up the stairs to Jerron's room.  Laying the groaning body on the bed, Jerron didn't know what to do.  At one point, he would have called for an ambulance, or used his mentalities to try and heal his friend, but he knew engaging his own mind could only do more harm than good and an ambulance would draw to much attention on them.  The things he had stolen last he had left were of no small value.  Not knowing exactly what to do, he told Carmen he'd go get some clean cloths and warm water to clean his wounds.  God, why, why did the world have to keep closing in on him, why.<br>

&quot;What are you trying to tell us, Devin?&quot; She asked out loud, mainly to herself. Carmen figured Devin was too out of it to respond.<br>

Time ticked on as Carmen sat waiting on Jerron's return to help tend Devin, Neferiti would be out of the shower soon...

Now, just gonna do my whole thing to TRY and help you understand.  It's gonna be hard, the last rp had I think 12 pages...  If you don't think you should know the last story, then DON'T READ THIS.  Well, Derek(mindles) was an orphan, I think Mika(Paradise) was too.  Nefer had parents, but wasn't a fan of that whole thing, and became friends with those two.  Jash and Devin I'm unsure of, I know that Jash, Devin, Mika, Nefer, Jerron, and Derek were all friends of at a young age.  Derek was kinda the unspoken leader of us all, and one of the few people Jerron actually opened up to.  Derek was a dealer.  He sold drugs(crystals?), and was a casual user along with the rest (baring Jerron.)  Yaddayadda yada, they went to a club.  Derek met with a customer there, Carmen.  Carmen and Jash hook up and fly around the room, they both are hoverboarders.  Mika and Nefer have a heart to heart(as Nefer said...lesbianism? mebee, at the most, more than close friends.)  Jerron meets a girl, Lor(laurana.)  Somehow, I forget, their minds touch and they 'understand' eachother.  I don't know what I was thinking when I wrote it....Devin hooks up with his gal, a bounty hunter, Kali.  They see Shadow, Devin's old flame(Devins bi) and have a little spat.  A little bout erupts between everyone minus carmen, and the Keeters.  A group of weirdos with mentalists(people in control of the mind related abilities of the time ex. controlling simple machines created for such purpose, entering peoples minds, altering thoughts, stimulating parts of the brain, etc.) and brutes(really big muscly men.)  Jash, Derik, Nefer, Mika, and Devin, and maybe Kali escape in Derik's car, Jerron steals Shadows.  They go back.  lots of talk etc etc, keeter fights etc.  Then they need to kill shadow for some reason or another.  Jerron teleports everyone back to his house, minus Derek.  He enters Derek's mind where Derek kicks shadow's arse.  They see a sign, the octarine.  They leave, go back to Jerron's house.  Derek remembers the octarine.  Jerron-yellow, Carmen-blue money, Devin-purple sex, Nefer-green likability, Mika red fighting, Jash, I ferget, and Derek is the head of em all.  He's good at everything.  Jerron goes to see Lor and find her injured, takes her to the hospital.  She raves about someone named Sarah.  Oh, and Shadow is black, death.  With shadow dieing/dead, Derek is dying too.  Shadow dies, and Kali takes over as octarine of death.  Mika turns into a Lamia, sucks life force from people.  She kisses Jerron and hurts him alot.  Then she touches Nefer and nefer is fine, and Mika starts to feel better.  Jerron and Devin go to get some keeters to feed her energy.  They go back to find everyone gone.  They left a message, going to india or something.  Derek knows where 'sarah' is, and thats where it died, the rp that is.  Hope that helped to clear things up.  If you have the time, I'd suggest you go back and read it, but if you don't, don't worry.   <br>
Devin's injuries proved to be not much more serious than cosmetical.  While he had sustained hard blows to his body, the cuts were minimal, and what he needed most was rest.  Carmen had carefully blotted away the blood with rags, torn strips of an old t-shirt.  With clean rags, she bound his nude upper torso.  He looked so....fragile, innocent, lying there unconscious.  At least he's not gone, gone like the others.  Staring at his friend made him realize how pitiful life really was.  He no longer wanted to be near Dev, near this body who all of a sudden stood for all that had gone wrong in the last month.  &quot;Carmen....<br>
She turned to look at him, eyes so full of hope.  &quot;He's so beautiful there, isn't he.&quot;<br>
&quot;Um, I'm going to go check on Nefer, its been a while.  I think I'll go out, get some lunch for later.  I...I just need to clear my head.&quot;  Jerron didn't know what to do.  He used to be so sure of himself, always landing on his feet.  Only now, he was smack on his ass without anything to help him to his feet. <br>
&quot;I understand.&quot;  She nodded, knowing what it meant to not know what to do.  <br>
Muttering 'thanks', too quietly for her to hear, Jerron left his room.  Smoke was steadily rolling forth from the bathroom, slowly filling the bottom floor.  He knocked, but didn't wait for a reply as he turned the knob.  The sight was almost comical, but it wasn't enough for Jerron to laugh for the first time in the month.  His friend was spralled out in the empty tub with a cigarette hanging from her mouth, a glazed look on her face.  &quot;I'm going out hon, lunch.  Wouldja like to come with?&quot;        <br>

He was alive. HE was still with them, she wasn't going to lose another one. His state wasn't as bad as it looked, once they got the blood cleaned away, there were only a few scratches and bruises. Carmen wished that was how emotional wounds were... That they only looked bad, that they didn't FEEL so bad. <br>
<br>
&quot;Um, I'm going to go check on Nefer, its been a while. I think I'll go out, get some lunch for later. I...I just need to clear my head,&quot; Jerron piped up from behind her. His voice was kind of, lost. Hell, they all felt lost, even Carmen, the only thing that kept her going was knowing she had to protect what she had left. Neferiti, Jerron, Devin. She wanted to keep them right by her and never let them go. When Carmen met their little group, she knew that right there was where she wanted to be. Through thick. Through thin. Then, 3 of them... slipped away. Dead? Alive? They didn't know, but they knew they were gone. From the moment the realization of their absence hit, Carmen knew she wasn't going to let it happen to the others... no, no, no. In a way she felt like she was the 'mother goose' of her remaining friends, but someone had to be.<br>
<br>
Carmen brushed away all of the images and thoughts clouding her mind, slowly she began nodding, she knew how Jerron felt, &quot;I understand.&quot; Her violet eyes turned up to him, pleading he be careful.<br>
<br>
As he turned and left the room, Carmen thought she heard him say, 'Thanks,' but she wasn't too sure. Wincing as the door came to close, she hoped Jerron's little outting returned some clarity.<br>
<br>
Glancing back to Devin, she sighed. It was a beautiful sight to see her friend alright. Though he kept muttering now and then, he was probably talking in his sleep. <br>
<br>
Forcing herself up, she bent over and kissed his forehead, &quot;You'll be fine by tomorrow, Devin,&quot; she told him, even though he wasn't awake.<br>
<br>
Slowly, Carmen made her way out of the room. As her hand closed around the knob...<br>
<br>
&quot;Nefer...&quot;<br>
<br>
Carmen looked over her shoulder at Devin, 'He must be sleep talking,' she thought. <br>
<br>
Sighing, she left the room, and went to the kitchen. Still on the table was her legal pad and pen, &quot;Damn it,&quot; Carmen muttered. She hadn't heard activity from the front door yet, so Jerron had to have still been in the apartment. &quot;Jerron,&quot; she called out just enough to lace through the apartment. Maybe he wouldn't mind picking up these few things? <p><!--EZCODE CENTER START--><div style="text-align:center"><br>

That idea was sketchy. But Jerron, the sweetheart, had taken the time to come in here and ask. He probably wanted some company. Well, if he wanted her to go... she might as well. Wouldn't hurt nothin, right? Flicking her cigarette into the toilet, she listened for that tiny hiss as the cherry went out. She always liked hearing that. Pushing herself to her feet she took a step out of the tub and looked at Jerron. Always she had thought him to be the strongest out of all of them and greatly admired the power his mind once held... but as she stared deep into his eyes she saw he was fighting to keep his head above water just like the rest. His eyes held so little of what they once did... He was hurting. As much or even more than she was, only he hid it. He hid it so that no one else could see how bad it pained him to live like this. Tears stung behind her eye lids. She sucked in her breath, apparently she still had a few tears left in her... Before she had a chance to start sobbing she threw her arms around Jerron and held him close. Why did every second of every day have to be so agonizing? They stood there for a few minutes, unable and unwilling to let go. <br>
