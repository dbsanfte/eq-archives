Yet within the screams, those eternal sounds of pain and agony, there was a lull; one of the tortured souls was not screaming. Innoruuk tried daily to beat a scream out of this entity, yet he never elicited a sound.<br>
<br>
  Hatred was building in Innoruuk at that silence, so much hatred that he considered merely passing him over and letting a disciple deal with the uncooperative soul. The prospect merely built more of that self-guiding force, and he continued, though he was irked more and more by this one's silence.<br>
<br>
  Black hair and gold eyes. Innoruuk paused in his tortures to consider a few moments the import of that coloring. He thought again and again of the one who had spawned this soul into Norrath, who had disrespected and shunned Him. Not once, but twice! TWICE! Hatred was spiraling out of control in Innoruuk, whom enjoyed the pure, raw feeling. Even THIS one had shunned him, for something that wasn't even supernatural!<br>
<br>
  Again and again came the torture device, a flaming whip that tore through flesh and cauterized the wound instantly. Never once did he cry out, never once did he whimper! It was as if he were a blank creature! Over and over and over, through the flesh, across the back, legs, thighs, striking so hard that the corporeal spirit shook in it's bindings that held it face-down and forward.<br>
<br>
  Tyrai hung there like a limp doll. He felt the pain, but he was detached from it. It had been like this for an indeterminate amount of time - time didn't pass here like it did on Norrath, that was for sure. He never felt a sun, never heard a single joyous sound. The entirety of this realm seemed like a bleak, black hole. Like home.<br>
<br>
  However, something was happening. The slams of the burning whip were coming less and less often, as if Innoruuk couldn't bear the moment of silence striking him caused. But that couldn't be it - from all he had learned as a child about 'the great Innoruuk,' that didn't fit Him at all. Then he felt it.<br>
<br>
  A momentary presence, a brushing across his mind. Images of an elfin woman, shrouded in gray and black. He tilted his head to the side, the only movement he had made in who knew how long? And it showed - bones in his neck cracked with the movement, creating a reverberating sound that was lost in the ensuing screams from the other unfortunates caught in Innoruuk's traps.<br>
<br>
  Innoruuk didn't miss the import of this; he'd moved, he wasn't a blank creature, he wasn't mindless! Two whips now came at Tyrai, two flaming lengths that tore into his skin, ripped into his flesh with increasing intensity. The pain should have been unbearable!<br>
<br>
  Tyrai ignored the pain. It was easy, actually. His body always felt below average temperature. It had since he had come here. He figured it was merely a consequence of being dead. Ach! There it was again! That brush of a supernatural mind, calling to him, speaking his name with a soundless voice.<br>
<br>
  &quot;Tyrai..&quot;<br>
  &quot;Tyrai..&quot;<br>
<br>
  Tyrai didn't answer, for with each syllable of his name came the flash of an image of life. His father, Bluwen. The few people had had called friends. None of it seemed to affect him, except to draw up painful memories, and the faint shroud of hatred he had felt at Bluwen for how he treated his mother, how weak the Teir'Dal had been. Wizardry, pah! Nothing could stand up to a pair of well-placed blades.<br>
<br>
  Blades?<br>
<br>
  Tyrai saw the flashes of him as a youth, dagger and blade working in perfect harmony, perfection in form. Orcs, mermaids..gnolls, goblins, skeletons..he saw his strikes, perfectly placed against his opponents.<br>
<br>
  &quot;Bladedancer..&quot;<br>
<br>
  That damned voice came again. Though the word brought a flash in his mind of Sarhea, his 'Aunt.' Cousin, not sister, but he'd taken great delight in calling her Auntie. Perhaps it was merely a child's game that he had played with himself, to entertain himself. He'd been alone almost all the time of his short life, except for those few moments his mother could spare to be with him.<br>
<br>
  &quot;Tyrai..&quot;<br>
  &quot;Tyrai..&quot;<br>
<br>
  Definitely a female voice. Tyrai's conciousness was being drawn slowly from it's slumber, the brain-dead feeling of having resigned himself to his eternal fate. The images were waking him up. And still the pain was nothing. He kept thinking, recalling his past, images flickering through his mind one after another after another. Ephelba, the League, House Yigsawla..all of it moved in his mind, coming to the front. Confronting the images he had locked away, silently, and confirming them. He had lived a life before this. This wasn't all there was to the worlds.<br>
<br>
  Innoruuk sensed the awakening of Tyrai's mind, his torture ceasing for a few more moments. He probed at the Teir'Dal's mind, only to find that his progress was impeded. His mind was surrounded at first by a cloud of shadows, something Innoruuk easily brushed aside. But beneath that, a swirling mass of chaos, equal in strength to Innoruuk's mighty Hatred. Who dared interfered with his sacrifice?!<br>
<br>
  A presence behind Innoruuk alerted him - but how had they gotten past his sentinels? Innoruuk faced the presence behind Him, and immediately understood. Fizzlethorpe.<br>
<br>
  &quot;Bristlebane. Why are you here?&quot; Innoruuk's voice was calm, yet cold, a simmering forefront to the hatred bubbling within the cauldron.<br>
<br>
  Fizzlethorpe Bristlebane, the King of Thieves, bowed low to the Prince of Hate, almost mocking in his genuflection. A twinkle of mischief floated through his eyes as he rose back up, grinning impertinently at Innoruuk.<br>
<br>
  &quot;Why, to pay respects to the Almighty King of Hate, of course, dear Innoruuk. I was in the neighborhood and thought I'd drop by to do that.&quot;<br>
<br>
  Innoruuk scowled at Bristlebane. &quot;Mischief is nowhere close to here and you were in the 'neighborhood'? Why do I find that difficult to believe, Fizzlethorpe?&quot;<br>
<br>
  &quot;Ah, you're just an untrusting soul, that's all, Inny my dear!&quot; Fizzlethorpe laughed, then, knowing how much the great God of Hate despised being referred to affectionately as 'Inny.'<br>
<br>
  All the while this banter was going on, the touch of that other being's presence continued to linger in Tyrai's mind, drawing out images of his past. Friends, family, the League, Yigsawla..and finally came the images of his mother. Tyrai almost cried out at the painful memories, some of them not his own, but his mother's. The dank cave behind the waterfall in the Commons where he was born, the human with her..<br>
<br>
  &quot;Demaste..&quot; he breathed the name quietly, animosity flickering through his mind. He had disliked the human, yes, but only because he took his mother away for so long. And like it was so much dust within the wind, the animosity was blown away, snuffed like a candle flame. More images of his mother, so powerful, beautiful. He breathed in the images, remembering why he had at first longed to return to life.<br>
<br>
  &quot;It's been almost thirty years since you've roamed Norrath, Bladedancer..&quot; came the quiet voice. &quot;They have been wed for more than half a century, and she thrives in my service. She has been Mine since the day she was born. But you..you escaped my notice..how unfortunate.&quot; A light laughter like the peal of silvery bells danced through his mind, more images floating through his head.<br>
<br>
  Bluwen. His father, the wizard. How he had hated that Wizard, how he doted on his mother, how possessive he had been! Tyrai's possessiveness had been born purely of that example, that and a child's need for affection, no matter how small the affection was.<br>
<br>
  &quot;He is dead, Bladedancer. As far as any, God or Mortal, can know.&quot;<br>
<br>
  Elation spread through Tyrai at the news, a faint smile curling his crimson-stained, deep blue lips. Just then he noticed how parched his throat was, how dry his mouth. The voice had breathed life back into him, had protected him from the pain. He knew it, the flash of images in his head confirming it.<br>
<br>
  Who are you? His thoughts were jumbled, still a mess with the menagerie of images.<br>
<br>
  &quot;I am your Goddess,&quot; came the response. A flash of darkness surrounded Tyrai all at once, spreading across his body, soothing him. He felt his body becoming intangible, passing through the links as if they weren't there. And he felt something beneath him taking his place, and almost laughed at the absurdity of it, the absurdity of the alliance.<br>
<br>
  A Souldoll. It was perfect, he realized, as the second presence entered his mind. After all, Bristlebane had created a copy of Cazic-Thule, and even of Innoruuk, copies that had fooled other Gods. Why not make a copy of a mortal to fool a God? The shadows engulfed him silently, and he knew he was gone from that place, that horrible place he had lingered in for thirty mortal years. And now what? Now what did this Goddess have in store for him? Whatever it was was better than what Innoruuk had for him for an eternity..it had to be.. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub95.ezboard.com/bharvestersofdarkness.showUserPublicProfile?gid=tyrai>Tyrai</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Member</span><br> <font color=#A8A8A8>(10/4/03 2:44 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub95.ezboard.com/fharvestersofdarknessfrm8.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=134.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Secrets in Hate and Shadows, part deux.</span><hr size=1> Darkness was all Tyrai knew as conciousness came to him. Shadows upon shadows clouded his vision, and for a brief moment he forgot where he was. A stab of fear shot through him, as he wondered what Innoruuk had for him now. Then he remembered, and his head slipped to his skull as a wave of dizziness slid over him.<br>
<br>
&quot;Ugh..&quot; came the uneloquent sound, that so very succinctly summed up everything inside of him. Or perhaps blargh would have done better. Difficult to say, really.<br>
<br>
&quot;Good wakening, Tyrai,&quot; came the soft voice, only it was no longer in his head. It was real, it was truly, honestly real. And very close. And from the heat on his eyes, he knew that he wasn't in darkness. But why couldn't he see?<br>
<br>
&quot;I can't..&quot; he coughed then, his voice a gravelly sounding thing. Having not used it for thirty years had it's drawbacks. Loudly, he cleared his throat, then felt a waterskin pressed against his lips. Hands came up, but only came up so far, as he felt manacles upon his hands, chains that led to the floor. A soothing touch on his wrist calmed the panic that welled in him.<br>
<br>
&quot;A necessary precaution, Bladedancer. I wouldn't want you hurting yourself before you could meet your mother again.&quot; Meet his mother! Tyrai's mind became a jumbled tumult of emotion at that prospect. Seeing his mother again! But the supernatural presence touched his cheek with the back of her hand, soothing him silently.<br>
<br>
&quot;Tilt your head back, Bladedancer, defier of Hate, and drink.&quot; Tyrai did as he was told, head tilting back so that the waterskin's spout slipped more easily between his lips, water, glorious water spreading into his dry mouth, going down his parched throat. The water was delicious to him, starved for moisture as he was, and he drank and drank and drank, the waterskin never going dry.<br>
<br>
Finally, sated, he tilted his head away from the waterskin, wettening his lips with a moistened tongue, thinking of how glorious it felt. Years of crud upon his lips disappated in the swipe of his tongue, roughness vanishing from his lips, his teeth grabbing at a particularly tough spot, peeling it off his lower lip. Another swipe and his lips, blackened by grime, became a deep blue again, like the rest of his skin. But still, he could not see.<br>
<br>
&quot;Goddess..why am I blind?&quot; the voice came out like a strangled whisper. His eyesight had been the one thing he had always possessed that he was proud of, with intensely perfect vision, more like a hawk's than an elf's.<br>
<br>
Again, that incredibly light laughter filled his ears, and he felt a moist cloth against his cheek. &quot;You are not blind, Bladedancer. You merely have yet to open your eyes.&quot; And then the cloth moved over his right eye, pressing down against years of build-up, years of grime that had collected over his semi-permanantly closed eyes. Then it drew down, dragging it all off, and he felt as if a leaden weight had been drawn off his eyelid. And quickly, the cloth did the same to the other eye, perhaps a bit too quickly.<br>
<br>
&quot;Ow!&quot; he winced as the still-dry grime slid off of his eyelid. A pair of phantasmal lips pressed to the spot, and he almost laughed at the absurdity of it. Almost, for the spot instantly felt better. And he had a sinking feeling about who the Goddess might be, with such mothering instincts.<br>
<br>
&quot;No, Bladedancer, I'm not Tunare.&quot; The laughter filled his ears again. &quot;You can open your eyes now.&quot;<br>
<br>
Tyrai opened his eyes, slowly, silently. The room was dim, though still seemed bright to his eyes, but not as impossibly bright as a room on Norrath might have been. Eyes adjusted quickly, quietly to the light, though his gaze was blurry. He went to lift his hands, and realized the manacles that had chained him to the floor were gone. Childishly, he rubbed his eyes until the blurriness disappated, and looked for the first time onto the Goddess that had rescued him.<br>
<br>
First thing he noticed were the ears. So she was an elf, or at least assumed that form for some reason. Already, his heart began to sink, but as he looked over her he began to recognize certain things. The pupiless eyes, the onyx skin. The curl of her sidelocks down to her stomach. He took a deep breath, and the image was projected into his mind.<br>
<br>
&quot;Luclin,&quot; he whispered. That drew a nod from the Goddess, Her legs curled beneath her, seated in front of him. More images slid into his mind, as a stray thought wondered about the comment on his mother. Then he saw it, his mother's naming ceremony. The Dark Elves, the Teir'Dal, gathered to witness the calling of Innoruuk.<br>
<br>
He saw how Luclin switched the devices used to summon Innoruuk with identical ritual items that were used to conjure her presence. He saw how, seated within a corner of the ceiling, inside a deep shadow, Luclin projected her voice, mimicing that of Innoruuk. And he heard the thunderous voice echoing in his ears.<br>
<br>
&quot;THIS CHILD IS MINE.&quot; He smiled softly, watching the scene unfold in his mind, a part of his mother's history before his time. And he tucked that memory silently away as it ended, satisfied. He looked up to Luclin, tilting his head to the side.<br>
<br>
&quot;Your interest in me...what?&quot; His voice still felt raw, though his throat was no longer in pain.<br>
<br>
Luclin merely smiled at him, then quietly answered. &quot;You should have been mine, too, Bladedancer. But the Blood kept me from taking you for my own.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;The Blood..&quot; he whispered, his eyes widening in realization. It had given him some power, yes, but as he had chosen the path of the Indigo, he had no way to release it. His mother had called constantly on it for her clerical powers. But..was it gone? Or was it still a part of him?<br>
<br>
&quot;It still lingers in you, Bladedancer. And it closes the path of the Brotherhood to you, for the Blood caused your death last time.&quot; Luclin's face seemed almost sorrowed as she spoke, a look of perfection that brought a pain to Tyrai's heart.<br>
<br>
&quot;Yes..I remember..&quot; his voice feeling better with each word. &quot;It whispered to me that mother despised me, that I reminded her too much of Bluwen, too many angry memories..&quot; his voice faltering, eyes becoming downcast. How had he believed it? Mother had been so distant, perhaps that had been the cause of it.<br>
<br>
Luclin merely nodded at his words, showing no indication that she knew his thoughts this time. &quot;But the Blood is weakened in you, Tyrai. Your death made it lose it's grip upon you, and it has taken me thirty mortal years to rouse the help I required to snatch you from Innoruuk.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Bristlebane,&quot; he said with a slight grin. &quot;Very perfect, by the way. Give him my congratulations on a perfectly contrived plan.&quot;<br>
<br>
Luclin was taken aback by the sudden flood of words, and of their intent. Then she laughed, peal after peal of that tinkling laughter. She took quite some time composing herself.<br>
<br>
&quot;Yes, yes..I will tell Fizzlethorpe how grateful you are for his assistance. I wouldn't have wanted to go in there alone.&quot; Then Luclin smiled, and patted Tyrai's cheek. &quot;I will return you to your mother soon. But we have to find you a body to inhabit first.&quot;<br>
<br>
Tyrai nodded quietly. &quot;As you will it, Goddess.&quot; Then he grinned, which brought laughter from Luclin.<br>
<br>
&quot;Oh, you're going to be impossible, Bladedancer,&quot; she said, before laying a hand over his eyes. &quot;Sleep, for now. I will watch over you.&quot;<br>
<br>
The words had an unspoken command, and Tyrai gently slid through the air onto his back again, asleep before he hit the ground.<br>
<br>
&quot;I will watch over you forever, wayward Bladedancer,&quot; came Luclin's voice, triumph in her eyes. Now all she had to do was steal her priestess' daughter, as well!<br>

The room still was darkened, unnatural (perhaps, natural here?) shadows cloaked the lights that burned along the walls. Up he went, sitting now, and a hand pressed to his head to stop the dizziness. Oh, sweet Gods, but the dizziness felt good. Thirty years of hanging prone with almost no sensations had made every experience all the more rich.<br>
<br>
  &quot;Makes me wonder how laughter would feel,&quot; he murmured, a grin spreading across his deep blue lips. His body felt somewhat weak, though he had retained most of the hardiness he'd had in life. All that Brotherhood training, becoming better than the Dreadguard, had paid off. Tyrai moved up onto his feet silently, walking over to a large bay window in the wall directly across from where he'd been sleeping.<br>
<br>
  Beyond the low light of the room, he saw..nothing. That is to say, he saw the Demi-Plane of Shadows, the only tangible thing within it the building he was in. Below he saw nothing but gentle darkness that swayed with a silent rythym within the plane. Nothing could be more perfect, this silence, this serenity. A smile curled his lips, as he looked silently away from the window.<br>
<br>
  &quot;Yes, it is peaceful here.&quot; Luclin had returned, gazing quietly at the Teir'Dal. &quot;But you have to leave soon, my new disciple.&quot;<br>
<br>
  &quot;Why?&quot; Tyrai asked, though he felt shame at asking the question. He knew he couldn't stay here an eternity - he had yet to live his mortal life out. Luclin merely nodded at him, then gestured silently at the window.<br>
<br>
  Tyrai turned, and the window formed, shaping silently into a portal of unimaginable darkness. A pulsing light appeared in the center of the portal, flowing silently outwards. The portal turned swiftly into a viewing glass, and he saw, through it, the image of a young Teir'Dal, a bit older than he had been when he had died.<br>
<br>
  &quot;I have chosen a mortal form for you, Tyrai.&quot; Luclin was at his side, her voice at his ear. He studied the figure through the portal, watching him talk, move, cast. He saw the Necromantic spells, and a light flickered in his eyes, a grin on his lips. Something in the magic appealed to him. Perhaps it was Luclin's gentle insistence upon his mind, but more than not, it was the way everything seemed so very effective, deadly so.<br>
<br>
  &quot;I will go then, my Lady of Shadows,&quot; Tyrai spoke, his voice flowing easily now, the timbre of adulthood replacing the squeaks of youth. He turned to look at Luclin, knowing that most mortals never got to see their worship face to face. He was fortunate, yes, but he knew the real value of this. The Mistress of Shadows merely nodded, gesturing silently towards the portal, which swirled back into a seamless void.<br>
<br>
  &quot;Wait until I tell you, then enter the portal. Force the other soul out and take the body for your own. I do not know what will happen after that, Bladedancer, but this is how you will enter back into life.&quot; Luclin grinned softly at his confused expression, touching his cheek. &quot;I know you will be able to do this. You are stronger than he, by far.&quot; Tyrai nodded, then looked to the portal, and waited..<br>
<br>
  Kineu Do'Umbra, a young Necromancer in his late teens, moved swiftly through the halls of Neriak. He was a devout of Innoruuk, a Dark Priest of the Dead, and used his Hatred to fuel his magics. And he was good, perhaps one of the strongest upcoming Necromancers in all of Neriak.<br>
<br>
  But today, he wasn't thinking that. He was wandering the dark recesses of Neriak, the hidden tunnels behind the fall. An alluring voice had drawn him here, promising him power, a seat at Innoruuk's side. Yet he found nothing here, but kept looking. And as he reached the end, he heard the voice again, turning him around.<br>
<br>
  What he saw was a Royal Teir'Dal, or at least that is what she seemed like. Her skin was as dark as the night, without the faintest touch of blue to it, and her eyes pupiless. Almost immediately he was taken with the strange beauty. She spoke without words to him, the promises from before silently filling his mind. He didn't notice the soul approaching him until it was too late.<br>
<br>
  Kineu Do'Umbra was in pain. His back arched as he felt something enter him, something supernatural. He fought with his body and mind, attacking the soul that was entering his body with a savage possessiveness. He twisted, turned, and screamed, calling forth Innoruuk's name, trying to save himself from the darkness that descended upon him, shrouding him in shadows.<br>
<br>
  All at once, however, the battle was ended. Kineu Do'Umbra's soul was dismissed from the body he had possessed, and Tyrai had entered it. The young Necromancer was gone, returned to the Cauldron, and in his place was Tyrai.<br>
<br>
  &quot;The body is yours, Bladedancer,&quot; whispered Luclin. And then she noticed the pain etched into Tyrai's face.<br>
<br>
  As Tyrai had entered the body, so had the Blood that possessed his spirit. And the Blood did not like this body's shape, or form. Muscles rippled through the deep blue skin, restoring what had been the shape of Tyrai's body, the Warrior, before he had died. Slim muscles that relied more on speed and grace than sheer force. Also, the stark white hair that had been the Necromancer's pride was suddenly darkened to black, growing from the short-cropped end down to his shoulders. Eyes of pearlescent blue were suddenly gold, luminous and glowing as the Blood forced it's way through the body, forcing these changes.<br>
<br>
  Through it all, Tyrai bore the pain with the silent stoicism he had taken Innoruuk's beatings with. And when it was finished, he silently looked down upon his leather-clad body, a grin spreading across his lips. He looked to Luclin, and nodded at her.<br>
<br>
  &quot;Now I shall find Kerridwynn D'Veldrin, and inquire of my mother's whereabouts.&quot; Luclin looked slightly surprised at the change in Tyrai, but she didn't say anything about it. Instead, she spoke merely of his future.<br>
<br>
  &quot;She is Kerridwynn Spellbender now, and strife rules her house for the time being. Wait some time before making yourself known to your mother and her husband, and their daughter.&quot;<br>
<br>
  It was Tyrai's turn to look surprised, as she spoke that final word. &quot;I have..a sister?&quot; he whispered, blinking once, twice, three times. Then he smiled, and nodded. &quot;It is as it should be, then. What is her name, Mistress?&quot; He looked imploringly at the Goddess, whom indulged him.<br>
<br>
  &quot;Kyimera Spellbender, a Knight of Darkness.&quot; Tyrai nodded silently, taking this all in. And then, suddenly, he realized he wasn't breathing, and his lungs were screaming for air. He took a breath, and a hand slid to his head, suddenly dizzy with the sensation of breathing again. Everything was so crisp and clear to his newly restored senses! And his vision, oh, what a delight it was to see things unclouded by Planesight, that accursed shadowing that had blurred his vision for thirty years. And the youth of this form, oh! He wagered that, despite the difference in years, the youth had brought him somewhere to an age around twenty-five years.<br>
<br>
  And the magic that flowed in him, the power he had stolen from it's rightful owner; that was his too, this necromantic strength. He laughed softly, looking around the dank caves, then back to Luclin, nodding towards her. &quot;It shall be as you say, Mistress, but I will look in on my mother.&quot; Luclin merely nodded, then began to fade away, back into her home plane.<br>
<br>
  &quot;Be well, my new Disciple, my..Bonedancer.&quot; Luclin laughed, that silvery peal echoing across the cave walls as she faded away, silently leaving Tyrai to himself and his new strength. Tyrai looked down at his hands, and smiled softly.<br>
<br>
  &quot;Alive..&quot; he breathed, then quickly rushed from the caves, to explore.. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub95.ezboard.com/bharvestersofdarkness.showUserPublicProfile?gid=tyrai>Tyrai</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Member</span><br> <font color=#A8A8A8>(10/6/03 7:10 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub95.ezboard.com/fharvestersofdarknessfrm8.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=134.topic&index=3>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Secrets in Hate and Shadows, part quatre.</span><hr size=1> Tyrai quietly looked at his reflection in the still pool of the chamber deep beneath Neriak, regarding the sight that stared back at him. His golden eyes seemed more sinister due to the smattering of crimson stain across his eyelids, barely tinging his dark blue skin, creating a mere highlight across his face.<br>
<br>
His lips, too, were changed, black paint across them, staining them to a deep onyx. His lips pressed together for a brief instant, before his tongue slipped out to moisten his lips. The paint creased down into the folds of his lips, the smooth, polished onyx look vanishing.<br>
<br>
Down his gaze went, to his hands, a sanguine coloring across his trimmed fingernails, standing out against his skin. And, too, he considered the leathers he wore, thinking them quite fitting.<br>
<br>
&quot;Deep shadows and brilliant highlights..could the Goddess be any better represented?&quot; Even his voice seemed like a silken shadow, matured from the squeak of his teens to a melodic, almost hypnotic deep roll. He couldn't even recognize himself in the reflection.<br>
<br>
&quot;What does Mother see now in her reflection, though, I wonder..&quot; he whispered to himself, thinking how he had seen her in Nektulos. The silver lines down her cheeks, molten silver cooled in wounds. From the brief touches on her mind, he knew what they represented, why she had done it.<br>
<br>
&quot;Soon I'll understand nothing of her,&quot; he said with a chuckle. &quot;Twentieth circle comes soon, and this glorious, stolen power from the Goddess will fade. Her protection will end.&quot; He had so many things to consider upon reaching the twentieth circle, but there was one thing that he did not need to consider. How he would present himself to his mother, there in the Harvester's Hall. Nothing dramatic, mere simplicity.<br>
<br>
Tyrai looked quietly to the glowing skull he had taken from a skeleton's body, and thought again of the brittle iksar skull sitting on his mother's mantle. He spoke quietly, reaching out to run his fingers over the skull's smooth brow.<br>
<br>
&quot;This will outdo the skull my sister gave to her. Or perhaps it will merely equal, or pale in comparison to my return.&quot; His melodic voice was musing, seeming to lull himself into a trance, falling into himself to think.<br>
<br>
He had made contact with his half-sister, Kyimera, tonight. She was strong already, stronger than he was with his current experience. But he wondered, silently, how her skill with the blade she carried would have matched his speed with his dagger and blade. Then, he laughed.<br>
<br>
&quot;I haven't even met her and already I'm competing.&quot; His fingers continued to stroke the glowing iksar skull's brow, pondering. Was he still possessive of her? He didn't know. He'd have to meet her full on before he could decide. How quickly the jealousy would rise the moment she turned to someone else. Again, a laugh slipped from between those painted black lips, and he shook his head.<br>
<br>
&quot;That got me dead in the first place and in that horrid plane..&quot; he whispered. And then, he wondered, how many of his mother's family worshipped the Father, and how many would be offended by his escape from His clutches. Perhaps he should show himself before his twentieth season, so that Luclin could shield him..<br>
<br>
&quot;No!&quot; The word shot from his lips like an arrow, an arrow that curved and bit into him, piercing him to his soul. &quot;I was never a coward, never ashamed of what I was, who I was. Why begin now?&quot; The words came freely, as if from outside himself, but he wholeheartedly agreed with them. It would wait until his twentieth circle, the twentieth blade, the twentieth shadow.<br>
<br>
A bone chip came into his hand, and then another. Turning, he spread the chips of bone in his hand, his digits working as gracefully as a rogue's on a lockpick, rolling the chips over his finger, in between each finger. They met in the middle, 'twixt the second and third finger, then continued past each other. And the direction reversed as they reached the next space, bringing them back together between his fingers.<br>
<br>
Down went the bonechips then, shadows coalescing about them. Shades rising in response to his call, forming the bones of a spindly creature, rising from the dispersing chips of bone. A shadowed skeleton stood before him, intelligence in it's green glowing eyes that pulsed with his magic, only faintly necromantic in nature.<br>
<br>
&quot;They call the Necromancers of Queen Crysthanos Thex 'Bonedancers.' It would be rude of me to take their name, would it not?&quot; Already, his mind was twisting about the idea, engulfing it with enthusiasm. He had never intended to use that title for himself; any others seemed ridiculous, but for one.<br>
<br>
The shadowed skeleton moved to him, laying it's hand on his shoulder. Tyrai looked up and grinned, seeing the reflection of Luclin within the pulsating eyes, nodding at the unspoken approval.<br>
<br>
&quot;Shadowdancer, then,&quot; he murmured, a surge of elation passing through him as he spoke the name. Whether it was his, or Luclin's, or both, he was not sure. But he knew that She was pleased by the title he took. He racked his brain silently, trying to remember enough of the language his mother had spoken with great fervor when he'd been young to construct a proper title from it.<br>
<br>
&quot;D'Veldrin was her surname, and would have been mine, eventually,&quot; he said quietly. &quot;Of Shadows. It seems appropriate, yet inappropriate.&quot; Why bother with that language, that horrible language all spoke? <br>
<br>
&quot;Later, after I meet Mother. I will decide then.&quot; He nodded to himself, and checked his makeup one more time in the reflection of the pool. He was going to visit the Necropolis, despite it having been ravaged, and he was going to listen in shadows. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub95.ezboard.com/bharvestersofdarkness.showUserPublicProfile?gid=tyrai>Tyrai</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Member</span><br> <font color=#A8A8A8>(10/6/03 9:16 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub95.ezboard.com/fharvestersofdarknessfrm8.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=134.topic&index=4>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Secrets in Hate and Shadows, part finir.</span><hr size=1> Tyrai flicked his hand smoothly towards the recondite, luring it towards him with a blast of shadows that entangled it's legs, curling about it's body and began to eat away at the skin. In short order, the regular heartbeat was irregulated, and the temperature of it's body rose several degrees, due to the blood that began to simmer in the veins.<br>
<br>
The power of these spells was undeniable. And he was only a few seasons into it! A blast of necromantic magic ripped life from the recondite as it swung at Tyrai, instantly healing the wound that the fist had caused without so much as a bruise. The shadowed skeleton that accompanied him suddenly flew into action, the shade releasing a torrent of blows upon the recondite, pulsating green eyes gleaming with madness.<br>
<br>
Tyrai stood there, deflecting blows with his short-handled scythe, occasionally raising the Writ in his other hand to fend off a quickened blow. His muscles were sluggish, however, not fully recovered from returning to life, and blows got through his defense.<br>
<br>
A final blast of Necromantic magic ended the pain, however, rending the life from the recondite and restoring Tyrai's skin to an unmarred state.<br>
<br>
Suddenly, he felt the shadows about him buckling. The defense that Luclin had given him was failing, that defense that had rendered him nigh a demi-god. Now the twentieth circle had descended upon him, and Luclin was taking the strength back.<br>
<br>
Tyrai exhaled slowly as the shadows pulled away from him, feeling suddenly..alive. He was completely tangible now, fully into the material plane. No longer could he shadow his mother or the Harvesters. He had to rely solely upon his own power now.<br>
<br>
&quot;Good,&quot; he murmured, as the thought slipped through his mind. &quot;I never was much one who needed assistance. Thank you, nontheless, Goddess.&quot; He was talking, of course, to Luclin, whom he knew could hear him, his every thought, if she listened.<br>
<br>
Tyrai tested the weight of the scythe now that his muscles weren't filled by the shadow's power. It still weighed almost nothing, and his skill was undiminished. So that had been him, it seemed. His old training was coming back to him. He knew that one power still remained, though. The ability to disperse his corporeal form to the shadows. But without Luclin's assistance, it would take him a good deal of time to regather it into a physical presence.<br>
<br>
Lifting his hand quietly, Tyrai called for the shadows, which surrounded him. A simple step led into them, and he slid from normal view, the skeleton tearing itself apart from panic. He ran, now, away from Paludal, towards Shadow Haven..the Hall awaited.. <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top"> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub95.ezboard.com/fharvestersofdarknessfrm8.showPrevMessage?topicID=134.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub95.ezboard.com/fharvestersofdarknessfrm8.showNextMessage?topicID=134.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a self href=http://pub95.ezboard.com/fharvestersofdarknessfrm8.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=134.topic&index=4><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/space/addReply.gif border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub95.ezboard.com/fharvestersofdarknessfrm8.emailToFriend?topicID=134.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub95.ezboard.com/fharvestersofdarknessfrm8.threadControl?topicID=134.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/space/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands</a><br> <a href=http://pub95.ezboard.com/fharvestersofdarknessfrm8.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=134.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/ultimate/subscribe.gif width=20 height=20 border=0 alt="Click to receive email notification of replies"> Click to receive email notification of replies</a> <br>  <a href=http://pub95.ezboard.com/fharvestersofdarknessfrm8.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=134.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/ultimate/unsubscribe.gif width=20 height=20 border=0 alt="Click to stop receiving email notification of replies"> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies</a> <br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub95.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="harvestersofdarknessfrm1">Announcements<option value="harvestersofdarknessfrm11">Recruitment<option value="harvestersofdarknessfrm8">Public Roleplay area<option value="harvestersofdarknessfrm7">OOC area<option value="harvestersofdarknessfrm16">The Twilight Harvest<option value="harvestersofdarknessfrm9">Members forum<option value="harvestersofdarknessfrm10">HoD Events<option value="harvestersofdarknessfrm12">HoD Vault<option value="harvestersofdarknessfrm15">Harvester Histories<option value="harvestersofdarknessfrm13">IC Officer's Forum<option value="harvestersofdarknessfrm14">OOC Officer's Forum<option value="harvestersofdarknessfrm17">closet</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#A8A8A8>- </font><a href=http://pub95.ezboard.com/bharvestersofdarkness>Harvesters of Darkness</a><font color=#A8A8A8> - </font><a href=http://pub95.ezboard.com/fharvestersofdarknessfrm8>Public Roleplay area</a> <font color=#A8A8A8> - </font><br><br><table border=0 align=center><tr><td align=center><a href="http://login.ezboard.com/BBSSystem.showUserPaymentScreen" target="_blank">Upgrade your account to ezSupporter...</a></td><td><img src="http://www.ezboard.com/image/spacer.gif" width=15 height=1 border=0></td><td align=center><a href="http://login.ezboard.com/BBSSystem.showUserPaymentScreen" target="_blank">...and never see another ad or pop-up again</a></td></tr></table><CENTER><!-- START BOTTOM AD SCRIPT -->
