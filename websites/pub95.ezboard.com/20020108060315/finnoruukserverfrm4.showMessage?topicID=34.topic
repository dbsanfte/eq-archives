This draft contains several important clauses that allow for the more orderly updating, and maintenance of the summit, as the current summit has problems in this area.  I am posting it here for discussion purposes. I believe it would have the flexibility to change with the times should we need it to. This, like the US constitution, should be considered a living document, one that can grow and change to fit the needs of those that live under it.<br>
<br>
Summit III Proposal.<br>
<br>
Booked Events (Updated) :<br>
<br>
1.       Scope: These rules cover POH and POF only. Dragons, static spawns, and POS are not covered by these rules.<br>
<br>
2.        Location: Innoruuk.com will be the calendar used for all bookings.<br>
<br>
3.        Maintenance: Only 2 people per guild will be allowed to schedule events, see your Guild-Leader for confirmation on who these people will be.<br>
<br>
4.        Eligibility: In order to book a date, a guild should have at least 18 planes capable people on its roster.  If a Guild does not have sufficient force, it may book a event with one or more partner guilds, providing the total of all guilds on the booking exceeds the 18 count.<br>
<br>
4.1.        If the guild(s) on the booking no longer have sufficient membership to reach this level the raid must be canceled and removed from the calendar.<br>
<br>
5.        Booking: Each guild will be allowed 1 booking at a time in each of the planes. Each booking will be for a 24 hour period starting and ending at 4:00 AM, Pacific Time, Adjusted for daylight savings as appropriate, IE. EQ Server Time. (The reason for this standardizing of start and end time is to eliminate the &quot;no man in zone&quot; period that was commonly used to poach in. <br>
<br>
5.1.         Exit Time: At end of this time (4 am Pacific), your guild(s) must be out of zone completely, regardless of CR efforts. Although it is encouraged to help others with CR when practical. The next scheduled guild has rights to allow or refuse CR efforts cutting into their schedule.  <br>
<br>
5.2.         Early Entry: Upon deciding to leave the plane, the current guild may allow the guild that is next scheduled, to enter the plane early. The guild with the current booking is not required to allow this early entry, in case they wish to return to the plane at a later point still within their allotted time slot. (This early entry is allowed for the purpose of protecting the planes from those who would take advantage of an empty plane and poach it). In this instance all those from the first booking guild must leave the zone, or they will count as guests on the next Guilds Raid.<br>
<br>
6.        Guests: On a raid, guilds may be accompanied by up to six (6) guests. <br>
<br>
6.1.        The guest list may change during the course of the day provided it does not exceed the 6 person limit at any time. <br>
<br>
7.        Attendance: The booking Guild(s) must at some point during the day of the raid, have twelve (12) members in the plane simultaneously. This is to prevent guilds that would otherwise be unable to muster sufficient force from booking the planes.<br>
<br>
8.        Verifiability: In order to facilitate verification of the guilds that comply with the summit, all persons in the Plane in question must not use /anon or /role, for the duration of the event. <br>
<br>
9.        Canceled Raids/Empty Slots:  In the event a raid is canceled All guilds at less than their current max booking that are interested in the slot, will send a representative to meet at 8:00 PM, Pacific Time, at the Dreadlands druid ring and random for the slot.  <br>
<br>
9.1.        This will occur at least twenty-four hours after a raid has been canceled. (at the fist 8:PM at least 24 hours after the cancellation was posted on innoruuk.com This 24 hour minimum is to prevent raids from being scheduled with the intent of canceling them and letting another guild book immediately after the cancellation.<br>
<br>
9.2.        In the event no guilds show for the slot, the random is postponed for the next day. <br>
<br>
9.3.        In the event there is insufficient time or no guild has claimed the cancellation before the raid is scheduled, it becomes a &quot;Public Raid&quot; (see below). <br>
<br>
10.         Public Raids: Innoruuk.com staff is responsible for maintaining on the schedule, at a time deemed appropriate, from 1 to 3 public raids (One weekday and one weekend slot ) for each of the planes. These slots are not to be on consecutive days. The number of public raids will be determined by the innoruuk.com staff, and be based on the number of interested persons. No Person may be included in more than one concurrently booked public raid, in each of the planes.<br>
<br>
10.1.        Only persons not in a guild, or not in a guild that books planes raids are eligible to attend.<br>
<br>
10.2.        All item drops on these raids (Including epics) will be random among all classes that can use the item that are present when it drops. <br>
<br>
10.3.        These raids will be lead by an innoruuk.com staff member, or a volunteer appointed by the innoruuk.com staff for this purpose. This leader will be responsible for forming groups, and making decisions about the raid.<br>
<br>
10.4.        All &quot;sell&quot; items will be kept by the organizer, and sold to cover the cost of the stones and peridots used for the raid. Excess funds will be distributed among the participants at the end of the raid. <br>
<br>
10.5.        The organizer may at his or her discretion invite members of guilds that do book the planes to fill any needed classes to ensure the safety of the raid. These shall not be from the guild of the organizer. <br>
<br>
10.6.        The raid is concluded when the organizer deems there is no longer sufficient force to hold the plane, and the plane will be yielded to the next booking guild for early entry, if they desire.<br>
<br>
11.        Gods: As there are a limited number of guilds that can take the gods on the server, a guild that has a plane booked when the gods are up, may allow one of the guilds that are capable of taking the gods (A note will be made on innoruuk.com if a guild wishes to attempt one or both of the gods) to enter the plane for the purpose of taking out the god.<br>
<br>
11.1.        No mini- bosses or other mobs may be killed by this guild attempting the god, unless it is unavoidable. <br>
<br>
11.2.        The current guild in the planes does not have to allow the interruption for the killing of the god.<br>
<br>
11.3.        No limit is placed on the number of guests that may be brought up for the purpose of killing the god. These guests are to enter only when the god is ready to be pulled and are required to leave once the god has been slain, or following any CR efforts conclusion. Or at the end of the raid period. (unless the next guild allows the CR to continue.)<br>
<br>
12.        Violations:  Violations of this policy  will be discussed on innoruuk.com in the GUILD forum. All punitive actions must be ratified by the simple majority of guild representatives.<br>
<br>
12.2.        Repeated violations, or more serious violations may subject the guild to a removal of all current bookings, and prevention of booking for up to a month. <br>
<br>
12.3.        Confirmed poaching (IE having the guild in the planes with no booking, ) will subject the guild to removal of all raids and banning from posting additional raids for a period of 3 months.<br>
<br>
13.        Enactment: Following the ratification of this treaty, all current bookings will be considered valid, but no further bookings will be allowed until all booking restrictions under the new agreement have been met.  All current bookings will be modified to reflect the new 24 hour status of the bookings, and the time allotment will allow for it. This is to help stop the current poaching problem.<br>
<br>
14.        Ratification: This treaty shall be considered ratified by the adoption and approval of  2/3rds of the guild leaders of innoruuk with at least 18 planes capable people. <br>
<br>
15.        Modification: All amendments to this treaty are to be proposed on innoruuk.com in the GUILDS forum. Any amendment that is moved and seconded by at least 2 participating guilds representatives will then be vote upon by the representatives of the participating guilds.  All amendments must have the affirmative vote of 2/3rds of the participating guilds that vote on the amendment. Each vote will continue for 1 week, to allow all guild representatives time to participate.<br>
<br>
16.        Dissolution: This agreement between guilds shall no longer be binding if more than 1/3 the guilds with 18 planes ready people in them, declare their intent to abandon it, or are currently not allowed to book for poaching. This is to prevent honorable guilds from being bound by a resolution that no longer functions if those agreeing to it, abuse it.<br>

Too often you'll see people clearing planes twice in that time and utterly destroying the next booked guild's chances of starting their raid before midnight. That's not fair to the majority of guilds.<br>
<br>
I'd suggest lowering the booking time to 12 hours. <p><center><img src="http://www.fnurt.net/~buckethead/lhilesig.jpg" align=middle></center>

<br>
No offence Tash, but it seems you have take the original summit and summit 2 and plaguerised away.. I think the only difference would be adding 10 hours to a booking.. and where you state that 1- 3 days would be used for non guilded people and public raids ran by Inny.com staff.. /boggle<br>
<br>
Although I appreciate the time you took to type up your notes.. You suggestions will not work..<br>
<br>
If you look at server consensus, the summit is old, fragile and supports the minority rather than the majority. Yours is no different...<br>
<br>
FFA/FiF is the logical way forward.. No ties, no laws and no bs about people using loopholes to gain an advantage. With FFA/FiF all is fair.. <br>
<br>

The poachings that normaly go on, occur durring the time when no guild is allowed to be up in hate. Eliminate that time and you eliminate some of the poaching. Since the booking covers 24 hours, thats enough time for 2 or three respawns depending on what is up and speed with which it is cleared.  Since the summit allows only 1 booking per day. Why not just change the booking to be a set period, and allow the guild with the booking to be in all day. <br>
<br>
Since every booking is the same lenght sure that doesnt mean that things will be up right when the booking starts, but it would not have necessarily been up for the guild befor when thier booking starts. However under this modification you are guaranteed a full spawn of statics by 11 AM pst, even if the guild before you  killed the last mob seconds before gating out at 3am.<br>

All these posts are a waste of time.<br>
<br>
Schedule a summit meeting for the guilds to show up, FRig.<br>
<br>
Since it's up to the guild leaders what the rules will be, let them discuss it together in a chat forum.<br>
<br>
And lets face it, if the uber guilds don't agree, there is no summit.<br>
<br>
And i'd like to remind people that the original summit was a agreement with the few high level guilds.<br>
<br>
It has become much more now, and really no longer serves it's original purpose.<br>
<br>
I'm sick and tired of guilds trying to blackmail us into killing the gods for them.<br>
Demanding loot rights and such.<br>
<br>
And then if you check the zone almost everything is up? THe booking guilds can't even clear the zone!<br>
Yet they reserve it so others can't go in and kill the spawns?<br>
That sound right?  <br>
<br>
And if someone does go in after they finish and give up.  They are publicly harrassed and condemned on these boards.<br>
<br>
I'm getting sick and tired of being taken advantage of....<br>
