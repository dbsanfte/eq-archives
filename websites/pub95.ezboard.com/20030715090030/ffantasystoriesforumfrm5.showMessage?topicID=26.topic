She reported screams coming from the apartment next door to hers.  The police arrived at the apartment 20 minutes later, and found you, covered in the blood of the family, still holding the murder weapon.”<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “I didn’t kill anybody.”<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “Jaques Dutaunq, his wife, their 12 year old son, and their newborn baby girl.  All dead.  Your clothes, soaked in their blood.”<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “I didn’t kill anyone!”  Mia screamed at the police officer that sat across from her in the interrogation room.  Mia was sobbing as she was read the charges against her.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “Do you understand the charges that are being brought against you!?”  The detective screamed, slamming his fist down on the desk.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “No . . .”  Mia whispered through her tears, “I didn’t kill anyone.”<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Mia, shackled, waked slowly behind the officer that was leading her to her cell.  The over starched blue clothes they had made her wear rubbed uncomfortably against her thighs.  Nothing seemed real anymore.  There was no part of Mia that could believe what was happening to her.  So she treated it like a dream.  Words did not come to her, only the rough, harsh, beginnings of words.  Thoughts were also slow in coming, she was no longer able to comprehend what others were saying to her, or even what she was saying to herself.  All she heard were the voices that had haunted her dreams for the past few months.  And every day, every minute, every second that ticked by, the voice sounded more and more like her own.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp The light tore through the darkness like shards of glass through skin.  Mia was laying on a bed, her arms and legs strapped down.  Men were loosening the straps, and then moving her to a wheel chair, and strapping her in.  They pushed her through the long corridors, each painted in horrible shades of institutional green.  She was pushed into a room with a table, a chair, and nothing else.  She sat for a few moments, before a man dressed in an old tweed suit came into the room and sat down opposite her.  He carried a folder full of papers and a smug expression.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “What’s your name?”  He asked in a dry voice.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “I don’t know.”  Replied Mia after a few moments.  She strained against the leather straps that were pinning her down, looking from side to side, still not sure if all this was real.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “Since you have been here, we have been unable to determine your identity.”  The man’s words floated to Mia, came slowly and painfully, the very vibrations upsetting the harmony of her ears.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “How . . . how long have I . . .”  Mia’s eyes rolled up into her head and she chocked on the saliva trickling down her dry throat.  “How long have I been here?”  She finally said in a crackling low voice.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “You have been here for a little over 7 months.”<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “Seven months?!”  Mia said, shocked.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “We have kept you subdued for most of that time, I am not surprised that you have no memory of your time here.  I am here to determine if you are mentally fit enough for trial.”<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “Trial . .?”  <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “You are being charged with four counts of first degree murder.  These are very serious charges and we have to know if you have the capacity, both mentally and physically, to stand trial.”  Mia stared at the man.  She stared right through his thick, old fashioned bifocals, right into his eyes.  She saw no one inside, she did not sense a soul, he seemed to be only an illusion.  <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “I didn’t kill anyone.”<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “I’m afraid the evidence suggests otherwise.”  The man said as he opened the folder and began shifting through the papers.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “I DIDN’T KILL ANYONE!”  Mia screamed, the effort causing her pain, her voice ripping through her dry throat.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp The man stared at her, not moving, not blinking.  His eyes turned red and drops of blood leaked from them and dripped down his face, landing with a splash on the cold metallic table.  Mia moaned in horror, unable to move, unable to scream, unable to do anything.  Blood started pouring from the man’s nose and mouth as he started leaning in towards her.  Mia closed her eyes and her mind screamed, for her voice could not.  Her restraints pooped open and she reached out and pushed the corpse back the other direction.  He fell to the floor with a thump.  Footsteps echoed down the corridor outside.  “Is everything ok in here . . .”  A nurse had opened the door.  Before the nurse had registered that there was a dead man on the floor, her life too ended.  Mia had reached around from behind the door and snapped her neck.  Closing the door, Mia quickly tore the cloths off the nurse and changed into them.  <br>
<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp In this disguise she walked out of the hospital and went back to her apartment.  The doors to her building were boarded up, the building condemned.  Mia stood in the street, swaying with exhaustion, freezing with the cold wind that whistled through the buildings down the street.<br>
